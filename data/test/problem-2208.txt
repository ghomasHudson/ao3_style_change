and just then the bell above the door rang as a small boy entered the shop. For a moment the noises of Diagon Alley grew louder, then faded away again. The door had slammed shut.
The lake lay calm and dark in front of him. Nothing moved, no gurgling, no strange shapes between the waves, only the light wind glided gently over the water’s surface. Harry squatted down and fixed his gaze at the spot where the figure had been seen a moment ago.
“– A natural. I know!” Harry finished Draco’s sentence with a bold grin and got an eye roll from Draco. “You don’t have to massage my ego, your moans were confirmation enough for me,” he added. But he admitted inwardly that Draco was allowed to massage something else.
"Hmm," Harry returned with little eloquence, then something caught his eye and his smile broadened. He let go of Draco's body, walked in quick steps a few metres along the stable wall, where he reached his destination.
To describe Draco as simply appearing feminine would have been too easy. It wasn't wrong, but it wasn't enough either. The lingerie did everything and nothing for him, just like the hair. They accentuated Draco's softness, his gentleness, as well as his fire and passion, doing exactly what Harry had hoped and dreamed of. But it wasn't them who
Harry didn't have to bear the sight for long, Draco already turned on his heel and fled towards the guesthouse. Someone called his name, Pansy. Harry watched Blaise leap up and rush after Draco, Pansy following on his heels. Only Theo stayed behind and looked almost expectantly in Harry's direction.
"That means they made Granger a babysitter as well?" Draco looked indistinctly into the air in front of him and seemed amused. "That has a sweet taste to it."
“Don’t tell me Draco Malfoy thinks his charm isn’t enough to spellbind Harry Potter a little longer,” Harry tried to joke, but he didn’t laugh, and neither did Draco. The conversation felt so heavy, so final.
"Most of you know the rules of the competition, but a refresh of your memory can't hurt, so read them again carefully! I don't want any slip-ups this year, understand?" Mrs Longbottom looked over at Draco's table. There Pansy giggled and leaned over to whisper something in Draco's ear.
Draco raised his head in amazement and nodded. "Someone has been paying attention in geography class. I’m deeply impressed."
way… But then came Weasley and Granger.” Harry wasn’t sure how to deal with the answer. On the one hand, he was tempted to ask if Draco was only interested in him because he was his saviour, but on the other hand, he already suspected that Draco couldn’t know the answer to that question. Either way, it didn’t make Harry feel any better.
Ron, Hermione and Harry had gone to the library after lunch the next day, where Harry had told them in detail about his observations. Hermione leafed through a thick book about magical sea creatures and skimmed the lines as she spoke.
The feast is celebrated at the Burrow, all of the Weasleys and their families return to their old home for the nights, so Harry promptly offers to spend his own in his flat. Mrs Weasley vehemently insists upon housing Harry in the already too small house, so Harry leaves Pup to Nellie, packs his gift-filled trunks and settles into the room allotted to him.
, Draco could ride! The determination with which he led his pony through the various obstacles, the speed at which he rode the gelding, the accuracy of his throw, it was pure madness. Luna had no chance; Draco won the race with ease.
All the blood that had already accumulated in Harry’s groin at the sight of Draco now made its way unerringly to his cheeks, so he grabbed Draco by the neck and pulled him into a desperate kiss. Draco’s comments shouldn’t confuse him again, and since Harry’s strength wasn’t necessarily his words, he now moved on to action.
Harry would have expected Draco to react with discomfort to so much undivided attention, but the pale pink glint on his cheeks suggested to Harry that the opposite was the case. He would’ve probably never admitted it, but Draco was downright
"I know it sounds crazy, but I ... need to know because that would prove something I'm not quite sure about," Harry explains himself awkwardly. He is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, but it is already far too late to back out.
"Happy birthday, Mr Potter. It was an honour to take your virginity," he whispered amusedly, smiling smugly at Harry. The latter returned the smile with a shake of his head. Just what had he gotten himself into?
Draco's hair is tied at the nape of his neck, a few loose strands falling into his face. The steep line between his eyebrows, which Harry feels the need to smooth from his skin, is clearly visible. His lower lip is a bit swollen and redder than the upper. Harry wonders if it is because of their shared kisses or because Draco has been nervously chewing on it. Whatever it is, Draco is beautiful. Almost angelic.
doesn't quite fit. You are all of age! However, if that should be a problem for you, we can arrange another teammate for you." Mrs Longbottom looked expectantly at Ron, who once again looked panicked at Harry.
The breakthrough finally occurred when Hermione resorted to using muggle methods. Essentially, the Curse-Breakers merely tricked the curse into believing that the afflicted body had already perished. It was a methodology that was not entirely innovative within the craft of curse-breaking, but in the case of the curse that had troubled Hermione's team, the effect only struck when there was no magic involved. Although this was not the desired counter-curse, it was an alternative that all Healers gratefully accepted.
And ended with Harry throwing a twig at Draco when he started to badmouth Ron's riding skills. Harry probably could have guessed that Andvari would shy. But he hadn't. Draco got his pony back under control in seconds, he was
When the evening hours of the day have already dawned, Draco perches on the burgundy couch in the drawing room, sipping from time to time the tea Harry has prepared for him and leafing thoughtlessly through a work by Jane Austen. He barely lifts his head when Harry flops exhaustedly down beside him and holds the envelope out to him.
Harry decided that this was the right moment to intervene and interrupt Draco. "On another subject, where were you yesterday at noon? You missed your riding lesson, and you seemed to care a lot about the –“
Parkinson gives the impression of not being very eager to hold a long conversation with Harry, and since the feeling is mutual, Harry decides to go for the offensive. It seems to him the most efficient way to make the most of this opportunity and get to his answer.
"You're not pathetic," Ron reassures him with a small smile. "I'd go nuts too if I realised I had a crush on that ferret."
Nevertheless, just as often as he had been exuberantly rewarded for trifles such as brushing his teeth on his own, he had been rudely kicked out of the room when important wixen came to visit or doors slammed in his face when he had once again turned into a waterfall of questions. Mr Malfoy in particular had mostly just given the little boy the cold shoulder and after he had once lashed out when Malfoy had been particularly intrusive while toddling through Mr Malfoy's office, the boy's questions ceased, as if the unquenchable thirst for knowledge had never burned within him.
Draco had already transformed. He let himself drift in the water and held on to the edge of the pool. He really didn’t make much of the fact that he had to be an excellent swimmer and only moved in the water when absolutely necessary. But Harry couldn’t blame him. It was late, people were sleeping at this time of night, so Draco was just as tired. Harry wordlessly stripped off his invisibility cloak, today he was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt, which he usually only wore for Quidditch practice or sleeping. It was comfortable, yet Harry felt strange because he couldn’t at all match the dazzling beauty of Draco. Not that he wanted to, it was just not exactly exhilarating for his self-confidence.
"What do you want to talk about?" Draco wants to know, leaning his head against the back of the burgundy couch and drawing his legs up onto the seat. His eyes remain intently trained on Harry.
Harry knows Draco is not talking about his feelings – not exclusively. There is more that stands between them. Things that will not simply disappear. But Draco has just taken the first step. He has stepped onto the thin ice.
I did not know what Pythonel was. Sure, I had picked up the name somewhere, but never looked into it further or figured out what it was about. It had not seemed important enough to me. Long-solved cases had never particularly hooked me during my Auror training.
Draco looked at Harry over his shoulder in surprise but kept walking with firm steps. "Do I appear bothered?"
In Harry, the alarm bells rang while he drew circles with his thumb on Draco's waist. "Just a little more," he lied, because Draco's body was tensing more and more and he seemed anything but relaxed. "Does it hurt?"
"I'm not saying that I would have testified in your favour if I had thought about it – that wouldn't be honest. But it wasn't right that I didn't. Just as it wasn't right that I didn't think about it then." The apology stings in Harry's chest, as he knows he should have voiced it earlier. But it is not as simple as that.
Harry looks blankly at the young man. The hope that everything will be back to normal tomorrow is fading at breakneck speed, leaving an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of Harry's stomach.
“Why Ariel, Ron? Wasn't she a redhead? That's more like you Weasleys!” Seamus Finnigan, a half-blood and thus apparently familiar with most Muggle tales, moved closer to them, revealing that he had been listening.
“Draco,” Harry hissed so quietly that only the Slytherin could really hear it, while he left his gaze pinned on Flitwick, just as Draco did. Actually, rather on the notes on the blackboard, because Draco’s actions slowly turned him on and that was enough reason not wanting to stare at his Charms Professor. Draco, however, didn’t stop and took the whisper of his name only as an incentive to move his hand even quicker. Harry had to make an effort not to gasp when Draco’s fingers had reached their destination and wrapped around the slight bulge in his jeans.
Cold sweat runs down Harry's nape, but he only scoffs. "You're talking about an exhibit that you're not actually entitled to any more. Say it out loud! It is
Draco's gaze, sweeping serenely through the shop, catches Harry's and a smile lights up the wizard's face.
"I have no control over that, Draco," I replied quietly, shaking my head. There was so much more he did not understand that I could not tell him.
Before Harry could ask his question, Draco moved his finger deeper, tentatively and as if he was trying to feel for something. Harry gasped and closed his eyes, that was good. In no way painful, as he had feared. Draco's finger slipped smoothly out of him, another finger sank into Harry and caused him to tighten his grip around Draco's body in surprise. Still no pain, but he could feel the burn of the stretch and Draco still groped as if –
He pushes the thought aside and tells Filly goodbye, who immediately leaves the room. He does not know why he feels so empty as soon as the door closes again. Finally, he has what he wanted. A reason to carry on and not simply evade the whole matter again.
Draco didn't even look up when Harry dropped onto a chair opposite him with a sigh. Nevertheless, he tensed up a little bit, which Harry could immediately notice from the cramped grip on the quill. “So… your true love,” Harry began but stopped because he felt extremely stupid about all this.
"Mhm, anything you say, Potter," Draco replied disinterestedly, not even looking up. Unless Harry was mistaken, he had his eyes closed and was just basking. What a lazy piece of –
I thought of Filly's words. Of how this Malfoy possibly had a consciousness and therefore had weaknesses just like everyone else. And Healer Isaksen's words came to mind, which had urged compassion and forbearance. I felt neither towards Malfoy, but it did not matter all that much. If Filly was right, Malfoy only had to
With his fingers he placed the fishnet exactly where he needed it, then he leaned in and took Draco's cock in his mouth. Draco smelled of vanilla even between his legs, but also of something rich that made Harry's heart race. It was
Harry longed for him. Despite his clearly averse thoughts, his legs set off on their own until it was too late and Harry settled down next to Draco without waiting for a word of consent.
Harry Potter is wearing clothes that make him appear as if he is supposed to be on his way to visit his grandparents for an afternoon tea. Anja knows Mr Potter's past, so she assumes he always looks like this and does not visit graves with tea. He looks as the stories describe him: long, stubborn hair tied in a messy bun at the nape of his neck which simultaneously hides the famous scar on his forehead. He wears a beige cardigan over a cream sweatshirt and blue washed-out jeans on a body that looks surprisingly in shape. The green eyes are so vivid even behind the circular spectacles that they are inevitably the first thing to be noticed. The green lets the man appear younger than he is. Twenty-four years old, that is what Anja gathered from his file. Except for his eye colour, however, he looks much older, which he presumably owes to his designer stubble.
Not just any ponytail, no, it sat high on the back of his head, swaying from right to left with every step the blond walked. It wouldn't have been Draco's hair if the front strands hadn't fallen loose around his face, framing it in a delightful way. Harry simply melted away.
Draco's gaze met Harry's again, then he looked at Ron. "No, that works fine. I want whoever has more muscle."
Ginny feels differently, which was also the reason why they broke up in the autumn of 2002. Harry still loves her, in a way that feels right and does not hurt when they meet at the Burrow and she talks about her travels with the Holyhead Harpies. He knows that in another life he would have liked to have stayed with Ginny and maybe even married her. She always kept him on his toes, but that was exactly what drove them apart. Harry prefers to tread his life flat-footed after all.
Briskly, she turns to Draco, who regards her with a cocked eyebrow. "Tell me, Malfoy, what does it feel like to use Harry's wand?"
With a theatrical sigh, Harry settled at the Gryffindor table opposite Ron and Hermione. He was tired.
The ring of serpents. The waterspirit had to talk about Draco's ring, with the little engraved snake. It had already caught Harry's eye, but what the spirit could use this ring for, he couldn't think of. Actually, he could care less, because he had just received the assurance that he would “be freed from his desperate plight”. Nevertheless, his
He hates having to break promises. He hates having to accept losses just to make rescue possible. He hates that he always seems to be the one who has to bear the pain as a result. And he hates that each time he gets his hopes up that it might be different the next time.
"Just a stupid thought, let's not talk about it any further," Harry begged insistently, the situation became increasingly awkward for him from second to second.
“By the way, Bill answered! Apparently, he’s been able to find something about the curse. The letter ended up at the Burrow, don’t ask me why everyone always uses the most incompetent owls, but the letter should be here soon,” said Ron, who apparently wanted to change the subject.
Harry took the opportunity to get a better look at Draco's fish-half, which was moving rhythmically in the water less than two meters away. Even underwater, Draco's glow could not be overlooked, the scales shimmering even more brightly. Harry once again resisted the urge to reach out to touch them. The end of the fishtail was also interesting. Harry had already noticed that it looked finer, the scaling changed to a translucent, silk-like fin, which definitely had to be stronger than it looked.
Draco looked around frantically, his facade beginning to crumble dangerously. Then he grabbed Harry’s hand without further ado and pulled him behind him in a hurry, through the Entrance Hall, away from the interested glances that Harry felt burning on the back of his neck.
, they had only been children. And yet, every comment had had its effect. But what could one expect from children? All it took was a pair of glasses on his nose to be teased. A pale scar on his golden-brown forehead only made it worse. Not that Harry was ashamed of it. No, it just confirmed him that superficialities were ridiculously fleeting.
Only Ron and Hermione enquire about his visit to St Mungo’s on Wednesday evening. Harry keeps his explanations brief and is met with understanding, hence the conversation quickly devolves into other topics. He does not mention that the Aurors have asked for his help, not knowing well enough to what extent his discretion is obligatory. Instead, he listens to Ron talk about Fleur, who is expecting her third child with Bill and is therefore keeping the entire Weasley family busy. Ron thinks the commotion is silly after so many babies. Harry thinks that unborn little creatures cause the best kind of commotion. Hermione agrees with him unprompted.
Harry remains silent and bites his tongue hard. He recognises the tone that the Head of Auror Headquarters has just used. It is investigative, intimidating, just like they tried to teach him in Auror training. It indicates that Harry has just got a friend into trouble.
Harry lifted his head, met Draco's gaze and didn’t need to be able to see him to know that he had completely fallen for Harry. "Are you okay? Do you feel good?", Harry asked while replacing his tongue between Draco's legs with his fingertips. The question came rather late, which the moans of Draco only confirmed, but Harry asked it anyway.
With his body as heavy as lead, Harry steps closer to the window wall, stops and presses his fingertips against the cool glass. His thoughts focus only on the regular breaths he forces himself to take.
While Harry rained kisses on Draco’s neck, he hurriedly got rid of his pants, which his prick thanked him for. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry noticed the small tube right next to the bed, for which he silently thanked the Room of Requirement. With a quick movement, Harry grabbed it and lubed up his trembling cock. Fuck, this went fast. Faster than before, but that was all right, wasn’t it? The foreplay had been a complete success, Draco had practically asked Harry to do this.
"Let it happen," Ron muttered. Harry raised his head to look at his best friend and frowned. "No one likes to be vulnerable, Harry. But if you want to save this thing between you two, you have no choice but to be honest."
Draco raises his hand and gently strokes Pup's head, who immediately nestles against Draco's palm, purring. The fabric on his wrist rides up a bit and Harry catches a glimpse of colourful lines, drawn in ink, on Draco's skin. "You should.
Harry didn’t want to sound like he was defending himself, even if he was. Draco hadn’t yet agreed, which put Harry under enormous pressure. A simple yes couldn’t be that hard to get across. With his hands buried in his jeans pockets, Harry wondered if his mind was right after all and Draco had nothing more than a pejorative look for him.
"And if I do?" Harry asks, glaring angrily at Hermione. He does not understand why she thinks she has the right to illustrate his world to him.
"We could arrange a consultation with Robards and appeal to his conscience," Hermione suggests. "I'm fairly confident he'll show some empathy and willingly give you the diary."
Draco nervously licked his lips and kept smiling crookedly. "Just to avoid further misunderstandings, we're both talking about –" He took a deep breath. "About you putting your –" Draco broke off and stared at a point next to Harry's head.
Ron gives Hermione a look, but then resolutely faces Harry again. "I'm saying that even if this situation with you and Malfoy had any realistic chance at all, you're still at completely different points in your lives."
This was the best news in a long time and it would be madness not to try. In his mind, Harry saw Hermione in front of him, telling him he was mental because he was putting himself headfirst in danger that he really didn’t have to take on. After all, he had already offered to fulfil the condition as he was willing to sleep with Draco. Draco
Harry gave Ron a look that was roughly the equivalent of giving him the finger. Meanwhile, Blaise choked on his orange juice and tried to hide his laughter with a cough. Draco just cocked an eyebrow and looked back and forth between his best friend and Ron as if he could stare an explanation out of them.
A heavy burden lifts from Harry's shoulders. He feels as though he finally has the ability to breathe freely again after months. He has kept his promise and Draco has regained his freedom.
"You can't be serious," grumbled Draco, who, in the distinctly more eerie darkness, huddled closer to Harry and flinched as something rustled in the undergrowth near them. "
“Somehow, nature has to make sure that I am fed,” replied Draco, who also kept his eyes on their fingers.
The White Tomb lies seemingly untouched on the shore of the Great Lake and blends seamlessly into the late February-kissed landscape. Purple, blue and yellow crocuses sprout around the white stone, adding a touch of comfort to the otherwise dreary sight. The sun is high above the Great Lake, not yet fully at its zenith, brightening the tomb with warm rays.
Frowning, I approached it but did not let go of Draco's hand. Two boys stood facing each other on the narrow path laid with pebbles. One was blond, no more than five years old, and held out his tiny hand to the much taller and older boy, who had dark, curly hair.
, which reminded him strongly of the incident in the morning. Ron and Hermione had fallen for Draco within a second. Was that what the line meant? Did that simply mean that all those who saw Draco in his mer-creature form would be charmed by him and under his spell? Seemed like it, so he kept going.
Harry closes his eyes and rubs the bridge of his nose under his glasses. This person felt like they were Malfoy. In a way, they might be. It is not a stranger. It is someone he can assess and someone he knows. He knows
"Oh, of course. Thank you, Seamus. To Harry and Ronald, this is an all-Icelandic-horse-farm. You will each be allocated a pony to look after for the next two weeks. And yes, they are already assigned and as always adapted to your riding level. You'll find the list in the stables and there you can get acquainted with the ponies right away," Mrs Longbottom explained, and as soon as she had finished, the group started moving. Harry followed in the footsteps of the other participants and also got up to leave the room.
Harry remained buried deep inside Draco for a moment, getting used to the feeling and waited for Draco to open his eyes again and give Harry an enchanting smile. Draco's hand moved to Harry's cheek, stroking his chin and jaw. Harry slid a little out of Draco and as he thrust inside again, he bent down to Draco and captured his lips with his own.
Draco was lying on his side next to Harry, eyeing him insistently and with a crooked smile on his lips, which revealed that he probably felt a little bit uncomfortable with the confession. Harry blinked at him, if he thought about it, then yes – it did calm him down. And sent a new wave of nervousness through his body. But the good kind of nervousness.
If I had not still been busy recovering from my nausea, I would have laughed bitterly. "You can't be serious. Your father has ransomed himself. That's all!"
Inside me, curiosity fought with the uneasiness that spread through my body. It felt terribly intimate to be here. To be able to watch
Merlin, that wasn’t good. Not in class, not when everyone could see them, not here, not now! But Harry was unable to resist; the blood that was pumped to his centre was probably missing in his brain by now. Why he still managed to flush, made no sense.
Harry kisses a path down Draco's neck and chest, running his tongue over every inch of pale skin. Hands buried in Harry's hair, Draco arches his back and presses against Harry, gasping. The sweet sounds spur Harry on, his lips ghosting over Draco's shivering stomach and finding their way down to his thighs.
“That was because I was under your spell or charm or whatever,” Harry lied. Well, he wasn’t entirely lying, but he wasn’t quite telling the truth either.
Draco frowns and regards Harry a little puzzled. Whether it is the sudden closeness of the two of them or Harry's statement, Harry cannot tell. Since Draco makes no attempt to retreat, Harry could care less and gingerly reaches for the hand Draco has buried in Pup's fur. Bringing their intertwined fingers between them, he looks at Draco intently.
Harry felt himself slowly but surely heading towards a destination, not knowing whether he would be able to pull the brakes in time. Draco seemed to notice it too, as he breathlessly broke away from Harry, only fractions before it was too late. Draco's gaze, clouded and heated, found Harry's, he opened his mouth only to close it again. Another kiss followed, but this time Draco rose a little, causing Harry's fingers to slide out of him and he crawled beside him over Harry's spread legs.
Malfoy laughed mirthlessly, leaning back on the bench and crossing his arms in front of his chest. "Your arrogance is remarkable, Potter. Good to know you haven't changed a bit." He released a studied breath and met my gaze unflinchingly. "No, my diary isn't a Horcrux."
“I’m here and I have the ring!” Harry started before he had even reached the lakeshore while pulling the invisibility cloak off his body. He didn’t want to bother with pleasantries now. He heard the splashing immediately, just as he recognised the perfidiously grinning monster immediately between the gentle waves of the big lake. Instantly one of the bony hands reached out to Harry –  no, to the ring.
"Your body temperature is below thirty-two degrees. We have reached moderate hypothermia, from now on your consciousness will be clouded."
“You are impossible!” Hermione giggled just as Harry caught up with them, then she swiftly pulled Ron down towards her for a kiss.
“Then why wasn’t Harry under the spell? If it, as you say, could’ve happened to anyone?” Ron had a point, so far Hermione hadn’t come up with a good answer for that, so she kept eating her lunch. There was no point in worrying about it, as long as Draco was being stubborn, they wouldn’t know anything about it anyway.
Mr Longbottom looked at his wristwatch in surprise and nodded. "That means we'd better hurry. Mount up, gentlemen, and no dawdling. Blaise, Neville, get in the car!"
"I'm impressed. You truly have a remarkable capacity for perception, Mr Potter. You should consider becoming an Auror," Draco replied in a butter-soft voice, wrapping the end of the ribbon, which was tied around his waist, around his fingers.
Harry is about to retort something, but the Healer gently squeezes his shoulder once, nods at him and then turns into another corridor. The sinking feeling that this was his last encounter with the witch refuses to fade. He swallows it down, pushes aside the emotions that accompany it and focuses entirely on Draco, whose chin has dropped to his chest but otherwise has not moved.
Harry spurred Hetja on, felt the wind in his hair and tried not to think. He thought anyway. He thought of the fact that the Pony-Olympics were being held today and that they were in the process of missing them. It was supposed to be the grand finale, everyone, especially Draco, had been looking forward to it. But it had also meant the end of the two weeks, the highlight before the farewell. Harry had looked forward to it with sweet bitterness.
Draco was neither smaller nor taller than Harry, Draco towered over him by at most one little centimetre, which was not particularly noticeable considering Harry's unruly hair. This meant that Draco's eyes were just the right height for Harry to inspect them in every detail without even having to move his head. The grey was clear, like water under sunlight and yet sombre, like a thick fog on a rainy day. The eyes were framed by long, thick eyelashes, it was as if Harry was seeing them for the first time and he was no less fascinated than by Draco's scalp hair.
Draco did not need my words. The small smile did not fade from his lips as he turned on his side and carefully raised a hand. He traced the tips of his fingers down the sleeve of my jumper, never managing to touch. The protection spells proved merciless, which did not stop him from watching his fingers in fascination.
tired. Earlier that morning, he had briefly toyed with the idea of just turning around, going back to sleep and skipping the morning classes, but he didn't want to miss the opportunity to watch Draco during their Charms lesson.
"Remus", Lupin corrected hurriedly, he closed the zipper of his bag and looked at Sirius with pure interest. That wasn't unusual, Sirius' appearance elicited a reaction from most people that lay somewhere between "Oh my God, Harry, your godfather is so cool!" and "That your uncle chooses
Draco laughed softly, the sound causing Harry to harden. "She's not a woman," he whispered conspiratorially at Harry's ear, his finger pressing against Harry's entrance with more pressure.
My gaze drifted from Malfoy's jaw to his eyes, which lay calculatingly on my face. His cheeks and skin seemed almost smooth compared to his ailing counterpart, and his lips looked velvety soft in contrast.
The latter blinks the moisture from the corners of his eyes. "I don't need those. Can you discharge him?"
The creature didn't answer but tilted its head a little, which made it seem even eerier. Harry tried giving it a weird smile. Then something stirred in the water. The creature actually raised its bony arm and stretched it out in Harry's direction as if it wanted to shake his hand. Harry laughed hysterically for a moment, staring at the grey hand. Dark scales were visible in some places, and he clearly saw that its hands were webbed.
", at first not noticing the figure moving silently across the room and settling on the other end of the couch.
Harry's thumb traced along Draco's chin, the blond didn't seem sure whether to blush or grin smugly, so it ended up being a mixture of the two. "
His friends are there for him. Ron offers to take Harry to a Quidditch match or visit him in his flat after work. Hermione lends Harry loads of books, which turn out to be so enthralling that Harry is able to forget his everyday life for a brief moment, and hugs him goodbye a few seconds longer than necessary. Harry rejects the big gestures but gladly accepts the small ones.
With wise caution, Harry didn’t enter the dangerous territory that was Draco's father, instead he preferred to continue watching the riding lesson. Draco's pale skin and fair hair stood in such stark contrast to Feykir's blackness that they looked made for each other. Harry smiled at himself, he really had to stop thinking so obsessively. Although, Draco would certainly enjoy the attention.
Oh. Something unpleasantly sharp pierced through Harry's chest. Draco didn't tell his father about Harry. He knew what that meant.
. Thanks to last night's snow, which has once again coloured the roofs of the shops white, Harry finds Diagon Alley surprisingly empty. Moreover, it is Sunday, which is also the reason why Harry has sought out Kingsley outside his office.
Soft lips found Harry’s again, even though he wasn’t really able to respond to the kiss. Instead, he held on to Draco and the stable wall so as not to sink to his knees or fall. Draco's fingers massaged Harry's length in an urgent rhythm. They seemed experienced, hell, if that was Draco's first time, then Harry voluntarily ate a hat. And they dyed Harry's cock completely with orange paint. He couldn’t take his eyes off the sight.
Pup only accepts being picked up from Draco's lap under protest, which Harry acknowledges with a roll of his eyes, but grants them both a minute to bid each other a fond farewell. Harry silently wonders if Draco will feel comfortable in his small attic flat, as that is where he will presumably be staying for a while after the spook is over. Draco does have more than enough gold to find a place of his own, but even with Ron's help, it seems complicated to get hold of Lucius Malfoy's inheritance. So Draco has nothing, except Harry.
Draco noticed Harry, seeming somehow rushed, and ran his fingers through the now dry hair. At least he was clothed, hopefully, there wouldn’t be another
He cleared his throat again, looked into the flames and hid behind the protective wall in his heart. "Did you ever wonder why he calls you Zabini? You've been friends forever, but when he talks about you, it sounds like you're strangers."
It would probably have been wiser to leave Draco Malfoy alone after his countless warnings, but Harry thought he knew better. Although he became a tiny bit more subtle in his observations and didn't try to talk to Draco about this anymore for the time being, he definitely didn't stay away. He told Ron and Hermione nothing of the little incident that had happened between him and Draco. That Draco was somehow capable of becoming master of his deeds was frightening enough. So Harry took the rest of the day to think about everything. Draco was not just a simple sea creature, no, he apparently had magical abilities beyond the ordinary.
"I think so, yes." I exhaled. Surprisingly, Malfoy's neutrality made it easier to be sincere. I could not help but notice how rehearsed the neutrality was. I wondered how many times Malfoy had had these conversations. I did not even want to know.
Harry, whose thoughts had reached the level of confusion of the interior of the Burrow, was more desperate than ever while he endured the lessons in disregard. Every encouraging word of his friends bounced off him as if he was immune to it, not even the sight of Draco tore him out of his trance. He hated it. He didn’t want to be like that, he wanted to fight and not feel pushed into a corner. He was not a substitute player, and he didn’t want to be.
Draco’s fingers in his hand and in his hair tightened a little when Harry started to place light kisses on the edge of the waistband and to lick teasingly over the light skin in some places. Whenever Harry came across one of the pale scars, he took extra time to caress it with all his patience. He owed Draco that much.
Harry shook his head over his thoughts and began to draw random patterns on a parchment. It couldn’t be that, he wasn’t homophobic. Technically, he was not interested at all in the sex life of others, not even in Draco’s. But only technically. The curse practically forced him to think about it. Yes, it had to be that! He just didn’t like to think about the whole subject and felt uncomfortable because he had no other choice at the moment.
Harry watched them perplexed, then groaned in annoyance. "Damn my luck," he murmured to himself. His stomach was on fire. Viktor was only spared his fate because Neville made some strange noises on Harry's shoulder and Harry preferred loyalty to his friends to revenge.
The rules of the obstacle course were simple. There was one runner and one rider per team. The runner started at the starting whistle, had to cross the poles and obstacles that were set up on the riding arena and on the other side of the arena he had to fish an apple from a waist-high, water-filled barrel and bring it back to the team's rider on the same way. As soon as the runner reached the rider and the apple was handed over, the rider was allowed to mount his horse and ride the same course as the runner. The rider had to throw the apple with a certain distance into the barrel. The winner was the team where the rider reached the runner first.
Harry kept shaking his head, then stood up and went to his wardrobe. Ron just muttered something about, "
On one hand, he feels cool air and soft fabric. The other hand is enveloped in the warmth of another.
On a Wednesday in the midst of October, the three of them sitting on the veranda wrapped in blankets and sipping hot drinks, it occurs to Harry to ask Hermione why she chose tea instead of the sweet, homemade mulled wine.
Harry picks it up and finds an address written on it. He raises his head in surprise, but his expression immediately clears. Of course. Jimar's fiancée will be able to help, she knows him better than most.
Malfoy's magic by no means feels intrusive, dances around Harry's rather than enveloping it. It is faint, more a flicker than a glow, but it is clearly tangible. Gently, steadily, Harry's magic wraps itself around the new one, sealing it in, preventing its escape.
Outraged, Draco regained his composure, pushed Harry off him and hurriedly looked around to finally sort himself out.
, it gave Harry's skin goosebumps. His breath faltered and he sank his entire length into Draco, who clutched his hair, squeezed his eyes shut and apparently focused all his energy on a calm breath, while he could barely suppress a moan.
Harry shoots Jimar an incredulous look but reads no sarcasm in his expression. "I doubt that. Not when it comes to relevant information or names."
"Yes," Draco replied, then lowered his gaze again to the poppies before him. The movement caused more strands to come loose from Draco's ponytail.
Draco's eyes widened, the soft pink shimmer on his cheeks darkened. He looked at Harry, it was as though he couldn't look away. And Harry looked back, blocking out everything and everyone, he played and sang out of pure instinct, his attention solely focused only on Draco.
Harry was just about to look around when the door behind him opened and Draco entered the bathroom. In his arms, he carried a small pile of folded clothes, the top two of which he pressed against Harry’s chest. “I’m going to assume you didn’t bring any spare clothes.”
The Gryffindors finished their breakfast and slowly made their way to Charms class. Inwardly Harry swore like a trooper. Seamus didn't come off very well in his thoughts, but that was all irrelevant. He had to make a plan to avoid Draco until he could control his murderous thoughts and that could take a few days, knowing the Slytherin. If he was lucky, Draco would keep a low profile in public for fear that his secret would get around
Draco's pale fingers, completely dyed, worked over every millimetre of his skin, which stood on fire under every touch. Harry closed his eyes, if he kept watching, he wouldn’t last much longer. So he buried his nose in the crook of Draco's neck, inhaled the scent of vanilla and let his hand slide out of Draco's hair down to his waistband.
Draco's impressed expression informs Harry that he is accurate in his guess and he can barely suppress his triumphant smile.
Draco's hand found the distinct bulge in Harry's crotch and he smiled contentedly into the kiss. Harry almost protested at that much smugness. Draco stood half-naked before him, they kissed not exactly innocently and Draco rubbed against him as if there was no tomorrow. Those were more than enough reasons to be hard after only two minutes of kissing.
Mr Potter does not say anything for a while, continues to look through the window to the bed and seems to be processing what he has just learnt.
"Tell me when you want me to stop," Harry said calmly and at the same time began to caress the thighs in front of him. Draco gasped, his legs trembled with joyful anticipation, it brought a satisfied smile to Harry's face. Then he leaned forward and placed gentle kisses on the soft skin that connected Draco's thighs and arse. His fingertips still circled on the quivering legs.
The spot at the edge of the forest where Draco and he had disappeared into the forest the last time was quickly found. Hedwig, who had followed him well-behaved up to now, whimpered and turned restlessly in circles as Harry was about to fight his way through some thorns. Oh great, soon all animals would go crazy. Harry called for her calmly, but the dog only saw Harry's voice as a request to run away in the opposite direction. Harry stared after her with wide eyes, but Hedwig didn't turn around anymore.
He nearly trips over a few children giggling as they chase a flying paper dragon, but arrives safely at the shop door of
The years after the war made up the majority of the memories I had looked at with Malfoy. He had shown them to me more willingly than the others, had answered unspoken questions, and yet had ensured that I was able to examine everything at my leisure, without an opinion lingering in my ear.
If he is completely honest, he does not know the Malfoy he encounters in this book, nor the one who fears for his life in a hospital bed. He only knows the image of him he has created for himself.
"Oh my God, shut up," Draco groaned impatiently, dug his fingers into Harry's shirt collar and pressed his lips against Harry's with a little too much verve.
Before Harry could walk the remaining meters between himself and Draco, he heard the screech of a post owl. More precisely, the screeching of Errol, who performed an astonishing crash landing next to Harry’s feet and simply remained there until Harry squatted in front of the owl and poked him with a finger. The old creature then gathered itself and held out a foot with a small letter tied to it. That had to be Bill’s letter! Errol arrived quite late, but the joy of the news made Harry ignore this fact. He hurriedly untied the letter, slipped it into his pocket, and then looked up, straight into amused grey eyes.
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly. "Have you ever talked to your parents about… yourself?" More specifically about Potter's sexuality, which Draco didn't really know and which Potter handled with a frivolity that was at least enviable.
"Harry, I know you," Ron said calmly, rubbing his hand soothingly over Harry's shoulder. "You just have to tell him how you feel. Be honest with him."
When Harry entered the Entrance Hall, he immediately saw Draco. He stood a little away from the hustle and bustle of the students, who went into the Great Hall to have a rather early dinner. He looked good. Of course he looked good. He even wore dark cloth trousers that looked very similar to the ones that Harry had tried on, but Draco wasn’t the type for jeans anyway, unlike Harry. Not that they didn’t suit him, he just didn’t wear them much. Harry thought that he was probably going crazy because thinking about Draco’s trousers was just strange.
I let go of him, backed away and moved my lips to utter words of apology. But no sound left my throat.
Harry is not sure why Draco also cannot bring himself to make the first move. Perhaps he has hoped that Draco would at least show curiosity about why he has been taken to an old house belonging to his mother's family, but if there is any interest there, he is bloody brilliant at not letting it show.
Completely stunned, Harry blinked quickly a few times, his jaw dropping before he gathered himself again and swallowed noisily. An unknown tingling sensation ran through his stomach area and gathered in his groin. Before he could say anything, Draco gave him a triumphant look.
Harry, the one who was to blame for all of this, forcing Draco to fetch ice cream in a Muggle shopping centre and completely abandoning him,
"Sounds like you've found your place in life," Neville says after Harry has finished his tales. "Who would have thought you wouldn't be bored living a life without adventure."
Harry still felt terribly empty, somewhere he had the feeling that he and Ron deserved Ginny's lecture. But all he really wanted right now was to go after Draco. When he had finally moved to rush off a few minutes ago, Theo had rigorously stopped him, and then Ginny had approached him and asked for an explanation. It was a complete disaster.
For a while, no one said anything. The chirping of the crickets and the sounds of the guitar filled the silence and made any tension bearable. Draco's gaze was lowered to the grass in front of him. He sat cross-legged, traced the shapes of the grass and the red petals of a poppy with his fingers and just listened to the music. He seemed composed, neither relaxed nor tense.
Well, twenty-five hours, as long as you do not count the three hours of sleep between four and seven o'clock, which she spent in a back room of the hospital's staff lounge.
Harry grimaced, but then nodded. He had to make a noticeable effort not to blush. Unlike Draco, he didn’t enjoy the bustle in any way. It was unpleasant at best and he didn’t want to know what his friends thought about all the speculations. Where were Ron and Hermione anyway? Should Harry just leave now? Oh, Merlin, he still had to think of a proper farewell. Fast!
Isaksen nods. "Mr Waters is pleading innocence, but that won't do much. Not in the position he's in."
Draco's gaze fell on Harry's crotch, Harry was sure his enthusiasm was more than evident, and then drifted back up to Harry's lips. A smile touched the corners of his bloody mouth and Draco began to fasten the high ponytail with a hair tie.
Now, he spends his time doing research. The house has been cleaned up to such an extent that Harry finds no point in wasting his time on tidying. Besides, there are several stacks of books waiting for him, which he has Hermione fetch for him. They all deal with breaking curses, but hardly any of them adequately grasp the situation Draco faces.
Harry took another small step forward and then, without breaking eye contact, grabbed the riding boot from Draco's hand. "Did the training go well anyway?"
"Hedwig is his dog," Weasley repeated, his eyes still fixed on Draco. Strange. Draco liked it far more when he was watched by
"You mean 'pardon'," Harry corrected and grinned at a perplexed Draco over his shoulder. "And I'd hurry up if I were you, Ron's probably brought a cake somewhere. You do like cake, don't you? You liked the chocolate muffin."
on his skin. It would have been absolutely impossible to suppress the moan that was leaving his throat.
The water was warm but not soporific. It was clear and Harry noticed for the first time that it smelled a tiny bit like lavender. But only so faint that it would not have been noticeable without attention. With a few skilful breaststrokes, he swam towards Draco and held on to the edge of the pool not far from him. In his memory, the pool had not been that deep.
My lips found Draco's. Caught the small hitch of Draco's breath, dipped into the movement with which Draco responded to my touch. Intrigued, our tongues invited each other to dance, got to know each other, became familiar. I tasted parchment, ink and the infinite feeling of freedom. A combination that was entirely foreign to my senses and that I could not get enough of.
"I was unable to figure out if fate is tied to morality," Malfoy replied, lost in thought. "Do people only fulfil their fate when they do good? Or is it possible for someone's fate to be committing atrocities? Does fate adhere to a moral code at all, or is it exempt from judgement?"
And then the blond separated from Harry and, breathing heavily, remained for a moment only millimetres away from Harry's lips. Harry almost didn’t dare to open his eyes but when he did, the most vivid grey that he had ever seen in his life awaited him.
Hearing him talk like that hurts, but Harry thinks he knows that this is where his perseverance is needed now. "What makes you different?" he inquires.
He sets him back down on the wheelchair as carefully as he lifted him. Draco almost topples over, which Harry manages to prevent by holding him by the shoulders, all the while looking into the half-open eyes that contain only the faintest hint of liveliness. "Not today, Draco."
"Then why was my help requested by the Aurors?" Harry asks, who once again finds the matter nothing but suspicious.
In this brief instant, there is nothing more important to Harry than that Draco knows that he wants to keep fighting for him. That Harry is dying to see him again. That Harry is the one who misses him. That Harry would not abandon him. Not any more. Those days are long gone.
Gently, Draco's loose fist wrapped around both of our erections, shifting his hips towards me while my senses were too blurred to capture every last feeling burning inside me.
Draco glanced towards the horizon where the first rays of sunlight fought the darkness and then looked back at Harry. Once he took a deep breath, he kneeled down, which Harry imitated instantly without separating their hands. “Ready?”
“I know, that’s why I kept reading. Sirens or nymphs are very similar to mermaids but do not fit your descriptions very well. After all, he did not try to kill you, which indicates that he isn’t a creature of the category
Surprised, Harry lifts his head and looks at Draco, who smooths down his trouser legs and pays Harry no attention. He is dressed in a colourful mixture of a pair of Harry's socks, an old pair of Ron's cloth trousers and a dark blue woollen jumper that Harry found in Sirius' old room. Apart from his diary, he has no belongings in this house.
, but a good-humoured, breakfasting Draco, who wore forbidden tight jodhpurs and on good days crossed his legs under the table, outdid any caffeine rush by far.
"Oh." That's all Harry can think of, wondering if that is Draco's only concern. "Thanks, I suppose? It's not like I need it particularly urgently."
Harry nodded, although he wasn’t sure why Draco had such a bossy commanding tone. He probably didn’t want to wake his bunkmates, but for that, he could just cast a Muffliato Charm over Draco’s bed. Why he should go to a chamber outside the dormitory didn’t make sense.
"Riding terminology," explained Neville, who passed Harry at walk with his pony. "Basically, you just have to change the direction. Go across the diagonal and you should end up tracking in the other direction." Harry gave Neville a quick grateful nod and then did what Draco had told him to do.
The woman’s voice was as clear as a bell, but something resonated in it that made Harry realise that she was indeed the waterspirit. Harry kept looking past her, wondering if he should offer her his T-shirt because he certainly couldn’t concentrate on her words. The situation was just too awkward.
“Promise me that you’ll return the ring to him at dawn and not use the power to harm anyone,” demanded Harry. He didn’t know how much ancient waterspirits bet on promises, but it was worth a try.
"If you come across an answer that quickly, sure," Jimar saves him with a grin on his lips. "But if the book is half as secretive as our patient over there, I think that's going to take a few more visits."
"He'll be reading. He always is at this hour," Jimar says, as an attempt to placate Harry. He rests a hand on his shoulder and shoves him closer to the window. Harry simply lets him.
Even though he didn't wear overly tight trousers, the room in his boxer shorts was limited to the bare minimum. The situation only became more critical when Draco closed a somewhat stiff hand around his semi-hard cock and ran his fingers along it. Harry moaned with relish anyway and immediately began to remove his trousers from his hips. It was more difficult than without an additional hand in it, but not impossible. At the moment, Harry didn't care anyway, because Draco's hand was steadily moving up and down the length of his penis, leaving him thinking of nothing else.
, vanity always wins – took Harry by the hand and then dragged him towards the shore. There seemed to be some truth to the decadence of the nobility after all.
Harry barely dared to look at Draco and when he did, Draco was staring at him completely thunderstruck, which in his form almost seemed funny. But Draco didn’t laugh, nor did Harry, who continued to look at him seriously and silently wondered why the Slytherin hadn’t thought of this himself. Ron had never mentioned it, but perhaps abstinence until marriage was common in traditional pure-blood families. But chastity should really have the lowest priority in Draco's situation.
Harry thought to himself and allowed himself a grin, coupled with a wink in Draco’s direction, who raised an eyebrow in surprise, but his smile grew only wider.
Where the concern for Draco's well-being came from, he couldn't quite pinpoint, but a single thought of last night wiped all the questions out of his mind and made him focus on the fact that he wanted Draco to be safe. He just needed a little confirmation that he was okay, that's all he wanted. For now.
With that, Draco bridged the distance between their mouths and led Harry in an urging kiss that started exactly where they had stopped in the lake. Surprised but not averse, Harry responded, pulled Draco at his waist closer and inhaled the vanilla aroma thirstily. Speech suddenly became very unimportant indeed.
Harry shoves his hands into the pockets of his robe and rocks uneasily on his feet as he avoids Ginny's gaze. "Something like that – listen, I'm not sure how much I'm even allowed to tell you about this."
"Don't," Myrtle wailed and I closed my eyes, rested my forehead against the stone door frame I had not moved from and gripped the door handle tighter. Quite as if I wanted to keep open the option of being able to close the door at any time.
, Draco admonished himself. Nothing more than stairs. Stairs that would snatch him and drag him off into an unknown world. Perhaps he would never return. Yes, for sure. The Muggles who had climbed this monster had simply disappeared. Vanished, never to be seen again. Surely their families were already worrying.
Aghast, Harry made a sound of protest and tossed one of his pillows in Ron's direction, which missed him and made the evil bastard laugh even louder. What a git! What did that even mean?
A smile lit up Draco’s eager face as he looked at his work with satisfaction and seemed to be highly pleased that Harry had stopped fighting back. The fact that the blond looked at most delightful with the red dot on his nose was just playing into Harry's hands. So he leaned forward, rubbed the tip of his own nose against Draco's and at the same time pulled the blond closer to him.
"It kind of is though. If you're the one who can help him," Ron says, sounding so incredibly relaxed that it infuriates Harry.
"Mmm, you too," Harry muttered, he could have simply fallen asleep here and now. Although, slowly but surely, it was getting chilly. Harry looked at Draco's relaxed face, this was an opportunity, wasn't it? "Draco?"
Draco smiled contentedly at his work, gave Harry a breathtaking smile, then lifted himself off Harry's thighs and crawled to Harry's eye level. His ponytail tickled Harry's cheek as Draco leaned down to him for a kiss that was far too short. Harry's hands found Draco's waist, stroked down to his thighs. Draco sighed at the touch, then reached between his legs for Harry's hard erection and brought it into position. One last glance found Harry, whose pulse took on unhealthy patterns. Holy shit, Draco was about to
Harry nodded a little too enthusiastically, bringing an amused smile to Draco's face. "Still, you should probably know I've never –" Harry broke off. A Blowjob or some fingerwork he already knew, but
The latter bent one of his legs, Harry's free hand immediately reached for the naked skin of his thigh and clung to it as if his life depended on it. He was sure Draco would bruise, but still, he was unable to loosen his grip. Draco's constant grinding movement didn't help the capacity of his brain in the slightest.
One might have thought they saw realisation in Draco's eyes for a split second, but the cool facade kept the upper hand. “You're wrong, Potter! The only thing I ask of you is to respect my existence and that you keep away from me. I had the expectation that this wasn't too much to ask, apparently I was wrong!”
Harry took the muffin, but only held it in his hand and sighed surrenderingly. "Can we… I don’t know,

On the search for Pup, Harry walks down the corridor of the third floor. It is an evening in the first week of February and neither Draco nor his cat has shown up for dinner. While Harry is not in a position to tell Draco to eat regular meals, to choose less refined sugar and more fruits and vegetables instead, or even to reduce his cigarette consumption, he certainly has this control over his pet.
Harry’s breathing slowed, but his heartbeat quickened. That sounded like a final decision and even though Harry could hardly contain his anger, he had to respect that for now. At least he’d have to try.
The success was undoubtedly the zenith of Hermione's career so far, which was why she had deservedly been celebrated by her entire family. When Fleur gave birth to a perfectly healthy Louis Weasley only a short time later, I had momentarily felt that the world was treating us far too well. I would never have complained about it, of course, but I had not been able to resist double-locking my front door and checking the protection spells.
Several times Harry sets about writing a letter to Gawain Robards, but he has no official reason yet to appeal the Ministry's decision. Officially, he does not know anything about the cancellation of the project yet and he does not want to get Jimar into trouble. His letters to Healer Isaksen also remain unwritten – he knows that even without his request, the Healer will do everything in her power to keep her patient alive.
Harry watched as three light-blond strands of hair came loose from Draco's ponytail in slow motion and fell into his face. Draco ignored the first two. The third he tucked behind his ear, then he lifted his head and returned Harry's gaze.
Draco brushes his hair out of his face and sighs softly. "I see my father when I look at myself in the mirror. His hatred, his resentment, his misery. If I cut my hair – I might not see him anymore."
Harry dropped his head, which was so incredibly heavy with thoughts, against a shelf behind him. It was late afternoon the next day and he was sitting in the library, patiently waiting for the person with whom he was to meet at any moment. But his date was delayed, so Harry reconsidered and pulled a wrinkled envelope out of his jeans to finally read it.
My hand caught his collar and pushed him back against the wall before I knew what I was doing. My hands were shaking with anger. "You're lying!" I lashed out at him. Everything in me
Draco sighed, ignoring the fact that Harry seemed to have no knowledge of sea creatures and that he had just mentioned Hermione. “Mermaid it is. Do you notice anything relevant about that word?” he asked further.
With Draco's name on his lips, Harry's body jerked helplessly, bolts of lightning shot through his veins, now for the second time and he slumped heavily breathing against Draco's body. Completely overwhelmed, he lay on Draco, inhaled the scent of vanilla, watched blond wisps of hair flutter under his breath and waited for his body to get used to reality again.
With quick steps, hidden under the invisibility cloak, Harry hurried through the Gryffindor common room, out into the corridors and towards the Grounds. Six days, then it was Draco’s birthday. Six days, then he’d just lose him. To the bloody
With his breath held, Harry sat still, didn’t move, just clenched his fingers into fists, hoping Draco wouldn’t turn whatever he was about to do into reality. But a tiny part of him was already begging for Draco not to stop and this tiny part gained more and more power with every inch that Draco’s fingers moved along his thigh.
Harry didn’t understand what was going on. The simple kiss turned into something else, even though he didn’t want to complain. Actually, they just didn’t have the time for a wild snogging session until it was clarified how they would proceed. Draco, who meanwhile sucked teasingly at Harry’s throat, seemed to see that quite differently.
A mischievous smile spread over Draco's mouth and spilt into his eyes. "Fine, mon amour. But only because you're hot when you get flustered."
"Somehow, I have a feeling the others know something we don't. I mean, everybody noticed the fight, but nobody even asked me about it. Not even Seamus wanted to know what happened! And Ginny just says I should ask Hermione about it," Ron continued uninhibitedly.
When Harry also raised his head, he noticed that the mirror on the ceiling had disappeared. He looked down and Draco's hair was short again. Still tousled, wisps of hair wet with sweat stuck to his cheekbones, but it was back to its usual length. "It looked good on you," Harry murmured and pushed the strands out of Draco's face. "But you always look good anyway."
Ron just nodded again. “Don’t worry, I’ve already taken care of the others. Just don’t come back tonight.”
Gasping, Harry arches his back and allows Draco to kiss him heatedly on the nape and neck, causing his blood to boil anew. Somewhere between the aftershocks of his orgasm and the rekindling lust, Harry manages to reach for his wand and whisper the spell for Draco, which also marks his consent.
“No, I thought I'd take advantage of the benefits of a pool and swim a lap,” Harry explained as he stepped closer to the pool.
We both looked down at our feet, not saying a word and accepting the moment for what it was. While Draco was presumably bidding farewell to his mother in his mind, I was thinking of my own. Of how people had always told me how much she had loved me and how happy and yet sad that fact had left me and still did today. Sad because she would never be able to know that I returned her love.
"We can't prove that the wand no longer exists, but we can show them that it doesn't make any difference whether one of them possesses it or not," Filly speaks as if explaining a battle plan. "Demonstration of power, Mr Potter. That's our cue. We no longer work our way from the outside in to get the most powerful of them in the end. We start at the core." He slams his fist down on the table, eyes gleaming, and Harry flinches.
Harry frowned and watched Draco's relaxed expression as he absent-mindedly reached for Draco's hand. "What if this someone lives too far away to meet them spontaneously?”
shorts. They sat loosely on his waist but were tight enough to perfectly accentuate the curve of his back and thighs. Draco had tucked a loose t-shirt into his waistband, which also emphasized his waist and sent Harry to heaven. Picking up his jaw from the floor, Harry stared at the blond with wide eyes. "Wow."
He waited. Waited for Draco's cries to die down, for their connection to fade, for Draco to return to reality and sink to his knees in Harry's arms.
Since this really sounded like a good plan to Harry, he put the invisibility cloak back on and made his way back to the castle. Straight to the fifth floor. Of course, he couldn't tell Draco about his plan – if this waterspirit wanted the ring so badly, Draco wouldn't just hand it over. The boy just had his priorities mixed up. Sometimes
The "no" is on the tip of Harry's tongue, but he cannot bring himself to say it. He has never thought about it that specifically, but confronted with it directly, it seems like the most logical thought in the world. He was the one who destroyed Draco's trust in the world and thus he is the one who contributed at least in part to why Draco's mind suffers relentlessly.
As soon as they broke apart, Draco lifted his head and looked around, a little disorientated. Merlin, was there anything more beautiful than the sight of a sleepy Draco? Probably not. Harry liked the contrast to the otherwise so composed and spruced up Draco. It gave him the feeling of knowing Draco more intimately than most others.
One question. All it took was one question. Meaning. Draco's words had so much more meaning. And Harry was sometimes naive and not self-reflective enough, but he
The next morning Harry woke up neither from unpleasant heat on his chest nor from annoying alarm beeps. Yawning and stretching, Harry looked around the small room. A few rays of sunlight fought their way through the gap in the curtain and illuminated the room, in Harry's bed lay a blurred white blob, Hedwig, he definitely had to stop her from sleeping in the bed. Harry fumbled for his glasses on Draco's bed stand, he lay in Draco's bed after all and then took a look at his phone display. It was a quarter to eight on July 31st. Harry put his phone aside again and concentrated completely on the body lying next to him in bed.
Draco looked at Harry again. Eyes wide, something indefinable in them, making Harry's heart go crazy. He was sure Draco would tell him about his past eventually. Not today, and rightly so. They had time, they would open the jam jars one by one. There was no need to rush things.
he was being watched, so it was no wonder he was willing to put on a little performance for Harry by taking extra time to strip his trousers off his legs, making sure Harry had the best view. Harrys stared with big eyes at the black fabric of the tight boxer shorts, or rather at what had to be hidden
For half a second Harry stared into the blackness, then jumped up as if stung by an adder and took to his heels like never before, almost forgetting to pick up his invisibility cloak and wand. He grabbed his things and hurried down the path that led him straight back to the castle.
Harry is about to protest, but Luna laughs and thus cuts him off. "Ginny always likes to talk about how you –"
The heavy feeling in my chest pressed uncomfortably against my lungs. I could guess what this meant. First, it meant that I would have to fight for more diary visits, which I was all too easily content with. But Draco's words also proved that sooner or later I would have to choose. Between this and saving Malfoy.
Still invisible, Harry slowly approached the apparently sleeping Draco, kneeled down barely a meter away from him and looked at him closely for the first time. Although in this position he could only study the blond's back, this was more than Harry could’ve expected. Light scars were scattered across Draco's back and upper arms, Harry suspected knowing where these scars came from but shook off his guilt and instead started to examine Draco's hands. He had webs between his fingers, their colour hardly contrasting with Draco's skin colour, so that their paleness made them almost inconspicuous. Despite the webs, Draco wore a small silver ring on which a small snake was depicted. The fingernails looked almost claw-like, sharp and tapered at the end.
Draco nodded slightly but kept his eyes closed. "Yes, I do think that. And I consider myself quite imprudent."
Their lips met instantly and adopted a slow rhythm. Draco tasted of forest and sun, Harry sighed liberated. His hands grasped Draco's hips, Draco's fingers crossed behind his neck. Without interrupting the kiss, Draco pulled him onto the sofa. Harry didn't let go of Draco's hips, bent over the blond, shoved one hand in Draco's hair to deepen the kiss.
“Along with the fact that I haven't started anything, you're acting absolutely childish!” Draco replied dryly, devoting his entire attention to his fingernails again.
"I'm sorry," the words fell from my lips and I wished I could have taken them back. I knew how Malfoy felt and such a crude statement did not make it any better. "She loved you very much."
Harry knows what Robards is getting at and finally raises the question that has been on the tip of his tongue since his first conversation with Filly. "How would Malfoy know all these names and cases? His father certainly knew more than enough about them, if he wasn't even involved – But Malfoy? He was just a child at the time, wasn't he?"
way, but Harry wasn’t brilliant either. The chaos began when he tethered the pony because Harry didn't want to get the right knot, then he didn't comb properly, but against the direction of coat growth, then he placed the saddle the wrong way around on the horse's back, although Draco had shown him how to do it properly. All in all, it went quite catastrophically.
Gingerly, I reached for them, pulled them onto my chest and intertwined them there with my fingers. Now it was my turn to face the ceiling and close my eyes. I listened silently to Draco's steady breathing close to my ear and pieced together one puzzle piece after another until I believed I was able to visualise Draco in front of me.
“You gotta get up, Harry!” As he spoke, Ron pulled on Harry’s blanket, which Harry only gripped tighter and pulled over his head. It wasn’t supposed to be morning already, it wasn’t supposed to be real, why the hell hadn’t he dreamt that?
vague?” Harry inquired boldly. He was trying to be helpful after all and that was dependent on Draco's cooperation.
"Harry, please, I don’t want to –" The rest of the sentence disappeared in a choked breath and Draco's body tensed. It felt as if time stopped, even the crackling of the rain Harry couldn't hear for that moment. All he saw was Draco, eyes closed in bliss, a fine crease between his eyebrows and the hint of a smile on his slightly parted lips.
“Sod off, Weasley!” Harry grumbled and dropped his head on the tabletop in front of him. Perhaps his bed was indeed more attractive than Draco Malfoy.
Draco's memories flew past him, flashed up, faded. It was almost too fast, but Harry knew Draco was searching. This place, it was supposed to help him find it.
But whatever the curse truly meant, Draco didn't seem to want a woman, not in his bed and not as his true love, so Harry would respect that, of course. He could imagine that Draco had thought about this long and hard, as he always did. And he definitely wasn’t the type to make reckless decisions. His urge to survive had already been proven in their sixth year of school, so he had to be really serious about his decision.
to seem annoyed. He entered the riding arena without further ado and caught up with Hetja and Harry without any trouble.
Draco calmed our frantic movements, burying his hands in my hair, looking at me, lips millimetres from mine, granting us something I had never learnt to appreciate enough: time.
"How about a book?" Harry suggests, whilst getting to his feet and walking over to the bookshelf that Hermione is mainly responsible for stocking.
Draco sighed, squeezed Harry's hand gently and walked a little faster, probably to catch up with the others, to avoid the subject. "No, I wouldn't. Not if it's something serious."
Kneeling between Draco’s spread legs, Harry allowed himself a moment to look at the blond man’s naked body, then bent over Draco, kissed his neck again and hoped for some kind of confirmation that he was allowed to continue. When Draco didn’t move, just sighed comfortably, Harry let a finger wander through Draco’s crack, up to his entrance and didn’t ask to be let in before he pushed in. Draco’s wheezing was frantic and Harry just knew he was nervous, so he gently smoothed along Draco’s waist.
Harry draws a small mark on the pocket calendar that sits in front of him on the counter, next to the old cash register. He has been marking the dates since he received the first postcard with the skyline of Seoul on it, exactly one year ago. He would never have expected it then, his own life had just begun to shift when it suddenly appeared on his kitchen table in his small attic flat.
Harry gave Draco a quick glance, but he was seemingly focused on Flitwick and even nodded now and then as if he was actually listening intently. Harry was just thinking about putting his hand on Draco’s when he felt fingers moving along his leg. Slowly but surely towards his crotch.
But this was certainly not the eye-opening experience Harry had expected, which is why he widened his eyes and looked at the clearly stressed Draco in horror. “Wait
if he liked it. The kiss isn’t really the problem either,” Harry explained to her. He knew that it was finally time to come out with the whole truth. His emotions were running high. Hogwarts’ entire attention on his shoulders was not what he needed right now.
"All right, whatever," Harry agreed, even though the unpleasant feeling of making a mistake with this didn’t leave him.
“Freckled strawberry,” Harry whispered as soon as he stooped at the fourth door of the corridor. Instantly the door opened silently. Harry exhaled with relief. The password didn't seem to change too often.
With quick steps, I rushed along the sparsely lit corridor, made my way into another and found myself at its mouth at a spiral staircase. The room was circular, with two round-arched windows providing a view of the grounds. On one of the window sills Malfoy sat with his legs propped up, his gaze focused indeterminately into the distance.
"That's nothing. And yet I wanted to comply even after the very first time," he breathed. "I was weak."
," hissed Draco, before Pansy had a chance to answer. Draco glared briefly in her direction, Pansy looked almost apologetic, sealed her lips and looked over to Ron and Hermione. Ron just raised his hands, murmured a "never asked" and then teased Ginny about her old diary.
Harry groaned desperately and pulled his blanket back over his head. “It’s too complicated to explain anyway. The point is, I really need to lay low, I wouldn’t survive if I ran into him this morning.”
This one was furnished in a much more modern style, the colour white even dominated the gold. In the kitchen were cupboards without handles that worked with touch sensors (Harry didn't even wonder why that was necessary), the light went on and off when it was told to and the sofas looked uncomfortable but very expensive. So the east wing fulfilled all the clichés about how bourgeois people with too much money lived.
Harry turned into a small path, called for Hedwig and let Hetja walk the last few meters on long reins. The forest thinned out, the sun's rays and the high deciduous trees reflected in the lake water. The crickets chirped loudly, the birds sang unknown melodies, it smelled of grass and dew. A raven-black pony neighed and Harry felt nothing but relief.
"What we have just sort of happened. I'm not going to lie, Ron came up with the bet because he knew that I'd... I don't know... that I'd like you? He's known me longer than most, and he wasn't wrong, obviously. Draco, the bet didn't motivate me to... initiate this between us."
After just a few memories, I had realised that Malfoy's childhood had been, in some ways, exactly as I had always imagined. The cold love of his parents, the constant contrast between false approval and strict exclusion, and the naturalness of thinking of oneself as superior – all this had moulded him to be the boy who had been ranting about Hufflepuffs when we first met.
Draco snorted, interlocking his fingers behind Harry’s neck and stroking his thumb along Harry’s hairline, giving him tingling goosebumps. “You stubborn git!”
Every morning, Harry shuffles out of bed, stretches as he peeks out the window at the sparsely frequented Lilypad Avenue and internally forecasts the weather. The avenue provides him with a sense of rurality, even though he lives in the heart of London, and also his forecasts usually prove to be true. When in doubt, guessing drizzle always pays off.
Harry’s fingers moved in circles, making their way towards Draco’s wrist and further onto the back of his hand. Harry didn’t dare to go any further. He could’ve coped with the webs, but the claw-like fingernails looked as if they could cut Harry’s throat with a single movement. A
She has only confided in her husband Nicholas, who teaches psychology at the University of London. He is firmly convinced that Anja can recognise the state of the human psyche and that the colours reflect it, but that is impossible. Therefore Anja keeps quiet about it. She has fought too hard for her career to suddenly be labelled insane.
Harry looks into Draco's pale face and the hint of a smile settles on his lips. Draco takes Harry's wand from the lemon-coloured tablecloth and thoughtfully looks at the way it rests in his loose fist. He seems to grasp the basics of what is unfolding here, but the extent of it is yet to dawn on them all.
"I thought ..." Parkinson stammered, but broke off again, buried her head in her arms and heaved another dry sob. "I'm disgusting."
The two of them were sitting just a bit away in the green and were talking quietly. They tried not to disturb Harry and still listen to his strumming. Harry didn’t mind their company. Instead, he finally took the time to think.
What if Draco backed out? Harry should have expected the cowardly tendencies, it would certainly not be surprising. Draco liked to pretend he was rebellious, but actually, he preferred to avoid
“Well, I am increasingly subject to their needs and instincts. At the same time, however, everything in me resists. That’s why…” Draco paused and Harry opened his eyes to look at him.
Blaise knew this was about Draco. Of course, he knew. Harry sighed, his fingers stopped and the melody faded into silence, only the crackling of the campfire and the conversations of the others filled the air. It was Harry's decision. He had to decide whether or not he wanted to hurt Draco. Trust and truth against guilt and vulnerability, Harry realised how much he detested decisions.
. You’re destined to save him, and even though it’ll most likely have to be through sex, it doesn’t mean you have to find him more attractive than necessary.” Hermione looked at Harry seriously and seemed as if she wanted to give him some important advice.
The fire of the torches cast shadows on the stone walls and wooden door behind me and bathed the corridor in an eerie atmosphere. Once again, it did not feel right to be here. Only this time, the feeling resembled the one I had had when I roamed around after curfew wearing my Invisibility Cloak. My stomach tingled, the thrill claiming me whole.
said it was the right decision to give Draco and him a chance, but his mind told him at great length that Draco certainly wasn’t into Harry, otherwise, he wouldn’t insist on his own restraint and fight against his natural instincts. He was about to make a complete fool of himself. Harry ignored his mind, as he did quite often.
," slipped out of Harry’s mouth and he reflexively grabbed Draco's waist. The blond only laughed and spurred Katla to walk faster. Harry was now clinging more to Draco than just holding on. He crossed his forearms in front of Draco's stomach. This was bound to fail, one too fast movement and Harry would simply pull them both into the abyss.
Harry wanted Draco to know that Harry was serious about his feelings. But he didn't want the risk. He didn't want to open himself up just to be rejected. Still, he knew Ron wasn't wrong. Clearing the air was probably the last chance he had to set things right. Why did this have to be so complicated? Why couldn't Draco just
Ron and Hermione looked at him as if Harry had just told them he was a squib and had no more than a few bad card tricks up his sleeve. “Wait, you’re implying with this curse part that you are Malfoy’s ’saviour’, but the saviour is recognisable by the fact that he does
said Draco, the inner turmoil of the Slytherin noticeable to Harry. Nevertheless, Draco's tip-off did not help him.
“You know, frankly, I'm pretty desperate!” Harry replied truthfully. He certainly wouldn't give up on this.
"No," Harry instantly said, Draco just raised an unbelieving eyebrow. Damn it, why did the bastard need to know him so well? Harry groaned quietly and dropped his forehead against Draco's chest where he whispered a barely audible "yes".
in the impenetrable grey, something else besides grief and compassion. And there it was. In perfect contradiction, Harry found a glimmer of hope glistening in the cloudy grey.
For the past few days, numerous patients have been admitted to the hospital with undiagnosable curse symptoms. Most affected are Aurors and wixen who engage in open duels with dark wizards. The consequences are always the same: slow organ failure leading to death. In the last week alone, three people have already succumbed to the unknown curse – Healers and Curse-Breakers alike are working together to find a solution.
It is a strange feeling to feel someone's magic so close to one's own when being so certain of being loathed by that person. It is akin to a declaration of trust without trust, a confession of love without love, or a sheltered home without a sense of home.
Harry’s heartbeat instantly increased its rhythm, while his skin started to tingle. He’d done it. He’d convinced Draco. And nobody had died or collapsed in tears, no, they had just talked. Like adults who were aware of their responsibilities. It was amazingly pleasant to act like an adult as long as he got what he wanted.
Mrs Longbottom was a friendly middle-aged woman with brown hair and a round face. As the owner of Weeping Willow Farmstead, she personally looked after new guests, including Harry and Ron. Ginny had already spent two weeks of her summer holidays here last year and had managed, God knows how to sign up her brother and his best friend for this year as well.
Harry didn't have a lot of experience with "infatuation", but the experience he had only confirmed him. It was perfectly all right for him to find people attractive. It was all right to find
But Seamus and Dean already burst out laughing, the others joined no less enthusiastically. Harry bit his tongue hard so as not to laugh along. The containing apparently didn't work perfectly, Draco glared at him angrily with red cheeks. Harry grinned innocently and continued to pet Draco's hair.
Ron nods flatly. "Yes. He's agreed to use it, so we better give him some time." He glances at the wall clock. "We can wait, or we can leave, Harry. Whatever suits you."
"No, that's... Okay. Hedwig's all right now. They discharged her. There are some theories, but they can't say exactly what triggered the seizure. Maybe she's just old."
The smell of lavender clouded his senses and he forgot where he was. He eagerly pulled the blond even tighter, grabbed the silky hair unyieldingly, didn’t let go, didn’t let either of them even take a breath. The hard bulge against his hip only spurred him on and he pressed his own hip against Draco’s, who gasped in surprise. Harry caught the gasp with his lips and smiled lightly into the kiss. Oh yes, he wouldn’t be served tonight – no, he would kiss Draco, touch him, take him to hell and heaven.
, Draco was simply pessimistic, Harry was sure of that. And slowly, he was getting annoyed too; instead of just being grateful to Harry, he was, once again, willfully obstructive. “You know, maybe I’m not the one thinking too little! Maybe you’re just an uncooperative mermaiden!” Shit, that was his
So instead of running after Draco, Harry took Neville to the nearby bathroom, sat him down in front of the loo and leaned against the door frame, blocking out the sound of Neville emptying his stomach as best as he could. Harry was angry with himself; he hadn’t minded at all when Draco had looked after Neville, but that Viktor bloke... Harry clenched his hands into fists and concentrated on slow and steady breaths.
So it comes as no surprise to Harry that the walk to Auror Headquarters still feels the same as it did when he faced the first day of his Auror training or the very first time he set foot in the Ministry's tremendous halls.
"That took an embarrassingly long time, darling," Draco smiled and pushed Harry's hands away from his body as he rose from Harry's lap to crawl onto the bed as well.
“I will help you,” Harry said. Sure, in this, the chivalry of the Gryffindors triumphed. This was certainly not something he could or would leave the Slytherin alone with. Moreover, the new need in Harry, which he had previously only acknowledged, crystallized into something definable. The need involved helping Draco, even protecting him, and even though Harry couldn't explain where this feeling had come from so suddenly, he quietly accepted it. He would help Draco, he made this promise to him, whether Draco wanted him to or not.
"Hmm," Harry returned with little eloquence, then suddenly he smiled. "Did you know he speaks French to make himself seem more extravagant? A while ago he said pommes de terre purée instead of mashed potatoes, I almost –"
Furthermore, in the first week of August, Hermione had finally experienced a breakthrough in her case. After countless overtime-filled days in which she and her team had searched frantically for a counter curse, they had initially only discovered ways and means to slow down the dying process of the patients. Although this had not saved any lives, it had bought the hospital's Curse-Breakers more time.
how he thinks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find Mrs Longbottom before my father does." As he spoke, Draco rose and moved the chair to the table. "I hope you have some knowledge of fences, Potter. Meet me at the back entrance in ten minutes." And with that, Draco turned on his heel and hurried with giant strides to the door of the dining hall.
Nothing is of importance anymore. Neither hope nor doubt. Neither past nor future. Neither patience nor restlessness. Only the here and now, the togetherness and their intimacy seem of significance.
Harry exhaled audibly, closed his eyes and did what he knew best. He put the emotions into a jam jar, closed it tightly and stored it safely, with all the other memories and emotions that exposed him to others. The time wasn't right yet, there was still too much at stake. He would return to them, to those feelings for Draco. Just not
It was still dark, only a narrow bright stripe on the horizon indicated that the sun would soon rise, but now the Great Lake was still dark and scary in front of them. The calm surface of the water didn’t give any indication of the cruel and beautiful creatures that lived hidden in it. As if veiled under a dome, the water protected them from life on land. Maybe the water also protected life on land from life in the water.
"She told me to ask myself why I was doing all this, so I left. I was so... disgusted with myself, with my choices. I – I let my body be used. For an obnoxious bet. And what did it get me? It cost me a friendship and my world view of the time."
Harry hastily shoves the stone into his trouser pocket, does not take the time to ponder how it could have ended up here and takes another searching look inside the living room. It looks as if someone has forced their way into the flat and is now manically ransacking every inch of it for valuables.
Harry didn't think of complaining, instead, he glanced spellbound at Draco, who nimbly slipped his fingers under the hem of his shirt and pulled the fabric off his body. Harry couldn't see the picture in focus but he was able to picture it in more detail than anything else. The sight of the pale torso sent adrenaline rushing through Harry's body. A wave of lust followed it straight away as Draco took the jodhpurs off his legs. Oh, hell! Even when Draco didn’t take his time and offered Harry no performance, Harry felt enchanted. Bare skin always did its effect, as Harry could tell by looking down at himself.
Everything inside Harry refuses to simply state why he is here in this strained atmosphere, but he cannot think of a single thing that could appease Malfoy. It had never been necessary during his diary visits. Possibly it is easier to handle it like ripping off a band-aid. Short and sweet, though the pain is arguably unavoidable with such news.
The corners of Draco's mouth twitched in amusement. "That much can be understood. Does that mean you're not interested in activities that fall into the BDSM category?"
Draco beamed happily at him, he dropped the book beside the bed and shoved one hand in hopelessly unruly, dark hair. "I told you you have a beautiful cock." Harry shook his head but had to bite his tongue to keep from laughing.
"You heard me. And now –“ Draco pushed Harry off and sat up at the same time. "I want to be on top. The hay nearly
Draco saw him immediately but, like Harry, spared any word of greeting. He just straightened a bit at the edge of the pool and watched Harry, who stepped towards him a bit hesitantly and then sat down cross-legged not a meter away. Harry couldn’t read in Draco’s eyes whether he was happy about his visit or not, but he was glad that Draco made no comment about the past few days.
It had taken months to find out which memory had triggered this chain reaction. And just as long to prepare this night, to reawaken the memory, to undo everything.
"There is reason to believe he was acting as an informant for Viper," Isaksen interrupts him with a warning tone.
"You know they won't let us check what curse it could be?" Hermione asks, tilting her head a little. "Some sort of guideline because he was in Azkaban. If any other Healer had taken care of him he'd probably be dead by now or on his way straight there."
Harry's hand and breath slowed, followed by a pleasant sigh, and he sucked a mark on Draco's neck. He was, bloody hell,
“You might fall for me if you spend enough time with me in this form,” Draco replied, and had Harry looked up, he would have seen the smug smile on Draco’s rosy lips, sharp canines peaking out just so.
to whom nothing, not even sex, was more important than his ambition. "Ron’s doing that for me today," Harry replied, continuing the kisses on Draco's neck.
Harry gnawed at his lower lip. He had understood why Draco had kept his distance last night. If Draco had only felt half of the emotion Harry had experienced when they kissed, then that was an understandable reaction. Distance was good for sorting oneself out. For reflecting. For getting things straight. And for letting this complete overstimulation cool down.
"Potter, you're acting utterly deranged," Malfoy's voice informed me, sounding a whole lot more in control despite the accusation. "Calm down and then we can talk about everything. It's all –"
"Exactly. Ginny's right. The competition is all for fun and not to put you under pressure," Mrs Longbottom confirmed Ginny's words, smiling encouragingly at Harry and Ron.
“Perhaps I should agree to free you from your misery, even if you owe this torment to your own intuition,” Draco thought aloud, reached for Harry’s hand on his face and intertwined their fingers. The passing students who glanced curiously at them had never been so unimportant.
Ron sighs in relief. "Thank Merlin. I was bloody close to just setting fire to everything on my desk. Although, it’s not like that would be noticeable with all the commotion."
Harry gently sucked on Draco's lower lip, the blond moaned softly, gripped Harry's hair more firmly and opened his mouth willingly for Harry. Harry's tongue found its way too easily into Draco's mouth, explored the space too naturally and elicited thrilling sounds. It was stimulating to know that it was
Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince quickly becomes Draco's favourite, something Harry has anticipated. He consistently chooses books that he finds too sophisticated to read on his own, and they take their time going through them line by line, pondering the meaning behind Goethe's, Kafka's and Homer's words. Harry may doubt the veracity of their theories, but Draco's conviction and genuine interest in the written words lead him to keep this fact to himself.
Harry absently reached for Draco's hand as he answered. "When she was about 10 years old, Ginny was madly in love with me. She always turned bright red whenever I went to visit Ron and gave me strange nicknames in her diar–"
Draco raised his head, straightened up, ran a finger gently down Harry’s cheek while he looked at him with a mild smile. A sight that made Harry’s heart bleed. “Optimism looks sexy on you,” Draco whispered before he placed his lips on Harry’s again, and this time for longer, not caring if anyone was watching them or not. Snitches flew in Harry’s stomach, while his brain forgot what its function was.
Harry grinned amusedly, gaze roaming over Draco’s face for a brief in-depth look, which he regretted immediately. Now he didn't want to look away anymore. The glowing skin, the shining eyes, the scattered scales, the gills on his neck, it was all worth at least two looks. Wrestling with himself, Harry turned his gaze back to the book and concentrated on collecting his thoughts.
Harry's everyday life is routinised and geared towards not allowing any unwanted thoughts to enter his mind. The last week has been upsetting enough, Harry has carelessly just allowed Malfoy to nestle in his thoughts. He does not make the mistake a second time, listens to Shostakovich, Vivaldi and Beethoven as he always does when he needs to find himself.
The straps hugged Draco's pale skin, not cutting into it unless Harry pulled on them. When he did that, the strap dipped into soft flesh and each time he let go again and slid his fingers under the strap to massage the tortured area, Draco sighed into the kiss as if there was nothing more soothing. Harry traced the lace, grasped a strap on Draco's thigh, tugged at it and carelessly let it whip back onto Draco's leg.
Harry does not know if he should believe that Malfoy's survival instinct is returning. He is not yet able to assess the wizard, but even a blind observer would recognise that Malfoy is not in a stable mental state.
"Wait, I need to show you the video of my last training session. It’s going to blow your mind! You don’t mind, do you?" Viktor asked Harry, not expecting an answer, then grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him along. Draco was clearly too surprised to resist but threw Harry an apologetic look over his shoulder before disappearing into the lounge.
Draco frowned, some uncertainty still resonated in his gaze, but he didn’t pull his hand away. "I just thought... I don't even know –" He broke off, cleared his throat and started again. "We never talked about our sexuality."
She has dedicated her life to the magical art of healing, leaving her family behind in Norway and building a new life for herself in England. Healing is in her blood, as magic is in many others. She was gifted with both at birth. Her parents are both Muggles and she is the only one of three sisters with magical abilities. She grew up in a small town called Elverum, northeast of Oslo, situated by the river Glomma, embedded in Østerdal, secluded from any idea that magic is something that exists. But every blessing also contains a curse. Anja's curse is her talent and her success, for which she endured many years of loneliness.
timing to draw his attention to the fact that he was constantly being watched by Harry and, in his opinion, was behaving strangely. This could
"I should be surprised and yet I'm not at all," I heard a voice all too familiar and jerked my head up. In front of me, leaning against the side of the glass cabinet with his arms folded across his chest, stood Malfoy, eyeing me with a raised eyebrow. "Welcome back, Potter."
"It's the usual stuff. You almost get thrown in prison for a crime you didn't commit and then your fiancée turns out to be a manipulative criminal. Just another Friday in my life," Jimar tells them jokingly as he starts clearing his personal belongings out of the office drawers and stowing them in a bag he brought with him.
," a voice behind Harry spoke and he immediately felt all the tension ease. "I brought you a muffin. The background noise might suck, but this is the best shit I've ever eaten!"
It didn’t really change much for Harry if he was honest. Yes, he now knew where this need to protect Draco came from and he also knew that he had to be the one to do
That was simply dragon crap! Of course, the Slytherin behaved differently. Ever since he had told Harry about his preference for men, come to think of it. Or was it just Harry? Draco and he had always been very straightforward, certain allusions had often been made. Merlin, he’d even chosen
“What just happened?” he asked because he couldn’t think of anything better to say. He didn’t let go of Draco.
His memories revealed how doggedly he had sought the forgiveness of others, even after he had returned home from his travels. It had started with his willing compliance with all the demands of the Ministry. He had even participated in the search for his father – well, at least he had fulfilled his duty and had made an effort to get in touch with him under strict supervision. The lack of success, however, had not saddened Malfoy much.
“You don’t seem to have experienced yourself as angry yet,” Draco replied, approaching Harry again and stopping in front of him smiling smugly. “But apart from that, who said I thought you were a sadist, not a masochist?”
Breathing heavily, Harry pulled away, grabbed Draco's wrists and held them above his head, in a loose grip. Draco's eyes widened, his cheeks flushed. Harry placed a gentle kiss on Draco's forehead and studied him closely for a moment before he started to speak. "Okay?"
Draco’s moans as Harry grabbed the blond by the hip and pulled him closer only spurred him on. He let one hand slide under Draco’s waistband onto his butt and grabbed it bravely. How long had he imagined being able to do this? Since the enchanting sight that night, Draco’s buttocks hadn’t left his thoughts and now he could finally touch it!
developed within me.” Harry paused for a moment, but when Ron didn't answer, he continued. “It's this strange need to want to help him and somehow I can't help myself. I don’t even want to fight it!”
"Am I wrong or am I not the only one who disregards his letters?" Draco asks, turning a page of his book. "What are you running from, Potter?"
In the end, he realises that he trusts Malfoy far too much to believe him capable of creating a Horcrux.
Before Harry could stay rooted to the spot for too long, he remembered where he was and, careful to avoid all glances, went to his two best friends at the Gryffindor table, where he was eagerly awaited. For Harry’s sake, the two of them had sat down a bit away from the other students and bombarded him with questioning glances as soon as he sat down opposite them. Harry only just noticed that he was really hungry and immediately started to load his plate with food.
Lucy immediately nods and sets to her task, while Healer Isaksen directs an irritated Harry to follow her.
it!" Hermione interrupts him, beaming alternately at the three wizards in the room. "The second I saw you use Harry's wand, it dawned on me!"
Draco hummed approvingly, then shifted his hips forward so Harry could slide out of him. Harry didn't miss the way Draco's eyes rolled back, he gasped softly and his cock twitched awakened in Harry's loose fist. Harry fumbled for his wand somewhere behind him, Draco beat him to it and with a flick of his wand, all bodily fluids disappeared.
Draco snorted in anger. “No, that’s impossible. My charm has no effect on you, you are –” Draco paused with that as if he had already said too much.
In a corner, right next to the small podium, where musical instruments perform Harry's favourite songs all by themselves and only with the help of magic, there is a crimson sofa, a favourite spot for many of the customers. Especially the children, who love to visit Harry at work, enjoy sitting on it and listening to concerts played by the floating guitar, accompanied by piano or drums.
"Sometimes," Draco tried again, turned away and swallowed. "Sometimes, I take my chagrin out on the wrong people. I know now that it's wrong. I didn't always know... Granger is –"
Harry's ordinary life does not fall by the wayside either. As the holidays loom, so does the strain on all the shops in Diagon Alley, which Harry tries to mitigate with a sobering amount of Brahms’ works. George cracks fewer jokes, Angelina helps out more often and little Fred is regularly sent to visit his grandparents. Nellie is in a worse mood than usual, only Aurora is utterly her jolly self and dreams of a white Christmas.
For a brief moment, Harry thinks he will not get to hear any more but eventually it pays off to wait in silence for a few seconds longer.
Harry couldn’t even finish the sentence in his head. He saw stars dancing in front of him, his body tensed up and relaxed again as he came in Draco’s mouth.
“Mr Malfoy, I would be much obliged if you would not distract Mr Potter any further from his lessons. Five points off, for the both of you!” McGonagall interrupted Harry's thoughts. Harry made a decision at the same moment. A decision he would probably soon regret.
thighs and sweet cheeks looked temptingly delicious. Harry's fingers dug into a pale thigh, Harry's lips found Draco's tailbone, his blood threatened to boil over.
"Whatever you're implying, consider it confirmed," Draco replied, sinking back into the green. Harry snorted and spared himself the comment that this had actually been Draco's idea. Instead, he took the tools and walked a few steps to the position of the first post.
to turn Draco into a normally functioning human being again. And the quickest way to do that was to break the curse. Finally, his mind was in agreement with his
"We'll worry about that when we find it." For that is the actual problem with Hermione's realisation. The memories surrounding the wand's whereabouts are impenetrable, like dark fog denying him access. For the last two days, Harry has done nothing but jot down pages and pages of memory fragments and string them together in an attempt to reach a logical conclusion. So far, every attempt has been unsuccessful.
"You've reached the first stage," Hermione states gently but factually. "Your body temperature is below thirty-five degrees. Tell me as soon as you first feel pain."
“That wouldn’t fit Draco’s case, would it?” asked Harry, watching his best friend flip through the pages.
"I don't know." Luna thoughtfully brushes one of the long blonde locks behind her ear, where little carrot figurines dangle from the lobes. "I think it's good for all of us to talk about the past with someone who knows how to handle it. And if that makes you too uncomfortable, then I'm sure you can get in touch with Dean or Seamus."
"We support you in all your decisions," Ron adds firmly. "But we want you to be completely sure of the risk you're taking."
Malfoy has already agreed after Healer Isaksen had a long talk with him, but it feels wrong not to ask Malfoy's permission one more time. He has made too many mistakes in the past when dealing with Malfoy, he wants to avoid putting his foot in his mouth once again.
But it worked. Seamus just shouted “nobody here’s surprised anyway" and dunked a surprised Dean underwater. Almost instantly, Draco and Harry were once again secondary, leaving Harry exhaling with relief. His gaze fell on Draco's lips again, which didn’t go unnoticed.
The shop is busy, a new collection of wizarding joke articles that George has been working on for months is nearing completion and keeping all the staff on their toes. Normally Harry dislikes the added stress of his workplace, but this week he gratefully accepts the distraction.
Hermione reaches over the covers for Ron's hand, but keeps her eyes on Harry. "What will you know better, Harry?"
“Oh, don't worry, I already regret my selfless decision every passing second!” Draco growled, glaring at Harry.
It is due to Harry's unquenchable Tuesday enthusiasm that he immediately marks the date in his calendar. He has not left the shelter of his flat since the last week of August, except to go about his daily routine. He is not ready for more. He prefers to spend his free time listening to the soft sounds of great composers and withdrawing into his own mind.
Draco pushed open the room door, let go of Harry's hand and turned to him as Harry closed the door behind them. "I don't care, I don't want to win anymore."
"But if it's important to you, then I can ask around at the Ministry whether something can be done with applications to guarantee further access. But of course, St Mungo’s has to play along with that," Ron thinks aloud. "Your name isn't completely worthless, I'm sure something can be worked out."
Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck, clenched his fist and took a deep breath before continuing.
"Then don't forget to take them off before you dive into the water," Draco replied and then he gave Harry a sugar-sweet smile. "If you don’t exert yourself, I will put horse manure in your bed."
Harry hadn't told Draco about his scar because he felt he owed it to him. He'd done it because he wanted Draco to be able to see everything he was. So he knew who Harry truly was. Because he wanted Draco to like him for everything he was and everything that was part of him. Perhaps Draco had told his story for the same reasons.
Draco excused himself to bring Feykir back to his stall and left them alone. Lupin crouched down next to Hedwig, routinely inquired about previous illnesses and the nature of the seizure, Harry answered the questions to the best of his ability. Meanwhile, Lupin took a closer look at the dog, after a few minutes he sighed and got up again.
"The 'just' is debatable, but yes. It's me," Harry replies, trying to properly assess the scene before him.
Harry recognises the names from his training days, but they do not tell him much anymore. What Grindelwald's followers might have to do with the Malfoys, he does not even want to know. These are times that seem too distant to him. So he just nods resignedly and takes Robards' body language as a sign to end the conversation. His extended lunch break will soon be over anyway.
The young Malfoy giggled happily, called out "Mummy, look", while directly facing me and opening his extended fist. The glittering something took advantage of its newfound freedom and promptly flew away. Malfoy's laughter grew louder, he clapped his hands and I had to force the corners of my mouth not to lift.
Harry’s face had probably taken on the colour of a tomato and he must have looked pretty rattled because Flitwick seemed almost worried. “Mr Potter, you look feverish!” he noted thoughtfully.
, it was only understandable that combing a pony suddenly mutated into the most fascinating activity on the planet. As long as Draco was doing it,
Loud, somewhat too regular breaths tore Harry from his thoughts. He paused, stopped with his strokes, but Draco didn’t move, just lay there quietly. Harry held his breath excitedly. Draco had fallen asleep and this was Harry’s opportunity to carry out his secret plan. If he quickly took the ring now, Draco wouldn’t even notice and by the next morning, it would be back where it should be.
About an hour later they were back on the courtyard. Mrs Longbottom was busy with the Pony-Olympics and limited her lecture to demanding that they have a serious talk later. Neville and Blaise had insisted on helping Mr Longbottom with the search, but now they were eager to attend the event and went to the stables to get their horses ready. Hedwig followed them tail-wagging and merely gave Harry the cold shoulder.
that it’s not that simple. I was born with this curse, all my life I’ve been able to prepare for this day, what you’re about to do is a mere displacement act. You’d be risking
Horse-riding holidays. For two weeks. Even though Harry was clueless when it came to horses. Well, that was bound to be fun.
" and Harry scratched the back of his head sheepishly. Hermione and Ron were to go with them and keep an eye on them so that they could concentrate on the little scavenger hunt.
Draco also straightened up, pulled his legs out from under Harry's and sat cross-legged opposite him. Harry frowned but then imitated the pose and looked at Draco waiting. The blond looked
"Or Snape," I remembered. "I always thought he was unnecessarily cruel, but in the end even he turned out to be human." Sort of like Malfoy, and yet not like Malfoy at all.
"Will Weasley sleep in our room every night from now on?" Draco asked Harry out of nowhere. Harry paused in his movement before continuing to spread butter on his bread and exchanging a look with Ron. The redhead looked highly uncomfortable.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes in agony for a moment. If he was honest, he didn't exactly know why he wanted to help Draco, but “I don't know” wasn't a particularly good answer. “After he rescued me in the lake, everything changed. On one hand, I became curious, of course, but on the other hand, this new…
Draco raised an eyebrow as if Harry had said something rude. He was just curious, really. He'd noticed Draco wasn't on first-name terms with anyone on the farm, apart from the ponies.
Draco tilted his head as if he could read Harry's mind. "If you hadn't been such an arse, I would be even nicer to you," he said playfully, eliciting a protesting laugh from Harry.
, he’d done it. He had kissed him. Again! So it was probably official and he could no longer deny his feelings for the Slytherin to himself. And on top of that, Harry James Potter had a date! With the biggest block of ice Hogwarts had ever seen.
Draco moaned softly, arched his back, raised his head and looked at Harry over his shoulder. The clear grey, as dark as Harry
"Will you deign to share your surely scintillating thoughts with me today?" Malfoy asked into the silence. He had rested his chin on his palm and propped himself slightly as he elegantly leaned over the table that separated us. "Usually, I would refer to my busy schedule and subtly ask you to keep it short or leave, but bearing in mind that I don't have any appointments nor a schedule, it wouldn't be half as impressive."
Harry checks his wristwatch and when he looks up again, Jimar enters the room – accompanied by Hermione, just as they had arranged – with a broad grin on his face. Harry greets him with a hug and first gets asked how he has been. He assures Jimar that he is in good health and that none of the curses has left any serious damage. When Jimar is asked about his welfare, he just shrugs it off and summons a third chair for Hermione to take a seat in.
"This is not an easy memory for me," Draco murmured, evidently desperately searching for the right words.
So Potter was silent again, and Draco was feverishly searching for an answer. Something he could say to make all this more bearable for the broken man. He didn’t find an answer and Potter didn’t expect one. There were too many and at the same time no words at all to be spoken in such a moment. Draco just hoped quietly that Potter
"You're going to be Uncle Harry," Ron confirms and they both laugh at Harry's overwhelmed expression.
Ron eyed him closely, then sighed. "I'm gonna tell him that this was my idea. The bet, I mean. That you never actually wanted to do it. Mate, I practically forced you into it!"
That his magic is inadequate for this purpose is no secret, but it complicates their situation nonetheless. At the very least, it results in Harry being supplied with another pile of books by Hermione that focus on the enhancement of magic. Harry doubts that his research will bear fruit and Ron and Hermione's ideas also decrease with each passing day.
Draco's fingers dig into the thin cloth trousers on his legs. He rests his chin on his knees and lowers his eyelids without closing them completely. "Azkaban. Not a dream, just a memory."
While Draco smoothly let the robe slither from his shoulders, Harry's gaze drifted lower. Underneath the bodycage, Draco wore silky, tone-like knickers, tied only at the sides with narrow ribbons. Harry only had to stretch out his hand, pull on one of the ends of the bows and Draco would be exposed. It was the sweetest of all temptations, Harry felt his cheeks burning and searched speechlessly for Draco's gaze.
"You're talking about the effectiveness of the plan, not safety," Ron interjects. "But it's true. Killing the owner of the Elder Wand guarantees sole possession in a way that no disarming could."
Draco rolled his eyes, but then gently patted Harry's cheek. "No, protection. It not only prevents unwanted pregnancies but also diseases. How about we postpone the long-overdue sex education lesson until another time?"
Apparently, we both could just state the obvious. I lowered my wand but remained exactly where I was.
No, he was many things since time had begun to heal old wounds, but being a coward certainly wasn't one of them.
Harry grimaced at the image but nodded. “Not a very exciting thought.” He had seen with his own eyes how much Draco could control his urges, he wouldn’t make the mistake of underestimating him, but he also knew that there were only a few hours left until Draco’s birthday and that the blond certainly knew what he was talking about.
Uncertain whether to push Draco against the cool sheet again or how to proceed at all, Harry stayed in place, his hands resting on Draco's sides left and right, his thumbs slowly circling and he concentrated solely on the wet tongue huddling against his own. Unimpressed by Harry's stiffness, Draco shifted closer on his knees to urge their bodies against each other, shoving a bent leg between Harry's, successfully stirring the blood in Harry's crotch once more.
"If you don't want to, we don't have to do it. But I think you would like it," Draco breathed to Harry's lips, his words heated Harry's cheeks. Holy shit, it was definitely joyful anticipation
, he begged inwardly. Why hadn't he just listened to Ron and had waited? Why had he brought the subject up at all? Now they were forced to talk about it
Harry let a hand slide into Draco's hair and sighed. This had been a bloody good birthday present indeed. Maybe even the best.
to confess. He needed to see him, and if he wasn't allowed to do that, he needed some other sign of life from Draco. Even an insult would have worked wonders, but Draco remained silent and Harry could only guess what was going on inside him.
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted calmly, opening his eyes and gazing at Harry, who expressed pure understanding. He knew how Draco felt because he was going through exactly the same emotions.
“Don't worry about it. It's an extremely complex subject and not of concern to you,” Draco hastened to say, continuing to look at the creature angrily.
Harry nodded hastily, his lubricated fingers hovering somewhere in the air behind Draco, who lay half on his arm, robbing him of most of his ability to move. "Come here," he murmured at Draco's lips, pulling the blond towards him and between his legs. He had to make a truly great effort not to moan unrestrainedly when Draco's erection brushed against his. Instead, he found Draco's lips and deepened the kiss.
The feeling of parchment in his ink-dyed fingers, the splashing in front of round windows, loud laughter that filled the Slytherin Common Room. Hogwarts. Harry was on the right track.
Draco exhaled in a controlled fashion, then walked towards Harry until he was standing right in front of him. "You – If you ask, I won't say no."
Gasping for breath, eyes closed and feeling the light sheen of sweat on his forehead and upper lip, Harry groped for Draco and caught cool fingers that had lingered on his thigh. Draco returned the slight pressure on Harry’s hand, then moved, crawling back up his bed to Harry’s eye level, while pulling the blanket back over them. Harry clearly felt Draco’s erection craving for attention against his thigh.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t understand it either. That never happened to me before when I was with him. It makes no sense at all, but the mere possibility that I could be his saviour… I don’t know what I… Guys, I’m screwed…”
He thought about the fact that he was going back to London. Alone. He had been aware of this before the disaster, but he had pushed the thought so far into the distance that he had almost forgotten it. It was terrifying because even if Draco would consider forgiving Harry, it didn't mean that he would do it before Harry was forced to leave.
“If I’m supposed to be at the lake at sunrise, it’s going to be difficult to get enough sleep,” Harry remarked with a bold grin.
"I thought you wanted me to be able to enter it," Harry says quietly, feeling more foolish with each word. "I didn't understand why, but ... later I sort of hoped it."
Harry blinked as Draco's voice interrupted his thoughts. They had reached the back of the mare's paddock and stopped. Harry had been a little too distracted by Draco's ponytail to notice.
"Your priority is to gather clues," Healer Isaksen instructs, standing next to him and lightly squeezing his shoulder. "Whatever you do, don't let the book know what it doesn't already know. The gentlemen of Auror Headquarters cannot foresee what effect it might have."
Harry's eyes grew wide. That was a joke, wasn't it? It had to be a joke. Did Draco ever for even a second not think about winning? If Harry thought about it that way, he probably had that morning. If he'd gone off to hide, he clearly had no intention of entering the event. One couldn't blame him, Harry couldn't have focused on this triviality either if he were in his place. The competition was a joke compared to what he had with Draco.
"I've already taken care of the paperwork," Isaksen informs him as they exit the high-security sector and walk down the fourth floor corridor. "Take care of him. He is the same person you have grown fond of."
Lost in Draco's eyes, Harry let himself go. Nothing made him feel better than the clear storm grey that flared up yellow and red in the firelight. He could read them, he could sense and understand Draco's feelings easily and without difficulty in his eyes. He saw Draco's blindness, his realisation, his embarrassment, his composure, his fear and hope. The perfect contradiction in itself. Not just black, not just white, but pure grey.
it, I told myself I was in the right. She played the games, pretended it didn't mean much to her, used Krum to make me jealous because I did the same thing. It was –"
“Just be straightforward, Harry. Did you have –?” Though Hermione wanted him to speak straightforwardly, she herself simply left the question in the air without further elaboration.
Harry watched in disappointment as the last bit of naked skin disappeared beneath the light blue fabric. "We'll just put it off till later, I
Harry couldn’t help but be nervous as he stood, invisible, in front of the Prefects’ Bathroom later that evening. But who wouldn’t understand that? His last conversation with Draco happened two days ago, Harry’s retreat had probably come out of nowhere from Draco’s point of view, maybe he even resented it. Anyway, it was definitely a situation to be nervous about.
And then everything was easy again. Draco's lips moved against Harry's in a familiar rhythm, he slid closer to Harry's side, his fingers ghosting over his upper body. They didn't pursue any particular goal, they were merely there because they were meant to be
He finds it often enough during his regular visits to the Burrow, where he meets the most diverse constellations of the Weasley family. But when he sits alone in his flat on his small, cream-coloured sofa on Sundays, he feels lonely. Regardless of whether Pup is purring on his lap or not.
Harry kissed Draco's cheek, jaw, nose, forehead, leaving the blond all the time in the world, then, all of a sudden, he felt his trousers and pants getting pulled down and long fingers closed around his erection.
I froze slightly and stared at Draco in disbelief. Something about his words suggested that he knew all too well that he was going to be in a life-threatening situation in his future. But did that not mean that Malfoy, who was vegetating in hospital, knew about it too? What reason did he have to keep the path of his salvation a secret?
“This ring,” Harry began as casually as he could. “Does it have any purpose?” Was the question too obvious? Shouldn’t he have asked if it was a family heirloom? Why in Merlin’s name would it serve any purpose? But Draco didn’t raise his head and accuse Harry of treason. Instead, he just stayed calm with his eyes closed.
Slowly, Draco lifted his chin from Harry’s bowed head, allowing him to raise it. “My fate is a curse, yours is your recklessness. Believe me when I tell you that you do need saving.”
Draco tilts his head back, giving Harry the opportunity to kiss and suck on the sensitive skin under his jaw. All the while, Harry moves to meet Draco's touch, listening to himself gasp softly as Draco's fingers expertly ghost along the cleft between his cheeks, yet never touching his most sensitive parts.
that Draco was doing the work for him, so he could use all his concentration to not come instantly. "Relax, don't think," Draco breathed to his ear, fondling his hair, the movement of his hips turned sluggish. Harry sighed, focused only on Draco's scent and the closeness of his body. He actually relaxed.
"No, let me finish," Draco instantly silenced Harry. "Now, if you felt judged, I want you to know that that wasn't my intention. I was merely... taken by surprise, and I would suggest that, in order to avoid such a reaction in the future, you share such suggestions with me at more convenient times.”
Why was the blond so close? Didn’t he realise he was throwing Harry off-kilter? The light scent of lavender almost killed him. Draco’s eyes looked more silver than grey in the light of the Lumos, which reminded Harry strongly of his mer-creature form. Harry was wondering if he used his charm to confuse him. No, he was wearing the ring, meaning he couldn’t, right? Draco had been a bit too attractive to Harry from the beginning. Maybe Draco couldn’t
about my hygiene. No normal person is as sensitive to stubble as you are," Harry returned and remembered amusedly the discussion they had this morning after Harry had kissed Draco. He didn't seem to like the beard stubble too much.
Malfoy's lips pursed slightly. "Yes, I know a number of things about the Elder Wand. Why are you asking me about it?"
Draco's feelings were suddenly as clear as never before. In Draco, there was never just one side of the coin, he was more. And to Harry, he was even more. He wished he could name the feeling. It was easy to break them down into their individual pieces, but the big picture lay before him as if in a fog. He wanted what was best for Draco. He wanted to be the best for Draco.
Harry's gaze glided over Draco's wet hair, feeling the urge to touch Draco somewhere again, but left it with a sigh. “You don't get it. I'm not trying to help you because I may owe you, but because that's the right thing to do. You help people who are in danger or simply need help. It
Draco kept his mouth closed, looked up into the sky again, stroked the back of Harry's hand with his thumb in absentia and suddenly seemed very lost in thought. With the moonlight shimmering in his hair, Draco was the perfect reminiscent of a forbidden fruit. All Harry was allowed to do was look at him, but he wanted so much more. Nothing and everything stood between them. Harry just had to hold out his hand.
Harry coughed, spat water and at the same time gasped for air, the sweet air that enveloped him again. He opened his eyes, blinked the tears away from the corners of his eyes and thrashed around wildly as if by reflex. But there was no one there. Harry turned his head to the side and realised that he was not alone after all.
"I was terrified," Malfoy said calmly, as soon as he realised I was not going to answer his question. "I was terrified of dying, I was terrified of living and above all, I was terrified that someone would be harmed because of my failure."
"Shit, this is huge," exclaimed Ron, who had finally gotten out of the car, shielded his eyes from the sunlight with one hand and looked around in awe.
“Spare me your pathetic attempts at explanation, Potter. You don't seem to know anything about discretion,” hissed Draco, the right half of his upper lip twitching.
But Harry soon realised why Draco had broken away. Determined, he turned under the silk blanket until he sat on Harry’s lap. Merlin, the blond would kill Harry! Continuing to sit on Harry’s lap, Draco bent forward again to press his lips demandingly onto Harry’s. He gratefully accepted the offer, while trying not to think about the sweet friction in his lap, making his blood boil.
Jimar's expression promptly turns serious. "It's not that simple. You haven't got any authority and because you've been gone for –"
Draco's eyelids fluttered open and he fixed Harry with a cold gaze. "Why should I believe you? You've done nothing but lie so far.”
Harry stared at the doorknob for a moment, wondering whether he should simply ignore Malfoy’s words, but somehow, he felt a bit queasy. Something was very wrong here and it was perhaps not the right moment to find out what it was. So Harry turned on his heel and hurried on to his transfiguration class.
More of the glowing liquid seeped from the apparently closed wounds and dripped onto the white sheets, where it vanished into thin air as if it had never been. The lines glimmered one more time, then slowly dimmed, the glowing liquid disappearing along with them.
"We better get back. My training starts soon," Draco remarked. As if the weather was agreeing with Draco's argument, the rain suddenly stopped.
Potter wasn't in their room when Draco was getting ready for the evening. He was also absent for dinner along with Granger and Weasley, as Draco had to discover. Zabini assured him that Potter had been brought lunch. Once again, Draco should have been pleased, but his chest was tight.
I opened my mouth, wanting to blurt out to him that his possible death would be his own fault if he objected now, but could feel the tug of magic throughout my body before I got the chance.
never cared about morals. It is as Robards put it. Malfoy is a Death Eater. Which, in addition to his hopeless personality, makes him not only Harry's rival but also an enemy. So why would Harry care about morals for him?
, and only because Malfoy had told his diary about it. I was not getting anywhere like this – I already knew this memory, I did not need to revisit it through Malfoy's eyes.
"Log entry of July 24, 2018, at 20:37. The test subject is unresponsive to verbal stimulation. Mr Potter is still completely caught up in his fascination with Goldilocks," Ron said in a played robotic voice, finally earning Harry's attention.
"Holy shit, Harry, is that yours? She's so cute!" Ron's face appeared behind the bars of the stall, next to him Hermione, giving them prying looks.
Draco stilled, keeping his gaze steady on my face. I could sense that he was endeavouring to swallow any comments that were burning on the tip of his tongue and wanted him to know that he did not have to do that. He could be as honest and casual with me as he had once been. But I did not have the words to articulate that.
A little more confidence in Harry's abilities would certainly do Draco good, but in such a short amount of time, one couldn’t expect everything to settle between them right away. Trust needed time and they hadn’t had enough of that yet. Maybe one day they would be able to trust each other unconditionally. Harry liked the idea somehow.
If the situation hadn’t really been so serious, Harry would have laughed now, but instead, he set about eating his breakfast again. Of course, he wouldn’t be able to just accept Draco’s decision, but changing his mind wouldn’t be easy. Harry would have to work on a plan. Too bad he didn’t have enough time to think about it.
Mr Potter's expression goes blank. "But how can that be? Is that even possible? How do you even know that
While Draco was still shoving his wand under a pillow again, Harry drew himself closer to him, then nestled against his chest uninvited, wrapped one arm around his stomach and closed his eyes contentedly. Draco made a small surprised sound, but then wound one arm around Harry, the other hand finding Harry's on his stomach. He interweaved their fingers, sighed softly and placed a small kiss on his head.
The waterspirit had indeed reappeared and apparently had just started talking to them?! Harry stared perplexed at the ugly figure, which looked at them calmly, with an expression of contentment in its grimace.
Malfoy's expression remained unimpressed. "Then I’m pleased to inform you that you will no longer have any reason to converse with me in the future."
Surprised, Harry took a look at the clothes. A pair of grey loose trousers that looked like they could be used as pyjamas as well as everyday clothes and a simple black t-shirt. Still in surprise, Harry lifted his eyes to look at Draco, who watched him closely during his inspection. “Thanks?” Harry replied, but it sounded more like a question.
It took Harry a moment to tear himself away from the sight of the naked skin gradually coming to light, but then he started to take off his own shirt. They didn't have forever, at some point their absence would be noticed, and then people would start looking for them.
He pushes himself off the kitchen cupboard and places two teacups on the counter in front of Harry, smiling in a way that tells Harry that Ron trusts that he will be ready soon. That he will get a grip and that time will heal Harry's wounds.
. Draco ended his half-heartedly meant tirade, placed his cheek on his forearm and noticed Harry's gaze.
confrontation. Just when he lost control, another side of him took over that Harry couldn’t yet fully assess. Blaise knew that side, Hermione knew that side, and Harry was sure that if they knew Draco long enough, the others knew about it too. But Harry didn't know it, he had only made a fleeting acquaintance with it and suddenly this felt like a severe disadvantage.
Jimar gleefully holds out his hand to Mr Potter, who, after a brief moment of hesitation, takes it. "Jimar. It's a pleasure, Mr Potter. I'm a big fan of your work!”
Harry wished for nothing more than to turn to Draco and look at him, but he held back, looking at his parchment in front of him instead. It frustrated him that only one question was buzzing around in his head, despite all the new information he had gained, and this question was certainly due to his
“Because he turns you on or because he’s really trying to be a better person?” Ron asked further and Harry began to pull nervously at the hem of his sweater. He’d be lying if he said it was purely curse-free. It was
February dawns inexorably upon them, providing the first snowless days in weeks. Progress in their work is slow, the constant sifting through books is tedious, yet it is all they can do. Hermione consults her colleagues but again remains unsuccessful. Over and over again and no matter in which direction they research, they return to one and the same theory: Draco is the one who has to detach his magic from the scars in order to heal the wounds completely.
Even the thoughts he has been harbouring for days suddenly do not seem so frightening and instead like an idea he can trust. He must hope for the support of his friends in his idea. As is so often the case, the plan stands or falls with their agreement and help.
The glistening of Draco’s skin began to weaken and Harry thrust again. Again and again and again until he found his rhythm and lost himself in it. He let himself fall, continued their kisses, sucking on bare skin. He couldn’t keep his fingers steady and floated in a world he had never seen before, full of ecstasy and lust that was brewing up and then suddenly emptied itself over him.
A feeling of doing something forbidden, because Harry silently and secretly looked at the pool, that caused more pain than familiarity in him.
As the familiar surroundings return, so do the familiar thoughts in his mind. That Draco inevitably occupies a large part of them is hardly surprising. Harry weighs his options, even discusses them with Pup, who boredly watches him walk up and down his flat and is by no means more helpful than any other house cat.
”. The problem is that most researchers assume that there are crossbreeds between the creatures, but these have not yet been documented. Meaning we might be in a grey area,” Hermione continued, slamming the thick tome shut and reaching for the next book.
Harry has to dig a fingernail into the skin of his hand to convince himself that he is not dreaming. He does not wake up and his heartbeat quickens inexorably.
Harry raised both eyebrows, leaned forward slightly until the tip of his nose brushed against Draco's. "I must insist, even."
But let's start at the beginning: It all began on a warm summer's day in southern Wiltshire, England. The sun burned mercilessly down on the little-used road, but the cool wind made the heat seem bearable. It was the perfect day, the meadows bloomed in a rich green and yellow, the freshly harvested corn fields lay like brown splashes of paint in between and completed the picture flawlessly. The sky was bluer than it had been for a long time, not a cloud was visible far and wide.
“Yes, we should probably do that,” Draco murmured, closed his eyes again and snuggled closer to Harry as if afraid he would jump up to leave at once. But the silent encouragement was obvious in Draco’s voice, meaning he agreed with Harry, which made it a little easier. He didn’t mean to hurt Draco. He just wanted to state the obvious.
to annoyed within seconds. Quietly cursing, Harry pulled the damn thing out of his pocket, looked at the display – it was Sirius,
The stables were divided into two sectors. The smaller one was for the stallions, as Hermione explained to them. The larger one was for the mares and geldings ("Geldings are castrated stallions, have you ever dealt with the subject 'horse' before, Ronald?"). Here, two or three ponies shared a stall and a small paddock.
way? What if he found Harry's staring uncomfortable? What if he wanted a new teammate because of this? What if last night had been too much for him? What if he didn’t reciprocate Harry’s feelings?
Draco had found what he was looking for. Without warning, a wave of lust shot through Harry's body and gathered at his midst. It made his legs quiver and his face flushed with sweat.
Anja does not believe in ghost stories and is not a follower of superstition to any degree, but when she received the message that the convict in question had been admitted to the intensive care unit and looked at her watch, which showed 13:13 on the clock, she sensed that her seven-hour shift was about to take a turn for the worse. However, the wizard certainly owes his survival neither to the fact that his day of admission was not a Friday nor the thirteenth of a month, but entirely to her own skill.
Draco sighed, gave Harry a quick glance, then continued to stare at the lake. “That doesn't concern you in the slightest b–”
The blond moaned uninhibitedly, surrendering to the safety of being drowned out by the sounds of the raging thunderstorm. His head dropped back, his hair fell out of his face, drops of sweat glistened on his temples. Harry reached down to Draco's hips, one hand gripping soft cheeks, the other moving between Draco's legs. Draco's hand embraced Harry's, his breath went fast, he was getting tired and Harry wouldn't push him to exhaustion.
Harry’s body reacted with pure happiness, which coursed through his veins and made him even hornier than he already was. Draco seemed to feel the same, he was trying to get as close as possible to Harry and buried his hands in Harry’s hair. Their tongues picked up the familiar game, Harry felt the tingling on his skin and in his stomach and sighed with relish.
Draco's gaze only grew cooler as he pressed his lips tightly together, presumably to prevent himself from hexing Harry here and now. Harry took the opportunity to take a step backwards, bumping into a metal bucket in the shelf behind him, which fell noisily to the floor. Startled,Harry looked wide-eyed back and forth between the bucket and Draco. The blond rolled his eyes over his scatterbrained state but froze when two students began to speak muffled in front of the wooden door.
She's tamed her red hair with an extravagant braid and wears a jade-coloured one-piece suit, but the most impressive aspect of her is her aura. Harry has yet to meet another person who exclusively captivates everyone around her with such ease. It is a quality Harry will probably always admire in her.
Draco’s reaction was really amusing to look at: the eyes that grew big, the startled gasp that escaped his lips, and the small step that he took backwards in astonishment. “How did you –?”
“Anyway, I think I found out what that creature in the Great Lake was!” Hermione started, returning to the subject. “It seems a lot like a siren, but since you were talking about the hideous figure, I wasn't quite sure. Sirens only show their true face when it’s already too late for the victim. But there is a hybrid creature of mermaid, siren and Rusalka, which fits your description much better. Mostly they are simply called waterspirits. It is assumed that although they devote themselves to their primitive needs to eat people, they rarely dare to go ashore.
Harry instantly sat up in the water and looked at Draco with enthusiasm. “So you must have feelings for someone! Who is it?” he asked, with no sense of tact.
Hermione nods and at last, a small smile settles on her lips. "Jimar is fine. He was already here, but you were still asleep then."
"How –" Draco interjects, but Harry is already dropping his bowl and spoon and whirls around to face Draco excitedly.
"He had nothing to lose." Draco's eyelids flutter slightly, causing Harry to notice that Draco's eyes are not closed and his gaze is merely resting on their hands. "No consequences he has to anticipate. No loss that inevitably lurks around every corner. No fear of memories that reach to the very marrow of his bones."
"You're lucky. No horse manure for you!" Draco swept the back of his hand provisionally over Harry's shoulder as if to make the wet sand disappear, shook his head and eyed Harry's tangled hair.
Draco let himself fall back onto his bed, let Harry push him onto the middle of the sheet and continued the kiss uninhibited. Their rhythm was perfect as if they had never done anything else. Soft moans escaped their mouths, Harry leaned over Draco, broke the kiss, watched Draco's hair fanning out onto the silk and noticed the coarse-meshed net above Draco's waistband.
The matter was now officially the sole concern of the Ministry, the hospital no longer had any say in it. Auror Filly emphasised this to me when he had ordered me into the security staff's office early the next day, without any consideration of my wishes.
"Stay calm, Mr Potter," a velvety voice chimes, unfamiliar to Harry but evoking nothing but comfort in him. "Here. Drink this. It'll make you feel better."
Harry's head was reeling, it had consumed him for too long to lay his lips on that beautiful arse, now that the time had finally come, he was only worried that Draco wasn't ready for it. But Draco just sighed, arched his back even more and looked rather like he was getting impatient. Before Harry could change his mind, he tugged a little on Draco's hip so that he had to step out of the water jet and prop himself up against the tile wall with his arms. Harry placed a last kiss on Draco’s lower back, then he spread his sweet cheeks with his fingers and let his tongue slide along the crack.
Of course, there is the possibility that Malfoy only displayed such a reaction towards him because he had been confronted with his mother's death. Harry wants to cling to that and be lenient, but he knows he would be fooling himself. It is the extremes that reveal the truth. What Malfoy has shown to Harry is who he truly is.
Neither of them mentions the fact that Malfoy does not even know he was involved in solving a case. They are aware of it and Harry deliberately decides that it does not matter to point it out or not.
The ride went relatively disastrous. And that although the conditions were perfect. The weather was good but not too hot. They rode most of the time through the forest, which meant extra shade and on top of that the atmosphere under the leaf canopy of the giant deciduous trees was wonderful.
