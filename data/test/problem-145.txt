Draco scowled. ‘I’m sure I can manage.’
, thought Malfoy – and the younger boy moaned as he impaled the Gryffindor. He thrust himself up to the hilt of his cock a few times, and then felt the head of another cock waiting outside Fred’s hole. George’s member was twitching in anticipation.
It was too late for protestations. Blaise had already gripped his cock at the tip, and slid his hand down its length twice before he began to squirt his seed all over Draco’s boxers, coating one side of them in globs of his pearly white cum.
‘No, he’s got a detention with Snape. And don’t evade the question, Malfoy! I want to know what you’re doing with your dick out while my brother’s got the Imperius curse on him.’
‘Don’t tell me Daphne found you,’ the blond boy chortled in response.
‘Did you see us in Charms today?’ asked Zabini. ‘She actually
His abs were clenched. The slapping of his skin against hers was louder than ever. His prick was throbbing so much that it felt twice the size it usually did.
‘Madam Pomfrey…’
Sure enough, the boy reached a hand inside his robes and started moving it around a bit.
‘What the
Draco stood up and stretched out his limbs. ‘Suit yourself, then. I’m off.’
Blaise had turned the whole thing into a game. Each time now that he buried his cock into the cushion, he let out a fierce moan, chanting things like, ‘
‘And what if I don’t want to tell you, Weaselbee? What will you do then?’
Draco didn’t know if it was Potter’s words that he found so intoxicating, or simply the sound of his voice. It was the very same voice that he, Draco, had spent so long training his ears to pick up; the voice that he had learnt to discern over the top of every other voice in a classroom. He turned on to his side and undulated his hips in bed, desperately seeking something corporeal to rub his aching cock against, wishing with every bone in his body that Harry’s voice was flesh.
‘Fred?’ the other boy continued, walking towards his twin. The door to the corridor closed silently behind him. ‘Wh- what are you doing?’
‘…I heard him giving Potter the password…’
‘Dunno,’ Malfoy admitted, ‘but when you’re me, it comes pretty easily.’
Lucius Malfoy stowed his wand away silently inside his silver evening robes, watching over his son as the boy’s softening cock released a few final squirts of cum. Kneeling at the Draco’s side, he reached out a finger and scooped some of it from below the boy’s pink nipple on to his forefinger. He carried it to his mouth and sucked on it, pensive.
’ demanded George. ‘That’s illegal, Malfoy!’
Harper muttered something that sounded vaguely like ‘Going to the library.’
‘You probably see them naked all the time though, don’t you?’ he pressed on.
,’ he muttered, and the loaf that Fred had been plunging his cock into several minutes earlier flew directly into Draco’s hand. ‘Thanks, Potter,’ he said to himself. Wrapping a fist around his prick, Malfoy stroked himself a few more times before long, pearly ropes of cum began to shoot out from his cock, landing all over the bread. ‘Aargh, FUCK yeah,’ he moaned noisily, milking himself of every last drop. Then, turning his wand so that it pointed at Fred’s body, he murmured, ‘
thought Lucius. It was desire, more than anything else, that Draco felt for Potter. The use of legilimency had proved what Draco’s constant slander of Potter had only hinted at … that Draco – his own son – had been foolish enough to develop feelings for the perished Dark Lord’s quarry.
‘No, no, no,’ tutted Madam Pomfrey. ‘It’ll be the slow and scenic route for you today, Mr Malfoy. I’m going to give you a potion that will take the sensation away from your arm. It takes a few minutes to set in, you understand, and after that I can tend to the bones. And
‘Oh, quit your whining,’ said the blond boy. ‘He’ll be back to normal soon enough.’
The journey up to the fifth floor was quick and relatively straightforward. Malfoy resisted lighting his wand in case a teacher caught sight of it whilst patrolling a corridor, and instead he climbed the many flights of stairs by the moonlight seeping in through the windows.  When he neared the fourth floor he heard a distinct hiss that would surely be from Mrs Norris, and he lay low for a minute before climbing the last two flights of stairs two at a time.
happy.
Draco got to his feet and George did the same. Trusting that his Imperius curse was still strong enough, the blond boy wordlessly instructed Fred to finally stop fingering himself. Fred stood up obligingly, and Malfoy approached him slowly from behind. George followed in front; a freckly, impish grin spreading across his face. Malfoy placed a cold hand on each of Fred’s arse cheeks and, showing off his strength, lifted the older boy up into the air and directly on to his cock. Fred was already a lot tighter than George –
‘Argh,
‘Well, I disagree. I got you going, didn’t I?’
‘Reckon,' he sniggered as he rolled over on to his stomach, 'I’m gonna get some practice in for Daphne'. He reached one hand under the hem of his striped pyjama bottoms, and pulled out his semi-erect member, pressing it up against the cushion. If Draco wasn’t hard already, he certainly was now. Not saying a word, he struggled to get his eyes off Zabini’s cock. Fuck, was it incredible. Draco realised only now that he’d never seen the thing before, which was wholly surprising considering they’d shared a dormitory together for the better part of four years. The thing was a proper wonder to behold; its smooth, chocolate-coloured shaft must’ve been at least seven inches in length, and had an impressive girth to match. Blaise’s balls were round and tight, hanging close underneath it. As the boy slowly began to rub himself back and forth against the fabric of the cushion, the tip of the cock was revealed with each thrust. Malfoy didn't know what he was seeing.
‘Shut up, Weaselbee. Who do you find more attractive; me, or your brother?’
‘Come on. How many people have you shagged in the past week?’
. Come in here,’ Draco added, hearing the door unlatch itself. He walked into the room and carefully re-bolted the door behind himself and Harper. ‘So, um… want to hop up on a desk?’
‘And what if I do?’ Draco retaliated. ‘It’d give me an even bigger headstart on you. Either way, it sounds like a good place to bust a nut. You coming?’
Draco turned the parchment over in his fingers. This side was blank apart from a few choice words. ‘How’d you do this?’ Draco asked the other boy.
Draco tossed his head from side to side, feeling the slow burn building in his gut … the tightening of his balls.
‘Well… our dad’s always telling us about something the Muggles have… a flashlight, or a fleshlote, or something like that. They put their cock in it, and-’
‘Yep,’ said Draco. ‘Just the tip of your finger first, and then the rest when you’re ready.’ He watched as the boy slowly inserted his finger, keeping a steady hold on his cock all the while, and started moving it in and out. Seemingly for the first time, the boy’s eyes had fully closed. His breathing became heavy, his chest rising and falling as he stroked his little cock and fingered himself. Then, to Draco’s delight, he began to moan softly and emit swear words in the cutest voice Draco thought possible.
‘Happy now?’ asked Fred, visibly humiliated.
Draco grinned. ‘I’d probably have a wank with it.’
‘Well,’ muttered Fred, ‘not exactly. I… got a little bored of waiting for the others. I don’t know where they’ve gotten to, they said they’d be here ages ago. And the bloody mermaid gave me a stiffy, you see.’
The boy nodded.
His cock was hammering in and out of her, her arousal still trickling down into his blond pubes.
Once the two brothers were less than a foot apart, Fred looked up at George and said, ‘Hello Georgie,’ and Draco caught a glimmer of lust and appetite in George’s eyes. Under Draco’s silent command, Fred lowered his mouth on to his brother’s prick and began sucking on at least six inches of it. He wrapped a hand around the bottom of the shaft and, whenever Draco wanted, gave it a slight twist. George looked as though he’d never experienced something so pleasurable. His mouth gaped open and he ran his fingers through his brother’s hair. Draco slid a hand up and down his own length, whilst puppeteering Fred’s every move. Occasionally he would increase the speed at which Fred’s head was bobbing up and down, which always got a particularly agreeable reaction from the other twin.
Harry went on.
Madam Pomfrey had lost her austerity entirely; she seemed to melt under his touch.
‘If you can shag fifty people before I hook up with Daphne, I’ll…’
‘What?’
‘Diggory and Potter?’ jumped Blaise. ‘Talking about a bathroom?’
‘I dunno bud, forty? Fifty?’ Draco joked.
Blaise, on Draco’s very own advice, had made an effort to grow his hair out over the Christmas holidays, and by the time he’d returned to Hogwarts only a few days ago it had grown to such a length that Blaise usually now kept it tucked behind his ears. His mother had tirelessly assured him that the style was quite fetching, and that he ought to consider making the change permanent. Blaise, however, knew all too well that she would always dote on any man’s features, so long as the fellow had enough Galleons stored up in the bank. Even
Draco awoke groggily, groaning into the sofa, and in his half-conscious state he found that he had to wipe a decent amount of sleep from the corners of his eyes before he was able to open them properly. Hardly bothering to stifle a yawn, he noisily mustered the strength to push his top half up off the sofa and on to his elbows. He blinked a few times as he looked around, and was eventually able to locate the other body within the room, sprawled out stark naked on the sofa opposite him.
‘All right then,’ said Zabini. 'Fifty it is.’
breathed Harry. He was inside Draco’s ears; he was everywhere; he was nowhere at all.
he thought,
Malfoy realised that he must have been gawping, for Fred’s face turned a deep shade of red – a shade so dark that it was visible even in the dimly lit room. The older boy pulled his cock out of the loaf of bread and, before Draco could catch a glimpse of it, used the bread to cover himself up.
‘What’s that?’
Once Fred was lying flat on the marble floor, the Slytherin boy sat next to it and pondered what to do next. His arsehole was still sore, so he lay on top of Fred’s unconscious body with their dicks pressed against one another and rubbed his prick up and down the older boy’s abs. It was the first chance he had to kiss Fred properly, so he snogged him aggressively, his tongue darting in and out with no resistance whatsoever. Faster and harder he rubbed himself against Fred, until he knew that he was about to cum. As tempted as he was to turn the redhead over and cum in his arse, or else do it directly into his mouth, Draco settled on another idea.
‘Enough foolishness, Mr Malfoy. Lay out your arm.’
Madam Pomfrey said nothing, but quickened her pace. Draco could feel the warmth of her cheeks against his throbbing cock. Each time her nose reached his pubes, she gave a wet, gagging noise that bounced off the four walls of the hospital wing. He knew that she was only just managing to fit his whole length in her mouth.
‘Merlin,’ said Draco, ‘you feel fucking good.’
, thought Draco. He could see that the Imperius Curse was weak – Fred’s disgust and desire to keep his mouth shut was evident in his eyes – but rather obediently the ginger boy opened his mouth, and started to eat the section of the bread that was coated in Draco’s seed. Malfoy laughed as Fred consumed the entire load. Unexpectedly aroused by it, he started to play with his own cock again.
The funny thing, upon reflection, was that Draco hadn’t even felt anything happening. For about ten minutes after he had revealed to Blaise that his trip to the Prefects’ bathroom had involved more than just a wank, the two of them had wrestled one another in Blaise’s bed – the sort of play-wrestle that they had been partaking in for years, where neither of them intended to seriously hurt the other. The fight had culminated, however, in Blaise pushing Draco from the bed and on to the cold wooden floor. All that Draco could remember was that he had then admitted defeat, and had crawled drowsily back into his own bed. It wasn’t until Madam Pomfrey took a good look at him the next morning that he learnt he had broken two of the bones in his right arm.
,’ groaned George after less than a minute of action. ‘I’m- I’m going to…’
‘No, wait,’ said Draco, propping himself up on the cushions as well. He lowered his voice. ‘I was going to tell you… I overheard something when you were away, after the ball. I walked past Diggory on my way out of the Great Hall, and he was talking to Potter about something. About the Prefects’ bathroom, which-’
Blaise snorted. ‘You just want to catch Potter there.’
Harper looked thankful for breath, but he was still smiling seductively. Draco grabbed one of his shoulders and spun him round, not saying a word. Silently commanding the boy as if he were a puppet, Malfoy positioned him on all fours so that he was facing the other way. Kneeling behind Harper on the desk, Draco gripped his cock and pointed it at the boy’s hole.
On the night of January 10
‘I know what you’re going to ask, Mr Malfoy, and it’s still a firm no.’
Draco looked around and saw that George had already beaten him to the bath. Grinning from ear to ear, thinking about what they had just done, the younger boy clambered into the sea of bubbles to join him. They lay there for several minutes, Draco soaking his muscles in the steaming water, running his hands over his own body. He was very,
‘Hahaha, shut up you fat cunt. You should’ve just stayed here for the Yule Ball, there was loads of clunge there. You could’ve gotten with Daphne for sure.’
‘Are you gonna fuck me?’ Harper asked.
‘Very well,’ she said. ‘That should do the trick. Allow me a minute while I fetch my wand, Mr Malfoy. Roll up your sleeve again, if you please. And no self-exploration whilst I’m gone.’
‘So, naturally, you thought you’d fornicate with food,’ the blond boy interjected.
‘Let’s see how
‘Then when I asked her about it, she offered for a threesome. I mean, kudos to Goyle for getting his cock into something other than his fat fist, but I didn’t really feel like having his juices all over me, you know.’
Draco laughed through his nostrils. ‘Daphne? Reckon she’d sleep with anyone.’
The parchment, he noticed, boasted a rather crude ink sketch of Blaise shoving his cock into a girl who he presumed was supposed to be Daphne. The sketched version of Daphne seemed to be enjoying it a lot, her back convexed, her cum squirting all over Blaise’s dick.
‘He’s under an Imperius curse, that’s all,’ said Draco, noting that George’s gaze was focused directly on Fred’s flaccid cock.
‘And what, you’ve been… doing things to him?’ George gestured to Draco’s naked state.
‘Dunno about that one, bud,’ Draco said.
‘You know my mum wanted me home for the holidays.’
‘Not yet,’ said Draco, standing up and beginning to remove his own robes. Tugging off his shirt and tie, he threw the whole lot over on to the pile of boxes, where they joined Fred’s.
‘Pass me your jocks.’
‘I won’t be. It’s on the fifth floor, right above us. One staircase all the way up.’
‘Well,’ Malfoy continued, ‘I suppose she
‘…I bet
The boy allowed his hands to drop to his sides as Malfoy sat up properly.
Zabini let out a very deliberate moan as he ground his cock against the cushion this time. Reaching one hand behind him from his plank position, he pulled his pyjamas down just enough to reveal his perfectly shaped arse, and continued humping the cushion, moving his hips faster and faster.
Harper grinned.
Harry Potter’s voice washed over him like a wet sponge, carrying itself across his body, dripping warm, soapy water on to flushed skin. Draco trembled slightly with every drawn-out sound, every sibilant hiss, as though the voice was rolling over his naked flesh.
‘Yeah, right. Before the end of the year though, yeah?’
, mate. There isn't a guy in our year who isn't jealous of you.’
. If it wasn’t yet seven, surely none of the other students had already woken and, unbeknownst to him, stumbled upon his aroused sleeping body. It was just this one.
. Take a bite and scorch marks start to appear on your face and hands. We’ll need to work on the name, of course, but-’
Harry paused.
‘I’ll take your word for it.’ Draco led the way towards the fourth-year boys dormitory.
Draco’s gaze shifted down to Blaise’s toned abdomen, and the snail trail of hair that led to his still-enormous flaccid cock. Thoughts of all sorts whirled around Draco’s mind, each of them more arousing than the last, until they were ever-so-cruelly interrupted by a noise on the other side of the room. Whipping his head around, Draco found the source of the noise standing on the stairwell that led up to the boys’ dormitories – a small Slytherin boy, a third-year if Draco’s memory did him any favours, looking down on the scene below with quite some bewilderment.
The boy turned scarlet, shifting his focus elsewhere.
‘You’ll what?’ snorted Draco.
‘Yes, but I’m a sex addict, remember.’
The two non-Imperiused boys soon developed a constant rhythm, taking it in turns to force the entire length of their pricks into Fred’s tight pussy. As soon as one boy pulled out, the other was already balls-deep. George did most of the work when it came to stretching his brother’s hole; his prick being a couple of inches longer than Draco’s, and his head slightly girthier. He was also positioned perfectly to hit Fred’s prostate, which he managed on almost every thrust. When it eventually felt as though Fred had been stretched far enough, Draco grabbed hold of George’s balls so as to cease their incessant thrusting. George nodded, and together the two of them pressed their cocks together and forced them slowly into Fred’s hole. Fred clamped hard and then relaxed. Malfoy was already whimpering with pleasure, and George gave one of his filthiest moans yet.
‘Certainly not. Now lie down properly, Mr Malfoy, I don’t have all day. I’ll be back in a moment with the Numbing Draught.’
‘Dunno,’ said Blaise. ‘Is there a Hogsmeade trip coming up? Or we could go to the Second Task together.’
‘What, never seen one so big before?’ was Malfoy’s desperate attempt at a response.
Blaise loosened up somewhat and chuckled, nodding. ‘Yeah all right, fair play. You reckon I’m in with a chance then?’
Draco’s excitement tripled as Harry’s voice became softer. The back of his head had found the crevice between two stacks of pillows, and it nestled there like a small bird in the cradle of two palms, his silken blond hair sprawled magnificently across shamrock-green pillow covers.
‘Get on with it then,’ muttered the older boy. Draco came a few steps closer and put his hands around Fred’s cold torso, grabbing him on both sides. He pushed Fred back towards the enormous bath, and sat him down on the marble edge. Then, plying the redhead’s muscled thighs apart, he got down on his knees.
‘Yeah… it’s impressive, I grant you,’ Draco said plainly, ‘but she’s probably seen bigger. Can’t win on that alone, man.’
‘That,’ chuckled Blaise, ‘is solely because you’re a sex addict.’
‘You’re mad, mate. I’m just going to enjoy myself here.’
Malfoy found himself hardening under his robes, already much keener to try this potion than he had been a minute earlier. He sat down and continued listening to Madam Pomfrey, an eager expression stretched across his face.
‘What, so you can fuck the bread together?’ said Draco.
‘Fuck off, Malfoy. Tell anyone about it and you’re dead.’
Draco propped himself up further. ‘You right there, mate?’ he said weakly to the boy, attempting not to buckle under veiled embarrassment.
Malfoy made a guttural sound. ‘
‘Sounds gay as fuck.’
, Blaise was half-naked on his sofa, and midway through his daily soliloquy. Draco hadn’t yet changed out of his robes.
… can’t say the same for the
‘What the
The Slytherin boy was aware that his hawthorn wand lay just a few feet away on the marble floor; he had left it there when undressing, rather than tossing it away with his robes. If only he could grab it, get hold of it, he’d be able to get Fred off his back. On the next thrust, Draco flung himself forward, lifting his upper body on to the edge of the pool. He felt Fred’s hand, which was still firmly wrapped around his six-inch cock, pull his foreskin back unbearably far as soon as his body launched forward. Ignoring the pain, Draco stuck his left arm out and grabbed hold of his wand, just as Fred started to pull him back into the water.
‘That would be an excellent threat, Weaselbee, if I happened to be at all scared of you. Now… who was it you took to the Yule Ball again? Angelina Johnson? I’m sure
‘Guilty.’
‘Who caught him?’
‘I’m waiting for George and Lee. We said we’d meet here.’
Eventually the sound of students filling the corridors reached his ears, though Draco barely noticed it. There were more important sounds that were far more local: Madam Pomfrey’s moans; the wet noise of his cock pushing inside of her again and again; the echo of him continuously spanking her already-red arse.
,’ George cried, shooting several spurts of hot, sticky semen into Malfoy’s open mouth.  The sensation of cum hitting the back of his throat was enough to send the younger boy into his own climax. Without him having touched it once, Malfoy’s cock throbbed in the air and released yet another load – this one spreading itself all over George’s feet. The two boys collapsed to the cold marble floor, where they lay grunting for a long while. A few feet away, Fred was still ploughing himself with his finger.
From his seated position on the floor, Fred looked up at his brother. The half-eaten loaf of bread now sat in his lap, but there was still cum smeared all over his chin. He gave a little smile when he caught sight of George’s face; Draco’s weak Imperius seemed to have given him the countenance of someone heavily intoxicated.
Draco naturally couldn’t feel any difference, but his arm seemed to be sticking out at a much more normal angle now.
He pinched her clit firmly and she gasped. He did it again. Within seconds, he felt the cum dribbling from her cunt, coating the length of his prick, warming it. He slapped his right hand against her arse as hard as he could, knowing that he would not feel the sting. The matron yelped, and he repeated the action with his left hand. This time he felt it, though he knew that the slight tingling sensation in his palm did not compare to the sharp pains he was inflicting upon her supple backside.
‘Don’t be stupid, we haven’t begun yet. These are just the ingredients we’ve gotten… wholesale.’
‘Does it have to take that long?’ Malfoy asked.
The boy said nothing in response, his eyes seemingly too distracted by Draco’s groin. Much to his horror, Malfoy followed the line of sight down to his own private area and made a surprising discovery.
‘Don’t you get it? I realised today that if we go up there, it’s probably a great place for a wank. Father’s always telling me to make sure I get Prefect, if only to enjoy the bathroom. It must be pretty nice.’
!’ He looked desperately at Draco. The blond boy merely smiled. Blaise started to shake his head, incredulous. ‘Oh, you… you
Back in the Slytherin common room, Blaise was waiting for him. In the space between the two boys, other students busied about in a rush to get upstairs for breakfast. Blaise stood leaning up against an arched window that looked out into the depths of the lake. He was, Draco noticed, fully clothed, though he scowled when he spotted Draco walking towards him.
yeah,’ moaned Blaise, milking his cock all over the underwear. ‘There you go. Just so you’ve got something to remember me by, Draco.’ He winked.
‘Harper,’ said the boy, with what seemed like a little more confidence.
The blond boy laughed. ‘Don’t worry about me. You just start preparing that prize you promised me, whatever it is. Besides,’ he added, ‘when exactly are you going to ask her out?’
‘That’s ages away, bud. I might already be done by then. Besides, if your idea of a date is watching Potter stumble through a few obstacles…’
Then Harper slowed, raising his eyes to look back at Draco’s face. ‘Do I just slide it in?’ he asked, the forefinger on his left hand outstretched and waiting near the entrance of his hole.
Draco writhed against his sheets, mouth open and softly panting.
‘Um- yeah, all right,’ said Harper, clearing his throat.
’. The redheaded boy sat up within seconds, but not before Draco could take aim again.
, Malfoy!’ coughed up George. ‘Merlin, if he was into blokes, don’t you think I’d be doing things with him all the time?’
‘Draco, oi,’ he said, his voice raspy.
‘And you wanted to burn your dick off?’ blurted Draco.
‘Anyway, at least now I know that if Daphne
next shag.’
George stood perfectly still. His bottom lip twitched, and after a second of contemplation he finally moved his hands away from his groin and pulled down his boxers. ‘All right then,’ he said, his cock standing at full mast. Draco grinned.
‘D’you reckon… reckon I can do it now? The finger thing?’
‘Ah, yeah, yeah,’ Harper said, squeezing his little prick. ‘Fuck, I’m- I’m going to cum. I’m going to cum, Draco.’
Zabini looked slightly repulsed.
‘Ha. We’ll see,’ Malfoy teased.
Once he was suitably erect, Draco leaned down, positioning himself over Harper’s grinning face, and then lay himself on top, squashing the boy beneath his weight. He fed the tip of his prick into Harper’s mouth, and then plunged it in fully. Harper gagged, struggling to fit all of Draco’s length in his little mouth, but Draco pushed further. It felt so good; the boy’s warm mouth enclosing around his cock. He became aware that his own well-defined pecs, which were pressed up against the younger boy’s chest, were bathing in a combination of his and Harper’s cum. Aggressively he took Harper’s smaller cock and wrapped his mouth around it. As he continued to thrust his hips into the boy’s face, Draco slurped on it forcefully, even using his teeth to grate along the boy’s foreskin. Then, his biceps bulging, he pushed the majority of his weight up off the table, and brought it swiftly back down again, plunging his cock further into Harper’s wet mouth. He repeated this movement a few times, the sensation so blissful that his body shivered every time he lowered it, before leaping off the desk entirely and on to his feet.
Draco took a step forward and saw that two of the boxes were filled with individually packaged loaves of bread, unsliced like the one in Fred’s hands. The third contained what appeared to be several small, corked bottles.
‘Now it’s probably going to feel a little bit weird the first time,’ Draco added, ‘so you want to make sure you’re as turned on as possible. Picture whatever helps you get off – it can be anything. Chicks in tiny bras, a girl rubbing her pussy in your face, Madam Hooch’s tits, whatever.’
‘Hey,’ George retorted. ‘It’s not my fault that I get plenty of action. Come on, I was just about to cum again. Please?’
‘Fuck,’ said Fred. ‘You’re so warm, and smooth… you might as well be a girl.’
‘What’s your name, kid?’
The Gryffindor robes that George had been wearing swiftly tore themselves from his body, swirling in mid-air for the briefest moment before vanishing completely. In their absence, George was left in nothing but a shirt, tie, and a tight-fitting pair of maroon underpants. He attempted to hide his groin from Malfoy immediately, but the Slytherin boy had already spotted the tip of George’s erect penis poking out from behind the elastic of his underwear. The vanishing robes had apparently knocked the ginger boy’s wand from his hand, and Draco lunged forward to pick it up from the floor. Unarmed and fuming, George put his hands in the air.
Zabini yawned and sat up. ‘Reckon I’m ready to jerk off, you? I’m hard as a rock.’
‘Hah. You should try it,’ said Draco.
‘You know, degrade her.’
‘You’ve got to be kidding, mate.’
‘Tell me about it,’ Malfoy responded. ‘You didn’t have to wait up,’ he continued quietly, tiptoeing towards Blaise’s four-poster bed. He didn’t care if Crabbe or Goyle heard him, but he thought it best not to wake Theo.
, when first introduced to the effects of the Numbing Draught.’
‘Your… your cock,’ chuckled the boy, clutching his sides. Draco looked down, then up again. ‘It’s… it’s so…’ he faltered.
Draco was close too. ‘That’s all right, baby. Cum all over yourself,’ he said breathily.
‘Good,’ said Malfoy, and he wrapped his fingers around George’s length.
Harry’s voice had dropped again, into that realm of seductive warmth that Draco had never imagined he’d ever hear from the Boy Who Lived. He felt his body break out in a sweat as he strained against his bonds; strained to reach that voice … a voice with the richness of velvet and the allure of phoenix song. Draco became aware of the precum that had formed a puddle on his stomach.
‘Right, fuck this,’ said Draco adamantly. ‘At least do it properly.’ Getting up from his own sofa and walking over to Blaise, he grabbed the other Slytherin boy’s pants and pulled them right off, dropping them carelessly on to the floor. Blaise paused his motions for a second, reaching down to tug off his own black singlet at the same time. Draco, far hornier now than he had been all day, strolled back to his sofa and took a seat, removing the only clothing he had on – a pair of boxers and a tight grey long-sleeved T-shirt. His prick sprung to life the instant it was released, all six inches of it standing proudly at full mast and already beginning to drip with precum. His eyes glued to Blaise, he lowered a hand to his own cock and gripped it tight. Impatiently he began to jerk himself off at a daring pace, the sound of his wrist hitting his pelvis echoing throughout the room. Draco paid no attention to the amount of noise he was making, far too turned on to care. His breathing got heavier and more sporadic, and he swore loudly whenever he was close to an orgasm. With his left hand gripping his right pectoral and his right hand flying up and down his cock, he sat back and admired Blaise’s perfectly sculpted body; the arse cheeks that clenched together each time the body thrust forward, the rigid six-pack, the beautiful dark nipples and muscled arms, the strong and defined shoulders.
Harry was sure that she and Trelawney were taking bets on which of them would kill the other first.
Anyway, thank you so much for everyone who's read, left kudos, commented, etc. It's been a wild ride, but we're almost there, y'all.
The witch’s eyes flashed. “I admire your persistence, even if it is misplaced. Until next time, Mr. Potter.”
The Stunning Spell had worn off quickly, so Draco had given him a Simple Sleeping Draught to keep him out for longer. Harry slept with his mouth wide open, emitting an occasional grunt or whimper.
these last few years…
The Dursleys had already sent him a note, “
If Harry had known he was going to be snowed in at work, he would have hoped that it would be with Anna, who could make little pictures in the lattes. Or Martha, who always gave him chocolates.
“I’m sure you’ll think of a way,” said a voice. “He did.”
He swung his feet over his bed with a curse, hunting around for his shoes and socks. If Malfoy was gone, Harry knew exactly where he was.
"You like Hemingway?"
Draco shook his head, shutting the front door behind him and locking it with a spell. He had to see if Harry was alright. It Harry truly wanted him gone, he would be.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Potter.” Draco retorted, still staring at the ceiling.
As Harry watched, the dot that represented Malfoy got up and began to pace the library, going to a shelf and back again. All of a sudden, it started moving into the hall.
“I did it because I love you!”  Harry shouted.
It was his father after Azkaban, magnified.
Ron looked at him mournfully. “I’ve never felt so awful in my life. Even when they were torturing Hermione. Even with the Dementors. I’ve never felt so—helpless.” He put his head into his hands, and when he raised it again, his cheeks were streaked with tears and dirt. “How are we supposed to get out of here?”
Harry pushed his hands into his eyes until bursts of color appeared behind them. Draco had nearly killed Katie Bell, nearly poisoned Ron to death. And he’d set that trap for Dumbledore, at the top of the tallest tower, all because Voldemort would have killed his family otherwise…
"There's a lot of that going around." Harry called.
Harry thought for a moment. What was the incantation? Hermione had made him learn it for N.E.W.T.s, but he’d never been particularly interested, what with his possession of a Deathly Hallow and all.
“I’m a monster, Harry.” Draco said. “All I do is destroy, but I—I
Harry emerged from the trees, his phone clutched in his hand.
Cages lined the walls of the room. They had iron bars, like old prison cells, equipped with a mattress and a place for washing. Each cell was just barely wide enough for a person to lie down in, and they were packed close to one another like sardines.
Hermione shoved his legs off the table. “You have to help me.”
“When did you have time to get blood?”
But Ron but his head back in his hands, digging his palms into his eyes. “Where’s Hermione when you need her?”
They sat in silence again, but Harry could swear that there was less animosity between them than there had been. In the past, it felt like Draco spent every moment in a room with him wishing that he could walk out of it.
Hermione had told Draco that flying in a plane wasn’t much different than flying on a broomstick.
“Must have them spelled against it.
But Harry was still looking at him with that obnoxious expression on his face. Merlin, couldn’t Potter ever just leave it
Harry flipped through the channels and finally settled on an old episode of

"Oh."
and all the lights went out.
Harry thought about Draco’s insistence that he not bike home in the snow. There was something almost…sweet about it.
He turned to Draco. “Ten Galleons says I take down more guys than you,
“I know you’re going to do Dark Magic!”
Malfoy sneered, not even bothering to deny it. He knew they’d had someone following him. Thomas was always so sloppy. “Well, I can obviously get around that—”
“I will give you a thousand Galleons if you don’t finish that sentence.”
“Well, Percy also said that cauldron size is ‘one of the great crises sweeping the nation.’” Ron rolled his eyes.
Draco reminded himself.
Draco knew what he’d been asking. Harry had wanted him to go all in. He’d wanted more than back-corridor hookups and late nights.
magic.”
Harry glared at the glass, disgusted. He couldn’t be here. He couldn’t be seen here. These were exactly the kind fo selfish, sycophantic people who had cozied up to him the minute Voldemort’s body started to rot.  He couldn’t pretend to be one of them, nor could he pretend that so many of them had willfully ignored the call to fight when the Battle of Hogwarts began.
“Everyone knows you’re hot,
Harry was still shouting; he couldn’t help himself, and the kettle shrieked, sure to wake the neighbors, but he only shouted all the louder. “I’m afraid—I am--going to love you for the rest of my life.”
Granger transformed into the male wizard without much difficulty, though she’d been irritated that Draco hadn’t even managed to catch his name.
he breathed, “in my way.”
Draco hadn’t fucked him like he loved him. He hadn’t fucked him like someone who wanted a life with him, someone who wanted everything they’d seen in each other’s eyes, everything they’d felt the past few months. He’d fucked him like a dying man on his way to the gallows.
‘What the fuck?’ said George Weasley.
‘Why not?’
‘Harry, please,’ said Draco.
‘I meant with magic. We’re… well, we’re trying to make a range of snacks that’ll induce certain ailments, you know, to help kids skive off classes. We’ve almost perfected our range of
, unfortunately… but we really wanted to work on something along the breakfast line. You know,
Draco bent down, placing both of the wands on the marble floor beside him, and turned to look at Fred. Within seconds, Fred had repositioned himself on his back and was probing his hole with the tip of an index finger. Malfoy turned back to George, and slowly took the entire length of George’s member in his mouth. It was already glistening with Fred’s saliva, but Draco could taste the sweetness of George’s precum as well. George placed his hands on the back of the younger boy’s head and began to thrust with more aggression, crashing his manhood into Draco’s warm mouth. His pelvis slapped loudly against Draco’s face, the sound of skin-on-skin echoing through the room.
fit.’
It wasn’t until he had managed to catch his breath completely that Draco came to his most important realisation of the night. Sitting up slowly and bracing his muscled arms around his knees, he directed his thoughts for the first time towards his competition with Blaise. It hadn’t crossed his mind once since he first entered the Prefects’ bathroom, almost an hour ago. Since then, he had obviously shagged Fred… it surely wouldn’t matter that he had been on the receiving end… but he
He directed the fingers on his left hand towards her swollen clit, and began to stroke it forcefully. This seemed to be almost too much for Madam Pomfrey.
,’ yelled the blond boy, his wand pointed beneath his armpit. From the sound of Fred’s naked flesh hitting the water, and the slackening of the grip around his waist, Draco knew that his aim had been true. Turning around, he grabbed the redhead’s limp body and pulled it out of the water.
‘Come on, mate,’ said Blaise earnestly. ‘Don’t do that.’
The boy said nothing. Knowing there was already enough of Harper’s spit on his dick to enter the boy for the first time, Draco made his next move at an aggressive pace. Shoving his whole length into the insanely tight hole, the boy moaning loudly, Draco thrust his hips back and forward with immense force. If he’d thought Harper’s mouth had felt good, then his hole was heaven. The boy’s muscles contracted tightly around Draco’s prick, making him want to cum at every moment.
‘Because we both know you've got your balls buried in something twenty-four seven.’
‘I’ll curse you, probably,’ said George, pulling a wand from his pocket. Malfoy, however, was too fast. He picked his own wand up from the floor and pointed it at George.
‘I said to roll up your
And he started pointing and giggling, and Draco finally understood the punchline: it was his own shrivelled cock. His blood boiling, he looked at the kid and wished for an instant that he could make fun of the younger boy’s cock as well. But though it was also flaccid, Harper’s member had maintained its dignity and now lay flat against his leg.
‘What now, never seen someone wank before?’ Draco now asked the boy, aggravated that his orgasm was being delayed.
Blaise just tapped his nose twice, and picked up a book from his bedside table. Draco took in the front cover:
He drove slowly in and out of her for a few minutes before his hips began to gather speed. The matron seemed to be trying desperately to stifle her moans, but her efforts turned out to be futile. She grew louder and louder as his hips ground against her, his cock travelling deep inside her moist cunt.
Draco nodded. ‘Well, it works,’ he said, and he passed the parchment back to Blaise.
There were a few solitary golden curls at the hilt of Harper’s four-inch cock, but apart from that the boy was entirely hairless. His skin was smooth, tanned and, so it seemed in the candlelit room, practically reflective of the light. He had somewhat-defined muscles in his thighs, upper arms, and chest that other thirteen-year-olds would surely be jealous of, and his seated pose on the desk was, to Draco at least, infuriatingly arousing.
Then it came to him. Crossing to the other side of the desk again, doing his best to ignore Harper’s incessant laughter, he pushed the boy back down on the desk. He rubbed his prick vigorously, though it was already getting hard again at the prospect of what he was about to do. Harper looked confused, and then hungry. He licked his lips, which only made Draco angrier.
the fun. He stepped towards the two brothers and silently instructed Fred to retreat.
‘Nice clunge,’ said the blond boy, placing a hand on either side of her waist. She was squatting over his thighs now, still looking desperately down at his cock. Draco slid his cold hands down her sides and towards her arse cheeks, gripping these firmly so that she took a sharp intake of breath. Holding her from behind, he slowly pulled her closer towards his groin. Her pussy was gaping, as though it was begging to be filled by his pulsating member. Draco smirked, dimples manifesting on his boyishly handsome face. He positioned her over his cock. He could hear her every breath now. She looked briefly into his grey eyes, and then back towards the pink shaft of his cock, which was lying parallel with his torso, nestled between his abs.
‘Oh fuck off, you can’t say that,’ Blaise retorted.
Madam Pomfrey, who had been looking at a clock on the wall, straightened up and promptly stuffed the cork back into the empty phial.
Just as the Slytherin boy was considering wanking directly on to the Imperiused Fred’s face, the door to the fifth-floor corridor opened once again.
‘Explain what’s going on, one of you.’
‘Lots of things, Weasel. But I think if you let go of the bread, that would be a good start.’ Draco was thinking on the spot now. The ginger boy sure wasn’t Potter, but he was still tall and muscular and very hot.
‘And what do you mean, “make it worth my while”? Blaise?’
‘That was one bloody long wank,’ said Blaise, rolling over in his covers as soon as Draco arrived in their dormitory.
‘Only a bit,’ said Draco, unable to suppress a grin. ‘He wasn’t being very compliant, you see.’
‘Why do I need to wait for the potion to wear off?’ said Draco.
, realised Draco post-orgasm, still fumbling with his cock and watching in awe as Harper dragged his little tongue over the floor. Harper was, after all, pretty perfect. The boy’s body toned but cute, young but strangely masculine, Draco rather liked him. And it was a brilliant fuck – he already had the feeling that his cock would ache for days.
Draco’s back threw itself into the air and his cock began to shoot long, ropy strings of cum across his stomach. There seemed to be no limit to how much of the stuff could come out of him. Some of it shot out at odd angles, even landing either side of him on his sheets … sheets that were fast becoming coarser and wetter … sheets the colour of dark, green stone … sheets the colour of Potter’s eyes … dark, green eyes that Draco could swim in.
Then Draco was cumming, the pearly white liquid squirting out in globs all over Harper’s face. Some of it fell into the boy’s dark blonde hair, some of it on his eyelids and cheeks, and some of it dripped down his chin. The sensation of Draco’s warm cum hitting his face was enough to send Harper into his own climax. The boy released a similarly large load, this one showering his chest, and continued to probe his hole until he had finished completely. Draco let go of his not-entirely-flaccid cock and let it slap the kid’s forehead, moving his hips from side to side so that it wriggled all over Harper’s face, rolling in its own spunk. Harper started to sit up, and Draco took his cue to walk back to the other side of the desk, towards the door.
‘What d'you mean, "most likely"? Did you not see my whanger?’
Draco had been so focused on the pleasure that his cock was receiving, his eyes firmly shut in ecstasy, that he missed Fred’s next move entirely. The ginger boy had used all of his force to throw Draco off his back. Malfoy went splashing into the water, and by the time his head reached the surface again there was already a hand on his cock, and a strong arm wrapped around his torso.
‘That makes two of us.’
‘It’s no good,’ he groaned, rolling back over on to his side. ‘You’re too roomy.’
His voice trailed off as he wrapped a hand around his dick, palming it and stroking softly. He had originally planned to offer the boy somewhat more of an explanation, but the moment he sensed his groin receiving the attention it had been longing for, all attempts to string together a cohesive sentence had been swiftly abandoned.
‘Right. Sounds like you’ve got your work cut out for you,’ concluded Blaise.
like to watch Potter,’ interjected Blaise.
don’t have my cock balls-deep in a loaf of bread!’
Draco howled with pain and pleasure, annoyed that Fred had gotten the upper hand, but somehow enjoying the searing sensation in his behind. The ginger boy forced Malfoy against the edge of the pool, slamming his hips repeatedly into those supple, hairless buttocks. He squeezed Malfoy’s cock with every thrust, bringing both of them close to climax. After the first few times that Fred hit Draco’s prostate, however, the pleasure started to wear off for the younger boy. Fred moved seemingly faster and faster, and the soapy water was losing its appeal as a lubricant. The more pain Draco endured, the more Fred seemed to be enjoying himself.
‘No way, mate.’
Draco froze. He did not, at first, recognise the voice of the other Weasley twin. George sounded slightly out of breath, his speech more gravelly than usual, and Malfoy’s initial assumption was that a Prefect – or worse, a Professor – had entered the bathroom. He spun around, his cock quickly softening, to see a tall ginger boy standing alone in the doorway. Draco jumped to his feet, experiencing a sensation that felt almost like déjà vu… hadn’t he himself been standing there several minutes earlier? Originally it had been Fred who had stood fully naked in the middle of the bathroom, but now…
‘Very well,’ she said stiffly. ‘That should do the trick.’
‘Agh, yeah. Sorry about that one, mate.’
‘You’re actually going to go up there?’ said Blaise. ‘What if you’re caught?’
‘And you’re in your third year?’ spat Draco in mock-disbelief.
Draco didn’t wait for further instruction. Jumping at the chance, he went and stood at the end of the desk that the boy’s head was resting on. Still slamming his right hand up and down his rigid cock, he took the left one and rested it on the boy’s face, running his fingers down the boy’s forehead and cute little nose. The tip of his middle finger found the gap between Harper’s lips, and soon half of his hand had found its way into Harper’s mouth, the boy running his small pink tongue between each of Draco’s fingers, coating them all in saliva.
The light from his wand pointed towards a small piece of parchment on the bedside table. Blaise picked it up and forced it into Draco’s hands. Draco took it from him, lifting up Blaise’s duvet with his other hand and climbing into bed with the other boy. Now he could feel Blaise lying naked next to him.
nice ring to it. Have I gotten that right, or is it: “George the Grain Groper”?’
After a few minutes of this, Draco decided that it was time to switch things up: he didn’t want to cum too early and miss out on fucking her. He reached out with his left arm and pressed his palm against the matron’s forehead, forcing her away from his cock. Her lips were trembling, and she looked up at him with wide eyes. Glancing down at his prick, he saw that it was covered in a thick layer of her spit. He gripped it at the hilt with his numb hand and continued to play with it.
‘Yeah, but you can’t fuck your mum, can you?’ said Draco.
‘You’re a right knob,’ called Blaise as the blond boy made his exit. Draco looked back and caught a short glimpse of his friend pulling down his boxers and palming his thick cock. Maybe it would’ve been wiser just to stay and wank with Blaise. Draco was seriously starting to consider him one of the hottest males in the school, and he was
‘M-Malfoy?’ George stammered softly. And then Draco was kissing him, his fingers running through the older boy’s hair, his tongue darting sporadically forwards like a serpent. And George returned the passion: his lips locked tightly on to Draco’s, refusing to let go; his hands pressed against Draco’s taut pecs. The younger boy succumbed. His sole intention had been to woo George, but once again he had already lost himself to desire.
‘Do you want to watch me wank?’ he said. His cock was now so hard that it was beginning to cause him pain. When she gave yet another nod, Draco pulled down the thin white sheet that had been covering his lower body, followed by a pair of dark green boxers made from satin that shimmered brilliantly in the light. His boyhood sprung to life at once, throbbing in anticipation.
, he thought,
Each evening, he would be all ears for Blaise’s monologue about Daphne, but would follow it with taunts about his own headstart. Blaise would get horny, and the two of them would jerk off before heading up to bed for a few hours’ sleep. It was a great feeling to be ahead of Blaise so early in the game, but Draco was aware that it couldn’t last forever. Even if Blaise happened to fail at getting Daphne into bed with him, the second part of the bet required Draco to finish his shag-quest before the end of the school year – a goal he was beyond eager to fulfil, for he still couldn’t imagine what Blaise might’ve meant by ‘make it worth your while’.
Draco’s mood changed as quickly as if a Dementor had somehow entered the dungeons, casting an unpleasant chill over him. Here it was: the shit-coloured lining. Here was the thing he hated so much about students younger than himself. They were so fucking
It was exhausting to pretend to be better than your nature; it was why he’d joined the Death Eaters in the first place. Not betraying Potter had made his skin crawl.
“You lot are famous the world over, apparently. And Polyjuice Potion doesn’t even work on vampires. You’ll be my cousin, Abraxas.”
“No.” Harry lied. “I’ve never felt sorry for Draco Malfoy.
“You know full well I’m never going to read this,” Harry said.
"Yeah. Well. What if the grand gesture doesn't work? You say the words in the pouring rain, you hold up a boombox outside her window. You tell her everything she wants to hear, and you're gracious and kind and--it doesn't matter. Because the person she's supposed to be with--just isn't you."
Harry couldn’t understand why Draco hated him so much. With the other managers, Harry had never had a problem. Even Pansy, who everyone said was impossible, got on with him just fine. No one else seemed to be annoyed by him, to have a problem with the way he stacked the dishes or whistled while he waited for the espresso machine to warm up in the morning.
away?”
That’s the whole problem.”
“Knights don’t move vertical like that. You’re thinking of a castle.”
“I won’t get them infected. I’m certain of it.”
And who would he even save?
“Don’t we have to pay for these?” He saw Ron had already turned his on and was tapping on the screen with his fingertips in fascination. “Internet service, cell service, stuff like that?”
And here they were. He could see some red dirt through the narrow windows above their cells. They were underground, their cells seemingly carved into the rock itself and festooned with narrow iron bars across from them. Their wands, Ron’s Deluminator, and all of their other magical items were gone.
Malfoy was up to something. After all, it was spring break, and they’d all turned in that paper weeks ago. What was he researching now?
But Ariana had already turned and begun walking down the tunnel behind her portrait. The passageway opened, and it was clear she was done talking to him.
“Harry?” Hermione broke in, her voice high and thin.  “Harry—what happened? Where is he?”
“I—this isn’t about her. Do you want to drink my blood or not?”
“Aren’t they on our side?”
They sat in silence for an entire episode and halfway through the next, before Draco got up and stretched. "I'm gonna make a breakfast sandwich." He said. "You want one?'
He simply reached around Harry, the wool of his sweater brushing against Harry's chest, and withdrew the chess set. He smelled like a combination of mint and coffee beans, and Harry felt something inside him tighten at his closeness.
McGonagall conjured two severe-looking, high backed chairs. “Sit.”
Draco snapped himself back into the present. “Sorry, Professor. I was distracted.”
"But I only live a half mile away.” Harry hauled his bike up and tried to roll it, then nearly fell as he slid on the ice again. “I can walk--"
But Hermione hadn’t let him. She’d just gripped his wrist whenever he made to get out of his seat, shooting him furious glares out of the corner of her eye.
"Harry," Draco breathed. "I don't hate you.
Draco was getting desperate. He was down to his final blood bag, and he felt constantly weak and exhausted. It didn’t help that he was having to eat normal food so often; which tasted like sawdust.
Harry didn't know what made him do it, but he reached across to grab Draco's chin and force his head up, so that he was looking Harry in the eyes "Do I look afraid to you?" Harry asked.
Harry shouted at his back.
Draco took a sip, refusing to take the bait. “Why would I lie?”
“Goodbye,” Harry finished. He put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, but the other boy shrugged it off. His eyes were on the ground.
He chewed his lip, which was still plump from sucking the blood out of his last victim. He’d nearly killed the bloke, taken his blood beyond what a Blood Replenishing Potion could remedy.
“A vampire.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. "I don't hate you."
"You're funny." Harry pressed on. "And you never make me work late when we work together, and you made sure I was okay in the storm, and sometimes I think--" he stopped.
As the silence stretched between them, the days lengthening, Draco had clung to that connection, the only proof of what had passed between them, that it hadn’t been a dream or his own wishful thinking. A connection that would never be severed.
“Yes,” McGonagall said. “It seems that you could be, were you to be in a place heavily trafficked, like Kings Cross station, recently.”
Draco looked into her brown eyes, remembering all the times he’d spat at her. Called her ‘Mudblood’ and worse. Laughed while Snape mocked her, done his best to make her feel small.
He raced to the seventh floor, praying that Malfoy wouldn’t vanish off the map before he got there. He’d learned his lesson from his past attempts: if you didn’t know exactly what  you wanted the Room of Requirement to become, it would remain locked.
He’d been rationing his blood for a day, and he was already so
Now that Draco thought about it, he
And when he’d woken, he was so…hungry.
“Really? So why bother asking me? Why not just clamp me in irons and put me in Azkaban?” He could be so frustrating sometimes, and so beautiful, and Draco was fairly sure that if he kept staring at him with his muscles looking like
McGonagall was about to say something else, but Draco interrupted her. “When can I go?”
And the warm taste of blood.
"Not really." Harry shrugged. "You?'
Eventually, he’d managed to control it. He’d snuck the books up to his room, the ones from the depths of his father’s library, done even more research at Hogwarts. He knew the rules: spell a piece of jewelry to walk in the Sun. Don’t get too upset, or your fangs will show. Stay in big populations, where you won’t be noticed. Replenish the blood when you’re done. Wipe their memory. Heal the bitemarks. Disappear.
“You have already been exposed. That means you continue to be contagious, particularly if you develop symptoms. Mr. Longbottom has removed the traces from your skin, but your cough, your saliva, will all contain traces of the virus for the next few days.”
“I don’t need an iPhone.” Harry said. “I’m fine with communicating by owl.
Ron’s brow furrowed. “Right. Yeah. It’s just—usually I can feel our link.” He held up his necklace for Harry’s inspection. “The magic links us to each other, kind of like with the Deluminator. But since—since we got here, I’ve felt—nothing.”
Draco's eyes darkened, but he didn't say a word.
He’d snapped into reality, terror freezing his arousal in its tracks. Potter was sagging against him.  He’d passed out. And he was so pale—
Harry knew it was about Fred’s death, reconciling with Percy, trying to heal from all of the wounds that were still fresh after Voldemort’s defeat, even though it had been nearly a year. But it still stung when Ron had awkwardly said he wasn’t invited—the Weasleys had always considered Harry family before, what was so different now?
of her blood as it splattered across the floor.
And finally,  to Ted Cruz and Governor Abbott and every other Republican in Texas who got us into this mess:  kiss my ass. :)
“I don’t need anything from you or your filthy Mudblood friends,” Draco hissed, gathering up his papers.
He hadn’t found anything to complain about whenever he’d seen his side, at least, which Harry had thoughtfully adorned with Slytherin hangings and a picture of his family.
"Fine." Harry grabbed the bottle and drank, wincing at the burn of alcohol down his throat. "I guess we're going to just have to get drunk in silence. Hemingway style."
Draco rolled over, propping his head up with one hand. That effort alone exhausted him; he’d become so weak. The thought of Harry offering, of finally wanting what Draco himself had dared to want, was making him even more light-headed.
Harry opened his mouth to tell Ron more, but before he could, the door burst open. Before either of them could react, Harry felt the Freezing Charm take hold of him.
After all, it would be antithetical for Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter to have anything in common, even accidentally.
"Here."
His arms, impossibly strong, pinned Harry, nipping at his lips until he drew blood.
Draco said nothing to that. Potter’s heart was racing, and Draco’s fangs were starting to descend. He looked down for a moment, trying to control himself. “Whatever, Harry.” He said. “You’re always the better person. Happy?”
And that’s when Draco lost it. “Of course I am! Because Merlin forbid I do anything worthwhile with my life. Merlin forbid I do anything decent. I saved your life. I saved your
Draco went silent.
Draco closed his eyes. “I’m not a bloodhound, Granger.”
destroy.” Draco said. “You know that.”
.” He turned.
There was a mysterious fog clouding his vision. Black and thick like smoke; he groped through it. Sound was muffled, but he could hear the edges of a conversation. The clatter of dishes and plates.
Harry had kissed him back, and in their bed, it had been hard to imagine that anything could separate them.
And Harry was a heartbeat behind him, hot on his heels as their steps clattered upward.
And he certainly wasn’t going to reveal what happy memory he had relied on, either.
The Room of Requirement had suffered Fiendfyre damage when Harry had fought Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle for the Horcrux hidden there. It had also been the site of Harry’s D.A. meetings, which Draco and the Inquisitorial Squad had broken up under Umbridge’s sadistic tutelage.
“What are you doing in the Room of Requirement?” Potter looked a little embarrassed at being caught, but his self-righteousness won out, like always.
“I seem to recall a certain beautiful Weasley girl thinking exactly that about you.”
He’d sent owls to Draco, of course he had.
him. Declared unilaterally that he’d risk everything. The moment they’d shared, through the bond, battling through the cadre of guards that faced them, was enough to assail Harry’s fears, to show him that Draco was all-in.
Ron and his family were doing a retreat, a personal trip to talk about ‘family matters.’
But what if it didn’t matter that they loved each other? What if Draco’s grand gesture was too little, too late?
“Somebody out here’s hunting wizards,” Draco said.
“I asked Hermione to help me do it!” Harry blurted.
Draco put his hand over his eyes and took deep breaths, forcing the images out of his head.
So why all this time in the library? Why was he always pacing the Slytherin common room late at night, as though puzzling out some great mystery?
“I don’t back down,” Draco said, even though the fear and adrenaline had him shaking. “Not anymore.”
“This isn’t about the rules, Malfoy. It’s about keeping other people safe.”
Lucius had
He’d even raided a few Muggle hospitals, and he still had some bags stashed in a refrigerated, concealed section of his trunk. A simple Undetectable Extension Charm, and he had enough blood to last him weeks.
“You don’t understand. I’m a monster. If my father knew about this, if anyone—” Draco felt tears spring to the corners of his eyes. He laid back on his bed and stared at the ceiling, so that Harry wouldn’t see.  “You have to promise.”
He couldn’t keep his eyes open.
Draco looked down. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
His muscles burned, and his chest ached. He still felt weak and exhausted, and even though his wand was in his hand, there was no magic to be had.
Draco offered his arm, and they stepped into the crushing darkness together.
“I had to.”
Luckily, everyone seemed to engrossed in their own activities to notice him, at least for now. Most of them had barely glanced in his direction when he came in, and the lighting was dark enough that he didn’t look quite as distinctive as he  normally did.
“It doesn’t even work! The Fiendfyre—”
“I see.” Draco kept his expression neutral, even though his hands were nearly shaking with rage. “So you
“From what I understand, most wizards are naturally immune to Muggle diseases. But these travel advisories will be particularly inconvenient.” She drummed her fingers on the table. “I wonder if I could cast some sort of protective charm on Mum and Dad,” she mused. “Perhaps the library…”
There was no way anyone would think to look for him here.
He texted his mother,
Draco had forgotten that Hermione hated flying on broomsticks.
Harry frowned. “Maybe there’s someone in the castle. Someone we can get you to—”
Hermione smirked, and Draco blushed. “I mean, just when we were in quarantine. It was a bit annoying, actually.”
With a flash, Draco remembered the Battle of Hogwarts again, the frenzy that overtook him as he ripped into wounded victim after wounded victim, feeding and feeding, his vision tinted red, seeing nothing but paper-thin flesh, veins like underground springs begging to be tapped.
“Ignore him,” Pansy Parkinson snapped. “Blaise, why don’t you stick that perfect nose in someone else’s business?”
It didn’t matter; his father had rushed to the gate anyway, his wand and the moonlight lighting his way, not even bothering to comment on Draco’s inability to create a corporeal Patronus, an ability the rest of his family had easily recovered after Voldemort’s death.
Even now, Harry approached her with a certain wariness. He didn’t know what she would say to him, if her portrait truly interacted with others the way other magical paintings did. After all, Ariana had been sickly, damaged by the assault she’d undergone as a child. Perhaps the only person she spoke to was Aberforth…
Draco, as it turned out, was
"I'm sure it'll come on soon," Harry said.
“I know you’re there, Potter. You have two seconds to take off that bloody cloak before I take it from you.”
"So--"
“I’m not drinking from you, Potter. I won’t give you the satisfaction.”
“Remember how I said we wouldn’t last two days without Hermione?” Ron called from his cell. “It’s been three days.”
"Other people." Harry said. "Love. Friendship. Joy."
“Do you want to—” Harry asked, not sure what he was asking, but he didn’t have time to figure it out. Draco had already crushed his lips to his.
The cowboy held the scepter to Hermione’s head. “I don’t know how you tricked our guards into letting you go,” he said. “But it won’t happen again. You’re a Mudblood. You aren’t leaving this room alive.”
But watching Harry, ruffled and nervous in his work robes, it was Draco who felt like the breath was stolen from his chest.
Harry raised his hand to his lip. Felt the tiny puncture Draco had made through his lower lip. It was already starting to swell.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Absolutely not. No traffic lights, idiots who don't know how to drive, iced roads that haven't been treated. You're staying here."
“Why do I have to keep you from leaving? You could infect your mother—you know that, right?” Harry said.
Footsteps approached the door, slow and heavy.
“A monster.” Draco finished bitterly. “But I’m alive. I’m

“I’m always right about you.” Harry retorted. “I always know when you’re up to something!”
“Maybe if I went to McGonagall—”
“They aren’t expecting us until seven. Besides, I’m Draco Malfoy. You think I’m going anywhere in
Malfoy took his mouth off of the man’s neck and looked Harry up and down, a sly grin curling across his features. “Harry,” he purred.
Draco's eyes flashed, but he was silent as Harry went on. " I love my adopted parents, but—no matter how much someone loves you, sometimes they just die on you.  Or they leave. Everyone leaves, one way or another. So what's the point of getting close to anybody? What's the use in all that hurt?" Harry stopped himself from going on, trying to blink away the tears. What was wrong with him? He
Only, he was near to running out. He’d been planning to raid a few Muggle hospitals over the break, but now…
Sometimes the memories were too painful to bear; it was like remembering a long-lost friend. He’d thought he’d been shrouded in darkness then, but he’d give anything to have the problems he’d thought so insurmountable at 15.
Draco turned back to him, curled his lip. And only a hint of what had passed between them colored his voice when he said, “You think
“You fought your way free?” Draco said, shocked. “How many of them were there?”
him? He’s a slimy git.”
Wasn’t that what he wanted?
Draco ignored him. "We're supposed to be closed." Draco shook his head. "Why the Hell corporate would even make me come into this godforsaken--"
Draco shrugged. "Helped me."
better off…”
After a few moments, Harry was satisfied that there was nothing, or no one, else in the bar.
Malfoy claimed to be reformed, but Harry hardly believed it.
He just knew he was so
“They took our magic.” Ron held up the rod. “I don’t know if there’s a way to get it back. I think—it’s gone.”
"Right." Harry looked up the number and dialed. He listened to the automated voice on the phone. "Just says they're aware of outages." he said. "But it's not looking good."
He’d thought no one would notice.
"Oh, hell no," said a voice, and Harry looked up to see Draco, sliding a foot experimentally across the ice. He looked over at his car, an old Mustang, which was caked in snow and ice. "Shit." He said. "Shit, shit, shit."
He felt as though it would never be enough.
It was all such a fucking joke. His parents needn’t worry. No disease, magical or otherwise, would ever affect him again.
The witch flicked her wand, and Ron slumped against the wall, shrieking in pain. “Your Mudblood friend was of no use to us. We disposed of her.”
that he
“Maybe because being in a tin can thousands of meters in the air is a stupid way to die?”
It scared him that he wanted it to happen again.
Draco sighed. The color in his cheeks had turned a darker pinkish red since the vodka, and he looked tired and soft all of a sudden, as though the alcohol and the rush of the game had worn his hard places away.
He got to his feet just as Draco attacked, launching himself at the witch. They went down in a flurry of tangled limbs, and Harry felt a sudden burst of wet warmth as her blood splashed across his face.
This stupid school, Potter and his friends. No one ever cared what he felt. No one gave him the benefit of the doubt.
But for Harry and Draco, this moment was an iridescent, gleaming glass landscape, set upon the mantle. Nothing less than a snow globe, frozen in shining time.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Typical.”
“A filthy half-breed.” Draco said bitterly. “A vampire.”
Had he loved Harry for his entire life?
“Malfoy? Something you want to say?” Harry snapped his fingers.
A tall wizard with silver streaks in his hair met them at the entrance. He was dressed in a pewter gray suit, paired incongruously with cowboy boots and hat, and he had a piece of grass stuck between his teeth. “Evenin’” he said as they approached, offering his hand for Draco and Hermione to shake. “Name’s Heath Bolton.”
Harry was about to say something when McGonagall’s voice sounded, magically magnified so that it resonated throughout the castle:
“Potter, you really shouldn’t tell him our evil plan.” The witch leaned against the wall casually, her eyes hooded and dangerous.  “It changes, you see.”
For a moment, he didn’t remember what had happened. Didn’t remember why he felt so exhausted, why his eyes felt sticky and puffy, as though he’d been crying—
“Stop!” Draco shouted, blocking Potter’s Stunning Spell. “Let me explain.”
“So the magic’s gone?’ Harry asked. “My magic? I’m—a Muggle?”
"I'm going to put you on kitchen duty." He gestured to the plates and mugs stacked in the sink. "Try not to break anything."
“But he still died.” Draco said.
Hermione looked at him for a long while. “Harry wouldn’t want you to kill anyone.”
"When was that?"'
Could it be? His wand was laying on the floor, within easy reach. Someone must have dropped it! Steeling himself, Harry reached through the bars, groping desperately.
me—if you want this all to—stop, I understand. But I—I’m going to fucking love you until the end of my immortal existence. When this city crumbles to dust, I will love you from the ashes. But I understand if I’m not what you want, and I’ll go away—”
“You aren’t starving us.” Harry said. “You obviously need us for something.”
The fuzziness turned to a velvety soft blackness, taking over Harry’s vision bit by bit until he finally sank into it, and knew nothing more.
“Yes, Professor,” Harry mumbled.
“How dare you—"
“My mum died,” Draco muttered. “Git.” This was exactly why he didn’t want to go to this party. Too many people only grateful for what they had gained. Too many people joyful at reuniting.
Harry saw a single tear splash onto the pavement.
Hermione let out a huff of frustration. “We need to focus. If we get caught or killed—”
Ron crumpled on the floor in a heap, sobs wracking through him, “Hermione,” he kept murmuring, over and over.
Glitter floated through the air, and the floor he walked upon had been enchanted to glow alternating colors, expanding and contracting like a disorienting kaleidoscope.  To one side of the entryway stood the bar, with brightly colored drinks that glowed and fizzled in their glasses. Most of the clubgoers were dressed in typical Muggle clothes, and they seemed to be having the time of their lives, chattering and laughing uproariously, their voices drowned out by the thumping music.
What would Potter do, now that he knew what Draco was? What he had become?
Draco loved to watch Harry when no one was looking, when Harry himself didn’t even notice.
“I--didn’t know. Hermione never told me--”
And then they were kissing. Kissing like their lives depended on it, like they might disappear if they fell apart. Draco’s fangs caught on the edge of Harry’s lips, and he flicked his wand to stop the kettle as it screamed so that they would be the only noise, inside and out, bursting through his chest, a dam that had suddenly broken, a tidal wave of warmth rushing through him, so intense it brought tears to his eyes.
They slipped in silence. “So—who’s taking the photo?”
“We’ve been testing the effects on wizards, as well. Purely for research purposes, of course. I myself have been able to imbibe wizarding magic, and even do a thing or two with it that I never could before.”
Draco snorted. “You think that was for
But Potter, dammit, still wouldn’t
The Vanishing Cabinet?
Draco felt like crying. “I
“What did you give him?”
“Can we dispense with the history lesson and get to the point?” Draco asked, wiping the blood from his face with a spell. He waved his wand, and the wound in Hermione’s face began to knit closed. He waved his wand again, and the blood vanished. “You’re likely to faint from blood loss any minute anyway.”
Harry bit his lip. Who was she to lecture him like a child, after what he’d done? He could probably walk into the Auror office now and be handed a job, why did he even bother—
“I’m not. Listen to me.”
Harry looked at him for a long moment, his chest aching. "Well," he said quietly. "I don't think you're a placeholder, if that's any consolation."
What was even more unsettling was the obvious misery on their faces. There was no getting out for them, and they knew it. It was the kind of desperation Draco had seen on Ollivander’s face, while he awaited Voldemort’s questioning. It was something he’d never hoped to see again.
McGonagall sighed, exasperated. “Draco, you are one of the brightest students in your year. If you believe this so ardently, you must have a prevailing scientific reason, an awareness of some magic that protects you. What is that magic?”
“It’s just that Mum—she doesn’t want you to feel guilty. And I know you will.”
He was going to kill my family.”
Then he remembered.
Draco was going to say more, but he couldn’t, because Harry had reached between them and
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He, too, was trying to reconcile with all the lives he couldn’t save, the lives he
“Wet?”
“We ought to prepare for the worst. Gather the teachers here, and you may stay as Head Boy. Potter and Malfoy, you are dismissed, and not a word to anyone.”
The Hog’s Head had even more dust than usual on its tables, and it was easy for Harry to see where Malfoy had been. He had left a clear trail through the floor, the sweep of his dressing gown an obvious sign.
Draco wondered what his father would think if he saw him now. Lucius Malfoy didn’t come to the Ministry very often these days—everyone who had sucked up to him had been thoroughly relieved of their position under Shacklebolt’s regime.
And neither did Draco.
“Don’t come any closer.” Malfoy pressed himself against the wall. “Quarantine.”
Just as Draco finished his sentence, there was a buzzing noise, and the lights flashed back on. There was a roar as the heater coughed back to life.
"More than my
Draco could smell his blood, feel the heat that radiated from his skin. He could hear Potter’s heart speed up, a withering drum of rhythm and excitement.
"Dear God, why?'
“Fuck!” Pansy rushed to stop the bleeding. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
seem like Malfoy’s scene.  He leaned in close to the waitress, until he saw her eyes catch on the scar across his forehead. Her mouth fell open into a perfect ‘O.’ “I’m looking for someone. Blonde hair, snooty expression? Slytherin?”
“So you
‘Our waiter managed to Disapparate when it went south. His friends weren’t so lucky. He found their bodies a few miles away three days later. Been hiding ever since. Wizards and Muggles are disappearing daily, usually the ones nobody will miss—runaways, showgirls, stage magicians—the kind desperate enough for money or fame that they’d follow someone into the desert.”
And he was getting so thin. There were hollows under his ribs, and his veins stood out purple against the skin of his forearms. His muscles flexed and slid as he moved with graceful precision, like a trained dancer.
Ron did not return.
In spite of the fact that the Hogwarts castle was enormous, their paths were constantly overlapping. He’d come down to the Great Hall for breakfast, and Draco would be wolfing down a piece of toast. He’d arrive at the Quidditch pitch for a workout, and Draco would already be out flying over the hoops. He’d go to the library to research infectious diseases (at Hermione’s direction), and Malfoy was already there, his nose in a book with an indecipherable title.
And there was Malfoy, pacing in front of a seemingly blank stretch of wall, his face contorted in concentration.
“Same problem as going out there. Contamination. Infection.”
Was this a trap?
When Dijikistra gestured to Harry’s cell, a triumphant grin on her face, Malfoy kept his face cool and neutral.  Harry was crouched against the wall, seemingly asleep, but Malfoy could tell by the tension thudding through their connection that he was wide awake.
“I’m assuming that’s why you’re doing this.” Draco looked around. “Do you want me to kiss you? It would make that Weasley girl
"It's the only two player game here besides poker and Go Fish." Harry said. "And I hate Go Fish, and I don't understand Poker."
He got up and walked over to Harry, then took his hand. Harry tried to ask a question, but Draco shushed him, which was probably for the best. At the touch of his hand, Harry's brain had completely shut off. He didn't think he could string a sentence together.
“How could you have flown the Thestral at that height? Your body would not withstand it—”
Draco had stood in the corner, inspecting his nails and ensuring that there was no blood left anywhere else on his person, doing his best to look unbothered by the fact that everyone seemed to be ignoring him. Thankfully, Hermione easily redirected all of the questions aimed at the state of Madame Dijikstra.
Draco was silent; he just gestured at Harry to continue, his cheeks flushed with excitement.
"But the panini press is better." Draco flashed him a quick grin, and Harry had to grip onto the table from the force of it.
Harry awoke with a start, fighting off the grip of nightmares. It was still dark; nearly 2am, and dawn was a long way from arriving over the horizon.
Maybe he and Draco had experienced too much death to ever heal from it. Maybe the scars that the war had left would only ever bleed again. Maybe they were both too damaged, too broken and sunken into the rubble for normal life to ever lift them out of it—
“I have undergone a power transfer recently. You see, I realized something—” she waved her wand, and the snakes disappeared. She sank gracefully to the ground, her dress merely fabric again. “Why should we only be getting this power from Muggleborns, who of course have no right to their magic, no natural ability. Why not get a few subjects who are more—
In spite of Harry and Draco’s resistance, the lines between them were becoming increasingly blurred. It seemed like it took a lot more effort to stay apart than to be together.  Draco was studying a Switching Spell for N.E.W.T.s, and he needed someone to practice on  (at first, Harry had been supremely resistant to this; letting Draco curse him went against everything he had learned since the age of eleven), and Harry had wanted to practice levitation…
He felt the curious, cold feeling immediately, like an egg had been cracked over his head. He held his hand in front of his face, and he could see only the wall behind it.
“Because you’re going to go in there, grab Harry, and leave Ron to die.”
be infected.”
“Hogwarts will always be a safe place,” McGonagall agreed. “Though I can’t imagine families won’t want to see their children now more than ever. Has anyone—how severe are the symptoms?”
McGonagall sighed, running a hand across her face. “Very well. I will send a message to the students’ families that they can be expected tomorrow morning.”
“You know, I’m so relieved that the myth about vampires and mirrors turned out not to be true.” Draco shuddered. “I don’t know what I would have done.”
fucking
And Potter was the same place he’d always been: in the way.
“I’m sorry, Mate,” Ron put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, clearly misinterpreting his distress.
he’d pass out. Or kill him.
But why had Draco wanted to leave? Harry closed his eyes, trying to ignore the pain. McGonagall had entered, said she had a message for Malfoy. Harry was feigning sleep; he’d woken up not long before that, feeling like he was resurfacing after a long time spent underwater.
“Well, I suppose you
"Yeah. I can see that." Harry said. He got up from table and wandered over to one of the velvet couches, as far away from Draco as he could get. He flicked the TV to the local weather channel.
And it all seemed so impossible.
"Maybe start with 'what's your favorite color'. You're not getting the gossip out of me that easy."
Hermione sighed.  “He hasn’t been—right –since the war. None of us have, but for Harry, it got worse after graduation.” She eyed Draco speculatively. “He’s really lonely, and he won’t

“Every day. I had a stash saved up, but—” Draco gestured helplessly at their surroundings.
is trash."
"Shouldn't you be focusing on the game?' Draco moved his knight, and one of Harry's bishops fell. "Looks like you'll need it."
“You aren’t going anywhere.” Harry said. “It’s too dangerous.”
“Better.” Harry finished.
The dark-haired figure to the left of Percy Weasley was barely recognizable. A shade of stubble shadowed his jaw, and he seemed to have spent a lot of time exercising outdoors, if the thick muscles that slid beneath his white robes and his tan were of any indication.
“Not only are we in the midst of a global pandemic,” Lucius hissed. “But your mother’s condition—”
“And no one came for you? They just let you leave and bring backup? Tell the world of their evil plan?”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione’s voice came sharply over the divide, and she emerged a moment later, causing Ron to whirl in panic. “Hermione,” he said, half-amused, half-exasperated. “This is the
Draco raised an eyebrow. “What happens in quarantine, stays in quarantine. I don’t kiss and tell.”
Draco took one step away from the door. He arched an eyebrow, struggling to maintain his bravado. “Why? Afraid I would unduly influence Auror investigations?”
And when Harry finally said “Yes,” and Draco he got to his feet and pulled Harry into a kiss, it wasn’t the shouts of the photographers, the gasps of Hermione and Ron, or the murmurs Harry made against his mouth, that he heard. He didn’t hear the adoration, or the disapproval, or even Luna’s, calm and steady,
“I’m listening! Tell me your grand explanation for trying to kill that guy last night!”
"Yeah?"
Harry climbed the stairs, his feet pounding on the rungs, feeling the music pulse through his body, along with the rising surge of his hatred.
He thought.
“Look.” Draco turned to him. “I’m going. You can either get out of my way, or I can make you.” His fangs slid down over his lips.
Draco was dimly aware that they’d collapsed on the bed, that Harry was kneeling between his legs while he was flat on his back, that they’d lost their shirts, that Draco’s sweats were already pulled down to his ankles. Feverishly, Draco kicked them off and completely pushed Harry off of him, his skin burning with need and
“You don’t
"Wait til I tell the guys!"
“You’re not supposed to know about that.” Hermione looked from side to side, as though she were worried about them being seen. “Can we go somewhere?”
however, are using something even more sinister, subtle and effective. Science.”
“Tell me again why we’re taking a
"Huh?" Draco sat back for a moment, the haze of concentration lifting from his eyes.
“Did you honestly expect Draco Malfoy to show up to his own press conference on time?” Hermione looked thoroughly unperturbed as she examined the sparkling engagement ring on her finger. “I don’t see why you have to make an announcement anyway. It’s none of their business.”
“Merlin, Granger? You were too worried to shower?”
"I wouldn't call you a loser." Harry said. "Technically, you're my boss."
“I had to come!” Draco protested. “She’s dying.”
Maybe they were too damaged to be close to anyone else, to feel close to someone ever again, but at least they understood each other.
“You told me to earn you,” Draco said finally, his voice shaking. “You said I had to win you back, and I was afraid. I thought it was safer to be alone. I pushed you away. I told you that loving me is your destruction, and you came on anyway, so I said—awful things. And I’m—”
For a heart-stopping moment, he thought the pain came from his scar. He lurched to his feet, groping desperately for his wand, thinking of the graveyard and Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort—
“Potter wouldn’t know a moral grey area if it hit him in the face.” Draco said. “Stopping me is the right thing to do. Always.”
Draco had gone to the fountain at the back of the property, overgrown and ill-kept since his mother’s death. Lucius had only bothered to maintain the greenery around the walking trails, and all manner of birds and other creatures flitted in and out of the fountain. Beetles crawled on the ground; it looked like the fish within had begun to reproduce, and there was moss staining the edges of the white marble.
“You—created these snakes?” Hermione said from beside him. Her wand was out, and she was speaking without taking her eyes off the snakes. “How? Magic cannot create living things!”
They worked around each other in almost complete silence, save for the ambient sounds of the café’s indie playlist. Harry hated the quiet--he missed Anna's relentless chatter, or Ron's attempts to create new songs over the 'deep, introspective melodies. He missed being able to
“I can do whatever I need to protect the safety of my students, Mr. Malfoy.” McGonagall’s voice rang out, and a moment later she appeared at the top of the staircase, her emerald robes swirling behind her. “I will send you and Potter supplies.”
"Fine." Draco said, his eyes meeting Harry's with something like a challenge. "But I get black."

“I asked her to.”
For the first time, a look of pure anguish crossed Harry’s face. The sight almost made Draco drop his wand, almost made him rush in and take Harry in his arms, smash his lips to his again, because it was the only thing that ever felt right.
And one knew that he didn’t really sleep. That he’d stopped caring when McGonagall brought news of the virus. That he didn’t bother to even check his watch for the passage of time.
“Something’s blocking my spells!” Harry said. “Do you know how to undo that sort of thing?”
Harry nearly let out a shout when Draco emerged, followed by a tall, handsome stranger. He bit his knuckles in an effort to keep silent, adjusting his position so that they’d still know he was sleeping.
“A nice little cocktail. Veritaserum, mixed in with some other stuff. He’ll have a terrible headache tomorrow, and he won’t remember a thing.” Draco smiled widely. “It’s a concoction of my own creation.”
“What is this?”
"Sure." Harry got up from the tv and went to the bathroom. When he came out, Draco was busying himself at the panini press, bending down so that he could make sure the bread was being pressed evenly.
“There are Caterwauling and anti-Apparition Charms around Hogwarts and the whole of the surrounding communities.” McGonagall said. “You will not leave this castle undetected.”
“Nothing important.” Harry looked up at the ceiling, where the camera rested. He was pretty sure that they could hear what he was saying.
He went to the portrait of Ariana. She looked at him blankly, nearly as frozen as the Muggle photos.
And Harry knew no more.
Potter had always thought of Draco as a monster, someone concerned with only his own gain and saving his own skin, no matter who bled as a result.
,” Draco said, making sure his voice carried so that Harry, Ron and Hermione could hear it all the way across the Great Hall, “For the students who have to stay here over spring break because they’re not
And then he attacked.
“I figured you’d want to get away from the crowd.” Harry emerged from behind the trees, his feet scuffing the ground. “You’re easy to follow for a vampire.”
“What. Do. You. Want?”
Harry murmured.
“Are you finally going to kill me?” Draco said, leaning against the back of the chair. “It’s about time.”
“Harry, you saved the Wizarding World. It’s not like they’re going to fail you. Besides, what if this thing lasts long? You don’t want to be here by yourself!” Ron was more earnest than the situation demanded, and Harry knew that he just still felt bad about uninviting him to his family’s.
at him.
“The pioneers of society were always the bravest, the reckless and unencumbered. Some said they were crazy. But sanity is the price of progress.” The cowboy said.
The woman spoke, and there was a flash of light.
When the sandwiches were ready, Draco grabbed them both some waters, and they sat down on the same velvet couch Harry had occupied earlier, side by side. Draco crossed his legs, his knee barely brushing the edge of Harry's thigh.
But if Harry was dead...
"Like?"
They worked in silence beside each other for a while, using a couple of the emergency flashlights to light the area.
He had it!
“No, Potter.” Draco retorted sarcastically. “I’m going to sit here like a good little idiot and do exactly as I’m told.”
Typical of Potter to wear
“They can’t have taken our magic permanently,” Harry said. “It’s part of us. We
“Nothing, Harry okay? I’m a bloodsucking monster, which you’ve probably thought since I was eleven anyway, so—”
Draco opened the door, casting one last glance Harry’s way. “Aren’t you even going to walk me out? You
They chuckled. “I thought you’d say that.” Bolton said. “Which is why I told Diane we had to
Harry couldn't believe what had happened.  Draco had gone from barking orders at him to---sitting down to a meal? Fixing him a sandwich?
“Aren’t they a bit concerned that there’s someone experimenting on Muggles in the Nevada desert?”
“Who?”
Harry smiled in memory, though. The D.A. meetings had been some of the best moments of his life, the ones where he really felt like he was doing something useful, contributing outside the influence of Dumbledore or any of the other adults who sought to run his life.
“Ron, let me hit him!” Hermione pointed her wand at the pair, but they were wrestling too closely.
“He left not very long ago.” Ariana said.
Harry shrugged. He hadn’t really thought about Malfoy. Any more than usual. Today.
“It has been since the Second War ended.” Harry said. “And when I get out of here—”
And Harry, who couldn't wait one more second, twisted his fists up in Draco's sweater and pulled him down, so that Draco's mouth slanted across his.
“Deal.” Harry pushed past her and began to shove his way through the crowd, which finally thinned out as he approached the staircase. He held onto the railing as he climbed the steps, looking around to make sure no one was watching him.
Lucius had chosen to walk away when Draco got like this over the past month or so. Even during the end of the quarantine, when Draco refused to take a walk outside, to visit his mother’s grave, just below the peonies that she’d insisted Lucius plant just in front of the living room window when they had gotten married, no matter that they “ruined the whole aesthetic.”
“No! I—I won’t.”
Eventually, Draco’s sobs had subsided, and he was leaning into Harry’s touch, staring vacantly into space, when the Healer had walked in. She said someone about making arrangements, decisions to be made, events to plan, and Harry had been ushered out of the room.
At least his father hadn’t told anyone about his condition. The scandal would be far too disastrous.
fancy you. At all.” It was getting harder and harder to say those words. Draco wished Potter would just stake him and get it over with.
“They need money a lot more than they’re letting on,” Draco said to Hermione out of the corner of his mouth, keeping his eyes locked on the couple ahead of them.
“Can’t trust you.” Potter hissed, but he’d stopped casting and only circled Draco warily, his wand pointed at his chest.
Before Harry could answer, the door burst open.
to anyone.”
Asleep, he had that same air of deliberate, effortless movement. His chest rose and fell delicately, and the shadows beneath his eyes had sharpened.
"I don't like having something I said to someone in confidence become everyone’ favorite daytime soap opera." He moved his bishop and took out another of Harry's pawns. "Check."
Special thanks to George Lucas for a hell of a romantic line, which I've utilized here as well.
“It won’t work.” The Healer said, her dark eyes softening. “I’m sorry for your loss.”
Harry took a deep breath, deactivated the Charm, and stepped inside.
Harry reached a hand through the bars, straining with his shoulders. He was just able to grasp at the fingertips of Ron’s outstretched, trembling hand. “They told me—” he began, then started again. “The witch told me—they ‘took care’ of her.”
“What do you mean?”
If he was honest with himself, he’d felt some hint of it before, through every duel, every sparring match in the Great Hall, the fight in the bathroom, that horrible night atop the lightning-struck tower.
“What are you talking about? There’s no time to waste—they must be in terrible danger.”
“What? What did you say?”
Malfoy followed her in, not daring to glance at Hermione, who was still being watched by Bolton.
Draco sighed. He wandered over to a silver-gilded, black satin bench and sat down. “So, why are you out here?”
Of course, Harry told everything to Ron and Hermione.
“He told you about me.”
Draco laughed. It was nice to talk to someone again. Someone who could meet him blow for blow, who wasn’t afraid of offending him or ordering him around.
“What is that? Draco—what’s happened to your face?”
“Are you—I mean—do you have to—kill anyone?”
He felt all over his body, looking for obvious wounds. Nothing. His skin remained unmarred. Even his head, which had felt the worst of the pain, bore no mark of the agony.
Draco didn’t turn around. “Go away.”
Harry sighed. He checked his phone, but it was empty of texts and calls, as usual. He'd just graduated from college and moved out here, and he didn't have any friends in the area yet. He didn't even have a plan, or a roommate to text. Not even a cat to feed.
But now Harry was
"Lucky they keep these here."
The word was a command, and Harry felt the Freezing Charm take hold. He could see Draco out of the corner of his eyes, frozen over the woman’s body, blood staining his chin. “What—” Draco hissed, his fangs still dripping blood. “Do you think you’re doing?”
Harry pointed his wand at the lock.
“Why?”
And for a moment, the world dropped out from beneath their feet. They floated, suspended.
us to stay here.” He said stubbornly.
recipient. There will be no more Squibs, no more Muggleborns. Magic only to those who deserve it, and for a price, of course.”
you?'
But it wasn’t the grim living arrangements that caught Draco and Hermione’s attention.. It was the prisoners. . They were skinny, some of them emaciated. They glared at them with hooded eyes, but didn’t move. A few didn’t even stir from where they lay in a heap. Draco could hear their heartbeats, alternately rapid and slow, the heartbeats of constant panic and fear, the slow thud fo the dying.
“Damn, Granger, if you don’t want me to work here—”
“What?”
“Professor, we weren’t—“Malfoy began.
Harry’s hands flew up to protect himself, but he felt something curious as the daggers got closer. A warmth, a sense of comfort.
That was ridiculous; they were mortal enemies, antagonists. And Harry was in love with Ginny Weasley, had been since he’d seen her kissing Dean, and his affection for her roared to life inside of him…
They were each other’s lifeblood, entwined on Harry’s bed.
“Like leave me the fuck alone.” Draco laid back on the bed and flung his hand over his eyes. “You’re so
“I can control myself.” Draco said, trying not to watch as the flush crept all the way down his neck. “Vampires can go weeks without blood before they start to desiccate.”
"I don't hate you." Draco said again, but he seemed to be struggling with something. Harry could practically feel it, turning the air liquid with tension, so that every flex of Draco's shoulders, every shift in his seat, was in slow motion. Harry had never felt so attuned to someone in his life, and he wondered how much was the vodka and the night, and how much was the same thing he'd felt the first time he'd walked up to Draco, and felt that pit in his stomach that meant his world had shifted.
when it surrounds
“Potter, a damsel in distress. I could never imagine.” Through the bond, Draco felt a flicker of irritation at that line.
Harry wondered whether he should step back through the wall. News of his whereabouts would certainly spread, and he couldn’t bear to see another article in the
“No, it’s alright. It’s—fine.” Harry said absently. “I’ll need to talk to Madame Malkin about these robes—I think I’d like a longer hem—”
him, but he wasn’t there. Draco was looking for something, or someone…or was it Harry who was doing the seeking?
“Exactly. I’m glad you’re starting to see reason. And Potter.” She waved her wand, and Harry rolled over sleepily, rubbing his eyes. “Make sure Malfoy doesn’t leave.”
“Do you need any help? Hermione’s taught me a lot about library—”
Hermione ignored this. “I need your help. You can track people, right?”
of air as it went in and out of his lungs.
CHAPTER 6: Reprieve
“Thanks.” Harry stepped into the passage, barely paying attention to the path in front of him. Why had she said those things? What did she mean? Did she really think he felt
But even if Draco hadn’t been a vampire, he could always tell where Potter was. It was like an obnoxious sixth sense, some lingering clairvoyance.
Harry took a deep breath.  “I’ll help you, Draco. In whatever way I can. But you can’t go out. Clubs like that are breeding grounds for the virus.”
The clean-up of the facility in Vegas had taken a great deal of forensics, paperwork, and interrogations, which Harry had volunteered to oversee, of course. Hermione and Ron took up flanking positions beside him, and it had been a treat, to see the American president, who had always claimed to be a more powerful wizard than any Brit, defer to the Chosen One’s accusing glare.
“Erm,” Harry began awkwardly. He and Ron didn’t talk about Harry’s relationship with Ginny even under the best of circumstances, and how would he explain that he hadn’t so much as
“Oh, you know, Muggle fighting.” Granger said with a half-smile “It’s utterly brutal.”
But that wasn’t what caught his attention.
Maybe he was obsessed with Malfoy, but he’d never been wrong.
And now here Potter was, in all his golden glory. He’d taken to wearing Muggle clothes over the break—but at least these ones fit. In fact, his red t-shirt was stretched appetizingly around the bulging muscles in his biceps. Potter had gotten so
Harry’s wand was rolling across the floor, no doubt where it had been kicked during the struggle. He picked it up and turned it over and over in his fingers, thinking.
Like everything else, loneliness had fallen out of fashion.
“Vampire blood won’t help her, Draco.” The voice said.
feel better.
“We would have survived.”
Draco stepped out from behind the columns, and he swelled with pride as he noticed the press’s gasps of surprise and approval. He wore a black and rose brocade tuxedo, adorned with a lion and serpent along the lapels. The suit fit him perfectly, and he could tell that more than a few of those gazes held more than admiration as they traced his path across the floor.
The woman pulled her hand away, running the other over it, as though to rub away Hermione’s lips. “I was so excited to get your owl,” she said. “Heath and I have made such progress, and I would hate for our research to be shut down at such a crucial juncture.” She took a step back, surveying them both through narrowed eyes. May I say,” she added. “The two of you look stunning.”
"Something wrong with criticizing the American Dream?" Draco's voice had gone low, and Harry couldn't tell if that was a good or bad thing.
. “I did mean it.” Draco said, trying desperately to maintain his icy disdain, even though he wanted nothing more than to sink his fangs into Harry’s throat, to wrap his limbs around him until there was no separating them. “I tried to kill you.” He whispered. “I
Draco stepped closer, barely bothering to conceal his hope, searching the huddled figures—
Harry got that stubborn look again. “You’re trying to push me away. It won’t work.”
“You’ll die without it. You’re already dying.”
"Fine." Harry took out his phone and started scrolling through Twitter, trying to find updates on the outages.
Harry closed his eyes, thinking. Had they left the Vanishing Cabinet—surely not, someone would have moved it after it had been put to its horrible purpose. Then again, who knew what changes had been made under Snape’s regime? Who knew whether McGonagall even knew the full details?
"Come on," Draco said, after they had sat in darkness for a few minutes. "Let's get ready."
Draco and Hermione exchanged glances. This was their last chance to get out. They’d both agreed that they could issue an early signal; a message from Draco’s father or a sudden illness, if it seemed like the game was up.
Draco tries to contain his...urges. And to keep his distance from the ever-righteous Harry Potter. If only he wasn't so attractive.
With Potter, and his necessity to always be there, trying to ruin everything he wanted. Always proving to be the better wizard, the better man. Looking over his shoulder, asking questions, those infuriating green eyes and that shock of black hair that never seemed to lay flat, liked he’d just gotten off the Quidditch pitch….
But he still felt—weak. Exhausted. It was an enormous effort to sit up, to squint across the cell in the dimming light.
But why wouldn’t he have just killed him in his sleep?
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Sure.” He straightened his sleeves. “I was saying,” he went on, “Do you really have to be
His voice broke.
"For what?"
At first, it had been exceptionally boring. There Malfoy was, reading and taking copious notes in a journal. Harry had tried to see what it was numerous times, but Malfoy always kept the book flat on the table, and bent over his work whenever Harry walked by.
They settled on their separate sides of the room, and Harry hung a tasteful curtain between them for privacy. At first, they’d kept to their separate corners; Draco had even taken to sending over paper notes rather than bothering to speak with him directly. Whenever Harry argued aloud, the paper would just shout, “FUCK OFF,” in Draco’s voice before bursting into flames.
“With our devices, all pureblood families can assure that their magic remains pure, undiluted. They simply take the instrument and siphon off the magical energy from a witch or wizard who, let’s say, doesn’t
"If there's a power outage, there's a water outage not far behind it. He kicked the mop bucket to Harry. "Fill this up. I'm going to make sure we have enough drinking water stocked."
Well, he’d come all this way. The least he could do is have a go at Malfoy first.
All that was left was Harry, blissed out, with a niggling pit of worry in his stomach.
"What?"
Even asleep, Malfoy carried a tension in his shoulders. Harry half-expected his eyes to snap open, for him to spring into action.
As intern to the Minister’s Junior Undersecretary, Draco wasn’t allowed in such meetings. Whenever the Minister spoke to him, it was usually an awkward pat on the shoulder, a brief exchange of pleasantries in a lift.
save.
“I have been a teacher for forty-one years, Mr. Malfoy. Please do not underestimate my ability to read young minds.”
After a moment, his heart rate started to return to normal. He remembered—Draco had been trying to leave, and Harry had been trying to stop him.
neck, made
All he knew is that he didn’t ever want to stop.
“Can vampire blood heal?” Harry said aloud. “How would he even get to them without being caught? Isn’t everything being monitored?”
Draco delicately tried to remove the arm. It didn’t budge.
"No, it's fine." Harry watched Draco's long fingers punch in his ID code. "Really."
He rode the lift to the top floor, pacing back and forth, staring at his reflection in the mirror. If Potter was hurt, if there were signs of a struggle, blood…
“You aren’t serious.”
But Draco had always known that Hermione Granger was far from worthless.
Harry had to find out; no one would believe him otherwise.
“You and I both haven’t had any contact with Muggles.”       “Get the fuck away from me, Potter!” Malfoy’s wand was out now, leveled at Harry’s chest. He didn’t even know why he was reacting this way. In the past, he would have been delighted to find out Potter had contracted a deadly virus, and honored to have passed it to him.
he had to end it now, before it became impossible
“I would have thought you, of all people, would know the importance of prophecies, would know their value. But very well, Potter, very well. Do as you normally would.” She lowered her head, and Harry thought her shoulders shook with a sob.
Harry reached for the portrait, then pulled his hand away. “The vampire blood won’t really bring them back—he has to know that. There is no cure for death—he’ll fail, or he’ll make it worse. Is that what he’s trying—tell me!”
“We’ll do similarly on the students as they leave,” McGonagall sighed. “Though I think it might be best to get them out of the castle as soon as possible.”
Malfoy was in the library
“Whatever you want.” Draco leaned against the wall, all of his energy suddenly gone. “Just do it, Harry. I don’t care anymore.”
“And that’s all I am to you? A blood bag? A good fuck? Was I your fucking—
Hermione’s hand went to the necklace around her neck. “Is there any chance of recovering it?”  Draco could swear that her hair had started to take on a darker tinge, and her beard seemed to be getting thinner. The hour must be nearly up.
"Yes, sir." Harry said, just to see what he'd do.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “You don’t know
And there Potter would be, staring at him from across the Quidditch pitch. Whispering to Granger or Weasley, his gaze darting away at the last second. Draco had felt Harry watching him every day he’d left the Great Hall since this had started; so intense and scorching that it nearly burned the back of his neck…
Draco frowned. “I mean, I love strippers and cocaine as much as the next guy, but—”
Well, that’s what I was trying to tell you. Since we have a mandatory lockdown, and your mother’s immune system might not be able to handle exposure—”
Lucius looked through the wrought iron gate at Draco, who shuffled his feet nervously. He hadn’t dared to enter without his father’s permission, not since he’d been Turned. He always waited for someone else to walk through the gates first.
at him.
“Why do you think I give a damn about other people?”
Draco took the offered one with a grunt. “Didn’t know you to be much of a drinker.”

." Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was so paranoid. No wonder everyone annoyed him. "Sidewalks. Boots." he held up his foot. "I'm golden."
Lucius stood there silently for a moment. Then, as his face began to crumple inward, he shrugged off the Healer’s touch. “Go! Hurry! Save my—save your mother.”” Lucius’ voice broke.
Hermione kicked him in the shins.
He’d gathered that the Ministry was still working on hunting down some of Voldemort’s more avid followers, that there was another sect threatening Muggle rights in America, that Potter had been designated to head this task force…
dressing room.”
"Fine. I'll call you 'Harry' from now on." Draco snapped. "Happy?"
“Maybe I don’t think it’s worth the overpriced airfare and shitty food. Speaking of,” Draco craned his neck. “Where is that waiter? I’m starving.”
“You’re lying.”
“Don’t act so scandalized!” Bellatrix. “The sooner you embrace your nature, the easier it will be.”
“You’re—killing—people,” Potter panted, diving behind his bed and launching another attack.
“Are you saying you fancy me?”
“Leave Ginny out of this.”
“You won’t.” Said Harry through gritted teeth. “You can’t.” He reached with his left hand and grabbed his wand. “
“I can be out of the gates by the morning.” Malfoy said. “I’ll send word to my family, if you’ll just—”
“Yes—”
Draco didn’t speak until Longbottom had left the room, casting a suspicious glance over his shoulder as he went. The last thing he needed was
“I—can’t tell you. Just let me in. Please.”
“Yeah, but its the
“I’m surprised a European would eat there,” Bolton frowned. His eyes darted between Draco and Hermione as though trying to catch one of them lying.
Hermione looked into his eyes. “You won’t kill anyone.”
“Now, Heath can perform magic as well as any fully trained wizard. It has been 3 days since his transfusion, since
Draco ran a hand along the line of Harry’s jaw. “I don’t care what anyone says about us.” He pulled him in for a kiss. “But I’m never going to stop loving you, Harry Potter. It’s time the rest of the world knows it.”
“You couldn’t help yourself.” His father said. “It’s perfectly understandable. It’s in your nature. You are the same as Bellatrix, or Greyback--”
Three seconds now…
“It’s not safe.”
After a few minutes, however, his mind quickly turned to the task at hand. Malfoy was in Hogsmeade, and he’d bet ten thousand Galleons it was to do something Dark or dangerous, or both.
Draco shook his head helplessly. “Why did you follow me here?”
He was so tired.
He started pacing around the cafe, trolling for distractions. He wished he'd brought his switch or a book at least--the magazines were, after all, the kind of material that you should never read seriously.
“I’m to stay here alone?”
"You don't need to do that." Harry said. "The microwave's fine."
He leaned against the wall and tucked his head into his chest, cradling his wand. At least, if he was killed in the struggle, it would be a painless death. Quick and easy.
It was a sight to see, something he’d treasure forever.
Not to mention, he was having a hard time staying away from Draco Malfoy.
Draco shook his head, but his right hand, which didn’t hold his wand, closed in a fist. “He doesn’t love me. I don’t love him. It was a
He hadn’t killed anyone. He’d managed that much. But he knew he was walking a thin line. He’d already been followed by a few vampires once or twice.: dark, shadowy figures who dogged his steps when he took another lover home for the evening. He knew they were watching him, waiting for him to slip up. He knew he wouldn’t be able to survive outside a coven if they decided he was too conspicuous and inconvenient, that he might bring down the entire Department of Magical Creatures on himself.
Draco’s  features softened. He reached up  and touched Harry’s cheek, running his fingers along his jaw as though remembering its shape. His fingertips caught at Harry’s chin.
Hermione grinned. “I knew it.”
Harry awoke hours later. The sun, which had been filtering weakly through the narrow windows above their prison had turned to night. Bright fluorescent lights were in every corner.
“I thought it would stop. When I severed the bond. I thought that’s all it was—magic and blood, between us. I thought that it would make the feelings go away, but—” and tears were starting at the edge of Harry’s eyes, tears of exhaustion and despair, frustration, emotion that had been building since he’d drank the last of the elixir and felt the bond snap.
Draco’s eyes flew open. “Okay, Granger. I get it. You know how to read.”
Lucius’ nostrils flared. “Our protections—they don’t detect the virus. What if you’ve been exposed to it?”
Like a tinderbox hovering over an open flame.
at chess. His entire body was taut, like a coiled spring, and his eyes seemed to glimmer every time he made a move. There was a wrinkle that would appear in the middle of his forehead whenever he was planning something, and his eyes kept flickering to Harry's face and back to the chess pieces.
“No.”
When Harry walked outside to a winter wonderland, he realized how wrong he was.
Voldemort had made him a vampire against his will, in the final moments of the Battle of Hogwarts. The Dark Lord had been raving in the Forbidden Forest, his mind already half-broken from the destruction of his Horcruxes, waiting frantically for Potter to arrive, and he’d wanted ‘a bit of fun.’
He was terrified he hadn’t made it in time; he’d had to double back for his phone, and he lost valuable time calling up the Thestrals, until he remembered that they liked raw meat, and he’d raided Aberforth’s stores.
It didn’t matter why Draco was leaving; he was going to endanger himself and everyone around him if he was exposed to the virus. Harry had tried to stop him without question, but he hadn’t expected Draco to strike so quickly, so brutally, for all that desire and affection to be wiped out in a single instant—
“I’m not making any promises. Is that a risk you’re willing to take?”
“Do you want me to make you forget?”  Draco whispered, his wand still pressed into Harry’s neck. “That’s what you want, right? You want to stop loving me?” his voice broke at the end, but he managed to control himself, stop the tears from falling, keep his lip from trembling.
to us?” Harry’s ribs ached; it hurt to breathe.
*Edward Cullen voice*: You're like my own personal brand of heroin.
But there was no going back.
“When in Rome—” Hermione shrugged.
Hermione ignored him. “So I guess the only question is—did you fall in love with him, too? Do you love him still? Because it might be the only way we can save them.
Harry tried desperately to hear something, anything, coming from further inside the facility. The sound of footsteps, the beep of electronic security monitors, the slide of a door being opened,
Harry sat back against the wall, his mind whirring through possibility after possibility, discarding them one after the other. He’d never planned to be in a situation where magic itself was unavailable to him, where he’d have a magical instrument but no power to channel through it.
“Fine.” Draco closed his eyes, then opened them a moment later. “I can’t feel anything. Happy?”
“I bet he’ll lock his doors and stay inside, and set one of those ridiculous peacocks on the Muggle postman.” Harry said. “Maybe he won’t come back at all.”
“How did you--“
“I don’t care if never forgives me, Hermione.” Draco said. “He already hates me. I’ve done enough that he’ll hate me for the rest of the life. I care if he’s
“Well, as you can see,” Draco gulped down the rest of his Firewhiskey, relishing the tingling sensation that spread to his limbs. He spread his arms, sending the glass to the floor, where it shattered. “I’m grand.”
Malfoy hadn’t even intimated that he’d heard Harry at first, until the third time he’d caught Harry staring at him from across the room. “Jealous of my perfect features, Potter?” he tilted his face up, so that the light illuminated his aquiline features.  “It’s what comes from not having a mother like yours.”
Harry laughed. “I’m stubborn like that.”
Harry looked at her incredulously. “He tried to kill all of us! Several times!”
Draco’s eyes flashed, and a muscle twitched in his jaw. “Get out of my way.”
Harry thought.
“I’m surprised we’re graduating at all,” Harry held up a green set, then a white one, wondering which would be most startling. Wondering if Draco would—
Draco felt his fangs lengthen.

“How many have you fed on? How many have you killed?”
“Love is not a weakness.”

“Let’s worry about our dinner plans later.” Madame Dijikstra smiled at them in a way that made Draco’s skin crawl. “This is where we house our most promising specimens. I think you’ll be very pleased with our results.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry’s eyes pricked. What did she mean? Did she mean he felt something for
“Draco,” Harry whispered, his hand going up to touch his cheek.
“Well. I mostly guessed. He’s horrible at hiding how he feels about you. Always has been.”
Malfoy could tell that Harry was wrestling with the desire to be polite. “Fine,” he said finally. “Can I—”
In the middle of his mother’s death.
Harry gestured to the papers in front of him, the ones Malfoy had hastily stacked and flipped over when he’d heard the noise. “What are you working on?”
Harry drew his knees up to his chest and wrapped his hands around them.  “Still. You can’t just go into Hogsmeade every time you’re hungry. What are you going to do?”
And for the tiniest bit of a moment, bright green eyes, framed by glasses. A surge of
For a moment, the outline of what looked like an entire crowd glowed behind the walls. As he watched, one of them detached from the others and started to walk toward him.
"Last year." Blaise rolled his eyes. "He's decided that since she doesn't love him, he can't ever love, blah blah blah...your basic indie rom com moody bullshit."
. Before he could change the channel, he heard Draco laugh softly along with the track. He turned halfway around in his chair.
He grabbed Harry’s wrist and
If Harry was being serious, Draco was going to make sure. He wouldn’t be made a fool of by Harry Potter.
"Emergency Winter Storm Warning." Harry said aloud. "All roads closed.'
Potter smelled delicious—throbbing blood and grass and a hint of sweat…
“You mean where you got caught, compromised your hiding place, and broke Potter’s wand?”
CHAPTER 8: June
Now Draco’s fangs had pierced his bottom lip, and he had a raging boner.
McGonagall had accused Harry of being too suspicious of Malfoy; everyone had. And look where it had led them.
His mind flashed to those first few moments on the battlefield—he’d turned suddenly on a crowd of Death Eaters, nobodies, expendable to Voldemort and everyone else, useless fodder for the armies.
“Well, I still think I should do the flirting from now on. You flirt like a serial killer.”
“The war is over.” McGonagall said.
The doorman was terrible at his job, reading a novel so intently that Draco didn’t even bother to do a Disillusionment Charm as he glided by. ‘
Harry didn’t even have a snarky comeback, the git. “Is everything alright?”
Harry was silent for a moment. “You cared about me,” he said. “You saved me.”
Draco wanted to drink from him longer, he wanted this to last. He wanted to remember this moment for the rest of his life, because love could always bring destruction. And who knew how long either of them would make it in a world fraught with Death Eaters and Dark wizards and politicians, bloodsucking, power hungry monsters who wanted to bleed them dry? Who knew if they would have anything more than this night?
Harry’s response was sudden and instant. He pulled Draco in even closer, until he could whisper in his ear.  “Drink from me, Draco. Take—whatever you want. Take it—I—please. I want you. I want it.”
“You may as well come in,” Harry said finally, opening the door wider. When Draco brushed by him, he shivered.
Draco took a deep breath.
"I--"
Hermione sighed, still not looking up from her book. “At this speed, we’re risking Splinching. Besides, we’d alert the American authorities.”
Once again, Harry thought he would give anything to take a spin in the mind of Draco Malfoy.
“We took both of their magics.” Bolton said. “Potter and the blood traitor’s, Weaselby or something.”
“You’re doing this because you love Harry. Don’t pretend you don’t.” Hermione reached in her bag and pulled out a thermos. “Here.”
“You aren’t planning on going into Hogsmeade, are you?”
"Of course--I'm so sorry." and for the first time, Draco looked genuinely apologetic. “Get home safe.”
“We have to get out of here.”
"That's rather naive for an underemployed English major."
Shacklebolt, Weasley, even the wizard who came to check the plumbing, all shared a similar distrust for anyone who was under Voldemort’s influence, even if they had all pleaded to be under duress, even if his father’s money had kept them out of prison.
“Well, I’m probably going to die for him, so I don’t give a shit.”
Harry thought, studying the dark blue shadows under his eye, the purplish tinge to his skin. He remembered the dreams he’d been having, dreams where Draco swooped down on him, and the air tasted like sex and blood.
It was only when they broke apart so that Harry could pull Draco to the bedroom that he understood what Harry had been saying, like emerging for air after a long time spent underwater.
“I call them livestock,” Dijikistra said. “I need a certain type of course—witches and wizards who come into full realization and control of their powers are best—the magic increases with awareness.”
"You were just sitting when I got--"
“Figuring out a place for us to sleep,” Draco said. “Unless you plan to wash in the water fountain.”
“Is this supposed to make me feel sorry for him?”
deserve first in our year.” Draco said grudgingly.
Harry’s head throbbed, making it difficult to think. He must have been going to see her, but why? He should have known that journeying there would only put her more at risk.
“Just.” Harry bit his lip. “If we’re going to stay here together, we need to set some ground rules. Especially if you’re tempted—"
“Because she was crying?”
She shook herself.  “You must be talking about Mr. Malfoy. Draco is on the upper level. Should I let him know you’re coming?”
“You shouldn’t have come here.”
Nothing.
Bolton took her arm, and the two led them down the hallway.  Draco tried to peer into the windows, but all he saw were empty cubicles, a few scraps of parchment and broken quills, a wastepaper bin that hadn’t been properly emptied.  He even saw a Muggle copy machine, the light blinking a dull orange color, as he peered in through an open door.
But it seemed to be just expensive, sweet champagne. He took another glass and handed it to Hermione as she descended, stiff-legged and awkward in the waiter’s enormous feet.
roared to life inside him, something that Harry only knew because he recognized it.
in quarantine. And you’re fit as hell.”
"Of course it was. You, Blaise, Pansy--it's just about who's the Drama Central Couple of the Week. I'm not about to feed the proverbial tabloids anymore."
McGonagall was already writing. As they watched, she signed with a flourish, then waved her wand. The message disappeared in a cloud of flame.
But Harry and Draco definitely were something other than friends.
“But—that’s impossible! You can’t transfer magic.”
Harry kept busying himself with the dishes. He set out two of his mugs, then reached into the cabinet for tea bags, depositing them carefully in the cups.
He was still saying it as Harry came closer, quieter and weaker each time. Harry reached him and wrapped his arms around Draco’s chest, curving his body over Draco’s, who still held his mother in his arms.
Draco smirked. “I suppose you have a point. But I think we’d have you beaten now.”
“Apologies,” Dijikstra said, withdrawing her hand. “But you must see that your funding will cause us to make progress. Undeniable, world-altering progress!”
"Watch it while I'm doing laundry." Draco said. "It...helps."
Finally, she stepped off onto a floor that smelled abandoned. The air was musty, and the lights were off in the hallway. She grabbed his arm and shoved him into a room, where one of his knees collided painfully with a chair before there was a
And of course, Draco and Harry are pulled, in every possible way, toward each other.
"That's not true." Draco said. "In
Harry was not afraid of his own death, but he didn’t want anyone else to die for him again, to be blasted apart defending him, to spread their hands and take the blow meant for him, to tell a joke only for it to be their last…
Obviously this isn't the last chapter. I'm not even sure if we're gonna have 8 chapters. I don't know y'all. The story's taking me in a lot of directions I didn't expect.
“Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
It just made more sense for them to do things together. They were eating breakfast at the same time (well, for Draco it was tea, but it was something), so it made sense to sit next each other at the little table next to the kitchen, for only one person to do the washing up.
What was this new disease? How dangerous was it? And what would happen to the school if it continued?
Besides, they
It only mattered if he lived.
The moment was an iridescent bubble, magical and exhilarating. It was the snow, turning the mundane into the sudden magic. Harry could feel Draco's heart hammering against his own, and it seemed to echo the way he felt again that pit in his stomach, and the world shifting beneath his feet.
“If I can’t save her, then why am I even here?” Draco whispered. “How do I live with myself?”
“Draco.” A demanding, arrogant female voice said.
“I’m dying!” Draco snapped. “Not that it seems to bother you at all.”
powerful? Subjects who have
“Is he really bothering you?" Blaise asked. "I'll talk to him. He doesn't scare me."
But with a flick of his wand, Draco slashed a rent up Blaise’s leg, causing blood to spurt from a wound in his knees.
“Why aren’t you talking to me?”
Draco opened his mouth furiously, but McGonagall interrupted him. “Mr. Malfoy’s testimony put a good many of his associates in prison. And I seem to recall that he played a vital role in your defeat of Voldemort.”
Draco tentatively stepped toward one, thinking it mere illusion, but the snake hissed and struck. Only his vampire reflexes saved him from being bitten, and he could feel the
“Not for you.” Harry said. “For everyone else. You don’t know if you’re still carrying the virus. You could pick it up on the subway, or in Hogsmeade, and then—”
“No, it’s fine.” Harry felt curiously adrift from the both of them. He’d already accepted that he’d be spending the break alone, and he wasn’t sure if he was ready to change everything. Ready to face the Weasleys, who were supposed to be spending the holiday grieving. Or Hermione’s parents, who wanted only to reconnect with the daughter they’d thought hadn’t existed for nearly a year…
“I know,” Harry pressed his face into Draco’s hair, smelling salt and tears and death and blood.
He could see McGonagall tuning him out as he went on.
“It’s probably not that big of a deal,” Ron said. “The Muggles will find a solution eventually. It won’t affect
They’d been in the Room of Requirement for sixteen days when Harry allowed himself to say it, the thought that had been chasing itself around in his head since the beginning, since he’d first seen Draco’s lips latched around the neck of that man in the club.
“Of course, of course.” The cowboy tipped his hat, but there was a slight edge to his voice when he said, “First we’ll meet up with my associate. This way.”
, since he and Draco were mortal enemies.
Draco could hardly blame him. He was still a monster, after all.
“I don’t see anything—”
“Drink and tell me what you see when you feel Harry.”
Harry opened his mouth to retort, but Hermione kicked him under the table. Draco smirked. Potter was so
Draco’s fangs slid down over his lips, and his father stopped talking. He squinted. It was difficult for anyone but a vampire to see this night; the moonlight provided only silvery shadows. Draco stepped forward, so that his father could see him properly.
to talk to him.
Draco wasn’t going to leave without Harry, even if it meant he had to die here himself.
But Harry was already backing away, shaking his head. His luminous eyes filled with tears. “I won’t let you put me through this again, Draco. I—
When Harry awoke, there were tears in his eyes, and his wand burned hot against his chest.
Harry was saved from his downward spiral by Draco, who suddenly arrived, looking breathless and excited.
He was a monster.
“There he is! Back from the dead,” Zabini greeted Draco with a sneer as he stumbled into the room, a glass of cognac already in hand, his shirtfront rumpled. “How was the plague?”
Then Harry remembered Dobby’s tennis ball eyes, dimming into nothing as the light left them. Sirius, his laugh still frozen on his face, as he fell through the veil. Dumbledore’s crumpled corpse at the bottom of the tower. Fred Weasley, laying in a pile of rubble, Percy trying to shield him with his body even though he was beyond help—
But a reality check arrived in the form of an alarm siren. The lights started to flash red, and an ear-splitting wail resounded throughout the facility.
What if he wasn’t, even magically, a part of his family anymore.
Draco sighed. “No, Mr. Weasley. It won’t be a problem. I’ll just pop on over to the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.”
He only came back to full awareness when he heard a member of the catering pound on the door. “Mr. Malfoy,” the man had a quaver in his voice, no doubt wondering what sort of fucking could wring out that much noise. “Your guests are asking for you.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” Harry said, tears starting in his own eyes as Draco snarled at him. “I won’t leave you.”
Harry’s mind flashed to that night atop the tower. Malfoy had faced Dumbledore, trembling. And Dumbledore had simply surveyed him calmly, as though he weren’t dying, as though he weren’t defenseless. As though it was Malfoy who needed mercy.
“And how can you be so certain?”
The corner of Draco's mouth twitched. "So you
But even though severing the bond had stopped the forays into Draco’s awareness, even though the niggling consciousness at the edge of his own disappeared, even though he could no longer recall flashes of awareness from a London flat, the smell of the Ministry at dawn, the contempt that oozed off of Draco’s coworkers, even though that was all gone—
Draco certainly kept himself busy for an hour or so after that, reliving the experience. Imagining what would have happened if he’d waited a little while to drink, if Potter had laid
Draco said softly.
When his orgasm finally receded, each wave a little bit weaker than the last, Harry’s limbs felt like lead. He could barely open his eyes. And Draco was still sucking the blood from his neck, making obscene little guzzling noises every few moments.
Draco got to his feet and walked over to Harry, so that he was standing right in front of him, where his legs dangled over the edge of the bed. Draco leaned down to whisper in his ear, placing his hands on either side of him on the bed, and Harry
Harry huffed. “Fine.”
“Why would you do this? We’re wasting time!”
He needed to control himself. Part of him wanted to go back in there and drink Zabini’s blood until he was a mess on the floor. Part of him wanted to drain him, kill him and let his father deal with how to cover up his monstrous deeds.
"Potter," Draco looked up at him, and there was something far too raw in his eyes. It was almost as though he was afraid.  "Always the sunny optimism with you. Doesn’t it get exhausting?”
He didn’t think he’d ever been this fearless in his life.
And that encounter certainly warranted some inebriation.
for the holiday.” He bit off the end of the sentence, and Harry didn’t doubt that he was mocking him. The way Malfoy told the story of that final duel, Harry had essentially gotten in on pure luck.
“With a great deal of experimentation, we have managed to procure magic from magic-wielders, and transfer it to the nonmagical.”
“Human.” Draco finished. “So I’ll find him, and you—”
He hated how much he liked it.
are magic.” She corrected. “Yourself, Mr. Mafoy, withches and wizards of a purely magical heritage. But a Mudblood? Someone who by accident of birth managed to get the gifts that were rightfully ours? They have
He skidded around a corner and raced down the hallway, bent down low to keep the Invisibility Cloak from flapping around his ankles.
Malfoy was gone.
“The Minister wants those reports on his desk no later than Friday.” Percy looked at Draco through his horn-rimmed glasses. “Is that going to be a problem?”
“Mr. Malfoy, your parents have sent you a message. Your mother has fallen ill and requests you come home at once.”
“The Healer was lacking some information.” Draco swept on hurriedly. “Information that would save her.”
“So you
“I won’t take your blood until you’re begging me, Harry Potter,” Draco growled. “I’m not going to be another monster in the dark for you. If you want me to bite into your neck, to feel me suck and take until you’re half-mad with it, you have to ask. You have to say it.”
He slumped against the wall of the changing room, letting himself break down for just this one moment, this one second. Letting the full weight of all that had passed between himself and Draco press into him, drown him. Tears sprang to his eyes, and a single sob choked out. He dug his fingernails into his palms.
She descended, and Bolton took her hand. He glowed for a moment, bright as a sudden flare on a deserted island. “I was once a Squib,” Bolton said. “An embarrassment and dishonor to my entire family, I volunteered for the initial experiments, but Diane refused. She’s sweet on me,” he shot a glance her way, and they smiled at each other. Draco felt nausea rise up in his throat.
“I like that accent,” the waiter leaned against the bar and crossed his arms.  “What’s life like ‘across the pond’?” He said the last part in a singsong, mockingly British voice.
“Good.” McGonagall sat back. “Now, over the break—”
The door to the bedroom on the right was wide open, light spilling into the darkened hallway.
Some of these subjects are dead!”
“There’s something off about that woman,” Hermione said. “Something’s not right.”
Harry sat down on his bed, feeling his heart race as he tried to form the words. Draco went still, frozen, the ball still clutched in one long-fingered hand.
“What about students who are staying here?” Harry asked, ignoring the mocking glance Malfoy shot him. “Where will we go?”
“We don’t know how much longer that communication will be allowed,” Hermione said. “Besides, owls can be intercepted, as you well know.”
"George? Yeah. They met here. It was very dramatic. Like Lady and the Tramp."
“You’re a vampire! You—
Ron shook his head. “The spell works over long distances. She said it would help her find me, if we ever got separated. I could always find my way back to her.” Ron’s eyes were wet again, and his chin trembled
Harry took advantage of his distraction. His mind hazy, dizzy with blood loss and lust, he rolled them over and fumbled at Draco’s belt to pull his pants down. Harry licked a long stripe from Draco’s collarbone to his navel, then ran his lips down to Draco’s balls, sucking them into his mouth, pinning Draco to the bed with one hand while the other boy writhed above him.
be a problem, not if he wanted to keep his job. Who knew that politics could be so boring? All the intrigue, the back-door meetings and hidden corridors, had been replaced by tea runs and statistics. It was downright depressing.
Draco glared at them as he sat as far across the table as possible. He grabbed a piece of chicken and tore into it viciously. It was bad enough that he had to fake eating dinner; worse that he was doing it in front of Potter and McGonagall. The least he could do was make sure they didn’t notice how much he was eating; people usually tried to politely ignore bad table manners.
“I should be with my family. I can Apparate away from any Muggles who—”
“Yeah, and we got imprisoned forty-five minutes into day one,” Harry said. He still hadn’t figured out exactly where they were. Somewhere in the Nevada desert, he guessed. It was where he and Ron had rushed off to that night. They’d been camping outdoors, tracking a mysterious witch who was rumored to be conducing experiments on Muggles.
Malfoy had never cared much about his studies before; he’d always been either smart enough or well-connected enough to get good marks regardless. So why was he spending hours in the library every day, reading?
A surge of hope went through him like lightning, and he leapt forward, tackling the cowboy to the ground. The cowboy’s wand clattered out of his reach. Harry grabbed his hair and slammed his head against the floor, but the cowboy dug his fingers into Harry’s eyes, and Harry released him, reeling.
“Ron?” Harry’s mouth felt dry. He groped around the floor until he found one of the bottles of water they’d been leaving at his cell for the last few days. He took a few swallows, then said, a little louder, “Ron? Are you alright?”
Potter sat back, comprehension breaking across his features. “We’ve been in quarantine. How often do you need to—”
keep them here."
Draco narrowed his eyes, and he could practically see the waiter swoon.
“Sanguini. He—attacked me. During the Battle of Hogwarts—”
He caught himself.
him lifting weights with the rest of the Slytherin Quidditch team, his muscles gleaming in the Sun..
“Minerva! Sorry to interrupt—” it was Neville Longbottom, his round face anxious. “I have some information to share with you. He was holding an iPhone, and he looked drawn and anxious.
Then the ice storm hit. The worst in recorded history, especially for this far south.
McGonagall had said that all the other students were staying home or with friends over break; even most of the teachers had retired to their summer homes.

as the breath caught in Draco’s chest and his stomach tightened.
And he didn’t know if Draco heard it, if that was what he felt as he grabbed Harry’s chin and wrenched his head to the side, sinking his fangs into Harry’s neck. Harry’s bones melted in pleasure, and he sank forward onto Draco.
“I don’t know.” Draco said helplessly.

of rain hitting the top of the prison. Saw only the sunlight through his window as it got weaker and weaker, until the automatic fluorescent lights kicked on.
When he arrived on the level, he spotted Malfoy in an instant. He was indeed dancing, wrapped closely around a man who was even taller than him, built like a rugby player, with a scar across his left cheek. As Harry watched, Malfoy leaned up and latched his lips onto the man’s neck. The man threw back his head in pleasure.
“Why didn’t you tell him?” she asked. “Harry would understand.”
"So—Draco. What’s his deal?"
Draco’s blood went cold at how close he’d come. He’d been dimly aware of something amiss, some voice at the back of his mind telling him to pay attention. Then he’d noticed that the noises Potter had been making, those noises that lit his entire body afire, had stopped.
“If you love him the way I love Ron, you’ll show restraint. Because you know if you rip those people apart to save him, he’ll never forgive you.”
Wait—he wasn’t in his dormitory; he was in the Room of Requirement--
