George looked pretty pleased with himself whilst Fred just rolled his eyes, Harry just looked puzzled as to why they cared so much.
“Oh my god, Harry.” Her eyes sparkled, igniting the curiosity in Harry. As he gave her a questioning gaze, hoping the look explained his question.
No matter how embarrassing it was to show the other how much he wanted him, needed him, craved him - he knew that he fucking loved it.
Potter then covered Draco’s body with his own to block out everyone else’s view as leaned further down to graze his teeth over the pale flesh of his neck. An almost inaudible whine left the open of the blonde’s mouth, it made Harry growl, once more, against the sensitive skin.
He could not figure out why Potter’s gaze had been so intently on him, between Hermione slapping him and the other “waking up” - he had chosen to look down to try rid himself of those impure thoughts that had swarmed inside his head. The tingling in his groin from his rising boner definitely wasn’t helping either.
With one last lick, Harry moved his mouth away; momentarily content with the art he had made on the other’s neck. He had left many possessive marks but in no way was Draco’s skin covered, there was still plenty of room left for Harry to add more - he’d do that later though.
Harry finally gave in and ran his hands down Draco’s chest, then to his sides. He revelled in the shiver he got from him as he ghosted his fingers down the blonde’s inner thighs, the way they trembled under his touch made Harry produce a low groan - which almost sounded like a growl.
“The size of my dick is common knowledge?” Harry’s voice was a little raspy as he pulled a curious face, looking at his friends intently.
“I like it, it’s really relaxing and warm.” The blonde allowed himself to look up at the ceiling, it was seemingly bewitched to match the weather just like the Great Hall. It was extremely comforting, the ceiling was tall and at the highest point the colour was a captivating blue with “stars” distributed amongst them.
“Are we not invited?” Draco’s stomach was filled with very aggressive butterflies, he didn’t know whether to thank or be mad with Pansy for leaving them alone.
Before any of them could try and attempt to talk themselves into any more trouble, Harry was moving. Using his threatening aura to spook them all as he slowly made his way over, Draco refused to look back at him - scared that he’d just whimper on the spot and show Potter how much he was really affected by him. How much he secretly, down deep inside, liked him.
Potter walked over to where Draco’s cloak was hung up, taking it off to reveal a black leather jacket - he had not noticed that. His mouth watered slightly from when he’d seen the other wear the jacket before, it suited him disgustingly well.
Potter’s voice, that sounded a lot deeper than normal, broke him out of his head. Sending a tingle of warmth throughout his lower stomach. God, what was wrong with him. He felt the sensation he usually got before getting fully turned on rush throughout his body. He didn’t know whether to despise that it was just a voice getting him this worked up or just to focus on the fact that it was Potter’s voice!
Draco was still doing it on instinct until his eyes caught the way Potter was looking at him, transfixed on his mouth. The blonde wondered if the other was thinking such filthy thoughts right now as he had voiced before. He then caught himself locking gazes with him and that answered all of his questions, purely from the scolding look he was receiving from the boy-who-lived.
His eyes fluttered as he tried to maintain the eye contact, his body convulsing in his own pleasure. He focused on breathing through his nose, in and out, in and out…
“Harry!” She heard some slight banging, storage closet. Of course. She ran over to the door, muttering ‘Alohmora’ as the lock clicked.
Harry then, much to his dismay, planted his gaze onto Draco’s friends. Whom all looked absolutely terrified, they should be. He let his lips twitch up into a malicious looking grin, he loved being in control.
“Gis' us some.” Fred spoke and the other raised his eyebrows, a silent plea for him to share. Begrudgingly, Ron broke off a couple pieces and handed them to his brothers. He rolled his eyes at the pleased sound they both let out. Before he decided to inhale it all by himself, he silently offered the rest some - secretly glad when they politely declined.
Harry’s tone was low and dangerous as he leaned in and licked a stripe up Draco’s neck, not biting just yet but nipping ever so lightly. He had been thinking about this for years, he was going to take his sweet time whilst teasing him. The blonde’s frame shook, pressing his lips together in an attempt to stop the whimpers from falling from his mouth.
Harry noticed, taking his hand off of himself and reaching down to grab Malfoy’s shaking hands. He placed them on his muscular thighs and let go, placing his hands atop Draco’s head. For now, he played with the snow kissed strands - the soft hair tickling his fingers.
“E-Either nothing o-or once P-no.” Draco’s entire body shivered under the dark gaze that was shot his way.
He recognised it as Neville’s voice, the one who had ratted him out. Normally, he would’ve felt anger or a need for revenge residing in his stomach but the only thing he could feel at the moment was lust. And being honest with himself, he was feeling gratitude as without him; this may have never happened.
“Hermione and Ron, the way you care for your friends is wonderful. It’s very nice to see your support and how you’ve grown together.” He flashed them all a genuine smile, they couldn’t help the slight happiness they felt.
He imagined himself: They were in a classroom, he could still hear the muttering of voices and footsteps outside the door. His gaze was locked on it, even though he knew it wasn’t real - it still felt so very vivid. Everything felt so real and it made heat rush down to his groin.
He decided to distract himself and nudged Goyle, who was seemingly very entranced in the Gryffindor’s conversation.
Potter’s voice was now straight back to the deep and rousing one that it had been before, Draco was secretly glad.
Their lungs were burning for air as they finally pulled back, their lips slick with each other’s spit in a way that should be gross but was obscenely amazing. Even after that kiss, they looked at each other shyly. Still wrapped up in each other.
“Now, kitten.” Draco was going to fucking die from the pet names, he cleared his throat as he inhaled a shaky breath.
“What do you want me to do, Draco?” He drawled out the words, staring at him and catching his gaze - he knew his own eyes were dark and swarmed by lust.
He was really glad that his friends were too wrapped up in talking about Potter to realise how much he was being affected by him. And how he was being looked at.
He exhaled another shaky breath when he heard the other laughing lowly, the very fact that he was so amused at having caught Draco looking was starting to make him lose it. His whole body felt clammy as he could feel Potter’s eyes burning holes through his skin with how intense his gaze was.
The two began walking as Harry led the way, taking the other to the closet where he was not long ago hiding.  Hermione, Ron and Pansy who were hiding behind the wall all grinned. Finally deciding to give them their privacy as the walked away.
Harry’s eyes soon slipped back down to his mouth as the grin reappeared on his lips, his thoughts full of sinful images. He couldn’t help but think about using that mouth, watching the bratty blonde drop to his knees eagerly and have Harry’s cock shoved down his throat.
Draco let his eyes drop down, the best he could, to try to see how much of Potter’s cock he had taken. His eyes widened in disbelief as he realised that he’d already taken a little over half of him in, he swallowed; only to be reminded of the size of the dick he had in his mouth.
“My mother wasn’t mad, only scared of his reaction. I started acting out at school, he was trying to force me to be a person I didn’t want to be. I didn’t and still don’t want to be an evil person, I want to be good. He hated that. I’m not blaming him for it all though, I was a prick.” Harry laughed softly.
“F-Finger me, hard. P-Please, Harry.” His voice was unstable, as he knew it would’ve been, coming out in a squeak rather than actual words. It was enough for the Gryffindor though.
Going back to what the Gryffindor had said, he couldn’t deny it. He knew that he was an irritating little nuisance at times, that was the plan - but after today things had definitely changed. Draco didn’t want to be an annoying nuisance anymore, he wanted to be good for Harry. Something he never thought he want.
He had started swallowing around him repeatedly before Potter muttered some soft words that had Draco calming, inhaling deep through his nose as he allowed the cock in his throat to sink lower. His mouth now pushed against his hand that was still wrapped around the base, to say he was proud of himself was a fucking understatement.
He laughed a little humorously, Harry confided in the other laughing at trauma. Hopefully now instead of using that to cope, they could confide in each other.
A deep chuckle made its way from his own lips at how much he affected the Slytherin, he basked in it. Harry then allowed his dark gaze to meet Draco’s, an unspoken demand that had not been fulfilled allowed his eyes to grow even darker.
Then he felt it, the last particle of self control imploding into nothing. Harry opened his now, even darker, eyes. Settling them on the ones responsible for making him feel like this before dragging them back to his friends, he could see their slightly unnerved expressions.
“As soon as Malfoy answers my question.” Hermione had a relieved expression on her face, glancing over at Draco - as she muttered a ‘hurry up’.
Potter’s eyes dropped, so easily, to his mouth. Where his bottom lip was still caught between his teeth as he chewed on it from habit, his tongue swiping along every so often as a way to distract himself.
Harry was starting to get lost in his thoughts again, an effect of lust potions. That’s the thing that ticked him off the most but also enjoyed. He could not escape the sexual desire in his head and thoughts, it made focusing on anything extremely fucking difficult - a con.
Then his length, fuck. He couldn’t tell just from looking through his jeans but he had to have been at least, oh god. His brain had stopped working, turning to must and sliding out of his ears. He had seen Potter naked before, yes, but had always been too shy to look down. Harry Potter was hung like a fucking horse, his body refused to stop shaking.
“See something you like there, hm? Fantasising?” The evil looking smirk that graced Harry’s features grew wider as he stared down at the boy shrivelling under his look, Draco melted some more under his watchful eyes.
He opened his eyes ever so reluctantly, raising his gaze as they landed straight on Potter’s groin. Fucking hell. The breath was literally stolen from Draco’s lungs as if he had been punched straight in the stomach, his hands now gripping his own thighs for dear life - attempting to cover up the obvious bulge.
Instantly, they both leaned in. Their mouths moving together in a perfect rhythm, almost like their bodies were made to be together. The hand that Harry had snaked into Draco’s hair was now pulling, succeeding in deepening the kiss.
Harry’s hands were ever so slowly getting tighter in the blonde’s hair, the wet heat starting to surround his hard on filling him with pleasure.
“It’s important!” He knew that once he explained what had happened, she’d be a lot more interested in what he had to say. Hermione sighed as she put down her quill and capped the ink, reciprocating the eye contact.
Draco nodded his head in understanding, already feeling scrutinised from the observation he was undergoing from Potter’s tenebrous eyes.
He didn’t know how long he’d been there, towering over his cowering frame as his eyes were locked on the ground. Feeling the combat boots at either side of his curvy hips start to put against them, squashing them against his flesh in some sort of warning. That still didn’t make him look up, he didn’t fucking want too but some part of him did.
“Oh, we know who you were pretending it was, Harry.” Ginny grinned as she gave a 0.1 second glance towards the Slytherin table.
“Thank fuck that he’s finally made a move.” Ron cackled as Ginny, Hermione, Neville and the twins all nodded in agreement - all of them thinking the same thing.
Harry hadn’t finished speaking, he could tell. He was merely pausing, just so he would be able to watch how his words affected the other - how his words would sink in to the man before him.
‘Good genes’ was what he sarcastically thought in his head. He then, hesitantly, moved his hand to rest on his thigh.
All he’d ever wanted to do was mark Draco’s pretty, porcelain skin up. And now he could, he would not waste this chance. He let his tongue glide over the quickly forming bruise, sucking on his neck before biting down once more.
He cowered under the look he received from the other, his unruly raven hair tickling his forehead as he brushed it out of the way to put all of his attention onto to Draco. The blonde almost choked on his spit at the the sharp scrutiny that he was once again under, he knew that he wanted it though.
Draco whimpered, his hips twitching into Potter’s pleasuring hands. He hadn’t even realised that he’d been leaking precum until now, his cheeks scolding as they emitted a crimson glow.
“Jeez, alright! We’re ready.” They muttered at the same time, both placing their attention - once again - back on Hermione.
Draco’s entire body twitched, his knees already buckling under his weight at the demand. He wanted to rebel against the other’s words so badly but the pure urge to follow his orders was starting to win out as it creeped up his neck.
All Draco could do was let out a choked sound that he couldn’t quite decipher, it was embarrassing nonetheless. Potter’s words came out in a pernicious manner, it shook him to his core. The words were so cruel sounding yet they turned Draco on in ways he couldn’t believe, he never thought he’d get turned on from the harshness.
Draco was still having trouble believing that in front of his face was his former enemy, moving his hand up and down over his cock with long strokes.
“Okay, enough about the mans cock; you’ll give him an ego problem.” George spoke up out of nowhere, his addition to the conversation making them all share a laugh.
“4 minutes.” Ginny replied as she glanced at her watch to make sure she was correct, she was. Ginny could’ve used tempus but honestly she just could not be arsed, being way more invested in what Harry was going through and how she could help if needed.
He briefly imagined, not just how it would stretch his lips to the absolute limit, but probably choke him to his death. He felt his cock ache in his pants, his mouth now full of saliva. Pure from the fact that he’d been thinking about Potter’s cock in his mouth, the more he thought about it the more he craved it.
Draco gasped as he was pulled from the memory, so vivid that if felt like he was there. He felt warmth engulf his body, a sense of calm washing over him like the soft crash of ocean waves. Most of the time, he buried that memory down - forgetting that it even existed. The reason being that he hated thinking about his father, it always made his heart twitch when he had the guts to remember it; to be met with the memory of how Harry had helped him. It made him stop burying it over time, just so he could block out Lucius and focus on that certain raven haired man.
“-Which me and Harry thought were bullshit.” He quickly mumbled out an apology, just from the look he received from the other. Fred and George cackled at how one look from the girl said so much.
Ron groaned as Harry allowed himself to grin a little at his friends annoyance, no matter what the situation; it seemed that his friends could always make him laugh and smile. The wholesomeness of his thought was majorly undermined by the pleasure that pulsated throughout his body at the next moment.
After the breath of relief that they had all collectively let out, they allowed themselves to chuckle at Harry’s words. Hermione sniggered and Neville spoke,
His whole body shivered violently, an almost inaudible whine melting out of his slightly ajar mouth that nobody else bar Harry heard. He liked it better that way, being the only one to hear the sweet noises spilling unintentionally out of Draco’s pretty mouth.
He only looked up when he heard that menacing yet captivating chuckle come lowly from Potter’s mouth, he noticed that it now sounded further away - he had walked back to the Gryffindor table.
The thought made him remember the erection straining painfully in his jeans, he hoped that the look in his eyes showed the other how much he craved him. Usually, he’d do anything he could to hide the want he had for the other. But at this moment, he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Draco inhaled a shaky breath, his frame trembling as he cowered away from the intense gaze he was being shot. His body buzzed from the anticipation of what Harry’s next words were gonna be, he had a feeling that they’d push him over the edge.
Well, Harry had an idea. He could speak easily, he wasn’t the one struggling with it. He knew that the pretty blonde in front of him, however, was clearly doing everything he could to avoid it. He knew that Draco felt embarrassed anytime he stuttered on his words but it just made Harry adore him even more, like he said; he found it adorable.
Hermione was staring up at the ceiling, seemingly lost in thought before she coughed quietly and looked back at the rest of them; zoning back into the amusing conversation.
His friends’ eyes widened, so did the Slytherin’s. Especially Draco’s, the clear show of power that Potter had was just succeeding in making him smitten. He knew that Potter was extremely powerful, if not the most powerful.
“Most importantly, he wanted me to marry. A woman. So when he found gay porn magazines he was not happy.”
He didn’t even notice that Neville had joined them at the table, he wouldn’t have either unless he hadn’t heard his friends greet him.
“Hermione, Ron?” The two looked at Pansy after hearing their names, sending her a curious glance. Grinning when she nodded her head towards Harry and Draco.
“To be fair to him, even if he did get off, he’d still be hard. Another thing we learnt from last time.” Hermione explained as she pushed her light chocolate, still slightly bushy, hair behind her ear.
“Oh yes.” Fred, George, Ginny and Ron muttered - extremely interested in what they were about to see.
Harry only sniggered, mirroring Draco’s actions as he crossed his own arms. The blonde had gotten distracted from how muscular the Gryffindor’s arms looked, how his veins were popping out more than usual. His breath hitched in his throat, catching himself and looking back to his face.
“I wish those two idiots would stop talking so we can hear what she’s going to say.” Pansy groaned, quietly enough that she wouldn’t alert the Gryffindor table.
He finally felt his breathing and heartbeat start to decrease, he let his eyes slip shut so he could fully focus on the task and on the words that we being spoken to him. Harry was still holding Draco’s other hand, squeezing it every so often to remind him that he wasn’t alone - he would then squeeze back.
He was being grabbed harshly by his hips and spun around, he was faced with an unnerving figure - who he had strain his neck up to look at properly.
“We-We have experience in this, it’ll be okay.” All three of them made eye contact, utterly flabbergasted that this was happening again.
Harry’s words were threatening and malicious sounding, his voice so gravelly that it shook Draco to his core, rumbled throughout his very bones. His cock twitched again and he whimpered as quietly as he could, Harry heard it though. He could tell by the way he could feel his smirk against his skin, then the heat was gone and he was back in his normal position.
Harry knew how much power surrounded him, both him and his magic wanted to ruin the boy beneath him. And he would, in due time. He also knew that Draco would fucking love it.
An accidental whine slipped past his lips, his hand subconsciously pressing harder on to the bruises that were no doubt there. The thought of Harry marking him up, high enough that they couldn’t be hidden, had him squeezing his thighs together.
Draco whimpered again as his cloak was taken off of his body, Potter physically hadn’t touch him but the tingling sensation that had wrapped itself around his body made him realise that it was the other’s magic - his heart stammered in his chest. Never would he get tired of watching Potter do wandless magic. He watched as his cloak was hung up before he was once again, the centre of Harry’s attention.
“What even was the ingredient?” Blaise piped up, now interested in the conversation as both Fred and George had gone off topic and brought the story telling to a halt.
He had no fucking idea why Potter was staring at him like that, was it to tease him? He had doubts from the seriousness of their shared look, the smirk present on his teasing lips.
He dropped his towel to the floor, extremely glad that the Slytherin dorms were a nice temperature from using a strong heating charm, it was definitely needed down in the dungeons.
If the man could do this to himself and be completely fine, what the fuck was he gonna do to tease Draco. The thought made him squirm, he knew that Potter was going to make him suffer in the best way.
Despite the situation, Harry felt his heart pound warmly and happily inside his chest. Fred and George, no matter how big of a nuisance they both were, loved him like a brother.
What he didn’t expect, however, was for Potter to start smirking at him. His gaze, once more, turning into one of pure hunger. Draco’s body wracked with icy chills that kissed each ridge of his spine, that only made the bastard smirk more.
“Excuse me.” Harry uttered out the words to the girl he recognised as Pansy, usually she was full of things to say but this time - she said nothing. All she did was slide to the right and out of his way, not throwing one bit of spite his way. Harry didn’t want to admit how much he got off on it, being in control in a safe way always made him feel high.
He felt his heart stutter in his chest at the other’s tone, he didn’t know how he was going to speak again after the absolute train wreck his last sentence was.
Draco could feel the piercing eyes of his friends on him as he tried to make himself so small that he’d just disappear, he prayed for the floor to swallow him whole.
“Anyway.” Hermione pointed her gaze towards the twins, not being able to help the small smile playing on her shiny lips.
Harry’s tongue licked across Draco’s bottom lip, he gave him access immediately. The blonde was melting into every touch, the way Harry sucked on his tongue before going back to nipping his lip made him moan contently.
“Maybe he thinks it was somebody else.” Goyle tried to persuade them all but deep down, they all knew they were royally fucked.
Draco took an instinctive step back as arousal swirled aggressively in his gut, Potter took another step forward.
He let out a defeated sigh, moving over his cauldron to inhale. His senses were filled instantly, for a second he considered lying but knew that somehow Snape would probably figure it out.
Potter was just teasing him now, purposely wanting him to feel the way he did. He was growing to, no matter how much he despised himself for it, crave it.
“Harry…” Oh no, this was not good. His friends voice was slow and careful, at first not knowing whether to carry on with her sentence or just try forget. Harry felt the eyes of everybody boring holes into him, the attention making him want to curl in on himself. He hated attention.
Draco didn’t say anything back straight away, he didn’t trust his voice after the words that had come out of the Gryffindor’s mouth. It took him a couple minutes to finally speak.
Just as Harry was about to begin walking over to them, the thoughts in his head upped their game tremendously - a searing pain burned through his head. He gripped it from the pain, groaning as his knees buckled slightly.
His gaze was on his friends as they stared at him with baffled expressions. His entrancing eyes flicked towards Draco momentarily, which filled his body with a buzz of need.
The blonde enjoyed that moment of calm before he took a deep breath in and bravely looked up, arousal once again took over his body. The mood shifted back to one of lustful heat, enveloping the two of them.
“So, bringing back time a bit. Harry ended up talking to us about also liking boys, which I think we all already knew. He was talking about liking a specific boy too but we’ll get to that later.” Hermione gave everyone a shit-eating grin, enjoying how she could control them slightly.
He’d seen Draco naked multiple times in the Quidditch shower rooms after games, he had never taken much time to look as that would be fucking weird. And as much as he wanted to fuck the boy till he forgot his own name, he knew boundaries. Even Malfoy deserved his privacy. Yet here he was using the sparse memories of that milky flesh he’d seen in those situations in his fantasies, nice one.
“He a good kisser, ay Ron?” Fred joked, throwing a bunched up piece of paper at him to catch his attention.
“It doesn’t match the weather, either. It’s enchanted only for the night sky, thought it’d be nicer that way.”
“I’ll tell you when he’s out.” The twins nodded, even though they were definitely not the most patient - they knew that it’d be worth it.
Draco and his friends’ conversations were abruptly cut short as they watched none other than Potter, waltz into the room. His hair was more of a mess than usual and fluffed up, telling how his hands had been threaded through it. Draco also couldn’t help but notice the dark look that resided in the other’s eyes.
Potter sat back with the same grin on his face as Draco ached to have those large, captivating hands that were lounging on his knees, either touching him or inside of him - he wanted either and or.
“Remember, there’s no counter potion, unfortunately. We just have to wait till it wears off.” Ginny spoke with sympathy in her voice, pouting slightly.
“The staircases kept changing, smarter than I thought they were.” Draco mumbled out, incredibly proud of himself for not stuttering but knowing that Potter would eventually make him lose all of his put on stableness.
Harry spoke in a gravelly voice, letting his gaze wander freely to the table in front of him. Draco and his friends all gulped at now being the centre of Potter’s attention, the blonde felt his hands shake at the tone of Harry’s voice alone.
Before Draco found another way to embarrass himself, his attention focused on conversation that he could hear outside the door.
“Oh please, I can see right through you. You act like such a bitch, protecting yourself with that bratty attitude of yours. When really, you’d follow any demand I’d give you in an instant, wouldn’t you.”
“Yeah?” He was melting under Harry’s gaze, the butterflies were back. He could barely breathe at how warm and inviting his hand was.
His mouth no longer directly at his ear but had shifted down slightly to his neck, he could feel the ghost of his lips on him. He wanted nothing more for Harry to close the gap, he knew though, knew that he was being teased. He almost let a whimper slip past his lips, then he remembered that he needed to reply. He did not trust his voice.
“Obviously. It’s better that way.” It was Ginny’s turn to roll her eyes as she dropped her fist on the table, Ron decided that she didn’t need to know about the cooling charm. Another thing that he could wind up his sister about, oh how he loved annoying the girl.
He placed the glass of half full water back on to the nightstand as he returned to his place, resting against the headboard to keep himself up. He needed it, especially since Potter’s attention was now all on him; yet again.
Harry went to elbow her as a way of saying ‘you will do no such thing’ before the potion upped its game in meddling with his thoughts.
His gaze flickered back up to his face, taking great pleasure in seeing his cheeks glow a dark, crimson red at what he was doing to his lower half. He chuckled lowly and menacingly at how embarrassed the other looked.
hey, before you read, i'm sorry if some parts are a little cringe; this is purely just something to let out creatively and i hope you enjoy :)
Ginny chuckled as she referred to Fred and George, the slight shock of Harry’s words now ebbing away.
His gaze shifted to Harry’s friends, they must’ve felt his eyes on them as each and every one of them looked right back up at him. The same unnerving smirk on their lips as his own friends had, he blushed and forced himself to turn away.
He had heard that it was a gift from his godfather, Sirius - he had good style so it didn’t surprise him. Potter did too, his clothes were mostly simple but he had a thing of making anything look good. Harry was currently wearing a plain black t-shirt, the same coloured jeans and he still looked like a damn god. No matter whether he was dressed down, dressed up or other - Draco would still drool over him.
Despite his natural tendencies to rebel, he had a new sensation inside him that he hadn’t felt before - he had a realisation that only Potter could bring it out of him. One to give himself completely to the other’s power, allow himself to give in and do nothing other than obey. The thought made his cock throb, only adding to the excitement that coursed through his body.
Finally, after some more struggling - the jeans were on. He wasted no time in putting on the shirt, his fingers buttoning it up with quick motion. It was shameful how many times he’d had to button up quick like this, usually it was because he was running late for an event or something but this time it was more important. He did not want to be late for meeting with Potter.
At the time, he had no fucking idea what was happening. All he knew was that he couldn’t breathe, overwhelming bouts of panic, feeling as if he was going to pass out at any second and losing control over everything.
“I just wanted to say, Harry. Maybe try cut down the cursing, I understand the circumstances. Plus, you’ve caught me on a good day. So a warning is all you’re getting.” Hermione smiled happily, glad he wasn’t getting in trouble like usual.
“May I?” His voice matched his caring eyes, he had stepped forward to hold onto the blonde’s shoulders. Draco immediately gripped Harry’s forearms, grounding himself without even knowing it.
“That’s great ‘Mione, wanna say it any louder.” Harry hissed out, no actual malice lacing his words. Somewhere deep inside, he found it funny. The natural embarrassment always won over though.
“It’s getting late and I’ve got some stuff to do.” His eyes an acid green as they burned straight through him, but Draco picked up on how they shimmered a ruby colour which could barely be seen from the stygian presence that overpowered his irises.
Draco’s cock began to throb from the absolute vulgar words that fell so easily from Potter’s dirty, devil of a mouth. And oh would he die to be on the receiving end of it, in all senses of the word.
The whole Weasley clan did and it made Harry feel so genuinely happy, any time any of them mentioned it he couldn’t help but want to sob with joy. Obviously he didn’t but he always felt like it. His friends made him feel like that too, he knew he was unbelievably lucky to find such love from friends. Before he got all mushy and sappy on everyone he shook his head and concentrated on what the twins were going to do or say.
Draco looked mortified and Harry thrived off of it, the boy still hadn’t looked up to him. He knew why, he was scared.
He had caught him looking at his hard on, oh fuck. Harry had seen him practically drooling over the other’s cock, his cheeks flooded with colour from pure embarrassment as he quickly averted his gaze away from Potter’s enticing and dark eyes - choosing to stare at the very interesting floor instead.
“I also know that none of you would want to be known as “snitches” but if anybody ever shit talks you for something you can’t change, tell a te- never mind. Tell Pansy.” That was the first time they’ve seen the professor smile properly in a long while, it was strange to see. They knew he had a heart but his behaviour in their previous years had made them try think of him as a monster. Now they were older, everything was a lot less cloudy. They also were all kinda shocked that he had just swore in front of him.
The blonde’s eyebrows twitched, wordlessly questioning ‘how’. Harry clicked his fingers and he watched as the enchanted visuals faded away, the ceiling just like the rest of the dorms.
“Now.” The assertiveness that oozed from Harry’s words like silk made Draco whine, his back arching up as it searched for friction that the other was not allowing him. He fucking loved the way that Potter tortured him.
Draco felt himself starting to sweat under the harshness of Harry’s eyes, he could practically see the thoughts fleeing through his head. He had an idea that they were about things that would make him blush more than he already was, if such thing were possible.
Neville shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, a couple years ago his friends would’ve been perplexed at his language. Now they had grown up together and were such close friends, they were used to it. A strangely wholesome thought, drastically different to the words he had just spoke.
The tone was condescending and Draco pondered why it turned him on so much, his arms unlocked as his hands fell back into his lap - squeezing them together tightly.
His cock so close to his face, on purpose. Harry was sitting like that just to mock the blonde, showing that he was above him and that he was in control. Draco never thought that he’d get off on something like this, but now he had figured it out, it was ever so clear in his mind.
Draco could tell instantly that there was something underlying his words and it scared the shit out of him as his cock throbbed in time with the beat of his rapid heart.
It felt a little strange to him, being obedient. He liked it, he liked it a lot. Potter wasn’t here right now, nowhere near. Yet Draco was following his orders like they were all he knew, he hoped that the other would be pleased.
“After a while, Ron admitted that he liked both guys and girls but finished his announcement by telling me that he loved me. If you remember, that’s actually how we got together.” Hermione giggled softly at how her boyfriend’s cheeks had turned a fiery red.
Harry broke out of their eye contact when a familiar voice peaked up, he moved his attention back towards the Gryffindor table.
His worries faded away as he heard Narcissa laugh softly, a grateful glint in her warming and welcoming eyes.
“God and that blush. Makes you seem so innocent when really, I know different. I’m gonna really enjoy dirtying you up, corrupting you.”
Harry tried to hold in his annoyance, knowing that Snape would very gladly take more points if he felt like it. The boys shared a look as Ron rushed to his seat, luckily near the front so they wouldn’t have to do the walk of shame to the back.
Draco’s breath hitched at the vulgar language that slipped so easily from Potter’s mouth, he made sure to ignore the sinful thoughts that were starting to dissolve into his head.
He then felt somebody touch his chin and move it up, he recognised them as Pansy’s hands. Why had she done that? Oh. He hadn’t even realised that his mouth was agape, that was slightly embarrassing.
Draco would’ve whimpered out loud if he still wasn’t clinging to the remaining crumbs of his dignity, he gulped again.
“Parkinson.” Snape looked up to her, there wasn’t malice in his tone though. Just a slight warning, she could see that there was no anger in his eyes.
He ended up picking out some black, ripped jeans. Draco had to admit, they were his tattiest and possibly- no, definitely- sluttiest pair. They were ripped at the knees, as those types of jeans usually were and a few scattered across the leg.
“It’s common knowledge at this point so don’t even look at me like that.” He raised his eyebrows at them all as they muttered their defeat, he couldn’t help but cackle.
The bone-chilling chuckle that Harry let out had Draco whining needily, he’d already been reduced to such a mess - just from the other.
His face was so close to Potter’s cock, he could practically feel the heat radiating from it just from their proximity. He struggled to swallow around the dry of his mouth, contrasting to how his mouth wanted to water at the sight but physically couldn’t. It was even better up close, he couldn’t rip his gaze off of it.
“Now, we knew what the basics were to expect. Ron was gonna be love eyed and Harry, just a little sexually excited.” Ginny giggled along with Hermione as they relived that night, her words painting a perfect picture to the twins who hadn’t been there but wished they could have been.
With the same devastatingly tempting and almost sinister grin, Harry leaned down to Draco’s ear. The heat of his body made Draco wanted to sob and beg the other to do something, he had to remembered that they were in the Great Hall.
“Could you give everybody a reminder?” Ginny giggled at how Harry rolled his eyes, her brother’s shared her grin.
At first it hadn’t worked all that well, then Draco had began to mimic what he was feeling through his hand that was pressed against Harry’s chest.
“How many times have you worn these?” Harry’s voice was controlled and confident, everything that Draco’s was not.
Releasing his hand from over Malfoy’s mouth, he used the rest of his restraint to pull away from the other.
All his focus was put onto not thinking about Harry, thinking about the Gryffindor did nothing but fill him with enticing desires that made his cock want to harden.
Draco could not breathe. His friends around him were muttering about what the fuck was going on, Potter being in a legitimate trance and all; also how he looked and how his friends were reacting. But none of them had noticed where, who, Potter’s gaze was stuck on.
There was still comfortable noises coming from the Gryffindor dorms, however, there was a deafening silence between Draco and Harry and none of them knew which were going to break it first.
Harry took his sweet time as he began his walk to the Slytherin table, making direct eye contact during his extremely intimidating stride.
“Actually, nevermind. Fuck doing nothing.” He swung his leg over the bench, alerting his friends of what he was about to do.
The rough grunts that left Potter’s mouth had Draco throbbing in the tight restraints of his jeans, whimpering when he felt precum trickle down his throat; leaving the taste of salt in its wake. He didn’t even know what sounds he was making anymore, they were muffled by the harsh thrust of Potter’s hips and cock in his throat.
Ron laughed but Draco could tell he was being serious, it made his cheeks grow an even darker red. How Harry’s friends were talking about the fact he was going to get fucked so hard that he’d struggle to walk, he felt so very exposed.
Potter yanked Draco’s hair again, pulling him completely off his cock. The boy sputtered and his hands fell from where they gripped Harry thighs, to the floor. His jaw and mouth, somehow, hurt even more now. His whole head was in pain at this point but all it did was mingle delicious with the ever-growing pleasure in his gut.
The first thing he caught sight of was those pale and light blue, practically grey eyes that were shining up at him. Flickering from reciprocating the eye contact and back down. Harry didn’t understand at first until he too flicked his gaze down, realising that the boy was staring at his bulge.
He also knew that his words were a lie, he knew for a fact that it had already began to kick in. Maybe he just said that to make his friends be less suspicious that he was about to start jacking off under the table or something, that did sound kinda interesti-fuck.
The blonde couldn’t do anything under that expression as he gave in, asking no verbal questions. He had only just put his hand on his arm when oh, they were apparating.
He eventually ended up picking one of his many black button ups, it was up against his black turtleneck but he remembered how hot he gets in it so the shirt won. Draco very much enjoyed his black clothing, he felt as if he didn’t suit many colours so practically all his clothes had the same pigment.
Draco’s school trousers were gone in an instant, one of the many good things about this specific effect from the potion. It was kinda like lucid dreaming, one thought from Harry and it would happen. That was all it took to strip the boy of his clothing and have his soft, snowflake skin exposed to his eager eyes.
Draco couldn’t keep the moan in as it came out broken from how raw his throat was, he had no idea how he was going to speak tomorrow.
Harry sat back, for the first time he took his eyes off of the only thing he wanted to see and strained his neck to look around him. Draco’s friends all had wide eyes, those of shock that their friend hadn’t been beaten into the ground. It made his grin wider, they probably had no idea that Harry was planning to break the other apart in the best way possible.
Harry slammed both his hands down onto the table, causing both his friends and the Slytherin’s - who were entranced in watching the Gryffindor’s - to jump.
“There’s nothing to be nervous about, Harry. The worst thing that could happen is you and Draco have a duel in there, or that could be the best thing - depending on what kind of duel.” Hermione winked, revelling in the blush that dusted Harry’s cheeks. He gave her a nudge.
He gradually opened his eyes to be met with Harry’s own, now looking less concerned than they were before.
“Basically, Harry was complaining that he was horny and after me telling him to deal with it he started complaining more just to spite me. He’s a bitch.” She giggled as she made eye contact with said bitch, the small smirk he was wearing making her laugh more.
So proud, that he hadn’t even realised how messy everything was. Spit was already covering his now sticky hand, some dripping down to Potter’s balls and even to his thighs. Most of it had dripped onto his jeans, cold against his bare skin because of the rips.
He was confused at what Harry had meant by that before the pieces started clicking together, he knew what the other wanted. Draco remembered exactly what had been said to him and he blushed heavily, shards of humiliation cutting through him at being made to repeat such words.
Putting his mind to work, he put the last of his focus on ignoring his half hard arousal and finishing off his potions evaluation.
“Snape asked Draco to say what he smelled, he smells you!” Immediately, Harry put his head back down - cradling it with his hands.
Draco knew that he couldn’t speak, his voice far too weak and shaky - unstable, even. But the way the Gryffindor raised a dark eyebrow, challenging him, made him have the urge to speak.
His words were not a question, they was a statement. A demand almost, Draco wanted to sob at how they filled his body with arousing warmth - he could tell it wasn’t gonna be long until his body started to physically show it.
Before he could even begin to think about what happened, Harry had covered Draco’s mouth with his own.
Draco quickly zoned out on their conversation as it gradually died down, then remembering why exactly he was there. He shuffled back around on his knees, pausing when he had returned to the place he was in before. He was nervous to meet Potter’s eyes again, his groin tingling in excitement.
The twins were still unashamedly watching their friend and his rousing actions whilst making teasing comments under their breath, Ginny attempted to stop them by throwing a bread roll at them; of course that did nothing as they both started wrestling for the food. That was until Harry spoke again.
Harry’s head perked up, searching around the room to make sure nobody - specifically a teacher that would, to his luck, be right behind him - had heard. He couldn’t hold back the cringe that showed on his face when he saw some of the Slytherin table staring, he could only hope that they were just giving him the usual dead eye.
After finally making it up the staircase, he had tried to lounge around and lean against the wall. The Gryffindor’s painting of the fat lady was seemingly asleep, he hoped so anyway. He knew that the paintings here were a whole hell of a lot smarter than they let on, it wouldn’t surprise him if the fat lady was just pretending to be asleep.
“Class is dismissed, I hope you enjoy your free period. I can’t wait to see you in 2 days time.” The class all shared a puzzled look, Snape had never looked so excited for them to come back. Usually, he was having to hold back from cursing them.
“Just turn around and look in the mirror.” He found his eyes rolling at her demand but not saying anything as he followed it, turning around and then craning his neck to look. And oh-
This was a common occurrence for the friends, after Harry’s scar acted up they’d all place either their cool hands or wet rags against his forehead to soothe the pain. Most of the time just to cool him down, sometimes though they got shocked. The tingling sensation of magic thrumming through their bodies, it was sometimes even painful. This only made the friends feel more sympathy. Harry’s scar acted up a lot, recently it had calmed down a little but that didn’t take the edge off; more like made them more wary. After nightmares, flashbacks, visions and many other things is when his friends would have to step in and help. Ron shook the thoughts from his head to focus on Harry, he was what’s important.
Draco was so transfixed in Potter’s demanding eyes, which were staring into his fucking soul, that he had almost forgotten to respond.
He had cringed throughout his whole sentence, purely from how much he had stuttered. It did make him feel better when he remembered that Potter had called it adorable, it slipped his mind that he’d just babbled out his original plan.
Draco gulped, nodding his head hesitantly. Just from the tone of Harry’s voice, he could tell that something was off.
The way Malfoy was reacting to his actions and words, had his cock straining harder against the material of his jeans. Even though he could clearly see that the other that Draco was more than fine with the situation, his heart hammering, sweating and shaking profusely, how he kept reverting to nibbling on his lips to keep those delectable noises in, and especially the boner that had risen in his pants - he still wanted verbal consent.
He had whimpered pitifully, embarrassment causing his cheeks to burn. When he saw Potter grinning at him, it only made it worse. His stomach twisted in shameful pleasure as he swallowed around the other, his other hand that still gripped Harry’s thigh twitched - wanting to touch himself.
“Well, you made it a lust potion completely by accident. Those weren’t even the ingredients for the potion, all that was needed was one spoonful - right?” Pansy tried to make sense of it as she wracked her brain, audibly stating the facts in hopes that she would somehow understand it better.
Draco could not believe his ears, he thought the other would be a lot more shy and unwilling to share his feelings. For some reason, he just accepted that he was the one to get rejected. This, this was music to his ears.
He knew that Potter had some kind of idea about the potion as he’d overheard his friends’ conversation earlier, he really didn’t want to admit - after he told him that he hadn’t made it - his reason for it.
“No shit, way for stating the obvious. You’ve really only just noticed? I’ve been standing here for ages. Also, I’ve been rock fucking hard for about an hour now.”
“As much as I’d like to fuck you against the floor or up against the wall, I’d prefer you to be comfortable.” Harry’s lips turned into a bewitching grin at the fiery blush that made its way onto to Draco’s cheeks, his reaction was incredibly amusing.
Draco nodded at Potter’s words, getting slightly lost from his hypnotic voice. He was still a tad confused about how the ceiling became enchanted, the other understood the expression.
He ruffled his hair a little before deciding that it was good enough, he did look good. Walking over to his dresser, he sprayed on the minimalist amount of cologne. Draco didn’t want the other to think he was trying too hard but his brain was also beginning to stop working as he realised that it was now 9:55pm, he needed to go.
The shaking boy on the bed couldn’t help but think that now his school cloak would probably smell of Harry, it disturbed him how giddy it got him.
“Well, I was gonna go round the room anyway and ask everyone what they smelled. Might as well start with you.” Draco hated the smug smirk on Snape’s face right now.
Every shock of pain that Potter’s teeth on his neck caused, shot straight down to his swollen prick.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione’s eyes locked again. Unless they were imagining it, they were sure that Harry smelt like that.
A glass then broke on the table, well, not broke. A glass then shattered on the table, quickly forming into tens of thousands of tiny little pieces. It was no longer glass shards, just dust that now covered part of the table. The poor cup had been eviscerated, to put it simply.
Harry took Draco’s chin and forced him to look up so that they were making eye contact, forcing him to look into those alluring and stygian eyes.
“That isn’t how you were acting when you were making out though, was it?” Ginny teased, a sharp grin appearing on her features.
“I just wanted to say, when Potter comes in. Anything homophobic comes out of any of your mouths and I’ll shove my fist so far down your throat that-“
Every so often, the books that he had held tightly against his crotch to hide his arousal from showing, would rub against his still hard prick. He had to bite back the groan of pleasure that wanted to rip its way out his mouth, his walk getting increasingly faster. It took everything inside of him not to start full on running, he knew that it’d look to suspicious and weird though.
Harry nodded at Draco’s words, keeping his eyes locked onto the blonde - enjoying how he knew the other would probably begin to feel unnerved.
Draco's already worn out - in the best way, of course - but little does he know that Harry hasn't even begun with him yet.
Harry came to a decision in his head, he’d been standing up for way too long and his legs were beginning to go numb. It didn’t help either when he was still experiencing shocks of pleasure every couple minutes. It was finally time.
He finally forced his eyes to drift up from the absolute monster of a bulge that he now knew resided in Potter’s pants, inhaling shakily as his grey eyes met darkened ones full of lust.
“It’s okay, by the way. Liking guys, I do too. Nobody in here cares either and Pansy threatened that if any of them were to say something, she’d fuck them up - to put it simply.” Harry could barely believe it, Pansy would stick up for him?
All Draco could make out from Ron’s response was something with ‘bloody hell’, his laughter made his words hard to decipher. Potter was chuckling again, the Slytherin’s face was on fire.
Pushing the embarrassment that was surely to follow to the side, Draco nodded his head - more desperately than he would ever admit. When he heard the man towering over him tut, he knew he was done for.
As much as he’d like to stay there and comfort him, Lucius was being brought out any minute. Draco didn’t want to admit how much he liked the warmth that seemed to radiate from Harry, how he felt a little sad at letting him go - he covered it up with a cough.
“I agree. It only started because I was a stubborn little child who lashed out when I didn’t get what I wanted.” Draco felt guilt run through his veins, the regret showing on his face.
He tried to focus on how soft the sheets were, silk against his hands. The room was silent, he wondered how long Potter would purposefully not say anything; his only motive was to build even more tension to - no doubt - break Draco just a little bit more.
“Colloportus.” Draco heard the lock click and it made breath hitch a little, he had seemingly forgotten why he was there. The sound reminded him though, Potter didn’t want them to be disturbed.
He was ever so grateful for Harry, he had been there at his trial - testifying against him. This was back before Draco had realised he really wanted to be fucked by him and they were still “enemies”, that day felt different though.
He rubbed his fingers over the rim of his hole in a feather light touch, basking in the way Draco’s whole frame trembled. Almost pushing back on his fingers, Harry didn’t allow them to slip in though. He got off on the thought of teasing the other until he was near tears.
Harry shook his head, a menacing chuckle leaving his lips unintentionally. He didn’t know why he was laughing, the Slytherin’s knew that meant they were in trouble though.
The jeans were incredibly, no, ridiculously tight. At first he had thought Pansy had picked the wrong side when she had informed him that it was just how they were, he had disliked them at first. Not really comfortable, that didn’t last for long though. Considering he had an awesome best friend who loved to hype him up, sharing her confidence in him and making him gradually less and less self conscious. He really did appreciate and love Pansy.
Potter’s hand was then pushing the right side of his cloak open and pulling out Draco’s wand, the blonde really should have been more suspicious of what the other was doing - he could’ve done anything. When he saw him pointing it towards the lock of the door, he knew that his calmness was for good reason.
“Hey guys, I’ll be quick. Harry’s been slipped a lust potion, hasn’t he.” Harry’s head shot up to look at Neville, who raised an eyebrow at him as the rest nodded.
He brought a shaky hand up to scratch at his neck, trying to pretend as if he was invisible. But of course, nothing could ever go that smoothly. Just as he put the pressure on his throat, he had gasped. A rousing ache filling his senses, it took him a moment to remember why he was feeling small spikes of pain - that just added to the heat between his legs.
Harry noticed how Malfoy’s hands were twitching from where they lay in his lap, no doubt wanting to touch. And who was Harry to keep him waiting.
“Did I hear the words ‘lust potion’?” She was very interested in hearing what had to be said as she tried to hold back her grin.
“You know how he usually has nightmares? Well when he finally got to sleep, all of his dreams were sex dreams. He admitted that to us in the morning.” Ron snorted, even though it was extremely peculiar - it was still a good night.
“Hey! You don’t know how insufferable it is to try get turned on by a girl! It’s incredibly frustrating!” The look he received from Hermione made his mouth stop running. “Okay, maybe I’ve been questioning and experimenting for a while…”
They had all expected Potter to get angry when he found out it was them, even more pissed when he was told Draco was the one who came up with it. None of them, not even in their wildest dreams, would’ve thought that was Harry he was going to react.
The grin hadn’t gone from Harry’s mouth, only stretched more into an almost cruel smirk. He let his eyes set fire to the boy below him, subconsciously pushing his boots more into his thighs. Not causing great pain to him but a reminder that he had to obey his command, his body completely trapping him.
They all grabbed their bags and walked towards the door, sharing small glances with each other. Hermione had Harry’s hand within hers tightly, feeling good after the talk.
Harry’s cock was once again pushed inside his mouth, he immediately suctioned his cheeks around him; now slightly more used to the girth and size yet still very not used to it. He rubbed his tongue against whatever he could, moaning when Harry returned his hand to the back of his head whilst the other stayed tangled in his sweaty hair.
They were breathless when they had eventually and reluctantly pulled away. Harry’s hands rested on both sides of the blonde’s head as he slipped his large thigh between Draco’s weak legs, pushing it up against his pulsating prick.
“You okay?” He recognised Pansy’s voice as he nodded, not even bothering to look at her face as he ran a hand through his soft locks. If he had looked at her face then he would’ve seen the shit-eating grin that played on her lips.
“The effects of the lust potion have almost ran out, however, what’s remaining is still putting up a good fight - though now it’s controllable.”
“But. If you do want this, then oh baby. You’re gonna go through such a gorgeous mixture of pain and pleasure and you’re gonna be screaming my name as I make you cum. First, I need your consent.
Draco’s thoughts, however, were starting to take him on a ride and he hated how he wasn’t repulsed by them.
He had always been modest about it but in this moment, he was so wound up from the potion that he didn’t mind showing off. Honestly, he was kinda proud of how big his cock was - but maybe that was the lust potion talking.
“That mouth is in need of a good throat fucking, baby. Maybe this will finally shut that pretty mouth up.”
Goddamn Potter, his body shook more than he wanted to admit from how the Gryffindor was messing with him.
He gave no time for the Slytherin to answer, the rhetorical question unnerving him with how Potter seemed so keen to answer.
“Let’s just try ignore that and get back on with the story, my brothers are dying to know.” Ginny sent Harry an over-exaggerated wink, giggling at how the other slammed his head on the table.
“I-I-um-I need to-“ Before he could make anymore of a fool of himself, he was interrupted by Pansy; he was secretly grateful.
Harry felt the sweat starting to gather under his collar as he shrugged his cloak off and placed it underneath him, still boiling even though he was only in his shirt. Then he felt the tingling again, mostly at his thighs. He couldn’t help but let his body squirm from where he sat, his own mind working against him.
Shit, he was staring. Instead of being met with the face of certain death, he was met with a blushing Draco. Unexpected, certainly not a bad thing though. Their moment was interrupted as Snape moved to the front.
His jeans really left nothing to the imagination, he could get away with nothing if a person looked down. The outline so very clear, obscenely showing off his very large size.
Harry unzipped his jeans, Draco’s hungry eyes glued to his lower half. He was gonna have so much fun with him, he luckily had patience - unlike the boy on his knees for him.
“One more thing. Don’t touch that pretty little cock of yours, that’s just for me to touch. You dare cum, Draco, you dare.”
Draco had to hold back a whimper at the pure darkness that lined Potter’s tone, Harry did nothing other than look the blonde up and down in an agonisingly slow way. He really didn’t want how much he was being affected to show but he also knew that he couldn’t hide it very well, he was transparent when it came to the man in front of him.
“How Ron solidified his sexuality questions by making out with Harry.” Ginny shook her head, how her brothers remembered anything was a miracle.
He wasn’t that lucky though, knowing that he was going to meet Potter and do things that he knew was gonna end in being made to cum had his cock still interested. The blonde sighed before rushing to the shower, he’d just have to ignore it. He’d done well so far, he wasn’t going to disobey now.
Draco blinked twice immediately, wanting to show the other just how much he wanted it. That elicited a chilling yet rousing chuckle to come from Potter as he tightened the grip he had of his hair, licking his lips as he spoke.
She smiled down at Ron warmly, usually all they’d do is make snide remarks and faces at each other so this was nice. Maybe the whole Slytherin and Gryffindor rivalry could stop for a little, the whole class was also glad that Snape was choosing to ignore them.
Of course, he wasn’t really sick. He just looked physically affected from the pleasure he was feeling from that damn lust potion, bloody thing. He was using everything in his body to not go live out his fantasies on Draco fucking Malfoy. Hermione didn’t know this, though. Not yet anyway.
Draco had no idea what to do once he sat on the bed, the thoughts in his head were rushing around a million miles per hour; making him slightly dizzy. He tried his best to ignore them as he sat crosslegged and against the headboard, his entire body shaking like a leaf during a storm.
The hot breath on his earlobe that travelled down to his neck made Draco’s eyes flutter, his chest falling and rising in a rapid pace as he tried to ignore that his and Potter’s friends were watching him intently. Seeing how he melted, the tough and hard exterior that he’d worked so hard to build was shattered in seconds - all from the Gryffindor.
His instinct was to nibble nervously on his bottom lip. To try distract himself from the arousal growing in his pants and to try and keep his lip from shaking so much, he did not need Potter seeing him so vulnerable. But he did at the same time.
Draco’s cheeks blushed at the pet name and he cursed himself for finally showing how the other was making him feel, the look he was receiving was dizzying.
“I don’t think I can face him, or them. Even if it is me that he smells, what if everybody makes fun.” Hermione couldn’t hide the sympathy from her face.
Draco knew his words were useless, he had already shown how willing he was for Harry in the Great Hall - how he melted through his fingers like butter. He also recognised how he was beginning to lose his fake cool exterior whilst Potter’s voice and how he held himself was still so very controlled.
“Trust me, Neville, it can. And at this point I’d rather have a heart attack, fuck, I’d even rather fight Voldy again. Nevermind, that’s probably gonna happen soon anyway.”
“I’m not even going to bother asking questions, let’s just go with it.” Hermione mumbled, shaking her head slightly as she spoke - not being able to help it as she chuckled a little in disbelief. She was also glad that her friend had finally made a move, nobody could hear what he had said towards the end but from Malfoy’s reaction she guessed that Harry had done exactly that.
Potter started thrusting, slowly at first as he wanted the other to get used to it. Draco was already whining like a bitch in heat and it had him subconsciously quickening his pace, the fingers dug into his thighs from how much Malfoy struggled to stay stable.
Once again, he looked up at the clock to check the time - he didn’t have to rush but oh did it feel like he did.
He noticed how his “enemy” muttered some words back to them before instantly breaking away from their eyes and continued to look at Draco.
Draco’s jaw then went slack as a high pitched moan drawled its way out, Potter had just found his prostate. And was not giving up on his task to massage the bundle of nerves until Draco was practically convulsing on the desk, his lower back and arse cheeks sticking to the surface from the sweat collecting on his pale skin.
From the angle that he was in, he had the perfect view of the prominent and intimidatingly large bulge that resided in Potter’s jeans.
No matter how much he tried, he couldn’t stop his eyes from flickering down to said bulge - even with those alluring eyes that burned Draco from where he kneeled before him.
Draco tried to lean back before he realised that he couldn’t move any further, he was backed up against the door. He was trapped, his body tingled in anticipation.
“Too hot. Anyway, like you all said. You’d still be able to see it anyway, considering how big my cock is.”
Potter’s words, like a sharpened knife, cut through the sexual tension that Draco was starting to choke on. The blonde also had other ideas of what he would like to choke on, merlin. Potter corrupted his mind into utter filth, he couldn’t find it within himself to care.
He forced to himself to stop thinking about the past and to focus on the present, Potter’s words. Even though it was slightly obvious, he could’ve just wanted him so that he could fuck him - which was highly unlikely anyway - but it was just nice clarification.
He shoved his boxers down to where his jeans were around his thighs, watching his cock as it sprung out. He couldn’t help but groan lowly now the restrictions of his clothes were out of the way, slightly cold air hitting his erection.
“O-Okay.” Even to Draco’s own ears, his words sounded weak. He sounded so submissive already, Potter hadn’t even been towering over him for that long and he was already moulding to his will, his own cock was begging for touch - his ass screaming for something inside of it.
“Hagrid gave me a key, whenever I have a panic attack. It can also be used for hiding me, you know, Voldemort.” Draco cringed slightly at the use of his name, Harry’s enemy always gave him immense creeps.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest at the audible confirmation, he still had many doubts though. Surely he wasn’t the only student to smell like that, he was probably just confusing him for someone else. Malfoy’s scent was now starting to burn his senses in a really good way, his mind was starting to go fuzzy.
He felt himself grow sweatier, his cheeks flushed rose as the colour dusted his skin. It wasn’t a blush from emotion though, he wasn’t that embarrassed. The effects of the potion simply caused his whole body to heat up, which caused his stupid rosy cheeks - he cursed himself in his head. He could battle Voldemort and win yet couldn’t ward off a simple lust potion.
All he knew was that the same Harry Potter was causing his heart to hammer in his chest so hard that he could feel it in his ears and turning him on like nobody ever had before. And he fucking hated how he enjoyed it. Loved it, even.
“Come on, Harry. One of those things is most definitely worse than the other.” She rolled her eyes at his dramatics, a fond smile on her lips.
Draco couldn’t hold back the whimper that slipped from his wet lips, his bottom lip grasped harshly between teeth as he bit down. Pain flooded his senses but only succeeded in mixing into the pleasure and causing his cock to rise some more, he was fucked. It was soon gonna be difficult to hide it. Draco felt mortified as he remembered the noise that had slipped out of his mouth, his chest rising and falling more rapidly than it had all night.
Draco whimpered out, he should’ve never even mentioned it. Now he was being forced to admit to it, he knew for a fact that Potter would tease him in such an enticing way.
Draco sputtered on his words, deciding to completely give up in order to not disintegrate the last microscopic particles of his dignity. If he was being totally honest with himself, he knew that they’d already been destroyed.
“How long do you think the potion will last?” Draco asked in a whisper, definitely not wanting to be heard.
“P-Please.” Was all the Slytherin could get out, it was an answer. He didn’t dare try to say a full sentence though, he wouldn’t be able to force it out. Harry licked his lips in a way that was downright predatory and Draco fucking loved it.
The authority that Potter’s voice held had the blonde’s heart racing, turning his body to the left so that he wouldn’t have to strain his neck. With a deep breath in, his eyes slowly made their way to meet Harry’s; his lungs refused to work when he did.
“2 hours! 1 hour left!” He blurted out, trying to calm himself down. Draco had already decided that he was going to shower, he was planning on it before but now he knew he was meeting Potter - he definitely wanted a shower.
During this time, Ron had pulled out a chocolate bar from his robes. That earned him a disgusted noise from his sister as he unwrapped the bar as quietly as he could.
His “enemy” had just helped him out that, when he didn’t need to do a thing at all. He was so fucking grateful and thankful to Harry for helping him, from the bottom of his heart.
“Hey Nev.” Hermione spoke softly as they all smiled at him, Neville smiled back but it was clear had had a motive for being there.
“How much of the lust ingredient did you, accidentally, put in?” Pansy asked almost inaudibly as she caught on to the conversation topic instantaneously.
“Maybe this is happening because it was ingredients for a love potion but turned into a lust one, it wasn’t supposed to happen so as it changed from love to lust it might’ve got fucked up slightly along the way.”
He’d just think about Snape or something, that would stop his body. Nevermind, he’d just think about what he was going to wear.
He’d love to fuck Draco deep and rough, right here and in front of everyone. Letting everybody know that Draco was his, that he belonged to him. The thought made him groan quietly as he reluctantly averted his eyes away from the gorgeous boy, hoping the other had felt the feverish strength of his look.
Harry Potter was the last person on the world he would’ve expected to rush over to him, he had approached him slowly at first - as if he would startle like an animal. Draco had looked up at him through his tear matted lashes, he hadn’t even known he was crying.
Harry groaned, a whole lot fucking louder than he intended to. His head whipped up from where it was resting on the cool wood table, his ears already starting to turn an angry red. Again, not from embarrassment as much, more from the pure heat emitting from his body.
Really, he just wanted the touch. At that very moment, he looked over to make eye contact with the blonde who starred in his fantasies when stroking his cock.
He also felt his mother’s hand rubbing his back up and down softly, even though she didn’t know how to handle the situation - he appreciated her greatly for still helping.
Everything inside of him was screaming to avoid thinking about the tempting words that came from the other, all he had to do was ignore them - it was more difficult than he expected.
“God, Ginny. You sound like our mother.” Fred grinned at his twin from the way their sister pulled an offended face.
“I appreciate your approach to it. I don’t like to say this very often, but I’m proud of you.” Okay, Snape must’ve been replaced or something. The quick flash of a stern look that he gave showed that he hadn’t though, he was still the same Snape. Just a good day.
Harry’s voice was rougher and deeper than it had been all day, it could’ve even been confused with growling.
He turned around, searching for her. Smiling as he caught her eyes, she reciprocated the smile. That made him feel a lot better. Then Draco caught his eye, for a moment he couldn’t breathe before he managed to turn back around.
After swallowing, he let himself choke on it a little as he breathed heavily through his nose - he finally adjusted to it as Potter slowed his thrusts down and pulled back a little. Draco soon made small noises of complaint which just made Harry chuckle, already increasing his pace.
What if Hermione had lied, what if the other boy hadn’t said that at all. His panic was soon forcefully erased by Snape’s voice.
“M-My friends heard G-Granger and Weasley talking about y-your crush, they told me and I-I thought we should slip y-you a love potion - so we could have i-information on you.”
When he felt the mattress dipping, he had no choice. He shifted his eyes to see that Harry was now sitting on the edge of the side of the bed, twisting his body to look at the shivering blonde.
Only after he gave the finished potion to Pansy, who was the one appointed to sneak it into Potter’s drink, had he realised his error. He explained his mistake nervously to the rest of his friends, just as Pansy walked back through the door to explain that she had been successful in her task.
“It was Draco’s idea!” Blaise sputtered instantly, not knowing how pissed off Potter was. He felt the blonde’s eyes burning holes into his head, he did feel bad but at the same time - Harry had always been more Draco’s business.
“Why does the room smell like it’s drenched in Malfoy’s cologne? And hair gel. Damn, that vanilla’s ruining my nose.”
Potter was staring at him expectedly, almost daring him with his eyes. Draco knew exactly what that look meant; he was challenging him to speak. He hadn’t spoken a word since he’d asked what would happen if he rebelled, Harry had made him eat up his words.
“Because it’s a panic room, Mcgonagall enchanted the ceiling for something relaxing. I can switch it anytime though.”
It had taken him a little longer than 5 minutes to reach the outside of the Gryffindor dorms and he hoped that Potter wasn’t angry, from the clock on the wall it had shown that it was 10:03pm. He wasn’t extraordinarily late but he wasn’t on time either, Draco had a valid excuse that he was ready to give.
The two reached up as Harry stood between them and placed their hands on his forehead, knowing that their hands were cold. They didn’t need to stand considering how even though the younger boy had grown tremendously, they were still a whole lot taller than him.
“I’m sorry as well, I was a dick too.” Malfoy smiled, as Harry moved his hand to the side of his face. The touch so gentle.
“He spilled so many fantasies of his, and who he’d like to do those fantasies to. I remember that we had to literally walk out for a bit because the amount of horny coming from Harry was almost intoxicating. Enough to make us all pass out.” Hermione chuckled before stopping abruptly as she noticed Harry’s face, he looked sickly. It made her sober up so that she could look after her best friend.
Even though Harry was now awake and very aware of his actions, he couldn’t stop his gaze from wandering to the blonde haired Slytherin sitting at the table across from him. He may not have been stuck in his mind anymore but his thoughts about the prat were still just as filthy, he just had to look at him for a moment.
“Our rivalry is stupid.” Harry spoke first, his eyes meeting Draco’s grey ones. He’d always found them beautiful, he tried to shake the thoughts and focus. Preparing himself to get majorly rejected.
Draco whimpered loudly, his knees buckling once again. So hard, this time, that he lost balance. He fell to his knees, his breathing incredibly uneven as he made the brave decision to look up - being met by a smirk so sadistic and teasing that it had his body tingling as an arousing warmth spread throughout him.
“I don’t think so.” Blaise grimaced, remembering that he had seen Neville after they had spoken about the situation on their way to the Great Hall. Who knew he had such great hearing. They all continued to listen with bated breath and Draco couldn’t help but shiver - not only from the fact that they were going to get found out but at Harry’s voice as well.
Harry started a brutal pace, adding another slick finger without Draco even noticing. That was until Harry chose to leave his prostate alone to massage his inner walls with all three fingers, the noise the boy let out was indescribable - it made Harry’s cock pulse with a need to be inside him.
thank you so much reading! i hope that you enjoyed it and the upcoming chapter will be posted soon :)
“Now that we agree on that, we should stop beating around the bush.” Harry could tell Draco was about to speak so interrupted, looking down to the ground.
Draco knew that the next day he would probably find bruises of Harry’s fingertips from how harshly he was holding him. He also couldn’t help but let his mind wander that bruises of the other’s fingertips would be left after being fucked by him, the thought made his body quiver.
Harry was quite surprised at how collected and controlled his voice sounded when he was literally having to squeeze his thighs together, tightly, as he tried to will away the intruding thoughts in his head and the even bigger intrusive problem growing in his pants.
And as soon as it started, it was over. Potter was back to jolting his prostate with every thrust of his unrelenting fingers.
Harry crowded him up against the door, easily towering over him as an eerie chuckle left his smirking mouth.
Potter had leaned into to his neck, nosing at the skin for a moment. His tongue met Draco’s pulse as he let his teeth graze over, the way the other shivered beneath him had his own cock twitching.
“So, what are you gonna do?” Neville’s voice was curious, looking at the other as his eyes grew wide at the darkened gaze Harry shot back. His eyes widened even more as, once again, Harry chuckled deeply. It sent a chill down Draco’s spine, he and his friends almost in a trance with the way he was acting.
He absolutely revelled in the way Draco’s head was bowed to him, he knew that it wasn’t intentional. The other was just too scared to look up and meet his own pitch black gaze, full of lust. He needed to see those beautiful, pale blueish, grey eyes. Encased in fear and his own need and want, clear by the boner in his pants.
It fortunately was, Potter flicked his eyebrows and nodded - smiling as Draco smiled back. This whole situation was definitely not how he’d imagined telling the other of his feelings but it was better than anything he could’ve ever hoped for.
“Fucking hell.” Draco couldn’t help but think out loud, not even caring what his friends thought as he realised why Harry’s harsh smirk had grown wider.
“Dear merlin, look at him.” Pansy’s eyes were wide as she spoke, seeing Potter look - not vulnerable - but so on edge. She couldn’t find the words to describe it, so transfixed on how sweat was now pouring off the other.
In a matter of seconds, he had set a punishing pace - all because Draco had complained. Harry was the devil, a particularly lustful devil that the blonde didn’t mind at all.
“Harry, oh fuck, is it..?” Ron’s voice shook with nerves as he looked up at his friend, pure and crippling anxiety clouding his senses.
Ron gave her an exasperated look, he had only just started studying for the test tomorrow! Let alone the test for next week.
He shouldn’t have even bothered worrying, all she said was that he looked ‘fucking fabulous’ that he should ‘wear more clothes like that’ and to close it off, that he should ‘show his skin more’. His mother being so supportive of him and his sexuality, which she had admitted to him that she had known for a while but she just wanted to wait until he felt comfortable enough to tell her, was an incredible feeling. He’d cried tears of content and joy many times, he was so thankful for Narcissa.
He was so wrapped up in staring at Potter’s fucking cock, he didn’t sense the heat of his person coming closer to him. He jumped out of his skin as the other’s hot mouth was at his ear, angling his body away from the many gazes and licking the shell of it slightly. Draco felt like he was going to explode.
He had once again, began to choke on it. It didn’t take him long to adjust to the cock that was practically fucking down into his oesophagus, it may sound dramatic but it's definitely how it felt.
Draco smushed his hands together, fiddling intensely to stop himself from screaming. Of course Harry would make him speak, and of course he would obey.
“I-I had a c-cold shower, I didn-“ Potter’s grin and expression made him shut his mouth, his bottom lip shaking slightly.
“As harsh as it sounds, I’m just glad he’s dead. Mother seems so much happier and I can finally be who I want to be.” Harry smiled back, not faulting him for being happier now that Lucius was gone.
He took one last step and ever so slowly dragged his eyes from the floor and looked up Draco’s body, repeating how the other had looked at him in their third year. Except this time, the roles were reserved. They were both also incredibly turned on and Harry was forcefully taking his assertive place. Draco felt his head spin from the look.
“You are for my eyes only now. And you know that, don’t you. That’s why you wore your cloak, because my and only my eyes are going to be seeing your gorgeous skin from now on. So good for me already; you aren’t off the hook though, baby.”
The demanding tone had Draco squeezing his thighs together, attempting to stop the hard on in his jeans from hardening anymore. Of course, Harry felt it too. Feeling from where his hands still lay, gripping his arse. Draco’s cheeks heated up in an instant.
The Slytherin’s all raised their eyebrows at hearing the girl they once thought to be so prim and proper, a goody two shoes, using such vulgar language. Just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover.
“Well boys, late for the third time this week. 10 points from Gryffindor.” That’s when they had eyes on them, the Gryffindor’s groaning and scowling at the two whilst the Slytherin’s chuckled at their misfortune.
Draco’s mind was an absolute mess, full of horny thoughts that made his body heat up just a little more every time. His thoughts drifting back to how he was in the v of the other’s spread legs, that were purposely spread around him. The man was acting like a damn alpha, he was the alpha.
“Now.” His voice sounded almost animalistic, a deep growl vibrating throughout his chest, through the table and eventually - through Draco’s own body.
“Okay.” With a nod from Snape as his response, he watched him turn dramatically and make his way back down the hallway. He waited until he was far enough gone as he bolted inside and made a beeline for his room, he had 2 hours.
Draco couldn’t believe himself, he never thought he’d be sitting here getting turned on by the person who was - just this morning - his enemy. He shook his head as if trying to shake the thoughts away, it didn’t work. He still couldn’t get Potter out of his head.
They ran back to the classroom, stopping as they came to the door. Harry peaked through the window before slamming himself back against the wall.
He choked slightly, tears welling up in his eyes a little. Harry muttered words of encouragement, stroking his sweaty forehead gently as Draco took in a deep breath - the best he could - through his nose as he finally calmed himself. He would just have to deal with it if he wanted Potter down his throat.
Harry’s words were making Draco’s body ache with need, a whimper slipping from his lips as he had lost his self control.
He had his shoes on in no time, said shoes were another muggle brand called Doc Martens. They were a gift from his mother and he absolutely loved them, whenever he wasn’t wearing school shoes, he was in them. As with mostly all of his clothes, they were black. However, they were encased in black sparkles that shone so prettily - that’s what Draco thought anyway.
A slick finger slid into Draco’s warm heat, barely giving him any time to adjust. The moan that was pulled from the boy told Harry everything he needed to know, he was loving it.
Hermione grinned like a cheshire cat at the crimson red of her boyfriend’s cheeks, he really couldn’t hide his embarrassment well. Ron swiftly snapped out of it and snorted at her words.
“Yep, Harry thinks he’s been slipped one.” Ron chewed on his nail as he spoke, stopping swiftly from the look he received from Hermione - practically hearing her voice telling him to stop the habit.
Hermione’s hand shot up, temporarily distracting everybody for a moment. Snape nodded towards her, a way of silently saying ‘yes’. Nobody would’ve thought Snape’s behaviour would change in this way, now they were sixth years - he showed more affection. Kinda. Very rarely, the class still appreciated it.
“Yes you fucking would, you’re so very transparent. I can see through your charade so easily so don’t even try to argue with me. The way you looked earlier tells me different than what you’re saying, kitten.”
Draco had given up on both trying to rebel against Potter’s demands and attempting to stop the noises now falling from his mouth with ease.
He didn’t even get to finish his pathetic excuse of a reply as Potter interrupted sharply, the words coming from his mouth sending his mind into a swarm of lust.
‘After a good punishment’, his heart stuttered harshly in his chest at how much his cock throbbed at that.
“Blimey.” Both Fred and George whispered, being the first ones to come to their senses. The two were shameless in the way the way that they stared, along with the thoughts that came to mind.
Draco managed to snap himself out of his thoughts as he looked up at the clock, 9:45pm. How had it been 15 minutes already?!
The table behind them, unbeknownst to the Gryffindor’s, strained their ears as they tried to listen intently.
He had his friends to thank, especially Pansy. No matter what, even if they were arguing, she always makes sure that Draco knows he’s important and constantly telling him he looks beautiful or gorgeous. It really meant a lot to him.
“It also takes a toll on how your body acts with time. In these visuals it feels like you’re there for hours, when really it’ll only have been a couple minutes. We figured this out from last time.”
“I just wanna say sorry for it, what I did and said. To your friends too, they didn’t deserve it.” He looked down to the floor, a guilty expression once again on his face. Harry decided he hated the look.
Harry stood up from the chair, helping Draco to stand to make sure he could. He could tell that the other was feeling better, his knees were no longer buckling under his weight and his face had gotten some colour back. Harry had squeezed Draco’s hand one last time, pushing his other hand against the blonde’s that was still on his chest before letting him go.
His eye contact with the door was now disturbed after hearing a broken whimper sound from just about in front of him, his curious eyes landed on something so delicious that it made his hands twitch at his sides in trepidation - already wanting to spoil how innocent he looked.
He felt the raven haired man grin against his skin, he shook from the simple action. When he felt the heat from the other fade away, he almost allowed himself to show his disappointment before remembering where they were.
Gradually, Harry started gaining speed with his thrusts. Hitting the back of his throat and making him choke before allowing himself to slide down Draco’s welcoming throat, constricting every so often around him.
That was until he heard someone clear their throat from behind him, he whipped around to meet a smirking Harry Potter. Oh merlin, he’d been thinking about what was going to happen for the past 2 hours and now that he was here, all he could do was stare at the other.
He felt slightly unnerved at how all his friends were now just smirking at him, like they knew what was going on. Pansy winked at him before making a shooing motion with her hands.
“Please refrain from talking outside the door though, you know how thin these walls are.” Harry visibly cringed.
Harry was silent, trying his best to ignore the sweat now pouring off him. His entire body heating up, stuck in a metal furnace of raging flames.
“I promise, I wouldn’t lie to you about that. That bubble body wash you use that somehow smells like bubbles, I can explain all sorts of spells but I cannot even start on that. How bubbles have a smell.” Hermione giggled, going on a small tangent.
The rest of the class had already said what they had smelled, there were now many more blushing faces now. Some realising that maybe Draco and Harry weren’t the only ones to figure out their crushes.
As much as Harry wanted to drag it out for longer, he was way too eager to punish the other. The pleasure had been immeasurable but now he got to have some more fun.
The class was silent, Snape had tried to go back to talking but the rest of the room were just too damn nosy. He had told the ones who hadn’t completed the potion evaluation work to do so now, he had tried to busy himself with some paperwork as this was done but the rest who had finished listened closely. Ron turned around.
Potter’s hand moved to push against his cock, he didn’t let any pleasure show on his face though. Just that same teasing expression, he knew what he was doing.
Potter repeated this many more times, successfully covering Draco’s neck in nasty/cruel looking bruises. All the while, the Slytherin had been moaning - what he had thought to be - quietly. The blonde not only welcomed, but craved the pain.
here we fucking go, i don't apologise for this sin and it's only gonna get worse lmao. also i'd like to remind you that i wrote this purely to work on my descriptive writing so if it's almost 'too detailed' i know and if it's cringe oh well lol. anyway, hope you like it!
“Isn’t this a very personal conversation for everybody to hear?” An uncomfortable look on his face, feeling bad. When Pansy stood up, he honestly thought he was gonna get decked. That was until she waltzed over and sat on his table.
He noted the way that he was shaking, hands so tense in his lap, the sweat beginning to pour off him, the way his was gnawing on his lip and most interestingly to Harry - the one that really made his cock throb harshly - the bulge restricting against the fabric of his school trousers.
His friends, although still feeling bad from the whole situation and the permanent scar it had left, snorted.
Draco felt like he was going to fucking explode. The absolute vulgarity pouring from Potter’s mouth, mixed with the pet-names, was a perfect cocktail that’s only purpose is arousal.
Draco had tried to put on his most bored and uninterested tone when really, his heart was stammering so hard inside his chest that he thought it would fly out. He also knew that his attempt at making himself sound unaffected and confident was for nothing, the way he had stuttered and how his voice had shook was oh so telling.
It was as if they were pulling him in, making him crave the thought of being caught like the prey he was and snatched up for Harry’s taking; luring him with those tempting eyes.
“I-I ripped them, b-by accident.” Harry’s chuckle got more darker and sinister sounding in a way that drove Draco crazy, the bare flesh of his ass being squeezed, almost painfully, again.
He watched as Draco’s eyes widened, blown out from pure lust. The boy was practically vibrating from eagerness, Harry thrived off it.
Draco and his friends stopped dead in their tracks, all looking shaky as they shared a glance that was full of fear. Oh no.
The group all allowed their eyes to shift onto the table behind them, Fred and George couldn’t help but snicker.
They all shared a look of shock, this was not the intended purpose. The look of ‘oh shit’ was present on all of their faces.
Draco did the best he could at saying ‘mhm’ around him, it sounded more like a needy moan but Harry understood it. A rough groan leaving his mouth as he placed one hand at the back of Draco’s head, whilst one remained wrapped in his hair.
“Anyway. So, what visuals?” Fred and George asked, a cheeky tone lacing both of their words as grins spread across their faces.
The Slytherin’s were in shock, they couldn’t quite believe what they had just heard. The vulgar and filthy words that had poured from Harry’s mouth so easily like honey mixed in with liquid gold. To Draco, the words sounded like they fit perfectly coming from the other boy’s mouth - like they belonged there.
Draco’s mind was swarmed full of need, pleasure and an undeniable craving for Potter, he then absorbed the words that had caused goosebumps to rise all across his body.
“I-I’m not pretty.” He really had nothing else to say, he could not get anything other than a retort out of his mouth. He also knew that he sounded like a child with the way he was attempting to argue back in order to stop getting hard, this made Potter chuckle once again.
The room wasn’t that big, the largest thing inside of it was probably the double bed. The room was much smaller than the dorm room Harry and Ron slept in, it was a little smaller then what would be considered a ‘medium sized’ room. Draco still thought it looked nice, it looked strangely cozy.
Harry didn’t speak for a couple seconds, succeeding in the painstaking anticipation that made Draco’s hands shake from where they hung by his sides.
“No, it’s just that you’re my best friend.” Ron scratched his head as he looked awkwardly over his shoulder, trying to rid himself of the attention.
“I think your skin would look divine in lace, pretty baby. I’ll just have to put you in some next time.”
The only exception was Potter. It wasn’t something that was forced, Draco had a choice. He was never given the opportunity to even have a choice before, when his fa-Lucius, was around.
Lucius hadn’t even been brought out in front of him yet and he was experiencing this, his mother had noticed the state he was in and rushed over. She had whispered soft, comforting words into his ear but it did nothing to help. He was still extremely grateful that she had at least tried to help, god knows his father wouldn’t have.
Draco was frozen to the spot, more turned on than he had been all night. His body didn’t know how to process all that he was feeling, how was he going to deal with having the man touch him if just seeing his cock had him in a motionless trance.
He sucked on Draco’s tongue for a few seconds, quickly moving to focus on his lips. Harry was nipping and biting, making the other’s already swollen lips; swell even more.
But this was different, this was almost pitch black staring right into his soul. Potter was gazing at him hungrily, Draco felt as if he were prey in that moment - and Potter was the predator. Potter looked like he was fucking hunting his prey, Draco. And he fucking revelled in it. He also questioned what part of his brain had come up with such metaphors, surely he was losing it.
“Don’t even say that to me. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to sit here and do nothing, when all I wanna do is go and fuck the ever-loving crap out of him.”
His hands shook from where they sat in his lap, unable to stop his nerves from showing. Gradually, he forced his eyes up the other’s body until they reached his face.
The blonde boy was squirming on the small desk, unable to do anything more. He knew he wasn’t allowed to touch himself, he was just doing his best to obey the rules.
Draco inhaled deeply as a way of trying to calm his body before he exploded, it didn’t help when the almost overbearing but certainly intoxicating scent of roses filled his senses as Potter once again, leaned close to his ear.
For a few moments after, Harry had no idea he had even spoke. If it wasn’t for the look of pure shock on all of his friend’s faces, he wouldn’t have had a clue! Lust potions were fucking dangerous. Fred and George were the first to speak.
hey! don't worry, next chapter it'll be all Harry and Draco. i'm just glad that i'm finally getting them posted lol. i also hope i'm not ruining it by posting the 3 chapters one after another, i didn't want to save them as drafts because i'm paranoid and feel like it'll end up getting deleted and i'm so lazy and cba to fill out all the information again (i'm feeling motivated today lmao) but i promise, the rest of the chapters will be posted less spam like :) (another thing, if you have another idea for the title of this chapter then please let me know; i'm kinda high and my brain will just not come up with a better title lmao)
Their eyes locked once more, Draco’s cheeks burning as if they were quite literally on fire. The blonde could not believe that the same person he once thought his rival, was the only one ever that could bring him to such a state in such a small amount of time.
Harry’s friends had never seen him act so confident before, seeming so naturally dominant. Maybe it was because they had never seen him with an actual love interest before, nevertheless, they couldn’t take their eyes away.
Harry’s hands were balled up by his sides, his eyes shutting in an attempt to prone in his arousal. Everybody knew that he wasn’t really angry with them, they understood and it made Harry feel slightly better. He really loved is friends, his nice moment was soon broken; by none other than his own previous words.
Harry groaned in realisation that he’d just said those words out loud as he let his head fall forward, for the umpteenth time today, and banging it onto the table.
Draco felt like he was under terrible scrutiny but the hot bubbling flames that were filling Draco’s senses with arousal screamed that he wasn’t opposed to it.
“-tease!” And George finished the yelling. The other’s could not even try to be annoyed at them for that as they all cackled, all except for Harry who was in a predicament right now.
He could also make out a thrilling feeling, from the pure adrenaline that they could get caught any time - all they had to do was use ‘alohomora’ on the door.
Malfoy’s arms were wrapped loosely around the other’s neck, his entire body full of warmth. Still in a little shock that he was kissing Harry Potter, the one he used to hate, used to be his enemy, now their lips were moving together in sync. So close that they couldn’t possibly be any closer.
God, how he craved to bite down on his skin. Cover that pretty neck of his in hickies to show that he belonged to Harry. To choke him afterwards and push down on the, most likely, aching bruises just because he could. And the other boy would fucking sob from the euphoric sense of pain mixing ever so beautifully with the pleasure.
His eyes were then off of him, Draco didn’t know whether he was relieved or disappointed. Hermione had nudged Potter’s shoulder and spoke some words to him, he hadn’t caught what was said. He watched as the other’s gaze looked towards his best friend and then to his other friends, Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest.
Draco moved his hands around his neck, tenderly poking at first before adding more pressure - thriving off of how the slight pain only mixed with the pleasure. He didn’t understand how he was even feeling pleasure, he wasn’t being touched.
His thoughts were then cut off as Harry smirked viciously at him, Draco had an idea that the words about to come from the other’s mouth were going to make him tremble.
“The girlfriends, Harry. All they wanted to do was makeout and you always had an excuse. I can’t believe to avoid bedding that girl you said your scar hurt and that Voldemort was coming, that was awful!” Her words were strong, yet she couldn’t keep the smile from her face.
His mother had really helped as well, after Lucius was sent to Azkaban - he really saw a change in her. She looked free and happy, glad that she and her son could just be together without any fear. He had visited her along with Pansy once wearing those jeans, he was a little scared at first how his mother would react to his skin literally hanging out.
“I just wanted to know for sure that I liked kissing guys, if that meant kissing Harry then that’s just what I had to do.” Ron pouted at the expression on the twins’ face, so obviously teasing. Well, what brothers would they be if they didn’t tease the second youngest sibling.
He did enjoy hearing them say how the blonde boy probably had the exact same thoughts, it was extremely satisfying to think about. But fuck reality, he was just gonna enjoy these images of Draco while he could.
“Basically, one of the effects of the lust potion is a very clear, vivid imagination. The potion makes you horny, which gives you horny thoughts. Those thoughts are then played out in your mind, as if you’re experiencing them for real. The potion cannot create visuals that you’ve not already had, so horny thoughts about the person already have to be there.”
“Oh fucking god, what if they heard every single word! You just had to bring up the shit to do with sex and Draco!” Harry panicked, the other tried her best not to laugh.
Draco barely remembered to grab his books as he snatched them from off the table clumsily and slid out of his seat, instinctually covering the hard on in his trousers. It must’ve looked so incredibly obvious but he had no other option at this point, he waved at his friends as he began walking - successfully escaping their questions…for now.
More embarrassment flooded through his senses, he could not believe that his old rival was the one breaking him down like this.
Oh, what could she do. Asleep or awake, she couldn’t do anything either way. Draco had gotten pretty distracted from looking at the other paintings, zoning out and staring at nothing as his feet shuffled to the top of the staircase - his gaze set in stone.
Only to find that they had followed his gaze, his cheeks couldn’t gain any more pigment. Now shaking under the burning eyes of Potter, all he could do was sputter.
After finding some black socks and putting them on, he sat on his bed and debated whether or not to wear underwear with the jeans. He didn’t wear them often and the times he had, he had gone commando and had once borrowed some of Pansy’s underwear.
He had absolutely no idea how much of that they had heard, or if they had heard his mortifying noises. Potter seemed to love them. Part of his hair was now wet from sweat, stuck to his forehead as he begged his brain to stop sending him such thoughts.
Draco’s mind was swarmed with thoughts, he couldn’t stop asking himself what punishment he’d be getting. He had a feeling that it wouldn’t be a punishment like detention, the thought scared him and intrigued him.
They finally arrived at what Draco recognised to be the mirror, he cast a quizzical gaze to his friend.
Hermione’s words faded into nothing as Harry felt the potion hit hard again, feeling momentarily lightheaded as the feeling of pleasure rushed its way back into his body. He still had a boner, it had gone down slightly in the midst of talking to his friends. Still, he was half hard - which wasn’t an ideal situation.
Harry had to admit that the power made him drunk, higher than any drug could ever get him. He’d choose Draco over everything.
Instantly, the kiss was one of passion and heat. At one point their teeth had clashed together slightly from how Harry had grinned evilly as he continued kissing him.
“I like you too. I’ve liked you for a long time, it’s weird to know you like me too. For a while, I know this is no excuse, I was terrified of my father.”
He was taunting him, he could barely focus on it though - just from the way that Potter said his name. It seemed he got distracted over anything when in the other’s presence, his brain had stopped functioning a while back.
He tried to forget that this was all just fantasy, it would only make his cock ache harder at the thought that this wouldn’t happen in real life. He’d never get to grab those pale, milky thighs so hard that he’d leave bruises of his own fingertips. Marking him up in more ways then one.
He quickly added the second finger, scissoring them inside the blonde boy and causing such pretty moans to stumble from his open mouth.
“Did you not pick up on him saying he wanted to fuck ‘a guy’ over the desk earlier as well, pay attention, C.” Pansy giggled playfully, nudging his shoulder softly to make sure he heard. He had in fact heard and chuckled back.
It must’ve been minutes that they were staring into each other’s eyes, Harry’s eyes were temping his constantly and he let himself by lured in. He was literally prey and Potter the predator and he fucking loved it.
“No! I’m just really fucking horny, god fucking damnit!” His voice was dark and raucous, the tone made Draco jump as he felt his heartbeat decrease slightly now that he knew Voldemort wouldn’t be paying a visit - his heart still hammered though, purely from Harry’s voice.
He could feel his friends’ and Potter’s friends’ gazes all over him, watching the situation unfold right in front of them. He had an urge to run, but he knew Potter would catch him. The thought made his body wrack with shivers, making his body shake and cower even more as he expertly avoided both the intimidating mans cock and his demanding eyes.
From the way Harry gestured to the dorms outside, Draco had turned around to see himself standing in front of a door.
They both snorted, completely unaware that Draco was listening to every word. The blonde’s blush only deepened and he questioned how much more red his cheeks could get, he knew that Harry could probably make the worse.
Draco’s mouth was wide open, without his consent of course. His mind had gone blank, holy fucking hell.
An hour left to shower, that’d be easy. He stripped his clothes and tossed them on his bed, looking down between his legs to see that his prick was still half hard. Reliving the memory of Lucius’s trial had worked wonders, the panic attack mixed with the wholesomeness of his experience with Harry and his mother being a big help.
Obviously, he would still probably get irrevocably embarrassed in the next 5 minutes but it wouldn’t be the bad kind. It would be the kind that he secretly got off on, well not so secretly since Harry quite clearly knew.
Harry revelled in the fear that combined with excitement that he saw in Draco’s eyes, he had definitely found a keeper.
Potter tightened his grip on the bare skin of Draco’s cheeks, revelling when he felt the other’s knees buckle again.
Draco’s jaw ached from having to be open so wide for so long, his lips burning from the pure stretch that Harry caused. The girth and length of the mans cock was gonna be the death of him, but Draco fucking loved it.
He made his way to his broad shoulders, still hesitating to make the final leap to eye contact. He knew it was because the probable dark gaze that would shoot straight back into his own, assessing his damn soul, he’d lose the control he’d shakily attempted to build.
“Hey. Let’s not lie here, most of us in this room are probably curious - sexuality wise - so we all understand. Right? Even if you’re straight, you don’t say anything rude about it or I’ll beat you to a pulp.” Pansy smiled brightly, contrasting highly to her previous threatening words.
The first thing he had done once he arrived at his room was yank his school trousers off, he hadn’t bothered putting anything else on yet. That added to the temptation, only a thin layer of fabric between his hand and his almost leaking cock.
His left hand was then being moved by Potter’s, placed on his cock. Shivers broke out all through Draco’s body, he could barely fit his hand around him. He got over the initial shock and began moving his hand, timidly stroking up and down.
His hand was then being taken off the other’s forearm, Harry moved his hand to press against his chest. He held his larger hand over Draco’s from where it rested on his chest.
“What?!” Her shock eased a little as the familiar scent of rose slowly trailed its way into her nose, the scent oozing off of Harry.
“You wanna know about the one where I imagined fucking a guy over the desk and leaving the door unlocked so that anybody could walk in and see what a slut he was for me?”
Nobody had spoken, Harry was honestly just shocked at how he’d managed to make Snape speechless. No longer looking angry, but smug. A slight grin starting to appear on his face. The look on Ron’s face, however, was a lot different. One of pure shock.
“Fuck, Draco.” Her mouth was slightly agape, not that the other could see as he had his back turned to her - ready to be encased in embarrassment before Pansy spoke.
“When can I go check on Harry, sir?” Snape thought for a moment, a thought fleeting across his head as he almost chuckled.
Hermione’s words were soft and comforting, very different from all that Harry was feeling. But he appreciated it nonetheless, he shot back a soft smile. That was until Ron decided to pipe up.
The entrancing musky smell of Harry intoxicating his senses as his eyes fluttered shut, he could feel the heat from the other colliding with his own.
“On the bed, right now.” Potter’s voice was low and sadistic sounding, fuck if Draco was going to disobey.
Harry groaned contently at how the cool temperature of the twins’ hands contrasted to the scolding heat that his forehead was emitting as he leaned into the touch, both Fred and George were surprised at how hot he really was.
“I did not just fucking say that!” The words were muffled under his hand but still audible, Hermione looked sympathetic but with an underlying gleam of amusement flashing in her eyes.
For a couple minutes, they spoke about some other things. The conversation, ever so slowly, getting more and more suggestive. It was Harry’s fault, Draco at first just thought he was interpreting his words wrong - he soon realised he wasn’t. Potter was just really good at being subtle about things that are really not subtle.
“Right. I thought you were good at potions, how did you manage to turn a love potion into one of lust.”
Pansy looked at the three, once again smiling towards them. It was a different feeling. Instead of dread that another argument was brewing, it now felt much more calm and relaxed.
“He also smells treacle tart and the wood smell from a broomstick handle.” Harry’s cheeks darkened once more, he did smell like that. Hermione chuckled softly, pushing his unruly hair from his eyes.
He was shocked by the way he enjoyed feeling the lace on his skin, he never thought he’d say it out loud though. Of course, Pansy saw the look on his face and had asked questions. Draco could not lie to her, she was his best friend and could tell instantly.
This was incredibly cliche but Draco couldn’t wipe the smile off his face as Harry stepped even closer, his hand snaking up to the back of his blonde hair.
The blonde couldn’t hold off any longer as he shuffled even closer on his knees, his hot breath hitting against the monster of a cock in front of him. He grabbed the base tightly as he stuck his tongue out, licking around the tip. His heart hammered so hard against his chest that he was sure Harry could feel it too, he needed to get a hold on his breathing before he passed out.
It really felt as if he was talking, he knew for a fact he wasn’t. The risk that he was actually speaking out loud apparently wasn’t a big enough problem for him to care about, he just loved the visuals he was seeing and let himself get lost in them.
Crabbe didn’t realise it at the time but instead of adding one drop of an ingredient, he added four. Four drops.
Harry felt himself starting to sweat as he made his way to where his friends were sat, slamming his books down on the table - more harshly than he intended too. He felt slight guilt pang in his stomach at how his friends had jumped, it faded when he saw them quickly look down and get back to whatever they were doing.
“Fucksake, he’s there again. Harry!” Hermione slapped her friends shoulder, groaning in annoyance when he remained unfazed.
This only added to Draco’s blush, however, his body quickly contradicted his momentary embarrassment as he opened his legs more on instinct - clearly more than eager to have fingers inside of him and stretching him open.
Hermione couldn’t hold back her giggle at the way the twins’ eyes shimmered in mischievous curiosity.
“Throughout the day, Ronald and I were subjected to listen to all of his fantasies. It made the day a lot more interesting, I’ll give him that.” Hermione almost started laughing aloud as she noticed the pure intrigue coming from the twins, they hadn’t been that quiet since they were sleeping babies.
He must’ve gotten lost in thought, realising that the entire time he’d been staring directly at Potter’s dick. His heart skipped a beat, knowing for a fact that he was definitely being observed.
Fucking their friend with his eyes, the damn expressions on his face and not to mention that undeniable bulge that pushed obscenely against his pants. It was as if they had been watching a show of aggressive flirting and teasing, they had to admit that it was kinda hot.
He was ripped out of his thoughts from Harry laughing softly, sounding much different then when he regarded the blonde.
Draco squinted his eyes as he tried to make himself look to opposite of what Potter was saying he was, he was only proving the other’s point though. And deep inside, the blonde knew it. Maybe he was purposely doing it just to get a kick out of Potter, it was a dangerous game he was playing but oh so thrilling.
Draco let out a pathetic whimper as his lips closed around him, looking up and locking eyes with Potter whose own eyes were fully blown out - an enticing black void replacing the usual colours.
What about it in his ass, fuck, he’d wreck him. The way his cock twitched in his pants at the thought made him want it more, he wanted Potter to shove his cock deep inside of him and fuck him until he was screaming. Merlin, he wouldn’t be able to sit down for weeks either. Again, the thought made his body pulse in pleasure. Biting down with force on his lip, starting to break the skin, as he tried to hold back all the noises that wanted to come out.
Pansy brainstormed aloud as Blaise ahh’d from where he sat, that did make sense. Draco didn’t trust his voice to speak, so he just hmm’d in acknowledgement to his friends explanation.
His grin turned into a smirk and with the same hand that he had just practically groped himself with - his left hand - he flashed the back of it towards his friends so they could read the silvery scar that the stupid, intolerable pink cunt had left. Everybody in Hogwarts would definitely agree with that description.
“I’m not supposed to say this but I would like to thank you for what you said today. I’m legally not allowed to endorse shoving a fist down somebody’s throat, however, you made those with “not socially normal” sexualities feel comfortable. That’s admirable. I wish that growing up we would have had someone like you around.”
He cringed at how badly he had stuttered, how he had just proven to Harry how much of a mess he could make him.
Draco’s eyes shot up to Harry’s, mortified. His face burning like he’d fell head first into lava, he could feel his heartbeat pumping violently in his ears. He snapped his mouth shut, he had no idea that it was still open. The taunting was something embarrassed him yet made his prick throb in his jeans.
Draco took a wild guess that he was stuff he had to do, the realisation had him squeezing his thighs together in an attempt to will away the venereous thoughts filling his brain, spiking waves of pleasure glided through his body and to his groin.
