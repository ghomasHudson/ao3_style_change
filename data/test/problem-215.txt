Watching the pocketknife carefully, it headed towards the gravel driveway only to bounce off an invisible barrier. A dark smirk overtook Harry’s features as he snatched the pocketknife out of the air and cancelled the tracking charm. He took two steps towards the boundary, careful to not get close enough to the point of tripping alarms. He held his hands up while closing his eyes. He studied all of the charms and spells placed over the house in hopes of easily being able to break them.
“We win!” screeched Dudley as he blindly threw a couple of punches into the dog pile before sloppily standing up. “We won Harry Hunting!”
The young man quickly placed his knife back into its sheath before slowly dropping Kevin, face first, to the ground. The young man sighed before stepping away from the corpse. Another night, another death, another job done. The young man apparated from the spot, to arrive on the top of the roof. Crouching down to be hidden from view, the young man held his hands up towards the yard and corpse below him. He concentrated on summoning his magic up. After a second of silence, the young man cleaned any of his DNA from Kevin, as well as the surrounding area, so there was to be no trace of him every being there. The young man removed all footprints of his from the grass so they could not track a shoes size and make. The young man finally removed his magical residual from the immediate area. He didn't want anything left behind that could possibly lead anyone to him, not even the best trackers or hunters would be able to find him.
The only two occupants in the Headmaster’s office at Hogwarts stood in a tense silence. Kingsley Shacklebolt would have flinched at the immense power emitting from the other if he was not already used to the common power show-offs at the Ministry of Magic. It was unfortunate that he could not just deliver the news and take his immediate leave. He knew that once Albus Dumbledore heard the rumours he came to deliver, than an order meeting would be called.
“None of this information leaves this room. And you three,” Dumbledore was addressing the Aurors, “keep all of this under the table until we decide how to move forwards during another meeting,” his icy blue eyes scanned the room dangerously.
Smiling, Harry shook his head at how easily distracted he had just became over a silly old scar. He held out his hand and a second later a pair of clean jocks flew into the bathroom. After he put them on, he grabbed his wand and knife plus their holsters before he walked out into his bedroom and discarded the items on his bed. He turned around with a heavy sigh and headed to his wardrobe. Shuffling through the many dark coloured tops hanging next to his leather coats, he selected a long sleeved, black shirt. Sending it floating over to his bed with a mere wave of his hand, he turned his attention to the bottom drawer in his wardrobe. He opened the drawer to reveal an array of neatly folded pants, shorts, socks and underwear. Wasting no time, he grabbed out his most comfortable tracksuit pants he had and sent them over to his bed.
A set of chuckles followed closely by a slapping sound was heard in the living room. Internally, he allowed himself to find the amusement as he was sure that the twins had been the ones to react in such a way. He had read about all of the trouble they had caused throughout their years at Hogwarts. Out of the entire family, he was interested in meeting those two the most. He just had a gut feeling that they would be the only ones he would be able to tolerate out of the entire Weasley family.
“I have to,” his voice broke as he tried to speak. “I have to be there and I have to care. Who else is there to do that? I am the closest thing to family he has right now. His parents are gone. His Godfather is supposedly rotting in Azkaban for a crime he didn’t do. I am the last thing he has to a connection with his parents. I’m doing this as much for James and Lily as I am for Sirius and also myself.”
Harry stood up from where he knelt, slightly stretching his aching muscles. He looked down from where he stood and admired the work he had done thus far. There was not much more work he needed to do before he could clean up and leave. Majority of his plan had gone accordingly, very satisfied with the results, but he was still looking forward to the next part the most. What's one thing a male predator wants/needs to abuse others? A full functioning penis. Frankly Harry thought this man didn't deserve to have one. He was going to correct that, and painfully so, unfortunately for Steven and fortunately for the rest of mankind.
The plan was to follow whoever returned back to Hogwarts, until he could safely break away and quickly make his way into the Headmaster’s office for his big reveal. As Harry settled in behind the bush, he mused about how he hadn’t developed a plan for after the big reveal. Unlike his usual meticulous self, he left the rest of the night to his spontaneous side. He double checked the Disillusionment charm was still active, hiding him from view, as he then begun to rummage around in his mokeskin pouch. Summoning some of his candy supply to munch on while he waited patiently, gazing around the quiet landscape lit by the soft moonlight.
"What do you mean?" all kindness void in his voice and eyes. "Have I took you back after your acts of betrayal? Have I not offered you a job in a world that would have shunned you? Have I not been anything but kind too you?"
“I’ll be taking my leave now,” Severus spoke in to the mostly silent room, soft voices floating down from upstairs.
Nearing the tree line, Harry almost didn’t want to land. It had been days since he felt this free and he wanted to spend his time doing whatever he wanted. Slowly, he came to a stop just inside the cover of the tree line. Hovering above the ground on his broomstick, he sat there for a minute breathing in the fresh air and observing the quiet surroundings. He finally touched down on the ground and stepped off his Nimbus 2000.
“I agree,” Harry nodded. “Shall we head back inside now? I’m quiet cold now the adrenaline has worn off.”
', using his shoe to close the door behind him. Not looking back, he continued walking away from the house, heading directly to the bench he had previously been sitting on. He sat down and in the quiet of the night, begun removing all traces that he had even been in or near that house. He removed his DNA that had been spread everywhere, off of items as well as Steven's body. He concentrated on erasing any footprints that may have been ingrained into the carpet or anywhere near the crime scene. Lastly, he recalled his magical residue. The process taking a little longer since he had performed more magic here.
The peaceful stars were sudden replaced by an image of Drew’s softly smiling features. Harry looked over to find an identical mirror begin held up to the others’ face. He looked back down at his own mirror and picked it up to be right in front of his own face. Smiling back at Drew, he waved and laughed softly when he saw both the mirror Drew and the one sitting beside him wave back.
Sighing softly, Drew’s eyes flickered over to the clock to find it was minutes away from midnight. He quickly sculled the rest of his alcoholic beverage before pulling out his wand and casted his patronus. The silvery figure of a unicorn seeped from his wand to fill the middle of the room, the majestic creature looking stunning in the gentle moonlight shine. Drew stood up and approached his country’s national animal, patting it affectionately on the head below the long, pointy horn.
Not only did Dumbledore have to think about training the small idiot, but he needed to take him immediately out to hunt for the hidden Horcruxes. Dumbledore wouldn’t be able to destroy Voldemort once and for all if Harry doesn’t properly destroy them all, which included the one hidden inside of the young man. He didn’t care if Harry died soon, but he did care if he was found. There was so much to do, so much to teach, so much to find, yet so little time. Dumbledore rolled his head to the side and looked out the window. He watched the stars twinkle as he wondered where the little mutt was right now.
Flinging the broom’s handle up without another thought, he ascended into the sky with great speed. He levelled out the handle and sat amongst the colourful clouds, overlooking the property below. His mind was stuck on the mission, it never straying too far from the thought, lingering in the back of his mind like an annoying insect bite. Harry thought about what he would be doing right now if this was just any other ordinary mission. Right now he would be scoping out the property, making sure he had committed all details to memory. Such as escape routes, places to hide, possible neighbours that could be troublesome, the routine of the victim or in this case, victims.
It was late at night when an alarm had been ringing loudly in his quarters, waking him abruptly from his peaceful sleep. Dumbledore tiredly got out of his bed and made his way to the bathroom. As he relived his bladder, his sleepy mind was thinking of the potential exciting situations he would find upon arriving to the muggle neighbourhood. Aching bones slowed him down as he changed from his colourful pyjamas to one of his colourful robes. His foggy mind clouded his judgement, making him walk down several flights of stairs before he realised he could simply apparate from inside the castle to Privet Drive.
“Last night, after investigating yet another incident at the Dursley residents, we found Harry Potter,” he continued finally after allowing the shock to subside slightly.
“Silence!” he yelled, holding up a hand. “I did not bring you here to waste my time. We must make a solid plan and act on it now!”
The sun was close to setting in the town of Little Wellington in Surrey. While most of the occupants of the small town had gone home and begun to unwind for the evening, in one particular house on Privet Drive, a family of three had just begun to start their rather loud and disruptive nightly routine. Unaware of their obnoxious actions, the obese father and son duo walked out of the house and to the shiny sports car in the driveway.
Shaking his head with a dark chuckle, Harry threw himself backwards. He placed his arms under his head as his eyes focused back on the stars. Drew made no sign to move, instead turning his head to stare ahead at the empty field.
“If any of this is true, the Ministry Of Magic is potentially going to face legal repercussion over this,” said Kingsley, getting nods of agreement from the other two Auror’s beside him. “This could also affect you too, Albus, for knowing such information and not reporting an injustice.”
Kevin drew another long draw from his cigarette. As he exhaled it slowly up towards the moon, the young man quickly stabbed into the right side of his throat where the right carotid artery lay beneath the skin and covered his mouth firmly. Blood splattered over the grass as gurgling sounds came from the distressed man. The young man held Kevin firmly in place as he quickly pushed the knife further into the neck, cutting the vocal cords. The young man brought the blood ridden knife out with a grunt before he plunged it into the left side to get to the left carotid artery. Satisfied that both major blood vessels and vocal cords had been severed, the young man pinched Kevin's nose with the hand covering his mouth and begun to count the seconds that passed that Kevin was not able to breathe. Slowly Kevin begun to stop struggling in the hold and slipped into unconsciousness.
The room erupted in a fit of rage. To think they had wasted the Order's time with this episode of domestic violence instead of resting or searching for the missing boy infuriated many of them. This was the exact scenario that they had feared would happen, especially when it was during the middle of the night. The anger at the way things were being handled, the way they were being instructed, didn't sit well with the group anymore. They wanted change and they wanted it now.
Shaking from fear, Harry Potter crawled on his hands and knees into the cramped space of the cupboard. He silently climbed on to the small square mattress and curled up on his side. Petunia merely scoffed at the actions before closing the cupboards door. Suddenly the hallway disappeared, nothing but blackness surrounded them. Shook shot through them as they clearly heard the soft muffled cries followed by a loud rumble from Harry’s ravenous stomach. Looking down, they saw only a slither of light seeping into a small, cramped room, softly illuminating a small figure on the ground. It didn’t take a genius to guess the three adults were standing in the memory of Harry being trapped inside the cupboard under the stairs.
“I will need a few Order members to head back to Diagon Alley and continue collecting the remaining school supplies for Harry,” Kingsley said loudly, gaining the attention from the large group.
Harry managed to pry Grayson off of him just long enough for him to kneel down in front off him. The other immediately attaching himself to him again, arms wrapped around his neck and shoulders. Harry continued rubbing his back softly, noticing the calming effect it had on the younger. He looked over the group and saw the many tears welled up in the eyes of these adults. Their hearts breaking at the sight before them. His eyes catching Drew’s brown ones, an intense sadness deep within, the only sign of emotion on the man’s face currently. Harry couldn’t maintain eye contact with his mentor, or he too might start crying. Closing his eyes, he hugged Grayson tightly as he rested his chin on the other’s shoulder.
Falling into a comfortable silence, the pair continued cooking the breakfast for the household. Harry allowed his mind to wander occasionally as he did everything on autopilot. All the cooking skills he had learnt at the Dursleys came through as he smoothly went from one task to another with ease, not needing Molly to instruct him on what to do next. A tapping brought the pair out of their zone, both turning to see an owl landing on the back of a kitchen chair.
Standing up, Harry walked over to the man and grabbed the small bag. Inside was a variety of sweets and candies that would last him for more than a few months. He looked up gratefully towards Remus, a genuine smile on his own face. The act was very generous, he didn’t believe there was any motive behind it other than a way of getting to know him before they start studying.
“No, not yet. I was hoping to give him a couple of days to adjust before I said anything,” he replied, looking between the two with a feigned sad smile.
“While we were finishing up our shopping, we heard whispers that included Harry’s name,” sighed Remus. “As we were about to leave, there was a commotion down the street. Turns out the people that had been in the store at the same time as Harry were shouting about what they had seen.”
"Obviously you haven't gotten to the juicy part, otherwise I would've been hearing more of a select type of vocabulary," he said around a mouthful of toast, a cheeky grin on his face. Harry gave him an annoyed look before continuing to read on.
“You know how Harry is going through a tough time and I wouldn’t explain why?” Malfoy questioned, removing his hand and straightening his back up, Snape nodded and gestured again for him to go on. “Well, I’m afraid he won’t be alive for much longer if he doesn’t get the help he needs.
“Sir,” Harry cautiously approached him as if not to spook the other with his presence. “You needed me?”
Harry didn’t want to linger on what could have been, so he turned his attention back to the present, turning around and hopping in to the steamy shower. Warm water flowed down his body, instantly relaxing him. Breathing in and out through his mouth as he just stood there in silence, not even a thought floating through his mind. Goosebumps rose on his arms at the calming sensation. Seconds turning into minutes, slowly waking his sleepy mind.
While he was thoroughly impressed the double spy agent thought to look outside the main crime scene, it did put Harry at risk of being exposed. As the cold, black eyes searched the rooftops of the surrounding houses, he momentarily hid fully behind the chimney. He stayed with his back fully against the brick structure and face overlooking the backyard of the property he was on, for more than a few minutes. Taking a deep breath, he turned his head and slightly peered over the edge of the chimney and saw the coast was once again clear to resume his normal position.
His thoughts were interrupted as he heard two sets of footsteps coming down the stairs. Harry turned to surprisingly find Ginny and Hermione walking down together. He would have thought the bushy haired girl would have left by now, wondering why she was still here. Perhaps she was offered a bed after the eventful day yesterday. He stared blankly at the two as they walked into the kitchen happily, sitting at the table full of food.
Harry peaked inside of the room cautiously to find a spacious bedroom decorated in colours of white, dark grey and green. He rolled his eyes at the glaring obvious Slytherin themed room. Pausing before he fully entered the room to check if there were any charms, spells, jinxs or wards in place. Harry scoffed as he sensed none. This family was either too careless to consider properly warding their home or too cocky to ward their home properly. It was probably the latter.
“No and yes,” he shrugged as he paused to take a sip of his glass full of pumpkin juice. “I have been overseas, but I was mainly in the United Kingdom.”
"A favour from each of you or a combined favour?" contemplated Harry, lightly stroking his chin with one hand.
There was no need to ask if Charlie had already done it because he trusted the other to stick to the training he taught. They stayed silent as the two of them watched the street with intensity. The seconds turned to minutes as the street continued to be void of all movement. However, it didn’t remain that way for much longer when a loud bang alerted them to the presence of someone new. They eyes roamed the street, looking for the person. Drew frowned as he continued to struggle locating them.
“No but’s Ron!” Molly said with a harsh tone, giving her son a warning not to argue anymore without consequences.
Finally, the door was opened by a flustered looking Molly. Seeing who was on the other side of the door, she stepped aside and smiled as she gestured for them to come inside. Closing the door, she led the two quiet Order members into the kitchen and continued cooking the lunch she had promised.
"How about that 12 piece set of Black Kunai Throwing Knives you've had your eyes on?" mused Drew. "They are 6 inches long, comes with a two small and compact leg sheaths, and I'm sure if I mention my name then I can get a new bullseye target."
The silver unicorn bowed to its creator before majestically prancing out of the office window and in to the dark night sky. With a soft smile, Drew made his way to the chest that sat in the far corner of the room. After tapping his wand three times on the lid, it creaked open and a large wooden structure arose from the depths. It held an array of weapons varying from guns, to knives, to swords, and even to a crossbow. Drew carefully pulled off three knives, his V42 Stiletto, combat knife and survival knife. Laying them out neatly on his desk, he pushed the weaponry structure down and closed the chest lid.
The day had gone by rather quietly for Harry for a change. After breakfast, he locked himself away in his room and buried his head in the book Grayson had given him. He had almost finished it thanks to being able to have time to himself that was distributed every so often. And although his knowledge on spells was quite extensive, he had learnt a few new ones that might come in handy for the future. Perhaps a thanks was in order to his little Gray.
Harry nodded and kept his eyes glued to the carpet in front of him which made the perfect excuse for his hair to hide the blush that rose in his cheeks when Malfoy touched his knee. Lifting his cup to his lips, he took a long sip as he glanced at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye and saw that the boy was looking intensely at him.
As Dumbledore entered the pensive with a deep, calm breath, he looked around to find himself in the overly familiar home of the Dursley’s. He noticed both Severus and Minerva had arrived as they stood beside him in the cramped hallway. Their attention was drawn to the staircase as a chunky small child eagerly pulled a thin woman downstairs, making a high-pitched whaling sound as he pleaded for some food to be made. A tired looking Petunia Dursley followed her son downstairs and into the kitchen. They followed her into the kitchen and watched as she struggled to pick up the whining child and place him in the high set chair next to the table. She quickly placed crayons and paper on the tray to occupy the kid.
“My apologise, Harry,” he said through gritted teeth, forcing a tired smile. “It’s been a rather long day, you must forgive this old man.”
"Three years have passed Albus," she whispered loud enough for everyone to hear. "Three years of nothing. Yet there was no guarantee that was him three years ago. It was a possible sighting from a person we cannot trust. There was no solid evidence it was him!"
“Best way to leave would be to go through the front door,” Harry whispered. “It’s the closet exit without apparating.”
“Of course,” widely smiled Molly. “I’m sure we can make some space in Ron’s room for you Harry dear.”
“Why yes, that’s right,” Dumbledore cleared his throat. “Such a long night, I do apologise for that small slip in information.”
Obviously it was time to go to Hogwarts for the Order meeting, and the Weasley’s were getting ready to leave. Harry wasn’t ready. Mentally, he was prepared, emotionally not nearly ready enough. He lowered the charms and wards he had erected around the room last night as footsteps slowly approached his door. Waiting in anticipation, the person on the other side took their time before finally a firm knock rung through the room. Harry got up swiftly and walked over to the door, prying it open without a pause. He looked into the eyes of Molly, patiently waiting for her to say something first.
One by one, the room slowly emptied. The mood amongst the Order members was one of grim defeat. They had not achieved much of what they had hoped for. Though to some, it was not surprising with the way the Headmaster had managed to deflect the topic off of himself by the end. However, what did take them by surprise was the way he was treating Severus. It was a vindictive side to him they didn't see at all. His old age must be showing off the cracks in his many layers.
"Potter stop," Drew shook his head with a chuckle, he couldn't keep up the stern facade when the younger said his surname. "I'm getting you that set whether you like it or not."
The small child flinched away as much as he could from the hand that grasped his shirt. The three adults watched on, two in disgust and one void of all emotion. Petunia dragged Harry through the invisible people to come to a stop outside of the cupboard under the stairs, the three now knew this was the permanent room the young child stayed in. Ominously, the small door was open, the darkness seen within caused Minerva and Severus to feel claustrophobic from where they stood in the hallway.
“Of course, I’ll be happy to have you stay with me,” said Ginny as she turned her head to smile at Hermione.
The room was full. Full of people, full of emotions, full of magic. An old wizard sat behind the desk pinching the bridge of his nose as he tried to focus on anything but the talk of the other order members in attendance.
Harry looked over to his desk, reviewing his selections that were neatly stacked in small piles. The only items he would want to add were his money pouch, his two way mirror and his new collection of candy he had received for his birthday. Summoning the candy stash from his bed and his money pouch and mirror from his bedside table, he added them to his pile. Satisfaction filled him for a few seconds as he looked over his packing, before sadness once again overcame him. He just was not ready to leave, not ready to leave behind everything he had here. He would miss this easy style of life; the quietness of being missing.
“Sure. Now can I go back to what I was doing? Fred, George, I promise I will seek you out when I am ready to see the products. And for merlin’s sake, don’t try and come in my room ever again or I’ll add hexes,” he said in a no nonsense tone before shutting the door in all five faces.
“Thank you for letting me help,” Harry turned to smile at her back before sitting down across from Hermione.
"Have you guys got any new potions or items that you've worked on since you left Hogwarts?" Harry asked, changing the subject that would also create more questions than answers.
“Yes Sir,” Harry nodded, concerned for the slightly older, missing man. They were rarely sent on rescue missions. And when they were, it was more so to retrieve the fallen bodies. “Exact location?”
"I did not call this meeting for meaningless chitter chatter," he growled out with barely contained anger. "I called this meeting in hopes of hearing some news on our current situation. Time is of the essence. You all know as well as I how important it is to find the boy."
“Do you expect us to take time off work to do this?” Alastor Moody barked from the back of the room.
“That would be very helpful. However, only if you believe you are up to such tedious task,” said Dumbledore with a kind smile, while inside he was jumping for joy as this would help his plans immensely.
With his eyes closed and breathing slowed, Harry looked for any signs of wards, spells, charms or jinxs. And a few moments later he was glad he checked as behind his closed eyes he saw a nasty jinx for any unauthorised personnel and an alarm that would be triggered. Quickly disabling it, Harry looked around the area before opening the door only slightly. He slipped in passed it and softly shut the door, clouding the room in darkness once more.
“Boys, no more of this nonsense. Last warning,” said Molly as she pointed the spatula at them threateningly.
Before she could utter a single word or make sense of what was happening, the stranger had lifted his wand to point directly at her. Through the daze Petunia was able to put two and two together enough to realise what was going to happen next to her. Utter terror flashed in her eyes before she squeezed them tightly shut. In this moment Petunia Dursley thought she was well and truly about to die. What had she done to deserve this?
“Mum said Lunch is ready,” Ron said after clearing his throat. “And she wanted me to come and tell you both.”
Petunia’s eyes slowly begun to flutter open. She swore she had just heard a strange voice in the room. Which would be impossible. Those blasted wizards had ensured no one could enter their house unless it was Harry Potter or themselves. But nonetheless, when she focused her eyes to the dimly lit room she found two strange men standing in the room. As more of her senses came back to her, she realised her right arm was on fire.
Finally after making their way through the twisting corridors, Malfoy came to a stop outside of a portrait of Salazar Slytherin.
“No one travelled back to the Burrow with you all?” asked Dumbledore, thoughts consumed with re-arranging his plans.
Harry nodded, interested in what other opinions the boy would have. He could possibly use this as an opportunity to learn in-depth about the dynamics at Hogwarts before he arrived; however prejudice they may be. Before coming here, he had read up on each person he could interact with; teachers, students, Order members, other public figures.
“If you could start on the bacon, that’d be great,” she smiled as she continued cutting the fresh fruit.
Dumbledore was left on his own in the tiny muggle kitchen. He listened to the soft talking from the family that had caused him so much distress and anger over the years. Here he was helping them when they had failed in the one task he asked them to do; ensure the boy lived until he could go to Hogwarts. It was not a hard task. It was not an inconvenience. It was not a burden on them. It was why he offered to compensate them generously with the boy’s money. He despised being in this house or anywhere near them.
long time. Dumbledore looked into the green eyes that defiantly stared back at him. If this brat wouldn’t reveal himself, or why he was truly here, he would have no choice but to force it out of him. Pushing into the mind of the stranger he tried to dig around as subtly as he could. Yet he was instantly met with strong barriers that protected his mind. Within less than a second, he was pushed out of the stranger’s mind, finding angry eyes glaring at him.
“Did you have any idea the entire wizarding world was looking for you?” she asked, tilting her head, placing her fork down.
Walking in to the living room, he decided to grab the photos now rather than later. At least he could avoid leaving the man unattended as to not give him a chance of escaping. Without hesitation, Harry made his way over to the bookcase closest to the television and scanned his eyes down to the third shelf. Compared to the other bookcase in this room, all of the books were close to the edge, whereas the books on the other were all pushed as far back as they could go. If Harry hadn't know what was hiding behind all of these books, he would have probably inspected it out of curiosity.
With a foggy mind, Harry placed the warm coat upon his shoulders and wrapped the comfortable material around his cold body. He looked at Drew sheepishly before settling in, looking expectantly at the other. He was eager to hear how the night turned out.
“No Ronald,” she sighed as she took off her apron and sent it over to its resting spot. “You are staying here with your sister.”
“What I am asking of you, is to let Harry stay here instead of being bullied by the Gryffindor’s. I also ask for him to get some professional help from a medi-wizard about his unhealthy state of mind,” Malfoy said, authority clear in his voice.
Harry slowed down as he approached the quiet town of Little Whinging, knowing exactly where the street in question was located from where hovered. Having travelled this route many times, he could have probably navigated his way to the Dursley’s house with his eyes closed. Quickly descending from the sky, his eyes were trained on the roof he was about to land on. Before he crashed into said roof, he pulled up the handle of his broom, floating inches above the dirty, red tiles. Softly climbing off of his broom and onto the roof below, Harry made his way immediately to squat beside the chimney.
The room watched the interaction, some with intrigue while some were utterly confused. The Headmaster tried to play off the small show of disrespect by walking back behind his desk and sitting down. With a wave of his hand, chairs appeared around the room. He gestured with a kind twinkle in his eyes for everyone to sit down. Harry ignored the order to instead stand off to the side in a pose much like before; arms across his chest and foot propped against the wall.
’, thick rope shooting out of its tip and wound tightly around the lifeless body. Repeating the same process with his aunt soon after that.
"Molly," he said with a sigh, standing up and making his way around to the front of his desk. "Any sighting is good news, whether it is true or not. It gives us the hope he is still out there."
“I’m apprehensive,” he gulped and looked over to his boss and mentor. “I don’t know what to expect when I arrive at Hogwarts.”
Slowly the room started to empty. Dumbledore holding in his anger and keeping up his happy-go-lucky appearance until each person had left. His eyes barely wavered from the young man who had caused him such a headache this meeting. From the blatant disrespect to exposing him, the stupid little brat had accomplished so much carnage in such little time. As soon as he heard the stone gargoyle fall back in place, he let out his pent up anger. Pages went flying. The lights flickered. Dust that had become unsettled from the top shelf floated down to the floor. Dumbledore had to remind himself to breath as he was almost overcome by rage.
The small group made their way up the stairs and towards the bedroom where it all seemed to be happing in. Dumbledore was the first to walk in to the chaos. He froze at the entrance of the doorway as his cold, disappointed eyes laid upon the family of three. Dudley Dursley was kneeling on the floor in the middle of the room, an inconsolable mess. Petunia Dursley was pacing back and forwards, holding a small, blood soaked cloth to her arm. Vernon Dursley was sitting completely still on the bed, staring numbly ahead with tears in his eyes. What got his and the other four’s attention was the bloodied knife he was loosely holding on to.
"While I must concur this level of domestic dispute has never occurred, the false alarm has been rung on one too many times in my honest opinion," Severus spoke up from the side of the room, turning heads. "Many of those incidents happened while Harry Potter was in their care however, and perished since he went missing. Leaving me to believe he was left in an unfit living arrangement."
“I-“ Harry tried saying, feeling a lump get stuck in his throat. “I really appreciate this, thank you all so much.”
So this is where the prejudice will come out, huh? Harry shifted in his chair slightly, straightening his back and nodding in intrigue. This is the juicy information he wanted to honestly hear about. He of course already knew about the supposed ‘feud’ between the two houses, but he wish he could speak up and tell the boy he was wrong. Not all Slytherin’s are like that, not all of them end up followers of Voldemort. It was quite ludicrous to think of that, and he wondered who planted that seed in his and many others mind.
“I have to get going, Grayson,” Harry whispered next to his ear as soon as the younger had calmed down.
“That’s okay, Molly. No need to worry about that,” she smiled, her cheeks turning bright pink in embarrassment.
Not only was the confused group of kids looking around for their target, but all three adults tried to figure out where the small child had disappeared to. No one present could explain how Harry could have escaped. With all those hands and bodies tackling the small framed child, there was no way he could have slipped passed. And Dumbledore, Minerva or Severus would have seen it having the height advantage. Gasps came from the group of children as the tall kid was pointing his lanky finger up towards the roof.
The bright moonlight that streamed through the window bounced off the knife to create a silver glow along the wall. Drew watched it in fascination as he brought it closer down to the still body beneath him. The reflection moved down with it, slowly coming to shine brightly on the closed eyes. He watched as Petunia frowned subconsciously in her sleep and twitched, almost as if she knew what was coming next. Before creating any new lacerations, he decided to toy with her and see if it provoked any reaction to the wards. Dragging the knife along her delicate skin, digging in to sensitive spots, leaving red marks from the sharp edge, smearing the already drawn blood around on her cheek.
“But that would be a suicide mission,” he stopped walking, looking at Harry as if he had lost his mind. “Look where it got me.”
"But I must assure you that the ward that was activated last night felt like a third party," Dumbledore spoke loudly above the noise, trying to reign in the group. "That is why I was very surprised when we saw what had happened upon arrival."
Without saying a word, Parker wrapped both of his arms around Harry’s tired looking body  before apparating them both to safety. The two landed in the middle of the lounge room where there just happened to be half of the house. Everyone gasped as they saw the two tangled up in one another. Harry groaned out as he tried to get out of this mess.
“Now, I am very happy to stay on the couch, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said as he turned back to the woman considering Dumbledore was currently stunned for words.
“That entry was very innovative of you,” Drew broke the silence after a few minutes. “Ten points for creativity. However minus five for tardiness.”
Knocking on the door to the Burrow, Remus and Nymphadora waited patiently in an awkward silence. Although their hands were full of light bags the pair felt exhausted for other reasons. Not only had Diagon Alley suddenly got very busy, but the whispers and rumours being spread had taken a toll on them. Remus was anxiously waiting for the door to open, hoping nothing had happened since they had left. Nymphadora saw the man fidget as he looked worriedly at the closed door. She couldn’t help reaching out and squeezing his arm in comfort.
“I’ll put you down for those two days. We’ll do four hour lessons considering how hard the subject can be and how much he needs to learn,” said Dumbledore, thinking out loud. “If you deem he needs more or less hours each week, you can adjust it as you please.”
Wiping his mouth and using a non-verbal and wandless charm to wash the putrid taste out of his mouth, he leaned back against the wall and slid down it, careful not to sit in the puke on the floor. Snape banished said puke and crouched down in front of the young, shaking, tear-faced man.
“How are they?” Drew asked as he came to stand next to Harry, looking at the dented target with a smirk.
“It was the twins, we are so sorry Harry dear,” Molly said in a rush, checking him over before quickly going downstairs now the crisis had been averted.
' just as Steven begun to look around at his surroundings. Thin ropes shot from his palm and coiled tightly around the lean body, rendering him completely immobile. Fear and panic set in on Steven's face, trying his best to escape from the confinements he found himself in. He looked up at the stranger that stood in his house, his face clouded in darkness from the hood he wore. He tried to soak up as much of this person as he could, committing details to memory in the case that he survived this home invasion. That's when he noticed the grey, metal box the person held in his hand.
Harry stayed silent as he too sat down. He continued to watch the beautiful night sky while he processed the information. Was he ready? Sure, he was more than capable to duel Voldemort and finish collecting all of the Horcruxes. The real question he had was if he was ready to go to Hogwarts. Was he ready? Not really. He didn’t know what to expect while attending the school. He wasn’t used to mainstream teaching or how school kids acted. He had never had friends before. Only family. The family he was brought in to by Drew that kept changing and evolving over the years.
“Of course it matters, you featherhead!” Ginny exclaimed. “That could have been really bad for Harry! No one was to know he had been found. No one was to know Harry is back finally. People are crazy, Ron. They could have taken Harry. They could have hurt him. You are an absolute idiot!”
“So on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, you can help Harry after his lessons with Severus and Minerva. On Tuesdays you can have the full day with him. I feel like that should be efficient to reach our end goal,” Dumbledore said as he jotted everything down upon the parchment. “From Saturday morning to late afternoon, Harry will train with Kingsley, Moody, and Nymphadora depending on who is available. That way there he can have a break before his lessons with Severus and have all of Sunday off. Is this understood and agreed upon?”
“Harry,” Remus injected before Dumbledore could say anything. “Unfortunately that place has been locked down since your Godfather, Sirius Black, went to Azkaban.”
The room was filled with a strained silence as green eyes stared down blue eyes. Refusing to move a muscle, he continued to stand in silence as he waited for the Headmaster to continue. However, movement from in front of him caught his attention. Relenting in the stare down with Dumbledore, he looked over to see Minerva make her way towards the chairs with shaky legs. The old lady appearing to be shaken to the core so much so that she could no longer stand. Without a word, he pushed the chair closer to her so she wouldn’t have to walk as far. A weak smile was flung his way, the witch too shy to look into his eyes.
“As you know, I sent Parker out on a mission to track down the diary a few days ago,” Drew begun slowly, pinching the bridge of his nose. “He has yet to return. I may need to send you out for a rescue.”
Minerva and Severus watched on with disgust as the young child turned around and started furiously hitting the small framed Harry over and over again. Harry whimpered as he fell to the floor, holding his hands to his face to try and protect it as much as he could. It was painstakingly clear to everyone present in this moment that this wasn’t the first time the young child had to protect himself from an onslaught of physical abuse. The way he almost relaxed his body to go with the hits to lessen the pain, the way he refused to yell or beg to let it be over quicker, the way he knew the most vital areas to protect from the blows.
No one dare speak another word in fear of the magic or dark eyes being drawn to them. The grey haired wizard scanned the room as he adjusted himself in his chair to sit up straighter.
Harry stood up and slowly looked around his room. He studied each piece of furniture, each sentimental present he had received, each fond memory that was etched in to his mind. A soft smile couldn’t help but grace his lips. As much as he was dreading leaving, he couldn’t help but be so grateful for being able to grow up here. He was so grateful to be loved, to be cared for, to be wanted. A shiver travelling down his spine as he imagined what his life would have been like growing up with the Dursley’s. No doubt it would have been a terrible, painful childhood. Considering what he went through in that short time as a young boy with them.
Before he could place the weapons away, he needed to cover them so that when he summoned them back up, he wouldn’t get cut. He sorted through all of the sheaths and holsters that matched their rightful weapons, making quick work of covering the sharp objects. A heavy sigh left his pinkish lips as he started packing his collections of combat and fighting weapons. At least he could easily summon them tonight if he needed them, since he would be carrying the pouch with him. He moved on to packing his books, luckily there weren’t too many he was taking with him. Anyway, he knew he could always go to the library at Hogwarts if he needed to study up on anything.
"No," smiled Fred as he turned his head to look at the ceiling, his twin doing the same. "No, he is too secretive to simply give out that small detail."
“I-I can help,” Hermione stuttered. “I know my things. I can help educate you now so you can get a head start before Monday. I can walk you through pronunciation, wand movements, specific things to avoid. Let me help, please.”
But the Harry Potter he was getting to know was distant, secretive and cold. Ron didn’t want to overwhelm him, but at the same time, this was the moment he had imagined for many years. And this wasn’t how he imagined it going. He was hoping to have a bit more enthusiasm from the other, especially considering he was graciously staying here in his home and practically demanded to stay in a room by himself. Thanks to him, he now had to share with his two oldest brothers, he would have much preferred to be roomed with Harry. Maybe that would have solved the coldness he was currently receiving.
A long, slim rope shot out from the palm of his hand and attached itself to the wall of the house. Harry stilled, knowing the rope was now visible to anyone. He looked over to the group and silently sighed in relief as they were all occupied. Not wanting to get caught, Harry gripped the rope with both hands, giving it a tug to ensure it was sturdy. He begun to scale the wall as if he weighed nothing. In the short amount of time it took to get to the window, he was neither out of breath or sweating.
Harry sighed tiredly as he begun to peruse the rest of the documents. Like the Requester had said, there was indeed all that information for him to read through. This was more detail than most people ever went in to. He was thoroughly impressed. Half of his mind wondered who the hell this person was while the other half wondered why they just didn't kill this guy themselves. Obviously they weren't confident they would get away with it. Hence why Harry, Drew and the rest of the group were there for. To kill the bad people that tormented the world, to reap the rewards, and to get that sweet revenge for the victims. This case didn't seem that hard. For the most part, half of his work had already been done. Now all he had to do was study the man's schedule and kill him.
“I may or may not have mentioned that Sirius Black was wrongfully convicted and he should be released,” Harry said sheepishly with a low voice as he turned his eyes away from the mirror.
“Such a waste of space,” she said with disgust lacing her voice. “You should have died in that car accident with your parents. Ungrateful, disrespectful, little brat. Just as disgusting as your no good father.”
With a resigned shake of his head, he walked back over to his desk. Grabbing his mokeskin pouch, he tied the drawstrings through a loop on his pants where belts normally sit. He hung it off a loop to the right side, so it was out of the way of most of his movements. Harry sighed heavily as he grabbed his first small knife, attaching it to his bicep with the aid of magic. Repeating the same with his other small knife, before grabbing the first set of six throwing knives. He squatted down, pulled up the pants to reveal his tanned skin and attached the holster tightly around his ankle. Covering them with the pants, he reached up and blindly fumbling around until he found the second set of six throwing knives. Quickly switching legs, he attached the holster on top of the pants instead, but just as tightly wrapped as the other one was.
A soft tapping noise brought Dumbledore out of his thoughts. Turning his eyes, he saw an owl flapping outside the window, patiently waiting to be let in. He flicked his wrist to open the window, intrigued by what the letter meant for him contained. The barn owl landed on the table and held its leg out. As soon as Dumbledore had untied the letter, the creature immediately took off without a blink, straight out the window it had been let in through. With curious eyes, he opened the letter hoping to find some good news after the visit he had had with Kingsley Shacklebolt and Alastor Moody an hour ago.
Although Dumbledore remembered something Kinglsey had said earlier in the conversation. Ronald had been talking too loudly about Harry to the girl. Maybe that meant that the two were both in Gryffindor and that’s how Ron knew her. It was the only feasible reasoning why the idiotic boy thought he could trust the girl enough to blow Harry’s identity in public. If it was true that she was indeed in Gryffindor, that could help his plans even more. Dumbledore would need to look into her student files more. But his mind was mostly made up for now.
Harry turned his head as Drew descended the stairs, watching as the older looked him up and down in amusement. Drew came down to stand directly in front of the shorter, inspecting him for any signs of injury. Thus finding nothing and deducting it was all simply the target's blood.
“Yeah, I’m sure you can see it another time,” he tried to play it off kindly. “Are you excited about coming to Hogwarts? It really is a great school. Well, for the most part anyway.”
“So you are aware that Sev will be made aware of this situation and that he must have a look through the journal?” questioned Malfoy, placing his coffee on the little coffee table to the side of the couch.
Everyone nodded their heads in the solemn silence. Dumbledore sat behind his desk, arranging a few pieces of parchment.
Drew smirked when an ungentlemanly snort was released from the younger beside him. Shaking his head in amusement, he sat up straight as his tone switched from light-hearted to serious.
“Here you are my dear boy,” Vernon Dursley’s obnoxiously loud voice boomed throughout the whole neighbourhood. “Take us for a drive. You’ve earnt it.”
“Sure you do,” chuckled Remus as he opened the door. “Otherwise you will feel all alone when you get to Hogwarts.”
“Hmm, I could,” he hummed, leading the way down the stairs. “I could if I wanted to get sloppy and lose focus on my main mission. I need to train, learn, and get ready for a fight. Not please some kid I may not even be in the same house as.”
“Just a random thought I had. No need to worry,” he smiled reassuringly, making a mental note to add that particular ward before it was too late.
Harry opened the letter up to find the familiar handwriting from Grayson. He chuckled at the timing of it all, with summoning a book signed by Grayson as well as receiving a letter from him. Sitting down, he begun to read through the letter, trying to hold back the tears the further he read.
“Now that I have your attention,” Dumbledore sighed tiredly, running a hand down his face. “Let’s discuss things, shall we?”
“While yes it may be better to focus on things in a duel, Harry needs to also complete his O.W.L.s in order to be eligible to start his 7
The Headmaster closed his eyes, trying to make any sense of this. He sighed before dismissing the ginger man with a lazy wave of his hand. His eyes looking for his next target.
“You don’t seem convinced,” Harry mused out loud, crossing one arm across his chest while the other hand stroked his chin in feigned thought, his knife hanging loosely in his grip. “How about I share some of my memories from my childhood. I give permission, for all three of you in fact, to view them in that pensive of yours.”
Or perhaps there was already a location that was already suitable enough to fit all of his needs. The only problem was that this property was locked down with the owner being imprisoned at Azkaban. As Dumbledore’s cold, blue eyes scanned the quiet land below him, he thought hard on the option. Would it be worth the trouble? Would it be worth stirring up shit within the Ministry of Magic at such an important time? Could he sacrifice the power he held within the Ministry just to keep his precious pawn safe?
“Very much, Harry,” Dumbledore reluctantly said as he sat down in his chair, glaring at the shoes on his desk.
“During an Order meeting as well?” scoffed Drew in disbelief. “So now everyone knows that you know more than you should? Harry, what were you thinking?”
Wind roared loudly in Harry’s ears, the ground a green blur to his eyes as he whizzed passed on his Nimbus 2000. The polished wood gripped tightly in his hands as he travelled at great speed. His body positioned close to the handle to help him swiftly navigate the property. Swivelling skilfully in and out of the tree line, parting the tall grass as he flew through it, running circles around the entire inside edge of the property line. It was refreshing to fly in the cool summer evening air, nothing to disturb his peace high up there. His mind was empty as he slowed down his movement, coming to a stop above the training grounds.
Spotting movement out of his peripheral vision he quickly ducked behind the nearest hedge. Harry double checked his Disillusion Charm was still present before turning his head to the right side to locate the source of his problem. About a hundred yards away were a small group both in the air and on the ground, five to be exact as Harry squinted to make out the figures in the dark. They all looked to be around his own age, perhaps these people were Lucius Malfoy’s son and his friends. He sat and watched for a few seconds, observing the two up in the air chasing each other while the others cheered them on.
“Professor Snape will be your tutor in a few things,” he continued on with a strained calm voice. “He will help you in Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Occlumency, and training for the inevitable fight against Voldemort.”
A shaky hand was placed on his shoulder, he opened his eyes to find Minerva with tear filled eyes, staring in sympathy at him. She was the only one he had freely told about his past. Of course both madmen that he served requested complete access to his mind and memories. While there were few things he chose to hide, like the fact he was a double agent, he could not hide his childhood abuse and neglect from either of them. He needed to show them his weak points so they wouldn’t focus on the parts that were just out of reach.
"We must have hope, Molly," Dumbledore said softly. "If we lose the only hope we have, we will never find him in time."
Nothing came out of Vernon’s mouth but gibberish, instantly going in to shock at who the invader really was. It had been many years since Vernon had seen the putrid kid, and it had been the happiest years of his life with him gone. He was thoroughly glad he had kicked the kid out. Even more so thinking it had resulted in the death of the burden child. But he couldn’t ignore the fact this person had the exact same rare eye colour as well as the same uncontrollable, messy mop of hair that his nephew had. The only thing that was vastly different was the absence of the ugly scar that had resided on his forehead.
The two men silently walked in and took a seat in front of the desk, the mood tense as they continued to stay quiet. Dumbledore looked between them, wondering what had happened for them to be so serious. Did something happen? Had Harry disappeared again? He swore he would track the boy down even if it killed him. Dumbledore had just gotten the boy back in his control and he wouldn’t allow the boy to slip through his fingers ever again.
“If anyone is still there, or if word has gotten out that Harry Potter was seen with the Weasley family, then they could easily come back with you,” he explained, many nodding in agreement.
"By who?" he frowned as he rolled his head to the side slightly, able to see the lower half of the face now.
Instead of apparating again, the young man ran along the rooftop in a crouch. If he had apparated from that spot, it would leave behind his residual magic, which could trace to him. Instead he fled the crime scene by foot. Choosing to jump from rooftop to rooftop until he was far enough away to use some magic. The young man pulled out a small box and within it held a miniature broom. As soon as the young man pulled the miniature broom out, it grew to its normal size. The nimbus 2000 reflected the moonlight off its polished wood, it's twigs neat and straight. The young man climbed on the broom and performed a quick Disillusionment Charm upon himself, both wandlessly and wordlessly.
"Harry," a thick Scottish accent rolling out as the older male smiled warmly up at him. "Take a seat for Merlin's sake."
“I know,” Harry sighed once more. “How will we be staying in contact? I guess you have a discrete method already planned?”
“Okay,” Malfoy held his hands up defensively and chuckled, finding it amusing that Harry has quick mood swings.
Drew chuckled loudly as he moved his coat to the side. Harry sat up in curiosity, watching as the older male pulled out a squared shaped gift that was covered by a brown wrapping paper. He held it in his hands for a second before he passed it over to Harry. He took the gift from Drew gently as if this was the most precious item his hands would ever hold. He placed it on the ground in front of his crossed legs and slowly unwrapped it, careful not to break whatever was inside. The brown wrapping paper fell aside to reveal a brand new, clean mirror. It reflected the stars above, the well defined twinkling made Harry smile.
Harry leaned back in his chair, awaiting to hear the plan. He hoped that deep down it would include some type of revenge on some of the people that abandoned or hurt him. Mainly the Dursley’s. But that was not limited to just them. Dumbledore and some of the others tasked to ‘
“Occasionally I was looked after by Arabella Figg who is a Squib and part of the Order of the Phoenix,” Harry continued without responding to the comment, making his point.
“Thank you Drew,” he said, looking up with a massive smile on his face. “I can’t believe you did this.”
Kicking off and heading high in to the sky, Harry swiftly manoeuvred around the breathtaking structure until he arrived outside one of the windows of the Headmaster’s office. He sighed as he couldn’t see any easy way in, of course nothing could simply go his way in a helpful manner. Thinking quickly, hoping he wouldn’t run out of time, he decided to break the window and repair it once he had successfully gained entrance. Gripping tightly onto the broom’s handle with the left hand, he raised his right hand into the air and concentrated on the bricks above the window.
Confusion and anxiousness flooded through the room. Never before had their leader demanded they start an emergency meeting without all current members being in attendance. They looked around the room at each other, the tense silence filling with talk as they tried to sus out the situation. Dumbledore however, ignored everything around him as his mind once again became consumed with plans.
“Remus,” he turned his head, ignoring the Headmaster. “You knew Sirius Black the most here out of any of us, did you not?”
The person that sat in front of Ron was not the person he thought The-Boy-Who-Lived would be. He thought that the Harry Potter he would eventually meet would be unsure of the world around him, perhaps even anxious and needing a new friend to rely on. He had always been prepared to take the boy under his wing to help him adjust to the wizarding world and help guide him through their years at Hogwarts. After all The-Boy-Who-Lived was always being brought up in conversation between all of the Gryffindor boys.
“I hope you didn’t lose your cool with him,” he interjected quickly. “You need to stay in control. Remember that he doesn’t know how much you truly know about him. Make sure it stays that way.”
Remus completely understood and respected the need for privacy around Harry’s past. And he was rather grateful the other did answer some of his questions today, even if they weren’t directly answering what he was asking. He noticed the willingness to open up just a little and appreciated that. With a smile on his face after realising that small detail, Remus walked down into the kitchen and sat beside an empty spot next to Nymphadora.
Without any more delay he placed his wand back in its holster on his right forearm, walked out of his office and headed down the stairs as quietly as his big, black, leather boots would allow him to. He paused briefly on the second floor and looked at the closed door where Harry was meant to be asleep. His eyes caught the slight shimmer of a spell that hid a certain person from view. Shaking his head with a smile, Drew continued to walk down the stairs.
"Do you think he'll take us up on that offer? Even if we give him some time to think on it?" asked George.
Harry ran over to the almost completely transparent person, wand trained on them in case they managed to break free of the cruse. The shimmer of the charm apparent now as he stood directly above the still body. He crouched down and tapped the person on the head gently to disable the Disillusionment charm. Slowly the charm faded and revealed Drew who was lying flat on his stomach with his wand in one hand and a dagger in the other.
“For yourself?” she asked, already knowing the answer, but still wanting to know from the man himself. “Or for Harry?”
Stilling as he heard a cough, he looked down to find Drew still looking out on the land in front of him. Sweat started to build on his left hand and forehead as he slowly manoeuvred his body to the right towards the rope, trying to be more centre under it. He used his hands to guide him over, not really needing his feet as this was more of a side-to-side movement. Once Harry was satisfied with his positioning, he grabbed the rope with both hands before proceeding to steadily and gradually bring his feet up to be against the wall. He felt comfortable with his legs about a shoulder length apart and how they were firmly flat against the surface.
“You know, you look so much like your father, James,” sighed Remus with a pensive look. “But you have your mother’s eyes. And you seem just as smart as Lily was as well.”
“Well if you need help understanding anything, I’ll be downstairs in Ginny’s room or the living areas, come find me,” she smiled sadly as she gave up before walking away.
“Has there not been conversations between the two of you about this topic?” Harry pressed on after the silence went on too long.
With his free hand, he grabbed the remainder of the rope and tied it securely around his waist. Hesitantly, his right hand let go of the rope until he was supported in the air by nothing but the rope. He couldn’t help but to let out a soft sigh of relief for the fact that he wasn’t currently plummeting to the ground. Harry held his left hand over the open pouch before summoning one of his less used knives. The smooth leather wrapped around the metal handle landed in his open palm. The short sword known as the Cinquedea would perfectly assist in his plan.
Satisfied that the memories he added would shock them all enough into believing he was the one and only Harry Potter, he stepped back and gestured for the three to come forwards. Harry watched Dumbledore, Severus and Minerva all enter the pensive, the latter with a reluctant last look towards him. Twirling his wand in his hand, he looked around the circular office, intrigued by the many gadgets that littered the spindly tables. He knew they would be a while, so why not explore the office whilst he waited? His eyes caught sight of an old and battered hat sitting on the shelves behind the Headmaster’s desk. Its exterior frayed and extremely dirt, with parts of its brown material patched together.
“This may not be convincing enough for some of you,” he continued, pushing off the wall and walking up beside Dumbledore’s desk. “Perhaps this will help clear the air. Perhaps we should ask someone who knows more than any of us do.”
"Firstly I will ensure no one can hear you scream as what I'll be doing will be very, very painful," he continued on as if it was a normal everyday conversation. "Next, I'll start slicing and dicing. I'll make sure I get creative, don't you worry my kind sir. Lastly, once you have gone to sleep like you wanted, I'll lay out all of these photos around you so whoever finds you first understands why this happened. Your
Staying on the top step, Harry leaned forwards and placed his ear against the door. He stilled his breathing as he listened for any signs of life on the other side. After half a minute, he felt it was safe enough to open the door and begin their slow escape. Within a nod to Parker, Harry slowly turned the door knob, pushed it ajar slightly and peaked his head out to scout the surrounding areas.
Entering their own room, Fred and George separated to sit on their own beds. They both felt drained after not only that strange interaction with Harry, but the Order meeting that morning. It had already been such a huge morning for the pair. Their minds struggled to process all of the information they had learnt. The silence continued as they dwelled on the events over the past day, trying to find the words for it all.
The kitchen sounded very quiet for the first time since Harry had arrived at the Burrow. Curiously peaking around the corner, he found that only Molly stood in the kitchen, cooking away like a mad man. A soft smile graced his face as he quietly walked into the room, not wanting to disturb the woman that was deep in the zone. Harry really appreciated all of the hard work Molly does. She was constantly in the kitchen cooking food for an overcrowded household. If it was him, it would have driven him up the walls by now.
Nodding his head, Dumbledore moved passed the group and headed over to the only house with lights on. He controlled his breathing and kept his heart from beating too quickly. Anxiety flared through him. This could only be one thing; an attack on the Dursley’s from Voldemort and his lackies. The biggest fear he had was to find them all dead. Once he found Harry, he would have the unfortunate news of telling the poor boy his only living relatives were perished. He needed the boy to be able to concentrate on training rather than grieving.
With eyes closed, he focused on the location in his mind before apparating the next second. He opened his eyes to find he successfully travelled to the outskirts of Hogwarts. Towering over him was the Main Entrance Gates of Hogwarts herself, the wrought iron shining in the moonlight. At either side of the gates sat two winged boards, looking over the entrance, ready to protect when the time arose. Harry looked around from where he stood, a plan formulating in his head without any effort. Not far from the gates were a small group of bushes, perfect for hiding behind.
Without wasting any more time than he already had, Dumbledore shifted the Hogwarts wards to allow him to leave. He quickly apparated away, landing at the start of the quiet street. He wasn’t alone either by the time he arrived. Severus Snape, Arthur, Fred and George Weasley stood in a small circle under a street lamp nearby. He swiftly made his way over to them, annoyed the stupid alarm had woken him up and frazzled the common sense out of him.
Harry shook his head in amusement, a fond and rare smile settled on his face. He too sat down on his bed. However he sat with his back to Drew, hunched over with his hands in his hair. He was still half asleep despite the sudden surprise attack. Ever since he had started training with Drew, he would plan these surprise attacks randomly to prepare him for anything. It was a fun way to keep Harry on his toes. Alert and ready always.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Headmaster Dumbledore,” Harry growled, not flinching a muscle even if his body wanted to lunge at the man so badly. “Accessing minds without permission can be treacherous grounds.”
"No," Harry seductively whispered. "No I won't take them and leave. The world must know what you did. You must pay the price for your actions."
It was exactly what he thought it was, a Mokeskin pouch. A pouch made from the skin of a Moke, made to store items that only the owner can retrieve once placed inside. He knew it looked small in size, but if it had an Extension Charm placed upon it, it would allow for extra room. Already thinking of all the precious items he could store in there while at Hogwarts. Harry carefully took it in to his own hands. He felt slight uneasy as he felt the cool scales move in his hands as if it was still attached to the animal it was made from. He opened the top that was closed by thick, black drawstring. Peering inside, he saw the inside was lined with a soft, beige leather material. He ran a finger along the soft leather, loving the sensation of it.
Unlike coming in, Harry wanted to stay on the grass side of the bushes as it will give more cover from the windows. As they walked to the first one, he kept looking over his shoulder and scanning the windows for any movement. He crouched down, forcing Parker to do the same, just after they got to the first hedge.
"That is for me to know," he smirked darkly, sending shivers down Steven's body, "and for you to never find out."
“One day I might be able to tell you. But today, or anytime in the near future, will not be that day,” softly smiled Harry. “I won’t tell anyone, so you don’t need to worry.”
Nodding his head in agreement, Harry allowed Molly to lead the way up the stairs. They walked up to the third floor which only had two doors. The opened door closest to the stairs revealed a small mismatched bathroom, leading him to believe the closed door was a bedroom. Molly opened the door to the bedroom, walking inside and quickly tidying the piles of messing clothing into a suitcase. Harry walked in to observe the rather spacious room. It had two beds, personalised posters, objects scattered everywhere, and a double door closet off to the side.
For the Order members that were in the dark about the prestigious Headmaster Albus Dumbledore having a spy in the Death Eaters, the news shocked them to the core. How had they served the Headmaster for so long, yet not be informed he had someone that was feeding him information from the other side. Is this how Dumbledore was able to learn of the attacks that happened years ago? Or how he knew there was a staff member who harboured He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named on the back of his head, trying to help him regain a body and immortality from the Philosopher's Stone?
“Homenum Revelio,” Harry whispered under his breath, fingers crossed that this wouldn’t end in disaster.
“It was by a witch named Rita Skeeter,” she replied with a roll of her eyes, discarding the newspaper on the bench.
“Indeed. Well I am sure I’ve finally gotten across to Dumbledore that I am a stranger to him. Not that he wanted to play along with that. He referred to me as his boy multiple times throughout the night,” sneered Harry, not able to help the strong emotions now he was in private.
“Enjoy breakfast, you earned it after all of the help,” Molly smiled as she sent the spare apron back to its place and continued cooking.
“The honour is all mine, my dear boy,” tears welling up in her eyes once more as she took in the beautiful face before her.
The day had gone by without many more disturbances. Harry was left to himself for the most part, only being told food had been prepared downstairs if he wished to eat. He didn’t stay for long, only eating what would satisfy him for the time being. He took a book with him in hopes the others wouldn’t try to engage in conversation with him. Unfortunately it did not deter Molly or Ron enough, as he was forced to talk with them. Perhaps tomorrow he could take the food back up to his room to continue studying, his time was precious after all.
Why can’t anything just go to plan? Why were there always bumps in the road? Albus Dumbledore was known for his great leadership. But ever since the Potter brat had turned up, nothing was working in his favour. He just wanted to be in control again. He just wanted everything to happen exactly like he wanted it to. Perhaps Dumbledore needed to step in more. Maybe that was the only way for things to stay on track from now on.
While the rest of the group begun to laugh, Harry stormed his way up the stairs and directly to Drew’s office. That was the last thing he needed after the way the mission had gone.
Severus gulped and looked at Dumbledore for his reaction. How could the man leave the child in such conditions? Surely he knew what was going on. Otherwise the squib did a horrible job of overseeing Harry. As Severus looked closer at the Headmaster, he noticed a content twinkle at the scene before his eyes. He felt sick to his stomach, he knew both men he served were mad, but the lines of who was more insane was beginning to blur.
As if right on cue, Steven emerged out of his bedroom dressed in a baggy, white t-shirt and plain, grey sweatpants. He rubbed his face tiredly as he begun to descend the stairs, only to freeze as his eyes laid upon a figure standing in his house. Blinking to see if the darkly dressed figure would disappear, he shook his head in confusion.
Both men nodded before the room disappeared from Dumbledore’s view. He sunk deeply in to Petunia’s mind, feeling the emotions tenfold from the distressed woman. Flickering through the last few moments, he arrived finally to the intended destination. He watched intently as the memory played out in front of his eyes. Petunia turned her head to the side to see her Husband slowly waking up as well, a soft smile settling on her face. Until she spotted the knife covered in blood in his hands.
With his large cousin now out of the way with a full body-binding curse, Harry scoffed as he turned his attention back to his slicing. He managed to finally separate the member from the hand, watching with glee as his uncle’s eyes rolled back in his head and passed out from the pain he was undergoing. Although, as much as it was easier to do his work without a fight, he was feeling quite sadistic right now. He wanted to be able to revel in the pain, to see each moment he hit the right nerve, to know that he was experiencing just as much pain that he had inflicted with these fingers.
Harry didn't say anything, instead letting the silence to linger between them. He was hoping that it would just drive Ron out of the room if he stayed quiet for long enough. Why could he not read the signs? It was pretty obvious that he didn't want to talk with him. So why was he still sitting there, thinking of something to talk about? Maybe he was encouraged to by his parents or one of his siblings.
Harry carefully looked at the old coot, scrutinising every move and breath the other made. Not knowing if he should trust him enough yet, he decided to give in partially by standing up and stepping over to the other side of the desk. He came to stand beside chairs so no one was out of his line of vision. He smiled darkly at the other in defiance as he continued to stand. Finding satisfaction in the uncontrollable twitch that adorned the Headmaster’s face as he made his way to his own desk chair. Once more, he thought of how fun this was going to be. It would make all his anxiety disappear to know the other was struggling by his ominous presences.
The small group's attention was drawn to the front door as Molly, Bill, Kingsley and Alaster walked back inside. A gentle smile immediately graced Molly’s face as soon as her eyes landed on Hermione staring at Ron with a sparkle in her eyes. The four adults came over and looked upon the children that were eagerly waiting.
“Harry, please don’t be unreasonable. You need to stay with a wizard your age to help you. We are only thinking with your best interests in mind,” said Dumbledore as he placed a firm hand on the young boy’s shoulder.
“Well yes, but it’s very important for him to pass his O.W.L.s as well all of the other training he’ll be doing with the Aurors,” Molly said before turning her back and walking towards the front door. “I’ll go ask Kingsley now, behave while I’m gone.”
A second popping sound indicated a new arrival which was closely followed by two more. Distant voices floated to their ears from the left, drawing their attention to the very start of the street. Four silhouetted outlines stood under a street lamp, talking and pointing to the Dursley’s house. Drew looked down at his watch to find it had taken them eight minutes to arrive since the alarm first started. Typical. Drew was glad there was no actual sense of urgency from the Order, it just confirmed his suspicions of the man in charge.
“We need to find Harry Potter,” Dumbledore continued loudly, trying to be heard over the noise. “I have a proposed plan for our searches.”
“I’d rather that than think I’d done that to you,” Harry sighed and wiped the slight sweat away from his forehead.
Turning around, he took in the faces of his relatives. Disgusted by the state that had allowed themselves to progress into. The greasy skin shone in the lighting, clothes barely concealing their large bellies, fat, short fingers hanging loosely over the edge of their favourite seats, the stench of alcohol permeating from both father and son. His eyes caught sight of the cupboard he used to be condemned to. Fist tightened around the handle of his wand, anger seeping out and lashing out at the small vase of flowers sitting on the wooden coffee table. The vases smashed in to a million little piece, combusting absolutely everywhere, nothing safe from the sharp shards.
“There was this one witch saying she had photographic evidence that he is alive,” continued Nymphadora with ease. “She was yelling for everyone to look out for the article in the Daily Prophet tomorrow.”
“Could be that house elf of yourself playing tricks,” a deep voice said, Harry didn’t know who it belonged to.
“I know you want to draw everyone away from Hogwarts when you are discovered,” he continued. “And I also know you have always secretly wanted revenge on your relatives.”
Unbeknownst to Nymphadora, her hair turned from a dark brown to a rosy pink that resembled the same colour of the blush on her cheeks. Her glistening green eyes stared at the back of Remus as he walked around in silence. Caught up in her own thoughts, she barely registered the people around her. Muttering apologises as she blindly followed Remus around like a lost puppy.
“I agree, it will raise suspicion,” nodded Kingsley as he quickly shot a look at the passive kid off to the side. “Leave it with me and I will owl everyone instructions on Thursday.”
“Not at all,” he said with a small smile. “I don’t care what it shows as long as it isn’t putting you all in danger.”
“Should we not test his knowledge beforehand, that way we aren’t wasting precious time?” she asked with a frown, many others nodding in agreement. “Especially if his time could go towards things that will be helpful in duels, rather than the school year ahead.”
“I understand,” he sighed, looking down at Harry with sad eyes. “But would you not like to be in Gryffindor like both of your parents?”
“Harry, I’d like you to meet my family,” she nervously said, wringing her hands together. “If you need anything, anything at all, they will help you while you are staying here. You are part of the family while you’re here.”
The whole room fell silent, all attention towards the outwardly calm Headmaster of Hogwarts. No one seemed to breathe as they waited for him to continue, all hanging on to each word he spoke like some type of God. Well most of the members. There were a few in attendance that didn’t see Dumbledore as the wholly and mighty wizard people make him out to be. They knew firsthand how vicious and dark the wizard can get. Secretly, those people only joined the Order to defend the wizarding world from the Dark Lord when the ministry did nothing about it almost five years ago.
Filled with shame and a sense of loneliness, Harry broke down and dropped to his knees, sobbing into his hands. Quiet footsteps made their way over towards him and the next thing he knew, a carefully placed hand started rubbing soothing circles on his back.
“Why search, Albus?” Molly cried out, tears rolling down her face while hugging Fred… or George. She was so upset she couldn’t tell in this moment. “He could be dead for all we know.”
All three boys chuckled at the sight of a red cheeked Ginny. She quickly looked up the stairs before angrily turning around and leaning in closer to her brothers. Her face getting close to the same shade as her fiery, red hair.
"Of course. I've never felt such power from someone when performing wandless and wordless magic," Fred shivered as he recalled the moment in his mind.
Thank you all so much for all of your kind comments and questions! Also I'd like to thank you for being patient with me while I wrote this extra long chapter. I hope you thoroughly enjoy it, please comment at the end of the chapter to let me know if you liked it.
After a lengthy walk, the pocketknife had led him to a more secluded part of the town. Along this road were houses that looked to be built in the 18
Charlie merely nodded in agreement before they stood at the edge of the wards on number 4 Privet Drive. He closed his eyes as he begun to access the log for the wards, deciding which ones to take down first and which ones to leave. It was a bit of a lengthy process as it seemed new ones had been added for extra protection in the last few weeks. Finally he disabled the first one, a ward to detect any magical use or signatures. Followed up by the alarm if trespassers were on the property, then the anti-intruder ward, the ward to trap unauthorised personnel, and the ward that alerted the Order members to any potential trouble makers, just to name a few.
Smoke rapidly seeped out of both his hand and wand, filling the room with a grey haze with double the speed. Soon both Lucius and Narcissa were gone from his view, engulfed in the smoke. Praying that the older male didn’t move around too much, Harry drew upon his memory to help him escape. Walking slowly towards the staircase, sticking to the wall, Harry watched in amusement as Lucius casted spell after spell after charm after charm. What the other didn’t know was that by casting these spells, Harry could safely locate him and avoid running in to him while making his escape.
“Completely erased. Parker apparated us from afar after I did my final sweep,” he said, watching for a reaction.
“Nothing Uncle,” his body drawing in on itself, eyes darting everywhere trying to find an escape route.
Remus couldn’t move from the shock at what he had just witnessed. Harry Potter was sitting at the desk on the other side of the room, back to the door and head buried in a book. Yet he had opened the door wordlessly. He also thought the boy was too still if he had gone to put away his wand, not seeing the wand in his hand. Did that mean what he thought it did? Eyes trained on the head of jet-black hair, he forced himself to enter the room and close the door behind him.
Harry nodded his head. Drew and him had previously talked about what would need to happen if Voldemort came back. He dreaded the plan they were about to put in place. But he understood that he had an important role to play in this war.
“Dudley, in life we have to teach those disobedient to us lessons. How about you teach your cousin a lesson as to why he shouldn’t touch what isn’t his,” Vernon smiled, making Minerva shiver in disgust.
The young man observed the house. Eyeing the backyard, he made a decision to climb the tree that would give him a good view of inside the house. He swiftly made his way up as if he weighed nothing. Crouching in the branch, concealed by the leaves and his black attire, the young man scoured the house for any sign of life.
“I’m going to need it,” Kingsley laughed darkly before waving goodbye to the group and walking out of the house.
Scanning the windows as well as the grounds, Harry felt it was safe enough to go back inside. He ran while staying as low to the ground as possible. Nodding in satisfaction when he reached the door within seconds, knowing it will be an easy run to Parker on his way out. He paused briefly to control his breathing before he opened the door once more. Sticking to the right side of the hallway, Harry made his way along it towards the staircase.
Ducking, twisting, weaving and turning, all the while occasionally punching out at an invisible target. Harry imagined the sharp point of the knife entering different parts of the body, immobilising the imaginary attacker. The longer he continued practicing, the more sweat that begun to form around his body. He hadn’t been able to do anything like this in five days. His body craved it like a car needing oil. He could feel all of the day’s tension and frustrations fading with each imaginary blow.
“Of course, I’m sure you can help Harry study the other subjects for his O.W.L.s,” smiled Dumbledore, hoping perhaps with the help from Remus he could keep the boy in control with the his plans. “Anyone else?”
The familiar scenery of the Weasley's land came in to view as Harry landed on the soft grass after being side along apparated by Bill Weasley. The small trip up to the Burrow was filled with silence. The family surprised by what had occurred during the meeting. Although the twins seemed to be the least shocked out of them all. Considering they already noticed things about the young man that were unusual. Both the twins looked at each other before looking at Harry who was slightly behind all of them. They understood each other without having to say a word; they needed to get to the bottom of things now.
“You really think Sirius is innocent and Peter is still alive?” Remus asked after the silence stretched on.
Leaning back, he kicked his legs upon on the desk, not caring a bit that he knocked some of the paperwork out of place. Gracefully he crossed his legs at the ankle and pulled out his Blackhawk Tatang knife from its sheath. Twirling it absentmindedly in his hands as he allowed his mind to wander for a moment as he patiently waited for the group to arrive. Harry allowed his eyes to wander occasionally, smirking as he saw some of the portraits silently observing him while others openly gossiped. He was grateful they didn’t seem to leave the portraits to alert Dumbledore, wondering if they were curious how events would play out or they were disloyal to the current Headmaster. Perhaps a mixture of both.
“We made some new ones just for you,” both the twins smiled nervously as Harry stared at them impassively.
A bright, white light illuminated the space near the tip of the wand, allowing Drew on the other side of the mirror to finally see Harry’s face. The two smiled warmly at one another, finding comfort in the presence of a loved one. Drew could tell that Harry was tired just by looking at his face. His usual carefree expressionless face littered with exhaustion. He wondered what was going on to cause him to be this tired. Perhaps it was the task at hand. Or maybe he was emotionally drained already. Possibly he just yearned for some familiarity and security as Drew watched content form on the younger’s face.
