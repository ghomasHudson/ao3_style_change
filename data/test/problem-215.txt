Despite spilling her drink, it looked as though the woman had managed to keep herself from dropping the glass in her hand. As she straightened herself back up, the long hood that had been covering her face suddenly slid down her head past her shoulders, inadvertently exposing her face.
"No idea what you're talking about, MacDougal."
She was
The somberness of Draco's mood must have been transparent on his face, because when he finally arrived in St. Mungo's that morning and rushed to the Nurse's station to prepare for his rounds, his supervisor (a kind, motherly Healer in her forties named Estelle) smiled at him and gave him a knowing look.
"I do."
She seemed to stare off into empty space for a few seconds, as though seriously considering his question. Finally, she nodded to herself in affirmation and leaned up so she could whisper her next words discreetly into his ear.
"Is it?"
"So what do we do?" Pansy looked worried as she reached for Corey again, pulling him closer to her. "Do we just let this bastard get away with this? He's been trying to set us up all year." She growled angrily.

He let out a weary sigh and leaned back against his seat.

Aria waited until they were safely back down in the dungeons near the Slytherin Common Room before she turned to Corey, grabbing him gently by his arm and turning him around to face her. When he blinked up at her in confusion, Aria placed both of her gloved hands on his shoulders and bent down slightly so that she could peer into his face.
Aria finally lifted her gaze and smirked at him, allowing him to see the steel-like glint in her eyes.

So brace yourselves, and I hope you all stay with me till the end! :D
"And I don't suppose the whole monogamy thing that comes with marriage doesn't turn you off either?" Blaise chimed in, grinning obnoxiously at Morag from across the table.
Aria's expression grew dark, and she raised her wand, pointing its tip right against the middle of Fisher's forehead. She spoke her next words at the exact same time Draco raised the feather in his hand and shouted loudly enough for her to hear him.
In spite of himself, Draco's lips twitched at her answer.
She tried to speak, but when it came out as a choked sob, Draco's arms tightened around her and he leaned down, hushing her softly as he cupped her face with his hands and caressed her cheeks. "You're stuck with me, Potter...And even if you eventually tell me that you hate me and scream at me and tell me to go to hell, I will

You're so...tight..." He croaked out.
Simply by listening to the sounds of her sighs and the soft, high-pitched cries that she couldn't seem to hold in no matter how much she tried, he was already discovering so much about the many little ways he could pleasure her. Aria had always been easy for him to read after all, he had studied her facial reactions for

"B—but still, h—how did you—"
"I'm not interested in money."
And to find out that they were the same person—
Morag ignored his reaction and went on. "The whole idea of marriage itself has always been such a
"What about him?" Wood countered.
Draco warned sharply.
"We're not really going to spend the whole morning studying DADA are we? Can I just tell her you tutored me even if you didn't?" He complained, the protesting tone of his voice causing Aria's lips to twitch with amusement.
Because her instincts told her that if there was
Aria flinched at that, quickly averting her gaze.
She waved her wand at the blackboard again, completely erasing her name away.
"I don't understand. If Malfoy's here, how will this even work? What am I doing here?!" Aria pointed out, tapping her foot impatiently on the ground. "I mean, aren't
"I'm a Gryffindor now, Ron. I can sit with you." Luna offered softly, giving Ron another one of her dreamy smiles. "I'm quite excited about the whole resorting, actually. I've always wanted to be a Gryffindor."
She rolled her eyes at his incoherent responses. "I share a dormitory with her, okay? I see her casting all sorts of weird concealment charms around her bed curtains at night. Not to mention how she freaks out every time one of us walks into the bathroom when she's in the shower."
seem to be the case." Morag agreed wholeheartedly, nodding at them in affirmation.
"Oh good god." Aria groaned as she turned away from him and closed her eyes, covering her face with her hands. "Was it really that obvious?"
Draco knew perfectly well that the response of the Head of Veela Affairs was made to address the latest piece published by Rita Skeeter.
"This is ridiculous." Draco growled under his breath, running a hand through his unusually disheveled blond hair. "Some asshole is obviously trying to pin this on us and isn't even bothering to be discreet about it." He snapped.
" He told her.
"A little." Aria admitted ruefully as she self-consciously adjusted her braid. "Unfortunately, suppressing my appearance doesn't do anything to dispel the veela allure. Just as Fleur said, I have to keep my hair tied back all the time to lessen it."
with all of their shenanigans and sneered in disgust at Blaise's giggling form across the table.
"Careful, Aria. That stuff's
He stared after her retreating form for a minute, blatantly enjoying the view. Though, the smirk on his face quickly transformed into a scowl when he noticed just how many of his male (and female) schoolmates around him seemed to be doing the exact same thing. Still scowling, Draco forced himself to shake his jealousy away before Aria could notice it through their bond, and he took that opportunity to glance around his surroundings.
"Come on, ladies. I really need your help here." Hannah ignored Blaise's comment and turned to Pansy again, yanking impatiently on the other girl's sleeve. "Pansy,
"It's not that hard to guess. Malfoy probably grew tired of dating an annoying girl who did nothing else but nag him all the time." Neville commented sarcastically, not even bothering to look up from his plate as he reached for another roll of bread.
Her eyelashes fluttered as she stared up at him with a fond look on her face. She cupped both of his cheeks and pulled his head down, bringing his mouth back to hers.
within ten meters of their table) that Greg and Astoria had drifted off into their own little world.
at me. Oh so Slytherin-ly, I might add. Stop it or I'll jinx you." Ron gave her another mock glare and tried to elbow her again, only for Aria to easily evade him and scoot gracefully away.
Draco looked incredibly amused at her reaction but, to her immense relief, he finally got the hint and backed off.
And Pansy was wrong, it wasn't like he liked Aria Potter or anything.
He scowled and immediately tore his gaze away, barely resisting the petulant urge to knock the last photograph off the shelf as he exited the room and headed up the stairs. When he reached the doors to her bedroom, he hesitated, unsure if Aria had actually given him permission to explore the second floor.
"This year is so much fun. Last week, it was you and Aria. This week, Pansy and Neville." He smirked at the irritated look on his friend's face and turned to give the rest of his housemates a playful wink.
"Greg,
Rolling her eyes, Pansy was just about to walk off when several shouts coming from her right caused both her and Aria to look up. They glanced to the side, their eyes widening in surprise when they saw Hannah arguing loudly with Ernie Macmillan near one of the refreshment tables. The former couple was so engrossed with shouting at each other that they barely noticed everyone else around them watching their altercation.
"She got…
Draco stiffened in shock, and suddenly, it felt as though all the air had been sucked right out of his lungs.
"Do you feel this?"
"It was fine—"
, is quite complicated." Fleur's eyebrows fused together as she leaned back against her seat and took a moment to gather her thoughts. "Currently, there is a law in place that punishes those who attempt to force a bond with an unmated veela, labeling the offense as similar to 'attempted rape'. However, and it is important that I emphasize this – the law is written such that only the veela who was attacked can initiate the criminal proceedings. And because of this poorly worded law, only cases where there was
Draco lowered his gaze to the folded-up copy of the Daily Prophet that Blaise wordlessly handed to him. With a sigh, he set his cup down and took it, slowly unfolding the newspaper out in front of him.
Aria chuckled and finally decided to put the poor boy out of his misery.
reason for the gloves?" He finally drawled after a long moment of awkward silence on Potter's part, gesturing to the black leather gloves that covered the dark-haired girl's hands.
Greg's eyes widened and he suddenly began screeching as he practically leaped towards her, twitching and jerking frantically in an attempt to shake the tarantula off.
She removed his anti-bewitchment ring and, within seconds, his eyes grew dazed and his pupils dilated with lust as he was pulled under her veela allure. More shockingly, despite his body's physical exhaustion, Draco felt himself harden instantly at her touch.
"Then go and ask one of your Hufflepuff friends for help!" Pansy retorted.
"You have to take a shot." Blaise ignored Neville's comment and handed Aria the shot glass in his hand, rolling his eyes when Aria's first instinct was to sniff suspiciously at it. "It's just a little liquid courage, Potter. To help you loosen up a little."
"We do
Aria heeded his warning and froze in place.
Blaise ignored Pansy's outburst and looked up, giving Draco an infuriatingly calm look.
Unfortunately, before they could reach the doors, they were forced to stop when another group of eagerly screaming reporters swarmed around them, blocking their path. Draco shoved Aria behind him, blocking her face from the flashing cameras. To their dismay, a couple of Daily Prophet columnists, including a gleeful-looking Rita Skeeter, swooped down on them with vicious smiles.
She grabbed Hannah by the arm again, leading her across the Great Hall towards the exit.
Draco blushed when he realized he was staring too long and politely withdrew his gaze. Luckily, he saw that none of the other guys in the table seemed to notice Aria's little wardrobe malfunction.
Firenze was silent, his deep blue eyes fixed intently on Aria's face as though he was trying to search for something. Whatever it was, he seemed to find it because he then tilted his head slightly to the side and regarded Aria with an intensely deciphering look.
Aria glanced over her shoulder and scowled at him.
At the sound of the sharp gasps and amused snickers from the crowd, Aria snapped the folder shut and set it back down onto the table. She looked up and met the horrified expression on Skeeter's face with another smile. "If I recall, you mentioned in your last article about how you thought veela magic was 'absolutely abhorrent', and that our beauty was simply a 'magical illusion' created to distract people from our 'manipulative nature'." She drawled.
Neville looked embarrassed as he scratched the back of his head.
She couldn't explain why, but she felt a foreboding feeling of dread creep into her chest when Professor Slughorn and Headmistress McGonagall suddenly came storming through the Slytherin Common Room entrance. They were wearing identical somber expressions on their faces as they inspected the area thoroughly, as though trying to ascertain something. Afterwards, they whispered to each other in hushed voices before proceeding to wake up the Slytherin Prefects from all year levels and instructing them to follow McGonagall back to the Headmistress' office.
Aria froze in the middle of reaching for a new set of plates and glanced at Blaise from the corner of her eyes.
He alternated the movements of his mouth from licking and nipping to kissing and sucking, using the sound of her moans and the urgency of her breaths as cues to guide his tongue to the right spots. It was an entirely new, learning experience for him, because he hadn't been lying when he told her that he had never done this before, but he soon realized that he
"I did
She winced as she felt him plunging impossibly deep into her, slamming against her cervix in a way that was straddling that very thin line between pain and pleasure that she just knew she was going to have trouble walking straight tomorrow; but still, she didn't care.
"Is it because you're a
"Draco, what are you still doing in here?!" She demanded, not even bothering to wait for his answer as she began dragging him impatiently towards the doors. "Blaise said he'd meet us at the Three Broomsticks for dinner this evening, we'd better get going if we want to make it."
"I can't
happens to be very good friends with the captain of Puddlemere United—"
"Shall we execute our classic snake play then?" He asked.
Blushing, Aria tried hard not to think too much about the implications of that, especially since she knew Draco probably just reacted instinctively. She'd like to think she knew him well enough by now to know that her formal rival was
"Shut it, Blaise." Draco cut him off sharply, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He placed a heavy hand on Blaise's shoulder and gave it a hard squeeze. "Or I'll tell the Hufflepuffs that the reason they had to walk backwards during the NEWTs was because you switched their plates with the Gryffindors that day."
"Potter, I've worn this ring since I was thirteen years old and I can assure you, it has
"...Together?"
too bright; and the whispers rippling through the crowd of students around her were too noisy. She covered her ears and hid her face by crouching down into a fetal position on the floor. Even then, she felt the weight of everyone's stares and she sensed her own veela pheromones going haywire as they permeated the air.
She looked up slowly, meeting his worried look with a sheepish grin.
She appreciated the opportunity she was given to spend more time to herself, and as much as she loved her two best friends (and she did really), she also appreciated the fact that she didn't have to witness their constant, nauseating displays of affection all the time.
Pansy's sharp blue eyes instantly flicked over to Aria, glaring her into submission until Aria slowly snapped her mouth shut.
"I'm sorry."
"I wasn't making fun of you." He drawled, flicking his mocking gaze back and forth between Bentley and the nervous-looking Gryffindor boy behind him. "I wouldn't even waste my time on pathetic, insignificant
"Most especially Ginny Weasley. I think she was really distraught that you beat her."
"Hmm?" Greg looked up and glanced at her, frowning in confusion at the horrified look on Aria's face.
gasping and inadvertently grabbing onto the nearest thing she could for support. At the same time, Draco's hand automatically shot out and grabbed the exposed skin of her upper arm to steady her just as she had reached for him. It ended up with both of them inadvertently grasping onto each other for balance, both sets of eyes wide and startled as their faces were now much closer than either of them would have liked.
"What?!" Draco rounded on him and snapped. "Are they insane?! That asshole has her name, what if he uses another Feather Curse against her?! What if he tries to cut off her wings again and forces her to mate with him?! Where is she now?!"
"I miss being in Hufflepuff." Hannah whimpered, covering her face and dropping her head down noisily onto the table with a loud 'thunk'.
He pressed her up against the wall, silencing her by leaning in and meeting her parted lips in a searing kiss. She growled and tried to push him off for a bit, but when Draco eased his tongue into her mouth, Aria immediately stopped struggling. Their tongues met, and she hummed in delight and arched up against him, linking her arms around his neck.
"I wasn't planning to. But Aria—"
Luckily, their magic skills weren't all that impressive, and Draco had no problems deflecting their attacks.
over herself.
Another voice spoke up, and Draco, Blaise and Pansy looked up to see Luna Lovegood making her way over towards them. She knelt down on the floor beside Blaise and continued. "They're all under Bentley's hypnosis. It's a vampire moon, after all, so it's logical to assume that his powers are strong enough tonight that he's able to bewitch more people for much longer than he normally could." She explained in a distant voice.
"Whoops, my bad! Sorry about that, Aria. Wasn't watching where I was going." He rushed out.
"It's not my fault! First, Malfoy wouldn't let go of her – and then that bloody tosser Fisher shows up and goes all barkin mad, screaming about how it wasn't his fault and some other rubbish." Ron grumbled, grunting in exertion as he adjusted Aria again and began walking faster.
Aria didn't say anything else, merely turning her head away from him and mulling over his words. After another long moment of silence, she eventually looked up and turned to Blaise again, giving the other Slytherin a curious look.
"It's fine." Neville cut her off with a reassuring smile and firm shake of his head. He offered her a hand to help her with her books. "Besides, I could use a short break from all this studying. Shall we?"

"Then why did you keep my feather?!" She demanded.
"What?" He asked suspiciously.

if he apologizes to Hermione."
The brief amount of small talk they exchanged with each other on their way back to the train station wasn't as uncomfortable or awkward as Draco thought it would be (and he was relieved that she seemed to be taking his 'rejection' much better than he expected); but what he truly found surprising was that the air between them had become much lighter somehow. It was almost as though an invisible weight had been lifted off
Aria's eyes widened and she immediately looked away, ducking back down behind the couch before they noticed her watching them.
"It was
"Speaking of Potter, didn't she give you back your wand? Why are you using a new one?" Blaise suddenly asked, breaking Draco out of his thoughts.
I think. I don't want to ruin that with this veela nonsense." She whispered.
"Zabini, you told me
She didn't know

Aria stiffened at his words and she tried to diffuse the seriousness of the situation with a nervous laugh but Greg went on. "You freed us all from living the kind of life we didn't want. You saved
a prefect so you can tell me if you have any complaints about…certain people and all." He gave Aria a teasing grin before slanting his knowing gaze back to Draco.
"I...see."
When she finally spoke, her voice had become so soft that Draco had to lean in closer to hear her.
He smelled
For some strange reason he couldn't understand, Draco was becoming more and more uncomfortable with the discussion as it went on. He forced himself to listen as Morag raised her hand again and answered Fleur's question.
Aria looked sick as she gasped softly and turned to him with wide, horrified green eyes.
"Alright, I'm back." Blaise interrupted the rest of Smith's carefully crafted insult as he sat back down into his seat and rested an arm against the backrest of Aria's. "One gin and tonic and one scotch neat." He handed Aria and Malfoy their respective drinks before rewarding them all with a mischievous grin.
More importantly, I think I understand now why you would have blended in pretty well with the rest of us had you been originally sorted into Slytherin eight years ago." Pansy chuckled softly and gave Aria an incredulous smirk, like she had trouble believing her own words.
She closed her eyes and threw her head back, flaring her wings wide open and forcing the muscles along her thighs to contract as she rode him faster and fucked him even harder, causing the headboard of the bed to begin banging noisily against the wall. Draco's voice broke as he cried out, his hands bruising her skin as he gripped at her and thrust upwards, desperately trying to match her merciless pace.
"Maybe he wanted people to suspect Draco this time? Just like he wanted people to suspect
"Thank you for that, Blaise." Draco drawled sarcastically, trying not to flinch when he felt a spark of irritation (directed at him, unfortunately) from Aria through their bond. He reached over the side of the bed and grabbed his discarded pants off the floor. "What the hell do you want anyway?"
"That's...quite a list." Pansy whispered, her cheeks white.
Frowning, she and Draco slowly detached themselves from Neville and all three of them began to approach the group cautiously, taking in the strange expressions on everyone's face. When they reached the crowd, they were surprised to see Blaise, Morag, Hannah and Zach among the students who had gathered near the entrance, all four Slytherins frozen with shock.
"Oh grow up, Weasley!" Aria growled at him, giving him a hard shove.
"My wand?" He echoed.
"According to my ancestors, it isn't
At this point, Pansy's eyes were noticeably glassy and there was a tightness in her voice when she spoke.
for one think it's a good idea, Aria." Hermione told her, causing Aria to look up and stare at the other girl in surprise.
"Just 'Draco' will do, I think." He snickered.
"Oh please." Zach let out a derisive snort, crossing his arms and shaking his head at Blaise's antics. "Like you ever had a chance, Zabini."
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and forced himself to continue. "I would know, of course. I learned that the hard way. I was a model son, after all. I followed my father blindly for the first seventeen years of my life, and well, look where that got me."
Aria just gave him another smile.
"Oh come on, Aria. Don't be like that. You don't have to worry, I haven't dealt with something as mundane as blackmail for years." Blaise rewarded her with another smile before he used his wand to levitate a fresh batch of clean dishes into an empty cupboard.

She hung her coat inside the closet beside the entrance and pointed her wand at the ceiling, switching on all of the lights. Afterwards, she flicked her wand again, casting a nice, warming charm around the entire flat. She turned back around and glanced at him, amused to find him staring around the apartment with wide, startled gray eyes.

"Excuse me?!" Skeeter scoffed, rolling her eyes and trying to yank her arm out of Aria's grasp. "I am obligated to do no such thing! Now let go of me—"
"I am

Narcissa sighed again.
He watched as the girl stared at him, blinking a couple of times in disbelief at the audacity of his comment. She scoffed and shook her head at him, but even though she quickly turned her face away, Draco didn't miss the way she was obviously stifling a smile.
She screamed and held on, her hands clutching at the bedcovers to help her stay up on her knees as the impact from his thrusts actually propelled her body forward that she had to press a hand up weakly against the headboard to keep her head from banging against it.
" He scoffed.
She obliged by rolling her eyes and arching an eyebrow at Draco, her lips curling into a disgusted grimace.
"Would it matter?" She countered.
"I didn't join because…Well, I'm not allowed to. My family doesn't want me flying around like that. They said it might be dangerous for someone with my condition." He paused and turned to look at Aria again, his eyes narrowing into an accusing glare. "I assume my sister already told you about my condition, right?"
Unfortunately, by now, the only two unoccupied seats left in the classroom was the one in the far corner beside a group of Ravenclaws and the one beside Pansy. Naturally, Morag made a beeline for the one beside her former housemates, leaving Neville standing awkwardly by the doors as he stared hesitantly at the last remaining seat in the room.
"It's fine, Hermione. I know you didn't." Aria was quick to reassure her, though she couldn't help the mildly irritated look that continued to linger on her face.
"Of course I didn't tell him." Aria snapped, reaching up to pinch the bridge of her nose. "The bloody git has veela genes from his mother, he figured it out pretty easily on his own."
"You want to go drinking
reasoning?!"
"Because we're
"We have heard alarming rumors that a lot of politically influential vampires are trying to convince the Wizengamot to lighten Fisher's sentence. Obviously, we don't want this to happen as it might set a dangerous precedent for other, similar cases involving veelas in the future. So in short, we want you, as the Girl-Who-Lived, to use your political influence and push back against them." She explained.
"We have our first quidditch match against Gryffindor coming up soon." He quipped in a strange, deceptively innocent tone of voice.
"Don't try to turn this around and blame me! I didn't do anything wrong! I mean, what did you expect me to do back there?" He cut her off with an angry, exasperated sigh.
"Were you just…
"Wait!" Draco stepped toward her before he could stop himself, almost reaching for her arm before he managed to stop himself from touching her and lowered his hand back down instead. "It's pretty dark outside. Let me walk you to your door at least. I'd feel guilty letting a lady walk home all by herself at this time of night." He said.
"Where's your ex-boyfriend?" He drawled back, and
Strangely, Aria knew exactly what he meant.
"Ughhh…I think I have to throw up." He croaked.
"Here."
" Draco ignored the affronted expression on her face and purposely slammed his textbook shut, turning to the side to give the short-haired girl an irritated glare. "I don't give a flobberworm's ass about your latest lover's spat with Longbottom, okay?! Stop whining and just leave me the hell out of it!" He snapped.
"We didn't ask for your opinion." She said wryly.
"Are you allowed to drink alcohol inside school premises, Mr. Prefect?" She drawled.
"If you want, I'd be more than happy to help you with your virginity problem." Zach chimed in, winking at her and causing Hannah to glare at him in disgust and Blaise to burst out laughing.
confirmed that she was going to press charges against Bentley Fisher, Ilyana Zabini eventually cleared her throat and opened the floor for questions.
Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let her leave the bed until her wing finished healing, so she had to rely on Ron, Hermione, and Neville to drop by every day to give her the required readings and assignments she missed in her classes.
Aria tried not to wince as she followed Draco up the sloping path from Hogsmeade on their way back to Hogwarts.
"And we stay the hell away from Aria Potter."
Weasley! Stop thinking about that!" Aria snapped at him, blushing darker when Ron ended up laughing even more at the uncomfortable expression on her face. "Ugh…You're so…bleargh! I don't like you without Hermione." She complained.
Hannah was trembling horribly and the petite girl
"Well,
sorry about that." Pansy gave her a sarcastic smile before she sat down gracefully into her seat, oblivious to the way Draco rolled his eyes at her antics as he took the seat between her and Blaise.
They broke apart, looking up and staring in confusion at the sight of a blank-faced Morag waiting behind them. Draco immediately scowled when he saw her and he leveled her with a warning glare.
like that at all! You're putting words in my mouth!"
"I'll go with you." Neville stood up after her.
all at once that Aria let out a sharp gasp and immediately yanked her arm away. She ignored the stunned look on Draco's face and scrambled away from him, curling herself up into a tight, protective ball.
Unfortunately, his movement only seemed to draw Fisher's attention to the fact that Draco was still carrying Aria. All of a sudden, his hysterical blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits as they zeroed in on the arm Draco had wrapped snugly around Aria's waist.
All of the goblets on the Slytherin table began rattling harshly, causing a few of the younger Slytherins to gasp in alarm. It was like a strange magical wave had suddenly swept over them, lingering ominously for a few seconds before the shaking came to an abrupt stop.
She was happy.
Not surprisingly, those last

"Oh don't look so worried, you lot. Like I said, vampires are
"Would that be acceptable to you?!" She asked mockingly.
"Aria…?"
"In my defense," Draco couldn't help the small smirk that forced its way onto his face when he saw her disbelieving look at him. "I didn't expect to be seeing you around – much less being
Draco's eyes were narrowed and a sneer was on his face as he stopped behind Aria's kneeling form, glaring at the two Gryffindor boys hovering over her. When he crouched down slightly to check if Aria was alright, one of the Gryffindors – a 7th year pureblood Draco knew as Bentley Fisher – growled at him and gave him a menacing look.
He chuckled as he, Neville, and Zach all smirked and reached into their collars, holding up the pendant that hung from around their necks. "After you were outed as a veela and nearly half the guys in the hall jumped you, Professor Flitwick started going around and handing out an anti-allure charm to all of the boys in school." He explained.
"No reason." Draco answered him with a lazy shrug before he leaned back against his seat and folded his arms over his chest. "It's just that…I remember the names of all of the quidditch players from each house. But I can't seem to recall you
"To be fair, quidditch might not be the best activity for someone with your condition."
She ignored the rest of Draco's blubbering insults as she slung the robes over her shoulder, pushed past her laughing teammates and finally began trudging across the field to the changing rooms.
"Why do you keep doing that?!" He growled.
"You should have gone easy with the alcohol, Zabini." Draco mused, smirking when he realized that Zach was already passed out and was snoring loudly, half of his entire form sprawled on the table.
To her frustration, Draco seemed perfectly content to continue playing with her breasts for awhile. He squeezed, kneaded, and fondled them with his hands, shifting his mouth from one to the other and eagerly sucking and nibbling on her nipples.
When none of them answered him, Draco sighed.
"I seriously doubt that, Aria."
"Stake through the heart?" Anthony Goldstein pressed.
"And do you think

"Fuck off, Zabini." Pansy snapped at him from where she was lying, exhausted and half-asleep, on the couch, her legs draped comfortably over Neville's lap.
As soon as he was gone, she blinked and turned to stare intently at Pansy. She noticed that Blaise was doing the same, a smug, teasing smirk already on his face as he arched an eyebrow at Pansy's flushed cheeks.
Aria gasped when one of his hands suddenly ran up the back of her thigh and squeezed her ass. Draco smirked at her reaction and tugged on her earlobes with his teeth.
"Anyway, I'll leave you two to it then." Pansy waited until Aria nodded at her before she gave Corey's shoulder one last squeeze and then excused herself, walking out of the empty classroom and closing the door quietly behind her.
I'm really looking forward to writing out the next chapter. I don't want to spoil anything, so all I'm going to say is this — it's the chapter that everyone has probably been waiting for (and no, I'm not talking about the NEWTs or the Yule Ball lol) ;D
Emma pretended to make a face at him.
"Fisher did." Blaise looked grim. "He set the doors on fire right after he went after Aria. Obviously he didn't want any of the teachers following them. Though, if you ask me, he did a pretty good job of making sure they're preoccupied."
"That wasn't what I meant! I just—"
He snapped.
"Sorry, Potter. But we had an agreement after all." Blaise didn't even bother trying to hide the smirk on his face as he reached out and offered her a hand to help her stand up. "Shall we?"
robes that disheveled?! He's a disgrace to all the children of the Sacred Twenty-Eight—"
Her back was turned to him and she was talking animatedly with Hannah, so she didn't notice him at first, but when Draco cleared his throat and both women spun around to face him, Aria's features immediately lit up into a smile.
"Oh hey, Neville." Aria greeted him as she looked up, meeting his nervous gaze. "Where were you this morning?"
the Slytherins involved, she had no choice but to agree.
Wood stood up from his seat and walked back over to stand in front of the table, crossing his arms and leaning the back of his hip against the edge. "You've seen this over and over again in a lot of muggle stories, yes? Of course, muggles tend to romanticize it,
In the blink of an eye, Fleur tucked her wings back behind her shoulders and turned around, her high heels clacking loudly as she walked back to her desk. She motioned with her wand, causing a small piece of chalk to float up into the air and start writing a couple of strange-looking names on the blackboard.
"We are, by no means, as flashy, hedonistic, or as extravagant as popular culture portrays us to be. So not to disappoint you all, but all those books that like to romanticize vampires by portraying us as gorgeous beings who like to spend their immortal lives in broody isolation? I'm sorry, but none of that is true."
Corner shifted his feet a couple of times and stared cautiously at Aria, cowering under her intense, unblinking gaze. Finally, after a long moment, he took a careful step back and the hand he had gripping Pansy's arm loosened, allowing the short-haired girl to pull away from him.
Aria's frown deepened, thinking back to how she had definitely encountered Blaise when he entered the common room after finishing his prefect rounds that night. She remembered that it had been pretty late at the time, definitely past eleven. He had seen her lounging on the couch and given her a sleepy wave before he trudged up the stairs towards the boys' dorm.
She didn't elaborate but Blaise sensed the irritation in her voice anyway and he chuckled, giving her a knowing look.
"W—wait! Don't run at me, just stay still—"
They stared quietly at each other, and Draco took that moment to inspect her appearance.
"Fine, I'll go next." She sighed, helping herself to a couple of fries from the large plate in the center of the table. "You can all call me Aria. I enjoy flying during my free time – it's my absolute favorite thing to do actually. Currently, I live in Islington, London but I actually just bought a flat up in Westminster so I'll be moving there pretty soon. Lastly, I'm hoping to work as an Auror after I graduate Hogwarts."
Draco's robes?" He asked, his lips twitching uncontrollably with barely concealed mirth.
"If you attack them, you'll be giving them exactly what they want. Don't forget, you're still under close watch for good behavior by the Ministry." Blaise reminded him in a quiet, carefully restrained voice.
Though Ron probably didn't need to know that.
The utterly impassive look on Draco's face when he spoke caused both Blaise and Aria to hastily clamp a hand over their mouths in a desperate attempt to keep from laughing.
As it turns out, Corey looked nothing like his older sister.
A few days ago, one columnist had printed a feature about the details of Aria's veela ancestry; and just yesterday, a notoriously disreputable tabloid actually published a list of possible candidates of who they thought would be the most 'acceptable' as Harriah Potter's mate. It was outrageously in-depth, providing a detailed analysis of why each of the 30 bachelors mentioned would be a responsible mate for the Girl-Who-Lived; and the list itself was diverse — ranging from young, up and coming male celebrities, to older, powerful politicians born from traditional pureblood families.
He had wanted her to survive the bloody war.
if he thinks you're sexy, Pans?" Blaise chimed in once he managed to control his laughter, winking at her and flashing Pansy a particularly obnoxious smirk. "I'm sure he'd have something more interesting to say about your 'sexiness' than me or Draco."
"Alright then, Potter."
When Draco gaped at her, completely stunned as to how she arrived at that deduction without him actually saying anything, Narcissa's eyes narrowed and she gave him an accusing glare.
...towards men, tend to cause tension and strife wherever they go. Wouldn't you agree?" She smiled sweetly.
When Aria finally stopped making the bottle shatter and let out an exasperated groan, slumping forward until her forehead hit the table in front of her with a loud 'thunk', Draco snickered and hurriedly slipped back into the 8th year boys' dorm before she noticed him watching her.
She mustn't fight back.
So good, in fact, that within the first few minutes of the match, they caught up to the 50-point lead Slytherin had fairly quickly so that the two teams were eventually neck and neck. Before Draco could come up with an alternative strategy to remedy this, the Gryffindor Beaters – Fisher and Jenson – suddenly took it upon themselves to begin aiming the bludgers directly at Draco, successfully incapacitating him for most of the game. And as he was their team's highest scoring Chaser, the lead between Gryffindor and Slytherin soon widened – a
"Don't you
Draco resisted the urge to glare at her, annoyed at the way she was obviously teasing him.
way?" Blaise asked again, arching an eyebrow at him.
Aria's eyes narrowed and she tried to speak but Draco silenced her with a hard kiss.
It was in that moment that Draco finally resigned himself to a few things.
"Sex on the beach."
Morag smirked back at him. "She always manages to hex me just as I unlock the door though, so I never actually get to see anything good. Unfortunately."
"What were all those pureblood gatherings for anyway?" Aria waved her wand, charming another set of dirty dishes clean.
get right about us vampires is our enhanced strength, speed and agility. In fact,
Flushing with embarrassment, Aria had jumped out of bed and rushed to the shower immediately, emerging messily from it about fifteen minutes later and wrestling herself into her uniform. As she stumbled down the stairs to the Slytherin common room, she was relieved to realize that
He winked at Draco and brushed past him without another word, whistling cheerfully to himself as he strolled over to where the Ravenclaw girls were seated. Ignoring the wide-eyed, admiring stares they gave him, he walked right up to Morag, resting both of his hands down onto her table and bending down low enough so that his face was inches away from hers.
To his utter frustration, Potter's smirk only seemed to widen at his reaction. "Hey,
"I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, Mister Malfoy." She greeted him with a brief smile and motioned him towards the chair in front of her table. "But, if it's alright with you, I'm going to need a bit of your blood. I'll need it for the special salve I'm making to help heal Miss Potter's broken wing." She paused when she saw the look of surprise on Draco's face.
"Jealous, are you?" Blaise smirked at her.
"I'd really like to get through our first potion together without setting off any explosions." He quipped.
"There are two kinds of vampires. The first kind, like myself, are called
Draco didn't dare move.
"Oh come on now, don't you worry about that." Hagrid dismissed her concerns with a wave of his large hand. "I know that the three of you are busy training to be the big, fancy names you'll surely become after you graduate." When she made a face at that, he chuckled and gave her another reassuring pat on the shoulder. "But of course, you're always welcome to visit anytime. Fang misses you, after all."
"Malfoy, stop obsessing over my goddamn tits and kiss me already."
"Malfoy, it's not his fault." Aria was trying desperately to hold in her laughter as she stood back up, dusting the dirt from her skirt. "Maybe next time, you should tell Blaise to stop baiting Neville and Zach into those ridiculous drinking games. I know he was doing that on purpose to get them drunk." She pointed out.
"The trick is to look at the argument from Aria's point of view, darling." She spoke in a calm, soothing voice. "Think about it. Aria can never mate with anyone else ever again. You are 'it' for her; and unless she decides to sever the connection by cutting off her wings, she's bound to you for the rest of her life."
leaving."
Blaise's loud, falsely cheerful voice caused both Aria and Draco to look up just in time to see him flash a wide, suggestive smile at the confused, pig-tailed girl to his right.
Aria noticed that most of the reporters waiting by the doors automatically followed them, trailing closely behind as she, Draco and Blaise made their way out towards the school grounds.
"Neville?! You're in Slytherin too?!" Ron blinked at the other boy, shaking his head when he saw his new robes. "Has the whole bloody world gone mad or have I entered some kind of parallel universe?!"
When Aria smiled back gratefully at her, Madam Pomfrey let out a huff and turned around.
Aria grinned at him and shrugged. "My contractor is a witch too, so I asked her to magically expand the place to make more room." She explained.
The room was also quite spacious, the floors lined with soft, gray carpet, and much like the living room, three of the room's four walls were made entirely of tall glass windows, all of which were partially covered by long, sheer white curtains.
Everything else that happened seemed to become a blur after that.
"Great. Imagine trying to hit on a girl and the minute she shakes your hand, she throws up." Terry Boot muttered loudly to Anthony Goldstein beside him, causing most of the girls to roll their eyes and the boys to snicker under their breath.
crawling nonchalantly across his back.
He frowned and tread quietly towards her, careful not to make any sudden noise or movements.
She fumed silently in her head, remembering the innocent smile on Blaise's face when he had given her the chore list for that day.
"What exactly are you looking for?" She asked, raising an eyebrow at the book he was holding.
This time, their entire group fell completely silent at Neville's words. Even Aria, who up until that point had been disinterested in their conversation, looked up from her plate and arched an eyebrow at him. Zach's eyes were wide and his spoon was frozen halfway to his mouth while Hannah stiffened in her seat, staring uncomfortably at Pansy across the table.
is a very serious request, Potter." She warned, looking alarmed. "One that I sincerely hope you can support, because it'll take a little bit more than the influence of the famous Girl-who-Lived to convince them to agree to something like that. The school board is comprised of a lot of influential people, after all. And you have already risked your reputation by testifying in defense of the Malfoys during the Death Eater trials. Are you certain you want to put your name on the line,
Draco's eyes widened and he opened his mouth to complain but Aria had already run off, heading towards the food cart and purchasing a large order of chocolate-filled churros. A few minutes later, as she was munching on a churro and returned to where Draco was waiting for her, she couldn't help rolling her eyes at the expression on his face.
nice." Blaise pointed out, turning to her and pretending to give her an offended look. "I just said that I'd keep your secret for free, didn't I?"
"Ugh! Seriously, what is wrong with you?!" Pansy seethed at him, her loud voice causing a few of the nearby students from the other tables to glance curiously in their direction.
Aria flicked her gaze over to the green and silver sea of Slytherin supporters, her wide eyes already scouring through the crowd in obvious search of someone.
"You're a
Draco's voice was unusually cold and reserved as he straightened himself back up and stormed off, leaving a wide-eyed Aria staring awkwardly at his retreating back. Unsure of what exactly she had done to piss him off, Aria bit her lip and reluctantly trailed after him, following him through a series of narrow twists and turns through the more densely packed clusters of trees and shrubs of the Forbidden Forest.
Morag rolled her eyes and cut off the rest of Aria's contrite apology with a dismissive wave of her hand.
When Pansy continued to stare at her, her jaw opening and closing like a fish, Aria went on.
Draco reached up to reposition his basket onto his other side. When the back of his hand almost grazed against her cheek, Aria found herself jerking back
To make things even worse, the small group of Ravenclaw students who had witnessed the scene took that opportunity to shake their heads reproachfully at Aria, glaring at her as though she had performed an unforgivable curse right in front of them.
"Aren't we eager?" He teased.
"What are you all doing here?" Draco blurted out when he finally managed to recover from his shock.
left my finger." Draco drawled in a bored tone of voice, growing a little impatient at her questions. "Why are you so interested in this anyway? Do you want one for yourself? Protection against the stalkers in your fan club, maybe?" He sneered at the nonplussed expression on her face and rolled his eyes. "If you want one that badly, I saw a couple of cheap talismans in Knockturn Alley that provide a similar kind of protection. Probably not as strong or comprehensive as mine is but—"
house after all—"
heard of the birds and the bees?" Morag suddenly spoke up, the flat tone of her voice earning another chorus of amused laughter from their housemates.
Aria noticed the smug look on his face and leveled him with a warning glare.
She turned away from him, covering her face with her hands. As he watched her break down, the very last flicker of hope that had been holding Draco's own fragile emotions together gave out.
"All I've ever really wanted is
She was alone in the Slytherin Common Room that afternoon, desperately trying to cram one of the more complicated chapters of her Advanced Potions textbook; all the while trying not to panic when she thought about how the NEWTs were only a couple more days away. Massaging her aching temples, Aria was just about to take a break when the entrance to the common room suddenly slid open, followed by the sound of two students arguing with each other as they approached where Aria was seated.
"They're bloody
around the moon, similar to this, then it is what we call a Vampire Moon. Werewolves are usually terrified to go out during this time, and for good reason. During a Vampire Moon, a vampire's powers and abilities are significantly amplified. In fact, we become almost thrice as strong."
"What are you doing?" Aria deadpanned, arching an eyebrow at him.
"You were
"Well, like I said, he dumped Sŷlleiníea for
"Bloody hell." He muttered under his breath before turning to Aria with a disbelieving scowl. "That was obviously a joke, right?"
There were so many things happening all at once.
Draco deliberately ignored Zach's pathetic attempts to protest and continued, glancing to his left and nodding in acknowledgment at the two bulkiest members of their team. "Our beaters will be Harper Edgeworth and Graham Pritchard."
"Ah, she'll get over it. It's probably that time of the month again, you know how pissy she gets then." He drawled, causing Draco's lips to twitch slightly in amusement. "Anyway, are you headed to the Great Hall? I'm starving."
Aria's cheeks colored. "I wasn't playing with you! I just wanted to know if you really liked me!"
The strange tone in his voice caused both Blaise and Pansy to look up and give him a curious stare. Greg, on the other hand, had gone noticeably still at the mention of Astoria's name, though Draco knew the particular reason for his reaction. He knew that Greg and Astoria had been childhood friends since the two were both in diapers, and more often than not, anyone who said anything negative or defamatory about Astoria was usually the unfortunate recipient of one of Greg's gigantic fists.
too much of me than I'm comfortable with anyway."
"Good luck with practice, you two." Neville looked up from his book again and offered both Blaise and Aria a quick, distracted grin and a lazy thumbs-up.
I will most certainly
Time."
asking me that?"
Aria would have said more, but then she saw Pansy peering uncertainly at her again from over Neville's shoulder. Finally fed up with his girlfriend's antics, Neville rolled his eyes. He ignored Pansy's shrill protests and shoved her forward.
"Yes?"
"Malfoy, what's going on?" With a sigh, Aria crossed her arms over her chest and alternated her suspicious glare back and forth between Draco and Morag. "What the hell did you promise her? And why is she staring at me like that?"
"I—I just—" Pansy sputtered at him, her mouth opening and closing in shock. "I thought you were just trying to be nice to me. And that you just felt guilty over what you said to me in the Great Hall that one time."
Her heart clenched at the hurt look on his face, but before Aria could say anything, Draco managed to force out a sad smile. He shook his head and reached out, taking both of her hands in his.
"I suppose I have no choice then." Pansy grumbled as she reluctantly stood up and walked over to join them. "But if Potter gets us killed for making us chase after her in the Forbidden Forest like a bunch of Gryffindors, then I swear, I'm going to kill her."
and she has the right to make sure that son of a bitch is punished for it! Who cares about whether he's a vampire or she's a veela or any of that rubbish—"
"That would make me look like I'm being a clingy boyfriend." Ron huffed, looking slightly put out.
Sighing in defeat, Aria slowly trudged towards the blond, stopping just a few steps behind him and waiting until Draco turned around and met her gaze. To her annoyance, Draco didn't look at all surprised when he saw her there; alerting Aria to the possibility that Blaise's switch of their chore lists that afternoon may have been a little one-sided on her part.
"Seriously? You're letting me join without even trying out?" Aria chagrinned.
When Aria's eyes narrowed at him in warning, Blaise rewarded her with another wide, all-too-innocent smile.
When the class fell silent and stared expectantly at him, obviously intrigued by his discussion, Wood smiled and went on.
the only male she had accidentally ended up touching without her gloves was
Instead of answering, Blaise ended up cutting him off when he burst into amused laughter.
"Maybe I will."
As Narcissa continued to ramble excitedly, Draco reached up and massaged his temples in exasperation.
"B—but,
"Excuse me?"
"I'm afraid so." Hermione nodded, looking as uncomfortable with the whole idea as Aria felt. "As you know, nearly everyone on the school's board of governors was replaced after the war; and most of them were personally 'recommended' by the Ministry of Magic. They're very anti-Voldemort right now. They're against
"You're right about that." Draco said wryly.
"I was wondering when you two would manage to pull your heads out of your bums and finally get back together. But personally, I'm just glad you two actually bothered to show up instead of going at it all day."
"How about Advanced Ancient Runes?"
Draco arched an eyebrow in surprise at that and briefly slanted his gaze over to Granger, wondering to himself if the reason the Ravenclaw was intentionally holding herself back from answering Fleur's question (and thus being the annoying know-it-all she usually liked to be) was because she was trying to protect her veela best friend.
As soon as the conference was over, she rushed toward him, shoving through the crowd of persistent reporters that blocked her way. When she finally caught up to him, just as he reached the middle of the atrium lobby, Aria spoke.
"Goodbye, Firenze." Aria answered him with a defeated sigh, watching as the blond centaur gave a loud neigh before galloping back towards the darker parts of the forest.
"There are several laws in place meant to protect veelas, yes. But mostly, they are just laws that protect against the usual crimes, including murder, general racism, sexual assault – which, incidentally, cannot be mitigated by the defense of claiming to be under the veela allure." Fleur's eyes narrowed and she shot all the boys in the classroom a warning glare.
"You might want to button your shirt." Draco called out to her in a smug voice, causing Aria to pause briefly by the doorway and reach a hand over her shoulder to flip him off.
"I don't want to assume."
"—is Sŷlleiníea."
to explore, to
"And you're sure that it's going to stay that way forever? Knowing
They worked in harmonious silence for awhile, exchanging a few friendly jibes at each other every now and then until Blaise mentioned something that made Aria pause and stare at him in amused disbelief.
starving! Let's eat!" Ron suddenly blurted out, causing everyone else to jump slightly at his outburst.
"I need to go back to the library, I forgot my notes." He told him. "You can go on ahead without me."
Aria gave them both one last smile before she finally waved her hand over the fireplace, effecively ending the call. She made another dismissive gesture with her hand to negate the silencing charm she placed on herself. Afterwards, she stood up, folllowing Pansy over to where the short-haired girl was cautiously making her way to the bathroom door at the other end of the room.
"You and Zabini really didn't have to help me out back there." She began uncertainly, twiddling her thumbs. "Those girls were annoying but their words weren't really bothering me or anything, especially since I know how archaic their beliefs are. Not a lot of people are particularly accepting of a girl being sexually independent, after all. But still..." She rolled her eyes and nodded curtly.
And to be honest, he was too much of a coward to ask her all of this himself.
Wood ignored the snickers that echoed around the classroom and continued.
"Screw your politics!" Ron raged, and the way his voice rose caused Hannah to jump in alarm. "The fact is, Aria was
Aria rolled her eyes at their antics, sighing as she adjusted her position on the bed and snuggled herself down underneath the warm, thick blankets. After some time, once Ron and Hermione's arguments finally died down, Aria looked up and glanced at Hermione again. When the Ravenclaw gave her a questioning look, Aria reluctantly voiced out what she had been wanting to say ever since they arrived at the hospital wing.
The effect of the Juniper berries must have already gotten into his system, because his arms, legs, and even his facial muscles had already begun to stiffen; and his skin had already darkened into a dull, ugly gray. When Aria stopped directly in front of him, the only parts Fisher seemed to be capable of moving were his eyes.
him to know that.
"If you want."
"That's not funny."
He bounded over towards them, and Draco couldn't help smirking when he saw the slightly drunken gait in his movements. Blaise ignored him and slung an arm around his shoulder, his other hand reaching over and giving Aria's wings an affectionate ruffle.
She winked, causing Pansy to flush darker and give her another scathing glare before she huffed and stomped back over to Neville, swatting him on the head when he continued to stifle his snickers behind his hand.
"By the way—"
To those who continue to wait for updates, thank you so much for your patience and support! Rest assured, I do intend to finish this story so try not to worry if I take longer than usual between updates. ;)
Draco let out a tortured sound as he kissed her back and finally began moving against her.
"We're going to go find Caelum McLaggen." Pansy answered her in a flat, deadpan tone of voice.
"Hi Draco."
"Why the hell are we still talking about sex?!" Hannah finally screamed at all of them in her frustration, her loud, hysterical voice echoing loudly in the Great Hall and causing the students from the three other tables to stare at them in varying degrees of shock, amusement and disbelief.
been better than Gryffindor in terms of teamwork and strategy. Even my old captain, Oliver Wood, used to say so. Of course, it doesn't help that Gryffindors always have this…
When Zach seemed to hesitate and looked reluctant to go into further details, Pansy spoke again, drawing everyone's attention back to the frown on her face. She ignored everyone else's questioning looks, however, and directed her attention solely on Blaise and Draco.
Aria looked annoyed at that but just as she was about to head to the exit of the pub, Draco sighed again and called her back.
"Wait a minute." Draco's eyes widened and, in his panic, he nearly dropped the butterbeer bottle he was holding to the floor. "Potter, you
"Pansy." Draco's eyes narrowed and he leveled her with a warning look. "I know you're hysterical right now, but I'm with Neville on this one. You can't just ask Aria to do something like that—"
She lifted the small basket of muffins in her arms, but she winced and immediately stepped away when she saw the hostile expression on Aria's face.
"Well, I'm tired." Blaise yawned loudly. He leaned back against his seat to do a massive stretch before reaching over to grab a muffin from the basket in the middle of the table.
That same day, over dinner, a grinning Ron Weasley (still green-skinned and all) decided to retaliate by hurling a small, bomb-like package at the Slytherin table. Fortunately, Aria had seen him and deflected the bomb easily, smirking as she levitated it over to the Ravenclaw table instead - dropping it directly in front of Hermione Granger.
"Just so you know, that wasn't an apology." She hissed.
Aria smirked at her and lifted one of her shoulders into a careless half-shrug. "There were a lot more people in my life back then who were on my priority list to be 'hated', so to speak. And the truth is, you weren't exactly important enough to me for me to actively hate you."
"Ah yes. Sunlight." Wood paused as he considered her question. "Sunlight isn't actually lethal to us, but we
He continued to hug Aria tightly against his chest as he set her back down onto her feet, and when he eventually felt his mother, Andromeda, and even Teddy close in and envelope them both in a warm, tight hug, Draco's eyes stung, and he felt his chest constrict with so much heartfelt emotion that he thought it was going to burst.
"He deserved it."
"Do vampires
"I was just remembering something." She admitted quietly.
"You had to ask." Weasley grumbled.
For the first time since the year started, Draco smiled at her and Aria smiled back.
"Ten points to Gryffindor." Fleur nodded again, tapping her long fingernails gently against her arms. "As you know, veelas are quite docile creatures. Despite our physical dexterity and magical strength, it is simply not in a veela's nature to be violent or aggressive. So why do you think these veelas committed such heinous acts back then?" She asked.
"I didn't say anything." She retorted.
Aria summoned two more bottles from the refreshment table, handing one of them to a bewildered Pansy.
then I doubt he's magically powerful enough to hold an Imperius Curse for longer than a few seconds."
She didn't bother waiting for the Gryffindor to respond and was about to push past him when his hand suddenly shot out, grasping her tightly by her upper arm and pulling her back towards him.
She giggled and hummed in agreement, grinding her hips in a circular motion.
Aria didn't get to hear the rest of her redheaded best friend's retort as the doors to the library's entrance slammed shut, cutting off their little banter.
I hope no one was offended by that part with Morag. If you read it correctly, I was actually lauding her character's sexual independence. :D
He wanted to promise her that everything was going to be alright.
Instead of answering, Aria lowered her gaze to her fidgeting hands.
A few hours later into their task, just as Aria and Pansy were about to finish cleaning their last classroom for the evening, Aria was taken back when Pansy broke the comfortable silence by speaking up in a soft, uncharacteristically vulnerable voice.
"And yet, you survived all that and managed to become a saint in everyone's eyes—"
Greg reddened even more at her reaction but he stood his ground and nodded.
to see her again, Draco. Do you think she'd fancy joining us for a cup of tea this week—"
Aria's grin widened.
have a certain
Thankfully, he didn't have to wait much longer because in the distance, he could already see the train coming from London making its way toward the village. The train stopped as it reached the platform, and within a few minutes, a small crowd of passengers began alighting from its doors, exiting the station one by one.
Draco watched as Aria's green eyes went unnaturally wide at his words and all of the blood seemed to drain from her face. She stared at him for a long moment, her expression frozen with horror before she finally snapped out of her stupor and yanked herself away from him, her lips twisting into an angry sneer.
"Draco, it's h—horrible!" Pansy stammered, and Aria noticed how pale she was and the way her eyes were red-rimmed from crying too much. "They think he did it! They all think he's guilty!" She sobbed.
Zabini!" Aria growled at him, shrugging his arm off and stomping hard on his foot.
"I see." Zabini shrugged at her, apparently not having noticed Aria's distraction, and squeezed the hand she had offered him, giving it a firm shake before he let her go and leaned back against his seat. "Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance, Potter. As you probably know, I'm Blaise Zabini but you can call me Blaise."
Aria felt the lingering stares of her housemates on her, obviously waiting for her reaction to Ron's statement but the throbbing in her head was beginning to intensify; and frankly, she was still too exhausted to think properly about everything that happened.
"It's
Aria reddened under Hermione's knowing gaze but she didn't let go of Draco's hand. Instead, she squeezed their fingers tighter together and met both of her best friends' expectant looks with a sheepish smile.
"Shut up, Malfoy."
"Stop it!" Neville snapped again, his eyes narrowing even further at her docile, humiliated expression. "Stop blaming yourself!
don't think Aria's sexy." Neville admitted, ducking his head with a sheepish look. "But I think that's mostly because she's my friend and I just don't see her that way."
were you planning to tell me all this? You know how much I adore that lovely girl." Narcissa's eyes suddenly sparkled with delight. "And she's a veela too, I adore veelas. Think of how lovely my little veela grandchildren will be! Your great-great Aunt Dorea was a veela, you know. Well, I suppose that makes sense, Aria
Whichever one of those was true, it meant one thing.
Despite the fact that Blaise continued to ignore his persistent queries all week about what exactly he knew of Potter's strange behavior this year, Draco still found himself in a pretty good mood for the rest of that morning.
"Stop!" He choked out, gritting his teeth and hastily moving his hips away. "Not yet, you impatient veela!"
"A-ha, I knew I'd find you here."
She met Draco's mocking expression with an accusing look.
"Too many painful memories, I suppose." Her smile faltered slightly and she looked away, avoiding his eyes. "It's not exactly the best place to have a fresh start after the war."
Draco shot back as he stood up and brushed his clothes off. "Of all the asinine – I should have gone on ahead and left you two Gryffindorks when Longbottom started puking his guts out." He complained, his eyes narrowing into a dangerous glare when he saw the small group of Ravenclaws nearby who had witnessed their little tumble snickering at them.
Aria was shaking with laughter by the time Blaise was finished with his story.
When he followed her gaze and saw Aria Potter and the rest of her friends trying – and
"It's a Slytherin thing, trust me. There is no such thing as a good deed that doesn't need to be repaid." Aria cut him off with a firm shake of her head. "And I don't want that. Things are already so
At the look of utter incredulity on Neville's face and the way Ron looked as though he was ready to burst into tears, Aria couldn't help it anymore. The whole situation was beginning to feel more and more ridiculous by the second and before she could stop herself, a snort of poorly muffled laughter escaped her lips.
"Please don't ever say that again."
"Okay, Zach. I think you've had enough to drink." Aria was obviously trying hard not to laugh as she took the empty shot glass from Zach's hand and set it back down onto the table. "You drink any more of that nasty stuff and we'll have to carry out out of here in a stretcher." She teased.
More importantly, Draco knew now that the only reason he pursued her for so long was simply because he was intrigued by the very mystery of her, and obsessing after her the way he did was the only way Draco was able to expend all of the pent-up, fiery energy he usually reserved exclusively for Aria Potter when he was younger.
It wasn't long before the media began to redirect all of the attention towards the veela community as well; and eventually, the Head of Veela Affairs at the Ministry of Magic released a public statement regarding the issue. The statement was painstakingly diplomatic — explaining how they harbored no ill-will towards Harriah Potter for keeping her identity a secret or for the incident with Bentley Fisher; and that the veela community would be more than happy to welcome and accept the Girl-Who-Lived with open arms.
"Oh come on, stop lying. Don't tell me you don't agree with what he said." Draco scoffed at her reaction and looked away. "I
"I am
"Well. It's not like this was unexpected." Hermione mused to Parvati Patil beside her, a knowing look on her face as she stared down at the blue and white scarf that was now wrapped snugly around neck. "The sorting hat
When he finished and turned a page of his notebook, a long slip of parchment suddenly slid out, sliding down to the floor by his shoes. Cursing irritably under his breath, Draco bent down under the table to pick it up, unfolding it and briefly scanning through it.
"Alright, enough with that. Let's assign your new partners for the remainder of the year, shall we?" He chuckled at the chorus of groans he heard from the class and reached over to pick up the roll of parchment from his desk.
"Moving on; the last thing I'd like you all to remember about vampires is one very important weakness we have. And please do take note of this because you can use this information to protect yourself against a hostile vampire in the future. Does anyone know what it is? I'll give you a hint. It's not garlic."
"Pansy." He groaned.
"So a veela has no choice but to do whatever her mate wants? That's terrible." Neville mused out loud, looking horrified at the very idea.
"Why are you staring at me like that?" She asked warily.
Ron. He dumped Sŷlleiníea."
"Excuse me." Draco growled but he was deliberately ignored as the man leaned in even closer to the girl. She made a face and took a step backward from him in disgust.
and she and the rest of the Slytherins were in the library, studying together for their upcoming NEWT exams after the holiday break.
"Get it off me! Get it off me already!" Aria yelled at Greg in growing panic, her face flushed as she tried shaking her leg a few times to get the tarantula off.
"You want me to go to Quidditch tryouts
of a reason to attract everybody's attention? Merlin, why is there always something about you, Potter?" She scoffed.
Aria smiled teasingly at him.
As he growled and reached down to untie himself from the binds, Aria conjured up another wall of blue flames. The flames circled slowly around them, separating them from the others and preventing Fisher from running away. She made a motion with her hand, causing the flames to grow even higher and close in dangerously around them.
"Back of the pub, first door to the right." He answered.
that (if Draco had interpreted her actions correctly), she had actually given him what he could only presume to be her veela name.
Draco nervously moved away when she tried to pinch his cheeks, causing the rest of the Healers around them to laugh.
"Reject the bond."
"No bleeding way—"
Astoria smiled back and took Blaise's offered hand. Just before they left for the dance floor, Blaise suddenly paused and turned to give Luna a hesitant look over his shoulder.
The stunned expression on Hannah's face disappeared instantly. She squealed and practically shoved Morag out of the way so she could peer closer at Aria across the table.
He was just about to claim her lips again when, suddenly, a thundering rumble from somewhere above their heads caused them both to flinch — just seconds before big, fat droplets of rain suddenly came pouring down, drenching their intertwined forms from head to toe. They broke apart, their eyes wide as they stared at each other in stunned surprise.
He averted his gaze and politely looked away, waiting until she collected herself and regained her composure. Her next question, however, caused both of Draco's eyebrows to arch up in surprise.
Unfortunately, her efforts were futile because Draco just smirked at her and grabbed the back of her knees to keep her in place. Then, ignoring the look of trepidation on her face, he spread her legs wide open and bent down, positioning his head directly between her thighs.
However, given the many strange things the git seemed to find amusing these days, Aria was
"I—I didn't—I'm sorry Draco, I just—"
Chair.
Aria gave her a nod of inclination and looked away, staring blankly at a fixed point in the far corner of the classroom.
"A bit arrogant, are we? I'm beginning to understand now why the sorting hat originally wanted to place you in Slytherin." He mused.
"Just shut up, will you?" Aria managed another weary sigh at his antics and reached up to massage her temples in exasperation. "Anyway, what are you doing here and why are you bothering me? I thought I was supposed to be paired with Zach today."
say no, Aria." Blaise interrupted her sharply, giving her another devastatingly handsome smile. "Look, to be honest, I deliberately invited you last because I knew you'd react this way. Longbottom already said yes. So did Smith, Macdougal, and Abbott." He told her smugly.
I wouldn't say I hate you, Pansy."
kiss sometime before the night is over."
"Ron, is that you? Are you with Hermione right now?" Aria asked, confused. "I thought you two were going to spend Christmas separately this year?"
As she stared at Blaise Zabini's smirking face across the table, Aria couldn't help but wonder exactly how beautiful his mother probably was, especially given the fact that Blaise was, undeniably,
One look at the nasty-looking cut above Aria's left eyebrow as she stood back up to help Zach and Ginny to their feet was all it took for Draco's blood to start boiling. As Aria and Ginny bent over to inspect Finch-Fletchey's unconscious form on the ground, Draco signalled impatiently to Madam Hooch for a time out and flew over towards them.
Draco waited for a few seconds for the racing in his heart to calm down before he finally let out the breath he had been holding and looked up, meeting Aria's wide green eyes. When she bit her lip and stared anxiously at him, Draco shrugged and slowly allowed one corner of his lips to quirk upwards into a smug smirk.
The students watching along the bleachers screamed again as Aria collapsed against Draco, her arms automatically moving to wrap themselves around his neck as she struggled to keep from falling off. Draco winced at the harsh impact of her fall but his free arm automatically tightened around her, carefully positioning her so that he was carrying her more securely - bridal-style in his arms – with her head resting against his left arm and her legs draped over his right. His hand accidentally brushed against something behind her left shoulder and Aria winced again, a soft, pained hiss escaping her lips.
"Wood?!"
Just before he left, he cast one last look at Aria, his scrutinizing eyes trailing intently along her injured form. Then, Draco saw something strange in Fisher's expression. It was quick – a barely noticeable glint of red in the middle of the other boy's pupils before it disappeared so quickly that Draco thought he may have imagined the whole thing.
She hadn't realized it at the time, because she was also under the impression that Draco had been trying to kill her when he suddenly started attacking her in that sixth-floor boys' bathroom (and firing a Cruciatus Curse at her, no less) but that look in his eyes should have tipped her off that day. It dawned on her now that, perhaps, the only reason he started attacking her was because he felt just as
"Beautiful."
Much like you are, Malfoy." Morag gave him a look as though she was trying to explain a simple concept to a five-year-old child. "In this day and age, why have only one sexual partner when you can get physical stimulation from many others at the same time? Not only is it more efficient, it's also far more pleasurable in my experience."
She immediately went looking for Draco as soon as she was released from the hospital wing; only for Blaise to tell her that Draco had actually left Hogwarts to stay at his flat in London for the week.
Firenze looked curious at her reaction but then, his gaze eventually drifted over her shoulder and settled on Draco. In contrast to the way he had greeted Aria, however, the centaur's blue eyes hardened and he regarded Draco with a cool, unnerving stare.
"I think we just started on disarming." Corey answered as he leaned back against the backrest of his seat and stifled a yawn. "Though I'm not sure, I was asleep in class." He admitted sheepishly.
Aria's red-rimmed eyes widened in horror as the feather burst into flames.
"I'm sorry too." Draco whispered brokenly as he pulled away and began tracing gentle, soothing kisses along her tear-streaked face. "For
As soon as he was gone, Aria walked over to one of the bleachers nearby and sat down, chuckling as the younger Slytherin let out a loud 'whoop' and began flying in circles around the air. She noticed that Ron had signaled to Ginny that he was taking a break before he walked back over to join her, removing the heavy keeper's helmet off his head.
"By the way, I think it's absolutely

come from a quidditch-inclined family after all, so I kind of have an eye for these things. I doubt anyone else would have noticed."
"I don't want to make you do anything you don't want to do." He admitted softly.
Aria finally looked up from her DADA textbook and stared at the three girls with a dumbfounded look on her face.
Draco didn't reject the bond like she expected him to, but to watch him walk away from her like that was almost just as painful; and Aria finally came to understand why a lot of veelas end up cutting off their wings when rejected by their mates.
Aria managed a humorless laugh at that and looked away.
…but also the same. Does that make sense?" He asked.
"Fuck!" She gasped, reaching her free hand backwards to clutch at his hips and press him tighter against her.
for too long wasn't good for my health, or something like that. Since I have
Draco's eyebrows furrowed angrily at her reaction and he used his free hand to remove her goggles and the protective gear covering her face, tossing them away.
"Is there anyone interesting in here right now?" Michael Corner suddenly asked.
"Sorry, but I don't really like repeat performances." She quipped, deliberately moving away from them and turning back to her books. "Besides, I've definitely had better and you two pretty boys aren't really my type." She added bluntly.
It was obvious that after Blaise's little drunken get-together in Hogsmeade, the relationship between their group had significantly improved. Most of them were actually choosing to spend their study breaks together in the common room now.
P.S. I know that in canon, Harry's paternal grandmother is actually Euphemia Potter and not Dorea Potter but I decided to change it for purposes of this story. No reason really, just a preference ;)
"No! Bloody hell, of course not!" Aria countered angrily, her shoulders slumping in exasperation. "It was just an

Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat, staring intently at his tightly clasped hands on the table.
Draco's eyes narrowed as he studied the expression on her face. He couldn't explain
." Wood answered, winking at her.
"G'morning." She mumbled.
"Don't worry, Aria. If you want, me, Jenson and some of the other guys in Gryffindor can talk to the Headmistress for you. We'll do all we can to get you transferred back to Gryffindor. We'll also tell them all about how this bastard is making you join the quidditch team against your will—"
Draco laughed at her outburst and, very gently, pushed her hair away from her face. He leaned down again to whisper soothingly into her ear.
"So going back to what I was saying about the Chamber of Secrets…" Blaise smirked and deliberately let his voice trail off.
To Draco's further annoyance, Luna just gave him a knowing smile.
"Aria!" Ginny Weasley cried out as she reached them, a look of shock and worry etched clearly all over her face. "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! I didn't realize you were injured, I wouldn't have caught the snitch if I did! I'm so sorry—"
' today, exactly?" He asked cautiously.
"You piece of filth!" Draco spat out as he kicked him again, this time aiming right for his crotch. "If you ever look, touch, or even go anywhere near my girlfriend again, I will kill you, do you understand?!"
The way his fingers squeezed against the burning hot skin of her thigh caused Aria to keen and give out another high-pitched, breathless sound that Draco's entire vision blurred and his mind went blank.
"Morag mentioned that there was also a spell to force a veela in hiding to reveal her true form? Is this also in ancient veelish? Does it work the same way as the Feather Curse?" She asked.
She was forced to stop when they reached the bottom of the stairs that led up to the castle, however, because as soon as she took the first step, she ended up letting out a sharp hiss of pain and had to grasp onto Draco's arm for support.
Aria swallowed slowly and nodded, closing her eyes in defeat.
"Good luck in the game!" Hannah exclaimed, waving enthusiastically at them.
As soon as she was gone, Fleur settled back against her seat, folded her hands primly on the table and met everyone's curious stares with a warm smile.
Pansy ignored him, turning her attention back to Aria.
"When there is a
Draco quickly tore his gaze away from Aria and gave Luna a miffed look. "You don't know anything about me, Lovegood. So why in Merlin's name would you assume that?" He growled.
"Do you like him…?" Hermione asked softly.
Draco's eyes widened in righteous anger at her words.
is the one who hexed those first years into doing it?" Ron blurted out.
Aria tossed his cloak off her shoulders and walked over to him, towering over his seated form on the ground. When Draco froze and stared up at her in confusion, Aria yanked the glasses off her face again before settling herself on top of him, positioning both of her legs on either side of his waist so that she was straddling his lap.
"I don't know, okay?! I wasn't thinking!" Draco finally exploded, cutting off the rest of Pansy's outburst when he growled and crumpled up the parchment in front of him into a tight ball in his fist. "Potter was sitting there and she was watching but she wasn't
"Thank you." She said stiffly.
"Huh?" Draco paused and gave her an irritated look. "What the bloody hell are you on about now, Scar-head?"
Aria rolled her eyes and deliberately ignored them, turning her attention to Luna beside her. She smiled and accepted the bottle of butterbeer Luna offered to her before she took a long sip.
"You called me
The rest of Aria's protests were cut off when Draco took her by the arm and began dragging her along after him. Hermione used a knockback jinx to clear a small path for them through the crowd of reporters and Draco shoved through them, forcing his way towards the exit. When they reached the doors to the Great Hall, a strange, 'whooshing' sound out of nowhere suddenly caused Aria to look up in alarm. She heard another round of screams as most of the students nearby turned to stare at the scene.
To give himself credit, she actually
That fateful day during their Ministry Trial, right after their respective sentences had been announced, Draco remembered exactly how his shoulders had slumped with the first relaxed, shaky breath of air he had taken in
Glancing over at the chasers, she saw how badly Zach kept fumbling nearly every time Austin or Draco tossed him the quaffle. Their beaters, Harper and Graham, were nothing short of efficient and precise as they juggled the bludgers back and forth between them like they were tossing a pair of paper balloons.
He pretended to make a face at her statement, but Aria smirked when she noticed him inching a little away from her on the couch. She leaned back against her seat, watching as Blaise took another sip of firewhiskey before tinkering distractedly with the lid on his flask. After a few minutes of this, she sighed and glanced at him again, giving him a hesitant look.
"That's because I haven't assigned it yet, Miss Granger." McGonagall answered flatly, causing a few poorly muffled groans to echo around the small classroom. "It's due next week, just before the start of class. Minimum is 3 feet of parchment. Be sure to include the information you will be learning today from Instructor Delacour. Oh and do mind your footnotes, please."
"See?" He teased.
Aria blushed as she recalled what happened after Draco had caught her in mid-air.
She opened her mouth to speak but Draco just shook his head and silenced her apology with a soft kiss. When they broke apart for air, he brought the hand she was using to trace the sectumsempra scar to his lips.
"It seemed to be working just fine with Potter last night."
She gave Draco a slightly sheepish look. "That's actually partly my fault. I...sort of...owed Blaise a favor, and in exchange, he asked me to show him where the Chamber of Secrets was and to let him organize a drinking session down there. Unfortunately, he decided to turn his little 'drinking session' into a massive party instead."
"I uh…thanks, I guess." She sighed and wrapped the large cloak tighter around herself, her veela senses purring with satisfaction when she realized how much it smelled like him.
Draco rolled his eyes, scoffing derisively at the smugness he heard in her voice.
—" She turned to shoot another scathing look at Neville before bringing her attention back to Aria. "—I, being the lowly Slytherin I am, would be ever so grateful."
Aria sighed in exhaustion as she loosened her tie and followed Neville down the dungeons toward the Slytherin Common Room. Neville glanced at her from the corner of his eye and gave her a comforting smile.
"What is it this time?"
Draco rolled his eyes at his reaction and stalked off, retracing his steps back to the library in record time. As soon as he found his bag (which was still folded up neatly on top of the table he had been using), he hastened his pace and quickly made his way back to where Corey was waiting for him.

their old, childhood rivalry.
"They weren't that hard to find." Aria smirked as she straightened back up and loomed over him, twirling her wand around in her hand. "Did you really think that I would let you take advantage of me again? You must think
Hermione had plans to spend Christmas with her parents in Paris; and after having been deprived of their company for so long during the war, Aria certainly wasn't about to keep her friend at Hogwarts just for her sake. As always, Ron was going to spend Christmas with the rest of the Weasleys at the Burrow.
"Did you tell him who you really were?" Hermione arched an eyebrow at her.

Draco growled back warningly at him. "
hours of his day searching for something he still had
article about Aria that had been published regarding the whole incident.
Instead of reacting, however, Draco calmly straightened himself back up and did as Burt instructed – he removed the cloak he was wearing. As he placed the expensive cloth slowly onto the counter beside the Daily Prophet, he made sure that Burt got a good view of his forearm. As expected, Burt froze immediately and stared at his Dark Mark in horror before his eyes widened and began flicking back and forth between Draco's sneering face and the copy of the Daily Prophet that was spread out on the table.
Wood walked back to the teacher's table and sank down into his seat.
." Wood answered. "Not every person who is bitten by a vampire will automatically turn into one. Some are just more naturally prone to being infected with vampirism than others."
"Sorry, but I'm going to have to pass this time." Aria walked over to where Blaise was sitting and clamped a hand down hard onto his shoulder. From the way Blaise winced under her tight grip, it wasn't hard to guess that she was probably paying him back for that 'babe' comment. "I'm heading out to London tonight to do some errands." She added.
. A hobby, a job, a goal, and yes, even a person. Luckily, most vampires are able to turn their fixation into something healthy; like an art or a sport or something else that's creative."
"Well then….When you
When she blushed in embarrassment at his comment, Draco relented, "My mother is very traditional about how men should treat women. She drilled so many 'rules' into my head since I was young so it's kind of second nature to me already."
When she scowled at his words and looked away, Blaise smirked at her and continued. "Draco

publish anything that doesn't hold a modicum of truth. I happen to have journalistic integrity."
He couldn't help but take a few seconds to pause at that, shaking his head as he was overcome with a feeling of déjà vu at the familiar scene. After all, it was only a few days ago when Aria, in her true form, had kissed him in the exact same spot he stood now right before she boarded the train back to London.
"Is it just me…or is it incredibly
sensitive when it came to disrespecting women.
As they stumbled onto the ground, thick large vines suddenly sprang out from the dirt underneath Blaise and Draco. The vines coiled themselves tightly around their ankles at first, before crawling up their legs and wrapping around their torso, pinning them on their backs and completely incapacitating them from all movement. Aria made a gesture with her hand and the vines crawled up even higher, twisting themselves very tightly around Blaise and Draco's necks. They gasped for air and struggled desperately to break free.
"First of all, that's
"Aren't you forgetting about that big essay assignment due tomorrow?" Aria pointed out, causing Neville to wince in realization. "I haven't even started on that yet so I have to work on it when we get back."
"You think
like you." She spat out, wincing again when his hand only seemed to tighten even more around her wrist.
"That's a risk I'm willing to take, Headmistress."
"Nobody asked for your opinion, Parkinson!" Ron snapped, his blue eyes flashing as he scowled at her over Aria's shoulder. "Can I murder her, Aria? Please tell me I can murder her. I doubt anyone will miss her that much." He growled loudly.
"I still can't use your robes, Malfoy. That's
." Draco drawled back, and he couldn't help injecting a bit of malice into his voice as he went on. "Though I play as a Chaser now; and our Seeker is actually Potter here. I'm her Captain, by the way."
As a woman, even Aria had to admit that it felt kind of nice to be treated in such a way every now and then.
"You know what? Forget I said anything." Draco caught the brief flicker of hurt on Aria's face before he turned his attention back to Astoria and gave her a well-practiced, charming smile. "Of course I'll go to the Yule Ball with you, Astoria. In fact, it would be my pleasure to accompany you. Oh and please do relay my regards to your father for me." He added.
"Have
"Point taken."
" He gave her a small, reassuring smile.
"It's fine."
Emma winced at her words while everyone else around them chuckled at the memory.
That nothing bad was going to happen anymore.
working for such an esteemed organization as the Wizengamot.
As they neared the village exit, Draco noticed that a large group of drunken, boisterous men were coming from the opposite direction. Ignoring Aria's protests, he instinctively found himself walking around her and gently pushing her to the left so that
"Malfoy, I'm sorry—"
He shifted his attention to Astoria instead, meeting her uncertain expression with a playful smile.
"Alright then, Aria. If that's the way you want to play, then I suppose we can do this your way for now." He jeered.
"Seriously, Zabini! It's not like that—"
"The girl I like is Harriah Potter."
"N—no, it wasn't…It's not that." Aria was quick to reassure him, her shoulders still heaving as she shook her head and managed to give him a comforting smile. "You didn't do anything wrong, it's just…It's too fast. W—we're going too fast." She stammered weakly, biting her lip.
"What's wrong—"
not the one who's getting worked up over a stupid chair, Malfoy." She grinned widely at him, crossing her arms over her chest and purposely leaning back to recline obnoxiously on the armchair's backrest.
"And whose fault is that?" Draco scoffed at her, rolling his eyes at her sheepish expression.
Draco got up first, rising carefully from the ground and dusting the dirt from his robes. When Aria moved to follow him, however, she accidentally stepped on the hem of her robes, nearly stumbling back down against the ground had Draco not reached out and steadied her firmly by her upper arm.
Don't tell me you want us both now? A threesome perhaps? I didn't know you were that kind of girl."
"Is that so?" Draco drawled back, arching a single eyebrow at him and giving him a vicious, taunting sneer. "Well guess what, Fisher. For a beater, your aim is

"Everything's perfect."
the Slytherins were very much unparalleled.
The entire time Draco was home, Lucius hadn't once stepped out of his office
He didn't wait for her to answer as he slammed his book shut and stood up from his seat, angrily shoving all of his belongings into his bag. Then, without another word, Draco stormed off, leaving both of his friends staring after his retreating back in stunned silence.
Draco sighed in defeat.
But eventually, Aria noticed the way Neville would clench his jaw whenever Pansy walked into the common room. Or the way his eyes would narrow ever so slightly in irritation whenever the short-haired girl was in the vicinity. And although Aria didn't know the other girl that well, it wasn't hard to see the way Pansy seemed to be reacting to Neville's presence too, if the way she pursed her lips into an unflattering scowl whenever he passed by was any indication.
"Um. Right." Aria mumbled uncertainly before she turned back to face the front of the classroom.
"These are fucking gorgeous." He murmured, humming in appreciation as he latched onto one of her breasts with his mouth while using his hand to play with the other, languidly massaging the soft, silken mounds of flesh until her nipples peaked from overstimulation and pressed up against his warm palm.
More groans were heard as Fleur chuckled and settled herself onto the chair behind the teacher's desk situated at the front of the room. She and McGonagall shared one last nod before the Headmistress walked briskly out of the classroom, the heels of her boots fading as she disappeared down the corridor.
He tried not to react when he felt more than a couple dozen pairs of wide, curious eyes suddenly flicking to stare at him from nearly every single part of the room. With a sneer, he ignored them and walked calmly across the hall.
Draco ignored her comment and took his wand out of his pocket.
"A lot of things." Aria answered, leaning back against him and lifting her gaze up to stare at the night sky with a pensive look on her face. "I was just thinking about how wonderful this all is. Just...being normal for once. No threat of the war hanging over our heads. No questions of loyalties or prophecies or blood purity tearing people apart from their friends or family."
, of all people. To everyone's astonishment, the match didn't last long — because after a few seconds, Greg winced as Hermione practically crushed his arm back down against the table without so much as batting an eyelash.
When the former Ravenclaw didn't say anything else and instead, chose to engross herself once more in her thick Potions textbook, the confusion on Draco's face slowly transformed into a highly offended scowl.
Ignoring the curious looks Blaise and Pansy were giving him, he dug out a quill, a short roll of parchment from his bag, and quickly ducked over the table to write out his answer.
too highly of yourself." She growled.
seem like Potter had gotten taller. Back in their 6th year, Draco remembered that she had been shorter than Granger and Weasley. Now she was taller than Granger, and almost as tall as Weasley was. Her hair had grown longer too, but instead of keeping it loose and messy like she used to when they were younger, it was pulled back and styled into one very tight braid that ended just above her waist.
"Alright then. Save the best for last." Blaise's amusement faltered when he turned to glance at his friend.
He kissed her before she could answer.
"You were the one who fooled around with someone else, you self-righteous hypocrite!"
"They're
With a defeated sigh, Draco looked up and decided to divert the expectant look on Narcissa's face with a small, wry smile.
His last (and favorite) patient in particular — an elderly witch in her 90s who strongly reminded Draco of his late grandmother — actually cried when he told her that he would be leaving. It was only when he promised to visit her as often as he could that she eventually let him leave the room, but only after he also promised to invite her to his wedding in the future.
Since he was seated on the other end of the table, Draco didn't hear much of their hushed conversation but judging from the nervous way the Ravenclaw kept stammering his words, Draco guessed that the pathetic simp was probably attempting to ask Aria to the Yule Ball — and from the politely disinterested tone of Aria's voice, Draco could also guess that she was probably turning him down. Eventually, the Ravenclaw boy walked away, dejected, and Aria turned back to her books, pretending not to notice the curious looks she was receiving from the other students occupying some of the nearby tables.
As Blaise got up to pay the bill, everyone else stood up from their seats and began pulling on their cloaks. Eventually, they all headed out of the pub and began walking down the road that would eventually lead them back to Hogwarts. Blaise managed to keep Zach upright by letting him hang off his shoulder with one arm while likewise, Morag kept a firm grip on Abbott's arm to support the other girl's balance.
"You should like Slughorn." Zach scoffed at him as he took a sip of his drink.
"Blaise is right, Weasley." Morag spoke again in a more assertive voice, cutting Ron off in the middle of his tirade. "Think about it. Right now, the vampire community is claiming that Fisher wasn't in his right mind that night — because his fixation was Aria, and basically, it was the
"I did tell you that I was very persuasive." Blaise said smugly, a completely unrepentant smirk on his face as he leaned back against his seat and stretched his legs out in front of him. "Oh by the way. Since you were late, I have this special rule." He ignored her confusion and picked up the tall red bottle in front of him, pouring its contents into one of the shot glasses in the middle of the table.
"This is our new dorm room. Feel free to take any bed you like except the one at the very end. That one's mine." Parkinson waited until everyone had entered before she allowed the door to slam shut, causing Hannah Abbott to squeak in fear and practically jump a mile into the air.
"There's nothing wrong with Hufflepuff." Greg pointed out in such a strange tone of voice that both Blaise and Draco arched an eyebrow at him, causing him to redden slightly. "I—it's just that, Astoria told me that she just got resorted into Hufflepuff too." He added, sounding a little defensive.
worried about Malfoy finding out about this? Are you afraid he'll use one of your feathers and make you do something you don't want to—"
Aria didn't return it, however, and instead, she glared angrily at him. Her eyes narrowed even further when she saw the way his shoulders seemed to slump at her reaction.
To keep himself busy (and mostly to stop himself from wallowing in his own misery and bitterness), Draco alternated his time between his remaining schoolwork and his apprenticeship applications. Graduation was just a few more weeks away, after all, and Draco (as well as all of the 7th years and 8th years) were all busy trying to decide on a suitable career to enter after Hogwarts.
"If it is, I haven't heard anything about it from Slughorn yet." Draco told him, shrugging. "Look, why don't we talk about it when recruitment season actually starts alright? For now, I'm bringing you back to the Common Room before Pansy has a cow and starts rampaging through the entire school looking for you."
Aria had refused at first, furious at their audacity for trying to manipulate her; but eventually, when the Board even agreed to wipe the academic records of
She reached up and carefully removed the thick clasp that held her hair up, allowing the long, silky strands to tumble down onto the floor. Draco's eyes narrowed and he felt his pulse rapidly begin to quicken when Aria placed both of her hands on the loose knot of her towel against her chest.
Thankfully, if Hagrid noticed anything about their thoroughly unkempt appearance (or the many suspicious red marks littered along Aria's neck), he said nothing and instead, thanked them both before ushering them off back to Hogwarts.
By now, the smirk on Aria's face had widened considerably and one of her eyebrows had arched up as she gave Pansy a curious look.
Fortunately, they soon forgot about Pansy's hasty departure and everyone turned back to their dinner in relatively amiable silence.
the students from Slytherin house – they found out that the ones responsible for defiling the Great Hall were, in fact, two Slytherin second years named Luca Jones and and Olivert Fernsby. This was confirmed after the Head Boy and Head Girl spearheaded an inspection of everyone's rooms and discovered several opened cans of green, white, silver and black paint stashed in both second year boys' trunks.
"My friends told me that the other houses are pissed at us again for what happened." Zach said, wincing and shaking his head. "Some of them are even talking about asking the board to suspend us from participating in the championship quidditch match tomorrow."
"Bewitchments?" Aria echoed, looking confused.
He knew exactly how to pronounce Aria's veela name now.
to do anything will equally upset the veela community as well. The war had just ended after all, so the newly-formed Ministry of Magic under Kingsley can't exactly afford to go stirring up tension right now, can they? You have to remember that our society is still reeling from the hostile divisions the Dark Lord created during the war."
"Aw…What's wrong? Did I hit a nerve, Malfoy?"
"Everyone is staring at us." Hannah whispered in a hushed voice, her eyes darting around nervously at the other house tables. When none of them said anything and merely scowled in reply, her eyes dawned in realization and she suddenly flicked her wide-eyed gaze to Aria beside her.
"What do you mean by that, Zach?" Hannah asked him worriedly, looking up at him from the book on her lap.
"Nothing." Aria admitted, a little annoyed at the realization that the sorting hat back in first year had apparently judged her without asking her
She was staring at him again, but this time, the weird look on her face was something Draco wasn't sure how to interpret.

Aria continued, staring off into empty space as though she had forgotten he was there. "Your mother was the one Voldemort sent to check up on me. When I woke up in her arms, I remember that the first thought I had was how gentle she was. It felt nice to wake up to a mother's touch for once." She blinked and glanced at him, giving him a strained smile that didn't reach her eyes.
with himself), Aria coughed and awkwardly averted her gaze, pretending to fiddle with her utensils again so as to save him from his embarrassment.
"Come on." He noticed the way she was beginning to shiver and took out his wand, wordlessly casting a charm that conjured up a small, invisible 'umbrella' over their heads to shield them from the rain. "We've gathered enough ingredients. Let's head back to the castle before you catch a cold."

Before Greg could answer, Blaise let out an amused snort while Pansy just rolled her eyes to herself. Draco continued to glare silently at them until Blaise finally sighed and gave him an exasperated look.
"You're really intent on this whole self-deprecating thing this year, aren't you?" She mocked.
"Change?" She asked, arching an eyebrow at him. "What could possibly change by the end of the year, Draco?"

It was Aria's turn to blush this time as she shot Ron a withering glare and glanced quickly over her shoulder, ascertaining for herself that Pansy couldn't hear their conversation.
"Good for you."
"My problem?! I'll tell you what my problem is!" Ron ignored the reactions of the other members of the Gryffindor and Slytherin quidditch teams beginning to gather around them and strode over to the other boy, grabbing him by the front of his robes and roughly hoisting him back to his feet. "My problem is that you can't follow orders, you tosspot! And because of that, you nearly got my best friend killed! You're off the team!" He snapped.

"So you're absolutely set on that huh?"
Pansy winked at Draco before turning back to the new couple.
"Does anyone want a muffin? Longbottom? Aria? It's Pansy's special recipe." He drawled.
When Hannah just blushed darker and Aria responded by stuffing half a treacle tart into her mouth, Blaise glanced at Draco instead. To Aria's dismay, Draco just rolled his eyes and gave Blaise an impassive glare.
annoying – not to mention the fact that you gave me such an inferiority complex when it came to her." She huffed, looking a little sour at the memory.
Draco didn't get to finish his sentence as all the girls hovering near the doors suddenly squealed and scurried back to their seats just before a tall, dark-robed wizard strode into the classroom. He stopped by the teacher's table, placing his bag and a few other stacks of parchment on top of it before he turned around and greeted the class with an annoyingly handsome smile.
"Oh." He looked stunned for a few seconds, blinking at her a couple of times in disbelief before he finally shook the expression away and managed to give her a small, shy smile. "Well, in that case…Please call me Greg."
we going to get a repeat performance of last night, Morag?" He teased in a low, suggestive drawl.
The. Team!" He released his grip on Fisher's robes and shoved him away, causing him to crash into the other members of the Gryffindor team behind him.
The smile on Pansy's face was sarcastic as she met Aria's blazing green eyes from across the room. "I don't know what it is about you. Somehow, you even got my two best friends to like you – Merlin only knows why. But I suppose everyone loves perfect, Princess Potter—"
" Draco shook his head at her. "Your

"Agreed."
He ignored Fisher's pained whimpers and began hurling hex after hex at the other boy's face.
The words reached him, but Draco wasn't sure he heard right. He shook his head in disbelief until Narcissa chuckled and reached across the table again, giving his fingers another comforting squeeze.
Her throat felt strangely parched so she swallowed nervously and licked her lips, trying to ignore the uncomfortable heat she felt building at the back of her neck. With as much self-control as she could muster, she released her vice-like grip on his wrist and pulled sharply away from him, scooting back as far as she could along the bench.
"I'll do that. Thank you, Aria." Blaise grinned at her again and gestured to Pansy Parkinson, who was sitting with Draco Malfoy a few seats away from them. "So…If I may ask, how was your first night in Slytherin? Pansy didn't give you too much of a hard time, did she?" He teased.
Aria was surprised at how good all the decorations looked together under the elaborate lighting scheme the house-elves had set up. The ceiling of the Great Hall was enchanted to look like the sky outside; so the unusually bright light coming from the moon that night added a nice glow around the hall; and it complemented the silvery light that came from the centerpieces on each of the tables around the room.
"S—so all this time—?"
"Oh." Draco's gaze involuntarily flicked to his wand in surprise, belatedly realizing that he had been twirling it around in thought. "Yeah, she returned it to me right after my acquittal at the Ministry trial but for some reason, it stopped working properly for me since then. I had to buy a new one." He admitted.
Aria took a bold step towards him, causing Draco to snap out of his trance and glare at her with a half-warning, half-pleading look in his eyes.
Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley came in first, hand-in-hand, as the ringbearer and flower girl. They were closely followed by the bridesmaids (which consisted of Ginny, Luna, and, surprisingly, Millicent Bulstrode) and the groomsmen (Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, and Percy Weasley). The last pair to enter before the Bride and Groom themselves were George Weasley and Aria, as the Best Man and Maid of Honor. When Ron and Hermione finally entered the reception area and walked through the wedding arch, hand in hand, all of the guests stood up and welcomed them with cheers and a warm round of applause.
Aria heard his unspoken words as clearly as though Ron himself had said them, but she didn't say anything.
. It means, 'All of you, I shall worship and protect.' By speaking these words, the bond is sealed in place."
She waved his apology aside and returned his smile with another dazzling one of her own. "It's good to see you too, Draco. Shall we?"
"What's the matter with you? Are you feeling okay?" Pansy asked again as she reached up and pressed a manicured hand to his forehead. "You
"Of course I can, Miss Granger." Madam Pomfrey answered her in an exasperated tone of voice. "But since she's unmated, it'll take a little bit longer for her wing to heal up properly. Had she been mated, I could have simply whipped up a special salve mixed with a drop of her mate's blood and that broken wing will have healed itself right up in a few hours." Madam Pomfrey said with a disapproving 'tsk'.
Luckily, most of the tabloids seemed to have lost interest in printing ridiculous, outlandish stories about her and had moved on to more recent celebrity scandals (apparently the lead guitarist of the Weird Sisters was photographed in a compromising situation with not one but

McGonagall, however, merely blinked and gave Aria a skeptical look. "And do you have proof?"
second, Aria thought he was actually going to touch her braid but to her relief, he seemed to hesitate at the last minute. Thankfully, the slight pause in his actions allowed her seeker reflexes to react instinctively by snatching his wrist, keeping his hand at bay.
Draco grumbled, using his wand to levitate his basket and make it trail after him. "Let's just get this over with then." He sighed.
Draco scowled at the self-satisfied smile on Morag's face but he accepted her offered hand, giving it a brief shake. When it looked as though she wanted to say something else, he hurriedly tucked the books he held underneath his arm and stalked off without another word.
"No, but this isn't right!" Bentley blurted out again, oblivious to the way Jenson was shaking his head and desperately trying to hold him back as he took another step towards Aria. "You're not supposed to side with those snakes, Aria! You're supposed to be on
"So where did you stop in class, exactly?" She asked.
"It looks like we might actually pull this off after all." She kidded.

She was surprised at how smoothly the press conference went.
for her." Fleur explained, her voice unusually soft.
"Too often." Aria gave him a weary smile but decided not to elaborate.
Unfortunately, the more Draco watched them, the more his jealousy only seemed to intensify; and it wasn't long before the feeling became so strong that it managed to filter through their mate bond. As soon as his feelings reached Aria, she paused in the middle of her conversation with George and stiffened.
"Um. Okay."
"She's been—
Draco chuckled, and his soft, reverent gaze continued to linger over her features.
With an exasperated grumble, Aria turned to him and opened her mouth to answer but before she could say anything, Blaise spoke up again and gave Draco a wide, conspiratorial grin.
"Just thinking."
After accosting Kreacher for their friend's whereabouts and scouring the entire house for the black-haired Gryffindor, they found Aria hiding by herself in the attic.
He caught a whiff of a light, coconut-y shampoo scent, and he hummed, pressing closer until his face was buried against a soft, silky mane of long hair. A few minutes later, when his mind finally began to wake up, Draco realized that he was back in his flat in London.

Aria rolled her eyes at his antics but obliged, closing her eyes and tilting her head back to down the entire shot in a single gulp before slamming the glass back down onto the table. Almost immediately, she felt the alcohol
Blaise and Pansy shouted angrily at him, demanding to know what the hell he was doing but Draco ignored them and gripped his wand even tighter, closing his eyes and muttering a complicated incantation over and over again until a small, circular formation of water began to form. The water eventually formed itself into a magical, protective barrier around them and Draco motioned impatiently for Blaise and Pansy to follow him as they stepped into the fiendfyre and made their way across it towards the doors.
Before either Aria or Neville could say anything else, Pansy shot both former Gryffindors one last hateful sneer and stalked off, grabbing her bag from the table and storming furiously out of the common room.
"Ron." Aria shifted in her seat, looking extremely uncomfortable. "Please don't get into this right now—"
Reluctantly, Draco deposited her into Ron's arms, taking great care to hide her broken wing from everyone else gathered around them. He frowned when Aria gave another muffled hiss of pain at the transfer before slinging her arms around Ron's neck.
"Eventually, I suppose. But Pansy and I just bought a place up in Chelsea, so I'm actually planning to take a short break. We've been thinking of doing some traveling around Europe for awhile. Pansy's even planned out a very detailed 6-month itinerary for our trip already." Neville answered, wincing to himself.
"Gods, I love how you fit so nicely inside me." She purred, circling her hips a few times and causing Draco to let out a strangled sound.
"So…Um…What are your plans after we graduate, Malfoy?" She tried not to wince when she saw the way Draco's eyes flashed with irritation at the utter randomness of her question.
She ignored the indignant glare Draco gave her and went on.
He cut her off and pulled her to him again, wrapping an arm around her waist. Just as he bent her backwards, intent on kissing the smirk off her mouth, they were both startled when one of the doors to their right opened and Blaise walked in, whistling cheerfully to himself as he passed them. When he noticed Draco and Aria, staring at him and frozen in a rather compromising position, his grin turned lecherous.

Suddenly, he was back in the Room of Requirement.
As soon as it was gone, Aria jumped to her feet and rushed forward, slamming the windows shut. When she turned around, she noticed that Pansy was staring at her with wide eyes.
and the sight of her was making Draco so hot and hard that it was quickly becoming painful.
Fleur arched a slender eyebrow and gave him a sharp look. "Is it really that difficult to comprehend? As a man, I'm sure you can understand the kind of temptation it brings – binding a beautiful veela to yourself. One who would be willing to obey your every request, should you wish it. Not to mention how, by becoming a veela's mate, you'd be gaining prolonged life and youth in the process. It's a very tempting image, is it not? Especially for the power-hungry." She answered evenly.
As it turns out, his initial comment of her wearing an 'old lady cloak' couldn't have been further from the truth.

"Have I mentioned how much I love your breasts?" Draco teased as he pulled away, smirking at her aroused expression.

Don't worry, will definitely post the next one within the month, maybe in 2-3 weeks. Maybe even before that if my brain is up to it :)
She leaned over towards him, brushing her lips against his ear.
Draco met her irate expression with a defiant sneer.
They left the empty classroom together, both girls still heavily lost in thought as they retraced their steps back to the Slytherin Common Room. As they turned a corner and passed by the same corridor Aria had found Pansy arguing with Michael, she was startled out of her thoughts when Pansy suddenly spoke.
"As for the Great Hall—"

"It's really not as bad as you think it is—"
"Lose control? What's so wrong about losing control when you're with me?" He demanded.
They were seated around a long wooden table, with Aria, Blaise and Zach huddled on one end and helping each other review for DADA while Pansy, Draco, Neville and Morag were on the other end, quietly outlining their study notes. Every now and then, when she was sure the other Slytherins weren't looking, Aria would look up from her book and glance resignedly at Draco, only for the blond to stare back blankly at her and look away, pretending to busy himself with something in his notebook.
"Bentley." Aria greeted him stiffly.
"I passed."
"Alright then. Since everyone around this bloody table already knows." Aria set her fork back down onto her plate and sighed. "Go ahead and say what you want to say. You've obviously seen

make them stop. She blinked rapidly and reached up, furiously wiping her eyes with the back of her hands. When she tried to look away, she accidentally met Draco's gaze again; but when she saw the way his gray eyes had softened as he stared at her, the last of Aria's restraint over her emotions finally broke down, and she began to cry softly.

if she sees that you're with me."
It was a beautiful, pristine white feather.
"Don't start, Pansy." Draco warned, giving her an exasperated glare.
He shuffled his feet a few times and fidgeted nervously with his collar before he stole another look at his watch, wincing when he realized that he was fifteen minutes too early. After casting a quick, perusing glance around the station, he took his wand out and placed a heating charm over himself, rubbing his gloved hands together in an effort to keep warm.
The blush on the former Hufflepuff girl's cheeks was apparent as she lowered her gaze to the table in embarrassment. "My parents are very traditional and they were very strict about alcohol or any kind of promiscuity while I was growing up, you see. They always warned me about how alcohol would make me lose my wits and that I might end up pregnant or something—"

She continued to watch him with that soft, glassy-eyed look on her face.
"Okay, that's enough." Hermione interrupted them sharply, shaking her head and letting out an irritated sigh. "Honestly, you two. You've been sniping at each other for
"I'll tell you what, Corey. Why don't we settle this like Slytherins do and make a deal?" Aria stifled a smirk when she saw the way Corey's eyes had instantly narrowed at the words 'Slytherin' and 'Deal'.
"I see."
She laughed at his high-pitched whine of complaint and continued to wriggle herself out of his arms. When Draco grumbled and reluctantly released her, Aria rewarded him with a quick peck on the lips before she walked off, hurrying towards her Gryffindor friends.
"—I know you can hear me. You don't want to do this—"
"Is the Chosen One really going to bother fighting me over some no-good, Slytherin bitch like Pansy Parkinson? Wasn't she the one who wanted to turn you over to the Dark Lord? We both know she's not worth it. It's okay, you know. You don't have to help her. I won't tell anyone." He smiled at her, oblivious to the way Pansy flinched at his words.
"Well, first, it is quite painful. A veela's wings are very sensitive, and to cut them off would be as painful as…pulling out each of your fingernails." She paused when nearly everyone in the classroom cringed at the image. "Also, cutting off our wings will significantly weaken our magic. So, quite understandably, a veela will only consider doing this in the most dire of situations. Like, say, when her intended rejects the mate-bond."

The language had sounded too foreign; the accent and intonation of the syllables so unique and unfamiliar to his ears that no matter how hard Draco tried to recreate the sounds, he couldn't enunciate her name the same way she had whispered it to him – at least not without actually reading up on Ancient Veelish first.
me and my family. So I think you can relax about her cursing you in your sleep." He snapped in a low hiss.
Aria finally sighed in defeat and reached a hand up to massage her aching temples.
Aria could tell that Draco was a little drunk, if not tipsy, by his blown pupils and the way he was being more handsy than usual, but she didn't mind. They eventually pulled away before things got too heated, but Aria shivered when she felt Draco's warm hand climb up into her shirt, lazily groping and feeling his way around before eventually settling against her chest with all the smug, self-satisfaction of someone who was so unrepentantly sure of what was

"Once you get past her intimidating demeanor, you'll realize that she's just really shy and insecure." Hermione told her in an admonishing tone of voice.

And plus, her cat, Butterscotch, is the

When she looked uncomfortable at his reaction and tried to push him away again, Draco's eyes narrowed and his arms tightened around her, moving her into a more secure position against him. As she shifted in his arms, the skin of his cheek brushed gently against her forehead, causing her to gasp and Draco to swallow nervously at the way the skin-to-skin contact caused a spark of electricity to course through his entire body.
But she didn't follow him.
"What are we talking about?" She asked, adjusting the scarf around her neck and drawing Draco's attention to the fact that she was wearing her casual winter clothing instead of her school robes.
"You know what? I think I'll pass too." Draco answered distractedly, nodding towards the direction of the doors.
At the sound of Hannah's half-disgusted, half-amused voice, they broke apart instantly. Aria looked horrified as she whirled around, hastily retracting her wings back beneath her shoulders in embarrassment.
"Hello, Mother." He smiled wryly.
Draco hesitated, his fingers curling anxiously around his wand as he debated fiercely with himself whether what he wanted to do was right or not. Unfortunately, the more selfish side of him won because he began reaching into his pocket, pulling out a small slip of parchment. Then, after making sure Aria wasn't looking, he pointed his wand at the parchment and wordlessly copied the symbols on her neck onto it.
"It's not funny, Zabini!"
"Hermione helped me to translate it properly over the summer." Aria whispered, biting back a tortured moan when Draco began sucking at the juncture between her neck and shoulder. "Other than you, she and Ron are the only ones who know my name." She added quietly.
Blaise looked thoughtful for a few seconds, considering her words.
Draco gave a hum of acknowledgment, his fingers tracing the symbols written across her nape.
"I...I..."

"The war is over. Let's not mention things like that anymore."
Her eyes narrowed and she opened her mouth to answer him, but Draco silenced her with a kiss. He placed a possessive hand on her knee, sliding it all the way up her leg and into the slit of her gown. Aria moaned at the physical contact and her eyes fluttered shut as she instantly melted against him. When his hand began climbing scandalously higher along her inner thigh, Aria's eyes widened in panic.
"Aw…And here I thought we were on a first name basis already, Aria. I'd like to think so, especially since I believe you checked me out just now." He teased, giving her a saucy wink.
especially given how Aria already looked completely on edge from all of the constant pressure of studying for their exams.
"Yes, I can." Corey cut her off, turning around to give her a miffed glare. "Aria's actually been helping me with my flying after every DADA tutoring lesson." He told her.
"Because if the perpetuator actually succeeds in cutting off her wings and forcing a bond with a veela, then he becomes her mate. And if only the attacked veela can initiate the criminal proceedings against him, she…
exactly. Because it's cold." Aria agreed, glancing pleadingly over Luna's shoulder at Ron and Hermione, trying to get them to change the subject.
"Not exactly what you had in mind, huh?" He drawled, chuckling.
They continued to stare curiously at each other as though trying to gauge what the other was thinking. Finally, after a long moment, the girl seemed to snap out of her daze when she chuckled nervously and slowly began to gather her things.
"No, I can't. The Headmistress asked me to go to Diagon Alley this afternoon to replenish our stock of a few things." Hagrid answered, shaking his head. "So you be sure to take care out there, alright? And try not to stay out too late. I think there's a big storm comin' tonight." He added worriedly.
Do you have to take this chair too?"
Pansy conceded with a smirk and stepped away from her, though the curious expression lingered on her face.
"I've heard from a lot of sources that your mother is quite an interesting character." She mentioned.
"That's okay." Greg answered hastily, giving her a reassuring look. "I'll wait for you by the refreshment table. Do you want me to get you anything to drink?"
"I see."
She shot Hagrid an apologetic look before reluctantly turning around, arching an eyebrow at the blond scowling petulantly behind her.
"Aria, I really don't think you should get involved in this—"
you know that?" Pansy glared at him, her face twisting into a sneer.
And yet, what drew most of Draco's attention wasn't the fact that a beautiful veela was practically half-naked before his very eyes, but rather, it was the two magnificent white wings that extended from below Aria's shoulders, stretching all the way up to graze against the ceiling.
"Ooooowww, Malfoy, you bloody tosser! That coffee was still hot!" Zach whined as he stood up and reached blindly around the table for a napkin to wipe his face.
After they flew back out to the quidditch pitch and joined the rest of their teammates in the air, Zach's next words caused Aria, Blaise, and the rest of the team to gape at him in alarm.
"Is that...
"That's it?" He asked.
"You're welcome." Blaise answered cheerfully before gesturing to a nearby attendant to bring them another glass of wine. "I picked it up this morning. The jeweler had just finished setting the stone in. It took a bit longer than usual, but then again, your specifications were pretty intricate."
When Draco reddened and tried to hide his embarrassment with a haughty glare, Aria laughed and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
He paused and narrowed his eyes at her, inspecting her appearance from head to toe. "Don't tell me you've been suppressing your true form since the year started? You really shouldn't do that, Potter."

Without warning, Aria yanked off the glove on one of her hands and slapped him,
"It's not that simple, Potter!" Pansy snapped back, looking annoyed at her instantaneous reaction.

To a half-blood, no less! It would be a
"Five days." He answered, yawning and leaning back tiredly against the backrest of his chair. "It's not your fault, though. Madam Pomfrey kept you knocked out with a sleeping draught. She said she wanted to see if your veela magic would be capable of healing your wing."
"Just pick the damn thing up already! You're a big guy, you can take it!" Aria shrieked at him, her eyes widening in horror as she watched the spider beginning to crawl up her leg.
of all people, she would have probably had that person sent to St. Mungo's for a psychological evaluation.
"So…Any more common misconceptions?" Fleur briefly checked her watch before turning her attention back to the class. "I believe I still have time to answer a few more questions."
Of course, it was only a gut feeling; Aria knew that.
Hey—"
"I'm just saying." Aria laughed and held both of her hands up at them in a gesture of surrender. "You're in Paris! City of Love, and all that rubbish. Go and have fun. But not
He frowned when he realized that Aria wasn't properly attired in their quidditch robes and gestured briefly to Harper behind him. He waited patiently as the other boy ran off towards the locker rooms before returning a few seconds later, a dark green quidditch uniform in his hands.
"No. I guess you're not." She agreed, hesitantly reaching up to wrap her arms around his neck. "I mean, you
"You saved me, you know." He cut her off as he leaned in close to whisper into her ear, invading her personal space. "During the battle here at Hogwarts, you
you, darling."
"It's nothing." He hurriedly replied, looking away to avoid them pressing him with more questions.
He had already turned around and walked a good distance away from her when Aria suddenly surprised herself by rudely pushing past the crowd of chattering witches around her. She ignored their affronted protests and broke out into a run, weaving her way through the busy sea of Ministry officials walking past the hallway of the atrium lobby. When she finally reached Draco, he was already stepping into one of the floo exits; and in a desperate bid to make him stay, she stopped directly behind him and blurted out what she wanted to say all along.
Aria gritted her teeth and silently counted to ten in her head, fighting the ridiculous urge to take out her wand and cast a particularly nasty bat bogey hex at Pansy across the room.
"Fortunately, in

"Or what?" He challenged, smirking. "Are you going to hex me?"
be resorted." She repeated.
Fortunately, Neville picked up on her body language immediately as he reached out and grabbed Aria by the shoulder, forcing her to sit back down. Irritated, Aria growled under her breath and was just about to snap at Pansy instead when, to her surprise, she noticed that Malfoy had drawn Pansy's attention when he snatched her by the arm and turned her so that the short-haired girl could see his warning glare.
"I think you're
him, causing Neville to choke back a startled laugh as his arms immediately went to wrap around her waist to keep himself steady.
"Presumably because we're the two idiots who decided to kiss in the middle of a busy street?"
Draco flushed at his words and leveled him with a deadpan glare.
"I'll keep that in mind."
They were dismissed soon after that and Aria sighed in relief as she stood up and began gathering her things back into her bag. Just as she was about to follow Neville to the Great Hall for lunch, a tall figure stepped deliberately into her path, blocking her way.
She rolled her eyes when she saw the way Ron just nodded dumbly in agreement and gestured impatiently for him to sit in the chair beside her. When he managed to do so after shaking himself from his dazed staring, Hermione pulled out a pen and notebook from her bag. The black-haired Gryffindor just stared curiously at her as Hermione gave her an expectant look and leaned back calmly against her seat.

"I'll be sure to help you 'practice' then." He teased.
"Take your filthy hands off me, you disgusting lecher!" The girl snapped angrily as she shrugged the heavy arm off her shoulders and shoved the man away. Unfortunately, that didn't seem to deter him at all and it only made him grab her arm and pull her against him with another drunken leer.
seat you're sitting in. Get out." He growled.
She sighed and opened her mouth to speak but Draco shook his head and cut her off before she could say anything.
There was a shaky quality to her voice when she tore her gaze away from his and stared intently down at the table.
For once, I actually agree with Malfoy and Zabini on this one. You should stay the hell away from him."
"Are there any veela
Aria reached for his hand again but he pulled away.
"—it's...
Surprisingly, through the combined efforts of all the house prefects and the Hogwarts faculty, the investigation was resolved in a matter of days and the culprits responsible were identified.

Draco stared intently at her, struggling to form the correct words inside his head. He eventually gave up when he realized that it was nearly impossible to think clearly while Aria was staring up at him with those big green eyes of hers like that, so he ended up blurting out the first thing that came to his mind.
for that."
"It wasn't Aria's fault though." Ron suddenly chimed in, crossing his arms as he sat down onto one of the wooden stools near the edge of the bed. "Some stupid bloke hit her with a bludger during the quidditch match. She actually fell off her broom—"
"I heard that a veela cannot fully control her allure. Isn't that dangerous? Not just for her but for everyone else around her?" Padma Patil mentioned with a slight frown.
"Merlin's pants, I am
As soon as the words reached Aria's ears, all of the blood rushed out of her face. Her eyes widened and she stared helplessly up at Draco's worried features as her entire form was suddenly encased in a bright, yellowish glow.
"Veritaserum, yes." Aria answered, grinning slyly at him. "I switched the drinks when you weren't looking."
"What's your favorite color, Malfoy?"
on her shoulder, causing Aria to let out a pained cry. He lapped at the bite in apology for a bit, licking up the blood before he finally moved down to her breasts, burying his face between them with a lascivious grin and inhaling her scent.
"Screw you, Ernie. I'm done with you. This is over!"
"I wonder who did it." Hannah thought out loud as she suddenly brought her textbook to her chest, hugging it tightly before leaning back to stare at the ceiling. "I mean, it couldn't have been
I dream about you all the time." He smiled at her again but this time, the maniacal, hero-worship in his eyes was enough to make Aria frown and tug her hand roughly away from his grasp.
When Aria giggled and turned around to say something to Finnigan behind her, Draco's eyes narrowed and he felt a particularly unpleasant stab somewhere in his gut. He wasn't sure why exactly, but the more he watched Aria laughing and smiling so casually with her friends, the more he felt irrationally
Draco looked grim as he answered. "I didn't see who it was."
"Besides,
Draco smirked again as he reached up and gently chucked her chin, using the same gesture to tilt her head up so that he could see her face. She followed his pointed gaze to the entrance of the cave, her eyes widening slightly when she realized what he was staring at.
And lastly, though Aria was reluctant to admit it, Blaise's skill as a keeper was easily on par with Ron's.
different people who were from
Draco smirked at him.
Draco's jaw tightened in annoyance at the petty jibe but he refused to acknowledge them. Instead, he turned to Corey, giving him another conspiratorial grin.
Unfortunately, before she could call the other girl out on it, Blaise reached over and distracted Aria by slinging an arm around her shoulders. Though, it didn't escape Aria's attention that Blaise was careful not to place any weight on her injured wing.
Blaise looked amused at the surprised expression on her face. "Before he left, he actually threw another bitch fit and chewed both mine and Pansy's ears off for not telling him sooner."
If I have to get along with this git, then I can be nice. But
"Oh haha." Aria reached over and swatted lightly at his head. "Who would have known that being sorted into Slytherin would make you so cute and witty, Longbottom?"
Aria leaned down closer towards Corey so that she could study the look in his eyes. "The other students, the ones before you, do you recall if they ever mentioned seeing Draco before they blacked out?"
He just never really had a reason to admit that to himself; or to believe that Potter would ever reciprocate his feelings.
He was panting harshly; and the sight of his disheveled blond hair, his flushed cheeks and bruised lips, and the expression on his face — a mixture of sex-drunk euphoria and exhaustion — was almost enough to make Aria want to jump him all over again.
a request cannot be indefinite; in other words, it must have a specified period of time.
"Oh, so you think you're so much better than me now?! You little bitch—"
She smiled and gave his hand another squeeze in reply before she straightened, her eyes flicking over his shoulder towards the exit.
"What is going
look helplessly unsettled being around her three new housemates.
"It's okay. You don't have to say anything."
She froze at the urgency she heard in his voice and turned around slowly, staring back at him in confusion. Draco swallowed the dry, painful lump that had formed in his throat and gave her a slightly exasperated smile.
"That happy to be chore partners with me for this week, are you?" Blaise was smirking when she looked up and met his teasing gaze. "I didn't know you liked me that way, Potter."
"My name—"
"I know, I know! I promised I would tell him and I really
Fiendfyre was rapidly spreading along the floor, crawling past several tables as it made its way toward the walls. By then, all of the reporters and photographers had left and around him, Draco watched as hordes of panicking students tried to make their way past the fiendfyre that was currently blocking all of the exit points of the Great Hall.
life, Draco. And we don't owe them
"Potter would sooner jump into the lake than do something like that, Pansy. You're fine. Now let go of me!" Draco scoffed as he yanked his sleeve away from her in irritation.
Smirking to himself, Draco was already making his way towards her when, to his annoyance, Hannah suddenly grabbed Aria by the wrist and whisked her off to the opposite side of the room. He was just deciding on whether or not he should even attempt to go after them when Neville suddenly appeared beside him, drawing his attention by nudging him lightly on the shoulder.
"—why aren't
McGonagall's eyes narrowed and she frowned again, leveling Aria with a grave look.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bentley scoffed bitterly to himself. "What do you see in this guy anyway? Can't you see that this spineless piece of filth isn't right for someone like you?! If you can't even trust him with your veela name, then you can't trust him with anything else! He's not worthy of you, Aria! Not a single strand of your head! And every time I see him touch you, my blood boils!" He spat out.
Aria closed her eyes and turned around, wrapping her arms protectively around herself.
"Luna
"Fair enough."
From personal experience, Aria knew that he was usually the mastermind in all of the other Slytherins' underhanded schemes after all. So if he was involved, was he the one who told Blaise or Pansy to do it?
There were a lot more annoyingly personal questions that followed (most of which seemed to focus on her being re-sorted into the former House of the Dark Lord and reporters asking her how she felt about the whole thing) but thankfully, she was able to navigate her way through it all with a few well-practiced quips and fake smiles. After a few more minutes of justifying to a ditzy columnist from Witch Weekly
To their credit, Bill and Fleur (but Draco didn't really count her as a Weasley anyway) were actually quite pleasant to talk to; and Charlie mostly kept to himself (when he wasn't talking about dragons), so Draco didn't really mind their company. It was Percy and his wife Penelope whom Draco found insufferable with all their negative sentiments against him and his family, followed closely by Ginny (who still liked to poke fun at him and called him a slimy ferret whenever Aria wasn't looking).
"I don't know why women make such a big deal about weddings anyway." Morag pointed out, rolling her eyes as she leaned back against her seat and crossed her legs. "It's such an outdated concept."
She giggled at his aghast expression and went on as though he hadn't spoken. "I understand, you know. Like I said, it's okay. If I had to lose to another girl, it may as well be Harriah Potter. And believe me, you have
to sit at the Gryffindor table without you two there. I'm all alone now, you two
At the authoritative tone of Draco's voice, all of the 8th years and 7th years looked up, watching as Draco stopped in front of Pansy and stared down at her seated form with a serious look on his face.
"Since the war ended, I also noticed how the Ministry has been instigating this whole
"Y—you're right, I'm sorry. I'm just nervous." Zach admitted, wincing as he reached up and wiped the sweat off his face with the back of his hand.
So it was actually a miracle in itself when Aria managed to wake up at seven after her first night in the dungeons. Despite her best efforts, she was shocked to realize that both Pansy
He ignored her embarrassed protests and yanked her legs apart, leaning down and pressing a reassuring kiss onto the skin of her inner thigh. Then, without warning, he bent down and slowly gave her a curious lick, pausing for a few seconds afterwards to gauge her reaction. When Aria bit her lip but otherwise made no move to stop him, he pressed his mouth closer and inhaled the heady scent of her.
"But don't worry, Aria. I'll spend the entirety of this year protecting you and making sure those Slytherins know their place. I won't let any of them touch you." He declared wholeheartedly, his unnervingly blue eyes gleaming with something Aria didn't quite understand.
He also knew that she had absolutely nothing to do with Draco's problems, but he couldn't seem to help it. It was just so much easier to blame everything on her. The frustration he had been bottling up for the past few weeks had finally reached its tipping point so it was all just spilling out; and all he could do in that moment was redirect it at the nearest person who could probably handle his wrath.
She stifled a groan and, very discreetly, shuffled away from him. Unfortunately, Draco seemed to have picked up on her reaction anyway because he arched an eyebrow at her, one corner of his lips quirking upwards into a smirk.
The day after that, during the NEWT exam for Arithmancy, Draco saw Hannah hyperventilating and having a panic attack of her own outside the entrance doors of the Great Hall. Luckily, Pansy and Neville were with her and managed to calm her down before the actual exam started — nevermind the fact that Neville didn't really look all that good either. In the days leading up to his Herbology NEWT, Neville had actually taken to ignoring everyone and walked around with a thick, enchanted earmuff on his ears, repeatedly muttering all of the notes he was trying to memorize under his breath.
"And I wonder how
am I acting like a Slytherin?!" Aria retorted, her left eye twitching in annoyance.
"Who is it, Hermione?" Ron asked, looking concerned at the sudden uneasiness in her voice.
"Keep dreaming, Snake
"I won't argue with that." He murmured, smirking as he took another languid sip of his wine.
As Aria's sharp, veela claws closed tightly around her throat, Pansy wheezed for breath and she struggled desperately to break free. In spite of Pansy's efforts, Aria just lifted her up and slammed her violently against the trunk of the tall tree behind her.
As always, reviews, comments and kudos are love! Not much longer till we reach the resolution to this story. :D
Draco blushed under their beaming smiles and grumbled to himself before averting his gaze. "Obviously, it can't be this weekend since we'll be in France to attend the wedding of her two best friends and it wouldn't be right to ask her then; but...

"You've never had someone do this for you before?" He asked, arching an eyebrow at her embarrassed expression.

"It was

Aria's eyes widened but she didn't protest, simply lying back down obediently against the sheets and parting her legs. Draco licked his lips, staring hungrily at the luscious sight before him for a long time before he smirked and slowly bent his head, positioning himself between her thighs.

"We were with Greg and Astoria in the library. They needed help answering their assignment for Potions." Draco answered, stabbing his fork into the food on his plate.
"You don't look that happy to see me, Potter." Draco pointed out, snickering at her.
"You didn't shag him already did you?" Ron asked bluntly, turning green.
The expression on Draco's face was particularly pretentious as he turned his attention to Aria, meeting her deadpan glare with a wide, obnoxious smile.
"Here are our class schedules and chore assignments for the week. I would have handed it to you earlier but apparently, you couldn't be bothered from your beauty sleep this morning." She said snidely.
"I'm going to ride you and fuck you all night until you can't see straight." She purred.
Aria wanted to tease him a bit more but Blaise made a dismissive gesture with his hand and hastily changed the topic.
"No."
"Is that so? What position do you play then?" Draco smirked, surprising everyone else with his sudden interest in the conversation.
"So then why—"
"Why are you staring at me like that?" She snapped.
"I do."
"Okay, seriously.
"I said she was
Pansy nodded in understanding but she didn't say anything else, watching as Aria cast a cleaning charm on the last desk nearest the doors before they both moved on to the next classroom along the hallway. As they entered and Pansy set off to work on dusting the cabinets, Aria turned to her and spoke again.
her to react or do anything against the fact that another girl was asking him out. When Aria stared back calmly at him, not at all looking like she was planning to intervene, his eyes narrowed and he felt a rush of bitterness welling up in his chest.
"Then why don't you live there?"
you?"
"Well, yeah. What do you expect me to do? Drag this whole thing out and make you crawl on your knees, begging me for mercy?" Aria rolled her eyes and laughed at the disbelieving scowl on his face. "I mean, it
Aria grinned at him and opened her mouth, ready to snipe him with another witty retort when she suddenly froze up, recognizing the familiar, creepy sensation she felt tingling at the back of her neck. Instead of looking up to search for the source of her discomfort, however, she frowned and lowered her gaze, knowing full well that she would most likely just see Bentley Fisher staring at her again.
Wracking her brain, Aria recalled that the last time she had interacted with Blaise Zabini was back in their 6th year during her regular Slug Club meetings with Slughorn and a few other
Neville reached up to scratch the back of his head and managed a sheepish, uncomfortable laugh. "I'd
"Don't be ridiculous!" Draco tried to sneer at her, though given the blush on his cheeks, he was pretty sure that it didn't have its intended effect. "I'm not afraid of a couple of stupid hippogriffs! Let's get going already!"
Pansy sneered at her before turning back to Hannah and giving her a comforting pat on the shoulder. "I wouldn't listen to Potter if I were you, Hannah. She's not exactly
Draco and Blaise both watched in horror as Pansy's face turned purple and her eyes began to roll to the back of her head.
"Isn't that nice? She's becoming more and more of a Slytherin everyday. Just a little bit more and she'll be just as scary as Potter, just as bitchy as Pansy and just as much of a nymphomaniac as Morag." Blaise ignored the glares he got from Pansy, Aria,
"Like I could care less what everyone thinks of me, they already hate me anyway. Now let me go, Michael!" Pansy grimaced at his roughness and resumed her attempts to wrestle herself away from him. "Let me go, you're really starting to hurt me!"
"A spot's just opened up on the team for the position of Chaser. Do you think you're up for it?" She called out, ignoring the incessant flashing of the cameras from all the reporters who were watching the scene.
A loud, blaring ring suddenly caused everyone to look up.
"Close friend, boyfriend, lover—" Draco grinned when he saw the way her nose wrinkled cutely with distaste at the word 'lover'. "—and maybe,
He swallowed audibly as the Veritaserum slowly took effect, forcing him to answer.
"Yeah, it's not a problem." Corey answered him with a careless shrug and made his way over to a small wooden bench that was situated along the perimeter of an adjacent courtyard. "I'll just wait over here until you get back." He added.
It took more than a few hours, and most of the Slytherins ended up having to spend their entire day doing nothing but clean, but somehow, they were able to remove all of the offensive drawings, phrases, and even all the green and silver paint that had been splattered haphazardly around all four walls of the Great Hall.
"Where were you, Hermione?" Aria asked as she looked up and gave her a questioning look. "Ron mentioned that you had something to do this morning."
"You promise?"
Groaning under his breath, Draco ignored the pain in his back and sat up slowly, watching as Bentley and Jenson finally managed to blink themselves out of their weird trance and scrambled back to their feet. The two Gryffindors looked confused as they stared questioningly at each other for a few seconds before turning their befuddled looks to Aria's hunched, hostile figure still curled on the ground.
"You can have the seat back, Malfoy." She added after a moment, backing slowly away from him.
think that you don't have any redeeming qualities. On the contrary, I actually really like the way you're so protective and nurturing - even if you probably don't want people to know that." He added, chuckling.
"Besides," He added, pausing as he suddenly smirked and gave both Slytherins a smug look. "Among the four of us here, which of us do you think everyone else would be willing to believe actually tried to hurt Harriah Potter? Us, Gryffindors? Or you two,
Aria opened her eyes and sat up again, propping herself up on her elbows. She met his languorous gaze and smirked back at him in challenge.
The next morning at breakfast, a large, unfamiliar white owl swooped into the Great Hall and made a beeline for the Slytherin table, depositing a small envelope in front of Draco's plate.
Aria heard Corey's sob of relief beside her before McGonagall continued.
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter." Draco retorted, his cheeks immediately flushing with embarrassment when he realized the implications of what he had said.
Suddenly, Aria felt a familiar, prickling sensation at the back of her neck and she stiffened, bringing her eyes back up and glancing around the room. As her gaze skimmed over the Gryffindor table again, she was met with a pair of dark blue eyes staring right back at her.

Most of the Slytherins (excluding Blaise and Pansy, since the two of them were pretty much used to Draco's outbursts by now) had averted their eyes from both him
"My life is
Aria couldn't help giggling at Blaise's bemused expression.
"I have my reasons." Aria tried not to blush under Pansy's scrutinizing stare and looked away. "And besides, the less people who know about this, the better. So keep your damn mouth shut, Parkinson."
Her veela senses went crazy under all of his touches, and Aria covered her face with her hands when she realized that she was already so incredibly wet between her legs. She began to shimmer, her true form fighting desperately to release itself from her control as her wings itched to break through the skin of her back.

"Honestly?" Aria ignored his halfhearted protests and turned to glare at him, a frown marring her features. "I think I'd prefer it if you actually
He was actually going to see her again.
before all this! I had absolutely no reason to trust you or your intentions! And you certainly proved that to be the case, didn't you?"
"Juniper berries, Instructor."
While Hannah was blushing under everyone's expectant looks, Aria chanced a look at Blaise, watching as he glared reproachfully at Draco from the corner of his eye. The blond boy just arched an eyebrow and shrugged at him, obviously unconcerned with Blaise's efforts to keep things civil.
The longer he stared at her beautiful face, the more Draco couldn't help himself; until he eventually gave in and pressed another quick kiss against her smiling lips.
reason I agreed to meet you tonight was actually because…I wanted to tell you something."
As soon as the large group had gone, Aria turned to a sleepy-looking, pajama-clad Draco just as he entered the living area, a thick, green blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He sat down into his favorite armchair, a steaming cup of coffee in his hands, and fixed his narrowed-eyed stare at the closed, common room entrance.
"Consent to
for the second incident."
"Witches like Merope Gaunt, you mean?" Aria arched an eyebrow.
"I'll assume that most of you have done your research. Can anyone venture a guess as to what I've written down on the board just now?" She asked.
That did it.
To be fair, she

"How about that kid over there?"
The drawn out syllables left his lips in a way that vaguely reminded Draco of parseltongue, and he couldn't help but smirk at how oddly fitting it was.

your veela name, by the way?"
Satisfied, the ghost acknowledged her with a quick nod and continued the rest of his lecture.
Draco was already
And this time, instead of sneering at her and trying to draw her in with another ridiculous speech about family names, pureblood superiority, wrong associations and whatnot, Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and simply offered her another shy smile.
He was just about to comment to Blaise about it when he noticed that Potter was staring at him again. Frowning, Draco's attention was finally drawn to her robes – which, he noticed for the first time, were now accentuated with the same green and silver colors as his own.
students. The only thing Aria could seem to remember about Blaise from those times, however, was how Slughorn had often referred to Blaise's mother during their conversations as being a very beautiful witch who had already gone through quite a number of rich, influential husbands.
That has to be joke. You can't be their new seeker." Bentley ignored the way Jenson was nudging him in warning and took another step towards Aria, encroaching intrusively into her personal space.
"I wouldn't worry so much about that." Emma cajoled lightly as she walked past him on her way to her first patient. "We've all seen how hard you've worked and studied in between your shifts these last two years, so we're absolutely sure you passed."
that first time." She gave Pansy a pointed look, suddenly calling to mind how she had suspected Pansy as being responsible for the first incident. Then, she frowned and glanced over Pansy's shoulder to stare at Blaise.
"Don't be ridiculous." Draco answered calmly, slanting his eyes across the table at Hannah and giving her a sneer. "Pansy and I are not together. I'd rather you don't go around spreading such nonsense."
"Congratulations? When's the wedding?" He smirked.
need blood to survive? And does it have to be human blood in particular? Or can you live off the blood of animals?" She asked.
The rest of her protests dissolved into a startled giggle when Draco suddenly hoisted her up into his arms, smirking as he hauled her towards the bedroom.
McGonagall gestured them towards the doors and the four of them hurried out of the office in silence, rushing down the Gargoyle Staircase and heading back out into the school's corridors.
"I didn't really think much about it." He admitted.
"And you've never taken that ring off? Not even
They spent the next couple of hours in harmonious silence, both of them working diligently through their list of ingredients with impressive speed.

attractive.
Pansy blushed at that, quickly lowering her gaze to avoid meeting the fond, knowing smile Neville had given her at Morag's comment. Instead of answering, she grabbed Hannah by her arm and lifted her out of her seat.
On the contrary, if it wasn't for Aria Potter speaking up for him and his mother during their Ministry Trial a few weeks ago, Draco was certain that his entire family would probably be rotting away in Azkaban by now. Instead, thanks to Potter's carefully worded testimony, he and his mother were actually the only ones to walk away somewhat exonerated from this whole 'Death Eater' ordeal, their only punishments being mandatory community service.
who was adamant about him learning more about DADA.
"It's not that bad, Neville." Aria grimaced in spite of herself and tried to console him with a light nudge. "I mean, look at it this way. Since everyone's been resorted, there's a good chance that our new Slytherin housemates will have also come from other houses just like us so maybe we can still have a good, peaceful year like you said."
"Wh—what?!" She blurted out.
"I'll
"What the hell—?"
His father, on the other hand, was a different story.
"I'm just telling you what I remember." Corey answered in a shaky voice, biting his lip and wrapping his arms around himself. "I remember Draco talking to me, then his eyes got all red and weird, and then, the next thing I remember, I was waking up in my bed and my housemates were telling me that I was being summoned to the Headmistress' office." He added miserably.
Draco's eyes dimmed and his expression grew resentfully bitter at her words. He stalked towards her and pushed her down onto her back, stubbornly placing both of his hands on either side of her head so that he caged her between him and the hospital bed.

Fortunately, they didn't need to speak to each other again for the remainder of the lesson.
"Anyway—" Draco shoved his hands into the pockets of his coat and glanced over her shoulder to stare at the train platform. "—are you planning to spend the rest of your Christmas break in London?"
"Malfoy knows, Malfoy doesn't know, does it really matter at this point?! It's not like we can keep hiding this secret of yours from everyone forever! Is this really that much of a big deal to you?!" She demanded.
"Seriously, 'Mione. You'd better have a good reason for waking me up in the middle of the night like this." She muttered grumpily, rubbing her eyes and pushing her long hair away from her face.
"No."
tell her off."
He gave her one last wink and smirk before he walked off, leaving Aria fuming as she glared irritably after his retreating back.
"Malfoy, seriously." Aria let out an exasperated sigh and turned to glare at him, finally allowing him to see the genuine irritation seeping into her face for the first time. "It's not cute anymore. Will you grow up?!"
"No!" Pansy blurted out, looking exasperated as she shoved the smaller girl away and turned back to her breakfast.
"Ah well, I suppose it's not that bad if I eat it
Aria felt his lips curving upwards into a reluctant smile, but just as their kiss grew heated and Draco reached up, resting his hand gently on the back of her neck to kiss her deeper, they were interrupted when two people suddenly plopped down into the empty seats across the table.

"I'm not a mind reader." Draco pointed out, glaring at her. "If there's something you want to tell me, then just say it."
Draco arched an eyebrow and shot her a disinterested glance over his shoulder.
She couldn't help thinking about how, in the last couple of years, the Weasleys had also invited Remus and Tonks to celebrate Christmas with them. And given the circumstances, Aria
Draco stared at her.
She grinned and shrugged.
He glanced discreetly to his side, noting that Blaise had raised his hands up in the air in a gesture of surrender while Pansy remained completely still beside him, her eyes wide as she kept glancing nervously at Draco with a panicked look on her face.
