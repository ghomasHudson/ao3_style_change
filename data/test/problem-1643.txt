Hermione patted his chest and shook her head. “We need calm and understanding.”
Harry frowned. “Don’t you like it?”
Helen agreed and took off on her mission. Tawy studied the parchment, it was far more detailed than the preliminary report she’d sent to the courts. Harder to read as well, this child had been through so damn much, too much. Tawy left the quill and moved closer to Draco’s bedside. “Draco?” His eyes clumsily focused on her, “Do you remember me?” He nodded with several blinks. “Do you remember where you are?” He nodded again and tried to sit up, she helped him. “Do you want to try and get dressed?”
Judge Fumeurs glanced down at the injunction and then to the woman before him and decided to see this though. “Alright Madam,” he looked up and to the room at large, “Minister and members of the court will remain, everyone else out. This court will be close for,” he paused, while the judge to the right leaned in and whispered to him, Fumeurs nodded, “5 hours.”
Tawy sighed, “thank you,” she patted her knees as she got up. “I’ll have their schedule changed.”
Harry nodded grimly and wished he had Ron and Hermione. They made slow progress. Malfoy walked as if they were going towards their execution and Harry refused to leave him. Harry wasn’t going in alone. Still the place wasn’t that big, and the arrows stopped at a doorway. He took a deep breath and glanced at Malfoy, who sighed deeply but then nodded.
“What do you think?”
“And where does she come by that theory?” Rey moved what was left his lunch over to make way for his book.
By now, they had a routine, Draco didn’t even attempt to sit on the couch any more, but in front of it, next to Harry, as they pulled out the markers and unfinished art from last time. Tawy lowered herself down as they prepared.
The bracelets led them through the building and down some stairs into a room in the middle of nowhere that Harry could tell. It had taken longer than he’d thought as the circle seemed ready to go when they walked in. Thankfully there was already an older lady sitting among them. That girl, Mandy, was sitting with the 4 girls and 2 boys, the others Harry hadn’t seen before. There were two chairs set away from the others and Harry dropped into one, Malfoy next to him.
Teddy nodded, “yeah. A lot of people do.”
Harry nodded. He figured it was his best bet. That way Draco wouldn’t hear his problems, but Harry wouldn’t be alone.
Harry smiled. “I’m sure you can, but you won’t have to alone.”
“If we had, you would’ve said no,” Harry scowled.
Harry watched him for a few minutes, “It’s been two days Draco. I think we should go to group.”
“Thank Merlin. I thought I had missed you.” He looked the other boy over. Malfoy looked okay, beyond some dark circles under his eyes.
“What about you Potter?” Mandy asked.
Harry frowned. “I think Molly does that with Ron. Maybe it’s normal?”
“Surely you know what you’re looking for?” Narcissa stood from the bench and pinned the Healer with a stare.
Mandy looked around the table. “Um I’ll get the stuff. Show them the place.”
Draco shrugged and waved a hand, “Australian native magic is so different. Don’t even ask; just know Harry got the blessing of a whole other nation, per usual.” Draco grinned towards Harry.
“Worth every gallon,” Draco sniffed, the smile curling his lip gave away his amusement.
“I’m not going to Azkaban?” He sounded so lost and hopeful.
“It isn’t me who wants to use it." Ben growled back.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes Potter.”
Violet smiled. “Good on you. Have you told him yet?”
George grinned, and it looked as if he were genuine even if the smile stopped short of his eyes, “Hey that’s great you two, we’ve,” he paused, his eyes shuttered briefly, “I’ve always thought you two would be great for each other.”
“Ready to party?”
“But,”
It was Harry’s turn to blush. “Yeah, let’s get all this.”
people. I strongly suggest not fucking with them.”
She nodded and pulled a long parchment from her robe. “In brief, he’s 2 stone (28 lbs) underweight and suffers from advanced trauma.” She stared at the paper for several minutes then huffed, her tongue unable to hold. She stiffened, “No one is meant to carry high amounts of stress for long periods of time, but it is particularly hard on children.”
“A couple of joints.” Ben grumbled.
Hermione thought they should wait until court was closer to opening the session to avoid the reporters. Ron thought they wouldn’t get good seats if they waited. Ron wanted to be close enough to see Malfoy squirm. They compromised Ron and Hermione went ahead early, while Harry found himself sneaking in just as the Grand Wizengamot took their seats. He slumped between his best friends just as Judge Fumeurs started the session.
“So, while I was getting the drinks, I realized something. You’re going to marry me.” Harry announced to Draco with a grin.
“What of their things?” Molly demanded, unhappy about the developments, as now she wouldn’t even have a chance to discuss this with him in private.
Even with near about the whole Great Hall trying it still took them about 7 minutes to get the doors open. Ron called out as the students spread out, “Now remember if you find Malfoy, for the love of Merlin, don’t attack him or I’ll hex your ass.”
Murphy sighed. “I’m not giving up on them. They’re clearly damaged, but how can I ask them to share, when whatever they share traumatizes the other kids. I can’t even relate to what they’ve been through.”
“Any preferences for lunch? Somewhere close so we’re sure to make it back in time.” Hermione asked as they started towards the door.
Harry hadn’t but nodded anyway, happier when Malfoy came out of the damn bathroom in time to say, “of course we remember you, Healer Assistant Deana.”
Siri quickly nodded, “of course. We’ve houses there. You could visit us every holiday. Call us whenever you needed.”
Harry made to stand, but Draco was already on his feet, and Hermione grabbed his arm, “he’s fine Harry, don’t bring any more attention to it.”
Harry would recognize that prick Smith’s voice anywhere. He clasped his hands behind his back, “I have been told that not even most adults can cast a strong cruciatus or imperius. I’ve also been told that the cruciatus was taught and used here while I was gone, largely to lackluster results. Most students were unable to create the curse and those who did were very weak, of which you should all be proud.” He looked around the room, “Bellatrix once told me you have to mean to cause pain, but she wasn’t quite right.” Harry eyes took a faraway glazed look, “sometimes all you have to do is fear the outcome more if you don’t. Sometimes you have to do horrible things because the alternative is even worse.” Harry shook his head, and offered a smile that was worse than the previous. “I’m told that both Malfoy and I are very talented with both pieces of dark magic. The first time I used the cruciatus, Mad-Eye Moody said I was a good boy and gave me chocolate frog,” he looked up, trying to pull back from the memory, “he was so impressed because the man had broken over a hundred of his own bones while trying to get away from me.” Harry smirked, “they said I had to teach them to fear me, isn’t that right Headmistress?”
“I’ve never heard of a play wand that would deliver a stinging hex.”
“How are they treating you,” Hermione paused, looked to Draco and finished, “both?” They looked so healthy and happy, but she wasn’t sure if that was due to finding each other or in some part due to where they were.
“He nearly killed you and you’re like ok with that?” Rey sounded completely confused.
“How you holding up boy?” An overfriendly pat to the back had Harry stumbling before he could turn and give Minister Shacklebolt a negligible smile.
Neville slipped it back into his pocket. He’d kept it with him, half afraid it would light and half hoping it did. He couldn’t imagine what Dumbledore could have planned so long after his death, but it would have to be good or hopefully good, important.
“What is going on here?” Murphy, so busy studying the doors, he didn’t even look Mandy’s way. “The doors, how?”
“Lovely,” Draco muttered.
Mandy rolled hers. “Of you,” she nodded towards Draco, “of him, the two of you. They probably want to pretend their job here somehow gives them the right to watch your duel and talk to you about it.”
“We will discuss this issue at a later date,” Judge Fumeurs replied, while gesturing towards Andromeda and the circus of people and media, “let us first finish the matter at hand.” He looked to Andromeda, “Madam, the concern you’ve gratefully brought to the court’s attention will be swiftly dealt with we assure you.” He glanced to the papers in front of him, “but the boy in question, even given the new laws, is nearly a legal adult.”
“It’s lovely, mother has a beautiful garden.”
“Harry, Draco, glad I caught you.” Tawy swiftly cut around a nurse and towards them. She stopped in front of them with a wide grin on her face, “Just some last-minute stuff.” They’d already thanked her, but Harry did again, just in case she was thinking of changing her mind, but she waved it off. “You’ll probably need some money. Muggle clothes you know, the t-shirt and pants you wear in here will get you to a store. Draco have you ever been to a muggle shop?”
Lucius nearly fell twice in his run though the house. “Cissa!” She continued screaming and he followed the sound. He skidded around a corner and pushed away from the doorway he’d clipped with his shoulder. He slid to a stop in front of her, grabbed her arms, and then into a tight hug as she threw herself into his arms. “Cissa, oh Cissa, darling what is it? What?”
Ron’s bellow seemed to carry. Hermione elbowed him, before Harry had the chance, but the whole place was already looking their way. Ron gulped, and Hermione sighed, but the elderly man at the front of the line paused in his order and looked back with squinting eyes. “Mr. Potter? Is that you lad?”
Epilogue:
Draco blinked, “House elves heads on the walls and that cow screeching at you from a painting, you can keep the England Black house Potter.”
Healer Murphy raised his hand. “Enough, Ben you know we don’t judge. It was a valid fear.”
He looked up and smiled. “Hey Zabini, we were just waiting for you,” but Zabini didn’t smile instead he slapped down a paper.
“Where are the boys?” Violet placed new drinks on the table and some hot apps from the kitchen.
“And you’ll be continuing the therapy groups and sessions?” Tawy asked, her quill paused, as she looked up.
Ron’s grinned widened and he waved a hand towards the table, “Please join us. We’re just waiting for Hermione.”
Murmurs spread around the courtroom. Complete loss of benefits was a punishment left for the most grievous of violations against the Auror code.
Draco cast a desperate look towards his mother. “But I had too, you don’t understand.”
Neville Longbottom scratched his head, “I’m not sure I understand. Hermione was pardoned by the Ministry for,” he glanced around, and to George’s (somewhat, but not very) surprised eyes, it wasn’t the Slytherin’s in the group that caused Neville’s cautious look around. “for her parent’s moving.”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. He couldn’t really see his father loving him after all his failures, much less if he let the ol’man have it. Lucius was pretty much done with him. But maybe he had a chance with Mother and he was afraid to lose that chance. He was afraid to test that love in case it failed. Then there would be no chance, but then he’d know for sure. Maybe just maybe he’d be happier if he didn’t have to worry about every word and every step. He lifted his head and looked to Harry, “Hey what about Granger?”
George tilted his head towards her with a nod. “Yeah. I can see Harry getting his chance and diving on it. If so, good on him.” Merlin he hoped he wasn’t anywhere around when Ginny caught wind. They may have broken up, but George was under no disillusions that Ginny had given up.
Hermione thought to apologize for jumping ahead but, as she looked around, she realized every person in the place was smiling and no one seemed upset at all. People patted Harry’s back and shoulders with wide grins as he passed, and everyone stepped back so he had a clear path to the front counter.
The Judge peered over his reading glasses, “These two young men have been specially trained by the most powerful wizard in 100’s of generations, Albus Dumbledore. They were also trained in various untraditional ways by those most powerful and insane, Riddle, Potion Master Snape, Sirius Black, and the Lestranges to name a few.” Judge Fumeurs looked between the two boys. His shoes were older than these two. They looked so very lost and broken. He tapped the table. “They were the young figureheads of a war and asked to commit undertakings most hideous by both sides.” He tapped the table again. “The most powerful of us singled them out and in the very process damaged them.” Impassioned, he slapped the palm of his hand onto the desk forcefully.
“I know, but I just can’t,” Draco picked up the sleeve of a jacket that was probably polyester and shuttered. “Potter-Harry please.”
She nodded and accepted the chain. “Of course, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry didn’t bother jumping up this time as the door opened after a pause and the same lady from last night stuck her head in. “Oh good.” She came into the room, glanced around and relaxed when she saw the closed bathroom door. “I don’t know if you remember me? Yesterday was pretty filling for you. I’m Healer Assistant Deana.”
Draco didn’t look at the Healer or even Harry though he was facing him and he hadn’t pulled out of Harry’s hold. “Afterwards in the manor, we were there for months, and neither ever came and spoke to me. They didn’t even come into my wing of the house. Once I blew up a potion and the Auror guard came to check on me, not them. She sent me a letter to tell me the solicitor had secured my Black title.”
Ahead of them Mandy glanced around, “Ben, find Tawy. Clara, find some-fucking-body.” Ben and Clara broke away from them at a run. “Here.” She slid to a stop in front of a set of double doors. Mandy tried to open them and slammed her hand against the wood when the door remained shut. “It’s fucking locked.” She turned and looked at them, paling, “Shite, this is the training room, but it’s locked, and I don’t,”
“So he was just telling me.” Healer Tawy turned back to the armoire as the other woman moved closer.
Harry hated handing his wand over at the end of their time. He couldn’t wait until he was at Hogwarts where he’d have it all the time, he paused, “we’ll get our wands back when we go to Hogwarts, right?”
Tawy had said it would take time and Harry tried to convey that to the blond and while Draco nodded Harry knew he was hurt and disappointed.
Neither Sev nor Siri had ever lied to him so he took them at their word and the excitement over took him. He was going to Hogwarts.
“Draco,” Lucius started then stopped, he looked to Narcissa.
“Yes.” Ron shook her hand, already feeling better. If this woman was on their side maybe Hermione had a chance. Her and her army, he took note of the group behind her, the best dressed army he’d ever seen.
He looked down to Hermione’s pale face.
had done it, but I did it.” Draco hissed, looking over Harry’s shoulder.
Healer Kelly frowned. “The privacy shield is active for an hour. I must ask you both to sit. No one is going to force you to say anything.”
Murphy nodded, “quite right,” and quickly used the key. He grabbed up the wands and nearly forgot the key but grabbed it at the last moment and sprinted from the room.
Draco looked to his mother and shrugged as well, “Wasn’t anything important Mother.”
“It won’t hurt us,” Siri offered, “and if you’re worried we’d be upset or angry don’t be, we’re okay.”
Kade stood, “we’ve retained no legal counsel.”
Tawy nodded. “I think it best this way.”
“Well enough sir,” Harry put more sincerity into his smile towards the man. He never realized how good it would feel to have the Ministry on his side until Shacklebolt became Minister, he found he like it.
Harry shrugged. He was just scribbling and using as many colours and styles he could.
“No one’s ever worn them before. We have new for each new patient, magic residue you know. You can take them with you.” Helen added helpfully.
The Healer paused, her hand still raised in plea, shock on her face. “What? That’s not possible.”
“That’s amazing.” Rey announced, “so that means your joint owners of the Elder wand.”
“In.” A voice yelled back.
Draco nodded.
“It’s ridiculous. I need to be able to write him at least. He’s my child,” Her anger turned to brokenhearted despair, “how can I rebuild my relationship with him while they have him? What are they doing with him? I’m his mother and I demand him back.”
Teddy looked to Sev too, as Siri tended to dance around topics, but Sev always just said what they wanted. Teddy liked that about Sev.
“Maybe.” Draco allowed. The reason children went to magic school at 11 was because that’s when they experienced their magic increase. If they’d been given the potion around that time, they probably wouldn’t have noticed.
It eyed both he and then Draco, and gave Draco a small smile, bowing quickly, “Masters, ma’am, sirs, I am to direct you to the back garden.”
Draco’s eyes whipped up from he’d been looking at his wand in Tawy’s hand to her face.
Tawy nodded. “I know Kelly. It’s alright.” Tawy patted the distraught woman once more before looking to an assistant, “where are my wards right now?”
Hermione nodded. “It’s just been so long.”
“No. I didn’t have any.” He explained about Dudley and then why Dudley didn’t have to share. Tawy causally commented and Harry answered without thought, his mind on picking his next color. She inquired about the house he’d grown up in and he drew his Uncle and Aunt’s house as he explained his cupboard under the stairs. He wondered why she bothered. His cupboard under the stairs was practically old news, hell everyone knew. Still it was a damn sight easier to talk about that than what she could’ve been asking about so Harry just went along. He drew a school bus as he vented about how horrible primary had been with Dudley making sure people stayed away.
He shook his head. He’d rather just have this over with.
Tawy was sure he did. “I see. Anything else I should know?” She saw even revealing this much bothered them, but they loved the boy enough to try. They had nothing further for her and she lifted the bubble.
George nodded, “She was, was even approached by the Ministry to write a paper of exactly what she’d done. That doesn’t seem to matter to the Australian government. The Ministry claims it’s all a mistake, they’re fixing it, and Hermione will not be prosecuted or anything. However, sorting it all will take time.”
“It’s there?”
The End
Healer Helen was still looking at him and Draco studied the floor to escape her gaze.
“Would have I suggested it otherwise? You would’ve likely mentioned it yourself had it been Malfoy family magic instead of Black.”
Draco raised an eyebrow while Harry starred with wide eyes, “as I was saying Potter, I think that took a little longer than we’d thought.”
“He nearly killed Katie and he used imperius on Rosmerta.”
Draco patted Harry’s knee, “same.”
Tawy leaned against the desk and maintained a front of listening to Kingsley and the Judge, while watching her wards/patient’s say their goodbyes. The Malfoy’s were regal and icy, but she noticed how they clutched Draco closely under the pretense of advice. Potter’s crew was much more obvious in their affections teary hugs and promises. Draco joined her first, quietly standing to her side, not drawing any attention to himself. She could see the slight tremor in his hands, though he faced straight ahead and looked unbothered. Soon after, Harry pulled himself over to them. Tawy excused herself from the Minister and Judge, before Mrs. Weasley could approach again. She pulled an old quill from her pocket, “grab on boys”, and activated the Ministry sanctioned portkey.
Healer Murphy looked between them, “As you just heard, I’m Healer Murphy. Thank you for coming to the Trauma group. I’d like to welcome you both. This isn’t anything formal and I hope you’ll speak up in time but don’t feel pressured to. We just talk about whatever comes up.” He headed off towards the circle.
Ron smiled even as Kade stood from his chair. “Now see here, we called for no barrister. The Ministry can handle this matter.”
“No.”
She nodded, mentally blaming herself for even coming, but knowing Draco would love getting some word from his mother. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy.” She pocketed the chain, just as Narcissa rushed over with a parchment, sealed with the Malfoy emblem.
“Oh,” the tension rolled off the boy and he slumped, “good. I didn’t think I’d like it.”
Draco smiled. “The last time was about 2 years ago.”
“Did it always give you headaches?”
She listened to his answer. “Good, get on that. Until then I have to tell those boys what the whole world has recently heard.” She scowled but nodded at the words said to her and replied. “I’m sorry too, fix this.” She pulled her head from the fire and sighed heavily. She didn’t dare let this wait. She feared someone would get to them before she did. She tapped the band at her wrist. “No one enters Potter and Malfoy’s room, no one and call me if they attempt to leave.”
“I’m taking Draco to some restaurants. A fish and chips isn’t going to cut it.
Teddy shook his head. “Cards, posters, books, movies, fan clubs, classes. You two are the most famous wizards the world over. I’ve written countless papers about the two of you and, though I was tempted, I never mentioned you both leave wet towels on the floor.”
Hermione gasped.  Harry glanced at her sharply, but she wasn’t looking his way and he didn’t want to draw attention to himself by asking outright. He could tell by the paling faces around him that the news wasn’t good.
Ben looked away. “Course not, hey we’re here.” Ben sped up catching Rey in front of a door that Harry figured was someone’s room. Just much further down the same hall as their room.
Lucius studied him for a moment. “They suit you.” He nodded, approvingly, “yes, very nice. Perhaps I should retain myself some.”
“Well, for one, they can’t stand you.”
Judge Fumeurs didn’t have to speculate, he’d seen more than enough. “I understand. However we still don’t approve of how they handled the situation. You spent nearly every waking moment living in fear or locked your room.”
Luna glanced towards George and placed a hand on Pansy’s arm before she spoke kindly to Neville, “They’ve got to be delaying Hermione and Ron’s return for some reason.”
Draco patted Harry side and whispered to him.
“You blokes ever smoke before?” Mandy looked disinterested but her drumming fingers told another story.
Hermione nodded, somewhat deflated, as that knowledge is what upset her most of all. “And you’ve tried more owls?”
Murphy stood, “Harry, Draco, thank you for joining us. Please come in.”
He met Harry’s eyes. “Uncle Sev is dead, so she’s the only person I think might love me.”
Harry nodded, as if he’d made the point himself.
Lucius nodded.
Harry glanced to Draco, who gave a slight head tilt, telling him to go ahead. Harry rolled his eyes. “Um, yeah, we do,” He stressed the ‘we’ so Draco knew he wasn’t getting out of it. “We wanted to talk about that siphoning business.”
“Their magic,” Ella squeaked. “What do we do?”
“We had noticed thanks,” Draco scowled.
Draco crept closer, careful to be soundless. It took a few moments, but Draco moved close enough to peer through some shelves. It was only his mother and father and normally Draco would’ve announced himself, but something about this scene kept him quiet.
Andromeda had been willing to approach Narcissa, but was willing to agree with the Healer as well, only because she didn’t believe Narcissa knew more. “If that’s all,” She made to leave though paused when Tawy shook her head.
“No one knows where you are, not even your closest friends. This could be considered a resort.” Tawy offered.
Harry grumbled. “Like we’ve got choice if we ever want to be considered an adult or get a job. Besides Hermione would carry me back if I didn’t. You going?”
“I’d like to thank the court for seeing me and for considering my plea. Rather than hocus pocus around the topic allow me to come to the point. In the last 10 years, I have petitioned the Ministry’s division of Child Well-Care 12 times to remove my nephew, Draco Malfoy, from his home and to place him into my care. Each time I was refused, without investigation, because some wizards care more for gallons than they do for children’s welfare.”
The bench was hard, and another headache was gaining power, but it could have been worse. Draco glanced from their holding cell to the one across. Where several of his father’s ex-cohorts paced and argued among themselves while frequently throwing dirty looks their way. One of them caught Draco looking and licked his lips lewdly before winking. Draco quickly looked away. When they’d first been brought down here, one of the two Aurors had meant to put them in with the other accused. Thankfully the female Auror had stopped him. Draco had been so relieved. He hadn’t even reacted when she had said to put the child and his parents in a separate cell.
“Inhale and hold, little puffs at first, but we’ll cough no matter what. Don’t inhale to deeply cause we’ll burn our throats.” Harry glanced towards Ben. “Raised by muggles and my cousin was into it.”
“I distract myself. Once I hit my fist into a wall.”
“This is preposterous,” Kade scowled, “Mr. Weasley, I don’t believe you should accept the help of this woman.”
Draco shuttered. “No, it would not.”
Ben waved her words off as he approached.
“I was thinking of,” he brought the braid to wrap around his shoulder.
“Alright there Ron?”
Tawy stepped lightly into the room and smiled warmly. “Can we talk?”
Violet leaned over the bar. “You Ron?”
“What do they want then?” Harry point his chin towards the group still huddled together and staring their way.
Mandy screamed as the doors crumbled like paper and fell away. “How?”
They ended up at a wizard fish and chip, a short walk from the Ministry, though it seemed everyone else had the same idea and the place was filled to the rafters. Ron looked the crowd over with despair and whaled, “we’re never going to eat and get back in time.”
“It’s just an hour.” Harry added.
“Not to me,” Molly answered, “had I thought. Well I don’t know why I didn’t question the idea of a child being so entrenched. It’s just, we had Harry. I’m ashamed to admit with him being a Malfoy that I didn’t always think of him as a child like our own.”
going through.”
Harry jumped from his bed eager for something, but the door opened before his feet were on the floor. A woman stuck her head in the room, “Oh good, you’re still awake. You both looked so knackered I wasn’t sure.” She leaned back, “They’re still up,” she turned from the door, leaving her foot in the room, “yeah give me theirs. They get, yeah that one.” She turned back, pushing the door with her foot and carrying a tray. “Okay boys, we got a little bit of everything here.” She carried the tray to the table. “Take the potions first. Please eat as much as you can huh, supposed to put some weight on you two.”
“Your Honor,” Mrs. Tonks inquired.
“In mass, nearly as many as the Malfoy’s have.” Pansy replied. “They’ve all returned, most confused and in a couple of cases with a cease and desist Ministry letter attached.”
“Tawy,” a scared voice called out from the remains of the group.
“It’s not just that,” Healer Tawy calmly interceded before Molly could do more than open her mouth. “They’ve been through very traumatic experiences for long durations. They’re underweight and suffer from a long list of health, magical, and mentally related issues. Their magic cores have been taxed beyond measure.” She glanced to Shacklebolt, he nodded, and she added with no little consideration. “They’ve been siphoned as well.”
Mandy quickly climbed the stairs. She was careful not to cross over, she grabbed his arm, held it over the first step, and leaned in, “take a breath Jamison. They aren’t going to kill you,” she leaned in closer and whispered. Still looking terrified, the boy nodded and took off as soon as he was released. Mandy turned back to them, “now we give him five and hope he doesn’t have a panic attack between here and there and forget what he was doing.”
Harry thought that actually rather fit, “shark.”
Harry liked the fact that the Owl’s cage was left open, both fresh water and food, and the cage looked clean. He couldn’t imagine any muggle relative of his taking so much care of an owl.
Harry blinked, “wow, that’s,”
Teddy couldn’t believe he was talking to Hermione, the Hermione Granger and she was so nice. She’d even hugged him. All the girls he’d went to school wanted to be just like her, smart and brave. People from all over the world read her blog.
“You have to ask Potter. It’s a lot of work and the goblins love to babysit unclaimed money. They just hoard it until an inheritor comes along to claim it. There’s probably a manor house somewhere that should be yours.”
Teddy looked up from his shrunken head, awesome gift. He was so going to Africa one day. “Huh,” he looked between his brothers, “what do you mean?” He’d thought he’d told them everything already.
“Probably takes more power than you’ve got.” Ben smirked, then ducked the chips Mandy threw at him.
“Harry,” She raised her hands, very aware of where her wand was in case she needed it.
Tawy shook her head minutely but then did her best to look between them and convey understanding. “I know I’ve explained this before, but I need you to hear what I am saying. The night staff going into your room like that was a mistake, it will not happen again. Regardless to what is happening, no matter how bad your nightmares are.” They nodded but she felt like it was something they still feared. She wished she could go back and reprimand everyone involved with that mistake harsher. “Last night was no one's fault and I’m not placing any blame. Can we talk about it?”
“We could start by trying to hang out with them. Then later invite them to a game of 20 questions, pass it around and get to the real questions.” Ella flipped her hair. “Take our time and that way we can work up to the real stuff.”
“What?” Harry asked.
“Tawy,”
“It drags up all the shit that made it a trigger in the first place.” Ben tossed out over his folded arms.
“Shark?”
“Yeah, hi,” Harry mumbled, slouching down in his chair. Next to him, Malfoy, perfect posture, nodded to her.
“I know,” She leaned forward, “I’m not angry. I wish you had come to me before attempting blood magic, but I am not angry.”
“Is that a rubrics’ cube? Where did you ever see one of those?”
“Survive Cissa. We help him, do whatever he needs us to do and we survive.”
When Teddy had been little, there had been healers, spells, and secrets all around Severus and Sirius. He remembered the healers, ones for the mind and for the body, arriving and speaking with his brothers behind closed doors. He remembered watching his grandmother perform nightly silencing charms on the door of their room. And he remembered the one time she’d forgotten and the screams that had shaken the house.
Even the Slytherins had thrown Draco out as a sacrifice. They didn’t taunt him, but they did ignore him. They didn’t speak to him or help him out. They distanced themselves, as if they’d had nothing to do with the Death Eaters or their beliefs. As if, by distance, they could remove the stains upon their own names even the ones with parents in Azkaban.
Draco’s eyes widened with shock but, unable to ignore his manners, he mumbled, “thank you”. It had been awhile since anyone had said he was attractive in any manner, without following it up with some lewd behavior.
It was a better answer than they’d thought they’d get to such a question.
“What?” Harry scowled. Tawy’s words had come directly from a session. One where Draco had been the one to say, ‘I was raised by death eaters, what would I know about sharing?’ Ever since then it had been a phase used to forgive a multitude of Draco’s sins. Tawy called them teaching experiences and it had helped Harry to show Draco how slighted some of his views were. It was theirs and it was how Harry knew, really knew Draco wasn’t in trouble. Yet to hear it from someone else, someone who didn’t know the story or them.
Rey rolled off his beanbag and then grabbed Clara, pulling her away. “Shite…shite,” the boy mumbled, while Clara tried to ask him what was going on.
Malfoy took a deep breath. “Most the wandless we know is nasty, get our wands.”
Harry went to the table and picked up the first vial with a golden H on the top. He looked but there was no indication of what the potion even was. He sighed and drank the first.
Tawy stood, “so you all say.”
Dr. Strike look flustered, Penny, and the other four standing with them too interested and eager. A woman pushed between Penny and Dr. Strike, “Hi, it’s so fantastic to meet you both. My daughter has this poster of the two of you in her room. You know the side profile one, where you’re facing each other, of course you do. She’ll be so excited when I tell,”
Belinda’s eyebrow rose, “I would like to remind you of the oath I took to be allowed into this room as I ask, is that something they’d be interested in?”
Three months later and Teddy could barely contain himself. It was hard saying goodbye to all his friends. It was harder still to say goodbye to his grandmother, who had found life and a new love in Canada and didn’t want to go back, though he would still see her over the longer breaks.
- Later
Molly scowled, she had been told Harry had many varied problems, but this was the first time anything so serious had been announced.
Healer Tawy paused, she glanced to Shacklebolt, who nodded. She turned back to the court with a tilt of her head but said nothing further.
‘In here’ was small study, which Harry followed Draco into. The other boy was moving a lot faster once he learned he’d receive his wand back.

She nodded. “Yes, he told Harry where to push and then bam! They just popped out. Tawy they broke the trust. The rest of the kids can’t have them there until they can abide by the rules. You know how important trust is for my group.”
“I’d forget Severus and Mother.”
“Do you believe this, or do you know it?” Mrs. Tonks demanded.
It was Mandy and not Ella that approached them. “Do you want out?”
“Must I?”
Neville’s eyes widened as he looked to the others. Hermione and Pansy were smiling, nearly bursting and Blaise chuckled even as he left to get a round of drinks. So, whatever this was, it couldn’t be bad, still, “Sickening?”
“That’s not an answer,” Frustration bled into his tone, Harry had about enough of adults keeping things about him from him.
“Where will we go?” Draco asked, “my mother is under house arrest and my father is in Azkaban and your place is surrounded by the press.”
She nodded, “fine, really.”
Hermione’s hand squeezed the back of Ron’s neck protectively and then ruffled his hair playfully, “Then it’s time you get yours cut Charlie,” she grinned.
“I see. How old were you?”
Harry leaned back, nasty smelling, mistaken for tea? He tilted forward in his chair. “Weed?” Seemed the most likely.  Draco tugged on his sleeve and Harry could see his confusion and could almost hear his complaints about having anything to do with a weed. Harry shook his head. “I’ll explain in a second.”
Ben nodded. “He’s right,” Rey grinned at the unexpected back-up until Ben smirked, “we should get them a mellow high.”
She opened the boxes. Harry grinned and grabbed one up. “Markers?”
She looked between them, “oh, I see.”
The owner of the room jumped up, a few others sitting on bed, looking expectant. “So hey Malfoy and Potter,”
Romilda’s foot hoovered over the step but she pulled back to everyone’s relief.
“Come on then.”
Draco looked between the Judge and his parents, not quite sure what had happened.
“So, you know?”
It was small and cramped, lived in, but it looked homely. Though it looked nothing like it, it reminded Harry of the burrow. He looked around, “it’s great.”
“You best get used to it. If you think this lots jumpy, wait till you go back to Hogwarts where they know us.”
“Potter, Malfoy wait!” Ella called out, she nearly tripped over her own chair, trying to catch up.
“We have the gallons I had when I was brought in.” Harry pulled the pouch from his robe pocket.
The reporters ate up her grand entrance. Harry could see several of the
Any other time Draco might have said nothing and told Harry to go back to sleep. Or perhaps made something up, said something that might have pushed Harry away, or started an argument. But here in the silence of the house and the warmth of Harry. Draco spoke.
Turned out the lovely restaurant was exclusive and over the top.
“I agree,” Andromeda gave the court a tight smile, “but let’s look at the whole picture and not just the little glimpses they would have you see. Let us see how guilty that child truly is.”
At first, he felt damaged, alone, but then Harry cracked himself open and offered his own pain.
Draco didn’t say anything but he traced his name across the screen.
Hermione scanned the grounds for what Neville had called them over for. There, at the largest statue, a boy stood with his trunk.  Her eyes whipped to the movement of someone coming around the statue. There they were, unmistakable it was Harry and Draco, circling the statue. Draco pointed and shook his head, while Harry’s body language screamed disgust. Harry kicked the statue with the side of his foot for good measure.
Lucius scowled. If the ministry didn’t allow Narcissa’s letters to reach Draco soon, he’d be suing them liable for cruel and unusual punishment. They’d no idea the agony he’d undergo if Narcissa continued to be put off.
Draco nodded, “Yes, Nirvana too,” he leaned forward and reached into his back pocket, “Here,” he offered a pen, “this will work.”
“Blaise’s dating Luna?” Draco boggled.
“He’s a particular fan of markers,” Harry added, “we had to pay a friend of ours to pick him up every type she could find.”
Draco nodded, and she pulled out the chain. “Your father gave me this, said to only deliver this into your hands only. If anyone else touched it before your hands, it would go back to him. I don’t know why, or what it’s been done to it. It’s got a ton of charms on it, doesn’t seem harmful.”
Draco shrugged. “Don’t know, just don’t, what about you?”
“Probably won’t let us take our wands.”
Ron scowled, “what the hell are you saying man?”
Draco nodded, “But is it enough?”
Malfoy chuckled as he took the seat across from him. “You can’t escape it Potter. You’ll have to take it 8
“I don’t,” she started, but then rolled her eyes, “fine.” Mandy pulled out a little box and expertly lit the joint she pulled from it, taking a puff before handing off to Ben.
“I must agree,” the Malfoy solicitor added as he lifted his head, “these papers do not give the Child Well-fare department short term custody to be terminated at majority. It directly gives Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt and Healer Tawy Robertoun sole guardianship. Full custody until they decide to relinquish it. It says those boys are legally incompetent. The relinquishment of guardianship is based on opinion. It shows a complete disregard for his parent’s rights and young Malfoy’s crossover into the majority. You could claim the boy was incompetent for half his life with no legal recourse.”
going through or what he
“Teddy?”
Harry shook his head. “Nope. Not doing this.”
Harry shook his head. “I just realized it, but I am.”
Ron looked between his girlfriend and his brother and promptly choked on his food.
Lucius watched Narcissa write and went to the floor and swiped the chain from where it had fallen to the ground. “Send him my regards dearest.” He called out as he approached the girl and carefully did not smirk at her unease. He leaned down. “Ms. Parkinson, I would ask that you deliver this to my son and only into his hands. Tell him never to take it off. Do you understand?”
“That bloke you mates were in a war about?”
Mandy took her hand, swinging it, leaning forward and whispering to her. “Violet they’re loaded and really famous in our world. So we gotta get going before more wizards show up around here.”
Harry appreciated the save and the words, nodding to him thankfully. He hadn’t even heard them mention the topic. He straightened, trying to pay more attention.
Harry knew Malfoy was going to go off. It wasn’t a matter of if, but when. Someone like Draco Malfoy couldn’t suffer under the whispers, taunts, and the bullying in silence. Harry could see the strain Malfoy went through trying to ignore them, to avoid them, and to not give them cause.
Draco stood as well and moved so he stood next to his mother, not allowing her to hide him.
going to happen. Harry, people are going to hate me and show it.” He raised a hand at Harry’s protest, “And I deserve it, but I don’t know if it’s right for me to drag you down with me.”
Narcissa took her son’s hand and leaned to meet his eyes. “Draco?”
“We need a knife,” Harry whispered.
Draco however was picking at the food on the table and didn’t notice, so continued, “She constantly talks about carrying too much responsibility, as if we weren’t adults now. Let other people adult, how about you kid for a while. Really who has time for that. And what we’re doing, she’s always wants to talk about that. What we’re reading, and then talking about it, it’s all really fucking odd.” He looked up, “what?” He looked to Harry, who seemed just as confused.
Draco quickly glanced up. “I don’t know.”
Hermione nodded.
Harry figured it was nothing silly.
She looked down to the jagged heart Draco was creating. He’d certainly figured how to use the markers to the best effects.
Andromeda nodded her acceptance as she smoothly answered, “Which is why I am asking you not to force me into another. Draco should have been under my care years ago and by fulfilling my injunction you are righting a great miscarriage of justice.” Andromeda looked around the Wizengamot, who by now had all had a chance to read her parchment. It seemed she was not talking to an unreceptive audience. There were many who seemed very amenable to her words, nodding along as she spoke.
Neville blushed as Pansy grinned at him.
Tawy took her chair from the table and pulled it back the furthest. Harry and Draco sat at the table. Draco’s hand clutched onto Harry’s under the table.
HPHPHP
“Well ah, cabs are kinda,”
Harry quickly shook his head, “no, but we do need it. If you’ve got one Romilda, could we please borrow it?”
Draco tried to see if he could use the couch but soon realized, not only was it awkward, he couldn’t look at the markers and they kept rolling. Also, he ran a high chance of marking up the sofa and that was unacceptable. He looked at Harry, who was comfortable on the floor and able to spread the markers out. He looked down at his clothes, well he wasn’t going to ruin these and Tawy had smile and not yelled when Harry had dropped onto the floor. He dropped his pad onto the floor and followed with his own box.
Ben pushed away from the wall, “Fuck Rey, she’s not going to even admit she’s got it.”
“Draco.” Draco shook her hand as well. “Thank you for having us.”
Draco looked at the stick. “A what?”
Shacklebolt stood, “With your permission Your Honor,” and given a judicial nod, he turned to Andromeda, “are you saying the Ministry knowingly left a child in an abusive environment?”
“He’ll hurt himself trying to break free.” She added softly. She swallowed, “He doesn’t like to be touched. He won’t do anything vulgar, but he will flinch or move away from it, even mine.”
Harry could only guess how expensive Malfoy’s robes were, but they were unfastened at the top. Harry could see, what he thought might be a St. Mungo’s tee-shirt underneath. He recognized the color from his own stay. Harry’s gaze flew back to Malfoy’s face, noting the silver eyes seemed glazed and a little unfocused. Malfoy didn’t seem as graceful as usual either.
Harry nodded, feeling about the same, everything was far away, almost ignorable. He slouched further into the beanbag.
Draco frowned. “I think this needs more green.”
Molly had nothing to add and not to increase the woman’s anger, Tawy relented. She thanked them and released the bubble, crossing the room to collect her wards. She found them quietly sitting, Draco examining his wand. They both quickly reacted to her summons. Draco tucked his wand away, perhaps thinking the Judge might take it again if reminded he held it.
“They were heroes.” Harry had worked long and hard to clear their names and to put them in the statuses they deserved. He hadn’t known they’d given Duke of Black to Draco. So he’d chosen the highest title he was told was available Marquess of Black. Not that it mattered, Sirius wouldn’t have wanted any of them. Just as Snape would’ve been plenty pissed about the Marquess of Prince awarded to him. Harry imaged both men would have plenty to say about the accolades poured onto them posthumous. It amused him greatly to imagine it actually. One of his favorite daydreams.
Hermione starred at the international port key to Australia. First, they’d been awarded handsomely for their part in the success of the war against Voldemort and now this. “I think they’re trying to get rid of us.”
“That sounds about right.” Draco agreed, pulling himself from the beanbag as he spoke, turning and offering his hand down to Harry, “come on Potter, let’s go nap.”
She nodded. “Alright.” She hurried away.
Harry didn’t think he looked nearly as good as Draco, but the clothes fit, and they felt nice, which was good enough for him. He decided to wear out the dark blue jeans and a navy t-shirt. The shoes were soft and felt so good, Harry vowed to never buy cheap shoes again. Draco had also picked out some clothes for the club and some for tomorrow, it all looked good, so he brought it out. “Perfect Draco.”
The Judge leaned back while taking off his glasses, “Under these unusual circumstances, we know no other recourse but to remand them into the Ministries custody. As of today, Ministry custody supersedes any previous custody or claims, which have been rescinded or annulled.”
Still it effected the kids, who stuck to the further parts of the room from the observation window. It wasn’t enough to stop them, this being the only time most of them got a chance to use their wands, but they stuck to small spells. There was no experimenting today. Harry and Draco hadn’t even done that. So far, they just leaned together in the corner, far down and opposite her own. Though they’d had their wands a short time ago, compared to the others, still she didn’t think they’d be so disinclined to practice now.
Draco swallowed thickly, “I’m fine,” he turned towards Harry and smiled thinly.
“Looks good on you though,” Pansy much preferred the ethereal healthy look to the previous look of desperation and agony she’d last seen on him. She’d nearly forgotten how beautiful Draco was.
Harry glanced at Draco and then back to what he’d written. The journal was charmed for his eyes only unless he let Tawy read it. Still he didn’t remove his arm as he leaned down again. ‘I like his sarcasm, when it’s not pointed at me. I like him. I think in a way I always wanted to, like him that is. I guess I have been obsessed with him, but I had good reasons to be. Except maybe those reasons weren’t the only reasons I was, you know, obsessed.” Harry paused, trying to come up with the right words. “I don’t know, it’s like, he’s the only one that understands, enemy, friend whatever. He’s mine. I’ve been opposite him so long I can read him better than anyone. In some ways, we’re so far apart and in others, I’ve never been closer to anyone.’
The senior Judge chosen was a rather young looking 100 years old. Harry thought him to be pretty fair so far. He didn’t seem to like the reporters, which Harry could totally agree with. Senior Judge Fumeurs picked up his wand to begin court proceedings. He was suspended in his action by the courtroom’s double doors flying open and as one the room turned to look back at the entrance.
“Your Grace, are you sure you’re up to this?” Judge Fumeurs asked gravely, “I want you to be fully aware of what’s happening here, it’s very important.”
Mandy rolled her eyes, “Sure whatever.” She looked over to Draco. She still didn’t feel comfortable pressing him as she did Harry, but she could talk to him, which was more than most seemed capable of.
Ella rolled her eyes, “To see
Draco shrugged. “Thanks Pansy, but it doesn’t really matter. It’s already done, and I don’t give a fuck.”
“Good,” he smiled, “they’re not here anymore to control us. We can do or be anything we actually want, so what’s your wildest dream Draco?”
“No one can break the privacy shield.” Another girl announced.
“Oh. Really?”
“Thanks George, that means a lot,” Harry smiled warmly.
Harry scratched his head. “Which,”
Harry bit his lip, wondering when Voldemort had slipped him the potion. He couldn’t imagine anyone else doing it. “Could it still be happening?” The whole thing had a nightmarish quality about it. He could just see Voldemort using this as some way back from the dead.
“Especially when he trips,” Harry grinned. “He’s a great kid.”
“Fluff, do you mind taking a message?” Mandy ran her fingers over the owl’s head as she asked. The owl cooed and stuck out her leg, trying to look puffed and important. Mandy laughed. “I guess not.”
Murphy panted against the doorway. “Here,” he offered the two wands.
“My sister will pick us up tomorrow at noon. We have to bring you both back Saturday by noon, but I figured maybe you could use the break.”
She didn’t seem to notice as she attached the bracelet to Potter’s wrist, though the boy-wonder didn’t look to sure about it. “Nothing too taxing just lunch and some groups. You’re welcome to go anywhere you like on this floor. There’s a social room with all sorts of fun stuff and a library. Just don’t leave this floor. If you do, the bracelets will alarm, and the other floors are for patients who need calm. Understand?”
Harry was confused. He had been led to believe Draco was to be judged at the same time as his parents. So why wasn’t he and where was he that even his parents didn’t know?
“It’s alright. Tawy’s good, she let us out. It’s weird. She’s weird. She wants to talk about everything. She’s always telling us she’s proud of us for stupid things. She says stuff that doesn’t even make sense, like it’s okay to be angry, who says that?” Harry trailed off, noticing the looks among the others.
Draco figured it was test of their truce. He thought about what he knew and offered it. “It means someone gave us a potion, which allowed them to take magic from our magical core and to use it as their own.”
Draco stepped closer and allowed George’s hand to land on his shoulder, “I’m alright.”
“Mum?” Ron had seen his mum cry entirely too much recently and if she was crying over what Ron suspected, he was going to break Malfoy’s nose. He rubbed her shoulder, “it’s not true mum. Malfoy’s parents gave him everything.”
“Not before seeing her at court, which gave me a fright. She looks just like,”
“Hi Mandy, I’m Hermione.”
“I brew potions or at least I did.” Draco raised a handful of hair to show his point. “Once I broke a mirror.”
Ron shook his head. Even he thought Draco had been through enough without this. “I don’t think we should give it to him that’s for damn sure.”
Tawy boggled at the change but stood and slowly approach, taking in the fact Harry still clutched his wand even if the magic had receded for the moment and that his other hand clasped Draco. She looked to the other boy, who seemed better, but not yet well enough to step away from the grip the Savior of the Wizarding World had on him. “Draco, you are not in trouble and we would not ask you to leave Harry, alright?”
The rest of the group was ahead of them and going the same way, though they made sure to stay far ahead of them. Harry noticed Ella looking back towards them once or twice.
“All the other children did not receive special instruction from the Headmaster or Master Snape.” The Judge replied.
Harry grinned. “I kinda think they already know how I feel about you and I don’t care if they don’t approve or whatever. Remember I’ve been wanting this, I’m not about to let it go for no one. I meant it, no one is going to take you away from me.”
Many of Draco’s family contemporaries choked on their morning tea at the sight.
Draco moved away from her, “I’ll be fine mother.” He didn’t glance back as he left, his parents wouldn’t have appreciated the gesture. As soon as they left the cells, he put his head down and kept it there. He was finally thankful for the hair lengthening potion that had gone awry. He’d been bored, locked within the cleared-out mansion, under Auror watch, and awaiting the court’s call. He’d planned to cut it some, but there hadn’t been an opportunity to find anyone. He now found it long and thick enough to hide behind. Normally he’d be glaring straight ahead, daring anyone and everyone to say or do anything. Now though, his head hurt, the pain pounding behind his eyes and he was so damn tired. Too damn weary to face hate from every person he saw without the comfort of a wand. Next to him, the Healer’s steps matched his and he heard the Aurors’ chatting behind them.
“The Bat?” Harry called back.
Bill raised his hands, “I come in peace,” he smiled warmly at his brother’s tense form.
“We’ll discuss that at a later date. I will send owls when any type of contact is sanctioned.” Tawy replied.
“Fans of what?” Harry narrowed his eyes.
Harry smiled. “You’d be surprised what we’re used to.”
They followed behind Tawy, but as they walked, she slowed her pace until she was nearly between them, “anything I need to know about?”
She lifted her head and sniffled while she patted his hand.
Harry shrugged, “Yeah.”
“Did you have a favorite type of marker when you were younger?”
Harry smirked, “Why not?” So far it had worked out.
Mandy threw up a hand. “Shut it, we have a situation.” She moved towards and out the door, without giving the boy a chance to speak.
Hermione frowned. “A lot can happen in a month.”
had any choices. He closed his eyes and took a deep shuttering breath.
Mandy left Violet and wandered their way, she saw Draco shutter and smiled. “Not the stuff His Grace is used to is it?”
Draco shrugged. The words easier to say when Potter wasn’t staring him with those huge green eyes. “I also reinstated Andromeda.”
“Oh,” she was surprised but willing to let it go until she was able to speak with the boys. She studied the pictures again, “the sigil has nothing to do with the marriage ceremony. I don’t know where that came from. It does have to do with spouses though. The Black family developed it centuries ago. It’s generally used during times of civil unrest, war, espionage, or what have you. Times when spouses might need to interact with no one else being the wiser. The rite is risky because the sigil decides how close the bond needs to be. It demands a closeness most Blacks steer clear of. At the least, the bond is vague feelings, at the most,” she shook her head, “I don’t know. I’ve never seen anyone with it. I had forgotten about it until I saw it here. Where did Draco learn it?”
Draco smirked. “I think I can handle it.”
Ron nudged back. “Thank Merlin we both recovered.”
In silent agreement, they aimlessly wandered towards their room.
Draco doubted girl Weasley felt the same, but as Harry’s arms tightened around him, Draco didn’t care about her or her wants. Harry was his.
He turned, expecting to see Siri and Sev and instead, “holy shite.” Instead of Siri and Sev, his lovable brothers, standing at his door was Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. He’d always known it was them, but woe. The changes were subtle but they changed so much. Harry was wearing the glasses, his hair was black and Teddy could see the scar he always hid. Draco’s hair was platinum blond and Teddy could see for the first time the death eater tattoo on his arm.
“She did.” Teddy clicked to the next site. “Here’s one of the memorials, this one is on Hogwarts’ grounds.”
Harry looked to Seamus, “I imagine you would have too, had you had his family or been given as many potions as Malfoy had, and then held down by your own father, while Greyback held your mother in his arms.”
“Horribly mistreated,” he smiled with sickening delight, “huh, that must be the reason we can’t sleep and have some lovely addictions to potions going on.”
Draco grinned at the dark green marker. “Yes Healer.”
Rey leaned forward and took the joint from Ella’s hand. “Aren’t we all? My parents like to use Legilimency and the Imperius curse. And no matter how many times I tried to resist.” He shrugged. “I couldn’t.”
“I think they’re fans.” Mandy answered.
“That always hurts.” Harry grimaced, “Every time.”
Judge Fumeurs paused, paperwork held up in his hand, “Healer.”
“When are we going to get another wand day? It’s been like two weeks.” Ben cut Murphy short, slumping further in his seat when Murphy looked his way.
Draco looked away from Harry. “No, I’m sorry. You have no idea how sorry Violet.”
He made to follow but Bill grabbed his arm, “give them a moment Charlie.”
Charlie wanted to argue. Ron certainly didn’t look fine. He hadn’t interacted with them all morning. He’d kept his chair turned from them and towards the window, overlooking the nothing in the backyard, but mom had barked him to leave Ron be, so he did, but he didn’t like it. “Harry and that Malfoy kid will be here soon.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He’d just opened his book when his bracelet began flashing red. He looked across the table to see Potter’s doing the same. He glanced at the band and sighed, “Lunch.”
They nodded and pocketed the wands.
“Good choice Draco.” Tawy smiled, as she slowly transfigured her chair into a pillow on the floor. “It does work much better down here.”
“After any type of school break, Headmaster Dumbledore always had the kitchen elves add one of my general healing potions to young Draco and Harry’s drinks. Sometimes for as long as a week afterwards.”
Harry shook his head with disgust, “let’s eat.”
After Molly pin-pointed her first contention, she asked Ron and Hermione to step into the hallway, promising to re-call them so they could say goodbye to Harry. They did as she asked but it was a near thing and she could see their unhappiness about it. However, she felt they didn’t need to be included on such a matter they could do nothing about.
Draco folded his arms on the table and raised an eyebrow. “I can.”
Harry nodded. The only person they’d seen was Tawy and while she didn’t say they had to go to group. Harry got the impression if they didn’t leave their room soon, she might start thinking of doing something to make them. They had to face people sooner or later and Harry was of the mind to get it done and fuck ‘em anyways. He had Draco, he didn’t need anyone else. “It doesn’t matter what they think of us or say.”
“She has assured me you’ll be in the same room. However, they have yet to determine how they’re breaking down room assignments. Some of your classmates have needs as well that must be met within reason.” Both boys seemed relieved to hear that, which Tawy had figured, it was nice to know you weren’t alone. “There’s to be accommodations for everyone’s therapy groups and sessions. Our meetings are going to reduce once you start Hogwarts. Feel free to join your friends in one of their groups if you’d like.”
“I thought you meant right then.” She sniffled, but didn’t cry, “I thought we were going to reevaluate at a later time. Maybe at Hogwarts.”
Harry decided that would work, just one more thing. “Can you call me Harry now?”
Harry brushed his thumbs over Draco’s face until Draco raised his eyes, “Then I’ll do the fighting Draco and you just hang onto me. Don’t let me go no matter what and we’ll get through this I promise.”
Shacklebolt looked beside himself, the veins in his head pounding as one. “Tell me you at least sent someone round to see if there were any truths to the allegations?”
“The bloke who wanted to annihilate muggles, that bloke?”
“Harry?”
Draco nodded without turning. He pulled down the blankets of his bed before he said; “Me too.”
“Can’t say I have Draco.” He felt himself relax along with Draco.
Harry nodded. “Yep, what he said.”
Harry didn’t know what he’d expected but with very little fanfare and a couple of signatures. He was a few unwanted and unneeded titles richer, even wealthier, and the owner of a gaudy ring. He turned it over in his hand before Draco nimbly nabbed it from his fingers.
She brought them around and laid the bundle on the bed.
“I trust you my dear but despairing times. So know, if this is given into any other hand but Draco’s it will return here and I will be most disappointed.”
Hermione quickly leaned in and whispered. “Yes it is and yes I knew. Through Malfoy,” she paused, “the younger,” she amended, “must not know too much about it, because if he had, he would have surely rubbed it in our faces earlier.”
“Shh,” she leaned back, “I know darling,” she grabbed a blade.
Tawy tilted her head with a cold smile. “Further investigation will not be necessary your honor. My office has officially dismissed him with a complete loss of benefits.”
Ginny shook her head and looked away when he considered her for help. She seemed angry about something; her words had been biting all morning. Percy shrugged sadly. Bill mouthed, ‘leave him,’ and so Charlie did, but he still didn’t like it. He hadn’t even seen George and, well damn, he hadn’t seen George yet, still at the shop. Mum hadn’t even left the kitchen, preparing for a feast from the sounds of it.
Part 14
There was a momentary pause and the click of china. “Draco has always been a difficult child, tenacious. I’ve always forced myself to remember that he was raised in near isolation, his parents the ruler of his every thought. He’d never attended a school until Hogwarts. He’d only had other children around very rarely and was taught to rule them. I dare say the child never had a real friend. I don’t think he’d know how to make one.”
Judge Fumeurs rubbed his chin, “But Madam, ultimately he did make those decisions.”
“Bastards,” Seamus hissed with feeling.
Draco sat up. He hadn’t been sure about Potter’s idea, until he spotted, “Hey is that soda?”
The clothes were light green and Draco wasn’t sure he had ever worn anything quite this color green before. Though he wore a lot of green, it was his favorite color after all. He picked at them for a few seconds. There were two things he could say for them, they were really soft, and the sleeves were long, which was of the utmost importance these days. The pants had a string through them at the waist and it took Draco a few seconds to figure how that was supposed to go, but in all they were warm and soft. So, while he wouldn’t dare wear them in public or even the manor proper. He might get away with wearing them in his private rooms, with the doors locked and charmed. He wished the healer would hurry up. He was running out of ways to distract his thoughts. He straightened off the bed at the sound of the knock and thanked the good timing as he said, “come in.”
Harry chuckled with a shrug, cause that might have even been true. He didn’t offer to tell them how that had happened and was happy they didn’t ask. It wasn’t something he liked to think about, well it sorta wasn’t. “We also had to be partners in nearly every class we shared, every-damn-year. I don’t know how often one of us grabbed the wrong wand from the table and used it to adjust something.”
“None.”
Harry’s grinned, “She’s like my saving grace. She’s never doubted me. She never ran away. Never had to love me but she does and did, even when it made life so much harder for her.”
“I can’t stay,” Draco bit his lip and looked towards the Great Hall, “I just can’t. I’m done with the lot of them.”
“I was scared,” the girl nearly shouted back.
Ben lit up with wretched glee. “Oh yeah, that’s cool as fuck. What’s it like?”
Harry scoffed. “Never,” he brushed a lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Braid?”
Tawy shook her head, with a chuckle at herself, “No, I imagine not. Fine, here’s the forms allowing me to make a one-time withdraw from your accounts. Fill them out and I’ll get your money here. Remember do not go anywhere near the wizarding world, it could be dangerous.” She closed her eyes and bobbed her head, checking her mental check list and trying to make sure she had everything covered. Draco nudged Harry and they made their way to the counter, where Draco quickly filled out his paperwork and then Harry’s, nudging him to sign his name, “Alright, be back by tomorrow at noon.”
with him. It’s always more with Malfoy. I don’t think Harry would settle for just mates, anyone else yes, but not Malfoy.”
Potter wandered into the room.
She took a puff. “As you know from group, my mom liked to jinx me. I’m glad I’m not at home anymore, but I’m done being here.”
Teddy hadn’t really understood the secrecy until his 1st homework assignment on the ‘Hero of the World and the Youngest Death Eater’. Then he’d understood why they hid. If anything their infamy had only grown since their disappearance. Girls in his class went ga-ga over who was hotter the hero or the bad boy. The hype and attention given to the idea of them was ridiculous. The merchandising was insane. Someone-somewhere was making a lot of money off his brothers.
“You’re an idiot,” Hermione patted him on the back, “can’t be helped.”
They got into another cab, “Bond Street.”
Harry was nearly vibrating next to him and Draco took a hit of the joint and handed it to him. He watched Harry inhale, before looking back to her. “Is there something you want us to say?” His voice was soft but without hesitation and it made the others shift in their seats.
Tawy moved towards the observation room’s door and didn’t seem to pay attention to the three teens who followed her until Mandy’s, “holy fuck,” reminded her they were there. She glanced towards them but didn’t send them away. “I’ll need you all to be quiet.”
Belinda gave Draco’s arm the same study, the placement and sigil were the same, the only difference being these lines were emerald green. These sigils were simply lovely. Had it been anyone else, she would have asked to keep the pictures Tawy took of them. She leaned away and joined Tawy to the side of boys, “You were right to call.”
“They wanted to protect you Draco, because they love you, but they wanted to use you too. They thought they were capable of doing both and they were fucking wrong.” Blaise ended with passion tinging his raised voice. He seemed slightly embarrassed but didn’t take back.
Mandy waved a hand towards the floor, “you’ll have to get someone to clean the dance floor, all that drool is gonna cause an accident.”
Ok, Mandy could totally see what Ella had been going on about when Harry smiled. She didn’t even know Draco could smile, but when he did, she looked away. There was no damn way she was going to blush, but yeah, she could see it.
“17.” Draco replied.
Since the beginning of the trials, Harry had often wondered whose portraits lined the walls of the great room. As this wasn’t a courtroom he was familiar with, but since they’d always been empty Harry figured he was destined never to know. He had figured wrong. Every portrait was now occupied. There were a couple he recognized, such as Phineas Black and Dumbledore, who winked at him.
Everyone else laughed as well, except for Draco, who looked around, “what?”
The official gave a short bob of his head before he quickly left the room. Seconds later, he was back, holding the door, as Judge Fumeurs brought the room back to order with a wave of his hand. A Healer entered the courtroom. She walked forward with a strong gait, which stirred her robes with sharp flicks. Her iron grey streaked hair caught the light as she moved, and Harry smiled with recognition, Healer Tawy.
Tawy sighed, straightened her shoulders, and met Mrs. Tonks’ stare. “I know it.”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry was quick to reassure her.
Draco agreed as well, figuring he didn’t really have a choice and that seemed the best compromise he could hope for.
“Good,” George nodded, “that’s good. I, ah, I just wanted you to know. I don’t blame you. You didn’t, it wasn’t you, that held the wand that, well, you know.”
Mandy scowled. Her plan would never come around if they never left their room. She had worked hard, had worked Tawy hard to even get her to agree.
She pulled the paper from her pocket and handed it over. She thought maybe they’d do better knowing exactly what everyone had seen.
Ron looked up at her and smiled.
HPHPHP
“Yeah, sure.” Rey jumped up and brought back a bag of original crisps and two cokes.
Tawy blinked in surprise. Bear rarely showed interest in the children as his pursuits ran towards apprehension, but she nodded, “Of course, Bear.” He had taken an interest in the Potter boy as well. She didn’t know if that was a reason for added concern or not.
“I reinstated Sirius Black as a member of the Noble House of Black.”
“Well it sucks.” Harry told her. “They all thought they had more rights to us than we did to ourselves.”
She looked around. The only table occupied was a room away and by a nurse who was 130 if she was day and didn’t care. She sighed, “Yes Murphy, it is.”
Harry boggled at the total, but Draco put it on his card without blinking. Harry vowed not to say a word, it was worth it for Draco’s happiness. He also vowed to pay Draco back half of the ridiculous amount. He dropped his new sunglasses over his eyes and followed Draco to Channel. Where he took another seat with Violet and Mandy. “It shouldn’t be long here.” Harry offered, as he took the drink offered to him.
Harry’s fingers reached out and wrapped around Draco’s, “Yeah, that. I know exactly how he feels about me. He’s just there.” Harry grinned, “I like it.”
Harry grabbed the coke, grinned at the red label and popped it open. He handed it Draco. “Here, drink this.”
“Harry, isn’t she the healer that saw to you?” Hermione whispered. Harry agreed.
“Isn’t that what I said?”
Tawy tapped her bracelet. “Really, I’d never noticed before. Mandy it’s an hour early.”
“Healer Tawy Robertoun, 42-year veteran of pediatric healing. I have recently accepted the appointment of lead consultant in child abuse cases for the Ministry. A position awarded to me based on my extensive work, as Head of the Merlin Institute outside of Paris, in both pediatric mind healing and physical maladies.”
Draco studied Andromeda, taking a slight step back at the sight of her. Harry could practically see him trying to work out if it was Bellatrix and his relief when he realized it wasn’t. Having worked this out and not sure who she was, Draco dismissed her and looked his mother’s way, as Tawy announced. “My apologizes your Honor, he’s still groggy from the potions. Though he is fully able to comprehend, his body hasn’t quite caught up to him yet.”
She looked to him, but he was concentrated on the heart.
Lucius leaned into his solicitor, the man’s eyes widened, and he exchanged furious whispers with his client. Lucius remained unmoved no matter how many times his defender shook his head. When Lucius leaned back the man sighed and called out, “Your Honor, Lord and Madam Malfoy plead no contest to any charge relating to their son, on the contingency their son is put through no more upset or questioning.”
“What you should be thankful for is that the H.A isn’t a muggle born or a wizard whose spent time in the muggle world like Tawy has.” Rey commented. “So how does the ‘get Potter and Malfoy high so we can pick their brains’ plan work exactly?”
They sat quietly for a moment. Harry thought about going back to his own bed, but it was so nice. As much as touch bothered him, he was also touched starved. The whole thing made for a horrible circle of disgust and want and just sitting next to someone, who didn’t make him feel that disgust, was bloody brilliant.
Ginny swallowed thickly, holding back her heartbreak, “We were done after our last talk, weren’t we? It was just me hanging on.”
“And now, when we’re no longer needed, they cast us off here.” The longer he thought about it the more bitter Draco became about the whole situation.
“That’s stupid.” Harry announced.
After sentencing there was a pause as the court official returned and spoke in soft tones to the Judge’s. Within the courtroom, people whispered furiously to each other and the reporters worked furiously to keep their public satisfied. The Malfoy’s conferred with their solicitors.
“They mentioned going to back to Hogwarts in group,” Murphy pressed. He glanced around room and leaned forward, his voice low, “Is that happening?”
She watched them, between checking the door, people on the dance floor gave them room and watched them with interest. At first Harry had been pretty dismal but once he started moving with Draco he was pretty damn good.
Arthur rubbed his wife’s shoulder and sadly shook his head, “there is a difference between caring for your child because he is your child and caring for him because he carries your line.”
“Hogwarts,” Harry offered, drawing something that might be the start of a steeple.
“Do you have your wand?” Tawy looked from Molly to him.
“Moving on,” Murphy quickly curbed the topic of evil traits. “Who wants to talk about a trigger they’re working though?” He turned to Harry and Draco, “We’re talking about when bad memories are ‘triggered’ by sights, sounds, smells or even feelings. Triggers throw you into a bad memory and cause intense reactions, like a raised heart rate, sweating and panic.”
Harry sat up, stretching a little. “We weren’t supposed to survive, and they treated us that way. It didn’t matter what they did to us because we had an expiration date. Those ‘famous’ wizards and witches, you were all so eager to hear about. They were powerful and scary and, more often than not, they didn’t give a shit what damage they were doing to us as long as they got their way!” Harry glanced at Draco then away, blinking as he was unable to hold back the dark thoughts. Sirius had been the only one to ever offer him an out, the only one to pull him aside and tell him to forget this shit and run.
Hermione nodded, “Fine. Let’s get going, the club is muggle, so remember that.”
“My parents love me.” Draco announced, daring anyone to say different.
Mandy walked down to the street and Violet followed. They stood silently.
“I figured you’d be explaining things to me all day.”
“They need it more.” Clara announced. She turned back to Harry and met his eyes. “
“No but don’t worry, we’ll buy everything we need, really, we’re fine.” Harry tried to reassure her. He didn’t understand why she looked concerned.
At first Ron had been terrified. Hermione arrested in a foreign country so far from home and any help. Then the platitudes from the Ministry had arrived, they were sending help, it was all a big misunderstanding and then he had laughed for Hermione’s sake. Trying to downplay this and trying to get her to laugh with him during his visits. He hoped she wasn’t as worried as he was, and he was worried. He spent hours walking their hotel room for two, now one.
She shrugged, “Perhaps, perhaps not, but we could have at least discussed it. Draco, are you alright?”
She swallowed thickly and straightened, but her voice was full when she could finally say, “No, you will not need to testify.” She blinked back her tears, “I’m sorry and not just for this, all of it. You should have the basic expectancy of privacy.”
She pushed it away, “I’ve already read it.”
Harry pressed his leg against Malfoy’s, taking strength from Malfoy letting him. “She’s right,” the Healer quickly looked towards Harry, so did everyone else. Harry shrugged. “She is. How many of you have cast the unforgivables or had them cast on you?”
Mandy sat up and her eyes caught on an advertisement, “I know what we should do.”
Harry refolded the paper and handed it back to her without a word.
Harry shook his head. “You didn’t. I’m sorry. You know that right?”
Harry shrugged. “Minor detail.”
Mandy glared at the redhead, “don’t tell me you wouldn’t want that kind of magic? Everyone would want it. Think of how much that magic would’ve helped us before we ever got here. Hell if we had that kind of power we wouldn’t be here!”
She sat heavily at the end of the bed, “One the aurors broke his code of conduct. He spoke to a reporter.”
Slightly dazed, Draco wondered if they even had an Auror who gave out broom tickets. The threat worked though the Auror dropped his arm like it was living death. Draco didn’t dare look down but he could and did look slightly to the Healer’s left, so he didn’t meet her eyes, “no one is going to go into your memories, Draco. No one is going to hurt you. We’re just going to take a look at you.”
People moaned and groaned (the reporters loudly). Judge Fumeurs scowled and raised his wand and silence reined, “the spell remains in effect until you leave my courtroom and for those of you not in the know, there are serious protections against any type of spying.  Now I’ll thank you all to
Harry was more than happy to. He halfway listened as Clara stumbled through a story about her mother’s love of stinging hexes, which sounded better than his Aunt’s love of pans honestly. Clara reminded him a lot of Luna with her long blonde hair and odd color choices. Clara trailed off and Murphy spoke to her, while the others gave some feedback, which led into Ella talking. Harry couldn’t have remembered any of it under hex really. It didn’t sound nice; none of it, but Harry found himself just glad he didn’t have to say anything. He didn’t want people to think he was trying to one up them.
“For us?” Harry had no problems taking Draco with him, the sooner the Weasleys got used to it the better, but, “you’re going with?”
“And it’s been roughly 20 minutes from the moment the alarm went off till my arrival?”
Ben knocked loudly.
Harry nodded. He understood, “If you think they would treat you badly. I wouldn’t let them.” If anyone was going to give Malfoy hell it was him and maybe Hermione and Ron, maybe. Mostly he didn’t want Malfoy to go to France.
“No,” Tawy raised a hand, “I would rather you didn’t.”
“I’m afraid not,” she paused, thought it over and then went with her gut, “they haven’t awoken yet.”
Draco nodded. “I am, I really am. Terribly. I’m bloody awful. I can’t do this.”
“But you never said how long,” Draco threw in.
Maybe it was the tone of her voice or the fact that he knew her so well, but he didn’t stop as he said. “We know Hermione. We’ve read it all.” They reached the table and Harry put down the tray and turned to her. “And it doesn’t matter, because for the first time in my life. I’m happy.” He laughed, “Really happy. I’ve never even felt this way before. I didn’t know people could feel this way, and they’re not going to take this away from me.” Harry dropped into his seat and nudged Draco, who turned from where Pansy was regaling them with Killsmen’s latest adventure in lifechanging destruction.
Harry nodded with a smile. “I get it.”
“In time.” Tawy answered. “Now anything else?”
“They stood there, just stood there, and did nothing.
Violet looked concerned. “Sure, but it’s expensive.”
“Of that I have no doubt.” Neville smiled as they wandered towards the trio.
Harry tapped the bracelet. “We have another group in a half-an-hour.”
Bear looked down at the whimper and watched the small form flinch from him. Bear bit his lip and cursed himself remorseful, pained at causing the boy distress. “Sorry little one, not going to hurt you.” He stepped away from the bed and tucked his wand away. “Sorry Tawy, I didn’t mean to frighten him.”
“Thank you, so kind, you arse.” He nudged Draco with his shoulder. Draco nudged back. “How come you don’t mind me touching you?”
Harry shrugged with a frown. “Yeah so, he did.” He didn’t care what anyone said, he knew how to fight with Malfoy and he knew when Draco had released his wand with a toss it was given and not won.
Draco looked to Tawy. “May we leave, please.”
Draco folded his legs, sitting forward. “Go ahead Potter. I don’t understand this fascination for my hair, missing Granger?”
They hadn’t even had a chance to sit, before a breathless voice called out, “Harry!”
“Does that always happen when you get upset?” Ella looked between the corner and Harry. She wasn’t sure this sort of thing was worth the Potter name.
Rey closed his book, “Really?”
Harry blinked. He’d known it had been too easy to get Draco’s wand. “I knew it. You practically threw it at me.”
Ron shrugged, “I wouldn’t have known what he was going on about to care.”
Murphy waved her back and quickly approached, still holding them off with a raised hand, he looked into the room. He leaned back pale and shaken, “Dear Merlin. Where’s Tawy?”
George felt the relief roll over him and smiled, “Yeah, I think you do.” He released the shield.
Harry frowned. “Barely, it’s not a big deal,”
Harry shook his head, “how did we miss that?”
“Masters?”
“Lestrange’s gonna get the kiss,” Ella sat down across from her, grabbing a magazine to glance at, “Everyone knows it. People are really pissed off. They’re like calling for blood.”
George blinked and tried a smile, “Hi Nev.”
Draco sniffled and was not going to cry. “If she loves me Harry, why didn’t she save me?”
Teddy shrugged. “You guys were in the Outback when the big ones came out.” Teddy snorted, “I went in a group. The girls fought for weeks afterwards about which of you was hotter.”
“About.”
“Nearly.”
“Interesting,” the sigil had clearly been carved, just below the inside of his elbow. It was no longer bleeding, looked healed even. The lines were very fine, delicate and silver. It was well done, a lovely piece of magic. It was always an academic pleasure to see blood magic applied by such powerful wizards. Belinda stood back and gestured towards Draco, “if you’d roll his sleeve please and turn his arm over. I’d rather not touch His Grace if I don’t have to. I’ve been informed of his distaste for touch.”
“Harry,” and that sounded nice until, “but then I’d forget Remus and Sirius.”
Mandy laughed. “Yeah, sorry, but they really did need a break.”
Rey sighed. “You know most of that stuff is rubbish.”
Harry frowned, “He used an illegal spell.”
Knock-knock
Draco pulled the one hair that had caught in the Black ring free. “Why didn’t you ever claim the Potter title?”
“Tawy’s letting us leave for a night?” Harry wasn’t sure he was hearing right. Draco looked as surprised as he was sure he did.
She blushed flustered and then blinked at Draco’s subzero stare. “Ah, of course, my apologies.”
Draco didn’t look to sure, so Harry pressed. “When can we see them or owl?”
Madame Tonks had done Draco an incredible service. He wouldn’t be here at all if he hadn’t been brought to her attention and Tawy was ever so grateful. Draco was a magnificent child. So intelligent and powerful and she’d almost lost the opportunity. She couldn’t imagine things would have gone so easily with Harry without him. She called them over just after they decided an ancient medical device was a magical banana peeler.
“A knife,” Romilda repeated softly. She looked to Harry with sad eyes, “not going to hurt yourself, are you Harry?”
Tawy nodded. “And he was raised by death eaters, his go to spells are going to be different than most other people. I promised him, no one would send him to Azkaban and I meant it Harry. He’s not in trouble.”
“And I’m not going to say anything that will help anyone hurt them.”
“I believe it,” she felt so badly for them, bad enough to take the risk. “Shite, they don’t have their wands, what if,”
Draco was exceedingly happy his family could afford a private potion’s brewery, ingredients, and storage.
“Why would you want to stay under someone else’s control?” Rey sounded so incredulous it was almost pained.
Ron took a bite with a gleeful relish, “either, both? Hell all 3?” Harry put his sandwich down with a frown. For some reason, the thought of Draco Malfoy’s memories being forcible searched really bothered him. He tried to tell himself it was because of how he might be seen through Malfoy’s memories. Though he had already gone over the bathroom incident with the Minister and there wasn’t anything else he had to actually worry about. He glowered at his chips and picked at one or two before he said, “I don’t know. They were just so two-sided. One minute helping us, the next Voldemort, who knows?” Harry wished it was all over with, though thinking of Malfoy in Azkaban didn’t seem right.
Ella gasped in mock anger. “Don’t be angry cause I’m going to marry rich and no one would have you.”
“Fluff!” Mandy greeted the barn owl, which looked down on them from her perch. She chirped a greeting and came to Mandy’s raised arm.
reporters whispering to their viewers about who exactly Madam Andromeda Tonks was.
“Couldn’t care less.” Draco finally relaxed, settling next to Harry. Whatever this stuff was, it was one muggle thing Draco was adopting.
Tawy blink rapidly, she maybe an old hand at this, but it still stung when children were honestly surprised and disbelieving that anyone could be proud of them.  “Very much so. You were able to hang on until you were somewhere safe to let go. You did your best not to hurt anyone. Merlin yes, I’m proud.”
HDHDHD
George loosened his hold and stepped back. “Sorry, I’m in the middle of developing some new things for the shop.” It was partly true. He looked past Harry to Draco and Tawy, he nodded towards Tawy, but stepped closer to the other boy. “Hey Draco, you doing alright?” His hand hoovered about shoulder level but didn’t touch.
HPHPHP
Even after their time there, Mandy was the only one the group who really spoke to them. The rest stood around awkwardly, sometimes adding something to what Mandy said, but never really talking directly to them.
Draco brushed his hand over his sleeve. Even Murphy’s eyes followed the gesture.
Hermione had always been slightly jealous of Harry’s ease with balancing though not how he’d gained the skill. “Harry,”
Healer Kelly looked confused, “Survivors of rape or sexual abuse.”
Draco was resigned. He’d known he wouldn’t be allowed to go free. He glanced towards Potter and knew the other boy would not take this well. He hoped Potter threw a fit for the both of them.
Hermione nodded. “It was the right call.”
Hermione grinned. “Yes, but they’re masses you know. Draco, Pansy and Blaise are here. They are so sorry they weren’t here that last year. They’re dying to make it up to you.” At their looks she added, “we got close after graduation, when Blaise dated Luna.”
Harry nodded and made sure he paid for lunch.
“Draco?”
Harry frowned. He’d forgotten about the whole new year of students. “Damn.” At Hogwarts the other kids wouldn’t have any real fear to keep them in check. They’d feel free to attack Draco. Harry frowned, well that wasn’t on, he’d have to put that to rights as soon as he got back.
Harry was glad he wasn’t the only one to jump. He looked down to the house elf, twisting the dish towel it held.
“Hogwarts,” Draco answered.
Harry nodded. “Mine and Malfoy’s. I was going to give it back.”
“Who?” Ella leaned forward.
“Ahem.”
“Of course,” Tawy assisted, moving the other bed away from Draco. Now unimpeded, the Ministry’s Blood Magic specialist, Belinda, kneeled down, “no knife found?” She took Harry’s wrist and carefully turned it over.
“Yes Healer.”
with Harry being involved.”
“I know.”
Harry opened the door to their room, looking around as he entered, a habit he’d picked up and hadn’t put down after the war. Once he was sure the room was clear, he turned his back to it and continued walking backwards, “I wasn’t kidding Draco. You can be scary. I love that about you.”
Mandy shrugged. “Potter, I don’t know how.”
Even given all that, in these unsure times, there was no way to be certain an infant would even pan out. What if it was another Narcissa? What if he perished before being able to instruct the child? What if the child perished? There would be no time for a third. There was a good chance, if he died before the child reached majority, Narcissa would cut it from his will regardless of his wishes.
Harry thought maybe both he and Malfoy should be cut a little slack. They’d had a Dark Lord breathing down the back of their necks a majority of the time. Besides they usually took the most damage out on each other, which was rather sad, now that he thought back on it.
Neville clutched the deluminator, under the table, where it wouldn’t be seen.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, “Are you scared?”
Mandy glanced down the page. “Supposedly the Ministry documented it, based off testing done by Albus Dumbledore.”
If Lucius hadn’t been under house arrest, Tawy would have certainly chosen to meet elsewhere. She didn’t press them, waiting patiently, if they chose not to go in, she wouldn’t make them.
“Lucius do be careful, you nearly gorged me.”
“That doesn’t make you a bad son, it makes you human. They hurt you, allowed you to be hurt, and didn’t protect you as they should have. It’s okay to be angry.”
“I can’t believe you’re here. What are you doing here?” He took Draco’s hand, squeezing softly, hoping to cut off Draco soft mutterings about Vane’s personage.
She paled and dropped into her seat with a startled nod.
Draco rubbed the material on his leg, “soft.”
“Great,” Pansy sighed, “then what do we do with it?”
He nodded and didn’t see the cause for celebration, he could plainly see the girl had followed his wife in. “I see.” Though why he’d care or the reason for Narcissa’s excitement was beyond him.
Everyone looked their way and Harry crossed his arms and looked down. Next to him, Draco scoffed. “Don’t look at me. I only died the once and it wasn’t because of an unforgettable.”
“Harry, Draco, thank you for joining us. Please take your seats and we’ll get started. In the effort to save time, let’s remember the privacy hex I spoke of last group. Now, who’d like to start?”
They worked with spells they knew wouldn’t make Tawy’s eyes widen or want to talk about where they had learned it. Between their work with Tawy, the training room, or just talking, they realized just how utterly different their magical training was in comparison to everyone else’s. The extra lessons, the time they’d spent outside of school, the mentors they’d had, it all added up and separated them from others their age even more.
Kingsley glanced at the Malfoy’s but based his attention on Molly and Andromeda. “The Ministry was very insistent on this course of action. I hope in time you will see and we will prove this was the right thing to do for both Harry and Draco.”
“Yeah, I guess his lessons weren’t total shite. I used to listen in on my parents, but nothing like that.”
A guard leaned in, “Ms. Granger’s barristers have arrived.”
Tawy leaned forward, pausing until she caught and held Minerva’s eyes, “I need you to fully understand. The
Tawy wanted to say she was shocked but a blood rite with something to do with marriage wasn’t a far-off thought. It was the
Harry knew to everyone else they looked the personification of icy perfection. Heck, he heard some oh-ahs from around him and sounds of excitement from the press. However, to Harry’s practiced eye, gained from years of Malfoy watching, he noticed how Lucius’ eyes darted around and how he nearly outpaced his solicitor and had to pace himself. Behind him, Narcissa’s eyes were searching, her head tilted for a sound that she wasn’t finding. Her fingers flicked through her robes, a nervous gesture that Harry recognized from her son. The Malfoy’s were plenty nervous. It just wasn’t anything anyone else would notice. Nervous and Harry thought upset about something then he realized, they were looking for Draco.
“Oh.” Mandy didn’t know what to say. She wasn’t sure what the deal was. “You might want to go get ready. We can’t make Violet late for work.”
McGonagall dabbed at her face discreetly and took a couple of deep breaths, “You know I never agreed with what you were asked to do. You or Mr. Malfoy, you were both horribly mistreated.”
“They lost control!” Ben heaved out, bent over and trying to catch his breath after his run to search everywhere for Tawy.
Minerva straightened in her seat, “are you suggesting they’re dangerous?”
“Trust me,” Harry smiled grimly, “I have experience. When it’s the papers there’s no getting around everyone learning it.”
Tawy stood, “You’ve both worked very hard during our time here so far and I appreciate it. I think we’re making real progress.  Don’t worry about wand time, you’ll both still be able to take part.”
She waited patiently.
“Well now you know why they were in your group,” she glanced around the library.
There were about 30 kids in the room but the whole lot went quiet when they entered. Harry scowled but didn’t let it stop him.
Rey was waiting in the hall by their door, red faced and pacing, he let out a relived breath when he saw them. He made to move towards them, but glanced at the nurse’s station and stopped. Even though none of the nurses were even looking his way, all staring at Harry and Draco, he felt like they all knew he had the knife. Rey couldn’t hand it off in the hall, but it felt really weird following them into their room. He didn’t know what he’d expected but their room was plain and looked like every other room. It was kind a disappointing.
“You’d best spit it out man as I’ve got the Judge and sundry roaring to go.”
“We’ll pay of course and don’t worry about feeding us we’ll pay for that too.”
Tawy quickly nodded, “of course, yes.” She received their wands and carefully pocketed them as the boys took off at a near run. She waited until they were gone before she turned on her colleagues.
Coming in so late meant Harry had missed putting together what was going on beforehand. He saw Andromeda and her solicitors ahead, standing together at the right, before the judge’s station. There had been a table with five seats transfigured to the left, where Hermione said they were putting the Malfoy’s and their solicitors. Harry was rather glad they had gotten rid of the tying chair. As due to the sheer number of people accused, the chair had been set aside to allow whole families to be sentenced at once.
