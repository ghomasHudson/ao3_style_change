All Harry knew was that things had been moving too fast since he woke up the day before. Harry turned his head up to stare up at the starlit canopy and sighed, closing his eyes. He was almost sure that Draco could read his every thought in his eyes when they were staring at each other just now. Then he felt a pressure on his chest when he felt Draco shift beside him. Opening his eyes and looking down, he saw that Draco had shifted his head to lie on his chest instead of the pillow. He didn't know what to do except bring his right hand up and placing in it lightly on Draco's neck, playing with Draco's hair. Strangely he was comfortable in this position.
"What? That git is going to sleep in our room? Protect him, my foot. I hope he…ow…" Ron stopped suddenly as Hermione nudged him very painfully with her elbow.
Silence reigned again at the stands where the two boys were sitting as both sat back to watch the team practice, with a pair of brown eyes staring at a particular chaser with a tinge of admiration in his eyes.
"I… no… just that I thought… Dean is straight." He frowned and quickly walked towards their room. "I'm going to unpack." He said as he went through the door.
He stood up and raised his hands for silence in the Great Hall. The students quickly quieted down and looked at him. "I know you are all hungry, but there is an announcement I have to make. Last night, we found three students guilty of assault and rape of another student. The three guilty parties are Pansy Parkinson, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe from Slytherin. Their reason for committing the crime was because they were under the orders of Voldemort to do it. Their punishment was to be stripped of all magical abilities and to be sent to the muggle prison for fifteen years. They have been expelled from Hogwarts and banished by the wizarding laws. I will not tell you who the victim is, but should you happen to know the victim personally, please be kind to the victim as the victim will need your help and understanding in the near future. With this, enjoy your dinner." With that statement, he sat down and food appeared on all the tables. The noise level went up as everyone was discussing about the issue and Blaise and Millicent looked at each other when they realized that they were the only Slytherin seventh years left. They quickly finished their dinner and left the hall as they found that their juniors were curious about their former roommates and made their way to their own dorm room for some peace.
"Another thing you need to note is that should anyone attack from the door, the girls are to make their way here. Everyone, look here," Sirius said, as he went to the wall Draco's and Harry's beds were leaning against and used his wand to tap a brick right in the centre of the wall, opening a panel that is large enough for one person to pass though at a time. "When you pass through this panel, just make sure that the last person pull the panel close. Just walk along the passageway and it will open to one of the secret rooms of this castle. Only Professor Dumbledore knows the location of that room. Once you reach there, stay there. When the attack is over Professor Dumbledore will go and fetch you. In that room, a map similar to the Marauders' Map is on one of the walls. Use that to monitor the situation within the castle. Should the map show that the castle has been taken under control of Voldemort, use the fireplace in the room to get out of the castle completely. That fireplace is well stocked with Floo Powder. Floo to somewhere neutral, like the Leaky Cauldron. Do NOT Floo to the Burrow. It's too obvious. If you choose the Leaky Cauldron there is the chance that Voldemort can't find you once you get into muggle London. Attempt to lose yourself in the crowd so that the Death-eaters can't find you. If you reach that stage, do not trust anyone anymore other than the eight of you here. You need to know how to protect yourself. Understand?" When Sirius finished his instructions, everyone slowly nodded, digesting his instructions. Many of them, like Neville, Seamus and Dean were very pale as they realized the seriousness of the matter.
At the stands, with the dog guarding his wand, he started warming up. However, he thought that since Sirius was there, and even though he couldn't communicate as a dog, then Harry could just talk and ramble.
"Now, that's the grin I'm used to seeing, but somehow did not get to see it all week. What happened to it?" Draco asked, using his hand to tilt Day's face up to look at him.
Harry happily stared up at the canopy of stars again, trying to get his breath back and to cool his arousal down.
"Ron, you do know that the prefects are going to hate the Head Boy and Girl this year. Both are SO hardworking. And most of the prefects are really lazy. I know from experience. Slytherins prefects are notorious for being unapproachable. I had a good year last year with the first years quivering whenever I walked past their group. It was so hilarious." Draco joked.
"Then it's my fault too. I knew two years ago that I shouldn't get attached to people as they would be targeted for revenge. It is as much my fault as anyone else." Harry softly said, but in the silent room, it sounded unbearably loud. He gave Draco a soft kiss on his lips.
When the whole group was ready for breakfast, they all journeyed down to the Great Hall for breakfast, with the Quidditch players dressed in their crimson Quidditch robes. They entered the Hall to cheering from the rest of their house. As Harry sat down, he glanced up to the staff table and the missing black dog and Professor Lupin reminded him that they left the night before on a mission for the headmaster. Since today was a Saturday and the next day was Halloween, with the students returning home on Monday morning, they were able to leave for their mission early. Harry was disappointed that Sirius would have to miss his match, but Dumbledore stressed the importance of leaving early, and Harry had no say in the matter. He just hoped that the two of them were safe on their mission.
Draco nodded, and answered "Yes, Professor. Thank You." Upon hearing that she strode back to the blackboard to start her lesson.
Harry then mentally used the lubricating spell on his own hard-on and withdrew his fingers, while lining his cock up at the hole. Draco moaned when he realized that Harry was finally going to enter him, and relaxed himself, lifting his knees to his chest as much as possible, so as to make it easier for Harry to enter him. Harry slowly pushed the head of his cock into Draco's ass, and then found himself sinking into Draco's warmth, as his cock was being gripped by Draco's muscle. When he was fully in Draco, he paused, staring down into Draco's eyes, with love twinkling down at Draco from his eyes. Draco never felt more complete and content as in that moment, and he pulled Harry down to kiss him again. Harry then started to move within Draco, stroking Draco's desire as both of them moaned from the pleasure of the action. Tanned and pale skin became slick with the perspiration from their actions as both of them became more and more frenzied for the peak of the pleasure.
The rest of the time was spent chatting on other stuff, while Remus refused to tell the others what he is teaching them this year for DADA, wanting them to know only when they turn up for the class. Sirius was talking to Seamus and Dean about Quidditch and Ginny and Hermione were discussing about the issues they can bring up for the prefect meeting. The only people who were quiet were Harry and Draco, who were just sitting there thinking. They caught each other's eyes and Draco indicated that they should talk. Draco got up and went into their room, sitting on his bed. After a minute, Harry walked in, and came to a stop and leant on the post of Dean's bed, facing Draco.
"What's so secretive?" Seamus asked, grinning to hide the fact that being in enclosed space with Dean alone was affecting him.
"Oh SHIT… Seam…." Dean reached his hand down to touch Seamus' hair, trying to urge him to take more of himself into his mouth. Seamus' mouth was warm and moist and his tongue was stimulating the underside of his cock. "Seam… can't hold back…" Seamus seemed to suck harder upon hearing that and Dean felt a finger thrusting slightly into the entrance of his body, the sensation being so surprising and with the three months worth of wet dreams urging him on, his body exploded into orgasmic bliss.
To the three adults in the room, it seemed as if the boys were just waiting for the spell to hit them. Suddenly the spell hit the space about a meter in front of the boys and disappeared into nothing. Both boys then grinned as they saw that the wall stopped the spell. Draco's change of the texture of the wall caused the wall to absorb the power of the spell and since the shield was still linked to their magical powers, they could feel that small amount of power making its way to their power pool. They looked at each other when they realized the potential of the wall they have constructed together. If they were actually attacked at all sides, the type of wall they had just constructed would not only prevent the spells from reaching them, it would absorbed the energy of the spells and actually become their own energy.
Neville and Seamus were nearest to the door and restrooms. Dean was beside Seamus and Ron was beside Neville. Harry picked up his things and moved it to the inter-most bed beside Ron and Draco moved his things to the inter-most bed beside Dean's.
"What? That bitch!" Ron muttered the later part of the comment to himself. Harry smiled softly to himself as Draco turned to look at Ron in astonishment after hearing that. Ron's personality was such that his temper was very fiery, but once you gained his trust, he would defend you with his life. This was the reason why Harry felt that he was so lucky to get a friend he could depend on for protection. Draco then gave Harry a glance and saw that he seemed to expect that reaction from Ron as Harry went on eating without pause.
Draco Malfoy had been a rival of Harry's since first year when Harry rejected his hand in friendship, thinking arrogantly that he deserved a better friend than a person who made fun of people who were nice to him. From then on he had been against Harry in almost everything, from Quidditch to studies. The two of them were on par with their competition in their studies with Harry being better in Defense against Dark Arts classes and Malfoy being better in potions. Although they both lost out to Hermione, since she had the habit of studying about twenty hours per day and reading textbooks in the library for fun. The fights and quarrels between Malfoy and Harry were legendary in school and when one occurred, the whole hallway would freeze in position to watch the show. It was as if the two of them were performers. Harry once commented that if they actually charge admission to their fights and quarrels, he would be so rich that his family would not need to work for three generations. He often wondered what would have happen if he had accepted the offer then. Maybe he would have another best friend. Having more friends was better than having more enemies.
Hermione sat down beside Draco with a lunch basket. She then sent out some red sparks with her wand to Ron, indicating the arrival of lunch. "Torture is right. I don't know how long they will last before they collapse from exhaustion." Hermione scowled.
"Harry, you don't know how difficult it is for them. They see each other EVERY day in school last year. Then Herm went HOME for summer and Ron missed HER like mad. Then after SO long they finally get to see each other, BUT Mum watched them like a hawk! The rule in the house is that they are only allowed to hold hands! And Fred and George keep telling on them to tease Ron that they don't have any privacy in the two weeks she was there. Just let them snog for Merlin's sake!" Ginny explained the situation with an impish smile. Ron blushed even redder. Then Ginny turned to Harry. "If you are jealous, we can snog too, you know!" Ginny's grin got even bigger.
They all placed their bags at a corner table, and both Hermione and Draco pushed Harry into a seat and point a finger at him, warning him to stay in that seat while they went and get their books. When they were gone, Harry looked around. Since it was the second day of school and that most of the school was in classes, the three of them were the only people in the library, with the exception of the librarian, Madam Pince. The Hogwarts library surprisingly was very well-ventilated, with many windows opened to allow light and wind to come in. Harry stood up and walked to one of the windows and gazed out. From where he was standing, he could see Professor Hooch teaching a class of first years the right ways of handling a broom. He recalled the first time he was on a broom, up in the sky. Then he recalled the incident that caused him to get on the broom without permission, an incident that involved one Draco Malfoy.
"Finally. I thought they are never going to take the hint that they like each other." Neville said sitting down, pulling Ginny down onto his lap. Harry, Ron and Hermione turned to Neville in shock. Neville continued on. "Maybe we should add on the bet that Seamus ends up with Dean. Since everyone betted that he will end up with Harry, because they are both gay. No one took into the account that Dean may be bisexual." Ginny nodded. "Harry, can I choose the password for the first two weeks? I need to get use to the system." Harry nodded, still speechless with shock. "Come on, Ginny, let's go add on the bet. Something tells me that we'll win very soon. We'll tell you guys the password later." He got up with Ginny and went out of the panel together.
Harry woke up to the slight dipping of the bed. His eyes remained closed even though his body unconsciously tensed up. All he could hear was silence… till there was another slight dipping of the bed again. He opened his eyes slightly and saw that it was Day trying to crawl out of the bed that all three of them had shared the night before. She had chosen to sleep on the innermost side of the bed with Draco in the middle, and she was currently trying to crawl out of bed without waking the other two boys up. Harry shifted his leg slightly and Day froze, her eyes darting up to Harry's eyes. She then relaxed when she saw his open eyes. He gave her a nod and moved his legs for her to move out of the bed easier.
Draco nodded. "Dumbledore told me about it. Snape's a member. Sirius and Remus are too. What about it?"
"Morning." Day whispered. "I woke up. It's six. You two continue to sleep. I'll make sure no one disturb you." Day knew that the two boys normally spent Sunday mornings together in bed. She gave Harry a grin and scuttled off to her room.
Draco quickly took off his robe as well, pulled a t-shirt from his closet and combed his hair. "I'll join you." All Seamus did was to wait at the door for him. All three left their room, and went down to the Gryffindor common room.
Although Draco did not look like he was paying attention, he was paying attention to his game. Within the first ten minutes of the game he had already known what type of chess player Joseph was. He spent the time waiting for Joseph to make a move to look around the hall and to look up at the screen at how Ron was doing. From what he could see, Ron was doing quite well, as Jon underestimated Ron. Everyone assumed that Ron's fiery temper would be the type of style in which he played his chess, but they didn't know how wrong they were. Chess was very important to Ron, mainly because it was the only thing that his whole family lost out to him. Whatever Ron Weasley cares very much about, he would put his mind to it and not just his emotions. And from what he could see from the screen, he had just a few more moves before winning. Glancing at Ron, he caught Ron's eyes and silently nodded. Ron returned his nod. It's time to end the game.
Hearing Harry almost announcing his love for him to Ron and Hermione sent a feeling of being loved through Draco as he beamed up at his boyfriend. He sent that wave of emotion through their mind link and almost laughed out loud as Harry visibly shuddered and grinned down at him. Looking at the clock, he frowned as he saw that it was almost ten o'clock.
"Somehow I think today's game will be quite brutal, even if it is on our side. Even though the Slytherin team found totally unsuitable beaters after those two left. For Merlin's sake, that little squid they found couldn't even beat the bludgers during the first few practices that I watched. The seeker can't even catch golf balls well. I felt sorry for the team." Draco scowled with disgust when he remembered the recent practices that he spied on hiding under Harry's invisibility cloak. It was a complete waste of his time to watch a team suffering from the loss of their two beaters and trying to recover from the loss of their seeker as well.
Dean finally relaxed and sat there deep in thought. His erotic dreams had started during the summer. Before those dreams, he could safely say that he was as straight as Ron was, but after two weeks of waking up from wet dreams of Seamus and him making love, he stopped pushing away the thoughts that he liked Seamus. He actually had a secret sketchbook stashed in his trunk that was filled with images that he remembered from his dreams and had drawn upon waking up. He at first thought that it was just a phase but just now when he saw Seamus at the station, he wanted to kiss Seamus so badly that he almost couldn't stop himself. That's why he dragged Seamus in search of his other roommates thinking that if other people were around he should be able to control himself. However, seeing Seamus latched onto Harry was not a sight he wanted to see. He knew that Seamus had the habit of cuddling people be it boy or girl but found himself wanting to be in Harry's place. Thus when the opportunity arose, he decided to ask Harry.
Dean: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Intermediate Transfiguration, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Herbology
Harry wished that he could just lay there staring into Draco's grey eyes forever and be able to forget about everything out there. He wished that he could just forget about the evil overlord who wanted to kill him for the past fifteen or so years, just because he was born into that family. He wished that he was a muggle. But if he was a muggle he would not have the chance to meet Draco, fight with him for six years and become his friend. And be attracted to him when both are living in close quarters.
Note: There is an assault and rape scene at the end of the chapter, not involving the main 2 characters.
Dumbledore nodded, looking like he had aged ten years in the past ten minutes and turned back to Sirius. "Sirius, get Severus and Minerva to meet me at the entrance of the Slytherin dorm. Ask Severus to bring some Veritaserum." The dog ran out of the infirmary as Dumbledore left behind it.
Ron seemed to think for a while, trying to phrase his answer honestly. "Truthfully, I haven't really completely accepted it yet. There's still a lot of forgiving to do for all the insults you gave to the whole group of us. All I'm doing is putting the want of beating you up on hold because of the way Dumbledore phrased his words last night. I know that out of Harry, Herm and myself, I am what you consider as the extreme one. For me, it is normally just black and white. So in this You-Know-Who against Harry thing, if you had refused to join that evil bastard, then you must be on our side. After all, you did lose all your relatives due to that 'no' that you gave. For that I'm willing to give you a chance. And from last night till now, I haven't heard you really insult me yet. And also the fact that when Herm already okayed you, and if I don't, then… you know what I mean right?" Ron flushed and looked helplessly at Draco. Draco just grinned impishly and nodded. He then reminded himself to be extra nice to Hermione, since she seemed to be holding the leash in this relationship. "And I've heard Dean says that sports talk is universal. It doesn't matter if you are strangers or buddies, even enemies." Saying this, he noticed that they are nearing the Great Hall and his stomach grumbled.
"No… not nightmares. Definitely not nightmares like yours. Um… those TYPE of dreams." Harry finally found out that Dean could blush as red as Ron, because of the color that Dean's cheeks were presently.
The both of them had also used their free time to bond and learn new defense spells. Harry had come to treasure their free periods together, practicing the spells and discovering each other. One night in their second week together, Harry had woken up from a nightmare and could feel waves of comfort from the mind link they shared. He had gotten up from his bed to go to the washroom to wash his tears away, and coming back to his bed, he saw Draco sitting up in bed. Draco wordlessly beckoned to Harry and Harry crawled into Draco's bed to fall asleep in his arms. Since then, he had crawled into Draco's bed in the middle of the night numerous times and when Draco woke up from his own nightmares, he went in search of Harry in Harry's bed. Some weekends, they just randomly chose whose bed to sleep in so that they could wake up together on Sunday mornings. The bliss they felt waking up in each other's arms was something that they did not come in contact with before.
Harry reached out when he saw that Draco seemed to be in a panic and grasped Draco's wrist tightly. "Draco, listen to me. LISTEN. Voldemort does not know. You are not in anymore danger than you were before, yet. No death eaters will be that stupid to go to him and tell him that he's not the heir. I don't think your father knew. That's why he didn't say anything. Voldemort would never have guessed that the Malfoy family that was under his control for so long is in actual fact hiding the heir. Calm down. Take a deep breath." Harry said in a commanding voice. Draco took a deep breath and found him calming down. His mind started moving very fast, accessing the situation. Upon evaluation, he realized that Harry was correct. Nobody would be so stupid as to tell You-know-who the truth if they wanted to keep themselves alive. Voldemort, assuming that he himself was the Heir, would not attempt to order anyone to trace the Slytherin bloodlines. When he was positive that he had his emotions under control, he looked up at the rest, who were still staring at him.
Draco grinned, slinging his arm over Harry. "It is because I've got friends surrounding me for first time in my life. And that includes you, Neville." Everyone smiled at him.
"It's no use. If six years of nagging from us had no effect on her, what makes you think she will stop now?" Ron answered, while busy piling food on his plate.
"It means no more prefect meetings. No Quidditch too. That means I got more time. Maybe I should ask Professor Snape about the extra credit assignments." Draco frowned.
"Oh. You are here. We were expecting you but not so early in the morning." He smiled at the two of them as Draco and Harry calmly backed two steps, not knowing who the strangers are. Their bodies tensed up so as to be prepared for anything that might happen.
Draco breathed in deeply, trying to control himself when he heard the words that Day said. His eyes had went wide, at the thought that the girl thought that… she thought that they didn't want to be near her! All Harry did was kneel down next to her face, took her fingers in his palm and give her a soft kiss on her forehead.
In the bathroom, he brushed his teeth and washed his face with cold water so as to wake himself up. He wouldn't want to trip over his own feet when running just because he was too sleepy. Suddenly a pair of arms encircled his waist from behind and a hoarse 'Good morning' was spoken to the back of his neck. Harry grinned, recognizing who it was and said a 'Good morning' to Draco who he saw from the mirror was snuggling into his back like a cat.
"I have triple potions with him later." Draco affectionately grinned at Day. All three Gryffindors turned to him with astonishment.
Draco's eyes went misty, as he smiled at Harry. Harry felt Draco's happiness flood his whole body, as Draco bent down to drop a soft kiss on Harry's lips. "I love you too, Harry Potter." He then kissed Harry again. Harry used his tongue to lick Draco's lips, as he opened them, granting Harry entrance. Harry then touched his tongue to Draco's tongue as contentment washed over the two of them. Harry withdrew his tongue as they parted with their eyes wide.
"If you didn't throw that remembrall back in the first year, then I wouldn't be playing seeker now." Harry smiled at Draco. "Got the book?"
"We got to warn Malfoy." Harry said softly, afraid that if they can hear Pansy, then Pansy may be able to hear them now.
"You know, if I didn't know he's gay, I would be jealous." Harry softly said to Day. Everyone else at the table was talking to everyone else and no one heard his soft declaration except for Draco and Day.
"Ron, did you know that the wager is tilting towards Ravenclaws? They say that they are supposed to have the brains. And that Gryffindors have the tendency to just rush in, hence not good chess players. Obviously not many people remembered about your first year huh? They also forgot that Draco here is not a Gryffindor, but a Slytherin. Flatten them for me." Day grinned. Ron smiled back at Day.
"That's only because they know I appreciate the food they cook. And they loved to serve people." Ron grinned at Sirius.
"I don't know. You were the one who wanted me to come in here. To talk, I presume." Harry looked at Draco, amused. Draco laid down on the inner side of the bed, trying to make himself comfortable without kicking Harry. Harry, thinking only of Draco's comfort, decided to lean on the bed on his elbows alongside Draco on the outer edge of the bed. When he looked up, he realized that his face was just inches beside Draco's face. Draco was very amused by the fact that Harry blushed upon realizing what he unwittingly did.
"Draco, only you would think of scaring the first years as hilarious. Imagine they come into a school that they were not familiar with, and the prefects are so scary, you are going to scar them for life." Ginny frowned back at Draco, as she was a prefect for her year too. Just then Hermione came back to her seat.
"I knew you will get the post. Knew it six years ago when you were scolding me in Charms. Congratulations, love." Hermione beamed at her boyfriend. Everyone around was congratulating her. Hermione then quickly finished her dinner, went over to the Ravenclaw table to discuss the date for the first prefect meeting before going to the Hufflepuffs table to tell the prefects the meeting date. Terry then made his way to Blaise, the other Slytherin Seventh Year prefect and told him to pass the news to the prefects of his house. Draco shook his head.
"I have to admit that she's good. As Keeper and Captain, I bet that your people are going to have a good year huh? Your team was the only team not affected by the graduating batch last year." Draco clapped Ron on his back. Ron had managed to obtain the Keeper's position since Oliver Wood graduated, and Draco had to say that Ron was really good. After the Weasley twins co-captained the team to one more year of victory, Ron got the position as Captain of the team. The beaters were replaced by Colin and Dennis Creevy, who as brothers have the brotherly bond between them. Of course their seeker, Harry Potter, was one of the best seekers Hogwarts had seen in this century. "Now, Ron, there IS something I need to ask you about. How is it that… you can just ignore all that happened in the past six years and just… you know… for goodness' sake, we are talking about Quidditch as if we had been buddies! I know that Harry was forced to allow me into his little group here but…" Draco looked at Ron as he tried to phrase his question. He himself just couldn't get over the fact that he had been friendly with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley when he was so used to sneering and smirking at them.
"Because you are with Potter. And Potter always knows when things happen." Blaise huffed with exasperation.
"Guess what happened last night. You know Dean and Seamus? Seamus was in love with Dean for ages, but Dean finally noticed recently. Yesterday Seamus was talking about fooling around again, and the next moment, Dean's face went pale and everyone in the room was frowning at Dean. He then called Seamus over and put a silencing spell around their bed. This morning when I woke up, Dean wasn't in his bed. Guess that couple is finally getting settled." Harry looked up at Sirius and saw the dog looking like he was grinning. Harry debated telling Sirius about Draco and him. He then decided that his godfather already missed so many events in his life, he would be the first to know about Draco. "Oh, and Sirius. I lost my first kiss last night." He grinned when he saw the ears of the black dog suddenly perked up and its eyes grew big. The next moment, Sirius was back in his human form, settling down comfortably, grinning.
Thomas’ head quickly shifted to face the ground and his feet that were previously spread apart in a manly stance slowly manoeuvred close together.
“You can’t do that, it’s immoral!” Granger snapped, Weasley trying to pull her back into his shoulder. “How did you even get Veritaserum?”
The healer continued her whispers of comfort and after a few minutes, Draco’s small trills went to wheezy cries and then shaky breaths.
Friday morning was uncharacteristically normal. There were no ruckuses on the stairs nor arguments about seating arrangements in Charms. Draco managed to mill around the castle pretty much undetected all morning, nobody had spoken to him and he was okay with that.
He let his eyes focus in the, now dark, library. He could just make out her fiery red hair bobbing as Ginny sways back and forth to the music. She awkwardly stepped forward and Harry spied the large glass of blood-red wine splashing around.
“He?” She blinked hard. Draco groaned in response, this couldn’t get worse. “You know who your mate is?”
Harry halted, his pacing steps no longer filling the room. He looked up from his own frustration and found McGonagall still sat behind her desk, an arm directing him to sit across from her. Harry sighed deeply and dragged his feet forward so he could collapse into the oak-stained chair.
Draco clasped his eyes together and turned to the floor. A wild mixture of wood and cinnamon filling his every scent. He couldn’t place it but there was a hint of something - someone else, he didn’t like it.
“Now, either I don’t have the right ‘equipment’ or I was just too easy for you.” Pansy’s breath invaded Draco’s space and even though they weren’t touching her chest was brushing against his loosened tie. “Do you want me to fight you because it would be my pleasure?”
She hiccuped, “just weird stuff about being in love and making someone happy. I was scared and I thought maybe you did that. I was going to get someone, I was but then I thought it might get you into trouble and now I can’t get it out of my mind. Nobody’s seen him since, what if he blacked out and died because I didn’t get help?”
“Ah Mr Malfoy, I see you’ve decided to grace us with your presence!” McGonagall stepped forward, her harsh accent intruding his eardrums. “Now please give me one good reason why I shouldn’t contact the Ministry this second?”
In seconds, Pansy flew across the Common Room. Her back slamming into the ebony tiles surrounding the fireplace. The Young Witch rolled her head against the tiles, “Draco, what the fu-?!”
“I - Er, got pretty good last year at resisting certain situations,” he whispered into his robes. “Dark Lord and that…”
His breathing was heaving thumping down on his lungs as he made eye contact with Ron and Hermione, him trying to convey a silent plea to stop the gossip between their friends.
“You-you didn’t?” Harry nodded, “Oh my god. Someone else must have attacked him! I-I just thought you were protecting yourself!”
I've recently got a new job and literally have just got back off holiday so this is a super quick update as it has been a while.
Finch-Fletchley slopped back down to the floor, “Slughorn doesn’t always keep the potions cupboard under lock and key, plus it’s just to keep everything interesting!”
“I’m serious Malfoy,” he took a quick step forward encroaching on the Slytherin’s space and like a dance, Draco mirrored his step so he had his back against the wall.
“Nah, you’re right. I’m being stupid, course I want that.” He pushed his chair back to stand, “It’s my round yeah?”
“I know I said it last night,” she murmured, looking down at her lap. “But I honestly am so sorry Draco, for everything. I feel so foolish, something just came over me, I wanted you to want me after hearing about Dean Thomas…”
Everything was too much. He slammed his eyes shut. All of his thoughts clouded by the subtle smell of soap and brooms. An intense force putting pressure on his spine.
Draco sighed, “apparently there have been four male veelas recorded over the last three centuries. Well, at least that’s what Pomfrey has told me.”
Draco thought he knew everything he could about loss. Loss of himself, his Mother, friends, money, power. Everything had been ripped away from him like a plaster left on a healed over scab, but nothing sang to his sorrows quite like the loss of physical contact. Tiny cracks of light had seeped into his life and now had been gaffer taped over, leaving little more than a shadow of where his heart used to be.
After his conversation with McGonagall, Harry couldn’t face going back to the Hospital Wing. He’d spent every minute there with Malfoy since Sunday and the thought of having to go back there was causing his insides to churn.
Silence fell between the two, the tension uneasy and building. Pansy shuffled slightly on the cotton sheets while Draco focused on the creases on the bottom sheet.
“-Discovery?” Someone must have been fucking with him, it was all so confusing. Why was Thomas even allowed to be in this room? What right did he have to look frightened? Draco's back was starting to heat up familiarly.
“How could I not know?” She tilted her head and stared, “You’re fucked most nights. Do you know how many times I had to clean up your sick or help you to bed?”
“-Don’t worry about it,” she slurred, raising her glass in the air dancing. “I get why you do it now.”
Oh. Harry wanted to mentally slap himself, he did know that. Everything had become so muddled over the past couple of months.
Scavage stepped closer, his musty trench coat brushing Harry’s side, “Aye ma’am, I were just sending Potter ‘ere on his way”.
“It was a double dragons brew right?” Harry looked up to see Ron dishing the drinks out, “Ah, well you got a double anyway”.
It was as Draco immersed himself in the close contact he noticed a tiny mole on Harry’s reddened cheeks. If Draco could just lift his hand upwards he would be able to feel the plush skin under his fingertips. That was when it happened.
Ginny frowned slightly, wondering if she could actually pinpoint the moment Harry distanced himself for her. She let her feet fight against the dewy grass and prised open the doors to the locker room.
“You’ll what Malfoy? Can’t run to Daddy anymore,” Dean’s lips had stretched into a nasty smirk as he took another step closer. “You sure as hell can’t hex me. Who would the teachers believe? A washed-up Death Eater or me?”
In seconds it was all over, Harry's eyelids fell into a frown. Perfection morphed quickly into something all too familiar.
“Gin, I don’t know how you knew about it but that was the last bit I had,” he pathetically whispered as he slopped backwards into the chair.
"Came in my pants. Just want to lie here, in your arms." Seamus said, shifting himself so that Dean was embracing his currently naked self better. Dean pulled the bracket up to cover the both of them. "Stay with me tonight?" Seamus asked. Dean nodded, kissing Seamus on his forehead.
"And remember we said that we are going to learn to defend ourselves? We need to get a spell book and learn to not just use the spells that school teaches us so as not to be predictable. Get it? That's why you are here." Draco pacified the pouting Harry, as they stepped into the library.
Draco suddenly heard a scraping sound of someone sitting down behind him. He casually turned his head to see who it was. He was surprised to see Blaise sitting behind him, looking at the Gryffindor Quidditch players. Draco then lifted his eyebrow in greeting when Blaise finally turned to meet his eyes.
Sirius and Remus looked at each other again. "Harry, it's true that only the Slytherin's and Gryffindor's Heir are left. However, we know something that Voldemort don't. He assumed that Parseltongue was a talent which only descendants of Salazar Slytherins have. It is not. The reason why Tom Riddle could open the Chamber of Secrets was not because he was the Heir of Slytherin. After all, Harry, you could open it. That just made Voldemort assumes that he is the Heir. But he's not. Heirs are passed down through the males of the family. And Tom got his magic powers from his mother." Remus answered.
"Fifteen years ago, one month before Halloween, we received news from Dumbledore that the Potters may be in danger. A pregnant mother who was recently widowed by Death-eaters had been murdered in her sleep. The Dark Mark was spotted by the Aurors and when Dumbledore attempted to trace back the family tree of that family, he found that they linked back to Helga Hufflepuff. Thus the baby in that woman's womb was in actual fact the heir of Hufflepuff. Thus he deduced that the Potters may be in danger as the Heir of Slytherin may be hunting the heirs of the other founders." Sirius said
Draco knew that both their emotions were disrupting the shared magical pool and if they actually let the magic lose, they might actually blow up the place. He was trying to send comfort waves to Harry, but because his emotions were also very much on the surface, it seemed to be unable to do anything for Harry. He could sense Harry attempting to control his emotions and the magic, and reached his hand out to tug Harry into his arms, as Harry looked at him for help. Looking at the rest of the people standing staring at them, Harry decided that the main thing was to protect them from any magical outburst. He looked back at Draco's eyes and realized that Draco was thinking the same thing. It was as if they knew what each other was thinking. He then used his mind to conjure a protective bubble around Draco and himself. It was like a protective shield spell, but the difference was that Harry did not use his wand to conjure it. He didn't even know the words for the spell. He simply imagined it being there, surrounding Draco and himself, even if they moved about, and both boys slowly sat down on the floor, still holding on to each other's hands. Harry then rested his head on Draco's shoulders and both breathed in deeply, closing their eyes and trying to control their tempers and their magic.
"Albus, it's true that everyone can do some wandless magic. But shielding spells! They are so advanced and even normal Aurors had trouble casting it with their wands sometimes. I myself have never heard of a shield in the bubble form." McGonagall asked.
Draco shot Harry a glance, lifting his right eyebrow. "You think I don't know? She is so predictable." He went on eating as if it did not bother him in the least.
The Gryffindors then traveled to the Charms classroom in which they were to have the lesson with Hufflepuffs. The first Charms lesson was based on theory and the whole class sat in the warm classroom listening to Professor Flitwick drone on and on. Harry was seated next to the window and was looking out of it, only paying half of his attention to the lecturing professor. He was quite restless as all throughout the summer, his aunt got him working in the garden and he was not used to sitting so much in one day. He missed his morning run that morning as well as he slept in. Looking at his schedule he realized that he had one and a half hour free after Charms before dinner and decided to go for a run around Hogwarts. Looking out of the window, he saw Hagrid bringing his class to a shed behind his hut to look at a certain animal. Knowing Hagrid, it must be something that was very rare. Since they took their O.W.L.s every one of them was to revise their curriculum in which they specialized in two areas of magic. Care of Magical Creatures, which Hagrid taught was taken out of the curriculum for the sixth and seventh years, for them to concentrate on other subjects. That also meant that he had less chance to talk to Hagrid, who was his first friend. From what he knew, there were only three people in the seventh year currently taking three areas of specializations, Hermione because she was the top student, Draco because he wanted to compete with Hermione, and Harry himself due to the need to be able to defend himself against Voldemort. Thus the three of them were no longer needed to take the Intermediate Herbalogy classes. In terms of workload, Hermione still had the most number of classes as she was taking Advanced Arithmancy, an elective, meaning she had an addition Intermediate Arithmancy class that she had to go. (A/N: the subjects that everyone is taking is at the end of the chapter.)
Harry's shirt was unbuttoned as a half-naked Draco was in his lap, sucking at a particular part of his neck. Harry's head was thrown back against the couch of their study area as he moaned to the sensation of Draco's hand in his unzipped jeans stroking him. The others had gone to bed and they had placed a silencing and repelling spell on the circular room, when one thing led to another. Draco shifted to lick Harry's nipple as Harry started to unbutton Draco's pants. He somehow managed to strip Draco of his pants and boxers, while Draco shifted himself to allow Harry to pull his garments down further. A look at each other's eyes and Draco used his wandless magic to prepare himself for Harry's entrance. As Harry joined himself to Draco, all the two boys could feel was the feeling of their chest brushing against each other and the love and contentment of the feeling of being 'together'. As Draco rocked both of them gently towards a climax, he could not believe that in the months since he had nothing, he seemed to have gained everything, and that he would never be alone again. When both cuddled for a moment after their climax, tears spilled from Draco's eyes.
Harry looked at the black-haired man who, after four years, was still on the run, after escaping from Azkaban in his third year. Since his godfather started following Professor Lupin around as his pet dog, he seemed more rested and healthy, being less pale as he was no longer being locked up. Harry hoped that Sirius knew what he was doing by being at Hogwarts but knowing Professor Dumbledore, he would try his best to protect Sirius.
Draco nodded. "Two of them. Defense spells. Want to go back to the dorm to read?" Draco looked back at Harry hopefully.
"Draco, one thing that you have to learn when you are eating at the Gryffindor table is that, we don't pass the food bowls. The best course of the table will always appear in front of Ron because the house elves know that he is the biggest eater in our whole group. What we want, we just pass the fork or spoon to others to ask them to take for us if we are too far away. We share all the food like a family. The only rule is that we don't talk with our mouth full. Herm says it's disgusting. Oh. And goodies will be shared within the house in the common room as well. Ok?" Dean just lightly patted Draco on his left shoulder. Draco then noticed that Hermione had given her spoon to Harry and without a sound from the girl Harry scooped some mashed potato onto the spoon and dumped everything back onto Hermione's plate. It was obvious to him that after sitting together for all meals for six years had taught Harry the ways of Hermione's mind that she no longer had to instruct him. The whole group surrounding him was also doing the same thing and it seemed that he was the only outsider. Draco then started cutting and eating his chicken chop.
Dean opened his mouth then shut it again without saying anything. He then did it again. He breathed in deeply and let his breath out and tried opening his mouth again. All this while Harry only looked at him with a questioning look, hoping that it would encourage him to open up to him. Dean never came to him with problems before. His roommates were all so different in personality. Ron would combust at hearing a single word that seemed like an insult towards his girlfriend or housemates. Neville was the insecure type who had the tendency to go speechless with fright in front of professors. Seamus was the flirty and bouncy type who seemed to be forever moving and talking. Dean was the quiet type who seemed to be mature and reasonable at all times. In other words, Dean seemed to be the last person to come to Harry with a problem.
Harry spoke up. "And magic itself is light. But the textbook will say that the true intention of the caster of that spell is what actually denotes it light or dark. Due to that, it is actually very difficult to justify. Killing a person to save a town. Is that spell considered dark or light? I cast a spell to trip a friend. Dark or Light?"
"No, there must be a reason why Voldemort came after my family. He didn't want my father. He didn't even want to kill my mum. Why me?" Harry asked again, never taking his eyes off Sirius. Everyone then turned to stare at Sirius and Remus.
She suddenly saw a flash of black and saw a large furry dog barking his greeting, while placing his front paws on the bed beside her shoulder. She reached out the hand that was not held by Harry, and scratched behind the furry ears. "Hey, Snuffles. Were you waiting outside for me too?" Snuffles barked once.
The boy in the portrait realized that they are in front of his portrait and said, "Hi, I'm Marcus. Password?"
She landed in front of the locker rooms and made her way to the sink. Splashing water onto her face, she looked up to the mirror, as she caught sight of her own reflections, tilting her head, thinking. She had found that in the past week, with all the couples forming around her, she had been having difficulty being cheerful in front of others. Some mornings she just wanted to lie in bed and not get up. It could be due to the furious Quidditch training, tiring her out. When doing her homework in the common room, she often found herself losing the concentration, and many a times just gave up doing, favoring going in search of Snuffles and hugging the big black dog. Something told her that the dog was special, because when she talked to him, it was as if he understood everything she said, and the dog never got sick of her, always sitting silently next to her even when she was not talking. Her own friends sometimes found her to be annoying and would shoo her away, thinking that she would never be hurt by that shooing. She sighed when she remembered that no matter how annoying she had been, both Harry and Draco had never shooed her away. She was thankful for that small gesture on their part, but even she knew that you don't take up too much time of people who were currently in a relationship.
Hermione: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Advanced Arithmancy, Intermediate Potions, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Transfiguration
"I think we should allocate a few days in which we spend our time in the common room. Otherwise we're going to be sick of each other soon. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday?" Hermione stated.
"… And Harry Potter catches the snitch, finishing this atrocious game at 450-20 with the Gryffindors winning! I'm not putting you down, Harry, but it seems that the team didn't really need the snitch to win! This three-hour game is rather brutal, not because the Slytherins are cheating, but it seemed that the Lions are determined to place all the Slytherin players in the infirmary. The Lions are all hugging their seeker, even their junior team, who were let out to the pitch to play for half an hour just now when Captain Weasley realized that there is no way their team could lose. And they are finally separated from their seeker, who had been on a winning streak since he came to Hogwarts and… do I see their chaser Finnegan heading out to the Gryffindor audience? And he stopped in front of Thomas, his boyfriend of a few months. His team members seemed to realize that something is happening and surrounded him… does anyone have a pair of omniculars? Thank you Professor Dumbledore… and Finnegan is taking something out from his pocket… it looks like… he opened the black thing and … Potter is waving his wand at Finnegan, as he dismounted from his broom in mid-air, it looks like a levitating spell… Finnegan looked like his kneeling down in the air and… good Merlin! He's proposing to Thomas in front of the whole school on the Quidditch pitch! And Thomas is grinning and nodding and pulled Finnegan towards him and they kissed! And… ouch… Professor McGonagall… that hurt! Oh… well, that's the match between Slytherins and Gryffindors and a successful marriage proposal! All the best wishes to the couple and… ouch… yes Professor, I'll shut up now. Quietus."
Harry then shot a glance at Draco. He knew that Draco and he were the only seventh years taking Advanced Transfiguration. (Draco's was taking Advanced DADA and Advanced Potions and Harry took Advanced DADA and Advanced Charms.) For the past year, Professor McGonagall said that she needed to get each other on par with each other's abilities before she could group the two together for combined lessons. Even though the two were still enemies then, Harry felt quite lonely turning up for lessons alone. Maybe she was afraid that she would have to spend time breaking up fights instead of teaching. And she meant whose abilities were NOT on par with whose? Harry frowned. He didn't want to lose out to Draco. Even though they were now sleeping in the same dorm, it did not mean that he was not competitive. He did care about the results he get, just that he also had other things on his mind, like Quidditch. Then he remembered that at breakfast when he compared his schedule with that of Draco's the only difference was that when he was supposed to go for Advanced Charms, Draco was to report to Snape for Advanced Potions. That meant that their Advanced Transfiguration was together.
Harry's eyes fluttered open, keeping his body immobile. He could sense from his link that Draco was still asleep, and he didn't want to physically wake him up yet. Looking at the blur in front of him, he realized that the past two months of frequently sleeping together beside each other had made the two of them used to each other in bed. They had fallen asleep the previous night just lying next to each other on the bed, but during the night, they had searched out each other in the centre of the bed. Harry was lying on his side, facing Draco when he woke up. Draco's face was leaning on Harry's shoulder and his hand was gently on Harry's hips. Their legs were entwined. Harry slowly reached up above the pillow and placed his glasses on his nose. Looking down at Draco's sleeping face, he smiled as he marveled at the fact that someone so good looking was lying beside him. He patiently waited for Draco to wake up, as experience told him that Draco would sense him awake and follow him into the awaken world soon.
"You, my dear, is just jealous. Wait till you get someone of your own." Seamus said playfully as he also started tidying his bag. He never caught the grin Harry threw at Draco and the wink Draco gave to Harry.
He looked down at himself and found that he was dressed in his pajamas. Suddenly he felt fingers sliding into his hand and realized that it was Draco, standing beside him, dressed in his pajamas, frowning around the room.
Draco lifted his head to stare at Harry's emerald eyes. He then shifted till he was above Harry, supporting his own body with his elbows. "I like you too. But it is happening too fast. Want to slow it down? Because I don't play around. I don't want to just have sex. I rather there are feelings between us before we do anything. Is that okay?"
"Amazing in the fact that he doesn't know how good he looks." Seamus commented, looking at Draco. All Draco did was nod as he looked at the figure running. Draco was slightly aroused by the sight of Harry doing his warm-ups. He thanked Merlin that he chose a looser pair of jeans that morning when he dressed. Then he turned back to Seamus to find him scrutinizing him.
Pansy saw Day staring at the wand and with a vindictive smirk, snapped the wand into two. Day winced, as the wand had never left her side for the past four years and had almost become a magical extension of her. She suppressed the whimper at Pansy's action but couldn't keep the grimace from her facial expression as she looked at the broken wand that Pansy dropped on the floor beside her.
"Harry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bringing this up to you. It seems so insignificant compared to what you…"
Dumbledore smiled at the two boys opposite him. "In the last few days, did you feel especially contented just to be with each other?"
"Okay. Defense against Dark Arts. I think you all went through quite a bit of Dart Arts stuff. We are going to have a short discussion. You have a point, you speak up. So, what defines Dark Arts?"
Ginny helped to introduce the two of them since they were from her Arithmancy classes. "This is Jon Breeks and Joseph Malloy." Jon was black-haired and Joseph had sandy-blond hair. Both looked very studious, with their spectacles and seemed to be afraid that Ron or Draco would scold them for being so daring.
Dumbledore shook his head. "That's why it is so amazing to be able to see the transition from normal seventh years to powerful wizards. And that's why I love being a headmaster." He smiled as he left the room, leaving behind a thoughtful werewolf and an equally thoughtful dog.
The whole group settled down to have their lunch. Hermione was reading a book as usual as she chewed away at her food. Draco was sitting right opposite her and was quite irritated by the fact that the book was right in front of him.
"Hmm… no idea, but if he really marry Pansy after they graduate, that bitch is going to be so rich as Malfoy got all the stuff from his relatives!" Seamus pouted.
"What happened to the spell?" Sirius said. Draco explained what happened as the two boys got up from the floor. When they finished explaining, Sirius and Remus were astonished. "What made you change the texture?"
She saw Harry and Draco sitting at the edge of the next bed. They knew that she was awake, but her awakening did not cause them to hover around her. She frowned. It was not the first time she had landed in the infirmary, as Quidditch players had higher injury rates than normal students. Previous experience told her that when you were a patient, when you first wake up from your injuries, your friends hovered over you like you were their injured pet. Frowning, she didn't remember any Quidditch matches that caused her to be in the infirmary.
"Ron." Harry pointed to the mango pudding that was to be the dessert for the night that was in front of Hermione and indicated two with his fingers. Ron took two of the cups with the mango pudding and gave them to Harry. Harry then placed one beside Draco's plate and started eating the other one. Draco looked at Harry and lifted one of his eyebrows. All Harry did was grin back at him and continued eating his mango pudding. Draco then noticed that Seamus also took two mango puddings from the other side and reached across to put one in front of Dean. All Dean did was give a slight nod of acknowledgement. Ginny did the same for Neville.
"So I should wait until I'm sure that this is really what I want?" Dean asked Harry, who seemed willing to give him space to think about the situation at hand.
Harry was now used to being with Draco for almost every hour of the day. On days in which they were separated for Draco's Advanced Potions lesson and Harry's Advanced Charms lesson, very often they would meet each other outside the Great Hall and their hands would search out for each other's to grasp together. If it wasn't for the fact that they were soul mates, they themselves would find the behavior unhealthy. After telling the whole school about their relationship, they were hardly seen without each other around the school. Both of them could feel their magic bonding, as Professor Dumbledore had suggested that it may be easier for them to draw magic from the magical pool between them instead of themselves the week after they were told that they were soul mates. In adapting to that change, they found themselves improving in almost all areas of their magic, and were able to learn their animagus transformation faster as well.
Harry was waiting for the whole group outside the Great Hall, leaning against the wall and doing some catching up with Day. Day was rambling on about her summer and complaining against the sheer amount of homework the professors assigned them. He was just listening to her rambling as it had been the way for the past two years. He remembered back on the first day of his fifth year he found Day sitting desolately in the common room during lunch time when he rushed back to the dorm to retrieve a book that he forgot. She was facing the fire with her tears flowing down silently from her eyes. When the portrait opened, she didn't even look up. Harry, out of concern for her, started to ask her why she was so sad. She replied that she lost points that morning for being too restless to sit still in class and everyone in her year ignored her because of that. Harry had just finished a potions class where Professor Snape had deducted points for he breathing too loudly. He told her about his potions class and persuaded her to go to lunch with him. From then on, she often came to him for advice and he persuaded her to become a chaser in her fourth year when all the chasers in the team graduated. One thing that Harry liked about Day was that she always seemed so cheerful and hyperactive all the time. On a down day, she could perk the whole group's spirit up.
Harry wondered to himself, as he copied, not noticing that Draco's body froze in the middle of note-taking.
The next moment, two forms shimmered into existence in front of both Harry and Draco and both of them blinked in surprise when they saw the two forms. Two jet-black panthers stood in front of them. One had gray eyes when it looked back at Draco, smirking; the other had green eyes when it looked back at Harry. The two panthers then looked at each other and Harry's animagus form sat down on the floor. Draco's animagus form then draped itself all over Harry's animagus form and lifted Harry's form's paw and started licking. Both Harry and Draco blushed at this display of intimacy from their animagus forms, as the two forms shimmered again, disappearing.
"So are we going to stand here all day so as to examine that list of injuries? If you are really interested, all we had to do was to mutter a little spell and we could project that picture of Day lying there for you all and you can see it in full color instead of reading about it." Draco drawled, glaring at the professors. Snape glared back at Draco as McGonagall seemed insulted and was about to scold Draco for his rudeness. Draco continued on. "So, pray tell me. Where are those three animals now? Have they confessed? Why did they attack Day?"
Day thought to herself. She steered the surprised Draco to one of the seats and dropped herself to the seat beside him.
"They're okay. I actually had a good night of sleep. Some of them defended me against Parkinson at breakfast. I think they actually think that I'm … nice. Right Potter?"
Dinner found Draco waiting alone at the Gryffindor table for all the other Gryffindors. Gryffindors from different years walked past the silvery blond who was sitting quite near the doors. Most of them had curious looks on their faces instead of disgusted looks he had gotten the previous years as a Slytherin. Draco noticed, wondering if he himself had mellowed since he moved to Gryffindor.
They looked at each other and laughed. "Well, Remus and I are together. Harry, you don't mind, do you?" Sirius looked worriedly at Harry.
"Hi Hedwig. Don't worry. I'm fine.  Got here safe and sound. We're not going back again. Okay?" Hedwig hooted in agreement, spread her wings and flew off.
"So was that the hint you were looking for? How are you going to thank me?" Harry mischievously nudged Dean who was beside him. Dean just couldn't stop grinning as he felt so relieved. It was quite obvious that Seamus did feel an attraction towards him. So all he had to do now was to make sure that he had to approach Seamus carefully.
Everything was being observed by Neville who was seated behind Seamus. He was trying to hide his smile behind his hand.
Harry looked back at Draco, and lifted his hand to caress Draco's cheek. "Not if I can help it. Promise." He smiled.
"Hello? Anyone there?" She asked, as she slowly approached the area where she heard the sound from. All of a sudden, a pair of hands came from behind and one hand clamped over her mouth as the other went around her neck. Her screams were muffled by the hand above her mouth. Another pair of hands came up and snatched her wand from her hand and grasped her hands in a tight grip. She could feel herself being pulled backwards, towards a wall, and suddenly felt herself going through the wall with her assailants trying to stop her hands and legs from hitting them. She heard someone yell a spell and all a sudden, her legs and hands could no longer move. Her assailants lowered her onto the floor and suddenly the lights in this room lit as she saw who the ones who attacked her were.
Even Ron seemed astonished over the fact that his best friend had changed so much over the course of a few months. However his twin brothers did not seem so. The two of them punched Harry on the arm playfully, with Fred exclaiming, "Harry! I knew that you cleaned up good. Finally grew to the height that you should be. Thought that you are forever going to be at Ginny's height and when she even seemed to be getting taller than you, we were all getting a little worried! Looks like our dear Harry have no problems now."
“No,” Harry said unconvincingly. Draco only needed to raise a brow, unimpressed, for Harry to continue a little awkwardly. “Er, I just thought we could do something together. I mean, it is the first day of our honeymoon.”
Harry took a deep breath and released it slowly. “I don’t want to lie to you, baby. I wasn’t good. I don’t really even remember much of the last couple days.”
“Ah, Mr. Morgan. Right on time, as usual.” Fudge said, in a sarcastic voice. “Always one for drama. Very well. Your opening statement?”
Harry shook his head. “That doesn’t make any sense. I know Draco, and I trust him with my life. He would never do anything to hurt me.” At their horror stricken looks, he continued. “But if you want an answer to the question, I was the one to come to him, not the other way around. If his Father wanted to hand me over to Voldemort, or whatever, he could have kidnapped me when we first met. It doesn’t make any sense for him to want to hurt me. Believe me.” He added, at their disbelief.
He found Platform 9 easily enough, and 10, but there was no 9 ¾. After a rather heated discussion with a conductor, he began to panic.
“He put this spell on me, in place of the Dark Mark,” Draco told Harry, still wrapped up in his arms on the floor of the bathroom. “He said it was a bit of an experiment of his. Said it was so he could keep an eye on me. Said it would poison me, and then her, if I did one of three things: talk about my task or her, fail, or try to move her from the manor.”
“I’d like to explain my stance. I have thought about what was said, and I realize that I said some hurtful things in my anger.” Harry was thrown for a second before he caught on they were thinking about two different things; he tried not to be disappointed. “I want you to know I never intended to hurt you, I was just lashing out because I myself was hurt. I realize that wasn’t your intention either, so I’d like to talk to you about what happened to minimize this happening again in the future.” Harry blinked, a little surprised and quite a bit nervous.
"Yeah, we do," Draco agreed. The picture of them moved very gradually, they did look good slowly kissing, their lips moving over the other's slowly. Harry smiled and set the photo to the side.
Harry had a vision leading him to the Ministry. Luckily, he doesn't fall for it. What will Voldemort do in response, I wonder?
“So, whatever is happening to us, let’s just assume it’s a Soul Bond for now, it’s a result of the Bonding Ceremony? I guess that makes sense, the surge of powers, maybe we’re somehow sharing it?”
“I think I feel alright. Honestly, I’m a little nervous about how you were going to take it, but it’s more like I’m excited.”
There was a brief tense moment immediately after Ron finished the article where he became surly until Hermione said how rubbish it was. He lightened immediately.
Draco was smirking when he pulled back. Not the mean one, but the confident one that showed he was particularly proud of himself. “Now we have that out of the way,” he drawled, and Harry snorted, “happy Valentine’s Day, my valentine. I love you.”
“Ah, I don’t care who you’re with, as long as they make you happy. Besides, it’d be pretty hypocritical. I had a couple boyfriends in my life.”
He picked up the chocolate éclair first and moaned as he took a bite. He hadn’t had one in such a long time, and it was divine.
Finally, he saw a familiar face and smiled, though it quickly vanished at the look on Draco’s face. He was angry and glaring, and Harry realized he had been very restrained in the robe shop.
“Er—hello. Hi.” Harry cringed internally. He couldn’t decide which word to use, more formal as he had used, or more casual, so he had used both like an idiot.
Sirius withdrew a coin from his pocket and handed it to Draco, who nodded at him. Sirius waved as Draco called, “Cache Cove!” Harry felt that familiar hook behind his navel and the compression, the wind whipping around him. Draco caught him before he fell as they landed roughly.
Draco was a good audience. He was completely invested in everything Harry said, didn’t interrupt but still made noises of interest.
They all shook their heads and looked away. Harry sat down, trying to tone down his happiness. “Good bathroom break, mate?” Ron asked. Everyone but Hermione and Luna started laughing. Harry turned red at the insinuation.
Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape approached the scene, and a circle of students formed around them. “What happened to him?” Dumbledore asked gravely.
He wandered through and found Sirius where he last saw him in the front foyer. He hadn’t quite realized he had abandoned him.
“Sirius, you can transform. Draco already knows about you.” Sirius gave him a stunned look, before standing and indeed transforming. He sat on the bed slowly, now in human form. He stared at Draco.
Harry shrugged. “I want you to stay, and explain to me why you’re here, but I’m not going to even try to make you to do something you don’t want to do. If you’re worried about someone seeing, I promise, I won’t say a word.” Draco hesitated, looking towards the hospital wing doors again, before looking back at Harry.
Harry’s head snapped up. “No.” He demanded, “don’t be sorry. This is my fault, my problem. I’m the one who’s sorry.”
“I’m fine, here, lie down.” He scooted over until there was barely enough room for Draco, but he was at the edge of his side, so it was all he could do. Draco looked like he was about to argue, but his smile softened, and he did indeed lie down next to Harry.
, echoed in his head, from one of Sirius’s letters. He would. He wouldn’t go over there and start a fight.
“I’ll help you clean it out,” Harry grinned. “It’s probably better than where my sand is. We can take a shower when we get the energy to get back to the house.”
“I’m ready if you are, afterall,” Harry raised his voice slightly, “my boyfriend is better than your boyfriend!”
The door to the cabin was locked as well. What if there was a fire? These people…taking a deep breath, she unlocked it, opened it a crack, then held it as it squeaked. With a silencing charm on herself as well as the door, she was in.
The silence continued stretching before Hermione slowly closed her eyes and shook her head. “He’s the person you’ve been sneaking out to meet.”
“This is Malfoy we’re talking about. What if all this is just some scheme to get you to You-Know-Who?”
“Speaking of sending me an owl, thank you very much for the chocolate and apple, I enjoyed both extensively. I asked you not to send me anymore because I didn’t feel right about it. I didn’t think there was a chance for—us. I didn’t want to confuse you, and I wasn’t sure why you were sending them to me. And I didn’t think I could talk to you. You’re always with Granger and Weasley, I couldn’t get you on your own.”
Harry felt his emotions come to the surface, and he was kissing Draco this time. Their kissing turned heated quickly, and they tumbled onto the cushions. They had perfected the position that Harry felt most comfortable with, connected from the waist up, their legs going in different directions. They stayed in that position for a long while, kissing happily and passionately. Slowly, Harry found himself climbing on top of Draco. Harry stopped, but he didn’t feel too much panic. “It’s ok, we can stop,” Draco panted.
Harry took a deep breath and released it slowly. “I don’t want to lie to you, baby. I wasn’t good. I don’t really even remember much of the last couple days.”
“I’ve got a couple ideas, if you’d be interested in hearing them,” Sal said slyly. Harry started taking steps backwards, not wanting to be in the middle of whatever was about to happen.
Draco gripped Harry’s robes, needing something to hang on to. Something to ground him, because his despair was washing him away.
Draco nodded as well. “I’ll get it before you leave. If you’re going to Flourish and Blott’s, I could use a random book. I always like to have one around.”
“Mother!” Draco shouted. There was no answer. “Mother,” he called again, anyway, knowing there would be no answer. He rubbed his eyes, trying to figure out why he couldn’t see. He needed to get to her. There was no other option.
Draco had given him a pair of crisp white robes accented with gold thread. He hadn’t given Harry anything else, so he just put them on without anything under them. It felt ever so slightly uncomfortable, but he suddenly remembered being at the Quidditch World Cup a couple summers previously where a confused wizard had told his companion he ‘liked a nice breeze ‘round his privates’. He snorted his laughter, it did feel kinda good.
“I—” He really didn’t want to tell them about Draco when they were already so upset, but he was starting to think he wouldn’t come out of the conversation with him still a secret. “I had a bad nightmare, and I just wanted to be at home, alright?”
Ron’s jaw dropped, Hermione looked triumphant, Ginny gasped and turned an interesting shade of red, Neville blinked, and Mandy and Luna smiled at him. Not a bad collective reaction.
“I still don’t understand how they wouldn’t find you innocent with Pettigrew.” Harry directed to Sirius.
“You really don’t have to open presents that slowly, Harry. We’re going to be here for days unless you put some effort into it. Here, let me show you how it’s done.” Harry felt somewhat bad that Sirius had less presents than Harry, but he knew Sirius had intended that.
He put his hand into the closest pile, coming back with a bottle of sherry. That was strange. There were books, broken pieces of furniture, random objects. He went further into the room, looking around in interest. Ahead of him was a bust with a tiara on its head. He strode forward, something about the crown calling to him. His vision tunneled strangely, and he heard strange whispering. His fingers reached out, about to touch the odd thing.
Draco fixed the mugs and summoned them with a wave of his wand. He slid them over to Harry and said, “again.” A small smile broke Harry’s face, and he threw them both, one after the other.
“There was nothing I could do.” He whispered, Harry figured he wasn’t meant to hear it. “She saved me.” He whispered again. Harry pulled Draco’s head down to his shoulder. His face needed cleaning, so Harry conjured a handkerchief and gently cleaned him. Draco made no effort to stop him, didn’t even react. “That bastard! He killed her! Harry, you had better kill him and kill him good, do you hear me?” Draco suddenly yelled. Harry quickly cast a silencing charm on the door.
“Hi, Mum, Dad. It’s my seventeenth birthday, and I wish you were here to celebrate it with me.” He looked at Draco, who nodded for him to continue. “I wish for that every year. I don’t know if I’ll ever stop. I don’t remember much about you, how could I? But I remember the most important things, and that’s how much you loved me, and what you sacrificed so I could live. I want you to know how much I love you, and how much I honor what you did for me. I may have had a hard life, but I was lucky to have any life, and that is thanks to you. So, thank you.”
“You deserve better,” Harry told him, tightening his hold. That really set Draco off, and Harry mentally cursed himself. He rocked Draco side to side until he calmed.
He got out his wand. “I’m pretty good with healing charms, benefit of being best friends with a werewolf. But if these bones are broken, we may need to get you to a hospital.”
“Oh.” George finally looked convinced. That was a close one. “I’m sorry, Harry, I guess I’m just fried. I can’t believe we’re banned from quidditch. That bitch!”
“Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re meeting my family at the Leaky Cauldron for dinner.” Harry barely caught his sigh in time. He had eaten there so much he had tried everything they had to offer, and he was getting a bit tired of it. Still, he shouldn’t complain if he was eating anything at all. And it would be nice to see the Weasleys.
Harry was ready to pull all his hair out he was so confused and frustrated. Already it looked messier than ever, with the number of times he had run his hand through it. He really wished he had someone he trusted that he could talk to. An adult, who was wiser and more experienced than he was. That wasn’t about to happen anytime soon though. He was on his own.
“Ron and Hermione are here!” Sirius repeated from the living room downstairs. Harry hastily hid his presents and ran out to meet them.
Harry had requested books about wards, portkeys, and spells to find people. All things he might need to search for Draco. Madam Pomfrey hadn’t bothered to look over the books he had gotten, so he was free to pursue them over the next several days as his condition apparently improved.
Draco sighed at Harry's petulance, but stepped closer to him and ran his hand lightly up and down the small of Harry's back, mindful of the eyes on them. Harry relaxed instantly.
, as did the filing cabinets. Sally’s file was in the third drawer down. Mandy felt sick upon reading part of the first page—it was a detailed description of what was ‘wrong’ with her and a list of treatment options. She skimmed after that. There wasn’t much information, but she found her cabin number quickly enough. Putting everything back exactly where she found it, then wiping away any fingerprints, just in case, she locked the door behind her.
“Your hair is looking luscious today,” Terry Boot told Draco within hearing distance of Harry. He was talking to Jamie, the first-year trans girl about defense; Jamie didn’t understand one of the lessons. He explained about the counter charm to jinxes while half listening to the conversation.
Draco smiled and took his hand. They both looked around the room they had created together. It was stone walls, floors and ceiling, just like the rest of the castle. There were candles all over the room, and a fire was roaring in the fireplace, casting a very romantic glow throughout the room. There was a red carpet in front of the fire, a dark wood coffee table behind that, a black leather couch behind that, and a bed in the middle of the back wall. There were nightstands on either side, both them and the frame made from dark wood. The bedclothes were black as well, with gold and silver thin lines embroidered around the edges. There was a red plush blanket folded at the end of the bed, and that and the pillows looked very fluffy. Harry thought it couldn’t be more perfect.
Harry spluttered and choked on his butterbeer. “Guess not.” Sally smirked, and it reminded him of Draco. He had very carefully avoided looking for Draco, knowing it would be a huge distraction to him.
Hope’s Army had one drawback that Harry did (nonetheless) enjoy. It was hard to be around Draco and perform a delicate balance of trying to pretend that they hated each other but were forced to be civil with the other. They normally compensated by ignoring each other.
“We didn’t quite break up then, but things were so tense, and it was like something had broken between us. I figured we would have any day, but before anything could happen, I was being carted off to Azkaban.” There was silence as Sirius’ story came to an apparent close. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. There were no words of comfort he could think of. Then, Sirius continued.
spot, and Harry was screaming. His dick had been untouched while the dildo was inside him, but he felt like he didn’t even need the simulation for it to feel good.
He didn’t know for sure what they were going to find, when they got up to the tower, but it couldn’t be good. He had a feeling this night was about to get that much worse, especially if the dark mark was any indication.
“Harry,” Draco repeated, he was asleep, but appeared to be fitful enough to awaken. He whimpered, as if in pain. It struck a blow to his heart, and he felt as if his own chest was being sliced open.
“Give me him!” Draco cried as he sat up quickly. They both froze, hands both on the dragon, as Draco’s face morphed into pain. Harry threw the dragon to Draco’s side as he laid back down, hand clutching his chest. He was bleeding in several places along the line of cut. Harry nearly started crying again at the sight. “Potions,” Draco said, “the purple one, there,” he pointed, and Harry handed him the bottle.
“You stand accused of 13 counts of murder, 2 counts of conspiracy to commit murder, 1 count of evading the law, 1 count of treason, 1 count of belonging to the organization known as the Death Eaters, unknown counts of illegal spell usage, 1 count of kidnapping, 1 count of practicing dark arts, 1 count against the statute of secrecy, 1 count of being an illegal Animagus, and 1 count of falsification of legal documents.” They were really tacking things on. “How do you plead?”
“Draco, she loved you. She wouldn’t want you blaming yourself. You, and she, were both put in an impossible situation with no good outcome. She did what she thought she had to do, just as you did.”
“No, we’re just good friends. I don’t have the right parts for her.” It was the first time he had made a joke even remotely sexual, and it went over well. He didn’t even blush, while the rest of the compartment laughed.
“You don’t have to decide quickly. Weas—erm, Ron and Hermione will be able to prove themselves to be your true friends if they give you time. You’re not on a set schedule, and if you need time, they’ll have to give it to you. Maybe you can take it slowly, rebuild your relationship instead of jumping right back in to being inseparable. You’ll work it out eventually.” Harry hummed thoughtfully.
Harry had really been looking forward to this match. He had a very strange feeling that he was lucky to be playing in it.
That made some people start trying harder, but not all of them. Draco gave Harry a long-suffering sigh and look then start moving about the room, correcting people on their holds, stances, or pronunciation. The first couple people Draco corrected did not take it well. Angelina Johnson called Draco Death Eater scum and to stay away from her. He reacted with a raised brow and said fine, if you can disarm me. She couldn’t. After that, people were politer but almost everyone was cold.
A woman stepped forward, wearing dark grey dress robes with light blue stitching. It was Mary MacDonald, the woman that had prepared them a couple days previous. Harry had met her when she went over what to do and not do when he was being questioned. “Members of the Wizengamot, I stand before you today, a humble servant of the law. Justice has not been served, and I will tell you why. Fourteen years ago, an innocent man was placed under arrest for the crimes this man committed. Years later, he has only committed more crimes, making absolutely no contribution to society. This man worked for the Dark Lord known as You-Know-Who; he conspired to kill Lily and James Potter, two upstanding members of society with a small son, later killed 13 muggles, blowing up a street and risking our very way of life by flaunting the statue of secrecy. He then transformed into a rat and escaped through the sewers, leaving his friend to be accused of his crimes. He later kidnapped Harry Potter, injuring him in the process as he attempted to resurrect his master, the Dark Lord. This man is a danger to society, he cannot be let go. He must pay for the crimes he has committed, and he cannot be allowed to escape justice, again.” With that, she took her seat. Harry wanted to applaud her but knew that wouldn’t go well.
Hermione grabbed him immediately after the ceremony was over and pulled him over to a table Ron was waiting at. “We’ve been planning the hunt,” Hermione jumped right in as soon as he was seated.
As Harry moved down towards his neck, Draco mumbled out, “missed you…so much. It was so hard…oh yes…seeing you…and not being able to-uh- do this to you.”
Sirius smiled at him. The answers, in Harry’s mind, amounted to, essentially, nothing. At least, not good enough. He was seriously worried about Voldemort, and his future was bleak with him on the horizon. The answers he got made him feel resentment and wrathful.
She wanted to have a meeting for everyone interested at the next Hogsmeade visit and Harry didn’t have a good enough reason to say no. Draco was disappointed they wouldn’t be able to have another date, but they met up the next day and had some butterbeer Harry had smuggled in together.
Harry smiled sheepishly, but it left his face rather quickly. “I’m sorry I kissed you when you were unconscious, and climbed into bed with you. It was wrong of me.”
“You’re welcome, you stupid, beautiful sap.” They kissed again, this time, more passionately. They fell back, Draco on top of Harry. Things were getting hot when there was a loud pop, breaking them apart.
They kissed as they always did for several long moments, Harry moving up and down against Draco lightly, before Harry moved to Draco’s neck, peppering kissed over every patch of skin. He was nervous but mostly excited, and very ready for this, and he wanted to make it as good as possible for Draco. He had already fantasized plenty about this moment and had a general plan. He was enjoying Draco’s moans, and wanted more of them. He kissed down Draco’s chest as he removed button after button. Finally, the shirt was off, and he encircled one nipple with his mouth while the other one got pinched with his fingers.
Draco stared at him in awe. Harry could feel him reacting, and he moved up and down to encourage him. “Ok. Can I return the favor?” Harry had already decided that he could, so he nodded. Draco gave him a predatory smile. “Do I need to say we can stop if you want to?” Harry shook his head, then Draco was kissing him.
“What’s that going to do? Your father’s in prison!” He attacked Draco’s neck with heated kisses. “I’m going to miss you. Sure, you don’t want to come home with me?”
The manager looked uncomfortable, trying to balance looking at Draco and avoiding him. “Sir, I am tolerant of whatever lifestyle you may have, but this is a family restaurant and we have had complaints—”
“I’m gonna come down your pretty little throat, babe. Are you ready for it? You’re going to be a good boy and swallow every drop, aren’t you?” and he was yelling, he wasn’t sure what, but he was yelling loudly. He hit his head as he threw it back again, and next thing he knew, he was sitting with his legs spread, Draco sitting between them as he held his head, panting heavily.
They were playing a little game where one would suddenly grab the other and kiss him, then walk away calmly without a word. It was enjoyable, but inspired growing retribution. Harry had Draco pinned against a wall behind an alcove, kissing and lightly sucking on his neck, when he heard footsteps, close by.
They exchanged glances. He supposed it didn’t matter much. “Come see me about your detentions, Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure I’ll be able to convince Professor Umbridge I can come up with more creative punishments than she can. It’s the least I can do for your services here today. I think, twenty points to Slytherin will fly under the radar enough to be overlooked. I’m sure more can be awarded tomorrow in Transfiguration.” He added, looking at McGonagall, who sent a rare smile to Draco along with a nod.
“I don’t need my father to take on you, Potter!” Draco let out a soft moan into Harry’s ear. “Think we can get away with some blowjobs?”
“What do you want to do now,” Harry asked. He wanted to stay with Draco, but his plans had all been played out.
Serious Warning in this chapter for Homophobia and Homophobic slurs. If that is a trigger for you, please let me know so we can figure out a way for you to read.
There was more screaming, all in his head, and then, there was silence, except his panting. He was sore all over, every inch of his body hurt. He couldn’t move.
They had been staring at it for just a couple minutes when a group of Slytherins approached, with Draco in the middle being the loudest, it sounded like he had just told a joke. His eyes widened then narrowed when he saw Ron standing there, seemingly alone, but he had to know Harry was standing nearby under an invisibility cloak.
? The new voice questioned. Why should he do everything this voice said? He was walking, but his feet were cold on the stone floor. He didn’t want to have cold feet. He was tired, and he wanted to go back to sleep in his nice warm bed. His feet wouldn’t be cold then, if he were in bed. Why wasn’t he in bed? Why was he moving? He didn’t want to move. Why should he be moving?
He held up the contract. “You signed a document promising not to speak of anything that happens in this room. I don’t know what the punishment for attempting to get around that will be, but if I know Hermione, it’s brutal.” His eyes slid over to her and noted that she looked embarrassed and a bit pleased.
“Your house will be like your family.” McGonagall had said. Harry had never had a family. He had always wanted one. Was he really getting a chance now? Ron had said his family had always been sorted into Gryffindor. Draco had said families usually got sorted together. Hagrid had said his parents had been Gryffindors.
Draco smiled and took his hand. They both looked around the room they had created together. It was stone walls, floors and ceiling, just like the rest of the castle. There were candles all over the room, and a fire was roaring in the fireplace, casting a very romantic glow throughout the room. There was a red carpet in front of the fire, a dark wood coffee table behind that, a black leather couch behind that, and a bed in the middle of the back wall. There were nightstands on either side, both them and the frame made from dark wood. The bedclothes were black as well, with gold and silver thin lines embroidered around the edges. There was a red plush blanket folded at the end of the bed, and that and the pillows looked very fluffy. Harry thought it couldn’t be more perfect.
“But…” He wasn’t sure what to say. “They’re a myth. Fantasy.” He caught sight of his ‘Disenchanted’ book and picked it up. “Was this your basis?” He asked, and Draco blushed. “Draco! This is fictional! There’s no such thing as actual Soul Bonds.”
Harry told Draco as much as he could about the vision and his and Sirius’s conversation. He felt even worse about not being able to tell Draco about Voldemort wanting him to get the weapon from the Ministry. He had a feeling Draco knew he was hiding something, but Harry was thankful he didn’t ask.
When Ron appeared to be done eating, he would always push his plate away and lean back in his chair rubbing his stomach, Hermione said, “well, we’d better get back to the search.”
He hadn’t told Harry his full plan, not wanting to hide anything from him, but unable to get Harry’s hopes up, in case it fell through; it would make a wonderful surprise in any case. He was hopeful that he could walk into the Great Hall during the Welcoming Feast, the very last one student to arrive, all the other students already seated. He switched it up sometimes, but he would either stalk right up to Harry Potter, and kiss him, or drop to one knee and propose.
Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that. Luckily, Mrs. Weasley had pressing matters. “Can you tell me what they did to you, dear?”
“Draco Malfoy is alive.” He decided to give them as much information as quickly as possible, lest they stop and question him. He ignored their expressions and continued. “He’s at Malfoy Manor, trapped, and I’m going to break in and rescue him. Portkeys and apparition don’t work, and he’s hurt. Sirius is getting the Order together, and as soon as they’re ready to go, we’re going to be off. We don’t know how long he’s going to be alone. The Manor is in Wiltshire, we’re finding out precisely where. Are you in?”
He came up with a couple ideas as he looked for them. Multiple people wanted to stop him to talk, and he got less and less polite the longer it happened. Finally, he nearly smacked himself when he realized he could have just checked his map. He pulled over to an alcove and searched in a much easier way. They were in the Gryffindor Common Room.
“It doesn’t work like that. Once a movie leaves the cinema, it goes to VHS. I’ll tell you about it.” He added at Draco’s questioning look. After he did explain, Draco wanted to get a telly, VHS player, and all of the Disney movies.
Draco moaned his encouragement as he pushed Harry back further into their room. They tumbled into the piles of cushions on the floor and took a break from their fevered kisses to laugh. Draco threw a leg over Harry as he finished unbuttoning his shirt but didn’t make a move to pull it off. Instead, he put his hand under it, feeling Harry’s skin and toned muscle with the fabric on the other side of his hand.
Harry, and several other Gryffindors, put hands over their ears to block out the defeating sound. Harry was still grinning, however. Cedric was a good bloke, even if he had beaten Harry in a bid for the Golden Snitch in a quidditch game the previous year. He figured Cedric was as good a champion as any for Hogwarts, and he honestly felt like Hufflepuff could use a win. They tended to be left out, with Gryffindors getting attention for being brave and noble, Ravenclaws for being intelligent and wise, and Slytherins for being cunning and ambitious. Hufflepuffs were a group of everyone else, and while that was just fine, they didn’t have crowning achievements like the other houses. Besides, if they were going to have to watch a champion all year, the champion might as well be good looking.
Harry put a plate down next to him. “Do you want to mix the eggs, like we practiced the other day?” Draco nodded eagerly.
“I’m distracting, not cheating. We both know we’ll be here all day if I don’t get creative.” Draco did a spin to avoid Harry’s spell.
Harry came to awareness slowly. There was an annoying beeping noise, and he silenced it with his wand. It was his wand, so that worked out. Draco was so beautiful in his sleep. His mouth was open, and he was snoring. Harry kissed his nose and Draco hummed. “Five more minutes.” He muttered/demanded. Harry was powerless to deny him.
Harry blinked. It sounded fool-proof, but was he really going to risk Draco’s life just so they could be around each other around other people?
“Excellent,” Draco said, giving him a kiss. “Now we just have the rest of my belongings to go.” Harry really did groan that time."
Harry raised his eyebrows and patted the bed. “I was thinking right here.” He was suddenly glad Sirius had insisted he get a bigger size than twin, despite Harry’s protests.
“Cho, I never asked you out. I tried to find you, but I couldn’t. I’m really sorry, but I think there’s been a mix up.” He said this all quickly. Cho blinked.
Harry released his hand to shove Draco playfully. Draco shoved back, and they playfully pushed each other until Harry almost ran headlong into a building. Draco laughed at him, throwing his arm around Harry’s shoulders and kissing the top of his head, soothing Harry’s annoyance.
“Well, that’s the thing.” Draco said, glancing at Harry. “Thanks, by-the-way, for calling it marriage. We prefer the term.”
Harry smiled, and leaned forward to hug Sal. Draco seemed hesitant. “I appreciate that, Ms. Perks. It would dire if anyone were to find out about us.”
Harry was almost painfully hard. Draco was stroking him at a brutal pace, as if he wanted Harry to come as quickly as possible. He was sucking at a pace just as hard. He was really enjoying what Draco was saying, and there was just a sliver of shame. In the back of his head he briefly wondered if there was something wrong with him. Instead of making it worse, it made the experience more delicious. He was whining and moaning around a mouthful of cock, quietly so he could still hear Draco.
Harry choked. If he had been drinking something, he would have spit it out. He laughed uproariously, “Hagrid!” As if he would want other people looking at Draco. “Don’t you think that’s a bit extreme?”
Harry leaned over to kiss him on the cheek and neck a couple times, but Draco didn’t get involved, too entranced by the movie happening to focus on Harry. He chuckled lightly and tried to focus on the movie, but Draco was so distracting. He kept gasping, jumping, cooing, squeezing Harry’s hand, patting him on the arm to make sure he was paying attention, muttering to himself, screaming and cheering.
Draco started rocking him side to side and Harry tilted his head back to kiss Draco’s cheek. That rule didn’t apply to Draco. He found him beautiful and he understood him.
Draco accepted the cup from him and took a seat at the table. “I decided to go by texture rather than color, because I’ll be able to eyeball it from across the room, but I won’t be able to feel unless I’m right next to them.”
“Whatever you want,” Harry agreed. Draco looked up, ordering a bottle of mid-range wine, and the waitress raised her eyebrows, though she still looked pleased.
Sirius was already gone for the day, so Harry made a quick breakfast. “You’re welcome to come with me, I don’t want you to think I’m purposefully leaving you out.” Harry told him as they dug in. “I just don’t want you to be bored as I drag you all over Diagon Alley.”
“Not everything.” Hermione agreed. Harry felt his jaw drop. “Then again, we have a couple secrets too.”
“Hermione,” Harry couldn’t help the rush of anger and hurt he felt at that. “I didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt!”
That’s what Harry thought, at least until what came to be known as ‘The Ferret Incident.’ Several times a week, Draco would do something to mess with Harry. Mostly, it was a couple harmless words, Harry would retaliate, and they would all move on with their day. Harry had convinced Draco to lay off of Ron and Hermione a bit to help keep the peace between the two of them.
Harry looked to Draco, who had stopped to wait for them. “Hell yeah!” He exclaimed. He grabbed Harry’s hand and started racing to the back of the line, cutting people off as they ran.
Harry returned to his story. “Things got complicated with Fudge, he came in while I was sleeping, earlier. He doesn’t want to believe that Voldemort’s back. He thinks that Crouch Jr. and Pettigrew were working together, and they kidnapped me, and he’s willing to believe there was a Death Eater meeting, but he’s not willing to say that Voldemort’s back, despite the evidence.”
He closed his eyes and thought of him, everything he loved and everything he hated. They blended together. Thousands of images flew in his mind’s eye, each a wonderful memory, even the bad ones, because they contained Draco.
“We wanted you to come, but Dumbledore said that you were safer there!” Harry choked, then threw his hands up as he started laughing. It was deep and devoid of humor.
He stared at it, wondering what the hell had just happened. He knocked on the door, but Draco just yelled at him to go away again. He tried the doorknob, but it was locked. He could probably unlock it with magic pretty easily, but that would be breaking some relationship rule, he was sure. He let out a deep breath, and let his fist fall on the door one last time before he turned. He didn’t like how they had left things, but he wasn’t sure what else to do.
“This would have been better in the order you said first, but I understand why we’re doing it this way. You’re doing that wrong, by the way, here.” He showed Harry how to do all the stuff he thought he had learned how to do for this moment. He was hardly embarrassed, however; he had never been pamper like Draco had.
“Father, didn’t you invest heavily in the Visiomagic company?” Came Draco’s drawling voice from further down the row.
He shook his head to clear the memories. It had been a month since he had been taken from Hogwarts, and he missed it more and more every day. Well, that wasn’t
“It’s me,” Mandy said quietly, feeling tears stinging at her eyes. “You’re not dreaming Sally. I’m here to save you. If…well, you need to come with me.” Sally just blinked at her. “I’m not sure how much you know about our world, but things are getting bad. Even if you want to stay here, I think Death Eaters are going to come after you eventually. My parents are waiting, and we’re going to leave the country until it’s safer. My mum’s a muggleborn, they’ll be coming for her too.”
“You just want to hold me.” He accused. Harry didn’t dignify that with a response. “Uh-huh. Sirius, can you levitate my bag?” His trunk was still at Hogwarts, presumably, but they probably weren’t coming back, so Draco had apparently packed everything he couldn’t live without. Harry looked around the room, taking it in.
Harry volunteered to do the cleaning up with Mrs. Weasley, hoping to be able to tell her gently and respectfully that he didn’t want a party, but Mrs. Weasley didn’t understand. She thought he was just being bashful, and told him it wasn’t any trouble.
Draco clucked his tongue at him. “Because you love me more than anything, and I know how much you’re torturing yourself over this. Harry, this isn’t your fault.” He reached for Harry’s hand. Harry was about to open his mouth, but Draco went on. “I know it’s not, I don’t blame you. And if you need to hear it, then here it is: I forgive you.”
Neither moved for a long moment. “Are you going to get them?” Draco asked, trying to hold in his chuckles.
“It doesn’t matter! And I have not been lying to you! I have never lied! You and Hermione agreed that it was ok for us to have some secrets!”
I hope no one is too mad at me for what happened to Sally-Anne. I did consider much worse things happening to her, so I hope that helps. This does answer the question of where she went, as she's mentioned in the first book, but not the fifth. I’ve always been curious about that, and I love hearing theories. I don’t know if anyone will read close enough to tell, but the handkerchief Mandy wiped her eyes with in this chapter is the same one Sally-Anne gave her the previous year when she was crying before the Yule Ball.
"I'm just going to run around the Quidditch pitch. Nothing is going to happen to me." Harry took his wand from the pocket of his discarded robe and wondered where to tuck it so that it would not disrupt his running. When he was running during the summer, he did not have to bring his wand around as he was prohibited from using magic in the summer.
Day laid beside her ripped off clothes with her blood all over her naked body. Her left hand was twisted in the way that indicated that it was likely to be broken. Where her body was not covered with blood they could see bruises forming. Harry pulled off his robe and flung it on top of Day, as he gently picked Day up, trying to ignore the large amount of blood on the floor under his shoes.
"Will this be in our N.E.W.T.s?" Hermione asked. Everyone was trying to control their laughter, but a few sniggers escaped from some of the students.
Within ten minutes, Harry was dressed and ready to go. They exited through the panel, greeted Marcus by introducing themselves to Marcus so that he knew exactly who reside in the room. They then went down the stairs to the Gryffindor common room, which had some Gryffindors sitting around waiting for their friends to go for breakfast. Then they saw a short-haired Chinese girl rushing up from the girls' dorm and heading towards them.
It was then that Harry's legs decided to collapse. Draco caught him on the way down and let him sit on a chair behind him. He sat on the arm of the chair brushing Harry's hair to soothe Harry. Using his wand, he muttered a cleaning spell on Harry's bloodstained clothes before leaning his nose against Harry's right temple. He needed to feel Harry near him, otherwise he felt as if he was going to explode at any moment. He could feel Harry trying to comfort him mentally. He briefly wondered if this was going to be how their relationship would be going, by him comforting Harry physically and Harry comforting him mentally.
"But I don't mind waking up early for HER." Ron frowned at himself as he got up. "Harry. Ten minutes."
"I guess when you two finally made love, your magic melded so completely that you are able to connect with the innermost magical part of Hogwarts. It just brought you here." Godric replied.
The lessons after lunch were Advanced Charms, except for Draco, who had Advanced Potions in the dungeons. Neville had the afternoon free and offered to walk Draco to the dungeons. Although Draco bristled at the fact that he had to be escorted to the class, he kept silent as he knew that it was necessary that he was not alone. Professor Snape seemed relieved at seeing Neville appear with Draco for the same reason. Upon completing his task, Neville couldn't wait to go back to his dorm room, exiting the dungeons quickly as Draco got ready for his lesson.
"Seam, Dean was just trying to help you with YOUR argument, why are you trying to bite his head off? Unless… you want Dean to check YOU out? Is there something you should tell Dean?" Harry cheekily asked, trying to help Dean test the waters. Seamus refused to meet Harry's eyes and to the amazement of everyone present in the room, he blushed.
"You, can help me train. Ron, how about it? Someone who can help you think Quidditch strategies? He won't leak it to the Slytherins now. And he was a good player." Harry looked at Ron. Draco looked at Ron too.
Both of them stayed in that room till fifteen minutes before dinner, talking about their childhood. Draco told him about his childhood at the manor, where he had to be very well-disciplined as a child. His father already started teaching him dark curses before he even knew that they were prohibited, and would beat him every time he misbehaved or failed to learn a spell within the allocated time. Draco had learnt since young to harden himself against his father's insults and learnt to think on his own. His childhood was the reason why he actually dared to say 'no' in front of Voldemort. He wanted to stop living in his father's shadows. Harry then told Draco about his childhood living under the stairs and being the maid of his muggle relatives. How they ignored him when they didn't want him there and scolded and insulted his parents and himself when they were angry. Whenever either one started getting upset by what he was saying, the other would send comfort waves through the mind link to soothe him. Finally, before leaving the room, Draco repaired the broken window with his wand.
Dean shot Seamus a look. Seamus for once was paying attention to the professor and scribbling his notes on the parchment, and did not see what happened with Harry and Draco. Dean cautiously leant over and followed Harry's previous position with his chest lightly touching Seamus' right arm and Dean's left hand behind Seamus. He nearly couldn't control his elation when he felt Seamus freeze up and shoot him a glance. He copied the notes he missed when he was observing at Harry and Draco and then slowly pulled back when he finished. He nearly smiled when he saw Seamus looking at him with the deer in the headlights look in his eyes and casually gave a grin to thank him for letting him copy the notes. He then faced the front, keeping an eye on Seamus' face. Seamus looked at his parchment, swallowed, and bit his bottom lip, before glancing at Dean again. He then seemed to come to the conclusion that Dean did not mean to lean that close and looked up at the professor. However, he did not continue to take down any more notes as his mind seemed to be a mess at that moment.
Draco smiled at the black-haired man. "For fun. Harry constructed a similar wall at the infirmary a week ago. So I was thinking that if the texture could be converted to other types of texture, then it would be interesting. It would be good if we actually change the inner texture to such that it protects us but does not stop our own spells from going out. That way it would be effective against people attacking us."
Dumbledore sighed. "They confessed under Veritaserum. The reasons of the attack were … they were under the orders of Voldemort to kill a good friend of the two of you and she was the only one who was really unprotected and had the tendency of not traveling in groups. She also offended them in the past two months. She was a chaser for the Quidditch team and they wanted Slytherin to win. But the main reason was that Voldemort promised them initiation into the Death-eater circles if they could kill your friend and get away with it."
Ron then slung his arm around Harry and said casually "I never did tell you about Bill, did I? Well, he IS gay. I don't mind gay people, so long as they are not after me. You aren't in love with me, are you?" He added worriedly, looking at Harry. Harry shook his head, noticing that Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom, his other roommates actually didn't seem to mind as they were both smiling at him. All of them went back to changing into their pajamas. At least he didn't lose his friends over that. The next day Ron told his girlfriend Hermione Granger about Harry as she was also one of Harry's best friends and she also accepted his sexual preference. It seemed that the wizarding world was more accepting of gay people and Harry told his friends that he did not want to hide it. However, Harry, being Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived, was so famous that by the end of the day the whole school knew, even the professors. The new gossip from then on was who his current boyfriend was, but since he did not get a boyfriend at all the whole year, everyone was left guessing.
The next period was Herbalogy. Of the whole group, only Harry, Draco and Hermione had a free period, as the rest headed towards the greenhouses. The three of them who were free made their way to the library, with Harry whining all the way.
All the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws settled into their DADA class with excitement. Past experience told them that Professor Lupin's class was always interesting. Professor Lupin strode in from his breakfast and stood in front of everyone.
Harry stared at the back of Draco's figure as he disappeared into their room. He looked so lonely. As an 'outsider' it took Draco less then three hours to see what had been in front of him for six years. He recalled that since as a first year, after the welcoming feast, he would subconsciously let everyone enter the dorm room before him. His experience with his relatives made him used to walking behind everyone when entering a room. When they chose their beds, he had just accepted the only bed left, happy to at least GET a bed, never wondering why he had always got the bed furthest from the door. He never noticed that his friends in the recent two years had persistently waited for him outside the classroom to walk with him to the next class no matter how late he was detained by the professor. He just accepted it as house spirit. Then he remembered an incident when he was in the infirmary the previous year. Draco was also injured from the same Quidditch match. When he woke up, he was greeted by the numerous get-well cards on the table beside his bed, some of them even from students whom he never knew. When he glanced at Draco's bed, his table was empty, as if no one cared that he was lying in the infirmary. However Harry just shrugged it off at that moment. Then he recalled offering friendship to Draco in the Great Hall just now and briefly wondered how Draco had survived the six years in Slytherin.
Almost every meal was being held at the Great Hall. It was the only place in the whole school that seemed to be able to take in so many people at one go. Thus the Great Hall was enchanted to be especially grand because it was after all the venue of every important event of the school. The candles were spelled to be able to magically burn eternally and the ceiling was enchanted to show good weather, be it day or night. As Harry seated with his friends at the Gryffindor table, he looked up at the teachers' table and suddenly broke into a big grin. When Ron noticed him grinning, he too turned towards the teachers' table and realized what made Harry grin. As students drifted to their seats and noticed the teacher for the Defense against Dark Arts class, they started whispering to each other. Most of the students who did know the teacher were smiling as their previous experiences with that teacher were good, even though he was a werewolf, and these students knew that they were at least going to learn something useful this year for that particular class. Only the Slytherins seemed to be scowling away.
Harry walked towards Day, tossing a wrapped sandwich towards her. Using her Chaser reflexes, she caught and unwrapped it. Biting into the sandwich, she watched both Harry and Draco warily as she chewed. Draco leant against the wall next to her and was staring at her with his grey eyes. Harry was leaning against one of the sinks and casually crossed his arms in front of him. A thought hit her, if those two in front of her were not wizards; they could easily be models out in the muggle world. She grinned to that.
"See, you didn't believe me when I said that I could predict our first lesson. Double potions with the Slytherins." Ron muttered to Hermione.
Draco smiled. "Somehow, I think we discovered our newest power. Maybe we should get Dumbledore to teach us wandless magic." Harry nodded as he relaxed onto the bed. He closed his eyes and could feel Draco doing the same, as both drifted to sleep after the long day. They would need the energy to deal with tomorrow.
"Ten minutes for me to get up, wash up and dressed to face Snape for double Potions. Our schedule had always been sadistic over the years. Or have you forgotten?" Harry grinned at Draco. Draco was already dressed in his school robe, his hair neatly combed and his bag ready to go. He picked up his bag and looked at his mirror one last time.
"You mean you didn't hear?" Dean asked, after coming into the compartment with Seamus. Harry shook his head.
Both boys blinked at the sudden change of subject. Both nodded, as they recalled their free periods in which they were actually unwilling to leave the dorm to face the outside people, as they just wanted to be with each other.
"I also don't get something. Why didn't Dumbledore just leave me be? Why would he want me be protected like his darling Gryffindor Heir? I'm nowhere as important. That bastard already killed my whole family." Draco injected.
As Harry listened to it, he realized that this was the last sorting of the first years he was going to see. Memories flowed in his mind as he recalled what happened the last six years. Before he was eleven, he never knew that there was a world out there that actually wanted him alive. Then he found out the truth about his parents' death and in the process of trying to live till his twelfth birthday, he faced Voldemort for the second time in his life. In the year after that he faced Voldemort's sixteen-year-old self in the Chamber of Secrets. The year after that he found out that his godfather Sirius Black was alive and had been wrongly accused of the crime of betraying Harry's parents. Then came the year in which he took part in the Triwizard Tournament, nearly dying in the end when dueling with Voldemort. They say that a cat had nine lives. He himself wondered how many lives he has. For the past two years, Voldemort did not really try to come after him. But he did send his death eaters to harm different wizards and witches as well as some muggles. He seemed to be trying to gather as much power as possible before the day Harry graduate, in ready to kill Harry. Harry then briefly wondered if Pansy already received the Death Mark.
"Why am I not surprised? Strange things seemed to follow you two around. I should have suspected." He said. All a sudden, four chairs flew towards them, stopping behind each of them. "Please sit down while I explain." Everyone sat down. Harry and Draco were frowning in confusion. "Sirius, want to help explain the situation?" Dumbledore seemed to have regained his good humor and no longer seemed as serious as the previous moment.
"She defended me on the first day of school. Without me around, Parkinson wouldn't even notice her. It's my fault." Draco said, finally giving up the fight to remain calm as he leant down to place his face at Harry's neck, breathing in his essence. Harry's arms came around him and a tug caused Draco to be seated on Harry's lap as Harry tried to bring himself as close to Draco as possible.
Therefore, the whole group of them found themselves settling down in their common room, surrounded by the other Gryffindors. Ron was playing chess with the different people in the common room, and Hermione and Harry were persuaded by Draco to teach him the new charms that they had learnt in the Advanced Charms class. His reasoning was that since he had time, it would benefit him to learn more charms. After learning the new charms, he ventured towards the chess group, while Harry joined the group playing Exploding Snap and Hermione went back to her books. When Draco came to the chess group, he found that the other students had ganged up together against Ron, with the only two spectators, Day with Snuffles, seated observing them. No one seemed to be questioning why the DOG was watching the chess game. Draco sat down beside Sirius and nudged Sirius to lay his head on his lap to be scratched.
All of a sudden, Draco could feel all sorts of feelings sweep across him. Anger, frustration, fear, love and comfort. When the last two emotions swept across his whole body, he tightened his embrace around Harry because he realized that the emotions were coming from Harry. He wondered why he could suddenly feel Harry's emotions. He then realized that Harry seemed to be calming down, as his sobbing became sniffling.
Day hurried along the dark passageways as she made her way back to the Gryffindor dorms. Her detention had ended late because of some plants which had grown too huge for their pots and Professor Sprout had requested their re-potting in the last minute. Glancing at her watch and reading the time using the limited light from her surrounding, she found that she barely had five minutes to go back to her dorm before curfew started.
"You could have been a slytherin you know, with that neat little trick." Draco commented, taking a sip of the pumpkin juice.
"Harry… Harry… come back to me… why… Harry… it's Dray… come back to me… and tell me why you are sobbing… Harry…" Draco mumbled into Harry's neck, as Harry snuggled into his body, seemingly wanting to hide from the whole world out there. Draco didn't know what to do but to hold on to Harry and hope for the best. Harry seemed to come back to himself, realizing that he was sobbing into Draco's robes and tried to stifle his sobbing. "It's okay to cry. Cry all you want. Just tell me why later." So Harry went on sobbing to his heart's content. All Draco did was to hold on to Harry, caressing the back of Harry's neck with one hand.
"Herm, Ron will know what to do, after all he is the Captain." Draco answered, seeing Ron indicate to the team to go down to the stands for lunch. Everyone but Day flew down immediately. Day just shook her head and seemed to go on practicing flying. Draco frowned. He then pulled away his attention from Day when Harry came up and collapsed in front of Draco. Draco handed him a towel that he had ready for him to wipe his perspiration so as to not get a chill. Hermione just shook her head as she started laying out the lunch the house elves put together on a picnic cloth for the team. Dean started to pour drinks for everyone.
"I was thinking about something. You guys told me that Day is a fifth year. And her O.W.L.s are lovely. Something is not right. People only take their O.W.L.s at the END of fifth year." Draco asked.
Harry remembered the Draco Malfoy he knew for the past six years. Then he remembered that when he heard Pansy order Crabbe and Goyle to beat Draco, there was a sense of protectiveness that he was not sure if it was due to the fact that he was attracted to Draco or that Draco was a fellow human being.
"Down, Snuffles. Ron, after all, Snuffles did belong to me for three weeks before school started. Who did you think was my bodyguard when I was at Hogwarts?" Draco grinned back at Ron, throwing two more chicken wings behind him to Sirius. Sirius settled down to finish the chicken.
Looking at his watch, he realized that he day-dreamed quite a large bit of the lesson away, missing the notes that he was supposed to take. Glancing at Draco who was studiously taking notes on his parchment which was full of notes, he slowly leant himself over Draco's right shoulder, placing his left hand over the back of Draco's chair, and started copying the notes that he missed.
Draco stared at the mirror as he brushed his teeth. Harry was in the shower cubicle behind him, humming to some tune that Draco had never heard before. He shook his head at how silly Harry could be sometimes.
Both Draco and Harry had their hands clenched. Both were trying to control their tempers upon hearing this. So it was true that it was their fault, isn't it?
The two boys looked a little ill at the thought that they had to tell her the reason she was there. They exchanged glances and finally looked at her again. It was Draco who answered her question.
Then his mind turned towards Dean, as his thoughts went to a certain ring pouch in his drawers. He knew that they were only together for a few months, but those few months were the best, especially after these few years as he spent so long pining after Dean. He bought the rings on an impulse when Dean, Neville and Ginny and himself did some shopping under the strict monitoring of Professor Lupin. Dean was at the other end of the shop looking at some leather necklaces when he picked that pair of rings with the professor grinning at him. He came back and was immediately asked by Draco on what he bought, as Draco was famous for having a shopping fetish. When he discreetly shown Draco the rings and told him that he was just waiting for the right moment to give them to Dean, Draco's eyes lit up and he actually hugged Seamus, till Dean and Harry noticed and frowned at them. Seamus quickly slipped the pouch into his pocket. However he had the feeling that Draco told Harry because a few hours later, during dinner, Harry kept looking at him with a joyful grin.
"Well, Day sort of adopted Harry as an older brother two years ago. Day was an only child and had always been lonely before she came to Hogwarts. She was really hyperactive in the first two years she came but Harry got her to convert all her excess energy into playing Quidditch as a chaser. That's why she's so remarkable down at the pitch." Ron explained to Draco. Draco knew who Day Lee was. He had to admit that on the pitch, that girl's skills were impressive. The reason why after so many years Slytherin still lost the Quidditch Cup to Gryffindor was due to the Gryffindor team's ability to come up with the best people to replace the seniors who graduated. Their chasers were disciplined yet aggressive enough; their beaters had the ability to synchronize with each other to protect their players, their keeper was competent enough and their seeker was very skillful in the air. Slytherins tended to have students who were clumsier in comparison.
Draco then caught sight of Day, who was practicing with Ron, by shooting all sorts of funny goals at him. She had refused to miss any more practices, after lying in the infirmary for three days under Madam Promfrey's naggings. She did agree to going for a few appointments with a mind healer to talk over her trauma, so that she could sleep better at night. When she was finally released from the infirmary, Draco and Harry were waiting for her to bring her to her new room. It was lunchtime and thus the common room was empty, and she didn't have to face anyone whom she was not ready to face yet. She went upstairs with the two boys, and they introduced her to Marcus, and told her the password. They then entered the Study area, where there was an additional table with Day's things on it, which Ginny and Hermione had made the trip to Day's previous room to move them up. They also moved her clothes and personal stuff into the closet beside the new bed in the girls' room. Day was fascinated with the place, as well as with the Marauder's Map. Later in the evening, when Draco and Harry had gone up to the dorm to pick her up for dinner, they found her sitting at a corner of the common room talking to Headless Nick, who was telling Day about the adventures he had while he was alive. Both of them were amused by the fact that when Day was bored, she would even attempt talking to the castle ghosts. However, no matter how Day said that she wanted to be strong after the ordeal, Draco noticed in the next few days that whenever she was in a place with too many people, she would be more tense than normal and that when her friends from her year greeted her, she would shy away from contact if possible and only allow the group that she shared her room with to touch and be close to her. Even within the eight of them, people like Neville and Ron were trying to give her space and Dean and Seamus were always clinging on to each other. Ginny and Hermione were not the type who went around touching people, and thus the only people who really touched Day were actually just Harry and Draco. Draco was glad that Day trusted the two of them, but it was actually unhealthy for her. He sighed, as he presumed that he had to give Day time for her to get used to everything. After all, it had only been a week since the attack had happened, and hopefully the appointments with the mind healer would start to help her soon.
He walked out of the bathroom and saw that Dean was up, as he dropped a kiss on Seamus' forehead when he passed him to go to the bathroom. Seamus shot him a quick grin to tell him wordlessly that he was forgiven for kicking him out of bed the night before. As he changed into his Quidditch robes, his eyes went to his drawer. He opened it and placed the ring pouch into his pocket as well, without wondering why. He just felt that there would be a perfect moment coming up on that day.
"We don't know. Not many soul mates were recorded in history. The theory was that powers given to soul mates were not fixed. We don't want to tell you much as it is better that your bodies developed your own set of powers. But one thing is for sure. The powers that will surface will greatly depend on the magical powers you both hold.  As soul mates, you are actually functioning as a whole unit. That means that when you do magic, you use magic from a pool of magical powers shared between the two of you. And seeing that you are both heirs, you have a greater pool than the normal pairs of soul mates." Dumbledore explained.
"It's eleven. Day's not back yet. Detention should have ended long ago." Draco picked up his stuff, as he saw Ron and Hermione packing up. Harry packed his things up as well.
"Why did you not mention it to me for so long? Oh God. And last year I…" Dean sighed as he remembered the previous year's events. He must have hurt Seamus so much.
Dean was wondering what Seamus was thinking when he didn't say anything. He wondered if Seamus was too shocked as he seemed to have difficulty breathing and his eyes turned misty. "Seamus?"
"Hiding your emotions. Everyone tells me that they can read me like an open book. I don't want Voldemort to read me so easily." Harry commented.
Nobody saw a discreet nod from a male Slytherin seventh year to a female Gryffindor Qudditch chaser and the answering nod back with a small smile.
Harry bristled at first that his precious owl had been referred to as a 'thing' and calmed himself to endure the last half hour that he had to endure with this horrible being in front of him and answered plainly "At school" and his uncle asked not a single word more as Harry loaded his trunk and cage into the car and they set off for the station.
"All these intention to harm, intention to control, all it actually means is to have the ability to do something to others. When you control a certain person's actions, that person lose power to you. The Imperius curse allows you to have the power over a person's actions. The Cruciatus Curse allows you to have power over a person's pain. The Killing Curse allows you power over a person's lifespan. They say that to be immortal means that you have power over nature. The power over something is what defines the dark magic and the dark creatures." Draco explained.
"What does it mean… if a dot is… flickering?" Draco looked up at Harry, who was frowning at the flickering dot labeled Day Lee.
As soon as the whole group stepped into the common room, Professor Lupin turned to them, "Can all the seventh year boys please follow me? Miss Granger, Miss Weasley, please follow me as well." He then turned towards the staircase of the boys dorms and went up the steps with Snuffles following behind him. Hermione and Ginny looked at the boys and shrugged, following the whole group up the stairs.
Harry smiled at Dean. "Then we can safely say that you are at least bisexual. And… maybe you should tell Seam about it." Harry had never seen Dean's eyes grow that big before as he burst into laughter.
Draco licked his lips slowly, catching Harry staring at them. "Never? All the more to slow down. Kissed before?" Harry shook his head. Draco breathed in deeply. The fact that Harry was … SO inexperienced was so tempting. "Want to try a kiss first?" Draco whispered in a husky voice.
Professor Dumbledore then held up his hands and the whole hall silenced. "I know that you all are hungry but there is a certain matter that needs to be settled before everybody eats. As many of you have come to know, a very strange thing happened during the summer. The whole Malfoy clan have been slaughtered by Voldemort and the only living heir of the family is Draco Malfoy, a current seventh year Slytherin. The reason for the horrible slaughter was due to the fact that Mr Draco Malfoy refused to be recruited by Voldemort. Due to his action, he had been blacklisted by all the Death eaters. Since we have another student here, Mr. Harry Potter from Gryffindor, who is under the same case here, we decided that it is easier to protect both students in the same place. Mr Malfoy is taken out of Slytherin and will spend the last year under no house. However, he will be residing in the Seventh year Gryffindor Dorm together with Mr Potter, and I sincerely hope that all Gryffindor students will allow him the same kind of respect and protection you have offered to Mr Potter all these years." Draco Malfoy stepped out from a side door and sneered at Snuffles in front of him. The dog seemed to narrow his eyes and got up from his spot to sit at Remus' feet, holding his head high as if he could not stand the sight of Malfoy.
“So the rules are simple,” Finch-Fletchley blurted out to the teenagers. “You two have to go in the broom closet down the hall and stay there for seven minutes!”
“I know Potter,” she lightly whispered. “You’ve had to take on more that any one person in a lifetime should, but I stand with what I said to you outside the Hospital Wing. Nobody is expecting you to do this.”
He turned his neck to her, the rest of his body too rigid to move. She stood smiling at him without a care in the world. She was clearly choosing to ignore the fact Draco was almost hyperventilating and hadn’t moved an inch from where she left him.
Harry itched the side of his head, “just normal really. To be honest, he didn’t even respond, it could have only been thirty seconds max.”
He cared. Potter cared. They were surrounded by people but Potter was solely focused on him, only his body received his touch. He pushed off the stone, turning to look directly at Harry Potter. Draco swore, if he died he would want that face sketched on his eyelids.
“For god's sake Ginny, what was all of that down there? Calling me out in front of our friends,” he spat, suddenly feeling a sense of intense anger filter through his being.
The uneven spiral staircase up to the classroom was always a difficult mission, odour ridden teenagers shoving up against you trying to get the best seat in the class. He followed his normal regime, keep tense with an arm to the wall, squeezing through the crowds so nobody would notice.
“He assaulted a boy. The Thomas’ are fully aware of this and I need to be able to give them answers, it’s one thing allowing Malfoy back into our classrooms but for the parents to hear about this would surely ruin us! He tried to sexually assault one of my boys, I’m sorry I can’t let this blow over. I had hoped he would have matured after the war but obviously, he hasn’t and honestly I am inclined to say Azkaban might be better suited to him.”
Shrill shrieks reverberating off the stone walls greeted Harry as he turned down the otherwise quiet corridor. Just minutes ago he was in the comfort of his own bed and now he was back on a hunt. His spine naturally curving into a crouch, his right arm forcefully out in front of him and his shallow staccato breaths puffing in the air, he was back.
Potter stopped mid-sentence, his eyes scanning the sunken shape of Draco’s face as if he were searching for answers on a map made up of Draco’s sweat-filled pores.
In mere seconds, Draco felt as if his blood had been ignited as a pair of hands pressed into his sides. Clearly, the Boy Wonder had no clue as to the identity of the clumsy male lying flat on his face but Draco didn't want to believe that. He had never experienced anything so blissful, the pads of his mate’s fingers penetrating his body, so close to his-
Thomas suddenly appeared enthralled by the stonework on the floor. Was the Headmistress saying what Draco thought she was saying?
The headmistress glided over to the desk where Draco was perched. He could see Potter rolled his eyes. He pretended it didn’t rip out his heart.
Scavage stepped forward, “I ain’t been an auror for sixteen year ta be lied to by kids. Now, I’ll ask ya again Potter. What ya doing ‘ere?”
It was uncomfortable for Harry to wrap his fingers around, the talon being hard and cold so he just lightly rested his palm on the top.
“Will you tell me what happened with Dean? And what’s happening now?” Potter glanced back down to Draco’s face, tightened his hold on Draco who was finding it increasingly hard to concentrate.
Potter shifted on the charmed bed, careful not to break their contact. Draco accessed his mate’s face, he looked tired and frustrated, something which Draco had a strong urge to fix but he also noticed Potter’s eyes flickering to Draco’s bare torso.
Harry’s jaw visibly tensed, eyes staring down at his drunken girlfriend. His mouth contouring around the words the potion wanted him to say.
“How long do you think I have left?” Wide grey orbs stared across the girl’s dormitory looking right through Pansy.
Draco’s cold eyes went wide at the statement. Whether it was the alcohol or the potion, Draco noticed Potter had a sheered layer to his skin and a foggy look to his eyes. He shifted his body slightly to be more in line with the Slytherin, an unspoken tension palpable in the air.
“Really Malfoy? Don’t think you’re getting too old for this act?” Draco twisted his head to face his Mate, every second burning into his irises. Potter sat back on his heels.“…You need to start actually owning up to the shit you put others through, if it wasn’t for Pomfrey you wouldn’t even be here right now Malfoy…”
“Malfoy?” The voice had softened ever so slightly and the figure squared down to his level. “Can you hear me?”
but you did,” she pushed herself down from the windowsill, landing mere inches away from Harry’s pulsating chest. “Of all people Harry, Malfoy. You went with Malfoy, you’ve completely embarrassed me…”
Stepping back the witch allowed a small gap for Harry to quickly slip through into the hospital wing.
A run of words crawl up his throat from the Veritaserum in his system, he tried to swallow the back down to no avail, “we, we-“
The Headmistress inhaled deeply, taking in the disheveled appearance of the boy sat in front of her. She sighed, “The situation is… Unorthodox.”
Let me know what you think to this chapter and feel free to call me out for being the worst at posting x
He could feel the crispness of the dried blood merging with the cotton on his back sticking together, it was inevitable that it would bleed again. The time had moved on but he wasn’t sure if it were mere minutes of hours. He was immobilised.
The boys froze, both surprised by the words that had come out of Draco’s purple lips. After a few seconds Potter shook his head for the second time and headed for the door.
“Yes- I mean, no,” Potter shook his messy hair. “Actually Malfoy, if I’m honest? I don’t know what you’re like.”
Elegantly, Pansy twirled in front of him, her hair bouncing around her chin. She did decide to change. Into a black dress that Draco didn’t think look any less ‘trollop-y’, but who was he to judge in his current predicament. She liked it and it distracted Draco from his attempted suicide mission.
Cheers erupted, everyone, heading to the floor making a circle. Draco stayed laid against the steps, swigging more of the bottle.
“Urgh, not this again,” he rolled his eyes, suddenly taking great interest in the achromatic trumpet solo on the tiny stage. Well, until a big pale hand waved in front of his eye line. “Jesus Christ Ron, What?”
Something deep in the pit of his stomach burst. Draco pulled away in agony, managing to gain enough distance to let out a blood-curdling scream before he blacked out.
Someone out of Draco’s peripheral vision began abruptly laughing, encouraging a number of students to join in with mocking Draco’s misery. Potter hadn’t moved, his eyes glued to Girl Weasley, who was in turn, glaring at Draco with her mouth wide.
“You know it’s getting worse,” her voice dropped to a whisper as she perched on the edge of the bed, “Four days Draco, you only lasted four days after your last visit.”
want? You look bloody awful!” Draco rolled his eyes and started to head back to the common room, Pansy close at his side. Through the archways, he could see the night had pulled in engulfing the castle into what felt like perpetual darkness. “You didn’t tell her you did it, did you?!”
Although that didn’t stop Harry’s mind wondering what the Great Hall would hold on today as he entered for breakfast. A fill of relief and sheer happiness entered him as he stepped into the formidable hall. The strong scent of cinnamon dancing around the room, the archways along the walls filled with snow-kissed trees and most importantly the never-melting snow trickling down from the vast ceiling. Christmas was finally upon them.
“Oh Draco,” a familiar voice echoed in the distance. Quick footsteps grew in volume and Draco’s eyes adjusted to the figure approaching. Once Madame Pomfrey reached the bed, she grabbed a damp cloth and began carefully pushing the dampness on his forehead avoiding any skin contact. “Shh, shh my boy. Just calm down.”
He was aware that something was not right. Dean had never bothered Draco after the war, sure a handful of glares had been thrown in passing, but defiantly not an exchange of words. Shuffling backwards, the Slytherin felt the contact of his shoes with the back of the next step.
“He could be your mate Dray!” She nudged into his side hard, ignoring Draco’s weeps of pain. “You should go over!”
“Ah, so you did just want a fight,” her hand slipped down from his cheek on to stubbled jaw, slowly caressing down his sweating torso until she rested her hand gently over his crotch.
Inside was a nightmare waiting to happen. If there had been a lull in socialising due to their arrival, Pansy refused to notice it. Storming past the crowds of students to where the makeshift snack table had been set up, waving Draco over. He kept his head bent down past the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and shuffled over the short-haired carpet, trying to ignore the dirty looks and blaring muggle music. When he reached her she was already enthralled in a conversation with a tall Ravenclaw boy, Gavin Stepland. Stepland’s eyes drifted over Draco, turning his nose up at the ex-Death Eater. He wanted to believe Pansy didn’t see it.
“Look, just be more careful,” Potter sighed, a hand running through his wild locks. He was trying to look anywhere but Draco who was still crumpled on the steps. The last few students made their way past them, leaving the two boys alone in the airy stairwell.
“Well obviously,” she nodded, her voice low. “I got there and saw what you did to him. I know you were protecting yourself and I am sure the teachers will see it like that, he’s a criminal after all!”
Harry slowly dropped his head into a nod. If he was looking closely, he would have seen the drop in the Headmistress’ stoic expression.
The dull lighting covered the party, there was a definite buzz surrounding them. He took a swig of the drink, scowling at the harsh attack on his throat. Snippets of conversations filling his ears, he wanted it to stop. In seconds he slapped his goblet down on a nearby table, empty.
There was nothing graceful in the boy’s movements. One foot lagging behind the firm pace of the other. Every other stride causing him to upheave the strap on his shoulder in the prevention of his books crashing onto the floor. He looked weathered, even facially one could see the sheer sickliness on his already pale face. The dark circles framing his eyes like a Francis Bacon portrait, something traumatised and distorted. He hadn’t slept in days, or perhaps it was months, constant insomnia. During the war he couldn’t sleep, the pleas and cries ringing in his ears like tinnitus reminding him of his sins, not much has changed.
“I’ve been studying their movements this year and they’ve moved away from their normal spots like they are focusing on something bigger, more important”, carelessly she bounced forward and slipped onto the marble floor next to a jittery Malfoy. “Young Veela are uncommon here, no wonder they love you.”
Thankfully there was no blood, so when Pansy was dared to kiss him he didn’t soil her with crimson and she attempted to make it as painless as possible. He found himself the brunt of many dares, the majority being girls having to kiss him. The girls finding it absolutely abhorrent and not caring that it was ripping Draco’s insides apart, they were enjoying making him the butt of the joke.
The Gryffindor sighed lightly, letting his cloudy eyes focus on Draco. “Why didn’t you say anything about Dean?”
The group replied with sympathetic murmurs as Harry switched his focus onto manoeuvring four pancakes onto his plate without making a mess.
“Like I said, I just found him on the floor. Covered in blood…among other things,” Harry’s cheeks reddening. “He was delirious, saying lots of weird things-“
He knew that voice almost as well as his mates. The timbre slightly off and a slight sharpness present, he still didn’t move.
“You’ve got this allure thing anyway specifically for getting the attention of your mate,” she was exasperated. “Just use it!
A couple of waving arms were outstretched. Draco kept his head low, his shaking fingers urgently flicking through his scrolls.
“No Pansy, I wish it was that easy,” he allowed his voice to seep out. He let his eyes drift over the pathetic wings resting on his legs. “They won’t go back in, this shouldn’t have happened.”
“Allure?” Draco nodded, stopping at the intricate snake pattern on the wall, “Veela produce allure to attract their mate, as you are unbonded you probably are producing it without you realising.”
Tears formed in the corners of his eyes, the bubbling pleasure quickly turning into a roaring pain ripping his vertebrae apart.
“What the hell has happened?” Instinctively, she raised her hand to comfort the boy. He recoiled into the wooden door frame. “At least sit-down.”
“Tell me why I’m here,” he exasperated, “why did I have to hold your hand for two days? Why were you dying? What’s wrong with you?”
“Harry stop,” she whispered, trying to wiggle out of his strong grip. He clearly didn’t notice as his tongue lapped up the side of her jaw, arms caging her against the wall. “Stop it Harry.”
Suddenly Draco’s blown pupils bored into the Weasley Girl’s cutting her off, “Promise me something Weasley?”
“That’s not what I meant and you know it”. Harry glanced at his friend whose face had sunken like a sad puppy and was arched over his beer. “Ginny’s worried about ya, so’s Mione and even though Dean couldn’t make it tonight, don’t mean he hasn’t asked about it”.
He hadn’t noticed right away but now she was directly in front of him. She was wearing these peculiar acrylic block heel things, an incredibly short denim skirt with a bright yellow belt and a white vest that showed off the vibrant pink shade of her bra straps.
“So what are you guys doing for Christmas break?” Neville injected from the other side of the table.
“I know you’re my best mate but she is my little sister,” Ron sighed, patting the hand draped over Harry shoulder. “You should have told her where you were at, especially with her in that state about what you supposedly did to Malfoy.”
“Sorry I’m late, I was- Oh,” his head was down but he felt the dark gaze of those emerald eyes bore into the side of his skull. “What’s he doing here?”
“It takes three weeks to brew, you didn’t last four days Draco. Our only other option is St Mungos sending a batch over, however, I would need to provide patient information… You and I both know I can’t do that. I would lose my job. I still might.”
“He has a girlfriend Pans and she’s… Nice, he even smells like her most of the time… It makes me want to rip her limb from limb.”
All of my chapters have been written rater quickly so I do apologise for some errors however if anyone would be interested in becoming a beta for this story that would be amazing if you could let me know!
Deeply swallowing, Ron wiped the evidence of his breakfast off with the arm of his jumper, “I had no doubts, you said it would and it did! Harry here though, well he wasn’t too sure.”
She was lying on her front across her bed in a satin green pyjama set, a divination book wide open and quill twiddling between her fingers. Draco stood uncomfortably in the doorway, his cheekbones hollow and red-rimmed eyes.
“I reckon he's leading you into a false sense of security acting all strange to get your attention, then
“Draco!” He stopped, slowly turning to look at his only friend. His eyes rimmed in purple, his skin dull.
“Gin, I’m gonna head off,” he crocked out to his girlfriend who was sprawled across the rug with Hermione.
Draco prised his eyes open. They were in an empty Divination room. In seconds he found his mate’s gaze, evergreen orbs glaring into his soul. He looked severely pissed, looking at Draco as if he had spat in his face. The Weasel to his right standing far too close for Draco’s liking.
“-No! No, of course not Gin,” he rushed. Finally stepping towards her to engulf her in his arms but she jerked her body away from the embrace. “I promise you, Gin. I can’t lie right now remember?”
“You’re a twat Draco,” she wiped away the stray tears. Draco let half his mouth go into a smile, a broken laugh slipping out. “It’s the Ravenclaw party tonight.”
“Why is it we always end up here?” She had become quite familiar with this route over the past couple of weeks. She could see the smirk rise on Harry’s face as he rushed toward the patinated door, disappearing inside.
“Being in love and them loving you back unconditionally must feel nice,” his voice whispered more to himself than anyone else.
“Oh, how the mighty Malfoy has fallen…” She seductively licked her chapped lips, “first a traitorous Death Eater and now, I’ve heard a rapist?”
