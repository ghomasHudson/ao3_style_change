Smarting from the loss, Draco sank back against the sofa. “It’s the jumper,” he said disdainfully.
Harry gave up, tugging out his wand from his coat pocket, and Apparating, swooshing out of the frenzied crowd in a second.
“So you don’t hear the password,” Draco explained begrudgingly.
Draco did his best to keep himself fully focused on his plate for the remainder of breakfast, engaging in a mundane conversation about Charms classwork with Crabbe and Goyle, who were both characteristically stumped by the concept assigned to them.
Draco frowned, and then looked down at his chest, face paling more than usual when he saw the colours there.
“You better. I’m not having it get out that I only pretended to date someone. My image will be damaged enough by this ruse already and if you make it worse, I will hex your hands off,” Draco said matter-of-factly, finally releasing Potter’s arm.
Draco sniffed delicately and rolled his eyes. “Honestly, Potter, for someone so famous for escaping death in clever ways, you are awfully dense. There is no magical instant cure for a cold. You just tough it out.”
“Yes, the time has flown quickly.” Malfoy laughed genially, a sound softer than eleven year old Harry ever would have thought when he first met him. “It feels like just yesterday that we were starting our first year, and yet so many things have changed since then.”
“I said, it will represent the political—”
Goyle frowned. “But I thought you just said—”
“Are you coming to the match, Hermione?” Ron asked casually, staring hopefully at her.
The little wizarding village looked like something out of one of Dudley’s old picture books. Each storefront twinkled warmly, spotlighting its wares, and the upcoming holiday season was heralded in every nook and cranny, with spicy green wreaths and cheerful lights decorating what seemed like every inch of the small town. The whole atmosphere filled Harry with a lightheartedness he hadn’t felt in awhile and he met grinning passersby with a beaming smile of his own.
“Only stupid people would choose to be famous,” Harry said soberly, the high from the argument dissipating.
Harry half-listened to his friends’ bickering as he pushed around his breakfast, idly rubbing the raised ‘I must not tell lies’ scar on the back of his right hand while allowing his gaze to flicker to Malfoy, who was gingerly picking away at some toast now. The Slytherin really did look sick, his skin even paler than normal and his grey eyes unnaturally bright.
Merlin, if only he’d been a Hufflepuff, living without a jot of ambition! Then he wouldn’t be in this situation!
“Out of pity, because otherwise you’d be down in your frigid dungeon up to your ankles in slime all alone, because you don’t have any friends!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want to find her a copy of a certain play by a fellow called William Shakespeare,” Harry said, slipping carefully around a shelf to avoid knocking any of the books off, trying to see if there was any sort of apparent organizational system.
Christmas was important to Harry. It had been some of his only happy childhood memories from living with the Dursleys, when Dudley had been too distracted by his presents to bully him and there was so much food that even he could eat until he was stuffed. Then when he had gone to Hogwarts, the sheer magic that was displayed around the castle during the season was a reminder every day of the new world he had been given. It was the first time he had been given a present that wasn’t carelessly thrown at him at the last minute.
“Thanks,” Harry said hesitantly, staring at Malfoy’s oddly guileless expression for a moment before scribbling the information down.
Harry shrugged. “When it used to storm at school, Ron, Hermione, and I would get together and play board games until lights out to take our minds off of it. The whole Gryffindor common room would join in sometimes and it became sort of a tradition.”
“Well, I didn’t know if it was just the shock of the first kiss!” Harry protested.
should reteach me after we get back from the match.”
He entered the foyer as Malfoy opened the door, to reveal a group of five children grinning at them, bundled in coats, scarves, and hats, but still rosy-cheeked from the cold.
“Hold out your hand,” Malfoy ordered, tipping the bag over top of his own palm. Something silvery fell out, coating his pale skin.
“Would both of you please stop with the hysterics so we can go to class?” Hermione sighed, hitching her satchel up her shoulder. “We’re going to be late and then Professor Snape is
He heard Malfoy sigh in exasperation. Outside, the snow was still pelting down, large flakes sticking to the window pane, nearly obscuring Harry’s view of the yard entirely. Blustering wind gusts buffeted the snow in heavy white sheets down towards the ground, the normally soft beauty of a snow fall changed to violent natural attacks.
“Well, I guess we’ll see then, won’t we?”
“You’re only saying that because she doesn’t send you a maroon sweater every year,” Ron said darkly, nudging a familiar lumpy package with his foot.
“I’ve gone to a party before,” he retorted, affronted.
“Malfoy, you’re not going to find your Christmas present.”
“Oh, okay,” Harry scrambled, having difficulty focusing on the mercurial conversation while also managing to keep pace with Malfoy. “Well, I was thinking if there was any kind of shop that sells knitting needles—”
“Well, maybe I have it—” she began to suggest, pulling back from Ron, but Harry quickly cut her off.
.” Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes, but the sight of Potter’s eyes widening in surprise made the strange taste of the sappy endearment completely worthwhile.
As always, kudos and comments are appreciated! I love hearing what you think about Harry and Draco’s escapades and look forward to hearing what you think about what’s to come!
“Hey, you two, come carry my trunk!” She waved Crabbe and Goyle over, who were already holding their own luggage, but managed to drag Pansy’s large trunk along as well as the foursome exited the dorms.
Quietly tugging open the door, they slipped outside into another world.
“Were you raised in a barn?” Malfoy muttered, pulling out his wand and conjuring a flame within the fireplace.
Hope you are all excited for finale week!!! I know I am!!!
Torn between wanting to continue to avoid Malfoy and not wanting to make more trouble for the elf, Harry finally sighed. “Sure. That sounds great.” It wasn’t like he could avoid Malfoy for the entire trip anyway. It was
Draco wanted to smirk at the other boy’s strangled tone, but for the fact that his own stomach felt as though it were about to drop out onto the floor.
Malfoy sighed resignedly. “I guess we’d better. The damn charm is impossible to break.” He leaned forward and gave Harry a quick peck on the lips, the grip of the spell immediately breaking.
“Mr. Porter needs something?” The elf asked cheerily, an apron tied over his flannel shirt.
It wasn’t that Granger was smarter than he was, he reasoned to himself. She just had more practice tuning out Weasley and Potter, who slogged through classwork as loudly as a pair of banshees.
In which Harry loves his friends, but gets a bit tired of them, Ron and Hermione live in their own world, and Pansy triumphs over all.
, Potter,” he muttered.
“Understood,” Harry nodded with mock seriousness.
“Pansy!” Draco groaned, already questioning whether actually doing as Potter suggested and bringing one of his friends to play this Muggle game was a mistake.
Crabbe and Goyle shrugged, eager to be off to the food anyhow, and pushed through the doors. Pansy followed them, giving Potter a mocking wave. The gesture caused Potter to step towards her, jaw tightening, but Draco grabbed his arm before the Gryffindor could do something predictably stupid that would only add to the difficulty of the act they were about to put on. His friends already were going to be suspicious of their supposed union. Potter punching one of them would not help in the slightest.
"While waiting for Draco to come home, Harry starts worrying that he may have gotten stranded in the blizzard."
Ron shook his head fondly. “She loves a project. Some chess while we wait?”
“Have a good night,” they said, passing the two to-go cups to Harry.
Harry nodded. “Thank you.”
“O’Leary!” He called out, summoning the house elf with a ‘pop!’.
“It’s Potter,” Harry corrected gently. “And yes, it was delicious. I was just wondering if I could shovel the rest of the walkway for you.”
During the conflict with Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Ministry parties had been a rare occurrence. But now that the war was over, it seemed as though Harry got an invention to events every other night. Charities, and award ceremonies, with attendance levels skyrocketing at the mere mention of the Boy Who Lived Twice making an appearance. So naturally, Harry couldn’t bring himself to refuse, not when such worthy causes were at stake, even when he’d rather spend the evening in with his boyfriend, introducing him to Muggle films and trying to best him in their long-running wizard chess tournament.
Just like I planned. Mwahahaha!
, assumed that you were being held hostage by the slimy git and had to pretend everything was alright or he’d Avada you. So that’s why I’m here to rescue you, but I bashed my head on the chimney coming int through the Floo and stumbled into the Christmas tree and knocked some stuff off of it, so now he’s been alerted to my presence, but don’t worry, Harry, I don’t need the element of surprise to take him down!”
At first, Harry couldn’t tell what Ron was frowning at. His shirt was clean, his robes relatively free of the short hairs constantly being shed by Crookshanks, and his tie was knotted properly, if a bit loosely, and the skinnier end wasn’t longer the fat one. Actually, now that Harry was looking at it, he hadn’t tied his tie so nicely in awhile. It was verging on perfect . . . except for the fact that its stripes were not gold and crimson, but silver and green. Shit. He must have grabbed Draco’s tie after their altercation outside the Great Hall.
Malfoy looked up from his toast. “When was the last time you went there?”
Harry let go of his arm and shoved the silver carafe towards him.
“Well, I don’t know about that,” Malfoy said meaningfully, still refusing to look in Harry’s direction.
Potter turned back to the Ravenclaw. “Yes, in fact Draco and I have been dating for quite some time now and only recently decided to go public with the relationship.”
Wow, we're really getting down to it! Less than a week until Christmas. It's hard to believe.
“It’s nearly curfew though,” Draco tried reasoning, but instead found himself being wrapped up into his cloak and swept out of the library.
“Merlin, you’re at the bit about the Statute already? I’m still on Fudge’s five times great-aunt,” Potter groaned, dropping his quill onto the table dramatically and splattering ink across Weasley’s still mostly blank parchment.
“It was Cho. Remember how she was wailing on about Cedric during breakfast. I think she dragged him off to blubber some more.” Granger shook her head, bushy curls bouncing with the motion. Draco’s stomach sank, his suspicions about Potter and Chang confirmed.
Harry nodded along as the song began, the clashing of the wizarding and Muggle worlds oddly satisfying. Malfoy gave him a strange look as he began humming along, singing a few of the lyrics out loud just because he could.
“But you didn’t,” Harry whispered back, squeezing his hand. “You’ve changed.”
“So you’ve mentioned,” Ron muttered sarcastically, only to receive a quick jab in the ribs from Hermione. “Hey!”
Harry tensed, grabbing a snowball. “First one to get hit loses.”
“Shove off, mate!”
“God, Potter, you really are incapable of remaining standing,” he groaned. “That’s the third time you’ve tripped on top of me.”
“Standing in one place usually doesn’t involve fending off morons who don’t know how gravity works,” he shot back, rolling his eyes.
Harry thought about Malfoy sitting at a piano, holding on to music while his family had no money and no way to get it. “I’m sorry. About your family,” Harry whispered, looking at Malfoy, this boy who he had known for most of his life, while maybe never really knowing him at all.
The barista smiled sympathetically. “Good luck. Have a good day.”
It was a feeling built by the heat that flooded Harry’s veins whenever he touched Malfoy. But also the steady warmth that his presence had slowly grown to have, the comfort of having him near. It was watching Malfoy laugh, how his eyes would narrow and his cheeks would get flushed. But also watching him painted cold with sadness, remembering who he was in the past and grieving for those he had hurt. It was running through the snow together, pelting each other in competition. But also curling up together and listening as he pointed out the stars. It was casually bickering, and commiserating over classwork, and glances of smiles, and witty quips. All culminating in this undeniable feeling.
Malfoy wouldn’t meet his eyes. “It’s fine, Potter.”
“Oh. That’s . . . smart,” Harry said lamely. “You’ll have to teach me that one along with the tie trick.”
Harry’s pulse skipped a bit, still not used to Malfoy wanting to romance him. It was rather a nice feeling. “Well, alright then. But you’ll have to hurry. It starts in about ten minutes.”
“Ron, Hermione, look who’s here!” Potter said loudly, dragging his friends’ attention away from each other and onto their guests.
“Well, you would be, you’re a Slytherin! It would be quite unfortunate if you didn’t care for the House colours that you had to wear for most of the year. My last set of dress robes were green, and they were the ugliest ones at the Yule Ball, aside from Ron’s,” he explained to Madam Malkin, who nodded understandingly.
The Slytherins looked around with blatant fascination as they came out into the Gryffindor common room. It was so different from their own, all cushy furniture and worn carpets and cozy warmth and red and gold absolutely everywhere.
“So, I’ll see you in Charms,” Harry prompted, smiling up at Draco in a way that still made him wonder if someone else was standing behind him as the real recipient of Harry’s smile.
Malfoy gritted his teeth as he secured his seatbelt. “What is it, Potter?”
“Well, if I recall correctly, I believe Gryffindor won the last Quidditch match we both played,” Harry challenged, excitement growing at the thought of getting to best Malfoy again.
“Happy Christmas, Harry!”
“Not really, Draco,” Harry said through gritted teeth, arm muscles aching as he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. “I’m a Seeker. And you weigh a lot more than the Snitch!”
“What did you say, Potter?” The Slytherin repeated, stepping towards Harry, an indecipherable expression on his pale face.
Crabbe and Goyle hauled themselves up into the carriage, but Draco paused for a moment before handing Pansy up, gazing at his friend. She tipped her head, a slight smirk curving her reddened mouth.
Taking care to tread quietly so as not to wake any of his dormmates (Goyle was an unholy terror when woken up too early), Draco slid on his freshly pressed uniform, knotting his tie several times before he was happy with the final result.
Draco heaved a sigh, abandoning the Transfiguration textbook he had been trying to read. “Yes, Pansy, because I am not planning on going to it myself! So it would be a bit odd for Harry to attend a
“Oh, shut up!”
So when Malfoy abruptly slid into his chair at the dinner table just as Harry was finishing up his supper, with a pleased smile on his face, Harry barely looked up from the last dregs of his soup.
Draco was a surprisingly good sport about the whole thing. Sure, he couldn’t help a bit of grumbling when they were going out for the fourth night in a row, but for the most part, he patiently stood by Harry’s side, using the infamous Malfoy charm to try to brighten otherwise dreadfully dull small talk with various Ministry officials and prestigious wizarding families, of which Harry knew nothing of, causing him to cling desperately to Draco’s expertise. And he loved him all the more for it.
“Hey, Malfoy! Stop!”
“Got a little— mm, caught up,” Harry shot back, already breathless but figuring oxygen could wait.
“You obviously have a way with women,” Malfoy said drily.
Oh, the intrigue! What is Draco talking about? What is Harry going to mock him over? Tune in next week to find out! ;)
Still seething, Pansy allowed him to lead her into his dormitory, Crabbe and Goyle following close behind.
The middle-aged woman behind the table looked up at them with a bemused smile. “It actually doesn’t start for another five minutes.”
Draco inadvertently glanced towards Weasley, who shrugged. “I’ll allow it.”
“The fuck you’re dying on me, Potter,” Malfoy growled, Harry watching through slitted eyelids as he leaned forward, hair falling over his forehead, as Malfoy moved to put a hand on his forehead, although what good that would have done if he was actually unconscious, Harry didn’t know.
(See the end of the chapter for
But even the knowledge that the Gryffindor was simply playing a part didn’t stop Draco from getting a small buzz of satisfaction from hearing that he had flatly turned down the Creevey boy. Yes, providing an excuse for Harry’s admirers had been the plan all along, but that still didn’t change the fact that Draco’s traitorous heart seemed to beat a little faster at the news.
Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table to see the blond cursing while holding a slim hand to his head.
“You won’t ruin anything,” Harry told him, tracing comforting circles on the backs of his hands. “Sure, it might be a little awkward at first, but I’ll be right there beside you the whole time, alright?”
“Oh, um,” he stuttered. “Anything but green really.”
Harry shushed him, going slightly red as he looked around at the guests near them, hoping they hadn’t caught that last bit. Draco was now idly tracing lines along the back of Harry’s neck and Harry dragged him off to the side of the room before he could say anything else incriminating.
“Harry dear! So glad you could make it.”
“I really don’t mind,” Draco whispered to Harry as they headed out towards the backdoor. “If it takes getting rid of a few gnomes to help your family like me, I’m more than happy to.”
Malfoy fell silent, staring at Harry.
“It’s just Ron and Hermione. They so obviously have feelings for each other, yet they somehow don’t see it, so they’re wasting all this time bickering and beating around the bush when they could be together.”
He sort of wanted to take on the consequences of mistletoe again.
I absolutely love the carol 'Silent Night' and piano renditions of it are beautiful, so I highly encourage you all to look one up and listen to it. This is the one I was listening to while writing and it's gorgeous: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhC90ReY49I&list=LL&index=2
“What?!”
“Really?” Granger said, shutting her book suddenly, the pages slapping together with a heavy ‘thump’ that almost made Draco jump. “I thought that the bit on Edgar Bellington was quite fascinating.”
“Liar.” Potter’s eyes gleamed brightly as he stared determinedly at him. Draco hated how he noticed the flecks of gold woven through the vibrant green.
“Maybe you should go to bed,” she gently suggested, tugging the large textbook out of his hands.

Sighing inwardly, Draco summoned up some fresh resolve and tipped his chin up, gazing back coolly at the gawking onlookers with an air of utter boredom. He was just walking to dinner with his boyfriend. Nothing unusual to see at all.
Not quite sure exactly what he was answering, Harry nodded imperceptibly, shifting an inch closer, noting the flecks of snow crystals caught in Malfoy’s hair. Once again, Malfoy’s icy hands pressed against the small of Harry’s back as his eyes fluttered closed.
At the beginning of the drive, Harry kept snorting every few minutes, so Malfoy, to his great astonishment, instructed him to rummage in the glove compartment and put on a CD. The itch to comment tore mercilessly at Harry, but with one glare from Malfoy, he silently slipped in the first one he grabbed, once again shocked as Freddy Mercury’s voice began projecting through the vehicle.
Harry began laughing as Malfoy half sat up beside him, snow sticking to his hair.
“This person is obviously magical, but is the majority of the town Muggles?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual while his mind was already conjuring up images of a snow-covered village glowing in preparation for the holidays. But most importantly, a snow-covered village where he could walk down the street, enjoying the sight without being mobbed by reporters or well-wishers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you saying?” Harry felt excitement begin to spark in his stomach in spite of himself.
“Really . . .” Ron peered suspiciously towards Malfoy, who was watching this whole thing with a look of utter amusement, to Harry’s relief. He had been worried that Malfoy would get horribly offended by the whole encounter, but luckily, he seemed more entertained than insulted.
The elf crowed suddenly, waving his stack in the air. “O’Leary’s got thirty-eight! Woo-hoo!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will not! What an absurd idea,” Malfoy scoffed, shoving his hands deep into his coat pockets.
“No!” Harry cut him off quickly. “I want to come for the drive!”
Resigned to his fate, Harry leaned against the wall outside the classroom and took out his wand. Brow knotted in concentration, he tried to perform the rain charm Flitwick had taught them only minutes before. A small cloud popped into the air, but it stubbornly refused to procure water droplets, instead fading into a dark purple colour. He frowned at it, but the cloud only switched to pink.
“Actually, Aunt Andromeda, he’s correct,” Malfoy admitted reluctantly. “Through some twist of fate, Potter is staying here for a few weeks.”
“Well then,” Malfoy whispered, gaze flickering down to Harry’s mouth for a second, before looking back up, eyes questioning.
Finally, he came out of the forest, looking satisfied. “O’Leary has found his tree,” he announced proudly, leading them through the trees until they came to a stout fir that stood a bit taller than Malfoy. The needles were a glossy dark green and the branches were layered tightly, with no gaps at any spots.
Draco muttered something unintelligible, waving a hand with the intent of elegantly flipping her off in a fashion that only the truly aristocratic could manage, but his limbs felt too heavy from exhaustion to obey the thought. Instead, he sank back down onto the couch, certain that he belonged there far more than in the chaotic noise of the Great Hall.
Something that now glanced on a dull hum of anger in him.
“I would appreciate it if you didn’t speak of my boyfriend with such crudeness,” Draco said coolly, head pounding furiously as he prepared himself for the performance of a life time. To a house that was already suspicious by nature, the prospect of him dating Potter was going to be an even tougher sell than it had been for the rest of the school.
Draco raised an impeccable eyebrow. “What? Oh, this?” And he kissed Harry’s other temple, grinning slightly as he pulled back.
The elf nodded vigorously. “But of course!”
Unsure if it was meant to be a jab or an honest compliment, Harry simply nodding, sinking into his own chair and keeping his eyes fixed on the table in front of him, noting the swirls and scuffs in the wood.
Draco watched him in horror, a dark flush of embarrassment trailing up his face.
Harry had always known that Draco Malfoy was bad news. And although the definition of what made him bad news had changed over the years, the statement was still true. Only now, Draco Malfoy was bad news because Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of him. And soon someone was going to notice the Chosen One staring fixedly at the Slytherin table like he was in the middle of a Quidditch game and the sea of green and silver uniforms were hiding the Golden Snitch. And that was bad news. Front page of the Prophet bad news.
“What happened to your Gryffindor honour?” Malfoy asked slyly. “Have you given up on nobility so easily?”
Potter laughed softly, settling back against the couch and staring into the fire, the light reflecting off of his wide glasses. There was something so unguarded about his expression that Draco couldn’t help but look at him. To think that if Potter had never been a muddling idiot in the face of a preposition, then Draco never would have been here. In the Gryffindor common room, wearing the Boy Who Lived’s sweater, and wanting nothing more than to curl up with him. Not fight with him. Not make out with him. Just quietly be with him.
Draco waited until his friends’ carriage was out of sight, then started trudging back to the castle. He scuffed at the thick snow that covered the ground, the crystals stamped down and marked by a hundred footsteps. Not lain out in unmarred sheets like it had been the other night when he and Potter had been outside, flinging handfuls of the stuff at each other and then collapsing down and staring up at the stairs until past midnight. They had had to sneak back into the castle, nearly getting caught by Filch in the process. But for some reason, it had been worth it.
Harry flushed, hesitating before saying, “No one actually ever read me stories out loud when I was a kid.”
Inside was a small foyer, with a coat rack and a mat for shoes. After Harry grabbed out his wand and Hermine’s bottomless bag from his pocket, O’Leary took his coat and boots, setting them down before scuttling away into what Harry guessed was the living room, walls hidden by mahogany bookshelves and a great stone fire place roaring with warmth. There also was a grand piano standing in the corner, the firelight glancing off of its shiny veneer, stacks of what appeared to be sheet music piled on the bench.
“Sweet Salazar, Potter!” Draco groaned, casting a hasty ‘scourgify’ to sop up the spreading puddle.
“O’Leary wants to save the paper too,” the elf said.
Draco gnawed at his lip. “I don’t know . . . maybe I don’t much care about
After Harry had suggested the break-up, Draco had done his best to avoid him as much as possible for the remainder of the break. It hurt to even look at him, each sight of dark hair and green eyes only reminding Draco of how stupid he had been to even spend a second thinking that this farce could be anything more. Things couldn’t change that much. Harry might have tolerated him when it served his uses, but at the end of the day, he was still Draco Malfoy and no one was less likely to receive the Golden Boy’s affections than him. He was a fool for even entertaining such a thought.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’m going to take him up to the common room. Can you make our excuses to the other profs?”
Her face softened as she took him in, eyes flickering over the grouping at the table. “Hello, Harry. Sorry to bother you so late. I’m just here to retrieve my
“We should do it in the Great Hall at breakfast, so we have the largest audience possible like we did for the beginning of this,” Harry forced out, trying desperately to keep his tone casual.
Around him, the rest of his dormmates were just beginning to stir as the rays of the sun were starting to become visible through the murky lake water outside their dorm room window. It sent a faint glow over the other beds, contrasting oddly with the silver and green hangings.
Draco let out a short, exasperated breath, calming himself. Yelling at his friends would not change the fact that he had to go pretend to like Potter. He was the real idiot among them for agreeing to do such a thing. He still wasn’t quite sure why he had. It definitely wasn’t the prospect of a favour, although it was an added bonus. It made Draco feel very disconcerted that he didn’t know what had motivated his actions. He prided himself on being in control of himself. He wasn’t a Gryffindor thrill-seeker. He didn’t just do things for the hell of it. So why then had he entered into such an ill-favoured arrangement, without even a semblance of a discernable reason?
A car rattled past the street and Harry stepped out of the road onto the side walk. He was early for dinner but his friends wouldn’t mind him coming in out of the December cold.
“No, it’s fine,” Draco said, picking up a tome bound in tattered purple cloth and streaked with something that looked suspiciously like pumpkin juice. “I can use Hutchen’s version instead.”
Malfoy grinned slyly. “You bought me a Christmas present?”
“Fair point,” Draco conceded, sighing as he pulled himself up and walked over to the exit. “Let’s go.”
“Finally!” Draco said dramatically, standing up to take the package from Harry’s hands. “The suspense has been killing me!”
“Oh, sweet Salazar, Draco, you have a dorm room not twenty feet away!”
“Just bring Potter with you,” she suggested calmly, flicking a page over.
“Alright then!” Draco said, voice falsely cheery for some reason and head spinning slightly at the oddity of it all. “In we go!”
“Alright, first hand to Parkinson!”
And to his surprise, Draco found himself doing exactly that, as he slowly leaned over, resting his head against Potter’s shoulder, tucking in against his side. Potter let out a soft breath of surprise, but then curled his arm around Draco, gently interlacing their fingers, sending a muted warmth through Draco’s skin.
Draco enjoyed how quiet the library was later in the evening. Most students had already begun to make their way back to their common rooms to settle in for the night. This meant that he, Potter, Weasley, and Granger practically had the run of the place, save for Madam Pince and a few obligatory Ravenclaws that Draco suspected even slept among the stacks.
Seeing Harry’s still worried expression, Draco laced their fingers together under their desk. “I’ll be fine, love, really. Now at least pretend to be focusing on the lesson, or you’ll have us both losing points, which will only confirm my housemates’ suspicions that you’re only dating me so Gryffindor will win the house cup. Really, as if a Gryffindor could come up with a plan as Slytherin as that! A Ravenclaw, maybe, but I doubt they’d waste their intellect on something so trivial.” Draco shook his head, sniffing again as he turned back to his textbook.
“Understood.” Potter nodded quickly.
“Why are you acting so twitchy?” Pansy asked, eyeing Draco suspiciously as he nearly ran into Goyle’s back for the third time in the past minute.
Finally, the aisle cleared. Harry carefully set Malfoy back on his feet. The other boy muttered a reluctant “thank you”, before beginning to climb up towards the seats he had spotted. Insides churning uncomfortably from the leftover adrenaline of the moment, Harry followed.
Harry charmed together some strings of lumoses, while Malfoy transfigured an abandoned tea mug into a star for the top. O’Leary continued to create ornament charms, conjuring bulbs in green, silver, and gold, to go along with the red ones he had already placed.
“What?”
Draco stared at him blankly, smile fading. “What?”
“No, I will not hand you back your book!” Pansy said angrily, kicking the text away. “Draco, you’ve done nothing but study for weeks! You barely sleep; You pick at your food like it’s dirt and you hardly speak to me anymore! And it’s all fucking Potter’s fault and don’t try to tell me it isn’t, because that’s a lie and you and I both know that! I—”
“Yes, Potter, it’s a term often used to refer to a man whom one is dating,” Malfoy smirked, but Harry could see the cautious question in his eyes.
“Look, Malfoy, it’s not a big deal,” Harry said tiredly, leaning against one of the desks. “It’s in the past.”
"Character A tries to convince Character B that they *are* Santa Claus."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “A lucky shot is one of the reasons Brazil won the International Cup last year, so I wouldn’t sound quite so scornful about it.”
“Don’t be such a tease, Mal- um,
“Keeping me hostage?” Now Harry was even more confused.
“We never said that,” Harry argued, biting back another shiver, not wanting to see Malfoy’s smirk of satisfaction. “It was definitely quarter to two.”
“Gladly,” Harry said fervently, snatching another kiss from his mouth, and taking his hand. “Merlin, you’re freezing! Let’s get you inside. We can get back to this when I’m not worried about you getting hypothermia.”
“How dare you—” Draco began, but Potter interrupted him.
“No buts! You have to go talk to Potter!”
Draco looked over at him. “Why don’t you live with them? They clearly think of you as a son and I’m sure would be more than happy to take you in. You could leave the bustle of London and come enjoy the peaceful anonymity.”
He swallowed, unclenching his fists from where they had tightened at his sides. “I’m sorry. I just . . . it’s a lot. Not being able to go anywhere without people screaming and following me. I’m too afraid to apply for a job anywhere because I’ll never know whether I got it because they thought I was qualified or because I killed a guy without a nose. My entire life is picked apart on the front page every single day, which means I’m too afraid to date anyone because I don’t want to drag them into it. So I’d appreciate it if you didn’t get after me about this one thing. Not when I came out here to escape thinking about it.”
As always, kudos and/or comments are appreciated as much as biodegradable straws!
“I guess I just never really thought of you as the outdoors type,” Harry admitted, taking a moment to transfigure his boots into skates the way Hermione had taught him and Ron to do when they had gone skating on the Great Lake at Hogwarts.
Harry nodded, unsure how to respond. “Did you get a chance to play?”
Harry sighed. “Let’s just say that Gryffindor bravery is not a 24/7 thing.”
The End
“I mean it!” Ron got to his feet, still quite unsteady from the stunning spell, but brandishing his wand determinedly. “I won’t let you keep Harry hostage any longer!”
“Ronald Bilius Weasley, where the fuck are you?”
“Harry! I thought I heard you. You’re early,” Hermione said happily, coming into the room and sitting beside Harry, leaning over to hug him.
Wincing inside at the thought of more potions’ work, Harry managed a smile of gratitude before hurrying back to Draco, who had somehow commandeered both Hermione and Ron’s cloaks as well to try to combat his shivering. Harry’s friends were seated on either side of Draco, propping him up in his own chair.
“But I’m fine. Malfoy’s fine. I’m fine with Malfoy,” Harry reiterated, placing a hand on his friend’s arm. “We’ve moved past everything in our history and are just living in the present.”
“Rematch to decide second?” Malfoy suggested in a casually deceptive tone, hand already reaching towards his wand.
“These are very nice,” Harry remarked, taking out a white and navy striped hat.
But what Draco had not counted on was how soft Potter’s mouth was. How perfectly it slotted against his own. How his hand automatically reached up to tangle in the back of Potter’s disastrous hair. And most of all, how Potter didn’t immediately jerk back. Quite the opposite in fact, as Potter seemed to lean in as much as Draco was, fisting Draco’s shirt with his free hand and almost humming against his mouth with something that would have been mistaken by anyone else for contentment.
I hoped you enjoyed getting to see these two poor awkward boys try to figure out what flirting looks like! Kudos and comments are always a day-maker. ;)
Still grinning, Harry turned back to walk out of the kitchen, just in time to see Draco slip out of the back door, coat slung over his arm.
“Sometimes,” Harry echoed, staring into the depths of his tea cup.
“You’ll be fine, mate,” Harry said encouragingly, swallowing the last bit of his toast and brushing the crumbs off of his crimson sheets.
This meant that when Ron brought up Quidditch practice at the dinner table, and was jovially talking about how excited he was to get back into intensive practice in preparation for their upcoming match, Harry had to try to dredge up some semblance of enthusiasm to match his best friend, even though he felt as though he’d rather listen to Binns talk about the goblin revolutions for a full day over thinking about the Quidditch pitch where he and Draco had run around in the snow and stargazed.
“Good, good. Glad to hear it,” Colin said quietly, almost to himself more than to Harry. He was acting even more strange than usual.
Realizing that he was the one who was going to have to keep the act going, Draco adopted his most polite conversational tone, the one he typically saved for exceptionally painful dinners at the Manor where he was expected to charm stuffy old pureblood matriarchs and dull second cousins. “So, how was your day, love?”
And, house’s owner aside, there was no better place to find it than 9544 Magnolia. Harry spent the morning reading on one of the overstuffed sofas in the living room, unable to remember the last time he had sat down and read a book simply for pleasure.
“Could have used that to get it here in the first place,” he pointed out, just as he did every year.
Reaching for some of the Muggle money he had stashed in his pocket, he made his way towards a stall selling hot drinks and pastries, falling into the back of the short line in front of it. He was on vacation for Merlin’s sake, and Hermione and Mrs. Weasley weren’t around to stop him, so he was going to have dessert first if he bloody felt like it.
“What? You thought what, Potter?” Malfoy demanded, leaning over the counter towards him. “You thought that we’d be fine, while you just got to waltz off to enjoy the rest of your life without worrying about whether you could make enough to survive in a world where no one would hire you because you picked the losing side.”
Grumbling unintelligibly, Draco pulled off two of the four heavy sets of robes he was wearing, dropping them unceremoniously on the floor.
He was halfway to the Charms classroom when he realized he didn’t have any of his books, and a mad dash to the Gryffindor dormitories ensued. Satchel securely tucked in his arms, he ran back to class, muscles burning and breath pounding as he slid irritably into his seat beside Ron.
He was in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Mmhmm,” Draco said skeptically, smiling at the Gryffindor’s retreating back. Honestly, Potter could not lie to save his life. It was almost extraordinary how bad he was at it.
“What?” Harry asked, mind still focused on what had just happened, heart racing in time.
“Okay, that part is not my fault!” Malfoy insisted loudly, pointing accusingly at the car as if it were to blame. “I ordered a black one but the dealership got it mixed up and by that point, Father and Mother were already getting suspicious over my first disappearance from Diagon Alley during school shopping, and so I didn’t dare sneak away to find one of those Muggle fellytones and so I ended up with a yellow car!”
“Honestly, I’m a Slytherin, not an idiot!” Malfoy scoffed, leaning forward to rest his arms on his knees. “I’ve seen how you two look at each when you think the other won’t notice. In case you’ve forgotten, I’ve eaten at least one meal a day with you for the past couple weeks and during that time, I’ve had to watch you stare at each other like you’re Christmas dinner and a rare manuscript respectively!”
“Relax, Malfoy! Try to have fun,” Harry coaxed, spreading some of the icing onto the corners of the gingerbread.
“Five cards!”
“Just a half hour ago,” she said, slipping her arm through her fiance’s.
Ron offered a gentlemanly arm and Hermione took it and Harry trailed behind them as they slowly made their way down through the castle to the front doors, murmuring so quietly to each other that their words were unintelligible, something that Harry was rather grateful for. Just because he wanted his friends to be happy together didn’t mean that he wanted to be directly privy to all of that happiness.
“Anyway, I was wondering if you’d be interested in doing that sometime!” Susan said brightly.
Harry joined the rest of the contestants in cheering, while Malfoy peered suspiciously at their ‘competition’.
“So then why pretend any differently? The money’s already payed in full, although I don’t even see why you of all people would need it in the first place—”
Malfoy’s face twitched, as though he very much wanted to sneer at Harry and then storm off. But instead he took Harry’s arm and pulled him towards the Slytherin table.
Tiptoeing through the living room that he had caught a glimpse of the day before, Harry found himself in a large, but cozy kitchen. However, it was not as empty as he had expected.
Draco gritted his teeth, pacing closer to her chair so that the entire bustling common room didn’t hear his next words. “But that means that I can’t go off and go to, ahem, you know.”
“Oh Merlin.”
“Hmph.” Draco sniffed as he awkwardly shuffled in between Potter and Granger, who did not spare another glance up from her reading material to acknowledge his presence.
“I love it,” he said, reaching over and squeezing Malfoy’s hand as he stared down at the house.
“Oh. Right, sorry, of course,” Harry said, stepping further back and shoving his hands in his jean’s pockets, blushing. “Go ahead, please.”
The house elf grinned, blushing slightly from the praise. “It’s Mr. Malfoy’s favourite: apple pie.”
Draco stepped up to the door, eyes trailing over the ornate carvings etched across the age-darkened wood. “Coming, Potter?”
“Good to see you too, Pans,” he grumbled, smoothing his shirt from where her embrace had crumpled it.
“He leans,” Malfoy remarked casually.
“That’s nice,” Malfoy offered, seemingly sincere. “That you have some place to go for dinner. It’ll just be me and O’Leary for ours. He always goes a bit over the top with the food and we end up eating the leftovers for over a week after, but it’s delicious, so I don’t really mind.”
“What the bloody fuck?”
“Do it?” He suggested innocently, barely dodging the not-so gentle punch Pansy aimed at his arm. “I’m only joshing, Pans. You know I’ll carry your bag for you any day.”
“Harry’s had another run-in,” Ron said knowingly, sitting on Harry’s other side. “And it messed up his first snow.”
“Morning, Potter,” he said pleasantly, crossing behind one of the couches towards the dining room.
Malfoy stared at the present for a moment, before taking it, carefully pulling off the paper and tape to reveal a shiny plastic case.
“Was the soup to Mr. Porter’s liking?” He asked hopefully.
“Do you wipe the floor with Weasley and his friends?” A slight smirk was on Malfoy’s face, but it wasn’t vindictive, instead closer to knowing, as if he and Harry were in on a joke. Which, Harry supposed, they were.
“The first snow was bloody ruined for me!” He shouted, kicking off his shoes and coming into the cozy living room. Ron looked up in surprise from a chess board.
As soon as the door opened, one of them shouted, “One, two, three!” and they broke into an up-tempo version of ‘Silent Night’, rushing through some of the verses in their excitement.
Every inch of visible pale skin that Harry glanced out of the corner of his eye made it harder to get through this, so he gripped the pillows with renewed fury, plumping them so harshly it was like he was beating a Bludger.
O’Leary smiled eagerly, while Draco nodded more hesitantly, worry darkening his eyes.
“How did you . . . what . . . I mean . . .” Harry sputtered, staring across at Malfoy in awe.
“The fuck?” He spat, sitting up and glancing over to see what had hit him. If he didn’t know better, he would have thought a rogue Bludger had been let loose in the dining hall as some sort of practical joke; Potter getting back at him for accidentally saving Draco’s life yesterday. Wanted to remedy what damage he’d unintentionally not done.
The admittance shook him. Merlin, what was he going to do?! Just sit around and continue to pretend to date him and have stolen make-out sessions when no one was looking, all while being in love with him? Eventually the other boy would realize something was up when the supposed-to-be fraudulent relationship kept dragging on.
“Thank you all for coming to Christmas,” he said, smiling widely at the people seated around him. “I would just like to announce that there is something I’ve been keeping from you all these years. I’m really Father Christmas.”
“Well, we could try a Muggle game,” Hermione ventured.
“Hullo to you too, love, no need to be so rough,” Malfoy drawled, smirking and settling his robes around him primly. “Pass the coffee?”
Harry laughed. “That’s very pot-kettle from someone who faked an injury for months just because a big bird scared them.”
“Y-yeah, okay,” Harry stammered, certainly that he was blushing as red as his old Gryffindor tie. “I will.”
Once they reached the row, Malfoy simply pushed his way past the already seated students, knocking into protruding arms and knees unforgivingly. Harry whispered frantic apologies as he trailed in the Slytherin’s wake, face flushing with embarrassment.
Draco’s cold seemed to get progressively worse with each class. At first it was only infrequent sniffing and small bouts of coughing, but eventually Draco couldn’t speak without sounding as though he was hacking his lunges up and he was shivering so hard that Harry had forced him to wear his cloak on top of his own.
Malfoy paused, examining him for a moment, before sitting back down again. “That’s kind of you.”
“I’m pretty sure you’ve never mentioned anything of the sort to me,” Harry said, racking his memory of the past week. “And even if you had, it hasn’t gone out. It’s smouldering, the way it’s supposed to.”
“Well,” Ron said slowly, the rest of his face going redder with every second that passed. “After you left, we sort of just sat there awkwardly for a moment and then Hermione – being how she is – decided that we should talk about it and I ended up blurting out an invitation to Hogsmeade?” Ron sounded as though he was still unsure that the incident had even occurred.
“O’Leary knows that Mr. Malfoy is a very capable wizard,” the elf said sagely. “O’Leary is sure that he will turn up when he is ready.”
“Excuse me?” Hermione squeaked.
I’ve drafted novels before, but this was the first multi-chap fic that I’ve ever done and I have had so much fun writing it! I hope you all have enjoyed the journey as much as I have, because it’s really thanks to all of you for keeping me going! Thank you all so much for every comment, every kudo! I loved getting to see your reactions to these characters and this story and your predictions and hopes and everything! It’s been amazing, so thank you all so much for your support! It’s been an absolute pleasure getting to meet you all!
“Nice miss, Malfoy,” Potter gloated, not noticing his trapped neck-wrap and stepping towards the bleachers, only to be tugged back. “Clever,” he admitted, yanking off his scarf and abandoning it on the pitch, like a woolly snake.
“How did You-Know-Who smell?”
At least the press had settled down somewhat by this point. When they had first been spotted holding hands at a Puddlemere United match, all the papers had a field day with headings about the Chosen One allowing a Malfoy to Slytherin-to his bed. But once everyone had come to terms with the fact that Draco had no intention of going anywhere except wherever Harry went, the wizarding world had begrudgingly gotten used to seeing the two young men arm and arm on the cover of the Daily Prophet.
(See the end of the chapter for
free time with him!” Ron complained, stopping in front of the doors to the Great Hall.
A faint cough pulled his gaze up from his untidy scrawl and he saw that the girl was still standing there, eyes fixated on his face.
Draco scowled at her. “Even if there was something, it would be none of your business.”
His stomach settled and he summoned a smile. “I assure you, Pansy, it’s nothing of the kind.”
“Yes, but that didn’t happen,” Harry said firmly, slowly walking towards Malfoy until he could place a hand on the other boy’s shoulder.
Draco came to a stop, barely suppressing the sneer that automatically began to slide over his face whenever he looked at Potter.
They began walking aimlessly down the sidewalk, neither one really going anywhere, each of them wrapped up in their own thoughts.
Harry stared out through the window over the sink, surprised to realize he was unconsciously smiling. Just at the thought of going back into a room of people. People who knew and loved him for who he was, not what he had done. People who had become his family. And a man who had been his enemy and was now so much more he was afraid to think too long on it.
Turning around a corner, Harry huddled by the wall to check the Map again. Almost there.
“Why are we like this?” Harry gasped, still shaking. “We fight and struggle and mess things up so fucking badly and oh Merlin, I love you!”
Wow, twenty days gone and only four chapters left! That's crazy. It honestly feels like it hasn't been a week, so that's scary as fuck.
“So,” Pansy Parkinson said, leaning across the table towards Harry, a dark gleam in her eyes. “What are your intentions towards our Draco?”
Harry couldn’t stop himself from laughing at the sight of Malfoy scowling up at the tree. “It’s a sign,” he said when he could catch his breath. “You really should get a Christmas tree.”
Harry smiled, enjoying how well known his friend’s penchant for books was. “I imagine it will.”
“So glad we got to talk,” Draco said smoothly, nodding politely as he steered Harry away quick enough that he got out of having to shake the man’s hand himself. “Oh, thank Merlin, love, good save back there.”
“‘Boyfriend’?” Harry repeated uncertainly, wondering if he had heard him correctly.
“You are the worst boyfriend!”
Ron wasn’t the only one who was having trouble getting used to it all.
Swallowing hard, Harry tore his eyes away as Ron set his presents on the floor, pausing before he sat down to give Hermione a sweet Christmas kiss, the two of them beaming at each other like they were the only ones in the room until Ginny couldn’t stand it any more and announced that the present opening should begin.
A fresh breeze gusted across the stands and Harry shivered, the cold reminiscent of the Slytherin dungeon. His hands were slowly reddening to match his tie.
“Wonderful, thank you so much.” Malfoy shook her hand again.
Malfoy begrudgingly continued his icing design, cringing when Harry began heaping bright red candy cane shavings on top of it, but slowly relaxing as he went along, even throwing on a handful of sprinkles himself, although Harry noticed that he immediately covered up the evidence with a tasteful icing snowflake.
“No, the barn was too good for me, so I just got the cupboard instead,” Harry snapped back, annoyed by Malfoy’s condescension and that fact that even when he was being a complete git, Harry still wanted to run his hands through his obnoxiously perfect hair.
“Charmed,” she said, smiling wide as a shark at the Gryffindors, crossing her legs daintily beneath the table.
“Yes?” Potter said, casually leaning against Draco’s shoulder, the action so sudden that Draco nearly fell off the back of his seat.
“Damn it,” he said, frustrated. He stormed up the steps, half knocking on the red door before pushing inside.
More than anything, Draco wanted to be angry.
“Well, no matter now,” Malfoy sighed dramatically. “My boyfriend and I would like to sign up to compete.”
It had all been the perfect lead-up to the main day, and when Harry opened his eyes on Christmas morning, outside it was white and sparkling, just as perfect as the rest of the holidays had been so far.
Pansy stood up, dragging him to his feet determinedly. “Until you hear from Potter himself that he is definitely, one hundred percent not interested, then I won’t stand for you moping around like someone smashed your car! It is not befitting of a Malfoy, and it is not befitting of a Slytherin!”
“Aww, ta, Draco!”
gravity, Potter. Merlin, fame really does make people stupider.”
The house elf sighed dramatically as he saw the mess of dough on the counter, immediately setting them to work rerolling it, placing Harry in charge of getting the cookies on the pan.
“This is amazing,” he told Malfoy, who simply smirked, the expression still the same despite the different face.
Potter faltered, before smartly giving up on any more pretensive small talk. Instead, he got out a battered quill and a stained inkwell, setting them beside his textbook.
“I’m in awe,” Harry said finally, shaking his head in bewilderment. He had been pushing and coaxing his blushing friends towards each other since the beginning of the term and one pointed conversation with Draco Malfoy and they were going on a date.
He could hear Malfoy close behind him, the other boy finally catching up and tackling him to the ground.
“Have a good evening!” He called after them, before shutting the door.
Ron swore as his halted a few feet before Draco’s, passing over the coins. “Lucky first shot, Malfoy.”
Every few minutes, Malfoy’s gaze would flit up from whatever he and Madam Malkin were studying to fixate on Harry. A faint smile would curl the corners of his mouth and something indecipherable would flash in his eyes before he turned back to the seamstress, nodding along with whatever she was saying. The first few times this had happened, Harry tried to pretend as though he hadn’t been looking at the other boy in the first place, but eventually his blush was so pronounced that he couldn’t deny it. So he would meet Malfoy’s eyes, examining their gray depths, searching for . . . something. But what it was, he wasn’t quite sure.
I’m an author! I am contractually obligated to torture my characters at some point.
❤️❤️❤️
“I had to run all over the bloody castle to find you,” Draco snapped, shivering in only his school robes. Harry hated that he noticed.
Harry groaned. “Why didn’t you suggest that then, instead of letting me struggle up all those flights?”
Damn mornings.
The kitchen was almost completely silent, aside from the sizzling of the pan as Malfoy began to whisk the eggs. The coffee was bitter and rich in Harry’s mouth.
Despite the Gryffindors apparent commitment to being the house of the noisy instead of the bold, they fell silent as soon as Professor Snape swooped into the classroom, long back robes trailing behind him. Draco envied his ability to command the room so easily, although whether it came from respect or fear, even he couldn’t testify.
“Oh, so it’s a Muggle thing!” Malfoy nodded in sudden understanding. “Wizard children know that Father Christmas is far too busy with his magical ritual preparation to do something so mundane as respond to letters.”
“And she said yes, right?” Harry prodded, grinning wildly as he looked at his best mate, whose face was flaming more scarlet than his hair.
“We should take you back to the castle or you’re going to freeze,” Harry said slowly, tearing his gaze away from Malfoy’s.
“By Malfoy!” Ron groaned dramatically, flinging an arm over his face and holding onto one of the hallway’s walls for support.
He sighed, reaching for it. “Pansy, we’ve been over this, I’m fine.”
“Ron, Malfoy kissed me!”
Malfoy looped his arm through his again, grinning. “I think I’m starting to like these Muggle conventions.”
It was too much.
“Anytime today, Malfoy.” Weasley faked a yawn.
Even Draco had gotten mostly used to it by now. He and Potter had fallen into an uneasy routine. They alternated meals at each other’s tables, making an ungodly amount of effort with each other’s friends during it, as Draco didn’t think it would be seemly for him to get into a fist fight with his apparent boyfriend’s best mate, much as he kept being tempted to by the russet-haired tosser. They walked together to any joint Slytherin-Gryffindor classes, pairing up whenever possible for assignments. In the evenings, they would study at one of the most central tables in the library and then walk back together as far as they could before they had to split to their various dorms. They casually held hands, called each other by their first names the majority of the time, spoke mostly civilized words whenever they had to talk to each other, and played off any fights they couldn’t hold in as lovers’ spats.
The man’s face came into focus, a furious scowl etched across his brow. A familiar scowl, even through his blurry vision.
“Oh.” Harry definitely hadn’t been expecting that. “I see.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but with surprisingly little exasperation. “I cast warming charms before we left. When you live in the dungeons, it’s an everyday necessity.”
“Serious, not helping.”
Draco scrapped as much snow as he could off of the benches, but his amount was meager compared to the armful that Potter gathered. Deciding to cut his losses, Draco nimbly hopped down, dodging past Potter and sprinting out into the middle of the pitch, the other boy close on his heels and pelting him with sloppy handfuls.
At the end of class, he was still so inter-focused that he stepped right through the cloud of cinnamon that had puffed up from the vial that Neville had dropped into shatters on the ground.
The front walkway that led up to the door was half cleared, the shovel used to do the job abandoned by the doorstep. Harry began to make his way towards the house, trudging through the snow covering the first portion of the walkway, glad to shake it off of his boots when he reached the bare stone.
Draco scowled at his textbook. He had spent the last ten minutes reading the same paragraph over and over and still couldn’t repeat the information if his life depended on it. Potter was dramatically late for their nightly library study sessions and it was disconcerting.
As always, kudos and/or comments bring me as much happiness as fried cauliflower.
But Draco wasn’t angry. He wasn’t anything. Just empty. Exhausted, like every drop of life had been wrung out of him, leaving beating pulses of pain behind where it used to be.
Malfoy stood up, expression blank. “You’re up early.”
“How about some carols while we wait?” Harry suggesting, pushing Malfoy towards the piano before he and the elf could get into it again.
As always, comments and kudos brighten days and my smile! <3
“What is going on with you?” He hissed, eyeing the swarm of ministry guests nervously. It would just be his luck that Draco had decided he needed an audience for some sort of mental breakdown. He did have an undeniable flair for dramatics. Oh, Merlin, The Daily Prophet would never let either of them live it down.
Pansy dashed butterfly kisses on either side of his face, returning to rites of farewell that were more customarily Pureblood. “You won’t really miss me though,” she said, soft smile suddenly turning wicked to match her twinkling eyes. “Because I know that you’re really just staying back so you can spend more time with your boyfriend.”
Harry barely glanced at the room, setting down the bottomless back on the top of a chest of drawers. “Looks good.”
Immediately, Ron’s face flushed as he nodded back. “Absolutely, ‘Mione.”
“What?” Harry asked, voice loud with surprise. Nearby students hushed him, including Hermione, who was seated three rows in front of them, separated because she had wanted to be closer to the front of the class than Harry and Ron were comfortable with. He mouthed his apologies at them, before turning back to Ron. “What do you mean?”
Harry turned to see Snape walking slowly towards him, a soft, malicious smile on his face. If he didn’t know better, Harry would have described the look in Snape’s black eyes as ‘glee’, but such a word was far too chipper for the moody potions master.
“Elegant as always, Potter,” Malfoy noted drily, but Harry could have sworn that a smile flickered behind his coffee cup.
“It’s alright, Hermione,” Harry said. “He’s right. I can’t just waltz through the busiest wizard street in England. Merlin, it would have been nice though. To just slip through, unnoticed, and be able to enjoy the beginning of the holidays.”
“What are you doing here?”
Draco gaped at her. “Really? You never mentioned this to me!”
Kudos and/or comments seriously just mean so much, so thank you to everyone who has brightened my day with them! Y'all are amazing. <3
“Alright, now Ron, first and foremost, I’m not in any kind of danger,” Harry said soothingly. “It turns out that Malfoy happened to own the house I was staying at during my vacation. No nefarious plan. Just simple coincidence.”
Harry could feel his face warming. “Er, well, I just came across something when I was in town the other day. I wasn’t even sure if I was going to give it to you, but I saw it and there it was, and I couldn’t stop thinking about you, so I got it, but now, well.” Harry gestured helplessly between the two of them, face completely on fire now.
“Oh, Godric, I’d forgotten about those,” Harry groaned, putting his face in his hands. “I’m sure the Ministry will be sending me a list of events any day now.” Dinners and parties where Harry would be expected to put on a nice pair of robes, smile, not drink too much, and say a short, sickeningly pleasant speech about all the fine work the Ministry had done in the past year to help the poor and the rich and the sick and the healthy. Where he would be expected to smile benevolently and say everything was going to be alright, when he barely knew if he was alright.
Luckily for him, Weasley looked even more confused than he was and Draco was sure that with his natural intelligence and Slytherin cunning he could at least best the ginger Gryffindor.
“I’m so sorry about that,” Harry said as soon as his head stopped ringing. “The Weasleys are like family to me, so they’re just really protective.
“Oh, believe me, I know.”
was when he was with Harry. Not heir to the Malfoy name. Not a lackey of pureblood ideals. Not a sneering schoolboy.
Harry grinned at him. “Have you ever considered that it might be your fault for being so obnoxiously good-looking?”
Soon they were appropriately armored against the cold, Harry’s hair slipping out statically from under Malfoy’s toque, causing the Slytherin to wrinkle his nose and mutter that
have to be nervous about anyhow. You’re not the one about to go to another house’s party where the majority of the attendants would gladly push you through the window into the lake for the giant squid to devour!”
"No offense, but I would not trust you to carve the turkey."
“Are you trying to get us caught, Potter?” Malfoy huffed, stooping in front of a door with chipped purple paint and drawing out his wand, muttering a soft ‘alohomora’. He gently twisted the handle and the door swung open, letting a wave of warmth out into the blustering alleyway.
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively. “Brilliant. Carry on then if you like, although I just came in to tell you that O’Leary and I were going to head outside to find a tree and you are welcome to come with us if you like.”
Harry looked up so quickly from his breakfast bowl that he felt his neck begin to ache. The meal had been strangely silent so far, the two of them sneaking glances at each other when they thought the other wasn’t looking. He was desperate for some break in the tension. “Yes?”
“Shh!”
“Alright,” Draco said slowly. “Fine then. I’ll ask Harry at breakfast.”
“Yes, yes I am,” Harry agreed hurriedly, all but running over to the stairs to his and Ron’s dorm. “Not sure how long it will take, so don’t wait up.”
“Thanks, Potter.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but as he turned away, Harry saw a faint smile reflected in a passing store window.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so relaxed on Christmas day. After opening presents in Gryffindor tower, he and the other Gryffindors had spent the morning messing around in the crisp snow outside, working up an appetite for the Christmas feast. The meal did not disappoint, with all manner of delicious treats appearing on the table. Potter even persuaded him to try a bite of that treacle tart that he swore by and, to Draco’s surprise, it wasn’t half bad. Although it could perhaps simply be that he had grown accustomed to tasting its sweetness on Potter’s lips.
Harry straightened, reaching for Malfoy, but he wrenched away, pacing across the floor.
Cold wind rippled through Harry’s cloak as he dully flew in circles above the Quidditch pitch. He’d been out there for over an hour, aimlessly flying around on his broom, feeling sick every time he looked up at the star-speckled night sky that would forever remind him of Draco.
“But you would have been a lot less comfortable,” Potter pointed out, nudging him.
“Definitely.” She leaned in to hug him, whispering in his ear, “And do be careful with Draco. He’s doing really well now, but he’s still fragile.” She looked at him meaningfully as she pulled back.
“Same to you, Mr. Prewitt,” he said with as much sincerity as he could, while simultaneously trying to discreetly wipe off the sheen of sweat that had been transferred from the other man’s palm.
“What?” Harry gaped at her, unsure of how they had gone from an offer to talk to a proclamation of love within the span of a minute.
“Excuse me, Harry Potter?”
The stretch of wall that was the Slytherin entrance slid open and he looked up hopefully, only to see a small first-year student scramble out, robes flapping. When he caught sight of Harry, his eyes widened and he stuttered to a stop.
“I know. I just fell asleep quite early last night and didn’t get a chance to have supper, so I thought I’d make myself some breakfast. I’d hoped not to wake anyone up but . . .” Harry gestured vaguely towards Malfoy.
And around they went again, Draco getting a tad less muddled every time.
Impossibly contented, Harry leaned back, enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s hand in his and the controlled roar of the other diners around them. Under the customers’ noise, the faint sound of radio could be heard, the announcer saying brightly “And now for our Muggle Christmas special, ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’, by someone named Mariah Carey, sure to be an educational experience!”
Harry elbowed him in the ribs. “If you always order as antagonistically as you did when I ran into you, I’m amazed you’re not blacklisted from coming here.”
“I’m fine!” He snapped, shaking her off, even more furious with himself. “I-I’ll be fine. Thank you,” he added more softly, seeing the hurt expression in his friend’s eyes.
He dragged Harry into the quiet foyer of the shop, which smelled faintly of lemons and cinnamon.
“You will have one hour to make the best gingerbread house that you can! And your time starts now!”
His platinum hair . . .
“The best Christmas present of all,” Harry quipped.
“Why on earth would you have tea herbs stuck on a counter?” Malfoy snapped, hands gesticulating furiously.
“I’ll see you in class,” he said softly, touching Draco’s hand as he quickly moved past him, walking down a corridor as calmly as he could, given the thundering heartbeat in his chest.
“S’alright, Neville,” Harry assured distractedly, pausing beside the other Gryffindor’s cauldron, which was smoking purple and orange. Something familiar was there . . . he almost had it . . . Malfoy was different . . . and . . .
“You’re not supposed to let it go out!” Malfoy said exasperatedly, crouching down beside the glimmering coals. “Sweet Salazar, Potter, we’ve talked about this!”
I really enjoyed reading all of your guesses as to what Draco’s secret was and I hope that it did not disappoint, although I for one think that some of your guesses were better than my planned one!
“There is no ‘this’!” Draco spat.
I'll have you know that when I first came up with the idea for this fic, it was NOT supposed to include TWO common tropes as large plot points, yet here I am, writing a fake/relationship, friends (really enemies but there's sadly no tag) with partial benefits fic. I do promise to balance out the surprising amount of tropiness with more original stuff, but who am I kidding? If you clicked on this fic, it was probably FOR the tropiness! Let me know in the comments so I can be a little more assured that I am not an entirely crazy and self-indulgent fangirl!
“Welcome to the madness, Malfoy,” George said, appearing suddenly beside Ron. “Harry should have told you to run while you still had a chance.”
Draco noted his anxiety, filing it away to be examined at a later time. Apparently Gryffindors were just as bad at lying as he’d always heard.
Pain already starting to tear at him every moment he looked at Draco, Harry turned away in the guise of putting the common room back to rights after the joyful carelessness of Christmas day. That enviable, oblivious carelessness before he had realized he was in love with him and fucked everything up. When he could look at him and not feel dizzy from the hurt.
“Wonderful!” O’Leary beamed. “Dinner will be ready in ten minutes.”
Malfoy snorted. “If I’m not allowed to fake politeness, you’re not allowed to lie, Potter. It’s not an attractive look on you.” And with that, he strode out of the kitchen, leaving Harry to stare at a burning pan of scrambled eggs.
Weasley coughed, staring at his feet as he replied in a strangled tone that he apparently thought sounded natural. “Yeah, I wonder where he got off to. Bit unfair of him, considering he knows that Snape will take it out on Gryffindor. I wouldn’t be surprised if he used this as an excuse to deduct all the points we won from the last Quidditch match.”
“What’s a stage-na—”
“Whoops!” Draco said carelessly, examining the champagne flute he had been holding moments before, now forming a puddle of golden liquor spattered with shards of glass. “My bad.” He neatly stepped over the mess, slipping his arms around Harry’s waist. “Sorry, where were we?”
Prompt #18
“I dunno, Harry,” Ron shrugged helplessly. “Well, how did it come about? The, err, kiss?”
Today was no different.
“I’m completely sure,” Harry said, brushing a soft kiss on his mouth. “I want you there with me.”
Tonight was no different. They had Flooed into the Ministry and immediately had been dragged over to do a photo-op with Minister Shacklebolt, pasting on their practiced smiles for the press. Then they had spent the next several hours making the rounds, champagne flutes in hand while they made sure to thank everyone for coming out to donate to such a worthy cause, although at this point, Harry honestly had no idea which charity was sponsoring which night. It was all one blur of sleek dress robes and polite smiles.
Harry groaned, rolling his eyes. “It’s not that big of a deal,
Malfoy glanced over at him, flushing. “No,” he insisted stubbornly. “I was trying to prevent the Chosen One from dying in my yard and therefore avoid getting sent to Azkaban for murder.”
Malfoy returned with the cocoa, and continued to make an effort to be, if not actually pleasant, at least not openly hostile, making only one or two snide remarks each time after which Harry kicked him pointedly under the table. Slowly Ron and Hermione began to talk more freely and soon they were all chatting about Christmas memories from Hogwarts and the heavy amount of snow Britain was getting this year and the new breed of letter-carrying owl taking the wizarding world by storm, but was actually no better than a regular mail owl. Malfoy’s charm was making a rare appearance and Harry watched as his friends became more at ease with the Slytherin.
“Yes, that is a very real possibility,” Harry said gravely. “But it will be okay. You’ll survive.”
“What?”
“Everyone ready to head out?” Harry asked, stepping over towards the Floo.
“O’Leary is going to get more ingredients,” the house elf growled. “Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Porter will roll out the dough we have. Do not touch anything.” And with that final warning, the elf disappeared.
“Merlin, it’s really coming down out there! O’Leary, could you put on some tea?”
“You just said you’re not going to bring Potter to the party tomorrow!” She raised one perfectly groomed eyebrow.
“Are you seeing anyone, Mr. Potter?”
Pansy glowed triumphantly, leaping out of her chair to press a kiss to his cheek. “Great! Thank you for trying, I promise, you will not regret this!”
Malfoy looked at him skeptically, fear still very much present in his eyes.
She looked at him expectantly, and, for the first time in weeks, Draco finally felt some warmth creep through his veins, igniting something inside of him. He was sick of feeling this way; going through his days numbly because it hurt too much to feel. Pansy was right. He had to go talk to Harry and tell him how he felt. And at least if he clearly rejected him, then he’d know, and wouldn’t be sitting around wondering about the what-if of it all. He could be angry again.
“Sorry, what was that?” Harry asked innocently.
The sun was lowering close to the intersection of the horizon when Harry reached the house. The rosebushes from the picture were skeletal twigs now, lines of ice crawling along the stalks, but the house looked just as charming as it had in the summer photograph, now blanketed in a soft layer of snow.
Harry groaned, but Malfoy dragged him over to an older gentleman who was setting up a sign advertising pies outside of his bakery.
“Mmm, don’t know about that,” Draco said softly, pulling Harry down for a follow-up. “Okay, continue with the story.”
It was meant to be a brief grazing of lips, something to throw Potter off his game and leave him gaping and shocked so that Draco could have a moment to collect himself before he plunged back in and proceeded to obliterate anything Potter shot at him.
“You owe me a favour!” Draco blurted out suddenly, abandoning the argument as quickly as he had taken it up.
Draco shook his head, smiling wryly. “Happy holidays, Pansy.”
“Are you sure you want to do this, Malfoy? You really want to give me the chance to destroy you twice in twenty-four hours,” Harry challenged, walking right up to the blond young man and staring at him right in the eye, which was a bit difficult, considering he had a few, horribly annoying inches on Harry.
“I said ‘could you be any more overdramatic’?” Malfoy repeated loudly, eyes shining with a familiar vicious triumph that had taunted Harry all through school.
“Just pick one,” Harry insisted. “Truth or dare.”
At least his friends hadn’t yet realized that something strange was up. Ron and Hermione were even starting to get used to Malfoy. He and Hermione managed to have several civil conversations about various assignments and while Ron had gotten into a furious debate with him over England’s new Seeker, afterwards he had quietly admitted to Harry that Malfoy had been right. It was an altogether jarring turn of events and the whole thing made Harry feel quite dizzy and unsure.
Although he was trying not to listen and simply decide whether he wanted a candy cane hot chocolate or an apple pie latte, Harry winced pre-emptively for the employee, as the man let out a long-suffering sigh.
“There has to be a magical way to shovel snow!” Malfoy said impatiently, frowning at the plastic implement. “Think, O’Leary. I’m sure between the two of us we can come up with something. I have a renter coming you know and I don’t think they’d fancy being ankle-high in snow the first time they go out of . . . Potter?”
back here,” Draco pointed out.
Now it was Harry’s turn to be confused. “Sorry, why am I supposed to be stopping the fire from burning? Isn’t that the point of having a fire?”
“I mean, she hasn’t gotten me anything since the split either,” he continued, breath puffing out in clouds in front of him. “But I think getting her something would be nice.”
“Good.”
Obliging, Harry tossed the red ball at Ron’s right shoulder. His friend batted frantically at it, but only succeeded in clipping it and sending it further over his shoulder.
To Harry’s great concern, Susan’s lip began to tremble and her eyes grew glassy. “I-I just can’t!”
“I’m sorry,” the barista interrupted, looking terribly confused by what Malfoy was saying, but also very apologetic. “It’s actually not mistletoe. It’s a sample of the herbs that are in a new tea that we’re working on promoting.”
“What?! Why?” Ron asked, looking even gloomier.
Potter fidgeted, slipping his hands in and out of his pockets, before deciding to just let them hang by his sides. “I wish I’d worn my robes.”
I hope you all enjoyed this first chapter! Let me know what you think in the comments!
Damn. Harry hated it when Malfoy was right.
Kudos and/or comments are as wonderful as being finished listening to horrific gingerbread kids songs.
Granger nodded eagerly. “Yes, as opposed to the minister for magic at the time, Leving Quilp, who tried to pass all that legislation in the Wizengamot about restrictive rights.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy shook his head doubtfully. “That sounds a bit risky, Potter.”
“No worries, mate.” Ron patted him on the shoulder. “Sorry to hear about the crowd.”
A moment later, another set of footsteps thudded against the floor as Malfoy came around the corner, robes billowing behind him, stopping short when he saw Harry sitting on the floor. His gray eyes were wide and frantic and his pale cheeks had gone even pinker from running. A lock of his light hair fell over his forehead and Harry felt the sudden urge to push it back for him. Instead, he clenched a handful of his robes and turned his eyes away from the other boy, who was so infuriating, and beautiful, and . . . and confusing! Or maybe it was Harry who the confusing one. Or at least the confused one. Confused by Malfoy, who was watching him so hesitantly, mouth open as though he wanted to say something. But most of all confused by himself and his reaction to the Amortentia. Harry knew that such a powerful potion was unlikely to be wrong. And Snape may be many things, but a poor potion brewer he was not, much as Harry hated to admit it. Which then had to mean that . . . that the strange feeling he had been getting around Malfoy recently was exactly what he had been afraid to admit to himself it was.
Flicking the light off, he went downstairs, where O’Leary was practically bouncing with excitement, still wearing his knit beanie. In steady contrast, Draco was slowly knotting a slate grey scarf around his neck, carefully examining his appearance in the foyer mirror.
Kudos and/or comments are as wonderful as Princess Leia's badassery. :)
Harry was completely mesmerized.
Madam Hooch walked out onto the field to confer with the team captains before the game started. The match wouldn’t be as ugly as a Slytherin-Gyffindor game, but inter-school Quidditch games were always rife with competition and fouls were common.
(See the end of the chapter for
Grabbing his broomstick, Draco crept out of the dorm, and out of the Slytherin common room. The castle was unnaturally quiet, most of its occupants still sound asleep. Even the people in the portraits had their eyes closed, not a single one noticing as Draco went past them and out onto the grounds.
Potter fiddled with his hair, tugging his hand through the unruly waves while he stared at the scuffed floor.
Potter rolled his eyes, sighing frustratedly as he finally caught his breath. “No, I
They fell into silence again, but this time it rung less harshly in Harry’s ears. The air in the room felt lighter, the tension thinned with their casual remarks that were about nothing and everything.
did every year. “Draco, what have I said about questioning my judgement?”
Harry could feel the Slytherins’ eyes on his retreating form as he and Malfoy walked over to the side of the Hall.
“Are you now living in Hogsmeade?”
Despite the continued character pain, I again urge you to think of all the chapters of happiness I gave you before this time and humbly ask for a comment and/or a kudos! Make me as happy as Draco and Harry are made by each other! Or just feel free to yell at me about the past couple of chapters. I’m good with anything! I know your pain!
Oh, god, the mistletoe. What if Malfoy was dying in the snow, without Harry ever having told him how he . . . that he . . .
Harry faltered. The thought felt jarring. This was different. Harry had wanted to kiss Malfoy before, sure, but it had always come from a place of burning and desire, not . . . whatever this was. This strange fluttering warmth in his stomach that made him want to curl up against Malfoy’s shoulder and whisper sweet-nothings into his ear, like the first snow.
Draco cast a quick drying charm on the ink and then folded the letter up, slipping it in his pocket to take to the owlery later.
“Well, that’s more of a punishment for me,” Harry complained, placing a soft kiss on Draco’s mouth.
Harry scowled. “We said we’d meet at quarter after two, so I would say that a search party was more than warranted. I’ve been freezing to death out here for over half an hour!”
“I told you it would be on the front page,” Harry said gloomily, staring down at the copy of the
“Wake up, mate,” Harry insisted. “It’s Christmas!”
“How flattering,” Malfoy said drily. “I always wanted to inspire insanity in someone. Very romantic.”
Wow, final chapter! This has been a crazy ride y'all. Writing over thirty thousand words in twenty-four days. I hope you enjoyed it!

“Oh, I wouldn’t do that,” Harry said quickly, not wanting the elf to get in trouble for his own foolishness. “I’m sure he’ll move on to some other Christmas thing soon and he doesn’t mean any harm.”
Prompt #15
George’s eyes twinkled with mischief. “I knew it!” He said convincingly, patting the sloshed Mr. Weasley on the shoulder. “Good on you to come out and say it, Dad.”
“I miss the Three Broomsticks,” Harry mused aloud.
He shrugged, half smile playing over his lips. “Well, that happens to work out quite well then, because it just so happens that I also, against all odds, like you, Harry Potter.”
Harry gritted his teeth and let out a controlled breath. “I need you to pretend that we’re dating for at least a week or two, so my story doesn’t fall through. Then we can break up and I can string out the broken-hearted excuse for a nice long time and that should get me through any proposals until at least next term.”
“Of course it is, Potter, I’m trying to distract you with my dazzling wit. But obviously it’s not working.”
“Pansy, you’re making a scene,” Draco said, nodding towards their audience, who immediately all turned away and pretended to be busy with their various ruses.
“Alright, here it goes.” Harry cleared his throat self-consciously. “Once upon a time there was a little boy—”
For a brief second, he contemplated Apparating back to his London flat and forgetting about the whole thing. Being followed around and harassed everywhere he went wasn’t really that terrible after all. Not compared to staying with . . . with
“What?” Harry asked, half laughing. “I am on holiday. I don’t have a job. I’m literally on permanent holiday.”
“Hello, Potter,” Malfoy said casually, leaning back in his chair with a smirk.
“What?”
“The new Hufflepuff keeper,” Malfoy nodded towards the yellow-robed figure in front of the hoops. “He keeps leaning over to the right each time that he thinks there’s going to be an approach. Might want to add it to your notes.”
“Ahem, er, I just realized that I need a book,” he said loudly, trying to sound casual.
,” Potter said, sounding as though he were savouring the word, and sending a strange lightness through Draco in the process. He felt snow-chilled fingers find his own, the touch so familiar, and yet seemingly different now than before.
“Where are you spending the holidays, Mr. Potter?”
“No, no I’m fine,” Harry assured hurriedly, swinging his broom over his shoulder and grabbing one end-handle on the crate.
He glanced up at Malfoy, who had managed to catch his fall, startled by how grey his eyes were this close. He’d never really had a proper look at them before, he realized idly. They looked like the sky right before a magnificent storm began.
Just Draco.
Chattering his gratitude, Harry opened the closet to see an organizer with drawers of carefully folded scarves, hats, and gloves, all belonging to Malfoy, as was evident from the spicy scent of his cologne that he had been using for as long as Harry could remember. For years, whenever he smelled cinnamon, he heard his voice and felt the energetic anger of their fights sparking through him.
Potter sighed, but began dishing his own supper.
Ron shrunk back in his chair.
“Oh,” Ron commented blankly.
You know the drill: kudos and/or comments bring me happiness akin to crushing on James Potter, burgundy lipstick, and vegan mushroom fajitas! <3
Ron sobered and clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “You’re right. Sorry, mate. Rather you than me though.”
Goyle let out a short laugh, recalling the incident for himself.
party when his
The smirk vanished from Malfoy’s face. “Alright,” he said slowly. Harry noticed how tightly he gripped the table as he moved to stand up. The sudden motion threw Malfoy off balance and he tipped over against Harry, who reflexively caught him, arms tightening around his waist like the day before. Malfoy pushed back quicker than before though, tilting dangerously again. But when Harry put out an automatic hand to steady him, Malfoy batted it away, staring down his nose imperiously and making use of every bit of the extra three inches he had over Harry.
“Draco Malfoy has a secret,” Pansy said mockingly. “What a surprise. Planning to do something to Potter and his little friends?”
It was Ron.
Basically he had to act like every other wizard and witch in the whole damn world.
(See the end of the chapter for
Weasley scowled, freckled skin scrunching across his face, but let out a testy “Fine,” and turned back to his heaping plate, stabbing his food rather viciously.
“Any time,” Malfoy said softly, resting a hand on Teddy’s blond head.
He watched as his two best friends stepped into the fire place one by one, shouting their address aloud and disappearing in a flurry of green flames.
Draco gaped at him, spluttering. “W-what?”
Is it sexual?
“Well, you might want to save some room for this.” And with that, Malfoy slid a small vial of murky liquid across the table towards him.
Malfoy’s face was so close to Harry’s that he could feel the faint whispers of his trembling breath. His grey eyes were wide and fixated on Harry’s face as the two boys stared at each other. Harry could feel Malfoy start to shiver, water droplets still clinging to his porcelain skin in memory of the freezing swim that he had just unwillingly taken.
He tried a different tactic. “It’s only a couple days until Christmas. Can’t you wait a little bit longer? Have some patience?”
“Draco, you’re doing it again!” Pansy said sharply, grabbing Draco’s arm before he could walk face first in a wall.
And that’s when she slapped him.
“I absolutely do not,” he said huffily. “But to answer your question, yes, they did.”
Potter stared at him, displaying the shock that was ricocheting through Draco’s insides. He opened his mouth to issue a hasty explanation, the substance of which he was not yet sure of himself, when Potter’s eyes suddenly lit up with understanding, his gaze flickering to the various people in their proximity.
“Let’s go see that sweater!” Harry said, gathering up his gifts and heading down to the common room, a grumbling Ron close on his heels.
Kudos and/or comments are as wonderful as latkes (which I will be going to have leftovers of right now).
“Peace?” Harry offered as they stepped outside of the community centre.
“Sorry,
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling him down into a kiss. It was slow and sweet and familiar and perfect in a way that Harry never would have imagined. And then it was fast and breathless and burning with every touch. Harry trailed his mouth down Draco’s pale neck to the edge of his collar, tearing off his green and silver striped tie so he could trace the faint lines of Draco’s collarbone. If the Prophet saw them now, he thought bitterly, the cruel comments would rain down on them harder than hail. He could practically hear the voices, edging closer and closer . . .
And the misery continues! It honestly hurts me to write about these two in pain!
