"Adrian, you don't have to entice me, I'm already yours for tonight anyway," Draco interrupted the erotic monologue. "However, I do have to stay for a while more and you're making that very hard."
“Sure. If a wife divorces her husband, she is not entitled to anything. For Light Wizards the most important thing is the unity of the family and it must be upheld at any cost.” Ron sounded like he was reading from a book, the Muggle-raised wizard realised. Perhaps there was a book.
"I like it too," Hermione confessed. "I would love to learn more about Wizarding culture. Books just don't seem to have everything in them. The ones who wrote them were purebloods themselves, so they take for granted things that are strange to us Muggle-borns."
When he was breathing normally again, he kissed Draco deeply. It was strange to know that the salty taste in the other man's mouth was from him.
First, he looked around for Ron. He would not be pleased and would probably make a scene. He was glad when he didn't find him. Ron was probably still stuffing his face.
Harry was happy, and it scared him. He hadn't been this happy probably ever in his life. All right, at the birth of his children, but that didn't last. It must have been an effect of the drug as well, as all his emotions had been muted. However, since his divorce and establishing his relationship with Draco, he had been happy, and so had his new partner. Even the older Malfoys looked pleased. James took a while to come around, but after a while he realised that his father smiled more. He also happened to love the Quidditch pitch on the grounds of Malfoy Manor, once the winter cold passed. They had all started to think of the Manor as their home after a few months. They swam in the pool, had their personal house elves assigned, and the children had their own rooms which they filled with their things. Though usually, come morning, Albus was found in Scorpius' bed, the two of them having fallen asleep after playing. Harry was a bit concerned at how attached they were, but he decided that it was something that would evolve, or devolve on its own. Lili was the granddaughter and daughter to Narcissa that she never had, and was spoiling the little girl rotten. Harry was concerned, but also glad that his little girl had the female attention she craved. It was something else that needed time to resolve.
"I don't drink it, so I wouldn't know." Harry shrugged. "So, you said you wanted to bring about educational reform. Why are the Light Families against it and the Dark Families for it? I would think that it would be the Dark Families that would be against Muggle-borns integrating." He leaned in towards Malfoy, giving him his full, undivided attention. The other man looked down at the empty glass, collecting his thoughts for a moment.
"Children, let your aunt go for a bit, I want to introduce you to the Malfoys," Harry spoke up once he thought they had crowded their aunt enough.
He found himself in a sculptured garden lit by strategically placed torches. There were various paths leading around rose bushes and other flower beds that were empty at that time of the year. In the centre stood a large fountain, warm water cascading down in a cloud of steam. Stone benches surrounded it, and Harry decided to take a seat. However, as he approached, he noticed a lone figure already occupying one of the benches. His white blond hair gleamed in the faint torchlight and Harry recognised him as Draco.
Draco smiled and embraced him. Harry returned the embrace, then they kissed lightly, enjoying the feel of each other.
"Of course, Daddy. I have an idea already." She grinned at Harry, probably already picturing him in the outfit.
Albus and Lily nodded, but James quickly spooned a few more mouthfuls of his breakfast in, and left the table.
He quickly dressed and frowned at the fact that all he had were a few items of clothing. He crept down to the first floor. He may have been crap at Potions, but his eggs were even favoured by his uncle, who complained every year that he could only have them in the summer. Well, he would have to wait a lot longer now, until eternity. He only hoped the blond teen liked his breakfast as much as he liked the dinner last night.
As Harry got cosy in another set of beautiful sofas, he wondered how come his were so terribly uncomfortable?
"You run along now. Tell Hermione that we are in my office," Draco instructed and walked away, expecting Harry to follow as always.
"It is hard, but I try to stay away from her. Luckily, she was placed in the guest wing, which is as far away from mine as possible. She's Draco's pet project, apparently. He picked out her dress and everything. I really try not to meddle into his political affairs, but it is stressing to even know the woman is under my roof." Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust. Apparently, Draco's wife didn't share his views.
"Wish they would restore it," Harry remarked, and Draco nodded. "So, where are we going now?" he asked. They had spent the whole day exploring the ruins, and night was fast approaching. It had been a good idea that they packed sandwiches for lunch, but it was getting colder, and Harry just wanted a warm place to rest, and some warm food to eat.
Harry complied and increased the speed of his movements. Draco under him was trying to hold back, he knew, but he still made little jerks to either have Harry take more of him into his mouth, or put more of his finger into his arse. When the moans changed into Harry's name in a breathless and repeated fashion, he knew the man was close, and wasn't surprised when, his mouth was flooded with his seed, and the tight ring of muscles clenched around his finger. He tried to swallow, but it was so much, he choked, and ended up coughing it up onto the bed in an effort not to suffocate.
“You—” Harry’s pulse rushed forward ahead of the rest of him; dizziness made him clutch at the doorjamb. “Is she—”
“She’ll protect us, you know,” Ginny said, and Malfoy looked up. “She… Well, she can feel us. Or so Seamus said. When we get closer, she’ll protect us.”
Why did it cause so much pain when he’d already known? He barely kept from biting his lip by sneering at Harry instead. It didn’t feel successful; Draco had to get out of Harry’s presence before more pieces fell away.
But there was something even sourer in what Draco Malfoy was not saying. Betrayal lay there, something this man knew more than enough about. He’d stared it in the face and dropped his eyes up on that tower, just before events had rolled out of his control. Did any of them really have control? Or was it an illusion given by leaders who inevitably fell, or threw their followers to the hounds as they rampaged forward?
“Is it selfish of me to want—” Blaise said it quickly, then pursed his lips. “I feel like there’s so much I haven’t done.”
He was out of options. They all were. It just felt wrong to drag her into something he himself didn’t want, and as for the person he
Harry felt the wards begin to drop, folding down layer by layer. It was all wrong, everything felt wrong this time. Harry’s stomach lurched. Something in the castle shimmied violently. He pulled with all his might and finally succeeded in freeing his hand from Luna’s grip. He closed one of Oliver’s hands over hers and squeezed his arm hard until the other man turned to face him.
Draco froze, and then Blaise felt hands scrabbling over his own hips, pulling at his shirt. “Blaise.
A muted boom sounded, louder than the others. Ron whipped his head around to stare at her. Hermione met his eyes, and suddenly he was at her side, adjusting her haphazard robes, hands just… touching her. Shoulder, arm, the curve of her waist. “It’s… Hermione. It’s downstairs. Just. You—”
No, he wasn’t… wasn’t ready for that question yet. Not yet, gods, why did it always have to come back to his reasons? He didn’t think he could lie to Draco, and it came to him with a start that he hadn’t lied to Draco in years. Not since their Hogwarts days. Harry pushed away, sat up.
“He was bitten!” Seamus snapped, stunned at his own vehemence. He could barely breathe, listening to Blaise’s rasps. Or maybe he was the one rasping. Blaise didn’t look like he was breathing at all.
She expected fire, the railing and the fury that were Malfoy’s by right. But she could not have prepared herself for the way that fire died. Malfoy closed his eyes, turning just as Ginny understood the glitter at their edges. His throat bobbed.
She’d as much as said she would look, that it would be little trouble. Luna was many things, but she was not a liar, not to make anyone happy or to suit any ulterior purpose. Harry was no fool: he knew her wards would be strained. He also knew it was the safer option. Until they exhausted it, it was ludicrous to send anyone out after Seamus. He didn’t need another death on his head.
Seamus lay on his back on the hospital bed until he couldn’t any longer, and then he sat. Then he walked, round and round Blaise’s bed with one hand trailing over his lover’s body, touching his bare arm and his hands, his face, forehead, and the familiar slopes of his feet beneath the blankets. Contact, always in contact.
It waited for a botched raid on a Death Eater compound; it waited until Dean Thomas was dead by Avery’s hand and the rest of their group had barely escaped with their lives. It waited until those who had gone on the raid were scattered across the countryside, until there was only a tall cathedral with disintegrating walls. Until there was only
Harry’s throat closed up. Seamus’ eyes darted, glistening. He looked so frightened. “He is my bloody life, Harry!”
“Okay. Okay.” He reached for Draco once more. As soon as he came in contact, though, an ache flared in his belly, as though he hadn’t eaten in ages. He frowned and drew a steadying breath. “I want to try something. To help you sleep.”
Harry’s stomach was full of lead. He’d forgotten, somehow, what a fearsome foe Dumbledore was. Had always been. Behind the grandfatherly kindness, the befuddlement and the half-moon spectacles, there was an intellect capable of driving despair into the hearts of the worst of wizarding kind. Of smashing them into utter oblivion. Hermione, Ginny, Luna… They were the most obvious choices for a bond, so obvious that few would look again and wonder. Voldemort had their magical signatures. He certainly had Harry’s. He had Draco’s right in the palm of his hand, and yet the connection would never be made.
‘Make it at least three fingers!’ Harry yells as he’s making his way to the toilets. He feels his blush spread up to his neck as he enters the stall.
Harry hums. His stomach is rumbling from all the delicious smells. The Count makes his way over to the bed and positions a tray in front of Harry. It’s filled with pain au chocolate and croissants, strawberries and peach juice. Harry’s mouth waters. The Count sits across him on the huge bed, legs crossed. He looks relaxed, his hair disheveled. ‘Please, tuck in.’ The Count nibbles at his croissant. ‘Coffee will be here in a second.’
Yeah, sure. Draco grins. As the stinging in his sides becomes too much, he has to halt. He bends over wheezing, his hands resting on his knees. His breathing is raggedly, his body shaking from the effort it takes to fill his lungs. He resists the urge to cough up phlegm. His heart is thundering. Harry’s voice sounds closer.
‘Excellent. Now back into character, Mrs. Potter.’ I stick my thumb in her mouth and feel around for hidden evidence. She sucks on it looking me straight in the eye. My cock stirs it’s neglected head at the sight.
Harry gets up too, still panting. ‘That was so fucking amazing, Dray. You coming without a single touch.’ He unties the ropes and rubs my wrists and ankles.
Fuck! He sprints away. He hears Harry’s footsteps nearing as he makes a dash for the border. Of course he’s too slow, with his ankle still hurting, and he feels Harry closing in. He runs into a clearing. The light filters in through the trees, shining in bright rays on a patch of daisies. I looks soft.
‘I’m going to search you now.’ My hands start at her sides, gently tapping from top to bottom, making sure I “accidentally” touch the sides of her breasts every now and then. I take a good while to search her legs, starting at the ankle and working my way up. I’m circling her thighs, raking my fingers up and down. I hear her whimper.
‘No.’ Malfoy pulls his hair hard. Harry grunts and lets go of his own hardness. It’s compelling, not being in control. Harry thinks he’s never been more aroused in his life. His knees on the uneven, leafy forest floor, his hair hurting from Malfoy pulling it, his throat stretched to the limit, his own prick neglected and leaking, looking for friction of any kind. Malfoy slows down, pushing in his cock even further. Harry gags around his prick, unable to breathe. He feels like he’s choking. When it gets too overwhelming, Malfoy pulls back, only to push in as deep again. Suddenly he removes his cock. Harry swallows. This might be the moment. He can’t deny he’s frightened a bit. Will it hurt?
Harry bites his lip and looks away. He is right. He didn’t offer anything. He just got freaking turned on from a gun to his head. He should’ve talked to that mindhealer when he had the chance. But as his life is probably ending soon, he’d better not waste the time he’s got left analyzing his feelings.
Selfless love is more Harry’s thing. Not everyone is as generous as Harry Potter, not everyone has as much love to give as him. Even my bratty Hogwarts student self knew how unselfish this man was and bullied him with a hero complex I now recognize as an altruistic desire to help and love. We must be careful with him. Of all three? I think he’s the most likely to get hurt.
Draco captures my lips in a searing kiss. We stand there, deepening the kiss and stroking each other where we can reach. He helps me pull my sweater over my head, while I unbutton his shirt, both kicking of our shoes at the same time. Not wanting to break kisscontact, I reach down to open his trousers and push them down. He unbuttons my jeans and yanks them off, together with my boxers. I try to step out of them, but of course I stumble. His strong hands catch me.
I circle him, and stomp my foot into his knee pit, while pressing him down, my thumbs piercing the hollow under his collarbones. Not able to hold himself up, he falls to his knees. I take out my cock and get in front of him. I grab his hair.
Drapunzel hears his mother and lowers his hair. He feels strange. Like this is the first, but also one of unnumbered times.
‘What the...’ Harry gasps. He knows those eyes. The stranger pulls off his hood and smoothens his hair in one fluid movement. Harry‘s deceitful feet take an involuntary little step backwards.
‘Step out of your knickers. Now.’ I use my hands to part her arsecheeks and feel between them. She doesn’t particularly like having anal sex, but she sometimes does to accommodate me. Today is not one of those days, as it’s all about her pleasure. ‘You are lucky the potion doesn’t fit there.’ I tell her as I make my way to her front.
In which Draco wants to talk and Harry tries to take it slow, both failing miserably at their resolutions in their haste to undress each other.
‘Imagine how the pillows taste, if I find Marmite-ing them an improvement.’ We both laugh. My eyes are puffy.
‘You have no bloody right’, Suddenly I’m yelling too, as pent-up anger surfaces, ‘No fucking bloody right to read my stuff. I’m not one of your criminals. You didn’t bring a search warrant. Last time I looked I wasn’t in an interrogation room. You have no right to go all ‘oh-I’m-the-high-and-almighty-auror’ on me. You understand? If you want to know something about it? YOU COULD HAVE BLOODY WELL ASKED LIKE A NORMAL WIZARD BEING.’ I stomp upstairs like a petulant Hogwarts first year, iWiz clutched to my chest with one hand, the other flipping him off. Hmm, I’m more upset than I thought.
Servants with trays full of drinks and finger foods make their way through the room. Harry feels overwhelmed for a moment, watching the dancers on the floor, swirling around laughing. He sees masks of all kinds, horned ones, some with long, Venetian beaks, Phantom of the Opera styled and feathery ones. Rustling gowns leave shoulders bare and dive low between breasts, or have long sleeves and push up cleavages. Silk and satin shirts are worn, some buttoned up, some open to the waist. The trousers are tight and leave nothing to the imagination. Harry feels at loss for a moment, surrounded by such lush decadence.
‘I see you agree with me it isn’t fair my cock is being neglected. I think you should use another part to give me pleasure too.’
Harry’s heart feels like it’s hammering out of his body. He starts seeing white dots, as his breathing comes in small pants. He comes with a low moan, spurts of semen soiling his hands and stomach.
One finger turns into two, three. Just Harry twists his fingers, so he reaches Draco’s prostate. Draco moans around Boy Toy’s cock. Suddenly he feels the fingers being replaced with... a cock.
A sigh escapes him. That feels good. He softly presses deeper, feeling the hole stretch a bit. He bites his lip again. He lubes his finger again, and then his cock. The finger returns to his hole, as he circles his cock with the other and tugs it a few times. He pulls away the foreskin and lets his hand slide over his cock, spreading the lube further. He imagines Jareth kneeling behind him, lining up that impressive cock and pushing it in his hole. He can only imagine what that would feel like.
‘Want to feel pain. Feel anything.’ Harry averts his eyes. He feels a blush creeping up. He hasn’t blushed in a decade.
Draco feels his cheeks flush, but keeps his pace, eyes focused on Harry. He feels his release building up, balls tighten, a telltale sign he is very close. ‘I can’t hold back much longer, Harry.’ His heart is pounding so loudly, he thinks the table next to them is able to hear.
I swallow. My cock is hardening. Quite the performance, since we just had some bloody perfect sex an hour before.
But no. They can’t do this. It will put Malfoy in jeopardy. He breaks out in sweat. He’s astonished to notice he feels something and that the feeling is strong. ‘Malfoy, I can’t ask this of you.’
Distraught, Draco all but runs outside. Only to be stopped dead in his tracks by Harry catching his wrist. Harry leans in and whispers in a low voice ‘if you ever wear these again to work, I’ll be taking them off. Just so you know’. His gaze fixates on Draco’s. Are his emerald eyes challenging him? He lets go of Draco and walks away, leaving a perplexed Draco behind.
Harry lathers his fingers in lube and presses one finger in his arse. Gently bobbing it up and down, moaning at the impact. My movements might be restrained, but my cock sure as hell isn’t. And it’s already achingly erect.
‘Yep. I’ll tell you all about our good family name and the lovely Malfoy deeds.’ Another snort follows. ‘But not today, Harry.’ No, Draco thinks, not today. Today he has other things to learn and discuss. He casts his eyes downwards. ‘Today I really need to discuss precautions.’ Draco swallows a he looks at Harry through his lashes. He feels his heart beating so loud, it almost explodes in his chest.
Her face is close as she whispers in his ear. ‘You know you’ve been naughty, Drapunzel. You leave me no choice but to punish you. No nice food for you. I will be back tomorrow.’ She chucks Drapunzel’s long locks out of the window and makes her way down, tugging hard when she’s down. With a sigh, Drapunzel pulls up his hair and twists it in an intricate bun. It’s heavy, but he’s used to it. He thinks. He feels the burn of his flesh where Mother’s hands were. The sobs return.
‘Fuck, Pott- Precious. You feel so fucking good around my cock.’ The Count presses in even further, until he’s in balls deep. He waits a bit, so Harry can adjust to his hardness.
‘For fucks sake...’ Making a decision, Draco quietly starts moving his hand. At first he’s terrified, but when he looks around, he still sees no one noticing his actions. Biting his lip, to refrain from making noises, he sets a slow pace. Harry keeps on eating, seemingly not interested in what’s happening. Does he do it wrong? Should he hold Harry’s prick too? He wants to be good to Harry, but he seems to be doing a bad job at it. His hand becomes motionless.
‘You realize that in my position, one can’t have distractions like these pantaloons or this...’ Harry gives Draco’s cock a little squeeze. Draco suddenly thinks breathing is overrated as his breath catches in his throat.
‘You wouldn’t!’ Draco suddenly doesn’t feel as self assured anymore. He starts shivering from the cold, wet spots on his trousers, come dripping from the tablecloth. He feels embarrassed and wants to flee. Or die. Whichever comes first. Harry senses his shift in emotions, and quickly casts a wandless, wordless cleaning spell. He feels Harry’s magic wash over him. His trousers dry instantly, he feels a rush of warmth in his limbs. Gratefully, he looks at Harry.
The Counts loud laugh reverberates inside Harry. ‘Oh, Precious. Be careful what you wish for. I might offer it.’
‘On fours. Now.’ Harry scrambles on his fours immediately, surprised the forest floor suddenly feels soft as a bed. He looks up at Malfoy startled. Did he?
Malfoy uses a spell that undresses them and leaves their clothes of the sofa. That’s a useful one, Harry thinks, he must remember it. Harry feels the breeze from the spell ghost over his body. ‘Spell or lube?’ Malfoy asks.
‘Nope. If you show me your bedroom now, I’ll have to cancel dinner reservations’ Harry tells him, as he hungrily eyes his butt. ‘Which would be a shame, as I’ve gotten us a spot at the Ramblas’.
As I make my way up, I feel her shiver. Her hands slide to my hair. ‘Hands back on the window, ma’am.’ She looks at me challenging through the window, but complies. Her smoldering look shows me she’s got something in store.
I feel an erection forming in my pants. This is truly happening. Ginny enters and looks at my bulge before asking me: ‘need any help with that, husband dear?’ I smirk and open my fly.
‘Yes, Draco, it arouses me. Knowing you can take pain and discomfort. Knowing you’re turned on by force. It makes me want to fuck you right here, right now.’ Draco shifts, as something is growing in his pants. Shit, he is bonkers, to want this madness.
‘No, but I want you to put it in anyway.’ I manage a shaky smile. She returns it as she tuck a strand of hair behind my ear, her hand lingering on my cheek.
Draco’s cock stirs at the prospect. He glances at Harry as he takes another bun and starts smearing the sticky cinnamon sugar deliberately around his mouth. Harry looks at him like he’s ready to devour him, a thoroughly filthy grin forming on his lips.
Boy Toy moans. The swelling of his cock tells Draco he is close to the edge. He changes his rhythm to prevent him from coming.
She grins. ‘Just like you, Draco Malfoy.’ She is right. I wouldn’t have missed my time with Astoria for the world, nor my dear Scorpius. If I was even forced to choose between them and Harry? I sincerely don’t know which choice I would’ve made. We drink our tea in silence, both contemplating our families. The thought strikes me I still don’t know why she is here.
Just Harry stills as both men have come. He pulls Draco on his lap, without removing his cock. ‘You two, make him come. I want to feel his perfect hole clenching around me when he comes.’ Just Harry removes the cock ring. Sexy Arse swallows Draco and starts sucking with vigor, while Boy Toy fondles with his balls and kisses him deeply. Draco knows he’s close. He wants to draw it out, but he knows the attempt is futile. When Just Harry starts moving again, hitting his nerve bundle perfectly with every stroke, Draco tips over the edge. He pants curse words in Boy Toy’s mouth as he spoofs up Sexy Arse’s throat. He hears Just Harry panting behind him.
Malfoy’s eyes darken. ‘Be careful what you wish for, Saviour’ He puts the gun on Harry’s forehead. He doesn’t flinch. Malfoy swiftly moves the gun to the left and shoots it once. With a muffled thud the bullet impacts on Harry’s wall. He ejects the gun’s magazine in one fluid movement and tosses it onto the recliner. Malfoy rubs the gun over Harry’s lips. ‘Suck.’
Another small kiss. Draco whimpers as Harry gets to his cock. Never leaving his eyes, he gently pats it, from bottom to shaft, his balls receiving extra attention. Draco feels his cock swell. ‘So responsive.’
To get back at him, I thrust my tongue in at full force. It elicits a perfect moan from him. Our tongues are playing with each other, seeking each other out, checking if the right spots still are the right spots. It’s strange, kissing someone you knew intimately long ago. His hand grabs my arse, while he grinds his cock against mine and my brain shuts down.
Draco tastes a bit of pasta, its creamy, velvety texture melts away in his mouth, the rich, hearty, deep flavor makes him moan. ‘I would never have thought I’d be jealous of a strand of pasta, but here we are.’ Draco almost drops the bowl from shock. The dragons look at him angrily. He didn’t realize Harry had entered the kitchen. He looks up and finds him leaning in the doorframe, dressed in tight briefs, arms folded.
Harry nods. ‘Would you mind bringing over a basket to cheer her up? We could put in some of those cookies you made yesterday.’ Hermione is already filling up the compartments of a large wicker picnic basket.
‘Malfoy, obviously.’ I prevent my eyes from rolling as I reply, but it costs me a year of my life. ‘You’re not entirely happy, Har. I know you. You’re not whole.’
I come home early, hearing the creaking of the bed but not thinking anything of it. It is my play night with Harry, after all. When I enter, I see Harry on the edge of the bed, Ginny between his legs sucking him off. It’s quite the sight. But what stands out more are the soft, black ropes and the gag, spread out on the bed.
I should apparate, but my head is spinning. I’m too shellshocked, apparating is not safe. I decide to walk. Every step clears my mind a bit. When I’m close to my home, I see Mrs. Potter walking down the street. Too late to take a detour, she has already spotted me. I wonder if she really knows.
‘Don’t worry, love. You’re doing great. Giving us all such pleasure.’ Harry starts fucking Draco’s mouth in long, languid movements. He tosses his head backwards and moans.
‘Let’s just say we’ve got some very influential friends. Mr. Potter, I wouldn’t have called on you without a reason of the utmost importance. It’s Draco.’
Besides, a few snogs aside, he’s only had sexual experience with Ginny. It’s scary to start this whole dating thing, knowing he feels rather inexperienced in the sexual area. At least at this party he’ll know the one with the same mask as he is compatible. That might make it easier to let some of his walls down.
Still not a single shift. I grab her hair and kick her legs wider. I hear a tiny gasp when I pull her head back a bit, using her auburn hair as leverage. ‘You’re hurting me, auror. I’ll file a complaint.’
He enters, looking around. ‘Nice shed you’ve got’. A smirk is playing on his lips. He’s challenging me.
‘I’m really fucking sorry.’ A tear slides down Malfoy’s cheek as he fires the gun. Harry’s eyes lock onto Malfoy’s, before his head feels like it’s exploding. He sinks into nothingness. He will never know how Malfoy gently tucks his hair behind his ears and presses a kiss onto it. ‘I’m so fucking sorry, Harry.’ He whispers as he expertly cleans the room before leaving.
‘Good, me neither.’ He replies, as he pushes himself onto my cock. My hand finds his leaking prick and I start fisting it. Harry moans desperately, increasing his pace. Within seconds I feel him stutter and spill all over my hand. I’m not doing a better job, as I feel my cock stiffening and I still before thrusting one last time. ‘Har... oh...’ I keep on pulsing come into his hole, as I throw back my head. This man will be the death of me.
‘Oh yes, you featured every wank session I had since that day on the stairs. Thinking about all the filthy things I could do with that firm, round booty. Sometimes I had to toss twice to get rid of the image of your round perfectness.’ Harry’s voice is husky as he licks his lips.
Draco increases the pace, his breathing already becoming irregular. He knows he isn’t going to last. He shudders as his orgasm ripples through him, making him come in his pants like a 17-year old. Trying to catch his breath, he leans into Harry, foreheads against each other. They are wheezing together.
Harry strokes his cock in languid movements. Draco feels his balls swell. Harry stops. Draco gasps. When his cock softens a bit, Harry starts stroking again, licking stripes on Draco’s back and biting it.
‘Ma’am!’ My voice is angry as I fumble some more. I hear her running up the stairs and follow her up. She runs into our bedroom and slams the door. I push it open again, to find her on the other side of the bed. My face grimaces as I corner her, slowly, like a predator that wants to play with his prey.
He glances at Harry. ‘The way I used to wank after our fights, almost running to the loo with want. The adrenaline that sizzled through my veins after our encounters. I knew then and there that violence and fighting turned me on beyond avail. What I didn’t know yet is that I like to be commandeered, but the fucking bastards made me find out.’ Draco exhales.
‘Now, now, love. You shouldn’t have done that, should you? Do you want some of the omelette I’ve made?’
Harry closes the distance. He rubs his half flaccid cock over Draco’s legs and lower back and presses his body flush to Draco’s. ‘You will have to earn this orgasm. Let’s see how long I can keep you on edge.’ He whispers in Draco’s ear.
Draco looks at the omelette, drooling, and waits impatiently for Harry to make his move. Harry cleans up his plate with a crust of bread, and moves all the dishes to the kitchen sink. Harry crawls on the now empty table, laying flat on his back and spells the rest of the omelette on his stomach and cock. ‘You can eat now.’ He looks cheekily at Draco. ‘You’ll get dessert if you clean up your plate. Make sure you leave no crumbs behind.’ Harry pushes his hands behind his head and makes himself comfortable.
But Harry, the saviour of them all, leader first by accident and then by horrible, enduring trial… His pressure was greatest. And choosiness was not often an option. Might there not have been nights when the person who found a way into Harry’s bed was not a woman, but a man?
Something snapped. Everything, falling upon Draco from the highest heavens, and it wasn’t worth it. For the first time he felt it keenly, that it wasn’t worth it. His heart cracked in his chest. “Fuck you, Potter!
Ginny jerked up, her eyes flashing. It startled Harry again; he hadn’t realised how vociferously she might wish to protect her first guardians. “Fine. They were intimate long before I came to them. And they were intimate while I was there.”
Harry looked to where Seamus had crossed through the hall. There was no one there anymore. An inescapable grimness crept over him again. The hum of the ragged bond did not diminish.
Why had she helped him? Draco pulled up short and she slid to a stop just behind. They both looked over their shoulders into the dim weave of trees. A watery trail of blood ran down Ginny’s forearm. She’d been cut, then. By the branch? He heard nothing but the incessant patter of rain on leaves. The presence of magic frayed at his nerves. Ginny turned darting eyes his way, and he noticed the shadows pocking her face. She felt it too. And yet she’d come back.
Dawn’s rays were strengthening when he left his room at last. Malfoy would be long gone by now. Harry gathered several people and mounted the stairs to the room to retrieve the ancient books.
and he’d stiffened up in a way she couldn’t ignore. He wasn’t sure he wanted it. Ginny’s throat closed. His duty, then, and she might have walked into it blindly, accepted it for what she wanted it to be. She knew in that instant that if she said nothing, if she just carried on, Harry would continue all the way to the finish and she would have him, because it was what had to be done to stop Voldemort. But not because he wanted to be with her.
A door clicked open, and suddenly Blaise knew Seamus was there; the presence of the one who shared his bond tore a long furrow through the fog. He rolled dazedly, felt the bed dip, and a warm heat insinuated itself along his back. Seamus’ arm came around him, a delicious weight, and Blaise’s mind spun free of the chaos. He found energy to search out Seamus’ fingers, lace his own through them. Sleep, deep and expansive, took him at last. The passage of time vanished.
Malfoy looked away. Shut his eyes as if remembering. “Infernus Hex. Caught and killed in Diagon Alley by Aurors.”
There was nothing he could do to change it now, no backtracking and fixing to make things finally go his way for a change. If he could have done that, he might as well have gone back to a time before Pansy slipped into Voldemort’s shadow as a spy, or stopped himself from sleeping with Theodore that first night.
His voice was hoarse. Harry fought the instinctive flinch. This was not the Malfoy he remembered at all. “What is it?”
He was completely lost. He gaped at her. Flung his hands wide. “I don’t even know what you’re talking about!”
“He’s not himself,” she said after a moment’s silence. “He’s… Where is Zabini, anyway? If he’s going to find him, then maybe we can find them both. Bring them back.”
“It’s time,” he said in a low voice. Ginny spun and flung an arm around him, and after a moment’s surprise, he hugged her tightly enough to frighten her.
The wand in the Death Eater’s spindly fingers was aimed right at his face. Dark eyes gleamed from beneath the sodden hood, sweeping well over Draco’s head, back and forth.
‘I’m sorry, Gin. I really am. Let’s talk about this later, okay? Please, don’t stop on my account. I’ll be downstairs.’ Banging my head against the wall.
The telltale sign of stillness warns Draco Harry’s on the edge. He starts swallowing, prolonging Harry’s release. Harry’s orgasm is intense, spurts of semen fill up Draco’s throat, warm liquid trickling down his throat. Proudly he realizes he doesn’t gag. His cock throbs, but Draco’s not sure if he is allowed to continue.
I start sobbing. Frustrated, I bury my head in my pillow. My eyes start hurting from crying when I hear the stairs creaking. ‘Can I come in?’ Harry sounds reasonable from the other side of the door. But I’m not ready to talk, so I stay silent. He can’t force me to talk.
Draco feels his breath ghosting over him, leaving goosebumps all over his body. Harry kisses the side of his mouth. ‘So deliciously snarky.’
‘I’m not getting in that... what’s it called? In that Tower of Terror. Never!’ Draco’s already pale complexion is turning ashen with fear.
‘No, I’ve had sex. Just always relied on what I had done before. Never trying different stuff, I never trusted anyone.’
‘How did it go?’ I ask him, already knowing the answer. He laughs. I pat next to me. Harry sits himself down. We sit in silence for a while, watching the fireflies in the garden.
‘Hello gorgeous.’ A sultry bariton whispers in his ears. Harry looks beside him, to see a beautiful wizard bowing slightly. His silk shirt is open to the waist, showing his toned abs. His trousers are sinfully tight. He winks at Harry through his blue mask.
‘Such a lovely arse’. He swats it with his outstretched hand, leaving a red print. Harry yelps. ‘Yeah, just as red as that pretty face’. Malfoy tells him, as he gets on his knees behind Harry. His tongue trails down Harry’s butt. Malfoy opens his arse, stretching his cheeks with his hands. His nails are pricking in his flesh. Harry whines. Is he really doing what he thinks he will?
Harry hasn’t had a relationship or even sex since Ginny died two years ago. Not that people weren’t offering. He just couldn’t bear exploring pleasure with someone not her. But lately, he finds himself opening up again. Wanting to explore the feeling he’s not only into witches. He knows he likes to watch the wizards in porn mags just as much, their muscular, square bodies and hard cocks. He should just go clubbing and pull, as his friends have told him over and over. But going out for a quick fuck isn’t what he wants. People might only want him for the fame, he can never be certain of their intentions.
‘While I appreciate your creative thinking, today I have something else in mind. Now watch.’ Harry gets up and whips the omelette out of the pan. He halves it, and puts one halve on a plate. Harry sits himself back on the chair and starts eating. ‘Hmm, Good.’ He makes indecent little grunts while he eats. The grunts set up camp in Draco’s rapidly hardening cock. Harry groans appreciatively as he finishes his plate, licking his lips clean.
‘Am I, now?’ Harry squeezes his bone. Draco feels the pain returning in an instant and grunts through gritted teeth. Harry looks at him darkly. Draco’s stomach flutters with want.
I moan. ‘You might want to slow a bit, or I’ll be coming all over you in a second.’ I look at him, seeing my own arousal mirrored.
Mispy’s eyes widen when she sees Harry. ‘Master is having visitor stay?’ Her voice sounds astonished as she adds in a whisper: ‘Master is never having visitor stay.’
Harry’s hands slide down the Counts body, finding him in similar state. ‘Not more than you.’ He tells him, as he fondles with the Count’s prick, sliding his foreskin up and down a few times.
‘That’s a lovely offer, but no. Thanks.’ Harry tells him, as he gently pushes the wizard away and makes his way over to the bar. He looks around and sees the dancers move a lot more sensually than he at first noticed. Two gorgeous witches are kissing with fervor. A couple is in the corner, almost melting into each other. Harry can’t make out their gender, both are beautiful, slender and hot as hell. They notice him watching and laugh.
‘Would you like that, Draco? The feeling of being immersed in this beautiful, soft hole? Tap twice.’
‘I feel for you, Ronniekins.’ They all know Hermione’s cooking. It’s... well, gruesome feels like a rather understated word for it. Her idea of healthy food is undercooking all things that should be tender, adding sea weed and algae powders and reducing any fats. It wouldn’t be a problem, if she didn’t burn half off the food she served. He smiles to himself as he imagines her in the kitchen, fighting the food, wanting to show it who’s boss. She’s his other best friend, but when he visits, he makes sure Ron is cooking or he offers to cook and brings his own food.
‘We will use it tomorrow, to capture Bellatrix. But first, we sleep.’ Harry feels his eyes starting to close on their own. Draco yawns as he takes off his stockings and girdle. They get under the covers. Draco snuggles into Harry’s arms. ‘Might be my last change.’ He mutters. Harry’s not sure if he means the next day will be perilous or if he expects Harry to fuck-and-run. He hopes it’s neither, as he surrenders to his tiredness.
‘No! Harry, no. I’m not. I just... I need to get used to this. Okay? It’s... I’ve... never done something this bloody bonkers before. And you know I’ve done some pretty bizarre shit in our lives.’
We keep on kissing. There’s a primal reaction in both of us. If we keep this up, we’re going to dry hump each other on the desk. That’s not how I want it. Reluctantly I break the kiss.
‘You are much stronger than you look, beauty.’ Harry sees the Count behind the wizard. He’s kissing a witch, his hands cupping her arse. Fuck. He tries to see her mask, see if it’s the same as his. The Count’s eyes find Harry’s. He whispers something to the witch. Her head turns and she looks at Harry calculating, her tongue licking her upper lip slowly. Her mask seems the same. Fuck. She beat him to the Count. He tries to struggle free, but the wizard won’t let him go.
A witch in a pink feathered mask leans in and kisses him on his cheek, her hand cupping his crotch. ‘Too bad you’re already matched with him.’ Her grin turns devilish. ‘I wouldn’t mind watching, though’, she says and tosses her head back in laughter as she walks away. He swallows. What is this party? Why are people watching him so intently? What do they know, he doesn’t?
‘Stop thinking’ Harry looks at him. Draco is taken aback by the fierce lust he sees in his eyes. His pupils are blown, a small slither of green is visible. Does he have this effect on Harry? Wow. Suddenly he feels fucking bold. Two can play this game, Harry, he thinks and decides to put up a good show.
‘I’m just checking in on you, Harry. Don’t you dare not go.’ Dean must’ve told his wife he was going to the ball. And somehow she knew he was doubting his attendance.
Harry gets up swiftly, casts some cleaning charms and summons a set of clean clothes. He writes two quick letters to Hermione and Molly, telling them he’s off on an adventure. He fastens them to Woolly, his new and fluffy owl. He packs a satchel and fills it with food and a bottle in which he can keep his conjured water. He floos over to the manor.
‘Don’t tell me you’ve never been offered sex before. What’s a bit of sex in exchange of a life? I bet it happens all the time.’
Draco flusters, but Ginny replies: ‘I do know, you big sap. You’ve always had more love to give than any other bloke I ever knew. And you don’t even realize it. It makes you the most bloody beautiful man I know. Sorry Draco’, she adds as an afterthought, ‘no offense’.
‘You say that to all your playthings, I’m sure.’ Harry voices the doubt he’s had from the start. The Count has had so many fucks, he probably thinks this one mediocre. At best.
Malfoy summons his lube. It’s a big, half empty jar that’s seen better days. ‘Damn, they haven’t made this fucking brand in years. Nobody wanted to fuck the Saviour? Bent him over this lovely fucking sofa? And I used to think you had it all.’
Spent, they lie on the recliner for a little while, waiting for their breathing to even out. Malfoy gets up and casts a few cleaning charms. He dresses and tosses Harry his clothes too. ‘Mustn’t leave evidence.’ He half-jokes. The atmosphere changes. Malfoy looks at Harry from his standing position.
‘Don’t spill, love. It would be such a shame if I had to punish you this morning.’ Harry looks at him, his eyes glistening with playful provocation.
‘I’ll make it good for you. Okay? I’m not completely inhuman.’ He strokes Harry’s chin and lets his hand trail down, to his nipple. He pinches it, making Harry close his eyes in pleasure. His other hand keeps twisting an scissoring inside of Harry. His tongue licks stripes onto Harry’s neck, sucking at his pressure points. Harry whimpers.
Harry avidly does his chores, to keep his mind from wandering to tomorrow. When evening arrives, Harry orders some chickpea curry with roti. He eats it in front of his television. He knows just what he’s going to watch.
‘You, you’re Boy Toy’, he tells Harry number one. ‘And you’ He makes eye contact with Harry number two. ‘You’re Just Harry. Is everybody clear?’ All three Harry’s nod. ‘Good’. Suddenly Draco realizes he is in control. It makes him feel brazen. An interesting scenario plops up in his head, making him giddy with want. Can he play this part? He will try. He just hopes that Harry picks it up.
Looks like I won’t have to wait too long, as I feel Harry’s prick swelling and hardening, his pace becoming more erratic, his breathing uneven. He moans, as I circle my clit with renewed vigor. I feel my nipples hardening, my mouth twitching, my jaw tightening (for as for as you can have your mouth tightening with one very hard cock shoved in it to the hilt). I’m so close.
‘Tell him. Mrs. Plymouth called again about her neighbors habits.’ Draco suppresses a moan as Harry lips circle his crown, sucking gently.
‘The first time I got raped, I felt sick and threw up. Countless Death Eaters and other fuckers came by after that. They would come alone, at night. Some were gentle, almost kind. Some weren’t. I would still feel filthy in the morning, but the initial shock had worn off. It was better than being Crucio’d. After a while I started to enjoy myself. I liked the feeling of being helpless, being overpowered. I got aroused when they forced me on all fours, when they hit or hexed me. It made me harder than I ever was.’
It makes me smirk, even though I’m still mad at him. Knowing I’ve been a true arse too, I lift my head up. ‘It would taste better with a bit of Marmite, I agree.’
The bishop sleeves are wide, fuller at the bottom than at the top, gathered into a small cuff. He’s glad Dean has laid off on the ruffles and frills. The sleeves are gathered in a puff, right below his elbows. He buttons down the shirt, feeling the smooth metal of the buttons under his fingers. The soft linen hugs his body, Harry revels in it as he tucks the shirt in his trousers.
‘I wish I could sit around here somewhere.’ She is scanning our surroundings, her eyes resting on our front gate. Suddenly I wonder if she is as innocent as I think she is. She must know I live nearby.
He looks sideways at me. ‘Are you still sure you want this? If it makes you unhappy, I... I’ll have to stop...’
When I arrive home, Gin is already waiting for me, sitting on the porch swing Lily always loved so much. Her legs are propped up under her as she slightly swings to and fro, a crocheted blanket covering her fine legs, leaving her ankle free. Her blouse has tightened over her breasts because of her sitting position, giving me a nice view of her bosom.
‘Ma’am, article 305 section b clearly states an auror can restrain a suspect when she’s a flight risk.’
Remembering the old man’s warning, he hesitates for a moment. Feeling the sturdy and comfortable presence of his wand in his pocket, he shrugs. ‘To hell with it!’ he mumbles, as he strolls into the thick forest. The anemones are just behind the hill, he knows.
‘Nonsense, Hermione. You’re the best mom I know. You’re just tired. And Rose cries because she trusts you. You’re her safe haven. Now, get on the couch and I’ll fetch you some tea.’
Draco flicks his tongue over the now free part of Harry’s stomach, carefully avoiding his groin, licking it clean of salt and oil. His tongue swirls over Harry’s pronounced abs, sucking gently at his hip bones. Harry moans.
‘Always the martyr, eh, Potter?’ He hears a soft chuckle and the sound of the safety latch returning in its place. Malfoy lowers the gun.
The stranger looks up, his teeth flickering in the little light there is left in the clearing. Stormy grey eyes look piercingly at Harry.
‘You just need to go with the flow, Har. The greatest pleasure in life is love, there is no shame in that. There also is no shame in having fun after two years. Ginny would pull your ears if she saw you now, cowering away. You know that. So, you toss away that letter you were writing and you will go and have a lovely time. Bye!’ The floo goes black again. He grins. Luna has gotten the Divination post for good reasons.
Harry nods. ‘Fuck. You have no idea what you do to me, Precious Saviour. Lay back.’ Harry does, quite nervously. The Count pulls off his trousers and pants, eyes roaming Harry’s now naked body hungrily. ‘Such a sight.’ He props Harry’s legs up, for better access.
‘Bastard’ Draco grabs a spoon full of pudding and flicks it at Harry. Enjoying the startled look on Harry’s face, he fills up his spoon again, only to be hit right in the face by a spoonful of orange mousse. Harry’s laughter rings through the restaurant. They continue to keep throwing food at each other, until all bowls are empty and they are both breathless, crying from laughter. Harry gently strokes a strand of hair out of Draco’s face. ‘You are the best man in the world, you know that?’ He pecks a quick kiss on Draco’s lips.
‘I’m sorry for being an utter pillock. I should’ve talked to you like your husband, not as an auror. You were right, okay?’ I nod silently. ‘But I still want to know what I just read and why. Could we talk about it? I promise I’ll try not to lose my temper.’
Harry looks at me, eyes dark with lust and passion. He pushes himself up and lines up his cock with her cunt. ‘Like this, Draco?’
‘I want to spoil you, Harry. I want to tease you, kiss you, stroke you until you’re so over sensitized, you’re crying. I want to map your whole body, lick your nipples, tug your hair. I want to open your tight hole, stroke your pleasure spot with my finger. I want to suck your cock while I do it. Then I want to lather you in lube and fuck you in languid movements. I want to feel your come spill over me, your tight hole clenching around my cock, sending me over the edge too.’ Harry’s eyes are black with arousal, he licks his lips and shivers at my words.
Harry takes out his cock through his already open fly. Draco looks wide eyed at the sheer size of it. Harry laughs as he puts on a condom and slicks his cock with the lube. ‘I will fill you up so nicely, you’ll be screaming for mercy and more at the same time’.
‘You’re doing great. It’ll get better. I promise.’ Softly, he starts moving. Harry feels his hole opening even more and all of a sudden it doesn’t hurt as much anymore. Experimentally, he wiggles his arse, moving up and down slowly. He whimpers.
Looking around, he sees people are touching, kissing and stroking hair. A dashing witch next to him is grinding into a wizard. Her arse is slowly gyrating over his cock. His hands are deep down into her cleavage, kneading her large breasts. Her face is contorted in ecstasy. He can’t keep his eyes of her as she bites her lips and moans.
Harry steps into the suit Dean has made him. It’s over the top for him, but he supposes a plainer set would have him stick out in the crowd much more than this one. He puts on his socks and a pair of brown shoes. Shiny, but plain. Dean said his shoes shouldn’t divert the attention from his incredible mask, gorgeous blouse or even more gorgeous arse. He puts on a subtle glamour, the same he wears when going out shopping, the one that makes him less recognizable. Combined with the mask it should be enough.
‘And then what? What do you fucking propose?’ Wow. Swearing and the nostril thing. I’m in for a good show. He raises his voice. ‘You and Malfoy, sharing me? Holding one sodding hand each? Cuddling in bed together? Or no, how about visiting rights? You and him discussing who will have me in the bloody weekends? Jotting the freaking times on the freaking calendar? Never showing him or you at a social event, because what the fuck would the people think? You having sex with me while his spunk is still seeping out of my bloody arse? What the fuck is wrong with you?’
Opening his eyes he sees the Count’s amused smile. ‘You had quite the internal strugg-hmmhm’ Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It’s aim is a bit off, but the Count tilts his head down to move his lips in a better position.
He closes his eyes. What is he going to do? If he kisses the Count, he’ll know. Know what kissing a wizard is like. But does he dare? It’s been so long since he kissed, especially a stranger. What if he’s disappointing to the experienced Count? He can hear Ginny’s voice again. ‘Only one way to find out. Go for it, Tiger!’
I must look guilty, because Ginny rolls her eyes and says: ‘Men... Do all of you have the communication skills of a troll, or is it just you two? Maybe he should whack you in the head with a club and drag you into his fucking man cave by your hair. Maybe that way you would listen.’ She looks at me sternly and for the second time I wonder why she is really here.
‘For what?’ Is she about to disclose what I suspect? This can’t be. I massage the bridge of my nose.
‘Thank goodness! It’s about time you got laid.’ Dean smiles broadly at him. ‘Might stop you watching my arse.’
‘I want to have these conversation regularly, so I expect us to eat together every week, to prevent the trolllike miscommunication crap, that I know the both of you are more than capable off. And don’t you fucking dare to deny it.’ She sounds like a mixture of Molly an Hermione, a scary as hell combination.
‘It’s as Sybil tells you. Plymouth’s a prejudiced bitch. But I think we should send the aurors to investigate. Maybe something did happen to all the cats.’ Harry sucks vigorously, flying his hand expertly over Draco’s hard cock. Draco breaks out in sweat. He has to bite his lip to keep from groaning. Jaimy continues. ‘We should... Sir? Are you alright?’ Jaimy looks inquiring.
Draco returns his hand above the table and runs it through his hair. ‘I think you should send a team. But...’ Harry’s takes him in deep, his tight throat enticing.
Draco has to think of the quidditch manual being read by professor McGonagall to prevent coming in his pants, because the thought of Harry filling all his holes is suddenly overwhelming.
Still panting, Harry tells him: ‘You can come yourself too, love. Do you want that? I want you to be done in ten strokes. Can you do that for me?’
Without hesitation I fling my mouth to his. Before I know it, we’re kissing fiercely. Both struggling to get the upper hand, not letting the other win. Sometimes the sex is like that with us. Competitive, but ludicrously hot.
I tap twice. Harry grins a downright filthy grin as he gets in front of me and starts preparing himself. He puts one leg on the bed, so I have front row view. I want to moan, but the gag suppresses the sound.
Panting, they both take some time to steady their heart rate and even their breathing. Taking out his softening cock, he casts a wandless cleaning charm over them both.
‘Such a good bitch.’ Malfoy tells him, his eyes still darkened and shining. With a sudden plop, he feels Malfoy dislodging. Gently, he retracts his cock. Harry whines a bit from the loss of it. He feels empty. Malfoy pulls him closer on his lap and kisses him. Without hesitation Harry opens his mouth, allowing Malfoy to claim it. The kiss is sloppy and slow. As Malfoy breaks the kiss, he looks thoughtful.
‘I wasn’t ready to share him, Draco. I wanted him all for myself. I was selfish. I see how much he hurts now. That’s why I came here.’
‘You are the most wonderful spouse a man could ever wish for, you know.’ He kisses me on the lips. It feels good. I straddle him as I deepen the kiss and before we know it, we’re making out like a bunch of randy Hogwarts fifth years. The kisses are passionate, just as Harry’s passionate about everything. He holds me so tight, I almost can’t breathe. Well, breathing is overrated as it is anyway, so no complaining from me.
‘It’s Mrs. Plymouth again. She thinks her neighbor has eaten the neighborhood’s stray cats. All five. We all know it’s her fucking prejudice. She just doesn’t like that Mr. Adrien is a werewolf. But he’s on wolfsbane.’ Harry uses his hands to stroke Draco’s cock. It feels great. He has to use all of his willpower to even out his breathing.
Harry unshrinks the parcel. His hands tremble a bit in excitement as he opens it. Dean can work magic with clothes. The package reveals a dark green pantaloon and an off-white poet shirt. The fabric feels lush and soft. There is no glitter, nor feathers, but the fabric seems to have a pearly shine. Harry finds himself drawn to it, the need to stroke it overwhelming. It feels soft, cool and sensuous. There’s a note underneath.
"Ron, what is going on?" he asked to draw attention to himself, since the hand was just shrugged off.
Their food arrived, and they enjoyed the homemade pasta in basil pesto with some local wine. That was just the first course, as their main was a hot veal stew. They finished with a small serving of panna cotta with caramel.
“I’m only asking because if they were not, then you could just reveal that fact and they would be yours. Of course, you can’t lie and say they are not, because a simple paternity spell would reveal it. Anyway, in this case, you will have to prove that he is an unfit father. That is the hardest thing to do. Perhaps he has beat or starved the children?” he tried.
"Weasley here is requesting a new partner. He says his reason is that you're  sleeping with his wife, Potter." Harry shifted in his seat at the  accusation. "You know I don't tolerate any disruptions in the lives of my  Aurors. I find their work suffers and that is when people get killed." At  that moment he seemed to have finished glaring at Ron, so he turned instead  towards Harry, who tried to not flinch. "So, I called you here to work this  out."
Harry didn't get as much shut-eye as he had hoped; however, because he was woken again rather rudely a few hours later. It was another Weasley, though this one happened to be his wife. She was shaking him and calling out his name. He groaned and mumbled something unintelligent that he wanted to mean ‘go away', but he was unsuccessful as Ginny was relentless.
The discussion took up the whole morning and afterwards they all had lunch together in a great dining room. The atmosphere was relaxed and the children talked excitedly about all the fun they had. The plan for the afternoon was a small nap for the children in Scorpius' room, while the adults would also retire for a bit. Harry was glad to see that Albus and Scorpius were becoming great friends. James was sometimes a bit miffed as the two other boys would rather talk potions and their favourite author, Nocer Picard. Lucius noticed this and started a conversation about the history of Quidditch with the older boy. Harry was also fascinated by some of the stories about the world of Quidditch in the past 50 years that the eldest Malfoy could tell.
"Okay. I'll let you know ahead. If at some point you don't have a finger in my arse, you're doing it wrong." The blond smirked and lay back, spreading his legs to make room for Harry.
Let me give you another warning, if you haven't gathered as much already. There is going to be a sexual encounter between two men in this chapter and in the following chapters as well. If you don't want to read anything explicit, please read the edited version on fanfiction net. Continue reading at your own risk.
Harry just nodded and paid for the two books. After saying goodbye to Mr Blotts, who had clearly enjoyed witnessing a banter by the legendary rivals of Hogwarts, the pair left the shop.
Harry was a bit afraid of what his children would say to that, but the exclamations of joy put his mind at rest. The older Malfoys were smiling as well, and Hermione wore a wide grin.
“You would take that whore into your house?!” Ron was shouting at that point and Harry was afraid the kids would overhear. ‘Whore’ was not a word they commonly heard in the house. “Maybe you’re the one who’s shagging her! With Ginny travelling all the time, you must be lonely. I always knew she had the hots for you!” He was pointing at Harry, spit coming in large drops out of his mouth as he screamed at the man in front of him.
The only dark-haired man in the room nodded along, seemingly hanging onto the man's every word. Arthur's attention was also focused on him, his tea seemingly forgotten on the coffee table.
Harry and Draco soon reached the familiar office and both took a seat on the couches surrounding the coffee table, facing each other. Almost immediately, a house-elf appeared with the tea set and poured them both a cup, then popped out of the room. Harry wondered if there was a sort of warning system that alerted the little creatures to someone entering that particular room.
Lucius Malfoy was not the big bad boogieman anymore either. When they first met, Harry had been genuinely terrified of him. He was magically strong, politically influential and economically powerful. By the time he was released out of Azkaban five years after the war, he had lost his influence. Also, rumour had it, a lot of his money went to the restorations and even property had been sold. Of course, his magical aura was still impressive, but it no longer had that oppressive edge that sometimes made people's hair stand up on their backs. He had retired from the public scene and even gave his family seat in the Wizengamot to Draco. He still attended balls and Harry had seen him around, but he was much more quiet and reserved.
‘Next, I want to be honest. To the both of you. Never hiding seeing the other. The way I feel it, we are in this together. As two of the most important people in the world I really hope you’ll get along. I can’t force that, though.’ I gulp. It’s difficult to talk like this. So pragmatic and businesslike. It’s the exact opposite from who I am.
Draco’s eyes are burning as he whirls around. I follow him and grab his wrist. ‘Draco, please listen to me.’ He shakes it off. I fall onto my knees in front of him. Me, Auror Potter, begging for forgiveness. How desperate I’ve become. I beg him to stay. Beg him to listen. But he stands there, looking like a bloody statue in a muggle fountain. Unrelenting, eyes cold, skin made of marble.
Harry finds the gorgeous flowers in a small clearing, just down the hill. Molly will love these, he thinks as he sets to picking. Plucking dazzling pink, purple, red and white ones, he starts to feel like himself again. Why did he let an old man scare the shit out of him? It’s a good thing he’s not an auror anymore, Harry contemplates. Who wants an auror on duty who chickens out when talking to an old bloke with a ridiculous old-fashioned green outfit? He laughs at himself. When he’s got a large bunch of anemones in every possible color, he wraps them up with the string Hermione put in the basket.
‘Malfoy, What the fuck are you talking about? I...we... The aurors thought you were dead. Killed by Greyback.’
‘The Ramblas? They’re booked up in advance for months! What did you do? Use your never ending Hero Fame to get us a seat?’
Do you know the feeling when you're being chased in a dream? The fluttering feeling in your stomach when you wake, aroused and half hard? Well, this was nothing like that, Draco decided while hiding behind a tree, trying real hard to adjust his breathing. It was way more uncomfortable in real life.
In which Auror Harry has some rather indecent interrogation techniques, but Ginny doesn’t complain (because it’s kind of hard to do with your mouth full).
A small pop sounds, and a cute, fully clothed house elf apparates into the room. She is wearing an abundance of pink, frilly things. ‘Master be wanting his coffee now?’
‘Sure, no problem. You just hurry.’ He kisses her on the cheek as she makes a dash for the door, shrugging on her outer robes and grabbing an apple on the go. On her way out, she yells: ‘You should get her some flowers, Har! She loves those wild anemones. Thanks, you’re a dear!’ The door closes with a heavy thud. Harry sighs.
Ginny undresses me in the chair, while Harry tests the ropes. He is doing it the muggle way, which is tremendously arousing. He tugs the ropes, gauges their flexibility. When I’m starkers, he ties me up, so my hands can’t reach my cock. He leaves plenty of room for my legs to move. ‘Try it, please. Can you stomp?’ I put my foot down thrice, creating three clear thuds.
I pack for the weekend. I’m not sure what I’ll be needing. The note said casual muggle attire, so I pack three suits, two pantaloons and even a tailormade jeans. When the packing is done, the waiting begins. I’m restless until Friday morning, needing more wanks than at Hogwarts.
He looks at me puzzled. Well, puzzled doesn’t quite do it justice. He looks at me like he’s a squib and I just explained in detail how to cast a Patronus. His lips are slightly parted.
She opens them and looks at me. She moans as Harry pounds into her. His cock is making soppy noises as he thrusts. ‘Oh Draco, I’m so close.’
‘Such a lovely, little prey. As red as your cape.’ Malfoy starts unbuckling his belt. His hands unbutton his jeans, as he tugs out his hard cock. He puts his hand on Harry’s head and pushes him down. Hard.
‘Har? Harry? Are you crying?’ I get up and kneel before him. My hands find his face and grab it. I wipe away his tears. ‘Look at me. Talk to me.’
He watches himself in front of the mirror. Dean has done a great job. He looks sexier than he has in a long time, albeit the kind of sexiness from a nineties vampire movie. His hands slide over his thighs, loving the way the soft fabric feels. He lets his hand rest on the outline of his cock for a moment, feeling it twitch under his hand.
I smile. Ginny clasps her hand over his. ‘I feel the same, hun. We must make certain a fucked up feeling doesn’t last too long. But that’ll be alright. We all are verbally strong people, we can voice what we like and dislike.’
Harry laughs. ‘So eager, dearest Draco. We’ve got all the time in the world. But as you’re so insistent, you can suck me off right now.’ Hmm, the prospect of getting him off in the loo goes straight to his cock. He gets up.
The Count looks at him. ‘You didn’t like it?’ Harry grabs his hand and moves it to his rock hard prick. ‘Oh’. The Count smiles a hungry smile. ‘Want me to suck you off now?’
I see a crooked smile tugging at Harry’s lips. We’ve been together long enough now for him to deduce from my body language what I’m feeling. ‘You like it, handsome? Tap twice against the armrest if you do.’ I tap twice. ‘Want to start?’ Two taps. He grins and walks over to the bed.
‘What? Did you expect sex with a werewolf would be gentle?’ Malfoy looks at him sternly. Fuck, it’s even more arousing this way. Malfoy’s pulsing, enormous cock is dangling in front of Harry’s mouth. This is something he can do. It’s a bit bigger than he knows, but it’s something he’s done before. It makes him a bit more confident. Harry opens his mouth obediently as Malfoy fists his hair and feeds him his cock.
‘Green.’ He manages to tell him in a hoarse whisper. He feels Harry smile against his back. He also feels his cock swelling between his arsecheeks. He pushes his arse backwards, hoping Harry will take the hint. Harry slides in, his hole still open and slick from Harry’s come. Draco moans. ‘Yellow.’
‘Dray, handsome, hundreds of muggles make use of this every day and there never is news of someone dying.’
‘I’ll be off. Best of luck! I’ll think of you when I’m biting in my avocado salmon nigiri.’ He ducks as Ron swats at him.
Harry is already in their office, leaning on his desk with a paper cup of liquid golden coffee, whiffs of vanilla spreading from it. As he enters their workspace, he sees Harry’s emerald eyes travel down quickly. He hears Harry’s breath hitch in his throat. Confident, he steps it up a notch and drops his quill.
The kiss is hot and aggressive. Malfoy’s hands pull Harry’s hair. It makes Harry groan into Malfoy’s mouth. He hasn’t felt anything like this in ages. Malfoy licks a stripe in his neck before getting up and opening his trousers. ‘I must bloody be out of my fucking mind.’ Malfoy mutters as he takes out his hard cock. Harry looks at him through hooded eyes. Malfoy’s pupils are so dilated, Harry can only see a slight sliver of grey. He’s sure he’s not doing better. Malfoy grabs his hair and feeds him his cock. Fuck, Harry thinks, he’d forgotten how arousing it was to taste another man. Malfoy thrusts in, not holding back. Harry chokes. Malfoy pulls back. ‘Sorry.’
When she’s entered, I deliberately fumble with the curtain, to give her some time. Of course she makes a dash for it.
The Count swats Harry’s hand away and grabs both their cocks in his hand. Slow, languid strokes make Harry whimper. He surrenders to the wonderful feeling of another cock against his, while the warm water washes over his hair and back, the soft smell of sandalwood lingering. The Count sucks his neck, marking him. Harry’s moans become louder as the Count’s movements get quicker. They pant in unison as the Count moves faster and faster. Harry comes first, the Count follows directly after, their spunk mingling with the water. Harry leans his forehead onto the Count’s for a few moments, both gathering their breaths and waiting for their heart rates to return to normal.
‘I don’t want a foursome. I’m afraid it will hurt.’ Draco looks at Just Harry through his lashes, blinking innocently, hoping Harry will get that he’s so ready for this, but wants a bit of coercion.
Not fair, Draco thinks. He has struggled for what feels like forever to stagger the few meters he has traveled. Harry crosses the distance in mere seconds. He puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder and swirls him around.
‘Why did you ask me to bring clothes? I’ve got a feeling we won’t be engaging in a lot of activities that require clothing.’
‘Nah, you can do that yourself. I kinda like you doing all the hard work.’ Harry strides back over to Malfoy and kisses him long and rough. ‘I really have to go now. Or I won’t be able to pull myself away.’
‘The mouth on you, so not worthy of a princess.’ Harry’s finger finds the right spot and Draco groans.
Draco tears of a piece of the fresh loaf of bread and slides it through the greenest mojo verde he has ever laid eyes on. His hand shakes, he spills some mojo on his hand. Wanting to wipe them clean on his napkin, Harry grabs his wrist in midair and guides his fingers to his mouth. He starts licking his fingers clean, one by one, sucking and blowing as he goes back and forth. Finally he releases Draco’s last finger with a mischievous pop. Draco has to adjust his pants, as his erection is getting uncomfortable to sit in. All of a sudden he’s very aware of his surroundings.
‘Good boy. Get yourself ready.’ He licks his lips appreciatively as Draco gets up, legs wobbly. Harry hands him a bottle of lube.
‘I really would like you to suck my cock. Have you ever done it before?’ Harry knows he shouldn’t ask, but he’s too aroused.
He tries to sleep, but sleep won’t come. He’s dreading the next day, his heart heavy. Tomorrow, he has to let him go. A silent tear rolls over his cheek and splatters on his pillow.
‘Right now, I’m telling you it’s enough. That ankle is seriously broken and needs to be healed, or it can leave a permanent injury. I don’t want that. And I know you don’t want that either.’ Harry strokes his hair. ‘I care for you, precious. How come you are so mad at me?’
‘Ah, you’re British. We’re Canadian. It’s nice to speak some English. Is he afraid of elevators?’ The woman asks.
Ginny pokes her head from the kitchen: ‘Don’t be bloody barmy, you two. I already know you fuck, so I think I won’t spontaneously combust into flames when you peck him on the lips.’ She disappears.
‘Very well, sir.’ The waiter nods and retreats. Harry puts the plates on the sides. ‘Bend over.’ Harry’s order jolts through him with a rush of adrenaline. He’s really doing this.
I sigh again. This will be a long day. I’m considering my options when a kind looking elderly muggle couple come up.
She doesn’t do it. She’s going to put up a fight. It’s a good thing she’s not looking my way, because there is no way in Hell I could hide the lust that’s rushing through me.
Harry looks back, feeling his cheeks heat up again. He shakes his head. ‘No, dear Count. I would very much like to try and suck yóur cock.’ He can’t believe he just said that.
Harry closes the distance slowly, eyes never leaving Draco. ‘Gods, you look so fucking pretty.’ He strokes his hair and lightly presses his lips on Draco’s. A familiar yet totally different kiss follows. Harry’s tongue trails Draco’s lips. Gently, he gives Draco’s lush bottom lip a bite. Draco gasps. Harry’s tongue uses it to enter Draco’s soft, needy mouth. Draco whimpers in his mouth, the sound goes straight to Harry’s cock. When air is needed, they break the kiss.
Harry makes a new pot of tea and sits down, waiting for the oven to finish its baking. His mind wanders to the party for the umpteenth time. Would the Count really have eyes for him? There must be lots of people going for the first time. It’s probably just a coincidence. But it would be great, wouldn’t it? Like a fairytale. Harry imagines dancing with the Count, swirling the room, heads held up proudly. He smiles at himself. Romantic sap. Would he dare to kiss the Count? Would it be different from kissing a girl? Would he even dare to go further? He blushes when he thinks of all the things he’d like to try out.
‘What will I do with you?’ Harry holds both his hands above his head, using only one of his own. Draco struggles to get free, but Harry is too strong. His other hand reaches down and pulls down Draco’s trousers. Deciding it’s too slow, he hauls Draco up and binds Draco’s hands to a nearby tree with a wordless spell. Unable to move his hands, Draco kicks at Harry. Harry glares at him as he catches his leg. His thumb lingers over the sore spot on his ankle. Looking Draco in the eye, he forcefully presses it. Draco groans, his eyes rolling backwards. Harry drops his leg.
‘Green?’ Harry looks at him, concerned head cocked to the side. ‘You know you can stop me at any time, right?’
‘Please, more.’ Harry’s eyes open and flick to the Counts. He needs this so fucking badly. The Count looks at him entertained. ‘Count? If you can still look at me like that, you aren’t fucking me hard enough.’
Harry makes his way back. He casts a wandless lumos. A small bulb of light floats in front of him, just clear enough to see his surroundings. Harry is glad to see it works even without his wand. A male singing voice comes from the tower. Harry freezes. The soft melody drifts towards him. Harry’s never known how clear and powerful Draco’s singing voice is. He mustn’t let it distract him, he decides, as he continues his path, the beautiful melody wraps around him like a blanket.
Tomorrow. The talk has to wait until tomorrow, he thinks as he feels himself slipping into a deep sleep.
‘Damn, Draco. I would never! I meant what I said to Drapunzel. I would never intentionally hurt you. I... I really like you, okay?’ Harry feels a blush creeping up.
Harry gently grabs his chin and tilts it back, looking into Draco’s eyes. ‘I really like you, Draco. I don’t want to hurt you unintentionally, so it’s crucial we have this conversation. I do respect if you’re not ready to talk yet, the consequence is vanilla sex. We both know that’s not what you want.’
Harry sits on his ridiculously soft, comfy couch. He has put on boxers and a plain white shirt, that is clearly in love with his abs, as it clings possessively around them. Harry pats the couch next to him. ‘Sit.’
‘You bloody fucker.’ I push him backwards. Too late I realize this is what he’s been waiting for. He sidesteps and grabs my arms when I storm by him, wrapping them up behind my back with a piece of cord that he must’ve conjured wandlessly. This is bloody arousing. I never tell him, but I could come thinking of the sheer power of his magic. He is the strongest wizard I’ve ever encountered, and I’ve lived under the same roof as fucking Voldemort. He could overpower me with a flick of his wrist.
We eat in silence. Harry seems to want to start speaking, but decides better of it. When we’ve finished the food, spelled our plates to the kitchen and warmed up some left over tea (mum would be so disappointed with me, if she knew her only daughter turned out such a terrible housewife), we start talking at the same time.
I’ve seen her naked before, it’s unavoidable when living together, but I’ve never seen her breasts this perked up, nipples hardening as Harry sucks at them, his hand stroking her other nipple.
In the kitchen he checks if the monitor spell is working. When it does, he returns to his cooking. Harry creates a gorgeous Gorgonzola lasagna, a thick and nourishing tomato soup, pasta with broccoli-basilicum pesto and some pork chops with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Satisfied with all his hard work, he notices he hasn’t used the peaches yet. He quickly peels and slices them, and hides them under a thick layer of crumbled dough. Harry uses Hermione’s heart shaped baking mold. He pops it into the oven next to the lasagne and cleans the kitchen with a flick of his wand.
Draco doesn’t know why he’s so lucky to have this. Doesn’t know if it will last, because nothing ever does and he always ends up devastated. But before his train of thought can thunder down that particular depressing rail track, Harry’s mouth pulls the emergency brake and forces his brain to shut down. Pleasure spreads through him, making him moan and glow. Harry’s praise seeps through, his brain subconsciously registering how precious Harry finds him, how beautiful and how promising. Draco surrenders and lets go, his orgasm rippling though him on a wave of warm pleasure and newfound trust. He’s never come this peaceful in his whole life.
Draco looks grateful at Harry. He thinks he can trust him, but he’s just not ready yet. His legs start swaying, but Harry’s strong arms catch him. Exhausted, Draco lets Harry lead him to bed. He feels Harry’s magic cleaning him up, transfiguring his shirt into a comfy tee as he covers him up in blissfully soft blankets, stroking his hair gently. ‘You did so well, love. Now sleep tight.’ Harry presses a soft kiss on his forehead. Draco feels more than he sees Harry give him a sweet smile as he drifts to sleep. The sleep is long, heavenly and for once the nightmares are absent.
I’m silent for a while. When I talk, my voice comes out more gruff than I intended. ‘I’m... I’m not good at sharing, Mrs. Potter.’
Bellatrix picks up a mobile phone. What the hell? This must be how they stayed under the radar, Harry suspects. He hears her talking to someone.
Unhurriedly he steps out off the dress. Harry’s breath hitches in his throat. If you would’ve told him yesterday that the sight of Malfoy in a girdle would arouse him beyond words, he would’ve reserved you a bed at the Janus Thickey ward. But now? Now all he can do is stare at Draco’s pale complexion, contrasting sharply against the shiny, dark stockings. All the blood that was in his face from blushing, rushes to his already spent cock, making it half hard again.
‘Dear Merlin, are you shy? The great Draco Malfoy, embarrassed to be nude?’ Harry grins. ‘I’ve already seen your cock, thrice, love. I think I can handle the rest of you.’
‘You’re welcome. Eat up, you need the calories for what I’ve got in store for you. You can make it up to me this evening. Love, H.’
He checks himself in front of the mirror. As he turns small circles to wave out his dress, he feels sexy and beautiful. A real treat for prince Harry. He smile a genuine smile. He walks down, pretending to be a princess on a ball, making his grand entry. He waves at the imaginary visitors. He sits on the window sill in the light of the setting sun and starts braiding his hair. Everything will be alright. Mother might force him into loneliness, she can never touch his imagination. He starts singing a soft tune.
‘Spear yourself on my cock.’ He shudders at my commanding voice as he eagerly presses his hips towards me, my cock disappearing in his open hole. I shiver too. ‘I won’t last long, Har’, I mumble gruffly.
Draco shakes his head. He flushes even deeper, sure that Harry doesn’t want anything to do with him anymore, sure he’s doing it all wrong. He wants to retreat, but Harry starts speaking in encouraging tones.
‘Oh yeah. It still is.’ Draco looks over his shoulder, arms remaining tied above his head. He watches Harry clean himself up, a devilish grin on his lips. What the?
‘I feel guilty for having gotten off twice, while you’re still hard’ Draco doesn’t dare to look Harry in his eyes. He must be disappointed with him.
‘Yes, I’m fine. Don’t worry. I think all the partying has left it’s ma-oh...’ a very arousing suck cuts off his speech. ‘Left it’s mark.. I’m sorry aurors. My head is killing me.’ To emphasize his words, he grabs his head and frowns deeply. Harry keeps on stroking him in an even rhythm under the table, sucking softly at his tip. Draco keeps his hands above the table, to prevent the young aurors from jumping to conclusions.
Together, they eat the chocolate croissants from Harry’s satchel and drink some conjured water. They take battle positions and it isn’t long before Harry hears Bellatrix’ voice telling Draco to lower his hair.
‘Touch yourself’ Harry orders. Draco’s moves one hand to his cock, finding it surprisingly hard and leaking again. ‘Jerk off. I want to feel you come around me’. Compliantly Draco starts wanking as Harry keeps on thrusting in him. This afternoon Draco thought he had never been this aroused in his life, but now he’s ready to adjust this statement, seeing stars as he keeps on tossing in sequence with Harry’s thrusts. He feels his movements falter as his breath comes out in uneven puffs. ‘I’m close’.
She looks at him with so much devotion, for a moment I’m taken aback. I know I once felt the same. It needs to resurface a bit more, but I know I’m almost there. I decide I mustn’t be jealous. He didn’t chose me then, but he does choose me now. And her. It’s funny how compatible we are. I start to develop a deep liking for this auburn haired, witty woman with her heart on her sleeve.
‘Thanks for the support, mate. I’ll remember you throwing me in front of the lions when I write my will.’ Ron mutters.
‘This won’t do, Draco. I want to know precisely what you consent to, or I’ll be going home right now. Alone.’
Harry watches as Bellatrix climbs up the golden rope. When he hears the rhyme, he knows he’s in a weird version of Rapunzel. He waits patiently before she returns, without her basket. Silent as a mouse, he follows her.
Panting, they sit next to each other on the floor. Draco’s hands search out Harry’s cock. Harry swats his hands away. ‘Not now. There’s no time.’ Seeing Draco’s disappointment, he adds: ‘I think those trousers deserve a proper dinner date, don’t you?’, His voice comes out croaky. Draco smirks at the thought of Harry being hoarse in all their meetings this week, him the only one knowing why. ‘I’ll pick you up at seven thirty.’ He casts a quick scourgify on the both of them, as Draco gets up too and dresses. Counterspelling the door, Harry leans in close and whispers ‘I’ll be fucking you right after dessert, so try to keep those pants clean until then’. He winks at Draco and walks out to get another mug of earl grey.
Draco’s brain is unable to process what’s happening. Harrys weight is crushing him into the wall. He feels his cock stirring.
‘Did you really think you could get away with this?’ I see her checking the surroundings. Oh, this will get even better. I know her every move, I know what she’s planning. I stand behind her. ‘I will have to do a full body and cavity search now. Just to make sure you’ve got not other stolen goods.’
‘Now you’re ready.’ Malfoy kneels in front of the recliner and slides Harry’s arse to the edge of it. He grabs his legs and puts them on his shoulders. Harry is pressed against the soft fabric of the recliner. Malfoy lines up his cock with Harry’s hole and pushes in, inch by inch. Harry has trouble relaxing. ‘It’s been some time.’
He flings open his eyes, to see not one, but two Harries on the carpet as a third one enters through the door, wearing nothing but a lopsided grin. Harry has plunged them into a foursome. Draco grins. He knows he can safe word out any time he wants to.
‘We cannot warn you enough: should you encounter the suspect, do not try to approach him yourself, but contact the aurors immediately. You can also contact the Quibblers anonymus tip line by owl or firecall the auror department. This is crime reporter Harry Potter for the Quibbler News Group’ Harry wraps up the broadcast.
‘Don’t.’ The Count grabs his hair and pulls him back towards his cock. ‘Try and cover your teeth with your lips when you suck.’
I’m waiting for him. I wish he was here already. I’ve never wished for something in my life this badly. I don’t know which outcome I fear most. Him and Draco getting together, or him being destroyed by a rejection.
‘No.’ I tell him simply, as I cross the room. I’m close to him, I can see the almost unnatural bright green of his pretty eyes, that are cast downward. Eyes that are swollen and bloodshot. I take his chin. ‘Look at me.’
Harry tries to mimic Bellatrix’ voice, as he waits for the rope to come down. Carefully, not wanting to hurt Draco, he climbs up. When he pulls himself up and swiftly throws his legs over the window sill, he sees Draco, hiding behind the curtain.
‘Let go. Come for me. Let me feel you come.’ The Count keeps thrusting, a tiny film of sweat forming on his beautiful face.
‘Don’t’. A clipped voice comes from his large recliner. Harry freezes. He senses the strangers tone tolerates no contradiction.
‘Smug tosser!’ Draco yells. Harry pops his head back in. ‘You might want to watch that foul mouth of yours, auror Malfoy.’ Lowering his voice, he adds for Draco’s ears only: ‘Or I’ll be ripping those pants off to fuck you right through dessert, for the whole restaurant to see.’ Draco swallows hard. Tonight looks promising. He’d best start googling if treacle tart stains come off easily.
Ginny gets on her knees behind him, lining herself up. ‘Harry, I want you to pretend it’s Draco fucking you. Cry out for him, can you do that, luv?’
‘Oh Harry... You’re only a war hero, nothing to write home about.’ Dean rolls his eyes. ‘You could have everyone.’
The Count looks startled. ‘I’m sorry, Count. I have to be at work.’ He casts a tempus. ‘Well shit, in an hour! And I can’t bloody well show up wearing that.’ He points at his clothes as he quickly gets up and dresses, casting some cleaning charms. ‘I’m so sorry!’
Taking in the fascinating beauty of the place, he starts making his way. He follows the path, knowing he has to get off somewhere to fetch the anemones. He remembers there is a cluster of stones and mushrooms where he has to leave the path. Searching intently, he forgets his surroundings.
‘Sure?’ I nod. ‘I’ll be off, then!’ She salutes and enters the ride. Ginny lives for the rush. She likes the feeling of flying and being at an amusement park comes close when you can’t get on a broom, doctors orders. I understand she doesn’t want to wait.
‘Yes, please.’ The answer comes too quick, to eager. I support her as we walk up our garden path together. I order our tea as she settles down onto our garden bench.
Hesitantly, Draco reaches for it. ‘Oh, its much softer than I expected.’ He starts stroking it a bit. Harry groans. ‘I’m sorry! Did I do it wrong?’ Draco retracts his hand.
Harry fought against the grimace, teasing his lips over the slope of Draco’s chin and tasting the raw salt of their exertions. The throat under his fingers convulsed; Draco bent his head down and found Harry’s mouth, easing him upward. The familiar taste flooded across Harry’s tongue again, forcing the pain deeper. What was he taking? The only thing Draco had left, his body, but Merlin, Harry wanted it, even though he knew it was wrong. It was the sating of a long-held desire, one he hadn’t fully understood until it was about to be granted.
Molly Weasley was ‘mother.’ Indisputable. But Narcissa Malfoy had never worn that title in Ginny’s mind until now. Her finger crept out of its own accord and brushed the shining strands again. It was obviously a treasured possession, one for which Malfoy had sacrificed crucial space in his pack. Delicately coiled, tucked away in a box, and wrapped in a stained piece of cloak. Which was another mystery all on its own.
The sorrow in Luna’s song thrummed through him, and Harry stopped dead in the hallway, clenching his fist.
“The Siren’s Ward may be adjusted, to an extent,” Minerva said. “It is a protection spell, with its demarcations specified to this building and its surroundings. It could be shifted from the inanimate to the animate.”
The very idea made him moan. Draco scooped his cloak from the floor, then grabbed the strap of his bag. Harry moved again, one bare leg bending restlessly beneath the sheets. Draco caught himself looking and jerked away. He let himself out of the room as quietly as he could.
Harry bit his cheek to keep from lashing out. “Of course I do. But not at the expense of someone else!”
“Malfoy, I didn’t mean—” She took a deep breath. Why had she said those things to him? To prove a point? That his loss was for a good cause? There wasn’t any cause good enough and she knew that just as well as he did. “Not… Not Theodore. He wasn’t a sacrifice. Theodore’s death was an accident.”
He could also hear Ginny breathing beside him. She had gone pale; her lips were beginning to tremble. Draco sought inside himself, hoping that maybe… but the emptiness was still there. Lovegood had not filled it; she’d merely cloaked it, and there in the dim front hall, Draco had to deal with the pain of its presence once again.
Blaise pulled himself to his feet, cursing his own foolishness. Lying there in the hallway where any Death Eater worth his or her salt could find him… He pushed off the wall on wobbly legs and made for the nearest of the lit sconces. His torch was damp with disuse and took a few tries to light, but finally it flared. Blaise licked his lips and hissed again. A woefully soft sound. A frightened sound.
“It’ll kill him.” Harry choked on the words. “I look at Seamus and Blaise and I’m sure of it. I’ve never been more certain of something in my life, and I can’t even tell him no anymore.”
Harry moved closer, taking the bandages and Luna’s hands. The house elf blinked up at him with large, watery eyes, then backed away and vanished. Harry turned Luna’s hands over, surveying the pale skin, the bluish veins lacing her wrists. “Would it really be so hurtful to heal you?”
“All the fucking time, Hermione!” he snapped, but she didn’t shy away, and he should have known she wouldn’t; he’d seen this light in her eyes before and he knew what happened after, without fail. Hell, he’d counted on it so many times he couldn’t remember them all.
But his entire frame withered somehow. Harry was suddenly aware of the air in the room: heavy and teetering.
The blond head shook. Harry could see the confusion Malfoy’s answer was causing him, as if the truth were too large or the question a trick. Just as it had when he’d asked it previously.
“I want something that will allow for communication, quickly and over great distances,” Harry said as they traversed the halls together to a council meeting. Ahead, Su and Remus walked briskly, barely avoiding other castle denizens, their heads bent over crackling parchment.
want to fight for you. I want you to stay alive because you’re my friend and I love you. Harry, I’ve already lost someone I love, and I—”
She was expecting some sort of reaction, but none came. They all just stared at her. “You might need to use the defensive spells you know. But we have to be smart. We need to move as fast as we can and remain
Malfoy managed a sneer. “I’ve no reason to distrust her, Weasley.” He spread his hands. Ginny was vaguely surprised to see calluses on his palms. “Why in Merlin’s name would she let me stay outside and rot? I’ll have brought you to them, won’t I?”
“Truth is,” Blaise said at last, “I’m a little scared for you, too. This…” He gestured between himself and Seamus with a weak wave. “It’s not easy. Yours won’t be either.”
“What, Ronald?” She tried a smirk at the baleful look on his face but only managed what she was sure was a silly grin. She shoved him in the arm and promptly fell over him. “Ronald. Ronald, Ronald, Ronald.”
Blaise’s smile was tiny but real. He touched the loose red strands of her hair. Ginny blushed, ashamed of not joking earlier, ashamed of joking at all… ashamed of not coming clean to Blaise. He was so much more than a friend, he and Seamus both, and she couldn’t even talk to them about her worst fears, and anyway, they sounded so trivial and selfish,
A hand sliding over his face woke Draco from a pale, pale dream. He opened his eyes and found Harry leaning over him, eyes dark and fixed. The emptiness bloomed full force, as though his heart were being gripped, and he rose off the pillow, straining after that tether. The room was dark, the drapes drawn tight, but he could see Harry clearly, limned in light and drawing every cell upward.
All of them spun to look at him, except for Malfoy. His reaction was more puzzling. He twitched and blinked, and then raised his eyes slowly to Harry’s. There was surprise there, a sign of life, but it was barely present. Harry frowned. It was as though Malfoy had not actually expected him to be there when he looked up.
“Draco,” Harry tried. As though to silence Harry again, Draco kissed him roughly. Desperation rolled over Harry, and it wasn’t his desperation, it was Draco’s, tugging through the kiss, clinging to Harry by any means it could. Harry sought for it. He wanted to know the taste of it. He pulled Draco closer, dragging him fully onto the bed, wanting to stop this and never stop it at the same time. Why
The cruel orange of melting twilight swept into her eyes, banishing the dream. Ginny sucked in another breath. Her legs spasmed before she could stop them, and she sat up, tossing the cloak from her. Her hand climbed to clutch her shirt.
And there were those who were missing, as Malfoy had been for the past half-year: Daphne Greengrass and Graham Pritchard, fled the country. Marcus Flint, unaccounted for. Tracey Davis, unaccounted for, believed dead. Marietta Edgecombe, fled the country. Montague, disappeared after Calais.
Harry straightened. The question Moody spoke of had been meant for the entire group to hear, and the answer was not necessary for intelligence or even corroboration. But Harry was no longer willing to let Malfoy struggle for all of them to see. He would be the one to hurt Malfoy, and he would be the only one to hear Malfoy’s resulting humiliation.
“Millicent, you’re not on my side—” A fit of coughing shook him and he nearly fell. A hand caught and steadied him, and when he looked up, he found himself staring into chocolate brown eyes, wide with fear.
Harry’s eyes widened. He raised a hand in front of himself. “Nothing. I don’t want anything from you.”
and time to reflect on how razor-thin the line between luck and strategy was. Blaise’s hands were climbing over Seamus’ face before he could stop them, striking out of fear and anger, caressing out of sheer need. He bit at Seamus’ lips, caught a moan in his mouth, and then suddenly he was shoved away so hard he staggered.
Ron peered at her, then shot his arm out and caught her as she missed a step. He grabbed the handrail, and for one teetering moment, she was sure they were going to catapult back down the stairs into the Great Hall where all the alcohol was. “Good idea, that,” she said. Ron pulled her toward him and laid a sloppy, breathy kiss on the juncture of her throat and jaw.
The ones who could had managed to escape the inferno that had been their school. Draco had dragged Pansy off the steps and into his arms, hearing her whimpers of apology, terror, and tangled dementia in his ear. She’d passed out by the time he got her to St. Mungo’s and saw the damage that had been done to the entire Order that night.
“And then,” Su said without even pausing, “if you do this—” She grabbed a jar from the table and handed it to Hermione. “Here, go on.”
Not when every touch Harry shared with Draco was a slice into Seamus’ already bloodied flesh. Not when he could feel every inch of their strength in every inch of his raw wound.
Her palms were bleeding. Ginny stared at the four arced cuts from her fingernails. Draco got heavily to his feet.
He didn’t realise he was making sounds until Pomfrey grabbed his arm. Her eyes flashed over him, up and down. “Alastor, he’s injured, come here! I can’t possibly—”
She lunged and threw her arms around him before she knew she was going to. Blaise stiffened, his hand clinging to her elbow. And then she was
Toward mid-afternoon, Seamus woke from restless sleep to find the pervading calm again stealing over him. He cleared his throat and croaked for Madam Pomfrey, and she hurried from her make-shift office.
“I’ve come for Pomfrey,” Harry said quietly, gesturing toward one of the shelves. Draco didn’t even nod. He was afraid of moving and he wasn’t sure why. But to get out, he had to move.
It seemed miles away from any other Christmas she’d celebrated, here in the middle of a war-torn winter. And so many people weren’t celebrating tonight. People like Pansy Parkinson. Most of the Weasleys weren’t here either, and Remus Lupin, and Neville Longbottom. But she wasn’t going to dwell on that. So many people
He’d never realised until now how much the dreams, the anticipation, of what had just happened had driven him. And now...
She looked at him so sadly that he felt ill. “For a time, I thought… Perhaps if he weren’t so far gone already. But it’s too much. It’s a miracle he’s still with us. Your bond is keeping him alive, but it’s not healing him. I don’t think it has that power.”
When he had to tell her that the warmth was followed again and again by a wrenching disconnect, however, inconsolable pain and unquenchable, indefinable thirst, she looked so haggard that Seamus’ throat locked up and he turned away to look at Blaise.
Almost an hour later, they Apparated into one of the designated spots on the Alley and arm-in-arm swiftly walked to the restaurant. Harry's stomach was making audible noises by then and he really hoped they were going to get a table right away.
"Hermione told me that you know about Adrian and me." He didn't beat about the bush that was for sure.
Hermione looked at Harry with alarm at hearing this. They both knew that the Light Families were ignorant in their knowledge of the Muggle world and just like Mr. Weasley - they only saw the good side of it. They didn't know anything about how Muggles dealt with anything new or beyond their understanding. Still, they opted not to comment as Malfoy was explaining further and they needed to hear more.
"All right, I'm sure you all have enough to write your articles with. We only have an hour for lunch and I'm sure Harry is starving, so please be on your way," Draco instructed them, apparently appointing himself as Harry's media liaison.
"Just think, men like that used to stand where we are now." Draco draped an arm over Harry's shoulder, looking at the figures.
Facing those three redheads, Harry didn't know what to say. Arthur looked disappointed. Ron's face was scarlet, clearly indicating barely suppressed rage that Harry just knew was going to come out in a tirade any moment and Ginny looked close to tears. Her expression disturbed him the most. Here was the woman he married, the one he thought was the love of his life and he made her cry.
“Most of it is just jargon, the gist of it is that Ginny has signed the divorce papers. She wants the house sold and the price split, a house of her own bought for her in Phuket, and some alimony until she remarries.”
"It's fine, I don't mind." Draco was amused by Harry. "I called you here because I thought we ought to discuss the next phase of our plan. Where are you at in trying to regain your votes, Harry?" He fixed the other man with a stare. Hermione looked very amused at how Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
"I never thought less of him because of that," Harry revealed. "I know he was with Grindelwald in his youth. They parted ways over ideology, but I saw a picture of them and I know they had been happy at one point. Gods, it must have been hard to fight someone you once loved," he wondered aloud, but Ginny just scoffed at him.
“Where will she go?” Harry wondered. After the war Hermione had tried to reverse the memory spell that she had put on her parents, but it had turned out that she had put so much conviction into the spell that it was permanent. That was when she had been forced to move in with the Weasleys, as she had no home and no money. Harry offered, but Hermione did not want to intrude just when Harry was finally putting his life together and finding himself. So that now left her with no one to really rely on. It was probably easy for her to marry Ron after that, as they were already living together and a couple at the same time. It was a natural progression of their relationship.
"Harry, I will be eternally grateful for you," Draco said, looking into the green eyes of his lover. "Without you I could have never survived in the Muggle World. They would have probably found me after a few hours and last night would have been the worst night of my life spent in the bed of the Dark Lord. Instead, last night was the best night of my life. I have also dreamed of being with you, Harry. You are the most amazing lover I could ever hope to have. I toast to you, Harry, and the wonderful life we'll have together."
"I still don't understand what this whole thing has to do with you divorcing Ron." Harry was starting to get annoyed with how she drew out her story.
As he got his new body, Voldemort wanted to put it to good use right away. He made some remarks about having wanted to do this for years, and he cut off Harry's clothes as he was lying spread on the altar. He pumped his rather impressive cock, ready to plunge into the boy unprepared, when Remus Lupin and some other Order members finally apparated to the scene. The usual fighting ensued with the Death Eaters gathered to witness the restoration of their Master's body. Remus died. Harry was heartbroken, but no one seemed to care.
They were seated in a quiet corner and were handed their menus. A waitress in a green short skirt and light green blouse was there in a second enquiring about drinks and Harry just ordered tea, while Ginny chose medium dry white wine. Harry opened the menu and frowned after the first three dishes. He had no idea what he was reading. Therefore, when the waitress returned and Ginny ordered, he just decided to go with the same.
“Is that even a word?” Harry wondered as Draco dragged him to the piano that sat empty on a small stage in the restaurant.
“He … he even accused me of cheating on him with you! Like I would. I never saw you in that light and you were never that interested in dating or women either. I was even surprised when you married Ginny,” she said, between sobs.
"Okay, Harry. I'll go and watch the boys fly then." Harry was glad to see that the loneliness was no longer in her eyes. She apparently enjoyed her time in Malfoy Manor and Harry was amazed by that. Who would have thought?
leaving their husbands. They are supposed to be out on the street, Knutless  and friendless. If they are left alone, they will return to their husbands  faster. Of course I can't order you to revoke your invitation to Weasley's  wife, since the law doesn't specifically state that you can't take her in,  but I am strongly suggesting." Greer stared into those emerald-green eyes  without blinking and Harry was tempted to give in; however, he couldn't do  that to Hermione.
Harry knew his wife enough to determine that she would not give up. With a sigh, he sat up and looked at her with an annoyed expression.
“Did she tell you why?” he asked, sitting down on the couch, trying to get comfortable on the furniture. It was more like those pieces that were meant to look good, not feel relaxing. Ron glared at the thing, probably wondering why anyone would have it in their living-room. The second-hand furniture in his living room may have been a little ugly and had seen lots of use, but was very comfortable.
"Lily wears the ones for 4-5," Harry informed her with a frown. He would have expected her to know that.
For some reason, in spite of not having been with his wife for months, Harry rather wished she hadn't made the effort.
"But you were both so happy together. Surely, now that you've had a few days without your family, you can see that without them, you are no one." He cringed internally at that part. Malfoy had insisted that Light Wizards regard an unattached woman as a person without aim or meaning. To them, the real purpose of a woman was attending to her husband and children.
"Yes. Look, Ginny, I don't want to complicate this," he began, trying, but failing to keep the pleading from his voice. "I just want this divorce quickly over and done with. You can have the house and the money I wrote on the proposition. All I want is to have custody of the children. It has been me who was with them more. You can just go and maybe live in Thailand."
"Everyone, I have an announcement to make," Harry began. "We're not returning to our house. We discussed it with Draco, and for a while, all four of us are going to live in the Manor."
However, his routine was broken by an owl that he received. It was from Hermione Weasley, who requested a lunch date from him. Since he didn't have any plans, he replied that he accepted her offer.
. Not Harry, the man who is smart, sometimes shy, would walk through fire for his friends and for the right thing. Not the green-eyed boy with messy hair and scruffy trainers." Draco was equally made bolder by the alcohol.
"Put on some really nice robes," Ginny told him as she disappeared into the bathroom. Harry really hoped she wasn't going to take an hour.
"I wanted that so much. I always did. Now that I have you where I want you, I'm going to make sure that you never think about me as your enemy again."
As the Muggle-born witch lead him out through the maze of corridors, he noted how comfortable she looked navigating the passages. They said their goodbyes and the green-eyed man felt comfortable in leaving her in the Manor in a way that he didn't previously.
"I suppose, you are young. I do recommend keeping her on a tighter leash in the future though. Give her another child and then she'll have to stay home. You do want to emulate Mr. Weasley in that, don't you?"
They rested a bit outside, and then walked among some more ruins. Harry got the urge to touch the stones. They had been standing there for millennia, and he had a sense of awe about them.
Harry shook his head at the blunt letter. Malfoy had apparently not changed one bit, but he needed him and the prat knew it. He glanced at his watch and noted that it was only 11am, but he knew how long women needed to get ready, so he went to rouse Hermione all the same. She wasn't hard to wake up, so once her eyes focused on him, he showed her the letter. Her eyes widened and she rushed to the bathroom after grabbing her beaded old beaded purse. Harry could hear clothes falling onto the floor.
She was whining once more and it only served to irritate her husband all the more. She acted as if she were one of the children and Harry was not amused by it.
"Hello, handsome." He fluttered his painted eyelashes in a coy manner. Harry supposed that it wasn't the best come-on, but if someone was as pretty as that boy, he probably didn't need much.
For half the night, he wondered about. He had never been in such a place like Patong. Skimpily-dressed men, women, and some people he was startled to find were somewhere in between, propositioned him at almost every corner, or called him into a club. He did go into some of the clubs, looking for Ginny, but she wasn't in any of them. It was past midnight when Harry was beginning to get really tired. The gaiety around him annoyed him more than cheered him up. He was getting frustrated, but went into just one more club.
"I would like to buy this dragon, but I need it delivered to my home tomorrow morning," he explained.
"We have talked about this over breakfast. I'd just like to have a nice, peaceful lunch now," she said and then took a sip of her water, pretending to hide her nerves behind the glass.
The crowd dispersed then, they no longer had any source of entertainment. Ron was left standing there alone, ignored by everyone.
Ron reached towards his wand, but Draco's hand gripping his arm halted him and the menacing look he accompanied with it took Ron's mind off it completely.
"This party is has been such a drag," the unknown man remarked. "Until you showed up that is." The grin was evident in his voice.
Harry grinned, and Draco took his hand. He was pulled towards a narrow yellow and pink building with four floors. The facade was decorated by beautiful reliefs around the windows and in between them. It looked like a small ancient palace to Harry.
"Okay, the alcohol is hitting you now. You drank so fast; it just caught up to you. Now why don't you quit before you pass out?" Draco tried to reason.
Harry sat at the head of the table having breakfast and looked down at his wife. He had spent more time with her than ever before during their marriage. He had completely quit the Aurors and didn't miss it at all but was busier than ever. Instead of a regular job, he went around the Wizengamot members and courted them, just like Draco told him to. He had become a politician. It wasn't his chosen profession and he sincerely hoped he didn't have to do it all his life. Ginny was always by his side and he didn't even have to ask her. She enjoyed all the gatherings and dinners, which made her the perfect companion for his new job. Harry made sure that the men he meet saw him guide her at all times, asserting his authority. He didn't take pleasure in any of it one bit, but he was getting better at pretending he did.
That strength did help him just two hours later when they broke for lunch. Harry avoided looking at Arthur and towards the audience. However, when they had to leave the chamber he could no longer avoid them, nor the press. There was a rule against reporters jumping on him in the hall, but outside they could do as they wished. He walked out the great doors with Draco, who didn't leave his side even as he was bombarded with questions.
"Ginny, I don't like you calling Hermione a 'whore'," he began. "However, it  would do the kids some good to be with you for a while. So I will let you  take them until this thing between Hermione and Ron is over."
"I know. I'll never forget the time when I found you crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. I ... I'm sorry about that curse. I actually didn't know what it did. It was stupid of me to use it, but that's the first thing that came to my mind and you were going to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me," he explained.
Harry was not ready to try to sort himself out from his awkward position half on the floor and half on the stupidly high bed, so he just stayed quiet.
"Limit?" Harry couldn't understand what the problem was. He had taken money out before, but never heard of a limit.
Said gorgeous person turned around to spot Potter laughing at him. He directed the glare at the green-eyed boy.
He travelled along the path of the dark hair that led all the way into Harry's boxers and when he reached the waistband, he got that off as well with Harry's help. As his aching manhood sprang forth, he couldn't look away from Draco's face hovering over his erection. The blond looked down, then back up, and slowly lowered his lips to encase the tip. He gave it an experimental suck, and Harry almost lost it right there. Draco slowly slid his lips down until Harry's member hit the back of his throat. Then, ever so slowly, he pulled back up, sucking all the way. Harry couldn't believe how good it felt and looked. Draco repeated the process again and again, slowly gaining speed. By the time he had a more satisfying rhythm going, Harry was moaning uncontrollably, and had a hard time keeping his hips from trusting into those pink lips. Draco grasped the base of Harry's cock, and his left hand began to help in providing more friction. Suddenly, he swallowed Harry all the way down and hummed. At that point, the other man couldn't take anymore and came explosively into the waiting mouth, his cries of pleasure reverberating around the room.
When Harry wakes up on a Saturday morning, he feels as if his skull might split open. Voices are coming from the kitchen, and the room is askew. It takes five seconds of groping to find his phone, which turns out to be wedged into the settee.
Sitting side by side, keeping a safe distance from each other, they spend their nights gazing off into nothing in particular together.
To his credit, Malfoy paid no heed to the awkwardness in the air. He rang up the cash register without missing a beat and handed Harry a receipt. “That’ll be eight quid, then. You can collect your order over there.” He gestured towards the back of the room. “Feel free to take a seat while you wait.”
He feels refreshed after splashing his own face with cold water in the bathroom stall- determination takes place of the helpless despair he’d felt earlier.
Unprompted, a mental image popped up: Malfoy, bread crusts in hand, tiptoeing towards a dozing cat. He wondered if Malfoy was the one to name her. The thought shouldn’t have made him want to smile, but it did anyways.
But now that the real waiting had begun, his former discomfort could not compare. Until now, there had always been that last barrier. Now there was nothing in front of him but the conclusion, however it might play out. He had to stop, to close his eyes and fight dizziness.
“Lacerating hex,” Draco said. His hands probed the wound, and more blood oozed forth. His wand waved once and his face twisted. “Not clotting. Fuck.”
“Malfoy.” Harry stepped closer. Malfoy backed up and Harry raised a hand in placation. He reached for Malfoy’s left sleeve.
There was a pop behind Harry and a house-elf came silently around him. With a small bow to both of them, the elf took Luna’s hands and began bandaging her fingertips with thin strips of gauze. Harry watched the nimble fingers wrap the gauze around and around. Luna sang on, intent on the care being given to her hands.
“Is that what I have been doing?” The old man looked thoughtful. “It would hardly be a waste of my time, now would it?”
The war might nullify any chance of Luna getting out of it at all. It wasn’t something Harry wanted to think about. He continued his trek across the battlements, turned a corner around a turret, and found Seamus sitting against a wall with his legs pulled up, staring off into the grey mist. His right hand rested limply across his knees, and his left rose, bringing something to his lips. Harry was momentarily stilled by the sight of a cigarette.
But the stairs were solid stone beneath her shoes, solid enough to clip her toe hard. Her foot blossomed with pain, beautifully fierce and real. She scrambled up the steps, bent over and grabbing at the stones with her fingers. An irrational part of her mind expected spells to erupt behind her just when she reached her sanctuary. She hit the door with both palms and felt thick, rain-hardened wood.
They were dressed in filthy clothing: jeans, a bulbous winter jacket hanging down past the child’s knees, what had once been a dress coat whipping the woman’s thighs. They were both spattered with mud. The child’s eyes stared hugely at Hermione. The woman’s hair sagged under her woolen hat; her face was lined and openly weary. They had no aura that Hermione could sense, and while that meant little nowadays, something instinctive told her they were Muggles.
Theodore nodded, then doubled over and coughed blood into the water. Draco’s hands flew up to hold him just as Theodore toppled into him. “Hemorrhagus,” Theodore muttered. One hand climbed slowly over his belly. He drew a ragged breath and coughed again, and the blood flowed over his chin, turning the puddle crimson.
He yanked Blaise up by the collar of his shirt and shook him. “Blaise, what did you say about a… binding? Did she bind him?”
On 17 December, 1998, a solution preventing the inevitable defeat of the Order of the Phoenix and the existing Wizarding government was at last discovered: a binding spell, ancient, unpredictable, to be performed on the most powerful wizard or witch with the ability to defeat Thomas Marvolo Riddle. It was a spell designed to bind two people together in love, creating enough magic channeled through the chosen vessels to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all. There was no possibility of concealing the spell’s discovery from Riddle’s followers; the infiltration of spies into either side had been an inescapable fact for months. The Order could only do everything in its power to keep the chosen couple safe long enough for the binding to be properly crafted. As the time drew near, the Death Eaters tore the country apart searching for the one who would be bound to the Boy Who Lived, and the one chosen to guide her to his side.
“Thomas Marvolo Riddle is now preparing for three contingencies. None of them include the treasonous son of his oldest follower.”
She wasn’t looking at him. Wasn’t looking at the Death Eaters either. She was staring at the ground, her eyes unfocussed. He opened his mouth, but there was nothing waiting there. So he stared after their departing pursuers instead. He squeezed her fingers against the stone.
He gravitated toward the colour green. First in the razor edge and sibilant silence of a horrific spell, and then in the colour of a person’s—
“Seamus.” The arm he now clutched lay leaden over his ribs. As he watched, Seamus’ body shivered into another slow rasp. Sallow pits hung under his partially closed eyes, and a glint of red dotted the corner of his mouth. Blaise looked down at the damp sheets.
Blaise’s expression washed clean of all strain. “I feel good, Draco. Better than a couple days ago. It’s… It’s about him, do you see? It’s because I have him at all.” He shook his head. “Hard to explain.”
She would do this willingly. She was at the heart of his fondest memories. The thought of her tugged him back to a jumbled kitchen full of delicious smells, a ramshackle home that held laughter, red hair, and the shelter of motherly arms. Ginny was life; she was like all the Weasleys. Her vibrancy stood out to him in the small room, and the sharp cut of the notes Luna sang echoed the fierceness Ginny’s memory evoked. For a moment Harry pictured, and listened.
“I’ll just put this here for now.” Ron’s hand came down decisively to rest on her bare stomach, fingers splayed. His expression was full of sleepy concentration.
She ran a hand over her sodden hair. Tiny curls tangled around her fingers and she yanked her hand away angrily.
“London was always like that.” Harry shifted, straightened up. “What about the Ministry? Still holding up?”
Kingsley’s door was nearly shut and the light was burning inside. Harry was about to knock when a low voice came from the other side of the door.
He lost track of how many times he cried that name into the room. He didn’t hear the door open, except that suddenly Draco Malfoy was at his side, leaning onto the bed and touching the clammy breadth of Seamus’ forehead. Blaise looked up, confused, unable to see anything aside from the shadows pocking Seamus’ face, the widening stains over his own hands. Draco’s hair was askew, eyes still blurry with sleep, and Blaise snatched his hand, yanking it to where the wound was.
Merlin, what would she be when the spell ended? If the spell ended. He pictured Luna unable to speak, a withered wisp of the woman she’d been, every year for the rest of her life. His stomach hurt worse than ever. “Then you know I can’t make them choose the future I have to offer,” Harry whispered.
“What do you want me to do?” It heaved inside of him, the answer he both wanted and didn’t want, and suddenly he couldn’t keep silent. “Choose someone else?”
He was deep in vertigo and sliding further. His body rocked, he felt every thrust, and on a wave of sobriety, terror shot through him. His body didn’t feel like his. He was having sex, but
There was a castle somewhere in this field. Right in front of them, maybe. He had mere yards left of his journey, but for once, the end held no scrap of solace. He’d been able to feel something like joy at the prospect of being safe again, of having reached… what he wanted to reach. But there was no reason for it now, and he should have seen that coming, from the instant he stepped out on this mission. The end had always been the same and he’d fooled himself into thinking it might turn out differently.
