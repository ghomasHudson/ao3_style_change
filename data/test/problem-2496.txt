"Oh gosh, you scared me." Draco said, clutching his chest above his heart, willing his breathing to slow.
“What? Why?” Ron asked, anger within his tone.
“Our friend. Hermione Granger, mentioned to us a possibility of what caused this. A theory of sorts.” he nodded towards Hermione.
“What do you think, love?” Draco asked smiling, stroking the back of Harry’s hand.
“I know.” Harry said.
“No, don’t cry.” Draco laughed, wetly, wiping the tears away as the slowly fell.
Draco approached him cautiously. “Is there anything I can do?”
“You’re my forever, Draco.” Harry said seriously.
How could he be so stupid? Of course Harry didn’t love him, of course he never would. All the time Harry spent with him, that was just the prophecy making him. All those things they said at the end of their honeymoon… it was all a lie. Harry would never voluntarily say those things, especially to Draco. Draco truly loved Harry, that’s probably why he never felt all the pain Harry claimed to feel.
Not only was that very pleasurable for Harry, but Draco enjoyed the writhing sight of the brunet.
Harry’s just tidying up his papers from the day after getting a memo from Kingsley saying that he’s free to go for the evening, when his Omega walks in, looking tired and disgruntled from a long day’s work.
As he felt the familiar pang of hurt return that was always brought on by his parents, a blond head appeared beside his telling him that the food was soon to arrive. Harry paid no attention to Draco, but this didn’t go unnoticed.
“Draco? You haven’t even worked a full day yet.” Harry supplied.
Harry cleared his throat as he tried to remember how to form words, "Well, Minister Shacklebolt, I've known Draco Malfoy for 8 years, and although we've had our differences, and he's made a few mistakes in his past, I can assure you that he isn't a ruthless Death Eater that many accuse him of being. And he certainly doesn't deserve to be thrown in Azkaban." Honestly, no matter how hard he tried, Harry could not figure out where that statement came from, or the great effect it had on the jury.
“Oh, Harry, honey, I want you.” Malfoy said, about to stand to no doubt attach himself to Harry once more.
Draco looked for anything to take his gaze off of the all encompassing green that stared at him so brightly. “Well, yeah, kind of. I’ve, um, never done anything with a-a bloke before. Only a few girls, but nothing huge. I-I don’t know. What about you?”
When the couple had arrived to their honeymoon destination, they both felt the assault of hot and humid air as they stepped off the plane. They both looked around at the beautifully starry sky, and the palm trees that littered every few feet from the short runway they had landed on.
Once there, he placed Draco gently down onto it, and climbed over top of his mate.
“How about this one?” Harry held up a maroon v-neck t-shirt.
To feel the wind
“When Malfoy was hit with the spell and it, what was it, ‘hindered’ his mental state, what does that mean? What would have happened if it was his physical state?” The thought that Harry could have really hurt Malfoy disgusted him. Although he didn’t like the prick, he didn’t want to kill him.
“You don’t say.” Draco replied, grinning up at Harry where he stood beside him. Harry blushed tremendously.
When Harry opened the door, Draco gasped and it sounded like he had dropped a bottle of soap.
He rolled his damn hips, up and hard.
“I haven’t done anything,” Malfoy argued.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ok.” Harry said with a lopsided grin.
Draco stayed quiet for a moment. He didn't trust his voice so he squeezed Harry a little in response. He really didn't want to let go.
Are the point of views confusing because I feel like I jumble them up sometimes?
“Oh. I didn’t know.”
“Yes, professors?” He asked, no tone to his voice. He really didn’t want to make the situation worse by being snide.
Draco fell asleep immediately afterwards, not wanting to embarrass himself or Harry anymore.
“Why don’t you use magic anymore?” The question broke Draco’s concentration and he shot up to look at Harry.
“Malfoy-” Harry began, leaning into his personal space.
Draco was stunned for a long while before he asked in a whisper “Why did you do that?”
Their relationship is going to be starting soon.
“Just a sec.” His face was still scrunched up, although not as much.
Harry shook his head stubbornly.
“A normal person doesn't act that way, Potter, even if they are slightly intoxicated. You have to truly have bad intentions when sober to act the way you do when you’re drunk. Drunk behaviour is based on sober intentions. Regardless, the way you handled me that night was not appreciated in the slightest. If you’re here to make up for it, I’m sorry to say but you can’t. I have better things to take up my time than your intemperate behaviours. Goodbye now, Potter. I hope you get help.”  Draco says as he makes his exit back into his shop, however he’s stopped short when Potter speaks up.
Weasley was frowning at his paperwork that he seemed to return to after their conversation ended.
This shocked Harry, but clearly Draco needed this (and so did he, if he was being honest), so he said fuck it. He grabbed the blond’s hips and repeated his motion from before, over and over and over.
Ron nods in agreement. “No, he didn’t. He definitely would’ve told us.”
"Well, I guess that explains some of our initial... randiness in the beginning, during our honeymoon... but, we had a few fights, and I'd left temporarily a few times to go for a walk and Harry for a swim. How come we didn't feel pain then, when we were separated?" Draco inquired.
“Anyways, I hadn’t realized he’d cast it until I had already met you at the bar. By then it was too late, and it hadn’t worn out until an hour after you’d left. It was bad and a low blow on their part. I gave them hell for it this past week, especially Seamus. Trust me, it wasn’t how I intended the evening to go. Yeah, I was feeling all of those things, but they were enhanced and I wouldn’t have actually acted upon any of them in real circumstances. I understand if you hate me for embarrassing you like that, and if you don’t want to see me again. Originally I was just going to leave you be, but you deserved to know the truth about the whole thing. If you don’t believe me, I can show you memories or you can use veritaserum, I wouldn’t mind.”
Harry pushed Ron off the sofa.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Get over here.” He said, in a voice so much unlike his own.
“You’re dirty, you know that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you want with Harry? And why is your hair pink?” He interrogated.
“You’re killing me Potter.” Draco ground out.
Three...Hogwarts
“Sorry Professor.” Harry said.
Draco felt his eyes burn and saw his vision cloud up before he threw his head into the pillow, and sobbed, wondering when he became such a sensitive sap.
Any colour, any time.
“Harry, stop. I don’t want to do this right now.” Draco said seriously. “I told you I don’t want this to be what our relationship is based on.”
He stood under the water for a few minutes, not making any moves to clean himself. The cool water was relaxing his irritated body.
He started loosening his tie once he landed on the boardwalk, when Harry appeared behind him.
Draco was expecting it, seeing as Harry had just brought it up in the kitchen. He took in a deep breath, bit his lip, and nodded. “Yes.” He whispered. He looked up to see Harry’s lips pursed in a thoughtful way, but continued before he could respond. “But how did you know?”
“Draco,” Harry sighed, clearly put-off, but not by what he said, but rather how Draco was acting.
His negative train of thought was interrupted by a knock.
“I think I’m going to go for a run.” Draco said suddenly. He got out of bed and dressed quickly, seeing as he was still naked. He was just about to walk out when Harry cleared his throat.
"I'm fine, and Kingsley wanted to discuss something after. Draco's been cleared of all charges, and he's out free. Also," he turned to where the blond stood behind him, watching the three friends converse. "he's going to be staying with me for a while." He turned back to his friends to gauge their reactions with a smile on his face. They then seemed to notice that he stood behind Harry.
A soft chuckle came from Kingsley as he replied "You're very welcome Draco."
“Oh, Malfoy! I heard about your place and thought I’d stop in.” Potter greeted with a comfortable handshake. Hmm. Memorable.
Snape sighed heavily at this point, almost put off by what he was going to say next. “...talented wizard you are, leaves me to believe you had some say in why. Why the curse had altered it’s path of choice, that of which it was created to do. That’s for one thing. The next, you didn’t seem aggressively against the thought of having to watch over Mr Malfoy, as well as move into his private rooms with him, and share all classes with. Also,” Snape seemed to get heated more and more as he continued to talk.
He quickly showered, dressed and made his way down to the kitchen where he saw the elegant blond sitting and eating his breakfast while reading 'The Daily Prophet'.
“Hi.” He said softly.
Harry breathed for a minute before he answered “This.”
Draco rolled over once more and shut his eyes, wondering when the next time they’d sleep together in the same bed would be.
“Yes yes, well, I have Abraham coming to meet you to introduce you to the job and take you along your future route.” She said.
Harry took a walk around the rooms, ultimately deciding that even if they did have a fair sized sitting room, a massive bathroom with an equally massive tub, and a bedroom that was bigger than the one he shared with the boys, there would never be enough space to distance himself away from the blond. He was stuck living with him in these dark and dreary quarters, all because of an accidental spell malfunction.
"What about you?"
“Mr Potter, if there is a problem, take it outside.” Snape seethed.
“I didn't expect you to… This is a lot. Thank you, for this.” Harry smiled, staring at the Omega as he ran his fingers over his old wand, getting a feel for its magic once again. “Can I ask you for a favour?” Harry nodded for him to continue. “Well, um, I thought that we could maybe go shopping today. So I can get some clothes since I don’t have any, and I don’t want to keep taking yours from you.” Draco bit his lip and started playing with the hem of his shirt, and Harry realized that he hadn't given him anymore clothes to wear. All he had was the pyjamas he was currently wearing.
Draco squawked. “I am not!” He said, beyond insulted that Harry would say such a thing about such a proud Slytherin.
“A minute. Just give...me...a minute.” Harry said with a scrunched face.
“That won’t be necessary, Ms Granger,” Snape said roughly, before billowing out of the room, and towards what Hermione could only guess was their common room. McGonagall followed suit. Hermione sent a patronus anyways, alerting Harry that an angry Snape was on his way.
"Good morning. I made some breakfast on the stove for you." Draco said, not bothering to look up from the paper.
Harry grinned broadly. At least that was taken care of.
Draco covered his face with both hands, trying hard not to sob. Harry pulled his hands away and gazed up so fondly at him.
The next moment Draco was alone. He sat back down and waited for this Abraham to come and help him with this job he wasn’t excited for in the slightest.
The Omega was drooling before he realized what he was doing. Quickly wiping the back of his hand on his lips, he stood and moved to the dresser to change. He could see Harry in the bathroom mirror, fiddling with some kind of potion flask that Draco didn’t know what it was for. Shuffling towards the bathroom, a question on his lips, Draco abruptly stopped as Harry shut the door. He didn’t even see Harry looking back at him.
Draco was grossed out by the man’s behaviour, sure, but he didn’t think he should die because of it, let alone from Harry who was bound to make it a miserable death, seeing how hard he was squeezing.
Draco knew, however. When he went to inform his newlywed, he discovered how the two had been smiling and laughing so casually, but with an intensity that Draco knew didn’t exists between him and his groom. He stopped in his tracks and felt his heart ache with a terrible pain. He wondered if he would ever have that type of relationship with Harry. He really hoped he would, too.
“Nothing.” He said.
“I love your arse, baby, it’s so round and smooth. I could play with it all day.” Smack!
Malfoy drew back for a second, wand in hand, then launched himself forward, the unforgivable on his lips.
“Mr Malfoy, please.” He drawled. “Your behaviour, while inhibited, is seriously improper. Were your father to see you now…” He trailed off, looking at the blond with a mild look of disapproval.
“Nicknames. But yeah. As long as we’re together, no one gets to oggle you but me.” Potter grabbed his bum possessively.
Draco shrugged. “It’s not that. My new wand doesn't work for me the same way my old one did. I don't like to use it much.” He replied quietly.
But Harry didn’t feel the same, apparently. He just kept shooting him down whenever he wanted to talk or discuss serious matters.
He sits on the couch and I sit in an armchair. We sit in silence for a few minutes.
“I am so happy for you Draco!” She said, reaching across the couch to hug her best friend tightly. “You finally got with him! The man of your dreams.” She said in a sing-song voice. “I am a little hurt that you’d think I’d want to ruin this for you. I would never do such a thing.”
Harry just smiled at him. “Like I said, Draco. You’ve changed. And, I've been happier with you here than I have been in a long time…” He took a breath and wondered what he was doing. Hermione was going to kill him. “I’d really like to get to know you, Draco.”
"Ok..."
Harry sighed and turned back to the front of the class. Malfoy climbed back onto his stool and kept his head down, twiddling with his fingers.
As Harry sunk down into the steaming water mixed with a muscle relaxant (he was getting too stiff, dealing with Draco and his totally unpredictable moods), he moaned lightly at the soothing sensation. Dealing with Draco was like taking care of a petulant child. His head was throbbing, his muscles aching, and his magic thrumming. He felt off kilter, all of his senses, magical and non, telling him different things. And then there was all the issues Draco seemed to want to cause, stressing Harry out even more. What happened to the beautiful, haughty, Slytherin Omega Harry took into his home all those weeks ago? He really liked Draco, but man, the things the boy springs on him, plus his mood swings?! Harry can’t control him on his own.
“You could’ve worn your underwear, you know.” Draco said as he cut into his salmon.
Harry wanted to jump up and down he was so excited. But he didn't, he just ginned widely and turned back to Kingsley. The Minister nodded and had the aurors usher them out of the courtroom, passed Hermione and Ron in the hall, who shot confused glances at Harry, who just shrugged, and into his office a little ways down the hall.
“This isn’t something that just came out of the blue, but yes. I want to take you out on dates, Draco. I want to show you off to the world and spend quality time with you, and do fun, exciting things with you, always. I think it’ll help let off some steam instead of being cooped up in here all the time.”
“Good morning gorgeous.” Harry smiled, moving closer to kiss Draco awake.
“Harry-” Hermione said, grabbing his attention. She nodded towards the Great Hall doors, where one (fully dressed, thank Merlin) Malfoy came sauntering in. As he approached the Gryffindor table, he perched himself right beside Harry and laid a wet kiss upon his cheek.
“I don’t deserve you.” I respond.
“Babe?” he called.
He sighed and walked over to the cabinet where he was previously told he could place his things for the duration of his shift. There were 8 doors, separating the cabinet into 8 cubbies. 5 had names glowing on the front of them, 3 without. Paying no heed to the names, he assumed those were taken by the workers behind him so he took an empty one. He traced his name on the front of the small door with his wand, and as expected, his name appeared engraved in the wood, then glowed softly with a golden hue, just as the rest of them.
“She said you two will always feel pain, even years to come possibly?” Hermione interrupted.
“If you did then you wouldn’t want to wait. How come I don’t want to wait?”
Draco looks deeply at him, still stumped as to why he had this accident. Harry pulled him out of his revier. “Do you know when we’ll be able to head home? We haven’t spent a night at home yet.”
Draco made an offended sound before saying “Malfoy’s do not get sick, Potter.”
Malfoy merely winked with a smirk.
“How much I’d like to kiss you right now.” Harry replied quietly.
Potter stood there, head down in a shameful manner. “I know I acted inappropriately last week. I came to apologize for what I did. I’d had a few drinks prior to meeting you, and I got carried away-”
The fluff is strong with this one. And it's super long.
“So, Draco, why a hair salon?”
Draco smiled big at Harry. “Of course I will, you big buffoon .”
Draco took another deep breath and answered “Well, I read a little about it from what I could find in the library. With you being an Alpha and me an Omega - and you can smell me, does that - does that mean we're mates?”
It had been a little over a month since Draco and Harry realized that they were mates. They were happier than they had been in a long time. When they thought about it, it was kind of odd how they got together, and a little rushed. Not knowing much about each other, they spent most of their time together, slowly learning more about each other and their newfound love.
Harry paused “What?”
“About us, you know, sexually.”
Draco smiled too, kissed him one more time, and left the bathroom so Harry could finish his bath.
“Mmm, a bath sounds nice.” Draco said, leaning in to kiss Harry softly.
He heard more than saw Malfoy crying- no, sobbing, more like- in the bathroom. Harry followed him here, after seeing him enter and exit the great hall so fast when he saw Harry talking with Katie Bell.
Well, he kind of listened. Sure, Harry went down to the kitchen and found Draco there. Sure, he stayed and they talked a little and threw brownie batter at each other. And yes, Harry admitted the one thing that he couldn’t get out of his head, but Draco kissed him. And yeah he returned the kiss, but Draco made the first move...then he left. Again.
“Like?” Harry prompted.
“That’s a fair point, Ron.” Hermione agreed. “You can ask Kingsley if there are any openings at the Ministry, maybe in the DMLE or in one of his offices. It might be good for you to have something else to do, besides focus on Draco. He is a grown man and can take care of himself. You need to focus on yourself now, Harry.”
Draco did sob, then. He cried and cried as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and held him for a long time. They cried on each others shoulders, and held each other for all that it was worth.
But if he said yes, it was another thing for him to think and possibly worry about. It was another step in their relationship, and he just wanted to enjoy now with Draco.
I’m standing here, soaking wet from the thunderstorm, drunk out of my mind and so smoked up, I left a trail of fog behind me when I walked.
“What do you mean? You’ve been sick, Hermione. You need help.” he returned to her side so he could support her.
Draco nodded. “That sounds great. I’ll return to him then and wait upon her arrival.”
“You’re welcome, Potty.”
“Oh, no, no. I won’t tell them that, ever. That’s our secret.” He leaned forward and kissed Draco’s nose. “As for the ‘act before I think’ part, I’ve done a lot of thinking about us. This is it. This is what I want. You’re my mate, Draco.” Harry said quietly, rubbing his hands up and down Draco’s arms. The blond fell into Harry and he just held on tightly, never wanting to let him go.
“Oh, no! That’s not what I meant. It’s just, when you think about it, it’s a wonder how we’ve been able to look past all of it and find each other.”
Once inside, he turned on the light and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He was paler than usual with blood red cheeks. His blond hair stuck to his forehead in a sweaty mess, and his shirt clung to him in a similar way. He closed his eyes and sighed before stripping and turning the shower on cold. He stepped under the steady stream and shivered under the intense temperature change.
“Perfect.” Draco responded. “Come and join me! There’s room for both of us.”
They had arrived by private chauffeur at the small and expensive restaurant just in time for their prepaid reservation. They had ordered and waited for their food in silence. This is the first time either of them spoke since back at the resort.
Harry breathed a deep breath, tightened his hold on Draco, and kissed him full and hard on the mouth. A passionate and sexy kiss.
Harry sighed, squeezed hard one last time before he let go, letting the man drop to the floor, crumpling in on himself with coughs and gasping breaths.
“And? That’s a good thing I hope.” Harry chuckled nervously.
“Uhh, yeah. I guess. I’m going to say bye to everyone first.” And that he did. He took his time, wishing everyone goodbye, while they all wished him the best of luck.
“You were right outside, I wasn’t going anywhere.”
Draco helped Hermione clean up and drink some water before they went to join their boys.
Draco looked up and saw a Harry's worried expression. “Oh, no. I - I want to be with you, there's no doubt about that. It's just, I'd like a label for this. Not just mates, you know, if that makes sense.”
“But I know you’re enjoying it.” Malfoy said, rubbing his hand along the inseam of Harry’s leg. “And all the things I’d do to you with my mouth...why would you ever want it spelled shut?” He asked, peering up at Harry through lidded lashes.
So yes, he cried. Sobbed, in fact. Tear after hot tear burned his reddened cheeks has he stood in the tiny loo, on the way to their honeymoon destination. He didn’t leave the bathroom for another twenty minutes, until once he decided he needed to stop crying, lest he die from dehydration.
Harry turned to him and smiled. It calmed him somewhat. “This won’t take long, and neither should yours. If you need me, tap on this coin with your wand and we’ll come find you.” Harry said, handing Draco a large gold galleon.
“Draco, it wasn’t meant like that. It was just a suggestion for me to get out everyday and do something. If you’re interested, I’m sure I can get you a job, too. Maybe we can both work closely under the Minister. Doesn’t it get boring being here all day, everyday?” Harry had moved around the desk, and knelt down in front of Draco in his chair. He grabbed both his hands and kissed them gently.
Draco hadn’t realized when he started biting his lip or palming the front of his shorts.
Hermione wasn’t shocked by Harry’s outburst. He’d been like this all morning. At least he showed an emotion besides a mind-numbing expressionless mood that seemed to haunt everyone around him for the past month.
It’s not like he even wanted to leave Harry. Obviously he loved the dramatic Gryffindor, but who wants to be married to someone who practically hates you--
“This is huge! We have to celebrate.” Draco said, climbing off of Harry and getting dressed.
“What was that for?” Draco asked.
“How could I not?” Harry replied with a wary smile.
Draco continues his assault of teeth and tongue until he reaches his beloved’s cock. In one swift swoop, he swallows him whole, causing Harry to buck up. Still, the brunet doesn’t make a sound, save for a few gasps.
“Ok, do you need help with those?” He asked, addressing their passports, plane tickets and other travel information that Draco was collecting from the table he had organized them on.
“My arse fucking hurts from your big wolf dick, you fucker.” Although Draco meant it, there was no real bite to the statement.
“I have to move into Malfoy’s room,”
Draco walked over to the cupboard and pulled out two mugs before filling them and handing one to Harry. He sat down at the table and blew in his tea before carefully taking a sip.
“I’m gonna fuck you so good.” Draco said, lining himself up with Harry’s slick hole.
He kissed all down the tanned skin, licking around the tight nipples and biting lovingly into the soft hips beneath him. Harry exchanged his soft chuckles for moaning Draco’s name repetitively.
“Cause all you ever do is make me cry.” We say together.
"That took a lot longer than I thought it would."
“I’m sorry.” He whispered.
Harry was frustrated. He’d done the interview for The Daily Prophet a month before, and they were still getting news articles with their relationship plastered on the front page. He’d tried to tell them that they had gotten over their history and overcome their differences, and that they were happy. But no one wants happy. They only want lies to feed their gossip.
“Or... we can stay here all day.” Malfoy offered, following him much like a predator hunting his prey.
“Oh, great. I’m married to a bookworm.” Harry rolled his eyes and slumped forward onto his elbow.
Draco broke through Harry’s train of thought. “We don’t have to. I’m sorry I asked.” He sounded broken, it hurt Harry’s heart.
Harry took his hand and the two of them walked to the cab, which was the start of their trip home; the next chapter.
“Oh Merlin, calm down! We're fine. I just want to talk to you about something, about us… intimately.” Draco's gaze slowly left Harry's, as he suddenly found a loose thread on his pillow very interesting. He knew they would have to get intimate for when they’re bonded and want to mate, and he knew, being the Omega, that it would be him carrying their children. That really made him nervous.
“I’m going to fuck you now, Harry.”
Draco stood and gathered his empty plate and coffee mug and put them to wash in the sink. Harry stared at him with incredulous look.
“Harry?” It was Hermione. He let out a sigh of relief. “Are you in here?”
Harry's day just keeps getting better and better. "Yes, please, take it." He said before starting his way down the stairs. "I'm going to go get started on dinner. Any requests?" He asked peering up at the blond.
“Well? What are you waiting for?” Malfoy asked when Harry made no move to enter.
“Holy fuck, Dray. You are fucking gorgeous.” Harry said, spreading Draco open and promptly licking from his tip to his tailbone.
Harry chuckled softly, untying the letter off of the owls leg and reading it silently.
“The particular strand of spell you cast affected his mental state, because of its weakened state in that moment. The magic associated with the type of spell ‘feeds’ off of whatever is affected the most during that moment, hindering it and damaging it.” Madame Pomfrey explained what Snape had told her. They all found out that it was his spell, because he aided in the medi-witches attempts to help the young Malfoy.
Harry sighed and said “I know this is hard for you, and it’s confusing and totally messed up, but I want to be there for you. I want to help you, let me help you.”
Healer Marigold had left momentarily to retrieve the necessary potions Drcao knew he’d have to fight Harry into taking, the stubborn Gryffindor he was.
Draco regarded him for a moment and twiddled his fingers in front of himself, posing in a very seductive way. And if he bit his lip too, that was his own business.
Harry, oh the ever oblivious one, didn't see the looks Draco was throwing his way.
Harry opened the door and came out of the bathroom then, his towel wrapped around his waist, showing off his muscular back and lean chest.
“HAHAHA, are you serious?” Draco said. Harry looked at him with a raised brow. “You actually want to be with me?” He scolded himself for sounding so pathetic.
“I’d never leave you.”
“Because I’m trying to take notes and you’re distracting me.”
Harry grinned. “Not when we’re married.”
“No, Malfoy. You won’t. You will stay in those, and I will sleep on the other far end. You are not molesting me in my sleep. Got it?”
Draco took a deep breath and ran a shaking hand through his hair. "I'm fine. I was going to tell you that - that I kind of like it in here. I had Kreacher tidy it up a bit, I hope that's ok. I don't have to be in here. I can find somewhere else to-" his rambling was cut short as Harry continued walking towards him and gently grasped Draco's hand in his.
Harry nodded. “What should I wear?”
“I noticed you left your clothes down in the basement by the washer the other day. I know you aren’t familiar with muggle technology, but you could've just as easily used magic. Is there a reason why you don’t want to?”
“Ok, mate, I’m happy for you, but I don’t want to hear about how great Draco ‘fits in’, ok? That’s a little too much.”
Draco shook his head and gestured to the bags. “I should put these away. You go and talk with her.” Harry smiled and nodded. The two of them walked into the kitchen, leaving Draco to haul the bags upstairs.
He eventually moved towards Harry, wanting to tease but not upset, or Merlin forbid enrage. The amount of energy that surged through the room could have well enough been the energy used when he got mad. No, Draco didn’t want that.
When he finally returned home, Draco stood in the entryway, arms crossed, foot tapping and a look of disapproval upon his face.
So he got up and walked out.
So until he found that type of love, Draco Malfoy continued to run his business with the superiority of a Malfoy, but with the kindness and love that took him so long to grow into.
Harry closed his eyes and curled up against Draco. He quickly fell asleep again, missing the words the blond said “You’re not going to make this easy, are you?”
“I don’t know what I’m going to do, Dray. What if I do have to take the potion everyday because the pain gets to be too much?”
He picked him up and led them to the couch, where he sat and proceeded to kiss the smaller man until they were good and breathless.
And to make it worse, he brought the unmated, newly manifested Omega into his home. It's like putting a chocolate bar in front of a kid and telling them not to eat it.
“Oh-” Draco was cut off by an owl pecking at the window.
Harry smiled at the use of his last name, and shrugged again. “It didn’t feel right with her. It’s only ever felt right with one person.”
“Oh, I’m going to do much more than that baby.” Harry responded, peeling the panties off of Draco’s arse cheeks. “I’m going to fuck you so hard, you’ll end up fucking pregnant with our pups.” Draco groaned, his head falling forward to hit the desk. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Milk leaking out of your tits, your belly bulging with three or four pups? You’re my Omega, Draco. My fucking mate.” Harry spelled Draco’s arse open and lubed up while he spoke.
Harry bent down as Draco lifted up, their lips meeting in a soft, greeting manner. Harry’s hands were roaming over the shirtless Draco, as Draco’s hands finished with Harry’s pants.
“Well for one, that we actually sit and talk about what is bothering us, instead of just flying off the broom handle.” Draco rolled his eyes at that. “And for another, that we partake in a weekly date night.” Harry said with a beaming smile.
“No! Where’s Harry, where did he go? Harry! Harry! I need you, Harry!”
And with that, he ended the Floo call and turned back to his desk.
Let me know what you guys think!
“- then they’re gonna ask personal questions, which you should be able to handle, they shouldn’t be too hard. They know to avoid things like financial details, but you know those hungry vultures.”
“Fuck that is so fucking hot.” Harry said, slowly thrusting into Draco.
“Get out of my shower please.” Harry said, frustrated, and trying to cover his bits.
Before he could though, Harry’s hands grabbed his arms and held him in place.
“Bond with me.” Draco grabbed Harry’s arms and ran his thumbs over his broad knuckles.
“It is a very big possibility. I, actually, had come up with a similar theory as to why. That is why I came to speak with you two.” she gestured to the men.
Draco nodded. He was constantly being told they dealt with memos too. Weird fucking system, this was. “Why not send all the mail through Ministry halls.”
“Oh. Well that’s good. You guys certainly don’t need all that bullshit.”
Draco smiled sheepishly.
A few minutes later, he went to step out and dry off before he heard Harry's telltale footsteps making their way to the bathroom.
"When did you attend your honeymoon?" Walkins asked.
“Don’t walk away from me! I don’t know what your problem is, but you’re being unfair.” He paused and released a breath. “I thought we were having a nice time in there.” He said less viciously.
UPDATE: this chapter has been updated!
“Gin. Oh you don’t know how happy I am to see you.” He hugged her immediately, trying to pull some comfort out of the touch. They had officially broken up after they graduated, with Harry having to bond to Draco Malfoy and Ginny realizing she liked Luna much more than ‘just friends’. Now, Ginny and Luna were attending Harry’s worst nightmare together, and Harry was secretly still panicking.
Draco slowly makes his way down the stairs, realizing that the Alpha is in some sort of daze and hasn’t made eye contact with him since Draco had come within his sight. Draco walked right in front of him, put both hands on his cheeks and looked deep into Harry’s eyes, trying to bring the raven back to his senses.
“My place.” Potter said dismissively.
Draco regarded Harry, wondering if he was actually serious. “Date night?” Draco questioned, and Harry nodded.
“Draco, honey, could you bring me the letter that just flew in?” Harry asks, bent over his desk, likely reviewing some notes from Kingsley or one of his associates.
“Woh woh woh, Draco.” The blond looked up at him expectantly, his hands still threading through the string.
Harry sighed and rubbed his temples. He’d been dreading this day for weeks; ever since he’d heard what he’d have to do. He’d considered running away, hiding from everybody and everything, somewhere no one would find him. But of course, he couldn’t do that. Not to all those that had helped him: the Weasleys, who made him apart of their family, Hermione who constantly helped him in school and was always such a big supporter of his, and all those parental figures that took on such big roles in his life, ones that were never quite filled by those he needed most.
“Well, no. Not directly.” Draco sighed unintentionally. “You mentioned how it can inflict pain? Well that’s how it can indirectly affect you emotionally. At least, that’s how your specific prophecy’s magic works. It’s different for every one. Some will cause feelings of relief, some will cause an increase in libido, some will cause pain, and so on. It can’t, however, change your emotions; the way you act to those direct physical feelings is how it indirectly affects your emotions and such.
“I know. I lost control back there, and I really shouldn’t have. You’re still fragile, clearly, and it was my mistake to let go of my composure. I’m sorry if I hurt you.” Harry said sincerely.
He moved to pull the blankets back again, but heard a muffled “If you plan on keeping your hands attached to your body, I suggest you remove them from the blankets.”
“Just deciding if I should leave you out here.” Harry lied, he really didn’t want to live with Malfoy.
“Yes, but-” Harry began
“We’re what?”
“Fucking claim me this time, you bastard.” Draco said.
Draco entered then, eyes downcast, lips slightly tipped in a frown.
He winced. “Must you know?”
“Wanna play?” Harry asked, watching him from where he sat.
Draco smiled softly at him. Harry, being entranced by his beauty, tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. “Merlin….” He said almost inaudibly.
He rolled Draco over, wiping the tears from his face, kissing and healing him all over. He wrapped the smaller man in his arms again, caressing his body and whispering reassuring words into his hair.
“I never hated you more than I needed you.” He whispers.
“Anyways,” Hermione cleared her throat. “Never fret, I won’t tell anyone. However, it does apply to what you were doing, along with what you said, when you said it and had your accident.
“Truth is, I’ve never had a real relationship. One with true feelings. I’m still trying to figure things out and I’m very confused because I feel things but I don’t know what they are. I don’t know what anything means, but I do know that you’re not as bad as I thought. You’re actually pretty great. And it took that argument to make me realize that. And that, possibly, maybe, I might..like you. I mean, we’re married now and we’re stuck together. But, now I’m not so averse to the thought. I guess, I don't know why or how, but I like being here, with you. It’s just going to take me awhile to give you every bit of me, because I don’t know how to do that. But I’ll learn. I’ll try.”
So, Draco started wandering around the house he so vaguely remembered from when he was young. He found his way to the second floor where he could hear muffled voices coming from one of the two double-doored rooms on the floor. He thought about going to his room and maybe taking a nap, but his curiosity got the better of him. Excitement filled him like a little child on Christmas morning as he tiptoed past Harry's study, over to what he was told was the library. He expected it to be locked, the way that Harry didn't seem to want to show it to him earlier. He gently grabbed the handle and turned it-
“Really?” Harry sounded surprised.
“You know how we went to Mungo’s a few days ago?” Draco nodded. “And you know how you were worried about me loving you? Like, you didn’t believe I actually could?” Draco looked away, but nodded again. “Why? Why didn’t you believe I could’ve loved you without it being proved to you that it was actually me having those feelings for you?” Harry didn’t sound patronizing or angry, just inquisitive.
He stood at the end of the aisle, hair combed and hanging loose around his face, dressed in an immaculately designed suit, similar to Harry’s, talking to a woman Harry recognized as his mother.
“That’s good. What’re you guys talking about?” he asked, slinging an arm around Draco as he sat on the edge of the bed beside him. Hermione returned to one of the bedside chairs.
“No, Harry, don’t drown him. Keep him in an Incarcerous until he can keep his hands to himself.” She replied.
“Oh my god, Dray. It’s so good. I love you so much.”
Harry was right, of course, as Draco could feel his back arching uncomfortably and his wrists stinging with the force of Harry’s grip.
Draco sighed, trying to think of a quick comeback that didn’t remain untrue but that didn’t reveal anything either, before he was saved by strong arms wrapping around his shoulders, making him jump.
Harry’s eyes widened comically. “What? No! I can’t.”
“So, gentleman, you’re here to ask some questions, I heard. I’m more than happy to help. Ask away.” she said, interlacing her hands atop her desk.
Harry stared up at the Minister as he spoke, not daring to look at Draco, in fear of the expression that covered his face.
“Don’t leave me,” Malfoy’s grip tightened. Harry sighed.
“Hi.” Harry whispered against the pale lips.
Draco was left standing alone, once again. He took a deep breath, picked up the book he dropped and put it back on the shelf. He walked to the doors, switched off the light, and crept back to his room.
Harry furrowed his brows in confusion, putting the glasses on the table. "You can tell me Draco."
After what seemed like an hour, Madame Pomfrey beckoned them over. “He will be ok, but we need to speak with Mr Potter. Do you know where he is?”
Draco paused and looked deeply into the green eyes. “You have. In ways you’ll never know.” He whispered.
"Um, nothing, really. Just Ministry stuff. Aurors, and whatnot." Draco explained, taking a sip of his tea. "Although," he paused to look over at Harry "there is this one article about the recent Quidditch match, if you'd like to read it. I'm done anyways." He said, turning the paper to face Harry. He got up to put his dishes in the sink but Harry stopped him with a hand in the air, seeing as his mouth was full of food.
Draco went back to biting his lip and nodded. “I think so, but, how are we sure?”
He once again decided to try reading a little bit before he shut his eyes, but, of course, that failed too. So he turned off his light, rolled over, shut his eyes and hoped for sleep to take him quickly.
“Well, we were wondering if you knew anything about how prophecies affect your emotions, because we are concerned it’s happening with us.” Draco said, regarding Hermione.
His eyes widened as he replied with a simple “Hi.”
Harry gulped. “N-no, we should go.” He fled to the bedroom to get dressed. He just hoped that the blond would leave him be.
“Don’t leave me!” Malfoy cried. He was actually crying, tears running down his face.
“Naturally,” they all chimed in.
Six…Treacle Tart
“You may sit over in the waiting area, gentleman.” Sarah informs, the smile no longer visible. She must’ve heard Draco’s comment about the memo distributors being owls.
“I remember.” They kissed again.
Draco just wanted to bond with Harry. He would never regret it, as Harry told him he might. Harry was the only being Draco had ever wanted. Harry was his Alpha.
“Nope.” Harry deadpanned. The look on Malfoy’s face was priceless. “I’m kidding. Let’s go, Malfoy.”
“You know what I’m talking about Harry. His past, your past. There is a lot of history there.”
“Yes?” Harry questioned, turning his face to peek at the blond.
“Outside my classroom this morning, you were fine with, some would say wanted, Malfoy to stay with you during these two periods. So, you had somehow managed to cause a curse to inflict a totally different part of another wizard, than what it was intended for. Then you proceed to be left with said wizard after the damage you had done, then proceed, again, to want the wizard to stay with you, to not be taken from your space. Tell me Potter, tell me, why? Why do all these things add up to the fact that you could have just taken an unsuspecting wizard and turned him into your little… play thing? Why, Potter?”
“In here, you mean?” Draco nodded. “All the other bedroom doors were open.” Harry smiled and kissed his reddening cheeks, before dragging them both to the kitchen.
Weasley, breathing heavily from shock and a possible short circuit in his brain, stood abruptly and announced he was going to grab some tea, even though his mug was quite full, and fled quickly out of the aisle.
“Do you know if they have Disney movies on? I’d love to watch ‘The Lion King’.” Harry asked.
Malfoy hummed.
Draco had finally convinced Harry to go in the more expensive and posh looking stores after finding nothing in Harry's regular department stores. He wasn't worried about the money, being rich helps, he just didn't want to deal with the kind of people that shopped in the expensive and posh looking stores. When they apparated onto the front step outside, they saw the door was unlocked. Immediately, they pulled out their wands and shared a look before they crept inside.
Draco sits puzzled, once again, as he comes up with no answers as to why Harry was taken away from him.
“Are we… just fucking?” Draco asked, feeling his chest squeeze painfully at the thought.
Harry didn’t mind. Aside from his previous years in Hogwarts, he was actually passing Potions for once. Without the distraction of Hermione and Ron (who were currently in Transfiguration; they had a single class of Potions after Harry), as well as Snape’s tendency to ignore him so far this year, he remained quiet and attentive throughout the lessons. Any time they were making Potions in class, he’d pair up with a small, shy Ravenclaw; Milly, he believed her name was. She was good at Potions, and they always passed or did better than a pass during their partnership.
“-with middle-class working plebeian employees that have nothing better to do than gossip over coffee and tea breaks, talking about who just gave the latest blowjob in the men’s bathroom to receive ‘employee of the month’. I know, you told me this morning over breakfast. Just, try to be nice.” Harry pleaded.
“Oh yeah? You should try it sometime!”
“Only you would consider being an owl a fun job, Harry.” Draco mumbled. Harry pinched his side lightly, which Draco was able to fake as a shift in his body weight, the smile never leaving Harry’s face.
“Yeah, but there’s really nothing we can do about it, is there?” Draco said.
Harry's brows furrowed. “But?”
He remained calm, and it worked, helping Draco to relax in his arms. “Really? Only kissing with the Weaselette? Thought you would’ve done a little more than that, Potter.” Draco jibbed, trying to mask his worries.
“Harry…” he said in a deep whisper, voice rumbling from within his chest. It worked as Harry seemed to fall out of his stupor and refocus on the pale face in front of his. “There he is.” Draco said with a small smile. “Welcome back.”
Draco leaned up to kiss him softly. Harry groaned at the loss when he pulled back.
Draco emerged from their bedroom, ready to join Harry and his friends downstairs, when he walked past the bathroom door, slightly ajar. He assumed he’d left the light on by accident, so he went to shut it off, but found Hermione curled in front of the toilet.
Draco froze. Harry would never forgive him if he actually told Harry that he liked him. No. He would never.
“I am not!” Harry laughed. “Come here, you oaf.” and with that, he kissed him till they both were breathless and hungry.
Then came the Prophecy. It was like his biggest dream coming true, only to find out that it was Harry’s biggest nightmare.
Harry sucked his cock down deep, just as he was told to do, gripping Draco’s arse in the meantime to shove the man further down his throat.
Harry’s back started complaining with the position he’d been in for a while. He vaguely remembered he had a bed, and decided that would be the more ideal place to finish this. Before he’d even pulled away from Draco lips, he scooped him up and carried him, thin legs wrapped tightly around his waist, all the way up to their bedroom.
Harry hummed happily. “What are we?” Draco nodded. “Whatever you'd like us to be. I just want to be with you.”
But, why did he leave? He always leaves.
Draco read and Harry responded to whatever letter was sent to him. After sending it off again, he sat back and stared at the blond beauty in front of him.
“Dray!” Harry screamed once again.
The sheer nerve of Potter had left Draco pacing his living room in a fury, wondering how Potter had become the way he was, all cocky and brash. What happened to him? Because that was not the Potter Draco had remembered from Hogwarts; and why had Draco thought it was absurdly attractive, but still greatly off-putting?
“No, Malfoy, stop,” Harry said at the same time Hermione chided ‘there are kids around, Malfoy.’
Harry laughed, brushing a strand of hair from Draco’s face. “I really do.”
“I wasn’t not going to, you know. I’m just not in the mood to socialize with-”
“What? Oh, sorry, no. I ask all my customers that. I was just being polite.” Draco said defensively.
Draco takes it up a notch. (He’s a horny bastard.)
Harry and Draco looked at each other desperately. “It’s ok, we’ll get through this. I’m glad we’re learning about it now so it’s not a surprise later.” Draco said, seeing the worry in Harry’s expression.
(Also, I’m loving Draco’s calm a reassuring character)
Harry nodded again, his grin growing even more, before he asked “Do you know how it works?”
“Well, because that’s what I thought, after what you said last night. About not choosing to marry me, or whatever. I wasn’t aware you weren’t serious until you came in.”
Harry sighed, upset that his mate was upset. “Come here,” he beckoned the blond over. When Draco appoched, Harry beckoned him down, kissing him languidly, lazily, and a few times at that. When he pulled away, Draco seemed more relaxed, the sullen looked he walked in with, replaced with relaxation and calmness. Harry smiled, kissing him again, whispering how special Draco was against his lips.
Harry shrugged and said "I don't read much. Do you?" He asked, trying to peer in Draco's eyes.
Harry groaned.
“Easy there, baby. Don’t want you to hurt yourself now.”
“So that’s why they want you to watch over me. So that if anything goes wrong, you can save me. Oh, I love being saved by you, Harry.” Malfoy said. Any other day and Harry would’ve thought that was a jab at his self esteem, but with the pure look of admiration in the blond’s features, he knew it was anything but.
“I can do that.” Harry smiles.
“I love you, Pans.” draco said, turning to look at her.
Kingsley had asked Harry how he and Draco were getting along after not seeing the man since Draco’s trial. Harry told him the truth, leaving out the part that they were mates, but told Kingsley they were together and happy.
Her expression was cool and calm. Harry didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad one. “Together as in ‘together together’?” She asked and Harry nodded. She took a deep breath before she stood and made her way over to the shrieking pot on the stove. She poured them both cups of tea, and another one for who Harry presumed was for Draco. She placed his cup in front of him and sat across from him again, taking a calm sip from her cup. “I casted a cooling charm.” She said gesturing to his cup.
“Throw me onto the bed, ravish me, and fuck me hard into the mattress until I’m screaming your name?” Harry asked.
Harry smiled at the bookworm. “Ok.”
“Nothing you wouldn’t have shown me, don’t worry. I only caught a glimpse of you outside, I didn’t watch you as you swam butt-arse naked in the Caribbean.” He said, chewing his salmon between his pearly whites.
Draco bit his lip and giggled at Harry's worries over him. “Yes, everything is fine.” Harry visibly relaxed. “It's about us, actually.” The stiffness returned, wide eyes accompanying it.
He scoffs heartedly. “I can help you with that.”
“Ah, Mr Potter. What can I do for you?” Kingsley asked as he saw Harry sitting in his office, waiting for him.
Harry tried for a smile, if anything to make the blond more comfortable. “Can you follow me to the study?” He asked, standing up. He always felt more comfortable in his warm study, especially if discussing serious matters. He was weird like that.
“It’s ok, Malfoy,” he soothed. “I have to shower.”
We fuck, like always. His cock, my arse. My screams, his cum.
“Draco,” Potter growled.
That doesn’t mean he can’t have a little fun with him, though.
“Would you like me to show you?”
This story took a turn I was not expecting. It is 2 am. I'm letting my sensitive and excited imagination run wild.
Oh bugger.
After that, he focused on his schoolwork, training to become a skilled potioneer. It was what he was best at, after all.
“You’re telling me.” Harry said as he took another swing of his second beer. He was comfortably buzzed and had the sudden urge to get home and cuddle Draco. They said their goodbyes with a hug and a promise to get together soon, then parted ways.
“You’re a pathetic excuse for a Gryffindor, you know that don’t you?” Draco insulted. At the furrow of Potter’s brow, he mediated with, “It’s a good thing you’re not totally helpless, your impulsive brashness definitely makes up for it.”
“Hi.” Harry’s happy expression faded then.
“So for example, if one naturally experiences exhaustion after sex, then as their libido increases, they may experience tiredness more often. If being in pain angers someone, then they will experience anger more often, just because that’s how they react to it. Do you understand?”
“Good luck, mate. You know we’re here for you.” Ron said reassuringly, clapping Harry on the back.
“I know, I wanted to- want to, but I’m ready now. I’m ready for us. I know I made it obvious I wasn’t ready to be totally intimate before, but I wasn’t ready to tell you that.” He took a moment to breathe. “I also wanted to see your reaction. I thought you weren’t into it at first, actually. You pulled away,” Draco frowned and Harry blushed red. “but now I know it’s because you care.” He said, smiling brightly. He nuzzled Harry’s neck, and curled up right around the Alpha’s side. His body hummed with contentment and relaxation, much different from the past few weeks.
“Stop that now, Draco.” Harry ground out. It was fierce, powerful even, making Draco obey the Alpha’s command. “Now, I assure you, you aren’t working alongside criminals. They’ve all been put away in Azkaban or dealt with otherwise. And another thing, I am not going to be Minister, nor am I so ‘worshiped’ as you believe me to be. Now settle down, or you will lose this fight. Do I make myself understood?” Harry overpowered Draco, who’d reversed their positions. Draco was sitting as Harry towered over him with his mighty presence.
“What happened? Why’d you panic all of a sudden.”
“Harry.” Draco responded curtly.
Draco screamed, wrapping a hand around the base of his cock, staving off his orgasm for as long as time and pressure would let him.
Harry shook his head slightly. “I can’t wait to spend forever with you.”
“Keep doing that and I'll have bruises for days, Potter.” Draco whispered to Harry as the Minister approached them.
“Why am I only learning about this now-” Draco said, closing in on Harry to hold him. The other man pushed his arms away, though.
“Hey, don’t go after my best mate.” Harry said defensively.
Draco sat, biting his nails and the skin around them, as Hermione and Ron came bounding toward him through the emergency entrance.
“Has anyone ever told you that you smell like peaches?” Harry whispered into his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Draco approached the Minister’s office, hand in hand. They were there to begin their training for their upcoming positions in the ministry. Harry realized he wouldn’t require nearly as much training as Draco would (not that he was happy being a ministry owl, as he calls it), although Harry agreed it would be best for them to both attend critical training arrangements.
“Oh ho ho, no way.” Potter laughed again. “No Potty. Potter is bad enough.”
“Woah, hold your horses there, Alpha. It’s fine. They aren’t doing anything. A little stoic, but nothing I haven’t dealt with before. They’re fine, really. I just don’t want them to hate me on my first shift.”
And with that, he shooed them out of his office. Draco just stared wide-eyed at the floor, before quickly glancing up at Harry; he then silently walking down the corridor, leaving Harry alone.
“We should go find him, make sure he’s ok.” Hermione requested.
“Wow, so you two really are limited with this whole prophecy thing.” Ron said after they’d finished.
He fell asleep with a smile on his lips and the memory of a warm hand in his own.
Harry deserved that pillow to the face, even if he wouldn't admit it.
naked -
He swore, threw on a robe, and exited the bathroom.
“You did threaten me last time.” I say honestly.
Third chapter in one day, wow. Also, my longest chapter.
She sputtered. “That’s not being malicious, it’s being practical. Unless you can think of something better?”
Draco stared at him for a few moments before asking quietly "That's a good thing, I hope?"
The honey coloured skin pulled taut over those toned muscles…
“What do you want, love?” Harry asks, holding Draco in his arms.
“Thank you Weasley, same to you.” Malfoy said.
“What are your plans for the day?” Harry asked, holding Draco against himself tightly.
Harry was taken aback. "Why?" He asked, trying to remain calm. He needed to comfort the Omega but wouldn't let himself, knowing it'd just frighten him even more.
“Harry…” Draco moaned as he arched into the touch. “Right now?”
“What? Oh, no. That was the wolf speaking, when I said those things before we fucked, but once I found out you were unconscious, the thought fled my mind. I didn’t produce a knot, either. It just wasn’t time yet.” Harry explained.
Once Draco could stand and breathe on his own, Harry escorted him to the sofa to sit.
He was already hard, everything that morning just setting him off a little more, and now Draco was trying to finish him off. All Harry wanted to do was rut into his little lithe Omega, but he needed to talk to him first. By some strength from Merlin, he rolled off and onto the bed beside his mate.
“Uh, yeah. Draco didn't have anything to bring here, so we went out to buy him some stuff.”
Hermione chuckled before saying "I'm sure you didn't scare him away, it's just all new to him. But ok Harry, I can come talk to him."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, we’re alright. They’re all good, too. How about you guys? How’d Mungo’s go?” Ron answered as Hermione left them to go to the bathroom.
“That’s probably Ron.” Harry guessed. He stood up, taking Draco with him. Harry grinned as Draco squawked at him, trying to wriggle out of his arms. As he released the blond, he gave him a little slap on his arse. He got a glare in return.
“No, I’m good.” Draco said with a sickly sweet smile.
“Hi.”
“That’s true, I guess. But I like some decency around here.”
Harry burst out laughing. “Yeah, a few times actually.”
“Oh, I’M aware, but it seems you’ve forgotten.” She smirks at him. “I’m sure he’d love to relive the experience you two had, because I KNOW something happened between you two, by listening through my gossip.”
“Drown him.” Ron said between a bite of mashed potatoes.
‘Alpha’s scents don’t affect Omegas, as Omega’s scents affect Alphas. The Alphas always claim the Omegas, what with their protective traits and all. Some might even say possessive. Alphas always find their Omegas. Alphas and Omegas can only mate with each other. They can have sex with other humans, but they won’t be able to produce offspring without their mate. A great thing about that is that if an Alpha and an Omega are mates and from the same sex, they can still have children. During the Omega’s heats, both bodies morph to be able to produce offspring. When Alpha and Omegas first appeared, they were always of the opposite sex; overtime, their magic and genes changed to accompany both sexes. This allowed for easier reproduction when Alphas found a mate.’
“Yeah, I’ll go.” He got up right away to go see what the franticness coming from his best mate was all about.
“They don’t care about cursed mail. They are simple enough incantations. If you deem them too much of a challenge, you can trade with another one of us.”
Harry kneeled and sucked the life from Draco’s cock, making it throb fantastically and leak copiously. Draco pulled Harry up to him, kissing him till he lay back on the couch. He ate him open and fingered him loose. He lubed him up and stretched him wide. He pushed his cock in, in, in, until his bullocks rested firmly on the edge of Harry’s perfectly sculpted arse, then proceeded to have his wicked way with him.
“He’s not worth you killing.”
“Body-binding me is no way to treat a guest, you imbeciles.” He sat up and rubbed the back of his head. “Where’s Harry?” He asked after a moment. Everyone turned to look behind Hermione. “Hiding already, Harry? I suppose so, we haven’t gotten to the fun parts, yet.” He smirked to himself.
“You know it’s not just fucking.” Harry said.
When the call ended and the flames died down again, Harry turned to take a seat at his desk, when he was taken by surprise at the blond already in his seat. How long had he been there for...?
But Harry didn't seem to get that, so he pulled back to look the bond in the eye. Tear tracks stained his porcelain skin. Harry's face changed to one of worry and he breathed an almost silent “Oh, Draco.” He reached up and wiped them away with his thumbs.
"Harry, you yelled at the Wizengamont?! What were you thinking?! I knew I shouldn't have let you do that alone. You could've gotten yourself in so much trouble!" Hermione scolded.
“Draco.” Harry interrupted, but to no avail.
Five…Quidditch
Light barely peeked through the drapes that covered Malfloy’s curtains, however, it landed right on Harry’s face, prompting him to wake up.
Draco didn’t want to be someone Harry hated. Draco wanted to be Harry’s crush. Draco wanted  the golden boy to be his boy. Draco wanted to be loved, too.
“Want a washcloth? Or a bath?” Harry asked, stroking hair out of Draco’s face.
“You know, I never thought I’d say this, like ever, but I agree with the ferret.” Weasley said.
Suddenly, an owl flew in from one of the study's open windows and landed on the desk lamp.
“Future route?” Draco questioned.
“So you fucked him again?” Pansy asked, incredulously, once again having brought lunch from an overpriced coffee shop, with an overpriced drink that had some kind of nectar, coffee, and ice in it.
His boyfriend of four years, Harry Potter, turned over and gasped at the sight before him. “Merlin, Draco, are you alright? You're sweating!”
“Great, what else has he said?” He muttered under his breath. “Look, Granger, not that I don’t appreciate your and Harry’s attempt to discuss with me matters that frankly don’t concern you-” he was abruptly stopped when her hand shot up at him.
“Dray, oh baby!” Smack!
“‘Old P’?” Ron questioned.
Apprehension, anxiety, desperation.
The class all resumed the lesson, leaving Harry to shove Malfoy so hard he fell off his stool.
Harry dropped his head into the pale shoulder beneath him and screamed a colourful line of curses.
“Harry,” he nuzzled Harry’s cheek.
Harry just resumed his note taking.
“Better, now that he’s here.” Malfoy then winked (WINKED) a Harry. “Hello, lover,” Malfoy said with a smirk.
Draco looked up to see the huge grin plastered on Harry’s face. “I guess.” Then a thought occurred to him. “Imagine what my father would think.” He chuckled. Harry winced.
“I was supposed to cook that, you know.” Draco laughed.
“-alright Mr Malfoy-” Madame Pomfrey was speaking to Malfoy when Harry came in, but was barely heard over Malfoy’s shouting.
When Draco sat down, his head fell forward, causing a piece of his immaculate blond hair to fall loosely in front of his face. He seemed to be in a daze of some sort; his gaze focused on the floor in front of him, his head hung low, and his lungs taking in deep long breaths.
Harry was barely trying to hold Draco back, just being the stronger of the two (Draco did hair for a living, he wasn’t exactly as fit as an evil-fighting wizard who worked 5-days a week to take down said evil). Eventually though, he had enough of the squirming struggle the smaller man was putting up, so he grabbed Dracos wrists and forced him to lie on his back, successfully pinning his wrists to the table with zero chance of him escaping.
Harry smiled back and decided to let it go. He then gestured for the blond to follow him. "Come, I'll, uh, give you a tour." He said, stepping into the hallway. He stopped short and turned to Draco "Have you been here before? I know this belonged to your mother's family and all, I just wasn't sure."
“What are your dreams?” Harry whispered into Draco’s hair. It was the next morning, and the two were lounging in bed, eating breakfast and enjoying their time together.
“Ok, but it kind of makes sense. It affects you more because when we first got married, you clearly weren’t happy about it, but I’d liked you from way before, so the prophecy doesn’t affect me as much. However, during our honeymoon, you just started to like me and it went quite fast, so I’m thinking it was you being more lenient around me, so the prophecy took advantage and you started to fall in love without really feeling it.
“Mhmm. I also read about knotting. You didn’t knot me either.” Draco said, somewhat putoff.
“Stop your games now, or I swear you won’t be able to sit all pretty like that.. for a long time.”
Within the next beat, he was pushing inside Draco’s small hole, his large, hard Alpha dick ramming straight through him.
“I can’t stop thinking about you.” Harry whispered, his breath ghosting over Draco’s face.
“Hermione. She’s brilliant. Anyways, I’ve got to go, but I’m not far, remember.” And with that, Harry pecked him on the cheek, then followed the Minister away, who began talking about his meeting with the Restricted Congress’ Rights to Magical Freedom, or whatnot.
"We left at the end of the wedding." Harry supplied.
Ron sighed then thought for a moment. Harry nodded towards his girlfriend with a questioning look, who was currently chewing the end of her quill into pieces. Ron saw what he was looking at and said “She hates Trelawney. More specifically divination. How ‘bout we go to Dumbledore tonight instead?” Ron had started listing the ingredients for a Pepper Up potion, so Harry decided to leave him to it.
But there is always more to the story.
“Malfoy,” Harry tried. The blond stopped attacking his neck, grabbed his face with both hands and turned Harry to face him.
Draco hears the familiar crack of apparition and the front door open and close, followed by booted footsteps.
Draco decided to wait in the limo.
“Come with me, Potter,” was all she said before she too exited the common room. Harry followed.
“Harry.” Nothing. “Harry.” Again, no response. “Baby…” Malfoy practically moaned.
An hour later after Harry had showered and eaten breakfast, a red, sweaty Draco came walking up the boardwalk.
“So what else?” Harry asked quietly, trying not to disrupt the nice silence that surrounded them.
“Yeah, that’s Hermione too. I love her to death, you know?” He said with a smile.
“Well, thank you Ronald. And yourself?” Draco said, accepting the handshake and nodding slightly.
“Your....teasing, it’s getting old.” Hermione supplied. “And frankly, making everyone around you uncomfortable.” She shifted in her seat, as if to solidify the fact.
Draco distracted Harry thoroughly with many kisses and many touches as he slowly inserted himself into his husband.
Two chapters in one day?! Wow, go me :p
“Honestly Potter, you need to stand up to those children once in a while or they will think they can walk all over you.” Draco said, picking up his beer and taking a long sip. He’d decided to go out with Potter again after he’d apologized earlier that week, and so far, there have been no invasive kisses or inappropriate groping. They revisited the pool hall across from Draco’s salon, as it was the easiest place for both of them to meet up at.
The blond let out a breathy laugh. It was so true. Harry had never been so blown away by the body of another human. He wasn’t the type to only pick suitors based on their looks, but a type of physical attraction to a person he already really liked made it so much better.
“Baby, please.” Draco said as he slowly pulled out a few inches, trying to release some of the pressure.
Draco reached between them and rubbed Harry’s length, then rubbed his leaking one against Harry’s.
“Yes, I suppose. Which makes me a really horrible husband, I know. It’s just still new to me, and being home now, with you, it’s all hard to deal with. But I’m trying. I will say things neither of us want to hear, but I’m really hoping you’ll stick with me anyways because there is no one else that I would want to go through this with me.” Harry explained.
Harry smiled. "None of that. You can borrow mine until we can go shopping." He started back up the stairs and entered his room. He quickly returned with a pair of comfy black slacks, a dark blue sweater, a pair of red pyjamas, and a few pairs of briefs. "I know sharing underwear must be really weird with your old school nemesis but its better than probably what you have right now. They're clean, obviously." He said with a shrug. He handed the pile of neatly folded clothes over to Draco who took them gratefully.
Naked Malfoy followed him into the bedroom.
After washing up and getting as comfortable in Malfoy’s bed as he permitted himself to be, he was ready to fall asleep.
“He would’ve died, Potter.” Snape growled. “Consider yourself lucky.” He began walking out again, but Harry stopped him one more time.
Harry was happy where he was with Draco, and he didn't want to force him into anything by bringing it up. He knew the blond would come to him when he was ready, so he decided to wait until he did so.
“I missed you,” Malfoy said, moving closer to Harry so their chests were almost touching, their faces inches apart.
“Draco, baby, are you ok?” Harry asked frantically, not aware that Draco had been crying. He continued to check over Draco, asking him again and again if he was hurt.
But why did it not feel...right?
“Aren’t you, though?” Harry asked with a patronizing tilt of his head. Draco just turned back to face his book. “As I was saying, I know you’re upset about our earlier confrontation, but I just wanted to talk to you right now.” He said, walking around the sofa to sit beside his Omega, pulling the book gently from his hands.
“No. What do you need to talk to him about? And how did you get in here? You don’t work in the ministry.”
“No, don’t get me wrong. I like it, I do, I just never had a break from evil, power hungry wizards who want to rule the wizarding world. I feel like I never had the chance to find out what I was good at that I loved to do.”
Harry sighed. “Love, hope, a forever.”
Please review!
As soon as they landed in Harry’s apartment, having Apparated from a nearby alleyway, Harry was on Draco within a second, hands grabbing and groping Draco once more.
As Harry toed off his shoes, Draco slyly went behind him, wrapped his arms around him, and leaned down to kiss at his neck.
When Harry returned to Dumbledore’s office that evening, Malfoy and the headmaster were both there.
Draco swallowed nervously. “Yes?”
“Well, he’s a bastard then. If he can’t see what kind of a prize you-”
“Everything ok?” Harry asked.
“I love you so.” Harry said, nuzzling Draco’s neck affectionately. He curled up against his mate, rubbing calming hands over the smaller body, as Draco continued reading his book. The two of them just enjoying each other’s presence late into the night.
The three men looked around at each other, shocked.
“Yes. No one knows, except my mother. And now you, I guess.”
The corals, fish and oceanbeds created an atmosphere Draco had never experienced. It was so full of life and colour, he felt as though he wanted to become a fish just to join this world he was missing.
Draco climbed his way up Harry again, settling nicely over his chest. “Take it deep for me, baby.” he said, feeding his cock through Harry’s open mouth.
Draco sighed.
Harry didn’t say anything for a minute and Draco watched a blush creep up his neck. “It’s nothing.” He murmured, but Draco was having none of it. He turned to look at Harry.
Draco scrunched his nose before saying “Not in that ghastly colour!” Harry chuckled.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other with quizzical looks, not expecting Harry and him to be so affectionate with each other. The last time they saw each other, the “happy” couple was going to rip each other’s heads off. Well, Harry wanted to, at least.
Draco groaned. “It's too early to know.” Harry chuckled.
“Good. Make sure he eats dinner tonight, too. He could use it.”
“I’m alright. I know what’s wrong. It’s just a bit of morning sickness.” she responded breathlessly.
“Come in.” Harry said quietly, beckoning him forward. He was sufficiently covered with bubbles, maintaining his privacy, so he was ok to let the blond in.
Draco had retreated to the library after putting away his new clothes in the wardrobe in his room. He had decided to read up on some old spells he hadn’t practiced since Hogwarts, when a knock sounded at the door. He stood from the couch he was lounging on and opened the door to find Hermione Granger smiling at him.
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists, where his hands held Draco’s cheeks, and held onto them tightly. “I know.” He sniffled.
“Just so you know, everyone knows. I thought it best to prepare them for a situation like this, I knew was bound to happen. McGonagall didn’t let up easy, did she?”
Except for a particular Omega, his mind supplied.
Hope you enjoyed! Thank you for reading! If you're interested, check out my other works! :)
“I like to read.” Draco replied.
“Draco,” Snape called.
Harry and Draco nodded.
“I’ll see you later.” He said with a smile as he walked out the door. Draco didn’t even spare him a glance as he turned and walked up the stairs. Harry sighed and shut the door behind him before walking down the steps and headed towards the cafe.
“I need to KNOW he can be.” Harry reiterated.
“However do you mean?” Draco asked. He knew he actually looked confused on the outside, but was jumping with glee on the inside, loving how he could entice Harry like this.
“Ok, but what does that have to do with him throwing himself on me?” Harry asked.
Harry smiled. “I know.”
“He’s well.”
“Well, from what you and Ms Granger have told us, when you found Mr Malfoy, he was emotionally unstable. His mental state was probably what was compromised when the spell hit, seeing as emotionality and mentality are connected strongly through neurological attachments.” Madame Pomfrey supplied.
Less than 10 seconds later, the fireplace roared and a blond head fell through, and Harry let out a breath he wasn't aware he was holding. They dusted themselves off and Harry gestured around them "Welcome home."
“Have you ever done this?” Harry asked abruptly before Draco could advance any further.
“Well then, what should I call you? Harry?” Draco asked, a joking lit sounding when he said ‘Harry’.
There it is. I follow him in and close the door behind myself.
Harry’s mouth watered, and his skin became all prickly. His Alpha roared within him, screaming for him to take.
“What do you mean by cursebreaking? Don’t they have cursebreakers for that?” Draco asked, not giving two shits about not asking questions.
Harry sighed and sat down. “I have some important document that Kingsley required me to go- holy fuck, baby.” Harry gasped, finally looked up from his papers at Draco, who stood, dressed only in dark green, lacy lingerie.
Harry went to say something but the kettle shrieked, signalling the water was boiled and the tea ready.
“Well, you made dinner last night. And you were still sleeping when I woke up.”
“Did you just smell me?” Draco accused, turning to look up at his mate, referring to the sniff Harry covered with as a sigh.
“Fine.” Draco gritted. He was tired enough as it is and didn’t need Harry’s stubborn arse irritating him any further. “Go sleep on the couch, then.” He rolled over and turned the bedside lamp off.
“Nah. I’ll just owl Kingsley that I took the rest of the day off.”
“Oh come on, Harry. We’ll have to do it sooner or later. It’s just sleep.” Draco said, starting to get under the covers.
“Everything ok?” an eyebrow shot up at the blond’s odd behaviour.
“Thank you, Weaslebee.”
Draco paused and looked at Harry with confusion and hesitancy.
(See the end of the chapter for
After they ate breakfast, Draco wanted to finally test the water as he hadn’t yet gone swimming since they’d arrived.
“Have you calmed down?”
“Please stop.” Harry said.
“Let’s just get this done and over with.” He said in a pained voice.
They sat in silence for a few minutes before Potter spoke again.
“I’d be concerned if you did, I’d think you’d have us on your mind all the time, which would be weirder than Snape showering.” Draco said, sitting in what he assumed was Harry’s seat, ignoring Weasley’s earlier denial.
Harry’s throat suddenly became too tight to breathe. He loosened his tie then immediately the distinct feeling of prickling started behind his eyes. He blinked back the tears that threatened to fall, still trying to get air into his lungs. As soon as Ron and Hermione noticed, worry etched into their features. As they sat him down in a nearby chair, trying to calm him down, he stood abruptly and started pacing around the vast expanse of the room. He managed to remove his tie - why was it so tight?! - but he still had trouble getting air to his oxygen deprived lungs. Hermione and Ron’s pleading voices for him to calm down drowned out in the rush of blood he heard in his ears.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, that explains some of my feelings. Glad that's sorted out.” He laughed, and Harry sweared he'd never heard something so beautiful.
“I know,” Harry chuckled quite breathlessly already.
Harry pulled his face out of his hands. “Keep your hands to yourself, Malfoy, and I’ll treat you later.” Harry said, knowing he was going to pay for that later. Better later with Malfoy, than with Snape and his pure hatred towards Harry.
Harry could’ve sworn he caught a smile.
“You betcha.” He said, then pushed Draco up the bed so he could kneel in front of him. He wrapped a hand around Draco’s cock, bending slightly to lick and suck at his head. He kept his ministrations light, but after a hand crept it’s way into his hair, he took the whole thing in his mouth. Draco wasn’t particularly that big, about average size, and with Harry’s lack of a gag reflex, he was able to swallow the whole thing.
"I'm afraid that if I say anything else I'll just scare him away. I probably already did. Merlin, you should just come and talk to him. I'm not good with this kind of stuff."
It took me a long time to write this, but it’s actually shorter than I thought. Know I’m sad.
Just the fact that it’s Potter, his mind supplied. He agreed. If it was anyone else, he would’ve hexed them to Azkaban and back, to then banish them to the Forbidden Forest for Aragog’s children to feast upon their monstrous being.
"Mister Potter!" Kingsley Shacklebolt yelled, stopping Harry's rant. Harry looked up in shock to see the Minister glaring down at him, while the Wizengamont looked at him appalled at his sudden outburst. "You will be escorted out of this courtroom immediately until you can calm yourself enough to return and finish this trial. 30 minute break. Now get out, all of you!" The Minister said in his best authoritative voice.
“I hardly think a sneeze should cause such a reaction.” Draco said irritably before succumbing to the pleasant hold around him.
When their plates emptied and several glasses of wine later, Draco wasn’t expecting Harry to ask him: “What do you like to do in your spare time.”
When Harry peeked out of his study to find the bathroom empty, he made his way over to clean up. He quickly gave up the task of trying to scrub the wretched brownie batter out of his clothes, so he shucked them off and decided to shower again instead. All his unhelpful mind kept supplying was the feel of pressure against his lips and the taste of uncooked brownie on his tongue.
“Mhmm…” was Hermione’s reply.
Harry groaned around the cock in his mouth and sucked harder. A few seconds later, and the hand in his hair tightened as Draco’s seed exploded in his mouth. A moment later and he came on his hand, too. He swallowed his husband’s seed savouringly. He stood up and leaned over the blond to kiss him passionately.
“What the fuck, Draco? No, obviously not.”
“Ok, how about we meet up at John’s when you’re finished. You play pool, don’t you?” Harry asked as Draco vigorously towel dried his dripping hair.
“I resent that.” Harry laughed as Draco rolled on top of him to kiss his soon-to-be bonded.
He places his book down on the coffee table, his poetry reading interrupted by his boyfriend’s arrival. He leaves the library and walks towards the stairs, looking down to see Harry with his cloak dropped beside him on the floor, his back pressed flat against the front door.
"What about the place we consummated the bonding?" Harry inquired.
“I did say that, didn’t I.” Harry began before Draco could continue. “I believe it would be best for us to start our jobs first though, and that could be another month from now.” Harry was just thinking out loud at this point.
“So, as you two are aware, you were engaging in intimate activities before it occurred. Keep in mind, that wasn’t what caused it. You had stopped for a moment, however, to converse, jokingly, obviously, about Harry going to find someone who would, well, you know, ‘do the job’.” The boys both blushed furiously at her words. “This, now, I know it might sound crazy, but you know how you two had to join in matrimony under the pretense of a prophecy? Well, this ‘joke’ had somewhat angered it in a way. It didn’t approve of the thought of Harry finding someone else to engage in intercorse with, seeing as that is one of the most sacred acts of marriage. And since you two were already in that position, it made the notion even more drastic. So, the prophecy gave a sort of warning, shocking Harry in a way, seeing as he was the one who brought it up. This caused his seizure. Again, I know it’s a long shot and it is a theory of sorts, but it all adds up.”
As Harry strained the pasta through the sieve, he briefly heard the water from the shower turn off, and thought back to the blond. He let his mind wander to what the blond was doing right then; probably grabbing his towel, drying off his silky, pale skin, as water droplets drip off every part of his his body- Harry was thrown out of his thoughts as he almost dropped the pot of pasta. He quickly returned the pot to the stove and grabbed two bowls from the cupboard. He carefully filled both bowls, poured some tomato sauce on top, sprinkled some parmesan on as well. He placed both bowls across from each other at the table and filled two glasses with water as Draco quietly entered the kitchen.
Harry jerked awake. The bed next to him was empty but still warm, and the shower was running in the conjoined bathroom. He stretched out, much like a cat would, and padded off to the bathroom.
"Thank you, sir. For everything." He replied, not quite meeting the Ministers eye.
He shakes his head. “I wanna go home.” He says quietly.
“Ok, Scarhead.”
Draco’s head then shot up with a raised eyebrow. “What else?”
“Paint me white.” was all Harry said when he felt Draco losing it, causing him to have one of the strongest orgasms ever.
“8 weeks. I just found out the other day. I missed a few periods and got worried so I went to Mungo’s and they told me. I told Ron I was visiting Fluer. She came with me. Only we know.” she turned to him to look him in the eyes. “He can’t, though. Not right now. I have to find a way to tell him. We’re not ready for this right now. We’re not even engaged.” she started crying, probably from the stress of the whole situation. “Please promise you won’t tell anyone. Not Harry, not anyone.”
Draco propped himself up on his elbows and watched as Harry pulled off his underwear slowly and tantalizingly. They both gasped as Draco’s half-hard cock sprang upward, Harry at the sight and Draco at the sensation.
“Why wouldn’t it? It seemed like a strong one, too,” Seamus perked.
Draco looked up at him with a raised brow and a smirk. “Why?” He asked sceptically.
“Yeah, mate. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the git run so fast. He was beside you before you even hit the ground.”
The support on this story has been insane, I’m so thankful to everyone who reads and responds to my fics. I’m always looking for suggestions, so if you have any, PLEASE let me know! Thanks :)
“Right. I assume you have no idea what you’re doing, then?” Jonathan asked. Draco did nothing. “Well this is where you’re going to spend all your time.” He said, turning back to the main area “That’s Ethan, Mason, Philip and Danny or Danielle, but she prefers Danny.” Jonathan said as he pointed to everyone in unison with their name, which they all gave nods or a little wave to him. “Everyone here calls me John or Johnny. Applies to you too, seeing as your our new recruit.” Jonathan went and stood at an empty section of table beside the woman, Danielle. “This is your spot. This is where you will sort the mail, produce any necessary incantations or cursebreaking spells on the mail, and then send them off to the correct department, office or section of the Ministry." He then went and stood in the place he was in when Draco first walked in. “We all stick to our spots. When you're given a spot, you stick to it. You will sort the required amount of mail a day. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t, cause no one here gives a shit. We aren’t paid enough. Get started, you have quite the pile.” And he went back to sorting at that.
Draco pursed his lips and looked around the living room. "I'm alright. It's just been a long day, I guess." He answered, attempting a small smile.
Harry squeaked in a very unmanly manner, pulling himself from the touchy-grabby hands once again. He quickly bent to pick up his discarded towel. Malfoy may not care much about decorum or propriety (which Harry knew was a lie, as the Draco Malfoy he knew did very much care about such things),
“Naked? Hermione asked, bewildered.
Her smile grew. “Yes. He’s so happy to be with you Draco. He hasn’t been able to stop talking about you. Good things, I mean. He really likes you Draco.”
“You are still in the beginning of your manifestation. You will experience a lot of new things your body can do: some you like, and others you don’t. It is hard for your brain to control everything, sending a few things haywire. In your case, it’s mainly your emotions. I don’t blame you, I understand this is still a hard time for you. You really don’t need to apologize.” Harry tried to reassure his mate, who seemed downright miserable.
“Wh - who? I - um, I didn't know…”
“-for you to be comfort-” Draco lay a gentle hand on Harry’s thigh, spurring him into action.
Draco's breathing picked up before he ran a hand through his still damp hair. "It's hard to explain..." he saw the worried expression on Harry's face and backed away slightly.
Ron and Hermione eyed the two in shock at the complete control Harry had over the blond. Albeit forcefully and threateningly, he still managed to make him shut up.
Draco looked at him the way he did the first week, when they discovered they were mates: nervous, but wanting.
It was exceptionally lonely being Draco Malfoy.
Draco was then approached by a man who said he was scheduled to shuttle them to their private resort. Once the bags were packed again and Harry and Draco got into the van, they were driven down a long stretch of road for about half an hour. When they stopped and were given directions as to how to walk to their private little palace, they grabbed their bags and walked two minutes down the beach to a boardwalk. This boardwalk, lined up and down the sides with tiny candles, led to a beautiful, large bungalow out in the middle of the water. It was maybe 100 yards from shore, with no other residency in sight, giving them enough privacy for the whole month they’d be spending there.
A blush.
When Draco approached his desk, he sat on the upper corner, crossed his legs, and made sure to show off his garter belt. The size of Harry’s desk was so large, he wasn’t able to reach Draco from where he sat on the edge of it.
He’d seen the look on Draco’s face before he left, he felt the cold barrier Draco tried to build out of thin air to separate himself from Harry, the way he hugged himself so tight… it was all so wrong to Harry, and he knew what he had to do, despite his reluctance to do it. But if he was happy with Draco, and Draco with he, then why not tell everyone? He was dreading it because he didn’t want to hurt anyone, making them think he betrayed them by falling for one of Voldemort’s followers-
“I’m glad you like it! I’ve been told I make some great pancakes.” Harry said, filling his own plate. All he got was a grunt in response, as Draco’s mouth was so full of pancakes.
“Severus! Good to see you. I’m feeling fine, by the way. I could use a shower though, cleaning charms can only do so much.” He fidgeted, as if the dirt on his body grossed him out. “Say, Harry, care to join? There’s enough room for both of us.” The bastard winked again.
“Well, no, but it is the right thing to do. C’mon, Harry,” Hermione responded.
Draco sighed and stepped forward to get Potter’s attention. “Fine. I might, MIGHT, consider going out with you again, but later. I still have lots to do today. And you better give me Finnegan’s details, I need to pay him a visit.”
As his back hit the soft cushion of the arm chair, he realized he was breathing. The cool air soothing his burning insides brought him back fully to consciousness. He looked into Ron’s worried blue eyes and nodded, confirming that he was okay. He sat up, readjusted himself as Hermione rushed back into the room with a glass of water and what looked like a wet face towel.
One particular comment, something to do with 'no good Death Eater scum', as Harry believed he heard, made him grip the bench so tightly, it made an ominous creaking sound and a few splinters found their way into his skin. He rubbed them gingerly and avoided the questioning gazes from the few that heard it.
“Ha, yeah, Ron came up with that one. Personally I prefer ‘The Bent who Lived’, but Hermione said it was too tacky.”
Harry smiled sheepishly. “Yeah, about that…”
“I only want-”
When they separated, Draco dove beneath the waves and started exploring the underwater world that lurked beneath them.
Oh....
Harry sat down at the kitchen table and thought back to what Hermione said. ‘Wait until he comes to you.’
Just then, Marigold Pearings, the medi-witch from that morning and the night before, appeared in the doorway; a tall, frail-looking woman, possibly in her late thirties, stood beside her.
A few days later, Draco and Harry sat on the sofa, enjoying some telly and a few glasses of wine. Quite a few, if you asked the two empty bottles on the kitchen counter.
“Well, if you would just-” Harry stopped, mid sentence, looking away from Draco.
“It’s me.” Harry said with a chuckle.
Harry coughed, more like choked, on his pancake. He threw Malfoy’s hand off his privates, attempting to keep what little shred of dignity he had left safe.
“That all sounds very nice.” Harry whispered from above him.
He breathed deeply before opening his eyes.
Harry turned sharply, their faces much closer than he would’ve liked, but he kept it to himself for the dramatics. “Careful, or I’ll tape your mouth shut.”
Harry was panting with the force of which he’d cast the spell, still watching the blond closely for any signs of danger. But they didn’t come, and the blond just stood there, staring off into the distance, presumably unaware of what was going on.
Draco gasped and bit his lip, feeling a stream of tears form. He sniffed and smiled so brightly, Harry squeezed him closer to himself.
“Seamus! You’ve been casting on people again?” Granger shouted at the irish brute.
“Oh, so I'm back to ‘Potter’, am I?” Harry asked lightly. Draco had stopped calling Harry ‘Potter’ every time he addressed him after their third date, but let it slip every once in a while when he was upset, especially at the raven-haired boy.
“I’m going to make love to you.” Harry said seriously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go ask.” he gave Harry a quick kiss and headed out of the room to find someone to help them.
“Yes, I believe we are. Draco, Abraham shall be with you shortly to take you on a tour of the facility. I trust everything will be fine.” The Minister said. Draco nodded mutely, slightly terrified that Harry was leaving him to explore the Ministry of Magic with a total stranger, which he’d never met before.
“Yeah, but only under certain circumstances, and not as strong as we feel it now.” Harry told her.
“Nah nah, I’m done. Just poking, you know.”
Lilac hair.
“Personal relationships, well, that’s on you. There’s Granger and Weasley which they’ll no doubt ask about. As for romantic relationships… well, um…” that’s where Draco seemed to falter and Harry caught on quickly.
“H-hi, Malfoy,” Harry said, tentatively, totally unsure of what was going on.
“What.. I thought you wanted to wait..”
“I don’t want to talk about this, Draco. We’ve already had this discussion. Give us some time and we’ll revisit it in a little while.”
Draco bit his lip again and nodded. "It's ok though, I can just wash these-" he said pulling on his shirt but was quickly interrupted by Harry.
“I know, but how’re we supposed to stop this? I’ve had enough and I know you have too. Don’t deny it.”
Harry continued to suck Draco off in a timely manner, until he felt a hand pull his hair and heard the blond stuttering something from above.
Before they could get any farther, Harry pulled back. “Are you sure?” He looked into Draco’s eyes.
At least not right now.
He shivered against the taller man, doing as he was told. Once naked and laying on the bed, Draco, who’d divested himself of his pants in the meantime, climbed over top of him and started rubbing himself along the brunet’s back, kissing his way across the map of skin.
Hermione released him and smoothed herself out. “We finished earlier today. I wasn't aware until the last minute. Sorry to show up unannounced, I should've told you.” She leaned in a little closer to whisper “I used the key from under the pot.”
“Oh, you’re so hot.” Harry said, leaning down once again to kiss his collarbones. Draco smirked, not that Harry could see that though.
(See the end of the chapter for
And to feel the heat burn through my heart
"Aren't you tired?" Harry eventually asked. "You've had a long day." His thumb lazily stroked the back of Draco's hand.
Harry turned to him. “You think? It’s this damn prophecy. It’s making me sick, I feel like absolute shit. That damn seizure wasn’t fake, it was fucking terrifying! I am so done with the constant feeling of my heart ripping out of my chest whenever I’m not in the same room as you. I don’t know why I feel all these things, or I’m the one that keeps getting hurt by this, but I’m fed up with it.”
They lay there silently, except for their heavy breathing, their orgasmshave been ripped so hard from them.
When their luggage was all brought in, and they were decidedly extremely sleep deprived, they both started getting ready for bed. With few words being exchanged between them from the plane all the way to here, they also got ready in a silent manner.
“Of course. They should know I wouldn’t go anywhere without you.” Harry beckoned the blond over to him. He straddled Harry’s lap, running his slim hands through the rat’s nets of hair.
“What the hell, Potter? You can’t just-” but he was cut off once again by Potter's lips on his. He was being held on so tightly, that the only way he could get released was to push Potter away. More like a punch, on the face, but it did the trick.
"That's a very good thing! I mean, I like this you a lot better than before." Draco just stared back at Harry, so he continued onto what he really wanted to say. "There's just, um, one more thing I'd like to ask."
“Cruc-”
Draco continued his work, luckily not getting any cursed mail on his first day. No one really spoke throughout the shift, and Draco certainly didn’t say anything else.
“Are you excited to go home?” Harry whispered to him. They sat beside each other on the jet, much different than their first flight together.
“Keep up your attitude and I’ll leave you in the hallway.” Harry threatened, remembering how much Malfoy did not want to be left alone out there.
“Urgh, dammit, Draco. Fuck me already.” He says, panting slightly.
“...no.” He said.
“Oh, that's very kind of you Harry.”
She blinked a few times, shook her head, and as if coming back to the present greeted him like nothing just happened, and continued down the corridor.
Harry laughed at that and stripped down, before jumping in from where he stood above the water. Draco shrieked as he got splashed, and when Harry surfaced, wet and gleaming, Draco felt his mouth water.
“Woah, woah, Malfoy. Don’t, no- Malfoy, what the-” Harry tried, but once Malfoy came close to him, he immediately grabbed ahold of Harry and wrapped himself around him.
“Just...I don’t know. I can’t stand to be around him.”
at their private resort…
Let me know what you guys think. I’m not crazy about this one, so I might edit it later on.
“It went well, we’ll fill you guys in. Draco just went to shower, he should be done in a moment.”
“So,” Dumbledore began, “it seems that the prophecy is exact. I will consult with Professor Trelawney and see what her expertise is on the matter. She will, of course, watch back the memory, and once we’ve consulted, we will meet again boys. Now, off to your classes.”
“I’m happy to see you too.” She chuckled. “Luna’s waiting for me, and Hermione and Ron have already taken their places.” Harry nodded, seeing as that was the only thing he could do at the moment. She looked down the aisle, pursing her lips together in a thoughtful manner, and turned back to him to kiss him on the cheek. “He’s not as bad as you think, you know.” She whispered in his ear. With one last hug and a you’ll be fine, she returned to her seat, leaving Harry alone once again.
“You know what I mean. It’s not like I was thrilled to marry you in the first place.” Harry continued, anger serging through him.
He slowly stretched him with one, two, three fingers, lubing him up with a spell and pressing in gently, all the while whispering how amazing and beautiful he was underneath him.
Draco's eyes fluttered up slowly, meeting Harrys once again. He sighed then whispered "Scared."
Draco raised and eyebrow but sat back down anyways. "Yes?" He asked skeptically.
“Your prostate, most likely. I can’t imagine another reason why it would be so pleasurable the first time.” Draco responded, pulling out with a low groan.
As he pushed himself off the bed and onto his shaky legs, he wondered if Harry was asleep or still in his study. Not wanting to bother Harry either way, he tiptoed again over to the library at the other end of the hall. He pushed the doors open and switched on the light. The room was brighter, the shelves shined, and the trinkets twinkled. From the looks of it, Kreacher actually did a wonderful job. He stepped in and did a once-over the room before finding himself in front of the poetry section. Draco loved poetry. He knew he was excited to come across it in this library. He grabbed a random book off the shelf and started flipping through it. He landed on a random page and began reading the small poem he'd found.
“Old prophecy.” Draco supplied. “He came up with it.” he pointed to Harry.
“Hmmm,” Malfoy hummed in his ear.
Hermione looked at him thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t kill you, no, but you might just end up burying yourself in guilt because you won’t give him a chance. Trust me on this one, Harry. It’ll count.”
Harry didn’t reply, but his face was beaten bright red.
Smack!
“Ok, Malfoy. What is it you want?” He said, not as unkindly as he thought, turning around in his arms.
Eventually, Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and pulled him onto his lap. He snogged him senseless. Draco pulled away, sputtering as Harry tried to kiss him more.
“I know, Harry, I just want to make sure you’re ok. I know this is really hard for you, I can’t imagine it would be anything but. I love you Harry, and I’ll always be here for you.”
“I know, babe. But from what you’re saying, about him taking down that guy, and the way he was acting on your first date? Oh honey, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.”
In his slightly intoxicated state, Draco did his best to divest the two of them of their clothes. He licked and sucked, petted and rubbed every inch of Harry’s perfect body.
Harry wouldn’t look at Draco. “Did what? He asked knowingly.
“Don’t fucking joke about that.”
“You’re good at Quidditch.” Draco said after a moment. “Great, actually. Fastest, youngest flyer, you are. Were, I guess. You should think about pursuing that.”
Harry glanced at Ron, begging him to help him. Ron knew about Harry’s panic attacks - he’s had them ever since third year at Hogwarts. Ron always helped him with them, and he knew by now that the only thing that really helped pull Harry out was contact. Warm, comforting, bodily contact really helped bring Harry back.
Draco was not expecting that. He’d have to admit that his leave of the table was uncalled for and very improper without excusing oneself, but Harry’s question caught him so off guard.
Dray?!! What?! Draco’s eyes widened comically. “Actually, I’ve been here for-”
“Your hair is pink.” Harry stated. “I like it.” He smiled fondly down at Draco.
Seven...the Wizarding World
“I’m busy.” was all Harry said.
A few beats passed, where the blond didn’t move or speak, and Harry skimmed his hands gently atop the waters’ surface.
“Wow. That’s got to be tough for you two, given your history.” Hermione said.
“My father did work within the Ministry, you know. He was always going on about the Aurors and their ‘brash privileges’.”
“I will curse you, you know. And I’ll spell your mouth shut too. Permanently.” Harry said matter of factly.
He stops and glares at her. She doesn’t seem fazed as she continues “He experienced a magical rupture through his core, unbeknownst to us. As a result, his body physically couldn’t handle that amount of stress, so it locked down and he suffered a seizure due to it. Is there any possible explanation you know of that he could’ve done to have caused this?”
The medi-witch nodded, a stance of pure business and professionalism radiating off of her. Draco admired the behaviour, wondering if he could project the same if he were in such a tasking position.
“Well, based on this crucial information-” Walkins continued, before Harry interrupted her.
Harry sighed. He wanted to ask Draco about his inheritance and everything, but he hadn't gotten this far in his planning. "Um, well," he started lamely. Draco gave him a 'spit-it-out' look and Harry dived in head first. "Are you an Omega?"
“Then explain why you were so willing yesterday.”
Snape was positively seething. “Get out.”
“There’s another thing we are wondering about.” Draco said. He wanted to bring it up now, that they had gotten the answers to their previous questions. “Can-can the prophecy control emotions, acts or thoughts?” Draco needed to know. He trusted Harry, but you can never be too careful with magic. He didn’t know what he’d do if everything Harry had said and did was all a lie.
Draco just stepped back to let her in. She thanked him and handed him a cup of tea. She stepped in the room. “Oh, wow. I haven’t been in here in a long time. Harry’s told me what you’ve done with it. It looks wonderful.” She slowly spinned and took in her surroundings.
He really needed to calm down before his magic got out of control.
Harry smiles. He was hesitant before, dreading this moment for hours… but now he knows exactly what to say. He’s not hesitating, and he’s more than willing to answer this simple question.
“Draco Malfoy?” Abraham asked. Draco nodded and stood. “Welcome. I’m Abraham Smeed, but you may call me Abraham. I am here to escort you through the Ministry and begin your training as a part of the Ministry of Magic’s Postal Services and Interior Messaging Systems. Or PSIMS. Are you ready to begin?” The man asked. Draco nodded, and followed the stoutly man through the corridors of the Ministry, anxiously leaving Harry behind.
“Dean hit him with a body-bind. He’s on the floor in the common room,” Ron said.
Draco’s snarky attitude dropped immediately, and he pulled back to see Harry clearly. “Don’t you play like that, Harry.” Seriousness dripping from his tone.
“Oh no? Tell me again why you’re here.” Harry said, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair and cheek, turning to look at him in the eye.
“I told them because you looked so upset before I left. You wanted me to tell them about us!”
He looks at me sincerely with a small smile playing on his lips.
“But why, when I’ve got you in front of me now, shaking like you are…” He reached forward and put his hands on Harry’s thighs.
It was now quarter to seven, and a deep sense of dread started to work its way through Draco.
“Oh Merlin.” Draco said, crying.
There was no reply which prompted Draco to look up and saw Harry with the most gorgeous smile Draco had ever seen. And it took him a moment to realize that it was directed to him.
Draco felt all the blood in his body race to his face. “Yeah, well, I’ve made a profession out of it, I better be good at it.”
“Wha- then why- ...what? Draco!”
Draco and Harry exchanged looks. “Ok, I’m really interested to know what you found out, but,” he turned to Draco, “you told her what we were doing?” he pinned Draco with an accusatory look.
“You need to get those roots touched up, though.” He said, jokingly.
But Harry was faster. “Sectumsemptra!” He yelled.
“Well, what do we do now?” Harry asked. “We can’t even joke about anything because of this damn prophecy?” he was getting aggravated. This whole situation just put him on edge. The fact that he couldn’t go home to sleep in his own bed because he had to be here due to this damn prophecy.
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t actually. Why I believe so is because I had feelings for Harry even before the prophecy presented itself. Harry did not, and was unaware of mine at the time. I know he has feelings for me now, but we’re still in the early stages of dealing with all of this, that I think he just gets them mixed up sometimes. As well, he is the bold-headed Gryffindor, so he is more likely to go outside of the rules and ‘jostle’ the prophecy’s magic more than I am, so to speak.”
“Maybe you're getting sick.” Harry added as an afterthought, voice thick with sleep again.
Draco bucked up immediately, but was held fast by Harry’s hands on his hips. As Harry licked and sucked Draco through the best blowjob he's ever had, Harry fisted his own cock in his underwear to relive some of the ache that accompanied their explicit activities.
“Don’t. Just shut the fuck up and listen. You don’t get to come into my shop and disrupt my day like that, after that stunt you pulled the other night. All of those stunts, actually. If you think I’d waste my time with someone who does those things, or behaves like that towards me, you are worse than I thought you to be.” Draco said, glad he’d now said his part.
Harry's smile reached from ear to ear and the sight made Draco's heart warm. “No, I suppose not. Hang on, I'm coming down.” Harry turned back to his study for a moment and Draco made his way to the kitchen.
Harry nodded. “The war…” he trailed off but Draco understood perfectly. He nodded as well and they sat in silence for a minute. Sleep creeping up more into his brain, Draco tucked himself further down under the covers. Harry got the message and turned the bedside light off, then rolled over to the Omega and curled around him.
Harry came, twisting and tensing his whole body, screaming with all the air he had.
Harry looked up at him, shocked. He didn't mean for him to take him seriously, even though he meant it.
As Draco apparated to the front door of 12 Grimmauld Place, another sneeze escaped him. He had sneezed at least five times while he was at work at Gringotts. Being the bank’s newly appointed manager gave him a few extra privileges than regular employees. One being that he could leave whenever he wanted too. After another sneezing fit that lasted 3 sneezes, he decided to call it a day.
Harry groaned.
Draco took a seat and waited for Harry to bring the… weird brown...circular ‘pancake’ things? “Those are them?” he asked, pointing to the plate on which they sat.
“Oh, you stupid - high up - freaking short arms - can’t do anything -”
“I am, assuming you’re talking about the colourist who owns a shop across the street.” Draco responded.
“That’s not what I’m saying! Merlin, Harry! You aren’t listening to me. We,” he gestured between them. “need to get to know each other.”
“What are you doing here? Not that I’m not glad to see you…” Harry said, running his hands through Draco’s hair.
“So, what did you want to tell me?” Harry asked quietly, making Draco feel extremely safe.
Harry looked at him very concerned. “Oh my, are you alright? What happened? Maybe it was the kiss-” Harry's questions were silenced when a pale hand shot up in his face telling him to stop.
Then the prophecy appeared, and all of a sudden Draco was to blame for ruining Harry’s life. He wasn’t going to live with this animosity for the rest of his life. He just wanted to be happy, too, and he hadn’t felt that in a long time.
People had started saying that Draco had used the imperius curse on Harry, to use him for fame, fortune, everything. Then they moved onto saying that Draco was threatening Harry, then that he had kidnapped him and was using threats and magic to control him. Now they’re back with the imperius, saying that Harry could never love such a monster, an ex Death Eater. Harry continuously denied these accusations whenever they would go out. Draco would get verbally and physically abused when they were out in public, so he just resorted to staying at home, and Harry soon joined him. They were getting angry with how horrible everyone turned after Harry’s confession, and were desperate to put a stop to it.
“I think ‘Mione’s right, mate. This is all still new to both of you. And, I don’t know if it’s just me that feels like this, but things are moving pretty fast between you two. I mean, less than a week in and you two were declared as mates, or whatever. You know you’re practically our brother, Harry, and we’re both always going to be here for you, but you need something else to focus on, I think. You should look into finding a job, or get back into Quidditch or something.” Rom supplied diligently.
Harry turned and ran, Malfoy right on his heels. As the door slammed shut behind them, they could both hear a loud scream of frustration then a loud ruskas as if Snape had just swiped his hand across his desk, causing everything to crash and break on the floor.
Dumbledore looked thoughtful for a moment. “She told you a prophecy.” He didn’t phrase it as a question.
And with that, something in Draco cracked. He had been so nice to Harry this entire time, doing everything possible to make him feel comfortable. He was new to this too. He was going through the same problems as Harry was. If they hadn’t gotten married, they would’ve both died. They knew this. But Harry was insistent on being a little shit to Draco, like he blamed Draco for this. Yeah, the first few years they knew each other, they weren’t civil in any sense, but that was when they were younger. Draco had since apologized to Harry for being so nasty towards him, and they had a few good times over the last year or two.
When he finally came up for air, Draco was hard, leaking, and panting from the exertion just made on his prick.
“That’s not funny, you poop.”
“There you go, baby. Take my cock sweetheart.”
“Hi.”
With the professionalism he’d perfected since owning his shop, he walked up to the Savior and greeted him.
He raised an eyebrow and said “Yes, it was. And I thanked him for it.” She sat on the back of the couch, staring at him with an expression he couldn’t quite read. He wanted her to get to the point of her visit. Clearly it was important if Harry wasn’t accompanying her. “Granger, why are you here?” He asked in a tired voice.
When he was going to change into his swim trunks, it dawned on him; he didn’t bring any. Not being told in advance where they were going for their ‘honeymoon’, Harry didn’t know to pack any with him.
“Harry, what’re you doing?”
“You don’t know?” Harry said.
“Refreshing.” Draco said after untying his shoes. He grabbed a glass of water and made his way to the bedroom. Harry followed.
Once she got to the bathroom after her trek alone, Hermione instantly noticed something was wrong. For one, the magic in the air was sharp and sparking, and two, Malfoy was passed out face down on the floor, covered in what looked like vomit.
“They’re right, you know.” Draco said, examining and picking at his nails like the rich prick Harry remembered him to be. At the slightly confused look, Draco continued. “You need a hobby. A job, Quidditch, an activity to keep you focused on something important. I can take care of myself. I am a grown man, after all.” He retorted Hermione’s words. “You need to focus on yourself, rather than wasting your life away in this shack,” he looked straight at Harry then, with an annoyed or angry expression (Harry couldn’t tell), “with me.”
"Bye Harry."
Harry’s eyebrows knitted tightly together at the question. Alright? No he wasn’t bloody alright! His head hurt, his throat was dry, his lungs burned and his greatest nemesis was on top of him, pretending to care.
Harry hid behind Hermione, who had her wand drawn in case the blond decided to launch himself at Harry again. She could be scary, when provoked. Dean lifted the spell, and Malfoy’s features immediately softened.
“Um, Draco, there’s a man asking for you.” Chick, one of Draco’s apprentices, came into the back room to alert him. Draco liked Chick, he was even gayer than Draco.
“What is that?” He asks breathlessly, gesturing to the orb.
Malfoy shifted into his own space, away from Harry, filled his plate with breakfast, and ate in silence until they left for class.
Harry surged forwards and grabbed Draco, wrapping his whole, massive body around the blond’s smaller one. He glared at everyone around them before looking down at Draco.
They were both smiling like idiots, but neither made another move.
I haven't read this since July so sorry if some thing's are off. Enjoy!
“Yes. Am I not allowed to use my senses to figure out how to approach such a complex situation regarding your frequent moodiness?”
“Mhmm.”
Harry blinked up at him before shutting his eyes tightly and taking in a few deep breaths. Eventually he spoke “Nightmare.”
“Well it’s only proper, seeing as we’re mates, soon to be bonded.” Draco said with a hopeful glint in his eye.
After he had finished up with his paperwork and had locked up his shop, Draco stepped out into the dark evening, and made his way to the pool hall across the road.
“Is that all you want? I could plan something bigger, I could invite-”
Draco couldn’t stop the tears from falling.
The blond chuckled “I decided we needed to take it up a notch.” and he was grinning. GRINNING, the cheeky bastard.
“Where? I don’t- oh, Harry. My Harry!” Draco exclaimed, trying to extract himself out of Madame Pomfrey’s grip.
Draco squeezed his hand before removing it from his cheek but still held onto it. He interlaced their fingers and took in a shaky deep breath. “Ok.” He looked back to Harry. “But, I think it's you.”
Weasley eyed it suspiciously. “Parkinson, that gossiping witch? I forgot you two were close.”
“I understand professor, but I’m not equipped to watch over Malfoy. He’s gonna eat me! Did you see his lust-filled eyes?” Harry asked, horror marring his face.
Harry smiled up at her. “Hi, Mione! I’m alright, doing better. How are you? Where’s Ron?”
“Hermione’s pregnant.” Ron said.
Draco didn’t know what came over him in the next moment, but before he could stop himself, his hand found its way to the back of Harry’s neck and he brought their lips together. Immediately Harry returned the pressure and they shared a close-mouthed, world crushing kiss. Draco didn’t want to break away, but it’s almost as if his mind snapped back to reality and he pulled away. Without glancing at the other boy, he quickly turned around and left the kitchen, leaving a breathless Harry alone for the second time that day.
The evening went by with more laughs and drinking than Draco had had in a long time. Although Gryffindors were brash, obnoxious, and sometimes insanely stupid, they were also fun, and crazy, and ridiculously great friends.
“Yeah, but that was just because I threatened to leave him.” he replied.
“Oh. Why are you so hot? I'm not.”
“But you were joking.” Ron supplied.
Harry thumbed his cheeks and kissed him again, less rough, but with just as much passion as before.
Sape pinched the bridge of his nose in agony. “Sectumsempra: to cut or slice by sword. If he was hurt physically, which is what it was intentionally made for, he would’ve been cut to pieces as if hit by a sword. Since it wasn’t though, his mind has now taken the damage. It as severed all that is reality to him. He can not, and will not control himself. If you don’t want to be covered in blond Malfoy until he’s fixed, I suggest you STAY AWAY.” And with that, Snape left the hospital wing without a glance back, leaving Harry to question all that is magic and how it got him into this mess.
Harry joined them in the living room, a dish towel drying his hands. “Hiya guys, how are you doing?” he asked, greeting Ron with a brotherly handshake and Hermione with a hug. “How are your parents doing?”
“Do you want me to?” It was said jokingly. Harry ran a hand up and down Draco’s torso.
She peered behind Harry to see Draco Malfoy and many shopping bags at his feet. “I see. Had fun, did you?” She laughed.
She shook her head. “No, I’m not mad. Extremely confused, but not mad. I didn’t know you two have grown so close over the past few days.”
“I can knock your pants off, if you want.”
This chapter isn't that great, but I'm going to update this story again really soon!!
Please review :)
“Well, I was just saying to Draco, how suspicious this whole situation is. I did some research-”
“And what's wrong with maroon?” Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.
“Get away, he needs to breathe. Granger, Weasley, help me out here.” That’s when he noticed the other heads of his closest family and friends worriedly standing over him. Draco turned back to him and placed a warm hand on his cheek. “Are you alright?”
"What did Kingsley want?" Hermione and Ron bombarded him with questions as Hermione looked Harry over, worriedly. Ron wore the same expression and they seemed to completely ignore Draco's presence.
Draco looked up with a smile “I'd love that.” Harry leaned down and pecked him, then kissed him again, more deeply this time. Draco responded immediately, pressing back with equal force.
“Ah, well, here she is,” Draco said, waving his arm around to exaggerate his statement.
Harry’s heart thumped painfully at the thought of his mate alone at home.
Harry grabbed his hands and kissed them with so much love. He didn’t say anything for a while, but Draco knew he wanted to.
When he turned around to face the rest of the mailing room, he came face to face with one of the men that were working.
Draco removed his lips from the tan skin before replying with a simple “You.” And he rolled his hips, pressing their groins closer together.
Ron came straight from the kitchen, a towel over his shoulder, and a big grin on his face.
“Strip and lay on your belly.” Draco whispered against Harry’s ear.
“Er, yes. Afterwords, she seemed to fall out of some sort of trance, and acted as if nothing happened. I doubt you’ll get much from her, but I am very curious about what this all means.”
Draco didn’t know what was awaiting him in England, but he knew that as long as he had Harry, he could get through anything. His love had been proof of that.
So, Draco tried a different approach. He ripped the pages off of Harry's lap, straddled him and kissing him furiously before Harry could even make out a squeak.
“Good morning.” Harry said softly.
“Better than ‘gay Gryffindor’.” Potter laughed again.
“Hmm, we could even have a Quidditch pitch built on a reserve. A small one of course, but one that we could practice on, and that I could kick your butt on.” Draco giggled.
“Hey, baby-” Harry began but was cut off by a seething Draco.
"He can stay with me." Harry blurted out. Kingsley and Draco's gazes snapped his way immediately. Harry shuffled awkwardly as he inwardly scolded himself. "I mean, I've got all of Grimmauld place to myself. It's actually quite empty." He shrugged, dropping his gaze to the tiled floor. "I don't know, just a thought." He offered.
Draco shuddered. “I needed to talk to you.”
“I don’t know what I am.” She put her cup down and laced her fingers together. “I’m surprised that this happened; confused how it did; questioning what could’ve made you talk to him before I had a chance too. Knowing you, you would’ve scared him off. But, if you two are able to get over your past and differences, then I guess... I’m happy for you. As long as you’re treating each other well, that is.”
“It’s ok if you don’t.” Draco interrupted.
Finally, Draco gestured towards the table. “You hungry?”
“Well, this is it.” Hermione said.
Harry felt his cheeks heat and his heart clench. He breathed deeply before replying "I think you deserve a second chance." He said with a shrug. "Now go shower, I'll make dinner."
Draco and Harry loved each other immensely, and although a prophecy was to thank for bringing the two together, it certainly wasn’t needed for them to show how they truly felt about one another.
“I’m going to miss it too.” Harry said.
He preferred to mix his own colour, like the actual pigments. With a little help from magic, obviously. He loved being creative with different shades. But his favourite was highlights. He could highlight like it was no one’s business (except for his).
“Because. I get bad nightmares. Sometimes they still get through, but the potion helps a lot.”
“The Prophet?” Ron asked incredulously.
He knew he was probably being ridiculous. This gorgeous man who he loved, was all over him. And like always, he had to ruin it. Why did he have to be like that? Clearly Harry didn’t want Draco the way he wanted Harry. Why couldn’t Draco just accept the way Harry wanted him? Why did he have to go and put feelings into everything?
Harry pushed Draco down and onto his back again, although less forceful, and climbed over top of him.
The two of them had retreated to their room, or Sirius’ old room, once Hermione and Ron left for the night. Sirius had gifted Grimmauld to Harry after he went to live with his best friend and long time boyfriend, Remus.
“Ok, love, the cab is here. We have to get all this packed up to take to the airport.” Draco said to Harry as he came out of the bedroom with their bags.
“Harry.” Ron whined. “What do I do?” He was no longer sick, so Harry vanished the contents from the bucket.
“Just the fact that I swallowed your come last night and now you can’t stand to be in the same room as me.” Draco choked. “Did I do something wrong?” Harry walked up to the blond and wrapped his arms around his waist.
“Mmmm.” was all Harry could reply.
“Yeah, he does have a knack for short-forming things, or nicknaming people.” Hermione said.
“Ok, I like potioneering.”
But Draco was still a little upset. He was proud to be with Harry, and if they were to spend the rest of their lives together as mates, everyone would eventually find out anyways, whether they would tell the press themselves or they would be spotted together in public, grocery shopping or taking a walk in the park, holding hands or sneaking quick kisses to each other.
“Well, you passed out, but I hadn’t noticed until just before I came. I tried to pull out but I ended up… well coming, anyways. I pulled out right after and brought you here. I cleaned everything up, and turned out you'd came too. It was all over my drawers.” Harry laughed again. “I feel really bad though, I’m really sorry I let things continue…”
“Yes, we’re doing very well Kingsley. Thanks for asking. Are we all set to start, then?” Harry asked.
The sneer doesn’t throw me off, because he still has that look in his eyes. Both of them. The look he had at Hogwarts, the look he had on our first date, the look he had when he fucked me hard, the look he had when I left him for the trillionth time. The look he’s always had when he looks at me.
“I know.” She smiled big at him.
“Ten to one. Lunch is almost over. Do you want to go back, or stay here?” Harry asked, walk-in to his desk to place some papers on top.
“Sod off, Ron. Yeah, yeah, make your fun.” he said as Ron continued to laugh.
Harry gaped at him. “Oh my god. I can’t with you.”
Since they were already naked, no undressing was required. Draco pushed Harry onto the bed and crawled over top of him.
“Harry!” He shouted, but above the constant chattering and voices that flooded the Auror offices at a never ending rate, it wasn’t a very loud shout, barely making it over the voices of the other Aurors.
“I’m not interested. Go fuck some other Auror, whore.” He spits.
“C’mon mate, come back to us. That’s it.” Ron, he knew, was closer to him. As he blinked warily, he realized that it was Ron who was holding him up. His eyelids seemed heavier than he thought, and his brain was pounding proudly within its confines of his skull.
“You ok?” Harry asked sleepily.
Harry did as told, Draco getting off of him momentarily so he could shift as needed.
Although they were a twisted mix of emotional chemistry, Draco was hurting desperately and he was still Harry’s husband. Harry couldn’t help himself. He kneeled down beside Draco, pulled his hands from his eyes, and before Draco could do anything, he kissed him. A full on the mouth, hard and desperate kiss. Harry wound an arm around Draco to steady him, and continued to kiss him with all his might.
“No, I’m going to wait until you're mine, baby.My bonded Omega.” Harry said sweetly, squeezing Draco for effect.
Draco sighed, hummed and hawed. “Maybe some sausage and french toast?”
After lubing up and fingering Harry to ensure he was stretched enough, Draco pushed forward and slowly entered his husband.
Apparently not. She just raised an eyebrow.
“Yeah, it’s not going to be easy, but at least we know what to expect and how to handle each situation.” Draco replied.
“You could say that.” Harry said, accepting the drink from Ron.
“You look like your father when you do that.” She commented.
Draco sighed but summoned enough courage to go on “Well, I know we haven't talked about it yet, and I've been thinking about it, I guess. I know we've come close a few times, but I thought we should talk first. You know, talk about our likes and what we’re comfortable with, everything. I totally understand if you don't want to talk about it right now though, I just thought I'd bring it up-” Draco's rambling was cut off as Harry grabbed his face and kissed him hard.
The interview was coming to a close as Anne, the interviewer, said she had a few final questions for him. She’d already asked the exact same or very similar questions to those that Draco came up with, regarding Harry’s employment, position in the ministry, any present or future projects he planned to put into action, and many, many more. She also briefly asked about Hermione and Ron, another thing Draco was right about. But she was yet to ask about his love life, something he was dreading.
“I haven’t saved you yet.”
The whole class, including snape, turned their way to regard the outburst.
"Yes, but it seems that the prophecy's physical affects, specifically the pain, started once we returned to England. Does location play a factor in the prophecy's ability to have control over us?" Draco asked, beginning to get flustered over every new piece of information.
“I don’t play with strangers.” Draco said, hitting another ball.
“Mhm.” Draco replied. He took a moment to wake up and regain his senses. He felt drained.
“Malfoy, we have to get to class,” Harry said, walking backwards toward the bedroom.
Harry didn’t have a plan, just that he was going to confront the blond about what happened with the cursed necklace. When he approached the bathroom and finally got a clear view of Malfoy, he watched him for a moment; he was nothing but a scared kid, unaware of what was to become of him with the dangers of war looming over them.
“Are you going to touch me, Harry?” Draco asked once again, after watching Harry lick his lips and palm his crotch.
“What’s in it for me?” Draco asked, not really expecting anything, just wanting to play around with Harry.
"Morning." Harry said as he walked in and went straight to the cupboard to get a plate.
“I was just letting you know.” He said affirmatively, masking his attraction for the man in front of him.
A flash of something akin to jealousy made its way through Harry. He wondered how Draco knew that.
She was sitting on Draco’s living room couch, sipping her overpriced chai tea latte with extra whipping foam, nutmeg, and cinnamon grindings. ‘No, it’s not the same as regular cinnamon powder, Draco, you uneducated wench.’ She had come over for lunch, taking up her weekly visit to bring Draco Starbucks and the new Ministry gossip.
“Gentleman, ma’am, might I introduce Mrs Arri Walkins, Second to Head of the Spell-Damage Ward here at the hospital.”
“Yeah, I know. He’s done a lot for me, you know? It took me some time, but I finally got over myself and saw what a great guy he is. He treats me well. Sometimes I think I don’t deserve him, you know?”
Draco became breathless at Harry’s words and his claims. The way Harry feels about Draco is the same way Draco feels about Harry. Harry Controls Draco, apparently as Draco controls Harry. “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.” Draco says quietly.
“Draco,” His eyes widened at the use of his first name. “I know this is a sensitive topic with you, but we’re worried about you. I’d like to talk with you, please.”
“What’d you talk about?”
At this point, Harry wasn’t sure what Snape was asking of him when he asked to meet him after class. If Snape wasn’t going to add to his punishment (which Harry was grateful for, mind you), he didn’t know what the Professor was getting at.
“Why?” He asked softly.
“What was that?” He asked, watching the brunette try and get more comfortable.
“Head Auror can do whatever he wants.” Harry said.
For now, he relished in the feeling of Harry, and the love that grew just a little bit more.
“You did this?” Harry asked, surprised.
Now, seeing Potter here in his beloved shop, had set off an onslaught of emotions and feelings resurfacing, not for the first or last time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ok, Malfoy, whatever you say.” Potter said, he was still smirking.
“I might.” Draco repeated himself.
“Shut it, Malfoy.”
Harry entered and the big smile returned on his face once he caught sight of Draco. He scooped him up in a big hug and kissed him passionately. They stood there for a few moments, lost in each other before Draco pulled back, and bent over practically coughing up a lung.
“Hermione?” She heard the medi-witch call from the hallway. “I brought along Professor McGonagall to help since she’s your head- oh, my dear! Mr. Malfoy? What happened?” Madame Pomfrey ran over and immediately started casting stasis and restorative spells over the limp boy, before levitating him to bring him to the hospital wing.
Harry sat back on his heels, cast a quick Scourgify, and pulled Draco into his arms, holding him tightly.
I’d love to know your thoughts on this new addition. Please review!
“Oh, because that was coming anytime soon.” Harry laughed.
“I didn’t expect you to take it seriously.”
He stood and grabbed Draco’s hand, then dragged him through the maze of people and offices, around a few corners, and down a long stretch of hall, all lined with what seemed to be dark, empty conference rooms. He went to the very end of the hall, Alohamora’ed one of the door locks, and ushered them both inside. Once he had secured the door with his own locking spells (which seemed excessive to Draco, seeing as he only wanted to talk to him), Harry turned around and was on Draco within a second. He lifted him up by the bum and sat him on the main desk, standing in between Draco’s legs, caressing his hair and neck as he kissed him smoothly.
“And I realize that now. So Draco Malfoy, my Omega, my eternal mate, will you bond with me?”
She nodded, shook his hand, and went on her way. Draco turned to make his way back to Harry’s room, when Hermione’s voice called out to him from down the hall.
“Say it again for me baby.” Draco whispered.
It took Draco a moment to realize what he was talking about. His eyes widened and his jaw slacked slightly. “You told them?”
Walkins’ eyes lit up. “Oh, that's good, then. What have you found out?”
“Harry?” His name rolled off of Draco’s tongue not unlike a foreign language. It was weird to hear it come from the blond.
“In the kitchen, mate.” Harry called back.
“Fuck, Draco! You’re going to be the death of me.” Harry said, wrapping himself around Draco’s bent body, sniffing his neck again.
“NOT for your USE!” Snape growled. His face coming right up to Harry’s. “You don’t realize the repercussions that using that spell could of had. How did you get it, anyways?”
Hermione gave him a stern look before saying "Oh, and flipping out on the Wizengamont Council and getting yourself thrown out of court is 'being careful so far'?" She asked with her hands on her hips.
I regard his fireplace for a moment. A picture capturing us together, unsuspecting, in a rose garden has been removed once again. It was a favourite of mine.
“Boys,” she muttered.
Harry smiled, set the quill down and rested his elbows on the desk. “Well, because I’m an Alpha.” Draco's eyebrows disappeared into his hairline and started gaping like a fish. Not words came out, so Harry continued “Do you know how that works?”
“Hello, darling.” Malfoy drawled.
“What does the spell do?” Harry finally asked.
"Wait, what?!" Hermione asked, incredulously.
Draco walked along the beach for a few hours, enjoying the sun and how it warmed his skin. He took in the breathtaking scenery around their little bungalow. He was thankful for the calm serenity found between every wave of the ocean, grains of sand, and the leaves of the tropical plants that bordered the beach.
He allowed the current to slowly drag him across the reef, while Harry inspected the friendly fish around him.
Nothing seemed to work, so he decided to just go to bed. 7:30 wasn’t that early, right? He changed into his pajamas and washed up. Harry still wasn’t home and the anxiety grew a little more.
Draco Malfoy was a hair stylist. And a damn good one too.
Potter looked at him from the side, a sincere look on his face. He smiled. “You are good at making people feel better about themselves.”
“Did you eat?” Draco asked.
“The one and only.” Ron smirked and took out his work. “Look, mate, we can go to her class later and ask her about it, maybe she’ll remember, or know something more, ok?” Harry could tell Ron was trying to be supportive and helpful, more than Hermione who was muttering away at her potions assignment.
‘Draco’s Hair Studio’ was a hit to all: young, old, muggle, wizard (discreetly, of course), and the financially unavailable.
Draco wanted a full minute while Harry adjusted to him, before slowly adding another inch. Harry again had to stop and adjust.
“Do you need to get back to work?” Draco asked suddenly.
Long awaited chapter. I’ve actually had this waiting for the longest time, I just didn’t know how to end it. Hope you enjoyed :)
“Harry, baby, Harry! Oh no, no, no, you don’t get to do this to me.” Draco freaked, as he watched over his husband.
“You said after we got jobs, and we just got approved for them.”
“It’s alright.” Draco said, sitting up. He looked up at Harry and saw that his eyes had returned to normal and that the air seemed steady and calm. “I’ll survive.” He smiled a little.
We say words like “I love you” and “you’re the one”, and while we both mean it, we don’t stick to our promises.
Draco kept rolling his hips, trying to press closer to Harry with every move. Finally he went back to kissing the raven-haired beauty while he tried pulling down his pyjama bottoms and boxers in one go.
Draco pulled back and looked at him. “But…”
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, so.”
“Give me an answer, Draco! We both know the answer.” Harry said.
“I’m pulling out.” Draco said in fear that he hurt Harry.
Draco sighed, relieved. “I should call for a medi-witch.” he said, making his way to stand up.
“Touche, Head Auror Potter.” Draco kissed him before throwing powder into the fireplace and shouting out his residence.
“Oh, no you don’t.” SHe whispered in his ear. “You need to accept the consequences of this, Harry. Stay put.”
“Ok.” Draco copied, a toothy smile reflecting back.
Harry had barely stuck his nose against Draco’s skin before he was GROWLing against the pale skin, and rutting roughly against Draco’s thigh.
The water shut off then, signalling Draco had finished. Harry closed the door and sat back on the bed to give him some privacy. It wasn’t really needed though.
Harry was debating on looking for trunks in Draco’s suitcases, but he was pretty sure they wouldn’t fit. (Mostly because Harry was of a thicker build than that of his husband.) So Harry went with the only other option he could think of.
The auror repeated his counting before telling Kingsley again. A slight smirk graced his lips and Harry leaned forward into the suspense.
I've been working on this for longer than I'd like to admit.
Another thing part of our routine. I always need him, he always hates me for leaving him. We both cry over our mistakes.
“I’m pretty sure I told you I needed to speak with Potter, not you. Why would I tell you what I need to speak to Potter about if I didn’t see him here, only you, and still haven’t told you what is so important as to why I’m here? Also, Pansy gave me a pass.” He said, rolling his eyes to the side and holding up his little paper pass.
“Weasley.” Draco said, shaking his head.
“Hi, Draco. Hope you had a good time?” Hermione asked.
“I’m telling you, guys, somethings off. He went from being shy and reserved, to grinding on me. Not that I’m adverse, but it’s just weird.” Harry explained to Ron and Hermione over a Floo call. He decided that after Draco’s odd behaviour from that morning, he needed some advice as to what might be going on.
Feeling a pang in his heart, he bit his lip and nodded. “Ok.” He went to sit on the edge of the bed again but Harry quickly shuffled over, making room for him to lie down next to him. Draco just looked at the spot, then to Harry, then back again. “I don’t know..” he whispered. "Are you sure?” Harry just looked at him expectantly. He sighed and lay down beside him. “Don’t expect me to do this every night. I like my own bed to sleep in.”
“Why are you two pushing this?! I don’t want it! I don’t want him! I don’t want this life anymore!” He screamed as the tears started up again.
When it was time for a break, everyone left the mailing room, leaving Draco alone. Frankly, he didn’t know what to do. He had no idea what Harry was doing. Harry was probably still working or had his break at another time, but he didn’t want to stay down in the basement for the hour he had off for his lunch break. So, Draco wandered up to Harry’s floor, hoping to catch him at a free moment.
I've always wanted to run through the fields
“Because, what are you going to do about it? I feel like I’m dying! I’m even having damn seizures, all because of a stupid damn prophecy that had to- just had to pair me with you! Of all people!”
He would’ve owled his mother, asking his many unanswered questions, but she didn’t know much about her family’s breeding and genes. He’d have to figure this out on his own, something he really didn’t want to do. It’s not like he’d go to Harry anytime soon. What would he do for him?
“That couch is not suitable for sleeping. Don’t get any ideas, though. This is my last resort.” Harry huffed and pulled the covers over his head.
Draco let out another sneeze, much like the first, which caused a few muffled snickers from the boy behind him.
"What are we going to do with him?" Hermione asked shaking her head.
“How should I know? If I stayed any longer, he would’ve probably eaten me or something.”
He turns back to Potter and crosses his arms in a silent signal for him to begin his explanation.
“Harry, hun? Is everything alright?”
“You don’t like being an Auror?” Draco asked, genuinely shocked that Potter was trying to prove that Draco had the better career choice than him.
Draco shifted and hummed softly. “Yeah.”
Weasley’s eyebrows practically disappeared into his hairline as he saw Harry wrap himself around Draco.
“So,” Harry mimicked.
“No!” Harry yelled. “Absolutely not! How would I be able to alter a curse I had no knowledge about what it did in the first place? And Malfoy? Why would I have chosen him to be my, what did you call it? Oh, play thing. Of all people, you think I’d choose Malfoy! Hell, I don’t want to be in charge of taking care of anyone, let alone him!” Harry was in shock. He couldn’t believe he was being blamed for purposefully causing this big mess. “I’m sorry, Professor. I really, really didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I don’t know why it did. Madame Pomfrey said it was because his mental state was more fragile in the moment than his physical one, so that’s why it had happened the way it did. I swear, you can see for yourself. Use a pensieve, Veritaserum, I don’t care. I just didn’t do it on purpose.”
“Do you have any idea how attracted to you I am?” Harry whispered into Draco’s collarbones.
The dick in his hand jumps as he stands. He pushed Harry’s legs up to his chest to reveal a beautiful dark, furled hole without a trace of hair around it. Draco sucks in a breath at the sight. Before he can do anything, he bent forward and licked a long stripe all the way to Harry’s bullocks.
Draco blushes, then leads him to the sink to wash his very long and lustrous hair.
“I don’t know, I just thought I’d ask.” Harry shrugged.
He stared at them defeatedly, wiping tears from his face once more, pressing the heal of his hands into his eyes. After a moment they both heard a whispered “ok.”
“You know that Draco’s going through some changes still, right? Not only will his actions be compromised, but his mental and emotional states as well. You’re fully manifested, but his body is still new to being in the presence of such a powerful Alpha. Give him time, and the benefit of the doubt.” Hermione explained intelligently.
“I didn’t even think of that.” Harry laughed, blushing red. “Did you really see me?”
“Mmm.” Was Draco’s response.
Harry smiled at him. “You were a great sport.” He said, gripping his bum one more time.
“Honey, I’m home!” Harry shouted when he and Draco walked through Ron and Hermione’s Floo.
Harry sighed and shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. He’s doing ok. We’re doing ok. I talked to Kingsley today, he’s gonna shut it down.”
“No need to worry Potter. It’s quite alright. I hope I can help you with whatever it is you need.” Kingsley replied, folding his hands on top of his pristine desk.
Regaining his composure, he shook her off. “I’m not telling you a thing, you nosy pug.”
“What the hell are you two on about?” Ron asked, looking between them with mild horror.
"I'd like that." A grin.
“What time is it?” Draco asked suddenly, totally unaware he fell asleep.
Enjoy!
“I love you too, honey.” He captured the smaller man’s mouth in his and promptly started thrusting.
Harry’s eyes widened as the realization dawned on him. “You seriously don’t think... it could not be .... MALFOY?!” He sat there, mouth gaping and brows furrowed.
“Madame Pearings, I would be delighted if you stayed to assist me in this meeting.” Walkins said. Pearings nodded, but stood by the door with her hands linked in front of her. She nodded towards the woman.
Ron had to undo his Incarcerous for Harry to take over, which thankfully, Malfoy stayed in place for.
“What? Do you know what’s wrong?” He asked.
It was a few hours later, after Harry had decided to grab lunch alone at a nearby cafe, of which he ate on a park bench while watching his surroundings.
Harry, after watching his friends leave, turned back to the blond and said, "well, come on then." before he walked towards the Floo networks. He barely caught a glimpse of blond following behind him through the long, twisting corridors.
“Yes, pleasure to meet you.” He greeted back with a firm handshake.
“I thought you didn’t want me with you?”
Harry sighed. “I know you’re mad-”
“You can’t see him. They took him away and said they’ll come back when you can.” Draco says, looking ahead, at neither of them, repeating what the one medi-witch had said. He sat there, dressed and alone, because they took Harry away from him at Grimmauld. He threw on clothes, sent a patronus to the two of them, and followed them seconds later through the Floo where they’d entered, but was forced back and watched as Harry was wheeled down and away from him. Always away.
Draco laughed. A full out, very unattractive and very inappropriate for such a fancy restaurant, guffaw. Harry peaked a little smile, too.
“That night, I had met up with a few work friends when they had finished their shift. That’s why I was a little late meeting you. We had a few drinks and talked a bit before I said I had to go. I didn’t want to say I was going on a date, but they had strung it out of me. I refused to say who it was with though, knowing they’d take the shit on me. It’s just who they are. Since I wouldn’t say who I was going out with, Seamus, you remember him from school, he’d cast a revelio-type charm that enhances one’s feelings. It’s a stupid prank that we used to pull on each other in school. Someone had found it in the restricted section at Hogwarts once, I don't know how.
Harry smiled above him. “I thought we were going to live at Grimmauld.”
“No, you’re right.” He smiled. “Looks like you’re going to be… tied up for a while, Malfoy.”
Harry stared at him incredulously, before reining himself in. “You’re staying there tonight,” he said before he ran off to the bedroom, Malfoy’s voice of ‘what are you afraid of!’ echoing behind the closed door.
