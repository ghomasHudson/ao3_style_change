, and there’s nothing I want less right then, and I think about just getting it over with, but I don’t want the sex hangover that comes with it, but then I’m scared about what it’ll mean for us in the long run, so I want to, but I don’t want to—” Harry stopped then, suddenly empty for words. “I—” he put his face in his hands. “Honestly, I feel like I’ve gone round the bend,” he eventually added, speaking into his palms instead of looking at Gladys, aware that his gut felt kind of full and his chest warm, as if he hadn’t been pouring words out, but in.
excuse,” Harry said because right now he was inclined to think that everything Malfoy did was fantastic. There was some odd quality to him, like he was a taut string on the verge of breaking. But he was right there, with his red cheeks and perfectly coiffed hair and hesitant look, and he’d said he wanted to be
The laneway was near a station on the Northern Line, so getting to Camden was quick. Draco, who hadn’t been on the tube before, was fascinated with the turnstiles and the Oyster cards, and was delighted when he got his to work so he could go through. Harry forgot to be nervous for a moment, watching how pleased Draco was with himself, and how much he enjoyed the entire journey.
“Of course I suppose you know all about Muggles and science,” he said. “So it must seem silly to you.”
The fact Hermione was alternating between water and non-alcoholic drinks didn’t go unnoticed for long, and soon the mood had turned celebratory; they were the first from their year to have kids.
To his astonishment, they both flushed bright red, but instead of it being some kind of awkward embarrassment, it appeared to be a symptom of acute delight and pride.
Five minutes before closing, Harry made his way to the reading hall to chase out stragglers and discovered that only Malfoy had remained. Harry sorted the 5th century seafaring maps left by an enthusiast from Cork—fine fellow, but incapable of following instructions—into their trolley, and then went to Malfoy.
“Looks like your date went well?” Ginny commented in a low voice as she handed him the clipboard. One name had been crossed off already, with equipment marked as returned.
“That’s when you disappeared,” Harry said. Part of him was horrified, that a person could just stop like that, that it could happen to someone so normal as Draco—but he’d seen the effects of war and trauma first-hand during his community service. For it to happen after a death of a parent didn’t seem so outlandish after all. “Pansy stopped talking about what you’d been up to, and you didn’t show at any…well, anywhere.”
Both Hugh and Betty ambled over, Hugh’s chin definitely wobbling. He was going to cry, Harry knew with certainty. Thankfully he also knew that Hugh was a silent crier, so he wouldn’t have to deal with the noise of it. He told them to sit.
“Your—you weren’t literally locked in a cupboard under the stairs!” Harry burst out, the din in his ears having returned. He was dimly aware that what he was hearing was actually the rush of his own blood, but that was inconsequential. “You weren’t forced to cook breakfast for the family while receiving only scraps yourself, you didn’t get the bloody cupboard door slammed over your fingers for nothing, you didn’t—” Harry’s voice broke and clammed up; no way he was showing Peony any kind of emotion over this other than anger.
“All right,” Harry said, setting the fear aside for now. He looked at the copy in his hand. “So…what else should I bring up for you? Do you want to continue with the Irish coroner reports?”
“Nobody ever died of blue balls,” Draco said. “No, seriously,” he continued when Harry was going to protest. “Getting laid is not worth it to me if it hurts you.”
Harry’s brain was still in the process of rewriting itself to think of Dudley as Peony, and not Dudley. He mentally ran over his schedule. Between work, Quidditch, school, his friends, and Draco, he didn’t know how he’d fit Dud—Peony in. Maybe if he brought someone? Would Draco want to? Maybe not. But Harry wasn’t entirely sure bringing either Ron or Hermione would be a smart move; both of them were liable to swing their fists. Hermione had good aim. “I’ll think about it. Bringing someone, I mean. Uh, I’m really busy though, I don’t know…when were you thinking?”
He read the article again from the beginning, absorbing everything, underlining words and phrases as he tried to figure out how it applied to him. At the end he paused again.
Harry was tired, not because he’d slept badly, but because he’d stayed up until two in the morning reading the science fiction novel Malfoy had lent him. He’d drawn up a bath and thrown in his last bath bomb (a sunset bomb with lavender and other things, designed to calm and induce sleep), and had only come out of the bath when the water had cooled completely, and he was tired enough to almost drop the book into it. Harry had dragged himself to bed, then, with the scent of lavender in his hair and faint glitter residue on his skin following him there.
“Definitely.” Lee whooped. “Yes! Thank you. We were going crazy taking turns staying in with the kids.”
“Was that dramatic enough for everyone?” Blaise then said, amused, and moved past the topic. “Good to see you, Draco. This is Gilliam, the most perfect boyfriend in history and also the love of my life.”
, you are wrong. Where did you get the idea that you don’t get to have this?” He gestured between them. “This is real.”
Then she hopped off her broom and inspected the Snitch as if she’d just picked up a particularly interesting bug and was cradling it in her palms.
“They don’t.” At Harry’s nonplussed look, Malfoy explained further: “Only captured elves serve wizards. House-elves are hard to catch, and because they belong to the house—and they don’t tend to move into a house until it’s been inhabited for a while—circumstance led to it being only wealthy and skilled wizards and witches who could capture one, the wealth being a prerequisite for owning and living in a house that was both inhabited by elves and passed down generations, and then of course the skill was a prerequisite for capturing one in the first place.”
Well. That was certainly something. Harry collected his change from the phone and sank onto the nearest bench. Had the last five minutes of his life been
Guilt rose up in Harry along with the tears, but so did all his complicated anger and hurt that he’d come to realise was woven around Ginny in this fine, invisible cloud. And yet…if she was so determined to talk, Harry would fucking talk. “All right,” he said, snappish and grumpy and heartsick, and petty enough to want to push that pain outwards. “But I want it known for the record that I did
Remus ate his breakfast quickly. He felt hungry despite he ate a lot at dinner. He sat and sipped his coffee and looked at the view outside from his window. He needed to read James and Sirius's will. He took the letter from the drawer and carefully opened his letter. He read James's letter first.
"Uhm maybe Molly or Dumbledore? Last time I went to Gringotts, she's the one who gave the goblin my key. The other one was Hagrid when I was eleven. And what do you mean monthly withdrawal? I never went to my vault since third year." Harry was clueless.
Remus missed James so bad. He was his brother. Dorea kind of adopted him when he's in sixth year when his parents died. Remus and James was close. Closer than Sirius. Sirius maybe his mate but he felt more comfortable with James.
Though Remus confused, he followed them without hesitation. They arrived in the Severus's chamber and sat on the sofa in the small living room. Severus's new chamber was different from his chamber when he was teaching defense back then.
Draco didn't waste the time. He grinded their lengths together with his right hand playing its head. Harry moaned loudly. Draco kissed his spine, caressing his bud, kneading, rubbing, pinching with his left hand that still under Harry's body. Then he turned Harry's body to half face him so he could sucked the red buds. Harry hissed at the sensation. Draco had a clever way with his tounge, Harry almost came only from this. Draco speed up their joint frictions, he kissed Harry's mouth hard, invite him to a heavy snogging. Draco grunted. He almost climax. He flipped Harry to made him lay on his stomach, he pulled Harry's hip to rose higher and continue to thrush his length between Harry's thighs. Their balls met, sending pleasure to both of them, Harry moaned so loud. The pleasure was so much for him. Maybe even Narcissa heard that from her room.
Lucius apparated to Gringotts, while Severus and Remus used floo network that connected to Headmistress office. Severus and Remus stepped out from the Floo network and greeted Minerva.
"Thank you. I believe that you have same visions with us. You are welcomed here. You will stayed here and we will have our discussion about this matter later."
Draco was stunned with mouth opened wide. He couldn't believe his mother. Now he understood why Severus told him to tell his mother. Not because she would against it or talked some sense to Draco but for this. Narcissa turned into some party geek. Sighed. He suddenly felt his headache coming. His simple proposal wouldn't look good with this grand bonding ceremony.
The goblins moved their unconscious body to healing room beside the cleansing room. The only goblin healer was ready to examined the after effects. It would take a time before the both Omega regained their conscious.
For the next couple days Lucius, Severus, and Remus had a long and heated discussions in Lucius's study room. They didn't let Harry and Draco in so Narcissa brought them to France for shopping.
He no longer sad and devastated. He remembered James with fond smile. He had cried too much. He wouldn't mourn James anymore. He cherished his loved and his time with James back then. He was grateful to James for giving him love and Harry as their son. He was grateful he could have his memories back. He told Harry that he could remembered James with smile now. Harry was grateful his mother never blamed him and even asking for apologies for lashed out at him because of their resemblance. Harry too never blamed Severus for forgetting him. It wasn't his fault. It was that old coot faults.
Remus stayed in the woods for few years until Dumbledore called him over and offered him a job to be a teacher in Hogwarts. He was so grateful and happy. He also met Sirius after few years. Last time they met when in James's funeral. They hooked up again and it's better than when they're young. Their relationship still on and off but because they're older they tried to not fuck too much and with Harry between them made they're more like partner. Harry thought they're just his father best friends. They didn't try to told him the truth. They're not in relationship just together.
"Harry, Love. This hands are beautiful. I want to hold this hand forever. I want to be the only one who can hold your hands like this. I want to tie invincible rope so we will always hand in hand. Your hand fit perfectly with my hand. Love, I want to be by your side, to help you, to love you, to cherish you, to aid you, to reassure you, to be your pillar, to be your back, to be your armor, to be the only one whom you love, to be your everything. Meeting you is the best day of my life. To be with you is the best choise I've made. I can't imagine my life without you. Harrison James Prince-Potter be my lifetime mate." Draco slipped a beautiful ring on Harry's finger and then kissed both the ring and Harry's hand.
"Sstt. Let make today be a perfect day. Shall we?" Harry started to rubbed his hands ok Draco's bare chest. Draco moved to lay on his back and let Harry lead the way.
Minerva closed the door looked flustered. She was a widow. She didn't envy their relationship but she's a shy person and didn't know how to act when she saw some PDA.
Both reached Remus's new chamber. He stayed near the forest so he could run inside when full moon. The chamber was simple with cream color theme. The room looked warm and fresh with woods furniture. Moony looked pleased with the arrangement.
for more than an hour and we will be late for our date. You don't want to be late. do you love? " Draco talk to bewildered Harry with his signature smirk on his lips.
"So now it settled. We will have revenge, and make them taste their own medicine. We need strategy to make them suffer." Lucius's eyes glints evilly.
Lucius and Narcissa took the parchment from Draco, they read it with frown face. They couldn't believe what they saw. How could someone as delicate as Harry being treated like that? How could they who called themselves light wizard who always talked about justice and equal treatment of all kind of wizard did something cruel, evil, unacceptable. How could they didn't notice anything about Severus. They've been known him since at Hogwarts. Maybe Severus been obliviated and forget about James. The anger was oblivious. They were ready to crucioed them.
Harry and Severus put in the same place as they have the most blocks and spell and compulsions. They dranks the similar potion. Severus had more spell on him casted by dark wizards too. Harry and Severus drank pain reliever potions, to ease their pain. And drank a potion to make the potion's residue evaporated. They were laying down on their back in the circle runes in the centre of the room. The room full with ancient runes and some goblin language and other foreign language. There were seven goblins surrounding them, put something inside the goblet and pour the liquid over Harry's and Severus's stomachs. They then chants and chants and soon both of them screaming in pain. They're being in fire. They're burning and spasms but the goblins continued their chants and pouring another potions onto their head. They can see there's black smoke coming out from their body, they shuddered then collapsed on the ground.
Draco told them to keep calm and open minded. He told them not to tell Severus. That man needed to take blood test first before they talked about Harry.
Gornnuk back with Draco's parents about fifteen minutes later. They looked worried and puzzled. Lucius and Narcissa had to paused all their works at home to come to Gringotts as soon as they received the letter saying Draco Malfoy needed their helps. Both Narcissa and Lucius were shocked when they not only found Draco but Harry which half lay on Draco's lap. They're trying to asked Gornnuk but the goblin didn't give him a single word. They knew Draco went to meet Harry to celebrate the younger boy's birthday. Narcissa came closer to Draco and talked in hush tone when she looked at the sleeping Harry.
"Oh, don't worry. I will handle that. It's time for Xeno to back to his old family. I will owled him later."
Both Alpha and Omega were lost in similar thoughts. They were still laying on Picnic blanket and entwined their hands. Both closed their eyes looked like sleeping but actually just thinking with closed eyes. They didn't know how long they're been laying there until they heard footsteps walked toward them.
"Dety, I have outdoor party by the end of August. Draco and Harry will tie a knot. It will be special party. Now, prepare the garden near the steeam, it will be less hot over there. I need flower arrangements, decor arrangements, and guests list. I need bunch of roses, lilies, tulips, baby breath, daisies, hydrangeas, lavender, carnations, yellow blossoms, peony. Every kind of flowers. Tell the florist to make it simple but still look grand and classy. You know my favorite. Tell the head chef to make delicious food. Prepare the finest china. Tell the people from home decor to prepare the venue. And I will give you the guests list after I talk to Lucius. Do not disappoint me. I want the best for my son." Narcissa told the house elf with authority.
" Mother, what if I forget my vow?" Harry's trembling voice was heard and make Severus smile at his son sweetly.
"Sure Tipsy. If this requirement is needed then I shall follow the rules. Here, take my wand." Remus said with smiling.
Their friends were so happy though they didn't expect Draco and Harry would get married before they graduated. They already had a hunch about their relationship. They were surprised when they received the invitations but they still genuinely happy for them.
" So since Harry didn't have his vault key in him, Griphook made him take blood test and found out he is not Harry Potter son of James Potter and Lily Evans. He was James and Severus's son. He was stolen and obiviated to be Harry Potter, He was being miss treated. He... well, read it yourselves. " Draco gritted teeth.
"Uhm, Mother? Can I call you that? Or do you prefer Papa?" he asked Severus shyly. He lowered his head afraid of being scolded.
Harry lied on the bed and read a book when Draco came out from the bathroom with only a towel hanging low on his sexy waist. Harry looked at his fiancé's perfect body with wide mouth and in fast closed his mouth and gulped few times. Harry looked at how water dropping slowly from his perfect platinum blond hair to his jaw and his firm chest. Draco has a perfect body. He has nice and firm muscles without too much meat, still slender and tall, no bulky, perfect skin, signature blond hairs that every male Malfoy had. He swallowed his saliva and softly speak to him.
Draco nibbled Harry's ear and sucked a spot behind Harry's left ear and left a red purple color. After he satisfied coloring Harry's neck, he went back to Harry's mouth. Harry moaned at the pleasure. He couldn't stay still. He had to grabbed Draco's arms and clung onto his shoulder. Draco deepen their kisses. Harry was laid on his back underneath Draco. Both Draco's hand on Harry's side. He tried so hard not to touch Harry. He didn't trust himself to be able to control the temptation. The sweet and soft kisses went into heat snogging season.
"Thank you Tipsy. We will be there in a minute. You can go back to the kitchen and start preparing the table." Lucius gave him court nod and the head house elf disappeared.
"Father, mother, please have a seat before I explained why you're needed here. It's a rather long and complicated but short story is I was here to accompany Harry taking his inheritance since he reached his legal age to claim his lordship / heirship. Then when Griphook asked him about his vault key, Harry said he didn't have it. Strange right? We have the same thoughts. I asked him how can, he said he didn't get his key since the first year. Summer first year Hagrid had his key, and since second year Molly Weasley had his key. Harry even didn't go to Gringotts since summer third year yet Griphook received monthly withdrawal from his vault." Their brows furrowed in concern. their eyes went wide.
"Few minutes ago dear. I was trying to see you in your room but I changed my mind when I heard something interesting from inside." He smirked at his son.
He promised to submit himself to Draco. Means he had to study their traditions, study etiquette and manner. Harry wanted to be a good Omega who can stand equal with Draco. He wanted Draco to be proud of him. He didn't want to be his old self. Draco looked regal and graceful. He wanted to be like him. Regal. Not that Draco didn't want him. Draco accepted all his flaws since long time ago. He never scolded him, nor disgusted at his ragged clothes, and never get angry at his unmannered behavior. He just let Harry be Harry. He's now half Malfoy. He would be like a Malfoy. A regal Pureblood who gain respect from not only in Britain but all over the world too. Harry didn't want to make Malfoys embarrassed with his behavior. Harry promised to be a new and better Harry. A smart, delicate and well mannered Omega. He wanted his offspring to be proud of him when they're adults.
Lucius left Severus and Remus and followed Minerva. He told her about his thoughts and Minerva told him about her plan.
After few minutes looking around the chamber they went back to meet Minerva in her office. They wanted to borrowed the floo network. Remus and Minerva talked a bit about teaching arrangement while Severus walking around looking at the paintings. He furrowed his eyebrows when he reached Dumbledore's empty painting. He muttered quiet spell and there's blue fog surrounding the painting. He cast another spell and another until the blue fog gone. He then walked back to Minerva and Remus. They bit a simple goodbye to Minerva and went to Malfoy Manor.
Far inside Harry heard loud hissing come from inside a glass tank. Harry moved closer and hiss back to it. A black tiny snake just hatched. This baby seemed hungry and Harry cooed by its cuteness. Draco could only smile fondly at his Omega. Not far from the hatchling snake Draco heard a low growls, he looked at the sound and found a cat with furs as black as night'sky, a black gleam eyes and long nine tails. Draco was captivated by its beauty. He growled back at the cat like he understands its language. The cat mewl at him and its tails stood proud. Draco automatically opened its cage and scoop the black furs ball onto his chest. They've found their familiars. Draco and Harry went to the counter to pay  for their familiars.
"You're engaged! Congratulations. I give you my blessing. After everything you've been through you deserves happiness and if that's mean being with Draco Malfoy. I haven't known him well but maybe this is the start. I want to know you and Draco more. I give you all my support. You are my honorary brother's son and you're my godson. I want you to be happy. I will be there for you cub. " Remus hugged him and squeezed his arm.
"Okay Mr. Potter here's another way to get your key back and claim your inheritance." He didn't tell the whole truth about it. He need to do blood test.
The both parties were gone to their next destination. Draco and Harry apparated back to the manor after lifted the spell from the back store and Remus Lupin walked towards Gringotts. He wanted to know what young Malfoy means. His wolf side told him something important happened and he's too curious about it. He couldn't let this uneasy feeling off.
"let me tell you something. When your father and I exchanged vows, we did that spontaneously as we were forget what we had to say. So I just say I do and finished. Your gramps laughing so hard until the officiant silenced him." Severus chuckled at his memory. His wedding ceremony with James was held privately but still beautiful. Now his son will start his new journey as Draco's husband. His one and only son, the one he just found few years ago, whom he was cherished is officially adult now. One of the most difficult time is when you watch your children married.
Harry burried his head into Draco's chest. He felt tired after his meltdown. Draco continued releasing his pheromones to make him calmer. The pleasant smell of apple and sandalwood infiltrate Harry's nose. He sighed in content and relaxed himself in Draco's embrace. Draco repositioned Harry on his lap, then swished his wand to make the room back to normal. The papers stacked back on the table, the books and documents saved inside drawers. Chairs and table back to original place. The windows looked like new without any cracks. Griphook woken up and he sat in front of them behind his desk. Draco even summoned three cups of tea for them. He made sure Harry was okay. He gave Harry his cup while asking Griphook to called Malfoy's vaults manager. He needed him with legal laws.
"I know it's hard and painful. I know it's not easy. I can understand. Maybe I never been in your shoes but I had similar experiences with bullying and abused. I know how hurt it was. I know how hard to speak up. I don't know your feelings but I know mine. " then he added "talk to me when you're ready. I hope you can be more open to me and lean on me and learn to trust me." Harry cried in his mother hugs.
"Please take care of my vaults. You can give the business to my new manager. Do as you feel fit. I believe in your judgment. For them who steal my money from my "vault" please punish them according to your law. He said with low growled. His wolf side hard to control. He thought Order of Phoenix was angels and good wizards who only did what light wizard often did.
Sighing, Remus climbed down off his bed, searching a hangover potions to ease his headache. Remus took a shower after drank his potions. He chose to wear his nicest clothes. The Malfoy maybe dark wizards who supported Pureblood Supremacy, but they still respectable family who still holding their traditions. Remus maybe a pureblood but his family lost his respect when he was beaten by werewolf. Not because the creature itself but because his father did something unacceptable by the pureblood society. He hoped the Malfoy wouldn't care about his past though he knew Lucius still an upright person.
Lucius's ancestors were French but the Malfoys moved to Britain few centuries ago and established their name in Britain and became the one of most powerful pureblood family in Britain and France. The Malfoys not only had a huge influence in politics but also in business. Narcissa, the lady from house of ancient and noble Black was a charming witch. She was regal and wicked that made their business partner couldn't refuse her negotiations.
Harry lay on his bed, his hand grip the blue potions, when the clock hit a minute before midnight, Harry drinks his potion, and slowly close his eyes.
They said in same times, Draco cuckled. He was happy. He had a plan to propose Harry. He prayed the proposal will went well.
"Well done son. You are really genius. How can you come out with this idea?" Lucius asked him curiously.
Lucius folded the letter back and finished his jobs in his office in ministry quickly so he could be in Hogwarts in few minutes. He owled Severus back informing his coming. He then called his house elf to prepare his things and then he owled Narcissa that he would stay in Hogwart for few days. He didn't inform his wife his situation. She didn't need extra worry about something unsettled.
"Uhm, mother," Harry looked at Severus. "Uhm.. Could we fabricated the story? I don't want people asking me too many personal questions."
Titan let out a soft hoot and dropped the letter. He stood in front of Harry and enjoy the owl treat Harry gave him.
Remus shed a tear while reading it. He loved Sirius too. Dearly. He was his first love. They enjoyed their time together but the difference between them were too much. Sirius was a free bird. He wasn't a keeper. Sirius never had a stable relationship. He had flings here and there between Remus. He enjoyed his free lifestyle. He wasn't into relationship and Remus knew it since the started but he still tried his luck. They tried to be in relationship. He liked Sirius and trying to followed his guts. They only last for few months before finally they broke up. They're mate but just an ordinary mate bond. Both understood and they still be best friends. Sirius never cheated on him when they're together. Remus appreciated his efforts. They separated after they graduated. Remus went into woods living in his four paws and Sirius went back to his family. They didn't have any contact until they received a news that James was killed by The Dark Lord. They attended his funeral and was shocked that James made them Harry's godfathers. They're happy although they didn't have any contact since the graduation, James still thinking of them. They promised to take care of Harry but apparently Dumbledore had own plan. They respected his decision and agreed with him. Remus should knew better. Remus should begged Dumbledore to not letting him go. They didn't know where Harry would live. Dumbledore only said he would be protected.
"Me too mother. Me too. I wish I have my parents alive and dreams about having family. I am happy we are finally together. And yes mother I want to know you better too." He muttered softly.
Sirius, his mate, was killed. Although Sirius not his lifemate bond but he was his lover. He loved him and sometimes he missed his lover. The bond was now broken. He now lived alone without a mate. He could be with Sirius if they weren't be betrayed by Order of Phoenix. He and Sirius would stay together and maybe with Harry if that scumbs didn't wreck his life.
"For merlin's sake. Behave like you usually behave before this shit happened. You both already acted like father and son for these two year and now you act like bloody virgin forced to be married with stranger?! Like hell. You, Sev" He pointed his finger at Severus, "It's so not you for being shy and act sweet. You are bloody Severus, the coldest man in the world. You always stiff and cold and distant. Why the fuck you feel awkward towards your son?!" He then pointed at Harry. " And you. You always acted spoiled brat and teased me. You always team up with Sev and now you choose to avoid him? Like the fucking ten years old boy meeting a stranger. Really Harry?? Where's your bloody Gryffindor braveness? He is your mother. Why the hell you act so polite towards him? You didn't even act polite when he teach you potion. This is so not you also?! Now make up and behave like the normal family. I'm tired with your antics behavior." Draco rubbed his temple. He didn't want to snapped at them but they're too much. He sighed and talk softly,
The continuous day both families were so busy. The preparations seems had no end. But the night before the ceremony the venue was beautifully decorated. Everyone who came will be captivated with the decorations. It was so majestic.
Harry tapped the hand that hugged his waist loosely. Draco opened his eyes but instead of wake up he nuzzles his nose on Harry's neck, kissed his gland then nip his ear lightly.
Remus Lupin woken up with massive hangover. He spent his night drinking to numbing his feeling. He never used to drink more than few glass. But last night was exceptional. He needed to drink to forget everything. He was betrayed by someone he trusted. He respected that man for giving him jobs when no one wanted him. He thought he was like an angel but apparently he's grim reaper. He wanted people owe him a favour or two so he could collect the favours back. He made people blinded by his kindness, he acted like a saint who could give everyone safety and if he needed their blood he could collect it without difficulty. They would give him their everything as the payment for his kindness before. The old coot was evil. He manipulated his victim into false comfort. He would trap his victims but won't kill them but let them dying slowly for him in the named of "for greater good." They would gladly sacrifice their own life for this old coot.
"Mother.. Mother.." The word tasted strange in his lips but he liked it. "Mother.. I am sorry.. I am sorry.. I.. " Harry hugged his mother and burst into tears. He finally had a family. His own family. His own mother was here hugging him, loving him. He no longer an orphan. He no longer felt alone. He no longer had to starved himself, he no longer being abused, he no longer lived in that house. He no longer had obligations to be hero, to save everyone. He didn't have that ability and he didn't want to be a pawn. He could live a simple life with Severus, his mother, with Narcissa and Lucius his soon to be in-laws and with Draco, his Alpha, his everything. He want to stay together with Severus, to be with him, to be taken care of and took care for him, His family. Now he had someone who can love him, protect him, always stand beside him until forever. He had mother. He could feel a warm touch of a mother. How he dreamed about this since forever. He was always jealous whenever his cousin being petted, being hugged and kissed and being told he's precious by his parents. He didn't need to be jealous anymore. He could do that now. He could hug and kiss his mother, he even could act like spoiled brat and his mother would still loving him.
Draco wanted to have a simple bonding ceremony but his mother wanted a grand party just like her favourite. He just need Harry's opinion about the party part. Not about the marriage part. He wouldn't let Harry said no for that part.
The shop keeper was shocked. How can two young boys choose the most dangerous familiar. The hatchling snake was not just a snake. It's a baby basilisks. And the cat was not a kneazle or wampus. It's Fabblehaven.
"If you don't wake up I will do something naughty and we will be late for dinner and your mother will be here dragging us downstairs."
" I am not sure. I would like to have revenge but maybe not now. I don't know. I can't think properly. It's bit too much for me. Believing that the young dark haired wizard who looked exactly like your dream man wasn't yours and believing he's married someone else, believing you will be always alone, no one loved me and no one wants me because I am broken omega, grieving for entire life and suddenly BOOM everything was a lie. You are wanted, loved, you aren't broken. You aren't alone. You had husband, the one you loved, you have a son who exactly like in your dreams and he needs you. I will focus on Harry. I want to make up my time for him. Revenge or not it's up to Harry. I will follow his decision." Severus looked crestfallen. He tried to ask Harry but he was hiding his head in Draco's neck. Severus sighed. He didn't have a chance to talk to him. Harry somehow avoided this topic since Gringotts.
Remus John Lupin. The Alpha werewolf who his mate was killed by he thought a dark wizard on the second battle in Ministry of Magic three years ago now awoken in the healing chamber after the exhausted rituals. He was sleeping in there for few hours. He woke up and walked out to find Gornnuk. He claimed his Lupin Lordship and finished some any matter. He left Gringotts and spent the night at Leaky Cauldron.
His son was cute innocent virgin. He needed to assisted Harry when his first heat come. Harry blushed hard at his mother's questions, He knew he is virgin and innocent. He's late bloomer. He knew that. He never joined their dorm mates jerk off party in the dorm. He often run away when their dorm mates started to do pervert things. He never enjoyed the conversation about boobs, V, and sex. He even didn't like to touch himself. He didn't like thinking about sex at all, but maybe sometimes when he dreamed about Draco. He dreamed Draco did steamy stuff with him and next morning his pants was wet and sticky. But except that, he never did anything. He never dreamed about other men or even women. The thought disgusted Harry much. Ew.
He then summoned Titan and told him to send his letter to Draco and no need to back here as he will leave this house and wish to never come back again.
Draco went out from bathroom with only towel on his hips. His hair still wet. Few waters dropping down to his toned chest. Draco still have slim body with a slightly broad shoulders and narrow waist. His hips line was so lickable. His muscles were so fine. Nothing too much. His eight packs looked so good. Harry wanted to rub his body on it. His biceps and triceps had so nice flexs. Harry was safe being hug by that muscle arms. He almost drooling over his Alpha.
"Oh Merlin, our parents already know about this don't they. That's why they arranged this date for us." He half glared at Draco. Draco winked at him.
Draco and Harry talked about their relationship and their future. They talked for hours until Narcissa found them. The young pair had to stop their sweet conversation and follow Narcissa to the restaurant. They went to have a nice dinner in Narcissa's favorite restaurant, La Pierre G.
Lucius wanted to ask something but he was distracted by Remus and Severus. The two stood to close for his liking. He didn't hate them if they're in relationship but he thought it's too soon for them. He didn't want Severus to be hurt again. His Alpha protective instinct wanted to separate the broken Omega with the broken Alpha. His Alpha thought startled him. He refocus his mind and stay a bit far from the soon to be pair. He walked closer to Minerva and asked about his chamber.
"Let's go Love. Let's go back home. We have some unfinished matter." He kissed Harry long and hard almost make Harry lost his balance.
" Griphook, Call Gornnuk here, told him a brief story about Harry's conditions. I need his assistance. And take a look at Potter vaults report. Who have the access to the vaults. Find out who the one steal from Harry. Don't forget to check artifacts and family heriloom lists. I am afraid some are gone."
Harry grabbed his mother's hand and half dragged him to the dining room where The Malfoy's already sat on their seats. Remus followed them and smiled softly at them.
Harry just needed to slash his finger with silver dagger with runes on its blade. Harry dropped three drops of his blood and after faint buzzed the parchment filled with words. Griphook showed him his certificate with grim looks. This was beyond his expectations. He thought the black haired young boy only lost his money to those thieves. He didn't think the blood test revealed so many dark true. He felt sorry to the boy.
He wasn't ready to shared his past with Severus. He was afraid of his mother reaction. He was afraid Severus would called him weak for not defending himself. He was afraid his mother didn't love him anymore because of his flaws. He didn't want to ruined their precious relationship with his dark past.
Draco can understand his fiancé thinking. His Omega just scared. Its his nature to be worried. Draco wouldn't let his ex mentor laid a hand on his mate. He would take any measurement and made them in upper hand.
Severus's orders. They then went to The Magical Menagerie to buy new familiar. Harry wanted to have snakes and Draco wanted a crup. They came inside the shop which full of magical creatures.
"Professor don't bully my Alpha." Harry innocently caressed Draco's thigh attempts to calming Draco but instead made the situation worse. Draco sat rigidly in his seat, his cheeks flushed and his eyes hazy. He had to bite his tounge trying his best to not lost his control. Severus couldn't stand anymore. He laughed loudly. Draco almost bang his head on the table. He looked flustered in his seat with his member half awake.
Both stayed unmoved for few minutes. The water inside the tub became colder and their cum make it sticky. Draco picked Harry up and led him to the shower. They're having nice and warm shower. Real shower this time. They finished quickly and changed their clothes before walked to the dining room. Narcissa, Lucius and Severus were sitting at their seat. Harry was surprised to see his mother.
The ceremony run smoothly and sacred. The vows was beautiful. The audiences felt so touched by them.
"Ssshh, Harry, relax. Just lay on me and I will take care of everything for you. I will make sure everything works well. Just trust me. You will get your rights back, you will get your happiness back. You and Severus deserves the best. I promise. Now close your eyes and rest Love. You're exhausted. You almost depleted your magic. Take a rest. I will tell you when they got everything settled." He reassured Harry while kissing his temples. His Alpha side wanted to bite his mating gland. Harry was ao vulnerable but lovely. He released his pheromones which make him happy. He almost devoured his Omega but the time wasn't right. He controlled his pervert mind and focus on his surroundings. This was important day for his Omega. If he devoured him right now he wouldn't get any credence from his Omega. He wouldn't stoop that low to mate with Harry. He didn't only lust after him as perfect Omega but he also wanted to be his lover and partner in life. Draco sighed and can only nuzzled his head in Harry's neck.
"Now gentlemen, should we continue?" Narcissa said in too cheerful tone like she's faking her tone. "Harry, dear. Remus gave you a letter from James. Would you mind to read your father's will aloud? Or do you want to read it in private with your mother?"
"First, I want you to removed all the blocks, charms, compulsions and potions from Harry before he legally claims his Lordship. I will allow him to take Potter and Slytherin Lordships first. We don't need him to claim his heirships at this moments. And since I am Lord Black by blood, I wouldn't abandon my kin and will take care of him without hesitation. Second, I want all the money Dumbledore and his lackeys were stealing brought back with interest. The artifacts and family heirlooms need to be claimed back too. I want them to be punished. You know your rule about thieves. I hope they can be punished by goblins's law. If not then I will have my solicitor to make them rotten in Azkaban and I can sue Gringotts for siding with thieves. Third, prepare the cleansing rituals for us. I want the best team to do the rituals. I want you to provide painless and safest ways to do it. Now move you two." Draco even clasped his hands to made the two goblins worked faster.
Harry who was stunned when Draco slipped the ring on his finger now blushed hard. His face and neck felt hot. Draco was wicked. He's very smooth with his words. He looked at his hand which now looked more lovely with elegant ring on his finger. He observed his ring. The ring was so beautiful. Simple black and silver band with full diamond inside and outside. There's a tiny initial on it. D&H. He loved the ring. The simplicity made it more stunning. He didn't fancy something flashy and showy. The band was made of titanium, The diamonds were small but it's perfect. He didn't know how much it cost but he knew it must be hella expensive. He loved it. Really loved it. He was delighted with Draco's choise. He looked at Draco with so much love in his eyes. He then kissed Draco on lips.
Harry listening the explanations with full attention. So he would not have heat until September. Plenty time. To be honest, he was afraid. Harry is virgin with no sexual experience. He didn't have friends to talk about this. Their ex friends never talked about something this important. They're too busy to distracted him with their ridiculous drama. Harry often spent his time with his other friends. One of them was Neville. The cute chubby cheeks wizard was the same like Harry. Innocent little virgins. They ever talked about what their other dorm mates doing and both got shy and quiet. Since then he never talked about pervert things with Neville. He couldn't ask Draco too since he is an Alpha even before the second gender revealed. They were so different in that aspect. And Harry was too shy to talked about that kind of things with him. He needed someone neutral to talked to.
Draco held Harry in his arm and walked to the table and seated him on the chair. He kissed Harry's temple gently and said
"I couldn't tell you about the detail because I am not the best person who can tell. I'm not good with this stuff but I can give you few books. Read it yourself. The book contained full explanation about when your first heat, regular heat, contraception, pregnancy and lactation. It has content for Alpha too but not details."
Harry apparated to Gringotts and meet Draco there. Draco looked at him in awe. His eyes become misty and Harry saw a love and lust in there before Draco regained his usual Malfoy mask in a second. Draco compliments him and congratulate him for being Omega. Male Omega was rare.
Remus was sobbing quietly. He almost never cried, not since Sirius death. This betrayal was so deep. He felt his heart being stabbed million times. His face were so white and pale like a mortal being sucked dry by a vampire. He was so hurt. He clenched his body tighter trying to kept it whole. Remus was a delicate and softhearted person. He never used violence. Even his wolf side was kind and warm. Almost like normal human in full moon. He couldn't believe he trusted them with all his heart. If they weren't trust that man, mayhe he and Sirius could be together, and maybe his friends would still alive. Harry would still have his parents too.
"I agree with you but who will teach Care of Magical Creature? And we still need Politic and Ministry etiquette for apprentice, Home Economic for Omega." Said Minerva.
"Welcome to the Manor, mister Lupin. I won't beat around the bushes with you. You've known your general story I guess. Let's start the business." Draco said in firm tone. He wouldn't let his guard down.
Titan, the handsome owl gave him soft hoot, soothing his nerves. He finally calmed down and could opened his second potion without difficulty, chugging the whole flask. He waited until his pain gone, then he emptied his last two potions. he crawled back onto his bed then fell asleep as soon as his head reached the pillow.
Lupin gulped at the authority this young man have. He was Alpha but this young Alpha was stronger than him. He could only nods in agreement. Draco nodded back.
Harry hums in cheerful tune when he cooked his dinner. He enjoys cooking, but hate doing other chores. After eating his dinner and washed his dishes he climbed upstair into his room. He lay down on his bed thinking about his life. His thought back to his sixth year. Still vivid in his minds on that eventful night.
"Yes Love, I am sure. He is your mentor Harry. He is the one who teach you Patronus charm and many spells. He is your father's friend Darling. He's your godfather. I believe he has good heart." Draco rubbed Harry's knuckles.
"It's okay Moony. It's okay. I didn't blame you. I was hurt yes but I am okay. Thank you for taking care of me  and thanks for loving me. You are a good godfather Moony." Harry reached Remus's shoulder and patted  it.
He then moved his gaze to read Sirius's will. He didn't have any smart speech in his letter. Sirius still a prick until his last breath.
Harry felt weak on his knee so he clung onto Draco. The young Alpha cleaned his omega body thoroughly and carry him out the bathroom. Draco kissed him short and put a nice robes on him. Harry was still in dazed when Draco finished. The two heading to dinning room for breakfast with their families.
Harry missed Draco so bad. He missed their cuddles. He missed Draco's scents. He needs his Alpha. He often wore Draco's clothes so he could be covered in Draco's scents.
Lucius was working with his ministry jobs when Severus's owl landed on the table. He dropped a letter from its beak and flew away back to his master. Lucius opened his letter and furrowed his eyebrows when read the letter.
Draco and Harry said goodbye the their parents and heading to their room to rest. Their parents were so understanding with the young pair. They gave the young pair time strengthen their bond.
"Dray, today is our memorable day. I don't want to ruin the day with unnecessary thoughts. I want to forget about Remus and any other thought. I want today be filled with happy memories like before we meet Remus." Harry faced Draco and trailed his finger on Draco's chest.
"Nothing son, just Draco needed to be disciplined. He should behaved more. A gentleman shouldn't make that kind of gesture in public. Draco should be more careful with his wand. He should put his wand in the safe place. We don't want something bad happens, do we? Severus smirked at Draco.
"Follow me. I will show you the place. And as for your wolf side, we will let him take control of your body to make the rituals easier." Gornnuk explained that to him, asked him to be relax and clear his mind.
"Harry, I miss you cub. I miss you so much. I am sorry for not being good godfather to you." Remus's voice was shaken.
In the same time in different part of Malfoy Manor, Hary and Draco were having a picnic in the garden. They laid on soft blankets under the oak tree. The warm breeze made them sleepy. They're thinking about what will happen at Hogwarts. Harry's afraid of people reactions when they know he is an Omega. Draco's afraid Harry will be targeted by many Alpha when they meet other people. He was afraid someone else will court him. He knew Harry love him and he felt the same. He was courting Harry for two years with so much careful steps and not so subtle hints. He remembered when the first time he showed Harry his interest.
"Fine. I trust you enough to follow your instructions without hesitation. Remus, do the honours." Minerva reached Severus's hand.
They sat in silence for a while. After few minutes, judging by Harry's relax expression, it looked like his son was already calmed down. Severus the
Harry sat beside Draco and Severus sat beside Cissa and Remus sat beside Severus. It was dinner time so they started to eat and no words come out from their mouths.
Everyone agreed and heading to dining room. Remus would be stayed in the Manor. He got his wand back earlier. Draco seemed trust him enough to let him stay in the manor with his wand. They're having a quiet dinner and then went to their rooms to had a rest.
"Oh, that's bit long story. I will tell you the details later. But I've been closed with him since in my sixth year. And as you already know that Draco and I are in relationship. We're engaged on the day I met you. He proposed me that day and wanted to spent our afternoon with ice creams before went back to Manor, but we met you and you know." Answered Harry.
Draco didn't say any words. He just looked at the shop keeper with his intimidating gesture and the shop keeper who was a Beta could only number him the prices. Draco paid 720 galeons for both cat and basilisk, additional price 70 galeons for their this and that.
They spent their day with testing some spell and charms. Remus and Severus will be stayed in Hogwarts for few days. Leaving Lucius alone in the Manor since Narcissa and the kids still had holiday in France.
He looked for a blank parchment then wrote his letter to Draco, he remembered Draco ask him about his new gender. He forgot about it all. He run the corner, looked at the mirror in front of him. Wow, he looked different. His skin glowing, so soft and smooth, his scars from his past abused all gone even lighting bolt scar leaving only a faded line on his forehead. His eyes rounder, his lips now fuller with pink color. His hairs grew longer, softer and no more like bird nest. He could imagine Draco's reaction. That Alpha must be made snide comment about his bird nest. Chuckled at his own imagination, Harry continued to examine his transformations. His body seemed curvier, his bum got perky. His height seems unchanged. He's still short and skinny. He didn't mind being petite. He felt sexy and looked pretty. He liked his new transformations. He knew who he is. He's an Omega. A Pretty Omega if he could add. He's happy with his second gender. No one knows his secrets except Draco. His dream was become Omega and mate with Alpha Draco then bear their offspring and live happily ever after like in fairytale. He blushed at his pervert imagination.
"Yes mother. I had a nice talk with Severus about Harry. I asked his blessings to marry Harry. I want to have soul bonding with him. Not just marking him." Draco looks at his mother reaction.
"Sweetheart, why you're so lovely. I want to snog you senseless here and now but we are in public. We need to maintain our manner and not display any inappropriate public affection. I will satisfy my need with few kisses for now. We will continue our activities later. Don't make it harder for me to not jump over you now." Draco mumbled in his husky voice on Harry's ear that made him shivered. Harry squealed when Draco nipped his ear and kissed his gland. He then released Harry from his embrace.
"Sorry cub. How have you been? How are you? Where are you staying at now? Are you okay cub?" He looked at Harry with worry expression on his face.
"Oh no. Don't get me wrong. I am not against your decision. I just shocked you want to marry him that soon. I thought you will wait until school end. But I'm glad you're asking. I just happened to have same thoughts. I want you and Harry be official. If marriage is something in your mind already then I won't have constant worry about Harry's safety. I believe you are aware of the situation. Many wizards want to continue their family line and Harry as Omega is the perfect candidate. He is a powerful wizard and as an Omega he is perfect to bear the offspring. I don't want him ended with someone he doesn't like. Now Draco are you serious with this? I believe you are a nice young man. You are a powerful wizard, you already proved you are good leader. You too protect him during the war. I can see you love my son. But marriage and mating is not easy. You want to soul and life bonding with him right? Not just marking him. I suggest you to talk to Harry first. And don't forget to tell your mother or she will chop you alive if you don't include her in your decision. " Severus patted Draco's shoulder. Severus smiled at him. His godson now became a fine gentleman. Finally he could be at ease. His son indeed in good hand.
They were sat in the living room looked so knackered. Tipsy the head house elf greeted them and prepared warm tea with mild calming draught to soothe their nerves. They slumped in their couches. They didn't have any energy to moved moreover to talked. Everyone sipped their tea in silence. They all seemed lost in their own thoughts. Draco absentmindedly rub his thumb on Harry's gland which made Harry breathed in comfort. The calm ambience vanished when Tipsy apparated back to with loud crack and sobered everyone in the living room.
He run and arrived at Gringotts in few minutes. Remus looked inside and found an empty counter and asked the goblin.
They were resting in the family room. Tipsy brought them summer drinks like pimms, watermelon lemonade, strawberry limeade, ice shaken peach tea, coctail, fresh juices. Tipsy also brought solero, sorbet, fresh fruits, ice cream, frozen yogurt, scones and many more.
"Mother, (he likes the sound, it sending him a soft tingle on his lips whenever he calls his mother), mother what should we do after this. I don't want to think about the past. It's hurt so much mother, I want to forget that hurtful memories. I just want us to be happy. Again. Being family but I want them to feel what I felt. I want to experience what I experienced." He said in timid voice.
"Thank you Lucius. I appreciate your offering. Thank you for including me in your plan." He shook Lucius's hand.
There's few snorts and snickers sounds among the audiences. The adults knew how silly James was. Severus wiped his tears in silence but he smile at his silliness. They then continue listening the will.
Draco moved to kissed Harry's jaw, he sucked his jaw, hard until it left with red color, he kissed his neck, sucked and bite his veins. Harry throwed his head back giving Draco full access.
Severus casted silencing and privacy charm. He knew his chamber was safe but more protectios wouldn't hurt anyone. He prepared tea for them and then he sat.
"Good night, darling. I will be there soon. Good night to you all." Cissa kissed Draco's and Harry's cheeks.
"What kind of question is that? Of course I do. Do you want Harry and I have casual relationship? You want me to treat him well so of course I want serious relationship. " Draco said heatedly.
"Here's the other way. We're doing blood test. You just need to dropped your blood on a blank parchment and the parchment will show your birth certificate."
The Prince-Potter who still in awkward situations didn't want to left behind and followed The Malfoys to renew their wards. They went to outside the manor. They would do the ritual on the woodland first and then move clockwise to another and another until all corner covered.
Remus sighed and shaked his flashbacks away. He had moved on. He loved Sirius but he moved on. Sirius maybe his first love but not the love of his life. He's okay with that. He enjoyed his maturity. He just needed to focus on his godson.
" Griphook as you heard, Harry gave me an authority to handle the Potter business so I give you my oath. I, Draco Malfoy, will temporary handle Harry Potter's business  until he is stable enough to make his own decisions. If I in the way I'm working with my job make the Potter in vain I would take any responsibility. If I in the way to handle the business I failed my job and everything turned into unproductive and futile actions, I would take any punishment from Harry itself and from the laws. You will respond to my command from now on." Griphook gave him a positive answer.
Harry laid on his back with Draco beside him. Both seemed have lot of thought. There's heavy atmosphere in the room. Draco sighed and turn his side to face Harry.
"Minerva, please read this. This is James's letter. He told us the real truth of his death." Severus gave her James's letter and let her read it herself.
"Love, I won't let something happen to us. Believe me." He cupped Harry's cheeks and kissed him soft and sweet. He tried reassuring his fiancé that everything was going to be alright.
"Sev, they're going to be alright. Do not worry. Draco is my son. He was well raised to be proper gentleman. He won't hurt Harry. If he do he will meet his mother's wraths. You and I in same boat. We want the best to our children. I am sure Draco already have a plan to mark him soon. He just wait for your permission. He respect you as his godfather and he respect you as Harry's mother. And the last he put Harry higher than anything. He will wait until Harry is ready. He loves him Sev. He treats him so well. You know that. You know how he loves Harry and will do anything to make him happy. You can see how he looks at Harry with that lovestruck gaze, he is in love and I know Harry feels the same. Talk to Harry first. And then talk to Draco. Lucius is already giving Draco and Harry his blessings since the start actually but you know Luce. He won't show it openly. It's okay. They will be ok. We will be ok. It's okay. Don't force them just talk to them. Tell them your worries and give them choices. It's up to them to mate before or after heat. You know that Omega can be marked even when not in heat though the marking only last for three days and when in heat temporary mark only last for two weeks. Draco can permanently mark Harry but he won't do that without Harry's concent." She squeezed his hand, comforting him. They both smiled and went back to their activities. After a few moments he thank her sincerely.
He walked out of the store with Ginny’s favourite, a pink thing with jasmine and rose, as well as a cheerfully yellow and citrusy one he liked to use on the rare mornings he started with a bath instead of a shower.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I think I failed at the socialising with someone I don’t know part, because that…well, that ended up being you.”
“Yeah, that’s what the rooms are for. The shelves will remember for you. If you come back tomorrow—”
“Anything. Come to the pub with me tonight. Have dinner at my place. Bookstore. A picnic. I don’t care, I just, I want to do things. See you in the mornings. Hang out with your friends. All those things.”
“I’m fine,” Harry said. “It’s really not a big deal. It’s just how things are. Ginny’s seeing someone and I’m…” Developing a massive crush on Malfoy. “Busy.”
It wasn’t until Harry was standing at the bar getting them all a round of drinks, listening to the bartender flirting with two girls a bit further down as he pulled the draughts, that he realised that all of them at the table tonight were queer. They didn’t have to do the entire inane
This was nice. Harry had missed Ginny—more than he’d realised. This, the casual closeness, the smell of her shampoo. Her insightfulness. “I love you,” he said.
Harry was yelling. “YES! ALICE!” Next to him Ginny was also yelling. One by one, the players on the field stopped as they realised the game was over, then followed Alice as she speeded off the field towards Harry.
Harry stared. “Why would you care about what I’d think? We were never going to see each other again. I wasn’t going to know.”
“I want to be,” was Harry’s immediate response. If you’ll have me, he thought. Even if I’m me. “Look, that book? Is just a book. It’s not an indicator for your life, or mine, or anyone else’s. We get to make our own happy endings, all right? We deserve that.”
Ginny rolled her eyes. “No, you didn’t. Anyway, so, this daycare of yours…you want to lead them to victory and overdose the lot on chocolate?”
“If you’re trying to make friends with our resident murder boy, you’re not being very good at it,” Albert said from somewhere behind Harry, almost startling him off his chair.
“All right.” Harry cast about until he found Avery, hovering nearby. The look of guilt on his face matched Charlie’s to the letter. “Avery.”
He found Dudley in London. There was a phone number and an address in Camden. It had to be him; there weren’t many Dudleys, by Harry’s reckoning, and definitely not of the Dursley kind. He copied the information onto a scrap of paper and made his way to the nearest payphone.
“There is?” Harry asked, interested despite himself. “But…” He had his days full, with both the daycare and his regular archive shifts and now also the Little League. “Do I get my own office?”
“He didn’t get a happy ending regardless,” Harry pointed out. “Because for him it wasn’t about a happy ending; it was about a bad ending for everyone he hated and seeing those people suffer, and building an entire world on...suffering and hate. There’s no happiness in that.”
“It won’t feel claustrophobic when I’m done with this place,” Draco said, putting a hand on Harry’s waist. Harry listened to him talk about the parts of the walls he wanted to knock down, where he wanted to put in new and bigger windows, possibly even a solarium, how he wanted to keep the workshop with the big barn doors, and which colours he thought of putting on the walls, and even his plans for plumbing. He gestured as he spoke, his voice warm and gentle, with just a hint of cautious excitement. “I fixed the old well outside the barn, but I thought we could establish a new one in the kitchen, and run pipes upstairs for the bathrooms.”
It was an interesting game, Harry thought, in between shouting encouragement and directions at his players, because it was so completely different from the first game they’d played against the Candy Cranes. Then, it had been the third game in the Series, the team had been enthusiastic but still finding their feet, and they hadn’t let the competitiveness get to them
“Yes,” Draco answered. “We didn’t have horses, but a neighbour over the hill did. I snuck over sometimes to look at them. Mum would usually find me up a tree a few hours later, when I hadn’t come in for supper. It was a good tree; it had a perfect view over the paddock.”
“No. I don’t really know where to find them,” Malfoy said, cheeks pinking. “And I rarely have Muggle money on hand. Flourish and Blotts are fairly well stocked but will also order in things, so…”
“Yeah. I understand if you don’t want to, but I would appreciate the chance to have a sit down. You can bring someone if you want?” she added.
“Oh.” It didn’t sound at all similar to what Harry was feeling, and he had to tamp down the disappointment. “Because of therapy?”
He could go in, pick a book, and take it home, wondering all the while if maybe Malfoy would’ve liked it, or he could just go home. Ginny was at home.
Draco finally took the book. His chin was a bit wobbly, but he looked at the book and turned it over, and when he spoke his voice was rough. “This is the sequel to that book I lent you the first time.”
The idea of being friends with Malfoy was both foreign and ludicrous, but also strangely right. It had the alluring scent of possibility, of change, of progress. Promise.
At precisely one minute past one o’clock, Malfoy came to the Archive. Harry had checked with Albert when he’d come in earlier, but nobody had requested coroner reports that morning, so Harry had concluded that Malfoy hadn’t come back after all. But there was, standing in front of Harry, clutching the request slip Harry had given him the previous day.
“Don’t make excuses for me.” Malfoy turned to look at Harry. There was a bite of steel in his voice. “Allow me to ask you the same. What did the War teach you?”
They looked at one another, hesitant, unsure, but then Harry extended his hand. “I’ll see you around, P,” he said.
. And then they write stories about them too? All kinds of stories, stories where robots take over the world, or stories where robots are servants, or…or anything, really. It’d be like if wizardfolk wrote stories about talking teacups becoming supreme overlords, you know?”
“Ah…” Malfoy avoided Harry’s eyes, taking great care to pull his gloves off. “Another time? I can’t really…”
“I know how to read, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. He instantly regretted it—Malfoy’s face shuttered, and he’d taken a small step back. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for it to come out like that.”
“No.” Harry drew in a breath. “This was a long time coming,” he admitted. “Ginny’s already met someone else, and…” He tried for a casual shrug. “It’s probably a good thing.”
“What? No.” Harry glanced at Rhosyn, who was pretending not to be watching them. “I boxed up the rest of your stuff last weekend so you can come pick it up. Did you want the chest of drawers? Wasn’t that your grandfather’s? And the bed is actually yours—”
Maybe something about cowboys and Indians, he thought, recalling glimpses he’d managed to steal from Dudley’s comics in childhood. Maybe something about space.
“You only want to talk on the train about serious stuff,” she said, her voice shaky. She shook her head, looking skywards, and Harry thought maybe she was trying to blink back tears.
“My other job,” Harry clarified. “I forgot to tell you that, didn’t I? Here.” He still had both Valentines in a pocket somewhere. He dug them up and showed them to Malfoy. “We made Valentines yesterday. You can have one if you like.”
“I’d love that. The pass,” Malfoy said, and then suddenly he was leaning close and speaking into Harry’s ear. “Thank you for today,” he said. A brush of something warm and soft on Harry’s cheek, and then Malfoy had taken a step back. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“It does sound fun,” Padma commented, a thoughtful look on her face. “Low stakes, adorable children, proceeds go to honourable causes…will you be commentating, Lee?”
“We could tell the straight people pub night is cancelled forever,” Pansy mused. “Honestly, they’re exhausting.”
“I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact we haven’t spoken in two weeks and the first thing you want to talk about is splitting furniture,” she said. “But okay, let’s talk furniture. I’ll take the chest of drawers. You can keep the bed, or replace it, I don’t care.”
Harry joined her at the table. Should he tell her that Malfoy had come to the Archive? It wasn’t technically the reason why he’d been home late. Being rooted to the floor in Flourish and Blotts, incapable of making simple decisions, was the cause of that, but Harry didn’t want to tell Ginny that either…but telling her about Malfoy didn’t seem quite right.
“We’re counting on it,” Ginny said with a grin. “Ron and Percy have already reserved tables at the pub.”
Time, Harry could understand. “Okay.” He put a hand on Draco’s back. There were streaks of colour there from the bath bomb. Draco startled, so Harry withdrew it. “I’m sorry. I’m not trying to push, I’m just trying to understand.”
want to show you that, that all of them, they’re happy, you know? It’s not just in books, Draco. We get to have this in real life.”
Harry woke up Friday morning with a puffy face and messy hair and a void of hunger in his belly. He hadn’t eaten since he’d had lunch the day before (and even then, he hadn’t eaten much) and he was really feeling it now. He’d gone to sleep without eating after Ginny had left, too caught up in his own head to even think about food, and then when Hilde had returned from an evening flight without a note from Draco, he’d managed to talk himself into believing all was lost.
“It’s an evening course,” Mildred said, smiling triumphantly. “Anyway, I need to get back to this. I’ll put you down for research duty, then?”
“That was remarkably simple,” Draco said, relieved. “I needn’t have worried at all.” He was clutching his little black notebook. It was a little worn around the edges by now, and some pages were dog-eared.
I don’t get a carefully written wish fulfilment fantasy of a happy ending. I don’t get to be in this fucking world. It doesn’t matter what I want, I’m not going to get it, and I sure as hell don’t deserve it.”
“Smithereens?” Ginny asked, when Joseph sent another Bludger after the other team’s Seeker. “Where did that come from?”
“Both,” Harry grinned. Draco knew what he smelled like? “It’s supposed to embody rain and spring. So it’s like comfort and excitement all rolled up in one.” He grabbed five of them to take home, to make sure he wouldn’t run out just yet.
Draco was quiet for a while, his lip wobbling and his eyes shiny, jaw clamped shut. Finally, when it seemed like he was going to be able to speak without crying, he did. “You know, you’re doing a terrific job as a love interest,” he said. “That was—a lovely speech. Certainly a…good moment, the kind that in the books usually ends in a kiss—”
“Pansy honey, much as you’d like to think of yourself that way, you are not a femme. Futch, at best.” Padma blew her a kiss.
“It’s a depression thing,” Malfoy said, glancing at Harry. He looked embarrassed. “Like…being so tired and disconnected from everything that I might as well be dead. It’s hard to explain. And it’s not so bad anymore.”
Harry shook his head, even though maybe he did want a moment. However, moving on, distracting himself, seemed like the better option.
, but it didn’t feel right. Harry shrugged it off, then lifted his own glass only to realise it was empty. He stood up. “Another round?”
,” Harry answered. “Anyway, they weren’t going to tell me I couldn’t support more than one charity, you know?” Oliver had told him that once rumour spread that he was joining the project, interest had increased. Seemed like suddenly people were interested in charitable work as soon as there was a chance to be in the same league as Harry Potter. “Come to all the games. Your ticket money will go to several good causes.”
It was delicious. The white chocolate bits were still melty, and the raspberries burst in his mouth in little tart explosions. There was vanilla in these scones too.
“Yes.” Harry let Ginny go. His feelings about her didn’t have anything to do with his feelings for Malfoy, but he could understand her need for distance.
“A butt dial is when you have your mobile phone in your pocket, like a back pocket on a pair of Muggle trousers, and accidentally dial a number of somebody in the contact book on the telephone,” Malfoy explained, gesturing with his fork again. “Because the buttons on the telephone can get squeezed by accident as you move or sit down. And a booty call is when you make a phone call to somebody you want to have sex with, to invite them to your house to have sex. Presumably it’s a euphemism, where booty, or butt, is a stand in for sex.”
“Thank you! It’s the kids, they’re amazing—did you see that goal Charlie blocked in the second half? And Alice, when she caught the Snitch—”
“Uh, yeah. Sometimes. I don’t have trouble sleeping or anything, but sometimes I’m just…in a bad mood? Or tired but frustrated, or something, and just need to relax before going to bed, or maybe I’m not even in a bad mood but just want to relax anyway, and then this one is good for that, because it’s all calm.” Harry was definitely rambling now. “It’s soothing.”
“Oh, uhm, well. My undergrad thesis was about the intersection of Muggle technology and magic. Things like trains and cars that have been magically enhanced, photography—I was surprised to discover it was originally a Muggle invention, and that Muggle photographs don’t move—and also technology that hasn’t yet been adapted for magical use but could be. For my Master’s I want to expand on that, but in a slightly different direction: I want to look at the intersection of magic and Muggles.” Malfoy was slightly out of breath, but he looked determined, and excited. “What I mean is, I want to study the ways Muggles interact with magic.”
“And did you get it?” Draco asked pointedly. “I don’t see you with a wife and two kids and a nice house and a cushy job and maybe a dog and family picnics in the countryside.”
“I hoped we could meet again sometime,” Peony said, glancing at Draco as he slowly collected his things and started making his way over. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to,” she added hastily. “But thank you for coming. I’m glad you’re doing well.”
He wasn’t entirely sure he knew, really, all his suggestions sounding more and more ludicrous as he came up with them, going from “Everything about the fucking War, really” to “My cousin used to shove my head in the toilet at school and that just seems so insignificant now.” She’d prodded and poked, asked about this or that event, and then they’d talked about Dudley.
“Yeah,” Harry said, without hesitation, and meant it. He couldn’t possibly give it to Ginny after all. But Malfoy…there was a look in his eyes, and Harry didn’t know what it meant, but he knew it was important. “Pick one.”
“How…what do you know about Muggles?” Harry asked. “Have you ever met one?” The idea of Malfoy face to face with a Muggle was strange, as was the idea of him interacting with one.
“I need to go,” Draco said, and rolled out of bed. With the aid of his wand he cleaned up quickly and started getting dressed.
“Smelling you.” Draco’s voice was muffled. He drew in a deep breath, then dragged himself up. “I’m great. You?”
Harry had never known that Flourish and Blotts had a section for fiction before, or that the fiction section had so many subsections. Large labels proclaimed that these shelves were CRIME, a smaller label divvied them up into Muggle and Magical. Another set of shelves were all YOUNG ADULT, and yet another was HISTORICAL FICTION. Harry was in the middle of it all, staring down between tightly stacked shelves, trying to decide which section of the section of the section he should look at first, wondering if maybe he should flip a coin, or just close his eyes and spin in a circle and buy whatever he happened to grab first.
Malfoy didn’t sneak another cheeky kiss at the archive Thursday or Friday, but he did take breaks with Harry over tea and cookies in the garden, where they discussed the book Harry had just finished reading, another one that Draco had lent him. This one was a Muggle fantasy novel about talking dragons with political opinions, which Harry thought was delightful and terrifying all in one—delightful because the book was funny, and terrifying because the thought of real dragons getting seats in parliament to vote about free sheep for all sounded like a nightmare.
Even if…even if Malfoy was responsible for making Harry feel all sorts of silly things, he didn’t want to put him into the
Harry had sat in Gladys’ office in complete silence for a full twenty minutes before she started asking questions.
“Yes. Well—no to the pub, for now. What are you doing tomorrow? You don’t have a Little League game this weekend, do you?”
Harry looked at the empty bookcase again, trying to keep the dread from turning into an empty hollow, a growing dead zone. He didn’t really want to go through the entire ritual of pretending he wanted to have sex with Ginny, not today. Today he just wanted to start…fitting the pieces of their new life together. New year, new place, new life. But Ginny was looking at him like
He didn’t know how to tell her not to be scared—or if he should tell her so in the first place. Fire wasn’t harmless, and the next time this happened it could turn out worse. They’d gotten lucky so far.
Those evenings were Harry’s favourite. Draco was an animated reader; he’d make faces and noises at the book as he went through it, would laugh and cry, and on one memorable occasion he’d stared at a book in disgust for full two minutes and then set fire to it. When Harry asked, he’d just said it’d been morally reprehensible, and when Harry had pressed further, he’d snapped.
“I’m not sure I follow. Are you saying you…don’t…” Draco trailed off, frowning. “Could you try to explain?”
“Marvellous.” Malfoy turned to face Harry. He’d extracted his notebook from some pocket or other and was pulling out the latest request slip. “For now, I’d just like this, please.”
“Apology accepted. To answer your question: I’d like to think so. It’s an ongoing process, but on the whole,” Malfoy shrugged, “I think I’m reaching a point where I’m okay with those parts. Maybe.”
“But if she wasn’t lying?” Harry asked. He couldn’t take his eyes off Draco, who rarely looked as animated as when talking about books. His whole face came alive: lips quirking, eyebrows moving, eyes twinkling. There was a line in his cheek that deepened every time he did the ‘or maybe’ face.
“Okay,” Harry said. “More time is fine. It’s—more than fine, I wasn’t—I didn’t mean that I wanted—I’m asexual,” he blurted. His heart skipped a beat or two, suddenly terrified at having said it out loud. “Or at least I think so.”
He’d taken Avery aside for a minute before they headed out and while Avery had promised to change his behaviour, Harry wasn’t convinced it was going to be that easy.
“It’s for a project.” Malfoy accepted the form, peering down at it. “When will you, ah, be in again?”
“What? Oh. A book, I think,” Harry answered, semi-distracted. “WELL DONE, AVERY!” he yelled, just as Lee was announcing the score. Ten minutes into the game and the Butterfly Bumpkins were ahead thirty points to ten.
“Nothing—sorry,” Harry apologised, keeping his head down. Class was ending soon, but none of that mattered anymore.
“No, they aren’t.” Harry watched Malfoy drive the fork into the tart, the cracks in the meringue, the fork imprint in the custard, the crumbs of the crust scattering on the plate. “Dobby saved my life.”
“Right,” Malfoy said. The crease deepened and his eyebrows did a funny thing that made him look uncertain. That, paired with the still flaming red cheeks, made him look…cute.
“But.” Malfoy stopped, as if he wasn’t sure what he was going to say, and Harry was so surprised he didn’t continue. The pencil kept turning in Malfoy’s hands, his fingers quick and nimble. “I, ah, when does it start?”
“Er,” Harry said. He dropped the customer service smile. “Did you bring the slip I gave you last week or did you want something else today?”
. But it makes me feel better, and that makes me feel less dead, which…” he trailed off. “It makes everything better.”
Malfoy seemed to realise this also, because he took a step backwards, cheeks pinking again, and turned towards the front desk. Harry rushed in, catching up with him and giving Albert a frazzled greeting as he slid around Malfoy and to his spot behind the desk.
“Yeah, for quite some time now.” Harry shrugged. “They’re moving in together and all. I think they’re doing really well.”
of this is easy.” Harry rubbed his face. His food had gone cold while arguing with Draco, but he didn’t feel like eating right now anyway. He hadn’t told Draco about his therapy session yet, or about his being asexual. He’d barely even processed it yet—he didn’t know what bearing it would have on their relationship, and now they were arguing about happy endings?
That had Draco swivel round to look at him. “I saw the pamphlet,” he said. “On your fridge. I read it. I didn’t mean to pry, I was just curious…”
Malfoy stared at him. Then he blinked, slowly, not in that way cats do when they’re all snug somewhere outside one’s field of vision, but in that way where one keeps one’s eyes closed for several seconds, as if reciting a quiet prayer. When he opened his eyes again to look at Harry, he paused. Then he shook his head.
with Draco, for Merlin’s sake—and Draco had done the same, and more. “I’m…also glad you’re doing well,” he added.
“I wanted to,” Malfoy said. He’d put the pile of books away in his cloak, a well-tailored and classy dark grey piece that clearly had pockets that were bigger on the inside and fitted with a weightless charm.
Harry took a moment to himself to process the fact that Malfoy had just asked to see three thousand coroner reports. It would take him days to look through them all, if not weeks.
This was news to Harry and apparently also to everyone else. Pansy was staring, Padma and Blaise were frowning, and Dean and Seamus, who didn’t know Draco well, were puzzled. Gilliam was looking at Draco with interest, however. “Woodwork? That sounds very interesting. What is that about?”
Harry didn’t know if he’d ever see her again, or if Ginny even wanted to see him again…and what was worse, he didn’t know if he really wanted to see her, either.
“Can I put my arm around you?” Harry clarified. “You don’t have to say yes,” he quickly added. “I just wanted—thought—”
The moment he reached his usual chair the front door opened and Malfoy came in. Harry tried to suppress a grin; he’d have to ask him sometime what this all was about, but for now he was just pleased to see him.
And then—like magic—Harry saw Love send a Bludger directly at the other team’s Seeker, who narrowly avoided it, and as she swerved, he saw Alice come up behind her speeding towards the right-most goal post on the opposite side of the playing field, and he saw the sun bounce off something shiny for a second—
“If you don’t want to hear any more about wallpaper patterns or buggies, you can tell me to shut my gob,” Ron continued.
“Maybe if you didn’t always want it it wouldn’t be a problem!” The words slipped out before Harry knew he was going to say them, and then it was too late to take them back.
“All right. I understand that what you would like to happen is to find a way to enjoy having sex with your partner without it being a terrible thing to overcome, and without there being this ‘sex-hangover’ afterwards.”
Malfoy smiled. “Thank you, Potter.” He seated himself at the desk and laid out the notebook and the pencil.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked. He’d found a small scar near Daco’s thumb and was tracing it with his fingers.
Harry’s heart had jumped into his throat. He picked up the pamphlet, folding it open. ASEXUALITY IS THE LACK OF SEXUAL ATTRACTION, it said on the first page.
Harry wavered. He and the volunteers were the only ones who didn’t have their own offices. Whatever cataloguing work he did was always done with somebody else, in their office, or in one of the work rooms where they had the space to deal with large amounts of files. “But I have the daycare also,” he said.
Harry and Ginny shook hands with the cookbook author, whose name turned out to be Pleasance Downer. “You played a good game,” Harry said. “Maybe we’ll meet you in the semi-finals or finals?”
It had to happen sooner or later, Harry knew, but he had been hoping for later. Though if this was it,
His colleagues, being trained archivists, usually had a number of tasks they could do to while away the time at the front desk on slow days, but Harry wasn’t a trained archivist. He had no formal qualifications to speak of, but he could retrieve documents and shelve them again, and he was semi-officially in charge of dealing with incoming owls. Sometimes they brought research questions, sometimes stacks of papers some kind soul wanted to donate to the Archive for posterity (according to Mildred and Laura, most of the time donated documents were actually worthless and thus wound up in the incinerator instead of in the archives), sometimes fanmail to Harry. Sometimes he got to help catalogue small collections, but most of the time he was here, helping patrons.
Harry arrived for his shift at the Archive with wind-blown hair and mud on his robes because he’d been too distracted to pay attention and had been bowled over by an overly enthusiastic Betty. He arrived late, and hungry, but in that way where the hunger didn’t feel real, like it was a separate entity from his body. He collided with Malfoy on the way in.
“It’s no big deal.” Harry buttered himself one of Draco’s scones next, trying to avoid his gaze. He realised now what it was he’d seen in Draco’s face: the same thing he’d seen in Ginny’s whenever she’d wanted sex.
And if he was even more honest than that…all he really wanted to do with his time was to be with the people he cared about. He hadn’t seen Teddy in weeks, he hadn’t properly hung out with anyone outside of Friday pub nights, and he’d love to get more than a handful of hours with Draco that weren’t spent doing homework. He missed their discussions. He missed eating lemon meringue tart with Draco in the Archive garden while talking about house-elves.
“I think your ideas are great. I’ll support you, whatever you choose to do,” Draco said. “I think this…it suits you. It’s very heroic.”
He could envision it—for a barn it was small (Harry guessed), having held up to six cows in the stalls, but for people? It could make a decent house. This open space they were standing in was large enough for a kitchen and living room, and probably a pantry, and the area with the stalls that wasn’t already occupied by Draco’s wood workshop could become something else, and the entire hayloft could easily house several bedrooms and a bathroom. It was all very dark and dim, however, and dusty, and it felt cramped. It
“I know, but Muggles think wizards and witches all wear pointy hats,” Harry explained. “You know, like on the covers of those novels. And my cousin used to be terrified of magic and wizards, might still be, so…go all out?”
Sooner or later Harry would get to see his home, he was sure. When he was ready to take Harry there, probably, or for some other reason. It didn’t matter. Well, not entirely—Harry had the spare key to his own flat in his pocket, the key that had once been Ginny’s. He’d nearly given it to Draco on the weekend already; he’d been so delighted to have him there, in his kitchen, making food. Draco’s pleased smile when Harry had liked the meal, and the soft kisses he’d let Harry sneak…it all added up to a certainty that, well, that Harry was definitely beyond the point of no return.
“Emergency of some sort or other, I don’t know.” Ron shrugged. “She’ll be back, or she won’t. What’s up?”
“But…you were raised amongst Muggles, weren’t you? You probably know all about this stuff.” Malfoy’s cheeks were still red, but he looked less embarrassed and more curious. “What was it like?”
“Yeah, another time,” Harry said, feeling cold. “All right, so, I’ll…” he gestured at the coroner reports Malfoy had already looked at with the notes he was still holding on to—slightly crumpled, Harry realised, from clutching them too hard. “Deal with this. Be right back.”
“Do you think the brooms will want to fly now?” Harry had already reset the brooms, but maybe he should see a technician about an inspection. This was the third time in two weeks that his toy brooms had picked up on a child’s feelings, which was an uncommon problem for him to have.
“This,” Harry said, gesturing at the shelf. “He, well, he likes romance novels. The really dramatic ones. But he also likes science fiction and fantasy—I think science fiction a bit more? He likes the ones with queer characters and relationships in them. Uhm. I don’t know what else. I don’t know which ones he already has, aside from that one.” He indicated the book Draco had lent him the first time around, the one with the spaceship on the cover. The one about the mixed crew of humans and aliens and the varied ways they loved each other.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure he understood, but Malfoy’s enthusiasm was rubbing off on him. “Yeah, I think so? But I’m not sure talking teacups would be able to form functional societies with, like, social structures and all, and, uhm, have sex.”
There was also the option of not telling her anything at all, but how then would Harry account for being home late? Nothing wasn’t an adequate explanation and lying was not an option at all.
“I’m Harry, and I’m your coach and captain and…we are going to win a chocolate trophy, isn’t that right?”
Draco, on the other hand…looked fantastic. His outfit was all browns and blues with specks of white; brown robes in a textured wool and silk blend, with a high collar and a simple cut with two rows of buttons—ordinarily Harry would’ve thought this kind of robes looked monk-ish, but Draco looked tall and slim and completely ordinary, nothing like the monks Harry had seen pictures of as a child. The robes were cut so a white shirt cuff showed at the sleeves, and a white collar peeked out at the neck. Over the robes he had on a leather cape dyed a dusty sky blue, with a row of brown buttons at the split sleeves, currently closed. The cape was on asymmetrically, covering only one shoulder and held in place with a braided leather strap that went across his chest and under the other arm rather than going over both shoulders. The hat was the masterpiece that tied the entire outfit together (or so Draco and the tailor both had said), being of the same blue leather as the cape. It was pointy, but did not droop; it was all straight lines and geometric perfection, one side of the brim pinned to the hat with a brown button and a large, white, fluffy feather. The cape and the hat together elevated the look (Draco had said) and made it look jaunty and modern—a big concern, since he would be wearing a
“…Bill helped me set up some investments or something at Gringotts, I don’t really know what, but the profits of that is what’s keeping the daycare running,” Harry admitted. “I was thinking I could ask him for help with the funds for the team.”
Harry closed the book carefully and put the stack down on the desk. “Thank you,” he said, again, keenly aware that he’d been given a tremendous gift. He still felt breathless. “Now. Let’s see about those murders, shall we?”
Draco’s pink cheeks and stern demeanour were delightful, and Harry wanted nothing more than to look at him for the rest of his life. He’d never tire of this sight.
“And these are your weapons?” she indicated the pile of bath bombs on the counter she was sorting into bags. Harry had bought so many that she was divvying his into three bags.
“Hi.” Ginny looked at the book in his hands, then at the other three books sitting on the coffee table. “You got books.”
“There’s a Little League tournament starting up. It’s a charity fundraising thing, only a few games, and the prize is a,” Harry leaned in to whisper, “chocolate trophy.”
“Okay,” Harry said, slowly, absorbing this new information. “But if house-elves don’t belong to the family, then how come they serve them?”
“Sometimes. I think Mum realised if she wasn’t going to accept me, she’d lose me forever. I think she does love me, but just…fails, as a parent and a human being.” Peony shrugged. “But I…I can’t trust her, not after everything. I should’ve known that sooner, given how she treated you, and you’re the closest family I have that isn’t my parents.”
“Not as often as I’d like, actually…here, this one I use a lot at the moment.” Harry plucked a purple cloud shaped bath bomb from a nearby basket and handed it to Malfoy. “This one is a seasonal product, so I’m grabbing a bunch more of these today before they’re all gone.”
Betty made a victory loop around the other kids, whooping and cheering, and then released the Snitch. Alice went after it right away.
“That’s all right,” Harry said, ordering the documents off the shelves and into the trolley he’d brought. “They’ll sort themselves back into their own places when I take them downstairs. I just need to verify that there’s nothing missing.” He tapped the ex libris list for the room with his wand and watched the items on it lit up and burn black as everything returned to the trolley.
The dishes were quick work, even if Draco took every opportunity to give Harry kisses with every item he handed him.
“I think it smells like the burnt caramel Mum made once, but like if she put grass in it,” Betty said.
Malfoy turned and left. The door closed behind him with a snick, and Harry stared at it resentfully.
think is important, or something someone else told you is important?” Draco asked, and he sounded so much like Gladys that Harry felt a little bad for putting him in this situation to start with. “Because I’m going to be honest here and say it sounds like you don’t really believe a word of what you’re saying.”
He turned left at the crossroads, past Gringotts, and towards the bookshop. Malfoy looked like a person who liked to read, maybe. He was very quick about those reports, and the only other person Harry knew who could go through a pile of documents that large as quickly, was Hermione. What kind of books would Malfoy enjoy? Non-fiction? Too easy a guess, Harry decided, just because he liked to spend hours reading about grisly deaths, that didn’t necessarily mean he liked non-fiction in general.
He’s not gone for good, Harry told himself, but didn’t believe it. Ginny also hadn’t gone for good when she’d gone, except then she had. What if Draco did write back, and what if he said he definitely wanted to end their relationship? What if he never wrote back at all and just stayed gone, the days dragging on and on until, finally, Harry would lose all hope of him coming back?
forget,” Harry protested. “I never forget when you promise me food. Gin, tell him. I didn’t forget.”
“Well…” Harry decided to eat dumplings instead of answering. How could he possibly begin to describe Draco?
Harry glanced at his feet. The hem of his cloak was muddy, as were his shoes. “I did just get off a broom,” Harry told him. “It’s my other job, remember.”
For a press event, Harry didn’t think it was too bad. It helped that he wasn’t the only famous person present; the reporters were just as interested in Lorcan d’Eath, who’d surprised everyone when he’d come back from obscurity to coach a Little League team, as they were in the brains behind the project (Oliver was positively radiating with pride), or Harry.
Ginny hesitated. “I—yes, okay.” She let Harry lead her a few steps away, to relative privacy—a few reporters were still hanging around and were no doubt taking covert photos of the two of them. “What’s this about? Is it about us? Getting back together?”
, and their life had to go on. He could just…keep teaching little ones all about flying and Quidditch and finger-painting and how to be friends and what respect was and everything.
“No, I need to get back to work.” Harry stood with him. “I’ll come by when we close to look at those books.”
“That’s an interesting look you’ve got there,” Malfoy said, pointing his fork at Harry’s face. “I’ll tell you one thing. Therapy is hard. It’s ugly. It requires commitment.”
“Yes!” Harry threw up his hands. “I don’t know! But there’s no other metric, is there? It’s why we have the sodding law in the first place, isn’t it?”
“Good game, Harry,” Oliver said. “Though you had a run for your money. The teams were evenly matched today.”
The stadium was enchanted with anti-Apparition wards, so they had to get outside the boundary to leave. Harry tugged Draco off.
Come Friday, he was exhausted. He’d cancelled lunch with Hermione—actually, he’d cancelled and declined every single social commitment that week—so he could spend his lunch break owling parents the training schedule and the tentative dates for the first games he’d received from Pomeroy. The cut-off for joining the League wasn’t for another week, and the real schedule wouldn’t be drawn up and revealed until after that.
“Originally I wanted to build a brand new house,” Draco admitted. “But then I set up my workshop here, and…I thought I could transform it into something else. It’s an ugly old stone building with a leaky roof, but it could become something beautiful. I thought—I hoped, really, that we could create a home here together, something that’s tailor-made for both of us. Nobody has lived here before except for cows and probably mice and maybe some birds, but it’s still got history, you know? It’s…I
The Little League games were played on a proper Quidditch pitch, but on a smaller scale; the goalposts had been lowered so the highest ring was at fifteen feet and the lowest at six, and they’d been moved closer to the centre of the field. The entire match was contained, so that if the players or the balls touched the invisible boundary, they were gently guided alongside it until they veered back.
Or maybe it was his imagination. He didn’t think so. Not after everything—not just their shared history, but
Pansy was giving Harry a knowing look over her own pint glass. Harry ignored it and decided to change the subject. “What’s Malfoy been up to lately?” he asked her. “You haven’t mentioned him in a while.”
Seamus raised his own pint in greeting. “Did you start early? The metaphors don’t usually come out until much later,” he said.
Letting out a small sigh of relief now that the hard part was over, Harry stood up. “Betty, go wash your hands. Let’s get you a drink of water, Hugh, and then we’ll go outside and join the others, all right?”
Harry leafed through it all, slowly remembering his last session with Gladys and why she’d sent him all this stuff. He took it all back to the kitchen and sat down to read, picking up his toast again.
Harry startled. “That’s not why we broke up.” Had their issues really been that transparent? Did everyone know that…well, that they hadn’t been working out? “You can’t have known I’m…or Ginny…you know.”
And then the worry had set in. Worry that they’d lose the next game since training had gone so spectacularly badly, worry that Harry would never figure out how to break his bad patterns, worry that Draco would get tired of him, worry that he would never be able to look at Ginny again without thinking about how they’d mistreated each other, worry that he’d never have a family of his own, worry that he was a crap Quidditch captain, worry that he would fail his Archive Studies, worry that the maple tree would never heal, worry that Alice would grow to be scared of her own magic, worry that he would never be good enough for Draco, worry that everything would soon be ending, just stopping, ceasing to be, without him being able to do a single thing about it.
They were still evenly matched, but they’d had about eight weeks to improve their flying, their playing, and their teamwork, so the teams that were playing now were barely recognisable. Harry had trained his players well; the rotations were nearly seamless and they all worked well together, but the viciousness with which they handled the Quaffle today was something new. Avery, Denise, and Dorcas had just successfully passed the Quaffle between them in a zig-zag pass around the other team’s Chasers, Denise making for the goal—and scoring—and while Harry had practised this move with them over the past weeks, seeing them execute it so perfectly and confidently was humbling.
“Is that why your hair sometimes has glitter in it?” Malfoy asked, glancing at Harry’s hair. “I assumed it had something to do with your daycare work, but…”
“Good afternoon,” Harry said, offering him his best customer service smile. Ron claimed it made Harry look absolutely frightening, but Hermione had given it one look and said
“Yeah, yeah, I was just…I have so much to do. All this stuff, my evening courses—I started the Archive Course, which, well, you wouldn’t know about because I only just started it…I’m sorry we haven’t talked.” He squeezed her hand, then started walking her back to Rhosyn. “I’ve missed you.”
Harry was very aware that Blaise hadn’t brought a guy to the pub before and, as far as he knew, was straight…or had been. Nobody at the table was commenting on it, or in some other way drawing attention to it—it wasn’t that it bothered Harry, but he was unsettled anyway, as if something had gone off-script.
“No,” Draco said. “I’m not ready for any of that.” He sat up, breaking contact, and leaned forwards over his knees instead, hugging them. “I’m sorry.”
Caught out, Harry stared at his plate and his tart. Suddenly he didn’t want to finish it. “I learned that…that the War was our own making, and that if we don’t want it to happen again, then we have to fix ourselves.”
Ginny nodded, getting up. “Yeah. I don’t know what…I’ll leave.” She left her mug of tea, still untouched. “Can I ask you something?”
“So…theoretically, I could call up the entire collection of coroner reports and keep in here until I’m done with them?” Malfoy was inspecting the empty shelves.
She narrowed her eyes at him, as if trying to decide what kind of bug he was, but then she shrugged. “Next time,
He tore a blank page out of his notebook and scribbled on top: possible careers. And then he started making a list, anything and everything he could think of. By the time class ended, he’d filled half the page.
“All right,” Harry said, finding his Big Voice. It wasn’t as scary as his Authoritative Voice, but it was firm and very effective at making scared kids believe he had any kind of control over the situation at hand. “Pick up your brooms and come over here.”
“Oh,” Alice mouthed, realising everyone was staring at her. She raised her arm, holding the Snitch aloft for everyone to see. “I got it?”
“You, go sit in that corner, and you, go sit in the other corner. Stay there until I come back. Do not look at each other, do not speak to each other and do not move. No tricks, understand?” Harry said to them, rather more sharply than he intended to. Hugh’s lip started wobbling, but he went to sit. So did Betty.
Malfoy looked up from the report he was pouring over. There was a thin wrinkle in his forehead. “It is that hour, is it?” He sounded distracted. “My apologies.” He glanced at the report, then at the trolley. “I haven’t finished.”
“If you win, tap it with two fingers, like so,” Draco demonstrated, without actually touching his badge. “Don’t do it now—it’ll only work once.”
And now they’d be facing Candy Cranes again. The other semi-final game was Fishes versus Dragonriders—and if Butterfly Bumpkins proceeded to the finals, it was 50:50 who they’d compete against.
“I do work here,” Harry said, trying his best winning smile on Malfoy. “Come on, have lunch with me. I’m not on the clock for the next hour.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “It was nice to meet you,” he said to Rhosyn. It probably wasn’t a lie. She looked nice, at any rate. “I need to get going—”
“Is that why you’ve been impossible to get in touch with?” Ron asked. “I heard from Mum that Ginny had been at home since Saturday last week. She asked me to check in with you, only you’ve been an elusive bastard.”
“I’m trying to make friends with you,” Malfoy said. He glanced at Harry quickly, then looked ahead again. “I didn’t know how else to do it.”
“Maybe I won’t give it a name.” Draco put the notebook into a pocket. “I…do I need to do anything? About the study, I mean. Do I need to sign anything?”
It was a short walk to the College; back to Direction Alley and then down the small path past the Archive which led onto Toothill Square, where the College was tucked in between the Archive Garden and the White Hart.
Harry put the course pamphlet, which he’d been using as a bookmark, between the pages of the book he was reading, and closed it. He’d started with the science fiction novel. “Hi,” he said.
Malfoy was in the foyer when Harry arrived. Malfoy typically didn’t show up until around one, after Harry clocked in, but they were both early today, it looked like. Harry tried—though not very hard—to hide just how pleased he was to see him.
He’d rotated Alice back in as Seeker with twenty minutes to go before the game would be called, and they were twenty points behind. They could catch up easily, but Alice was determined to catch the Snitch this time.
“If you hadn’t gotten with Draco…” She wiped her cheeks one more time. “Would you have considered getting back together with me?”
When had he last felt so exhilarated? When he had asked Draco on a date. Kissed him for the first time. Harry smoothed his hand over the list. Yes, he thought. This is what I want.
They exchanged hasty of-course-see-you-later smiles, and Harry left them to enjoy the game. He was the only one who’d come out today; everyone else was nursing hangovers and Ron was manning the shop. Hermione had some prior commitment as well, though Harry couldn’t recall what it was, or even when he’d last seen her. He made a note to book her for lunch soon.
The vacant, dead look in Malfoy’s eyes was slightly unnerving, so Harry cleared his throat. Malfoy’s eyes brightened and he turned his attention to Harry, though his face remained expressionless. “Here’s the documents you requested. We close at five. No beverages or any other liquids are allowed in here. Don’t write on the documents. Any questions?”
“Yes, yes, but use the bat next time,” Harry said, still wtf’ing. “How’s your hand? Did you hurt yourself?”
“Listen,” Draco said, one thumb resting just on the edge of Harry’s bottom lip. “There is something we need to set straight. We don’t have to have sex if you don’t want to—”
“I have to return these to the strongroom they came from,” Harry said. “I can check them out for you again tomorrow.”
“Wow,” Harry finally said, his tongue feeling thick. “That’s—not what I expected. Du—P, what the hell? Where is all this coming from?”
“Yes, yes that was a brilliant game, both teams gave their all, and it was anyone’s guess who’d have won in the end,” he said, grinning happily. “Of course I’m happy my team won! I’m sure Dragonriders will get the next one.”
And now Harry was here, two days later, at a Muggle library and looking for Dudley in the phone book, because
“Yes, I…haven’t actually tried any of the bath bombs yet,” Draco confessed. “It’s embarrassing, but I’m kind of intimidated.”
To Harry’s surprise, Draco blushed crimson. Not just his face either, his ears were red, and his neck, and Harry was sure if he unbuttoned Draco’s robes the rest of the way, his chest would be aflame as well.
“Oh.” Draco stood there for a bit, then seemed to deflate. “I need to apologise too. I brought you lunch—eat with me?”
“Thanks.” Harry put it away in a pocket. This new cloak had properly charmed pockets, so the notebook disappeared entirely, leaving not a single trace in the drape of the fabric. “Uhm, Gin—this is Draco,” he then said, conscious of the fact she’d declined to meet him, but also the fact that they’d literally bumped into each other. “Draco, Ginny.”
Yesterday’s game had had a much smaller field, but both teams had been frustrated by the experience, so Oliver, Faulkner, and Pomeroy had all agreed to expand it for today’s game and see if it would work better.
“Well done, Denise!” Harry yelled as Denise scored the first goal of the game. Dorcas picked up the Quaffle before it touched the grass and threw it to Avery, who passed it to Denise, who made another pass at the goal—and scored again. “THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!”
“Lov-lovely to meet you,” Peony said to Draco, glancing between them. “This is Julie. Uhm. My girlfriend. Uhm.”
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t snooping—I mean—I was just…curious,” Harry said, retreating to a professional distance. His ears were burning. “I guess that actually means I was snooping.”
Turning, Harry saw that Draco was standing alone near the exit. Of course. Draco. Harry’s belly flipped. “You don’t want to say hi?” he asked her.
“Harry?” Mildred appeared in the doorway to the break room. “There you are, love. I think your friend is waiting for you.”
“We haven’t been dating that long,” Draco finally said, sitting up a bit straighter. His shoulders were still tense. “It’s not you, I promise, you’re very attractive and I want you very much, I just—I need more time.”
“Okay you know what, I’m taking my lunch and leaving,” Harry said, though he made no move to actually get up.
“You should have big emotions all the time,” Harry said, concerned now. “Big emotions aren’t wrong or scary, even though it can seem like that sometimes. But do you know what you can do the next time you have a big emotion and get scared?”
“Yes—well, actually, I’m almost done with this lot, so would like to get some more reports up.” Malfoy had sorted the documents neatly, and was retaining a small pile. “I have the reference numbers copied down of some of the other reports I looked at before, if I could have those up too?”
“Bloody hell,” Harry muttered, eyes flicking over the pages of the article, too fast to really read them as he tried to take in everything at once. He’d thought he’d figured everything out when he’d found out about asexuality—mostly, anyway—but now more pieces were slotting into place.
Stories about pirates, maybe? Or dragons and damsels in distress? Muggles liked to read about magic and dragons and villain-defying heroes, Harry knew, but he’d lived through what would probably be several books’ worth of magic and dragons and defeating villains, so he, at least, did not want to read about that sort of thing. Maybe Malfoy didn’t either.
“Well, Harry, you have been avoiding us lately,” Hermione said and picked up her own food. “I thought we’d have to drag it out of you.”
“And those happy endings are at the pub?” Draco shook his head. “Whatever. I’ll come. But I won’t drink.”
“I’d love to,” Harry admitted. “But I don’t want to leave you alone in the kitchen all that time. Seems pretty rude to me.”
“Fair.” Malfoy stood. “I want to get back to my research. I can leave the umbrella for you if you’d like.”
“Yes!” Malfoy said. He was still sitting by the desk, and it was awkward, talking to him like this, but there wasn’t a second chair in the study. Malfoy seemed to realise this, because he rose from the chair, picking up his notebook and pencil. “It was cosy,” he said. “Like…mundane. Just people existing. Loving other people. Or aliens.”
That familiar flare of rage smouldered in Harry’s gut, but he was almost too exhausted to let it live. “Yeah, it’s amazing the difference it makes when I’m actually free to be who I am without my aunt and uncle punishing me for every little thing,” he retorted.
The rest of his tiny daycare were already practicing the task he’d set them: throwing Quaffles between them, while also moving in a circle. He’d get them zooming around soon enough, for now balancing on a broom, controlling the broom, and also keeping an eye on a Quaffle (not to mention catching the thing and sending it off again) was proving a challenge for them. They were only four and five years old; they were still developing their coordination skills.
All right, not a Seeker, then. Harry jotted it down. He went over all the kids this way; most knew which position they wanted to play, but a handful weren’t sure or wanted to play all the positions. That was fine, his team was large enough that he could rotate them out and allow everyone to play all the positions they liked and give everyone a turn on the pitch as well.
to teach the kids) orchestrating a close meeting with the grass for the other Seeker. The scores were even: if Candy Cranes got ahead by ten points, the Butterfly Bumpkins were quick to catch up or overtake them, and vice versa. There were a few more fouls and resulting penalty shots (Charlie and Rachel blocked them all, which had Harry and Ginny both jumping and screaming) and Love managed to not bash anyone’s nose in, though she did steal an opposing Beater’s bat one time to throw it back at his head.
“I know.” Draco huffed. “Go run that bath. I only need to put the scones in the oven. They won’t take long.”
The meadow was bathed in sunlight and the grass swayed in the wind, the bunnies that lived in it running hither and thither. Malfoy didn’t pay attention to any of it.
. He didn’t need a week to think about what he wanted out of this relationship, he already bloody knew what he wanted.
“We’ll still be around,” Dean said. “Ireland’s connected to the UK Floo Network. But come visit sometime? Bring your date if things go well?”
It couldn’t work out. It couldn’t possibly work out. Even if there was a chance Malfoy might…Harry knew that he would only bring awkwardness and void to the table. But maybe, just maybe...they could be friends.
“I doubt you mean that, but thank you,” Malfoy said, then started down the hallway. Harry watched him go until he’d turned the corner and vanished out of sight.
Thank you for reading all the way to the end! I hope you enjoyed the fic! Don't forget to leave the artist (the ever-wonderful
He should ask Pansy about those parties, turn the discussion away from his new status of being single—knowing her, she might try to set him up with someone, or…want to know details, which was worse.
“Okay. Good. Thank you.” Harry sat again, suddenly exhausted. The food still wasn’t appealing, so he ignored his plate, which had floated over and was now bobbing in front of him, like some kind of buoyant little creature. Harry pushed it away. “There
Draco, bless him, and Harry had never loved him more, tried to distract Harry from his own head all weekend, going with him to the pub on Friday, taking him out for a date to the bookshop in Godric’s Hollow on Saturday, and filling his kitchen with the scent of freshly baked bread.
“Yeah. It’s just nice. There’s not that much more to it, really,” Harry said. He put his own cup down and sent the tray away.
Harry’s mouth felt dry, despite having just had a sip of water. “Harry,” he said. “Just Harry.” He was still clutching the pamphlet, which had gone all crumply in his hand.
“No,” Harry replied, snappish. He couldn’t help it, but it stung—he’d wanted to marry Ginny and have kids and a nice house and everything. But she hadn’t wanted kids, and she hadn’t wanted to get married. And in the end they’d broken up.
She followed his line of sight. “Yeah,” she said. Her voice was as hoarse as Harry’s was, but he thought maybe he detected something else in it. “Don’t be long.”
“Draco rearranged the cupboards the way he likes,” Harry told her. His throat tightened. “The tea is over here now.” His voice wavered, so he didn't elaborate—he didn't want to start crying again, not in front of Ginny. He turned away from her, pretending he was only getting the tea, and then making it, and not hiding from her.
Malfoy wasn’t having it. “No, you do not get to pass that Bludger to me. Not again. What exactly do you mean?”
“Oi, Thomas.” Blaise leaned over the table to speak to Dean. “Gilliam’s mum owns an art gallery and has a spot open for a show next week—I sang your praises from here to Sunday, so get in touch?” He fished a business card out of his breast pocket. “I know it’s short notice, but she had an unexpected drop-out.”
Ginny turned around again, a long-suffering look on her face. Rhosyn, on the other hand, was clearly trying to keep her laughter contained. “He hasn’t talked about anything else at practice all week,” she said. “Which, if you ask me, is pretty weird because having a date in a barn is one thing, but deciding to
Draco went back to the kitchen and Harry made his way to the bathroom, where he promptly shed all of his soaked clothing and stuffed it all into the washing machine, along with the contents of the laundry basket. He’d just slipped on a bathrobe when Malfoy came in.
