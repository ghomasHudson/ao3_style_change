Harry looked around and finally saw what Ron was talking about. His bedframe had been decorated with large cut out paper hearts with Harry’s face and phrases like “Have a Harry Valentine’s day!” and “Love, laugh, Harry!” on them. To his horror, he also saw that rose petals had been strewn across his bed.
Draco turned his unwilling eyes onto Hermione now. “Perhaps. I … maybe. I think so.” He said, turning his back to them and staring into the fire.
“Just go slow.”
Even so, there was still a strain in his relationship with Ron. Those first few days, Ron would hardly look at Harry. He could feel the unasked questions hanging in the air between them. If he reached out, he thought he could cut through the tension like water. He wanted to say that he was sorry, he wanted to scream it until he was hoarse, but what good would it do? Although he knew Malfoy was the one responsible for Ron almost dying, he’d still gone ahead and kissed him. Harry knew that in itself was unforgivable, but then you also had to take all the lies into account. He tried to think that his actions could be at least partially justified by his lack of proof before the confession, but it felt dishonest. He’d been so suspicious at the beginning - why had he let himself been lulled into comfort? Why had he let himself be seduced? Was he truly so deprived of physical attention? Did he really crave intimate caresses that badly? He didn’t think so. The only other explanation was that feeling he’d felt even during the last meeting, the one that set his limbs ablaze and made his head fog up...
To finally feel Draco, hot and tight, around his hard cock was blissful. Draco was on his back, legs wrapped around Harry. He met each of Harry’s strokes with a thrust of his hips, making Harry moan in a way that wasn’t entirely dignified.
my help. I understand that your father being hauled off to Azkaban has upset you, but you’ve merely had a taste of the consequences, should you fail. Just remember that I have sworn the unbreakable oath, so it’s not just your life you’re throwing away.”
After that, Harry thought it best to put off any sneaking around for a while. He even took the risk and told Draco as much by slipping a note into his cauldron at the end of one of their potions lessons, just to make sure Draco didn’t think Harry no longer wanted to do the thing he’d said he’d do. Lying Ron in the face didn’t feel right. However, it had to be preferable to Ron finding out about his actual whereabouts. He already knew how Ron would react – if he would even believe it. Harry had to remind himself that Ron’s feelings towards Malfoy, considering how he’d suffered insults from the entire Malfoy family all his life, were justified. Even so, he couldn't bare coming clean. He could imagine the disgusted look on Ron's face all too well. As for Hermione, he didn't think she'd receive the news all too well either.
Harry and Ron snuck up the stairs and back through the dark corridor that led to the drawing room, leaving Wormtail’s body lying on the basement floor. Dean, Luna, and Ollivander had all apparated away with Dobby. They peered in through the open door and saw Bellatrix standing over the goblin, Hermione lying lifeless on the floor at her feet. Lucius was watching with an almost bored expression from his seat by the fire, while Narcissa and Draco had retreated to the other end of the room and stood silent. Greyback was standing as close to Bellatrix as he seemed to dare, his hungry eyes on Hermione.
His hands ran down Draco’s back and his fingers graced over skin rising in hard ridges like the jagged edge of a blade. Harry paused in momentary confusion and Draco shuffled away from him uncomfortably, but Harry grabbed his hands.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I don’t see you coming laden with gifts either, Malfoy.”
As he said it, the diadem suddenly glowed red and hot. Draco dropped it with a gasp, and it fell to the stone floor with a loud ringing sound.
“Fine”, Draco sighed. Then he paused for a moment, before continuing. “When I was little, my mom used to take me to the local muggle cinema. She didn’t much want to, but I begged and begged her for weeks. She’s never been very good at telling me no. The two of us would go and see all sorts of strange muggle films, guess you don’t really need moving pictures when you have those. Then my father decided it wasn’t good for me, so we stopped going.”
Harry ignored this. “Did you poison Ron?” he asked flatly.
“I don’t know”, he settled on. “Maybe. I don’t know what to think. It all just sort of happened.”
Draco’s free hand was caressing the inside of Harry’s thigh, pushing a leg up before adding another finger. Wave’s of pleasure washed over Harry with every push and pull.
“Well, yeah.”
“You’re giving me money? You’ve
“Snape!” Harry spat. “He’s the one who told Voldemort of the prophecy!”
“You’ll leave marks.”
me money?” Harry said in disbelief.
Harry almost stumbled. “Malfoy and Hermione?” he said, trying to feign the right amount of chock and disgust. “Now,
Ron looked around and deemed the coast to be clear.
He wasn’t surprised when both Lupin and Mr. Weasley presented him with the same arguments when he told them what he’d overheard, later that evening. The exchange put him in a worse mood anyway, and in the middle of Celestina bellowing the chorus of “You stole my cauldron, but you can’t have my heart” over the radio, he excused himself and slipped upstairs. In Ron’s room, he fumbled through a pile of dirty clothes and found the Marauder’s map in one of his pockets.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sore spot?” Harry said, raising an eyebrow, but he regretted it immediately. If it wasn’t for what had happened with his father at the ministry, Draco would surely be bragging about being Slughorn’s new favorite and attending all the Slug-club happenings.
“What about the diadem?” Hermione coughed.
At first, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Draco was standing hunched over one of the sinks, hands clasped around the edges of the chipped white marble. Harry could see Draco’s face through the cracked mirror. It was slightly distorted, but the red, swollen eyes and wet cheeks were visible through Draco’s shocked expression. He had undoubtedly been crying. Harry slowed down, his wand in his hand but his arm lowered, staring in shock at the blonde boy. The sobs that had been shaking his body subsided, and Draco’s expression quickly turned into one of fury. With clenched teeth he gripped the wand lying on the edge of the sink and spun around.
He saw that triumphant I-was-right smile flash across her face and knew she’d bought it.
Everyone seem to think they know something.
“Oh, I don’t think so, Draco”, Dumbledore said softly, slipping further down the wall he was leaning against. Harry wondered if Draco realized just how weak Dumbledore was. “You’ve had a long time to kill me, yet you haven’t done it.”
!” Hermione called, having caught up to Ron and grabbed his arm.
Harry was silent. They hadn’t heard the desperation in Draco’s voice, hadn’t seen him trembling, or lowering his wand. To Harry it seemed clear that Draco was aware that his actions were closing in on evil, but that he felt compelled by family obligation, fear, and perhaps destiny, to walk that path. Like Harry was compelled to walk his own. Even so, Draco could have chosen differently, or at least done if faster. In the end, Snape was the one Harry truly hated.
Christmas is arriving at Hogwarts, but is anyone in the Christmas spirit this year?
“What happened after we escaped?” Harry brought himself to ask.
“Missed me?” Harry asked teasingly.
“So? Was it good enough?” He asked.
“Ow”, Ron said rubbing his neck once Harry released him. “What was that for?”
He tried to make up for the last few months by immersing himself in work. He caught up on all his schoolwork, focused on quidditch, and with some help Felix Felicis he even managed to complete Dumbledore’s task. They refrained from saying Malfoy’s name. Ron and Lavender broke up and Ron cheerfully started talking to Harry about what girls they should date next, to Harry’s bewildered amusement. Time passed by in a blur and he could barely spare Draco a thought. In class he ignored the other boy, even though he could feel Draco staring at him.
When he looked back to Hermione, he saw she wasn’t paying attention to him anymore. Ron, Lavender and Parvati were heading their way and a foxlike smile had crept onto Hermione’s face.
Harry was content with that, especially since he didn’t know exactly how good he’d be at giving when he was this close to coming. He kissed Draco’s lips, his neck, wherever his mouth connected with skin. He was shaking, he couldn’t bare it much longer.
Harry stood. For a moment he wavered. He thought of sitting back down, stroking Draco’s hair, brushing their lips together, but of course he couldn’t do that. Instead he settled for squeezing Draco’s shoulder lightly, before pulling on the cloak and heading back for Gryffindor tower.
” Harry called when she didn’t listen.
It felt like an eternity, but in truth barely a minute had passed. The dust hadn’t even settled yet. As they stood up, the world seemed to return to normal speed again. Curses swooshed through the air around them, and Harry had to pull Draco to the side to avoid getting hit by a jet of green.
Ron at least had the decency to look ashamed. “Well, we ran into her in Honeydukes and asked if she was going with anyone to Slughorn’s party, but she said she was but that it was none of my business.”
They were herded further into Malfoy Manor, to the drawing room. The grand room had dark red walls clad with portraits Harry had to assume were previous generations of Malfoy’s, based on their blonde hair and the air of distaste they all emitted as the prisoners were led through their halls. Harry’s eyes were swollen, but he could see well enough to take in the grandeur of the place. The fireplace was bristling with yellow flames that lighted up the giant chandelier that hung from the ceiling, the crystal casting specks of light across the room. Lucius Malfoy’s drawling voice reached Harry’s ears and he went cold. How they would get out of there alive, before any of the Death Eaters managed to summon Voldemort, he could scarcely imagine.
“I suppose I am.”
“Shit, I’ll come at this rate”, Harry finally admitted as the sensation building up deep within his stomach became too much to ignore.
“Fred!” one of them screamed, Harry wasn’t certain who.
Ron stood gaping at Draco in wild disbelief. Even Harry had trouble understanding what just had happened, although he supposed Draco didn’t truly understand the significance of what he’d just done.
Draco kissed him again and, with some struggling, he unbuttoned Harry’s trousers and slid his hand over the outside of Harry’s boxers. Harry breathed shakily as Draco slowly, slowly, painfully slowly, pulled his boxers down. Without a moment’s hesitation, Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry’s cock and began stroking steadily, wetting his hand with spit and precum. Harry moaned and pressed their lips together again, moving his hips with each stroke. Harry’s hand went for Draco’s trousers, but Draco grabbed his wrist.
Harry stood staring at the blank piece of wall, as he so often had the last few days. After a few seconds of hard thinking, a polished wooden door appeared in the stone. That was a first, Harry thought in annoyance as he, after taking one last look around him, pushed it open and stepped inside. The room was smaller than it had been the last time he’d been there. The stone floor was almost entirely covered in carpet and large tapestries hung on the walls. The only furniture in the room was a wooden drawer and a large four poster bed, on which Draco Malfoy lay sprawled.
Malfoy shook his head. “He would’ve killed me and my family. Dumbledore trusts Snape, and Snape would’ve told
Harry knew that it was the end. He’d come to die. Voldemort raised his wand, pointing it at Harry’s heart. Inexplicably, Harry thought of Draco, and how his lips had felt against his own. Then there was a flash of green and everything disappeared.
“Drop the wands or the mudblood dies”, Bellatrix said, and a vicious grin spread across her face.
It had been a good twenty minutes before Draco opened the door and wearily stepped inside.
The next unwanted theory came a few days later, but from Ron.
“I’ll cum”, Harry moaned.
They were led into the basement, all of them except Hermione. They could hear her screams before the heavy door was even shut behind them. Ron kept calling out for her, and only seeing Luna and Ollivander made him fall silent. Hermione’s screams continued as they slowly freed themselves from the ropes, using the rusty old nail Luna provided them with. Harry searched in desperation after a way to get out. He spilled out the contents of the pouch he’d gotten from Hagrid, waving the Phoenix wand around in a manner that would’ve been dangerous, had the wand not been entirely lifeless. The snitch Dumbledore had given him was as useless as his wand and screaming their location at the eye he thought he saw flash in the broken mirror Sirius had given him didn’t seem to do much good either.
“What if you don’t want to produce an heir with a pure-blood?”
Draco was already waiting when Harry got there.
Harry didn’t see Draco outside of class for the rest of the week. He wouldn’t have dared to go back to Myrtle’s bathroom anyway, not when half the school seemed to have subscribed to Ron’s theory and was spreading rumors Draco was really dating her. When Saturday rolled around, Harry wondered if Draco had gotten cold feet, but when he awoke that morning he found the enchanted coin burning hot. Hermione wasn’t pleased to hear he was abandoning her, but she seemed somewhat appeased when Harry ensured her it was to catch up on his schoolwork. After the majority of the students had left the castle to go into Hogsmeade, Harry slipped on his invisibility cloak and left Gryffindor tower.
Harry wanted to be alone with his thoughts. Ever since he and Draco had started, well whatever it was they had started, Harry had tried his best not to think about what had led up to it happening in the first place. He couldn’t be kissing Draco and think he was a Death Eater at the same time. So, he’d pushed those thoughts away, tried to forget about his suspicion – no, conviction – that Draco was in liege with Voldemort. Now, he cursed himself for letting his guard down, for losing sight of what was important. He pulled the map out and scanned for Draco. He was there, in the Slytherin dungeon with Crabbe and Goyle. Sighing slightly, Harry tucked the map away, determined that at their next meeting, he would confront Malfoy, so they could go back to hating each other at a distance.
“Harry?” Ron called. “Are you talking to someone?”
“I’m sorry, you know, for some of the things I’ve done and said to you. You didn’t deserve it.”
Draco nodded, seemingly unfaced. Then he glanced back over his shoulder. “Whoever gets here first next time must think very hard of a room with clean sheets.”
“But, now we know he’s definitely up to something, and that he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders.”
After the sudden reunion, their meetings became a regular thing again. Whenever he had time to spare, Harry would slip away to the Room of Requirement to see Draco. At first, the encounters were back to being largely wordless affairs. Some nights the only things they said to each other was “Yes! No! Faster! Harder!” As time passed Draco seemed to warm up ever so slightly towards Harry again.
“Oh, yes, the Death Eaters”, Dumbledore said, as if it was possible to forget about them. “I must admit that I didn’t think it was possible to get Death Eaters into the castle. How did you manage that, if I may ask?” He almost sounded proud now, as if Draco had discovered another twelve uses of dragon’s blood, or something of the like.
“My family”, he said carefully. “Is very concerned with the continuation of our bloodline. As long as I still produce an heir with a pure-blood, I don’t think they’d care.”
“No need for protective spells – I’ve made sure the room won’t let anyone else in.”
“You owe me one, Potter”, Draco said in a soft voice after a few minutes had passed.
Draco spun around again, looking angry. “No, I wasn’t invited. Do you want that in writing or will you take my word for it?”
“I’m so sorry. I didn’t know what that spell did, I shouldn’t have used it.”
“Draco”, Harry started, but fell silent, not knowing what to say.
Harry could feel Draco’s eyes traveling across his body, his chest, his thighs, his hips. He would’ve felt embarrassed if he wasn’t busy examining Draco lying underneath him, letting his hands travel all the way down his front, from his neck, over the sharp collarbones, down his chest, gracing his hips and gently caressing the inside of his thighs and then continuing down his calves. Draco was thinner than Harry had expected, hipbones jutting out and ribs visible.
“Yes”, she said firmly. “I mean, I wouldn’t have been thrilled, but I think it would’ve been good for you to have someone to talk to about what you were feeling.”
Harry was perfectly happy to let Draco push him up against the wall and kiss him. Draco seemed ravenous, his mouth deserting Harry’s after mere seconds to trail kisses down Harry’s neck. Then, Draco dropped to his knees and undid Harry’s belt.
She nodded.
He looked up at Harry again almost defiantly, as if he was expecting resistance. Harry felt his own cheeks heating. He hadn’t known how Draco would react to
Draco bit his lip and looked at Harry with a pained expression. “I want to be with you.”
Harry sank down on the chair next to Draco’s bed and edged it a bit closer. They sat in silence for a few minutes before Harry whispered:
His friends exchanged a look. Then they agreed.
Harry and Draco make up just in time for Valentine's day.
His facial expression didn’t match his sneering tone. His lips formed a soft smile and the look he gave Harry was full of awe. Draco shifted forward and grabbed Harry’s cock and began stroking it as his fingers worked away. Harry’s breath quickened, and he couldn’t stop the moans from escaping his lips.
It was over. After all these years, Voldemort was dead, and Harry was
“Only if you want to”, Harry breathed.
Hermione was struggling similarly beside him, so Harry gave her a hand and pulled her out of a pile of debris. When he looked up, he saw two redheads kneeling on the floor and two bodies laying between them.
When March and Ron’s 17
“Your dear auntie has taught you occlumency? Very well then.”
“Ron!” Harry screamed, and in the distance, he could hear Hermione call out for them, and then he cried “Finite!” and the wall stabilized.
Before Harry could try and deflect the questions, searing pain shot through his scar and The Room of Requirement disappeared before him.
“I gave Slughorn that bottle a long time ago. Months and months ago. You heard Snape, I stopped. I don’t want to be like that anymore, I’ve told – I’ve shown – you that.”
“Be right back, mate”, Harry called as he hurried off, shoving the map into his pocket.
“Not so fast, Potter!” A familiar voice rang behind him.
“Harry … Potter …” the elf whispered, his lips trembling with the effort.
“Harry!” Ron called. “We have to get out of here!”
Draco looked up and turned towards Harry, eyes narrow and arms crossed over his chests.
“This means there’s only the snake left!” Hermione cried out.
Harry wasn’t one to back down, especially not when his friends were being insulted. He also couldn’t exclude that some of Hermione’s house elf fanaticism had rubbed off on him after all.
with Malfoy? You’re sno-”, but Ron broke off, looking away in disgust.
Then Bellatrix burst into the room and panic finally seized hold of Harry.
They returned to Hogwarts a few days after New Year’s. He wanted to try and contact Draco straight away, but he hadn’t even entered the common room before Hermione gave him a parchment roll that told him his next meeting with Dumbledore would take place that night. Once they finally had gotten installed, he told Hermione about what had happened during the party in hushed whispers, while she pointedly ignored Ron and Lavender having a happy reunion, involving a lot of tongue but not a lot of talking, in the armchair next to her.
Draco swallowed and stared. He didn’t say a word. Then lowered his wand slightly. Suddenly, the door burst open and Draco was flung to the side as Death Eaters spilled out onto the ramparts.
It had become a habit for Harry to check the map whenever he had the chance. Before breakfast, between classes, before and after dinner, before bed. At time’s he’d even wake up during the night and check if Draco was still in the Slytherin dungeon. Despite his almost obsessive behavior, Harry never caught Draco being somewhere he wasn’t supposed to be. At night he was in bed, during the day he was in class or moving through the corridors, whenever he didn’t go and completely disappear, of course. Harry couldn’t understand how Draco snuck out of the castle. All the secret passages on the map were being watched, and besides he’d never seen Draco anywhere near them. The more Harry watched the map, the more convinced he became Draco was planning something terrible, with all the effort he put in not to get caught.
“What did you do?” He asked.
“Gee, thanks Ron. Let’s just drop it.”
“See? You really should just drop it, Harry, you’re falling even more behind than usual”, she said, and seeing the look he was shooting her, added: “And if you’re not going to study then at least decide who you are going to take to Slughorn’s Christmas party, I think those fifth year girls over in the corner there are planning to slip you some love potion. I wouldn’t drink anything that Romilda Vane tries to offer you.”
“Where’s Moaning Myrtle?”
“Okay”, Harry said softly, kissing Draco lightly on the neck.
The fiery creatures were still snapping after them, and the billowing smoke made it impossible to see the door. Suddenly, a piercing shriek cut through the haze and Harry dove without hesitation, despite Ron’s warning cries behind him.
Once Draco was satisfied with the reaction he’d gotten, he exchanged his tongue for lubricant-coated fingers. He circled Harry’s wet entrance and Harry couldn’t keep his eyes shut for this. He looked at Draco, at the surprisingly tender look on his face where earlier there’d been hunger. Draco’s cock was hard and dripping at the sight of Harry laying before him.
“I can help you, Draco”, Snape continued. “If you just tell me what it is you are – or at least you were – planning. I can help you get your bearings again.”
“Where on earth have you been? It’s past midnight!” Ron hissed as Harry climbed through the portrait hole, scaring Harry so badly he almost fell back out again.
was all Harry could think as he rushed forward and fell to his knees next to Draco’s body. Draco’s arms lay flat against his sides, but he was twitching and shaking uncontrollably.
His voice was harsh, and he kept his eyes on Malfoy, watching for any sudden movement.
!” she gasped. “That’s enough!”
Draco nodded.
Harry blushed. “I didn’t call you here for
Harry, still seething a little bit, rolled on top of Draco and pinned him underneath him. “You’re the twat.”
At that, Ron had had it. He burst through the door shouting
He’d tried his best to get in by asking the room to make the door reappear, using a variety of phrases. Yet the wall had remained stubbornly smooth.
“I’d rather not discuss that.” His tone didn’t leave room for objection.
“No, Potter!
“So there’s a Hogsmeade trip coming up next weekend”, Draco said tentatively.
was scribbled across it in hot, angry letters. Harry didn’t need further encouragement and excused himself as fast as he could and hurried off up the stairs.
“Are you”, Harry started. “Ehm, going to Slughorns party?” Confronting Draco after he’d just given Harry an orgasm that still had his knees shaking simply seemed too rude.
Hermione at least had the decency to feign surprise. “Well”, she said. “I couldn’t help but notice that you’ve been disappearing again, and I was wondering if I was wrong about you following Malfoy around…” She hesitated, looking up at Harry, who stared back, trying to look apprehensive despite his heart was beating rapidly. “And, I was thinking that maybe you were meeting someone.”
Harry didn’t have time to mull over this particular piece of information, or why Draco had been so reluctant to identify them. Just as the door slammed shut behind him, Dobby appeared with a loud bang.
Draco nodded. “This way I don’t have to spend my evenings sat on a toilet chatting with a weeping ghost, waiting around for you to show up.”
“Did you mean what you said last night?”
The patch of stone wall Draco was standing in front of opened up and Harry followed Draco through it. The common room looked even gloomier than Harry remembered it, now nearly deserted, except for a couple of first years sitting huddled in a corner. Draco didn’t give Harry time to look around; he stalked over to the other side of the room and continued up a flight of stairs with Harry at his heels. They entered through a thick wooden door into a dormitory, smaller than the ones in Gryffindor tower, with stone walls and floors. Three wooden beds draped in green stood against the far wall and a window to the lake cast a greenish light across the room. It smelled like The Forbidden Forrest after spring rain, like freshly dug up dirt, and musk. Harry recognized it from Draco’s hair and clothing. The walls were clad in large tapestries of famous Slytherins doing various heroics and Harry studied these as Draco cast every protective spell known to man around the room.
Adelaide frowned, as if she were realising something.
“Oh, it’s all right, only we’ve had to let Steven Hodges in, even though he’s a twat. But twat or no, he’s a good seeker. Not as good as you, of course,” she added, rather testily.
Within about fifteen minutes, it became apparent that he could walk out and have a little panic, or stay and have a big one. So he walked out.
“No, of course you don’t. You’re very easy to be around, did you know? It’s something Blaise wants to write a whole chapter about, in your biography.”
Draco laughed. It sounded fragile.
sexual.”
“That’s the good news,” said Healer Bussell. “We can’t do much about experiences he had while he was alone, but we should be able to graft your memories of him through advanced pensieve technology. It’s not perfect, but it should help him move on. And his memories may come back with time.”
Draco nodded.
“So it’s not
“Yes. I want to
“Oh, shit, sorry. Yeah. Uh, if your life is in danger you can do anything you need to save yourself.”
Draco had never missed a public session. He was regular as clockwork.
He splashed milk into the tea, but couldn’t bring it to Potter until he regained control of himself. He made a whole show of washing up a spoon to stir it with.
“Altitude changes the length of time you boil the eggs for,” said Draco.
Harry was glad that Draco had found happiness abroad. He really was, and one day, maybe not too long from now, Harry would be happy as well. It was a strange, anguished sort of feeling, because getting over Draco felt like losing him. But increasingly, Harry could see that romance aside, he had the people he needed in his life. There was something comforting about that, even if it wasn’t quite what he wanted.
“I’m doing okay,” said Harry. “How are you two?”
Half an hour later, Harry stood on the doorstep of Draco’s flat. He wasn’t sure what, exactly, he was doing. He felt as if his head had been spinning ever since he got Draco’s first letter.
“Someone drag Draco off the ice, I want to go home,” she said.
Draco stopped laughing, but he was still looking at Harry with a wondrous, joyful expression, like he couldn’t quite believe his luck.
“I know,” said Harry. He pushed down on a perky strand of hair, and it popped back up, in clear defiance of Newton’s discoveries.
Malfoy looked at him for a moment with a totally unreadable expression, then pushed back his chair so that more of his body was visible.
He shrugged himself free of Hermione, grinned at Harry, and went to the fireplace. Cassie went to stand beside him. At the last moment, when the green flames burst up, and they surely thought no one could see them, they fell towards each other in an embrace that was like magnets clicking together.
“I feel fine,” said Draco.
“We dated for half a year, right before I met you, that time in the market,” said Harry. He said it with an odd intensity that suggested to Draco it was important he listen, despite how mellow his body felt, and how enticingly sleep beckoned.
“It’s just me,” said Harry, taking off his cloak.
“Yes,” said Draco feverishly, “yes.”
“It wasn’t something I
Harry landed and turned back into himself. He grinned at the sight of them, and barrelled his way in between Ron and Draco.
“He’s the last person on earth who could ever forgive me,” said Draco. He leant his forehead against the kitchen cabinet. “This is hopeless.”
in,” said Draco. “Money breeds money. I don’t know what to make of it.” Then, suddenly hissing, vitriolic: “You should have fucking left me to burn.”
“It’s not.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, although he was pretty sure he had found it awful for different reasons. He had the strangest feeling that he had
Harry handed Seamus’ leash to Dean.
It came up again the day before they left for Hogwarts. They were sitting in the kitchen, eating a rhubarb cake that Malfoy had baked, talking about Hogwarts. Harry wondered if it would look different. He didn’t say “since the battle,” but Malfoy’s face still closed off.
Croome took Harry’s hand in his, raised it to his lips, and kissed it. Harry felt all the blood rush to his face as fury rose within him. Croome evidently mistook Harry’s sudden colour for virginal bashfulness.
“Is she gone?”
without being rude.
“This isn’t working,” he said.
“Oi, Malfoy,” he said. Draco looked up. He froze when he saw who it was who had addressed him. “You don’t look as good as last time I saw you, wearing a little school girl outfit and fucking yourself with a Gryffindor dildo.”
“Malfoy?”
“You would prefer I called him…”
“That’s loads!”
“If there’s even the smallest chance, Draco, you have to tell him. For me. For your mother.”
Malfoy sat on the sofa, his head resting on one hand, and the other wrapped up in a scarf and held close to his chest. When he saw Harry, he instantly groped for his wand, although he didn’t point it at him. He merely held it tightly in his fist.
“I’m not freaking out.”
“What the fuck are you doing here?”
“Yes, Harry? You love me too? Is that it?”
“Next time,” said Malfoy, faintly.
“I didn’t think it would benefit many people if I was on the Slytherin team,” he said, carefully. “Only me.”
, that Harry
Draco put the ring on.
Draco glared at him.
“Ginny’s been loads happier since you two became friends. You’d be welcome.”
“No,” said Draco, sinking into the couch and idly plucking at the stupid plastic plant on the side table. “No, obviously it doesn’t feel as if he likes me. It feels as if he despises me.”
“My parents found me,” said Draco, as if he was answering a question. “About six months after I ran.”
“No…” said Draco. He gripped his head. “No…fucking
“Smells delicious,” he said.
“Because then… his friend Lamorak will die. And he’s lost too many people, Pans.”
“I crossed it off because it was stupid,” said Draco. “Words are cheap. It’s much better to show that sort of thing. Merlin, can we change the subject?”
“He was so…
“You’d make a good blackbird,” said Draco, before he could stop himself.
” cried Harry.
“Sit up,” said Harry, casting a drying spell and refilling the glass. He put his hand on the back of Draco’s hot head and held the glass to his lips.
“Well,
“Do not speak of yourself. Only ask questions,” said his mother.
thought Harry. But then, in some ways it was a blessing that he had inherited his father’s good looks. Neither Malfoy nor Scorpius were exactly eyesores.
“Let’s go home,” he said.
look, and say, “How’re you holding up?”
Draco scowled.
Cassie snorted.
“Are you okay?”
“I feel as if you were made for me,” said Harry. “Everything about you. Even the fact that we hated each other for so long. I like that.”
“You can talk,” said Harry.
“I…don’t…feel…attractive,” he managed to say.
“But why did you come to
“I wasn’t trying to shame you,” said Harry. “I was extremely confused, but I wasn’t messing you around. I promise.”
“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry, and Draco smiled.
“I don’t have to— look—”
“Luna and Dean want to see you,” said Harry. Malfoy’s hand froze holding his bishop.
“You and I can’t talk, Harry.”
“That’s one of your imperfections that I can handle, yes,” said Draco.
you should have called me
“What are you in for?” asked Harry.
they gave Hermione a time-turner to do her lessons,” he said. “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“I wish I hadn’t said… any of it,” said Harry.
“No,” he said, clutching her soft, naked body close. “No. It helped.”
The article came out the very next day. They had posed for formal pictures before the interview, but the one they chose for the front page was a candid. Draco was speaking. He looked guilty, fragile and beautiful. Harry was holding both of Draco’s hands in his own, and was staring at Draco as if he was the only thing on earth that mattered. Their legs were tilted towards each other, and they looked as if they
“They were torturing her, right?” said Harry. Draco looked down again.
as if he had just been crying.
“So, to clarify, you think I ought never be forgiven? Is that right?”
“The thing is,” said Harry, in between breadsticks (the waiter kept bringing more whenever Harry finished them, and Harry seemed to feel that it would be rude not to finish them whenever the waiter brought them), “that you and I are so on the same page, with so many things, right?”
“Er, I don’t feel like that’s… for me to say?”
said Harry.
“It could be worse,” said Draco cheerfully. “There could be a sort of, magic snaky Nazi wizard forcing me to torture my father’s friends.”
Everyone was staring at him, which was, he supposed, what he should have expected. But it was hard.
Harry didn’t mind the work. Harry didn’t mind anything. Harry was just there for the ride, and he was having a grand old time.
“He’s dedicated,” said Draco. His gaze was too intense. Harry could feel it all over his body, even though Draco only looked at his face. “How have you been?”
“Hilarious. Erm, she, er… yeah. Says I should get over myself, basically.”
“I wasn’t,” she said.
“Yes, living out my boyhood dreams of stripping!” He raised his eyebrows. “Although I guess it’s true that my parents know I’m gay and haven’t disinherited me.”
“Shag, marry, hex,” said Harry, after ten minutes of quiet. “McGonagall, Sprout, and Hooch.”
“Oh, you finally organised it,” she said.
“Yeah. I will,” said Potter. His eyes fell on Draco’s hand again. “I will.”
When Harry had pulled her aside and told her to apologise to Draco, she had been outraged, obviously. Furious.
Draco curled up in a ball on the bed and moaned, no longer able to talk. He was distantly aware of Blaise leaving the room and returning with Pansy, of them talking together, of Pansy rubbing his back, but he couldn’t respond. He could only make low sounds that seemed sometimes to ease his suffering for a fraction of a second. The night stretched long.
“I don’t,” said Harry.
Pansy laughed more. She had started to cry again.
Malfoy cleared his throat uncomfortably.
“Hermione says no one said it to him, as a child. She reckons it fucked him up, a bit.”
“Timothy… I need to know the names of those gangs.”
Sam moaned.
“I don’t fancy him,” said Harry.
Andromeda and Mrs Weasley were sampling the cheese platter. Draco and Andromeda still avoided each other, although Harry knew it was because Andromeda felt guilty for having kept Teddy and Scorpius apart all those years. Draco, too, was overwhelmed by guilt about Teddy’s parents. Harry hoped they would get over it one day, but so far the best either of them could do was nod politely at each other before moving to opposite sides of the room.
“No, I know,” said Harry.
“I had to talk to him!”
“You look as if you’re going to be sick!”
“The cinoma.”
Harry had been almost black-out drunk, but hangover potions prevented memory lost. He remembered everything. The curling dread that had stirred in him the night before seemed to have stretched and grown while he slept, and now he understood.
Once, Draco thought he saw a bruise on Adelaide’s wrist, but she pulled down her sleeve and climbed into Tertius’ lap and it had probably just been the lighting.
“Are you with the Department of Mysteries?” Bianca asked Ron, sceptically.
was shagging; you’re upsettingly good at sex. Really.”
Malfoy beamed, stroking Scorpius’ soft blond hair.
“Accio broom!”
“Salazar Slytherin!” cried Timothy. “You gave me a scare! I didn’t see you come in!”
“Yeah. And there was one stone that took me ages to decipher, because it was all in Middle English, but not, like, Chaucerian Middle English—”
“Come off it.”
An owl tapped at the window. Draco looked up hopefully.
“Can you do a Sunday roast, Dipsy my love?” asked Blaise. “I know it’s not Sunday, but I could murder a roast. For all of us. Thank you, you are an angel.”
“Accio lube,” he said.
Harry shook his head.
“I’ve packed you a potions case,” said Astoria. “Pepper-Up, more cough-suppressant, head-ache potion, a general pain-killer…”
“We’ve checked all the places on our list,” said Luna. Dean wasn’t talking much.
“An umpire? For chess?”
“Of course,” said Draco, still covering his mouth. “Well. You should, uh, tidy this cupboard.”
Astoria gave him a brave smile. Harry could hear people murmuring in the crowd, words like “out of order” and “he’s a victim of the war, too!”
Draco had to be. Harry was out flying with Ginny. They had invited him, but he had declined, implying that he was too traumatised from the last time he had been on a broom, escaping the Fiendfyre, to get back on one now. In reality, he was too injured to fly. He didn’t trust his muscles anymore. They gave way unpredictably. It made him feel ancient.
Harry could feel Draco grow serious.
“I’ll go, in a bit,” he said.
This, realised Draco, was what he had wanted, all this time. A garden full of blowing flowers. Harry, on one knee, looking at him with all the forceful intensity of his nature. Telling him he loved him in permanent, endless ways.
“I won’t.”
“Oh! That’s… unexpected,” she said. “Of course you can write to me. I love getting post.”
Potter shut the portrait. The silence was instant and echoing.
“No. It’s a luxury,” explained Scorpius. “I don’t need luxuries to be happy.”
“Don’t,” said Harry again. “It was awful. It was so fucked up. It felt like punching Hermione.”
“I quite like it.”
“We’ve got a few minutes left,” he said, when Harry put down the phone. “You want to go again?”
“It is. Will you play? It’ll be fun.”
Draco started to laugh, then began coughing, a horrible, wheezing cough that sounded as if it hurt.
“What does that mean?” asked Astoria politely, as if Draco had just used an unfamiliar word.
Through the thin walls came Goyle’s voice.
“What?”
Draco started pacing back and forth along the corridor. His thoughts were too scrambled for him to even try to put them through the filters. Because! Because sometimes apologising was the most selfish thing you could do! Because asking someone to forgive you when they shouldn’t have to was manipulative! Because Dean Thomas shouldn’t have to look at him three times a day just because Harry wanted to fuck Draco and had used his social cachet to pull him out of Azkaban!
“Persuasive,” said Draco, “but not enough.”
Ron arrived a minute later. Draco stiffened— Ron seemed to find it difficult to believe that everyone didn’t want to sleep with Hermione as much as he did— but to his great surprise, Ron simply joined in the embrace, until all three of them were hugging.
“I wasn’t sure where to take her,” he said. “People are… inhospitable, on the public pitch.”
Although, perhaps that was what he
Draco smirked.
“He knows I don’t feel the same way. He doesn’t care. You can ask him. He’s absolutely gagging for it.”
The train platform was crowded and normal. Exactly a year ago, his mother had put him on this train.
“Fine, is it,” said Potter.
“What do you think of Draco’s stage name?” asked Harry, eventually. Lucius’ mouth drew into a long, thin line.
“Then you just take one egg out sooner.”
“I…” Draco turned to look at Harry. “If you want.”
“Don’t deny it. I was watching you two all afternoon. Every time I left the room you went for each other. You’re like, head over heels in love with him.”
“No,” said Draco grimly.
Go to quidditch matches with Draco, apparently. Draco became rather aggressive about pursuing their friendship.
Scorpius nodded unhappily. Harry knew they were both thinking that if Draco wasn’t better by then, it would be because he was dead.
That hadn’t been what Harry was thinking, in fact. He had been thinking that Malfoy had never been in love with Astoria, which gave him a peculiar feeling behind the ribs.
“Shit,” muttered Harry, and stepped back into the fireplace.
But she greeted him in the waiting room with a nervous smile. She had dressed up, as if he were someone important. It was unbelievable how touching Draco found that.
“In view of the
“Okay. I’ll take you home, then.” Harry started to get the portkey out of his pocket, but then he paused. “Would you like me to kiss you?”
“So?” pressed Ginny.
“Um,” said Harry. “The opposite from you.”
“I have to go.”
“Just go,” said Harry. So Neville went.
“I bought you a television,” she said, the first day Harry came in and found her watching
When has Draco made a good decision
Draco’s eyes went blank.
He raced across the castle, preparing himself to face Draco’s wrath, but it didn’t come. Draco stood quietly by the Arithmancy classroom, a grim look on his pale face. He brightened when he saw Harry.
Relieved from thinking about the recipient of his letters as a real person who might judge him, Harry wrote several more, about how uncomfortable he felt in his new role, although he was sure he would get used to it soon. He wrote about work, mainly, although occasionally he also wrote about how it felt as if something was missing, and he didn’t know what it was.
“Let’s just go,” he muttered.
“Tonks,” said Harry.
“I feel sick, looking at you,” said Harry. It was true. His stomach roiled as the lifting of the spell allowed all his memories to filter back, complete in retrospect where they hadn’t been in the present. He remembered where Malfoy’s outstretched hands had been on his body. He remembered Malfoy’s face when he came, and the strange, melancholic look he got afterwards.
“No,” said Draco. “No, if you hurt Ron too badly—if Hermione thought you were doing something evil—no. Blaise would help me
“That’s a travesty,” said Draco faintly.
“There’s no one I’d rather have a child with than you,” he said.
Harry-in-the-memory and Harry-watching both seemed to understand at the same moment. Memory Harry got a soft look on his face, and passed Draco a bottle of water. He watched as Draco gulped it down.
He had known what it would contain, somehow.
“God,” said Draco.
“Hey,” he said.
“She knew plenty when she got me to sign my Unspeakable contract without reading the fine print,” spat Draco.
“I like my office,” said Kevin, mildly.
“It won’t be,” he said, and slipped out of the room.
Draco swallowed his pride and thought of the greater good.
“Yes, and who do you think had to pick up the pieces? You could turn out to be the world’s best father, but I’m never going to forget how you treated him.”
“I’ll miss you,” said Teddy.
“I have to tell you something,” said Lamorak.
visiting Draco. He looked forward to it.
“It’s not a competition, Draco.”
Harry was prodded out of a deep slumber. Draco was poking him with long, bony fingers, whispering “Potter. Potter!”
Adelaide’s voice was almost a whisper.
“So much crazy stuff has happened to me,” said Harry. “It’s easier if I don’t mention any of it.”
“I’m so sorry that I freaked out after we slept together. If you don’t want to be with me, or if we try this and it doesn’t work out, I promise if won’t change me helping you and Scorpius. But I love you,” here, he shook Draco’s head a little, as if to emphasise his point, “and I want to
“No problem,” said Draco.
“Do you want to do anything today?” asked Draco.
“God. Draco.”
“Well, you know me. Draco Malfoy the Brave.”
Draco leant back in his chair.
“That’s what Draco used to do,” said Dean. “On a comedown. Deflect. He could never talk, once he was sober.”
“Hi, Draco,” he said. “Harry.”
“Were there dementors?”
“Sounded like Malfoy. Figured it’d be easier.”
“Draco… I’m not being nice to you because I feel
“Addy…!” he said, his voice light and careless, or almost. “Are you giving me a pep talk?”
Malfoy laughed, and if Harry hadn’t spent six years watching him, he wouldn’t have noticed that there was anything off about it.
“Neville and I broke up, fucking
“Leeds it is,” he said.
“Haaa,” said Draco, shivering slightly.
“Right, but what the fuck,” said Harry. “Also, he’s not scared of you and Hermione, and you both did way more than I did in the war, really.”
“That’s too runny,” said Draco now, guiding Harry’s wand.
“Good grief, K! Doesn’t this stress you out every morning?” L had asked, shortly after he all but moved into Harry’ dorm.
“I could hear you were awake,” said Timothy. “Thought you might want some company.”
Harry laughed at the appalled expression on Draco’s face. This was the most he’d spoken outside of their rooms in days, and Harry liked it.
Eve snorted.
“Harry’s never treated him like a prisoner,” protested Ginny.
“Speaking of which,” said Timothy, “I think that’s Teresa over there.”
you told yourself you were becoming a better person. I just admire you for making the change.”
“Have you studied
Pansy sneered at him.
“I feel like you’ve been hungry for a decade,” said Harry quietly.
been a twat? But to his surprise, words came to him. “Of course your dad should have stood up to his father earlier. Or at all. But he had a lot of opportunities to do evil— real evil, Scorpius—and he couldn’t do it. It wasn’t in him. Because fundamentally, he wasn’t a bad person.”
Harry distantly remembered reading somewhere that Goyle had married Susan Bones and ran an apple orchard on the Isle of Wight.
Today, however, he was clearly plastered, and Draco knew why. Tomorrow was the last of the trials: Fenrir Greyback’s.
. But for the last month, Draco’s nose had been too blocked up for him to be able to taste anything, and more recently, he had stopped being able to keep food down. His appetite was shot, and he felt nauseous when he even thought of eating. So Pansy ate ice cream, and Draco went through his Bucket List, crossing off all the food-based ones with a heavy heart.
“Oh, fuck off, you absolute cun—”
After that, things became calmer. The kitten seemed out of sorts; not at all playful. He was more needy than usual, and when Harry shut the door to have a shower, the kitten sat outside bathroom door meowing in tones of heightened misery the entire time.
“I feel disgusting,” he said. He sounded regretful.
“We’re going to the ministry to get the bond removed,” said Harry. “I think that’s the only way to fix this.”
“I’m still angry with you,” he said.
Draco continued in a monotone, describing Steven’s plan to torture him into insanity, the myriad rules he had inflicted on Draco, the way he had been obliged to pretend he was in love with him.
Cassie rolled her eyes when Harry passed on the message.
“Well I don’t fucking remember that, do I!”
“Will you feel patronised if I give you money?” he asked.
“Mate, no way, it’s
“Of course you do. You always find a way to live with your boss, don’t you? First Voldemort, now—”
“Unlike you,” said Harry, and then regretted his nastiness, because her shoulders hunched, and her head drooped, and she said, so quietly it was hard to hear,
Malfoy laughed. It sounded a bit like a sob.
. It was like hanging out with someone out of a history text book. Potter would probably hate that. Potter probably wanted to be thought of as a
“I miss Vince,” sobbed Greg. “I miss him!”
“Molly wants to have a funeral,” said Hermione.
“Hi, Harry, how are you?” she asked. She sounded exhausted.
“Don’t
, isn’t it, so. Fine. I won’t bother you again.”
“Blaise! I
After they’d both come, Potter lay spread-eagled on the hearthrug, panting.
“So, er, this can be your room,” said Harry. Malfoy inclined his head, but didn’t say anything. He had scarcely said a word since arriving at Grimmauld Place. “From what Hermione said, you probably shouldn’t go out too much unless someone is with you. But Hermione said you were actually looking for a new place to live anyway, since Neville… er, sorry about that, by the way.”
“Not if you want me to stop.”
It was typical of Malfoy to know exactly what words would fly quickest to Harry’s heart with wounding accuracy.
“Because! Look at it! It looks like a liver!”
Ron and Hermione fell silent.
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry. Draco must have been all right, because his hand was glamoured, and his hair neatly styled, and he looked absolutely untouchable. “Yeah, I thought it would be, just, easier.”
“You’re an Unspeakable! I couldn’t believe it, when I saw— so you knew I was going out with Malfoy?”
mouthed Draco, and Harry suddenly knew that his doubt didn’t matter. He wasn’t completely sure that Draco was innocent, but he
Harry felt distinctly useless as he tried to figure out Malfoy’s curse. Malfoy sat opposite him at the kitchen table, looking bored. Harry held his hand, casting diagnostic curses with two fingers pressed against Malfoy’s pulse.
Adelaide just rolled her eyes and looked pleased.
That bruised-looking mark on Draco’s arm. The scars on his chest. Sectumsempra, Always Cut.
,” said Draco.
“Come on,” he said to Malfoy, grabbing his wrist. Malfoy obeyed him instantly, seeming to take it for granted that Harry was going to save him, just as he had in the Room of Requirement. Goyle and Narcissa followed him in a chain.
“Are you crying?” asked Harry.
Harry needs a werewolf potion. Draco happens to be very good at werewolf potions. Adelaide is a mess.
“Are you remembering all this?”
“I know I was a shit to him in eighth year,” said Harry.
Bianca threw up her hands in exasperation.
“That’s… horrible,” said Harry.
But several in-jokes between Harry, Ron and Hermione suddenly made sense. He felt as if Harry were opening a door into a secret room.
“Of course, I’m very lucky.”
. You must think…I don’t know what you think.”
“Death Eater Catchers?”
“We can’t be together,” said Harry.
Ron stared after them as they walked inside.
Malfoy nodded.
“The Ministry of Magic!” said Harry. He squeezed Draco’s hand. Draco did not squeeze back. There was a flash of green light, and when they stepped forward, they were at the Ministry.
“I really don’t want you to fuck me because you feel like you have to.”
But after Adelaide left, (girlfriend voice, “
“Yes,” he said.
“I’m really proud of you.”
Narcissa shook her head.
“Did you know that muggles have a game called football that they think is quite as important as quidditch?” asked Draco.
Draco opened the door when Harry rang the bell. He looked different and the same from how he’d looked in school. Better-dressed, certainly, and quietly better-looking, although Harry couldn’t tell if it was really that he was handsomer, or if it was that he looked much, much happier. His posture was relaxed, and his face seemed set in easy lines, as if he expected to like everyone he met.
“Is your head hurting you? You look a bit upset.”
“She’ll be getting her Hogwarts letter this summer,” he said. Cassie had turned eleven shortly after moving to Grimmauld Place. Harry had baked her a cake and hyperventilated in the bathroom after singing her happy birthday, because of all the birthdays he’d missed.
“But… Draco…these are all travel,” said Harry.
“Oh,” said Draco, “well in that case, fuck you, I hope you die under a bridge.”
“Er,” said Draco, when he could breathe again. “I was under the impression this was a secret shag on the side deal.”
“They already know,” said Harry.
“So I’ll give you an expensive gift. D’you see what I mean?”
“He’s not my secret gay lover,” said Blaise.
“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “It’s complicated. But I love Ron, so I forgave him completely. Things don’t always have to be…
“That would be some pretty dodgy consent, Potter. How do you think you’d feel if you found out you’d slept with a Death Eater?”
Draco took the cigarette from him and flushed it down the loo, then climbed back into the window sill next to Harry. It was a perfect spring night, a small breeze nipping at them through their jumpers.
In truth, Harry didn’t go out very much anymore; at least, not without his invisibility cloak. People began approaching him the moment he and Scorpius arrived in Diagon Alley. Scorpius clung nervously to his hand and shrank back when people noticed him.
“You won’t though, will you?” she said. “You won’t contact the school or anything?”
“He’s dating Astoria Greengrass,” he said. “I don’t even know if he likes guys.”
“Do you like it?” asked Harry anxiously.
Draco laughed softly.
“I still remember the Fairfax Twirl you did in the match against Ravenclaw in third year. That was bloody amazing.”
Pansy was quiet for a long time.
“Come on, Draco, you know I think you’re pretty great.”
“Everyone knows that he’s on probation.”
“Bed… more… comfortable,” said Harry, through kisses. “Let’s go again.”
“He falls in love with the man he bit.”
Once he had told the ear story, he told Draco about the girl who baked him cookies.
“Draco… about last night…”
“I’m not asking you to be my boyfriend,” clarified Harry. Draco looked shocked.
“You’re drunk.”
The sex itself was quite fun—they both kept laughing. But after it was over, Seamus rolled onto his back and was quiet for a long time, his arm over his eyes.
he said, often.
“All right, Harry, I’ll stay behind to debrief you,” she said.
you’re pathetic. You’re not actually,” she said.
“Did it say you had to go undercover?”
There was one advantage to Draco’s absence: Harry got to spend time alone with Cassie. Enough time that when Cassie was being a total brat one afternoon, refusing to eat her lunch and stamping her foot, Harry scolded her without worrying that he was fundamentally damaging their relationship.
Then it came back to him.
“Draco,” interrupted Harry. “You’re telling the story wrong.”
“Harry,” said Bianca, “you need to calm down.”
“Resentment never made anyone happy,” said Harry. “You make me happy.”
“Good.”
“All right. What are you stealing?”
“I know,” said Harry. “I thought, maybe, we could start.”
,” he said forcefully.
“It would be hard,” he said. “Because I wouldn’t be able to hide that, and he would know, and it would hurt him, and then when I calmed down I’d feel terrible but also… I don’t know, I mean, he poisoned me, right?”
“You’re brilliant, you know that?” she said. Draco smiled into the hug, then moved away.
Draco rolled up his sleeve and held out his left forearm.
“No,” he said. “Do you?”
“You’ve gone mad,” said Ron. “You just had a mental breakdown about
“Draco!” said Harry, relief coursing through him. Draco hadn’t been on the map, so Harry had gone looking for the room of requirement. Even with his newfound tranquility, it had unnerved Harry to put his hand on the wall which used to reveal the room, and feel that it was
“No one is, Draco.”
“That’s good,” he said. “I’ll see you at Christmas, Harry. Can I invite Anthea and Titus?”
“I like the picture they’ve used,” said Cassie. It was of Harry and Draco kissing at their wedding. Harry noted with some discomfort that, in the picture, at least, he seemed markedly more enthusiastic about the kiss than Draco did.
. Hermione had pointedly given it to him for his birthday.
“It’s important to know when to trust people,” Malfoy told Scorpius.
“Your house elf told me you where you were” said Harry, as if this was a sufficient answer.
he had reiterated that it was just a shag.
“But it was all right, wasn’t it?”
“Ah, no, it’s—my right hand’s a bit fucked,” said Draco, so Potter moved back.
What had possessed him to come to Draco like this, in the middle of the night, as if he had a right to? As if he could expect Draco to wake up and take care of him? What was he thinking?
“No, fuck, no, Potter…!” Draco chased after him. He tried to grab the broom from Harry’s hands. It was such a fun game. Harry was too quick for him. He skipped around the courtyard, holding the broom just out of Draco’s reach.
“I know,” said Harry, mystified.
“What happened?” asked Draco, sounding very much awake.
The coffin was empty as they lowered it into the ground. Harry’s body was still missing. Draco remembered the way Harry had grinned at him above his champagne glass, and felt, bizarrely, as if he was reading a very sad book, rather than living his own very sad life.
It was sweet. It felt nice, even though it didn’t mean much, because Will had no conception of what Harry needed, of how little he had ever been cared for, and how much he seemed to need to make up for that initial lack.
“You’re not Dinsmore,” he said.
“I haven’t had much time. Not since about eighth year. I started a novel when I was pregnant, but then I got too sick.”
Blood soaked through his clothes, and Draco stared at the ceiling, quite alone.
“This is a tough situation, for everyone,” said Harry. “But we’re going to figure it out, okay?”
“You think—you think I wanted any of this?
“Draco. Look at me.”
“Oh,” said the guy, looking confused.
“Go on, then,” said Lamorak.
“Draco, I’m sorry,” said Ginny. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“The editor wants me to cut out the
“Meaning?”
“Sorry,” he said, turning away, as if he were ashamed of himself. “Sorry. I just keep thinking of Misty.”
“Sober?”
“Draco, don’t be ridiculous,” said Andromeda. “Come out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The ground moved quickly beneath them. The clouds glowed gold against the sinking sun. When Draco was tired, he dove into the woods—falling, briefly; pulled down to earth by the comforting imperative of gravity—and perched on a wet tree branch. Water fell in slickening drops through the leaves when the wind blew, but he was warm beneath his feathers.
“Malfoy,” he said, sitting on the floor by the bed. “Come on. You can come out.”
“Are you surprised?” asked Hermione, kissing his cheek.
“You’re a bit more, I don’t know, awake. You should see him more.”
“Hmm, he might be, if you weren’t incurably homosexual.”
Harry.”
The same article that had quoted Harry’s earnest speech in defence of Draco had also featured a surly picture of Draco in his potions shop. Draco had, apparently, refused comment.
“Wine?” he offered again.
in love with
“How long have you been doing this?” asked Harry.
“You should have it,” said Draco. “You should buy me out. I’m going to sell it, if you don’t. I can’t live here anymore.”
Misty froze.
“It’s unusual for you to be romantically interested in someone,” said Kevin. Draco made an aggravated sound.
Michael and Draco apparated back to Draco’s flat almost four hours later. Michael drew Draco into a quick, tight hug, waved uncomfortably at Harry, and left.
“It’s a good job,” said Harry.
“There’s a girl taking a picture of you in the Magical Zoology section,” he whispered.
“I like the music,” said Harry.
Harry intercepted Draco as he paced across the room. Took his arms and stilled him.
She broke away soon, but it didn’t matter. Harry beamed the whole afternoon.
“Your mum…”
my friends aren’t all
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy’s face went completely blank for a moment, then he smiled with half his mouth.
“Did you really need to punish me?” asked Draco. His eyes met Harry’s, naked and sincere.
“—To come back when you were done. He didn’t specify further.”
“You can’t. People would see; it’d end up in the papers,” said Draco.
“It’s not for me,” said Draco. “It’s for you guys. But I suppose that doesn’t make it any less impressive.”
Harry stopped him with a kiss. To his surprise, Draco immediately stopped winding himself up into a panic and became meek as lamb.
. Remembered all the tiny cruelties, and all the big ones, too.
But he didn’t speak anymore of Harry loathing bits of him, and although he still woke up in the night, it was less often.
“For last time. Telling you not to be a brat.”
“Hmm,” said Blaise, still watching him. Then he leant back and took a deep sip of gin and tonic. “Draco’s such a forthcoming drunk.”
“I’m not going to…to ask you about it…but do you mind if…? Forget it.”
“Look,” said Harry, “can someone explain to me why you’re all here?”
“Because he was a Death Eater?” asked Harry. Michael shook his head.
“It’s fine,” he said. “I knew what he thought of me.”
Harry sat up in bed, clawing at his temple. The emotions seeped thickly away. The fierce desire to protect, to help, the frustration, the fondness, the love. So much love. More than Harry had ever felt, for anyone.
“No, I’m also very sexy. Speaking of which, same time tomorrow for our private session?”
Harry couldn’t help himself. He laughed. The look Draco flashed him held all the vitriol of Malfoy-stomping-on-his-face-in-a-train-carriage.
“Yes.”
“Is it okay?” asked Harry.
“Yeah,” said Ron. “Might liven up my day a bit.”
“You’re lying.”
Scorpius chattered away as he led Harry up the stairs to the flat.
“You may always come to me with any problems.”
“You’re a bad influence on him,” said Harry.
“Some scientists believe that the only surefire way to increase mental well-being is to invest time in personal relationships,” said Kevin.
Blaise looked rather abashed.
“Why do you say it’s bad advice?”
“What?” asked Ron. “What are you talking about?”
Harry sat up as quickly as if Draco had punched him.
Draco went very still. He was wearing the shirt Harry loved so much, the one that made his eyes tilt over from grey to blue. He fiddled with the cuff, looking as if he were trying to decide to tell Harry something.
“Er, terapthrists?” asked Harry.
“I think you’ve got a chance!”
“He’s a muggle poet. Dark, brooding, troubled.”
“Cool, yeah, thanks,” said Harry, whose mind had gone rather flat. “Okay, so… do you still love Michael?”
it like?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
“I’ll refund you for today.”
Pansy’s eyes were wide. She gulped.
Draco opened one eye.
Draco was fiddling about with tea bags.
for help.
—so many ways in which he was, just as the list said, a fucking awful person.
“Do you want space?” he managed to ask.
But as she wept into his arms, it became apparent that she wasn’t crying because Draco wanted to kill himself. (He countered a childish instinct to be offended by this.) She was crying because the other elves were making her sleep in freezing dairy cupboard.
Each time Harry said that, something deep in Draco’s chest seemed to loosen. He was scared of that loosening, scared of how he would hold himself together when all the knots that tangled him were gone.
He was still red-eyed and shaky when Potter opened the compartment door. (Of course he was. It was Potter, so Draco had to be doing something humiliating. Those, thought Draco dourly, were the cosmic rules of the universe.)
“Hey,” said Harry, with a sleepy smile.
Harry’s vision was blurry. He blinked, and the tears retreated.
“Not everything is a sex thing!” said Harry, although he was forced to undermine this statement immediately. “But yes, it is a sex thing. It’s… ugh. If you mention this to Blaise I will kill you. Hermione bought me a book on impact play last week, because Blaise told her I wanted to explore flogging.”
Draco sat up when Harry entered his cell.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “That was an awful thing to say. I didn’t mean it. You’re much cleverer than I am, you know that.”
“It sounds to me as if you’ve already got the suspect. That farmer was sketchy as fuck.”
“Harry!” said Flora. “Scorpius is a bit upset— I don’t think a movie’s in the cards, tonight.”
They seemed to get on so well. Draco laughed a lot when they spoke, and it seemed genuine, but maybe he laughed like that with everyone. Draco often came in their private sessions, but then who knew if he was using some kind of spell for that.
“Spend time with family.”
“Yep,” said Harry. “He’s just not a prat anymore.”
Malfoy made a non-committal gesture.
Of course he did.
“Shut up,” said Potter, moving his leg sharply away from Draco’s. Draco felt his heart constrict. Did Potter still really think he was plotting some kind of evil?
“It was lovely to meet you,” said Draco. Klaus nodded.
“I love you too,” said Draco, and Harry broke out into a wide grin. Draco had never actually said it before, not in so many words, although he had shown it in a million little ways, from the moment he and Cassie had appeared in Harry’s life.
“Why don’t you just visit him?” asked Hermione. “He can’t possibly curse you. He knows he owes you his life at least three times over.”
“What?” asked Ron.
Harry tried to talk to Draco about quidditch, but Draco didn’t seem to know he was there. Pansy tried lowering the dose. Draco’s eyes went from vacant to agonised with no period of lucidity. He howled for his mother, not seeming to understand that Narcissa was next to him, holding his hand, her silent, icy tears coursing down her pale cheeks.
“I don’t want you to have to live your life in exile, Scorpius! I want you to be able to be who you really are!”
“Everyone worth knowing. There, does that set your mind at ease?”
“Sorry, was I not supposed to know?”
Harry knelt beside him.
“Yes,” said Malfoy, with this awful new face. “I’ll be good. Tell me what to do, and I’ll be so good.”
“No, no, Malfoy, that… I overheard you and Pansy… she said that you should date me to improve your social standing…I was
always been overly interested in the lives of school children, as I’m sure you recall.”
“But you don’t want to.”
“There’s no ‘of course’ about it, you idiot,” said Malfoy, but there was no bite to it.
Hermione sighed.
The next day, Harry gave him a grey leather notebook with creamy lined paper. Inside, he left a one-word inscription: “
at Harry, when he had spent weeks avoiding his eye? But to question it would be to risk losing it, so Harry lent Draco some clothes to sleep in without comment. They brushed their teeth together at the sink, and got into bed.

“No,” said Harry. “I’m taking you to your Aunt Pansy’s, and you’re staying there. Do you understand?”
The healer looked vaguely affronted.
. But then, aren’t they always?”
“Go on a date with him. I think you two would be good together.”
“I’ll come look at them tonight,” he said. “You’ve got a real eye, Misty.”
“Does he talk about war much?”
“She’s cleverer than us, isn’t she?” Draco asked Pansy.
Draco twisted his mouth.
“I’ll be back. I have some questions about Malfoy’s case,” said Harry.
Harry knew Draco had a horror of being left alone; particularly in the dark.
“No, Potter, it’s not fucking okay, because I was a fucking blood supremacist who tried to murder people! Look at this—” he pulled up his left sleeve, waving the Dark Mark in Harry’s face, “Look at it! I chose this! And it’s here, on my arm,
with San Marino?”
“I can’t sit at the same table as him,” said Draco.
“No?”
“Right. I probably deserve that,” he said.
He was hungover the day he fell off his broom and injured his shoulder. Harry had had a lot of injuries, so he knew instantly that this was a bad one.
Draco’s jaw twitched, but he didn’t answer. Harry stretched out his pinkie finger so that it touched Draco’s. He counted it a win when Draco didn’t move his hand away.
His voice was soft and wistful.
“And then you came to see me in the holding cell—”
"Yes," said Harry. He grinned and pulled Draco to his feet and tried to kiss him all at once. Draco staggered against him.
Draco’s face cracked open in a dazzling smile.
———————
Harry didn’t know how to answer that.
“Contra mundum,” Scorpius told him fiercely, the last time he and Draco fought, because the awful little Ravenclaw was continually speaking in Latin.
“About
Sam crumpled to the ground. So did Draco, smudging blood all down the wall. Harry rushed towards him, but Adelaide got there first.
Harry nodded, even though he knew Malfoy couldn’t see him.
“Pink, is it?”
Harry lay dead in the Forbidden Forest. Draco’s mother bent over him.
drunk,” said Draco.
“Yeah, it always feels that way, dunnit?”
was sleeping with, however, Seamus grew secretive and changed the subject. Harry thought it was probably Dean, which he found depressing enough to stop asking Seamus about it.
Draco laughed and kissed him again.
“Yes. All right,” he said, and his voice lost most of its theatricality, becoming clipped and business-like. “We all know you’re not keen on Draco—”
There were so many parts of the story that made Draco want to jump. Harry carefully didn’t mention
“Don’t complain.”
Draco had already finished eating. He cleared away his plate.
Harry was pretty certain, by this point, that Draco liked him. He wasn’t sure how it had happened, given that Draco was a) gorgeous and b) sought after by the entire school as the bad boy darling of the war and c) posh as hell and d) permanently scarred by Harry’s stupidity and e) bound to associate Harry forever more with the worst experiences of his life. But somehow, Draco seemed to have developed a crush on—maybe even
“No,” said Harry. “You tell him, or I will. He needs to know that no one was trying to hurt him. Jesus. Slytherins are fucked in the head.”
“For… for how long?”
“I won’t.” He pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead. “I’ll be back soon. We’re going to fix this. I promise.” He stood to leave, caught sight of Draco, and had to swoop back down to kiss his forehead again. He was filled with an affection so fierce it made him want to pick Draco up and
“Has he been drinking lately?” asked Hermione, at lunchtime on the first day Harry had not come home.
“Is the curse broken?” asked Pansy. “Will he live?”
“They’re both a bit fucked up, to be honest,” said Ron. “I’m not sure either of them would do better elsewhere.”
“Everyone wants to be understood, Draco. When you ask someone what they mean, particularly after they’ve already been talking at length, they feel as if they matter. People love to matter. They love those who make them feel that way.”
“That’s all, thanks,” said Harry shortly. The waitress left.
“I put a sleeping draught in her wine,” said Cassie. Harry covered his eyes with his hand.
said the front cover, splashed over a black and white picture of Harry looking much as he did now: topless and sex-tousled, except that Harry in the picture was completely relaxed in his pillows. Not a photoshoot: a candid, an intimate one, and although it didn’t show anything, it was a violation.
“Well, clearly you’re bad at pep-talks, yeah,” said Malfoy.
Ron had been to one movie night. It had not gone well. Malfoy had had to obliviate his friends three times, and told Ron he couldn’t come again.
“November 27th, why?”
“Right. You’re over the hill,” said Harry.
“What?”

“I’d forgotten how shit it is to be single.”

“Fuck off.”
“Just Legimens me, Potter, I don’t want to explain.”
I didn’t think it would go over well to show up to your house, unannounced, with a rock-hard cock. Didn’t seem appropriate for
“Oh, Misty, I’m only joking. That’s the only advantage to all this, see? That you have to feel sorry for me.”
He remembered Potter saying “You kissed me”. He remembered telling all the the eighth years that he wanted to kill himself. Although he clearly didn’t have any follow-through, which was bloody typical, wasn’t it? When had Draco ever been able to conquer his cowardice and do the right thing?
“They won’t?”
hung heavily in the air.
“Yes,” said Draco, one hand going to Harry’s waist, without Draco seeming to notice it. “Yes.”
Harry ran a finger up and down Draco’s knobbly spine. Draco was so fragile, as if his bones had grown frail since the curse.
“Yeah, because she was being
“I’m—I’m getting you a glass of water, okay? And maybe some food,” he said. He looked anxious.
Seven laughed.
“How’s it going?” asked Harry.
you to!”
“What,” asked Harry, trying to sound absolutely not filled-with-dread. Seamus had a tendency to wildly misunderstand Harry on purpose. Last time Harry had been a bit spacey—last week—he was always spacey, maybe—Seamus had forced Harry to watch a nine-minute video of a naked woman farting into a cake. “I saw it and thought of you,” Seamus had said, which Harry found
“Poor Draco,” said Flora. “He must think we won’t like him anymore.”
“It’s not catchy,” said Pansy, throwing the paper down on Ginny’s coffee table. “What about…
Harry wasn’t sure what was so unforgivable about him, when Malfoy had evidently got over all his school animosity towards Ron and Hermione. It made Harry feel small and crazy and unlovable. But that was nothing new, so he sucked it up, and didn’t say anything more about it.
one of those.”
“I never gave you back your wand,” said Harry.
“But that was only one raid—in one of the safe houses—I have no idea how they would have warning about the other raids, Harry, I didn’t tell him anything like that, I swear—”
“What about it?”
tell you that?”
Draco thought about pretending he didn’t understand what he meant, but it was useless. He nodded.
The rehab facility was very clean and very new. The teenagers smoking in the courtyard looked Adelaide up and down with mild curiosity. Her face closed. Draco wished, sometimes, that she hadn’t become beautiful until she was grown.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry. Draco waved him off.
“What the fuck,” said Harry, ripping open the plastic to reveal Anna’s dead, staring face. She was sixteen. “Malfoy! What the fuck!”
“I wasn’t ready,” said Draco.
Harry laughed.
“You’re recording it, right?” said Seamus.
“You’ve never told me you love me!” said Pansy. She paused to consider him. “This is quite embarrassing for you, isn’t it? I mean, you must
“Get out of this manky broom cupboard, you terminal wanker,” said Pansy, and he loved her so much that he nearly panicked again. But there wasn’t time to panic—only six months—so instead he opened the cupboard door, called her a stupid bint, and took her out to get plastered.
“I’m sure you’re not as bad at hosting as you think.”
“You apparated us. Is this Scotland?”
“Do you believe me?”
It hurt to sit. He had Potter to thank for that.
“Of course! My sweet boy, of course. But you were not trained to make people love you. And you will need that, now.”
, Harry,” said Hermione. “…did you think it did?”
“I love you so much.”
Neville looked back at the table.
“Everything hurts. I’m incredibly brave. I thought we had covered this already. Make sure that’s in my eulogy, Pansy:
“We weren’t communicating well for a while, and that was my fault as well as his,” said Draco. “But we’ve been working on it, and…”
“No,” said Draco flatly.
“I’m not. I hated you, but I also couldn’t stop thinking about you. Drove Ron and Hermione spare.”
Draco shook his head with a smile.
Draco shrugged, settling himself onto the bed.
again.
“That’s not…”
He was going to kiss him. Draco was going to let him. He could feel it. Draco’s eyes were half shut already, and he was still so shaky and upset, and Harry just wanted to kiss him until Draco knew how sorry he was. Because he should have known, really, that Draco wasn’t the same anymore— he should have known at Draco’s trial, when Harry had balked at touching his Mark, and Draco had reacted with understanding. Had asked him if he was all right, even though Draco was the one who had just lost both parents.
“I told you not to touch anything,” he said, rustling in his desk drawer for burn salve.
Draco took in an inhale, then coughed his lungs out.
Harry put his cutlery down and looked Ron seriously in the eye.
“That’s what makes it funny,” said Draco.
,” said Draco.
“I’ll ask Seamus and Dean and Neville to keep it to themselves, but Seamus is a gossip, and you know how Neville gets if he’s been drinking,” said Harry.
“Why would you do that?” asked Draco.
“Did you have any other injuries? Your…” Harry gestured towards his own mouth. Draco’s hand flew to cover his own.
Everything was the same, except every morning, without fail, Harry brought Draco a cup of tea in bed. Draco would smile groggily at him and let Harry sit next to him for ten minutes while they talked about their plans for the day.
to be. He kept imagining the Prophet headlines:
“Thank you for speaking at his trial,” said Draco.
goes clubbing at fifteen.”
“It’s a good plan.”
“I love you,” said Harry, the way he did every night.
“You hated him,” he said.
I will update soon! I have the next chapter written but I like to be several chapters ahead of myself in case I need to make changes. Usually I can do 2k a day but atm all bets are off bc my country is on fire
“I had a bit of a late one, last night,” said Lamorak. “You’ve caught me out.”
of all people should be aware that just because someone is in your family doesn’t mean that they’re, uh… it doesn’t mean…” he stopped. Put his head in his hands.
Hermione would know what to do.
“Draco… did someone break your wand?”
thought Draco, and he tried to pull away before Harry could punch him in the face. Harry stopped him.
“Even worse.” Draco stood, wrapping the cloak Harry had given him around himself. He looked upset. “No. Absolutely not.”
“I’m sorry,” said Draco. “I didn’t mean to snap at you like that. Please forgive me.”
“Yeah,” he said. “I think so.”
“Do you forgive me?” asked Harry.
“I didn’t really mean to say that out loud,” said Draco.
Harry smiled at his Defence Against The Dark Arts textbook. He couldn’t help it. Being back at Hogwarts, combined with knowing he wouldn’t have to have some kind of deathly stand-off at the end of the year, was making him deeply, fundamentally content.
“Sorry, Potter,” said Malfoy. “I really am. Come on, Scorpius, we’re going home.”
“Mate. You’re the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen,” said Ron.
Scorpius smiled, then went red, and looked at his shoes.
Draco stayed in his bedroom until after Potter left for the trial, and Potter didn’t return until after dinner. Draco passed the time making treacle tart, which he figured Harry liked, since he always ate it so aggressively whenever it was offered at Hogwarts.
But although Adelaide had been a shock, Draco explained it away. There was no one else in his life, and so the idea that there was anything wrong with Tertius was too catastrophic for Draco to contemplate. He focused on the way Tertius doted on Adelaide, on the gifts he bought her, the way she watched Tertius, as if he was the whole world. Age was just a number, Draco told himself. True love should know no impediment. He could sense the excuses were flimsy. But there was no one else, and Tertius was generous to Draco. “Blood is thicker than water,” he said, and acted as if it was only natural that he should come out of nowhere and rescue Draco from the streets.
“You think I’m—” he couldn’t seem to say it.
“But I
Harry closed his eyes and breathed through his nose.
“I didn’t…” he suddenly understood something. “Did he owl you all and tell you to leave me alone this week?”
“You should go to Connemara,” said Malfoy. “You went before, after the war.”
Harry tilted his head.
“Trust me. It was more than nosiness.” Harry paused, trying to avoid thinking about the painful twisting in his stomach. “Would you want to be with him, if he was up for it?”
“I didn’t say that.”
if you hadn’t forgiven me, in a secret corner of your heart. It would be healthy. It’s madness to think you could be entirely over it. That it wouldn’t come out, like some kind of terrible, leaking poison, when neither of us expected it. I did… such bad things, Harry.”
“It’s the closest I can get.”
She walked out again.
Ginny glared at him.
“I love you,” he said.
Harry hadn’t forgotten his promise to Scorpius. A week passed, and he knew he had to check on Draco.
Draco laughed.
“L,” said Harry.
“Er,” said Harry.
“Right. Well…” Harry pushed his hair out of his face. “Your dad was always… well-dressed, in school. I mean, he always looked good. He was really handsome. All the girls were after him.”
“Yeah,” he said. “Yeah. That counts for a lot.”
“I—what? How?”
Draco looked sorrowfully into his mug.
“She does
Harry went to Dinsmore’s shop twice in the next week, the first time in the hope that he would see Malfoy, the second, to leave Malfoy a note letting him know that the adjusted potion worked perfectly. Five days passed, six, and still Harry felt no pain.
Beliefs changed slowly, Harry learned, but they did change. When Ron and Hermione had a big fight and Ron came to sleep on the couch, it was Draco who sat with him and gave careful, finely-worded counsel.
Draco kissed his forehead again.
She was screaming away, and Draco lay on his little cot, eyes closed, trying to remember the ingredients for the Draught of Living Death. It was how he passed the time; he brewed in his head.
“You’re a bit boring.”
“I make all the potions,” he said. “All the hard ones, anyway.”
But it was worse, because she was not Harry. Worse, because he would never get Harry again. Worse, because someone else would get Harry. Someone who deserved him.
“That’s what I thought. Are they feeding you?”
“He had a mistress?” asked Ginny.
Harry’s thoughts were slow.
“What?”
Until he saw it, that is. A shock of blond hair. Two shocks of blond hair, and a crowd gathering around them, and Harry strode out of the shop mid-sentence (“Harry, wait, don't go--" said George, but Harry ignored him).
Blaise looked disappointed.
Draco laughed.
In Defence, they were still practicing legilimens.
“You’re an auror,” said Timothy. “You’re trying to arrest Mr. Croome.”
“Thank you,” she said, but she looked disappointed.
“Come on, Pans, this Tim,” said Draco, falsely cheerful. “He’s disgusting. He’s sweaty. What are you going to wear on your first date?”
“Right,” said Harry. “Only you’ve set off the ministry alarms.”
“Do you mind?” Harry asked Draco.
. I can’t believe you knew all this time. I—I’ll refund you for this session, by the way. I’m a mess. Oh, Christ, you won’t stop booking, will you?”
, he thought, in an attempt to make himself laugh. It wasn’t particularly funny. He thrust the wooden beam into place, cast the stabilising spells, then stepped back. He looked at his Mark and imagined how it must have looked to Potter. Like the warning symbols on muggle cigarette packets:
“… wait…?”
Harry hated firecalling. His knees hurt.
“Good,” said Draco. Unchanged, was maybe more accurate. She spouted Milton at him, he tried to avoid her well-intentioned scheming; it was as it always was.
He had pulled on clothes without noticing what he picked up. He was running down the stairs.
“He doesn’t dote on me,” said Harry.
“Or because he’s happy, then talking himself out of it,” said Hermione.
Harry watched the memory where he first knew Draco was in love with him. They had been sleeping together for six months. Harry wondered if
“You would have read into it,” said Draco. “I wanted to sleep with you, not be your boyfriend.”
“It affects the balance of power. At first, people will think you are fascinated by them. This will eventually lead to them being fascinated by you. When you know everything about them, and they know nothing about you, you hold the cards, and they will love you for it.”
“A young man got into the back of my cab with a cat in a carrier.
As Harry left, Michael hugged him hard.
She went after him, leaving Harry in the kitchen, rippling with confused guilt.
“Don’t lie.”
wrote Malfoy.
He made a chamomile tea, chopped up an apple, put a scoop of Nutella on the side. If someone had hurt her… He fumbled the knife.
Cassie’s voice became shrill.
“Fucking?” offered Harry helpfully. “Falling in love? Both?”
“I’ll be careful,” said Harry. Then his voice was in Draco’s ear, slightly too loud and close. “Can you get up?”
represents the boundless optimism of the year 2000.”
“He wasn’t ashamed of you,” said Harry.
“Important things,” repeated Draco. Harry nodded. Draco looked at him.
,” he said, “you heard him, he didn’t tell about the raids; that must have been someone else!”
“A pretty justified fear, it turned out,” said Harry.
“Draco. Draco. Slow down,” Blaise had said.
“Therapist, therapist, therapist,” he murmured. “
, and you might have brought all the Death Eaters to Hogwarts at any point…!”
Draco had gone pale and haunted.
“Who’s left to hate, if not the dead?” said Malfoy finally.
Adelaide was waiting. Draco nodded.
“Please don’t cut me off again,” said Pansy.
Cassie let the cloak tumble free. She wrapped it around her shoulders.
“Why not, Malfoy?’ repeated Potter, his voice terrifyingly cold, just as it always used to be.
“No matter what, Draco, you must get out of this place. Take any option, other than here. You will go mad if you stay.”
“1. Ginny Weasley will never date me, and 2. Jealous fucking isn’t the goal.”
“Christ. Forget I asked,” said Harry. Malfoy laughed.
“Unless you’re serious about him,” said Hermione.
“Show Harry where the shark bit you!” said Teddy.
Draco and Timothy were sitting next to each other at the kitchen table. Draco said something in a low voice that made Timothy laugh, and Timothy pressed his forehead into Draco’s shoulder.
“Literally, what the fuck?”
“That’s most depressing fucking thing I’ve ever heard,” said Adelaide. Draco did move away then, coward that he was. He shifted her gently off his lap and passed her the cup of tea. She said
“You really won’t have Granger or Weasley over?” asked Malfoy, when they were done.
He learnt that Draco didn’t have nightmares—he had memories. Harry would wake up to a wincing sound, and roll over to find Draco clutching his head.
“Draco’s father issues are not amusing, Ron,” she said.
“Thanks, Cass. Just wait till puberty, I’ll get you back.”
Harry waited until everyone else was asleep. Draco watched him open the curtains with an exhilarated sort of resignation.
“I know,” said Harry. “I love you too. Kiss me.”
“Yes,” he said, a little too roughly, then cleared his throat. “He’s all right.”
“Right. Everyone out. Now.”
“You should come over soon. Nev and I are planning on getting a television so we can watch this weird muggle show Dean told us about. Doctor What? About time travel?
. But Ron turned around as they got to the door of the dormitory and put his arm around Draco’s shoulders.
Was Malfoy actually annoyed about the robes and the owl? He had signed “With gratitude,” after all. Harry decided he would go to the movie night, if only to find out whether he’d pissed Malfoy off. Not that Malfoy had any right to be angry, in Harry’s opinion.
“…talk?”
“I don’t see why,” said Harry.
“Yeah, that’s going all right,” he said.
Draco pressed his forehead against the cool glass window.
Draco kissed the nearest part of Harry, which was his ear.
. It was awful to have peaked so long ago, and so unpleasantly.
. Harry didn’t know where to look. Silvery scars covered Draco’s chest. Harry averted his gaze and focused instead on Draco’s arms, which looked strong and capable.
“No,” said Harry. “No, the first session was supposed to be a joke, but—”
“Don’t
Harry felt stupid, but when he tried to apologise, Pansy looked at him like he was a worm.
Draco sighed.
“Did you give him money?”
Timothy rocked back on his chair.
“Sorry,” said Harry.
“Oh, ah, I have something to tell you.”
Harry took him to the room next to his. Timothy’s was down the hall.
“We-ell. I’ve had a good run.”
Draco closed his eyes with a small frown. Harry tried to smile, even though it was useless, because Draco wasn’t even looking at him.
Harry glared at Ron and Hermione.
“Yeah,” said Harry, smiling. “I know.”
“Where?”
Astoria and Draco both turned to look at her.
“Sorry,” said Draco, looking embarrassed. “I was being glib.”
“You mean it,” he said.
“Know what? That you’ll be loved?” asked Harry. L shook his head against Harry’s chest. “Know what?” asked Harry again.
Draco’s eyes moved searchingly over Harry’s face.
“No need,” said Draco.
“I’ve always wanted to be an auror. There’s nothing else I want to be.”
“You’re engaged?”
“I don’t like mine,” said Harry. “I wonder why I can say that, and you can’t?”
“I don’t want to do the whole sneaking out of your bed at sun-up thing anymore,” said Harry.
“Oh, good. I’m tired.”
She sidled over to the table and leant up against it, sitting on his notebook, her thighs exposed. She ran one finger up his chest. He grabbed her hand and shoved it away.
“Oh, fuck,” said Draco. “Fuck.” He closed his eyes. “Marlon’s going to be impossible.”
“I think we should remove the bond.”
“How’s it going,” she mouthed.
“I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry,” said Harry.
Draco stared blankly at Goyle. Goyle stared blankly back.
Draco shook his head. Potter looked at him and gave an angry bark of laughter.
“I don’t want…” said Draco, stumbling towards the bed.
1. Draco Malfoy was a burlesque dancer now
“…Oprah?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, turning over and sitting up so that he could windmill his arms. “Wow.”
Such a slow kiss. It was like flying too fast, knowing you had lost control of the broom and were about to fall. Draco’s hand went to Harry’s jaw, and Harry heard himself make a little noise. He pressed Draco closer, his hands flat on Draco’s back, and he could feel how hard Draco was.
“I hate him,” said Harry. He giggled. “Ooops. Trying not to hate people anymore.”
Adelaide leant into him, and Sebastian put his arm around her. It was a thin, wiry arm, not what she was used to. She had been handled by men, and it was strange, still, to be with a boy. He felt so much more breakable.
“You should get the whole series. Once you read one, you won’t be able to stop.”
“What??”
Draco slouched down on the sofa.
“It hasn’t been busy today, Mr. Croome,” said the boy, who Harry supposed was called Timothy. Harry observed the man he had followed. Mr. Croome, presumably the owner of the shop. He was huge, ominous. There was something greedy about the way in which looked at Timothy. Timothy seemed to feel this, as well, because he shrank under his gaze. “I’m sorry, sir,” he added. “I did get a woman in asking after some dragon’s blood, but as we aren’t getting any in until June—”
“Why? Have I got lentils on my face?”
“So it’s all about finding the imperfections you can handle.”
Draco shook his head and closed the door.
“Shit,” said Harry. “Do you think I was unfair?”
But in fact, Draco turned out to be quite right. He tracked down a fairly neutral reporter at
, sir,” said Misty.
Harry shook his head.
“Shiny,” he said.
“It’s fine,” said Harry. “I like helping.”
“Shy,” Harry had repeated. Malfoy did a shot and the crowd cheered.
“I may have done something stupid,” he said. He put out his cigarette on the ground in front of him, then took out a tissue, wrapped up the stub, and pocketed it, since there wasn’t a bin nearby.
Harry moved her glass onto a magazine.
Astoria made a disapproving sound through her teeth.
“Stuck-up little attention seeker, aren’t you?”
“I think it makes you think you’re dying, and then you, uh, then you feel better. It’s…
“Harry cast a nutritional spell on me earlier.”
“I’m a very private person!”
“We weren’t friends,” said Malfoy quickly.
“Yes, Blaise, thank you,” said Draco.
Ron shook Draco’s hand again at the end of the evening, but Hermione kissed him on the cheek.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
But Draco had already gone.
Malfoy shrugged, a cold, jerky movement.
“Mind if I sit?”
, Draco told himself. He’d known this was coming, since the very beginning.
Harry was speechless. Draco took Timothy and went to the pub.
. It was more of the, violent crime side of things.” He kicked peevishly at the edge of the hearth rug. “I’m not a violent crime sort of
“Swallows?” said Hermione.
It was Thursday. They were at a pub. Hermione had cast a few charms so that they wouldn’t be overheard.
The first word on the list was “arrogant”. From then on, every time he thought he was better than someone, he caught and berated himself. There was nothing he was too good for now, he decided.
Astoria turned away from Mirth. Mirth sat slowly up on the cushions.
“Why?”
Harry guided them out into the garden before they could bicker any more.
“It’s a bit easier now that you know who I am,” said Draco. “Before, it…saddened me to think of the contrast between how you treated me, and how I was scared you would treat me when you found out I was, you know. Me.”
Distantly, a small voice in his head objected that his mother would never have said anything so cruel. But Draco ignored it, because it didn’t matter— she had said it, now. Anyway, it was true.
He was speaking in dashes. He had done it twice before: when Harry ordered him to call Voldemort by his name, and when (Harry’s stomach twisted itself into a knot) he had suggested that Draco loved being ordered around sexually by Steven Hodges.
“What,” said Draco, staring at his hand.
Draco laughed.
Ron groaned. Harry stared intently at the crisps. He had come out as bi already, so people definitely weren’t looking at him, and wondering whether
“Has the Ministry answered about the stipend…?”
But that wasn’t what Harry was angry about— he was jealous, and Draco didn’t have any patience for it. He was powerless to set Harry at ease, in any case. Steven had given him a long list of commands that prevented him from straying in any way from Steven’s version of events.
“We slept together. Then I freaked out and vanished. Not before making some cryptic remarks about him being a Death Eater.”
“I’m not selfless,” protested Draco.
“You love it.”
“Please,” she said. “All Draco did was buy groceries and get himself beaten up. He’s useless.”
“It’d be nicer if the Ferret weren’t here,” said Ron. Draco smiled.
This is exactly the sort of fucked up shit other people don’t have to deal with!”
Harry picked him and carried him to the sofa.
They looked at each other miserably few seconds. Harry wasn’t sure who broke away first. It seemed as if they both looked away at the same time.
“Harry,” said his secretary, knocking on his door as he came in. There wasn’t a good reason for Harry to have a secretary. It was just a prestige thing, really.
Oh, thought Harry. Of course Malfoy had bought all those clothes. Probably he had given them to Harry with plenty of snide remarks about his mudblood mother. For a few days, Harry avoided wearing them, but then he went to a pub night where Ginny was going, and he wanted to look his best. He put on the clothes and felt instantly like his favourite version of himself.
“Yes,” he said.
“They’re not small betrayals,” said Harry.
“It doesn’t have to mean anything serious,” said Draco.
L,” said Harry.
Harry closed his textbook.
“No, it’s Dan, and I haven’t seen him in ages. All right, release me, I’m already late.”
This episode is 47 minutes long!
Just then, green flames leapt up in the fireplace. Cassie disentangled herself from Harry and sprang to her feet.
“You know perfectly well it counts,” he said.
“They’re all manky! Draco,” Ellie looked up and smiled, her wheedling
“We were drunk,” said Draco. If he had sounded bored or casual, Harry would have known he was hurt. But Draco’s eyes were soft, concerned. It was as if he knew what Harry was thinking.
“Don’t make fun. You picked the robes, after all.”
Scorpius grinned and swallowed a large mouthful of ice cream.
“What? No, he isn’t,” said Harry.
“I—some.”
“Catching bad guys.”
Draco slouched against the wall and stroked his eyebrow with one finger. He looked tired and unhappy.
“Do you want advice or sympathy?”
“They’re supposed to leave someone behind to take care of dependents,” said Harry.
“I really don’t think so.”
“What pieces?” he asked.
His teeth had been fixed. Hermione must have regrown them for him.
“Fuckable?” said Ginny.
He wondered if he and Draco needed some space.
“Because! I knew everyone hated the Malfoys after the war. I mean, his father was murdered in prison, everyone knows that.”
“Pansy,” said Harry. She looked up. “Thank you. Malfoy says you’ve been a great help.”
“I am,” she said. “Not by blood.”
“Yeah?”
An icy chill spread through Harry.
“Or it could be the fact that you spend almost every waking hour together,” said Astoria, plucking a bit of fluff in Mirth’s eyelashes. “Be still, sweet, I’ll get it out,” she said, and Mirth held her breath. “There.”
Draco frowned at him, then turned his gaze to Timothy.
“Let’s go back to the main hall.”
“Yeah. To a club. So I can pick someone up,” said Harry, fiercely. He waited for Draco to break, to
“And if he’s not, I’ll shag you,” said Blaise.
, you muppet,” said Draco.
“There are a few charms that could help,” said Astoria. “They’ll only work in small doses, but if you save them up for when you meet with him, you should be all right. There’s a headache one, and a cough-silencer, for when that becomes a problem.”
Tertius crushing my hand in a door hinge because I spilled cream of mushroom soup on the parquet?”
Malfoy frowned.
Draco glanced at him.
if you can afford to buy a Firebolt, that’s an absurd broomstick to give a twelve-year-old, and anyway I’ve been saving up to buy Scorpius his Nimbus for years now—”
“Uh. What was the question?”
Harry laughed.
in the next few days, Draco. There’s going to be such a nice little piece about the pair of you.”
“And he wasn’t,” said Ron. “Obviously. But even I… like sometimes, when I’m having a bad day and have had a few drinks, I think of Draco and want to punch him. Or maybe I just remember wanting to punch him. But if I was dating him—”
“We’re all friends with you guys,” said Harry.
“I didn’t think I’d get a chance to talk to you tonight,” said Harry, to try and cover the fact that his arm had goose pimples from Draco’s brief touch. “You’re very popular.”
Draco looked up.
“Nice girl,” said Potter, with a laugh.
“Did you hear me?”
“Sorry,” said Potter again.
“I will be reporting it to the headmistress, however,” she said. “And I find your behaviour in all this extremely suspect, Mr. Malfoy.”
They didn’t hug. They merely bowed their heads at each other, as if recognising worthy opponents.
“Right. And he’s… mad.”
“I know,” said Draco.
“Was he in love with you?”
“…Harry… I don’t know how you manage it. I don’t know
“It’s—unstable. There’s not… a foundation… it all feels conditional. Except for Hermione.”
“You,” said Harry.
“I’m pretty good at pub quizzes,” admitted Malfoy. His eyes flickered over to Dean and Luna.
Harry was seized by the urge to throw a pillow at him.
“Yeah, see, I’m not so sure,” said Ron.
here.”
“I’m sorry,” said Harry and Draco at the same time.
doubt you’re more fucked up than I am,” said L. “Not that it’s a competition.”
“Forgive me for believing in your intellect,” said Draco, and ended the call with a grin.
“You know,” said Blaise, slicing into his honeyed ham tart, “
Michael and Draco were in the kitchen. Draco was pressed against the counter, and Michael stood so close to him that their shoes touched. Draco’s eyes were wide; he looked the way he used to when he took MDMA; dreamy and distant and black-pupilled.
“No, I ought to go sort this out,” said Draco, patting the pocket with the check in it. He flashed a distracted smile. “I want to send Adelaide to rehab. There’s this private one not too far away that I think she’d be less likely to hate than the others, but I couldn’t… so. Thank you. I wouldn’t have asked if it was for me.”
“Gangs, mainly. Not—it wasn’t sex. I can do
Malfoy only shook his head again. Neville looked at him with that disorienting expression he often had when he looked at Malfoy. They had been together for two and half years, and Harry had noticed it, time and time again—the hungry, possessive way Neville looked at Malfoy, and the tentative way Malfoy looked back. Malfoy closed his eyes and started taking deep, steadying breaths.
Scorpius turned to Teddy.
It was working. Ron and Hermione laughed a lot.
Draco nodded and slowly started to undress. Harry turned away. Now he thought about it, Draco always wore long sleeves. The only time Harry had seen his Mark had been during Draco’s burlesque performances.
“No. I wouldn’t believe him if he did, to be honest.”
“Except for…”
“Oh, really?” asked Draco. Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
“It feels amazing,” said Draco. “You’re going to love it.”
Cassie grudgingly allowed Harry to tuck her into bed.
“I wanted to talk about your Christmas gift,” he said.
His mother hadn’t told him how to respond, however. Draco thought through his options.
“Harry. I’m not saying you don’t have flaws. I’m saying your flaws are perfect to me.”
Draco left without much fanfare, early the next morning. He left a note on the kitchen table:
for happiness,” she said. “Happiness is a side effect. Father and I studied that in  class. Clotworthy Skeffington, the Minister for Magic in the 1640s,
Draco laughed and started pacing again.
“That makes sense,” said Harry.
“So I won’t look at it too much.”
Harry rolled his eyes and left.
He went to Draco’s flat so he could oversee everything himself.
“He asked me out. I said no,” said Harry.
“You can’t avoid her forever, Draco, she’s one of my best friends.”
bad, all along.”
It was a little hard to breathe, but not, Draco reflected, in an unpleasant way.
Harry watched Cassie fall into yet another forward roll.
“Do people always ask for your autograph?” asked Scorpius.
“I’m sorry about your parents, Draco,” he said.
“And how old are you, Cassie?”
“Are you actually?”
“His name was St John Smith. His sister was tortured to death by Bellatrix Lestrange.”
Astoria came to the next meeting Pansy had with Draco.
“Jesus, what are you, American teenagers saving it for prom night?”
“Luna’s fancied Neville for ages,” said Malfoy. “It’s not her fault. Do you know all you had to do, Neville? Just
“Good,” he said. “Are
“Stop talking,” said Harry. “This is my time to shine. Of course it wasn’t good poetry.”
And Draco, who had organised it all, was nowhere to be found, not until the early hours of the morning, when people began to leave, and Harry found him washing up in the kitchen.
Malfoy grinned.
“High praise,” said Draco, flicking the napkin casually over to Harry.
“Wouldn’t work,” said Pansy, when he suggested it. “No tricks, remember?”
“That,” said Draco, kissing him on the mouth, “doesn’t count. Wait here.”
he asked.
Harry buried his face in Draco’s chest, embarrassed.
“Does this go both ways?” asked Draco, through kisses.
Harry was too surprised by Malfoy being
“Your
“Draco,” she said. Her voice sounded fine.
, and he kept it carefully in front of his face.
“He’s a
“Are you… what do you mean? Because if you’re asking if Neville would ever hurt me, he wouldn’t. He’s an idiot, but he’s not…”
“Draco,” he began.
They hadn’t seen each other since. But Potter now looked even better than he had that day.
“He had a lair,” said Draco faintly. “Did he call it that, or did you call it that?”
to go,” said Timothy. “She’s
“I have problems with Draco, but not because he’s gay,” said Goyle.
Harry left them to it for twenty minutes. When he finally went to the kitchen, Draco was speaking in a low, earnest voice, and Timothy was nodding, his eyes on the floor, his arms crossed. Draco had one hand on Timothy’s shoulder.
“Draco,” said Draco.
“Sorry, sorry,” said Ron, who couldn’t seem to look away from Cassie. “Just. You’re probably the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
“No,” said Draco, frowning. “He wouldn’t do something like that. He’s insufferable, but…” he drifted off into thought. “Decent. He’s very decent. At least, he
“Maybe,” said Harry. “You probably know him better than I do. Does Draco seem to you like someone who isn’t hurt when the people he loves are cruel to him?”
She seemed so much more peaceful, so much calmer. She tilted her head and smiled at him.
“You can have one more question,” Draco told him.
Kissing Draco Malfoy was setting Harry’s brain on fire. Every part of him wanted more. His eyes wanted to pull away so that he could stare at Draco. His hands wanted to undress Draco and slide all over him. His head wanted to check Draco was okay. Something in his chest wanted Draco to talk to him, talk to him properly, as he had for a brief moment that afternoon—without censoring himself, without worrying, as if Draco trusted him.
“Ice hotels?”
“Are you all right, Harry?”
“Good,” said Draco. His fingers tapped against each other at his sides. “Good. So. Good morning. Goodbye.”
“You’re deflecting, Draco,” said Kevin, who was the fucking worst.
“I know what you mean,” said Draco. “See you around, Anika.”
Harry tried to laugh. He felt sick.
Draco was deeply demoralised by Potter’s visit. He knew quite well what it signified: that Potter had his doubts about Draco evading Azkaban.
“Draco and Neville were very unhappy.”
“Are you going to sleep with him?” asked Ginny.
Draco knew he had just revealed it was his father who used to sit at his bedside and make up stories for him. To his utmost horror, a hot tear came coursing down his cheek.
“I owe my life to her,” said Potter. Draco didn’t say anything. He took the teabags out and threw them in the bin.
His mother. Malfoy’s wife. He had one, didn’t he— Harry remembered someone mentioning it.
“Can we
“Of course not.”
“Maybe
Ginny, Ron, Hermione and George showed up at Grimmauld Place the next morning, bundled up in woolly hats and coats.
He could already envision Hermione saying exactly, this once he got a chance to tell her. After escaping the enraged Draco, he’d found Hermione had also given McLaggen the slip and left the party early.
“No”, Draco interrupted, blushing – the moment had passed.
Over a week went by until he met Malfoy outside of class again. Harry saw the other boy waiting on the map but had decided it was better if he waited a while to appease Hermione. Besides, she hadn’t been wrong when she said he was behind on his homework. Hermione had been right on one other account – Romilda Vane now waited in the common room with a glass of what supposedly was pumpkin juice every night after dinner and had even given Harry a box of chocolate cauldrons that he only accepted out of pity. The longer he put off confronting Malfoy, the more restless he grew. He couldn’t help but feel he was making up excuses to avoid facing the Slytherin boy. So, at last, one evening when Hermione had rushed off to the library to check something and Ron was busy trying to eat Lavender’s face, Harry slipped out of the common room after consulting the Marauder’s map.
Harry didn’t know where to start. “Well I’m sorry for…”
Fred groaned and blinked up at them and then proceeded to nudge Draco, who promptly shifted over to the side. Ron let out a laugh in relief and squeezed Hermione’s hand as Fred managed to sit up.
“You were behaving so strangely. I knew something was going on with you, but I didn’t imagine it was Malfoy. I should’ve, of course, now that I'm looking back at it the clues were all there, right underneath my nose. And you’ve always been obsessed with him.”
“I think it was more of a suggestion”, Harry replied, hand around Draco’s cock, but Draco only shrugged at this and kissed Harry again.
“But, Harry”, Hermione began again, sounding terrified.
“No”, Draco agreed, his voice hoarse. “I’m sorry too.”
“Yes”, Draco said. “I keep an eye on Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of the Slytherin’s, and the Carrows too. Although that has become increasingly difficult. Let’s just say that neither my father nor I have the Dark Lord’s favor at the moment.”
Hermione seemed equally keen and swallowed what she’d been about to say without looking too disgruntled about it. Only Harry was still displeased. He snuck out the Marauder’s Map underneath the table under the pretense of going through some notes and finally saw him. Malfoy was in Myrtle’s bathroom.
“She’ll stop that if you just ask someone to go with you”, Hermione said as Harry declined a bottle of Butter Beer from a rather sour looking Romilda.
The next evening, Harry went to the room of requirement with Draco’s coin tucked away in his pocket. He’d consulted the map to make sure Draco wasn’t there already, but the latter was having late dinner in the Great Hall. Harry hoped he could recreate the room Draco had conjured forward and was pleasantly surprised when he entered the fabric-clad room. He sat down on the bed, magically altered the coin, and waited.
If Harry hadn’t gotten himself detention for their final quidditch game, he thought Ron might’ve congratulated him for what he did.
“For all of it?”
She rolled her eyes at him and turned to Harry.
“You mean you weren’t invited.”
Draco eyed him for a moment before turning back to his own reflection. “No. I’m not exactly Slug-club material anymore.”
“You must get to the hospital wing right away. With dittany, scarring might be prevented”, Snape said and helped Draco up onto his feet and Draco draped an arm around the professor’s shoulders.
With that, she shoved Harry aside and stormed off. Harry stared after her before turning to Ron.
“I hope so”, was all he managed.
“That Snape was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to?”
“That much I’d figured out for myself, you genius”, Harry replied, earning himself a kick to the shins. “What happens if you do break one?”
Harry considered avoiding Draco after that, but it didn’t feel right. That thing he’d felt last time had frightened him as much as facing a basilisk. Wouldn’t it be cruel to act that way, to pull away when Draco had shown that he had a heart? In the end, Harry couldn’t resist arranging a meeting the following day.
Harry sighed and told her about his conversations with Lupin and Mr. Weasley.
Draco caught it in both hands and raised it over his head.
“I think you would’ve known if he’s dead”, Ron now chimed in, shooting Harry a look. “I mean, one of our school friends? You saw him attack my dad after all, it’s got to be the same, right?”
“I didn’t mean to”, Harry croaked, but Draco’s eyes were shut tightly, and he gave no indication he could hear Harry.
“Stand up”, Draco demanded after a moment of recovery.
When Harry didn’t respond, she continued, sounding increasingly more nervous. “But then that had me wondering why you wouldn’t tell us, and the only reason I could come up with is that it’s someone you wouldn’t want us to know about.” Harry swallowed. “Oh, Harry, I don’t care who it is, just tell me it’s not Parkinson!”
Draco only grunted in response and as soon as they’d gone through the magically appearing door he tore the cloak of and threw it to Harry. Harry lead the way down into the gigantic, high-ceilinged room. They hadn’t gotten far before a figure wearing a stack of hats and a knitted sweater, paired with unmatching socks, came charging at them.
“You seem pretty familiar with the workings of this room”, Harry spat angrily.
Without hesitation, Harry accepted and was swiftly hauled to his feet.
Ron slapped the back of Harry’s head. “Oh, shut up. Come on, I need to sleep if I’m going to be able to put up with finding Ginny and Dean snogging after practice again tomorrow.”
Harry flushed. “Not yet.”
“Come on, Ron”, she said, grabbing him too. “I’m sure everyone will want to hear how we broke into Gringotts.”
Harry was trying to think fast. “I don’t think it’s funny. I – I think he’s going into the Chamber of Secrets.”
There was a dreamy tone in Draco’s voice Harry hadn’t been expecting. He could hardly picture the lofty Narcissa Malfoy walking into an Odeon theatre with her son in tow. Of course, things must’ve been simpler for the Malfoy’s back then, before the return of the Dark Lord, when they were just trying to ease their way back into wizarding society again.
Then, Harry ripped Malfoy’s shirt open so his chest was exposed, unable to stop himself from thinking about how this was the first time either of them had bothered to undress any further than necessary for a quick jerk off.
“So, what is it that’s so important”, Draco asked, tapping his feet against the carpet and looking anywhere but at Harry.
“You said that he told you he’d stopped”, Hermione said.
He turned and walked away, back to his seat by the fireplace where his mother stood watching.
“I knew you’d say something like that”, Ron said when Harry finished. “We’re coming with you.”
“So, you’re saying that
“If yours counted then mine absolutely counts! If you want to know something better, you’ll have to give me something first.”
“And Katie? You made sure she got that necklace?”
“Like that.”
Harry hesitated a moment, and then he pulled out the Marauder’s map. He wasn’t sure he truly wanted to show this to Malfoy, but then again, if Malfoy got caught Harry was sure he would be quick to give Harry up if it meant he could save his own fingers.
Harry lowered Griphook to the ground and managed to seize hold of Dobby just before his knees gave in. The elf collapsed into Harry’s arms, thick red blood welling up around the knife hilt.
“Expelliarmus!” they cried at the same time.
He waited, but nothing happened. Perhaps he’d managed to shake Malfoy off. He took out his wand and was just about to get the Marauder’s map when the door flung open behind him. He saw Draco’s pale face through the cracked mirror above the sink. Harry wheeled around, wand still in hand. Draco stared at him for a fraction of a second before whipping his own wand out and pointing it at Harry.
“Like the ones Hermione made?”
“Why aren’t you three with Voldemort?” Harry asked, trying to edge backwards slowly to get within reach of the diadem.
There was silence.
Before Harry really knew what was happening, Draco had yanked his arm free and grabbed onto Harry’s shoulders, pulling him closer. This time, Harry only needed a moment to understand what was about to happen and he braced himself for it. Yet he met Draco’s lips willingly, kissing him hard, desperately, like this was the only way to get out all the pent-up frustration. Harry intertwined his fingers in Draco’s hair and tried to pull them even closer together, not wanting it to end, not yet. Not that Draco was trying to break free...
(See the end of the chapter for
It was the first time Harry saw him up close in quite a while – before it had felt like Draco was lurking around every corner, but now that Harry had been searching for him he’d suddenly become more elusive than a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. He noticed that Draco’s face looked thinner, his cheeks sunken in and that he had bags under his eyes. Draco saw him looking and Harry’s eyes quickly darted away.
“Now, now”, Draco drawled, slapping Harry’s hand away. “We have all the time in the world. Well, at least a couple of hours. There’s no need to go straight for the finish line.”
Ron pulled out Wormtail’s wand and waved it into the air, making the bottles of Polyjuice potion lift off the bed where Hermione had laid them out.
Draco lay down on top of the makeshift blanket anyway and Harry sank down beside him. Harry struggled Draco’s trousers and underwear down to his knees. Draco just lay there, staring resolutely at the ceiling, limp and clearly embarrassed. Harry, thinking it would probably be comforting if he too was exposed, gave himself the same treatment before he straddled Draco’s hips and bent down to kiss him.
“You could’ve told me, you know. You didn’t have to lie”, Hermione said in a hurt tone.
“The mother of pearl sheen, the spiraling steam, and most notably the scent. The aroma differs from person to person, depending on what you like or find attractive.”
Harry bit his lips and obeyed, slowly working another finger in. The way Draco was quivering and gasping underneath him made him crave some friction of his own, but he didn’t want the distraction. Draco moaned as the second finger slipped inside him and Harry quickened his pace. Before long, Draco was coming, his body shaking.
Draco was silent for a moment.
“How did you get into my vault?” Bellatrix could be heard shouting upstairs. “Did that dirty goblin help you?”
“I’m here”, he said softly.
He found Draco waiting for him outside the Slytherin common room.
“Stupify!” Harry cried and Greyback fell back down again. This time he didn’t get up.
Harry turned around and came face to face with Draco. He was too exhausted for this.
“Ron”, Harry said once the two of them were alone in the changing room after quidditch practice one evening. “Could we talk?”
“That’s not what I asked you. Did you or did you not give her the necklace?” Harry said, raising his voice and stepping forward, his wand clenched in his fist. It was getting harder to keep his cool.
” Ron finally spurted out.
Lucius pushed Draco forward until Harry could’ve reached out and touched him. He didn’t. Instead, he lowered his head and stared at the floorboards and curled his hands into fists to stop them from shaking.
As expected, Dumbledore didn’t make much of the conversation Harry had overheard. Harry felt a sense of defeat now that those whose judgment he trusted the most had shot him down without giving an explanation as to why.
Harry was boiling with rage. “So, you won’t deny it then?”
Harry noted this blatant lie, but he didn’t see the need to point it out.
Ron sighed. “I know that you didn’t know about the poisoned bottle, and you didn’t know for sure he was the one who hurt Katie, it’s just… You were spouting shit about Malfoy before the schoolyear even started, and then you just went ahead and did
Listening to Draco’s uncharacteristic and utterly incomprehensible ramble was more than Harry could endure. Besides, in the end, Draco had freely chosen a side. Harry finally thought he was beginning to understand everything that had happened since sixth year. So, rather than listening to Draco’s monologue, and although it was wildly inappropriate, Harry grabbed Draco by the collar and pulled him in for a kiss. It only lasted a few seconds, but it was enough to uncover something within Harry that he thought had died that night at the top of the Astronomy Tower. During the battle, there hadn’t been time to think about that sort of thing. Draco looked just as surprised as Harry felt when they parted.
Harry ignored him. “Where’s Hermione?”
Harry knew all too well. He and Ron had been chatting about Quidditch when Lavender had come over to sit on Ron’s lap and kiss his neck in a way that made Harry – and anyone else that had to witness it – feel like he was watching the start of a pornographic film.
Harry averted his eyes again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry tried to act convincing, but Ron didn’t look convinced. However, Harry could worry about that later and having made up his mind he set out to find Draco Malfoy.
“You left this with your things. We thought it was odd how you just ran off and wanted to see where you were going”, she explained.
“You disgusting mudblood!
to me. Not only was he not trying to be cruel, but he asked me how my holidays had been and if I’m still seeing McLaggen. He must’ve slipped and hit his head so hard he forgot who I am.”
This last bit sounded utterly insincere, but Harry thought it was a decent attempt, more than he’d expected. He ruefully wondered what Hermione would say if he convinced Draco to join S.P.E.W.
Perhaps it had just been a trick of the light.
Dumbledore held Draco’s gaze steadily although he was slumping against the tower wall. “Ah, yes, the members of the Order of the Phoenix are here tonight. Then it’s best you see to it.”
“Let’s go!” he shouted and turned on the spot.
But of course it wasn’t true. Perhaps it had been at first, but the momentary confusion had turned into deliberate action. Again and again, he’d made the choice to continue on. Again and again, he’d just accepted what Draco had told him. He’d been perfectly willing to be led astray because he’d given into lust and to something else too, something that was pointless to name now that he knew it could never happen again.
“Yeah, well, my aunt and uncle never liked me very much, so they would leave me behind whenever they took my cousin Dudley. I only got to go that one time because the sitter cancelled last minute.”
Harry did his best to pick up the pace without sending himself over the edge, which was getting increasingly difficult. Especially since Draco kept demanding he fuck him faster and harder.
“I’ve been nice to Granger and that… Dobby. That surely must count for something.”
“Oh”, Harry said. He’d made plans to go with Ron and Hermione, but now that Ron and Hermione were no longer on speaking terms he assumed that wasn’t happening anyway. Ron would be off with Lavender, and Hermione, well, she’d just have to make do without him. “I don’t have to go to Hogsmeade.”
His eyes rolled backwards as Harry pumped his dick in time with each thrust. Harry struggled to continue. When Draco finally cried out and came all over Harry’s hand, his body clenching, it all became too much. In an instant Harry was cumming too, spilling into Draco. He collapsed forward, gasping for breath. They stayed like that for a while, chests and cheeks pressed together, until Harry pushed himself onto his elbows.
“Harry”, Draco said slowly, taking a step closer. Harry jerked at the use of his first name – until now it had been reserved for the most intense moments of passion.
Ron looked like he wanted to protest, but Hermione gave him a light kick to the shins and forced him to come along. Too late, Harry realized she was trying to give him a chance to speak with Draco privately. It was about the last thing he wanted.
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
Ron seemed to consider this for a moment. “Blimey”, he finally said. “And he kept you this late? We have classes tomorrow you know.”
“Draco”, he said in a low voice. “Let me see.”
“Yeah, mate, just this week you thought Malfoy was going into the Chamber of Secrets”, Ron agreed.
Ron evidently thought Harry would find this hilarious. Of course, Ron didn’t know that Harry, wearing the invisibility cloak, had snuck out of that bathroom with Draco Malfoy the night before. Harry was afraid to look at Hermione, but he couldn’t help glancing over at her. Her face was hidden behind a book, but he thought she was listening.
“Ehm… Yes Dobby, I liked them very much”, Harry lied, thinking it was better to set an example for Malfoy rather than try and persuade Dobby never to decorate anything ever again. “We’re here to talk to you, that’s all.”e
He did know this: Malfoy had stopped sneaking around. The conversation with Snape proved as much. Then, Harry suddenly thought back on how Malfoy had been disappearing over Christmas break and even at times after that. Harry hadn’t been checking the map often enough lately to be able to say that Malfoy had given up his plan – whatever it was – entirely and feel certain of it. Suddenly he felt even less sure of Malfoy’s intentions than he had before.
“We can protect you and your family. We have more resources than you know. We can send someone for your mother this evening.”
So, there it was. The confession Harry had been obsessing over, but hoped he’d never hear. Harry wasn’t in the mood for any excuses, he didn’t want to hear whatever plausible defense Draco could come up with. It was Malfoy’s fault that Ron had almost died, and Harry could never forgive himself for looking past the proof he had of Draco’s involvement. He should’ve pressed further to find out what really had happened to Katie Bell and maybe this could’ve been prevented.
“No”, a very beaten up and hardly recognizable Seamus Finnigan said. “Neville really knows how this room works. You have to be very specific in what you ask for. Like, ‘I don’t want any Carrow-followers to be able to get in’, and then make sure there are no loopholes.”
Harry nodded and pushed lightly. Draco breathed in sharply as the tip of Harry’s dick slipped inside him ever so slightly.
“You’ve never been good at occlumency, Harry.”
came to mind and the phrase that was written underneath it in the Half-Blood Prince’s potions book: for enemies. Still, it felt premature for that, and Malfoy was still unarmed.
“Well, I did go to the library”, Harry lied. “Then on my way back I ran into Slughorn and he invited me to his office for… ehm… a game of chess and I thought I better say yes, to try and work that memory out of him, you know.”
“Bloody hell, Harry, I thought at least you would appreciate this story. Now you finally have some proof Malfoy’s doing something weird”, Ron sulked, clearly displeased with Harry’s stale response.
Ron and Hermione still looked skeptical.
“Better than the bathroom floor?” Draco asked, wiping a few strands of hair from Harry’s eyes.
As Crabbe lifted his wand to cast another spell, Malfoy grabbed his wrist and yanked it down.
They stayed like that for a while, stroking each other lazily while kissing, until Draco spread his legs slightly – a gesture Harry had already learned to recognize. He relinquished his grip on Draco’s dick and slipped his finger down between his cheeks.
“Harry”, Draco moaned as the tip of a finger pushed against him a bit harder.
Harry didn’t see Draco out of class after that. He stowed the coin Draco had given him at the bottom of his trunk to avoid temptation. It was unnecessary, however, because Draco didn’t try to contact him. Occasionally, Harry would sneak the coin out and turn it over, but nothing had changed. It was for the better, he thought. Draco had been right when he’d said that Harry, out of all people, shouldn’t be running around with the son of a known Death Eater. Harry had let his own physical desire get in the way of everything he was working for, let it get in the way of defeating Voldemort. Draco was on the other side of this and that made him the enemy. Harry had to remember that. He became even more convinced of this as he took up his old habit of checking the Marauder’s map regularly again, and saw that Malfoy was missing more often than not.
With some help from the Half-Blood Prince, Ron and Harry had managed to produce a passable love potion at the end of class. There hadn’t been too many notes on Amortentia though – apparently the Prince hadn’t been too interested in love potions – yet the imperfections were mostly due to their inability to prepare ingredients at a fast-enough pace. Slughorn seemed pleased with the result, despite their potion having a slightly burnt smell mixing in with the other aromas.
Harry didn’t know exactly how long it had been before Draco pulled away. Harry sat up and stared down at his knees, pretending not to notice that Draco was wiping his eyes with his robe sleeve. Harry couldn’t help but think that he’d only ever kissed two people, and they had both been crying meanwhile. Then, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, he looked up.
“That’s enough!” Dumbledore said. His voice was calm, but Harry still understood he’d crossed a line.
“Get away from him you snake!” Ron screamed in anger.
Harry looked around the great hall in search of anyone he could stand to spend an entire evening with and spotted a girl with dirt blonde hair and radish earrings. “I’m going to ask Luna.”
, the Dark Lord surely has an interest in it.”
Harry immediately regretted telling Hermione he was still dateless. “Well, I’ve had other things to think about.”
“Right”, Hermione said, breaking the silence that had settled between them. “Gringotts. Tomorrow?”
“And how on earth do you suggest I do that?” Malfoy’s voice was cold.
Ron shook his head. “Why, who do you think sent them?”
Harry was happy to leave Hogwarts with Ron for Christmas break the next day. He thought it best if some time passed before he saw Draco again. Ron listened eagerly as Harry retold the events of the previous nights, leaving out how the debacle had ended.
Neville shrugged again. “The room let him in. He’s had plenty of chances to give us up too, if he wanted to. It’s actually quite handy having someone the Carrows like on our side. Well, used to like. Malfoy got into some trouble because he cursed Goyle – he was torturing a first year in the middle of the corridor. He said he was aiming for the first year’s friends, but I suppose Goyle didn’t buy that. Crabbe and Goyle can do whatever they want, they’re the Carrows’ favorites, so they made sure Malfoy got the same treatment Seamus and I did. He has to lay low now. It’s been a few weeks but he’s still not… Oh, there he is now.”
