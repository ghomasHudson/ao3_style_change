How could he imagine that Harry would have the same kinks as he did? It was so filthy, and at the same time so completely hot. I was just amazing that Draco could feel that under Harry's hands.
Draco moaned when he saw Harry's cock, desire running through his whole body. He turned as Harry moved him around and breathed in and out when he felt Harry's finger on him.
Draco’s body looked absolutely blissful, anyway. The soft curves of a whole week of rich food made Harry’s stomach coil and wriggle with want; his husband’s hair felt soft and glossy under his fingers, and Draco’s arse cheeks had just the right amount of curve under the palm of his hands....
He moved Draco’s hand to his waist, manoeuvring off and underwear; his giant erection bouncing off his husband’s hip. Already damp and glossy on at the head, it was obvious how fabulously sexy he always found Draco...
Harry wouldn't knot him. Because Draco himself asked. He didn't want to make himself or Harry miserable.
Draco was looking to the mobile as if he could will Harry to answer faster.  He jumped a little when the thing made that chirpy sound that Harry assured him he could change, but he still didn't know how. He tried to hide his excitement, even though he was alone in his bedroom.
Laughing at the thought, Harry pulled Draco close. He’d fixed their sun protection charms before they left, but nothing in his life had prepared him for this level of heat; so both their noses were starting to get a little red. He kissed Draco tenderly, stroking the rounded bump under her floaty flowery. He was still pretty amazed that Draco had agreed to come on this trip but he was utterly delighted that she had.
“Okay,” he agreed. “I’ll come to your house at six. We’ll talk more then... But I’m sure that it was just Pansy nipping past or somebody talking a short cut. Nothing to worry about darling.”
He saved the number on his phone and sent him a message. Draco thought a little about what to say. He wanted to be honest, but also not so much in case Potter didn't want it.
Draco blinked one eye and ran to the bathroom, getting his small sports bag in the way. He had carried that bag to the hotel in the morning, knowing that he would need a clothing change at least.
“I am here to get a massive order of flowers delivered? But I was told not to have you help me, apparently they want your intern to help me with the delivery.” The flustered man replied.
How do Harry always made him come so fast? Before he knew it, he was shooting in Harry's mouth, his cunt gushing out slick as his body trembled with the intensity of his orgasm. He needed that
Harry continued to rub Draco’s gorgeous cock in his palm, squeezing it slightly with his knuckles. His other hand held lightly onto Draco’s side. As he found his husbands lips and kissed him under the jet of water, Harry knew he wanted Draco completely, wanted to spread open his shy little cunt, and to feel so proud when Draco took his cock completely, filling him to the core.
The weeks passed slowly for Draco. She was constantly tired and heavy, her back hurt and her feet too. Her gravity axis was just all over the place and she felt like not walking at all.
“Hi baby,” he replied. “I wanted to tell you that I’m having a special time here with Draco. I think he’s becoming quite an important person in my life…”
Draco was going to tell him he never wet-dreamed about teen Potter, which was a lie, but then Draco needed to keep his reputation on check. But Harry was on him, faster than he expected, and he just screamed in pleasure, his chest rising up from the bed, long hair all over his shoulders and pillows.
"Is your office to your tastes? Is it missing anything?" Draco noticed it needed to be cleaned. The floor was a little dusty, probably because the office was closed before Potter, and no one had minded the floor. He'd have to make a call to General Services. "I'll be checking on you constantly, so if you ever need anything, I'll be here. We like to be present to our employees," Draco said, his body feeling a little hot.
Exiting the shower, Harry lazed on the bed for a few minutes. It was still early and he was a little overstimulated by the sex the night before.
The next thing that happened came as a complete surprise to Draco. Harry crawled down over his body, and gently sucked the head of Draco’s cock into his mouth.
He took of his bra as well, small tender breasts a little swollen. Fuck, Potter really messed with his head, specially so close to his heat. Draco sighed, putting on an oversized tee, and going to the bathroom.
As they got apart, Draco sighed, trying not to cry. His heat was on its end, and it left him extremely sentimental.
“I will fill them, let me check the office and see the damage. You tend to the plants here, and I will call on you if I need assistance. Thank you Elijah.”
They didn't expect to see his baby bump or his wedding band on his ring finger though, nor Harry at his side.
Draco followed him, his heart beating too fast. He loved that Harry prepared him from time to time, kissing his lips and his hair, touching his arms and waist. He couldn't help but shiver, though. He was nervous. It was the first time he would probably touch another man's cock. It was overwhelming in so many ways.
“They feel the same thing as if I was running or swimming. It doesn't hurt our baby in any way, but... Being honest, we should keep our sex pretty vanilla. We don't know how vulnerable they are and if my body is as strong as it seems. My healer says I have to take care and, by the sixth month, I should stop working altogether and keep my movements pretty limited. It will be hard but... If I have to do it to keep Jim alive and safe, I'll do it. I dreamed of them too much to
Harry knew that innocent and blithe expression on Draco’s face far too well. There was obviously some sort of plan at work. All that randy talk was a bit different too; not that Harry was complaining... If anything, the image of them shagging, Harry balls deep in Draco’s blissful little cunt had seared itself into Harry’s brain, replaying over and over like a muggle movie.
“Let's go. I have her bag all sorted and she's still looking like a daughter of mine,” Draco teased.
"Yes, the Ollivanders are as old as the Malfoys in the business. We even have different departments to deal with different situations of their company. I think a visit should be in order. We do it each trimester, but I don't think the person before you did that correctly," Draco said, thinking about him and Harry alone in a trip to another company...
He was definitely close; his Magic was sparking off his skin and he could feel their bond in a tight ring around his heart.
His cock was once again fully hard. Of course, it wasn't impressive as Harry's, but it was surprising that Draco was so excited with so little time after his first orgasm. But it was a surprise for only himself, because he actually had no idea what was happening, or how his body would react to the faintest touch.
Draco was indeed tired. Emotionally tired. But, as if he was feeling that his alpha was awake, his eyes slowly opened, his body curling closer to Harry's by its own.
Truth be told, Draco was ashamed of his kinks. Specially after the talk they had about waiting for babies.
“I’m going to take you to bed now, lay you down and take care of you. What would make you happiest, my love?”
“I needed you; You made me go away. You took my daughter and made me go away. Do you think I'm not capable enough to be with my child? I'm sorry I couldn't protect her today! I know I'm a shite parent! But the least you could do was to be with me once we get home, hun? When I'm scared and guilty and thinking I'm not good enough as a mother, as a wife, even as a woman! That woman told me I was faking myself! That I was the same old Draco Malfoy in girl’s clothes! I know I don't deserve you! I've always known! But you don't need to shove it on my face and take my baby away from me!”
Harry couldn’t help himself. Laughing again, he pulled Draco to him, kissing a line down his jaw and stroking the shell of his ear.
“You’re the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen. I know I tell you every day, but it doesn’t get less true...”
Harry felt all the air leave his lungs as he pushed all the way home, Draco taking all of his cock so beautifully. Every muscle of his body felt alive, ringing with excitement and need.
“Well I refuse to let that be the end of it. We both know that we want each other, so why not let the world know and act on it?” Harry practically yelled into Draco's ear..
He walked to the living room, dressed only with his undergarments, trying to calm down, but his mood was obvious.
“It's a baby girl!” Draco heard, and then the smallest bun on Earth was put in her bare chest. When did they removed her nightdress? She didn't remember. But then the small bundle of whimpering sounds was on her chest, all read and disgusting with fluids badly whiped off, black hair on her little head, small hands clutching at their mum so fiercely.
In fact, Harry felt quite aroused by the idea. He’d become so used to viewing Draco as feminine, he’d forgotten the rush of fucking men. The adrenaline shot through his spine as he deepened their kiss, his tongue exploring the warm confines of his lover’s mouth.
Draco felt that Harry was hesitating, and she didn't want any of that. She grabbed him by his arms and walked to the settee, making Harry sit on it and straddling his lap.
“Come to bed” Harry whispered. “You’re tired... I’m tired too. All I want to do is hold you, have you next to me, Draco. I’ve missed having you close.”
Draco sat down on the sofa, kicking her shoes off and trying to massage her feet but she couldn't reach them because of her belly.
Draco worried his bottom lip. He didn't want to be discovered just now. He wanted to at least enjoy a couple of months.
Everything was like a dream come true, and he had a partner, a job and a life unlike any he’d dreamed possible when he was just an orphan locked in a cupboard.
Harry’s balls tightened, and he spurted his thick come into Draco’s wondrous cunt. His cock knotted, and he knew they were locked together perfectly, clasped tight until the moment it would start to shrink.
Harry examined the menu, which he didn’t think had changed since he was a child. He could feel the anxiety pulsing from Draco, so he tried to keep the conversation light. “You look gorgeous today,” he commented. “Well, you always do. But Lyra will adore those sandals. She’s always loved silver.”
He didn’t know how long it would last though. Right now, he was going to watch his Muggle telly. The football had already started.
Draco pleading made Harry’s prick jerk, so he gave his balls a squeeze, willing himself to calm. Then, without any further hesitation, Harry spread Draco’s nether cheeks and felt his husband's whole body jolt with expectation as he did so. Draco’s own cock was long and erect, the head of it glossy with precome. Draco’s skin was warm, smooth and strangely alien with its new hairlessness. Harry would like to have licked, delved and explored had this been any other night.
A small part of Draco’s soul curdled and died, and he sat bolt upright, simultaneously trying to fling the accursed boxers across the room whilst trying to cover up his stiffy with his other hand.
The water dripped down his hair that clang to his back. He looked up to Harry's eyed and hugged him by his shoulders, tiptoeing so he could kiss Harry on the mouth. He was so turned on that maybe... Maybe if Harry offered, he wouldn't deny him. He would just give in. Even if he was embarrassed. He wanted Harry too much, just too much.
Pushing her against the wall, Harry grabbed Draco by the waist, not letting her move a muscle. He forced a kiss down her throat, her lips soft and throbbing underneath his. His body felt hot, tight and excited, his magic ricocheting through both of their bodies.
“So good, Draco... You took all my cock so well... You looked magnificent stretched out round me, just perfect.”
Taking a deep breath, Harry presses forward. “You’re perfection,” he hissed, biting his lip in anticipation.
Entirely unconsciously Harry leaned over to the other man. He kissed away the water incredibly gently. The water was cool on his lips, and Draco smelt amazing, fresh, citrusy and delicious.
He bit his lip, thinking of the nice tight trousers Draco wore, and the way his nice round arse filled them out so nicely.  It certainly wouldn’t hurt to get a little closer to the omega. All Harry needed to do was keep his head, and not
The only thing that Harry decided was a pet. When he was growing up with the Dursley’s, one of the things he’d envied other children the most for were their animals - rabbits, cats and guinea pigs were all lovely, but he didn’t know if they would suit Draco. Maybe a magical creature, like a crup of some description? Harry decided he’d think about it a little more, and talk about it with Draco that evening. She might be furious about the idea; after all, he reasoned, she’d have to do most of the looking-after of whatever pet they chose.
Draco's eyes rolled back, and he tried to shove back at Harry, even though the alpha's strength was enough to push him completely forwards. His chest was resting on the mattress, and he could feel the burn building in his lower belly.
“I’m actually thinking of making a move in a short while,” said Harry carefully. “It’s my daughter’s birthday this weekend. Got to collect her cake for the party tomorrow... Family commitments. You know how it is.”
He could have kissed Molly for taking Jasmine for the night. Both of them were exhausted by her night time parties, and were well ready for an evening off. Harry felt confident that Draco’s self-image had improved massively in the last few weeks, and he hoped they were ready to resume a more intimate relationship.
“Something... Something weird happened...” Draco managed to say after following Harry around. He had paid for everything, and then walked them both to their house. Draco didn't know what to say. He really, really wanted to express what he was feeling, but he was so confused about
! Truthfully, he wasn’t sure if Draco would be impressed or not, but after last night’s activities he was absolutely starving.
Harry lay against Draco’s back, his heart racing a mile a minute; the breath tight in his chest and hardly even able to open his eyes. He’d never felt an orgasm so powerful before, and the aftershocks were still coursing through his veins.
“I don’t think any modern lady such as yourself needs to have me shackled to her... I promise you’d get bored of my antics very quickly.”
, it was simply delicious. He moaned a little when he felt it crushing between his teeth, and put more of them inside his mouth at the same time.
It hurt. But it didn't hurt as much as what it represented. It represented that Draco was wrong. Wrong to be a wife, wrong to be a mother, wrong to be a human being. She was born wrong, a boy with too many bits, and now a girl with too many bits. It was like Draco could never be what she was without having people around telling her she was
Harry pulled Draco to him, dragging his hands roughly all over her body. She felt amazing, soft, searing hot and very, very sexy. He felt agitated, provoked and like he could lose his control incredibly easily....
Draco tried to respond but it was impossible. Her voice just didn't reach her mouth, getting stuck on her throat. But she denied with her head. It wasn't hurting, but she was worried. Her baby wasn't supposed to come, it was too soon.
“I’ve never really had much in the way of self-control, Draco”, Harry whispered. “And I’ve always thought that patience was overrated anyway...”
Draco looked at Harry and once again frowned. He didn't know what Harry wanted to say, what he was meaning.
Draco walked to Harry, grabbed his hands and put them over his breasts, pressing them against the sensitive nipples, the calloused skin making him shiver with pleasure. He gasped a little between a smile.
"I've heard of it. Completely outrageous. I knew this girl would be a disappointment since she was a little kid. Thankfully, we didn't let our Draco play too much with her. Can you imagine if it is infectious?" His mother said, a tight smile on her lips as if she was trying hard to please her big sister.
The evening wore on, the guests lavishing love and affection on the couple before making their goodbyes. As midnight approached, they found themselves alone.
As Draco was depositing the checks, he stopped to check on Harry's message back. He stopped for a couple of seconds, his heart beating so fast and so strong he thought it was going to break his ribcage.
Finding his footing, Harry started to move more speedily, rocking his hips and enjoying the rosy arse of his husband as he took every inch of Harry’s massive cock.
things together... But most of them are about Jasmine. I miss us being lovers and not only parents...”
“Fuck, Harry... Can you see it? It... It... It's a... It's a baby... It's really a baby... Oh my fucking Salazar, it's... “
Draco’s and his scent intermingled, and Harry’s entire body felt sensitive and sexy. They’d known each other only four days, but Harry knew it’d never been this good with Ginny, or any other partner in his life. It was as if Draco had been cut from marble, a statue made only for him to regard. This was all he could imagine wanting forever.
“But I’m starting to realise something about you Draco. You always know better, don’t you? Know better than
Eventually, however, he must have dozed off. The sky has grown dark and evening had fallen. He looked down at what had woken him: the buzz of a text message. Draco was asking him to sleep over!
. The feelings he's been hiding threatened to come again, and Draco bit his own lips. He wouldn't cry anymore. He had the whole day of crying. Now it was time to be as strong as Pansy and move on.
He positioned himself close to Draco, but didn’t thrust home. He knew that Draco’s hymen was still intact and he knew this would be agony. He waited, needing his beloved’s permission before he took him forever.
The night was unnaturally warm for September. Harry cracked open a window, hoping for some cool breeze to soothe him. Beneath the rough wool Harry’s skin was itchy and sweat-sheened. His cock was full, tight, sensitive, and had been in the same state much of the day. This Equinox lovemaking ceremony had driven him half out of his wits already, and the act hadn’t yet begun.
Draco had to remember he was standing and so falling could hurt him badly, so he tried hard to hold himself up. But the sensation of Harry's mouth and tongue was almost too much. He felt himself leaking, getting wet and slick, the water still falling fuzzing his thoughts.
Draco tried to stay prim and poised when eating, but pizza... It was hard to eat pizza like a gentleman, especially when he had an oaf of a boyfriend at his side. It was delicious, though, and he didn't care he was licking his fingers after.
He kissed the shell of his husband’s ear, and gave his earlobe a tentative bite. His fingers continued to stroke Draco’s round little breasts, enjoying their softness, the way they dipped under his fingertips.
Harry had no idea what he was thinking, so Draco didn't want to correct him. He knew Harry had amazing intentions, but... It wasn't the time. He went too far already when he let Harry penetrate him, he didn't want to do it all like an impatient person and lose all the progress he's had.
“Going to take this slowly, Draco,” he gasped, lining up his immense cock with Draco’s perfect arse. “Hold onto your legs really tightly, love, and push back against my cock. Your great big swollen prostrate will give you so much pleasure...”
Harry couldn’t bring himself to pause. He was too far gone, too excited, too randy for his lover to stop now. His cock was as hard as iron, and he knew he’d be ready to pop before many more moments were up...
Draco waited, but then he got impatient waiting for Harry and just walked to the bathroom. He didn't want to leave his mind wandering, he knew he needed to move so his mind wouldn't play tricks on him.
Harry pulled Draco to him, revelling in the omega’s soft, warm skin and his sweet scent. He pressed a few more chaste kisses on the top of his silky hair, and made his way to the door. There were still a few more hours of the day left, and if Harry didn’t want to attract suspicion he needed to work every minute of them.
But he was British through and through, and he wanted their child to feel the same. Home felt superb; throwing down their bags, Harry plonked his body down on the settee.
He moved closer to Harry, raising himself on his knees to walk and sitting straddling Harry's legs, so his cock was rubbing against Harry's. The size difference was so contrasting Draco almost came with only the vision of it. Harry's cock was big, his knot forming and making it even bigger. Draco's was much smaller, so delicate and light against his alpha's one. He grinded them together, holding them with both of his hands, feeling his orgasm come slowly. He just needed a little bit more...
When they arrived at their room, it was blessedly mild. There was a weird contraption on the wall, and after unshrinking their trunks, Draco kept looking at it.
“Don't worry about me, Harry. I'm a healer, I'm sure if I can fix your almost broken balls I can heal a post-partum stretch,” Draco winked one eye, and smiled when he talked about taking a photo. “Yes, let's send it to her... But I'd rather have all three of us in the picture. Maybe one of the mediwizards can take a picture of us? Now you can take one of hers... She's small, but she's so beautiful. I think I want her nursery filled with pictures of her...”
Draco certainly didn't know what he was doing. It was the first time he was doing many things: sexting an alpha, called him to his house, making it casual... Draco wasn't a casual person. No, he wanted all the traditional stuff. But hey, he didn't want to die without feeling the rush of it.
He raised his hands and took off his t-shirt, exposing the black sports bra he was using under it. It made him look completely flat on the chest, but once he took it off, his small breasts and pink nipples were free to breathe.
“You’ve been amazing today, so sexy, so hot... Now, I’m going to concentrate on your cock, make you forget you’re hurt. You’re going to show me how you can come just for me...”
part of himself to get pleasure from. It was... Lewd, almost dirty. Draco was confused, but so, so much aroused, that his mind couldn't focus much with what was happening.
Draco felt his eyes water. He didn't want to upset Harry, but he was panicking. He bit his bottom lip, and swallowed hard.  He didn't even make an effort to get the towel when it hit him, and looked up to Harry.
Draco felt blissful surrounding Harry’s cock, like the strongest, most powerful magic he had ever experienced. This was sex like Harry had never encountered before; he felt the pull of their bond reverberate through his skin, their minds meeting as well as their bodies.
“Harry...” he moaned, out of breath. Fuck, he wanted to feel it all. He needed to feel it all, but not today.
Harry found Draco’s closed little slit, so tight and snug. His hand was wet, warm and lathered with soap. He wanted everything to feel incredibly comfortable, and safe for his husband. Using just one digit, Harry traced a route around the edge of Draco’s cunt, stroking slowly and applying the tiniest amount of pressure. He held Draco firmly in place with his other hand, not wanting to him to slip.
"I like novel rubbish, Potter. It makes me feel like someday I might have a charming prince on a white horse come to save me from my high castle. Do you like horses, by any means?" Draco asked, jokingly, sipping his wine. Draco drank because he was used to it, but he preferred sweet wines. He'd never admit it, though. How peasant.
“Are you okay, sweetheart? You went down fast there, baby, gave me a bit of a shock. I think we should retire to bed, start the rest of our lives in tomorrow. You’ve made me the happiest man in existence today... Come to bed with me darling, I want to hold you close all night”.
It passed in a flash. Suddenly, she was in the maternity ward, and then she was in a bed, and many people dressed in green were around her. Some of them saying something along the lines of 'healer Potter', 'how to you feel, healer Potter?', 'do you feel any contractions yet?' and she just couldn't answer. But they did get to hear her screams of pain when Jim forced out. It was like her hips were breaking and getting stoned in the place they were.
He took a wash, leaving his hair to dry itself and put on some jeans and a black jumper, together with some black converse shoes. He didn't care about look proper or omega right now. He just wanted to get home and relax for once is his life.
“Love, she doesn’t know she doesn’t want to sleep... She’s just a baby, and she isn’t tired. If she’s refusing to feed, I’ll take her for a bit. You have a shower, make us both a cup of tea and try to relax... You’re exhausted, darling. You’re expectations are far too high.”
He let Harry hold him close, and it was indeed so, so good. He closed his eyes, feeling at home, as he always did when he was with Harry. He put his plate on the side table so he could be as close as possible to Harry.
Draco released a surprised squeal, his legs closing slightly with the weird and unexpected sensation, what caused Harry's finger to slip out of him with his movements.
Before he could even think about what was happening, he was coming in Harry's mouth, his stomach contracting and his holes twitching from pleasure. His cunt was leaking his transparent slick, making his arsehole wet with pleasure and saliva from Harry's mouth.
Draco’s movement jerked Harry’s hand, inadvertently making his finger go deeper. It felt fabulous, clutching his finger which had breached Draco past the knuckle.
The trip back to the hotel felt like subtle torture for Harry. There was a definite energy between the two of them, a tension that hadn’t been there before. Harry felt excited, his stomach tied in knots, his heart racing.
“I cannot think of anything I want more at this moment than you. I want to be inside you, as close as we can humanly be,” Harry murmured. He was already so hard, full of emotion and attraction, all focused on Draco.
“I think it’s harder for the mum in our situation, her life gets turned upside down and it’s hard to see how you’ll get back to the person you were before... But Draco, I do think you are doing so well... Our baby is thriving, and happy and comfortable. And you look beautiful.” Harry took her hand in his, playing with each of her fingertips.
“You’re everything to me, Draco... You and Jasmine. I’ll do anything to protect you both. Tell me what you want from me.”
Harry's moan made Draco smile, knowing that he was doing good made him all hot for Harry. He put in more effort, his hand squeezing and relaxing, his saliva slipping down his tongue as he licked more and more of Harry's cock's soft head. Feeling bold, he opened his mouth even more, wrapping it around its head and, a little awkwardly, bobbing his head up and down just as he did with his hand.
"I'd lose everything. I want so-o much to-o be-e with yo-ou, Harry! B-but I'm scared! I'm so scared! I'd be the ha-happiest p-person with you, but then-then I'd lose my family, and my job, and the rest! I don't know what to do! I'm afraid of making a mistake... With them, with you... I don't want to lose you, Harry! I'd
He breathed in Harry's scent, feeling his mark on his neck throb. It was a marvellous sensation, knowing he was in the place he had always wanted to be.
"I guess we should part now, big strong alpha," Draco teased with a smile. "But I'll wait for you in my knickers are 6:30, in my bed."
Draco felt her heart blow with want and happiness... His? Her?  It was still confusing to her own mind, because she felt like it was wrong to feel like a girl. It was wrong, and weird, but it was also so,
“Nothing at the moment, Draco,” Harry smiled, aiming to swipe a bite of his wife’s toast. “I’m so full of love that there’s no room for toast... I’m hurt; you don’t seem to be having any problems. But then I suppose you do have to keep Jim the worm fed.”
Nott was spouting the same macho, alpha bullshit that he’d heard all of his life, and he was surprised that any in his generation still believed those hackneyed old lies.
“Jasmine is a beautiful name... Maybe we could give her Narcissa, for a middle name? She’s part of your family line too,” Harry smiled, leaning over to kiss his wife.
“Listen to yourself Draco! Bloody hell... Should have let you die in a fire? What’s wrong with you? Why would you even say that? I love you, Draco. Fucking love you! No, I’ll admit, I was traumatised and upset this afternoon. Yes, I needed space, and I’m not going to apologise for that, either. So stop it. Just stop it Draco. I’m bloody sorry about what happened. You shouldn’t have to protect Jasmine.  You should be able to take your baby to the park and not even worry about what’s going to happen.”
"It was everything I dreamt of," Draco mumbled, holding one of Harry's arms and closing his eyes. "I think I'm going to sleep here... See you in the morning, alpha... "
Perhaps it was simply that time had passed since he’d touched her, but she felt ready like he’d never experienced before. Her cock was hard under his touch, tiny but most definitely swollen and desperately hot and he rolled it around his palm.
He called an Uber, and feeling lost and desperate, he gave Pansy's address. His friend would know how to take care of him. He needed to get out of this world of wealthy people and stupid alphas. Right now, he needed the comfort and kindness of a fellow omega.
The next month passed quickly for Harry. Hermione was getting bigger every time he and Draco visited, and on one momentous day she pulled Harry’s hand to her thickening waist, letting her oldest friend feel her baby moving.
"Harry... Harry, I'm ready... Fuck me, please...! Fuck your bloody boss in the arse," he said, out of nowhere, pleasure running over his body with the words. "Show him his place, alpha."
Draco dressed in his usual clothes when he was at home - a t-shirt and some black, simple knickers. He went to the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth, and when he left, the amazing smell of bacon and coffee assaulted his nostrils.
Draco tried to swallow as much as possible but, unused to the sensation, he sputtered a little. He got away from Harry after he finished coming, and cleaned his chin with his fingers, licking them while looking at Harry. Draco got up, his eyes tearing up a bit, but he had a smile on his face.
But at the same time, he was fascinated by the idea that Draco wanted to take things further... Always so shy about his body, so lacking in confidence about sex when they spoke, would it prove to him that he was more than enough, that Harry was so erotically charged by Draco?
, and that was the most important thing. Draco could decide for the first time what to do with his life, and he knew that, in the long run, this was what would make him happy.
"Fuck... Harry... Harry, it's so good... Fuck me with your tongue... Open me up for your thick cock..."
Harry had to admit that he was indeed impressed with all the different food choices his hosts had laid on. It was nothing like the meals he ate at home. Everything was far fresher and more plentiful.
"LEAVE!" His father screamed at least, and Draco left, trying not to cry, trying not to think he was leaving his life behind. Trying to remember he wasn't actually alone, and that he wouldn't end up on the streets.
“Take off your clothes, omega,” Harry demanded, insanely desperate to see Draco nude, and conscious that they’d be ruined soon if they didn’t disappear... His heart was racing in his chest, and every inch of Harry’s skin was awash with goosebumps. The friction of his cock rubbing against Draco felt beautiful, and Harry knew if he wasn’t careful he’d come just from frotting alone, like some seventeen year old virgin.
Of course, he was terribly excited to see Draco once more. The omega had wormed his way into Harry’s thoughts and dreams all night long. Every dream had been about the long, blond hair of the omega, and how it might feel for Harry to run his fingers through it whenever he wanted. Harry wondered also to how it might feel to share his evenings with Draco; the share the warmth of a bath or have long, lazy evenings reading and watching TV.
Draco reached for the first thing in his hands reach - a vase, from his mother - and threw it to the other side of the room, with a desperate scream full of sadness and anger.
“You’re wonderful,” said Harry, feeling a little sleepy himself. “I think you’ve taken on this parenting business like an absolute star. Jasmine couldn’t ask for a better mother than you. She’s really lucky...”
“Okay... Like you bloody well know, I’m not a legilimens Draco. You’ll either talk to me, or you won’t, but we’re not going to hang around here all night. We’re going to have showers, put on some nice clothes and have the best dinner at the best restaurant we can find.”
Draco knew, that being who she was, having the body she had, she should be satisfied with however baby the destiny had given her. And Draco knew she would love and care for Jasmine it doesn't matter how she felt in the future. Maybe, in the future, Jasmine would feel like Draco felt like now - neither a full boy or a full girl, or maybe both at the same time - but for now, Draco felt relieved that she wouldn't need to worry about bullies in her school. She wouldn't need to worry about talking to all her teachers about why she had to go to the staff bathroom, she wouldn't need to worry about people peaking into her skirts just to see 'if the rumours were true'. Draco felt bad to feel relieved, but then she did. She would hide this feeling with her forever. No... She wouldn't tell it even to Harry. She didn't need to show him how old-fashioned she was still.
"Oh God... Oh, God! Stop, stop, I can't... Fuck, I can't come anymore... Too much! Too much!" Draco screamed, his body too sensitive, so sensitive his pleasure hurt. "Gosh, come touch me elsewhere...!"
Pulling away, panting and red-faced, Harry said they needed to take a break. Going into the kitchen for dessert, he couldn’t help but reflect that his fiancé was simply irresistible.
When Harry touched his cock, Draco screamed, the touch surprising and exquisite. He had never let Harry touch him there, and now that he was feeling it for the first time, it was too much to handle. He was too sensitive; it was too hot, too much. Before he knew, before he could announce it, he was coming hard, his whole body leaving the bed and he trashed around, pleasure tears falling from his eyes. His come drenched his knickers, making him feel wet and sticky, but it was good. Fuck, it was so good.
Harry shifted his body, enjoying Draco’s hand touching him beautifully, all over his shorts. He was hard as iron, his balls deliciously tight.
Draco was truly embarrassed. He has never exposed himself in such a lewd way before. It was a completely new situation, and somehow, it looked
“That’s the plan, Mr. Malfoy,” Harry laughed, pulling Draco into an incredible hug, blanketing himself around the smaller omega that had just arrived in his line of vision.
“Bloody hell, Draco,” Harry said, slack jawed and incredulous. He stood in the doorway, his ridiculous hair stood up in every direction, Muggle joggers hanging low on his hips. “What the- Were those my boxers? Were you-“
With Harry's question, Draco went bright red, his mouth opening a little. Was he okay with that?  Did he feel hot with it? Draco considered for a few seconds before replying.
Jasmine just giggled as Harry tickled her, trying to extract an answer. They always played a similar game, and where he would guess more, and more outlandish answers.
He didn't know he'd like a little pain with his pleasure, but now that he was feeling it, every little dot of it made him closer and closer to his climax. It wasn't a big source of pain, no. It was like pinching his nipples hard, a slap on his arse, biting his bottom lip. But it was constant, and as he thought of how bizarre it was, the pleasure exploded.
You’ve given me my life, given me a future. I was happy before I met you, but I wasn’t fully alive. We’ve got everything going for us... I’ve no doubt we’ll have a baby; a brother or sister for Lyra; we’ll have decades of happiness. And you’ve given up so much to be with me, love. I’m going to make it worth it. Adore you forever. You’re my darling, and you always will be.”
? And that my sorry death eater arse couldn't do a thing to protect my child? If it had happened to you I would have been with you!  Not send you away like you did to me! At least if you had explained something...”
He pressed in the numbers from the text and took the elevator to flat 504. His heart was beating rapidly in his chest, and his whole body was sweating. His cock was hard and he could smell the sweetness of Draco’s pheromones through the bloody
Draco got close to Harry as Jasmine closed her eyes, tucking her thumb into her mouth, the other hand holding her dog toy tightly.
“Do you plan to have me and Jasmine attached to your ankles?” Draco smiled a little, tired, as she decided to straddle his lap and hide her face on his neck. She knew Harry liked to be alone when sad, but she needed someone at her side. She needed someone to talk to, someone to be close. It wasn't weird that she resorted to be friends with a ghost when she needed desperately for friendship.
Draco took off his blazer, his black shirt, toed off his shoes and, as he moved towards his bedroom, he was only wearing his black, silky lingerie.
“Harry, she's all ready,” Draco said, pulling her braid out of the way and putting Jasmine on her arms so she could meet Harry, that was fixing the baby's bag.
“I’ll be here at nine in the dot, and I’ll bring you everything you packed and we’ve forgotten... Is there anything you’d like me to bring you to eat or drink? I love you so much, love. I’m so proud of you.”
, and the rest of the wizarding world wanting to know how any times per day he went to the loo was an absolute blessing. He and Draco were going to have a wonderful time here, Harry could tell already.
Draco was struggling to adapt to his new living arrangements. Merlin, but Harry was obnoxious. He was every part the Gryffindor git that Draco had been expecting.
“You are way too good for the world, you know that?  And how did you make Jim sleep?  She was so fussy with me. Do you think she doesn't like me?”
In a couple of minutes, he received an e-mail. It was the official e-mail of his company, telling him to get his things by Monday. Also, that he had to leave his flat by Monday as well. Under it, it had Nott's name.
“People used to say I was handsome at school... but it's different when you say it.” Draco admitted, raising his head and kissing Harry on the mouth, slowly. “Do you want to come back?”
Draco pretends not to like it, but then the shiver that runs down her body makes her lie obvious. She loves it and she can't stop admiring how handsome and strong Harry looks with a beard. She can't stop scratching it with her fingertips, feeling safe and warm.
“I never thought it could be like this again,” Harry admitted to Draco. “I’ve never wanted to open my heart again. I thought Ginny was it for me... Don’t get me wrong. I knew she wasn’t my fated mate or any of that romance novel rubbish. We got on well, had friends in common... I thought what we had was good enough. But now, I see her with Blaise, and yes, she’s happy. And I think, Draco, I’m just getting ready to open my heart once more. I think that I want some of that happiness too. Every time we meet, spend time together... I’m yearning for more.”
“I'm not trying to send mixed messages; I thought I was being pretty obvious.” Draco said, sighing. “And I'll tell you all as soon as we come back to the hotel. I just thought I could... you know... do something people in school used to do. Play sex? Is it the name? When you tell naughty stuff and get hot from it? Well, guess I'm pretty bad at it. I'm sorry.”
Harry hoped Draco would calm herself, just a little. He was still in a cold fury over the events of the afternoon, but like everything in his life, he felt better if he had a plan.
"Shut up, Potter. I know I'm younger than you, but I'm an adult. I know what I'm feeling and you know what you're feeling. My life is on hold since I presented. And seriously, you are a way better option than good old Ollivander, don't you think?" Draco laughed, putting himself up with one arm so he could look at Harry better, touching his face and resting one leg over Harry's, unabashed, careless that he was completely naked. "Would you trust me enough with her? I'd love to meet her. It... It would mean the world to me to see her."
Harry looked on aghast at Draco’s tears, his heart shattering more with everyone that rolled down his lover’s long, aristocratic face. The truth was, as much as Harry loved and wanted Draco, he could never tell him to give up his life and everything he knew. That wasn’t the alpha he knew himself to be. Not in his heart, anyway.
Slowly, she unwrapped her baby, supporting Jasmine on her legs, and took off her green and white onesie with a “P” on the chest area. Carefully, she opened her nappy - clean, for now, as she had just changed -  and looked between her legs. Draco didn't know
Harry ripped off his shirt, before the material choked him. His nipples felt as if they were burning and his heart was thumping in his chest. There was an animal, a beast roaring in his chest, raring to escape and to conquer Draco. He wasn’t an omega, but he couldn’t help but feel like he was slipping out of his very own mind.
"Ah... I was hoping I could say hello to her. I'm a little embarrassed of how things ended yesterday. I guess I'll have plenty of chances now that we're bonded," Draco said, coming closer to Harry and kissing him tenderly on the lips. He was so happy he could
Draco smiled, sitting on his bed as his plan was traced on his mind. He got his extra phone from his bag, turned it on and called Pansy from it.
Draco let go a soft sigh, his nipples hardening at the mere touch of Harry's tongue on his throat. The kiss was tender, but full of desire, so Draco opened his mouth, letting Harry in. Their tongues touched, and Draco hugged Harry by his shoulders, trying to press his small, pliant body to Harry's. He was wearing so little clothes that he felt almost naked.
Harry moved his mouth into position over the pulse point of Draco’s neck. He was almost shaking with the pure pleasure of his omega’s scent, and his took in a deep lingering breath.
“I’m sorry, but why would Draco Malfoy be insistent on talking to me, we have not been in contact in over five years.”
Harry opened his phone, typing Theo Nott’s name into various different social media apps. Of course, there were the typical photos of at university, with champagne bottle scattered everywhere and drunken exploits. There were posts talking about his work successes, and how wealthy he was... It didn’t take Harry long though, and he soon had what he wanted.
“Don’t worry about the time. I enjoyed our chat too, sorry if I seemed a bit distracted. I promise, my mind is
Harry was on Draco in a moment, hands all over him, removing articles of clothing with very little finesse or care for how they would look when they were put back on.
now it was finally time to leave. He knew he oughtn’t to be late. It was only tonight that the veil between the magical and the natural world would fade to nothingness.
Draco got up, walking to the mirror and fixing his long hair, turning back to Harry and smiling at him.
to be your boyfriend. I've... I've never had one so... Fuck, Harry, I fall in love with you a little deeper everyday," Draco admitted, touching Harry's face. "But maybe only tell this to Lyra, for now? I don't want people at work to find out... My parents would and... They won't be happy."
Harry was absolutely, completely petrified when they walked through their door. That was the thing about babies. They were the world’s biggest responsibility, and they came with absolutely no instructions! What did you actually
Draco dreaded the weekends. He liked it because he was slightly free from work - slightly because he'd still receive calls and e-mails and messages all the time - but at least he could sleep until he wanted to wake up. The bad part was having dinner with his parents. They'd be happy with his work on the company, but then his mother would ask, politely with a small smile: "what about an alpha? Have you met a good one these days?" to what he'd reply "No, mother, I've been just working".
Harry hadn’t needed any help with his cock. He woke up half hard every morning as it was, and the extra stimulation of the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen had filled his prick out completely.
“Help me take it off,” Draco asked, since his legs were under Harry and he couldn’t take his jeans off. “And take off yours too. Too many clothes here.”
“They killed my mummy!” The kid screamed at the top of her lungs, holding one of the aurors by their arm. “Put them in Azkaban, the Death Eater killed my mummy!”
Having said what he wanted to say, Draco turned so he could change into more comfortable clothes now.
When Harry touched his cock, it was limp, the pain having stopped the pleasure, but as soon as he touched it, Draco felt it reacting once again. And, when Harry got on his knees, Draco's heart beat faster. He never received oral sex, and the expectation made his eyes get darker.
They got the portkey together with all of Harry's team members a couple of days later. Draco had packed - for both of them, since Harry was absolutely clueless about fashion and what clothes to wear - and they had shrank Draco's incredibly heavy trunk and Harry's, so they could travel. They were going to stay in the same hotel that the team would, but Draco was hoping their room was far from theirs. Harry's teammates were too loud all the time.
He wondered if he could ever get used to the heat of Brazil, because the people were wonderful; friendly and kind. But he didn’t think so. For better or worse, Harry’s heart belonged in England, and he knew Draco could never leave his home behind.
Harry pulled off Draco’s top, and pulled her close, lavishing her front with little bites, licks and caresses. Harry couldn’t believe how incredibly sexy he found Draco’s curves, how warm and pliable her skin was under his mouth.
It was of no benefit. Harry Potter, because he was the luckiest swine in the whole of the world, had already seen everything. Draco cursed himself for not casting a Notice-Me-Not spell, but it was too late. Draco’s cheeks burned. He’d never been so embarrassed before, not ever in his life.
The touch between them felt electric to Harry. He felt like he was seventeen again, the touch of Draco’s body driving him to distraction.
She knew exactly what kind of friendship he had with Harry. The man wouldn't introduce him to Lyra otherwise, and she seemed okay with this.
Draco, on the other hand, didn't know what he was feeling. He opened the door, looking at Harry and letting him in. His windows were covered, the blinds down, and he locked the door just as fast as he closed it.
Harry smiled widely in Draco’s direction. He’d dressed comfortably in jeans and a snug blue teeshirt, and his glasses were a little bit steamed up. Perhaps he didn’t look like the most
He kissed the sleep-mussed blond hair, and took a generous sniff of his delicious scent, thinking how much better he smelt with the warmth of his bed still next to his skin.
Five-thirty rolled around. A quick shower at home, and then he’d be arriving at Draco’s flat. He truly was more excited than he’d readily admit to.
Still, if it made Draco happy, then it was absolutely fine with him. His wife and daughter were the most important people in his world, and anything that made them smile was wonderful.
"I was furious. Said pretty damn nasty things. Father ordered me to leave. Said I wasn't his son, that I was a failure. He... He gave the company to Nott in less than 24 hours. I'm out of job, out of money and out of home. That's... That's why I'm here... I hope you don't mind me staying... I..." Draco sobbed, holding his coffee mug for dear life. "I have nowhere else to go."
, and she was now part of a vast, strange and probably very cold world where everything was unfamiliar.
Draco held his tears like a hero, but cried happy tears on Harry's shoulder as soon as they got home.
“You’re bleeding? All this upset over your period? Merlin, why ever are you so embarrassed? And you’ve let that make you sad on our bonding day?”
Secretly, though, Harry thought it all sounded like quite an adventure. He knew there was a wizarding school in Brazil.
It didn’t surprise him really. Harry loved Narcissa, and how much she had always cared for Draco. But she was a terribly standoffish lady sometimes, and everything she ate was the size of a knut.
It didn't take long. Soon, they were transferred to another room and Jasmine was put on her chest again, now cleaned and all wrapped in a green blanket, bought by Draco's mother and decorated by Molly.
Draco felt the urge to punch Harry on the arm, but he smiled to his mother, eyes locking with hers as if asking ‘please, no comments’. She seemed to understand, because she kissed him on the cheek, and did the same to Harry before sitting on the head of the table.
Draco was still high from his orgasms. Feeling so many emotions at once was too much for his mind and body, and he needed time to come back to reality. His body was limp and he was sure he could just sleep there on the floor, no problem.
But it seemed that Jasmine didn't want to sleep just yet. Draco was sitting in her rocking chair, babbling nonsense to her. Jasmine wasn't really fussy, but she seemed uncomfortable, possibly because she wasn't under the spell anymore.
Draco’s mouth was so feverish, moving at such a pace, and his cock was swelling so hefty and heavy. Every part of his body felt hot and tight and then his spunk was spilling, unfurling, filling Draco’s throat and dripping over his chin. The release was so sudden and so strong that he gasped, the aftershocks rolling through his body.
“How do you imagine it is going to be, Harry? Super tight? I guess it will. It felt tight on your fingers only... Do you imagine it will have a good taste? Do you think you can make me come with your mouth only? Or, better yet, with your
Perhaps, Harry realised, Draco would realise this week that he was in earnest, and that everything he’d said was true.
She then held Harry’s face with her hands, kissing him tenderly on his lips. A thought, buzzing and annoying, keep pressing on her brain, but she decided to let it go for a moment. She needed the warmth and tenderness of Harry now. Everything else could wait.
Sitting as she was, Harry thought Draco’s bump seemed more pronounced this morning, and he couldn’t help tickling his baby. His wife felt like satin, round and comfortable.
He’d observed the pair of them together for a few minutes, and felt his heart swell with pride and love. His beautiful flower baby Iris, and Draco, his omega who Harry knew was freer now than he’d even been before he was bonded. A contradiction, perhaps, but nevertheless true.
When he got there, he pretended to be making tea, in case someone appeared there, and waited for Harry. His heart was pounding hard, and he felt his whole body get warm. Dear God, how he missed his alpha.
omega was so wet, dripping and wet with slick. He was nearly out of his body with desire, with want. It was as if their bodies were so aligned, like Draco had been made only to fulfil Harry’s desires.
Harry didn’t want Draco to move ever again. Having the omega nested in so close to his chest felt like the most powerful luxury, and he revelled in their closeness. Draco smelt beautiful, his scent warm and rich, filling Harry’s nostrils, and sending a shiver of pure lust down his spine.
"Don't bite, you little monster, " Draco warned her, but Iris didn't really care for him. He looked up at Harry from his rocking chair, one hand holding Iris' bum and the other resting over his bump. "Ten minutes and we're good to go." Draco said. Iris already ate regular food, but she refused to stop breastfeeding. Draco figured she would when she was big enough.
“That’s absolutely fine, darling. I’ll settle you down here and wait for you in bed. Just so you know, I don’t tend to wear anything to sleep but you can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable... Call me if you need anything.”
“Well, if my princess wants a dog, who am I to argue?” Harry said decisively. “If you don’t have any further worries Draco, then I’ll book a visit.”
looked after a day in such tall heels. Levelling a dozen little kisses on Draco’s face, Harry vocalised his plans for their evening.
He felt a bit rueful about Draco’s negative feelings, and he absolutely hasn’t meant to make her feel unattractive.
“Okay, baby,” said Harry, tucking her into bed. “I’m going to tell you a story about somebody else I knew that was a puppy, just like you... When I wasn’t much bigger than you, I had a Godfather, and could
“No one else can see that, omega. It’s just for you. A little mark just to remind you of our time together.”
Draco moaned louder than he thought he would. His virgin body, unused to that type of intimate touch, was terribly sensitive. He closed his eyes, overwhelmed by the sensation, and held on for dear life on Harry's shoulders.
Pulling away, he moved onto the Draco’s cunt, teasing his lips with his teeth, enjoying how wet and aroused Draco already was at his simple touches.
Harry didn’t quite know what the score was with Draco today, but he certainly wasn’t going to do any complaining.
“Harry, I want loads of this cheese so we can eat it at home. Ask their price,” she nudged him on the ribs.
"You... Hnn... You can check wherever you want, alpha... You treated me so well... I'm sure I'm all clean... but maybe you should check there a little more..."
Harry looked at his loved one. This was more than Draco had ever said before. He was startled at the strength of his feelings at that moment.
Harry wriggled Draco onto his lap and tucked his husband’s legs around him, so the smaller man was sat on his lap. He kissed his husband solidly and warmly, enjoying their closeness and the heat of the fire lapping their bodies.
He took off his top, sighing with the feeling of having his breasts free at least, but being a little upset with the sensitivity of them. He put on one of Harry's team tees, that they had received from one of their sponsors, and it was big enough to reach his mid-thigh. Draco then marched to the kitchen to have some toast with honey, and after he assembled his toasts practically swimming on honey, he looked at the pickles bottle.
, who the hell says these type of things to their husband?” Draco reasoned, hugging Harry back even if he was embarrassed. He thought about Harry's words, still ashamed, but feeling calmer with Harry's reassurance.
They reached the park and Harry open the gate for Draco. They walked along in silence, enjoying the dull sunshine on their backs and the overhanging canopy of trees. Harry linked their fingers and the walked over to the lake.
The public kisses were a surprise as well. Draco was publicly shy and reserved. Just who was this beautiful blond man who said they were married? Harry needed to know what was going on because he was starting to feel very naughty indeed...
was something special. Harry needed to keep his head though, and not presume about Draco’s need. He’d thought his lover was innocent previously, but the sight in front of him proved otherwise. Harry slicked up a third finger, and rubbed it along Draco’s slick, dripping entrance. He was able to push it in easily.
“Promises, Potter. When will you learn to act before you talk?” Draco teased, a smile on his lips. He held himself on Harry's shoulders and didn't wait for him. He just impaled himself on Harry's cock, biting his lower lip to control the moan that wanted to get out from his throat.
Fucking hell, Draco tasted good, his slick tasting like honey and as viscous as oil. His tongue was everywhere, and Harry couldn’t get enough. He sucked and kissed, paying particular attention to Draco’s cock and cunt.
Draco was still shocked about the whole encounter. So shocked she didn't notice the people gathering around them, and two aurors approaching them.
Shaking his head Harry slicked up a second finger and rubbed at Draco’s pink, furled entrance. “You’re immense. Look at you. You’re taking my fingers so well. Okay... Draco, this’ll  stretch you open a little bit more-“
“Firstly, I have to be honest, Draco. I’m of the opinion that cooking isn’t something you’re good or bad at. It’s just something to learn, and I’ll teach you what I know... And as for the rest of it, love, I absolutely and completely agree with you. In the home that I grew up in, there was so much anti-omega prejudice. Any kind of public speech, or trail blazing omega was called unnatural by my awful uncle. All I want is a relationship where I can look after a person, help them to be the best version of themselves possible. Show them they’re loved.”
Biting his lip, Harry wondered if Draco has any idea about how attractive he looked. Harry was well endowed, but he didn’t think that Draco would have any problem taking him fully. That might never happen, but surely fantasies were okay? He decided to play a little bit of role play with Draco.
Then, so quickly he might have apparated, Draco was in front of him, gripping his arms, and pulling Harry into a bone crushing hug. It was almost more than he could process, but Harry just held on for dear life.
"But how would you introduce me as? Your friend? Your boss? Your... Your boyfriend?" This last word Draco whispered, unsure if he could say it out loud.
He was surprised by Harry's question. He blinked, trying to remember what he was thinking so he could answer.
Draco wasn't really interested in the comedy, but Harry's proximity and scent calmed him. He hid his face on Harry's neck and scented him, trying to have as much of Harry's scent as possible on him.
Harry sighed, stroking the side of Draco’s smooth, chiselled features. “But me? I’m not the most exciting man, love. I read, walk and spend time with my daughter. It’s a quiet life, but it’s good. Really, you say you want to know more, but truly all you’ll find out is that I’m not worthy of you... Draco, you’re like a shining star. I’m blinded by you.”
“Would you like to come and lay here in my arms... I’m not asking you to do anything erotic... I know it’s dangerous for Jim, I just want us to be close. You can tell me what you’d like to do tomorrow before the Quidditch match.”
As soon as Harry was out of the bathroom, Draco took his shower. He took care of his hair, and dried himself with the soft towels of the hotel. Going to the bedroom, he changed into muggle clothes, even though he felt uncomfortable in them. He wanted to match the Italians and he didn't want to show off, so he put on some black trousers and a light blue shirt. He braided his hair and put on some lip balm, because... Why not? He knew he didn't want to have dry lips as he went on with his day.
"Hello, Potter. You're early, I see. Good to know some of our employees are punctual," Draco smiled, as if he was daring Harry to say something inappropriate.
Grabbing Draco by the hands, he placed the ends of his fingers on his dark brown nipples, onto the solid muscle of his hard chest.
Draco couldn't help but feel excited about it. He missed Harry so much this week, because of his self-imposed distance. It was needed, they were getting to clingy at work, and Draco hated the gossip, especially because of how crude they were.
“Look at you, so perfect,” Harry murmured, getting into the bathtub behind Draco, and filling his hands with the omega’s fragrant shampoo. “I want to take care of you, let me, please.” He massaged his hands through Draco’s silky soft strands, enjoying the other man’s rich scent mixed with the citrus smell of the shampoo. Taking a cup, Harry slowly washed the soap from his beloved’s hair.
“I want you to close your eyes tightly Draco,” he asked quietly, “and imagine that I’m getting ready to fuck you. Don’t worry, we’re just playing, but I really want you to try and picture it in your head.”
His heart sank. Out of 30 days in that month, his period has chosen that day to arrive. He washed in denial, but he couldn't anymore when he had to stick a pad on his underwear, a beautiful piece of white lace he bought for that day, including his top. He didn't like to use tops for his breasts, because he didn't like the restraining feeling, but those were cute, and he couldn't just not wear it.
Draco found many acceptable - and terribly expensive clothes. Dresses, loads of dresses, flowery and coloured, many she wanted because they had a nice flow and would be beautiful over her baby bump.
His legs spreaded the most he could, and he grabbed his thighs to leave them open just for Harry. He could feel his body gushing out pleasure; he could feel it burning and the orgasm sensation building.
Honestly, he was being quite ridiculous, but Draco’s words ran like a mantra through his head the whole drive home.
"I love you, too. You've made me so happy, Harry, you have no idea. I know I'm an emotional mess right now, and it will take me a while to come back to the brat I know I am," Draco's voice was hoarse, but slowly coming to his assured boss tone. He smiled a little as he said that, biting on his bottom lip before continuing. "But, if given the choice to come back in time, I think I'd do it all over again."
Draco opened his eyes, his heart suddenly drumming against his ribs. As Harry talked to him, Draco moved his head, looking at Harry with a panicked look on his face.
“I... I feel embarrassed to tell you why,” he confessed, his voice so low and small he was afraid Harry didn't hear him. “I just... I don't want you to be disgusted and... I know
“You’re so fantastic... So sexy”, Harry whispered, his heart racing and body shaking as he held Draco close, their bodies almost one.
Draco thanked the waiter as he placed the plates on the table and wished them 'bon appetit'. He thought for a moment, and answered.
Thank you so much for all you guys that have been here! I'd like to remember, again, that this story came from a roleplay. I'm trying my best to correct any plot holes and mistakes, but something might slip. Thank you for your patience, all!
And no, I’ve not got a row of omegas waiting for me... I’d love to show you some things, as long as we can keep our working lives and our professional lives separate?
Just in time, streams of come flexed from the end of his cock, pouring onto Draco’s stomach and chest, and his member grew and widened, his knot hot and red. He leant close to Draco, his heart
Time had passed and Harry had been so consumed by his conversation with Draco that they’d arrived at the Ollivander offices without his noticing.
He stroked the jaw of his husband, and tilted his head forward, finding his lips for a slow, warm kiss. His slid his arms around Draco’s shoulders and pulled him close.
Harry thought she was as just beautiful, tall and elegant as her son. She’d been massively encouraging of their relationship when Harry had felt too shy to seize happiness for himself.
And really, this was far too submissive for any alpha, and by rights, Harry should be moving in to dominate... But this was wonderful, like a dream made real.
“I... I fell the same about you, Harry... You are my everything... My love, my friend, my family... I can't imagine not having you with me every day of my life... Hn...”
Ginny and Blaise were having a baby, and had told Lyra- and now Harry. A new brother for his daughter, and further evidence that families were for everybody except Harry. He’d been polite and pleased of course, but inside he didn’t know how to feel.
"Also, if you talked to him about it, it would sound that you both are fighting to claim me. It's a situation I'd like to avoid," specially because, of course Harry was bigger, but Nott was younger and he didn't want to give Nott the change to claim him by force against other alpha. No, Draco loved to have his own choice in it, thank you very much.
When he woke up in the morning, he did the usual. Woke up, brushed his teeth and combed his hair, before taking a shower. As soon as he took his pants off, however, he could only see blood.
Harry was gratified by Draco’s response to the meal. He loved to see his wife enjoying herself, eating her fill and feeding their baby.
He smiled, though, when he saw Harry's message. He took all of his clothes off as he run his bath, and decided to take this time to pamper himself a little. He put his hair up in a bun, and lowered himself into the water, that had many bath salts and oils.
Draco closed his eyes, letting Harry do whatever he liked with him. His body was already hot and wanting, even though he knew he was too sore for another round. He'd let Harry have his way with him anytime, and Draco knew he was going to be willing to do anything Harry wanted.
“I think I'd die if I never had a baby,” Draco whispered, hugging himself harder. “I love you and I know I'll be happy forever with you. But I feel... I feel like I need this. I've always had a family but... I think I need it just as much as you.”
But Harry didn’t hesitate. It was like another wizard had taken control of his body, his muscle memory reacting to the threat to his family. Without even thinking, Harry seized hold of his wand, and he fired off a
“Thank you, my darling,” he murmured, cupping Draco’s face in his hands and kissing him softly, delicately. “Every day you make me happier than I could ever have dreamed... The happiest man on Earth.  And with this new baby our adventure is only just beginning.”
Switching on the water, Harry let the water run through his hair and down his back. He sighed, enjoying the heat sooth his aching muscles. He hadn’t wanted to say those words to Draco. He wanted a baby more than anything, but not at the expense of his husband’s health. It was going to be a difficult conversation.
It was a freeing sensation. His whole body needed it, and he wasn't ashamed of doing it. Not anymore. He wanted it, needed it even. He was holding the base of Harry's cock with one hand where his mouth couldn't reach, moving in a steady rhythm. He let go for a moment, his hand still moving, and looked up at Harry.
When Draco was standing there, side by side with Harry, he forgot all about what happened that morning. Because his heart had only space for happiness.
Harry stood, and looked down at Draco. “There’s nothing more that I’d like than to take you home with me. I’d like to sweep you up into my arms, kiss you like you deserve. But you’ll never let me.”
Soon Draco found they loved goats. There were goats walking around, free, as if they owned the place. There were many goat related foods, the men called themselves 'goats' and the kids were 'little goats'. The lack of monkeys was a little surprising, too.
“What's wrong with me? Do you want me to make a list?” Draco raised her face, looking directly at Harry. “I just asked for me to tell me. Tell your fucking wife that you want her to go because you need time. Tell me you don't want to rip my baby out my arms
“You'll turn into a puppy any time from now and you'll have to eat on the floor!” Draco said, holding Jasmine on his arms. Draco was wearing shorts and a tee as the day was hot. He had foregone a bra, and although his breasts were still more sensitive than before, he was used to it by now.
In private Harry was a man possessed, for with every meeting his weakness for Draco’s touch was deepening, and his appetite for his body increasing. Their first touch had opened the floodgates within him, and he was driven to wank himself to the point of agony, Draco’s name on his lips as he came.
Oliver grinned. The daft git had known Harry since he’d been just a little kid of just eleven, and Harry knew he couldn’t hold a grudge for long against him. He was pretty annoyed that Wood hadn’t said anything before though.
For Harry, raised by Muggles, it seemed fantastical that Draco might carry their baby, that new life might be created from a small spark of magic.
“I want to see you all marked in public... I want everybody to know you're mine... Fuck... Harry, take my clothes off too... “
Draco smiled at his phone, rereading Harry's message over and over. He missed Lyra, too, especially because he wanted to be part of her life. Draco bit his bottom lip, trying to think of what to reply.
Lyra was such an amazing kid. As Harry went to buy their food, they kept talking, and talking she did. Draco was happy to listen, the way she talked about her favourite ice-creams and her mummy and her daddy. Draco wished to be part of this little girl's life as much as they were. He wanted it so badly.
Surprised at how little Draco weighed, Harry helped him to the bedroom, taking his arm and doing his best to support the man he so truly loved.
He’d decided to grow a beard at his wife’s insistence (and he’d  got a little tired of her pointing out every piece of facial hair ever printed in the bloody Quibbler) and as Harry kisses her, he made sure to tease her terribly by rubbing his chin all over her cheeks.
Even so, the sight of Draco’s tightly muscled back, the globes of his perfect arse and the sight of his lovely red arse clasping his cock were beautiful to behold, and he found himself pushing forward, slowly so he didn’t cause his husband undue pain.
Surprisingly, he hadn’t imagined the omega would feel the same as him. He’d hoped, perhaps, but knowing was different. He felt the alpha in him rise up, felt every fibre of his being want to protect Draco from these parents of his. How could anyone in their right mind imagine a healthy, gorgeous young man like his omega would deny himself. It didn’t bear thinking about.
It made Draco's blood boil. He knew he was being irresponsible, being completely drugged on his heat and the marvellous feeling of being in love with someone. But now that his heat was over, and he had his mind in the head above his neck, he needed to do
Harry looked up from his paperwork. His assistant of over six years, Susan Bones, stood in his doorway, an unreadable expression on her face.
"Stop with this non-sense right now, Draco! You'll marry whoever we say you will! You're an omega, I'm an alpha, and you do as I say!" He could see a vein pop on his father's head, and Draco knew he already lost everything, so why not stick his fingers into the wound?
Harry leant over to kiss his daughters head. “Lyra, Draco might have plans for this evening. It’s rude to pressure people, even if you do want them to come.” Harry winked at Draco, really pleased that the two most important people in his life were getting on so well.
Bloody hell, Harry thought, Draco felt amazing as she swallowed his thick length right down. His cock was hot, and wet and she was doing some wicked things with her tongue that was making the bottom of his stomach tingle, and his thighs shudder. He knew he wouldn’t last long.
Harry was incredibly shocked to hear these words come out of Draco’s mouth. He felt guilty, too because he’d been so hard just moments before. He didn’t want anything to compromise Draco’s principles, and he didn’t want to pressure him.
He took his lead from Draco and licked the back of the omega’s ears, enjoying the way his scent subtly changed when they were stimulated. Harry didn’t think he’d ever smelt anything so erotic. It was such a
as was Harry’s typical style. Malfoy would marry some rich, powerful alpha, and Harry just had to accept that.
Draco smiled brightly as she saw Harry, and inclined her head so he could kiss her. She was becoming happier and less tired by the clock, and having Harry at her side was a gigantic plus.
, that much was obvious. Her face was white, and her mouth was open, but not one sound was emerging. Her fist was fixed on Jasmine, her knuckles were white and she was shaking.
A pungent perfume smell reached Draco’s nose as he exited the lift on his floor. He picked up the pace, curiosity fueling him as he practically ran to his door. Outside of his flat, every single bouquet purchased from his shop had been arranged in a beautiful display. Draco gasped and dropped his keys in shock. A figure appeared from behind some of the flowers and handed Draco his keys with a smile. Emerald eyes flashed with joy as Draco’s eyes widened in shock.
Harry enjoyed the embrace with Draco, and pulled his skinny body tight across his skin. He could tell that Draco still felt upset about his family, and that wasn’t something that could be cured overnight. It’d take time for hurt hearts to heal, but if there were babies involved in their future Harry wasn’t in any doubt that Draco’s family would surely want to get involved. It wasn’t as if either of them would ever be happy without each other in their life. The bond was very powerful, rushing through their blood and wrapped around their hearts.
Harry bit his lip, focussed entirely on the sweet little arsehole in front of him. His fingers were thick, and wide, so he wandlessly summoned the lube. Slicking up his finger, he cautiously rubbed the beautifully soft little hole, entering just a fingertip.
Harry lathered up his hands, stroking them down Draco’s arms and all over his front. He took his time, tracing circles all over his husband’s skin, wanting to show him how much he was desired. He ran shampoo through the stands of Draco’s hair, carefully cleaning away the evidence of their earlier activities.
The two of them had never been so close. Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body. His green eyes flashed with amusement and his plush lips were so close that Draco could easily have closed the space between them, and stolen the kiss he had wanted for so long.
correct. Cameras covered every surface of their office, and were he to give Theo the punch he deserved then he would be the one at fault.
“Was that as wonderful for you as it was for me?” Harry whispered into Draco’s shell-like ear, “because that was simply exquisite.”
Jasmine didn’t deserve to carry any of the ghosts of the past with her; she deserved a fresh start and a chance to live her own life, free of the shackles that both her parents wore.
As he waited for the reply, he decided to look around social media for Harry. He found him pretty easily under the name
Harry had found Draco’s blithe confidence attractive and this was a bold move. Omegas that made the first move were often classed as fast and controversial in their staid, old fashioned city. Draco was certainly trusting Harry, and he wasn’t going to let him down. He felt his cock stir a little as he typed his reply.
Draco did just what Harry told him to. They ate as they made plans of how to organise Draco's belongings in the house, considering if they had to sell a few things so they could buy a few more storage for Draco, and how they'd tell Lyra.
The chocolate was rich and bitter where Draco had placed it in his mouth, and Draco’s tongue was flickering, moving delicately and relentlessly against his own. Quite honestly, Harry was afraid to even move a muscle, so intent was he on enjoying everything. Screwing his eyes shut, Harry determined to let Draco continue his slow journey down his body.
. Draco has been nearly alpha in his presentation, confident and powerful in his space. These submissive little omegas were all very cute, but Draco was like no other omega he’d ever met. Harry stroked his heavy, half-hard cock absentmindedly as he watched Sunday night television, not focussed whatsoever on the programme.
“I would like to be thoroughly fucked by you the whole night and morning, but this little worm is too fragile to allow it. But it's entirely my fault so I can't hold it against Jim,” Draco took off her sandals and laid down between Harry's arms, feeling so, so tired.
They had the whole rest of the day to themselves, as they didn’t have training until the next day. Harry had already decided what he wanted to do, and wondered if he could convince Draco to join him in the pool, which looked gorgeously cool in the mid-day heat.
Draco moaned with that touch, feeling his body get hot almost immediately. It seemed like his words have made his husband explode with want, and that turned Draco on... Knowing that he had this power over Harry.
“My hips are a little marked, too... I like that it was you who did it. It doesn't hurt much, really. You are too careful with me. You know, Hermione once punched me in the nose and I've been attacked by that monstrous animal once and I'm mostly unscattered. I've only been mentally hurt by those things,” Draco, as ever the drama queen, pouted. “But you? Oh, I remember how pleasant was the sound of your nose breaking under my boots... poor little fragile Potter.” He laughed, just teasing, massaging Harry's legs with his hands.
But inside Harry felt like his heart had shattered. He would never, ever have admitted it to Draco, but that was what was missing in his life.
Draco was typing a very important e-mail that he had to answer the day before, but just couldn't since he had four meetings and many other reports to write. He was responsible for the efficiency of the company, as his father and mother would only visit once a week to see if their omega son was still "up to the company's level".
?” Draco asked, his mouth red from their kisses. “I... Maybe if it's here... Under the shower... Maybe we can do it...”
“Your cunt will be exquisite. It was built to bare a baby, it is the most wonderful gift you could have been given... I promise you, however you are made, we’ll fuck beautifully, and you’ll take all I can give you.... I promise on our wedding night, you’ll be surprised at the joy your body can bring you...”
“The little worm does look like a big headed oaf at the moment, but I wouldn't have married you if you hadn't had your charms. I truly think you have the most amazing set of eyes and eyebrows.”
Draco closed his eyes, focusing on the slide of Harry's cock, the way it was too big inside him, the way it hurt so good. He could feel himself getting even wetter, his body so close to that amazing feeling again. He touched his cock a little harder, and he felt it coming out of nowhere.
this kid! You do not deserve to have any child, imagine Harry Potter's child, you trash! Give her to me, I'll be a way better mother than you'll ever pretend to be!”
Draco might have said 'yes', but Harry's mouth on him made his brain black out. He moaned loud, spreading his legs as far they would go, his hands grasping the restrains tightly so he'd have something to support himself. He wasn't as sensitive as the day before, because he was expecting it now, but he was soon close to coming.
Draco showered and put on new hospital clothes, all the time scowling at how horrible they were, and walked slowly again to her bed. She had to use pads because it looks like her body decided to bleed all the cycles she didn't have while pregnant, and it sucked. Merlin, why pregnancy couldn't be easier?
He got out of the app and saw Harry's message saying he had arrived. He went down and got into the car, his face trained not to show the sadness on his eyes.
For a long moment Harry simply couldn’t speak. That was one of the most intense orgasms he could remember and he could hardly get his breath. Pulling Draco from his knees, Harry held her close, stroking her head and kissing her cheek.
Harry was surprised by Draco’s sudden change in attitude. He thought he’d understood what the omega wanted, what Draco wanted from Harry.
He screamed when Harry sucked hard, holding his head against his chest, moving his hips over Harry's lap. Every time he moved, his slick cunt would slide over his cock, wetting the underside of Harry's thick length.
But he’d promised Draco he wouldn’t sexualise the situation. Harry wanted Draco to understand that what he was offering was love; he didn’t want to own Draco, Harry just wanted Draco to feel happiness and so far his beloved seemed more filled with joy than he’d ever seen him.
“You’re looking so hot today that I couldn’t be long even if I wanted to be... And of course I make all my decisions with my cock, it’s served me well so far... Got me married to you, for one.”
“I'll miss here when we go back to England,” he said, drinking some of his water and letting a little bit fall by his chin. He didn't make a move to wipe it.  “It's so sad to think we are coming back tomorrow night. And we didn't even properly fuck on that bed. I kept imagining us doing it, you know? You pounding on me so hard we'd wake up the next door's neighbours and they'd scream at us, but then we wouldn't care because we'd be coming so hard.”
Draco moaned with Harry's mouth on him, his whole body trembling with the pleasure of being sucked. He didn't know much about food play, but he was in the process of understanding if he liked it or not.
Harry couldn’t remember a time he’d felt this satisfied, this sated, and he couldn’t wait till they were able to try again. “You’re a gorgeous lover so expect to be just as sticky and gross next time. Too beautiful to resist, sweetheart.”
“Why, thank you” Harry murmured, kissing Draco everywhere he could reach, slowly and sensually. “You’re rather sexy yourself, and now I’ve got you all back to myself, I’m going to take you upstairs, and let you feel my beard in all your most sensitive places...”
“Oh look,” he sneered to Creevey, another alpha who worked at the firm. “It’s Potter. Looks like him and Draco have had a lover’s tiff, that’ll be the reason the prissy omega is so pissed off. What’s the problem, Draco too sore after taking your knot too many times?”
Draco moaned, and laughed a little, taking Harry's hand out of his nipple. They were too sensitive now.
With Harry's words, Draco felt his cheeks burning. He was sure he turned red, but he couldn't help but get turned on too. It was a little bizarre being turned on by the idea of having Harry's baby, but he was, and he couldn't help it at all. His cunt got wet immediately as he listened to it.
He imagined Potter would be smart and responsible, since he was now in a leadership position. He would have to impose himself. Yes, he was probably smaller than this alpha, but he was his superior. He waited for the lift, breathing in and out evenly not to show how nervous he was. He hated the first informal meeting.
Draco kept his eyes closed, trying to breathe properly once again. He let his legs fall down to the floor again, his chest going up and down. He was sticky, sweating and dirty. He was having mixed feelings, now that his mind was getting clearer. He wasn't supposed to do that... But at the same time, he wanted it
Harry took Draco at her word and sent a patronus to her mother. Narcissa, Harry knew would be beyond joyful at the birth of a granddaughter; a little flower to lavish love and care upon. Jasmine would be the most loved and adored of babies.
Olivia Moretti was a petit omega, even smaller than Draco. She had her hair up in a serious bun, her neck hidden by a high neck shirt. She always looked at Draco with admiration, and Draco envied her for having a husband and a baby.
“I... I'm really not understanding what you mean. We can not rush or 'unrush' having a baby, Harry. It happens when it happens. I know I
And those knickers. God’s, it felt like Draco had reached into his brain and found his most secret fantasy.
"Yess, Harry! Prep my arse to have you, please... Make me loose enough to have all of your cock inside me... I want to ride you, I want to feel your knot inside of me... Please, Harry, give it to me..."
"I'm sorry, I don't want to look like a needy omega, but your smell is really good. I don't have much experience with this kind of things, but... You made me want to try it out. You know.... Try
Harry listened to every poisonous word this small-minded arse has dreamt up, thinking him more pathetic with every sentence.
Draco couldn't stop his smile as Lyra went and hugged him like they've known each other forever. His smile was broad as she got apart from him, looking immediately at his sandals.
Harry let himself out, feeling antagonised and annoyed, and hornier that he ought to be. He toyed with the idea of going to a club, a slick, blond omega dancing for him feeling very appealing right about them...
Minutes later, Harry was at Draco’s door, full of anticipation and excitement over having the younger man in his arms once more. He already felt half-hard with excitement with Draco’s simple scent, and he shouted out to warn his lover he’d arrived.
Nott wasn’t half the annoyance he’d been a few years before. He’d fallen deeply in love with Pansy - whose professionalism had helped Harry slot straight in at the top-  and spend most of his time starry eyed at her desk. It was quite funny really, because she made him absolutely lick her shoes and he seemed to enjoy it.
“Honey, do you need something?” A woman, definitely taller than Draco asked, a nice and gentle look in her eyes.
“I can't wait for it, Harry. Not only the wedding night, but the wedding itself. You made me come just to think about it. I'll try to sleep now. I have to have my beauty sleep. I love you.”
Harry imagined how he’d slowly remove that shirt and find all of Draco’s scent glands hidden all over his body; how he’d enjoy Draco sat in his lap while he hand-fed the omega.
Harry had his cock in his hand in moments, ungainly and huge in his hands. It was already red and wet with pre-come, his knot swollen and tender already. In only a few stokes he felt the tingling warmth of his orgasm, and the release of the moment flooded through his body.
Draco looked up from his papers, breathing in that amazing scent that only one person had. He smiled, grabbing his hair almost delicately and putting it over one of his shoulders, showing off his pale neck.
He squinted at the shapes, aware that they were Draco’s reproductive system, but he was intensely aware there was nothing he could say to support his husband, especially as Draco sucked in his breath.
Harry made short work of pulling off both Draco’s jeans and his own. He was already so hard that his cock was struggling to stay in the confines of his boxer shorts, his pre-come staining them dark with his excitement.
But just so you know, a full relationship, and everything that would entail is out of the question for me. You know about my child? Well, I’ve sworn I have to put her first while she’s still small. No boyfriends or partners, omega or otherwise. So if you want to keep things simple, this could work.
It was completely different. Before their marriage, Draco would never feel confident enough to get in the shower with Harry and give him head. He'd have the thoughts, yes. The desire, lust even. But not the courage to go and do it. Now, he felt like he was being freed from his own boundaries, things that he imposed to himself. And more and more, he wanted it all. Maybe it was his hormones, but every time he remembered Harry's thick cock, he'd imagine it splitting him open, thrusting all the way in his tight cunt.
“I'm sorry, Harry... It's just... I never felt this way before. My body was... It was too much for today... But it was amazing... Thank you, love... You were incredible.”
“What day is it?” Draco asked, and before Harry could answer, he jumped out of the sofa, looking for his wand and summoning their calendar from the office.
Harry wasn’t one of these alphas that made judgements about omegas. Tried never to wonder why they weren’t at home raising a family. He tried not to be the arsehole alpha stereotype but sometimes the odd thought slipped through, unbidden.
The sensation was just too big. Even though they had played many times, touched and he had felt Harry's mouth before on his body, it wasn't even near the sensation he was having now. His whole body tingled and shivered, and he couldn't make his eyes open. It was as if the feeling was too big and he couldn't have other sensation such as vision on the way.
Bonding with Draco has been the best decision that Harry had ever made. Their lives together were a triumph over all those people who’d thought they’d never work, or that Draco couldn’t ever manage life as a traditional omega. He did, every single day, and was a perfect partner and parent.
Pushing him against the bed, Harry felt agitated and needy. His cock felt hard against his hip and he jerked Draco’s body into position to frot his cock against his leg. All the time Harry was kissing a line down Draco’s jaw, and his hands desperately clawed at his husband’s pyjama’s top, trying to pull it open.
Harry shook himself. Draco Malfoy was out of his league, and even if they had something, Mr. Malfoy senior would put the brakes on.
“And of course I’d love you to meet Lyra. She’s incredible. Cheeky and forthright. A bit like you really. She meets everyone that I care about. She’s with her mum most of the time, my ex Ginny, but we have a good relationship. You’ll get twenty questions Draco, though.”
Harry’s cock was hard and dripping and he was ready. Ready to take Draco and make him his own. Lining his cock up with Draco’s cunt, he took a deep, uneven breath. It was utterly, absolutely the right moment and he was so ready for this...
Harry hushed his voice as his toast arrived, and Draco’s omelette. “But a night out in London sounds super. What do you suggest?”
They found a spot that was close to the cricket ground, and after they’d settled down, Harry gave out sandwiches, drinks and fruit to all his family.
Draco couldn't help the smile on his face. Yes! Finally, Nott was suffering what he owed, losing contracts already. He couldn't help but be happy with the alpha's predicament, and he hoped his father noticed the mistake he made by the end of the week.
“Where's Jasmine? Where's she, Harry?” She stood up, anxiously looking for her baby, her heart going up to her throat. She then saw her baby in her basket, and breathed out finally, her hands shaking. “Fuck. I thought I had dropped her. Dear Merlin.”
Draco saw him go and sighed, wishing he could be with her. Then she decided to stare at her daughter for the whole time she fed. Then, when they took her off, she wanted more yet, so they gave her the other breast so she could go on.
Harry writhed and moaned in enjoyment, Draco’s clever hands and mouth making him feel like he could absolutely fly. For a man who had professed to Harry he was sexually inexperienced, Draco was extremely good with his tongue.
! But if you’re feeling wary, and obviously I can’t be around all the time, maybe we should get an animal to protect us. You must have had hunting dogs at the Manor when you were growing up?”
He could feel her bump, soft and round underneath her clothes, pushing against his own tummy and it sent a thrill though his whole body.
Luckily, Harry’s Quidditch training had kicked in, and he’d got between Draco and the slippery floor. Holding on to his husband tightly, Harry couldn’t help laughing at their wonderful wedding night. Only seconds before, the feeling of his husbands sweet wet cunt hugging his fingers as they’d orgasmed together had made every previous sexual experience seem tame, every previous moment just a preview before he could get his mouth round Draco’s cock once more.
Draco was so petite and beautiful, and Harry wanted to look after him forever. “I stick around because of
do you part. It’s more than a marriage, this bond. But then, of course I’d still like to marry you.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel anxious when he looked at Draco’s sleeping form. The omega was obviously at the very end of his tether, and wasn’t far away from really making himself quite poorly. Draco’s body had utterly shut down on him that evening, and he while he looked calm asleep, Harry knew that there was turmoil beneath the skin.
They started to show the results of the first week. As they showed it, Draco started to help them come up with actions to fix problems or to make improvements even better. At some point, Draco addressed Harry.
Harry knew he was clutching Draco hard enough to leave bruises but he didn’t care. He lined up his thick, heavy cock ready to push inside, his slit leaking pre-come as he did so, slick all around with Draco’s juices.
“Yes... You need to take care of me and spoil me,” she whispered, feeling the space between her legs get wetter and warmer.
The sensation of being complete was suddenly bigger than the pain. Maybe it was the bond mark and the sensations ti caused, but Draco was, indeed, ready. The pain slowly started to diminish as he rocked little by little over Harry.
There’d been a small part of Harry that refused to believe it was true - that he could never be this lucky - but the truth could no longer be denied.
“Goodness, Draco! You lived in a great big bloody stately home when you were growing up! You must have had animals. I promise, I’ve talked to our friends, and they all say this is the
The next day found Harry and Lyra sat in the cafe. She was incredibly excited, and wriggled around in her seat, waiting to meet her daddy’s new friend.
Harry felt entirely beguiled by Draco. Everything he did, the confidence he was demonstrating was such a surprise. He loved this new self-assurance, wanted to pleasure him and make him come so hard.
have babies, but it is so, so rare, and people don’t expect it.... And you have waist-long hair... And you’re petite, you have very fine features. You wear feminine style clothes sometimes, like that green top. But that’s you, and I’ve always loved you just as you are. From our very first meeting when we met again, you’ve been my everything. And... I’m not sure what else to say. You’ve never been any different. You shouldn’t feel bad for being yourself”
He moved his own head, touching his lips to Harry's and holding on his tee shirt, opening his mouth, giving permission so Harry could explore it.
“Should we drink a toast to our beautiful daughter?”, he asked smiling widely, and feeling lucky to be at her side.
He missed Draco’s comforting presence terribly, though, and every cell in his body yearned for his loved one’s company. Many times he picked up his phone, and unconsciously began to tap out a message. It would have been too easy though, to have broken and spoken to him, and he had to admit he was very tempted.
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said, pressing a final kiss on Draco’s forehead. “You have as much time as you need. If you want to share a future with me, then we’ve got all the time in the world. I don’t mind waiting. As long as you need.” Harry took Draco by the hand. “I’ll make a family with you, give you a baby.”
Harry held his husbands chin and pulled him into another, deeper kiss. He reasoned if they weren’t going to have sex, then some petting might not go amiss... Slipping his hands under Draco’s shirt, he dug in the ends of his fingers into the soft flesh he found there, pinching him slightly.
Draco breathed in deeply, relieved that Harry had gone so fast, but he was smiling. He never thought he'd feel this way about anyone, and here he was, dreaming about a man who left his bedroom. Looking around, Draco noticed that Potter had forgotten his clothes all around the floor, and moved to pick them up, shoving them in the bottom of his bag so no one would see them.
Slowly, she tried to move onto him like he moved on her, as if he was inside her. She needed it like she needed to breath. If at least she was brave enough to ask him for everything...
“Sweetheart, you look so wonderful, and you’re taking my fingers so well.” Harry gasped, his own cock aching, hard and confined in his trousers. He wanted, needed Draco so much and  knew that he had to have some relief.
“Oh, Merlin, Harry...! Ah! I'm going... Already, I'm going to... “ he bit his bottom lip, hard, and came, his body trembling from head to toe with the intensity of it.
Draco was an absolute hurricane that day. He was pissed, and pissed Draco wasn't a good Draco. His employees were obviously unhappy with that, and poor Olivia almost cried. When he entered Harry's office, his eyes were pure metal: gray and cold.
Harry was so surprised at just how different everything looked; the fruit, the bread and the different street food that looked entirely different to anything he’d ever tried before.
It was such a simple, warm, family Instagram. He saw photos of Harry and his friends, all around his own age. Lots of pictures were of him, this guy with the user
First though, he needed to open Draco up for his manhood. He pushed Draco’s legs back into his beloved’s hand, and leant over to roughly kiss the omega’s sweet pink arsehole.
He was slowly getting used to the stretch, and as Harry moved little by little, he could feel sparks of pleasure, slowly taking his body.
“Warn me, would you?” Draco complained with a hoarse voice, his cheeks burning with pleasure and embarrassment. “You want... You want... From there? But... But... Does it feel good? I mean... Harry! This is not meant for sex!”
“I’m going upstairs now,” Harry said quietly, “and I’ll wait in your bedroom. Wait a couple of minutes and make some sort of excuse.”
His heart ached with a love that he couldn’t mention to any other person in the world. Especially not Draco.
He could feel his husbands gorgeous little cock sticking up just for him, and as the tell-tale burning in the base of his belly started to build, Harry grabbed at the end of his cock. He arched his back, pulling away from Draco’s embrace. Grinding the head of his prick against that of his husband, Harry found himself losing all control.
“Sorry we’re a touch late,” Harry said, turning a touch red. “We got a little bit held up getting here”.
Harry was all over Draco, crowding him, hands cupping and squeezing Draco’s breasts. They felt exquisite, satiny soft and flawless under his fingers.
That morning, Draco was feeling weird. He was excited to see Harry, but also a bit nervous. Things were a little frail when they left the night before, but Draco felt on the clouds. He experienced marvellous things the day before, and he felt, somehow, more grown up because of that. He put on black leather trousers, tight on his body and a black jumper over his regular black bra. He foregone a blazer today, but he put on his best black heels.
She walked into the shower, the water wetting her hair as she kneeled in front of Harry.  Mutely, she just opened her mouth and showed her throat, silently begging for Harry to stick his cock on her mouth.
Harry pulled Draco’s hand down onto the front of his shorts, his massive, solid cock both obvious and ready for sex.
After the others had showed their results, Draco said his goodbyes and thank yous, sending all of them to the snack area, where some snacks would be served. As he was turning off his laptop and TV, he noticed someone behind him.
Draco didn't mean to nap, but his eyes closed before he could say anything. When he opened his eyes about half an hour later, Iris was already dressed and playing with Harry on their bed. Draco was sitting on his rocking chair, and he smiled sleepily at the sight of his alpha and baby playing. They were the best decision Draco has ever made.
He regretfully pulled on a robe, and made for the door. “I’m going to go back to my room, get a shower and look as respectful as I can while I’m doing it.” Harry opened the door, and in a moment he was gone.
Without any further ado, Harry picked up Draco and easily carried his lithe, smooth little body back into the bathroom, placing him carefully back in water. Harry shrugged off his shirt, and dropped his trousers to the floor. “I’ve always fantasied about pleasuring a lover in as big a bath tub as you’ve got... Will you let me pleasure you?”
“I don't really know... It was mostly sex talk, if I'm being honest... I like the way we both get when we get on like this, with this type of words, but... I'm not on any contraceptives and I don't plan on taking potions or wearing muggle rubbers. If it happens, it happens. I don't mind. Do you?”
Harry led Draco and his baby down the stairs when Iris finished her feed. Draco was beautiful, his full globe of a tummy demonstrating to the world his bonded, fertile status. He helped him on with his shoes and set up Iris’s pushchair.
Draco couldn't help it. He was emotionally fragile, and he was living through so many emotions at that time, that he couldn't avoid his bottom lip from trembling, his eyes watering and the sobs from coming through his throat.
He loved alpha/alpha romances. He couldn't help but read all of those he could touch. He knew he was weird because of it, but the regular alpha loved omega/omega porn, so what's really weird about it?
“Hunting dogs? Harry, we are wizards. We have wands. We don't need hunting dogs,” Draco raised her head, putting her hands on his waist, her eyes still red, but dry.
Harry kissed a delicate line down the side of Draco’s face, dismayed at his red eyes and the thin bloodshot veins that showed his exhaustion. “Let’s go and lay down, love. I think you need to try and sleep... I’m frightened you’re going to collapse.”
Harry was surprised how much he wanted this, the fifteen minutes feeling like fifty when he wasn’t sure if Draco was coming.
Life in Wizarding London settled into a pleasant and enjoyable routine for Harry in the month after his return from Venice.
Harry continued to rub his hard prick against Draco’s gorgeous cock all the way through the omega’s orgasm. The friction, the heat was just electric and Harry pushed Draco hard, knowing the man could take it. Harry could hear all of Draco’s words, hear him exclaiming how much he wanted Harry to fuck him. It was so hot, so bloody thrilling, and yes:
He smiled, and ran his fingers up and down the soles of Draco’s feet. This really was a treat (Draco was usually quite ticklish and precious about her feet) so Harry wasn’t about to refuse.
“Harry, you're so big... I'm so full of you...” She whispered, starting to ride him, holding Harry by his shoulders and going up and down.
Draco melted against Harry, because he couldn't help it. He just loved his husband so much he wanted to be near him and touch him whenever he could.
certain foods. The process was slow, and although she was healed from birth-giving, every time she looked at the mirror thinking 'it could be better', or 'maybe just a little more'. Her breasts were still too sensitive for heavy exercise, but she could see her changes happening before her eyes.
“There's nothing around here, Harry,” Draco whispered, standing up. Her cheeks were already turning pink because of the heat. The sky was bright blue, not a single cloud in sight. She turned around. Beside her, there was a small square. There was a little statue of Christ the Redeemer on a podium, and a blue board with a globe and some words on the side. Draco puller her wand, casting a semi-permanent translating spell over her and Harry. Her eyes shifted a little, a very unpleasant sensation, before settling. Now, she could read ‘Square of the Middle of the World’ beside the globe on the board.
Harry woke before Draco. Looking down at him, he thought how sexy it would be to wake him with a blow job. Maybe tomorrow. Today Draco would have to be content with a massage. Sipping his hand under the t-shirt, Harry spread his fingers. He wanted Draco to feel fantastic.
“I think, Draco, that this room is rather too fancy for me. Too neat. What do you say, shall we mess it up a touch?”
Harry finished off his sandwich and drained the rest of his coffee, collecting the plate and taking it to the sink to wash. “You were saying about a shower?”
For the moment, he’d just stay with his family, this wonderful gift, this joy that he never, ever thought he’d deserve and receive.
First things first, though. Before he went to work on Draco’s breasts, he wanted to remove those knickers with his mouth.
Draco sobbed, harder, the image dissipating when he covered his face and started to cry into his hands. It was a baby! He was
Harry pushed Draco back into the bed, roughly pushing his legs apart. Harry licked a clear strip down the sides of Draco’s vaginal channel.
“Harry, I need to come back now. Are you really fine?” he lightly touched Harry's leg, the one he had fixed in the game.
“Sweetheart, that all sounds so beautiful.  You’ve thought of everything. Kind, beautiful... I’m a lucky man... The Black Estate it is then. I’ll leave all the other preparations in your capable hands”.
Harry blinked twice. Despite his renown as the most famous short-sighted wizard to have ever lived, he was quite aware that things right before his eyes were not quite as he was used to...
Harry stroked the soft curves of Draco’s breasts under his hands. He couldn’t believe that this perfectly formed, entirely beautiful individual would sell himself as short as he was doing.
Harry pushed Draco always off gently, and hurriedly opened the buttons on his shirt, and throwing that and the tie onto the floor. He wanted all the sensations, and pulled Draco’s hand up toward his nipples. “Be rough with them,” he asked, “I really want to feel it.”
Finally closing the kid, he went to the sofa. Hopefully, Harry would finish his bath soon and they'd cuddle while Draco felt amazing with his warm lover and delicious food.
"I wish we could just be, you know? Sit in a place with a bottle of fizzy drink and just talk. No fancy dinners or long walks," Draco said, and then looked at Harry, a bit hurt. "Don't do that again, please. What you did with the waiter. I know what you're trying to do and I appreciate your feeling, but it makes me look like a reactionary omega, which I am not, and do not wish to be. This place is way too expensive and all the people here have ways to tell my family what's happening with me. Trust me on this one, love. You don't know how terribly cruel my world can be."
"Amazing. They've made Nott their heir," Draco laughed between tears. Pansy's caress on his hair didn't help anymore. He had lost everything. "Can you help me grab my things at my flat?" He asked her, and she kissed his forehead.
"Hnn... Harry! It feels... It feels... It feels weird, but so good... I can feel you inside me... Can you please move? Move inside me, alpha..."
was part of both he and Draco. He hoped that the whole world would be accepting of their family, just as their close social circle were.
"Yes, more like you'd be sitting behind a computer all day analysing our numbers and telling us what should we do to make our profits hit higher marks, generally speaking."
trying to have a crafty wank! It’s not my fault that you had to come stomping in here like some great oaf and ruin it completely! I’ll have you know that your filthy boxers were on my bed. It’s enough to make any sane wizard go spare!”
“Oh, Harry, fuck...!” Draco was so aroused, and so ashamed of being so. His cheeks were almost red, but he was completely wet inside his shorts, just from the thought... For some reason, Harry guessed his third secret already, telling him he'd lick his milk, and Draco felt like he was going to die from pleasure.
Draco dressed casually, skinny blue jeans and a soft, silky white shirt. He wore silver sandals, because he was feeling pretty delicate that day and wanted to show it.
He’d nearly taken himself to the edge before she’d walked in, and the pleasure was starting to roll though his body, and down his spine in waves.
Draco held onto Harry fiercely, hiding his face on his chest and crying, crying until his voice got hoarse and his eyes sting. He didn't know what to do with his life now, and he really didn't want to make a decision.
Draco’s breasts were small, but to Harry they were just perfect. Round and pert, Harry cupped them in his hand, loving their weight and smoothness next to skin. He intended to enjoy this intimate moment, and wanted to take his time.
“Take... Take care with Jim... They're between us...” she warned, but her eyes were closed, lost in the feeling.
Harry fed Draco some rice on a cracker and finished off the rest for himself. He hooked a careful finger underneath Draco’s chin and leant over to kiss him. “Very beautiful,” Harry said, smiling. “But your lips are still too cold. I think you’re a little bit in shock.”
“I know what it looks like... The lateness, sore breasts. Feeling sick... But I don’t want you to get your hopes up.”
Harry held him tight, enjoying the softness of his ripening cunt, the hardness of his cock and how ready, and full of want both were.
Draco felt his cheeks get warm. His hand was tingling where Potter touched, and his heart raced a bit.
The very thought of Harry’s hirsute physique made Draco’s cheeks flame. He’d been taught modesty, but it was very clear that Harry lacked that virtue entirely. The wild-haired wizard could often be found lounging on the covers of his bed wearing only the skimpiest pair of burgundy boxer shorts. When he got out of the shower, he walked to his bed entirely starkers, his manhood dangling there for Draco’s viewing pleasure. Harry was obnoxious. Harry was sexy. This whole dorm sharing malarky was a complete and utter disaster.
"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Potter," he said, his voice sounding a little too submissive for his liking before he turned, open the door, closed it behind him and left as fast as he could to his office.
Draco almost howled in pleasure, both of his hands on his chest now, squeezing, giving him a pleasure he'd never dreamed of feeling. It was just all too much. Too much of everything. He opened his legs even more, his body arching over the bed.
“I can't wait to have her all to myself, no spells and no parents or relatives,” Draco whispered to Harry.
Harry shifted Draco’s feet onto his knees and took them both in his hands. They were incredibly slim and white, with long toes and pedicured toenails: basically the entirely opposite of his own, which a lifetime of quidditch had utterly ruined.
He leant in, not caring that his clothes were getting soaked, drinking in the scent of the skinny omega in his arms. Their kiss was searingly hot, all lips, mouth and clattering teeth, and Harry found himself getting more heated as the seconds passed.
“I’m really fine... I wish you didn’t have to go. It’d be wonderful to wake up next to you, fix breakfast together... but I suppose we’ve got all our lives for that...”
The world around Harry seemed to disappear; to fade away so that it truly didn’t matter anymore. Even Lyra, sitting there shocked into silence by Harry’s actions didn’t register on his emotions. He knew that when Draco walked out of the door, he was going into an uncertain future.
“So... You were saying something about choosing clothes for me? Wouldn’t want anyone to imagine you looking like this, flushed, panting and covered in my come...” Harry traced for his wand. It’d have to be a cleaning spell, were they to have any hope of making their appointment.
He looked around. The sun was up for a long time, as it seemed, and he was alone in bed. He sat up, raising his hand and touching the bond mark on his neck. It felt sore and raw, but also so good. If he closed his eyes, he could
But right now he was pleasuring his husband, and nothing was a bigger thrill than that. Every part of his body ached with want, for the release his body was craving. Harry stroked Draco’s precious arsehole, slowly pushing in the tip of one finger.
Jasmine was once again put on Draco's chest, and she didn't mind the screaming at all if she could have her baby to her again. This time, her eyes were open, and they were a dark shade of bluish green. The mediwitches said it was normal for a baby to have their eyes change colours after a couple of months, and Jasmine eyes could get either lighter or darker when she grow up. After Jasmine was fed and put in her little bed-crib, sleeping soundly, it was time for Draco to eat as well. The room was an expensive one at The Mungo's, so the breakfast was good, although it was somehow limited because it was a hospital and they had to feed you bland food. She put the tray aside and checked on Jasmine, that was once again under the yellow diagnose spell, and walked slowly to the bathroom so she could shower.
Draco smiled at Harry's retort, but didn't say anything in return due to his other co-workers arriving. He carefully put his hair back on place, hiding his neck once again so the alphas on the team wouldn't be looking at him with fake modesty. He always knew when people were looking at his neck. 'My eyes are up here' was a phrase he constantly said on his head.
Their dynamics didn't change much except, after every person in the wizarding world knew about the pregnancy, they couldn't go grocery shopping without a horde of reporters popping from every direction. Draco was happy that everybody knew that he was carrying Harry's baby, but he was constantly annoyed by the reporters and the mean people that sent them howlers telling that Draco was using love potions on Harry.
Taking in the city was a revelation for him; Harry was sure he had never seen anything quite as grand in his life. The ancient buildings and churches radiated old magic and he immediately felt this week would be one of the most important of his life.
“We should wash ourselves. I'm sticky and gross. You... You certainly can come a lot,” Draco teased, a tired smile on his lips. He was really happy. He felt his hips complaining because of the pressure, his legs and his cunt, but it all seemed worthy of everything. He'd do it again immediately if he had the energy to do so.
"Harry..." Draco mumbled, smiling softly to him and smelling his alpha closer to his mark. "Good morning alpha..."
Draco had perfect breasts; he’d have no issues feeding a baby naturally were he to birth one. Some male omegas struggled to feed their babies, to have good milk flow, but Harry sensed that Draco would find lactation relatively easy.
He drove his hips forward, thrusting with all his might as Draco flooded their joined bodies with his delicious slick. He was bearing down, bucking deeply into the other man when he came, an explosion of heat and wetness that had him groaning. It felt like an out of body experience, but Harry knew it was all too real.
Harry walked out, afraid to say anything else. He decided to make his own way home, and text Draco when he arrived.
Harry walked Draco over to the bed, kissing his lips and nuzzling his neck as they walked over. All the time he kept up a litany, explaining how sexy Draco was, and how desirable he was in every way.
Even though he was worried, that comment still made Harry smile. “If you want to run the country, then I doubt anything could stop you, baby.”
Draco would be waiting for him, a vessel to receive Harry's ejaculate, his body thrumming both with archaic fertility magic and potent anxiety.
“Come on, Harry! It’s not for long. Just a fortnight! And think of how it’ll bond the team for the new season. Brazil! We’ll win the cup on the back of the trip for sure!... And it’s not like witches don’t have babies there. They’ll have a hospital... It’ll cheer her up, a bit of travelling.”
with him. His body, his mind, his soul. Everything was Harry. As he felt Harry's body pounding against his, his slick dripping down his legs, Draco came,
At first, she felt bad. Harry wouldn't need to wank if she was good to have sex like she usually was... But then, there was Jim, and she couldn't just ignore the life of her baby because she was feeling hot.
Pushing her back against the settee, Harry pushed his hands up Draco’s tee shirt. Her breasts were getting bigger, curvier at the sides and heavier in his hands. They were still soft thought, and the nipples, when Harry slipped them into his mouth tasted delicious, like honey and Draco’s soft sweet scent.
Draco moaned at the touch, having to hold on to Harry's shoulder so he wouldn't fall down. He never felt this before, and it seemed like his whole body was about to explode.
Draco was nervous, but he still explained everything to Harry. He would have a job, a good money, and would be able to work at home. It was more than perfect. It was everything he'd ever wanted.
Staring out into the star stippled night, Harry speculated how Draco would be feeling as midnight approached. His husband had been full of trepidation when they'd last laid eyes on each other.
Draco realised his suitcases were still downstairs, so he dressed on the clothes he was wearing the night before, thinking he'd change after he had some coffee and some food in his stomach.
He was losing confidence. He didn't notice when his own body slipped a little, as if he was trying to be smaller. He wanted to snare, say a few bad words, but the truth was that Draco was embarrassed.
“Alright,” Harry agreed, his voice seemingly loud in the silence of Draco’s bedroom, with the only other sound their joint, heated breath. “But I’m going to work on you slowly. You feel so amazing, Draco.”
"I don't have a family, Harry. I have owners. And they'll either sell me to someone equally wealthy or throw me in the trash. There's no in between. There's no choice. Unless you want a poor, useless omega living on your sofa for the rest of your life. Because that's the only option for me, if I ever say no to my parents. Would you be willing to do so?'
alpha that had ever lived but Harry wasn’t sure he cared. Draco was here, under his roof and wearing his mark. It was his every dream come true and he didn’t think that he could be any happier than he was there and then. Behind him the kettle boiled and he poured out two coffees.
Disentangling their bodies, Harry got to his feet. This was their last Venetian night, and he wanted to make Draco feel perfect. Harry picked up Draco easily, and carried him to the bathroom. Their bath was immense, deep and just the right way to round off a honeymoon.
In fact, the dark haired man had loitered outside Harry’s office the previous evening, and giving Harry what he imagined was a warning.
The lace enhanced his curves and all at once Harry was desperate to feel it trapped between their skin. He felt so lustful, so turned on... Pulling the other man to him, Harry revelled in the softness of Draco’s breasts under the lace.
“Well, don’t mess things up with him,” Lyra warned darkly, sounding older than her years. “Anyone can see you’re meant for each other! But dad, sometimes what we think is very normal is not for other people! Tell him your feelings and think of his feelings, okay? Like mum says: use
Draco looked up at Harry and just smiled at that. Little did Harry know, Draco would absolutely love a baby who looked just like him. She let it pass, though. They had all the time in the world now.
Harry couldn’t resist the sight of Draco, and he let his hands fall casually against the other man’s arm. Even though the touch was light, and terribly casual, it made Harry shiver. There was so much they needed to say to each other, and this wasn’t the time or the place.
took over Draco's body. It was just too good, too marvellous. He embraced Harry by his shoulders, finding his mouth and kissing him while the pounding on his body got faster.
Bloody hell, Draco informed him weeks in advance what he was getting for his birthday. There was no way on Merlin’s green earth he could keep this under wraps.
“I want you... I want you to fuck me in the arse. I want you to fuck me raw, to pin me on the mattress and leave me destroyed.”
“We could've been together, but you took my baby and sent me away after someone said I should've given her to the Ministry. You were doing exactly what she said you should do. Forgive me for not being kind to you right now.”
“Please, Harry,” Draco repeated, his voice louder this time. He rolled his hips, beseeching. “Please, love. Please, fuck me.”
“You kinky bastard, begging me to fuck you in the arse on your green Slytherin bed. And you say I think with my cock...” Harry started to pull his clothes on, hastily casting cleaning spells as he went.
Harry slipped a hand onto Draco’s thigh, his fingers edging ever higher towards his husband’s hips. If Draco wanted to play games, Harry was certainly game. He just hoped he would be able to control how far he took things....
with me... Anything you want. Alpha, you can tie me up, and down, and all around... If you kiss me here again," Draco touched his own petit breasts, his nipples dark pink from Harry's touch. "And here." his hands came down to the middle of his legs, touching his hard cock over the lace.
This CEO smelt fantastic, Harry thought as the omega moved closer to his desk. Warm, and sweet and so delicious, like a mixture of treacle and syrup... Christ! Harry needed to nip this one in the bud
There was nobody in the world that he’d rather be stood next to, in a bustling market place in Brazil.
“I love you so much”, he began, smiling. “But did you mean that about having another baby? Jasmine is still so small... And you’re still breastfeeding? Was it just the sex talking?”
"I don't fear the wrath of my parents. I fear the consequences of it. I'll lose everything I know, Harry.
Their car pulled up to the security guard at the gate, and they both showed their identification. They were just making their way to the office when a jovial old man flung open the door and ran towards them.
Harry knew he was using Draco like a rag doll, but in the heat of the moment he couldn’t help himself. It had been so long since they’d fucked and he felt like his self-control was deserting his body. He was bouncing Draco off his cock, using her hips for leverage, throwing her about like she weighted next to nothing.
"So... You're smart, handsome, hot and also a good cook...? I might have to keep you, Mr Potter," Draco teased, finding Harry and raising his arms, begging for a hug and kiss.
“Not yet,” Harry replied as they were led to their table. “Ginny send me a message a few moments ago to say they’re running a few minutes late. But they’ll be here soon.”
Harry pushed down the blankets and set to work on Draco’s breasts. They were perfect; flushed and swollen in his mouth. They were pebbled and wide, and they filled his mouth adorably. He nipped, and bit, and sucked hard, knowing that they’d be sensitive against Draco’s shirts for
The wizard had trained himself in both apothecary and Muggle horticulture so Draco paid his employees to learn the same. Both disciplines were necessary to create amazing bouquets that were both safe and beautiful. Draco had an owl system as well as a phone with which to take orders. One morning, Draco was in the back office, working on bookkeeping, when he heard the chime of the Firecall. Knowing his apprentice would answer, Draco worked until he found a good stopping point before going to assist with putting together the new order. His apprentice was currently taking muggle horticulture classes, so Draco needed to ensure that he didn't agree to make a bouquet that would eat each other or otherwise have a negative reaction.
game shouldn’t take much preparation... We’ll have time to explore, see some sights... A last adventure before the baby.”
Harry looked at Draco’s back, waiting for his touch. He really was perfect; marble white skin, soft and flawless.
"Alpha... Alpha... " he moaned, completely lost in pleasure. He let the animal take over, and all he wanted now was to be filled... Forever.
Maybe that was why this obsession with Malfoy seemed to have developed. The scent of the man, his long white neck... It seemed like every second thought had been of the omega all weekend. He’d searched for blonds on his favourite porn sites (the only ones that didn’t use synthetic drugs to put omegas into heat - he boycotted those on principle) but somehow the omegas on those sites weren’t
! Mum’s being totally boring about the foods we’re all allowed to eat. How are you? I want to see Draco again, and go out for dinner! I miss his face!”
, silly old wives tales about soulmates predestined from birth. Harry wasn’t a fool; it wasn’t fate. It was biological. Some couples were simply, perfectly compatible.
He reached out to Draco’s sweet round belly, ripe and warm under the pyjama top his husband had taken to wearing around the house. Harry had offered to take him to buy some new, stretchy pregnancy clothes, but they hadn’t got round to it yet.
He paid the bill, and they took a taxi together back to Harry’s house. Lyra was shaky and sad, and he wrapped a blanket all around her. “You know,” Harry said, “it’s okay to feel sad. I do as well. One day I hope that Draco wants to come here and live with me, but we have to let him make up his own mind. You can’t force people.”
“Harry...! More! Please, touch me more...!” he pleaded, as he opened his legs slightly, trying to help. He raised his left leg, touching his foot on the opposite wall to prop it up and keep his legs open. He then supported his back on the wall behind him, giving room so Harry could work on him. “I... I want to feel your thick fingers inside me, Harry... Please... Touch me where I've never even touched myself...”
Draco nodded, closing his eyes, and Harry brushed a kiss across his jaw. Harry pressed against the flat plane of Draco’s stomach once more. If Merlin’s grace was only with them, then perhaps these were the first minutes of their child's existence.
He listened to him, biting his bottom lip. Of course, Harry was right, but Nott was a good employee and they've known each other for decades.
“As you look utterly beautiful, and our daughter does too, perhaps I should take a photo and send it over to Luna at the Quibbler? I’m not sending anything to that rag, the
He was secretly pleased about Draco’s reaction when he’d asked about Lucius. He’d not wanted the evil old man anywhere near his baby, but he still had to consider that Jasmine was part of the Malfoy family; what did he know about grandparents? He’d never had any, and Jasmine had little enough family as it was.
He deepened their kiss, Harry slipping his arms around Draco. This small, slight man was his whole moon and stars. He only hoped he could give him everything he deserved. But Harry wasn’t worried.
Draco was so nervous. He had never gone to a date, and he didn't know what to wear. Modern omega, traditional omega?  Well, he was in a place that people might watch him, so he decided to go full traditional. He put on a black dress, with short sleeves and a square cleavage. He put on a silver necklace with a single emerald on it, and the same heels he was wearing earlier.  His hair he put on a side braid and chapstick on his lips. He looked at himself in the mirror satisfied with what he looked like before his doorbell rang.
Harry didn’t really care that much about the Ball that evening. He decided to give Draco a while to see if he felt a bit more cheerful. Maybe he’d suggest they just got some takeout or something.
None of that mattered. All mattered was the man in his arms, and making sure he knew that he was the most beloved person in Harry’s life. If he didn’t know that, Harry knew how the poison of paranoia would grow, how he’d eventually break under the weight of feeling inadequate.
He pressed home, pushing his cock as deeply as he could without hurting his lover. Draco smelt wondrous, his musky, citrus smell intensified by his arousal, the sweet smell of his sweat making Harry impossibly hard. He was desperate to protect Draco, desperate to make this a good experience. Something he would remember for the rest of his life.
. He released his legs and embraced Harry's waist with them, pulling him closer, faster. He felt his cock impale him and screamed in pleasure, his skin sensitive, tears of pleasure falling down his eyes, his nipples hard and sensitive.
And Harry couldn’t help but be encouraged by Draco wanting to explore her gender identity. Harry loved the bright tendrils of confidence that Draco was starting to show, how she was really trying to live her best life...
Draco was truly happy that his husband wanted him so much. It was strange, for him, after many years of not having any of this type of action. They almost got caught in the Quidditch changing room, and luckily Draco was still wearing his healer robes.
She went to find Harry and he was there, in front of the moving pictures box. Draco sat at his side, and sighed.
Harry took his hand off Draco’s cock, entwining their fingers together. “Guide me”, he asked. “Show me how you’d like me to touch your beautiful tight cunt”.
He let Harry tie him, a little unsure, but as he felt that, if he tugged hard enough, the restrains would fall, he relaxed. It was just a play, and Draco felt excited to know Harry wanted him like this... Vulnerable. Because then, the alpha could take care of him.
. I've always had these thoughts in the back of my mind... Being called 'she' instead of 'he', being touched as if I was a woman, not just a weird boy with too many bits. Do you understand me?”
“And your breasts are perfect... So warm, and already full of milk to feed our baby. You’re mine, Draco, you and the baby... All that I need in the world.”
“Fuck, Harry, yes! Fuck me... Fuck me deep and hard...” Draco tried to move and make Harry's cock slip inside, but he only managed to make his finger go deeper. Draco moaned with the sensation, legs trembling. He was so wet that the insides of his thighs were glistening with his transparent pleasure.
Harry stopped the moment Draco told him to. In all of his sexual life Harry liked to let the omega dictate the pace, and he wasn’t about to change now.
that’s needs forgiveness, Draco. You forget how well I know you. You’re not selfish or cowardly, but you
Harry’s stomach twisted at the mere thought of it. His beloved had been brought up to trust in the old ways and was anxious that the ritual wouldn't work. Draco had been quiet for days, his face pinched with worry.
Draco felt complete. She truly did feel complete, as she felt every time she was like this with Harry, full of him, in his arms, with his words echoing in her head.
“Not horses, darling. I prefer cars, quite honestly. You should talk to Lyra though, she’s a big fan of ponies... She’s moaned at me for a pet horse for years... But I’ll admit, I do have some princess fantasies. I can’t imagine any princess as sexy as you though.”
Harry kissed Draco’s soft mouth. “You don’t need to promise orgasms, love. I don’t stick around because of the sex.” He caressed Draco’s cheek with the back of his hand.
Draco haven't noticed he was crying until he started to sob. Fuck, his period has ended already, it couldn't be PMS. It was just him being bloody sensitive.
“I thought we’d review the papers in the ride over,” he began, trying to act the professional. “I’m not convinced my predecessor was offering Ollivanders the best value for their fees. I think we can do.... I’m interested in their supply-chain management. I think we can get the operation really slick-“
"I'm sorry that this has happened to you, Mr Ollivander... But I don't understand why you had to call me, sir." He replied, trying to keep his tone low and calm, as expected from an omega. Ollivander was a nice man, but still very traditional.
“Harry... I want you inside me... Please let me ride you... Take off your jeans... Let me ride you while you touch me all over... I want to feel complete... Please... “
“... And I thought you were supposed to be the intellectual one in this marriage,” he laughed, pulling at a lock of Draco’s hair lightly, and snatching for the book to take a better look.
Taking a deep breath, Harry counted to five and started to speak. He made an effort to speak clearly and without a tremor in his voice, as he didn’t want Draco to know just how terrified he was feeling. He put his arm over hers, squeezing her forearm to say that he was there, and that she was loved.
Draco looked magnificent, drenched from the bath, his wet hair tangled and damp on his head. Harry’s abrupt and reckless thrusts were splashing the walls, their limbs tangled and hot.
This was one of the times that Draco wished Harry would just touch him. He was getting carried away with the kiss, and his body tingled and warmed all over. He wanted more than just a kiss, even though he wouldn't give more than just touching. He knew Harry had to hold back much more than he had, and it was pretty obvious to see his erection under his clothes as he left to get them desserts.
“Of course I can watch her, love. But you don’t have to go anywhere Draco. Just stay here, and I’ll help you. You must still be in a lot of pain.”
His childhood hadn’t involved any travelling, and since joining the Quidditch league any foreign travel was really just the inside of hotel rooms.
Only once he had Draco sat down did he even try to speak. Harry picked up a fleecy thrown blanket and wrapped it around Draco. True, Harry has certainly envisaged their evening differently, but he could tell that Draco was terribly anxious.
Draco moved tenderly against Harry, feeling his cock and, although he was tired, he liked the feel of it. Maybe he'd like the feeling of fucking even if he didn't come after it. Being connected and intimate with Harry was pleasure enough.
For real, Draco didn't want to hand Jasmine to Harry. They had been together for so long and now they were two separate people that it felt weird. She knew that Harry was her father and had to take care of her just as much as Draco, but Draco felt so...
“Harry... I was thinking...” Draco touched his back to the kitchen wall, looking up to his fiancé. “I feel like I'm putting too much pressure on you with all this waiting. And I know I can handle more than you, because I've never had sex and you... Well, what I am trying to say is that... Maybe I can help?  Giving you a little more? I'm not up to taking my pants off, but... Maybe I can use my hands? Even...” At this point his was beet red, and he swallowed saliva, feeling his pleasure pool in the middle of his legs with the mete thought. “Even my mouth?”
Harry collected his notes for the meeting, and walked towards the conference room. He was being ridiculous, but he felt like a joyous teenager. Like alpha with their first scent infatuation. He shook his head, needing to be professional.
Unfortunately, Harry knew Draco rather better than that, and he imagined that a trip to a rather expensive tailors tomorrow might be a better option.
Draco smiled at his phone when he saw Harry's message. He was indeed a very different alpha from all of those who Draco have met before. He sighed, replying:
"I wish I could marry for love, Harry. I wish I could have babies with an alpha I love. But I know my family is pampering me for the perfect alpha. Probably already chosen. And I'll live an unhappy life as my husband or wife take the reins of my beloved company and I carry cute, perfect alpha babies, or omega disappointments."
Draco gasped over his glass, looking up at her and trying to react. He was truly shocked. He blinked his eyes, breathing in before smiling while looking at the happiest couple in the world.
Draco was right, Harry really didn’t care. He loved Draco, and he didn’t care about bleeding in the slightest. But he knew his husband did, so that’s all that mattered.
Harry felt like his body was rising, like the feeling he has when he’s flying. Every cell in his body seemed to hang back, waiting for that second when there’s no going back. Suddenly he’s there, and his prick was shooting and he’s sticky, shivering and hot under the stream of water. This feels incredible, and Harry’s face is split into a wide grin. If anything, this has felt more intimate and exciting than anything else he might have imagined.
Harry’s teeth sank into Draco’s pulse point, and every cell in his alpha body felt like it was going to simultaneously explode and erupt.
"Harry... Harry, I want your knot so bad... Look, it's... it wants me, too... Give me a forth finger... give me your whole fucking hand... I know I can take you. I want you deep, deep inside me. Please, Harry... I really, really need your knot right now... I want to come again with you inside me... Make me come a third time today and fill me up to the brim with your come..."
There was nothing to it; until Draco contacted him there was nothing Harry could do. He checked and rechecked his phone obsessively, but there was absolutely nothing. Draco last words rang though his head “Let me go”.
. I never learnt how to cook, how to take a bus, how to fend for myself. And it wasn't because I am rich. No, it's because I couldn't. Such mundane things are not appropriate and also would let me survive on my own. And they can't allow that."
He admired Draco’s sleeping form for just a moment, thinking how elegant and petit her figure was, even pregnant (and also how terribly greedy her blanket thievery was each and every night).
with one hand, and even though his fingers were long, they didn't close around it. For a very small distance, but they didn't close.
"I didn't think I'd ever be able to do this with anyone. Or that I'd be able to actually have a young, hot husband who actually fucked me good." Draco smiled, snuggling close to Harry. "I hope we figure everything out, alpha. I'm... I must confess I'm scared for our future."
“Umm... You’re making me insatiable Draco... This is some of the hottest, most intimate behaviour I’ve ever shared in my life. My body feels too big for my skin, like I’m going to explode... Do you trust me enough to come in the shower with me?... I want to wash you clean, not have anything between us...”
Harry had been drawn almost unconsciously to the man, his lush long hair and his skilled, serious manner as he worked on his teammates. If he could improve only one thing, it would be have him embrace muggle technology a bit more! It’d taken weeks to get him using that phone.
Draco felt a pang on his heart, like Harry had grabbed it and squeezed it. He tried to focus on his food, but he wasn't in the mood anymore. He couldn't have a future with Harry, not if his parents could intervene.
to be touched there. His nipples were sensitive and tender, and he just couldn't wait. His left hand went between his legs, and soon he was coming, and coming, and coming.
He leant over and peppered tiny kisses all over her face and hair - knowing he was touching her with his beard and not caring - and ghosted his arms all over her sides.
He looked at Harry's body when he took off his top. He was so beautiful. Muscular because of the sport, his eyes intense, his body big and strong. Draco sighed, licking his lips and holding the hem of his own tee shirt while he walked closer to Harry.
"You are too used to break my brain, alpha. Now it's my turn," Draco said, biting his ear tenderly before leaving the bed, the toc-toc of his heals loud between their panting breathing. He grabbed one of the dessert plates, getting near Harry and putting his finger on the chocolate ganache, licking it and rolling his tongue around his finger.
"Harry, you've no idea how wet you've made me with this," Draco sent, and thought a little. He didn't know what to send. His neck was a safe thing, but what else? What was Harry attracted to? Boobs? Draco didn't have much as a female omega, but he did have nice, small perky tits. Maybe his legs? Maybe his knickers? With an idea in mind, he sat a bit better, holding the hem of his tee and pulling it up all the way until it showed just the base of his breast, not enough to show the nipple. He took a picture, showing his white, lacy knickers, his flat stomach, small waist and the base of his breast. "What do you think? Do you like it? What would you like to do?"
“Ummmm. Chocolate dessert sounds just about perfect from where I’m sat,” Harry smiled. “But I insist we take it to go. I want to enjoy my dessert with you. You’ve got me feeling very alpha tonight Draco... Maybe it was your polite little request, or maybe it’s that traditional omega dress you’ve decided to wear. What I want,”, he whispered, bringing his lips close to Draco’s ear, “is for you to spread it all over me. Make me sticky and messy, and clean me up with your tongue. It’s one of my biggest fantasies. Shall we take these desserts to go?”
“That sounds like a dream, Draco” Harry murmured, carding his fingers through Draco’s soft hair. “We’d make the most wonderful babies. Chubby and beautiful. I’d look after all of you, love. And I’d be more than proud to have you wear my scar. But
"You're still hard," Draco stated, snaking a hand between them and holding Harry's cock. It was huge, and he felt his mouth water again. "How do you want to come? Do you want me to suck you off again? Do you want to come all over my face? My chest? How do you want it?"
Anxiety coursed through his veins and he felt sick with worry. He didn’t know what Draco’s parents were doing to do to him, and what Nott had planned. The alpha was a twisted, disgusting piece of work, and Harry didn’t know if Draco’s parents were just as bad. After all, the omega had seemed terrified, shaking with worry as he had left the ice-cream parlour. The thoughts swirled around his head, and Harry paced irritatedly up and down the room. He simply couldn’t get comfortable.
omega, even if it wasn’t the title that Harry truly wanted to give to Draco. But he couldn’t let his thoughts go there...
Harry thought how it wouldn’t take much to come from this; the sight of his lover’s arsehole stretched out to take his cock was such a bloody rush; the thought of Draco’s red little lips demanding he make him come made his cock twitch involuntarily.
Harry was so excited that he could hardly walk through the door with Draco before he pushed her to the wall, kissing her passionately.
Draco had taken another route, so he missed the altercation. He was still worried though, his heart pounding. He hoped no one had seen them together. How fucking reckless he was when he asked Harry to meet so soon. The fear of being discovered made him useless the whole day, and he couldn't forget about it, so he couldn't do his job properly.
. With the position he was in, he couldn't really go away from him, but he tried, trashing his legs with the new, unexpected sensation.
He leaned over and kissed his wife pulling her close. She felt lovely, all soft curves and warm skin. Her figure was different, but no less attractive.
was why. Draco didn't know how to deal with adorable Harry all the time. Of course they had arguments, but a lot less toxic than their teenager years.  Draco swallowed hard, the idea of never having a baby hurting him deeply.
Draco tried to do what Harry had asked. Push against him and hold onto his legs for dear life, but being breeched by his huge cock wasn't a very easy task. His whole body was on fire, and although he didn't feel pain, because he was incredibly relaxed, ready and prepped, it was such a new sensation that Draco didn't even remember his own name after the first inches got into him.
“She looks so much like you,” Draco whispered, touching Harry's shoulder. “I don't quite have the energy to keep up sometimes.”
“What is it, Harry?” she asked, taking of her shoes. Her feet were sweating, and thankfully she packed some light sandals.
my appearance every day of my life,” Draco swallowed saliva, his heart beating even faster now. “And... you know, that according to my personal beliefs, I'm starting to get too old. I should've had babies like five years ago. So I'd...
“Hmmm... I'd like you to kiss me anywhere, but  first...” Draco looked for his wand on the side table and, once he grabbed it, he casted a mouth freshening spell on both of them. He put his wand aside. “Better. Now, kiss my mouth, Potter. Kiss your husband after your first night in bed with him...” Draco smiled, teasing.
“Oh, I’m sure that your 67 year old betrothed would have shown you a good time,” Harry teases. “They could have gone to sleep at eight, and you’d have been rid of them in a few years. Not me, love. I want us to be together for as long as we’re given.”
people. Here, Harry could nothing, nothing at all. He felt worse than useless in the face of his wife’s agony.
help. But I cannot help but think the department needs to take more direct action, and I propose to visit the Ollivander Industrial Works over the next few weeks. As one of our biggest clients I want to really get to grips with their accounts, and I definitely need to see those in action. It may well be several days’ travel. Do you have anything to add, Mr. Malfoy? I know your family have known the Ollivanders for several generations.”
Harry was unaccountably nervous. He hadn’t thought Draco would agree, so when he disappeared, to get himself prepared, Harry wasn’t sure what to expect. After what seemed like the longest five minutes of his life, he entered the bathroom to find his husband.
“In September we’ll be walking like this, but with our baby. I honestly still can’t believe it Draco, can’t believe it’s really happening... And you’re doing so well. I don’t know any other wizard who’d bare up as well as you... I’d be a disaster, I’m sure...”
Not bothering to wrap a towel around himself, Harry padded back through to the bathroom. He picked the luxurious lotion that Draco had been using earlier, and poured a generous amount under the running water. Walking back, his cock swinging as he walked, Harry picked up Draco, and carried him though as easily as if he weighed nothing.
- to which he asked what were his plans and Draco just hang up the phone. He had no patience to explain his life and reasons to his employees, and he'd rather work while feeling Harry's touches still lingering on his body, specially his bum, that were still a bit red from yesterday.
He looked up at Harry, big, grey eyes waiting. He knew Harry has had other lovers before him, and it made him a little nervous. What if he wasn't good enough? What if Harry didn't like his body? What if he didn't like the way he was? Draco worried his bottom lip, trying not to listen to his worries.
“You've never had your own cock all the way up your arse, have you?  I assure you I feel many things, but disappointment is not one of them,” Draco laughed a little, sidestepping Harry and going up to the stairs and into their bedroom.
," Draco mumbled as he walked back to the kitchen, a little embarrassed. He was so lost in Harry that he forgot some people had no idea of how to deal with other people. "I've got coffee." He said as he sat on the table with Harry, taking off the cups from the paper holder, giving one to Harry and one to himself.
“Okay, love,” Harry smiled, as he looked Draco in the face, wondering at just how such an innocent young man could have risen to be such a powerful figure in business. “Vaseline is absolutely fine, baby. You go and get that and I’ll be here waiting.”
That was typical of Lyra, Harry thought. She was always thinking of someone else, be it Ginny, Draco or one of the two baby sisters she’d gained in a very short space of time. Harry had been worried how she’d cope, but Lyra has just laughed.
“Healer, we will need every bit of evidence that you have in this matter. We need every single person on this floor under strict orders of silence, we will be requiring oaths.” Susan barked for him.
As the time passed, it didn't quite get easier, but Draco, at least, grew accustomed to the idea of being unable to have a child of his own. There were days in which he cried, and there were days in which he wasted his time between games researching on magical ways to get pregnant. All of them too complex for someone like him, but he knew he was smart enough to try something like that.
Worst of all, Harry had no shame. Not a spot or a jot. The Chosen One was obviously very comfortable in his body, for it seemed to be naked far more often that it was clothed. The man was an exhibitionist. A naturist.
He didn't complain about being carried like that, and moaned a little with the slightly warm water touching his skin. He watched Harry undress, and listened to his words very attentively. With Harry's question, he put a leg over the tub edge, opening his legs as one remained outside.
Harry wasn’t naive though. He knew that Draco was going into heat, and that left him vulnerable. The tone of the texts was enough to tell him that.
Draco knew he wasn't going to last. It was everything so intense that he knew it was going to be faster than normal. He held Harry's waist with his legs, and the sensation of Harry's cock pounding into him and his words made him reach the orgasm too fast.
we have to stop and not do what we want. I'm going to be very honest with you... I don't have time do have a relationship. I have a Company to lead and I can't give a husband or a family the attention they would need, but if somehow we can make this work with the limitations we have, I'm up to have everything. I'm not in it to keep controlling myself every time I'm naked with you in my bed. I wouldn't want you to control yourself either - of course, respecting the boundaries we asserted on the first night. You won't be a regret. You gave me something no one else has given me before. And I want more of that."
Harry couldn’t really believe the words that had come from Draco; he’d expected some dark, secret confession, not this simple annoyance. Not that it really mattered to Harry; he’d had sex with girls with girlfriends on their period before and hadn’t cared much.
Harry gasped with pleasure at Draco’s beautiful reaction. He ground his cock into his lover deeply, enjoying the heat and the soft, plush skin of Draco’s round arse. Harry knew it wouldn’t be long before he came; Draco just had that effect on him.
Months ago, Harry asked him about his kinks. He didn't have the courage to say them... But now... Perhaps just this one? It was innocent enough, even though it was lewd.
Pansy looked at Harry, his smell almost punching her in the face. It was a bit much strong for her tastes, but it was obviously to Draco's, because the omega had instructed her to only let Potter pass through her and no one else.
"Harry... I don't know... I..." Draco was fighting with himself. He wanted to be fucked. To be knotted. He wanted to feel all of Harry inside of him. "I want you to fuck me... But I can't break... It can't be..." Draco was becoming frustrated. He knew for a lot of omegas it was just a matter of choice. Wanting or not. For him, it was so much bigger. It was a matter of being worthy or not. And a used toy wasn't worthy. "Please... Please can I make you come, Alpha? Can I use my mouth in you? Please?" he asked, in the end. He couldn't have what he wanted, but then he'd have at least partially.
Harry took a deep drink of the coffee. “This is nice too,” he added, finishing off the cheese on toast. “You’ve really spoiled me this morning. So what’s brought all this on? This is the most traditional I’ve ever seen you behave, and you seem to be quite happy about it. Maybe if you wanted to cook we could do it together? I love cooking with a partner. It’d be a laugh. Now, shall we retire back to bed for half an hour? Not for sex; that’s not what today is all about. But I’d really like to give you a sensual massage and make you feel really good. How does that feel?”
“I’m going to fuck you now Draco,” Harry whispered, pushing his husband further forward, admiring his glistening, wet little cunt, and lining up his cock in readiness for entry.
Harry's mouth felt wonderful. He did that before, but never when Draco was so open and so needy for something inside him. Every flick of Harry's tongue was like a teaser for something bigger and better. Draco knew, he was so sure he could take him, that every cell on his body was asking why he wasn't balls deep inside him yet.
And Ron, it seemed, couldn’t stop touching Hermione, rubbing her fingers, stroking her hair... Harry could hear the excitement in her voice when she announced their “little news”.
“I've always been the Quidditch star, Potter, I just allowed you to play because you'd force yourself into it anyways and someone needed to be there to heal you. I still can beat you up in five minutes and throw you off of a broom in even less time.”
“Better than good Draco. So, so wonderful... you’re making me crave you more every time we touch... I want to share everything with you, bond you to me always...”
Harry lay awake until he knew that Draco had fallen asleep. He was a little worried, and he didn’t really know what to do about it. Sure, they’d had a lovely time in bed that night; some powerful orgasms and plenty of touching... It had been delightful. Harry couldn’t have asked for more.
“Come here, you.” Harry whispered, pulling Draco into a kiss. The omega tasted delicious, like honey, and Harry’s lips ticked and teased at Draco’s mouth. Their tongues flicked and parried with each other, a sublime push and pull that had Harry moaning embarrassingly quickly.
"A family is always excited when a baby is coming. Aren't you excited about being a big sister, too?" Draco asked, looking at her questioning. When their orders came, he began eating excitedly, thinking about the possibility of spending the night at Harry's. He's never done that before, so it was a good opportunity.
Pulling her pebbled nipples to his mouth Harry suckled on her breasts, filling his mouth easily with the sweet, mild tasting milk. The sensation sent shockwaves all though his body; simultaneously so kinky, yet so warm and intimate, Harry knew that he’d ever felt anything like this before. Draco truly was the woman of his dreams...
“Don’t be embarrassed Draco...” Harry said, examining their fingers that were knitted together between them.
“Where shall we visit today darling?” Harry asked, feeling quite enthusiastic about clothes shopping for quite possibly the first time in his life. “The wizarding or muggle shops?”
“I... I was going to tell you another secret today,” Draco started, biting his lower lip. “I was afraid of telling you because I was so sure I'd never get pregnant in my life... But... I think I'd love it if we do it while... Hm... I was going to say, while I pretend to be with your child but... I guess I don't need to pretend anymore.”
Draco tucked Harry in again, closing his zipper with a devious smile. He grabbed him by his hand and walked him to his bedroom, pushing Harry so he would sit in his bed. Draco was too aroused, but he could stop a little to set boundaries to that... thing they were having.
Harry pulled off Draco’s t-shirt in one fluid movement. Leaning over the slighter man, he trailed his fingers all over his torso. Unable to resist, he trailed kisses too, over his lover’s clavicles, and onto the roundness of his breasts.
He was in fact a little nervous, holding Harry's hand tightly, but soon they were receiving hugs and congratulations, with no need for weird explanations. His mother asked to see if he was showing yet. He wasn't, but he showed her his stomach anyways, and she cried while touching him under his navel.
Draco smiled, happy that he could proceed with the planning. He knew Mrs. Weasley wanted to play caterer and have all the food preparation on her own hands, and he didn't want to fight that. He also knew his own mum would want to decorate everything, and so he would leave it to her. The only things he and Harry had to worry about were their clothes, the guest list, sending the invitations, and... Well, showing up. They already had their best man and maid of honour, so it wasn't something to worry about.
“It's a Malfoy trait, I guess. I was three weeks earlier. I guess she wanted to beat me,” Draco said, thumb slowly caressing Jasmine's head as she held her baby's head. “And Harry, please bring my sterilised box with my hospital clothes inside. These ones I have to wear are
"I'm out with a friend," he said, and then completed "Her name is Lyra, you don't know her." He added out of fear, but Lyra beamed at him, what made him smile a little.
He lavished all the attention and adoration that the lovely omega deserved, and Harry thought he’d never seen such a beautiful, lovely individual, so well suited to all Harry’s tastes. Hard once more, Harry ground his cock against the bed, heavy and ready.
“Well, she looks just beautiful,” admired Harry, who was secretly not quite as convinced as Draco that any two-month old baby needed
"Harry... Are you really comfortable with that? Bonding with me... You know... Starting something new even when you have a daughter already? I don't want to... I don't want to fuck up things. I truly love you and I want to make you happy."
“Mnnnnn.... So now it’s you that’s the tough one?” Harry laughed at Draco’s pouty lips, kissing him on them gently “So next Saturday we’ll swop and you can be the Quidditch star? Bet those healing spells aren’t too hard either? I’m sure I’d manage...”
He knew this was something that they had to talk through, to discuss and support each other with, because Harry knew the gender identity of another person was non-negotiable.
But he was broken. He was incredibly sad because... Five months, loads of sex, and not even a scare. Not even one day late. He was starting to think he'd never have a baby, and now the universe was shoving it on his face. He wouldn't cry though. Not in front of them. They'd never know how broken he was. Maybe Harry, only. Maybe. But for now, he just wanted them to have dinner and have this day over with.
decide to come. It’s far more fun than life at home with mummy and Blaise. All they ever talk about are babies. So boring! They are having a boy, I think. Are you and daddy going to have a baby soon? I do wish you would. I wouldn’t mind that so much, because then daddy wouldn’t be lonely anymore.”
For Harry, the time wishing at the hospital was the upmost agony. He was somebody used to seizing control, used to being able to manage situations and, most crucially, used to being able to
