Harry forced his eyes back open and Draco pulled his hand away. Draco looked as tired as Harry felt. Harry moved to his own bed, getting on his hands knees on the mattress before carefully shifting onto his side, facing Draco's bed. The thought of being able to keep an eye on one another was oddly comforting.
Baby Daniel kept them busy. He started walking nice and early, and he seemed to delight in making his fathers chase after him. Tom was a calm, quiet baby. He was content to cuddle when his twin was squealing and tumbling about the house. It was Tom that had suddenly taken to calling Harry "mummy" and Daniel had joined in rather quickly. Harry would roll his eyes when Draco laughed about it, but they both knew that Harry was pleased.
"Harry..." Draco protested weakly.
Harry grinned, reaching out to shake Rita's hand.
She winked at him as their other friends came into the room with their snacks and drinks. Draco was thoughtful as the movie began to play. He was stretched out next to Harry on their giant cushion. As the love story unfolded of the telly, Draco's gaze drifted to Harry.
"Oh Merlin," Harry gasped. He grasped Draco's hips and panted as Draco lifted himself slowly before sinking back down.
Below them, Ron grinned and shook his head. "James, what are we going to do with your daddies?" he asked, smiling as the baby blinked up at him. "You're going to end up with as many siblings as I have unless those two can figure out how to keep their hands off each other."
After fifteen minutes, five dark wizards were disarmed and bound. The aurors were relatively unharmed. It just seemed to easy.
Harry and Draco looked down to see that the source of the shriek was Pansy. She was standing in the grass and watching them with awe. Next to her was Narcissa Malfoy.
“Shut up and look,” Hermione hissed, pointing across the room.
"Harry?" Draco asked apprehensively, his eyes starting to fill. "Are you not happy?"
"A few things," Hermione admitted. "You'll find that you can produce a few new sounds as their are changes to the vocal chords. I'm relieved that you're both still capable of normal speech."
"Finally coming to tell me about your fling with Weasley?" Draco asked with a smirk. To his amazement, Pansy blushed. She never blushed.
Once back in McGonagall's office, Draco turned to the headmistress expectantly. "Are there any students I should be aware of?" he asked. She handed him a list and he was pleased to see that she'd included a few students from all four houses. She'd also noted what sort of difficulty each child had. For some the issue was financial. Some were bullied. Some were neglected or abused.
"It's worth a try," Harry replied with a little shrug. "I'll try it out first."
Ron nodded, but he looked miserable.
Once the cake had been eaten, Draco sat down to open the gifts. He was stunned by the level of enthusiasm that was displayed. He opened several packages of baby socks and gender neutral rompers. There were baby blankets and teddy bears and other little toys.
Draco leaned forward eagerly. "I knew that bitch wasn't telling me something," he said. "She knows that I live for gossip right now since I can't go anywhere. So cough it up," he commanded. "Are you shagging her?"
"What could happen?" Draco asked apprehensively. He frowned as sat down, wondering how he would avoid crushing his wings.
"Can you change us back?" Draco asked anxiously.
"Yes," Harry responded, turning to face Draco with a smile. "I had a great day. And I spent it with you and our three beautiful children." He chuckled. "I can't believe you let Pansy goad you into telling her that I top."
Ron wished he could laugh about it. That would be better than the horror that clawed at his mind in that moment. He was rather glad when the second healer excused himself and left the room.
Pansy nodded sympathetically. "On a positive note, they're stunning," she said. "You look absolutely gorgeous." She turned to Harry and smiled. "Harry," she said finally. "You look amazing as well. Such lovely coloring."
Harry reached for their bottle of lubricant and opened it without breaking their fervent snogging.
Harry scowled at him. "Feel free to see yourself out," he retorted.
"I thought you'd want to rest," Harry said. "I know your back hurts."
"I don't like it," Draco said, still frowning. "You don't bargain with a baby. That's awful."
Harry struggled against the magical ropes as his head was forced back and a liquid poured into his mouth. A filthy hand clapped over his mouth, preventing him from spitting out the potion. Draco was forced to ingest a potion as well, and Harry's panicked brain noted that Draco's potion was slightly lighter in color.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked anxiously.
Harry's wings spread out wide catching the air currents, slowing Harry's decent. They flapped in foreceful but controlled movements. And then Harry was flying. It was exactly graceful, but it was definitely flight. Once he'd gotten some practice, Draco was sure that Harry would be breathtaking in the air.
The case was getting stranger by the minute. There had been reports of disturbing amounts of blood being found in various locations along with remnants of dark magic. Robed figures had been spotted, but none of them could be positively identified. There hasn't been much to go on until that morning. The aurors received a frantic message from a witch claiming that there were dark rituals being performed near her family's property. Ron and his partner Robert Grant were assigned to the case with Harry and Draco along with another pair of aurors, Parker and Davis. The others had gone off in another direction.
Blaise and Pansy arrived first, immediately commenting on how delicious aroma of the food. Pansy disappeared to call Draco down while Blaise set the table. Ron came in as Pansy called for Harry.
“I still have guests Harry,” Draco reminded him, reaching up to smooth Harry’s unruly hair down.
"What?" Draco squeaked.
Harry cupped Draco's jawline and pulled him into a soft sweet kiss. And then another. And then his tongue was brushing against Draco's.
"Not at all?" Hermione questioned, giving the couple a meaningful look.
"You are allowing the adoption?" Kingsley asked uncertainly. When she nodded through her tears, he smiled. "Let's get some paperwork started." He looked at Lucius. "If you could inform them that they need to see me when they're done here?" When Lucius agreed, Robards and Kingsley escorted Celia out.
Draco groaned, giving up on his feathers for the moment. Of course Draco's unfortunate condition would be reason for his father to throw a tantrum. And it certainly wasn't for Draco's sake.
"What the hell was that?" the other Harry said. He looked at his partner and he instantly understood. "Polyjuice," he said flatly. "In the coffee. Merlin, can't you do anything right?!"
"Harry just calm down," Hermione said, her eyes now brimming with tears.
Pansy seemed eager to expand on Blaise's comment. "At first I didn't understand what was driving Draco," she said reflectively. "He started small. Donating to charities and the like. Then he was taking gifts to sick children. Soon it was this massive part of his life." She smiled in remembrance. "I was asking him about it one day while we were in the ministry, and he caught sight of you across the atrium," she told Harry. "You were kneeling and talking to a little boy that was beyond excited to see you. After a moment, Draco looked at me and said 'He gave everything.' That's all he would say. It was, perhaps, a little dramatic but profound... I understood Draco heart a little better that day."
"We were pranked by the potion division," Harry explained. "I'm pretty sure it was Davis that slipped the potion into our coffee. They've done a great job with the new formula."
"What?" Harry asked, though Draco was staring at Blaise in growing alarm.
Ron relented with a terse nod. "What are you doing here anyway," he asked. "Enjoy getting knocked about by the little ones?"
"So long as I don't have to see or hear about them shagging," Ron said, grimacing.
"Indeed," Kingsley agreed. "Still, it pains me to see two of our best aurors suffer. While you seem to encounter the strangest problems in the field, there's no denying your worth in the department. Is there anything we can do for either of you?"
And there sat Harry Potter. Sort of.
"Let's move," Kingsley snapped running toward the house. Ron followed hastily.
Harry pulled away to gently wipe away Draco's tears. "Tell me what you want," Harry said.
"Well, your father wanted to purchase a full wardrobe," Narcissa said lightly. "But I thought it might be prudent to wait until we knew what the baby will be. Gender is a factor as well as whether or not the baby will also have wings, though I suspect that it will."
HPDM~HPDM
Ron shooed Harry away as he reached to take the bag of ingredients. "But you won't be cooking this time," Ron said firmly. "Draco is due any time now. You're going to focus on him while I do this. Besides, Pansy will be helping me," he added nonchalantly, though his reddening ears were a bit telling.
Harry nodded, giving her a final squeeze and releasing her. He glanced at Draco awkwardly and then returned to his chair. Draco slowly sat down as well, unsure of what to expect. Harry cleared his throat. "So what brings you by?" he asked Ron.
But now, Draco found himself considering. He looked away from Harry, staring absently at the telly instead. He'd been living with Harry since a few days after their release from the hospital. They were closer than Draco had ever thought possible. They never spoke of it, not really. But they relied on and trusted one another. Draco loved Harry's touch and he suddenly wondered how it would feel for those hands to do more than reassure and sooth.
"And so do I," Harry added, moving closer to stroke Maddie's hair.
Despite Ron's initial complaints, it didn't take long for him accept the new arrangement. That may have been because Pansy brought over a large basket full of Honeydukes chocolate for the first movie night.
As Harry blacked out, he was certain that he'd heard a shouted disarming spell. Ron and Grant had arrived.
"We'll be fast," Ron said, following Harry out the door.
Harry gave a sheepish little wave.
Ron smiled happily. "I'll go make my godson a bottle," he said proudly. He left the room and a moment later, they heard loud cheering from downstairs.
"It's perfect," Draco breathed.
"Bird puns," Draco muttered, glaring when Harry snorted with laughter. "Think you're clever Weasley?"
Draco watched in fascination. House elves didn't normally behave in such a way. He imagined that the behavior of this elf could only be explained by a concern for Harry's well-being. Draco looked Harry over again and winced. Clearly Harry want taking care of himself. Luckily he hasn't stopped showering.
Harry set his spoon down on his plate with a contented sigh.  “I don’t dance,” he said, looking around at the other party guests.
Draco eyed the pillow nest wistfully. "Seems a bit..." He waved his hands vaguely. "Intimate. Personal. It's your bed."
Sensing Harry's movement, Draco turned to face him. "I didn't think you'd have feelings for me," Harry said quietly.
Harry smiled.  “Of course,” he nodded.
Harry closed his eyes. He loved seeing Draco like this. He reached down and rested his hand against Draco's abdomen, stroking his thumb over the slight swell. Draco made a sound like a choked sob and kissed Harry hard. Harry's other hand moved to guide Draco's movements.
"Kinky," Blaise winked, warning a snort from Ron and an eyeroll from Hermione.
"You're sure?" Draco asked uncertainly.
The spark of amusement that flashed briefly in Harry's eyes made Draco's smile widen slightly. Harry rose from his seat but jumped a little when Kreacher popped into the room carrying a tray. Harry sighed and sat back down while the house elf poured the tea and handed them each a plate holding two scones. Harry started to politely decline the food but he relented when Kreacher glared. Kreacher didn't look satisfied until Harry took a bite of the scone.
"You think very loudly Harry," Draco commented with a fond smile. "Relax."
"So you lot didn't have a chat about me?" Harry demanded. As expected, Hermione's expression became guilty. "I should have known," he groaned. He turned to Draco. "You can go," Harry said sharply.
"Or I could arrest him," Ron suggested impatiently.
"Draco, I think you should know that..." He trailed off, looking flustered. "I have almost no experience. We were in school and then there was the war... I went on a few dates, but nothing came of it. And, I've not really... wanted to..."
"Thinking of ways to get back at Pansy?" Harry asked, rousing Draco from his thoughts. Harry's hands had dropped to Draco's hips and he was pressing their bodies together lightly.
"As if I'd tolerate anyone else," Draco responded, finally offering a little smile.
One of Harry's hands abandoned Draco's nipple in favor of slipping into Draco's opening. The fingers were wet and a bit cold. Draco hadn't even heard Harry open a bottle of lube or mutter a spell. Probably because Draco was moaning shamelessly, his fingers tangling in Harry's hair.
Ron sighed. He really wanted his best mate there, but he hated to see Harry suffer. "It's okay Harry," he said gently, patting Harry on the shoulder. "I'll come round to visit you."
Rita shifted uncomfortably. Ron's smug look was making her very tense.
Draco shuddered. He hated himself a little bit at that moment. He hated feeling week. He'd been so angry and hurt, and the lingering fear over his new condition had flooded him with sudden panic. As much as he didn't want to resort to such a thing, he'd been on his way to demand that Harry come inside.
Harry had also become more protective and perhaps a bit possessive on occasion. The day before Christmas, Pansy had kissed Draco's cheek affectionately and Harry's wings had flared out wide as he trilled loudly in warning. Pansy leapt away from Draco, watching Harry warily.
Stupid hormones.
"Muse?" Ron questioned, while Draco shot Pansy an annoyed look.
"I like to watch you," Harry responded, cleaning the plate and fork with a spell. He leaned close to kiss Draco's lips. "You look so beautiful."
After a few minutes, they released their hold and went back downstairs. Narcissa made a sound of sympathy when she saw that both young men looked tired and suspiciously glassy eyed. "Are you alright?" she asked, glancing between them.
Ron smiled as watched the two little boys together. It was hard to believe that they'd been such bitter rivals in school. Little Draco was probably quite spoilt, but he seemed to have a sweet enough disposition. Adult Draco was rather less pleasant in Ron's opinion.
Draco’s musings were interrupted when presents were passed to him and Harry.  They opened the parcels curiously, suddenly aware that everyone was watching them.  Harry made a strange high pitched sound and blushed while Draco sputtered indignantly.  These gifts were obviously from Pansy.
Draco was delighted to see Harry drifting to sleep with a soft smile on his face. He hadn't made it through the whole movie.
Draco groaned quietly as he twirled Pansy across the dance floor.  “This is a disaster,” he said quietly.  “What was I thinking?”
"I love you too," Draco replied, supressing a yawn.
"A little," Draco responded, tilting his head to look up at Harry.
The woman swiped at the tears on her face. "I just can't manage all three of you," she explained sadly. "It'll be alright."
"I have to be going," Hermione responded. "But I'll come round tomorrow." She departed with a little wave.
Harry sighed, hugging Ron tightly. "Be careful," Harry muttered. "Don't make a move until you're sure of yourself."
"Another sappy romance?" Draco asked as Hermione passed him.
Harry swallowed hard, looking down. "The potion caused horrendous pain as it changed us," he said quietly. "Our wings began to form within our bodies before they ripped their way out. There was so much blood..." He drew in a shaky breath, his eyes lifting to the door that Draco had just walked through. "Blood loss alone could have killed us. Hermione has nightmares about us bleeding out on the table."
Harry lurched forward and caught Draco in his arms. "Where's Hermione?" he demanded urgently, turning to look at his friends.
Harry pulled Draco into another kiss, too happy for words. His wings fluttered, as if expressing what his words couldn't.
"Smug bastard," Draco laughed. He snuggled close, not caring that they were both sweaty and had semen smeared on their torsos.
Harry hummed softly, considering. "I think we'd have gotten there," he said slowly. "To be honest, I was physically attracted to you before. Our transformation just made it easier to get closer to you." He kissed Draco's palm softly. "I think there's a good chance that we were always going to wind up together. That day with the polyjuice... watching you touch my body..."
"Don't be ridiculous Ron," Hermione grumbled, brushing past him and sitting on the couch. "Why would they perform a mating ritual with us in the next room?"
Narcissa smiled. "Yes they are," she agreed.
"Thank you ever so," Draco retorted sarcastically.
Harry look of dismay melted into a besotted smile. "Of course," he agreed quietly. "You deserve the best, so that's what you'll get."
Draco was all charm during the meal. He talked and laughed between between bites, seeming perfectly at ease. It made Harry wonder if being in the house with Harry so much made the blond unhappy. They were friends of course, but Draco had a life outside of Harry. Had Harry been selfishly keeping Draco to himself. He hadn't intended to.
“Don’t you dare give up now,” Pansy snapped.  “You started this and you’re going to finish it.  What have you got to lose?”
Harry smiled and began pouring cups of tea. This had been a very good idea.
And they were attracting a great number of stares. They couldn't detect any hostility, but it was still disconcerting.
"It was harmless," Draco responded with a shrug. "She was so happy to have company. Was it really so much trouble to humor her?" He chuckled when Harry sighed in resignation. "McGonagall told me that Trelawney started drinking less when I began visiting her."
"But-"
It was Christmas Eve, and Draco was terribly disappointed to see Harry curled up on his couch looking melancholy. The last few days had been encouraging. Harry had smiled a little more. He'd relaxed around Draco a little more. When they sat next to each other, he even leaned against Draco sometimes. It had filled Draco with warmth and gave him the most peculiar urge to press kisses all over Harry's face.
"Event," Draco snorted, shaking his head and rubbing his stomach. "Like it's the Triwizard Tournament."
"Nobody thinks that you're a child," Harry retorted. "Have you ever considered that I might need this too?"
"Obviously we don't drink this tea," Draco said. "We let him think that we're in the dark. Ron, let him know that we said thank you for the tea. Then let it slip that we fell a bit ill. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea... That sort of thing. He'll think his plan is working."
"I know we're sort of stuck here for now," Harry said softly. "So I thought you deserved to be romanced a bit."
Lucius cleared his throat and stood up, looking regal and somber. Narcissa's eyes followed him warily.
"Oh my..." Draco said faintly, staring at the rings. His gaze lifted to Harry's face, his gray eyes swimming with tears. "Of course," he whispered. "I'll marry you Harry."
"And the baby?" Harry asked softly.
"Absolutely," Harry chuckled. "It would have been a shame to get rid of all this. But we all agreed to accept your decision when the time came."
"I don't think I've ever been so comfortable," Draco said murmured.
"I love you too," Harry responded, closing his eyes.
Harry shuddered as he crouched behind a large dense shrub. The magic in the air was potent and wicked. Draco was kneeling, listening to the strange chanting from the group of wizards that stood around what appeared to be some sort of altar. Something creature been sacrificed on that altar. Judging from the number of bloodied feathers on the ground, it had probably been a large bird.
Draco sighed, hugging the egg close. "Uncle Ron is as stupid as your father," he said quietly.
James cheered and clapped his hands, but Scorpius looked a little perplexed. "Do you like baby Rose, Scorp?" Harry asked. He smiled when Scorpius nodded. "Well, we will have a new baby too!"
"Oh Merlin," Harry shuddered. "That was... ridiculous. And you were no help at all," he added with a scowl.
"Thank Merlin," Draco chuckled, kissing Harry's forehead.
"That would be great Love," Harry said, adding more garlic to his tomato sauce.
"No apology necessary," Narcissa replied, setting her teacup aside. "You are under a lot of strain. Your father is a fool and I will handle him." She hugged her son warmly. "Might I visit again?"
"Busy becoming a hermit" probably would have been a more accurate phrase but Draco couldn't say that. The fact that Hermione and Ron and blurted out their concerns would probably upset Harry a great deal. There was already such deep sorrow in those green eyes.
Narcissa stood gaping at them for a moment, completely stunned. She hardly knew how to process such information. "You're- You- How can this be?" she asked faintly.
Draco let out an excited squeal and tackled Harry with a hug. "Good boy Habby!" he jabbered against Harry's robes.
"You're hilarious when you're bitchy," Ron chortled. "Please tell me that you two plan to have more children. I think I prefer you pregnant," he joked.
Harry blinked in surprise. For a moment, he'd thought that he would have to explain Draco's presence and possibly disarm Ron to prevent hexes. But, there's only been mild surprise and calm acceptance. After a moment of thought, Harry scowled. "This was a set up," he snapped, glaring at Ron and Hermione, then at Draco.
"Those idiots made me a girl bird?" Draco shrieked indignantly.
Harry chuckled, carefully stretching Draco for long moments. And then Draco did beg.
Harry swiped at his sweaty brow and tugged his shirt off completely. He was beginning to feel queasy and his skin prickled unpleasantly. Something was definitely wrong.
Harry nodded hesitantly, sitting up on the couch.
Hermione smiled at Draco’s besotted expression.  She wondered if the former Slytherin even realized how he looked at Harry.  And Harry seemed unaware of the adoration being directed at him.
Ron bid his partner a good night and then apparated away. He arrived in Harry's living room and made his way to the kitchen, following the scent of garlic. He quickly found himself at wand point.
Harry smiled as he watched James and Scorpius chased their Uncle Ron across the dance floor. Neville and Hermione had gotten married that day and even the little ones were enjoying the reception. Scorpius was flapping his silvery wings ineffectively, his chubby legs not doing a good job of keeping up with his brother. Ron took pity on him and scooped the two-year old up while James laughed and asked to be picked up as well.
Draco flinched and Harry began to worry. Draco's parents had been in France for a few weeks and were due to return home that day. Draco hadn't wanted to worry them by telling them about the attack and his transformation. Harry was sure that Draco was putting off the need to face it. Clearly it hadn't gone well.
Harry pulled Draco into a sweet kiss, carefully slipping the ring box back into his pocket. He chuckled breathlessly as Draco began tugging him eagerly to their nest.
"Wings," he whispered hoarsely.
Draco watched them walk away, his stomach clenching with anxiety.  He drew in a calming breath before turning to look at Harry.  “Do you want to dance?” Draco asked.
Ron ducked as a curse zoomed toward him. It was an ominous red color and set some bushes ablaze. Scowling, Ron pressed forward, his wand slicing through the air as he cast spell after spell.
Harry set down his wand and approached Draco slowly, his heart beating frantically. He tilted his head back slightly, as Draco was a bit taller than Harry. "You could have just asked," Harry said softly, a smile spreading on his face.
"Of course," Harry nodded. "You'll be a good big brother, just like James."
Ron read over Rita's notes, his eyes going wide. Rita had managed to find the motive behind the strange rituals and attacks. These dark wizards wanted to change themselves, but had decided to test their potions and spells on others first. They had wanted to become veela.
Harry nodded absently, his eyes drawn to Draco's covered abdomen. He briefly wondered if it looked a tiny bit bigger, but he doubted that it would be wise to mention it.
Harry laughed, hugging Draco happily. Draco looked at Luna eagerly. "You're certain it's a girl?" he asked.
"What did you find? Who was it?" Draco asked anxiously.
"And I'm so very proud," Harry assured him. "You make the world a better place and I love you more than anything."
Narcissa smiled and kissed Draco's forehead. "You take care of each other, and we'll speak soon," she said. She left through the floo in a swirl of green flames.
Ron helpfully tugged the blanket aside to expose the blue shell to Draco. "Do you want it back?" he asked.
"I don't know," Draco replied. "But we're getting more stares than usual."
"Why would you not want to shag each other senseless?" Pansy hissed, glancing over her shoulder to make sure they weren't overheard.
HPDM~HPDM
Harry announced that dinner was ready just as the awkward silence was becoming unbearable. Harry made a low chirping sound that Draco returned, drawing an alarmed stare from Lucius. He glanced at Narcissa to see that she wasn't at all concerned that their son had just twittered like a common bird.
"That just means that Potter's rotten luck is to blame rather than his stupidity," Pansy grumbled. Despite her words, she reached out and stroked Harry's hair gently. "What a sweet boy," she cooed. She shifted her gaze to Draco. "Adorable."
Ron sighed softly when he heard Harry's quiet sob. "It's alright mate. Hermione is good at what she does. She'll set him right," he murmured. He maintained his firm hold until he felt Harry relax.
"Can we focus?" Draco demanded.
Harry snorted. That was his Draco.
Draco blushed and bit into a strawberry without comment.
"We had... an encounter," Harry admitted, looking thoroughly embarrassed. "Or two. But we didn't... you know."
Rita stared at the baby. "Does he have wings as well?" she asked.
"You're together now?" Blaise asked.
"She could have died," Harry whispered. "That's all I could think of. I wish I'd realized sooner."
Harry shook himself and stepped aside to allow Draco to come in. Draco offered a hesitant smile and walked into the house. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked as soon as he had closed the door.
"Oh right! Grant wanted me to bring that too you," Ron explained. "He was telling me that he feels badly you two are stuck here. He said that tea would help calm your nerves and relax you."
"Well, tone it down a bit," Draco chuckled, lifting his head to look at Harry. "I don't want my eyes to be red and puffy. Mother will make a fuss."
"With anyone," Harry admitted quietly.
"I'm boiling," Harry muttered, tossing his outer robes aside and opening a few buttons of his shirt. He glanced up to see that Draco was rolling up his shirt sleeves and casting a cooling charm. The charm was little help.
"Draco has had a difficult day," Harry said lightly. His hands stilled for a moment. He'd never actually called Draco by his first name before. They were always Potter and Malfoy, even outside of work. Well, if you were going to be preening another blokes feathers, may as well use his first name. Harry bit his lip to keep himself from laughing at that thought.
Ron smiled. "It suits you both somehow," he said.
Draco nodded, feeling a bit of tension drain out of him. It was ridiculously pleased that Harry accepted his apology without a fuss. Deciding to push his luck, he smiled. "Now will you offer me tea?"
Dessert was brought to the table and Draco was pleased by the sight of the decadent slice of chocolate cake that was placed before him. Harry hadn't ordered anything as he was feeling bizarrely nervous.
"It's fine," Hermione soothed with a hand on Ron's arm. "Malfoy has always known me as Granger."
Harry nodded leading the way into the house. He looked up to see Draco striding toward him purposefully. In the next moment, Draco was in his arms. Harry cooed, hugging Draco tightly.
Ron got to his feet and placed the egg in Draco's arms. "It's alright mate," Ron murmured. "She didn't know."
"Er..." Ron looked around for a moment and then snatched one of the bags from the floor. "Chips?" he offered hastily. He'd stopped at a deli earlier and ordered chips for Draco, using charms to keep them fresh and warm.
Hermione bit her lip, anxiety pouring from her. Harry was barely breathing. She needed her potions to work faster. The curse that had hit Harry had been devastating. It had cut him open but had also burned his tissues. Merely closing the wound wouldn't have stopped him from dying. Painfully.
Blaise and Pansy levitated Harry carefully away from the stairs before lowering him to the floor. Neville was pulling potions out of a pouch and setting them next to Hermione. Hermione immediately set to work.
"Popcorn," Ginny announced, levitating several bowls of popcorn into the room. The bowls were eagerly snagged from the air as everyone was selecting a seat.
Ron burst into a fit of laughter, his anxiety forgotten. Harry handed Draco the pumpkin juice with a wink and a grin. He loved that Ron and Draco were so accepting of each other.
Ron slowly took the egg back and moved to sit next to his mother again. He carefully shifted the blanket aside, allowing Molly to get a get look at the delicate blue shell. Ron glanced at Draco and saw that the blond had relaxed into Harry's arms.
"They're beautiful wings," Rita noted. "Will I be privileged enough to see Mr. Malfoy's as well?"
"Harry is like a son to us," Arthur said. "That makes you family," he informed Draco.
Each box contained an assortment of lubricants, some of which were flavored, edible body paint and various… toys.  “Sweet Salazar,” Draco groaned.  “I don’t even know what some of these are,” he added, poking at one of the items.  "What's this one?"
Draco immediately dropped his pretentious attitude. "You ought to let me be the judge of that," he said quietly. He stood up, feeling more determined than ever. "I need to go but are you working tomorrow?"
"James Sirius Malfoy-Potter," Draco replied, kissing the baby's forehead tenderly.
"Sorry, I-" Harry shook his head, unsure of what to say. This morning had become very strange very quickly. Despite the novelty of the situation,. Harry's heart was heavy and it had been difficult enough to maintain his current friendships. He didn't equal to the task of meeting demands of a friendship with someone like Draco. "I really wouldn't be good company for you."
Harry and Draco exchanged an anxious look. This wasn't really something that they wished to explain to the Malfoy matriarch.
"Spaghetti sound alright?" Ron asked Draco. "Or would you like something else?"
Harry shook his head at Draco’s tense expression.  “I was messing with you,” Harry chuckled lightly.
Draco turned his body slightly and rested his left hand on Harry's knee while holding his fork up to Harry's mouth, a bit of cake perched on the tines. Harry opened his mouth, allowing Draco to feed him the cake. The flavor was wonderful, but it wasn't nearly as pleasing as the affectionate expression on Draco's face.
"They're in the waiting room," Ron replied. "Nobody wants to leave until they know that Malfoy is alright. But, I had a feeling that Hermione would kick you out, so I came to sit with you."
Grant had a brother that had been killed by a veela. But it had been revenge for the man brutally raping the veela's half-veela daughter. Grant had been furious over the Ministry's lack of sympathy over his brother's death. So, he'd gathered some men that shared his disgust with the Ministry. They'd decided that they needed more power to gain control of the ministry and the Veela population. If they could change themselves to have an advantage, they'd have an easier time of it.
~~HPDM~~
Harry turned to look at him in surprise and confusion. Draco merely smiled and continued to run his fingers over Harry's lovely wings. Harry continued to peer at him for a moment before turning back to the film uncertainly.
Pansy sighed. "Alright, it's not as dramatic as that," she told Ron and Hermione. "A lot of us had to rethink things after the war. Draco was especially determined to make up for his past. Of course, we all heard that Potter had sacrificed himself to the Dark Lord to save everyone. And when the war was over, he continued to be the hero. He clearly wasn't comfortable with fame and didn't want the attention. He wanted to save people because that's who he is." Pansy looked over at Draco with a smile. "And that's what Draco wanted to be."
Ron shook his head. "I need to alert Kingsley," he said tiredly.
Draco nodded slowly, cooing when Harry nuzzled him sweetly. Feeling a little calmer, Draco rested one hand on the egg and picked his fork up with the other.
"Grant doesn't know," Ron said, nodded pointedly at Draco. "I let him think that you two decided to take a step back during the investigation. Draco was pretty rattled the last time you two were at the office, and Grant saw that. Seems like a good cover story. There's too much at stake here. I'm not going to risk three lives by taking an unnecessary risk. I trust Kingsley completely, and he vouches for Robards. Nobody else knows."
"Good things?"
Harry didn't sound suspicious. He merely sounded curious. Draco smiled. "I actually enjoy it," he said lightly. He peered at Harry for a moment. "I'd like for you to come help me tomorrow."
He turned and apparated to Hermione's office without another word. Before he could decide where to look for her, the door swung open
"Don't be silly," Hermione snapped. She waved a hand toward the door and led the way out of the shop. She cast a quick charm to ensure their privacy before she spoke again. "Harry's had a really difficult time since the war."
"Kingsley," Harry answered with a little shrug. "How do you think you managed to have your probation period shortened?"
“Indeed?” Draco asked mischievously.  “The only thing?  Might I make a suggestion?”
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” Hermione replied with a little shrug.  “Harry isn’t always particularly self-aware.  And he and Malfoy get along now.”
Pansy sighed and glanced around until she spotted Harry.  She really couldn’t be angry with Harry.  It’s not as if the whole thing was his fault.  Draco hadn’t told Harry how he felt, so Harry couldn’t be expected to know.  But, Draco had been determined to make it more than obvious to Harry at the Christmas party.  Then again, there was likely a vast difference between Draco and Harry’s definition of the word “obvious”.
Draco and Ron burst into a fit of laughter.
The wizards turned to look at Ron and Kingsley, firing spells at them, giving Draco and Harry the chance to fire off stunning spells. They let out high, shrill shrieking sounds distracting their attackers to allow Ron and Kingsley to join the fight more easily.
"I'm only joking," Ron assured him, setting the blue tin on the counter and holding his arms out. He was delighted when Draco passed the egg without hesitation. "I'll hold this little darling while you eat something."
Draco was on his feet faster than was probably advisable considering the amount of alcohol he'd consumed. "No," he snapped at his father. "This is Harry's home, and you are out of line." He pressed his palms to the table to steady himself. "We couldn't help what happened to us. It doesn't make me any less your son. And if you think that I could do better than Harry Potter, with or without wings, then you're mental. It's not a degrading by any stretch of the imagination. He's the best thing that could have happened to me."
"Would everyone like tea?" Harry offered.
"Spring is generally the start of mating season," Hermione said helpfully. "The timing was perfect for them to conceive. They just weren't consciously aware of that. Draco's altered anatomy allowed him to get pregnant."
“Pansy,” Draco said calmly, “I’m a little busy.”  He shifted slightly and Harry whimpered.
"It's definitely a girl though," Luna said, startling a chirp out of Draco with her sudden appearance. He could have sworn that she'd been on the other side of the tent.
Draco stirred and his eyes fluttered open. He offered Harry a sleepy smile, but the smile fell when he saw Harry's face. "Did you have a nightmare?" he asked.
Draco grinned. "Good girl. He'll definitely be back for more. But more than that," he said, growing serious, "I think he's looking for more than a shag. He seems to really like you."
"I love you," Harry murmured, his heart racing.
"They are grown men that were subjected to a potion," Lucius retorted. "But that egg holds a baby. Our helpless, blameless grandchild. It doesn't deserve to suffer or struggle because of its blood," he added quietly.
Harry blushed a little but shrugged it off.
"You're well known for your charitable donations as well," Narcissa informed Harry, taking a dainty sip from her cup.
"It feels different," Draco shrugged. "Very little sensitivity."
They stepped out into the hallway together and made their way toward the head auror's office. They hadn't made it very far before Ron was calling out to them. "I was watching for you two," he explained, eyeing them critically. "You both look ill."
Harry cleaned them up as soon as he'd caught his breath. He instantly began gently stroking Draco's stomach again.
Draco slowly relaxed in Harry's arms but not before catching the attention of the bride and groom. "What's wrong? What happened?" Hermione asked anxiously. She was still in her wedding gown with her hair pinned up elegantly. She looked like a princess and Draco felt awful for causing a scene at her wedding.
Harry took his time removing Draco's clothes. Draco was far less patient. He swiftly removed Harry's trousers and yanked the shirt off before kissing down Harry's chest.
Harry shook his head, gently rocking James in his arms. "At least it's over," he said quietly. "Now we can all move on." He looked up when an owl tapped at the kitchen window.
Harry waved her off with a tired smile, not wanting her to fuss over him. After a moment, she nodded and kissed his forehead, bidding the others to have a good afternoon. Pansy left soon after, apparently convinced that they wouldn't do anything life-threatening for the rest of the day. Ron returned to his own office, casting an oddly wistful look at Harry over his shoulder as he went.
The owl gave Draco a reproachful look, making Harry laugh. Harry took the newspaper from the people and slid the money into the pouch on the owl's foot. The owl flew off, leaving Draco scowling at the window.
It had been discovered quite quickly that Draco would need to eat a lot more. The egg was absorbing a shocking amount of nutrients, presumably to be able to sustain the baby until it was time to hatch. As a result, Draco ate much more frequently in addition to nutrient potions. Harry was amazed by everything that Draco consumed each day, but he'd rather hex himself than ever comment on it in Draco's presence. Harry liked his bits where they were, thank you very much.
"With what?"Harry asked warily.
Draco sat next to her on the bed, still cradling Daniel against his chest as he met Maddie's eyes. "Of course I do," he assured her.
"Get on the bed before I fall on you," Harry panted, biting his lip as Draco slowly pulled off. Harry kissed him swiftly before urging the blond into the altered pillow nest.
"No need to apologize," Draco insisted. He watched as Harry yawned and put his head back down. Smirking, Draco pulled Harry up and turned him around, chuckling when Harry pressed his face to Draco's shoulder. Draco pulled out his wand and cast a charm to make Harry lighter. Then he scooped Harry up without a word of warning.
"This is wonderful," Draco said, assured him.
“High praise indeed,” Draco commented drily.  At a nudge from Harry, Draco relented.  “Thank you Weasley.”
"You've nothing to be sorry for," Draco assured him, wrapping one arm around Harry.
"Sorry to interrupt," Ron said. "We didn't know you too were having lunch."
Hermione peered at him, as if expecting another bout of hysteria. When she seemed assured of Harry's composure she went on. "Our examination revealed the development of an egg," she explained. "The problem is, your body and magic are adapting to a process that human males aren't capable of. And human embryos take much longer to develop the bird embryos."
"Er... Is this some sort of mating ritual?"
Pansy rolled her eyes, but smiled indulgently. "I wonder if you'd settle a bet for Blaise and I," she said casually.
"And I loved it!" Draco hissed viciously, his gaze triumphant as his father paled.
"Just tell me."
"I told you she's a whore," Draco commented, while Harry laughed.
"Ms. Parkinson," Kingsley growled. "Calm yourself."
Hermione chuckled. "So dramatic," she remarked fondly. "You've got to grow and allow room for the egg to get bigger. I'll give you some cream to prevent stretch marks. And you look fantastic. Your skin has this glow to it. Once, Harry's more confident that you're perfectly healthy, he won't be able to keep his hands off of you," she added with a wink. She caught sight of Draco's brief hopeful smile and it tugged at her heart.
"Now," Draco nodded. "Right here in the street."
Draco smiled and tilted his head back to kiss Harry lovingly. It had been a year since they'd become a family while sitting on a hospital bed at St. Mungo's. The official adoption had occurred several weeks later, but their hearts had opened up overflowed with love for those children in that moment. For Harry and Draco, that was the day they had become parents. It hadn't mattered that their relationship was new. The love they felt was real and so right.
Harry pulled Draco into a hug. "I'm so excited," Harry said, pressing little kisses all over Draco's face.
"Not a happy thought," Harry mused. He carefully withdrew his fingers and moved to lean over Draco. "I haven't been with any one for nearly a year. And nobody has meant even half as much to me as you do." He pressed a sweet kiss to Draco's forehead before bringing their lips together.
Harry turned his head to face Draco, tilting his head hopefully. Draco obliged him with a deep kiss, his hips and hands never faltering.
"Yesterday you said whatever I need," Harry reminded him. Draco's answering smile made Harry's heart flutter.
“You’re trying to woo Harry Potter, the ultimate Gryffindor,” Pansy snorted.  “Dignity has nothing to do with it.”  She sighed when Draco gave her a pleading look.  “He enjoyed his dessert.  And you enjoyed him enjoying his dessert,” she added with a mischievous grin.
Narcissa eyed the woman. "This was intentional," Narcissa said, looking impressed. "You brought those babies in here to prompt my son into action."
"We got the shock of our lives," Hermione said quietly. "I believe they were having so much pain from the growth of the wings. When they finally tore through the skin..." She trailed off, closing her eyes tightly. "It was horrible. The feathers sprouted after a few moments."
Draco forced himself to smile.  “I’m just a bit tired,” he said quietly.
"So much," Harry confirmed softly.
At that moment, Harry was incapable of pondering his rotten luck. Because Harry was a toddler and so was his blond partner.
Draco heaved a dramatic sigh. "Fine, but I exect to be thoroughly shagged so I suggest you get started."
Eventually cake was served and wedding gifts were presented to the newly weds. Friends and family lingered to celebrate, glad that they could be there for Draco and Harry.
It was completely ridiculous and totally out of hand. How did one come back from this? Narcissa looked stunned and embarrassed. Lucius looked like he wanted to Avada himself. Ron was probably on the verge of pissing himself.
"You're doing to hatch my grandchild?" Narcissa asked incredulously.
“Undignified troll,” Draco muttered, glaring at Blaise.  Blaise merely winked and continued on his way.  Harry frowned at Blaise’s retreating form but didn’t comment.
Aside from a very heated snogging season, they'd only cuddled in bed. Harry sighed softly and stroked the soft blond hair, tangled with sleep. Draco hummed quietly with pleasure and snuggled closer.
“Look who’s talking,” Harry retorted with a laugh.  Draco opened his mouth to object but closed it again when Harry gave him a pointed look.  “I overheard Pansy and Hermione talking about the party and… me,” Harry admitted.
Harry stared at him for a moment with an unreadable expression. "I appreciate that Malfoy," he said finally. "Thank you."
"Are they veelas?" Ron asked suddenly.
"We were perfectly safe," Draco assured her. "We had our wands in case something went wrong."
"Yes," Draco moaned, slowly sinking onto Harry's cock. "I just need you inside me." He rolled his hips, gasping as pleasure surged through him.
It wasn't until after they'd had a late breakfast that Draco announced that it was time. The announcement came in the form of a sharp cry of mingled pain and fear.
Draco nodded, wondering how much Pansy had blurted out. "I only had time to see the pediatric ward yesterday. St. Mungos is a big place," he commented.
Oh. Harry sighed, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist. "I'm sorry," Harry murmured. "I was just trying to make you happy."
Luna had given them a large box that contained a smaller version of Harry and Draco's nest. "It's charmed to maintain its shape so you can keep the egg close by," Luna explained. "If you come downstairs or go to a friend's house, bring the nest."
Hermione stared at the couch thoughtfully. "Let me think on that one," she said slowly. "I'll come up with something. Are there any other problems or concerns?" When they shook their heads she cast a few diagnostic spells over each of them. She declared them both healthy and left, promising to see them the next day.
Ron left to make some floo calls while Hermione began casting spells to clean up the nest. Draco remained perfectly still, starting at the egg while Harry's adoring gaze shifted between the egg and Draco.
"So, you can expect a proper wardrobe as soon as we know for certain," Lucius added, looking uncomfortable but determined.
"You are," Harry agreed. "In everything. But I need to know that you've got the baby. Ron and I work well together. I'll be alright."
"And what would that be?" Rita asked, her eyes never leaving the soft great feathers.
"That's not healthy," Hermione frowned.
Okay, that was cute.
Movie night at Harry's house had become a weekly routine. Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Luna and Neville would arrive through the floo and they'd have dinner, drink and enjoy a muggle film. It was always nice for Harry to relax and enjoy the company of his friends.
When movie night arrived, Harry was tempted to cancel it. But Draco seemed to want the comfort of the routine, so Harry prepared dinner and encouraged Draco to rest until the other arrived.
"Stop touching my body," Harry muttered awkwardly.
After a few moments, Draco sighed. "I'm so sorry," he whispered. "I don't know what's gotten into me."
“And Christmas is a time for… happiness or something,” Pansy added, waving her wine glass through the air vaguely, causing the liquid to slosh about.  “I’m grateful that Draco decided to do something about his feelings.  I’m bloody sick of hearing about it.”
"I love you Harry," Draco murmured against Harry's lips.
Pansy folded her arms and proceeded to sulk.  Hermione just looked sheepish.  Clearly they’d been careless about when and where they’d discussed the matter.
"The last time we did that, we fell down and you whined about it for an hour," Harry retorted.
Ron looked over and saw that Harry and Draco looked a bit upset and maybe nauseous. He felt like an idiot. The thought of eating any sort of bird would probably feel like cannibalism. Ron felt bad that he hadn't considered that before opening his big mouth. They were already making so many adjustments, and now neither of them could stand the thought of eating something they enjoyed. Roast chicken was one of Harry's favorites and Draco loved it the first time he had it.
"We're both Weasleys now," Ron corrected him sharply.
Draco hugged Harry again, relief flooding through him. "The egg is hatching," he informed Harry with a watery smile.
"Being rather picky for a bloke that can't be bothered to buy his own sweets," Ron commented, glancing at the overflowing basket in Pansy's hands.
Rita sat down on one of the chairs, eyeing Harry skeptically. "And where is Mr. Malfoy?"
"Now, don't worry," Draco said, kissing Harry's forehead gently. "I wanted my parents to join us for breakfast. My mother is anxious to see you. Pansy is bringing Blaise over as well. That's all, I promise," he added hastily. "Just a small group and everyone has promised their best behavior. Trust me?" he requested softly.
“Thank you Potter,” Pansy replied graciously.
Draco withdrew from Harry's body carefully. A few spells left them clean, dry and content.
"Happy now?" Draco asked his father with a smirk.
"It's not just Christmas," Pansy said, glancing at Draco fondly. "He says that he doesn't want to save it all for Christmas. Some of his 'work' is needed all year."
"It's been a pleasure doing business with you," Rita said, her smile sickeningly sweet.
"Of course," Ron answered, his head bowed.
"That might not be necessary," Draco said thoughtfully. He looked at Harry. "How would you feel about Christmas here? In shifts, of course. We wouldn't want to bring everyone over here at once."
Harry and Draco spent the remainder of the day practicing with their wings. Their muscles and bones had changed a bit to support their wings and it was difficult to make the movements they desired.
Harry sighed. After a moment, he pulled Hermione into a hug. "I'm sorry," he murmured, his voice rough. "I just- I don't want to talk about..."
"Exactly," Harry agreed. "Most reporters would do anything for such an exclusive."
"Perfectly serious," Harry confirmed, pulling a small black box out of his trouser pocket. He released Draco and opened the box to reveal a pair of platinum bands. Each had tiny diamonds arranged to look like a pair of wings.
"We didn't," Ron insisted. "Malfoy wanted to see you."
"Not if I can help it," Draco muttered. "Let's just see if Robards will let us leave early. We did suffer quite an ordeal," he reasoned.
"You are a man," Hermione nodded. "But the potion that changed you, evidently made your bird half female."
"Hey, I feel bad that Potter and Malfoy are too afraid to leave the house," Grant said with a friown. "They do fantastic work and this was just rotten luck."
"None that we could find," Ron replied. "But, we did find a bit of the potion. I sent it to the lab for analysis. Maybe the ingredients themselves will be a clue. Or we could find a cure," he added, nodding toward Harry's gray wings.
"I may have been thinking about your past sexual encounters," Draco admitted.
"We'll inform you straight away," Harry assured everyone. "We'd like the event itself to be a bit more private."
“Thank you Draco,” Harry said with a smile.  He took a bite and moaned with such pleasure that Draco blushed.  Hermione and Pansy bit their lips and looked away, struggling to suppress their giggles.  Ron rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “just kill me now.”
In Harry's bedroom, Harry was stroking Draco's feathers with one hand while his other hand pressed lightly against the middle of Draco's back, keeping the blond close. "Just relax," Harry said softly.
"I told you," Hermine said proudly.
Draco gave a dignified little sniff and unrolled the paper. There on the from page was a picture of Draco and Harry with James. Their wings were spread dramatically while James was gently cuddled in Harry's arms.
Draco sighed, running his fingers through Harry's messy hair. "You can't compare yourself to anyone else," Draco told him gently. "Everyone processes grief in their own way. You went through some truly horrific things that nobody should have been forced to cope with. It's idiotic for anyone to expect for you to come out of that alright. You should be seeing a mind healer."
Draco eyed Harry critically. It seemed that it had been a rough night. Harry looked exhausted and tense. His eyes were a bit red, but it wasn't clear if it was from fatigue or tears. Both seemed likely scenarios.
"As much as I admire Harry, I didn't do this out of the goodness of my heart," she reminded him.
The stretch burned a bit, but the pleasure was exquisite. Draco felt delightfully full and his cock was rubbing against Harry's abdomen with every move they made. He kissed Harry urgently, his tongue sliding along Harry's messily.
"No," Draco responded with a smile. "I've got plenty of time for that. I was actually wondering if you were going to be rewarding all my 'good deeds'. I did get an Order of Merlin today."
Pansy moved to prepare tea, aware that Narcissa was watching her. "There relationship is... more intimate than I would have guessed," Narcissa said carefully.
“You’ve shamed Slytherin house,” Blaise added with a smirk.
"Harry," Draco moaned softly. "I want you inside me."
Suddenly, Harry was hit by a stunner and knocked face first into the shrub. A second stunner hit Draco and he collapsed as well.
"You look wonderful my darling," Narcissa said fondly. "How are you feeling?"
"Oddly specific problem to have," Pansy muttered. Harry glasses at her.
"Hermione, I know you and Parkinson might get all hot and bothered at the thought of two blokes tearing into each other, but my poor heart can't take it!"
"We felt them tearing through the wards," Draco said, his tears falling steadily. "We floo called Hermione. She came and brought Ginny, Pansy and Luna." He swallowed hard. "We sent the ladies upstairs with the egg. No matter what happened to us, we weren't going to risk the baby."
After a few moments, Harry drew back with pink cheeks and a nervous smile. Pansy cooed at them. "You're so cute together that I can't stand it," she declared.
Ron walked over and carefully too the egg from Harry before returning to his seat next to Pansy. Then Harry gently guided Draco toward the arch. "Is this alright?" he asked softly.
Draco nodded his understanding, leading Harry to the couch. They sat down and Draco healed Harry's hand with a spell. They sat in silence for a while, until Draco realized that Harry had fallen asleep. Smiling, Draco shifted a bit to get more comfortable. When Harry was troubled by his dreams, silent tears rolled down his cheeks and Draco tenderly wiped them away, ignoring the little ache in his own heart.
"Would you like for us to wait to notify the others?" Hermione asked.
"This is... Complicated," Hermione began cautiously. "Maybe Ron could wait in the hall?"
"Thank Merlin," Draco groaned as he felt Harry's cool, slippery fingers breach him. "I was afraid I'd have to beg."
"Not today," Harry replied blandly. "Today I come to make a deal with you."
"Somebody doesn't like to have his nappy changed," Draco said, his voice laced with sympathy as he kissed James' face. "My poor darling. Let's get you fed."
Pansy huffed in frustration and looked around, her dark eyes landing on Ron and Hermione. "Weasley, be a dear," she said, wiggling her fingers vaguely toward the top shelf.
"It's just strange," Draco shrugged. "Try mine."
"I might have made some... arrangements," Harry admitted. "If you'd prefer to wait, it's not a problem. But, you have the option to get married right away."
Harry had begun struggling to get up, so Ron helped him out of the bed. As soon as he was upright, Harry nearly fell backwards from the extra weight of the wings. Ron rebalanced him gently and helped Harry to move toward Draco.
"Rita Skeeter," Harry said excitedly. "She's an unregistered animagus. A beetle. She's got the best disguise."
"Indeed," Draco agreed with a smirk. "But I'm certainly no woman."
"What happened?" Ron asked, frowning at the couple.
"Forget how to use your wand?" Ron grumbled, though he did walk over and retrieve the chocolates that she wanted.
The food was delicious and plentiful. The dining room and table had been magically expanded to accommodate their guests. Lucius was a mostly silent for the whole thing, but when he did speak it was with all the politeness he could muster.
"This beautiful egg caused that much pain," Draco murmured, his fingers stroking the shell lightly.
"Definitely," Harry nodded, pushing Draco back to relax against the wall of the nest. He lowered himself between Draco's thighs and swallowed his cock eagerly. His fingers were lubed up and he began working them into Draco's opening gently.
"So now we've got to figure out why they are trying to become birds," Ron sighed. "I'll go update Robards and Kingsley." He left the room with a tired wave.
"You called her a whore just yesterday," Harry mentioned, pouring a glass of pumpkin juice for Draco.
Draco looked like an angel with his wings stretched out wide and a smile on his face. "They're beautiful," Harry said admiring the gleaming feathers.
Hermione nodded in sympathy, placing her hand over Ron’s face and pushing him away when he moved closer to get her attention.  Ron let out a huff of indignation.  “I don’t see why you went to the trouble,” Ron grumbled.  “Clearly Harry is not interested.”
Harry had thrown the knickers onto the floor of the lift and set them on fire. Draco had sunk to the floor in a fit of hysterical laughter. Harry was grateful that most encounters weren't nearly so embarrassing. But Draco had made up for his laughter at Harry's expense by loudly berating the brazen witch for sexual harassment of the Chosen One. The atrium was probably not the best place for such a thing, but it did seem to warn others away from similar stunts.
"It's fine Draco," Hermione insisted. "I'm so happy. I get to be your healer still, right?" she asked with a grin.
"We're very happy for you both," Molly added.
"You deserve it," Pansy told him firmly, kissing his cheek. Then she grinned mischievously. "And as an additional present, how about some gossip?"
"I'm giving you permission to try it," Harry reasoned. "That's why I got up. It's too small for two people. Just for a moment. If you like it, we'll make one for you later."
"You bastard," Draco muttered, turning to press his face to Harry's neck.
Hermione sniffled pitifully, and Ron looked thoroughly miserable.
For a moment they stood in silence, staring at the tin of poisoned tea. Despite keeping Draco's pregnancy a secret, they'd all trusted Grant. He'd been Ron's partner for nearly two years. He'd been working with them on the case that had transformed Harry and Draco.
"Another threat to expose my animagus status?" Rita snapped. "And I thought you might be above all that."
Harry grabbed Draco's glass and tossed back the remainder of the firewhiskey. It burned down his throat and his eyes watered. "Bloody hell," he gasped. "What a nightmare."
Draco gave her an impatient look. "No bride wants to be upstaged by the pregnant bloke that can't seem to stop crying like a moron."
"Don't try to get out of it now," Draco retorted haughtily. "I'm about to marry the shite out of you, and you'll just have to take it."
"Belladonna," Draco croaked, his hands shaking. "There's belladonna mixed into that tea. And..." He picked the tin back up and cracked the lid to take another cautious whiff. "A bit of aconite as well."
Lucius was staring at them with wide eyes and a red face. He coughed again, struggling to clear his airway.
"You didn't need to do this," Draco said. "This is your room."
Ron shrugged helplessly. "Sorry mate," Ron said. "People who are completely mental tend to do things that are completely mental. The Ministry sided with the Veela after Grant's brother died, but Grant insists that his brother was under the veela's influence."
Draco's giggles trailed off and he nuzzled Harry's neck. "I love you," he sighed contentedly.
Rita considered them for a moment. Then she sighed. "Who am I following and why?" she asked warily.
"That seems perfectly rational," Trelawney nodded. "Congratulations Mr. Potter. You will have three god-children." Harry just nodded, dazed.
"I think... Maybe just us tomorrow," Draco said. "I'm having a difficult time with the concept of setting the egg down. The thought of having the house full of people is... unpleasant. Perhaps we can wait until the next movie night?"
"Not a hero," Draco clarified, his cheeks pink. "I thought that I could give what I could to make things better. I wanted to feel something besides regret. And it works," he added quietly.
"I might have practiced a bit," Draco admitted, smiling as the baby calmed and blinked up at him. "He's got your hair."
"Salazar," Blaise groaned, rolling his eyes.
Draco bit his lip, forcing himself to go slowly. He was so relieved when Harry seemed ready for him. He carefully removed his fingers and slicked up his cock. "Can you get on your hands and knees?" he asked.
The others joined in with a cheer. A moment later, Professor Trelawney approached them. "I see that I was correct," she said rather smugly.
Draco nodded, accepting the baby without complaint. The medi-witch winked at Harry and hurried out.
"It's not your fault," Harry argued.
Harry's face reddened. "I just..." He glanced at Draco and then looked away again, flustered. "Shut up Ron."
Harry grinned, shifting to kiss Draco deeply. Once he broke the kiss he finished undressing them and followed Draco into the nest.
Rita was a bit overwhelmed. Of all the things that she could have guessed, a baby had never entered her thoughts. Even with Harry's restrictions, the story is going to be huge. She shook off her shock and pulled a quill and notepad from her handbag, handing the bottle back to Draco. "What is it that you'd like to say?" she asked, looking between Harry and Draco.
The suggestion seemed to cheer Ron up a bit. He nodded and watched as Harry ate his biscuit and made soft humming noises in approval of the sweetness. Ron glanced over to Draco to see the blond smacking his lips and eyeing Harry's biscuit. Ron wasn't fond of Malfoy, but he wouldn't be mean to a toddler. "Do want a biscuit Malfoy?" he asked.
“You’re welcome,” Pansy said in a sing-song voice while the others snorted with laughter.  Hermione looked as if she was struggling to draw breath through her giggles.  Ron appeared to be torn between horror and hysterical laughter.
As much as Draco enjoyed having his feathers preened and stroked, he wanted a task at that moment. It didn't require a great deal of thought, but caring for Harry's wings was soothing in a way. His fingers slid between feathers and stroked downward, straightening any that had been ruffled. He moved slowly, gently soothing itchy spots and easing the tension out of Harry's body.
Draco smiled, squeezing Harry's hands. "I won't be needing the other bedroom," he said. "It can be a guest room." He laughed at Harry's excited grin.
For a moment, neither of them spoke or moved.  And then, Draco seized the front of Harry’s robes and pulled him into a searing kiss.  Harry responded eagerly, wrapping one arm around Draco’s lower back while his other hand was lifted to run his fingers through pale blond hair.
Harry laughed in delight as Draco pulled him closer and twirled them around to the rhythm of the music. The fallen snow muffled their steps and snowflakes clung to their hair. Their wings swayed with them, the wind lifting their feathers in little rippling waves.
Harry was relieved. But he also felt... He wasn't sure he could think of a name for it. Harry shifted in his seat, biting down on his lip. Draco's smile was having a strange effect on Harry's heart rate.
Ron folded his arms over his chest, frowning in thought. He looked between Harry and Draco. "I can't, in good conscience, let either of you go off alone," he said. He smiled slightly at their pouting expressions. "What if you two just stayed together? Go to Harry's house and watch the telly while you get some rest. I'll check on you throughout the day. If one of you runs off, I swear I'll track you down and take you straight to Hermione," he added sternly.
"Alright, back in bed for you two," Hermione declared, gently pushing Draco toward his bed. "We can release you in the morning if nothing else happens."
"I'm sure she'd enjoy that," Draco said.
Trelawney considered this while Harry tried to keep the "what in Merlin's name is happening" expression off of his face.
Harry frowned slightly at the strange anxiety in Draco's voice. He turned to the blond in concern, his mouth going dry when he spied the mistletoe. Well, there was certainly no mistaking the request.
Ron shook himself out of his thoughts when he saw Hermione walking toward him. She looked pale and a bit shaken. "Are they alright?" Ron asked frantically.
"Mr. Malfoy," Professor Trelawney greeted him, her face taking on an expression of relief.
"I'm so sorry," Draco sniffled, mortified that he'd caused such a fuss. Most of the wedding guests were now looking curiously at him.
"Habby?" Draco questioned. He held his arms out, making grabby hands toward Harry. Harry shifted nervously. Draco sat down and patted the floor with his palm. "Sit!" he chirped.
“It’s Harry,” he corrected her with a gentle nudge.
"I believe he was preparing tea," Harry said lightly. "One moment." He slipped out of the room silently.
"I want to get married!"
"You could at least attempt to keep up appearances," Lucius hissed.
"We are," Draco responded. He paused at the top of the stairs. "McGonagall told me that Trelawney was having trouble after the war. She doesn't have many friends and no family. Christmas is especially hard for her."
Draco turned and looked around for a moment before spotting Harry.  He moved a little closer, his eyes taking in Harry’s peaceful expression.  Harry’s green eyes looked particularly bright as they reflected the glow of the fairy lights.  A smile curled his lips as he looked the tree over.
"We had no way of knowing what would happen," Harry replied. "Now we know better."
"I love you Harry Potter," Draco breathed against Harry's lips. Harry responded with another loving kiss.
Harry was curious about his altered anatomy. But it didn't seem like the best time to get a look at himself. His fingers drifted over his lower abdomen slowly. And there it was. It did feel as if he simply had a second belly button.
Scorpius smiled widely, looking even more like Draco. "I can help?" he asked.
"Does this mean we can be more than friends?" Harry asked, breaking the kiss but still holding Draco close. "Like... together? A couple?"
"It's so lovely," Molly said. "And I have no doubt that it'll be a beautiful baby."

"Just because your father brought it up in such a tacky manner doesn't mean it's not a good idea," Harry said, flapping his hand at Lucius when the man sputtered indignantly.
"Back away!" Ron's voice barked over the crowd. Ron began unceremoniously shoving people aside, his wand raised as he made his way to Harry and Draco. Blaise and Neville were close behind him. "That sound was a warning. You do not touch their wings," Ron growled. "Would you allow some stranger to grope your arse in public?"
"You've played your part well," Kingsley said soothingly. "Just remember that you're going to get him for this. We'll use him to get as much information as we can and then he'll be headed to Azkaban."
Hermine shrugged and handed one of the bottles to Pansy. Hermione waited patiently while Draco was coaxed into drinking the potion. Ron distracted Harry by picking him up and making faces.
"Can I speak with him before I go?" Narcissa asked.
Draco sighed reminding himself that Pansy had offered to help and it wouldn't be wise to antagonize her. "My apologies," he said dutifully. "I've just got my hands full." He lifted the bags slightly, hoping to gain her sympathy.
They ate dinner in comfortable silence and then Harry led the way to one of the guest rooms. He provided clothes and plenty of extra pillows and blankets.
"Unfortunately, they didn't stand around casually discussing their reasons for becoming veela," Rita said. "I'd guess that it all boils down to power. The combined abilities of a wizard and a veela... Obviously they weren't fortunate enough to be born that way."
"He doesn't need to know exactly how we went about it," Harry blurted out, resurfacing in a desperate attempt to diffuse the situation.
"I completely understand," Molly nodded. "I certainly didn't intend to upset you."
"That would be nice," Draco agreed. "Harry's in the kitchen. He'll want to hear this." He gestured for Ron to follow as he went into the kitchen.
HPDM~HPDM
Kingsley nodded. "Lucius Malfoy paid a visit to the ministry today," he said cautiously.
Draco sighed, leaning against Harry's side. "Fine," he muttered.
"It's Ron's fault," Draco blurted out with a sob.
~~HPDM~~
Ron moved closer with a nod from Hermione, climbing into the nest next to Draco. He reached underneath and cupped the egg as it finally came out completely. He pulled it to his chest, cradling it in his arms as Draco collapsed on his side.
Harry didn't recognize the voice of the woman that had shouted his name. And he had no interest in lingering in Diagon Alley to find out who it was. Draco's wings were already fluttering in agitation.
Harry found himself being made to wait in Hermione's office while she and another healer examined Draco. Harry tried to keep himself calm but he kept imagining horrific scenarios of Draco, bloody and dying. Before he could work himself into a panic attack, Ron burst through the door looking anxious. The red head took one look at Harry's expression and yanked Harry into a crushing hug. Harry let out a shaky breath, finally feeling his tears break free from his control.
Draco sighed, reluctantly shifting his hand closer to Harry. Harry nuzzled against the fabric sleepily. Draco's lips twitched upward. Hermione noticed but didn't comment.
Ron shook his head. "You two get sorted, and I'll get dinner set up," he said, shuffling past them to the dining room.
“If you keep touching me like that, I’ll shag you senseless right now,” Harry growled.
"Thanks Ron," Harry responded, forcing a smile. "And it'll be fine. There are plenty of other options." Draco nodded his agreement but didn't speak.
Ron snorted. "Am I picking up Chinese tomorrow then?" he asked.
"I'm so sorry," Draco stammered with pink cheeks.
"It can't be helped now," Kingsley said reasonably. "Just take advantage of the opportunity to make up for some of the neglect."
“You would know,” Pansy retorted.
"Er- No, it's fine," Draco responded. "I- Being able to see it makes me feel better," he admitted softly.
The day had been long and frustrating. Grant had greeted Ron cheerfully, as always. He'd casually asked how Draco and Harry were. He'd innocently asked if the tea made Draco feel better. And Ron had smiled and assured him that Draco and Harry had both enjoyed the tea. Then Ron frowned slightly saying that the couple had gotten sick shortly after their dinner, speculating that perhaps the food at dinner hadn't agreed with them. Grant, the bastard, had simpered and expressed regret that they were feeling poorly. Suddenly Ron felt that perhaps he understood why some muggle murders preferred to stab their victims. Being forced to chat with Grant was making Ron feel a bit... stabby.
"Two pregnancies are hardly shocking," Harry remarked rolling his eyes. He froze when Pansy looked away and Draco cleared his throat softly. "Draco? Are you...?
Pansy smiled widely. "He said that love was the greastest gift that he could ever give," she told Harry, pride seeping into her tone as reached out to squeeze Draco's hand.
Before Draco could comment again, Harry was tugging him up the stairs to their bedroom. As soon as the door was closed, Draco found himself pressed against it. For a moment they snogged feverishly, but then Draco pushed Harry firmly away and toward the bed.
At that moment the door opened and Ron walked in. He looked toward Harry's desk and saw what appeared to be a shirtless Draco Malfoy playing with his own nipples. Behind Malfoy's desk was Harry, reaching behind himself to cup his own arse cheeks with a mildly impressed expression. "What the hell are you doing?" Ron blurted out. "Malfoy, why are you fondling your nipples? Harry, what the hell? Why are you both half naked?"
The antidote worked more quickly than the original potion. After ten minutes, Draco had returned to his appropriate size and age. His robes had been charmed to grow with him. Finding himself naked would not have gone over well.
Ron gasped sharply. Kingsley turned to the other Aurors. "Take them to the DMLE and then use this portkey to meet us," he barked, tapping his wand against a button and handing it to Auror Green. Then Kingsley grabbed Ron's arm and apparated them both away.
"I could kill the Dursleys," Ron said, careful to keep the harshness out of his tone. "How can someone neglect him? Look at him!" he demanded, gazing at the little boy in his arms. Harry stuck his little tongue out to give the biscuit a lick before nibbling on it.
"I wish you had told us," Ron said sadly.
The rest of the day was a great deal less delightful. The body of a veela had been found, drained of blood. It had transformed into it's winged state before its death. Ron and Grant seemed sure that it was related to Harry and Draco's case, but they wouldn't say why exactly they'd come to that conclusion. At that moment, it was enough to say that the veela had died a gruesome, painful death.
Harry broke the kiss but kept his arms around Draco. "Nice to see you," Harry said to Narcissa, a faint blush filling his cheeks.
Harry flushed turning to hide his groin from Ron while Draco laughed. "I'll take care of that later," he told Harry helpfully, not bothering to lower his voice. He snorted when Ron shuddered. Harry grinned sheepishly and kissed Draco's lips sweetly.
"Then we'll make one for you," Harry said, grinning while Draco reluctantly crawled back out of the nest.
Draco shuffled closer to Harry, still cradling their egg. He reached out to gently stroke Harry's hair. "Harry Potter, if you die, I'll never forgive you," he said, his voice barely more than a broken whisper. "I don't want to go on without you."
"Are you alright?" Draco asked drawing Harry into a warm hug.
"Father?" Draco prompted, trying to keep himself calm.
"What?" Draco asked, turning around. "Why?"
“He’ll be along shortly,” Pansy replied.  “He said something about checking on the food selection.  The house elves seem to have forgotten the treacle tart, and he said that it’s your favorite.”
Draco struggled to compose himself. He'd been an emotional wreck with Scorpius too. Stupid hormones. It was rather lucky that the pregnancy portion of this was rather short. Then he just had to deal with being a complete lunatic over a giant egg for five to six months. The joys of parenthood.
Harry snorted again. "Yes, daddy said something naughty didn't he?" he chuckled, reaching out to stroke Daniel's soft hair.
"Draco surpasses my efforts by a wide margin," Harry argued.
Harry was silent for a moment. Draco waited patiently, soothed by the fact that Harry's fingers were tracing odd little patterns on the front of Draco's jumper. "I'll see a mind healer," Harry said. "I'm going to get better. And..." He paused, licking his lips nervously. "And I think I need you in my life. You mean more to me than I thought possible, and I'd like to keep you."
"It's no problem," Draco said, waving her off. "Excuse me a moment," he said to Harry and Ron before getting up following Pansy into the living room.
Harry smiled, his hand coming up to comb his fingers through soft blond hair. He smiled as Draco sighed happily. He shifted closer, lowering his head to kiss Draco's lips, his hand settling to cradle the back of Draco's head.
"I'm sure he'd appreciate that endorsement," Pansy deadpanned.
A gasp startled the two men out of their heated exchange.  Hermione and Pansy had approached while they were distracted.  The two women were gaping at them in shock.
"That did help actually," Draco admitted. "Thank you."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked. "Did your parents get home today?"
"Just give them a minute," Ron told him quietly. Grant nodded mutely.
He didn't mention that some of the children came from families that couldn't afford much. Most of them would be going home soon enough, but a few had illnesses or injuries that resisted the usual magical cures. Like little Maddie.
Draco smiled. "We should go home and watch a movie after this," he suggested quietly. "Just us."
"Sorry I fell asleep," he mumbled.
"Thank you," Harry murmured, kissing Draco softly. "It'll be alright."
"I think it's lovely that you have that sort of friendship," Luna said. "We'll wait for you to finish." She promptly turned to Pansy and started a strange debate on the legality of hunting Crumple-horned Snorkaks. Pansy looked utterly bewildered, but she launched into the debate.
"Can we help?" Draco asked anxiously. He felt like an arse just sitting their watching his baby struggle to break out of an egg.
"Last night was the first time," she said, not making eye contact. "There's been a lot of flirting but... Salazar, last night I just couldn't help myself."
Draco chirped in shock when Harry scooped him up and carried him to their bedroom. "And what do you think you're doing?" Draco asked teasingly.
They had to travel to the DMLE by using the floo directly to their office. The other Aurors had been alerted to the situation and urged to keep the information confidential.
"I've actually got to meet with Kingsley," Ron said. "I just wanted to show you what Rita got for us."
Draco paused, staring Harry down, willing him to comprehend. "Do you see it now? Do you understand?" Draco drew in a quick fortifying breath. "I would do just about anything for you. Anything to make you smile again. It breaks my heart to see you cry, Harry," he admitted softly.
"No," Draco said firmly. "You will select a more appropriate moment for this. And it had better be disgustingly romantic."
For a moment, the room was silent.
"No," Draco sighed, "But we have to get up all the same."
"It makes the investigation difficult," Ron agreed. "I can't be open with what I know, so he doesn't have all the facts. But, so it goes. You three are my priority. Now, I'm going to sleep. Use a silencing charm while you're... whatever," he said wrinkling his nose. "But cancel it when you're done. I want to be able to hear you if you need me."
"Yeah, Hermione's a genius," Ron said flatly with a dismissive wave of his hand. Pansy elbowed him in the stomach.
Ron glared at him. "I know that," he snapped. "And I have no issue with you being only partially human. You know that. I thought the idea of possibly reversing it would make you happy."
Draco moaned, tilting his head back and closing his eyes. It felt so very good. For a moment, it occurred to Draco that Harry had clearly had practice with this particular activity, and the idea made Draco rather jealous. He didn't like the idea of Harry with anyone else.
"And now, if everyone will proceed to the dining room," Pansy said loudly. "We have dinner prepared and ready to serve."
"You're wonderful," Draco murmured, pressing sleepy kisses to Harry's shoulder.
"Pansy!" Draco growled. "It's not... I mean..." he floundered to explain himself while Hermione stared at him with raised eyebrows and Ron smirked. Draco glared at Pansy. "I hate you. I hate you so much right now."
"It's an instinctual response," Pansy explained. "Draco's not been pleased with some of the more involuntary behaviors. They react sometimes without thought."
"You don't even know what your potion actually does," Draco snapped. "Well, I'm certainly not going to satisfy your curiosity. I think rotting in Azkaban is too good for you."
"Draco Lucius Malfoy!" Narcissa cried. "It is crude and undignified to speak of such things. It's meant to be private."
At that moment, a medi-witch walked in. She was carrying a baby that looked to be six months old. Spotting Draco, she walked right over to him. "Would you hold little Daniel?" she asked. "I need to go get the other baby."
Maddie pleaded and the grandmother continued to cry. And then Draco couldn't take it anymore.
"Only when I knock my wings into things," Draco muttered. "They're a nuisance."
"I'm your partner!" Draco objected.
"I seem to recall participating," Draco responded, frowning at Harry. "There's no point in blaming yourself."
Once the dessert was set on the table, Lucius and Draco had each had a bit too much firewhiskey. Lucius set his glass down hard, making Harry wince. "Are we just going to pretend this isn't a problem?" Lucius demanded.
"How are you darling?" Narcissa asked.
"Just think about it," Harry urged. "That information is going to get out eventually. This will allow us to control it. I'll have her print exactly what we find acceptable."
"Uncle George said I could have hot chocolate," Maddie said cheerfully.
"I love you too, but this is too sappy," Draco complained, though his gaze was affectionate. "You should tell me how great my arse looks and then shag me against a wall."
"I'll take them."
"You've got me and your other friends," Draco agreed. "We'll be alright."
Draco passed the egg to Ron and gently gathered Harry into his arms. "Don't ever do that to me again," Draco sobbed. He sighed as he felt Harry hug him weakly.
"Perfectly," Draco responded.
Pansy came into the dining room and froze when she realized Ron was there. "I didn't mean to interrupt dinner," she said.
Harry and Draco were sitting side by side on the couch, their feet propped up the the coffee table in front of them. "This isn't another soppy romance is it?" Draco asked.
"Well, this is hawk-ward," Ron quipped. He grinned. "Get it? I said 'hawk', 'cause that's a bird."
It took several minutes for the aurors to get into position. Ron lifted his wand and began casting as he moved forward on silent feet. He removed the disillusionment charm as soon as one of the dark wizards looked up in alarm. Suddenly, the aurors appeared, blocking off escape.
Maddie waved shyly to Lucius and Narcissa. Lucius nodded politely and Narcissa gave a slight wave back. Turning back to Draco, Maddie's smile fell. "What will happen to me?" she asked quietly. "My auntie has too many children."
“Boyfriend?” Draco asked with a little smirk.  “I don’t recall ever making such a commitment to you scar-head.”
When they resumed their shopping, it was with Harry's hand clasping Draco's.
"What's his name?" Ron asked moving closer for a better look.
Draco pulled in a shaky breath. The outside of the egg had been relatively flexible and soft as it took in nutrients. Now that the shell had hardened...
"Thank Merlin you love the smell of tea," Harry whispered, cupping Draco's face and kissing him softly. "If you hadn't checked, we might not have noticed until it was too late." Draco chirped softly in distress, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist.
Harry smiled and deftly swapped babies with Draco, Tom going to Draco eagerly and snuggling into his neck. Daniel yawned and stuck his thumb in his mouth before resting his head on Harry's shoulder. Their friends and family looked on, marveling at the expression of contentment and love that shone on Harry's face.
Hermione shrugged apologetically. "I'll be waiting for when Draco's ready to deliver the egg," she said. "Then we wait again for it to hatch. Our timeline is unknown."
"Stop staring," Draco muttered self-consciously, setting the spoon on his empty plate.
"Veela aren't related to birds," Ron said, glancing away from the parchment to Rita.
Harry's eyes were wide. "My last date was two years ago and it was with a man," he blurted out, his voice slightly panicked.
"Yes," Draco answered. "I think he looks like a James, don't you? And we can use a constellation name for the next baby," he added lightly.
They still argued. A lot. But, Draco's snarky comments were now more likely to make Harry laugh than to provoke anger. Harry was far more witty than Draco had initially expected, and their banter made the work day less dull.
“Bloody hell!” Hermione exclaimed loudly in exasperation, drawing some shocked looks from people nearby.  “He was right under the mistletoe.”
"Merry Christmas," Draco said warmly. "I've brought a friend along."
Unfortunately, it resulted in a great deal of letters from people the two men hardly knew. And their lack of appearance in public had driven the gossip-mongers spin increasingly wild tales. One theory was that the pair had become more bird than human and had flown off to roost in the Amazon. Draco had laughed a great deal over that one.
"You don't have to be alone," Draco said, tensing slightly. He heaved a sigh, standing up and looking out the window for a moment. When he turned, he met Harry's eyes. "What have I been doing these last few weeks?" Draco asked. "I feel like I've been tormenting myself only for you to be an infuriatingly oblivious sod." He could see Ron and Hermione sharing an amused look.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly. "I didn't feel comfortable with making chicken," he said.
As tempting as it was too interfere, Pansy knew that she'd have to resist. She'd attempted matchmaking in the past with Blaise. He'd had his heart broken and didn't speak to her for six months. So Pansy resigned herself to waiting and watching. And if the opportunity came, she'd offer as much encouragement as she could.
“This is so stupid,” Pansy complained quietly.  “I’ll have to kill everyone just to maintain my sanity.”
Harry frowned, wondering what she meant. She'd said a number of truly bizarre things when he saw her the year before.
"Of course not," Harry denied hastily. "I just... I probably should have given you a sobering potion before we did anything."
It took trial and error to figure out how to propel themselves forward or turn. But the practiced eagerly, laughing and joking all the while. They were both very tired, but neither was wanted to go inside yet. The darkening clouds appeared to determined to chase them indoors though.
Draco boiled some water with a spell and added it the teapot before grabbing an infuser to put the tea leaves in. He opened the tin and sniffed at the contents. He frowned and took another sniff, inhaling more deeply. He slapped the lid back on and slammed the tin onto the counter with a look of horror.
Pansy nodded.  “I know I wanted him to stop mooning over Potter and do something about it,” she said quietly.  “But I hate to see Draco so sad.”
Ron considered that for a moment. Draco and Harry had become good friends. They spent a lot of time together. There was all the odd touching that went on between them. It wasn't much of a stretch to think that such caring could develop into romantic feelings. "No, I see what you mean," Ron said. He smiled slightly. "They already take care of each other."
Appeased, Draco kissed Harry sweetly, mindful of the egg he was holding. He smiled as Harry held out his own arms hopefully. The egg was lovingly transferred to Harry's embrace and Harry settled against the side of the nest, cooing softly to their unborn child.
Draco and Harry's relationship had grown more affectionate, but Harry was hesitant to initiate anything. Part of him was worried that Draco was only acting as he was because of a lack of options. Harry didn't want that. If by some miracle their condition was reversed, where would that leave them? Then again, it wasn't fair to doubt Draco in that way.
"Everything alright?" Harry asked, stepping into the nursery with a full bottle of milk. He smiled, admiring the sight of his husband nuzzling their son and cooing quietly to soothe the infant's crying. It was a beautiful thing to behold and Harry was so grateful that this was his life now.
Draco giggled and pulled away from Harry’s searching mouth.  “Later,” he whispered, pressing a tender kiss to Harry’s lips.
“Thank you,” Pansy replied sweetly, enjoying Ron’s discomfort.  “Draco and I worked so hard on this and I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”
"We'll let them know," Ron said, eyeing Draco curiously.
"No problem," Ron responded with a little shrug. "I sort of had a feeling, so I popped out to talk to Kingsley while you lot were chatting. He and Robards are going to cover for me with Grant."
Draco resisted that impulse, of course. That course of action wasn't likely to produce more smiles. They'd only been friends for a few short weeks. Such a display of affection was likely to make Harry panic.
"Then you can be concerned about the fact that I made Harry come all over my stomach," Draco snapped.
Ginny and Luna came downstairs warily, taking in the bound wizards, broken furniture and Harry Potter, soaked in blood. Ginny was holding the egg in her arms, determined to keep it warm.
He suppressed a sigh. It was complicated at times. He needed to consider recruiting a few more friends. Perhaps Harry would be willing. Setting aside that idea for the moment, he ushered Harry back through the floo.
"I'm going with you," Draco insisted.
"We wait," Kingsley replied tiredly. "Could I persuade you to care of them until their condition can be reversed?" he asked.
"That's right," Hermione agreed with a nod. "That's what makes a few of the healers think it was meant to be a full transformation. Why include a part of a bird's anatomy that would be useless to a hybrid."
The Aurors began lifting their prisoners and preparing to move them to the DMLE holding cells. Their interrogation was going to be quite thorough.
Harry groaned loudly. The stretch from Draco's fingers burned a bit. He hadn't bottomed in quite a while, and never with Draco. But Harry was too aroused for the discomfort to be of any concern. Harry wasn't sure that he'd ever be able to handle Draco touching his wings without getting an erection from now on.
Draco glanced away from the telly to look at the quilt. Various runes had been carefully stitched into the fabric with thread that shimmered faintly. Despite feeling cool to the touch against his hand, the quilt was radiating comforting warmth against his body. He could feel his dizziness and nausea subsiding as he relaxed into the couch.
"I'm sure your mother is going to smooth things over," Harry said gently. "We'll take this one day at a time. You're not alone in this." He sat up and climbed out of the nest abruptly. "Get in," he said eagerly.
"Right," Hermione agreed. "The point is, penetration isn't necessary in this case. Birds mate differently. There are variations between types of birds. But the idea is that the cloacas of the two birds touch. It's very brief but that's all it takes for conception.
They rocked together slowly, starting their morning in a delightful way.
Draco panted as Hermione helped him to his feet. He was relieved to see Harry coming toward him. He gasped sharply at the sight of the large great wings. Gripped with fear and dread he craned his head back, catching a glimpse of one of his own white wings. "What the hell happened?" he screeched hysterically.
"What else have you done?" Draco asked incredulously.
Draco met Harry's gaze. "Yes?" he asked hopefully.
"I'll get Hermione," Ron said hastily. "Get Draco upstairs."
A few minutes later, Harry woke up back to normal. He opened his eyes and blushed when he realized that he was clutching his partner's sleeve. Harry released his hold in favor of rubbing at his temples with a groan. "That was... intense," he muttered softly.
Draco gently placed baby James in Harry's arms. "Harry Potter, we will fill this house with children if that's what you want," Draco said.
"This is so much better than the movies," Draco said, smiling softly. "I love you so much," he whispered, not even caring that he was on the verge of crying. Again.
"Don't leave me behind," Draco begged, not caring that he sounded emotional and weak. He could stand the thought of something happening to Harry. It was Draco's job to protect Harry.
Harry's anxious thoughts faltered, when something brushed against his knee. He glanced down to see Draco shift his leg closer, firmly pressing his knee against Harry's. Harry looked back up to find Draco's eyes on him. "Having a good time?" Draco asked, reaching up to smooth down Harry's hair gently.
HPDM~HPDM
"No you don't," Draco responded with an eye roll. "It's not your baby."
"I'm glad," Draco replied. " Does this mean you'll finally stop calling me Malfoy?"
"I think you just want attention," Harry grinned.
"I can list several other pregnancies where she predicted the gender," Hermione said. "It's ridiculous, but she's right every time. If she says you're having a girl, then we better be prepared for the birth of a little princess."
"You petted Potter to sleep?" Blaise asked with a snort of laughter.
That night, Draco and Harry got all of their children into bed so they could enjoy some time alone. The twins fell asleep easily, soothed by the lullaby that Harry sang to them each night. Maddie always wanted a bit of cuddling from each of them before going to sleep. Who could deny such a request?
"It was Harry's idea," Pansy reminded him. "He told us what he wanted and we brought his ideas to life. He loves you so much Draco," she added, her eyes drifting to the other groom who was hugging Molly and Arthur before they departed.
"Grant over there?" one of the aurors, Alan Green, asked with a scowl.
Draco glanced at Harry's thoughtful expression as the walked through Diagon Alley. It was early December and snow was falling softly around them. They'd decided to do some shopping for Christmas and enjoy some hot chocolate at Fortescue's.
And then Harry was kissing Draco gently, his hands coming up to cradle Draco’s face.  He lingered for just a moment before he pulled his mouth away, though he left his hands on Draco’s face.  Harry grinned mischievously, biting his lower lip.
Harry pulled Draco out of the nursery and into their room. Draco gasped when Harry pressed him into the wall, gently pinning the lovely white wings. It felt a little odd, but it didn't hurt so Draco relaxed into Harry's hold.
"Let's get ready to have a baby then," Harry said, allowing Neville and Blaise to help him stand. He slowly made his way up the stairs, ignoring the pain in his stomach in favor of focusing on his joy. Harry settled himself in their nest, sighing in relief at the comfort it offered. Draco followed him, sitting in the nest close to his husband. Ron gingerly place the egg in Draco's lap.
"Please," Ron scoffed. "I've got news for you mate. It's everybody's baby," he said waving his hand to indicate everyone at the table.
Harry’s gaze softened.  “I like you too,” he whispered with a wink.  “This was really the only thing I wanted for Christmas this year.”
HPDM~HPDM
Christmas music drifted out of one of the shops and Draco smiled at the sound. It reminded him of something Hermione had mentioned. He abruptly stopped and pulled Harry around to face him.
Harry drank the potion without complaint. After a few moments, he sat up and stretched his wings. "I expect you to rest for a few days," Hermione said sternly.
Draco sighed. "That came out wrong," he said. "You look unwell, and I was expressing concern."
Hermione arrived first, bringing along something that looked like a giant cushion. It was similar to a muggle bean bag chair, but it was big enough for two people. She plopped it onto the the floor of the living room looking pleased with herself. "This will work for now," she said. "You'll be able to relax on your stomachs while you watch the movie."
Harry walked over and smiled broadly at Hermione and Ron.  His smile faltered slightly at Ron’s sulky expression before he turned to Pansy.  “Great party,” he told her with a grin.
"Please don't split us up," Maddie begged. "I promise I'll be good."
Hermione and Ron exchanged a look that puzzled the two former Slytherins. "Harry's..." Ron paused, looking away awkwardly. "We don't see him as much."
For a few moments, nothing seemed to happen. And then pain tore through Harry's body. He felt as if his very skin was attempting to shred itself. Next to him, Draco cried out in agony. They helplessly writhed in pain. Their captors merely looked on. One of them was making notes in a little book.
Draco took a deep breath. "Mother, we've discovered that my avian side is...female," he explained awkwardly. "I'm... We're expecting," he said, resting one hand on his stomach.
"No, but..." Harry cast a quick spell, looking uncertain. "I don't want to risk damaging the egg."
"Those wings are as much apart of them as their arms and legs," Hermione replied. "It would be incredibly painful to remove them. As for reversing the... ah, mutation... We're in the dark. We dare not traumatize these two any further. This is going to take time and research."
"It's fine Harry," Pansy assured him. "I was just startled. No harm done."
Grant returned with a tray of tea, eyeing Draco in concern. "Thank you," Harry told him, running his fingers over Draco's wings gently.
"I want to," Harry insisted. "You know that I love you. Our baby will be here soon. The only thing that would make me happier is for you to be my husband." Harry turned to face Draco, ignoring the others in the room. "Draco, will you-"
It was Maddie's joyful tears that decided the grandmother. She was a bit wary of the elder Malfoys, but she'd been told about Draco by the hospital staff. And the way the two men were gazing at the three children was touching.
Auror Green paused and knelt down between Draco and Ron. "You'll let us know how he is?" he asked quietly, glancing at Harry.
For three months, Maddie was in and out of the hospital. A medi-witch had finally become suspicious when she realized that Maddie seemed a little wary of her step-father.
Oh, how Harry despised this woman. She didn't care who she hurt so long as she got an interesting story to publish. She'd made Harry's life difficult on numerous occasions. But, her animagus form made her an excellent snoop.
"If this isn't good," Harry pressed, "just say the word."
Draco stormed into the house wordlessly. His feathers were all ruffled and his wings were a bit stiff with tension. His jaw was clenched in obvious anger.
Harry’s smile brightened.  “He was making sure that I could have my favorite dessert?”
Draco sighed quietly, his anxiety fading rapidly. He'd known that the Weasley matriarch would hard their child, but his instinct to protect had flared in sudden, crippling panic. He felt foolish for his reaction. But, the others didn't seem to mind and had moved on.
"But to mutilate their own bloodline," Ron muttered, disgusted. He sighed and pushed away from the table. "This may be enough. You've been a big help," he said.
Grant's dark eyes scanned the yard, drifting right past Harry and Ron who were safely hidden behind the invisible wall of magic. He growled in frustration, turning to face away from the house and looking around. Then he turned back and pointed his wand, muttering an incantation.
"Daddy crying again," James muttered, reaching out to brush away the lone tear the was making it's way down Draco's cheek. "You okay Daddy?"
He had to admit that Draco wasn't so bad anymore. Draco was still a sarcastic, stuck-up prat, but he looked out for Harry in the field and his comments were more teasing than hateful. Ron would certainly never admit it out loud, but the former Slytherin had been a rather pleasant addition to their group of friends.
Harry worked silently, carefully smoothing the beautiful feathers down. Hermione had thoughtfully provided them with a good number of shirts made from special fabric; It opened in the back for the wings and then closed again, leaving two holes for the wings to protrude.
"Yeah yeah," Ron waved her off. "Let me get them safe. Then you'll get your recognition and the exclusive interview. You have my word."
"Are you making my patient cry?" Hermione asked, startling them. They hadn't heard her come in.
"You're staying here with our baby," Harry said sternly. His look softened a bit and he caressed Draco's face. "I'll be fine. I won't go outside the wards. I just need to be able to see who's trying to get through. I'll take Ron with me. We'll be right outside." He gingerly lifted the egg out of Ron's arms and gave it to Draco, his heart aching at the anxiety in Draco's eyes.
Ron choked on his laugh, lifting his head to look at Harry. Draco was staring at Harry with wide, shocked eyes. Narcissa and Lucius looked bewildered but hopeful.
"That's because she's a stupid bint and I hate her sometimes," Draco replied with a sniff.
Draco smiled and then turned to Hermione. "Would be willing to organize a schedule?" he asked her. "We can allow some time for everyone at the Burrow to come spend some time with Harry without it becoming loud or chaotic."
Pansy frowned. "How can that be?" she asked. "We still hear about all the wonderful things that Potter does all the time." Draco nodded his agreement.
~~HPDM~~
"Maybe another time," Draco replied with a little shrug. "Unless that's what you'd like to do."
Hermione had been one of the healers that rushed down the hallway. It made Room feel a little better that she was one of the people taking care of Harry. And Draco.
"I think he's depressed," Hermione said sadly. "We don't know how to help him."
"Hermione sent me her Patronus," Neville put in helpfully. "She told me what was happening and wanted me to get her some potions. I called Blaise and had him help me."
Draco grinned as Harry passed James to Ron. "Come on then," Draco said, grabbing Harry's hand and heading for the back door. Ron followed them out, kissing the baby's soft cheek as he went.
"Lucius!" Narcissa snapped.
"Are you having any pain?" Hermione asked them.
"Sure," Ron agreed. "Beats getting a Chinese takeaway again."
When the meal was over, popcorn and various sweets were prepared in bowls while a movie was selected. Draco sighed and moved into the living room, glad that the others were still in the kitchen for the moment.
"We've got to get more information," Harry groaned.
Hermione handed Harry the second bottle. They all watched as he drank the potion from the safety of Draco's arms. Once he was finished, Hermione motioned toward the cot and Draco carefully layed the little boy down.
The next Christmas was quite different from the last. Harry and Draco wore matching bonding rings and each were carrying one of the twins as they strolled through Diagon Alley on Christmas Eve. Maddie was walking between them and looking around at the festively decorated shop windows. The family had been lured out of their warm home with a promise of a special Christmas show at the Weasley joke shop.
"No, we're just passing through to the maternity ward," Hermione replied. "Angelina just had her baby."
Pansy couldn't seem to stop her gaze from drifting over to Draco and Harry as the movie played. The pair seemed rather comfortable together. Periodically one of them would make a comment, speaking in low voices to avoid disturbing the others. Occasionally, their private commentary resulted in poorly stifled laughter.
When Harry invited Draco to join them, it was, at first, a slightly less relaxing activity. Harry had even encouraged Draco to bring Pansy and Blaise along. Ron had not been pleased.
"We do it now," Ron snapped. "We could miss something important by following strict protocol or patting ourselves on the back too quickly. Ask now." Ron knew he probably sounded a bit unhinged, but these wizards had done a lot of damage. The rest of their group could be doing something horrible at another location right at that moment.
"You're welcome," Harry panted back with a tired grin.
After a few days, Draco finally admitted the source of his agitation. "It's just not right," Draco complained. "And I don't know how to fix it."
"Are we all jumping into Pansy and Ron's conversation now?" Blaise asked, smirking at Pansy's annoyed expression. Hermione coughed lightly to hide a laugh.
"Mr. Potter seems to be handling this just fine," Narcissa noted.
"Are you married?" Celia asked. When Draco shook his head she sighed. "I appreciate your concern, but you couldn't do it alone. I want the best for them."
Harry sighed quietly, turning to face Draco again. "I like you calling me Harry," he said softly.
"Maybe," Draco hedged. He felt a bit self-conscious about his appetite. Hermione had assured him that would take a little time for him to feel normal. His body was replenishing after spending two months redirecting most of its nutrients to the egg. Without the bulk of the egg, it was obvious that Draco was thinner than was normal for him.
Draco truly enjoyed their movie nights. Ron's whining aside, he'd been made to feel welcome. Pansy and Blaise were treated kindly as well. Draco felt comfortable enough to relax and laugh with the others. It made him wish that things had been different when they'd been in school.
"Well done Auror Weasley," Kingsley muttered to Ron tiredly. He looked over at the other Aurors. "Well done everyone."
Ron halted at the tone and shot Harry a curious look. He rolled his eyes when he noticed Harry's very obvious erection. "Mate, put that away when you've got company," he said with a smirk.
"It's alright Professor," Draco chuckled. "We should leave a bit of mystery to the future."
"I'm afraid I might have scared him off," Pansy said miserably.
"Alright," Draco said cautiously. He sat up and gently scooped the egg up to cradle it to his chest. Harry sat up as well, guiding Draco to lean again him.
Harry moved past her to find Draco pacing in agitation. His movements were jerky, as if he was unsteady on his feet. Harry's bedding was in disarray as Draco had evidently been struggling to rearrange it.
Draco lifted out a tiny baby boy with dark hair. Hermione stepped closer and carefully severed the little cord that was attached to the baby's abdomen and then cleared his airway with a gentle spell. She handed Draco a soft towel. "You should clean him up," she said, tears finally making their way down her face.
Draco spent the rest of his afternoon in a giddy haze. Harry made a delicious meal while Narcissa prattled on about baby clothes and special warming blankets for the egg. Despite the understandable shock, Narcissa had embraced the idea with enthusiasm. Draco's relief had been profound. It even made it easier for Draco to be excited about the baby.
To his surprise, Ron nodded. "You have a quill and something to write on?" After a hasty search, Ron was presented with a scrap of parchment and quill. He scribbled out the address and passed it to Draco. "Try not to upset him." Hermione was staring at Ron in surprise, but she didn't argue.
It was Ginny's turn to choke. "Oh my god," she sputtered, giggling.
"Alright, I'm in need of a new dance partner," Hermione said, offering Draco a sweet smile. "James would you dance with me?"
Draco pulled off, looking up at Harry with a heated gaze. "Touch me," Draco commanded before swallowing Harry's cock again with a loud groan.
"Of course it had to be Harry and Malfoy," Ron grumbled, shaking his head at the two year olds at his feet.
Harry set the movie up quickly and then approached Draco with a concerned down. "Are you alright?" he asked.
HPDM~HPDM
Harry smiled. "You get the information we need for us, without sharing it with anyone else," he said firmly. "I'll even acknowledge your assistance on the case. And you will publish only what I allow for the interview. If you lie, embellish or turn on me in any way, I'll destroy you. Professionally. Personally. Publicly," he stated calmly.
"So..." Pansy said, happy to change the subject. "Harry, did you really get Draco to beg for your cock?"
"Yes. And?" Draco asked impatiently.
Hermione rolled her eyes at Pansy’s theatrics.  She watched as Draco was momentarily distracted by another guest and Harry walked away to look at the Christmas tree situated in one corner of the ballroom.  It twinkled with fairy lights and was covered with beautiful sparkling baubles.
But in the bedroom, Harry took control. Draco loved it. Sweet, docile Harry became sensual and insatiable. From the very first time, Draco had gladly relaxed into the mattress and allowed Harry to worship his body in whatever way he saw fit. It was a highly rewarding experience every time.
Hermione nearly spat out her drink.  She looked around and spotted the sprigs of mistletoe that hovered around the room.  Just moments before there hadn’t been any mistletoe.  “He’s good,” she muttered.  She hadn’t even seen Draco setting up the mistletoe and a glance around told her that the other guests were just noticing its presence as well.
"Liar."
"Then we'll be ready for them," Harry said firmly, reaching out and cradling Draco's face. "We'll take care of each other like we always do."
"Then we're doing to her," Harry said sharply.
"I'm your friend," Draco went on, keeping his gaze locked on Harry. "We've spent a lot of time together. We eat together often. I keep you company. I sit with you when you're upset. We even fall asleep on your couch together from time to time. My mother and Pansy are complaining about not seeing me enough."
"And?" Draco prompted impatiently.
"It's alright Harry," Ron said softly, smiling at the scared little boy. "I won't hurt you." He moved slowly and cautiously, reaching out until he could gently stroke the soft skin of Harry's cheek. Harry remained still, staring at Ron. When Ron reached out to pick him up, he flinched slightly but made no other protest.
Harry frowned, rushing over to snatch the blue tin from the counter. He muttered softly, pointing his wand at it. He gasped when the product label peeled away to reveal a small slip of parchment. Harry plucked the parchment from the tin and looked it over, his expression turning grim. "It's a tracking spell. Clever bastard," he muttered bitterly.
Harry looked at Draco's determined expression and drew in a fortifying breath. "Draco has me," Harry said. "He won't be doing it alone."
"I think it was a lovely wedding," Pansy noted as Ron handed the egg to Draco. Ron had smugly carried the egg around for most of the evening.
At home, the boys were each placed in their own nest and covered up. Loving kisses were pressed to their foreheads and they fell asleep quickly.
Draco arched a single brow at Harry. "Don't be silly Potter. I'm far ambitious than that. I'm offended," he declared haughtily.
With moments of drinking from their coffee, both men began to feel rather hot. Draco frowned, tugging at his collar uncomfortably. Why was it so bloody hot?
Blaise rolled his eyes, setting his tea aside. " I'm fairly certain that he'd let you claim at least partial credit for most of it," he informed Harry with a smirk. He winked when Draco glared at him.
"Romantic comedy," Harry replied. "There's a love story, but it's also really funny."
Pansy didn't seem to need further explanation. "It's fine Draco," she said. "I hope you know that I'm here for you. The others are too." She kissed each of them on the cheek before stepping through the floo.
"I suppose this can't be entirely Potter's fault," Pansy admitted.
He wished that he'd requested a larger team for the mission. He was confident in himself and in Draco, but they hadn't anticipated a dark ritual complete with demonic chanting and animal sacrifices.
Ron got up and carried the now clean egg to the nest. Draco's eyes lit up despite his fatigue. "Come get on this side Harry," Ron instructed.
"I've been temporarily suspended from work," Harry managed to say through a clenched jaw. "We made an arrest and-" Harry swallowed hard, closing his eyes. "The man was poisoning his step-daughter. A little girl." Harry stopped again, opening his eyes to meet Draco's gaze. "It was Maddie," Harry whimpered.
Ron and Pansy passed the time by playing with the two year old aurors. Draco loved the attention and babbled happily at them. Harry was all shy smiles and sweet snuggles.
Draco looked like he wanted flail about and screech a bit more. But he drew in a shaky breath and remained still under Harry's warm hands.
"Are we visiting Trelawney?" he asked, suddenly feeling confused and a little horrified.
"Alright, would like a biscuit Draco?" Ron amended. He grinned when Draco nodded eagerly, holding out one tiny hand expectantly. Ron complied, smiling when Draco muttered something that was probably supposed to be a thank you.
"Any plans?"
Draco approached the two women with a frown.  “I’m done,” he said in a tone of dejection.  “I can’t do this.”  He shook his head when Pansy looked ready to argue.  “It’s too hard.  I don’t want to risk my friendship with Harry.  He’s obviously not interested and I can accept that.”
"Harry?" Draco called, prodding gently at Harry's side. "You should go to bed."
"You don't have to," Hermione said quietly. "I think you need to talk, but we won't force it. I just hate that you're alone so much. Malfoy really wanted to visit you and he's different now."
He'd figured out how to spread them out wide and pull them back in to rest closer to his back. He'd been able to flap them enough to lift up off the ground a little, though the effort had been exhausting.
"I think it's sweet," Luna chimed in. "Maybe even romantic."
At first, they only had eyes for each other. And then they realized that several couples had been inspired and were now dancing. Draco's heart fluttered when Harry laughed again.
Harry swallowed hard. "Are you sure it's safe?" he asked, glancing at Draco's stomach.
Harry opened bleary eyes and peered up at Draco with a sleepy smile. "Hey," he said softly. He frowned and lifted his head to look around. "Where is everyone?"
Draco stretched and sat up, wincing as his head throbbed. It was if all of his memories had suddenly flooded into his mind, leaving him shaken and nauseous. He lifted his trembling hands and inspected them anxiously. He turned to Pansy expectantly.
Pansy smiled slightly. "I never suspected he had it in him," she admitted. "He's especially fond of Christmas and he goes to great lengths to bring a bit of joy to others."
"One of us should be here," Harry said. "You should take care of our baby and I'll help Ron."
"Thanks," Ron whispered, closing his eyes tightly.
"Always Minister," Green agreed, apparating away with the others.
Pansy nodded, levitating the tea tray into the living room. She sat down and poured the tea, allowing Narcissa to prepare her own as she wished. "It's not sexual or romantic though," Pansy said. "Granger thinks that their hormones are unbalanced right now. Their human side sort of warring with the bird side. Draco is anxious and tense from all these changes. And then there's his father..."
Ron made a strange noise that was probably disgust.  “Let’s dance,” he muttered, pulling Hermione toward the other couples that were twirling around to the music.
"Robert has gone to get tea," Harry said, hugging Draco and pressing kisses to his face. "Just try to calm down. It's alright."
"I didn't mean to," Ron protested. "And I made him feel better," he added, pointing to the container of warm, salty chips.
Harry nodded reluctantly. "So, what do you want to do?" he asked hesitantly. "You've got a choice to make."
“I am too,” Draco responded with a little sigh.  He turned and walked away, carefully avoiding the hovering mistletoe.  He took a glass of champagne from a tray and leaned against a nearby wall.  He was ready for the party to be over.  He just wanted to sleep and forget about Harry Potter.
Harry hurried up the stairs with Ron on his heels. Pansy meet them in the hallway, wringing her hands. "Something is not right," she announced tensely.
"We haven't talked about it exactly," Draco said at the same moment that Harry said "Yes."
Harry closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath. "You know I want to," Harry said, tone full of regret. "But you're a bit drunk and you're upset with your father. I want us to make that step sober and clear headed." He smiled when Draco pouted. "But I can still make this good for you. If you want?" he added hopefully.
"What about now?" Harry asked.
"Want me to feed him?" Harry offered, handing Draco the bottle.
"And then we'll celebrate again," Pansy declared. "Honestly, if we want to throw you a party, let us do it. I'm going to help with dinner," she said, gliding out of the room with a wink at Draco.
Harry laughed. "I'm glad you think so," he remarked. He sighed softly brushing his fingertips down Draco's cheek. "You're home, you're safe and carrying our child," he murmured. "I don't think I've ever been so happy."
Grateful for Luna's weird diversion tactic, Harry turned around to face Draco. Draco shifted to offer his wings, and was rewarded with Harry's hands gliding over his feathers.
"Harry," Kingsley greeted kindly.
"You alright?" Harry asked softly.
Hermione sighed and reached out to give Draco’s hand a squeeze.  “I’m sorry,” she said quietly.
Draco sighed as Harry moved around the bed and gently maneuvered Draco's wings as Draco layed down. Harry smoothed the feathers down slowly, smirking when Draco chirped involuntarily.
Harry sighed, tilting his head to give Draco more room. His hands slipped beneath Draco's shirt to caress bare skin. His breath caught when Draco lapped slowly at his neck before sucking at it gently.
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Salazar," she groaned. "No wonder Draco keeps falling pregnant."
"The golden trio had a falling out?" Pansy asked incredulously.
"Ah... Would you pass along my congratulations?" Draco asked. He hadn't been the cause of Fred's death during the war, but he still felt immense guilt whenever he caught sight of the remaining twin. He was rather pleased that George was building his own family.
"Yes," Harry said again. "Just tell me how you want me."
"We are," Draco agreed laughing fondly. "When do you think we should do it?"
Harry remained silent, pondering the experience. Now that he was past the bewilderment and embarrassment, it hasn't been so bad. Trelawney was nice enough and something about the whole thing made Harry feel...better.
Draco realized where he was before opening his eyes. He was warm and safe in Harry's bed. His eyes fluttered open to see an oddly concerned expression.
"I'm not a child that needs to be coddled," Draco growled, pulling away.
Harry lowered himself to press against Draco's side, weeping. Draco was lying limply, his breath coming in shuddering pants.
"Where are the others?" Harry asked, his voice rough.
Draco laughed, though there were tears on his face. In the next instant, they were hugging tightly drawing comfort from one another.
Ron shuffled over to the couple while everyone else was distracted with presents.  He glanced between the two and then sighed.  “You’re an alright bloke, Malfoy,” Ron said gruffly.
Draco threw back his head and cackled in delight. "Oh that shameless tart," he chuckled fondly. He shook his head at Ron's slight frown. "Pansy doesn't shag indiscriminately like I may suggest on occasion. But, she's damn persistent and really puts in the effort when she finds someone that she fancies. The fact that she didn't immediately come to give me all the sordid details is probably a good thing."
Harry nodded and then watched as Draco hurried away to answer the door. He could hear lowered voices and then a few moments later, Draco returned with his parents, Blaise and Pansy. Pansy walked right up to Harry and gave him a quick hug.
"Where's Potter?" Drano demanded, standing up slowly. His eyes widened when he saw Harry sitting in Ron's lap.
Harry shook his head.
“Is that a yes?” Draco questioned, squeezing lightly again.
Harry reached down and grasped Draco's erection with one hand, stroking him in long slow strokes. His other hand rested in Draco's hair, gently massaging his lover's scalp with his fingertips. He was so turned on and Draco seemed to be feeling rather restless.
The choking noise was what brought the pair back to the present.
"That's alright," Harry declined with a nervous sounding little chuckle.
One particular evening, Draco had found Harry seething, his eyes damp with tears and his right hand bruised and bleeding. "What have you done to yourself?" Draco cried, rushing to Harry in alarm. He looked Harry over, sighing relief when he saw no other obvious damage. "What happened?"
Draco shook his head rapidly. "I think I might be sick," he admitted softly.
Draco huffed in annoyance. "First of all," he began, ignoring the anxious little groan Harry made, "Penis insertion was not involved in the conception." Harry choked. "I can easily explain how it happened. I remember quite well. That night was so... erotic. And sticky," he added with a wicked smirk.
"You couldn't have known," Draco told him. "It's not your fault."
"What an odd house elf," Draco commented mildly, sipping nonchalantly from his cup.
Draco grew impatient with Harry's slow and careful preparation and soon climbed into Harry's lap. "Are you in a hurry?" Harry chuckled.
Harry nearly jumped when he felt Draco's hand against his back ushering him further in. They spent a few moments chatting with their ex-Professor before leaving the office. They walked quickly through the halls, grateful that they hadn't run into anyone. Most of the students had gone home for Christmas. As the began to climb a very narrow staircase, Harry realized where they were going.
Draco sat down on the couch as well, though he did it with a great deal more poise. "I haven't seen you in a while," Draco hedged, inspecting his nail beds idly. "I ran into Weasley and Granger recently. I was surprised that you weren't with them." He noted a flash of panic in Harry's eyes. "But that said that you are rather busy."
"You staying for dinner?" Draco asked taking a bite of warm bread. "Harry's making tortellini, garlic gread and a salad."
"What about what I want?" Harry demanded, beginning to look like he was tempted to join Hermione in having a good cry.
HPDM~HPDM
Draco was surprised, but rather pleased. He certainly hadn't expected Harry to be a virgin, but it made sense. Maybe Draco would be his first and only lover.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked.
“I’m one of your guests,” Harry argued.  “As your boyfriend, don’t you think I deserve some extra attention?”
A crowd was gathering around them and Harry groaned, wishing they could have apparated directly to the restaurant. Draco pressed closer to Harry as the crowd drew closer. They were all talking excitedly and asking questions at once. Harry let out a loud trill and discretely pulled out his wand when hands stretched out to touch their feathers.
"Don't do that," Ron snapped. "Tell me what's wrong with them."
Draco stepped away from Harry to embrace his mother. She hugged him gently, carefully avoiding his wings. "I know you must be terrified," she said softly. "It'll all be alright." She released him to look him over, smiling slightly at the slight protrusion of his stomach.
"I think I can get through this if I've got you," Harry said quietly.
"Spare me the details," Draco begged. "I don't want to think about the two of you..." He shuddered in revulsion.
"Neither can I," Harry agreed with a wide smile. "I'm so excited, but terrified at the same time. And... I love our baby so much," he added softly. His wings streteched out behind him, one of them curling around Draco slightly.
Draco rolled his eyes but then stilled. Something about Harry's expression... "Harry?"
Draco turned to his parents and was pleased to see his mother's smile. But his father's expression was unreadable.
Pansy smiled as Draco levitated the tray into the next room where their friends were waiting. She hadn't expected such restraint from Harry and Draco considering the affection that they readily displayed. She'd never known Draco to place such emotional value on physical intimacy. She wondered if he was fully aware of how hard he had fallen for Harry Potter.
"Completely," Luna assured him somberly. "The wrackspurts always know."
Of course, Harry seemed to be oblivious to Draco’s feelings and carried on as if he and Draco were best mates. The ex-Gryffindor blithely joked and laughed as if Draco wasn’t pining away like an idiot.
Harry's face suddenly seemed to crumble into a mask off grief. He buried his face in his hands, overwhelmed. Ron and Hermione stared at him in shock. They hadn't seen Harry break down like this before. Had he been carrying such a burden of sorrow all this time?
"Exhausted," Draco answered with a yawn. He pulled Harry down to rest next to him. "You're a brilliant shag Harry Potter."
"Move along," Ron snapped.
“It’s lovely,” Hermione said kindly, waving off Ron’s whining without sparing him a glance.
Draco and Harry were left to enjoy their company while food and hospitality were managed by their friends. Lucius managed to make polite conversation with his son, his gaze continuously drifting to Draco's stomach.
Generally, Draco took on a dominant role in their shared life. Harry was happy to allow it. Draco was the disciplinarian in the household while Harry was more nurturing. They loved their children fiercely and kept each other balanced.
Draco stilled, staring at Harry with wide eyes. "I- Are you serious?" he asked.
Draco frowned. "Yes, but maybe he didn't expect that to happen right away," he argued. "I have no idea how much of the toxins are in the tea. Perhaps his plan had been to make us ill and then overpower us. Maybe he was trying to kill us slowly." He chewed his lower lip thoughtfully. "He's no potions master. That is a fact."
"Good," Harry smiled, pleased with himself. "I've got your clothes hanging in the closet there with plenty of space for new things. I've got your books on the shelf over there." Harry went on pointing out the new arrangements to the bedroom, not realizing that Draco was starting at him in surprise.
Draco dipped his head slightly so that his lips brushed softly over Harry’s ear.  “You make me so happy Harry,” he whispered.
Draco sighed again but didn't argue. He allowed himself to be turned around and, to his delight, Harry proceeded to preen and coax his feathers back into place with gentle fingers. It was amazing how quickly it relaxed him.
Draco smiled.  “I’m glad that you like it,” he replied.
"Of course we did," Draco told her, sitting down in a chair next to her bed. "We even brought my mother and father to visit."
"Just calm down," Harry said, his heart feeling like it would break when Draco whimpered. Draco was so strong. He rarely showed this sort of weakness in front of anyone but Harry. He was always able to keep his composure until he was in a more private setting.
"We're not safe," Draco said shakily. "You know that, right? They're going to come after us. I can feel it."
"As if that matters," Draco replied with a short humorless laugh, keeping his back to Harry. "And it's my fault for becoming an Auror and allowing myself to be partnered with you."
"Mrs. Malfoy made the reservation," Blaise explained, walking toward the table. "She compensated them handsomely for allowing us to have the place to ourselves."
"Could we make arrangements for them?" Celia asked quietly.
Ron and Grant were still caught in the middle of the investigation of the dark wizards. They found the body of a wizard that had gone through a similar transformation, but he hadn't survived. Ron had been badly shaken by the sight of the mangled, bloody, winged corpse. It could have ended as badly for Harry and Draco.
"I'm so sorry," Ron said softly, his voice breaking. "I never thought... I had no idea that he'd do something like this."
"I don't hate you," Draco stated. "And as a Malfoy, I'm expected to make demands, though that's not why I'm here."
"What's this about?" Draco asked, a smile tugging at his lips.
"Can I tell you something without you laughing at me?" Draco asked quietly.
"You ogled my bird bits?" Draco squeaked, looking outraged and embarrassed. Ron snorted with laughter.
"I'll hold James," Ron said eagerly, holding his hands out. "You two should fly for a bit."
"That's... adorable," Pansy admitted, slipping closer to the trio on the floor. She sat down in a chair next to Draco and smiled down at him. "Hello Draco," she greeted him.
"I'm aware of that," Draco nodded. He turned to Celia.
Hermione sighed and took a little sip from her wine glass.  Then her eyes widened in shock and she spewed the wine back out, making Tracy Davis yelp and leap away with a scowl.
"I'll be right back," Grant nodded, stepping out of the room.
Harry made a low cooing sound, and kissed Draco softly. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, suddenly desperate for reassurance and comfort. Draco chirped softly, and Harry responded by pulling Draco into his lap.
"It's my baby," Harry said so softly that Draco had nearly missed it. Harry's eyes were wet and his lips trembled. "It's our baby." He sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Draco close.
The sound woke Draco, and he attempted to get out of the bed. He cried out in pain as his wings caused him to topple to the floor. Hermione rushed to his side, pouring the pain potion down his throat before attempting to move him.
A small sound made Draco hold his breath and look down. There was a crack in the egg shell. "Now?" he blurted out incredulously.
Harry stepped out of the floo and immediately caught sight of Headmistress McGonagall. "Welcome back," she said with a smile. "Come right in."
Harry giggled.
"This baby is a hybrid, like us," Harry explained, stroking lovingly over the slight swell of Draco's abdomen. "Apparently, that means hatching like a bird."
The feeling of rightness was absurd. But Harry suddenly felt too content to care.
Ron looked down at the pale blue egg in his arms. He could cradle it in one arm. It was quite large for an egg, but seemed a little small for a baby. Though he assumed the baby would be all curled up, like in a mother's womb. The egg was fairly light for it's size, as the baby was tiny. Soon, the baby would grow to fill the inside of the egg.
Narcissa pursed her lips, considering all the new information. Draco's wings twitched and fluttered as he waited for her response.
"Don't forget about the other surprise," Luna sang cheerfully.
"Alright..." Harry said uncertainly. "What do you suggest we do?"
Harry was frantic. He wanted to scream and throw things to relieve some of the tension pooling in his stomach. His wings never stopped moveing. They flapped, fluttered and trembled even while Harry forced himself to sit at Draco's side.
"I'm off as well," Luna announced.
Daniel giggled before holding his little hands out to Harry. "Mummy hold me?" he asked hopefully.
Hermione returned to find Harry cradling Draco in his arms. Harry was making a series of chirps, coos and trills, all while nuzzling Draco's cheek. Hermione smiled slightly, clearing her throat to announce her presence. Harry looked over at her and smiled so joyfully that Hermione's heart gave a happy leap.
"As if I ever stopped," Draco retorted. "I've been thinking about Harry shagging me all day."
Their friends came in and quietly admired the new egg. Draco fell asleep in the reverent silence, one arm cradling the egg and his head resting on Harry's outstretched arm.
"I will," Harry assured her.
"We don't want to get hurt," Draco said, his expression pained and anxious.
"Don't cry Baby," Harry cooed, kissing Draco's tears away.
A burst of laughter broke through Pansy's thoughts. Harry was shaking with mirth and Draco was smirking. Pansy shook her head. If nothing else, they seemed to have created a decent friendship. For the time being, that would do.
Draco nodded, returning to his meal.
"Weasley and Grant shouldn't be too far off," Draco said softly. Harry really hoped that he was right.
"You're a lunatic," Draco remarked, though the look he gave Harry was adoring.
"You look as if you are handling this well," Kingsley commented lightly.
Draco frowned and looked up.  A dozen sprigs of mistletoe were clumped together and hovering over his head.  Draco stared at the plants in shock before dropping his gaze to Harry.  He swallowed hard when he realized that Harry was suddenly much closer.
Draco smiled before his expression turned thoughtful. "Do you think you'd have ever wanted to be with me if this hadn't happened to us?" he asked quietly, his wings rustling slightly.
Their interaction didn't seem to draw much attention from the others. It wasn't as if they were being particularly flirtatious. But Pansy wanted to see each of them happy and it suddenly occurred to her that they could be happy together.
Harry smiled apologetically.  “You’re always so much fun to wind up,” he admitted.  “I felt a bit like I was being manipulated, so I thought I’d get back at you by driving you batty.  I had no idea that I was making you so upset.”  He shifted as if to reach for Draco, but resisted the impulse.  An irritable Draco was prone to throwing hexes.  “When I saw that you’d got out the mistletoe, I levitated all of it to you.  That way I could end the night by doing what we both want, but on my own terms.”
"Depression can have a profound effect on libido Harry," Draco said gently. "It's understandable." He paused, his eyes searching Harry's face. "Do you mean just with blokes?"
"How?" Grant asked, his voice full of shock.
His godchild. The thought brought a joyful smile to Ron's face. There was some unknown fluid smeared onto his shirt and hands from holding the egg, but he really didn't care. "Let's get you cleaned up," he murmured, sitting down on the floor and summoning a soft towel. He cradled the egg in his left arm while carefully wiping it clean.
Harry did as requested, wondering what Draco was up to. He moaned when Draco leaned forward, slowly taking Harry's cock into his mouth.
Draco gasped softly as he stepped into the bedroom he shared with Harry. Their nest had dark red rose petals scattered all over it. There were lit candles on the end tables and dressers. Soft music was floating through the room.
Harry started laughing. The sound had a slightly hysterical edge to it. He doubled over, shaking his head as chortles spilled out of him.
"A common misconception," Rita responded waving her hand dismissively.
"A bird?" Ron asked, bewildered. "Why would those nutters try to turn them into birds?"
"Fine," Pansy conceded, waving her hand dismissively at him. "Weasley here helped me to get the last of the sweets. I've just got to pay for it now." She hurried over to the store clerk, leaving Draco with the two ex-Gryffindors.
"The Chosen One is a cuddler," Pansy chuckled finally. "I probably should have known that."
"Now?" Harry asked, his eyes wide.
"Excellent. I'll come round and bring lunch. How's that?" Draco asked, looking at Harry expectantly.
Narcissa cleared her throat suddenly and straightened her spine. "Right," she muttered absently to herself. "We'll need to buy Draco some new clothes and supplies for the baby." She looked around the nursery in appraisal. "Is there anything else you'd like for the nursery?"
Harry coaxed Draco to lean back, allowing Harry to suck at Draco's nipples while Draco continued to roll his hips. Draco was nearly incoherent with pleasure. Harry pulled him upright, wrapping one hand around Draco's cock.
"Daco good boy?" Draco chimed in eagerly.
"Draco's just over done it today," Harry said lightly. "Nothing serious. He's just very sore. Maybe next time he'll listen to me," he added, his hands still rubbing in soothing circles.
Harry nodded. "But it's even better than you think," he informed her. "I'll give you an exclusive on a very big story."
Draco could have kicked himself for getting caught staring. "I'm fine. Just thinking," he responded turning back to the telly.
"It's a plug," Harry managed to croak, his face heated.
Ron apparated to Harry and Draco's house as quickly as he could manage. He found Draco pacing living room slowly, rocking the egg in his arms and talking softly. He glanced up and smiled at Ron.
"So... this child is, in fact, from both of you?" Rita asked.
"That's why you're going to be very, very gentle with me," Draco said with a grin. His eyes followed Harry's every move as Harry disrobed.
The couple soared through the sky, delighting in the freedom of it. They hadn't flown much during the winter and they'd missed it. When they'd worn themselves out, they sprawled out in the grass, letting the sun warm their feathers.
They were still warm.
"Yeah," Harry replied, sounding breathless. He cleared his throat. "This is great."
"He is," Draco confirmed with a grin.
"You do that and then we'll eat," Harry said, pulling out some plates.
"You made a sort of weird chirping sound in your sleep," Ron informed Harry helpfully.
"That's private Pansy," Draco snapped.
Pansy rolled her eyes again. "I fail to see how this makes me a tart," she drawled. "Just answer the question."
"The shell feels solid," Harry said proudly. "So it'll be soon."
"The wards," Harry responded tersely. "Someone is trying to breach my wards." He pressed a kiss to Draco's forehead. "I need to check it out."
"They're surrounded by nargles," Luna added.
"Don't worry," Draco said with a dismissive wave of his hand. "We'll be going to Hogwarts, but we'll avoid all of the students. You can even bring your invisibility cloak."
Draco sat up and guided Harry to sit with his back to the side of the nest. Then he straddled Harry's thighs, running his fingers over Harry's torso.
Dinner had been delicious with no awkward questions about eating chicken. Though Ron was pleased to throw out as many bird-related puns as he could. Draco always did his best to look very annoyed, but it didn't always work.
Draco's voice pulled Harry from sleep. He blinked and lifted his head to peer toward the door.
"Perhaps you should drink less if you feel it's a problem," Narcissa noted, dabbing at her lips primly.
"You- You told Pansy before me?" Harry asked, sounding hurt.
"I think we're getting close," Draco said. The egg had gotten heavier and if you really focus, you can feel the baby nudging against the shell."
"I'll call you whatever you like Draco," Harry said with a grin.
"I- Thank you," Draco said softly. He marvelled at Ron's knowing gaze as the red-head smiled slightly.
Harry moved around to face Draco. Draco looked sad and frustrated. "I'm sorry," Harry said softly.
Harry bit down hard on lip to prevent himself from laughing. He wordlessly handed Draco another present to unwrap, glancing up briefly to wink at Narcissa. She shook her head in amusement.
"A bit," Draco admitted, smirking at their surprised expressions. "I visit the children periodically, especially right before Christmas."
"It's private," Harry objected petulantly.
"So how was work Ron?" Draco asked, taking another bite of his eggroll.
The war against Voldemort had ended, and the Wizarding World was better for it. But recovery was easier for some than others. Draco Malfoy had been on the losing side, though it hadn't exactly been by choice. It had been a relief when Harry Potter had finished the Dark Lord off.
Draco scowled. "I never said we didn't want to," he retorted. "We're taking our time getting there. It's Harry. We only get one first time together, and it's important to me."
Draco gave the strange object a dubious look but didn't comment. He finished setting the dining room table as Harry levitated the food into the dining room.
Draco ate his biscuit happily, ignoring everyone in the room for a moment. When he was done, he looked up his see Harry finishing up his snack as well. "Dat," Draco said, pointing at Harry.
"I'm sure Grant has been messing up my progress this whole time," Room growled. "Maybe it'll be better to arrest him and get it out of the way. At least then I could move forward without him messing things up. "It's too dangerous for me to just follow him. And taking a team will be too obvious." He returned to his meal sullenly. He shot Pansy a tense smile when she patted his hand consolingly.
It was a bit silly to worry about that though. Draco had other lovers in the past, and they were completely irrelevant now. Harry was what mattered. Harry and the life that they'd stumbled into.
"Ron-"
Draco chuckled softly taking Harry's hand and allowing himself to be pulled close. They swayed and twirled, carefully keeping to the center of the room. It wouldn't do to spoil the mood by catching their wings on fire with the candles.
"Nah, I'm just winging it." This was said with an obnoxious waggle of eyebrows.
Rob turned his gaze to Draco. Sure enough, Draco had wings as well, but his were a brilliant white.
"Who is shagging?" Harry asked, coming to Draco's side.
"I'll say."
"Potter inspired all this," Pansy explained, nodding toward the bags that Draco still held.
Maddie sniffled, and Draco gave her hand a comforting squeeze. "She doesn't think she can take me and the babies. We have to be split up." Sad little tears rolled down her cheeks.
Harry turned his head and peeked up at Draco, another shy smile curling his lips. Unable to resist, Draco kissed him again but pulled away before Ron could complain.
"Are you feeling better?" Harry asked softly, sliding his hand from Draco's stomach around to his lower back.
It was almost more than Harry could take. To think that his ex-rival had looked at Harry and seen such an overflow of love despite their tumultuous past... For Draco to be so inspired by Harry was humbling and Harry felt honored. Without consideration for the others, Harry reached up to pull Draco's face close for a tender kiss.
"Take the deal," Ron said, before Rita could sneer. The interview itself would be worth it. You want this exclusive."
"It is," Draco agreed. "But what's got you all worked up?"
"It's our room," Harry insisted, reaching out and taking Draco's hands. "You can keep your room if you like, if you'd like time on your own. But, I want to share this room with you." Harry paused, biting his lower lip nervously. "I want this to be your home. Not just you staying here while your father is being an arse."
"Yes Auntie Mione," James agreed, pressing a quick kiss to Draco's cheek before he was placed back on the floor.
"Harry does!" Draco blurted out in frustration. Then his eyes widened in horror. "Oh my... Damn it Pansy!" Then Draco was swearing and ranting at Pansy furiously, his cheeks flushed with anger and embarrassment.
Draco hummed, taking a final bite of his dinner. "Going out is nice," he allowed. "But I enjoy our time together. If I didn't, I wouldn't have stayed."
Harry stood very still, allowing Rita Skeeter to look him over carefully. They were in a private room at the Hogs Head for their meeting. Ron was sitting quietly and looking at Rita expectantly.
Draco leapt into the air, flapping his wings hard. He laughed as he rose watching Harry follow him into the sky. They circled each other, laughing joyfully and clasping their hands together. Unable to restrain himself, Draco pulled Harry into a kiss. Their wings flapped hard, keeping them up as their tongues tangled together.
“It’s a little funny,” Harry murmured with a grin.
Movie nights had become much easier to tolerate as the weeks went by. Harry was grateful that he could relax and enjoy the company of his friends again. The noise was much less bothersome and conversation was easy again.
Harry hated the idea. He didn't want body guards, but he didn't want people staring, taking pictures or trying to get his attention in outlandish ways. Eventually they would have to leave the house, so it was sensible to have protection.
Ron looked between them uncomfortably. "Davis and Harper said that you two needed me for a case," he said. "I suppose that was just an excuse to get me to come in here and catch you two being stupid." He paused, smirking at Harry. "So... Any particular reason you were stroking Malfoy's nipples?" Ron asked.
Three days later, Draco still wasn't feeling well. His panic had subsided, but he was strangely restless. Harry looked on in bewilderment as Draco rearranged furniture, cleaned and recleaned various surfaces and checked the wards around the house frequently. He would often stop and keep still for several moments with his eyes closed before he would have off Harry's concern and resume his previous activity.
Draco frowned. "I think I'm offended again," he muttered.
Draco chirped sullenly in reply, but remained still. Then he huffed in annoyance for making such a ridiculous sound. And then Harry's fingers were back to soothing Draco's frazzled mind.
Harry didn't seem bothered at all by Draco's reaction. He only seemed to concern himself with Draco's comfort. Fighting against his instincts would only make Draco more restless and unhappy. So, he kept a watchful eye on his precious offspring while he ate his dinner.
"You've also developed a..." Hermione trailed off uncomfortably. "It's a cloaca. It's an opening for a bird's digestive and reproductive tracts. They're fairly well concealed. Almost like a second navel."
Ginny walked over and handed Harry and Draco glasses of champagne. Ginny was usually out of town playing Quidditch with the Holyhead Harpies, so they didn't see her very often. As a result, Draco was still a little wary of her. She had dated Harry after all, and Draco was a little possessive. He'd never admit to that of course.
The people seemed rather unwilling to comply until Hermione and Ginny slipped through the crowd to flank Harry and Draco. "Let us pass," Hermione said coolly.
"Well, there you go," Pansy said with a nod. "You're having a girl."
Harry climbed into the nest, drawing Draco into another kiss. He slid his hands down Draco's body, grateful that the blond had been so eager to get naked.
Predictably, Ron blushed. "Well, got to find the right woman for that," he hedged.
"I thought you were making chicken," Ron said, filling his plate with food. He yelped when Hermione kicked him under the table. She gave him a pointed look and gave a miniscule shake of her head.
Hermione giggled, hugging Draco again. "Draco Malfoy-Potter," she said, knowing that he adored the name, "we love you. And we love Harry and the boys. I'm so excited for you. You've only made today even better."
After Narcissa left, Draco returned to the nursery. The painted sky was dark and glittering with stars. It was hard to believe that there would soon be a baby sleeping in the crib.
"So very true," Pansy agreed, coming over to join them. "You seem very happy."
Harry watched in fascination as Draco ate a slice of treacle tart. The blonde was perched on a bar stool by the kitchen counter, humming in pleasure as he licked his spoon.
Draco kept his pace slow, wanting to prolong their lovemaking. He had been ridiculously on edge since the moment Harry had got on his hands and knees. He reached around and wrapped his hand around Harry's cock, stroking languidly in time to his own gentle thrusting.
In the next moment, Harry had vanished their clothes with a wave of his wand and pulled Draco down onto the bed. Harry stroked Draco's skin gently, suddenly in much less of a hurry. The abrupt change of pace might have infuriated Draco, but he couldn't complain when he looked at Harry's expression of adoration. They made love slowly, chest to chest and kissing deeply. Harry felt such a strong surge of love as he climaxed that tears spilled out of his eyes. Draco smiled tiredly and kissed the tears away.
Ron froze in shock.
"Young," Ron responded with a grin. Pansy snorted and rolled her eyes.
~~HPDM~~
"Sure you were," Harry replied sarcastically. "What do you want?"
The moment Kingsley and Robards stepped out, Ron closed the door. He gave Harry a pointed look, nodding toward Draco. Harry didn't need further encouragement. He rushed to Draco's side, not caring that Robert Grant was still standing there.
"Bloody hell," Draco panted, not bothering to untangle his arms and legs from Harry. "That was brilliant."
"No Pansy."
"Hello," Draco responded, the L sound rolling off his tongue exaggeratedly. Ron chuckled at the sound, earning a dimpled grin from the blond.
Draco was silent for a moment. He looked down at his shopping bags pensively. It was getting late and he still need to put together the gift baskets so they could be delivered the next day. "Would you be willing to give me his address?" he asked cautiously.
