But after about three days, Scorpius fell asleep while they were visiting. He had his head in Harry’s lap, his feet curled up on the hard plastic chair, and Harry let his hand rest on Scorpius’ blond head.
“How did it go?” asked Pansy. They were in the Oxford Botanical Gardens. Pansy was eating an ice cream.
But when Misty opened the window to let in the owl, it became clear that the letter was a howler. Draco and Misty stared at it in dismay.
“Yes, Miss,” said Misty. She turned to look at Draco. “Miss Astoria’s father is the principle investor.”
“I’ll take him,” said another voice; a safe, familiar voice, one Draco trusted. Harry knelt beside him and Draco leant into his arm. “Is he okay?” asked Harry.
He grew so hot that Harry worried he should take him to the hospital. But when he called 111, the NHS non-emergency number, the patient woman on the phone told Harry that Draco just needed fluids and rest.
Harry hadn’t realised until now what a difference it made, to see Draco dressed in the splendour he had always worn at school. It made him handsomer, of course, but that was only part of it. He looked calmer. Harry realised that Draco must have been frightened the Ministry would keep his family’s fortune, that he would no longer be rich, and that
Although the others protested, Pansy was adamant, going so far as to drag Blaise out by his feet. (Astoria helped.)
“I didn’t want to hurt you. That’s not why the spell worked. I just wanted the spell to work, whatever it was, so you wouldn’t hurt
“Look, Malfoy’s all right, yeah?” said Ron. “And you and he and Cassie have a good thing going. You just don’t want to mess it up for a quick shag, you know?”
“If you’re done having your little freak-out, I’m going back to the flat. I have to wrestle Cassie into a party dress and I anticipate that force will be necessary.”
“Hi!” he said, when he saw Harry. He had his sleeves rolled up and his hands were sudsy. He used his forearm to push his hair out of his face, looking exhausted. “Are you all right? I didn’t realise it would turn into such a rager, are you having a terrible time? Was it torture?”
Harry refocused on the subject at hand, and not on Malfoy’s chin-length hair, which was loose around his face and had dried slightly wavy. Cedric. Cedric Diggory.
Scorpius cuddled into Harry. Malfoy’s eyes darted towards them and back at the screen. He looked as if he was sitting on straight-backed chair, not a sofa: his hands fidgeting on his knees, feet planted on the floor, his posture impeccable. Harry suspected he wasn’t watching the movie any more than Harry was.
“I always liked how they looked, so I thought I’d buy one,” said Malfoy. He adjusted his jacket. “Actually, I bought four. I don’t really understand muggle money but I think, from how the shop people behaved, that I was quite extravagant.”
“It’s an absolutely insane story,” said Draco sleepily. “I can’t believe you don’t talk about it all the time.”
Draco had quite a nice smile—the one he did when he was with Teddy, not that horrible smirk he did when he thought he was being clever and cutting. Harry ran his hands through his hair.
Draco’s room always seemed quite nice, on screen. The rest of the flat, however, was not. The front hall was cramped. There was mould on the walls. It was like the worst kind of student accommodation.
The Canons had taken Harry back, but he was badly out of practice. He spent all day on the quidditch pitch, trying to get to know his fellow team members. He was conscious that they kept comparing him unfavourably to Old Harry, who had apparently been some kind of saint of patience and compassion, and also clearly a gullible idiot who had married
patently untrue,” said Draco, returning to his dishwashing. “Listen, I have to go soon, but I’ll come back in the morning and clean up. Ron said he’d help, you won’t have to do a thing.”
“Yeah, well, he makes Draco happy, so he could be a brick wall and I still wouldn’t say shit,” said Ron.
Draco didn’t have a very clear memory of the night before, but the fragments that came back to him were quite enough to fill him with shame. Extra shame. More shame than his usual portion. He remembered
“Yes, it’s a terrible party, hasn’t everyone become boring all of a sudden, there’s a new club in Berlin that’s just opened, I hear they have an enchanted polar bear bouncer—”
“Harry, no—” said Hermione, a split second too late. Draco’s face twisted up in silent anguish as the cruciatus curse hit him.
They hadn’t talked about the kiss in the pub. It had been weeks now. Harry felt far too guilty to bring it up, and he suspected that it would have made Draco deeply uncomfortable if he had.
With a different voice, they would have ignored him, but he speaks like them, so they don’t. Class is different among muggles, but privilege always recognises itself.
It was awkward when Blaise came to the flat. It broke Blaise’s heart to see Pansy, they all knew that, although none of them sympathised. All the same, it meant a lot to Draco that Blaise still came whenever Draco called. Still sat patiently in Draco’s tiny bedroom, listening to Draco’s theories and helping Draco weed out the crazy from the good.
In any case, he’d gone to LA in the hope of a cure, not for self-acceptance. There had been a weird werewolf pandemic in the Hollywood Hills in the 60s, and consequently the Healers there had discovered all sorts of advanced treatments. But Harry had gone because there was an old crystal witch who thought she had found a cure, a way to reverse that bone crunching moment when he had been bitten. Two years he had drifted through LA’s wide, dry boulevards, hating every moment, hope keeping him bitter. And her cure
“At ease, soldier,” said Draco, chucking Cassie on the nose and disappearing once more under the voluminous folds of Harry’s invisibility cloak.
“I’ve worn button-down shirts before,” said Harry, bemused, as Draco touched him all over—Harry’s biceps dipping under the ironed cotton sleeves, his chest revealed by the undone top button, his neck against the slightly starched collar.
sex. Except in Harry’s head, where they had sex all the time. So actually, maybe Draco was onto something, if that was what he thought.
“You don’t have to ask,” said Adelaide, but he always did, before they did anything serious. Always moved slowly towards her, and stopped to ask if she was okay.
I didn’t know that!” Scorpius’ eyes widened and brightened, and suddenly Harry wondered if he ever heard anything good about his father. He hadn’t seemed too surprised to hear him referred to as “Death Eater scum”.
“Oh!” Scorpius looked up at him with shining eyes. Then he seemed to pull himself together. “But you can’t buy me an owl.”
Harry spent the next few days dreading the full moon. It was true, what Malfoy had said: transforming gave him terrible anxiety, not just on the day, but for almost a week afterwards. The entire experience was a painful ordeal. When he was reduced to his wolf brain, he panicked until the potion knocked him out. It was probably no more than fifteen minutes, but it always felt like an eternity, in which he searched desperately for someone to help, and never found anyone.
Harry was going over some old case files in his sitting room when Lamorak stepped out of his fireplace.
“Deadly. He’s fun. And sort of wistful. I think he needs rescuing.” Draco sighed. He met up with Harry, as Lamorak, a few times a week. Harry laughed at his jokes; complimented him; confided in him. He had taken Draco’s advice and written a long list of the things that made him happy. He and Draco—Lamorak—had gone through it together, figuring out ways that Harry could incorporate joy into his life.
Harry suddenly realised what Draco reminded him of: Dobby, in second year, trying to give Harry clues when he knew one slip of the tongue would cause him untold suffering.
“Sorry,” he said, turning away, as if he were ashamed of himself. “Sorry. I just keep thinking of Misty.”
Then he would think of Scorpius’ pitiful letter, of the men who had left Malfoy for dead last spring, and something in his rib cage would clench painfully.
Every suspect Harry investigated was innocent. It was an impossible case, and although Draco never complained (well—he complained in a way that was more comedy than complaint), Harry knew it troubled him. He was, after all, largely confined to the house. Harry overheard him talking about it seriously with Hermione.
“Do you mind if I…?” asked Harry, setting the textbook down and getting to his feet. Draco hesitated for a moment, then gave up.
“Oh,” said Harry. This hadn’t occurred to him. Watching Draco and Teddy had made Harry feel calmer than he had in a long, long time. There was something soothing about the way they clearly loved each other, despite all the good reasons for them not to. It was like a physical representation of post-war healing. It had sapped Harry of his anger.
Harry was forced to admit that green was his colour when he tried the jumper on. He looked… well, Harry hadn’t thought he could look like that. Draco stood next to him in the mirror. They looked good together; Draco in his crisp white shirt, Harry in his soft green jumper.
The moment he turned into a kitten, the feeling seemed to drop him. (That was always how it felt—Harry didn’t have feelings. Feelings had
“You need—” said Malfoy. He shuffled to his knees, took Harry’s hand, and licked the tip of Harry’s index finger. He did it so quickly and in so business-like a manner that for a moment, Harry was fooled into believing it was a perfectly normal thing to do. But by the time he had remembered that it was not, in fact, acceptable to go around licking other people’s fingers, Malfoy was already back on his side of the sofa.
So he allowed the tailor to measure him and cast spells over him and make him an entirely new wardrobe. It cost him all the money he’d anticipated living off during the Christmas holidays, and he couldn’t understand why he’d let himself be press-ganged into it.
to try it!” and they pulled Harry and Draco out of the loo into the kitchen, where they made Harry and Draco taste a bizarre concoction they’d created, which Harry suspected was largely vodka and salad dressing. And Harry didn’t bring it up with Draco again, whatever
“Let her do what she wants because she makes her own choices about her body,” said Draco gloomily. “But I’d hate it.” He winced. “I
Draco couldn’t stop the helpless smile. He never could, whenever anyone brought up Harry. It went further than that, actually: Ellie had mentioned Prince Harry the other day, and Draco had grinned like an idiot, because that was Harry’s name.
Draco pretended, just for a second, that he was Harry Potter, and didn’t have a thousand things to be ashamed of. He was just trying to formulate some bold, Potterish reply when Astoria spoke.
Harry considered this. It was proving more difficult not to kiss Draco than he had anticipated. And he couldn’t kiss Draco, so maybe it would be best if they just didn’t see each other, until this crush had run its course.
Harry’s finger seemed to move of its own accord. It slid down the side of Draco’s nose, feeling the smooth skin turn into rough scar on his cheek, and then it followed the scar down, down to Draco’s chin, which Draco lifted slightly, just slightly, with a barely audible sigh, and then it slid over the sharp ridge of Draco’s jawline, still following the place where Harry had once cracked him open, down Draco’s neck, slowly, slowly—Draco was holding his breath, so was Harry, probably, he wasn’t sure—and then the scar blighted its way over Draco’s fine collar bone, and Harry followed it, reaching the neck of Draco’s t-shirt—he hesitated—
It took Harry two days to feel human again, but when he did, he felt better than he had in a long time.
, but centuries of obligation weighing down on you. The fear of being a weak link. Of breaking a chain. In his most clear-hearted moments, Draco didn’t blame Blaise at all. He tried to carry that sympathy and understanding with him when he saw Blaise in person.
“Tempting, but Shark wouldn’t like it,” said the man. The girl stroked Harry’s face, and Harry whined.
That night, Draco got into bed with Harry the moment he felt reasonably sure everyone else was asleep.
They kissed. When their lips touched, Harry was ready for the anguish. He had been feeling it slowly all morning, and if it crested in him like a wave of agony, it wasn’t surprising, because that was how endings felt.
“Yeah, I’d say the war is still pretty relevant to my life, given that— you know what? Forget it. Cassie, it was nice to meet you.”

“No?” asked Timothy, innocently. “Only looking for a serious relationship with me? It’s faster than I wanted, Harry, but I’ll marry you, if you insist.”
“I’ll—I don’t want to make you uncomfortable—I could sit with you until you fall asleep? Like I used to, in Mysteries—is that weird?”
“She wanted to put a whole paragraph about how she would be making people beautiful if they would just step inside, please, but I stopped her,” said Astoria.
“Adorable,” said Adelaide. “Fiona’s going to be so disappointed. I think she wanted to lose her virginity to you.”
“I don’t know,” said Malfoy, carefully, which Harry took to mean that Malfoy hadn’t been told yet if his assets would be returned to him. He didn’t look upset about it, only rather vague and distracted.
“I haven’t had a chance to…” said Draco. “It’s all been quite, Adelaide-heavy. But I was wondering, it would help me figure out—if I knew more precisely what it is that you want.”
“Stop! Stay seated!” said Harry quickly. Malfoy drooped, his dirty hair falling into his face. “What the hell was that?”
“I,” started Harry, although he wasn’t sure what he was planning to say. He knew he couldn’t defend himself. He’d felt awful about how he treated Draco for years now.
“How are you feeling?” asked Draco at the same time as Harry said, “You were quite into me as a wolf.”
“We could probably still—” said Harry, going to the bin and looking uneasily into it. Draco’s hand came to rest on his arm.
“Good, thanks. Hope you’re not working too much,” said Harry, because it seemed like the most polite way to express
He was more nervous than ever by the time movie night came round. He had sent a quick reply to Scorpius, assuring him he’d be there, and not heard anything back.
that, do you believe them?” asked Draco. Harry shook his head. Draco’s mouth jerked into a smile and Harry was suddenly aware of how very, very close their lips were.
“The Dark Lord is not interested in your sexuality, so long as it is not a weakness,” said his father. “Do you know what would make it a weakness, Draco?”
He didn’t try anything with Harry again. He brought a different person home every night. Harry insisted that they had to stay for breakfast. Quite apart from anything else, it made for entertaining mornings.
The next day, he got a letter from Malfoy. It was delivered by Hogarth, rather than by floo, as their letters had been so far. Harry felt a little apprehensive as he opened it, sure that it would berate him for what had happened in the kitchen, but it made no mention of that.
The 7th year Gryffindor excused themselves and left, only to be replaced, almost instantaneously, by an incandescent Draco Malfoy.
“Hermione and Kingsley and I were up all night, trying to figure out what to do. The best we could come up with was to, um, pretend we’ve reinstated the bond.”
They skirted through the shadows, avoiding everyone, several times darting into empty classrooms to wait for loud groups of people to rampage past them. It took them fifteen minutes to reach the Cloisters, but, as Malfoy had predicted, they were empty. The stone courtyard was silent and serene. Goyle deposited Narcissa gently on the cobbles beneath the lone, graceful tree at the centre of the courtyard.
Malfoy glanced at the clock. He didn’t have a watch. Harry guiltily noticed that he was still wearing the joggers and red jumper Harry had given him on his first day—Harry hadn’t thought to give him anything new. Why hadn’t Malfoy said anything? Then Harry remembered—he had told Malfoy not to complain, hadn’t he?
A month before Draco was due to return to England, Pansy overdosed. Blaise found her, took her to St Mungo’s. Sat by her bedside with Harry and Seamus, perfectly silent. It was unsettling to see him so serious. When he spoke, it was like someone else had seized control of him. He was polite and unobtrusive and distracted, his eyes glued to her pale face. Once, he looked at Harry.
Sometimes, Harry caught himself wondering if this was what it would be like to date Draco. Then he reminded himself of the awful things Malfoy had done, and the mirage ended.
“Eternal damnation,” said Draco. He had an awful look on his face, as if he could see what he was talking about, as if he
If Harry had not known before that Draco felt remorse, the anguished expression that crossed his face now would have been enough for Harry to be sure of it.
“No plans to hurt him,” said Harry, holding his hands up placatingly. The elf lifted an arched eyebrow and slammed the door in his face.
Harry had tried apologising for sectumsempra, once, thinking that maybe that was the reason for Malfoy’s persistent coldness. He had cornered Malfoy in the kitchen of Malfoy and Neville’s house, while everyone else was playing a high-octane game of
But in those first months after the Easter holidays, when he had alienated all the people who loved him, there was Draco Malfoy. Harry could be as nasty as he liked, to Draco Malfoy. And Malfoy was nasty right back. It started with Harry pushing Malfoy against a wall and calling him worthless. It ended with Harry fucking Malfoy fiercely from behind in the quidditch locker rooms.
“Okay,” said Scorpius. He turned tearfully towards Ron and stuck out his hand. “Hello, I’m Scorpius Malfoy.”
“I know you wouldn’t have,” said Harry. They stood a few feet from each other, and Harry knew he was staring too hard, but he couldn’t stop.
Dumbledore had been dead when he fell. Draco knew that, intellectually. He tipped forward further than he had meant to and his heart jumped into his throat as he saved himself.
. He flew, light-winged, into the midnight dark. Thin moonbeams shot down like arrows, and there was only earth and air, and he climbed high into the cool, comfortable sky, soaring, twirling, falling and gliding, keen-eyed and light and unfettered.
Draco frowned, fiddling with the tie around his arm. Harry had several times mentioned that he didn’t mind about the Mark, but this only made Draco change the subject, not the habit.
Draco lifted the cloak a bit more, revealing Cassie. She was curled up in his lap, her eyes red from crying. She glared at Harry defiantly.
She almost never talked about her life before Tertius, but he understood that her father, a wizard, had walked out on her Muggle mother without ever telling her about magic. The mother had left Adelaide with some friends when Adelaide was ten and never returned. From there, Adelaide was passed around from family to family, no one wanting her—until Tertius.
“Now you’re just looking for things to apologise for,” said Draco. Their noses were touching, their lips only inches from each other. Harry could scarcely breathe. Draco’s hair was silky in his hand. He wanted to find out all of Draco’s textures.
“I should go,” said Klaus. He was wearing nothing but an old quidditch jersey of Draco’s, and his penis peeped innocently out from beneath the hem.
Draco shuffled forward so that the tips of his shoes stuck out over the edge. Harry didn’t tug him back. He wanted to, but he didn’t.
“One of those famous, 16-year-old New York cab drivers,” remarked a woman wearing an enormous headdress featuring a yellow submarine, a small-scale model of Guantanamo Bay, and a sign that said “America sucks”. Draco ignored her.
Harry had missed him so much. Even just seeing him was a relief, like water to a parched throat. Harry didn’t speak much, letting Draco and Adelaide chat away, mocking each other and bringing up in-jokes and talking about films Harry had never seen or even heard of. Harry didn’t care. It was only a new side of Draco to fall in love with.
“Nothing,” said Harry, surprised. “I’m not going to tell Draco what to do. And Hermione’s right, he and I can’t start anything until the end of the year. I have too much power over him for it to be healthy.”
“You can… tell me, if you want…” said Draco, and Harry suddenly knew what was making Draco so nervous.
Malfoy cast him a strange, unguarded look, and Harry wondered suddenly what had happened to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. He knew they must be dead because Scorpius had said he and his father were the last two Malfoys, but he wasn’t sure how or when it had happened.
Harry couldn’t stop the smile that was spreading not just across his face, but through him, somehow. No one had ever called him beautiful.
“Working out,” said Pansy. She hovered by the window, all black hair and snagged tights. Blaise seemed, for a moment, as if he wanted to go to her, then went purposefully to the sofa instead.
“I mean,” said Draco, “he was so fucked up after the war. It was ironic, really, that he was trying to work through it all with
“Hey,” said Harry, going to stand behind him. Draco didn’t answer. Harry wasn’t sure he could. He wove his arms around Draco’s chest and pulled him close. Draco was stiff, and then suddenly he turned to face Harry and balled his hands up in the front of Harry’s robes.
Draco didn’t say anything. Steven had long ago made it a rule that Draco had to answer his questions, but this didn’t seem to be one.
Buying the cottage. Their wedding. All the work Draco had put into the garden. All the happiness he had brought Harry, that Harry had brought him. The way Draco still steeled himself sometimes before walking into a room where Harry was, even though they’d been together for years, as if he thought that Harry would stop loving him if he didn’t put his best foot forward. Their last morning together, when Draco had rolled his eyes at Harry for calling jam “one of his five a day” and said that it was a cosmic injustice that Harry was still so in shape. Harry kissed him quickly on the cheek and left the house. Draco pretended to look annoyed, but when Harry was out of the room, his expression changed, falling into a dreamy smile. He followed Harry with his eyes as Harry walked down the garden path, broom in hand.
. But for the last month, Draco’s nose had been too blocked up for him to be able to taste anything, and more recently, he had stopped being able to keep food down. His appetite was shot, and he felt nauseous when he even thought of eating. So Pansy ate ice cream, and Draco went through his Bucket List, crossing off all the food-based ones with a heavy heart.
“He fucking does, mate,” said Ron. “That whole thing with the crisps? When Mad Eye came up? And the way he
“I used to think you wanted to kill me,” he said. “In sixth year. I thought, I probably deserved it.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” he asked. “With everyone else you’re some kind of angel among men, but when it comes to me, you just…” He shook his head, burying his face in his hands again. “Fuck.”
But mainly, he went because he knew Malfoy needed him. Malfoy had no one else to talk to properly about Scorpius, and Harry liked being there for him. When Scorpius won a Potions prize, he and Malfoy went to the pub. Harry listened patiently as Malfoy explained all the details of the potion Scorpius had made; what could have gone wrong, how Malfoy had primed him for success by teaching him potions basics before Scorpius went to Hogwarts. When Malfoy told him, in an offhand sort of way, that he didn’t even know what the Ravenclaw common room looked like, Harry described it to him.
They stood in the Cloisters for some unnamable amount of time before Draco tilted his head up to look at the sky.
Luna gave him a tight hug. It hurt. Pansy had bandaged up the bleeding scars on his chest but they were still sore.
Cassie looked appropriately cowed, and scampered out of the room, pausing to wave at Harry before disappearing.
I’ll wee on you!” to which Ron responded by waggling his eyebrows suggestively. Goyle was telling anyone who would listen that the secret to his guacamole was Tabasco sauce. Seamus looked very gloomy about his beak and the thick white feathers on his head, although Harry personally thought he’d got off easy: the wings, at least, were gone. Ginny and Luna cuddled together in a tiny armchair that was certainly not big enough for two people.

Draco didn’t stay for the lessons anymore. At first he had sat in the corner, scribbling formulas in a notebook and absent-mindedly chipping in when Harry mentioned something about Potions. “She can be a bit nervy around strange men,” he explained. But after a few weeks it was apparent that Draco’s presence was superfluous. Adelaide was slightly anxious around Harry, but only because she wanted to impress him so badly.
They stood outside the school building. Harry had gone to the headmaster, Confunded him into releasing Adelaide’s three closest friends, and brought them all out to join Draco outside the front steps.
“No. Yes. I don’t know,” said Draco. It was difficult to tell the truth when you didn’t know what it was.
They would be returning to Hogwarts in a few days. Draco felt raw and unstable after the drunk-Potter-hitting-on-him-and-then-almost-sending-him-back-to-Azkaban-because-he-felt-embarrassed incident, and because he knew Hogwarts was going to be awful.
Then he went out on a barge on the Thames with his friends and drank himself into a stupor by half past ten.
“I thought…” she said, in a small voice, looking suddenly so very, very young. “I thought he seemed nice.”
in his chest. He was tempted to label it anxiety, but really, if he thought about it, it was closer to
Draco came on screen at their appointed time and launched straight into sex. Harry came quickly, but instead of making some snarky remark, Draco just pushed his hair out of his eyes, smiled a tight smile, and said “Lovely, what shall we do next?”
Harry smoked a lot of weed, on days when he checked his phone. Actually, he smoked a lot of weed, point blank. He gave speeches about elf rights and prison conditions and Muggleborn opportunities, he gave interviews and posed for photographs, and then he went home to his pitiless, empty flat, smoked weed, and tried not to think about Draco.
“I hear explosions. In my head. They wake me up,” said Draco. He didn’t know why he said it. He often found himself saying things he hadn’t meant to say, these days. He was losing his grip on himself. It was a fucking disaster.
“Shut up,” said Potter, moving his leg sharply away from Draco’s. Draco felt his heart constrict. Did Potter still really think he was plotting some kind of evil?
Harry bent his head and rested it against the bed frame. Draco didn’t like it when people showed how upset they were, so he formulated his face.
But a rogue misery came and reminded Draco that something was wrong. Harry would never do this. Something must have happened. He tore his mouth away from Harry’s. Harry whimpered.
“It’s a relief,” said Draco. He had been so worried that Andromeda would not forgive his mother as readily as she had forgiven him. But Andromeda had been more than open to the prospect of reconciliation. It took a weight off Draco’s mind. He hated to think of his mother at his funeral with no one to lean on. He knew Pansy would do all she could to comfort her, but Pansy was already doing too much. He could hear her quiet sobs through the thin walls of the house. He never mentioned them.
Draco broke away from Harry and knelt in front of Narcissa’s grave. He touched the tombstone with both hands, but Harry couldn’t see his face.
Harry sat, and after a brief hesitation, Draco sat too, sideways, at the other end of the sofa. Harry tried to think of something to say that wasn’t “I love you.” He was not feeling very inspired. “I love you” seemed like the only possible option. Thankfully, Draco spoke.
“It’s not a big deal,” said Draco, searching Potter’s face for some clue as to what was going on in his head. “Don’t—be all weird about it.”
“Oh, James. Very well. As King and Emperor of Happiness, I’ll give you the highly coveted secret.” His face became rather somber. “You have to find something you’re good at and make people happy with it.”
Draco came back with the collar. Harry sat up and bared his neck, but Draco wouldn’t look him in the eye, no matter how hard Harry stared.
He didn’t try to talk to Harry. He ran his hands over Harry’s back, through his hair, kissed his forehead and his eyebrows. “Darling,” he said.
Harry explained, and explained, and explained, and it was impossible to know whether Draco understood because he was so quiet.
“No. You’re not any of those things we mistook you for. But you’re still insufferable, Harry, because do you know what
Draco, rather predictably, did not answer. Nor did he answer Harry’s next letter, nor the one after that.
, but that was really only the beginning of the weird things between Draco and his father, so Harry decided to save it for another time), and took Harry’s elbow.
After that, it was like Malfoy disappeared. They had just finished exams, and it wasn’t unusual for students to leave school early. Harry figured that was what he had done. He didn’t think about it too much, although he did find himself…
Draco put his hands up placatingly. He didn’t feel he could say anything. The lift came to a stop and he let Potter get out. Draco rode the lift down to the basement, where he found an old broom cupboard and had a little panic. Only a little one. He could breathe, and everything. It was just that there were so many books he would never get to read. His heart thumped in his ears. He would never go to Petra. He would never go to Cairo. He would never have children. He would never grow old. He would never—
Draco nodded. His foot tapped manically against the floor. He tried to stop it, but just started tapping his fingers instead.
“Try not to let your crush on Draco distract you from what Harry is saying, Ron,” said Hermione, looking a bit exasperated.
“I think maybe I wasn’t a very good Auror,” said Harry. Ron and Hermione were silent, so he carried on. “I made assumptions. I jumped to conclusions. I didn’t look carefully enough. I never do.”
“I’m fine,” said Draco automatically. Then he shook his head. “I’m, ah, a bit, ah. I have too many thoughts in my head.” He leant his forehead against the mirrored cabinet. “I want to get
“I will, actually,” said Draco, getting to his feet. Then he remembered Adelaide. “Shit. Give me a second…”
“Do you have any reason to believe he’s been cheating on you?” asked Hermione, doubt creeping into her voice.
Three days later, Draco was discharged from St Mungo’s. Harry took him back to Grimmauld Place through the floo. It was difficult to manoeuvre because Draco had insisted on transfiguring the efficient wheelchair St Mungo’s had provided for him (Draco was too weak to walk more than a few steps) into a more aesthetically pleasing, Victorian wicker contraption.
“Unlike you,” he said. Adelaide stuck out her chin, and a horrible thought occurred to Draco. “Did Potter—did he know how old you were?”
“Mystery makes everyone more beautiful,” said Astoria. “Everyone’s more attractive, when they’re wearing sunglasses.”
“Everyone wants to be understood, Draco. When you ask someone what they mean, particularly after they’ve already been talking at length, they feel as if they matter. People love to matter. They love those who make them feel that way.”
“So he’s just a hot twenty-year-old you fuck and live with?” he asked Harry, without looking at him. “Is that right?”
“A few reasons. Cassie would hate it, for one. She’s like me; she doesn’t like to share. She’d feel as if she were being replaced. And honestly, I
“The guilt fucks him up, you know? He wants to make amends, but he doesn’t want forgiveness. Or to look like he thinks he deserves forgiveness. I think it’s all bollocks, personally.”
Harry came home one evening and found Timothy, shirtless (he took off his clothes when he was stressed), striding back and forth in the dining room. Draco lounged in a chair, sucking on the end of a fountain pen. There was extensive paper work on the table in front of him.
Harry said she could do anything she liked. Harry said she was brilliant and hard-working, and that he had faith in her. At first she had thought he only said it to look good in front of Draco, but eventually she had realised that he really meant it—that some people were kind without the expectation of anything in return. It still made her sad, that they loved each other more than her, but she was making her peace with it.
“I am, I…” Cassie took a step away from Draco, tears pouring down her cheeks, and clicked her heels into a sharp salute.
And they had been welcoming, the Gryffindors. He had to hand it to Astoria. Ever since the party, everyone had been perfectly lovely to him. Some of it was patronising, like Parvati’s soft and aggressive sympathy, but some of it was just… nice. Dean sat on his bed for half an hour one night, explaining to him the rules of a muggle game called football. Draco had started playing chess with Weasley a few times a week, which was surreal. But Draco liked it, these ways of talking without talking. He also liked, although it filled him with plunging humiliation, Hermione’s determination to get him “help”.
“He’s the real bastard around here,” said Draco. “I mean, I know I tortured people and willingly joined the Dark Lord, but Harry Potter;
“I’m useless,” said Timothy, and Harry was reminded of how young he was. Sometimes he forgot. But Timothy looked near tears, and his hair was all ruffled from pulling at it. “I can’t
, he finished in his head, but then his thoughts hit a wall. He couldn’t think about that yet. It would be a long, long time before he was whole enough to consider his father with any distance.
When he went down to breakfast the next morning, Draco was already in the kitchen, making an omelette. Harry hadn’t even known there were eggs.
“That was an estimate,” said the healer, casting diagnostic spells. Draco was cheerful and glassy-eyed, fading in and out of reality. “I would give him a month at most. He’s deteriorating fast.”
“That’s what I said,” said Draco, stepping close to Potter and kissing him. Clearly, Potter wouldn’t be able to focus until he’d got off.
All this time he had seen Malfoy’s cheating on his girlfriend as further proof of his continued treacherousness. Malfoy had slept with him to hurt him, and now was doing the same to Adelaide. But of course, Malfoy hadn’t slept with Harry to hurt him. He had come to Harry for help. And Harry had fucked him, then shouted at him.
“No one else is fucking… everyone else has moved on, I’m the only one who—it wasn’t even a fucking nightmare, I’m just
Potter looked at him with something close to loathing. Draco remembered how tender he had been, how slowly he’d worked Draco open, how it had still hurt, how he’d not wanted to say anything because he wanted to impress Potter. To keep Potter looking at him like he had that day, kind and sympathetic.
Harry was uncomfortably aware that Blaise would probably do an excellent job of dressing him in wizarding clothes, just as Draco had done an excellent job of dressing him as a muggle.
said Blaise.) “But not for the reasons I thought. Not because you’re stuck up, or attention-seeking, or a despicably smug goody-goody.”
But then he mentioned the time in Grimmauld Place during the war, when he noticed they had fallen asleep holding hands, and he had felt a yawning, endless loneliness.
“I have later gigs occasionally, I’ll let you know next time.” Harry heard Draco stretching over the phone, and wished he could see it. “Although they’re always boozy disasters, I’ll be honest with you. I have a special act I do with a late night crowd.”
“Harry,” said Draco, and all but fell into his arms. For one small moment, for only a matter of seconds, Harry held him, and Draco clutched at his neck. Then he stepped away.
Nearly two weeks later, a postcard arrived at Grimmauld Place. It was from the British museum, but had been sent, bizarrely, from Minneapolis.
certainly would never let you forget it. Haven’t you got any robes that fit you properly? Here, take mine.”
panic. Homeschooling Mabel Manning was very similar to teaching the DA. She was a shy girl who had suffered a traumatic head injury, and so couldn’t focus for long periods of time. Harry was used to dealing with that sort of thing, because of Draco. By the end of the session, he felt confident that not only was this something he could do, but it was something he could do
“Positive,” said Draco. “There’s a fairly nasty ghost who pops up from time to time, so people keep their distance. He’s harmless, but he likes thrusting his hands into your chest to make your heart cold. It’s very unpleasant.”
He never mentioned his actual friends. It eventually became clear to Harry that that was because he didn’t have any.
“I’m very sorry, Draco,” said Tertius. Draco nodded, unable to express how much he appreciated Tertius’ sympathy.
“You can’t be honest with someone who pays you to be charming,” said Draco. “Or at least— you can be as honest as is charming, and no more. It’s charming to be tipsy or clumsy or appreciative. It’s not charming to be paralysed by vast, unending dread. Anyway, half my fears were financial. I could hardly complain about that to
“Harry, no one else had both access to the case files and a motive,” said Hermione, as Draco was dragged towards the demolished floo. He still only had eyes for Harry, wide, wild, supplicating grey eyes. His hair was all dishevelled from sex. Harry had kissed him in this very kitchen less than an hour ago.
Maybe it would have been funny, if Malfoy had been more himself. Maybe it would be funnier the second time. Maybe, if Harry had another session with him, and figured out how it could be funny, he could then tell Seamus and Ron and it then they could book a
The next day, Tertius sat by his bedside, spooning soup into Draco’s swollen lips. Tertius had made up the tray himself. There was a small vase of daisies on it.
…! Did Potter think that Draco had weighed two options, one in which his body served as an outlet for the rages of more powerful men, and another where Draco led a nice normal life, and Draco had
Cassie had been staying in Pansy’s guest room, so Harry hadn’t been to Draco’s house yet. He apparated to the address on on Draco’s file. It was a small flat above a potions shop. The aurors really had done a number on the shop. All the shelves were smashed, as were the window fronts. Harry went to the back and let himself up into the flat.
He kissed Draco rather perfunctorily and then drew him up the stairs, eager-eyed. Draco laughed and followed. He paused at the bedroom door.
He was using it less and less, anyway. By the time he’d been at Grimmauld Place a week, he walked with a cane, and they only used the wheelchair if he got one of his headaches.
Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair. It still thrilled Harry whenever he did that. It felt proprietary.
between them. Kisses when they came home from work, Draco stroking Harry’s hair as Harry napped on the sofa, long chats into the night and spontaneous cooking decisions (Draco: “I don’t care if it’s 3 a.m. I want cake and I want it
He was looking straight at the worst part of Draco, yet he still wanted to touch him. Draco laughed, slightly light-headed.
“Yes, you know, Dean’s always banging on about them. By the way, have you noticed how few muggle-borns we’re friends with, as a group? It’s a bit fucked up, isn’t it?”
to this statement.) “But I’d like to know what sort of options would have been open to my friend, after his apprenticeship.”
They hung out in her bedroom for a while, and then Harry insisted that she brush her teeth and go to sleep. When he came back downstairs, Draco had built a fire in the living room, and was drinking a glass of red wine.
“Yeah. But I waited to ask him out until his sentence was complete,” said Harry, sticking to Draco’s story.
Everyone seemed delighted to see him. Robards took him aside and gave him a little speech about how Harry could come back anytime, he knew that, didn’t he? He just had to say the word. Ron lounged around in doorways, grinning, bright-eyed.
“What’s happened? Is it my case? They’re sending me to Azkaban, aren’t they? What will happen to Cass?”
Neville glared at him. They had grown apart, since the war. Neville had got hot, and Harry had got sad.
,” said Ron, when he saw the dorm list in the eighth year common room. “Just ‘sleepwalk’ into his bed and blow him!”
“It can be fixed, sir,” said Misty. Draco looked around sharply. She was observing him with shrewd eyes.
“Fuck off, Potter,” said Draco nastily, something clicked in Harry’s head. The sudden shift in Draco’s behaviour over the last few weeks, the way he would go from friendly to awful in unpredictable spurts… Harry had thought it was because of that stupid kiss, but what if it was because of something else? Something
“Right, yeah, and we all know I have a healthy attitude to love. But no, this is so clearly all about you, isn’t it,” said Harry. He instantly wished he could take it back, because Draco looked stricken.
By the time he’d finished, his head had started up a dull pounding. The pain-reliever was wearing off.
“Why don’t you ask him about them?” said Hermione, not looking up from her Runes homework. Harry rolled his eyes.
“It’s literally my category on the fucking site,” said Draco. He unfolded his arms to rub his temples. “It’s fine. It’s just an occupational hazard of having a job where my looks are important.”
Draco wasn’t sure how it happened, who had initiated, but they were kissing, furiously, and Potter pushed him onto the sofa and climbed on top of him and kissed him harder.
“Yes, all right,” said the man, and came to sit next to him. Harry closed his eyes, and the man stroked his head, tentatively at first, and then, once he was sure that Harry liked it, more purposefully. His fingers felt around Harry’s ears. “So soft,” he said. “But your hair is quite soft, so I suppose that makes sense. Can you understand me?”
They talked quidditch for the better part of an hour, when Harry suddenly realised they were 15 minutes over the arranged session length.
Harry stumbled out of bed. Maybe he was wrong, maybe this was a bad idea, but the notion that Draco was so nearby and so potentially ready to comfort made it impossible for Harry to resist seeking him.
. It was more of the, violent crime side of things.” He kicked peevishly at the edge of the hearth rug. “I’m not a violent crime sort of
“I’m not letting Blaise anywhere near my biography,” said Harry. “Go on. But skip the part about me being all… war hero-y or whatever.”
,” said Draco in exasperation, when Zacharias went so far as to check on him in his dormitory one night.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry again, more softly this time. Draco moved his head in a motion that was like a nod, but less definite.
That night, after he had watched Malfoy come, and then come himself in the shower, Harry went over to Ginny’s flat and tried to have sex with her.
“Draco: I understand your research. I understand how you’ve got here. And you are being fucking crazy.”
, they sang, in their inhuman voices, the warm, slow, golden notes soaring through the fluted vaults of stone, and there was no touch of suffering to it. It was high and pure and generous, the music of forgiveness. It fell on his heart like a silence: clean as snow. As he listened, his eyes came alive, and he noticed for the first time how the light flowed through the glowing stained glass windows with a tranquility that he could only have described as
Scorpius encountered no such difficulty. He ate every bite. His table manners were exemplary. When he was done, he placed his cutlery neatly on his plate and stared at his clasped hands.
“The guys over there are talking about finance,” said Harry. “I overheard them when I was getting our drinks.”
“Draco,” sobbed his mother. Her hair had fallen in front of her face, her long, beautiful hair, that still looked just right. When he looked at her hair, it was as if he had his mother back again.
So Harry left. He went to the kitchen and made two cups of tea, then hovered near them, wondering if it would be overstepping to bring one to Draco. Draco had looked so tired.
“I think it would be better to choose the getting-off-the-sofa option. You see, taking off your nails with pliers would be very painful.”
“I’m sorry. I know this is much harder for you than it is for me,” he said to Dean and Luna, the third time it happened.
“Okay, so,” said Harry, stepping away and clearing his throat. “The starter word, believe it or not, is
“I’m not pitying him,” said Harry. “I like him. And he’s not a Death Eater child, he’s just a child.”
Draco closed his eyes, and Harry knew with a certainty he rarely experienced anymore that Draco wanted Harry to kiss him. And Harry might have done it, if Draco had been anyone else. He wanted Draco enough not to care that it would hurt Neville, that it would be destructive and reckless.
“It’s not my fault,” said Draco. “You have no idea how disarming it is to have a great big wolf come at you like a puppy dog. I wanted to take you home and put a bow around your neck.”
Harry crawled into the armchair behind Draco, his chest to Draco’s back, his legs around Draco’s waist. Occasionally, he kissed the back of Draco’s neck. Hermione, meanwhile, listened to Draco’s long explanation with an intent look on her face, her clever eyes thoughtful and serious.
It was obvious, really, that that was where he would do it. Now he thought about it (and he wasn’t really thinking about it), it was the only place that made sense.
, almost accepted the statement as a rejection. But he paused before answering, and noticed that Draco looked… awful.
“You should go cuddle your dad,” he whispered into Scorpius’ ear. Scorpius looked up at him curiously, but did as he was told. Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Scorpius nuzzled under Malfoy’s arm. He knew instantly that he’d been right to suggest it, because everything about Malfoy relaxed. He smiled at Scorpius and leant back into the sofa, pulling him close and stroking his hair. Harry saw him speak quietly, saw his lips move to say
Adelaide didn’t notice that anything was wrong. She tripped on her heels as she came towards him, and he caught her.
“If you don’t think I deserve to be loved, then—then you lied, because that’s not fucking friendship,” he said, lowering his chin on the last word to look defiantly at Harry.
“Um,” said Harry. “Yeah. I think… I don’t know that I’ll ever not have the dreams, or feel like everything goes very slow and watery when someone brings up the battle or anything that reminds me of it. Like maybe I’ll always feel that. But something that really helps is feeling that other people understand. That maybe some of you…” he looked around at them all. “That some of you know what it’s like, not to be doing so well, in this particular way. And if you’re figuring it out, I can too. And if I figure it out, so can you.”
When he came back, a short hour later, he put on the collar without a single word and spent the rest of the evening as a kitten. The weather was getting warmer, and he was shedding. His fur got everywhere, but Harry didn’t mind. He took the kitten’s paw in his hand, pressed on the little pink pads. The kitten didn’t purr much that night, but he stayed close to Harry, and Harry did his best to show that that was okay.
“Check the cabinets for Valerian tea, my sweet. This is a Black household, I’m sure Kreacher will have it in stock.”
Harry jumped up and put his paws on the man’s shoulders so that he could lick his face. The man stumbled backwards, hitting the wall, but he didn’t seem frightened. He laughed.
Something cold stirred in Harry. A feeling that his muggle upbringing was about to have cost him dreadfully.
“No, that’s.” Draco smiled fleetingly at him as he let himself into the house. “That’s fine. Don’t worry about it.”
Harry came over to Draco’s flat on Tuesday. Tasha and Ellie and Fiona were in the sitting room with Adelaide, and when Draco poked his head in, Adelaide shrieked.
“I’m an excellent host. I anticipate the needs of all my guests. Your need, right now, is to get Potter by himself and grill him, and I am graciously providing you with what you want.”
“Three times a week, two beers each time,” said Draco, because that was the agreed amount for both of them, so that they didn’t… get wobbly, was how they termed it.
“About a year, I think,” said Ursula. “Don’t get me wrong, Hugo was lovely. I don’t know that Draco would have kicked the drugs without him.”
“I just had a chat with Kingsley, it wasn’t any trouble,” lied Harry. It had, in fact, been a great deal of trouble.
“You’d think they’d tire of printing nothing but your face, nonstop, on every single magazine, wouldn't you?
At eight p.m., Narcissa arrived. Everyone got out of the bed except for Draco, so that Narcissa could reach to embrace him.
, and I knew quite positively I would fuck that up as well, so I just paced around my room trying to calm down, trying to think what to do. And when I got to work, there was a bouquet of flowers on my desk, and I thought, Oh, Harry is just going to take charge. He’ll decide. But they weren’t from you. They were from Neville.” He glanced at Harry, as if waiting for Harry to say something, but Harry was silent. “He came over at lunch and gave this whole speech and… I don’t know. I think I felt that maybe if you were my friend, I could make you like me longer.”
Blaise had started being publicly friendly to Draco—although only tentatively, coldly. He and Etta bought a house and threw elaborate parties, and Draco was always invited. Draco went because he was curious about Etta, and soon wished he hadn’t. Etta was lovely. Not nearly as clever as Pansy, but considerably kinder. She was generous and hospitable, and went out of her way to set Draco at ease.
“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t think. I should have told you, I just didn’t… you don’t have to use it. There are other resilience potions on the market, I just like— my one gives a certain radiance—”
“I still remember the Fairfax Twirl you did in the match against Ravenclaw in third year. That was bloody amazing.”
“So, now you know. Remorse is about responsibility. I can’t take responsibility, because I still blame my parents. So, I’m a piece of shit, basically.”
“Please stay,” he said. Malfoy clenched his jaw and would not meet his eyes. Then he gave a startled shout of pain.
Draco turned to look at him. He knew what consistency meant to Harry. Harry’s face was very close to his, and he was smiling.
. A woman came on in a swan costume and tore off all her feathers with her mouth. A fire dancer burned his paper costume to a crisp while it was still on his body. One act appeared to be a series of nightclub in-jokes that the crowded room all understood, but made no sense whatsoever to Harry.
“And it’s only because he doesn’t think he deserves better,” said Harry, angrily spiking his fork into his lavender, fennel and earl grey tart.
” he asked, and Draco laughed—it felt as if Draco’s laughs were close to the surface, just then—but did not answer Theo. He leant close to Harry’s ear and whispered,
“Thank you,” said Timothy, in a low, intimate voice. He dropped his eyes to Harry’s lips and up again.
Harry told himself he would bring up Neville again the next morning, but Draco had been quite right about the strength of his margaritas. Harry’s headache was so debilitating he had to call in sick at work, which he had never done before.
“Shit,” said Harry, as the kitten gave a piteous, sleepy meow, moved a foot away to sit in the crook of Harry’s knee, and went back to sleep. Harry stared at him for a moment, then lay back down.
“We’ll have to be careful,” said Draco, lifting his head to look at Harry. “I’ll be sent to Azkaban if I’m caught.”
The invisibility cloak made him cocky. So did the ease with which Hermione had been able to sneak into Draco’s cell that morning. Harry could not have predicted that they had tightened the security measures. That something as stupid as a tripping jinx had been set up outside Draco’s door.
“Hang on, BOOKS sounds like a great name for a shop,” said Harry, putting an arm around Draco’s narrow shoulders and squeezing.
Oh, thought Harry. Of course Malfoy had bought all those clothes. Probably he had given them to Harry with plenty of snide remarks about his mudblood mother. For a few days, Harry avoided wearing them, but then he went to a pub night where Ginny was going, and he wanted to look his best. He put on the clothes and felt instantly like his favourite version of himself.
It was a nice place. The waiter brought them wine to taste before pouring. The portions were small and expensive.
“Sorry she likes me more than you,” said Harry, but he doubted whether Draco heard him. He cast Harry a look of deep disdain, then pulled the girl off the dance floor, out of sight.
“Sit up,” said Harry, casting a drying spell and refilling the glass. He put his hand on the back of Draco’s hot head and held the glass to his lips.
Draco couldn’t figure out where to put that. Because Potter liked having someone to obsess about? Because Potter missed having the Dark Lord for a nemesis, and Draco was better than nothing?
“What do you think of Draco’s stage name?” asked Harry, eventually. Lucius’ mouth drew into a long, thin line.
“Answer me!” said Steven, his voice pitching desperately. Draco took a step backwards. He knew how this went.
“You’re Harry’s only family,” said Draco. “And now you’re going to start your own, without him. Or at least, I imagine that’s how I would feel, if I were him.”
But the intruder held out his hand. Harry smelled it and recognised it. A clean, friendly smell. A friend, in fact. Harry licked the hand, and the man made a sound.
“Anyway. I might go to one,” said Draco. “Dean says it’s just someone you pay money to talk to about yourself. I pay money for all sorts of things I enjoy
There was a pause. Blaise rested his cheek on the top of Draco’s head. He had a strange, pained look in his eye.
But then he would think of something he wanted to tell Draco, and he would be struck once more by the bitter fragility of his principles. Or else, he would think of something Draco had said, and laugh, before remembering that he had given Draco up, or lost him, or never had him in the first place.
“They left him for dead. He hid Scorpius in a cupboard or something, not sure how they didn’t find him, because the whole flat was trashed. But if Scorpius hadn’t been there to call the ambulance when they left…”
,” he said, and Harry said “Yeah. Despite your looks,” and Draco shoved him.). Draco was obviously nervous the first time he cammed from within the flat, but Harry stayed in the living room, and when Draco came out after an hour, he was more affectionate than ever.
“Breathe,” he said, because Draco was clearly struggling to. Draco buried his face in Harry’s shoulder and shuddered.
“He wasn’t on great form, to be honest with you,” said Draco, trying to tug his arm away from Harry’ grasp. But Harry clung on tighter.
But after that, Hermione was notably warmer towards him, although he still didn’t get the impression she trusted him.
“You can’t!” said Scorpius, jerking his tear-stained face up to look at Harry. “It’s against the Statute!”
At work the next day, he couldn’t focus. Draco was only a few doors down. At lunchtime, he slipped on his invisibility cloak and sneaked into Draco’s cell.
Harry was not prepared for what the sight of Malfoy in his clothes would do to him. It was bizarrely intimate, as if Malfoy was his boyfriend and had dressed himself in Harry’s wardrobe after a long night of hard fucking. The shower seemed to have revitalised him. He didn’t say anything about the clothes, except to ask if Harry would lend him some socks.
“Did Dean fancy Malfoy, then?” asked Harry, even though he knew that was a dick thing to ask. Seamus looked at him coldly.
“Am I? My hair was being uncooperative. But I cowed it into submission. It looks lovely now, doesn’t it?”
“Draco was attacked. The assailant cast the curse, Draco turned into a kitten, the assailant put him into a bag with some heavy stones, and threw him in the Thames.”
He bought a barrel of Pepper-Up potion and kept some in a hip flask. If he had a swig every hour or so, he could just about function as he had before, although it had side effects: jittery fingers, a fluttery heart. He felt nervous all the time. But it was worth it, because he only had five months left, and there was a lot to do before then.
“But…!” said Harry. He had spent all day looking up feline curses. Malfoy’s fur had been the softest thing Harry had ever touched. He’d fallen asleep in Harry’s
That night, luxuriating in the painlessness, Harry realised that Malfoy cheating on his girlfriend was probably a rare instance of Malfoy’s cruelty working out in Harry’s favour. It lessened his incentive to sell Harry out to the papers. The secrecy contract made very little difference to Harry’s paranoia. Malfoy was plenty clever enough to work out how to break it, if he decided he wanted to.
“You look good, baby,” said Anika. She climbed over the bench and scooped Draco into a hug. She was sweating a lot, as if she had been dancing. “Did you want to buy something?”
Harry didn’t bring it up in when they were in bed. He brought it up, oddly, when they were both sitting in the open window of Seamus Finnegan’s downstairs loo. The party was too loud, and Harry had said, “I’ve never had a cigarette. I want to try one,” and Draco had laughed at him, stolen a cigarette from Pansy, and led them to the loo. He lit it for Harry, grimaced, then passed it over.
“I don’t think it will be long until they sell the manor. And I think it would be nice for Draco to have something to look forward to.”
The next morning, Harry sat on the counter as Malfoy baked. Malfoy’s hands were quick and deft. He managed to make his shabby, second-hand robes look elegant, because he was so graceful.
Malfoy followed the train with his eyes until it was out of sight. The platform cleared (Harry was aware of several people taking pictures of him standing with Malfoy, and knew that he would be in the
“We need to find out what his objections would be to dating you, and then eliminate them,” she said. “Can we get your Mark removed?”
“Can we go home?” asked Draco, before long. So they apparated back to Harry’s flat, and Harry wondered when Draco had started calling it
“Oh, yeah,” said Draco. “I have a post-war reading group. Well, I say group, it’s just me and Nott and Goyle.”
. But it was too late. She knew he had meant it. Knew she was the only person Draco had, and the realisation had filled her with a weighty horror, the dread of knowing she couldn’t do it—she couldn’t take care of him. She could barely take care of herself. It was awful, knowing that Draco needed her like that.
Malfoy never seemed to tire of Harry talking. Harry knew Ron and Hermione would be horrified to hear him have these conversations, not with them, but with
“Is that what you think? He deserves what he gets, because when he was sixteen he joined the same club as his dad?”
Harry splashed cold water on his face. His body didn’t hurt at all. It didn’t for days, after he saw Malfoy.
Malfoy gave that hopeless laugh, the one he and Timothy had picked up in the same place, in the same ways.
The first Saturday Draco stayed home, Harry woke up and couldn’t find Cassie. He searched the house for her— she usually woke up long before Harry did—before hearing a low, steady voice coming from her bedroom.
That night, Harry watched fondly as Draco wrestled their spoiled, ridiculous cat to the ground in an attempt to trim his claws.
“No, listen, Harry, it’s important,” said Draco, no longer smiling, but horribly, devastatingly serious. Harry lightly touched the back of his hand.
“I promise. Although you could also live with Nick and Flora, you know, or Eve. You have so many people who love you, Scorpius. So many people who would love to take care of you.”
They were at Ron and Hermione’s flat, and Harry had just told them about his disastrous attempt to break off Draco’s wedding.
He stopped by the shop several times, but Draco always found ways not to speak to him. Finally, he came forward when Harry arrived, pulled him out of the way, and said,
, he didn’t say. He looked at Harry. They had stopped again, pausing by an old statue of a poet. “Of course I love you,” he said, his grey eyes uncertain.
“You said we could be friends. You said to tell you if I changed my mind about wanting—what we’ve been doing,” he said.
Draco was familiar with the protocol. Harry wondered how many times he had been interrogated on Veritaserum.
“That whatever it was, he used to hate people like us. We could tell, just from the things he used to say. Especially at first.”
“You do realise,” said Harry, through gritted teeth, “that Draco is morbidly afraid of someone killing him because of what he did in the war?”
“Right,” said Malfoy. “I’m going to do something, and I promise I’m not being a dick. But it is going to
Ron groaned. Harry stared intently at the crisps. He had come out as bi already, so people definitely weren’t looking at him, and wondering whether
Ron, who had been holding back laughter, finally gave in, snorting loudly. Draco grinned at him. Parvati looked at Ron icily.
What was remorse, anyway? Could you feel remorse if you didn’t take responsibility? And how could he take responsibility when he still blamed his parents for so much?
It was Adelaide’s birthday in a month. He lost himself in making her perfume. She knew what he was doing, because the flat was filled with all his experiments.
“Let’s go make tea,” said Draco, which Harry correctly interpreted as “let’s go canoodle downstairs.”
“Still deciding.” He cupped her chin and wiped at her bottom lip with his thumb. “Good bone structure. What colour are your eyelashes?”
“I’m not obsessing,” said Harry, although he was, he knew he was. It was exactly the same feeling he used to have in sixth year, except instead of
“You’re filthy. Get in,” said Draco, and Harry obeyed. Draco sat next to him on a little stool, telling him all the gossip he had picked up at the pub. Harry closed his eyes. The water was so hot that it made him feel dizzy.
“Three… two… one,” said Hermione, and turned into a swan. So did Ron, next to her. Harry, meanwhile, was already in the air, a small black blur of wings.
It didn’t matter whether those lessons in Azkaban had been real or not. They were what his mother would have said, he knew they were. He had to make Potter love him— not fall
And he did. He led them through the crowd to a handsome blond man, whispered in his ear, and gestured at Harry. The blond man smiled hungrily and nodded. The next minute he was dancing with Harry, his hands on Harry’s waist, his mouth at Harry’s ear.
Draco went downstairs the next morning determined to redeem himself after the embarrassing Favourite Colour fiasco. Harry was sitting at the kitchen table looking distinctly hungover, which made Draco feel even worse. He had noticed that on the evenings when he avoided Harry, Harry went out clubbing alone. He would stumble home in the early hours of the morning, off his face and clumsy. But when the two of them stayed up talking, Harry had a glass of wine and went to bed.
“Magic is amazing,” he said. “Anyway. I’ve got to get going. I’ll see you tomorrow at the station, yeah?”
“Trust me, Draco, this is not exactly a hardship for me,” said Blaise. He straddled Draco and kissed him. “And you love me, don’t you?”
Harry stared at the note for several seconds without understanding what he was reading, and then it set in.
he reminded himself), but Scorpius had tried to hide his feelings. And it was Scorpius who had called Malfoy back to himself, when he went missing behind the eyes.
They were in Draco’s bed, facing each other. They had gone to bed still wet-haired from kissing in the rain.
They both hitched, two inches apart. They both paused. Draco had his eyes on Harry’s mouth, but when he looked up, Harry met his gaze solemnly. It was the solemnity in his expression that persuaded Draco to tip forward those last two inches.
for her, and now you’re going to waltz in, ten years late, buy her a few expensive gifts, and be praised by all and sundry for being
“Master Malfoy is asleep,” said Kreacher, when Harry told him to fetch him. Remembering the bags under Malfoy’s eyes, Harry thought it was probably better to leave him.
“You know, I’m almost certain he’s queer,” said Harry, as if he was imparting important new information, rather than voicing his pet theory for the third time that pub night.
“Harry!” he said, as if Harry was his very best friend. Harry turned quickly away to drag the curtains over Walburga’s portrait.
It was probably the whole wolf thing. That was why he kept thinking about Malfoy, about the different ways he’d been. He wondered what motive Malfoy could possibly have for wanting to hook up with him. He imagined the
Harry knew how to be brave in the face of death. But it wasn’t death that Draco had faced. It was something far more insidious and creeping. In Azkaban, Draco had stared down a life of loneliness, desolation and shame, stretching endlessly ahead, and had steeled himself just as surely as Harry had when he walked into the Forbidden Forest to be killed. It wasn’t Gryffindor bravery, but it was bravery nonetheless, and Harry fell deeper in love with him with each memory he witnessed.
“Your roots are showing,” he said. She sobbed harder, but didn’t tell him to go. He sat on the edge of the bed, put one hand on her back. “I brought you tea.”
. And yet Harry could still love Draco, as if Draco was some lovely plant grown in poisonous soil. The graceful, admirable result of something Harry hated. And if anyone deserved to find something to love out of the war, wasn’t it Harry?
“Hm. That’s refreshing. Anyway, I just mean that Blaise thinks you’re fascinating. He’s always saying he wants to write your biography.”
“I love your” was not the same as “I love you”, not by any stretch of the imagination. But it was something about him that Potter didn’t hate, and that was a victory in Draco’s book.
Harry stroked Lamorak? Draco? absently on the back as he coughed. When the fit started to pass, Harry passed him a glass of water, which Lamorak—Draco—gratefully accepted.
Draco had so many things he wanted to do. Harry knew he couldn’t possibly have got through more than half his list.
“It’s going to be okay,” said Harry. To his surprise, Cassie came and sat next to him— right next to him, her shoulder pressing up against his. He hesitantly put his arm around her. She leant into him, and he squeezed her. Pansy and Blaise exchanged looks.
“I can’t help but feel that your relationship with him can’t progress until he tells you a bit more about himself,” said Hermione.
“Oh. Ah, a bit? Sometimes. There’s our post-war book club. We only... talk sideways? You know when you can see something out of the corner of your eye but it disappears if you look straight at it?”
“He says everything in the house is yours,” said Hermione. Which made sense, actually. There had probably been a bunch of wanky, pretentious furniture before, that Malfoy had moved out. Although Harry wasn’t sure where there would have been space for Malfoy’s stuff, because everything seemed as if it was in its perfect place.
“Oh, er, all right,” said Malfoy. He took the money Harry offered him and followed Harry into the kitchen. Harry leant against the counter and watched him as the water boiled. Malfoy’s hand was glamoured again, it looked perfectly whole, and his clothes were neat and ironed. He always looked handsome in that way Harry could never achieve, chic and elegant, like an adult.
“He walked in on me looking at a picture of—someone, once,” said Draco. “Dobby. I shouted at him while he banged his head against the floor. He hated me.” Draco paused. “I’ve never told anyone that before.”
“Oh, did you get dragged into it again, Malfoy? Against your will? Was poor little Malfoy tricked into being a fucking evil prick once again?”
The moment Draco touched it, Harry knew it was the right choice—not from the sparks it gave off, or the soft breeze that blew through Draco’s hair, but because of the expression of awe on Draco’s face.
There was a knock on Harry’s door about half an hour later. When he opened it, it was Draco. He looked twitchy and uncertain. He had been to Harry’s flat several times, but only ever for drinks with Ron and Hermione.
“She’s ravenous,” said Malfoy, decisively. “She’s on her last legs. Can you make it to Nando’s, darling, or shall I carry you?”
But he felt better afterwards. Less angry, although he still was continually seized with rage, and frequently snarled nasty words at her for no good reason.
Harry had forgotten about the tickets Ron and Seamus had got to go see the Chudley Canons. All day he was looking forward to seeing Draco, and at the last minute, Ron showed up in his office, dressed in orange, and said, “you ready?”
“Can you,” he said, and Harry tried to read it, but the charm made him dizzy, and the words blurred. He made out a few:
Draco shook his head. His mother came to sit beside him and enveloped him in a hug. She didn’t say anything boring. She just held him, and continued to hold him, long after Teddy had squirmed free of Draco’s lap and escaped downstairs. She held him so long that Draco fell asleep—or fainted—it was hard to tell which it was, sometimes—in her arms. When he came to, they were both lying on the sofa, wrapped around each other, and Harry was standing in the doorway. He cleared his throat.
Harry was barely aware of how he got back to his dorm. The moment he saw who L was, it was as if his body moved without his consent, born away by the wave of outraged fury and misery that had broken over him.
Adelaide did not come to church with him the next morning. He hadn’t expected her to. He had gone every week since Hermione first brought him; had grown to know the hymns and prayers, to understand when he was expected to sit or stand or kneel. The fourth time he had gone, he had made eye-contact with an elegant mother who always sat in the second-to-last pew with her husband and teenaged son. She smiled at him, shook his hand during the Peace. The next week it happened again. The week after that, Draco sat next to her.
“Yeah, maybe a bit,” he said, once he was sure she couldn’t be listening. He hoped it was a believable understatement.
“I didn’t say you could go,” said Dinsmore. Draco turned obediently back round again, his face impassive. “What did you wish to ask, Mr Potter?”
“All his friends will be there,” said Draco. “I don’t want to leave him out.” Harry had just got back from Connemara, and Draco wondered what he had found there. Whether he had shed his anger again. Met anyone.
The silence between them was loud with their breaths, and to stop thinking of Tertius, Draco fixated on Potter’s exquisitely carved jaw. Draco had kissed it, that time, all along the sharp ridge, and it hadn’t been enough, not nearly. Draco stared at it, trying to recover from the adrenaline that had shot through him, and Potter took a small step forward. When he spoke his voice was more human, as if some of his anger had been shaken away.
He sat up. He thought Potter should reciprocate, and thus probably would, because he was Potter and tended to do his duty. But in case he wasn’t going to—Draco didn’t want to presume—Draco reached for his trousers. Potter knocked them out of his grasp and pushed Draco back against the cushions. He didn’t use his mouth, just his hand. Draco came embarrassingly quickly.
“It’s freezing,” said Harry. Draco didn’t turn around. Harry took off his jacket and slipped over Draco’s shoulders. He left his hands on Draco’s arms, and Draco leant back into his chest.
“You’re my best friend,” he said, as Draco showed him how to melt the icing slightly so that it went on smoother. Draco’s hands were steady that afternoon, but he baked even when they weren’t. He simply tidied up and started again each time he dropped or spilled something, with an unerring patience that Harry could not remember noticing at Hogwarts. Although, perhaps this was the evolution of the dogged determination which had pushed Draco to plague Harry so thoroughly all the way through school.
“Yeah, fair,” said Harry, reaching up for another kiss, because it had never occurred to him that Draco was over it.
“Because! I knew everyone hated the Malfoys after the war. I mean, his father was murdered in prison, everyone knows that.”
“Oh,” she said. “That’s… that’s very generous of you, Mr. Potter. Of course, I’m not surprised. You were always so noble-minded.”
“Please. That was one conversation. The rest of the time, we were swapping stories about Blaise. You know, Draco has actually taught me a thing or two about—”
Neville was Blaise’s best man at the wedding. Harry spend the night at the Slytherin house, learning the (still highly dangerous) beginner’s version of Hunt the King, and trying not to notice how red Pansy’s eyes were.
Draco shook his head. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the painting. It was spring. It was joy, and serenity, and peacefulness.
Draco closed his eyes, his relief clear. Harry edged closer to him and leant his head against Draco’s shoulder. After a brief pause during which Harry worried he had misjudged, Draco’s head touched his.
and Harry had been utterly charmed to learn that Malfoy knew all the lines off by heart. Flora had thrown up in a pot plant, and Eve had drunkenly grabbed Harry by the collar and told him that he’d be hot if he stopped wearing hoodies.
“Harry!” he called out. Harry looked around, caught sight of him, and broke out into a sunny smile. He came forwards to meet Draco, his hands reaching and then pulling back.
“There’s so much you don’t know about me,” said Lamorak, stepping away from him, his fingers nervously playing with the buttons on his shirt. “It’s not fair to you.”
“My arms? Through clothes?” said Draco, laughing, because that’s all Harry was doing; rubbing his hands up and down Draco’s biceps.
It was nothing like how it had been in eighth year. It was careful, reverent, delicate. It was Draco gasping “Don’t forget the protection charm!” and Harry’s heart singing at the inference that Draco might love him and trust him enough for pregnancy to be a risk. It was Draco whispering his name over and over, and Harry calling him darling as he came.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “That’s why I asked you out. There’s this guy I hated in school who’s sort of come back into my life. But he’s, like… trying new things all the time. It’s fucking annoying, actually. He keeps asking me out.”
“That’s because you were at nerdy wizard school,” said Adelaide. Their social worker had advised against sending Adelaide to Hogwarts. Said she would stand out too much as a new fourth year student, particularly one who had been through as much as Adelaide had. So Adelaide went to a Muggle state school, and Draco tutored her in the evenings, convinced he was failing her.
“Come on, let me help. I’m no good at this kind of stuff, usually L—Draco does it for me, but I’ll give it a go.”
“Nearly. Tell me more about how my mistakes have haunted you for years and caused you untold pain, and I’ll probably come.”
“No, I’m fine. Socrates—I think it was Socrates—used to say he tried to be as charming when he was sick as when he was healthy. Apparently his visitors could never tell how he felt, because his behaviour never varied.”
“What I’m hearing is that you only want to fuck people you’ve known since you were eleven,” said Draco. “Have you considered Madam Hooch? Because she is
“What are you, my mum? Leave it,” said Harry, then waited for Malfoy to make some sort of dead mother joke. He didn’t. He just put down his unsipped mug, then came lazily towards Harry, sinuous and cat-like.
It varied, how people reacted to his fame. Sometimes they pretended they didn’t know who he was. Sometimes they got drunk and cried on his shoulder about how intimidated they were to meet him. Sometimes—more often than you would think—they were nasty to him, as if they were determined to get a Harry Potter party anecdote, and making fun of him or spilling a drink on him was better than just saying they’d made boring small talk with him once.
“Do you think I’m stupid? You’re trying to poison me. I’m a loose end. You’re cleaning up the mess I made when I escaped. If I’m dead, you don’t have to explain to anyone that you hired a Death Eater.”
They were at a small cafe by the canal outside their flat in Cannaregio, Venice, when Draco finally said it.
And how had Malfoy even had a kid, anyway? If Cassie was ten, it must have happened just after their eighth year at Hogwarts, and Harry didn’t remember him ever showing the slightest interest in women. Perhaps Pansy had volunteered to have his child, Merlin knew it must have been someone dark-haired for Cassie to end up with hair like that. And why had Cassie come to
“I’ve just remembered that Finch-Fletchley tried to kiss me, once. In second year. After you set that dirty big snake on him.”
“I think you’ll enjoy it,” said Harry. Draco seemed uncertain, but he also clearly didn’t want Hary to leave, so they watched
so fast. He wanted Potter’s warm, confident hands all over him. He wanted to see Potter naked. The abrupt, reckless, superfluous desire made him feel like a
“Potter, thank God,” said Kinloch. “This little brat just tried to break Malfoy out of his holding cell!”
“Draco Malfoy? Do you know many Dracos? I don’t, personally. But perhaps you have been more fortunate.”
Malfoy had been the only one to notice he was in pain. Had gone straight away to see what he could do about it.
“Mhmm, but I had a hard enough time getting this job, and he knows it,” said Pansy. “So. I come into work this morning, looking gorgeous as usual. Obviously I
, you couldn’t say no?” said Neville. Neville, like many sweet and vulnerable children, had grown up rather hard, rather brittle. Paranoid that people were taking advantage of him, or trying to make him feel guilty.
“You were well into him in school,” said Ron, “and then it was so weird between you two at the Aurors, and you kept calling him Draco.”
They were almost done when Pansy froze, staring above Harry’s head. Harry turned around and saw Draco standing behind him, his eyes fixed on Pansy.
was kissing him much quicker than Draco himself. Draco rolled his hips forward, and Potter moaned into his mouth.
He was going to have to kiss Ginny soon. It had been four days. She always got upset when it ticked over to day five. She had, like, some kind of in-built timer about it. It was uncanny, actually.
‘You don’t understand,’ said the man. ‘I’m taking him to the vet to be put down.’ He looked so distraught that my famously soft heart melted. He got inside,
“Pathetic,” said Harry, with a grin. But Draco sprang away as if Harry had called him scum. His face twisted into a sneer.
“I want to wake up next to you for the next ninety years,” said Harry. Draco closed his eyes and made a small sound.
Draco’s hands were all over Harry, too, busily running all over him, as if he wanted to map out all of Harry’s edges.
In bed, the kitten kept trying to get closer to Harry, kept repositioning himself and shivering in strange, vibrating starts. Harry stroked his little head and murmured stupid things into his fur,
“She doesn’t like anyone much, at first,” said Draco. “But yeah, she’s not keen on you. So I can’t, you know, I can’t predict what I can give you, right now.”
“No, he’s not,” said Harry sharply. “He’s great, actually. Really different from how he used to be.”
“Come here,” he said, and she obediently let him scoop her into a hug. She wasn’t stiff, the way she usually was. She wrapped her arms quickly around him and clung tight.
Draco cast him a suspicious look, then wrapped the cloak around himself. He visibly relaxed as the warming charms in the wool worked on him.
That night, Harry reached out to Luna and Dean. He hadn’t spoken to either of them in years, but they both answered right away. The next day, they came over for dinner.
“Yeah. Kingsley liked it as a plan because it means if anyone else tries to take advantage of you, you can report it. It does mean if I accidentally order you to do something in public, you’d have to obey. But apart from that, you’d be free. And then Kingsley will arrange for your sentence to end early for good behaviour, around Easter.” Harry looked at him entreatingly. “It’s the best I could do.”
“He schemes when he’s unhappy,” said Draco. “When his mother got a divorce in third year, we all had to burn our letters when we got them, because he went on a plotting
“You’ll need to find somewhere to stay for a few days while we look through your flat for evidence,” said Bianca. “Have you got somewhere?”
When Draco ended up in Hell, and Potter ended up in the other place—Draco hadn’t really understood much beyond Hell, when it came to Muggle religion—would Potter think Draco had chosen that, too? That it was what he had
They were in an empty classroom. Harry and Ron were seated together on the professor’s desk at the front of the room, discreetly playing a game of hangman while Hermione monologued. Draco supposed they didn’t need to listen. It was quite clear that if any potion was to be brewed, it would not be Harry and Ron doing it.
“Well, maybe if Teddy gets to know her a little better, he’ll see that’s she’s actually pretty great, under all that arrogant posturing.”
They spent a lot more time together, after that, although it wasn’t quite comfortable. Draco was too polite, and had a habit of clarifying when he was joking as if he thought Harry was incapable of figuring it out.
“Poor Draco,” she said. “He made a lovely bird, didn’t he? I’m hoping we can try this weekend. Did he say how it felt?”
Malfoy nodded and held out a hand. It made Harry’s head spin, to see Malfoy look at him like that, blankly and trustingly. The world was upside down.
Pansy gripped his elbow and explained. In low, urgent words, she told him that Draco had been cursed to die unless Harry Potter told him he loved him, and meant it.
had been quite open about how attracted he was to Draco, but Draco was so reluctant to give anything away that it was impossible to know if he liked all of their intense moments or if he only tolerated them.
“N-no. Turns out, a few years ago—during the war—he handled a cursed object. And it’s done something to his lungs. He’s got about five years left. Which I’m sure you think is plenty, but—”
Harry wanted to ask him how that had happened. How he had gone from being a blood supremacist to someone who wrote literary criticism on muggle novels.
“But…” began Harry, staring at Draco. Several burly Unspeakables were lifting him to his feet, and Harry was reminded horribly of Bertie Crouch Junior, begging his father to save him… but Bertie Crouch Junior
Twenty minutes before the moon came up, there was a knock at his door. It was Malfoy. He held a plate with tin foil over it, and looked nervous.
“No,” said Draco. Clarence kissed his nose. Clarence loved him. Draco had never felt sure of Harry, and it was wonderful, knowing,
He was very nervous about going to the Burrow, but Ginny jumped into his arms the moment he arrived, wrapping her legs around his waist and crying “Draco!” in what was clearly a purposefully ostentatious show of affection. It seemed to work. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were cordial, reminding him of how Ron had been in the hospital. Although Ron was much more friendly than before. He admired Draco’s new broomstick for ages, and they talked about aerodynamics and the broomstick regulations in the Quidditch league, and Ron didn’t insult him once.
The failed trip to see Draco had an unforeseen advantage. It seemed to convince Chief that Harry was out for blood, and that he could be trusted in the particulars of Draco’s case. The next morning, Harry was called into the Department. After he had explained that his desk was not warded, he answered Chief’s questions about Draco’s character as vaguely as possible.
“Christ,” said Draco. “When I grow up, I’m going to live in a big house all by myself and tell secrets in safety.”
“Are you okay?” asked Harry, sounding concerned, maybe, so Draco lined up their bodies, wrapped his arms around Harry’s strong, steady body, and kissed him.
“That’s all right, Draco,” said Hermione, with a loaded, serious look in her eyes. He got the impression she understood.
“I decided that you saying all that stuff doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean you don’t know me,” said Draco.
“You’re not drunk?” asked Draco uncertainly. Harry shook his head. Draco’s right hand went to his left forearm. Harry lifted it, rolled up Draco’s sleeve, and put his hand on the Mark.
Malfoy nodded slowly and trailed after Harry. He dragged his feet on the stairs, and stopped when he reached Harry’s bedroom door.
“Yes,” said Harry, because it was obvious, and it was a stupid question, even though of course it wasn’t.
“I think we just recapped last night in a way that I could understand,” said Harry. “Casual, exclusive friends-with-benefits.”
“You understand, Adelaide, that we’re going to have to put you in a care home,” said the Auror with the clipboard.
Malfoy always disappeared as soon as Harry arrived, which annoyed Harry for some inexplicable reason.
But he didn’t speak anymore of Harry loathing bits of him, and although he still woke up in the night, it was less often.
“Of course not,” said Malfoy. “I’m just as shocked as you are. I thought you were some wise-beyond-your-years twenty-year-old. I felt a bit weird about it.”
“Pass,” he said. He hadn’t used a pass in weeks. Normally it didn’t come up. They talked about Harry, or abstract ideas, or Quidditch.
Malfoy nodded. He seemed a bit more relaxed now. He took in Harry’s kitchen, and Harry suddenly saw it through his eyes.
“There’s not… another way she could have come back, is there?” he asked, casually. “Beyond being a ghost?”
“Oh, that’s no problem,” said Hermione dismissively. “Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. We used it in second year for polyjuice potion and it was fine.”
Pansy: This one has a country house in Dorset. Dorset’s lovely. He says he likes your nubile body, Draco.
If someone had told Draco a year ago that Ginny Weasley would someday be the light of his life, he would have laughed in their face. Well— he would have looked at them with harrowed eyes and expressed a mild but listless disbelief. He hadn’t really been up for laughing, a year ago. That was one of the reasons Ginny was so great.
, happy half birthday! You look quite bamboozled. Draco told us to buy half a gift, but I’m still trying to get you to like me again, so I bought you this very expensive port and these antique port glasses. Would you like me to tell you how much it cost, altogether? Because it was a lot.”
Harry Floo’d to Ron and Hermione’s, even though it was too late, really. They were in their pyjamas, making hot cocoa.
The weekend came quickly. Draco avoided Harry during the day, and Harry climbed into his bed in the night. The second night, Harry woke up when Draco heard an explosion in his sleep. After about ten minutes of whispering quietly into Draco’s neck—words Draco didn’t quite register, because he was breathing too hard—Harry took off Draco’s clothes and went down on him.
“No,” said Draco. Adelaide’s face was glazed with disbelieving horror. “No, she can stay with me—can’t she?”
Harry wasn’t convinced, but he didn’t fancy dissecting his flaws with Draco, whose hair shone silvery white in the morning sun, and who seemed so very contented.
“It’s none of their business what you do with your body,” said Draco. His voice sounded too fierce. He tried to calm himself. “It’s no one’s business. It’s
It didn’t matter. People were dying. Malfoy wasn’t the person he had thought he was. Harry had to do the right thing, no matter how wrong it felt.
“Ten minutes,” said Croome. He smacked Timothy on the behind and disappeared through a door behind the counter. Timothy bit his lip, frowning, and bent his head over an enormous ledger with a barely audible sigh.
He went on Wednesday evening, because he was going mad waiting for Thursday, for Draco. He kept going back and forth on what had happened on Sunday morning. Sometimes he was pretty sure he’d been a dick and had hurt Malfoy’s feelings. Other times, he was equally convinced that he needed to protect himself from Malfoy before it was too late: he had a girlfriend, after all. Harry couldn’t make up his mind. He thought it might be easier, with Draco there. But he was impatient, and time passed too slowly. Visiting Ron on the night shift was a welcome distraction.
Draco stayed in his arms for a long time, much longer than a hug. It was the length of a realisation. When he pulled away, he looked stunned.
“I don’t need your protection, Potter. Now that my friends know about the wizarding world, I can just get a flat and put it under the fidelius myself.”
Draco watched her eat and wondered if this was payback for what a little shit he had been when he was fifteen. He might have believed it, if she had merely been nasty to him, but that wasn’t the worst thing about Adelaide. The worst thing was how
“I don’t want…” said Harry, then stopped, unsure how to go on. Malfoy moaned, then spoiled the effect by opening one eye to see if Harry was watching him.
He tried not to think about any of that, and to focus instead on the fact that he would be seeing Draco soon. They would touch themselves. He would make Draco laugh. Draco would mock him for never remembering Suriname.
Draco looked as if he wanted to say something more, but he didn’t. He arched up to meet Harry’s lips, instead.
Both of them froze, staring at each other in dismay. Tertius was back. Usually he went out for a few hours after losing his temper. Draco threw her the towel and she hid it under the sofa cushion.
Harry looked around. Everyone at the table had wine or beer, except for Draco, who nursed a lime and soda.
“Look, we’ve all been trying our hardest to support you, because obviously being kidnapped is rubbish and you’ve had a hard go of it,” she said, putting down her pint glass on the wooden coffee table. It was going to make a ring, because the wood wasn’t varnished. Harry wasn’t sure how he knew that. “But you know what? Draco’s had a bad time, too. Everyone thought he’d murdered you, did you know that? And we thought you were dead. Then, by some miracle, you come back, and he thought the nightmare was over, only for you to hex him in the face and serve him divorce papers. So if he wants to be with Clarence, who I’ll admit, is not the sharpest knife in the drawer,
“You’re making a big deal out of nothing,” said Harry, wondering how many hours Malfoy worked; whether he enjoyed it. “I don’t want to be a quidditch player. I just can’t be bothered to go to every single one of your matches.”
A month went by. He was obliged to return to St. Mungo’s, or lose his job. Worried that he would go mad if he didn’t have anything to do all day, he went back to the hospital.
He knew Draco knew what he meant, because he shoved his left arm quickly behind his back, so that Harry couldn’t see his Dark Mark.
It was an echoing warehouse with many, many doors. The walls were lined with crates and oddly shaped bundles, and there was a hooded figure slumped in a chair. A tall, blond man turned towards Harry, wand outstretched.
“Right,” said Draco, because he did remember, only he hadn’t thought this applied. “It’s just that I don’t want to be a force for evil again, and the colonial implications of climate change are—”
“Ginny’s in love with Neville, Harry. She doesn’t know how to tell you because she feels as if she’s supposed to be your reward for defeating Voldemort.”
“Okay,” said Harry. “It sounded pretty bitter. But I’m trying this new thing where I trust you when you tell me things? So I’ll let it go.”
Over the course of what felt like the longest weekend of his life, Harry tried to think through their last interaction without prejudice.
Harry was quite sure Draco fancied Chett. He tried not to think about it. In an effort not to think about it, he slept with Seamus. This was easy to arrange: it was reckless and stupid, so Seamus leapt at the chance.
“I think I left the oven on,” said Draco, which was ridiculous, because he didn’t know how to use his oven. He would have to learn eventually, for
“Uncle Blaise, Aunt Pansy, Millie Bulstrode, Greg Goyle, and the Greengrass sisters,” said Cassie promptly. “And can Sasha come?”
“Well, I’d much rather not,” said Draco. “But I just don’t trust myself—so maybe you could come over this weekend and look at the data, because I’m trying to sort through it methodically, but unfortunately the emotional component makes it harder for me to be unbiased—”
“You really think I could date him?” asked Harry. “It felt as if the world would end if I tried. As if I had to pick between him and everyone else I loved.”
The judge cleared his throat. It was time to hear Malfoy’s sentence. Harry hated this moment. He always looked at the accused and remembered how it had felt to sit in that chair, in fifth year.
for six months when L came into Harry’s bedroom in tears. As Harry looked at L’s fierce, red-rimmed eyes, he had a fleeting impression of their colour, but it was gone in an instant.
Draco looked down, flushing pink. He was fiddling with some grapes on the kitchen counter, plucking them from their stalks and not eating them.
“Fine. Deliver it today, it’s already late. He was supposed to get it yesterday,” he said, and handed Draco an address on a piece of paper.
He hadn’t seen Draco since the whole touching-his-neck-soulfully-in-the-dark thing, but they had been texting normally, sort of, except they continually butted up against forbidden topics and moved away from them imperfectly.
He fled. He didn’t want to be in the flat. He never usually left her alone there, he knew he was being irresponsible, but he was terrified he would say something he couldn’t take back.
. They didn’t start it until half past ten, and the film was approximately eight hours long, or so it felt to Harry. He nodded in and out of the narrative.
Harry filled up a glass of water and handed it to Draco, who promptly spilt it all over himself and looked aggrieved.
“Can we go upstairs?” he asked, in between kisses. Harry nodded, bewildered. He knew he should probably stop this, check Draco wanted what Harry did (and what did Harry want? The question conjured instant, dreamy visions of a neat little house, and Draco turning towards Harry with a smile and a cup of tea, as if it were normal and comfortable that he was there…). But Harry was too turned on to think, and he and Draco went up the stairs hurriedly, in silence. Well, Harry was silent. Draco kept laughing.
“I think you need to write down all the things that make you happy— little things, like mint tea in the summer, or roof gardens, and big things, like spending time with family—oh, I’m sorry.”
Tertius had crushed Draco’s fingers in a door hinge six months ago. They were still crooked. He grimaced at the memories and stretched his hand, aware of how fragile every part of the human body was, how easy it was to damage it.
The waiter brought them two Aperol Spritzes. The drinks came with a small bowl of crisps. Draco extracted the paper napkin out from under them and got out a pen.
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. “Faithful, platonic two-year marriage. Deal.” He held out his hand. Draco stared at it for a moment, then shook it. “What do we tell Cassie?”
“But that’s fine, isn’t it, it’s fine if I never see you again, because it’s what you deserve, that’s what you think. What about what
“Doesn’t mean they’re dating,” said Harry, turning around to look at Draco himself. Draco’s lips were drawn in a hard line. They looked completely untouchable, and yet Astoria Greengrass had kissed them.
“…and then Malfoy showed up dressed as a Russian Czar and started knighting everybody, it was wicked!” said Ron.
He spent that evening pulling out every item of clothing Harry owned and dividing them into “acceptable” and “please donate to someone you dislike” piles. Harry thought it was all a load of bollocks, but to his surprise, it really was easier to get dressed in the morning with L’s new system. It was even easier to be stylish, because L had paired together likely outfits. Hermione and Ginny both remarked on Harry’s newfound sense of fashion, and Harry felt better, sexier.
They took their ice creams to the empty back room, and Scorpius finally relaxed, for the first time since they arrived that morning.
“You look handsome,” said Andromeda, which Harry thought was beside the point. Obviously Malfoy looked
Fifteen minutes later, there came a loud series of clatters in the stairwell that re-awoke Walburga.
The garden still calmed him, at least. It was morning, and the lilies were more luminous than ever. He sat at the slatted wooden table having a nice pot of tea and trying not to feel furious at whoever had kidnapped him and fucked up his life.
“I’ve still got three months,” he said. “I don’t have to tell him yet.” Maybe by the time Harry found out, Draco would be too ill to notice any further heartbreak.
They ended up on the sofa, the way they used to sit in Slytherin, Pansy stroking his hair, telling him that he had been horribly treated and that everyone ought to feel very sorry for him. He smiled through it, dazed, still, by her return. It felt as if she had brought him back a piece of himself, clicked it into place. Looped him back to the Draco who’d been popular once, and happy, and sure-footed.
“The Ridgeway,” said Draco, nodding at the path with his chin and striding forcefully ahead. “It’s an ancient road. Bronze Age, I think. Figured it might take us places. All right, look, you know I’m a dreadful coward—”
Harry tried to follow what he was saying, but it was hard, because his stomach ached. Different parts of his body were always hurting, and he had given up trying to figure out why. It was probably all psychological, anyway, which made him feel stupid.
There was no one to celebrate with. He would see Ron and Hermione on Tuesday for bagels. He would tell them then. They wouldn’t be all that happy, in any case. They had both developed an unnerving habit of becoming
Pansy: Fine! I’ll admit it! I already made you an account on the Sugar Daddy website, and you’ve had twelve requests since Wednesday.
It frustrated Draco, how difficult it was to get Adelaide interested in magic. She treated it like some favour she was doing him, and seemed to think the whole thing was deeply uncool.
He wasn’t sleeping well, which made it harder for him to control himself. He was so tired all the time. Maybe if he hadn’t been so tired, he wouldn’t have broken down the way he did, the next time Harry commanded him to do something.
“Milly?” asked Malfoy in surprise. “Luna Lovegood married Milly Bulstrode?” They were walking along the Thames, having just left a drinks party at Eve’s.
“Draco, come on. It’s fine if you’re not okay. Quite apart from anything else, you’ve had a pretty rough year.”
“You’ll feel left out, if we can all fly, and you can’t,” pointed out Harry. Draco reeled at the thought that
“Potions, Transfigurations, Runes, Defence Against the Dark Arts,” he said. He had picked them because he had some vague notion that one day he might become a curse-breaker, but when he listed them they seemed like a Guide For How To Be The Next Dark Lord, and he wished he had chosen less suspiciously. Muggle Studies, for instance. But no, that would probably seem as if he was trying to take them out from the inside. There was no winning, really.
Did he? Harry didn’t remember noticing how handsome Cedric was, except in a competitive sense. He hadn’t been awake enough to himself back then to understand why he found Cedric so frustrating. Or Malfoy, for that matter.
“It sounds a bit insane when I say it out loud,” he said. “Potter, in love with me.” He slanted a look at her, to see if she was laughing at him. She wasn’t. “Doesn’t it sound as if I’m imagining things?”
L smiled. Harry caught it in a glimpse, but a moment later it was gone, and Harry couldn’t recall it.
“‘just my job,” murmured Malfoy, and slipped quietly out of the room. But the potion and the house hadn’t been part of Malfoy’s job. It occurred to Harry that Malfoy had actually behaved with extraordinary grace since the divorce. For the first time, Harry wondered whether he hadn’t maybe been a little inconsiderate of Malfoy’s feelings.
“Thanks,” said Malfoy, when Harry gave him the book. He took it away upstairs and didn’t come down for dinner. Harry hadn’t seen him eat yet. He hoped Kreacher was feeding him.
But Malfoy didn't know that Harry had been a crazed stalker, so from his point of view, Harry hadn’t seen him since the summer after the war. They had run into each other a few times then, at funerals, or trials, and once at Luna’s house.
Venice, thought Draco. With Harry. To learn everything there was to know about flying and quidditch.
And so began their unlikely correspondence. For every four or five lengthy letters Harry sent, Malfoy wrote him one back, never longer than one line.
“I know you are,” said Harry. “You always find a way to show me. I understand what an unsolicited cup of tea means in the language of Draco Malfoy.”
They lay in bed, sticky and silent, staring at each other. Harry let his eyes trace every feature of Draco’s face; the pale eyebrows, the sharp chin, the white blond hair that fell into his eyes.
eighteen-year-old girlfriend. But Adelaide seemed genuinely to love him. She cried when he left the house. She
“Because he’s worried about how it would make Harry feel, of course,” said Astoria from the door. “Can Millie come in? She’s been sitting in the corridor under a disillusionment charm for
“That I’m sleeping with an arrogant prat,” said Draco, but then Harry looked disappointed, so he added, “I don’t know, that we’re… seeing each other?”
“Do you lie awake at night coming up with these?” asked a woman who was still only wearing nipple pasties, a thong, and a metric ton of body glitter. The rest of the table shushed her. Draco waited until silence had fallen before continuing.
“Blaise,” said Harry, and he must have sounded rather threatening, because they both stood, and Draco brushed quickly past Harry, saying “I’m glad you came” in an undertone as he left.
“Weird,” said Goyle, but he lifted his sleeve and held out his arm. Harry took a deep breath and looked at it.
Harry had been writing to Malfoy for over a year and a half when Ron and Hermione convinced him to come to Hannah Abbott’s birthday party.
And once, memorably, some Ravenclaw seventh years held him up against a wall in the dungeons and beat him up. They didn’t get far. The orgasm that Draco re-enacted was so loud that Harry heard it in the great hall. By the time he got to the dungeons, the Ravenclaws were standing in an awkward semi-circle around Draco, who writhed ecstatically, saying things like
“I don’t want to talk about it,” said Harry, and so Draco monologued for twenty minutes about a new routine he was working on, where he’d begin in a suit of armour. He showed Harry different fabric options and gesticulated too much and said ridiculous things and generally made Harry forget about the warped skin faces of the murdered young men. Harry lounged on a pile of cushions on the floor as Draco put on about a million woolly scarves and took them off again to prove that anything could be sexy. Draco strutted around the small flat, tossing his head and making grand pronouncements like “Wool. Don’t fuck with it… but don’t fuck
The first word on the list was “arrogant”. From then on, every time he thought he was better than someone, he caught and berated himself. There was nothing he was too good for now, he decided.
“He isn’t. He isn’t vengeful. You have to understand, Harry: after what happened in fifth year, Mysteries has come under a lot of scrutiny. Chief isn’t trying to
of it, he felt like a man dying of thirst who had just had a glass of life-giving water snatched from him, but there was nothing to be done. He closed his eyes.
He went into his bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. Neville had given him a plant three months ago, and it was very much dead, but throwing it away felt like giving up. Harry held out hope that one day he would water it, and the plant would get a lustrous second wind.
“I’m going to bed,” said Harry, and stalked out of the room. He lay in bed and was so lonely it was hard to breathe.
Draco glanced at Ron, then saw Harry, and looked quickly away. Nancy opened the cell door and Draco went in. He knelt before the bench and spoke to Adelaide in a low voice.
“You must be Harry,” said a woman with pink hair and a nose ring. “I’m Eve. The two over there who look so disgustingly in love are Nick and Flora.”
Draco appeared at the guard’s elbow as the guard bent to help Harry to his feet. He was wearing handcuffs and his eyes were fixed on Harry.
It was a rickety, dark, gloomy little shop, crowded with things that, if they weren’t illegal, were at least illegal-adjacent. Harry wore his invisibility cloak, because Hermione had impressed upon him that going after Malfoy would put Malfoy at risk.
“Look, I know you’re trying to figure out if you want to kiss me or hit me, but I’m really very tired, and—”
“Does he?” asked Draco in surprise. He hadn’t been to the Cloisters in weeks. Somehow he had been too busy. Harry had been visiting his mother’s grave without him? The thought filled him with an intoxicating mixture of guilt and gratitude.
“You told me you weren’t upset that I’d written the list. You were just disappointed you hadn’t found anything on me, weren’t you?”
“He never killed anyone,” said Harry. “Although it wasn’t for lack of trying. He did almost poison my best friend Ron.”
“That’s because you’ve got a hand full of thumbs. I don’t know how you manage to do your shoelaces, you’re so clumsy.”
“I can’t just let him think…” Harry tried to slow himself down. He didn’t want to be rash. Draco’s life was at stake; he would get the Kiss for sure if Harry and Hermione couldn’t prove someone else was responsible for the leaks.
“I don’t like blood,” said Draco. “I know meat isn’t usually bloody; but I don’t want to be even peripherally involved with it.”
“I’d like them five months ago, when I might actually have been able to enjoy them,” said Draco, but he took the plate from Dipsy when he saw her confused expression. “Thank you, Dipsy.”
You can find me on Instagram and (newly) Twitter at @let_them_eat_books if you're interested in seeing the books I've been getting excited about lately!
Harry frowned, but decided not to argue just then. Not when Malfoy’s eyes were still sharp and watery. Harry hadn’t forgotten that the last time Malfoy cried in front of him, he had tried to cast the Cruciatus curse at him.
“And he pretended to be straight,” said Hermione thoughtfully. “He went out of his way to keep the relationship platonic. Even though, by the sounds of it, he’s wanted to date you for months.”
Within about two weeks of dating Draco, it had become apparent to Harry that Blaise was sleeping with Pansy. He frequently came to Draco’s flat when Harry did, pretending he’d come to say hello to Draco and Theo, then disappearing into Pansy’s bedroom.
“You think I’m going to let you slither away to warn him that we’re onto him? You must be dreaming. Why did you come here, anyway, were you trying to get information on me?”
“I love you,” said Harry, the next time they had sex—the next day. He breathed it into Draco’s ear as Draco pushed into him. “I’m in love with you.”
“Why do you come here?” asked Harry, coming closer. Draco stepped aside and gestured for Harry to look out the window. There, six stories down, was the Cloisters.
a high-functioning psychopath. Blaise was—he was everything. He was Draco’s sounding-board, his moral compass, his comfort. His friend. The only person who Draco trusted to give him the advice he needed. If he had just listened to Blaise in fifth year, how different might his life had been!
“Good morning,” said Draco, cheerfully passing Harry the paper. “Got any money for me to steal? Cassie’s not yours, by the way. She’s not mine, either, in fact. She’s a paid actress. We’re splitting the profit, fifty-fifty.”
“Aw, yeah, that was Hugo’s problem, too,” said Ursula. “Posh git. You know he once asked me why I still kept my Nan around?
“If you haven’t got any plans, I think we ought to go on a very long and exhausting walk and then eat an enormous pub lunch.”
Harry went back in and kissed him on the forehead before going to his own bedroom. He had an owl to send.
Twenty minutes later, Harry returned with a large pepperoni pizza, which Draco fell upon with alarming speed.
Harry nodded. They were almost back at his room anyway— they would take Draco to McGonagall and convince her to let them floo to the ministry.
Harry laughed and put a careful arm around Draco’s waist. Draco immediately leant into him, resting their heads together.
look rather the worse for wear. Her hair was streaked with grey already, and she wore black jersey leggings and a long sleeved black t-shirt covered in cat fur.
Draco picked up the sugar bowl and poured the remaining sugar into his tea, which was rapidly turning into sludge.
“Oh, yes. He saw straight into my malevolent soul, into my small-minded, cruel, ignorant, meaningless little heart—”
He didn’t look anything like Malfoy. But then again, Malfoy had never looked like Malfoy, when Harry was with him.
“Don’t let Seamus cook by himself,” said Pansy. “He always blows things up, and he does it on purpose.”
“A prank," said Harry. The idea hadn’t occurred to him. No idea had occurred to him, in fact, since he’d read the words “I’ve decided we should date” in Malfoy’s handwriting.
“Oh,” said Draco, his eyes darting anxiously around the room, as if he was looking for an escape route. “Do you… shit. I thought… do you not want to be with me?”
On that first Bad Day he had when he was with L—because once they started sleeping together, there had never really been any question that they were exclusive—Harry felt more than usually aware of the mark the war had left on him.
“We’re not going to bitch about you in front of her, Malfoy,” said Harry. “That would be a shitty thing to do.”
“Honestly, shut up,” said Ron, taking the magazine to look at the picture. “I’m just glad Draco’s found someone who treats him right.”
Harry watched the memory where he first knew Draco was in love with him. They had been sleeping together for six months. Harry wondered if
Draco mimed being stabbed in the heart, holding the wound and rolling his eyes to sky dramatically, like a martyred saint.
weird, but also it felt like something he wanted to inspect much more closely, possibly with his mouth.
“This is serious, for me,” he said. “If you don’t tell me otherwise, I’m assuming you’re my boyfriend.”
“No,” he said. “I know you don’t mind. I was just being polite. In fact, I was hoping I could stay with you for a while.”
—and winced. He tried to play on the piano, but couldn’t stop thinking about Draco spacing out, staring at the fireplace, at the flames, as though he saw his future there.
Draco didn’t answer for so long that Harry actually checked his phone to see if the call had cut out.
He could have, if he wanted to. Malfoy went out all the time. He was at every event, every party. But Harry couldn’t seem to leave his house except for work, or bagels every other Tuesday at Ron and Hermione’s. He tried sometimes, but it felt like he was underwater. That was why he’d decided to try drugs; he wanted to know if that would have made a difference. It had, of course, but it wasn’t exactly a sustainable solution.
Harry touched each of Draco’s fingers, sweeping his index up their long narrow length, stopping at the last knuckle before moving on to the next. The pale hairs on Draco’s arm stood up on end, and when Harry had done one hand, Draco gave him the other as obediently as if Harry had commanded it.
“My father and I are very grateful that you are allowing us to meet,” he said, in the same formal tone Harry remembered him using that first time in Diagon Alley. “It’s very generous of you.”
Draco insisted on inviting Harry to the engagement party, even though Ginny looked at him as if he was crazy.
“Just,” said Harry. He hadn’t thought this through. He never thought things through. “If someone made—a mistake. In a potion. Could they fix it.”
“Maybe you’re right,” said Harry. “But maybe that’s the point of family, right? Having someone who’s biased towards you? Who thinks you deserve to have everything?”
, you understand? And that sort of loyalty has to be paid for. We pay by suffering the small betrayals.”
“It’s…not been so bad, living with you, Potter,” he said, and Harry smiled, because he knew that in Draco-speak, he had just been given a priceless compliment.
Harry laughed at the appalled expression on Draco’s face. This was the most he’d spoken outside of their rooms in days, and Harry liked it.
Crabbe was dead, and Goyle was in prison, but it was all right. Draco was quite good at being alone. He squared his shoulders and made his face look bored as he searched through the train for an empty compartment. When he found one, he settled himself into the corner and tried to amuse himself. He watched the children wishing goodbye to their parents and filled in their conversations.
Harry rested his head against his kitchen cabinet and sighed, wishing he was doing something more agreeable, like being tortured, or literally dying.
, I’ll admit,” he said. “But… in all seriousness, Harry, I was worried about him. I see now that all my scheming has come to nothing, but it was worth it if there was even the smallest chance it would…” he twisted his mouth. “Change the path he was on. But it didn’t. So. Are you going to put me in prison?”
Cassie laughed, and then Harry couldn’t hear them anymore. Excitement churned in his stomach. This was his life now. Cassie and Draco bickering like an old married couple, and
“Yes, living out my boyhood dreams of stripping!” He raised his eyebrows. “Although I guess it’s true that my parents know I’m gay and haven’t disinherited me.”
“Manners are the best defence,” said Malfoy, without looking at Harry. Harry bit back a laugh. It was no wonder that Scorpius spent half his time quoting his dad, when he insisted on speaking in aphorisms. He could practically see Scorpius filing “Manners are the best defence” into his head for later use.
The first time Tertius hit him, it didn’t come as a surprise. Adelaide had laughed at something Draco had said, and Adelaide belonged to Tertius, so Draco didn’t expect anything else, really. Adelaide didn’t look surprised, either. Draco reeled backwards, still apologising, and Tertius’ bad humour fell from him like a veil.
He knew he could have figured it out, in fifth year, when his brain was sharp. But he was so muddled with fear all the time—had been, for so long—that his thoughts were cloudy and slow. He would sense a solution, then think,
, he’d said, twice. Harry knew that he wasn’t the right person to talk to Malfoy about his insecurities, but he also suspected Malfoy didn’t
“Yes,” said Draco immediately, then widened his eyes in horror as he continued to speak. “I drink with her sometimes. Wine with dinner.”
He shrugged himself free of Hermione, grinned at Harry, and went to the fireplace. Cassie went to stand beside him. At the last moment, when the green flames burst up, and they surely thought no one could see them, they fell towards each other in an embrace that was like magnets clicking together.
“You is feeling angry since visiting bad Jaggers,” she said. “You is feeling that the manor is all you have left, and you is scared of losing it. You is scared of losing me, too. You is trying to lose me on purpose so you don’t lose me on accident.”
Harry raised his hand very, very slowly. Touched Draco’s face. Draco’s eyes fell closed, and he breathed a shuddery sigh.
