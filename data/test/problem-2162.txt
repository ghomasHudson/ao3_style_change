Shit, shit, shit, shit,
About him, probably, and Ginny, and the League, and how well their kids were doing. He could feel their eyes on him as a prickling at the back of his neck, as he narrowly avoided being hit by a stray Bludger.
“To the bookstore?” Yes, Harry wanted to say. I want to go with you anywhere. “Why? I mean, yes, sure.”
“What?” Harry looked up. Ginny was giving him one of those steady uncompromising looks of hers, the kind that she usually exhibited in the air, or when it came to taking the trash out. She hated taking the trash out. Harry usually did it for her.
“Yes and yes. And no, you don’t have to wear Muggle clothes.” Harry racked his brain for his schedule for the next week. “I can do…Wednesday next week, after my shift? I have to go to my Archive Studies course afterwards, but it doesn’t start until seven, so we have some time.”
“Yeah! We don’t have any in print, unfortunately, though I could order some in if you’re interested? But there are digital books if your boyfriend has an e-reader.”
Draco stood up, collecting his hat. Harry shifted in his chair, ready to get up. “Yeah. Look, I—what now?”
This was news to Harry and apparently also to everyone else. Pansy was staring, Padma and Blaise were frowning, and Dean and Seamus, who didn’t know Draco well, were puzzled. Gilliam was looking at Draco with interest, however. “Woodwork? That sounds very interesting. What is that about?”
An hour and a half into the game and several rotations later—Alice and Rachel had rotated back in—the Butterfly Bumpkins were in the lead with a hundred points to sixty, and Harry’s entire being was on fire with adrenaline, almost as if he were in the air himself. Anthony had chased the Snitch once, but lost it, and when the other Seeker had gone after it he’d distracted her by zipping in front of her and doing a barrel roll. A freaking
“What is it?” Betty piped up.
“It’s a bit early for supper,” Draco said, thoughtfully. “But I know a good place for tea?”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, relieved she didn’t seem injured and that there’d been no outburst of accidental magic.
Harry looked up from his soup. “Uh. Malfoy?”
“Both,” Harry grinned. Draco knew what he smelled like? “It’s supposed to embody rain and spring. So it’s like comfort and excitement all rolled up in one.” He grabbed five of them to take home, to make sure he wouldn’t run out just yet.
He needed to see Malfoy again. He
“How’re you feeling?” Harry asked him, afterwards. Draco’s face was buried in Harry’s side, perilously close to his armpit. “What are you doing down there?”
“Mhmm, yes I think so. Whatever you’ve got in the next century.” Malfoy tapped the pencil against the notebook’s open pages. “Come to think of it, why are the Irish reports here and not in Ireland?”
Harry didn’t know how to react to that. He could barely comprehend what was happening; that Draco was having some kind of strong emotion about Harry’s fucked up past instead of giving him the silent treatment, or unloading his anger and hurt on Harry—it was like there was a script, but the script was all wrong and Harry didn’t know what would happen next or what he was supposed to do. Nothing was turning out the way he’d expected, or feared, or was hoping for.
“Okay, yeah. Okay. Yes. Definitely.” Harry lingered for just a second. “I’ll see you later, then.”
And if he was even more honest with himself, he was too busy.
He closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath. Exhaled. Opened his eyes again and focused on the pamphlets in front of him.
Charlie held his hand over the broom, which was no longer hovering a foot above the ground, but lying flat on the grass. “Up!”
“So, standing invitation to join us at the pub on Friday, as usual,” Harry said, gesturing at the pub. “But I actually wanted to ask—on Sunday I have my first Little League game. Do you want to come? I’ll reserve you a seat with the team if you’d like? I mean, it’s for parents and other family members of the team, but as captain I get seats too.”
Harry kissed Draco again and then jogged back to Ginny and the teeming mass of excited children and parents and assorted family members. Ginny handed the kids off to Harry with desperation, which Harry thought wasn’t entirely fair. He had only been away with Draco for a moment.
Harry wanted more than okay.
His hat, at least, looked normal, being a short and droopy pointy hat with an ordinary brim, all black, though his brim was also fastened to the hat on one side. No fluffy feather, though, just a silver brooch keeping the brim in place. Harry had never worn anything as obviously fashionable and flashy as this before, aside perhaps from his robes for the Yule Ball in fourth year. He hadn’t had any dress up occasions since—no festive ones, at any rate—and this felt like a festive outfit, almost.
Rage rose up in Harry’s gut, the blood rushing in his ears.
“Ohh, all right,” the staff member said. Her name tag read Lisa. “What does he like?”
But most of all, Harry couldn’t get the look of Draco’s face out of his head. Maybe it would’ve been easier if Draco had gotten angry, if they’d ended up shouting at each other, but the way Draco had just shut down, all the colour draining from his face…Harry had hurt him.
Harry grunted and took another bite of his sandwich.
“Yeah. Wild house-elves are tricksters. They pop up in Muggle literature, in their myths. They hide things and steal food and can be heard giggling, that sort of stories. In some cultures Muggles leave food out for them on particular holidays. So elves live in Muggle houses too, but they vastly prefer magical homes. Captured elves, that’s…something else. Once you’ve captured an elf, you’ve ruined that elf for the rest of their life.”
“There aren’t any shoes dropping,” Harry said, though he couldn’t help but wonder—what if sex was a shoe?
Harry had been busy enough lately that he hadn’t had much time to read, and it was at least partially because he was spending a lot more time with Draco than he’d done before. Draco loved curling up with Harry on the sofa, reading a book, but Harry often had homework to do and would be reading textbooks or writing essays as Draco zipped through book after book.
“Thanks?” Seamus raised an eyebrow.
Harry looked into his bowl of food. He hadn’t touched it yet, not really hungry—or too anxious to be hungry. “It’s that…my entire life I’ve had to do a lot of things I didn’t want to do, but had to do anyway. Sometimes because I was punished if I didn’t,” he said, thinking of Petunia and her frying pan, “and sometimes because the safety of other people and the world was at stake, you know? There was…a lot of shit.”
something, to not just sit there like an idiot and let his life fall apart. He pushed the blanket aside and stood up from the sofa, and for a moment everything went white and he nearly tumbled over the coffee table.
Harry stared at her. The realisation that she was right came crashing over him and abruptly he remembered what Gladys had told him about patterns—
Harry let out a breath. “I don’t know. I’m thinking about it…what do you think?”
“Yeah, well, you’ll find out soon enough,” Harry said. “Once you get kids. When your kids get big enough to start trouble, all bets are off.”
“You had an elf,” Harry found himself saying. “Dobby.”
But the last person he wanted to see right now was Ginny. Harry didn’t think he could look at her, let alone talk with her, without…feeling guilty. Guilty that he hadn’t felt like this when Ginny had left, like something important had been taken from him, and guilty that he was struggling to even get through the day. It felt…unfair, somehow, that breaking with the person he’d been with for seven years had been relatively smooth, while now…Harry hadn’t been with Draco more than six weeks, Harry realised, though it felt like it’d been longer.
Harry glanced back at the stands, hoping he would get a glimpse of Draco, and was surprised to see a swarm of something maroon—the brightest of the Butterfly Bumpkins team colours. Abruptly, he remembered the badge Draco had given him and tapped it with two fingers; a number of maroon butterflies erupted from it, wings dark and glittery at the edges, and fluttered upwards to join the swarm over the pitch.
Not the whole family, though. Just Dudley. The Dursleys as a whole could still shove it as far as Harry was concerned; the last time Harry had seen them had been a few days before his seventeenth birthday and he’d fully intended it to stay that way. They’d gone into hiding and Harry had never cared to find out what happened to them, if they’d come out the other side alive, or if Death Eaters had found them, or…anything, really. (He’d been surprised to discover he did actually still have a lot of anger aimed that way.)
“Yes, for ceramics—”
Harry was vaguely aware that Dean and Seamus were exchanging glances and nudging each other and also whispering something, but he didn’t care. Ginny had asked if he was gay. He’d said no.
“I know I’ll be fine. Can’t help being anxious anyway. That’s just how it is.” Draco adjusted his robes, though there wasn’t a thing to adjust; his collar was straight, the brocade lapels flush against his chest, and the light cape over his shoulders draped just right.
The knot in Harry’s chest tightened and then dissolved into pure, hot hatred. He hated this conversation, he hated the War, he hated the Dursleys, he hated every single facet of his life that had brought him here, to this garden, to this very moment, and made him have this conversation. But most of all he hated all the damage the fucking War had wrought on not just him, but on the country, and on everyone around him.
“The war never stopped.”
“You're never sick,” Ginny said.
“Yeah…” Harry shrugged awkwardly. “I got it from the clinic. I went to talk to a therapist and…” He shrugged again. “I think that’s me. Maybe.”
“No,” he said. It felt like a whole lie.
Harry opened his eyes to look at Draco, who was looking right at him. His eyes were clear and concerned and slightly blue—the colour of his hat reflected in his irises.
It would be at least three weeks before anyone had games to play, as the schedule wouldn’t be drawn up and revealed until the press conference the following week. Until then, Harry had to register the team name, so they could join the pool, get the uniform specs to the sponsor, and then…well, he had to make sure the kids could play a halfway decent game of Quidditch.
“I did, it was amazing!” Harry told her, giving her a clap on the shoulder while still keeping half his attention on the game. He’d have to rotate Joseph, Denise and Love out soon so Emma, Nathan and Anthony could get their turns.
“Ow!” Alice said, already getting to her feet by the time Harry reached her. “That hurt.” She scowled and glared at the DragonTAMERS Beaters, both of whom were looking very guilty.
Harry snorted. “I’m not a saint.”
“Thanks.” Harry threw them in with the rest of Alice’s gear. Movement by the edge of the pitch caught his eye and he looked up; Draco was heading over.
It would be wrong to say that Malfoy made a distressed sound, for he didn’t make a sound at all, yet Harry could
Harry stared. “Why would you care about what I’d think? We were never going to see each other again. I wasn’t going to know.”
“I don’t know.” Percy frowned. He clearly looked like he wanted to. “I’ll ask Oliver—oh, sod it, I’ll come alone if I have to—”
“That’s for me to know.” He stood up. “Let’s get back to work. I want to look at those medieval coroner rolls from Oxford you mentioned last week.”
. Following the cloud, it said
He tossed the letter onto the kitchen table to deal with later.
“It’s a depression thing,” Malfoy said, glancing at Harry. He looked embarrassed. “Like…being so tired and disconnected from everything that I might as well be dead. It’s hard to explain. And it’s not so bad anymore.”
Harry thought Malfoy had maybe got a new haircut. It looked slightly different from before. It made his face look softer. Or maybe it was just the light. Or the fact Malfoy was looking at Harry like he wanted to say a lot of things but didn’t know which thing to say. “Did you want to research some murders or something?” Harry eventually said. “Didn’t you just get started on the 18th century Ireland collection last week?”
“That’s fair,” Peony acknowledged, after a while. “I’m sorry. About everything. I didn’t ask you to come here to make it all worse, I was…hoping for something better. Like maybe we could give each other some closure, or something. I don’t know. What do you want?”
If he was quietly counting down the hours and minutes until he could take a break and talk to Malfoy about Muggle Studies and novels, then that was nobody’s business but his. Quarter past three o’clock he finished a small collection of letters and seized the opportunity; he legged it to Malfoy’s study before Mildred could give him more things to do.
“So…theoretically, I could call up the entire collection of coroner reports and keep in here until I’m done with them?” Malfoy was inspecting the empty shelves.
Harry hesitated. He’d taken this job only to have something to do, and greeting people and fetching documents and occasionally helping with the cataloguing seemed as good a job as any other. Learning the actual ropes? He’d never considered it. On the other hand, he might need something to do after spring, if he ended up closing the daycare (not that he wanted to close the daycare).
Harry let him be.
“Are you offering?”
“Excellent.” She smiled. “Will that be all?”
“I’ll think about it,” Harry said, frowning. He couldn’t envision them ever becoming friends. But then again, he was friends with Pansy now, and she’d literally tried to give him up to Voldemort. He was friends with Draco—he was
They found the café easily enough in the end. There weren’t a lot of people inside, and Harry couldn’t see if his cousin was there—there was nothing to do but just go in and find out.
“Smithereens?” Ginny asked, when Joseph sent another Bludger after the other team’s Seeker. “Where did that come from?”
Harry grimaced.
Alice was worrying her lip, but nodding. After a brief moment, Avery nodded too.
“Wednesday,” Malfoy said. “That’s still your schedule, isn’t it?” His cheeks were a delicate shade of pink, a colour that had Harry wondering if the colour of his cheeks could serve as some kind of embarrassometer. If so, then this was maybe lightly embarrassed? And the red he’d sported when he’d come in was…a different kind of embarrassed. Probably. Maybe.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
get it,” she declared, getting to her feet as soon as the Mediwitch allowed, broom in hand. Harry thought she probably would—in the heat of the game, she seemed to have forgotten the last time she’d gotten knocked off her broom, and the fire she’d caused. Good. The last thing Harry needed was more fires.
The hand on Harry’s knee stilled. “Oh,” Draco said, looking all odd in the face again.
“You don’t get bored? I mean when you’re by yourself and all.” Draco had a hand on Harry’s knee, his fingers going over the knobbly bits as if trying to memorise them.
Harry threaded his fingers through her damp hair. “Can’t we go to the pub first? We can leave early.” He put his nose into her hair, partially to hide his face and partially because he knew Ginny liked when he did that. Her hair smelled lovely, floral and sweet.
Harry wasn’t entirely certain he knew the difference between a butt dial and a booty call, having never had a mobile phone and also little interaction with the Muggle world since he left the Dursleys. He had the creeping sensation that Malfoy might actually know more about Muggle culture than he did. “What’s the difference?” he prompted.
He was with the student for so long that he missed Malfoy coming in, and half feared he’d shown up only to leave again when Harry’d been nowhere to be found, but it turned out Malfoy had gone straight to his study.
“Maybe,” Malfoy said. He picked a book out of the shelf and handed it to Harry. “I was going to lend you this one next. When you’ve finished reading the ones you have now, I mean.”
Harry stopped her, instead escorting her off the pitch. “It’s Anthony’s turn,” he explained, and took the chance to rotate everyone while the game was paused. “And I want the Mediwitch to have a look at you, just in case—”
The pub was uncharacteristically quiet, a fact that could largely be attributed to the fact Ginny wasn’t there. She had a rule of not drinking or going out the night before a game, a rule Harry was not beholden to. He’d show up to her game with a hangover more often than not.
“A good one.” Harry’s heart vibrated with joy. He smiled.
do barrel rolls. Lee and Faulkner were just as surprised as Harry, Lee faltering in his commentary and Faulkner stopping short in the air and then turning to look towards Harry, gesturing helplessly as if saying
“That’d be nice.” Draco frowned. “In romance novels it’s about earning a happy ending. I’m not so sure we—I mean, I’m not sure
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry grumbled. “He’s done with the research. What does it matter that he knows my schedule?”
“Yes—actually, let’s bring them in here. I could eat.” He turned the water off, put the bath bomb aside, and went with Draco to the kitchen.
“No, thank you.” Malfoy had out a single black notebook and a pencil on the desk—no ink, which was also not allowed in the reading hall.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said, and Harry nodded along. He’d never afforded this much thought; he’d thought—like Dean—that magic could fix anything.
“You stay on the playground where I can see you,” Harry said, pointing at the large windows and the swing-seats and sandbox beyond. “We’ll all go together to the field with our brooms as soon as I’ve dealt with this.”
It took all he had in him to not run, but he did jog over.
“I don’t know. It was kind of boring I guess?” Harry frowned. “And frustrating. I didn’t like the bit where they break up. It was stupid.”
“Hmm.” Draco mulled this over. “All right. I’ll go to the tailor, put something together.” He leaned in to give Harry a kiss. “Any chance of breakfast?”
“Good news!” Angelina said, taking a seat and pulling George down with her. “I am no longer breastfeeding! This means wine for me.
The week had gone by in a flash. Draco had declined the invitation to come along to Little League practice, but he’d walked Harry to the Direction Alley exit where he usually Apparated from. They hadn’t made plans to see each other outside of the Archive, yet; Harry had his evenings full most days and Draco hadn’t suggested alternatives. They had been sneaking kisses during every break they took together, though, so Harry wasn’t too dejected about it.
“Yes.” Malfoy grinned. “They’re meant to look like potions, you see.”
in love.
“But…you were raised amongst Muggles, weren’t you? You probably know all about this stuff.” Malfoy’s cheeks were still red, but he looked less embarrassed and more curious. “What was it like?”
“Which pub?” Malfoy had stopped tapping the pencil and was now turning it over in his hands.
“No reason.” He could tell her that Malfoy had not, in fact,
“I’m not—” Harry bit down on his tongue. “I just wanted to have a couple of pints first,” he said, pushing down the niggling fear and sense of wrongness, to somewhere deep enough that it couldn’t, wouldn’t, come back and bother him.
Harry tried to locate a spark of desire within him and came up empty. All he found was love, burning bright and strong in his heart. He’d have to use that. Make do. “I love you.”
“Do you want to move in together? Not here. Somewhere else, somewhere that’s…just for you and me.”
Ron was frowning. “I could talk to Ginny,” he offered, but there was doubt in his voice. Hermione was shaking her head.
“Yeah.” Harry was still holding the cards. He thrust them at Malfoy again.
“No. Well, if you want to be. But you’re the hero in your story.”
One by one, Harry and Ginny saw the kids off with their families and collected all the equipment and confirmed with Oliver and Faulkner that everything was all right when they came by.
“Actually—yes, thank you—but actually, I have something for you,” he said, reaching inside his cloak. He drew out the little black notebook, and then also four books of differing sizes, all with brightly decorated covers. “Here.” He kept the notebook, but handed the books to Harry.
was a pattern, this and all the times he’d gone along with it instead of saying no for whichever reason—avoiding a fight, doing something nice for her, wanting a closeness but not
“There—” Harry paused, staring at the ledger. One and a half pages of it were dedicated to coroner reports, with several dozen cross references listed. “Were you looking for anything specific? We have a lot of those things. Sorry—a substantial collection, is what I should say.”
“I won’t be in until after lunch.”
“No,” Harry replied, snappish. He couldn’t help it, but it stung—he’d wanted to marry Ginny and have kids and a nice house and everything. But she hadn’t wanted kids, and she hadn’t wanted to get married. And in the end they’d broken up.
“In that case I’d like to see whatever you’ve got from the 19th century.”
, but Harry didn't want to say anything out loud lest he speak it into existence. “I called in sick at work,” he tried, dancing around the truth.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. “I go like this all the time.” His own cloak was a different cut from Malfoy’s, a more practical design and made from a sturdy fabric able to withstand a lot of weather. And also, black. “No one is going to look at us oddly.”
“Hey hey hey, if you can’t be nice then nobody gets the blue paper,” Harry said, going over to break up the fight before Alice accidentally set something on fire. (It’d only happened once before, but once was one time too many and it’d frightened them all.) “What’s the problem?”
Malfoy frowned. “I’d have thought…well, I guess the administrative centre and the government are here too, so it makes sense that that the National Archive is here, and…”
She gave him a moment to breathe. “Harry, I’m going to say something I don’t think you’ll want to hear, but that I think is important for you to consider,” she said, gentle but with a touch of authority.
“Were you?” Draco shifted, moving onto his side to face Harry. He had crease lines on his face. “What were you thinking about me?”
“That’s a lovely bookplate,” Harry said, hoping against hope that his voice didn’t sound as unsteady as he felt.
“Hey,” Harry said, suddenly fighting a lump in his throat at the sight of him. He turned to hug Hermione to buy himself a few seconds to get rid of it.
“If you just want a space where you can be contemplative, we can arrange that,” she added. “But I think there’s something you want to talk about.”
the place—is pretty damn
“Me too, Harry.” She pulled him into a crushing hug. “Take care of yourself, okay?”
Oliver released the balls, waited a split second, and then threw up the Quaffle and blew his whistle.
“No.” Harry’s voice was shaky with rage. “How do I know you really mean it?”
The kids were all lined up and raring to go, just waiting for Harry’s permission.
“Pansy honey, much as you’d like to think of yourself that way, you are not a femme. Futch, at best.” Padma blew her a kiss.
“Are you thinking of doing it?” Ginny leaned against the seat, relaxing a little in the shoulders.
“Oh? Yeah. I wanted something floral—it feels stupid now, but I wanted to keep part of my family with me, you know? Despite…well. So I looked at floral names. Nearly went with Lily, but that was your mum’s name, right, and I didn’t think you’d approve, so Peony it was. It suits me better anyway, I think. It means healing, did you know that? I like that.”
Malfoy huffed. “It’s not a spectacular story,” he said. “You know that I got a combined prison and community service sentence?” Harry nodded. “The community service part was in reconstruction. I and a bunch of others repaired and rebuilt what the Death Eaters destroyed—what
The three of Harry’s daycare kids who’d already turned five had all signed up for the Little League team. So many kids and parents had turned up for the try-outs that he had twelve players; seven for a team and five to rotate. Teddy wasn’t among them—he was in the upper age bracket and had joined a team with a base near Andromeda’s house. Harry had been given carte blanche to use the Chudley Cannons home pitch, so here he was, standing in a muddy field in Devon, with twelve excited faces looking up at him, their parents standing at the edge of the field chatting to each other.
Thus prompted into action, the kids all—all but one—stopped crying. They picked up their brooms and trotted over to Harry.
“He went to see you,” she continued, less coolly than before. “He just left, not five minutes ago.”
. Why was he there?
Not only had Harry been unable to focus in his lecture Wednesday evening, he was distracted Thursday morning at the daycare as well, and when he saw Draco at the Archive after lunch he nearly walked into the doorjamb.
“Sex?” Draco asked.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, closing the book. “I’m not sure what I think of it.”
“Yes,” Draco said patiently. “I only meant, can you afford to quit?”
“I see you haven’t lost your way with words.” Malfoy smiled. “Therapy helps. It’s not just about treating my anxiety. It’s also…depression, PTSD—Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,” he clarified, “relating to, well, a lot of things. Accepting responsibility. Learning to live. To forgive. To fix the parts of me that are…that need fixing.”
“I would’ve preferred it if you’d asked me to stop,” Draco continued, making a noticeable effort to stay calm. “Instead of—what were you
Malfoy wasn’t having it. “No, you do not get to pass that Bludger to me. Not again. What exactly do you mean?”
“I told you I had to get rid of the smell of cow dung!”
Harry stood at the edge of the gravel pathway to the Manor, reluctant to go near the building at all, but also unable to spot any other structures nearby. Draco had said the house was a dower house and that his mum had moved into it when both he and his father had gone to prison. When Draco had been released he’d moved in with her instead of getting his own place or living in the Manor as the de facto head of the House.
“Was that the last box? Oh—thank you, George.” A large cardboard box came floating up the stairs, George following behind it. The box joined the large pile of boxes sitting in the middle of the living room. Ginny gave her brother a kiss on the cheek and ruffled his hair.
“Can we do it tomorrow? I was hoping for some proper alone time. We don’t have roommates anymore.”
“Our usual one decided to get busy all of sudden,” Angelina said, looking at Harry pointedly, but there was no malice behind it. “Not that we’re complaining… but Fred has been asking for you, Harry.”
“You’re you,” Draco huffed, giving up. His robes were all dishevelled now. “If you’d asked me ten years ago—if you’d asked me just three months ago—whether I thought it possible that you’d love me, I’d have asked you which potion was messing you up. I’m still not entirely certain this all is real. I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
“That’s very generous of you, Betty,” Harry told her. He had two cards in the making, mostly for show—he had to lead by example—but didn’t know who he’d give them to. Last year he’d made one for Ginny, but this year he didn’t think she’d appreciate one. “What do you think?”
“Your things,” Harry said, frowning. Was she having second thoughts?
“Do you not want to sit outside?”
“What about dinner?”
Harry thought she wasn’t entirely wrong. There still existed a clear split between his daycare kids despite Harry’s best efforts, and he was running out of ideas how to fix it.
“Come back when you get a break, and we’ll talk then.” Malfoy gestured at his neat piles of research. “You know. Oh, and I brought more books for you as well, if you want to…pick some to take home.”
“Tell mum we sent you,” Gilliam added, and then let himself be smooched into oblivion by Blaise.
“Just for us,” Harry said. “Could you put these here together in one bag, they’re for him, but put it all on one tab?”
“Mmh, whatever you say,” Harry said around a mouthful of food. It tasted delicious. He tried to be mindful of all his senses, putting the weather into the pie, the comfort of Malfoy next to him, and found that…well, maybe some of it was bullshit, but there was definitely something to be said for it.
“Yes,” Draco exhaled. “It did. It made all the difference. Because you—you
The kids nodded uncertainly. Harry wished Ginny—he wished he had an assistant coach, so he could demonstrate the exercise accurately.
“No.” The word rolled off his tongue of its own accord, bringing with it a sense of relief, and freedom, and a kind of…exhilarating release. Even as he felt a pang of grief, for all that he’d wanted, and all that he’d hoped for…and a pinch in his chest, for the love he still carried for her. “No,” he repeated, with greater conviction. “This is it.”
“You babysit?” Draco asked. He was speaking softly, softly enough that Harry might not have heard him over the noise of the pub if it weren’t for the fact he’d felt Draco speak. Harry squeezed him gently.
“Not at all…” Malfoy fished his little black book and pencil from his inside pocket. He scribbled something on a blank page, then tore it out to give to Harry. “It’s a small clinic, run by three therapists. Muggleborns, it’s all Muggle science.”
Harry thanked her and headed out.
“Those are some books I’ve enjoyed,” Malfoy said. If possible, his cheeks were even redder. “You asked, the other day. I thought maybe you’d like to try them.”
“Pick one.”
Alice was looking at Harry, afraid still, but curious. “Have you ever had a big emotion?”
He wasn’t sure he really wanted new kids. This lot were his and he’d grown attached to them.
“Are you all right?” She took him to the back room. “You look terrible.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. It only felt like half a lie.
“You should give it to your girlfriend.” Malfoy gave the cards back.
“I don’t think it’s weird,” Harry said. Malfoy’s lip was red. Harry wanted to kiss it. “What’s your thesis about?”
He’d wanted Peony to feel unsettled. He’d wanted to remind her that he was a wizard, a powerful person capable of…anything. He’d wanted the satisfaction of telling her straight up what kind of horrible person she had been and (maybe?) still was. He’d wanted…Harry glanced over at Draco, who’d consumed all of the cake he’d ordered and still hadn’t realised the book was upside down. He was staring so intently at it that Harry had no doubt he was straining his ears to listen.
“Oh, yeah, definitely, we can do the dishes first,” Harry replied, so relieved he could’ve laughed. He went to find a dishtowel, so he could help Draco, and came up with the one he’d transfigured. A quick tap and it was itself again.
“Yes.” Draco sighed. “Can we change the topic? I don’t feel like fighting.”
“Mmh.” Harry looked around. “Why a barn, though? Why not…a real house?”
Harry was staring, trying to believe what was happening—he was paralysed, hot and cold at the same time, and there was this din in his head like a large machine had taken residence there just to make noise.
“Potter?” Malfoy was standing just inside the front doors, twisting a pair of black gloves.
When Harry went for his lunch break, Malfoy was still sitting at the desk going through the files. He was still there when Harry came back, showing no signs of having taken a break himself.
“But not the parts where I touched you, great, thanks—”
earned it already,” Harry argued, and thrust the book at Draco. “I got this for you. When I thought I needed to grovel and all to get you back I thought I’d do it like in the romance novels you like and make a grand statement and everything, and give you a gift because—because that’s what the love interest does, right, which makes
“Would you like to go to a Muggle store sometime?”
How had he managed to fuck up so badly?
“I was actually thinking about your cooking,” Harry said, grasping for the safest straw. “And how much I’d like to do that again. I like watching you cook. And eating the results.”
Harry looked up. Malfoy’s cheeks were pink and he looked both worried and apprehensive, like he wasn’t certain about anything at all. “Yes, please.” The look turned into confusion and Harry hastened to explain, “Sorry, it’s just that you’ve been sharing all kinds of stuff about yourself and I just…I want you to also know me, you know?”
“Well?” Harry grinned at them. “It’s a beautiful day to play some Quidditch and beat the DragonTAMERS to smithereens, don’t you think? Say YEAH!”
“No, therapy makes me feel like sleeping for a week,” Malfoy said with a snort. “It’s fucking
“Yeah? That something you’re interested in?”
“Yeah.” Harry’s throat tightened. “He really does. I like the ones best where they just fall in love and that’s it, but he likes the ones where they fuck up and have to grovel. And, uh, I guess—I mean, we had a fight and all—it’s probably stupid, but if I get him some books he likes, that can be my kind of grovelling?” he rambled, not sure why he was telling this stranger all this, but she had smiled at him and seemed nice, and Harry wasn’t at all sure if this was a great idea.
“Same thing,” Mildred said. “Would you mind?”
wait for an owl. Ginny had wanted him to fight for their relationship and Harry hadn’t; he hadn’t tried to talk to Ginny, he hadn’t responded to her owl, he hadn’t done
Oliver resumed the game, and while it continued in a less dirty manner it was clear that both teams were playing for blood. (Or a very large chocolate trophy.)
“It just came with the robes,” Draco said, showing him the now tear-splotched handkerchief. It was the same colour as the accents on Draco’s robes, but made of a softer material. “It matches.”
Draco exhaled. “No,” he admitted. “But they just…it’s
Malfoy smiled. He seemed a smidgen more relaxed now. “Why the bath? It doesn’t seem…practical.”
Harry had to agree with that. “It makes sense. But if I’m opening the team up like that, couldn’t I choose to only take the less well-off kids?”
Draco had gone white.
It’d been a while since he’d seen her without Ron, Harry realised. That was a sobering thought. It wasn’t that he didn’t like his friends, but since they’d decided to let nature run its course on the matter of children, there was no end to how affectionate they were with each other, and Harry found he had difficulties sitting through it. He and Ginny weren’t like that. He and Ginny weren’t like anybody, actually, not like Padma and Pansy, who weren’t shy about their love, or George, Lee and Angelina, who didn’t care that the rest of the world knew how much they all three loved one another, or Percy and Oliver—there was a couple Harry hadn’t seen coming—or Dean and Seamus, or Neville and Hannah…the only people Harry knew who weren’t all up in their partner’s space were Parvati (single), Blaise (single), and himself and Ginny.
Malfoy worried his lip. “Are you on the clock right now?”
The only option for the location of the house, presumably, was somewhere behind the Manor, so Harry started walking.
The truth was, it didn’t sound all that terrible. The kids would love the idea of a chocolate trophy, and they were enrolled in a Quidditch-themed daycare, after all. Of course everybody and their second aunt thrice removed would get wind of it faster than Harry could get a broom off the ground, but… Harry finished his pint. It could be something to look forward to. He didn’t have a lot of that in his life at the moment, or so it felt like.
Harry exchanged grins with Seamus, Dean rolling his eyes. Draco was silent, though he was nodding.
“Bloody hell,” Harry muttered, eyes flicking over the pages of the article, too fast to really read them as he tried to take in everything at once. He’d thought he’d figured everything out when he’d found out about asexuality—mostly, anyway—but now more pieces were slotting into place.
“All right. Uhm. Why did you drop out of the Auror programme?”
“Hey,” Harry said, peeking in. “You okay there?”
“This is true,” Padma added. “We dated, briefly.”
Harry forgot he meant to ask what Malfoy wanted with all those reports and only remembered when five o’clock came around and he had to politely chase Malfoy out.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco blushed crimson. Not just his face either, his ears were red, and his neck, and Harry was sure if he unbuttoned Draco’s robes the rest of the way, his chest would be aflame as well.
“Merlin’s left tit,” Ginny swore, and then cracked up laughing.
“Yes.” Malfoy looked at Harry. “And medication. It’s a combination of both. So I’m thinking I should write about living, too. The book was a therapy assignment to begin with, so…” he shrugged. “It seems fitting.”
“Sorry about that,” Harry said. “It’s, uh, we shouldn’t really give patrons nicknames, but you’re…because of the coroner reports,” he tried to explain, “not because of, uhm, the War. I mean, you didn’t kill anyone. Directly.”
He had homework to do, as most of Saturday had gone into last minute prep and he hadn’t had the time—or state of mind—to get it done, but he couldn’t honestly say he had either today. Right now, Draco was more important than the reading for Tuesday’s class in Managing Services, Access and Preservation. He’d do it tomorrow after Little League practice.
“Your place. I mean it, please come to the pub with me. Just once. I want to show you that there is a place for us. There is a happy ending—”
“And saw them at work? Yeah, they’re sneaky, tricky creatures. They can make themselves completely invisible, and they have magic we can only dream of. What did you think was behind the moving staircases?”
“So this goes in first? We don’t have to be in the water already for it to work?”
“Mr Harry, are you going to finish your Valentines?” This was Betty. She blew on the ink in her cards to make it dry faster. “I can help you if you’d like.”
Harry had started a daycare and Ginny had put everything into Quidditch.
“It had all grown back!” Harry grinned. “Just as messy as before!” He tugged at his hair, demonstrating just how messy and how much of it there had been. As hoped, the kids burst into giggles at this punchline. He didn’t tell them how the story really ended, about how mad Petunia had been, about how she’d locked him in the cupboard as punishment, about how she’d never touched his hair again after that.
), about his sponsors (
“It’s not a problem,” Draco said, touching Harry’s knee. “Whatever it is you’ll—
The yelling wasn’t subsiding at all. The kids were unstoppable. Their families had poured onto the field to hug and kiss them and dance—Ginny was twirling Jamie and Love simultaneously, both girls shrieking with joy.
There was a sharp intake of air on the other end. “Harry.” It was still Peony, but her voice had gone all rough. “It’s me—I’m Dudley. Peony these days, but it’s me.”
“Are you okay?” Draco asked softly, his arm linking with Harry’s.
“I don’t fucking know what I feel—
Harry regarded him, the way Malfoy worried at his lip, the hint of disgust and anger on his face. “Isn’t there? I was there too, you know. I know you and your parents were just trying to stay alive.”
Ron was elbowing him, commenting something or other, and Percy had pulled out his wand—probably to fix his throat—but Harry didn’t pay attention to either of them, so focused was he on Ginny and the blush in her cheeks. The other team had come down as well, and they were shaking hands. He spotted Oliver, who—despite having lost—was grinning at Ginny as she shook his hand.
He wasn’t with Ginny anymore. But this bed—this flat—had been their shared space. It wasn’t really
“Your delightful murder boy came by just before,” Mildred said, tutting. “I told him you were home sick, of course.”
somewhere. It was entirely absurd to him. And yet, he knew that Draco had turned down his invitation to the pub several times, citing his anxiety, and he’d seen how tense he’d been the evening before when he’d finally come along.
“Delighted,” Draco said in a frosty tone. He didn’t offer his hand, but then neither did Peony.
“We should go, sometime.”
, you are wrong. Where did you get the idea that you don’t get to have this?” He gestured between them. “This is real.”
Harry removed the ice pack to look at her lip. It had stopped bleeding and wasn’t as swollen as it could’ve been. “I’ll put some salve on that. Hugh, you’ve been quiet.”
?” Draco’s frown was gone, replaced with a frankly adorable look of incredulity. “Why?”
Harry’s heart had jumped into his throat. He picked up the pamphlet, folding it open. ASEXUALITY IS THE LACK OF SEXUAL ATTRACTION, it said on the first page.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was the double-crossing double agents. It was all too confusing, and the more I thought about it, the less I believed in the truth we were presented with at the end,” Draco explained. “The parallel timelines, the unreliable narrator—I think she was lying about everything.”
here now.” That part of it was more than nice, Harry thought. Over these past few weeks, he’d seen glimpses of Draco’s core, got really close, as they talked about books and ideologies and told each other things—Draco had perhaps opened up more than Harry had, in some regards—but being like this, skin to skin, was a different kind of closeness.
Alice and the other Seeker were tailing each other and occasionally jostling—though they hadn’t done anything to merit penalties—and time was running out. The Snitch was nowhere to be seen.
“Excellent.” Ginny grinned. “I’ll help you with the paperwork.”
“No, no, it’s fine, it’s fine…” Harry’s throat tightened again. He didn’t know what ‘dissociating’ was, though it was obviously some therapy term, and he could guess at what panic attacks were. Malfoy was trying to be considerate. That was a whole other reason for his throat to go all thick. “It wasn’t that. It’s fine. I’ll tell you about it sometime.”
“Hugh took my bat from me,” Betty said quickly.
He Apparated straight to the Chudley Cannons home stadium. Little League training wasn’t for another hour or so, and the stadium was empty. He hadn’t had dinner, and on an abstract level he knew he should eat something before having to deal with twelve kids, but right now there was no way he could muster the energy to deal with something as simple as food acquisition. Instead, he sat down on a trunk in the equipment room, and exhaled.
“Your gremlins are going to win and you know it,” Draco said and when Harry was going to protest, he planted a kiss on his lips. “Shh.”
“Fair point,” Draco answered, thoughtful. “So…if I find you a romance novel that has a secondary plot you might enjoy it more?”
Draco finally took the book. His chin was a bit wobbly, but he looked at the book and turned it over, and when he spoke his voice was rough. “This is the sequel to that book I lent you the first time.”
“But he made you leave work late?”
The way Draco had phrased it reminded Harry of the way Gladys spoke sometimes. “I’m sorry, too,” Harry said. “I…” The speech he’d semi-prepared had flown out of his brain and now it was all scrambled six ways to Sunday. The book he’d gotten Draco was quite forgotten, the bag left sitting by the front door. “I
“I’m sorry,” she said quietly. Her face was beet red. “I—I’m sorry. I’m trying to be better.”
“Smelling you.” Draco’s voice was muffled. He drew in a deep breath, then dragged himself up. “I’m great. You?”
“What do you need?”
Pansy showed up then, with Padma. “What’s up boys? Anything exciting happen?” They took the other side of the booth, small glasses of fizzy whiskey floating in after them. Harry listened to Dean and Seamus fill them in on the horse farm, making good work of his ale all the while.
“This cousin,” Draco said, slowly, still looking directly into Harry’s eyes, “what did they do to you?”
, but as the fic is set in 2005 I did not include this information in-fic.
her back, if he was to be honest with himself, though whether that was because he was falling in love with Malfoy or because the thought of going back to what they’d had was making his stomach seize up, he didn’t know—but maybe he could fix some of his ugly parts for Malfoy.
“Oh,” Harry said, sitting bolt upright. “Children!”
“Really?” Ginny raised an eyebrow. “You mean to tell me you haven’t actually been running a non-profit daycare for the past three years? I happen to know that Betty isn’t the only one whose parents aren’t paying for you minding her.”
Pansy and Padma had snuck off at some point, and Harry found himself entrenched in a discussion about child rearing and legal issues surrounding fatherhood when the parents aren’t married, and something about a dog, and he just had enough. He spotted an empty seat next to Dean and Seamus, who were whispering something to each other, and didn’t excuse himself before going over to sit there instead.
. The only thing in it that he could claim for himself was the bookcase. It held more books now than it’d done when he first put it together; the books he currently had on loan from Draco, but also the few books he’d purchased for himself or that Draco had given him.
It wasn’t very late in the day, which was surprising to Harry, who felt like hours had passed. But the sun was still in the sky (presumably—behind all the clouds) and people were milling about. It looked like rush hour.
“Harry, what do you want from this meeting?” Gladys finally asked after ten minutes of Harry deflecting everything. “What’s your goal today?”
Harry was brought up short. “Which would you rather it be?” The wild hope in Harry’s chest clamped around his heart.
Ginny was going to break up with him, but he could handle it. Would handle it. Had to handle it.
“Yeah, okay. I’ll stay for the game. Damn it.” He shook his head. “But then you have to come over tomorrow and pick up your things.”
Harry signalled to Faulkner that everything was in order and the game resumed. The Snitch had vanished, Anthony scouting after it diligently, the other Seeker on his tail. “You did good,” Harry said to Alice as she was being checked out by the Mediwitch. “You would’ve gotten it if not for that Bludger, I’m sure of it.”
“Can I ask you something unrelated?”
, you say? I wasn’t aware you already were in love with me.”
“Mmmh. Sure…how do you feel about meeting?”
person in the entire world who felt it. Harry put down the article and choked back a sob; the release of all the anxiety and fear that he had carried around for so long, and which he hadn’t been entirely aware of carrying in the first place, was overwhelming.
(from Hermione),
Harry pulled a pair of pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt out of the wardrobe, realised he’d also vanished his sheets, duvet and pillows, so dug in again for a blanket. He’d sleep on the sofa tonight.
“The sequel to that one came out just last week, so if he doesn’t have it you could get him that one?” Lisa suggested. She plucked the book out of the shelf and handed it to him. “I haven’t read it myself, but I’ve heard it’s great.”
Harry confirmed this and grabbed a basket. “Do you want one?”
“I guess, but…I mean, they’re robots, not…people, or animals. It wasn’t about…well, you know. Genitals. Carnal pleasure.” He wasn’t sure Malfoy would understand, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about the whole thing in the first place. But he’d been burning up inside since reading that book, with the feeling that maybe the author understood—because the author had written a book about a cast of characters for whom sex had nothing to do with the body, inasmuch as the body could be separated from the mind, when one was a robot. “It was about vulnerability and trust.”
The food arrived, and they spent the remainder of their lunch hour talking about due dates and check-ups and possible names, and eventually also the Quidditch Little League. Nobody brought Ginny up again, for which Harry was grateful.
“Is Draco here?” Harry asked, craning his neck to see if he was in the café. “Have you seen him?”
“But?” she prompted.
“You should have big emotions all the time,” Harry said, concerned now. “Big emotions aren’t wrong or scary, even though it can seem like that sometimes. But do you know what you can do the next time you have a big emotion and get scared?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, rubbing his face. “It’s about sex,” he said, slowly, forcing the words out. “It’s about—I don’t—I mean—” He drew in a deep breath, grateful for Gladys’ patience and lack of judgement, and the way she always gave him space to find the words he needed.
“Yeah!” they cheered.
It was ending. That was what was happening.
Draco, on the other hand…looked fantastic. His outfit was all browns and blues with specks of white; brown robes in a textured wool and silk blend, with a high collar and a simple cut with two rows of buttons—ordinarily Harry would’ve thought this kind of robes looked monk-ish, but Draco looked tall and slim and completely ordinary, nothing like the monks Harry had seen pictures of as a child. The robes were cut so a white shirt cuff showed at the sleeves, and a white collar peeked out at the neck. Over the robes he had on a leather cape dyed a dusty sky blue, with a row of brown buttons at the split sleeves, currently closed. The cape was on asymmetrically, covering only one shoulder and held in place with a braided leather strap that went across his chest and under the other arm rather than going over both shoulders. The hat was the masterpiece that tied the entire outfit together (or so Draco and the tailor both had said), being of the same blue leather as the cape. It was pointy, but did not droop; it was all straight lines and geometric perfection, one side of the brim pinned to the hat with a brown button and a large, white, fluffy feather. The cape and the hat together elevated the look (Draco had said) and made it look jaunty and modern—a big concern, since he would be wearing a
Ginny, who’d been chatting with Faulkner and some reporters, came over, the reporters following, so Harry wound up giving the press some statements.
“You want to do the honours?” He gave Draco the bath bomb he’d picked out. “Just drop it in.”
He’d go to Flourish and Blotts tomorrow, Harry decided. He’d pick out a book all by himself and read it and keep it in the bookcase.
“Yes.” Malfoy was quiet for a while. “I think so. I mean, it’s definitely about dying. But maybe it’s about other things, too.”
Well. That was certainly something. Harry collected his change from the phone and sank onto the nearest bench. Had the last five minutes of his life been
as if Draco hadn’t even realised how contradictory his own words were. “Listen Draco, if you think you’re anywhere close to being the same as fucking
“It makes sense,” Harry told him, cupping his face again. “It makes a lot of sense.”
“But what if I want to? I didn’t always…dislike it. And it’s important in a relationship.” Draco’s thumb was still on Harry’s lip and he didn’t want it to go away. He didn’t want Draco to stop touching him, even as their food grew cold, and it was getting increasingly more awkward to sit-stand like this.
No, that wasn’t true. It hadn’t been a week. It had been almost two weeks, because the truth was this: Harry had already started detaching himself from the relationship, from Ginny, the day she went to the Burrow.
“So…” Harry started, when he’d finished half a mug of tea. Lacking a table, he’d set the tea pot and their lemon tarts to levitate in the air, but made sure they stayed within the confines of Malfoy’s umbrella. “About you and Muggles.”
“And those happy endings are at the pub?” Draco shook his head. “Whatever. I’ll come. But I won’t drink.”
“Just my cousin,” Harry corrected. The idea that he didn’t
“Yeah. The silver lining, I guess, is that my old name is still everywhere, so that’s how you found me.” Peony smiled ruefully. “Depending on how you look at it.”
“Honestly? Because there’s the honest answer, which is not very nice, and there’s the generic answer, which isn’t entirely honest.”
He was never in the mood, if he had to be entirely honest with himself, but he didn’t want to be—because then he’d have to think about how odd that was, how wrong, and how maybe, that part of him had died in the forest—
that.”
Harry perked up—he’d nearly forgotten because of the game. “The barn!”
They stayed like that for a bit, just letting the words float between them.
“Why’d you lend it to me?”
“Of course, and we noticed you have some very talented players—do you see a future in Quidditch for them, Mr Potter?”
“Yes, that’s right,” Dean answered, surprised, if a bit wary. “I’m in marketing these days, I design advertisements and labels and that kind of thing, and do my own art on the side.”
“Don’t make excuses for me.” Malfoy turned to look at Harry. There was a bite of steel in his voice. “Allow me to ask you the same. What did the War teach you?”
“Just one thing?”
He left.
“Have you discussed this with your partner?”
“And these are your weapons?” she indicated the pile of bath bombs on the counter she was sorting into bags. Harry had bought so many that she was divvying his into three bags.
“And the romance novel?” Malfoy tapped it with a finger.
, it didn’t matter. This entire thing with Ginny had proved one thing to Harry: he couldn’t do relationships right. He couldn’t do love right. Everywhere he looked love seemed to involve a physicality that Harry couldn’t relate to and didn’t want. It was a bit like getting drunk, really, the getting drunk part was nice, but the hangover was awful. Only, Harry would rather have a nasty hangover than the inevitable downward emotional swing that always came after sex these days; an ugly mixture of rotten mood and the feeling that he couldn’t be in his own skin, sprinkled with sadness and irritability. It wasn’t worth it.
“Windows,” Harry said, finally. “We need more windows. Bigger ones. I want lots of light in here.”
“Do you want to shake on it?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow. He offered Harry his hand.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and looked at Draco. There was a light in his eyes and a smile on his lips, and Harry’s heart constricted and expanded, until all he could feel was nothing and everything, and at the centre of it all was Draco. There was a future here, promise and potential, and so much love to fill it all up. “When can we start?”
“We’re counting on it,” said Pleasance.
“YEAH!” the kids screamed.
“Do you want to go to therapy?” Malfoy challenged.
“Okay,” Harry said, not understanding what she was going on about. “Do you mean like…” he trailed off, not sure what he was asking.
Merlin’s balls on a stick, no wonder his relationship with Ginny had imploded. No wonder—Harry’s breath hitched.
“Oh! Yes. Last night, after practice. Finally. What’d you think of it?” Harry balanced his plate on his lap and speared a roast potato. “I mean, aside from the dreadful capitalist technocracy.”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry smooched him. “Come pick a bath bomb when you’re done.”
“Really,” Harry said. “It’ll be fine.”
Harry picked up the ex libris list. “I can make a note of which ones you’ve already looked at and fix you up a new request form, and then all you have to do is submit it to the front desk tomorrow and you’ll get,” Harry gestured at the trolley, “this, but just the stuff you haven’t looked at yet.”
What the hell was going on with him?
“Well, think about it? You can pick which charity to support, the kids would love it, and everyone would love you. And give me a heads up, I’ll do a spot for you on the wireless.” Lee winked.
Avery and Hugh both looked down. Charlie and Alice weren’t saying anything either, though Alice was glaring at Avery, and Betty looked like she was gearing up for a spectacular round of shouting.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He dropped his robe, trying not to feel self-conscious, and got in the tub. When Harry looked, Draco was unbuttoning his robes with his wand, so he averted his eyes and waited until Draco had climbed into the tub with him to look again.
Malfoy didn’t sneak another cheeky kiss at the archive Thursday or Friday, but he did take breaks with Harry over tea and cookies in the garden, where they discussed the book Harry had just finished reading, another one that Draco had lent him. This one was a Muggle fantasy novel about talking dragons with political opinions, which Harry thought was delightful and terrifying all in one—delightful because the book was funny, and terrifying because the thought of real dragons getting seats in parliament to vote about free sheep for all sounded like a nightmare.
“Okay. All right.” Harry hadn’t touched his tea, which had no doubt gone cold. He didn’t want it. The biscuits had turned into dust—he hadn’t touched them, but nevertheless there was a pile of yellowish crumbs on the plate in place of biscuits. If Peony had noticed, she’d not mentioned it. “You seem more chill about magic than you used to be.”
and they’re our future, and we can do so
“I know,” Harry said, not keen to go down this path again. They’d discussed it at length on Wednesday. “It wasn’t technology so much as the people in charge of it, I think. And those kids! I mean…well, if it were magic, it could’ve been us.”
“Do you have other plans?” Harry asked.
“Go ahead.”
A good number of the captains were—or had been—professional Quidditch players, but the rest of them were a mixed bag of known personalities. Harry didn’t recognise anyone, aside from one person who he thought might’ve been a cookbook author.
Harry’s chest tightened. “I’m not,” he said, “I don’t think so, anyway. But it’s not you, I swear. I love you. I just…” he trailed off, trying to find the words.
Malfoy nodded. Then he turned on his heel and left.
Draco appeared in the doorway to the kitchen with floury hands. “Hi,” he said, unsure. “I, ah, took the liberty to make scones. Raspberry and white chocolate,” he added.
“She’s right, though. In your story,
“So…you’re not going to fix it?” Ron asked.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said. “That’d be ideal.” Then a thought struck him. “Do you—is that why I’m asexual?”
Rachel piped up. “Tell the other team good game!”
You can read more about PCD here:
“Of these, or bath bombs in general?”
“Er…” Harry glanced at the shelf, and then over at the romance section. “I’m not sure. What’s your most dramatic romance novel? The kind that makes you cry and laugh? Or, like…just makes you feel a lot of emotions, I guess?”
The reporter, unperturbed, continued: “Your team registration papers list Miss Weasley as assistant coach, yet we have confirmation that she hasn’t attended a single Butterfly Bumpkins practice so far. Will she be joining you eventually, or will your team go to their first game without an assistant coach?”
Ginny was still looking at him. “You were weird about him.”
Malfoy nodded in greeting and handed Harry the slip.
“It’s an evening course,” Mildred said, smiling triumphantly. “Anyway, I need to get back to this. I’ll put you down for research duty, then?”
“How can I help you?” Harry asked.
“Do you…want to…hang out with me? Go out? Do something? Sometime. Later. Not today! But, uhm, sometime.”
Five minutes before closing, Harry made his way to the reading hall to chase out stragglers and discovered that only Malfoy had remained. Harry sorted the 5th century seafaring maps left by an enthusiast from Cork—fine fellow, but incapable of following instructions—into their trolley, and then went to Malfoy.
no, he’d just tried to avoid a potentially unpleasant situation in the least confrontational way he knew how to.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, woodenly, trying to organise his thoughts. “I never meant to make you feel…that way. I…” He couldn’t think, couldn’t split his attention between his brain, which was screaming about Draco, and Ginny, sitting across from him. He couldn’t—she had to leave. “I love you,” he said. “I want you to know that. I always loved you, I still love you, and I’m sorry. Can you please leave?”
“You’ll play when it’s your turn again.”
Charlie shuffled.
“How…what do you know about Muggles?” Harry asked. “Have you ever met one?” The idea of Malfoy face to face with a Muggle was strange, as was the idea of him interacting with one.
Whatever sprouting feelings Malfoy had sown in him, Harry was going to nip in the bud.
He’d rotated Alice back in as Seeker with twenty minutes to go before the game would be called, and they were twenty points behind. They could catch up easily, but Alice was determined to catch the Snitch this time.
Harry was not on top of things.
“No.” Harry gestured for him to go ahead, then followed with the trolley. He tapped the door, marking the room as returned so that the cleaning staff would know to come by. “It’s all sorted.”
“Excellent!” Draco declared. “If we’re done here, we have places to be.”
“To be fair,” Harry said, “it just kind of
“Therapy,” Harry repeated.
“No,” he said, the word rolling off his tongue like relief. “Absolutely not.”
“That’s an interesting look you’ve got there,” Malfoy said, pointing his fork at Harry’s face. “I’ll tell you one thing. Therapy is hard. It’s ugly. It requires commitment.”
“Draco and I had a fight,” Harry said, then stopped. He didn’t want to say
“Harry.” Draco’s mouth was drawn firm, unhappy. “Am I to understand you didn’t enjoy this?”
“Okay, if you don't want to talk to me, you don't have to,” she said, frowning, “but you're clearly not okay. I still care about you, you know. That didn't stop, just because we…” She gestured between them.
“YEAH!” the kids yelled, punching the air with him. Even Ginny joined in, though she was looking at him like he’d gone round the bend.
Malfoy was in the foyer when Harry arrived. Malfoy typically didn’t show up until around one, after Harry clocked in, but they were both early today, it looked like. Harry tried—though not very hard—to hide just how pleased he was to see him.
“Er—this is a payphone. I don’t have a telephone.” Harry frowned. “I could give you my address? I receive mail the ordinary way…you could send a letter?”
“I didn’t mean it like that.” Draco rubbed his face. “I haven’t put you on some fucking pedestal if that’s what you think. I was just saying you and I are different people. You’re the hero in this story. I’m…a side character. A low-rank villain, one of those who disappears out of the story before it ends, and you never find out what happened to them. I’ve made my peace with it.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, trying to refocus on the kids. “Just distracted, that’s all.”
to me. It was at the Yule Ball I realised I wanted to bang her, not hex her.”
“That you did,” Harry acknowledged. He marked her off on the team roster and saw to it that her equipment went into the right trunks, then exchanged a few words with her mother.
“Just to drive the point home,” Harry said, “Cedric wasn’t my boyfriend. But he was someone I knew, a good person, who died in front of me because I wasn’t quick enough to save him. And you thought it was a great idea to make fun of those nightmares and turn it all into a vulgar homophobic
It picked up on third ring. “This is Peony.”
“Uhm,” Harry said.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, even though that wasn’t the issue at all. He took a bite out of the scone so he wouldn’t have to talk.
Right. Okay.
Malfoy was looking back. “Yes.”
? What kind of person had Dudley become since Harry had last seen him—
“Yeah?” Draco sniffled. “Is that what it felt like for you?”
“Okay, okay.” Harry gave up. He’d done his part to not tempt fate.
“Merlin’s balls, Potter,” Malfoy said, adding another string of expletives. To his credit, the umbrella didn’t flicker. “Just dig right into it, will you?”
Charlie, Avery, and Alice were standing together, in the middle, Charlie already wearing Keeper gear. The rest of the kids Harry didn’t know as well. “Hi,” he said.
“Oh.” Draco looked disappointed. “How come?”
“Maybe if you didn’t always want it it wouldn’t be a problem!” The words slipped out before Harry knew he was going to say them, and then it was too late to take them back.
“Nope.” They set out down the street, towards Diagon Alley. “Why did you ask me to come?”
, or something—which turned out to be a delicate stew of sorts with chicken in wine and vegetables. Harry perched on the kitchen counter, watching Draco finish it off while he rambled about all his ideas for the future.
Then he collected his things and went home, where he knew Draco would be waiting with dinner, probably wearing another dish towel as an apron. He hadn’t said what he’d make, but Harry wanted nothing more than to find out, and kiss him, and tell him everything about his list.
Harry frowned. Draco didn’t say anything, just patiently waited for Harry’s thoughts to get in order. It wasn’t raining today, and the weather was almost balmy, so Draco didn’t conjure up his umbrella. He did expertly arrange their levitating plates in a semi-circle around them; today’s lunch was an array of small dishes with different types of curry, and bread to scoop them up with.
“All right.” Harry resisted the temptation to rub his face. He’d learned the hard way not to show his frustration around small children. “You run off, now, Avery. I’m going to have a word with Charlie for a second.”
“I don’t know.” Gladys had said he had to communicate, so that meant he had to talk. But talking—telling Draco the truth—didn’t seem like it’d do any good. “I don’t know, Draco. It was fine. I guess. I didn’t hate it. It was nice.”
“I enjoyed it.” Malfoy smiled. “We covered other things also. Like the difference between a car bomb and a bath bomb—a car bomb is a device that explodes a car, but a bath bomb does not…explode a bath.”
), about his chosen charities (
Malfoy shrugged. “It is. The general ideology seems to be that if it can’t be fixed with a potion or magic, it can’t be fixed at all. But Muggle therapy—it’s a relatively new thing here, there’s just the one clinic and it’s run by Muggleborns who, rightly, thought not enough was being done for mental illness in the magical community.”
“Did you say
Record-keeping Theory and Practice was getting duller and duller with every week that passed. It wasn’t that it was boring as such; Harry enjoyed it well enough in practice when at work—though at work he had colleagues and also patrons to assist. In class it was all
“We are also open tomorrow,” Harry informed him. “You can come back.”
(being sexually attracted to another person or persons), because this is a common misconception about asexuality.
“I’m not offended or angry. I’m just…tired.” She picked up her bag. “I’ll see you on Thursday. Tell me how it went.”
Besides, he’d have stood out like a sore thumb on the pitch in the new threads.
Malfoy hadn’t come to the Archive that morning, which was both a disappointment and a relief. They didn’t really speak to one another—that communicative mishap Harry had committed on Monday had rather put a dampener on whatever friendship there might’ve been growing between them—but Harry had grown accustomed to Malfoy’s presence in the Archive and had been looking forward to seeing how he’d progress with his research today.
“You got a new babysitter, then?” Seamus asked.
The silence was nearing awkward.
“Yeah,” Seamus agreed.
—though the term is modern—was about throwing money at problems until they went away, throwing money at the poor until they went away, or throwing money at people in order to
“Good choice,” Harry said, standing up. “I think we’re done playing tag for today. Let’s go in and wash our hands. I have a brand-new box of crayons that would like to be friends with you. All right?”
“That’s a lot of…” Malfoy wrinkled his nose. But he went in, Harry following.
“Oh,” said Harry. And then his brain caught up with him. “Oh.” Something bubbled in his gut—nerves, probably, but also something far more excited and happy. Draco had said
“I’ve already been to jail, and so have you.” Harry was done with this discussion. He put his plate aside and got up, pacing. “We’ve had our punishment. That’s enough. I’m not going to continue to punish myself just because. It’s done! It’s in the past! I just want to move on!” He glared at Draco. “I want a normal goddamn life, a fucking happy ending, and I don’t care what anyone else thinks. I want—I
“You’ll know.”
“You knew that would be part of the deal,” she said. “But dentist? Really?”
Draco smiled, his lips forming a soft, lopsided curve. Harry loved it. “Yes.”
“Gin,” he said, rubbing his face. “Let’s just go home.”
Harry looked at the empty bookcase again, trying to keep the dread from turning into an empty hollow, a growing dead zone. He didn’t really want to go through the entire ritual of pretending he wanted to have sex with Ginny, not today. Today he just wanted to start…fitting the pieces of their new life together. New year, new place, new life. But Ginny was looking at him like
Betty assessed his cards. She had only just turned four, but she was smart. “I think you need more glitter.”
“I thought therapy was a Muggle thing,” Harry said, not knowing what else to say.
Malfoy froze in the middle of reaching for a folder. “Excuse me?”
“Little League or Big League?”
It was a small collection, but it was all his—gifts from people who cared about him. Harry regarded the books, battered and worn, several spines showing cracks. Only one appeared new. He rearranged them, first alphabetically by author or editor, then by topic, then by gifter, then by size, then by colour, then again by gifter. He placed the photo book on the shelf below, because it was a different type of book, and the
By the time he got back to the table, Ron and Hermione had arrived, and only just; Ron was helping Hermione out of her coat. Harry greeted them and guided Hermione into the chair he’d been sitting in so he would be at a slightly safer distance from Pansy.
Harry had lost all appetite. Maybe therapy could fix that part of him that was all dead and ugly. Maybe it could fix his feelings about sex. Maybe he could…he’d never get Ginny back—didn’t really
is a good place to start.
Yes. He’d do that. Harry swallowed the last bite of toast and washed it down with orange juice. He’d have a shower, shave—he’d gotten a bit stubbly—find a gift, and then go. Everything else on the list he’d figure out as he went along.
Charlie wouldn’t meet Harry’s eye. He shook his head minutely.
“I haven’t made my peace with anything,” Harry said, his voice rough.
“It tastes even better, and that’s a fact,” Draco said and gave Harry another kiss. “Eat. You’ll feel better. I know I will.” He went back to his chair.
happy for his friends. It didn’t matter that he and Ginny never—it didn’t matter.
“Is that why your hair sometimes has glitter in it?” Malfoy asked, glancing at Harry’s hair. “I assumed it had something to do with your daycare work, but…”
“I don’t like either scenario,” Harry admitted. “I think…I wanted her to be telling the truth.”
“What?” Ginny’s head jerked up. “Is today really the day you’re going to break up with me?”
“Of course.” Harry copied Malfoy’s meticulous notes with a routine flick of his wand. “I’m really getting curious, you know. What are you researching these for?”
wanted, but Draco seemed like he…needed it. Not like the other day, in the bath. “Are you…ready?” he asked. “You said you weren’t, but—”
you know and put them in that pub—Big Gay Pub Night, all right—” he cut himself off, wide-eyed and wild.
“Yeah,” Harry said, without hesitation, and meant it. He couldn’t possibly give it to Ginny after all. But Malfoy…there was a look in his eyes, and Harry didn’t know what it meant, but he knew it was important. “Pick one.”
“It doesn’t sound stupid.” Draco turned a bit in Harry’s arms, so he could look at him. He was all serious, line between his eyebrows and all, but his mouth was soft. “I’d love to. Does it have to be right now?”
Draco didn’t wait.
“Creepy,” Draco repeated, then shrugged. “I eventually got tired of being a dysfunctional mess and got myself into treatment, to therapy, and medication, which was a struggle and a half, and when I’d been doing that for a while and improving and just generally…turning into a human being again, I went back to the property I was working on. I finished it up. A few hours here, a half day there, five minutes sweeping, that sort of thing. What I could manage at any given time. And therapy. Then as I got better, I started doing other things. That was when I came to the Archive, you know. For a while there all I did was the repairs, my research, and therapy.”
“I can’t explain it. I just can’t do any of that yet. I need more time. I’m sorry.”
“Er, hello,” Harry said, oddly relieved and disappointed at once not to get Dudley on the phone. “Is Dudley there?”
He had
There were several pamphlets about addiction, a few about stress, one about depression (Harry took one of those), a few about divorce, some about PTSD (Harry took one of those too), several about various mental illnesses, some about sexuality… Harry pocketed a pamphlet about anxiety as well, and then he saw one that gave him pause. ASEXUALITY, it said, in large letters, underneath which was a cloud of quotes, such as
If she was surprised, she didn’t show it. “Of course.” She folded it open carefully and turned it so that it was facing him. “Do you see yourself in this?”
“Not a team,” Harry corrected. “Who told you I’m great?”
“Quidditch analysis articles,” Ginny said, shrugging. The tension around her eyes leached away. “I don’t have time for much else.”
. “Everyone else has one too, but theirs just have the team name on.”
“We might not win,” Harry said, just for good measure.
“No, no more naked kissing in an extremely romantic setting until we are definitely no longer talking about my mother.” Draco withdrew his hand, crossing his arms. “Which is it?”
“I…” Malfoy worried his lip. “Can we eat outside?”
“It’s not so bad, is it? Nobody’s given me any grief about it. Though I suppose I’ll be fielding questions from journalists tomorrow after the game...What about your parents?”
don’t, Harry’s brain helpfully reminded him. You’re the one having a minor meltdown in a bath & body shop over possibly having sex with Draco.
Harry was aware he was staring, so he pulled himself together. Before he could respond to Malfoy’s inquiry, however, Malfoy’s face shuttered.
“That was remarkably simple,” Draco said, relieved. “I needn’t have worried at all.” He was clutching his little black notebook. It was a little worn around the edges by now, and some pages were dog-eared.
He stood there for so long that an employee had to politely tell him that they were closing soon, Mr Potter, and would he like to make a purchase, or…?
Nobody had the Snitch, but Butterfly Bumpkins were ten points ahead when the clock stopped.
want to be when you were five?”
“I have a date,” Harry said. “I’m.” He frowned.
Come Friday morning, Harry was waiting for Malfoy to turn up. He’d been late the previous week, so Harry didn’t expect him early, but Malfoy was there within a minute of Harry turning the key in the front door to unlock it.
“We’re moving in together,” Padma said.
“All right,” she said. “Let's talk about something else, then. Quidditch?”
“Do you need a moment? This is a lot to take in.”
“Thanks? I guess?”
,” Gladys said. “But consent is a spectrum, and agreeing to an activity for other reasons than genuinely wanting to engage in the activity isn’t entirely consensual—what do you think about that?”
“If you had to say that the War taught you one thing, what would it be?”
. Harry was struggling to remember the last time he’d had a civil conversation with Malfoy…that was to say, before he started coming to the Archive. Was it at the trials? Harry recalled sharing a few words with an exhausted Draco Malfoy in the halls at the ministry—Harry had been utterly wrung out at the time as well, testifying for and against so many people, standing trial himself, testifying, testifying, watching friends and enemies and everyone in between go from court room to holding cells to court rooms to freedom, or to jail.
“I want the biggest piece,” Avery said, only to immediately be set upon by the two others.
But he was locking up the front doors of the Archive now and Malfoy was waiting.
“Yes! You’re getting it. Of course there’s approximately four times as many house-elves living in the castle than are captured and in service, I’d say maybe even seven times as many.”
What was he going to say once he was face to face with his therapist? His
“Mm.” Ginny gave him one of her rare, dazzling smiles. “Soooo…how does it feel? Knowing you’re about to become a bona fide Quidditch coach?”
“It’s not a big deal,” Harry said, shrinking a little under their gaze.
“Lovely to meet you, Harry.” She gave him a warm smile, and then went over some practicalities, which Harry barely paid attention to, something about client confidentiality and how he was here on his terms, or something like that. “What do you want to talk about?”
Interestingly, all the research I could find on PCD, consent, performance, etc. never brought up asexuality - and in fact, rarely brought up the sexuality of the participants in the studies other than to note that they had all been heterosexual - which obviously leads me to think: what if there’s some overlap between asexual people (who might not know they’re asexual in the first place) and people with PCD or similar complex issues relating to sex? After all, it is the experience of many asexual people that there’s a pressure to engage in sexual acts, to perform, to behave a certain way.
“So you repaired them.”
Instantly, the bath bomb started fizzing, a trail of pink, blue and yellow behind it as it went. At first there wasn’t much of a scent, but then suddenly it was there, rich vanilla rising out of the water to fill the room.
The slimmer types of novels, but still.
“That’s absurd.” Malfoy’s cheeks were suspiciously pink.
“I’m fine.” Malfoy offered him a small smile. “But thank you for asking.”
Draco had said he was done researching, but Harry hadn’t quite believed it—or had hoped it wasn’t true, or that it wouldn’t happen so soon. The Archive had other patrons of the authorly type, and they’d been coming here for
“That’s the best time to eat outside,” Malfoy said. “Outside is textured differently when it rains. It smells different than when it’s dry out, or the sun is shining. I find it greatly enhances the eating experience.”
Ron picked up the Prophet, which was open to a specific page, and showed him. There were two headlines on that page, one to do with Butterfly Bumpkins’ first win, with a quote by Harry highlighted directly underneath it. There was a photo of Harry and Ginny jumping and punching the air as Alice caught the Snitch. The other headline came with a photo of Harry and Draco on the Quidditch pitch. It was taken from a distance, but it was clear they were smiling at each other and kissing, the loop unmistakeable.
Ginny’s face crumpled. She turned away, holding herself stiffly—too stiffly, and Harry wanted nothing more than to turn seven seconds back in time and stop himself from ever saying those words.
“Yeah, an undergraduate degree. I continued with the Master’s and have almost finished it—I’m missing one course and my dissertation—I, well, my mental health imploded, so…” Malfoy shrugged. “I took a break. I think I’m getting ready to go back and finish it. The course I’m missing isn’t offered until summer term, and the dissertation isn’t due until September if I go back now, but I want to…you know. Ease into it.”
“Ah…” Malfoy avoided Harry’s eyes, taking great care to pull his gloves off. “Another time? I can’t really…”
Malfoy was worrying at his lip, his cheeks pink. “I know it’s weird,” he said. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t judge me.”
“Thanks.” Harry looked back over the pitch. Oliver was refereeing today, and he was making his way to the middle of the pitch with the chest of balls. “All right. Time to get cracking.”
“You had a crush on Cedric.”
“Mmmmmaybe.” Ginny slipped her hand into his. “We’ll get you up and running in no time.”
Malfoy stood there, uncertain, looking like he wanted to say something, or maybe like he didn’t want to want to say something but wanted to say it anyway—which was a sentence Harry thought would sound crazy if he said it out loud—and didn’t say anything at all. Then he turned and walked out and was gone within seconds.
followed by
“Yeah,” Harry replied. This was more in line with what he’d wanted when Draco had suggested a bath. It wasn’t comfortable exactly, Harry was still too unsure of what Draco wanted to truly relax, but he was warm now, and he had tea and scones and Draco so close he could smell his hair and feel the heat of his body.
“Hmm.” Draco inspected all the bath bombs, pausing briefly on the sunshine bomb and later the black bomb, studying the label and sniffing it. Harry watched him, keeping half an eye on the bath so it wouldn’t run over, checking the temperature as it went. Draco moved on, considering the green Quidditch-like bomb for a moment, and a pink one he’d described as full of aphrodisiacs. “This one?” Draco eventually asked, holding up a galaxy bomb. “Or maybe this one, it has vanilla in it.” The other was a multicoloured bomb in a geometric shape.
“They really do,” said someone from behind—Blaise, accompanied by Gilliam, Pansy and Padma. Pansy was holding her hand in such a way that nobody with functioning eyes in their head could avoid noticing the very shiny golden ring on her finger.
“No, everyone gets an equal piece,” Harry cut through, picking up the scissors. “There’s enough of this that everyone still gets a big piece, all right?”
Harry could’ve been drowning, but it didn’t matter. He would drown again, and again, and again, if it meant he could have Draco like this: a soft kiss at the edge of a Quidditch pitch, bathed in victory and happiness.
Wide-eyed, they shook their heads.
The girls were staring at him. Pansy regained her composure.
Feet shuffled. Eventually Avery spoke. “I’ll go first,” he said, stealing glances at Charlie and Alice. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes.” Harry let Ginny go. His feelings about her didn’t have anything to do with his feelings for Malfoy, but he could understand her need for distance.
“That's right,” Albert added, and went back to responding to owl queries.
“Oh yes, once I’d ditched Draco.”
Malfoy hesitated. “Maybe.”
The painting of the meadow showed a sun low in the sky and a bunny peeking out of the grass. A tree in the distance swayed gently in the wind.
“What?”
“You should check these out,” Harry said, wanting to move on. He showed Malfoy little oval green bombs with a leaf pattern. “These make me think of Quidditch. They smell like the outside. Well, like mud and wood.” He gestured at his cloak, which still sported mud-splatter from Quidditch Daycare that morning.
to begin with (that is to say, the freedom to say no). An interesting article (Danish) from the 60s suggested that in men orgasms and ejaculation aren’t the one and the same, and that men can ejaculate without an orgasm at all. Another recent article (Danish) suggested this was linked with both a high pressure to perform and the societal expectation there is of men to always want sex, and thus always be ready to have it.
“I had it first, but Avery took it from me!” Hugh said.
He had meetings with Faulkner and Pomeroy, he put a notice in the Prophet for team try-outs (and then took it out already the following day when he’d received more sign ups than he could handle), he finally secured a sponsor for brooms and another for uniforms, he held try-outs, he formally signed the team up for the League, he chose a charity (well, three charities) to support, found a venue to train the team at, he did…everything. And he did it without Ginny’s help, even if she was supposed to help him. She was supposed to be there, and she wasn’t.
It wasn’t until Harry was standing at the bar getting them all a round of drinks, listening to the bartender flirting with two girls a bit further down as he pulled the draughts, that he realised that all of them at the table tonight were queer. They didn’t have to do the entire inane
Somebody had—again—left a not inconsiderable amount of documents spread across two desks, instead of returning them to either the service desk or the return trolley. Harry inspected the documents carefully and compared them with his ex libris list; none were missing. One document flagged, however, and Harry found a dark stain on the lower right corner.
“And now?” Harry reached out to touch him, his fingers brushing over Draco’s shoulders.
“Yeah, yeah let’s do that. Reconvene. Later.” Harry had had enough embarrassment for the day. “I’ll, uh, think of something?”
“It was odd. I don’t think the writer knows much about Muggles.”
“Merlin’s flaming beard, Harry, that’s—okay, okay.
“So you’ll come? Or what does ‘okay’ mean?”
“Morning,” Harry said, startled but pleased.
“In a bit.” Draco kissed him. “I need to—” He kissed Harry again. “I want to take you home, put you in my bed, and kiss every inch of you. I want to suck you off. Will you let me?”
Harry whistled. “That’s impressive.” His head was starting to hurt, what with the noise levels rising; people were pouring into the stadium. All the same, Lee’s suggestion dropped into his head unbidden, and for the moment, unwelcome. “Do you think he’d like to play on a real team?” He asked Ms Baxter.
The rest of his tiny daycare were already practicing the task he’d set them: throwing Quaffles between them, while also moving in a circle. He’d get them zooming around soon enough, for now balancing on a broom, controlling the broom, and also keeping an eye on a Quaffle (not to mention catching the thing and sending it off again) was proving a challenge for them. They were only four and five years old; they were still developing their coordination skills.
to. And now it was all done and I was supposed to fight crime?
“I just said that.” Malfoy’s cheeks were red, and he was walking a little faster.
The way Malfoy said it gave Harry chills. Not the sort of chills one got from eating ice cream, or the kind one got in a draft room, or the special sort of chill one experienced in fucked up life-threatening situations. There was something in Malfoy’s voice that roused a deep fear in him, not for his own safety, but for Malfoy’s.
A quarter of an hour before closing, Malfoy came to the front desk. He was pushing the trolley ahead of him. Harry eyed the trolley, then Malfoy, who was fidgeting.
There was also the option of not telling her anything at all, but how then would Harry account for being home late? Nothing wasn’t an adequate explanation and lying was not an option at all.
Harry wasn’t sure what he meant, but he nodded anyway, still munching on the scone. It was better than talking. Draco shifted, their legs knocking together, and then manoeuvred himself across carefully, until he managed to slot himself between Harry’s legs, his back against Harry’s chest. Harry automatically put his free arm around Draco’s waist.
“Oh,” said Harry. Something in his belly roared up and whispered, tickling his diaphragm. Excitement, and curiosity, and something deeply pleased that Malfoy had thought of him.
your way. As I’m sure you’re aware, that hasn’t changed.”
“I thought—” Ginny shook her head, letting out a chuckle. “I don’t know what I thought.”
“All right. I’ll bring those up for you. The reading hall is down that way; grab a vacant desk and make yourself comfortable, and I’ll come to you. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.”
Blaise leaned over. “Juniper is Millie’s ex,” he stage-whispered.
I don’t get a carefully written wish fulfilment fantasy of a happy ending. I don’t get to be in this fucking world. It doesn’t matter what I want, I’m not going to get it, and I sure as hell don’t deserve it.”
“Hmmm.” Ginny didn’t bother getting dressed, just sat at the table in her towel, her damp hair cascading down her shoulders. “What happened?”
“We uninvited the straight people tonight,” Pansy told him, gently. “It’s just us.”
The rain continued pouring. It was cold, but dry, under Malfoy’s umbrella. Harry didn’t really know what he was doing, here, with Malfoy. He was falling in love with a person who had just reminded him, bluntly at that, that he’d been on the other side in the War, a person whose family was tied up with centuries’ worth of human and magical supremacy politics and blood politics, somebody who’d been directly responsible for a lot of harm.
“Give this to Albert or Janie when you come in tomorrow,” Harry said. “They’ll sort you out.”
Ginny didn’t come home the following day and wasn’t responding to owls (Hilde returned increasingly antsy and aggressive every time Harry sent her out with another letter), so Harry took the opportunity to unpack the rest of the boxes and search for his books. They were meant to have a housewarming party, but boxes were still stacked in the living room (what was even in those boxes, Harry wondered, he couldn’t recall seriously missing any items), and they just hadn’t got around to it.
“Everyone, meet Gilliam,” Blaise said, ignoring Pansy. “We are disgustingly in love.”
“Yeah,” Avery agreed, not as mulish about it as Harry had expected him to.
Harry's nerves were fraying at the edges, in the middle, and everywhere in between. Three months of practice and games and more practice had led to five victories out of six games: they'd made it to the semi-finals.
“You don’t look okay,” Draco said. A thin line had formed between his eyebrows. “I can wait, you know. If you don’t want to, it’s okay.”
“Your boyfriend looks fit,” Peony said. She’d turned to look at Draco as well.
dead a lot.”
“Why not? It’s the kind of happy ending I wanted.”
“I didn’t know.”
Charlie didn’t say anything to that.
It was just the two of them now, had been just the two of them for four short weeks, and all the ways in which they didn’t quite fit had become glaringly obvious. Harry had stubbornly ignored it.
“Hmm. I don't recall…”
“Yes.” Malfoy was still holding on to his gloves.
Harry took a moment to himself to process the fact that Malfoy had just asked to see three thousand coroner reports. It would take him days to look through them all, if not weeks.
“They’re white.” Draco smiled. “Really boring.”
“It’s not going to be an overnight fix,” Gladys told him. “I want you to be aware of that.”
“How’d you know I was worrying?” Harry asked. Draco was proudly wearing his
“I promise!”
Not ready? That made no sense—could people really be
They nearly collided with Ginny in the doorway. “Oh!” she said. “Sorry—Harry, you dropped this.” She gave him the team notebook, the one that held all his notes about his players, game plays, and everything. “Uh.”
Ten minutes before closing time, Malfoy returned the trolley, and the tendril in Harry’s belly nearly knocked the breath out of him.
, right?
“I’m sorry, too,” Hugh said.
Harry startled. “That’s not why we broke up.” Had their issues really been that transparent? Did everyone know that…well, that they hadn’t been working out? “You can’t have known I’m…or Ginny…you know.”
Malfoy focused his gaze on Harry. He looked neither surprised nor upset, or even overwhelmed. In fact, he’d barely shown any kind of emotion on his face since Harry had first seen him that day. “I’m sure.”
Fridays he had an all-day shift. He could probably use the distraction, but right now… “Yes, I think so. Yes. I’ll take tomorrow, too.” He rubbed his face, trying not to cry. The thought of having to go through another day without Draco was making it hard to breathe.
Draco was nodding, but the wild look in his eyes was still there. “So…” he closed his eyes, rubbing his face. “Let me get this straight. George, Lee, and Angelina. They’re…in a three-way relationship? And have kids?”
The kids were doing drills with a Golden Snitch and a bunch of distracting glittery or shiny objects. It was a drill he’d done with his Little League Seekers, who’d loved it, but it was a good task for the daycare, too—it was just difficult enough to keep them all focused, but not dangerous enough that Harry couldn’t afford to let his mind wander.
! Have fun! Not think about the fucking War or my dead brother or the fact everyone was in prison or doing community service—I just wanted to play Quidditch and have fun and not get serious, and you—you didn’t.”
The café did indeed have lemon meringue tarts. Harry got them each a slice and a pot of tea, and Malfoy conjured an invisible umbrella large enough for both of them.
“Am I oversharing?”
Harry sorted out the mail—there was an inquiry in there about the introduction of oranges to Britain, which Harry looked up and found to be the early 17th century, date unknown—and helped the few other patrons who came in.
“I don’t know, but I’m bloody well going to find out! I want to be!” Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. “Don’t you want to be my happy ending too?”
Malfoy stopped short, cheeks red. “They’re not all murders,” he said, softly. “Most are natural deaths and accidents.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. I just.” Harry tried for a nonchalant shrug and absolutely, completely, utterly failed at passing it off. His left shoulder probably looked like it’d had a sudden spasm. “You don’t have to say yes.”
“Oh.” Malfoy’s entire face was pink now.
Letting out a small sigh of relief now that the hard part was over, Harry stood up. “Betty, go wash your hands. Let’s get you a drink of water, Hugh, and then we’ll go outside and join the others, all right?”
“Oh—I won’t be,” Harry said.
“What am I then? The hero’s love interest?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised. If he thought the change in topic was odd, he didn’t let on.
Harry doubted he could actually see it from this distance, but he wasn’t about to point that out. “Good. Be ready.” Harry whistled loudly, and Alice swooped down to swap.
an eccentric, kind of,” Harry said.
Not for the first time Harry wondered if he should get rid of the bed, or maybe transfigure it into a new one, since he’d shared this one with Ginny for years. He’d slept on her side tonight, and while it hadn’t really bothered him before to think of the bed like his and Ginny’s, having Draco in it now was…incongruous with that line of thought.
“Yeah.” Harry sighed, running a hand through his damp and wild hair. “I have one month’s notice, don’t I? This is it. I’ll owl you my formal resignation later if you need it.”
Emma’s mum split, and shortly after Harry had filled her in on the exercise. She played Chaser for the Tutshill Tornadoes, if Harry wasn’t mistaken, and would actually be playing the Harpies in two weeks’ time. They demonstrated the exercise, and Harry thankfully did not embarrass himself by dropping the Quaffle.
Harry rubbed his eyes. When he’d gone into this year with the hope of a new beginning, he hadn’t envisioned…all
“The detective is gay,” Malfoy said, his voice low and vibrating. “I was just hoping that in the sequel he and the magician…” he gestured. When he looked at the book there was a special kind of hunger in his eyes. “You know.”
Harry took another sip of water. Then he started talking.
Five victories out of six games: they’d won against Dragonriders in the first week, lost against Fishes in the second, then won over Candy Cranes in the third, DragonTAMERS in the fourth, Hawkins’ Hawks fifth, and then Just Us sixth. It was a good track record—good enough to get them to the semi-finals.
There was a strange look in Malfoy’s eyes, and his face was oddly stiff. Harry abruptly realised he was trying to hold back laughter.
“No problem?” Ginny touched Harry’s arm. “Are you okay?”
“I told you there’d be
“I’m Harry, and I’m your coach and captain and…we are going to win a chocolate trophy, isn’t that right?”
“Thank you,” Harry said. He had only one big pocket, and it was currently holding a large paper bag full of bath bombs. He put the book down there with them. “I…appreciate it?”
“You can have as many kisses as you fancy,” Draco said, putting a finger on Harry’s lips to stop him when he leaned in, “if you win this game.”
“Okay.” Malfoy steeled himself. “Let’s go then. Which way?”
. How long had he been isolating himself if he hadn’t seen that all around him there were people just like him?
(As for which treatments Harry sorted out with his therapist...I’ll leave that up to reader interpretation.)
“I noticed,” Harry said. Draco had pressed Harry’s hand to his cheek, and that simple act was enough to make Harry’s heart expand to bursting. “Can I ask you about something spontaneous?”
Because that’s what it was. Abuse. The fact that he’d been used to it, that he’d borne it, that he’d just lived through it as if it were any other day—which it had been—didn’t make any of it less awful. It didn’t make him less angry, apparently.
to fight in the first place, I just
Harry shot Oliver a grateful look. “As I was saying earlier, I have experience with handling children of that age. Ginny is very busy with her own career at the moment and hasn’t been able to attend practice yet.”
The game was over.
They sat. “Which charity are you supporting?” Hermione asked, handing him a menu.
Not for the first time, Harry wondered if he should try therapy—even if he and Malfoy weren’t the same, maybe it could fix him, make that emptiness feel better. “That’s great,” he heard himself say, “I might try it.”
He’d have to go over the whole ‘land first, then cheer’ thing again, but not now, later. Next practice. “You got it!” Harry helped her up. “We won! We won our first game!”
“So this is a love story, then? A romance?”
“Hey,” he said, sliding his arms around Draco from behind and resting his chin on his shoulder. He took the opportunity to kiss Draco’s neck. “I love you.”
“Over there,” Harry said, pointing at the shelf. It held several brown paper bags, some open, some not. He started the washing machine, and then the bath.
“Right,” Malfoy said.
“It’s for a project.” Malfoy accepted the form, peering down at it. “When will you, ah, be in again?”
“Are you staying until closing hours?” Harry asked, dubious. He had noticed that Malfoy never visited the café in the West wing, but he’d assumed…what? That Malfoy was a vampire?
He still didn’t know where Draco lived, which was…odd. He knew he didn’t live in the Manor, which had been closed up for years.
“Brilliant. See you on Monday, Harry. Have a good weekend.” She vanished down the corridor.
“The usual.” Malfoy gestured at the trolley. “I also wanted to ask…” He hesitated.
Harry said some hasty goodbyes and left, walking back towards the gravel path in front of the Manor. He could feel Narcissa’s eyes on the back of his head, but that didn't matter as much as the fact that Draco had gone to see him. Hope sprouted in his chest and put a spring in his steps, urging him onwards.
“No returning them every day and getting new request slips made?”
Albert was manning the front desk.
Harry shrugged. “Better than expected.”
“My apologies for wasting your time,” Malfoy said, turning to go.
Even if…even if Malfoy was responsible for making Harry feel all sorts of silly things, he didn’t want to put him into the
The cashier tried to hide a smile. “Your costumes are excellent,” she commented. “Where’s the party at?”
didn’t seem like a very well thought out reason.
Crisis averted, Harry cut the blue silk paper into three pieces of the same size and handed them out. Satisfied that they wouldn’t start fighting again, he went to see how Charlie and Betty were doing and wound up helping Betty write greetings in all seven of her cards; one for each of her siblings, one for her parents, and one for her grandmother.
“Have you ever set fire to something?” This was Alice asking.
“That’s why I brought Ron along,” Hermione said, her smile brightening up the room. Ron was looking at her like she’d hung the moon. “We thought we’d wait until some more time had passed, but…”
“Oh,” Alice mouthed, realising everyone was staring at her. She raised her arm, holding the Snitch aloft for everyone to see. “I got it?”
“You want to make friends with me?” There was no stopping the smile on Harry’s face, or the delight filling every fibre of his being.
“I’m going to therapy,” Harry said. “for, er, stuff.”
Lee ended up taking orders of refills for everyone (a pot of tea for Harry and Draco to share) and returned swiftly with an entire bottle of wine for Angelina, sparkly fairy brews for him and George, and several pints of Flaming Flurries. Draco had tensed up again and was keeping quiet.
are going to the tailor,” Draco amended. “If I’m to wear a pointy hat, then you are, too.”
“Not at all.” Harry looked at the cover of the science fiction novel again. “Thank you.” He opened the cover to look inside and found a neat little piece of ornate parchment stuck to the reverse. The decorative band along the edge looked drawn by hand, depicting rows of planets and space ships and little people in space suits tethered to them. In the centre it had two lines,
The Butterfly Bumpkins were playing the Candy Cranes that day, but Harry could meet before or after. After was probably best.
She leaned in to whisper. “We could go home first. I’m in the mood for some insanely celebratory shagging.”
He’d thought a lot about the war, then. About his choices. Both those that led to his sentence and those that hadn’t, all the different ways the war could’ve turned out if he’d only been faster, braver, more cautious, more bold…there’d been a counsellor there, but Harry hadn’t wanted to talk to her at the time. He’d made his peace—he’d taken both his punishment and his accolades, and gone to Pansy’s parties, and put it all behind him.
The game seemed to happen in a haze—Lee was commentating, but Harry didn’t register a single word he said. He rotated his players out (Love was very happy to be let back onto a broom) and gave them praise and watched Emma do a perfect Finbourgh Flick, and then Anthony performed a Wronski Feint (and nearly gave Harry a heart attack; that was one of the more dangerous moves—even if only from a height of seven feet—that he and Ginny had decided
“How do you know?” Harry narrowed his eyes at her. “Has he said anything?”
“Therapy? Like…Muggle mind stuff?”
for it, it’s a
“I was going to say soft.” Harry looked at him. “You didn’t like it?”
“I don’t have a girlfriend,” Harry said. The words came just as easily as they’d done the day before. “People don’t give their exes Valentines, do they?”
Charlie considered this. “She is very good,” he allowed. “But she’s not a Keeper.”
“I wanted to,” Malfoy said. He’d put the pile of books away in his cloak, a well-tailored and classy dark grey piece that clearly had pockets that were bigger on the inside and fitted with a weightless charm.
Scrolls and folders were stacked, some less neatly than others, all over the shelves and the desk, giving off the impression that this was the lair of an eccentric scholar rather than an orderly and finicky person.
“I do work here,” Harry said, trying his best winning smile on Malfoy. “Come on, have lunch with me. I’m not on the clock for the next hour.”
Harry was looking at Malfoy instead of the books. “Have you ever been to a Muggle bookstore? Since you have all those Muggle books…”
“I’m good,” Harry said as he rejoined Malfoy in the foyer. He noticed now that Malfoy wasn’t wearing his own cloak and hadn’t actually been wearing it, which meant that he’d…what, been at the archive for a while already? Lying in wait for Harry? In the middle of the foyer? How early had Malfoy come in today? “Were you waiting for me?”
“What are these robots a metaphor for?”
Draco brought Harry’s fingers to his mouth, pressing kisses to his knuckles, his fingertips, his palm. Harry let him, fascinated. “Monday morning I start by having breakfast with my mum, showering, then writing. She usually cooks lunch and we eat together. Then we go for a walk and I go to my workshop.” He went through the entire week. Therapy on Tuesday mornings, which was why Harry never saw him on Tuesdays: it was so exhausting he couldn’t handle any socialising afterwards. Workshop on Wednesday mornings, set days and times for lunch with his mother, with Harry, supper, reading, and so on. “I’ve gotten better at deviating from my routine and being more spontaneous.”
Draco did the ‘or maybe’ face. “I would have to wonder what that says about me, only I already know it. I think—suspect—that there isn’t any definite proof in the book. I think it’s up to the reader to decide. Do you give her the benefit of the doubt, or do you assume the worst?”
to be me.”
When Harry returned home, hours later, belly full of tea and sticky buns and heart full of wonderful conversation, he was exhausted. Homework would have to wait. He ran a hot bath and dropped in the pink and purple sleep bomb. No homework, no science fiction, just this sea of calm and comfort.
Alice glanced at Hugh, who had the decency to look shamefaced, and held out her hand. Her broom zipped up without her even saying a single word.
Draco went back to the kitchen and Harry made his way to the bathroom, where he promptly shed all of his soaked clothing and stuffed it all into the washing machine, along with the contents of the laundry basket. He’d just slipped on a bathrobe when Malfoy came in.
“You do know that’s not strictly necessary, right? You can read anywhere you like. Prop a book up against the coffee pot over breakfast, or in the bath, or you don’t have to read at all, you can just listen to the book instead.” They’d reached Flourish and Blotts, and Malfoy held the door open for Harry. “After you.”
When he’d finished the roll and made his way through half of another one, he spoke again. “What kind of books do you like to read?”
“Brilliant, isn’t it?” Malfoy was grinning, all giddy and happy and pleased with himself.
“Manual will do it,” Harry replied, inexplicably charmed. “Sorting by hand,” he clarified at Malfoy’s uncomprehending look. “Just leave everything where it is, and it’ll still be where you left it when you come back. You can get creative with it all later. Build piles and stacks and that kind of thing. Small forts.”
“Yeah?” Harry’s voice came out all wrong, so he tried to clear his throat. It was still seized up.
Etiquette prescribed that Apparating in and out of people’s homes, including their grounds, wasn't done, but Harry didn't wait; halfway to the Manor, he Disapparated to his favourite arriving spot in Direction Alley.
“Well, we have coroner reports going back to the 12th century, though they weren’t called that, then, and,” Harry paused, examining the ledger, “they are tagged by natural causes, accidents, homicide, and unexplained. They are also sorted by region, so say you wanted to look at homicides in Leeds in the 17th century, I could fetch those for you.”
“Yes?” Malfoy prompted. A crease formed between his eyebrows. “Did you not like them?”
“Guys,” Harry said, when he returned to the table with their drinks. “I’ve a date on Wednesday. I’ve been trying to get him to come to pub night for a while, but he’s…I don’t think he’s ready. When I get him to come, could you help me make sure he’s comfortable?”
“The slave part is correct, to a degree,” Malfoy said. “House-elves belong to the house, not to the family, though that got skewed over time as families became synonymous with the house, as in the physical location of their home, and became Houses, capital H,” he explained. “Like the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. When a house—as in the physical place—loses its house-elves, the house is considered dead. Magic folks can still live there, of course, and many live in homes that don’t have house-elves, never had house-elves to begin with, and aren’t any the worse off for it. But a house that once was inhabited by elves, and no longer is? That’s bad luck. Those houses are ‘dead’, so to speak.”
Ginny stood up and came over to kiss him, her hair falling over his face like a curtain. “Want to show me just how much you love me?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, standing up. He turned to Peony, who had stood too.
That had Draco swivel round to look at him. “I saw the pamphlet,” he said. “On your fridge. I read it. I didn’t mean to pry, I was just curious…”
“I know.” Draco huffed. “Go run that bath. I only need to put the scones in the oven. They won’t take long.”
“He didn’t get a happy ending regardless,” Harry pointed out. “Because for him it wasn’t about a happy ending; it was about a bad ending for everyone he hated and seeing those people suffer, and building an entire world on...suffering and hate. There’s no happiness in that.”
“What about those dead properties, then?” Harry eventually said. “You were saying.”
“Don’t overthink the date,” she then said. “Malfoy’s already agreed to it, so…you both want the same thing. It’ll be fine.”
Afterwards, the kids and their parents were quick to pack up and go, nobody wanting to linger. Harry gave Draco his spare key and told him meet him at the flat, and then went to join the other captain in talking to reporters. By the time that all was over with and Harry had taken all the equipment back to the Chudley Cannons’ home stadium (he’d let Ginny leave early, on account that she’d handled the gear last time) and had made it home, he was in a terrible mood. The kind of mood that wasn’t grumpy or angry so much as tired and depressed and disappointed and upset all at once.
She went over those options as well, and it turned out that audiobooks were frequently triple the price of regular books, so also not a financially viable option for the time being. Harry made a note of it, however, for Draco’s birthday. (If Draco was still in Harry’s life by then, that was.)
And then maybe make another appointment with Gladys because even if—even if he was asexual, it didn’t seem right to be thinking like this. Maybe she could help.
Lastly, I want to emphasise that:
“Did you think I didn’t?” Draco’s hands were still cradling Harry’s face. His fingers were rough.
Harry slammed the door so hard it rattled in the frame. The flat was empty, the living room was empty, the kitchen was empty, and Ginny’s note sat on the table.
The meadow in the painting was flattened by wind and dark clouds filled the sky. The bunnies that lived in the painting didn’t show themselves.
A blizzard, not entirely unexpected, forced Harry to cancel the second Little League training and reschedule for Saturday. He was also forced to keep the Quidditch Daycare indoors, so he pulled out the box of art supplies and let the kids have at it; Valentine’s Day was coming up soon, and he’d thought letting them make cards would be a nice activity. As it turned out, they all wanted to make Valentines for their family members.
He was questioning every single life decision he’d made that’d put him on this path.
Ginny eyed him sideways. “You all right, Harry?”
“We can cut it in three parts?” Alice asked.
“You’ve made headway with these,” Harry commented as he prepared the new request form. He’d deducted a considerable number of reports from the pile.
“Hi, Mr Harry!”
Maybe Malfoy liked to read about…love stories? Love stories would probably be nice to read about so long as they didn’t have any dragons in them. The ringing surfaced again inside Harry’s skull, and he stopped in his tracks. He was just outside the shop.
? Harry was stunned silent. “To talk?”
It’d be empty around here with just Hugh and Betty around. One more year and then they’d be off to school full-time, too.
Harry’s pockets weren’t as well-charmed, or as roomy, but he had space in his book bag for the third bag. “Okay, uhm. This way.”
experience?” Harry had never thought of it that way if he was entirely honest with himself. It wasn’t an entirely repulsive idea, looking at it from this chair, but in practice? He wasn’t sure. “How do I make that happen?”
“Thank you.” Harry looked at the page quickly—the address was in a different Wizarding district in London—and then found a pocket to keep it in. “We’re, ah, here.”
—he didn't have to.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I always thought—hoped—I’d have at least one. Come in, it’s structurally sound. I made sure of it.”
Harry couldn’t help the fond grin spreading on his face. “Of course.”
Draco nodded, but he didn’t release the cup and his shoulders remained stiff. On the one hand Harry wanted to give Draco the opportunity to leave, but on the other the evening had barely started, and he’d taken Draco here for a reason.
“Living,” Malfoy answered, following Harry out onto the Muggle street. “I’ve never been through this way. Where are we?” He looked around and up and down, as if the answer was to be found in the sky or on the curb.
“Looking for you.” Harry searched Draco’s face for signs of…well, anything. But Draco just looked like himself, if a bit frowny.
“I—yes. I’d like that very much.” Draco afforded him a soft smile. “I, ah, have my ticket already.”
“Yeah, and you’re bloody weird, mate.” Ron punctuated this statement by jabbing his (single) chopstick at Harry.
They went over every single bath bomb and bath melt in the store. Harry stocked up on his favourites and Malfoy carefully selected a small number of bombs to take home and try out. In addition to the rocket-shaped bomb, the rain bomb, and the Quidditch bomb, as Harry had dubbed it, he also had a galaxy bomb (peppermint, vetivert, and cedarwood) and a robot-shaped bomb (lavender and chamomile). The basket was bulging; Harry had never actually made such a large purchase before, preferring to come in more frequently to just get what he was in the mood for.
Dean was the first to speak. “Of course,” he said. And then, because he was Dean and sometimes had an uncanny ability to know what Harry was thinking, added: “we can tell the straight people pub night is cancelled that day if you give us a heads up.”
“Oh.” It didn’t sound at all similar to what Harry was feeling, and he had to tamp down the disappointment. “Because of therapy?”
“You didn’t have to,” Harry said, once they were back outside and he had his new book in hand.
“Utilising our services.” Harry shrugged.
By a stroke of luck, providence, or a series of random and unrelated events, Harry barely saw Draco until closing. He hadn’t even had time for a break, between helping a college student with research into flying carpet trade, assisting an elderly lady signing up for the Family Tree programme, handling a surprise delivery of South English Council’s documents going back fifty years (Harry counted himself lucky it hadn’t been five hundred years, and dumped the boxes in an empty workroom for someone else to sort out), and covering the front desk when Albert had to bow out sick, Harry just hadn’t had time to sneak away for a slice of tart and a cup of tea with Malfoy.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and gave him his bag. “This is yours. I, uh, have to go.”
“Well no, there was clearly work to do. I meant…”
It’d be theirs. And they had
“Malfoy lent them to me,” Harry said, putting the book on the table.
(from Ron, and Harry paused at it, wondering if he’d ever actually opened it) and the set of
… Abruptly Harry realised that Draco was out of touch with the world. Neither Pansy nor other friends of Daco’s from school had seen him in
Ginny came over to sit beside Harry. “We don’t have any books.” She touched the half-finished bookcase. “Why do we need it?”
“Imperialism,” Harry replied promptly. “Same reason why we’ve got Scottish and Welsh documents, and a number of other things that don’t strictly belong to us. There are other archives around, mostly small local ones, but we have a staggering amount of important documents here.”
“I see.” Harry glanced at her. She looked genuinely upset, and understandably so. He closed the jar of salve and cut out strips of band aids for Hugh. “I will talk to Avery about this. Is that all right?”
) and ushered him outside. “What was that? What’s larping?”
Charlie was on goal, and he blocked one of three shots, all performed by the same Chaser. Harry let Avery, Denise and Dorcas split the shots between them so they had two each, and each managed to make one goal. That set the score at 30-20 seven minutes into the game, all through penalties.
“I thought that was a rumour? Good for them.” Pansy frowned. “Well, there’s Cornelia, but we dated once, and I think Abby and Ursula broke up again. Anyway, Ursula and I hooked up once.”
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said, wondering what the hell was happening with his life.
Yeah, that much was probably true. Hadn’t Ginny said that when they’d broke up? Something about him not being what she needed. Well,
She looked like she’d been crying.
“I’m not making fun of you.” Harry wanted to touch him, but Malfoy was all closed off. “What was the other answer going to be? The sane-sounding one?”
“Oh, right, yes. Definitely.” Harry kissed him back.
It was a short list, and Harry thought it looked very simple and easy. As if everything could be boiled down to six points—as if it wasn’t more complicated than that—but the part of him that was terrified down to his core proved it
There was another jar in the cupboard from Narcissa, orange and rosemary, which was Draco’s favourite. Harry spread it on his second toast.
“Thank you,” he told Lisa. “I, uh, that’s a bit out of my price range at the moment, but he’s got a birthday coming up in June…” he trailed off, apologetically. He’d done the conversion to Galleons in his head, and the e-reader alone was more than he’d want to shell out without careful budgeting. But Draco had mentioned audiobooks once—maybe Lisa would know about those. “What about audiobooks?”
“I remember,” said Draco, shaking their hands in turn. “The artist?” He asked Dean.
Ginny was still flushed when she came out, and Harry greeted her with a deep kiss. “You were amazing,” he said.
What was worse than the fact Ginny was breaking up with him, was the fact Harry was irrationally jealous that she could choose to just go home for a break. Harry was stuck in their shared apartment, in the interrupted next stage of their life together, with no parent to talk to.
Either way, he should probably make sure that whatever he did next, he would be able to pay his bills.
Harry dropped his face into his hands, trying to will his emotions to calm, to keep his breathing even, to not feel like he wanted to walk out the door and never come back. From the bedroom came the sounds of drawers and wardrobe doors opening and closing, clinks of bottles from the bathroom: the sounds of Ginny packing herself up and out and away from his life.
“I don’t do that sort of thing,” Harry said automatically. “I just fetch things and put them in order.” He eyed the form. Malfoy had requested him specifically?
Ginny came back Sunday morning, and the moment Harry laid eyes on her he knew it was over.
“Harry?” Dean was bumping his shoulder with his fist. “You asleep on us?”
“It’s for charity, right?” Malfoy looked uncertain. “I want to support the charity.”
. “I—” What exactly could he say? How much was he willing to tell her? “I’m—afraid—” his breath caught in his throat. “—I’ve fucked it all up for good.”
“I’ll see you on Monday?”
“Comforting, Harry.” Ron stabbed a dumpling with a chopstick and popped it into his mouth. “So, tell me about Malfoy.”
What did Harry want? They’d been here, what, half an hour? Less? More? And Harry felt more confused and more angry and more upset about everything than he had before he’d walked in. It all felt like a mistake—like he could’ve gone through life never speaking to his cousin again and been perfectly fine.
And then—like magic—Harry saw Love send a Bludger directly at the other team’s Seeker, who narrowly avoided it, and as she swerved, he saw Alice come up behind her speeding towards the right-most goal post on the opposite side of the playing field, and he saw the sun bounce off something shiny for a second—
“What’s he like, these days?” Ron asked. “I haven’t seen him around in a while. He dropped off the grid. Thought he’d left the country.”
“Yes. I think I am.” Draco was looking at Harry’s mouth, his chest, his shoulders—then he looked in Harry’s eyes. “Is that okay?”
“What if I try not to have big emotions?” Alice asked.
“I’m not a paragon of virtue,” Harry said, knot forming in his chest. “You can’t hold my life up as some kind of beacon of justice, some kind of goal to strive for or measure yourself against. I’m just me. And it’s…it has
Harry focused on what was happening in front of him. Charlie was having problems with his broom, it looked like. He had a lisp, which sometimes made it difficult for the broom to understand his commands.
“That’s hard to say. It’s complicated. I’ve learned that recovering from mental illness is a crooked thing. It’s not a straight line. It was good in some ways, not great in some others. I’m doing better now than I have in a long time.” He looked serious. “I might never completely recover, you know. Mental health recovery doesn’t really have an end date. I’m never going to be the same person I was before. I might get worse again—we’ve changed my medication twice already. I mean—I just need you to know that.”
“The short version? Therapy,” she said. “Years of it. I’ve been reaching out to people to make amends, or try to. Own up to all my bullshit so I can move on. You were the only one I hadn’t talked to yet, you’re…hard to find.”
Harry thought about this. “Do you think I should go to therapy?”
“Thank you,” she said, levelling an adoring look at her husband. They couldn’t stop grinning, and Harry couldn’t honestly fault them, even as he battled with his own mixed feelings.
“I saw it! But it got away from me,” Alice yelled, almost falling off her broom as she landed. Harry helped her up. “It’s so fast!”
He thought he heard Malfoy snort behind him and smiled to himself.
“Hi,” Harry said, awkwardly. “Uhm.” He glanced at the other girl. “I, ah. This is Draco. My boyfriend,” he said, practically dragging Draco in front of him. “Draco, this is, uh, Peony, my cousin, and—”
Charlie had three Chasers coming at him, flanked by both Beaters, and everyone was watching—holding their breaths—to see if Charlie would block the goal. Two things happened: Charlie blocked a Bludger with a sidekick to the left, and the Quaffle with his face, and Alice floated on her broom towards the grass as casual as you’d like, reached towards a flower—and caught the Golden Snitch.
“Yes, yes that was a brilliant game, both teams gave their all, and it was anyone’s guess who’d have won in the end,” he said, grinning happily. “Of course I’m happy my team won! I’m sure Dragonriders will get the next one.”
For a press event, Harry didn’t think it was too bad. It helped that he wasn’t the only famous person present; the reporters were just as interested in Lorcan d’Eath, who’d surprised everyone when he’d come back from obscurity to coach a Little League team, as they were in the brains behind the project (Oliver was positively radiating with pride), or Harry.
And then there were no more dishes, and Draco was looking at Harry like he was starving, and Harry did the only thing he could think to do and pulled him in for a kiss. He’d taken the outer layer of his robes off before starting dinner, so he was in rolled up shirtsleeves and trousers, while Harry was still wearing his full robes. Draco was handsy, undoing buttons quickly, so Harry’s outer layer was soon half off.
Harry’s chest was heaving and he knew he was on the verge of either hyperventilating or sobbing. Possibly both. He badly needed to clean up, but he’d been hoping Draco would join him in the shower after, or even the bath. He was low on bath bombs, but he had a rain one left, and one of those vanilla scented ones that Draco liked so much—but he was alone and Draco was probably in Wiltshire, which might as well have been a world away.
Harry lowered his fork. He hadn’t been serious; the words had just slipped out—but Draco’s matter of fact tone reminded him of the last time they’d talked about deserving things. “You’re not a side character, you know,” he said. “What you said the other day. You’re not a side character.”
“We’re taking over mum’s horse farm,” Seamus said. “In Ireland.”
“I will.”
“Apology accepted. To answer your question: I’d like to think so. It’s an ongoing process, but on the whole,” Malfoy shrugged, “I think I’m reaching a point where I’m okay with those parts. Maybe.”
“No reason,” Harry said, quickly. “I was—never mind. Let’s go back to the others.”
, this therapist could help. Maybe she had answers. Maybe she could tell him what was wrong with him, why not all of him had come back after he’d died, why his relationship with Ginny had fallen apart.
Yeah, no. Harry didn’t want to talk about any of those things, when it really came down to it. He wanted to talk to Draco about those things, but Draco had made it clear on Saturday that he couldn’t be Harry’s therapist. And there was one truth that Harry couldn’t ignore: Draco was right. Not just about that, but about something he’d once said, about facing the ugly parts of oneself.
Draco laughed. “That sounds like something my therapist might say. Actually, I think she did say it once.
“Tell me what you like,” Harry said, wanting to let Draco have everything. He’d give him everything. And Draco was good, kept talking, directing Harry, and giving praise, and he was beautiful, really. Flushed, and happy, and vibrant.
“It doesn’t really matter? If you want to see all the colours it’s easier if you drop that in first, but it’s also fun to watch it fizz around you in the water.” Harry checked the temperature. Still good.
Harry had homework to do today after Little League practice, but maybe…maybe Draco would like to come? He could ask. He was hell bent on finding time for a tea break with Draco at the Archive today, he’d ask then.
“I don’t think any of us got much sleep in those years.”
Harry was sitting in the middle of what looked like an exploded piece of furniture; pieces of wood, screws, and those little circular metal things that go around the screws were strewn around him in a circle. He was assembling a bookcase and had been at it for a while already, unable to wait any longer to get started. Two shelves were already complete and attached to one side of the bookcase to be.
“Is that—I’m getting conflicting information, folks,” Lee said, “did someone catch the Snitch? I’m not seeing a Snitch in play—”
“Yeah, right.” He snorted. “Where? How? This isn’t a goddamn novel, this is my
The barn turned out to be a semi-run-down building from the 17th century, located a fair distance from the Malfoy Manor but still within the grounds. A short distance away was the farmhouse associated with it. Both the barn and the farmhouse had been in use until the First War, Draco explained, until Voldemort had killed the Muggle family who’d rented that bit of land from the Malfoys to farm on it. The farmhouse Draco had already repaired a few years back and then partitioned the land it was on off from the rest of the Malfoy estate and given the lot to relatives of the family who’d lived there (they’d sold it, and now a different Muggle family was living there). The fields of arable land within the estates he’d also partitioned off and given to neighbouring farmers (all Muggles, bar one), and the barn…well, he’d kept it.
The poetry wasn’t his thing at all. He’d just have to take Malfoy’s word for its supposed cleverness.
Suddenly, Harry was on the verge of tears. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he said, thickly. “Can I call in sick for the rest of the day?”
“No, I mean yes, I liked parts of it, most of it—”
Draco was quiet. “I suppose,” he eventually said. “His story wasn’t a romance, anyway.”
owns it?”
Malfoy was smiling. “I stayed up late to finish it, too,” he said.
Harry had always thought he and Ginny would’ve had one or two little ones by now, but when he’d brought it up she’d said no. Harry had started a daycare instead. And now he and Ginny were a thing of the past and Harry was…relieved. Relieved that he was relieved, because that meant breaking up had been the right thing to do.
The kids scrambled to get themselves a broom—all brand new and shiny, still in the original factory stands. Nimbus had been ready to give Harry a hundred brooms for free, if only he was willing to give them a testimony. Twelve would do it, Harry had told them.
“The White Hart. I’m sure you know it, it’s not far from here.”
“Yeah? Of course.” Harry blinked. “I’m working off
“All right.”
Three things were happening at once. The brooms were all unresponsive and dead on the ground, all five kids were crying, and a tree was on fire.
Malfoy now had a crease between his eyebrows.
He’s not gone for good, Harry told himself, but didn’t believe it. Ginny also hadn’t gone for good when she’d gone, except then she had. What if Draco did write back, and what if he said he definitely wanted to end their relationship? What if he never wrote back at all and just stayed gone, the days dragging on and on until, finally, Harry would lose all hope of him coming back?
“Yeah. I’d like that.”
“You forgot, didn’t you?”
“I don’t know yet.” Draco had his eyes closed, breathing slowly. Harry squeezed his hand. “I’ll…tell her today, I suppose.”
The customer, who Harry now realised was Draco Malfoy, said: “I’m interested in coroner reports or death certificates or other documents that would describe an individual’s cause of death. Do you keep that sort of thing here?”
“This is Draco,” Harry said, as they reached the table. It felt odd not introducing them to each other, even though they did already know each other, so he did. “Draco, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan—we were roommates at Hogwarts.”
“Right,” Draco said. “How does that work? Who’s the father?”
“Let’s just go home.”
“Oi, Thomas.” Blaise leaned over the table to speak to Dean. “Gilliam’s mum owns an art gallery and has a spot open for a show next week—I sang your praises from here to Sunday, so get in touch?” He fished a business card out of his breast pocket. “I know it’s short notice, but she had an unexpected drop-out.”
“History,” Malfoy replied. “And…shame, and…”
Ginny assented, and they spent the next twenty minutes showing the kids how to perform the Hawkshead Attacking Formation and explaining whose job it was to do which part as they rotated in and out. Denise, Dorcas and Avery had turned out to be a fantastic Chaser trio, rivalled only by the Denise, Dorcas, and Emma trio. Rachel was a stronger Keeper than Chaser, so she’d relieve Charlie of his Keeper position when he rotated out, and Chaser if needed, and then there were Nathan, Love, Anthony, Joseph and Jamie, who were all strong Beaters. Anthony doubled as Seeker, so Harry put him down for that for the rota, as none of the others wanted to, or were any good at it. Jamie would also double as Chaser, and Emma as Beater.
“Good grief,” Ms Baxter said, hiding her amused chuckle behind her hand. “You’re putting together a team for this?”
“I quit,” he said to Mildred. “I’d also like to call in sick for the rest of the day.”
“And…how does the personal research assistant thing work, exactly?”
Gilliam turned out to be a Quidditch player, a reserve Chaser for Puddlemere United, which explained why Harry had seen him before. He and Blaise did seem rather taken with one another and Harry became conscious of the fact he was the only one at the table who hadn’t brought anyone with him.
like him.”
“Wow.” She shook her head, looking like she might cry again. “That was perhaps more honesty than I wanted.”
Draco nodded, leaning into Harry. This close, Harry could smell Draco’s hair, and he couldn’t resist putting his nose in it. Draco always smelled woody, though if it was because he spent a lot of time in his wood workshop or because of his shampoo, Harry didn’t know.
“It’s fine! Another time is fine.” Harry glanced towards the front desk, where Albert was going over the Archive’s correspondence, then back at Malfoy. “Uhm, I finished that book.”
Malfoy turned and left. The door closed behind him with a snick, and Harry stared at it resentfully.
“Looks like your date went well?” Ginny commented in a low voice as she handed him the clipboard. One name had been crossed off already, with equipment marked as returned.
Malfoy seemed surprised by this. “And yet you didn’t go into politics.”
“No!”
“Tell Avery,” Betty grumbled.
He didn’t see Malfoy again until closing; Harry had few errands in the reading hall that day and when he did, he noted that Malfoy kept his head down and went through the reports methodically, occasionally writing something in his notebook.
“I was only
Wiltshire was sunnier than London, and breezier, and didn’t look like the Wiltshire in Harry’s memories at all. Malfoy Manor was an imposing, pale building, but it loomed darkly, with shuttered windows and an unkempt lawn. A forest seemed to be encroaching on the Manor from two sides and there wasn’t a single white peacock in sight.
to look things up. Draco had only been coming here for a little over two months. Somehow, Harry had believed that this comfortable rhythm he had established with Draco would continue forever.
“Yes!” Harry threw up his hands. “I don’t know! But there’s no other metric, is there? It’s why we have the sodding law in the first place, isn’t it?”
“It’s a Quidditch-themed daycare,” Harry said. “Anyway, I brought you back your books.” He put the small stack of books on Malfoy’s desk. “I skipped the poetry collection.”
He wasn’t entirely sure he knew, really, all his suggestions sounding more and more ludicrous as he came up with them, going from “Everything about the fucking War, really” to “My cousin used to shove my head in the toilet at school and that just seems so insignificant now.” She’d prodded and poked, asked about this or that event, and then they’d talked about Dudley.
“I need it for the sky on my card!” Alice said.
Harry had not taught his team to do barrel rolls. Six year olds should
Harry was thrilled, and pleased, and giddy, and could’ve stayed like this for the rest of the evening. Just watching Draco’s face, feeling his shoulders, letting his fingers drift over Draco’s arm. Half-listening to the argument Dean and Seamus were having about sheep—they appeared to be discussing breeds now.
It was crazy how fast Harry had got used to his presence here, how fast he’d moulded his work day around Draco—if this was it, then they wouldn’t have a tea break together this afternoon at three. Or the rest of the week. Or any time after that. They’d have to establish a new kind of rhythm—
Harry stared at the rack, unseeing.
“I might have to move,” Harry said slowly, thoughtfully. He could probably find another flatshare if the old one wouldn’t take him back. Or he could move into Grimmauld Place if he really had to. Or he could stay, and ask Bill for advice—he did still have some of his inheritance left and while he’d put it all aside for the future, a nice house or something, he could live off it for now if he had to. And maybe—well, maybe this would be a good excuse to get rid of this flat and the last dregs of his relationship with Ginny.
“All clear. Come with me.” Harry pushed himself off the door jamb he’d been leaning against and gestured for Malfoy to follow.
Luckily it was only a five-foot drop.
The cards were covered in glitter, one card with heart-shaped glitter and the other with stars and balloons. Malfoy stared at them. “You run a daycare?”
“Yeah? What’ll you tell her? Am I your boyfriend?”
“Let’s sit outside.” Malfoy grabbed his cloak. It was raining; the hummingbirds in the painting were nowhere to be seen as the rain formed a grey wall of misery around the tree. That was one thing, another thing was the actual real-life rain pouring down outside both of the windows in the study. “I conjure an excellent umbrella, Potter, no need to look so worried.”
, according to Hermione.
“Think about what kind of magic you want your big emotion to be. Like butterflies or flowers or rain. It’s very hard to be scared when one is thinking about butterflies.”
Maybe, if Harry could complete the moving in process, it would make a difference. As if by unpacking some boxes he could…magically fix what was wrong between him and Ginny. Or fill up that hole inside that should be all for Ginny, that strange, unalive mass at his core that did nothing but cause him anxiety whenever he tried to wake it up.
“Okay,” Harry said automatically. He was having difficulties parsing this—did it mean that Ginny had been—that she’d—no, she couldn’t—
“I’m at my other job on Tuesdays,” Harry elaborated. “I’ll be in on Wednesday again, after lunch. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons, and all day on Friday,” he added. “That’s…my schedule.”
“I don’t know about that, I think it’s a
Ginny turned around again, a long-suffering look on her face. Rhosyn, on the other hand, was clearly trying to keep her laughter contained. “He hasn’t talked about anything else at practice all week,” she said. “Which, if you ask me, is pretty weird because having a date in a barn is one thing, but deciding to
, Harry definitely still hated the press. Hackles raised, he leaned towards the amplifier. “Did you have a question relevant to the topic at hand?”
“Right on. Come with me.” Harry checked that the contents of the trolley matched the ex libris list, then pushed it out of the hall. Malfoy pocketed his pencil and notebook, picked up his cloak—which he’d draped over the back of his chair—and followed Harry out.
“Because of Avery?” Harry dabbed some salve onto Betty’s lip. Hugh nodded. “All right. How about I teach you how to referee instead? Would you like that?”
“I love you,” Harry said, closing the distance between them so he could kiss him. Preferably forever. He was dripping water everywhere, and there were squeaky noises that Harry was sure weren’t from him, but he didn’t care. Everything was better now.
want to show you that, that all of them, they’re happy, you know? It’s not just in books, Draco. We get to have this in real life.”
“I’m trying to make friends with you,” Malfoy said. He glanced at Harry quickly, then looked ahead again. “I didn’t know how else to do it.”
Charlie was on the bench, Rachel keeping the goal in this last stretch, and both Love and Emma were beating Bludgers with a particularly keen vengeance Harry had only ever seen in girls.
,” Ginny commented, but she was grinning gleefully. “And a very enterprising one at that.”
“Chilling, isn’t it? I guess Dad wasn’t considering the impact it would have on our revenue stream when he allied himself with a genocidal madman,” Malfoy said dryly. “We lost all our tenants, so we couldn’t afford to keep the estates in good repair, et cetera.”
Maybe Ginny would like the card, after all? It didn’t have to be romantic, it could just be a card, and the kids had signed it…but she hadn’t been in touch since she’d left, even though she still had things at their flat, and…well,
He understood, on the logical, reasonable plan, what Draco was saying. Of course he didn’t have to. He knew that. But there was a different, illogical, reactionary part of him that didn’t understand at all, that was shooting up FAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE signals in his brain.
“All right,” Harry agreed. He could do that. Maybe he’d even learn more about Malfoy’s research and what he was doing it for. “Do I still get to help cataloguing sometimes?”
“May I?” Draco gestured to between them.
“I think,” Draco said slowly, “that wanting something isn’t the same as deserving—”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. She’s busy, couldn’t make it today.”
The barn was quiet, except for the tittering of birds from the hayloft. Harry could smell fresh wood and dirt through the scent of food still sitting on the stove, but he could see what Draco was talking about. He could see how the space could become theirs—where the bookshelves would go, how the light from the proposed solarium and the knocked down wall that would make space for it would brighten up the barn, how he could spend his days here with Draco knowing it would be forever. And it was doable—Harry would be happy to sink the remainder of his inheritance into building  this with Draco, and helping him, even if all he would be able to do was fetch things while Draco did all the difficult expert stuff.
Anti-Bone Breaking Charms on Quidditch wear weren’t technically illegal, so Harry didn’t comment. He did inspect Love’s hand anyway, for any sign of injury, and when he found nothing wrong he directed her to wait with Nathan and Anthony.
Harry stood in the middle of the empty living room, staring at the bookcase in the corner—still empty—and felt utterly and completely dejected. He went to bed.
“I’ll look into it,” he said, putting down his empty pint glass.
She tapped her chin with a finger. “I’ll be honest with you, sexuality, sexual health, sexual dysfunction—it isn’t my area of expertise. I’d like to do some research and then pick up this thread later. Will it be all right if I owl you some reading material before we meet again?”
“Yes! They were new things when we had the course, they’re these like, telephones, that Muggles can take with them outside the house. They keep them in their pockets. They work with invisible technology waves, which…well, if it weren’t for the fact I know it isn’t magic, I’d say it’s magic. And they can use the telephones to send messages as text too, which is very cool. Anyway,” Malfoy continued, “we learned things like the difference between a butt dial and a booty call.”
, and now a lot of people are seeing me, and it’s like I’ve hit solid ground. Does that make sense?” His voice broke. “It doesn’t make sense, it’s—”
“Tell me again who’ll be there,” Draco said, his hand somehow both warm and clammy in Harry’s.
“You need to learn where your boundaries are. Communicate with your partner what you’d like to try—or not try. Stop when you have to. Make sure you respect his boundaries, too.”
“Hi!” The kids chorused back.
She narrowed her eyes at him, as if trying to decide what kind of bug he was, but then she shrugged. “Next time,
Enclosed was a sheaf of papers that all looked like Muggle photocopies and print-outs which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be articles. They were all about sex in some way or other, ranging from trauma and dysfunction to sexuality and different types of verbal communication and body language.
Malfoy pointed. “That one is a classic, a coming of age novel about a wizard, not personally my favourite but it’s not bad. It’s, ah, a cultural corner stone? The saying to be as stubborn as a cabbage comes from there. And that one is a Muggle romance novel, that is to say, it’s not written by a Muggle, but it’s about a wizard who falls in love with one. It came out last year. That one is a collection of poetry, which I don’t know if you like, but I thought it amusing and clever. Critics hated it, though. And that one on top is a Muggle novel.” Malfoy leaned closer. “It’s a s
The flat was quiet as death in the wake of Draco’s departure, and Harry was struggling to breathe.
“There’s nothing easy about it,” Harry protested.
“GO, ALICE!” Ginny and Rachel both screamed, and soon Emma and Nathan were screaming too. Alice was on Seeker rota and she’d clearly spotted the Golden Snitch—she wove in between players erratically, following a sharp sparkle glinting in and out of existence as it flittered in and out of shadow. “GOOO-oh no!”
“I don’t know.
“I didn’t!” Hugh sniffled. “It’s my favourite bat and I always use it but you took it anyway even though I always, always—”
Ginny nearly dropped the Snitch. “A date? Tonight?”
Harry drew in a deep breath and made more toast. He’d talk to him—see if they couldn’t patch themselves up, but to do that he needed a plan. While eating, he made a list.
“Mr Harry!” There was no telling which kid had said that, so Harry flashed them all a smile.
“I’m serious about the flat. I can cover the rent on my own, but…” Harry shrugged. “You know how it is.”
“No, on Wednesday, it’s just, waiting is awful. One isn’t supposed to kiss until the first date? Right? But I really want to. But it wouldn’t be appropriate? Merlin’s mouldy socks,” Harry cursed, rubbing his face. He wasn’t sure whether it was good that he wouldn’t be seeing Malfoy at all tomorrow because on Tuesdays he wasn’t at the Archive at all, or whether it was worse because he would be seeing Malfoy on Wednesday at the Archive before their date, and he’d have to…somehow pretend they weren’t going on a date later when he saw him? Pretend like it was any other Wednesday, fetch Malfoy coroner reports, maybe entice him to join him for a tea break, talk about normal things and somehow not combust over the fact that they’d be leaving together, maybe holding hands—would Malfoy even
“But you think mine could be.”
“In the bath?”
“I like the orange and black ones,” Alice said.
“Both,” Malfoy replied. He was smiling too, now, though his cheeks seemed to be a stronger shade of pink. “What’s the status?”
“Did you finish the book?”
? Was he actually going to meet his cousin for
“Yeah,” Harry confirmed. “They call it a triad, though. Two kids so far, Fred and Roxanne. Fred is…three, and Roxanne is the little one. They’re great kids; when I babysit I let Fred win at gobstones. I think he knows I’m letting him win, but he’s pretending he doesn’t know so he won’t hurt my feelings.”
“No problem. I haven’t seen them in ages. It’s going to be fun.”
The broom didn’t move.
“Yes, well, I think this argument has rather soured the experience,” Harry bit back, a dark coil of anger and hurt unfurling in his stomach. “I was fine, I didn’t want to fight, but you just had to—”
“Yeah,” Harry said, confused what Draco’s dad had to do with anything.
“Thank you,” Blaise said, slamming his hand on the table. “I would prefer not to relive that terrible, awkward, horrible time. Let’s focus on how much more suave and handsome I have become since.” He flashed Gilliam a smile.
It wasn’t raining very hard in that moment, it was more like the weather couldn’t decide between being a mist or a drizzle. Either way, it was wet, and when Harry took a breath to see what smelling the weather was all about, he picked up wet earth, damp brick, and the moist bark of the willow trees in the garden. He also picked up the scent of their food, flaky buttery pastry, slow-cooked meat and gravy and roasted vegetables. It smelled different out here than it’d done inside.
At this the kids gasped, some in delight at the story, others in fear of what was going to happen next in the story. Harry gave them a conspiratorial smile. “Can you guess what happened next?”
“I saw in the paper.”
Great. Perfect. Just…fucking dandy.
“Of course you do.” Draco rose from the table, picking up their empty plates. He bent down quickly to give Harry a kiss on the cheek. “It’s what I love about you,” he murmured, and then he was gone, already by the sink, before Harry properly processed what he’d said.
“I could break your nose again if you’d like?”
“No,” Draco said. “I’m not ready for any of that.” He sat up, breaking contact, and leaned forwards over his knees instead, hugging them. “I’m sorry.”
“What if there aren’t any?”
Maybe if he brought this up with Gladys she’d tell him to stop worrying about it.
“I’m not saying she did, Harry. That’s for you to decide. But I think we can agree that you did not have a healthy relationship.”
He wondered which parts of the book Malfoy had enjoyed. The science? The people? The political plot? The romantic plot? Space? The almost extremely non-magical Muggleness of it? He wondered if Ginny would’ve enjoyed it, and realised he didn’t know.
After his date with Draco on Saturday, Harry sent Hilde with a letter to the Muggle therapy clinic about an appointment, and then did his best to forget all about it the rest of the weekend, choosing instead to do his homework and start the novel he and Draco had bought together. Draco had gone home Saturday evening to be with his Mum the rest of the weekend, cutting their plans short, but it’d been okay—Harry had been plenty busy. And then, Monday morning, before he’d left for the daycare, he’d finally received a reply from the clinic: he had an appointment later that same day with a Gladys Oakland, who had a slot available.
“No. The epilogue ruined it all.”
Harry was brought up short. “Join me?” He’d be lying if he said it didn’t sound appealing. A hot soak with a choice bath bomb and Draco in there with him? The mere idea of it spoke to all of Harry’s senses. “Yeah, okay, if you want to.”
Harry looked at the roster he’d copied out and fished a pencil out of his pocket. It was a messy list, copied out in the order he’d selected the kids instead of alphabetised. He’d have to fix that later. “Let’s get right to it, then. Denise Norbury?”
,” Ron commented, his eyes twinkling.
thing.”
Harry packed the first aid kit up again. “That’s a plan. Now. Before we do anything else. Is there anything you two should be saying to each other?” He looked at the kids expectantly. They were good kids and usually needed only a little prompting to apologise to each other, but Harry knew that was the most difficult part of any conflict.
“I’m sorry I can’t be what you want,” he said, forcing the words out through the knot in his throat. “I wanted to be enough for you. I wanted it to be enough that I love you, that nothing else mattered, or…”
Draco was quiet for a while, his lip wobbling and his eyes shiny, jaw clamped shut. Finally, when it seemed like he was going to be able to speak without crying, he did. “You know, you’re doing a terrific job as a love interest,” he said. “That was—a lovely speech. Certainly a…good moment, the kind that in the books usually ends in a kiss—”
“That’s between me and him.” Harry wavered, but then followed her over and sat opposite her. “It was stupid anyway, but it just proved—it proved that I’ll fuck shit up. I couldn’t make it work with you, and now apparently I can’t make it work with him, and—” he cut himself off, his throat so tight it hurt, and pressed his eyes closed. “It’s never enough,” he forced out.
“That’s great teamwork!” he called out, jogging out to meet them. “I’m glad to see you’re all getting along!
happy endings. And I want you to be mine.”
And if Harry had to be completely honest with himself, he missed Draco’s presence at the Archive as well.
But it was hypocritical, Harry thought, to hold himself in better regard. He’d gotten a combined prison and community service sentence too. He’d used Unforgivables. He’d caused injury and death to a lot of innocent bystanders when he’d broken into Gringotts with Ron and Hermione, and he had to live with that knowledge for the rest of his life. Hell, he’d probably broken more laws than Malfoy had, but Harry had gotten two months in prison, and Malfoy had gotten a year.
Excellent. Harry helped Charlie towards the other children and got him joining the little Quaffle circle almost seamlessly.
“I suppose,” Harry said, frowning. He’d taken Calming Draught a number of times and didn’t care for it at all. It didn’t compare to a bath bomb, in his opinion. “I don’t think they’re the same.”
Little League Quidditch didn’t ban players, but the referees often sent the rowdy ones off-pitch to cool down for a bit and assigned penalty shots instead. Three shots per penalty, which meant that the Butterfly Bumpkins had six shots and Candy Cranes three (Harry did briefly wonder if Candy Cranes should’ve had another three, for Alice’s impressively violent butterflies, but Oliver seemed to believe they didn’t count as a foul).
“Mind if I join you?”
Quaffles were dropped, Bludgers hit shins, Snitches proved elusive. The kids shrieked and giggled and put up a valiant effort, and slowly, slowly, Harry began to register patterns and pick up strengths and weaknesses. Petite little Emma Wyncall, who Harry had set to play Chaser, kept trying to bludgeon the Bludgers with the Quaffle, whenever she had it, so he made a note on the roster to let her play Beater next time. On the other hand, Anthony kept getting distracted by the Golden Snitch whenever it fluttered by, causing him to miss several Bludgers. He fell off his broom, once, but was back on it before Harry could react.
He was definitely looking at Harry’s mouth. “Kiss me,” Harry said, closing the distance between them. “Please?”
“So, Big D,” Harry said. “Why are we here?”
“Do you know where you are?”
“Okay,” Harry said, happy to have a lapful of Draco, and kissed him back.
The shower was on.
No, that was a lie. He missed her. He missed her friendship. He just didn’t miss the rest of it.
“Right! Yes. Well, I hired local Muggles to do renovations and repairs and the like. Carpenters, masons, thatchers, and so on. I helped where I could and learned a lot about the manual process—ask me one day what I know about woodwork—and took Muggle Studies classes at the College in the evenings, so I wouldn’t make a complete cock of myself. I did in the beginning, you know. They must’ve thought I was some kind of eccentric.”
Looking at the neat little piles already on the desk, Malfoy nodded. He was still looking a bit distressed, but his eyes were bright.
“Besides, there was the Yule Ball.”
Time, Harry could understand. “Okay.” He put a hand on Draco’s back. There were streaks of colour there from the bath bomb. Draco startled, so Harry withdrew it. “I’m sorry. I’m not trying to push, I’m just trying to understand.”
“Have you ever seen a sheep in your life, city boy?” Seamus challenged.
“Do you think the brooms will want to fly now?” Harry had already reset the brooms, but maybe he should see a technician about an inspection. This was the third time in two weeks that his toy brooms had picked up on a child’s feelings, which was an uncommon problem for him to have.
“And?” Dean prodded. “We did hear about you and Ginny. Was that…?”
to,” Malfoy said.
“Did your aunt catch fire?”
“Oh, that,” said Harry, his belly swooping. “It’s a thing.”
“I don’t—” Draco shook his head. “I’ll never be done with that. That’s not a process that ever really ends...I just happened to run out of properties to give away.”
“You all set?” Harry parked the trolley by Malfoy’s desk.
Armed with just the one book (the receipt now nestled in Harry’s pocket, in case Draco wanted to exchange the book for another), Harry walked down the street, keeping an eye out for a good spot to Apparate from. He hoped Draco would be home. Harry had (finally) learned that Draco lived with his mum in Wiltshire, though not in the Manor—another house on the grounds, he’d said, a dower house. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too hard to find.
“No, actually…” Malfoy’s mouth twitched. “I like to read in bed. It’s not very practical either, I suppose, but it’s very comfortable.”
(also from Hermione),
noise. “He’s moved in, then?”
“What about those who have hurt other people?” Draco then asked. “What about—what about Voldemort?”
Relief washed over Harry and he let out a breath. “I don’t know if that’s really necessary, but…thanks.”
That was an interesting development. It was also the first sign of blatant emotion Harry could remember seeing on Malfoy’s face since…well, since he’d first stepped into the archive.
that idea,” Lisa said. “I can think of a few romance novels like that, but they’re all about straight people. Do you want gay ones, or will the straight ones do?”
“Oh.” Harry couldn't quite figure out if the odd spinning feeling in his chest was disappointment or fear, or both. If Narcissa wasn't going to let him see Draco, then—
“Of course,” she said. “Will you take tomorrow as well?”
“Shame, that. It’s a catchy title.”
“What?” Draco startled.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I’ve just never seen anyone do wandless magic before.”
sorry for what I said. I don’t want to hurt you like that ever again,” he said. “Uhm, I—you asked me what my damage was. If you care to know, it’s, uh, I don’t know how to say no. I mean, I know, but I don’t
Harry wasn’t entirely sure he understood, but Malfoy’s enthusiasm was rubbing off on him. “Yeah, I think so? But I’m not sure talking teacups would be able to form functional societies with, like, social structures and all, and, uhm, have sex.”
“I’ve been wondering,” she said, picking at a loose thread in her jeans, “if…if the reason you don’t want me is because you’re gay. Because I think I could live with that. Because…then it’s not me.”
Not the most auspicious start to the morning, but Harry’s insides were a roiling dark sea of mixed emotions. Malfoy had shared quite a lot of himself, lately, and Harry hadn’t answered in kind. No wonder Malfoy didn’t want to come to the pub—no matter that they had a past: they weren’t the same people anymore. Malfoy certainly wasn’t.
“No consequences?”
“Someone needs to take this back,” Ginny said. “And to be honest with you, Harry, I’m not ready to meet him.”
There were things he could say, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to share them. Things he’d learned in private conversation, through observation, from reading the novels that Draco had lent him.
“Let’s get dressed,” he said.
“Oh,” Harry said, looking at the cover. “I don’t know…”
The happy warm feeling from dinner had subsided, though looking at Draco now, Harry thought it might come back. “I’m okay.”
Charlie bit his lip, but Harry could see the resolve in his face despite it. A moment later he nodded, and then he was sitting on the broom. Whatever had been wrong earlier seemed to have evaporated.
Harry tracked mud after him when he met Malfoy for lunch at the archive. “I know, I know,” he said, swishing his wand about and getting rid of most of the dirt, “you’d think I’d have learned to use weatherproof charms after all these years as a wizard.”
The fact that he and Ginny currently weren’t on speaking terms didn’t help at all to dispel that feeling.
“I want to be,” was Harry’s immediate response. If you’ll have me, he thought. Even if I’m me. “Look, that book? Is just a book. It’s not an indicator for your life, or mine, or anyone else’s. We get to make our own happy endings, all right? We deserve that.”
“I’m glad it was me.” Harry gave him a smile. “I liked hanging out with you. I still do.”
be happy for his friends. He
“I have it,” Malfoy said, fishing the folded piece of paper out from a hidden pocket and handing it over.
“Mmh.” Was it just Harry, or was Draco looking at his mouth? “So, I wanted to ask—”
“You’re in a good mood,” said Pansy when Harry slid into the chair next to her. “What’s up?”
“Draco,” Harry continued, closing the distance between them. “I don’t know how to make you understand that you deserve good things—”
