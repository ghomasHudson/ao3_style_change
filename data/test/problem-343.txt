“Or we could take both take the afternoon off and go back to your place and I can show my gratitude in another way,” Draco suggested, his lips brushing teasingly against Harry’s. His warm breath smelled of mint and Harry wondered whether he’d taken the time to brush his teeth when he went inside to get his coat.
“Maybe, just as long as it doesn’t have kale in it?” At Draco’s inquisitive eyebrow, Harry added, “I can’t stand the stuff.”
Sensing another one of Ron and Hermione’s bicker matches impending, Harry cut into the conversation before Ron could say something which would annoy Hermione even more. “It’s from your brothers. Looks like they’ve got a new product for sale soon.”
“Potter,” Harry spit out without thought. At Draco’s confused look, he explained, “My last name. It’s Potter. I realised after last time that I didn’t even learn your last name.”
“Who’s that from?” Fred asked as he pulled out his wand and vanished the potion he’d been experimenting on from the cauldron so he could start again.
Harry coughed and quickly withdrew his hand, offering his apologies and a rushed “Good evening” as he and the escort slipped past the other couple and he steered them down the hall towards his room. Slipping the key card into the door, Harry unlocked the room and pulled the other man in, spinning him around and pushing him up against the door as it clicked shut. Not wasting any time, Harry yanked open the belt and fastens of the man’s trousers and yanked them down his thighs as Harry dropped to his knees behind him.
Suddenly Harry’s legs were clamped tightly around his waist and the world spinned as Harry flipped them both and straddled Draco’s prone body on the cold ground. The world around them grew fuzzy as the invisibility cloak slid down, draping across their bodies and shielding them from any prying eyes.
“1:30?” Harry felt tension slip into muscles that had only moments ago been loose and pliant with satisfaction. “Harry, have you had that erection the whole time?”
Draco’s top leg slipped forward and Harry followed him, wrapping his arm around the man that he’d been in love with for over twenty years and holding him close.
“It’s you,” they said in unison.
“Not you, I was talking to the cabbie,” he explained as he climbed out of the back of the taxi. “Why do you think we’ve had IT running all sorts of traces to try and ID who’s been torpedoing our campaign? Of course, I’m going to come and see who’s behind it.”
When he awoke the next morning, Draco was gone.
“We’re a boutique advertising agency,” Draco said, crossing his arms in front of his chest and giving Harry a haughty look, which morphed into one of annoyance when Harry started laughing. “Are you mad? That would be so like me to pick up a nutter for a quick shag.”
“But what if they don’t appreciate you tracking them down? What if they’re violent?” Hermione asked.
“Well, we don’t actually know that yet, but our IT department is working on that,” Hermione said, her shoulders shrinking into herself when Snape let out a very loud and prolonged breath through his nose, his displeasure obvious.
“Yeah, let’s do that. And until then, let’s keep this between the two of us. I don’t want to panic Oliver if it turns out to be nothing.” Their boss, Oliver Wood, had a well-established tendency to become fixated on things, and Harry knew that if they clued him into this, he would have them working 18 hour days until they had worked out a plan of action to attack the problem that Harry wasn’t yet convinced existed.
Hermione pulled her head out from under the table for just long enough to shoot Ron an exasperated look. When Harry laughed, she swung the look to him and he returned it with one of his own. “What? It’s not my fault!”
“Git.” He rolled his eyes “maybe.”
“Of course you didn’t know.”  Harry laughs at his best friend. “I was planning to take him to the Zoo, Jen’s IceCream Shop and then at the Amusement Park.”
“You said that earlier yet here you are still alive.” Harry chuckles
He rolled his eyes “Mate, you’re not my type.”
“Well thank you for the compliment.” He interrupts
“You’ll have to go to find out.” Luna whispered to him. Harry groaned again, he didn’t really want to attend but he was now too curious that maybe he will just attend this time.
Two minutes had passed until he could see Hermione and Draco together walking towards them. He felt his heart beating rapidly at the sight of him. Draco looked good as always of course he was wearing all black today except for his shoes which was brown boots. His hair was gelled back perfectly.
“I’m just.. I’m quite nervous to talk with him.” He shrugged.
Harry: NO
“I- Harry.” He swallows “I’m in love with you too.. always has been and always will.”
“W-what?” He stuttered
His stomach flutters, they stopped walking “Face me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please?” he adds.
“Harry.” He greets and grinned so much. He seemed stunned to see him here tonight.
“No, we didn’t.” Harry sighs “ look it’s silly and I won’t tell you all about it.”
“My name is Harry.” He continues then shook Draco’s hand which was already ready. After for awhile he withdraws his hand even though he liked the feeling of Draco’s soft skin to his.
“Hm, okay but later promise us you’ll not ignore him.” Mione sighs “okay?”
“It’s okay.” Draco chuckles “just don’t do it again.. it’s not good for us.”
“It is.” Harry shrugged and stared at tired face.
He replied “He’s at the living room, sir.” Then he went to open the grand door.
“Potter.” He heard Draco called for him
“I’m back.” Draco announced and faced to Harry “I ordered French fries for us.”
“Nothing.” Luna shrugged
He walked towards the kitchen to get a snack for both him and the weeping girl. As he reached out a snack placed above a counter, someone poked his back. He yelped and quickies turned around to see the git who turned out to be Draco.
“Harry.” She smiles “You look exhausted.. how’s your classes?”
“Anyways, Mione texted me that their professor finally dismissed them.” Luna announces.
“Maybe,” Ron shrugged “there’s nothing to do.”
“Oi, Harry.” Ron was knocking loudly on his door “let me in.”
“They’re going out tonight.” He stated “ I will go if I finish my homework.”
“Malfoy.” He greeted back and he could feel Ron was smiling at them.
“I’d like a burger and malibu.” He told him
Hopefully, they will meet.
When the bell rang, Ron had left him in the hallway and the students were now crowding the hallways looking for their classrooms. He felt claustrophobic for a second but thankfully the students moved fast enough. He decided it was now the best idea to leave the school and head home. Harry heard someone called his name but he ignored it and started to walk back to his dorm.
He looked a bit drunk but he still looked beautiful, his cheeks were red, his hair was gelled back and his grey eyes looked a bit darker.
“Both of you are really cute.” Blaise commented
“They are, I almost laugh everyday because of them” Harry commented and leaned in closer to Draco’s side.
Bliss.
Harry blushed “more friends, more fun.” All of them laughed except for Harry who was embarrassed and looked away.
He was still mad about Draco talking to a girl at the party. So he pretty much avoided the boy even though Draco seldom asks him to hang out with him sometimes. He rejected and managed to reason that he always managed to ask at the wrong times so he had to reject him. Also Harry had classes on that time and  he was pretty quite serious about school.
Things were going well they hanged out most of the times. They even watched the football game and went to get ice cream afterwards.
Malfoy: are we seriously sexting right now?
Cedric had kissed him one night after they secretly dated for a month. They were at the Driggory’s house specifically nearby the pool. Harry was half naked and his boyfriend was on top of him, kissing his jawline.
“Getting lost in my eyes, huh, Potter?” He teases.
“We’ll see.” Hermione says
“Of course.” She grins and hugged him
“Sure.” Draco finally spoke
“This is the best ice cream I’ve tasted ever since I attended at Grammys.” He smiled
“Seriously?” Harry could obviously hear Draco smiling when he asked that.
“Maybe, he hasn’t been dismissed yet.” Luna told him “I heard his professor is giving them a hard time.”
“Mate, you ok?” He heard his friend Ron asked. “You look shit.”
“I’ll stop then.” Draco stopped and looked at him with a cute expression.
“Harry, promise me.. be brave next time.” He says “be brave for the person you’ll love.”
“What do you mean?” He questions and Blaise just chuckled then told him to open it when he gets home.
“I have my ways.” She smiled proudly and hermione just high-five her.
“I’m fine and I just wanna go home.” Harry shrugged and the other boys face frowned. “You can go now, thank you for your concern.”
“Yep, Blaise.” Ron nods in agreement
“Im deciding wether I should go back or just stay here to hang with you.” He says and Harry panicked. He didn’t clean his room and his bed was a mess.
“Great! Now that I’ve seen you.” Harry pecked his lips quickly.
Draco M.
“Do you wanna see the fishes?”
“I’m sorry I couldn’t help you out when we were at the mart.” He spoke softly “my dad insisted for me to go home early that night.”
“Thank you for making a deli food.” Harry spoke as Draco was already outside the door.
Harry was low-key freaking out about it but mostly about his parents reaction if they knew he liked a boy. Since this time he didn’t want to hide his relationship with Draco. Sure, he wasn’t scared of other people’s opinions about him but his parents really mattered. His friends were very supportive about them but he thought he wasn’t ready to really be publicly out.
“Neither do I.” Harry said, truthfully. “You left in a hurry and I forgot to give you my phone number.”
“C-Cedric, I-“ he looked at him and Cedric was still closing his eyes. It was silent for a second when his heart beat had stopped.

“Can we now go see the sharks?” Draco suggests just to get away from the crowd who was talking about them.
“Do your own homework, idiots.” She says and looked at them in a very disappointed manner. Harry just laughed at them and looked back at what was happening to nev and Blaise, apparently Draco has been looking at him or they did happen to look at each other at the same time. Draco gave him a small smile and he reciprocated.
I don’t think I can go.. I’m too tired
“Cedric, I-.” He sighs
“So, who’s gonna be the planner?” Draco asks “I volunteer Blaise.”
Maybe he is mad, he thought.
“He’s always busy so I think he never noticed.” He sighed as he remembered that time where Malfoy had told him about his Dad being busy for months and that’s when he will be free the most. “Thank you for telling me about the pictures.”
“It’s really nice to meet you.” He continues and Draco smiles softly.
“Can we go with you?” Blaise smiles evilly
“I don’t really wanna get a ticket, Draco.” He argues “besides, I really want to surprise you.”
“Sorry, dear.” She chuckled “I can’t leak more information now, Harry.”
“I met a friend.” He says and immediately he spotted Draco nearby who was looking at him from the other side of the pool.
“N-no.” He flinched and stuttered “I was just concerned.”
“Okay.”
“A little birdie?” He questions
They arrived at the amusement park with Draco complaining he was hungry and tired from all of the kissing. So they’ve decided to go to one of the stalls and bought burgers.
“I’m sorry they found you again.”
Harry sighed and didn’t move. Draco just stared at him and leaned in closer to his face. Draco was taller than him and it intimidated him and nervous. He turned around to unlock the door. When they both entered, Harry flinched when he saw a piece of his hoodie on the floor.
“Thank you?” He says “Why can’t he give it to me himself?”
“I like seeing you laugh” Draco told him and put his arm around Harry’s shoulders. They were almost cuddling and he liked it, Draco was very comfortable to be leaned on.
Harry: what are u wearing?
“What does that supposed to mean?” Harry looked at her.
Draco nods in approval “My father will like that idea.. his family side lives in there.”
“Eh, How old are you?” He asks the crying girl
“I like seeing you laugh too.” Harry whispered to him and he felt Draco sighed. “Your smile can brighten my day alone.”
You must be wondering why I gave you my lovely figurine. Well it’s because I wanted to ask you for the Halloween party but sadly I couldn’t attend due to family events. But you could take him (my figurine) with you. That’s if you agree to go out with me? I’d hate to see you with another person so say yes.
He then looked at the box, it was from Draco. He can’t believe Draco gave him a present? was it a present? It wasn’t even his birthday. He opened the box and the box contained with a black silver figurine of..Draco.
“Ouch.”
“I’ll have to pass.” He said feeling a bit tired “I’d have to find my friends and see if they’re okay.”
“Just no.”
“That guy over there.” Luna says “Mione, I think it’s not a good idea to say false rumors about a guy we never met.”
Malfoy: you’re already here?
“Is this like the part where you should go?” Harry questioned him and Draco just shrugged
“Hm.”
“We kinda know each other.” Draco says “you always placed first and I always second.”
“Hi.” He waved at him and Ron gave him a small smile.
“Sure.” He nodded and looked at Draco “Shall we?”
“That can be fixed.” His mom thought for a moment “I’ll just buy the loft next to yours.”
Thank you for reading :)
He was quite shy back then and was unable to confess his feeling for her. It hurt him when his crush finally went out with that boy.
After, looking at the attractions it was now noon time and Harry decided to take him to the ice cream shop. They decided to just walk towards the store since it was only a walking distance.
“Um..ok?” Harry told him his number and Blaise typed it very slowly which caused him to repeat a couple of times.
“Give me a clue?” What a stubborn headed lad “pretty please?”
“How about you, Draco.” Blaise said “Your relatives stays there. You do it.”
“It’s okay, we’re still gonna be friends right?”  He asks
“Yep, the pen holds a sentimental value.” Draco adds in to which Hermione rolls her eyes. Clearly, knowing they were lying.
“Our first date hasn’t even finished yet.” He said, amused “can’t get enough of me?”
work here. What are
Several minutes later, the bartender delivered the Old Fashioned that Harry had ordered to the sexy man, leaning down and saying something that Harry couldn’t hear from this far away, but that earned a cocked eyebrow. The man said something in return to the bartender, who chuckled, before blasting Harry with that intense gaze again and taking a slow sip that lasted for the entire time it took the bartender to walk back to Harry.
“Harry, are you listening?”
“Really? Then whose soggy cereal is strewn across the floor right now?
“All those men in that club wanted you. I bet I could make a small fortune if I auctioned off this beautiful hole of yours to let someone else come inside you, do you know that?”
Draco reached down and encircled Harry’s wrist with his long fingers. His hands were cool, sending a chill up Harry’s arm as Draco began steering him towards the door into the pub.
The Healer chuckled softly and agreed, “I would imagine so, as long as you don’t run out of lubrication.”
Harry pinned his arms, still outside of the cloak’s cover, to the ground and leaned down until his face was hovering just above Draco’s, his lips a breath away from Draco’s.
“Sorry ladies! I need my friend back,” Ron consoled the bridal party, who gave Harry and Ron exaggerated looks of disappointment as the two men made their way back down the bar. Harry was disappointed to see that there was no sign of the mysterious man he’d been pulled away from earlier. “I thought maybe you went to the loo, but I definitely didn’t expect to see you using a woman’s belly button as a shot glass.”
“Scoot forward,” Albus barked the order as he yanked the magazine out of Scorpius’s hands and dropped it on the lounge chair he had just vacated. When Scorpius didn’t move, Albus smacked his back lightly a few times until Scorpius reluctantly slid forward, making room for Albus to slide in between his back and the backrest of the chair. “I’m going to make sure every inch of this porcelain skin is slathered with sunblock and then you and I are going for a swim.”
Harry crowded into the man’s left side, letting the hard line of his cock, which was tucked into the elastic band of his pants, graze the escort’s arm. Harry could tell that the man’s suit was expensive, made of a high-quality material, and Harry couldn’t wait to strip it off him. “How much for the whole night?”
Harry sprang off of him and Draco couldn’t help himself, bursting into laughter as Harry jumped around, trying to shake the snow out from his clothing.
The guards stepped forward and took Lucius’ arms once again as he dropped his grip on his wife’s hands and stepped around her. He didn’t look back as he left the courtroom, but he knew that his family was strong and they would rise like a phoenix out of the ashes he had wrought.
The cheering had started again and somehow they seemed to be getting louder, though Harry had no idea how that was even possible. Harry smiled sheepishly at the crowd of women and took a fortifying breath before bending over and slurping up the puddle of liquid. The bride sat up as he swallowed and leaned forward, offering the lime wedge still lodged between her teeth to him. Harry took it, his lips brushing hers for the briefest of moments before he pulled back, biting into the tart citrus and chasing the tequila down.
“You love this, don’t you, you little whore?” the man snarled as he jerked Harry’s cock in time with his own thrusts. Releasing Harry’s cock, his fingertips curved around Harry’s hips and dug in as he pulled Harry back to meet each of his pounding thrusts.
Draco grinned at hearing exactly what he had expected Harry to say come out of his mouth. “That’s what I hoped you would say. Tweaky?”
“I wonder if all of that wasted tequila gets docked from his pay.”
Harry laughed. “That’s probably a good idea.”
The too-long taxi ride was followed by questing tongues, fumbling hands, hastily shed clothing, and sweat-slicked bodies. Once they were finished, Harry collapsed down onto the bed and sleep quickly overtook him.
Hermione’s voice droned on in his ear but Harry didn’t hear a word she said after that because just then the door was pulled open and Harry’s mind was overcome with shock as he stood face-to-face with the very last person he expected.
“That doesn’t seem too bad?” Harry asked uncertainly. “It’s not like we expected the campaign’s effectiveness to continue on exponentially. We knew it would slow down eventually.”
“Do you want to start crushing up the mistletoe berries and I’ll get started on part one of the brew?” Harry asked as he slid the mortar and pestle across the bench to Malfoy.
“Sure you did. You said you owed me one,” Harry said, grinning back at him.
Harry could see Hermione’s head whip around and her eyes bug out as she urged him to do
Harry took another long drink from his beer before setting it down on the bar and leaning down into the posh git’s personal space. “How much?”
“Well, we’re still trying to get to the bottom of it, but it appears that someone may be launching a counter-campaign,” Harry stammered out. His confident swagger was long gone and he’d gone from expecting a promotion a few weeks ago to hoping beyond hope that he managed to keep his job.
The two Aurors looked at each other and then seemed to decide that the risk was manageable before the one standing between him and Narcissa stepped back. Lucius couldn’t help but notice that his wand was grasped firmly in his hand.
Draco regarded Harry with a dry, amused look. “I don’t recall offering to take you out to lunch.”
Professor Slughorn’s chest puffed up and Harry interjected before Slughorn could fawn all over him again, “Sir, I think Seamus might need some guidance.”
Lucius nuzzled his nose against his wife’s straight hair, trying to commit the smell of her custom made perfume to memory. He may never have a chance to inhale that soothing smell again, and his memory would need to sustain him through the next 25 years. Assuming he lived that long.
Looking disappointed, the man refastened his trousers and let himself out of the room, the lineup outside having dispersed since he entered.
Harry groaned and nodded his head, the movement causing the condoms beneath him to rub together, squeaking. “Please, Daddy! I’ve been a good boy for you.”
Draco slipped his hand over Harry’s cheek and turned his face upwards. “What do you need, my sweet?” Draco asked in a sultry tone.
“It simply means that all three websites were set up using the same computer,” Hermione explained.
Harry hadn’t seen Jake since their break-up nearly two years ago, but fortunately, the break-up had been amicable and when they ran into each other at the supermarket—where Harry was scowling down at the display of kale bunches and contemplating a change of career—they had decided to grab a coffee and catch-up. When Jake had informed Harry that since they had parted ways he’d changed jobs and now worked for Channel 4, and just so happened to be working on the advertising for a new show they were developing called
“Much obliged, Harry.” The way Draco said his name sent a fluttery sensation down Harry’s body, the low husky voice promising all sorts of things. “So tell me—” Draco turned to face the street, leaning down and resting his forearms on the railing. Harry took a moment to appreciate the curve of Draco’s arse before shifting to stand beside him, matching his posture. “—why didn’t you enjoy that body shot? Half the blokes in that pub probably would have been thrilled to trade places with you, and the other half would too if they weren’t here with their girlfriends.”
“Given that you just about frightened me to death just now, I’d have to say no.” Harry turned his head to look back over the street and took another sip. He was feeling embarrassed and wrong-footed, yet again, and he wondered if he would ever not look like a prat in front of this man.
There was a breakout of low sibilant sounds peppered from around the room as the members of the client party leaned over to speak to each other in low whispers. The head of the British Kale Growers Association, the BKGA, leaned over a fraction of an inch to listen to something from the young man beside him before nodding brusquely. “Say you
“Okay,” Hermione said, looking relieved. “We’ll see you on Sunday for brunch, yes?”
“And how much, exactly, does that profession earn you?” Harry asked, shifting closer, his nostrils filling with the intoxicating blend of leather and citrus wafting from the man.
Harry groaned, shifting closer to the warm body in front of him. He’d only managed to catch about thirty minutes of sleep before being awoken, yet again, by his demanding erection. They had spent the last four hours fucking in so many configurations that Harry was beginning to lose count.
“Lemme see,” Ron mumbled. Harry tore off the wrapping, to reveal two fancy little pastry sandwiches sitting side by side in the small box. Before they could investigate them any further, though, Hermione stood up.
“Boooo! Draco! You can’t leave!” Pansy cried, her mouth curving down into an exaggerated pout.
“I also work in advertising,” Harry explained, earning a look of surprise from Draco. “In fact, we just launched a big new campaign a few months ago.”
Draco ran his nose down along Harry’s hairline and around to the back of his neck, sinking his teeth into Harry’s muscle as Draco slipped his cock past the tight sphincter and into Harry’s warmth, his passage still sufficiently slippery from the sheer number of lubricated condoms it had welcomed.
“Millie, take care of her, alright?” Draco turned to address the woman sitting closest to them, a dark-haired woman who looked much less thrilled to be there than the rest of the party attendees. Judging by the glass of what looked like ice water in front of her, Harry guessed that she was the designated driver for the evening.
Draco stiffened at the endearment, but then made a visual effort to release the tension in his shoulders as he sighed. “No, I won’t tell Neville, Pans.”
“I rarely use my phone.” He pouted “ it took my awhile to find the perfect emoji I’m feeling right now.”
“They left already.” Blaise says “anyways, y’all better leave because I need to have some alone time.”
“What?” He asks
“Yeah.” Harry pouted after munching his sandwich.
“You’re right.” Draco replies
“It’s been two days guys.” Harry blinks “I’m sure Draco has had enough of me.”
“Nooo, you should attend your classes.” Harry said and leaned his back at the door.
“Sucks.” Neville nods “let’s stick with Iceland.”
They looked at each other eyes.
“Thanks” Harry replied an awkward silence fell on the table until Ron started a new topic about joining a club. He felt quite scared about trying again, a new relationship scared him since the last one didn’t end well. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to again..he doesn’t even know what to do. Draco.Liked.Him. And he knew that he liked him too but it was just..
“I-I well.” She sighs and looks down at their hands “Harry, I’m sorry to tell you but we should break up.. I met this girl and I really like her a lot and-.”
“It’s a stupid reason.” He sighed
“The question is are you okay?” He asked him and Cedric nodded
Thank you for reading! Leave some comments and kudos!
“We’re here!” Harry grins at him after he properly parked the car “I remembered you saying that you never really went to Zoo.”
“Hey.” He wrapped his arms around him and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.
“I just can’t..” he said
“Darling, that fish will bite your whole hand.” Draco states “and we don’t want that from happening.”
“That wasn’t funny, it was more of a cheesy one.” Hermione rolled her eyes
“Did you two fuck?” Blaise questions as they returned to their friends.
“Well, I’m glad to be the first one then.” He smirked “now open it up.”
“Well, that day I wanted to just be with you- you know snog and stuff.” Harry looked away “but then you had to leave.”
“Besides you’re straight.”
Thank God
“I can’t believe you forgot.” He rolled his eyes “The big stockings at the cafeteria are a huge sign that we are nearing the winter break.”
“What fight?” He asked Pansy who just shrugged.
“A bit dizzy but I’m fine.” He stretched his arms “it’s always the same, mate.”
“Sorry I’m late.” Hermione spoke and dropped her bag on the floor. “So what did you tell him Ronald?”
“Yep.” Harry nodded
“Where should we go first?” He pokes Draco’s left arm
(See the end of the chapter for
“Neville invited them.” Luna says and grinned “aren’t you happy harry that you get to hang out with Draco.”
“Your friends are... amusante.” Draco whispered to him and Harry nodded just looking fondly at his friends.
“Okay.” He nodded and he went to his locker, leaving his friends who were deciding where to go. He then got some of his textbooks, he wished he didn’t take the chemistry class it was such a burden.
“No! I’m not a killer.” Harry says “I never really had someone visit my loft.”
“He likes the book you’ve been obsessing for days.” Ginny says and immediately Ron grinned widely then talked to him.
“Anyways you have been ignoring him!” Ron says “Draco looks like a sad puppy it’s been three days I can’t stand seeing him looking like that anymore.”
Draco chuckled and ran his hands on his hair. Harry looked at him confused as to why he reacted that way.
“What is it gin?” He asks and sat down while she just looks at him holding his hands
“Are you okay?” he asks, rubbing his Draco’s hands.
“Mom! You know how ron feels when you spoil him.” Harry said
“Yep, actually my brother knows that’s like his favorite book.” She told him “come on.”
“Don’t worry, Harry.” He smiled and took his hand and held it “I won’t do it again.. so are we there yet?”
“What?!” Harry said horrified but Draco immediately covered his mouth
“Yeah, I wouldn’t go it again.” Harry nodded “I promise.”
I’m really sorry this took so long, I’ll be updating next week~
Harry switched off the engine and went outside his car. He watched the manor and felt quite intimidated to go in. Maybe, I shouldn’t just go in but then Draco was probably waiting for him inside so he locked his car.
Afterwards, Harry immediately went to pick up his hoodie and threw it on the couch and then started to fix his bed. After a few minutes, his bed was fixed and the small living room is now tidy. He could hear Draco humming a song while cooking. Harry was curious so he went next to draco who was focused.
“What’s wrong Harry?” Luna looked at him curiously.
“Ron, no.” Harry laughed when Ron punched his right arm, hard.
“Want more of that, Potter?” Draco breaks their kiss and grinned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jus-just give me.” He pauses and sighed “alright but when?”
Draco smiles back softly “How are you, my darling, today?”
“Almost.” He says and together they walked while holding hands. Harry didn’t even care if people were giving him disgusted looks, he felt comfortable with it and so he will do it.
Ron obviously laughed “Seriously?”
Harry could feel Draco’s disappointment but he just shrugged it off. He quickly gave the taller boy a kiss on the cheek. Draco blushes and looks at him shyly.
“Harry dated your sister?” Luna raised her eyebrows “I’m shocked.”
“What?” Blaise says in a panicked tone “I know nothing-“
It was time for calculus classes and he hurriedly went inside. Thankfully, the professor was late or hopefully not present for he could go to his dorm early and catch a nap before going to the party. After a couple of minutes, the familiar face he had seen entered the room .
Well this is weird, very weird. He held draco’s figurine and found a letter inside.
His face was getting hot as Draco was chuckling at him. “What can I say I’m irresistible.”
“Wanna hang out later?” He asks the boy who stopped writing and looked at him.
Harry simply nodded, a small smile forming on his face while Draco was trying to hold his laughter. Cute Harry looked at him and observed his face reacting when their eyes met. Draco immediately looked away a blush forming on his pale skin.
“That’s it?” Ron asks “mate, why are you suddenly acting like a baby?”
Harry obeyed and looked up at Draco’s light grey eyes. He moves closer to wrap his arms around Draco and presses a kiss against his neck. Draco darts his tongue out to lick his lips and then leans closely to press a soft kiss against his lips. Harry shudders against him and he feels his fingers tighten around his waist as they continued to kiss.
“Al.” Hermione says “they’re classmates.”
“School.” He lies
Malfoy: please, don’t do that.
“Perfect! I haven’t bought some Christmas presents yet.” Neville told them “let’s go.”
“I know.” Hermione smiled proudly “what can I say I just love studying.”
“Yes, we met at the train.” He says
“Good job, Luna.” Ron nodded at her “I think you just convinced Harry to go.”
They continued laughing and teasing Harry who was growing even more redder. Until all of their friends arrived and finally the topic had shifted from Harry being distracted to Holiday plans.
“Your room is a mess.” Draco commented
“Nev, you can’t be serious.” Harry groaned as he watched the boy fall down while approaching his crush.
When he arrived at the school, it was a clean environmental friendly type of school. He didn’t expect much but it surprised him; there were only a few students by the front of the entrance, hanging out and some reading a book. He breathed in the clean air and went in passing over the other students. The hallway was extravagant; it’s design was very modern with a mix of classical touch designs. No wonder his mother chose this school for him.
Harry looks at his boyfriend and sees his left eye twitching.
“You can call me Cedric.” He says “I’m in 8th grade and you are?”
“By the way, my name is Draco.” His voice was a bit raspy, it sounded sexy “and I’m really sorry about doing that.”
And there he was looking beautiful as per usual. He was wearing a black vest underneath it is a plain long white sleeves paired with black slacks. His hair wasn’t gelled instead it was just her usual messy hair which made him look hotter.
“If we weren’t out here. I’d kiss you by now.” Draco whispered softly
“Take it, it’s from Draco.” Harry took the box and it was quite heavy.
Harry: yeah okay
They were at his front door since Draco insisted he wanted to make sure that he really arrived safely at his room. The hallway was quiet and Draco was still there waiting for Harry to open his door.
Ah yes~
“Put your clothes on always.” Hermione coughed and smacked Ron’s right arm. “ stop laughing you git.”
And that’s how they ended up kissing in a Janitor’s closet for a moment. Using the ‘my boyfriend has forgotten something from his classroom’ excuse which he thinks his friends did buy.
After minutes, he spotted them at the corner. Ron was wearing a beanie which is why he didn’t easily saw them. Hermione tied her hair into a pony tail while Luna hair was on braid and Neville was with Blaise who grinned at him.
whenever we eat at the cafeteria.”
“Harry, we need to talk.” Gin had said and grabbed his arms softly then lead him to the bleachers.
Jealousy was not really his forte but he had been jealous before. When he was a child he sometimes despised the stirring feeling in his stomach whenever he saw his crush talking with another person that wasn’t him.
“Yeah.” He replied and immediately thought about Draco.
“Oh, by the way can I have your number?” He said “Since draco wouldn’t give it to me.”
“You know, peacocks aren’t that bad.” Draco started to speak “in fact, I now like them. They’re elegant and beautiful.”
“Ginny, who’s that? Don’t tell me that’s your new boyfriend.” Ron frowned and looked at him like he was about to die.
“I suck at-“ he was interrupted by Malfoy who blurted out balls. They both laughed, they probably looked like crazy guys.
“Harry, I-.” He sighs “it’s my vacant time and.. can I walk with you?”
“Okay.” Draco nods “it’s really lovely to see you here, I didn’t really expect for us to see each other again.”
“Okay.” He nods, he wanted to give him a chance anyways.
“No.” He frowned
“I’ll think about it.” He told him and his best friend and girlfriend arrived with their drinks.
He then wonders why his mom was at his loft. Perhaps, she had only wanted to see him since they haven’t seen each other for a couple of weeks now.
“Yeah.”
“Okay.” Draco mumbles
“Can I have your hoodie?” He asks and looked at him with puppy eyes.
“Oh okay.” He frowned
“Shut up.”
“Harry, please.” He had begged again when Harry decided to cross the street. He was tired of hearing his boyfriend begging him to come out.
Harry knows that he likes Draco but deep down he just doesn’t really accept it. He’s doubting on what will be the result of it. He knows it will gradually change his life both in public (Strangers) and private (parents and friends). Opinions are very powerful and that’s one of the reasons why Harry transferred to another school.
“They don’t have.. a proper hotel.” Blaise states “It sucks.”
After that, they decided to play the claw machine to see if they could get a stuff toy in it. It turns out, Harry really sucked at it but Draco on the other hand had managed to get 6 stuffs toys. Each naming them after a number so that he could easily remember them. The next game they had played was some arrows which surprisingly Harry and Draco was very good at and it had shocked them both. They ended up earning themselves a wand which then they later used to act as wizards when Harry decided to ask someone take a picture of them.
“You wimp.” Draco chuckled “it’s a steel staircase and besides the building looks pretty expensive. I’m sure that the architects build it well to avoid you from falling, Potter.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco rolled back his eyes
They silently walked together, Harry was behind Draco. Suddenly, Draco stopped walking and he stumbled into him.
“Then I’m the one who should be worried about you.” Harry glared at him “how will you go back to school?”
“I didn’t.” He replied “I just kidnapped him here.”
Harry didn’t know what happened next. It happened way too fast. Draco had grabbed his face and pressed his lips into his.
“I’m starving.” Luna coughed “can we go now?”
“Can’t believe you didn’t come up a plan for us to eat.” Draco teased
After a few minutes, as they reached to the top the view from above was beautiful which hit him a wave of calmness as he further watches the city lights and the skies. Draco did the same staying frozen, simply observing, his chest light, Harry decides towards him and kneels in front of him. He then took both of his hands and held it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, right? how are you?” He smiles
“It’s fine, Harry.” He says “you can continue buying while I fix that mess.”
“You know what, Harry.” Ron says “you look so in love when you do that... it reminds me of-“
“Where are the others?” Harry ignored the question. He was still bitter that he didn’t really get what he wanted.
“No, I’m sorry.” Harry replied “I wasn’t focusing.”
Harry: Would you want me to go in?
Harry was furious at the girl but Draco played it cool and refused to take the girls note. I’m gay..sorry the look on the girl’s face was hilarious but still it had made him mad for making a move to his Draco.
Draco is asking him out. Draco liked him and he never knew about it or he did but chose to ignore it. He liked him too a lot but something stirred inside him sometimes when he is with him.
“So, what’s happening with Blaise and Neville?” Harry asks him, changing the subject completely.
“I am.” He looked at his eyes searching for something. Harry turned to his friends who was grinning at him he decided to sit down to an empty seat and automatically Draco sat beside him.
“R-really?” He stutters and he nodded excitedly.
Cliche it may have sounded, thinking too much about it, how can you not forget about a young handsome lad that accidentally touched your hand while on the train. It was quite awkward honestly but Harry wished he could see him again. Just a sight of his messy white-blond hair and pale skin. Damn, even his back was so handsome.
“Potter- I’m sorry.” Draco looked at him he was about to grab his hand but hesitated. So Harry carefully took his hand.
“Fine.” Harry slowly went out from bed and decided to hug Draco from behind, kissing his neck. “I like this.”
“Yeah, we will.” Draco says
Harry followed the girl even thought he didn’t really know him that much. He wasn’t scared if it was one of the stalkers that was obsessed with his mother before.
“Harry!” He felt Cedric pushed him and he fell down. He could hear a bone crushing and when he looked Cedric was underneath the car.
“No, Dear, Not at all.” She quickly answers “I have no problem with you dating a guy.”
“Draco!” Harry yelled and Draco just chuckled until they arrived to the other side of the street.
“You took so long.. just to send that?” Harry stifled a laugh
“Good good.” Ron glances at Harry who was playing with a lose thread on his sweater. “I’m sure it will be fine Harry.”
Harry was nervous, really nervous, Today will be Draco and his first official date. He properly dressed for the day, wearing his newly bought polo shirt and his usual jeans. He also made effort to put on lots of cologne to smell extra good.
Harry: srsly what are you wearing?
“I think he would be busy that time.” Harry stated
“Do you want paparazzi tailing you?” Lily asked him
He opened his bag and brought a medium sized box and gave it to him. Harry stared at it confused.
Harry,
“At least he has the guts to ask the Blaise Zabini to the Halloween party.” Luna said and watched Neville who cleared his throat and spoke to Blaise who smiled at how Neville looked adorable sputtering with his words.
“D-Draco.” He softly said as the boy kissed his jawline and gently sucked it.
“I-I’m sorry your face was just super red.” Ron laughed “you looked like a to-mah-to.”
“It’s okay, it’s the school’s fault.” He mumbles feeling a bit guilty for lying to him as he helped Draco put his groceries inside the basket he was bringing.
“If you want to then I want to.” Harry shrugged
“I don’t want to share my room with someone.” Harry protested
“Anyways, I suck at everything.” He continues “I hope I’ll find my talent soon.”
“Weirdo.”
“He does?” He asks his voice quite excited. “Anyways, I’m here to give you this.”
“So you’re the Harry?” Pansy smirked “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“No, no we didn’t.” Harry denied
“It’s not your fault, my prince.” He spoke slowly and flinched like every time he talked it hurried him “I chose to save you.”
During that day, Cedric was with him. The boy was unusually very touchy with him. He was acting like a clingy girlfriend but he didn’t really mind; he missed him though they hanged out last week.
Malfoy: if you want to come in. It’s okay.
Harry: Malfoy, I’m already nearby your house.
“Why?”
“Just a few minutes and the food will be ready.” He faced Harry.
“Yeah, I should just skip.” He said taking off his glasses massaging the bridge of his nose ”I mean it’s only one classes left for this day.”
“Thank you.” Draco told him and took his hand to give it a squeeze.
“Ah, well my dad is famous for his job.” He shrugs “My mom is a retired singer.”
“Sweetie, I signed you up to this beautiful school. It’s quite far away from here and so much..peaceful.” She said “you love it I promise.”
Harry shifted leaning sideways on the locker. He honestly felt nervous about talking to Malfoy but then he also missed him.
“Hm, maybe I will do that too.” Luna thoughts for a moment then Hermione smacked them both at the back.
“I insist.” Harry looked at his light grey eyes “I’d love to help you and also I’m really sorry we never really got to hang out.”
Harry stayed silent and ignored his friend who was starting to talk about shipping names and who would be the first one to ask out who. He looked at Draco again who smiled at him again. He did a sign if he could come over because it looked like Blaise was very interested in Neville. He signed back that it was okay. When Draco started to walked towards them, his friends started to freak out except for Hermione who immediately calmed herself down. He thought Hermione didn’t like Draco but it turned out she just cared for Harry.
“Besides, I bet they’re looking for us.” Draco was now out of the bed fixing up his shirt and hair.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” He whispered  as he sat down to a chair next to his bed.
“He‘s a douchebag used to play and break everyone’s hearts.” She said while Luna just shook her head, disagreeing.
“Thanks.” He chuckled
As they went out, Harry noticed a familiar face but he shrugged it off. His new friends were talking about how they should attend the party tonight. Harry wasn’t really into parties but he agreed to go as to he had a boring life ever since..
Harry looked down at his hands hesitating if he should take Draco’s. Maybe, later. He looked up and still his person was still studying the map provided by the Zoo.
“Yep, so where are you taking him?” Ron asks
“My manager bought off some pictures from a source and He does look familiar.” She explains “I assume you are together.. you were holding hands.”
“Draco, can’t we just skip it?” Harry pleads “please?”
“That’s.. weird.” Harry furrowed his brows
“Mrs. Malfoy.” He greets and stood alongside with Draco. “I’m Harry Potter, his.. friend.”
“And that was like 2 years ago?” He asks while licking some cream on his spoon.
“You can’t be seriously that scared of peacocks, right?” He questioned
“Stop looking at me like that.” Cedric told him “I might kiss you”
“That’s a relief.” He hugs back “Mom, I have to tell you something..”
“O-oh yeah.” He says “I’m Harry.”
“I’m 15.” The girl replied, wiping her tears while drinking alcohol. “ I know I’m young but I really thought he’d be the one.”
“I agree.” Harry nods “he’s friendly and harmless. I don’t think he is capable of doing that.”
“Look at me then.” Draco pleads
Happy Pride Month
Malfoy: are you texting while driving?!!!??
Harry stared at him, not really knowing how to respond. Draco then walked away while Harry watched him, wondering if they’ll ever meet again.
“Let’s catch up to them first.” Harry used his other hand to point at there friends who was a bit far already.
“Can I bring my phone?” He asks “I wanted to take pictures with you.”
“I know.” He said and Harry went to his couch to lay down. His migraine was fading which was a good sign. He took off his glasses and placed it on the table.
“Mm.” Draco hummed “now let go of me so we could eat proper breakfast, I’m starving.”
“You didn’t throw it.” Ron suspects “you must love wanking to it.”
“You can’t just do that, what if there was an asshole drunk driving and didn’t notice the traffic signal?” Harry explained feeling panicked “I’m sorry it’s just the things I’ve... well read online, stuff happens and it sucks.”
It was fun, so fun.
“Mate, can’t you believe he hasn’t noticed those ridiculous big stockings at the Cafeteria?” Draco beats Harry at explaining “He has been looking at me so much- and I’m really flattered by it but seriously.”
When they reached at the ticket booth for the Ferris wheel. Harry had to let go of Draco’s hand to pay for their tickets. After paying, they went inside to their designated area and sat down.
“Oh, look it’s Harry’s friend going to Blaise.” Ron told them which made Harry looked way too quickly that it hurt his neck.
“Please?” Draco said in a soft voice “also I’m doing the cute eye thing where Pansy told me is a weakness to most human beings.”
“Ced...” he looked away
“Oh?” Harry blushed and bit his lip “you look pretty hot tonight too.”
They ate the dish together on the kitchen bar. Harry almost moaned to how good it was, it’s been weeks since he ate a home cooked meal made by someone. Draco reminded him of his mother, he was sweet and a bit silly. He was talented and knew how to cook; his mother also knew how to cook and he couldn’t wait to let his friend meet his mom. They would probably bond over sharing some recipes and that made him smile.
“I’m a great cook.” Draco smiled proudly “unless you want to cook and I’ll clean your room.”
“You did a pretty good job cleaning up your loft.” Draco pointed at the hoodie he threw on the couch.
Harry frowned “I know, I don’t even know why I did that.”
“I’m gonna go now.” Draco showed him his phone and saw that the Uber was coming.
“No problem.” He grinned at him “I had a lot of fun thanks to you.”
He raised his eyebrows not expecting that at all. He thought Draco was busy but he decided to shrugged it off and Draco gave him a small smile; he continued to walk and Draco was alongside with him.
“You got a dead body in there?” Draco crossed his arm and looked suspicious.
“Yes.” He said, breathless.
“We.. have?”
“How about you two will play organize this thing.” Hermione announces “so end of the discussion. Now, can we buy snacks? I’m starving.”
“I never thought I’d be this lucky.” He spoke softly while draco sat next to him face red
“What did you cooked?” Harry asks
“No!” Harry frowned “I-I guess I was just distracte-“
“I’m sorry about that.” He scratched the back of his head “I just woke up.”
He cared for the boy; he was very sure about that fact. He was overthinking too much about this and Harry knew that he shouldn’t but he couldn’t control his own mind. He felt his migraine worsening.
“So eager.” Draco mumbles as he opened his mouth wide enough to let Harry’s tongue explore it.
“Boyfriend!” Draco waves at him, as per usual he was leaning back against his locker. He waved back and had a dopey smile on his face.
“I’ll find you after, okay?” He promised and Draco looked up and smiled brightly at him.
“You got a problem with me leaving?” Harry said, he felt angry with him for rejecting all his offer today.
“Whoa.” Harry pokes at the glass clearly fascinated by the stone fishes “I want one.”
“It’s no biggie, I only showed you my amazing skills in playing Mario Kart.” Harry shrugged and flexed his muscles which made Draco laugh.
“Yeah, it’s silly.” He laughs lightly “but really I’m sorry for treating you that.”
“You dating my sister before.” Ron continued and smirked at him.
“Harry, why are you frowning?” Blaise raised an eyebrow “didn’t you do anything earlier?”
“I’m good.” He said still a bit surprised “so you’re a student here huh?”
Blaise eyes shined in amusement “you still don’t know.. you’ll see.”
“N-no.” Harry blushed and imagined draco carrying him.
Harry: yeah
“Yes.” She said a bit embarrassed “ I met her on the internet and she’s very interesting.”
“Where’s M- Draco?” He asks as they went in
“I’ll go first!” She says “my name’s Hermione I’ve been in this school since 7th grade.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks curiously
Harry felt his cheeks warmed and he tried to stop smiling since his cheeks are now hurting from doing it too much.
“Luna.” They shook hands, Ron was next and he awkwardly took draco’s hand and lastly Hermione who dealt with it like a professional person that she is.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah yeah.” Harry looked up at him and admired his boyfriend’s light grey eyes.
He grabbed some appropriate clothes and went to the bathroom to change quickly. He really felt embarrassed about what had happened and he isn’t willing for Ron to expose him because he hid things under his couch. He went out to see them talking.
“Please, your dad knows a lot of people.” Harry’s boyfriend said
Looking back at those memories, it was very fun. The parties he had been invited because Cedric was a popular guy. The reputation he had boosted more because they were friends. He had lots of friends that time and people liked him. Ron was always next to him along with his sister who was in 6th grade.
“Draco.” Harry sighs as the topic was brought up again.
“As your friends we are here to help you with your first official date with Draco Malfoy.” Ron started to speak “you haven’t really asked him to be your boyfriend right?”
When he arrived, the store called Joe’s Mart was quite empty there were like 10-15 people including the employees. It was super cold, he wished he wore a hoodie and not a thin black shirt.  He went to get a trolley then headed first to the frozen foods section, since he wanted to get some ice cream. Harry stepped on a slippery tile and almost fell down; thankfully he was caught by a pair of strong arms which was wrapped securely around his waist. His knight in shining armour was none other than Draco himself who gave him a shy smile like he did back then at the train.
“You’re drinking tonight?” Draco frowned a bit
“It was 9th grade.” Neville shrugs “But I think he’s changed it’s been years.”
“I really enjoyed today.” Draco said “it’s the most fun I’ve had for awhile.. thank you, Harry .”
“I never knew that.” Harry looked back at him
“You met someone?” Ron wiggles his eyebrows
Later that afternoon they went out to have An impromptu dinner on a pizzeria since Draco was craving for cheese pizza and fries.
“We’ll see.” Draco challenges her “maybe I could beat you this time.”
“You okay, buddy?” Cedric turned his head to him. He was such a handsome man, with chiseled features and grey eyes.
Harry raises his eyebrows “not really.. uh why are you here?”
“No, not really.” Draco took out his phone from his pocket and placed at the back of the car “No phones?”
“Shush.” Draco continues “it’s gross I know but she was telling you that because you look pretty hot tonight and she would love to fuck you, Harry.”
“You’re now my best friend.” Ron told him and Harry just laughed.
“No.” He instantly shakes his head “I’m now a big b-“
It didn’t last long, three months of dating Harry had admitted to himself that he wouldn’t ever tell other people about their relationship. He was afraid of other people’s reaction especially with the paparazzi  who seemed to be following him again.
Ron who was beside him laughing while Hermione just smacked his side which stopped him from laughing.
“Yeah, okay.” He gave him a small smile and he watched him go to the cashiers.
“Oh my bad I haven’t really formally introduced myself to your friends.” Draco frowned and reached out his hand first to Luna. “I’m Draco Malfoy.”
The boy looked around until he saw him. They looked at each other eyes and there was a hint of familiarity between how draco looked at him. He was smiling as he walked towards his table then sat to an empty chair next to him.
“You know what this feels like a date.” Cedric chuckled
“Okay.” Draco says and left to order food for them.
“I’m Neville.” The boy said “you can call me Nev.”
Draco’s eyes darkened and he held his breath. He bit his lower lip it may have seemed he was nervous and was about to cry.
“Maybe, I could teach you some recipes someday.” Draco offered “my mom taught me how to cook when I was kid so ever since then I’ve been learning how to.”
“I’m glad.” Draco said and grabbed a snack which was behind him. “So who are you with?”
“Ditto.” Luna shrugs “or maybe we could go to Antarctica?”
He ate a pizza and decided to drink some of Rum Coke and whiskey. His friends were a bit tipsy except for Neville who seemed to disappear. Ron was laughing at a joke Luna had cracked which wasn’t that funny at all.
He went out and walked towards the school, it was only 4 blocks away from his dormitory. His best friend, Ron was still sleeping in the other dorm. Harry didn’t really like sharing his room. He never did, he was used to be alone most of the times. He was an only child which explains it and this sometimes saddens him, he wished he had a brother or a sister to hang out with, like all other siblings did.
Draco lives a bit far from the school.
“Why’d you transferred?” He asks
“Yep.” Ron nodded in agreement
“I’ve always liked you.” He moved close to him and Cedric placed his hand on Harry’s right cheek. “Ever since I saw you, newbie.”
“None taken.” Draco shrugs “As long as my boyfriend will always be distracted by my physique.”
“Just like you.” He looked at Draco who was walking alongside with him.
Harry was kidnapped by Ron, his ginger haired  best friend was now looking at him with a blank face. He felt nervous for some reasons so he decided to open his mouth but was stopped by Ron who had shushed him. A few minutes had passed and he felt uncomfortable with Ron talking to himself. He suddenly thought that maybe he figured out that he had a relationship with cedric before.
“It’s just he refused something I wanted.” Harry frowned
At the corner, Draco was talking with a brunette girl who seemed to enjoy to whatever they were talking. Harry felt a bit jealous but he had no right to be. He clenched his jaw and finished his whiskey making his throat burn.
“Alright.” They continued to eat the delicious food.
Two weeks has passed and things were getting intense with the school works. It stressed him a lot and occasionally had to take pain relievers because he had migraines. It was also two weeks since he had properly talked to Draco. They only talked during calculus classes which involves with headaches and lots of calculations. They talked but it was strictly about the subject or any school related topics.
“You’re welcome.” He blushes then Draco lets go of his hand. He was about to walk away when Harry called for him.
“Mon nom est Draco Malfoy.” He nods, Draco looked at him worriedly like his name was something he should fear but he knew nothing. But again he never was into social medias.
Oh, so that’s why..
Harry scratches the back of his neck “I honestly haven’t noticed.”
The Ferris wheel started to move slowly. Harry could feel they were ascending. He plans to ask him out when they reach into the top.
Draco squeezed his hand “why did you ignore..me?”
“Oh okay.” He nods in understanding “if you really like her then you should yeah.”
“What?”
“Oh.” Harry nodded, he remember meeting Pansy at the party but he didn’t recall seeing Blaise on that party.
Draco. Draco. Draco. Draco.
“Why???”
“Obviously.” Draco snickered “I’ve never seen you around here, are you perhaps a new student?”
“You smell really good today.” Cedric had told him
“I’ve been suspecting it for days.” Hermione says and crossed her arms “there’s something about the way they look at each other
“We were supposed to eat remember but we decided to skip it.” Harry rolled his eyes and took a huge bite of his burger.
“Sure, Harry.” Ron chuckles
“Unless, you two will..” Ron says feeling a bit suspicious.
Harry knew Draco would be much more than a friend for him. He reminded him of his old lover before; he then took out his phone to text Draco but then realized he never really used his phone. He groaned and stared at his figurine.
“I also heard.” Neville spoke softly and everyone looked at him.
Harry started to tell her about his secret relationship with Cedric in to which brought his mother to tears because she didn’t want him to feel like that.
“Okay.” Draco nodded and they started to walk “so?”
“Yours too, Potter.” Draco smiled again “your last name is quite familiar..”
“I don’t want to.” He had said and looked away
“You bet without including me?” Ron gasped
“Oh right! I forgot that Antarctica is remote.” Luna nods “Iceland it is.”
“Okay.” He nodded “let’s go.”
“I don’t know how to explain it.” Ron chuckles “but Luna told me that she ships you with Draco so we just went along with it.”
“They’d look cute together.” Luna said excitedly like her dreams was coming true “and yes I do agree, Mione.”
“Hi.” Harry softly said and was looking at Draco.
The air was becoming heavier and constricted as they were moving closer there bodies were pressed towards each other. Draco had shoved him roughly against the concrete wall, kissing him like they haven’t done it for years. Harry reacted of course instantly, moaning into the kiss and letting his boyfriend’s tongue explore his mouth.
“Yeah.” He took his hand and their hands intertwined.
“Yep.” Harry winked at him “you’re too irresistible.”
“True but it’s like 3 weeks away.” Hermione says “you should take him out on a date this Friday.”
“Yes.” He said out of breath as he wraps his arms around Draco’s neck and pulled him in to capture his wet lips.
Instead, hermione arrived to Ron’s loft with a smile plastered on her face. He felt even more confused as to why this was happening. Maybe, they did kill somebody and they needed his help to hide the body or something.
Malfoy: why are you still replying??
“If you keep doing this I’ll die.” Harry honestly said, he was running out of breath.
“N-no.” He says immediately which made Draco laugh “I’ll do the cleaning and you do the cooking.”
“I’m Harry.” He introduces himself formally and talked to them about his hobbies and immediately he found out that Luna had the same hobbies with him. Hermione was like a mother, she was wise and very caring about his studies and him. While Neville was quite shy they shared some interests.
“I bet you do.” He felt Draco smiled at him “ you look more muscly than I am.”
“Hm, a family of talents.” his voice rasped “what’s your talent?”
“Game on.” Hermione said and Draco glared at her.
“Are you challenging me right now?” Harry could feel Draco smiling widely at him
“Who told you?” Ron asks
“Ye- no!” He protested “School stuffs.”
“Just you ?”
“Ahem.” A woman to which he assumes is Draco’s mother interrupted them.
“Iceland?” Neville suggests “My family and I went there last year and it was a blast.”
Cedric got a bit distant to him, he was now in 10th grade and he’s always busy with hanging out with his other friends and partying. He was a bad influence to Harry because he always managed to convince him to do those things. Harry got drunk one night and had to stay overnight to Cedric who was very fine with the idea. But the next day he got grounded for being too drunk to go home by his father.
He rang the doorbell once and waited for anyone to open the door. After a minute, he was greeted by a butler who greeted him by his last name.
He nods “Good because I’m dating with Draco Malfoy.”
Malfoy: oh okay
“Is it really okay for you?” Draco asks
“I won’t!” He argues
“Wasn’t taken to the zoo and also here.” He sighs “it’s like I didn’t have a proper childhood.”
“Harry, what do you mean?” Mione asks “did you fight?”
Malfoy: Okay
“I know.” He sighs and went back to lay his back on the chair. “Wouldn’t you want to give it a try? with me.”
He tastes so good.
“Ron.” He called for his best friend who immediately told him to come. He went and they all greeted him.
“Hm, nah.” Harry chuckles
“Blaise agreed to go out with me to the party” Neville  announced and they cheered for him.
“You’re welcome!”
“Ah, newbie.” He says “I can show you around.”
“I don’t know..I’ve never.” He stopped himself and sighed “I like you as a friend, ced.”
“I-I’m not!” Harry looked away and felt his cheeks reddened.
“Where are you guys? I’m outside.” Harry called Ron who was laughing and replied that they were inside the pub. Harry sighed he didn’t know why he was nervous he brought his ID with him. He went at the entrance of the pub and it was quite crowded. He couldn’t see his friends anywhere but he decided to walk furthermore.
“We just met after all. You don’t know me and I don’t know you.” Draco says “But I’d like to get to know you, you seem like that good type of person.”
“I- I’m in love with you,” Harry says. He says it so simply, so easily, without any hesitation, that he feels his heart swell and his throat constrict.
Harry sighed “If I’ll give one clue you will figure it out immediately!”
“I have no idea.”
“We ‘ship’ you.”
“Harry!” He recognised that voice, it was Draco’s voice. He immediately turned around and saw draco running towards him. “I saw you leave.. you looked fine..shit.”
He never thought being an 11th grader was pretty boring. Him and his best friend got transferred to a school that his mother picked out for them; she says it’s one of the low-key prestigious schools in this big city.
During 8th grade, Harry went to his rebellious phase which made him quite a bit disgrace to his family. He was always on the social media trending because during that time his mother was still working as an actress. He was always the paparazzi’s topic and he gained the reputation he always have hated now. Wherever he went they were always following him and he kinda liked it .
“Yeah, maybe.” He stopped walking and face him “you seem like a..a bit of an asshole for me.”
“I am and you found me.” Harry giggles with him, this boy was so cute and a funny drunk.
“Oh, so what are you going to do about your baby?” He says and took a sip of his water bottle. “Have you told your parents and him?”
After two years, when him and his friends had finished 10th grade. Harry’s mother had told him he had to transfer another school. Harry was hesitant he didn’t want to leave Cedric alone.
Harry stares up at him with the utmost look of adoration, his eyes soft and mouth turned up in a small sweet smile.
“You’re right.” He gave her a supporting smile “excuse me.”
“Everyone.” His ginger friend said “we really love to see you all being cute and stuff.”
“No, I’m sorry for ignoring you and this right now.” Harry gave him a small smile.
Harry placed his hand on Draco’s back. The boy immediately turned to him with a confused look.
“Besides, I have to...go” Draco hesitated
“I’m Ginny Weasley.” She says “and you are?”
“By moi.” Draco butted in
10th grade was a mess for Harry Potter but he was having a great time with his friends. Ron was with Ginny who was his girlfriend, they were getting some drinks. Cedric his other best friend was beside him, quite drunk that he was looking up the ceiling.
Harry was driving his car when the traffic lights went red. So he decided to text his Draco to remind him that he was already nearby.
“The music is really familiar.” Draco commented
“I’m enjoying this too much.” He could feel his smirk on his skin then he looked up at him “but okay, my prince.”
“What places?” Ron pressed
“We’ll just try it out.” He gave him a reassuring smile.
“He’s like a son to me now so I spoil him too.” She shrugged
“Morning.” Draco said
“Pansy!” Draco’s face got even redder than before, he looked like he was about to burst.
Draco?
“Actually, can you help me out? I’m new in this town and my first time going into this shop.” He lied a bit “I’m a bit lost on where to find some things.”
“This is my stop.” Draco told him
“Not bad, not bad.” Luna giggles a bit
“N-nothing.” Draco looked away and took another bite of his burger. His cheeks were flushed for some reasons.
“Hi, I’m looking for this book.” Harry says “do you know where?”
“So..” Ron said confused about everything “why don’t we just not judge a person before we met them”
“Sorry.” Draco silently said
Immediately, Harry hated the attention and stopped doing obnoxious things and attending to parties. Ron was a bit disappointed but was thankful that his funny face (because he wasn’t photogenic) wasn’t on the internet already.
“So Harry I never thought you’re into boys?” Hermione asked and brought out the gay magazine Ron had bought him last year.
“Hi.” She says and handed his drink. He mumbled a quick thank you and kissed her cheek. He could feel Cedric looking at them but Ron started an odd topic which eased the tension.
“What would you like to order?” Draco asks him after he was done laughing “I haven’t ordered yet.”
“You’re not my boyfriend.” Harry laughed at his friend who was jealous
“So, where would you like to ride first?” Harry asks
“I am.” He giggles and took his hand squeezing it “and you’re here.”
“Well, be my boyfriend then?” Ron shrieked “why don’t you have a crush on me? I’m also good looking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I like you, Ced.” Harry says “but I’m not ready..I’m not even sure-“
“Shut up.” He whispers and kissed Malfoy again and again.
“I’ll be braver next time.. I promise you.”
“It was great.” He went to sit down on the couch as he dropped his bag on the floor. “Tons to do but great.”
He left Draco and went back to Clarissa who was making out with a boy in the couch. He grimaced at the view and decided to leave a snack for her on the table. He then went to look for his friends who was probably at the backyard. After a few minutes of looking for them, he finally saw them eating pizza.
“7th grade.” Harry had told him
“Alright, Draco.” He chuckled, Draco was being a cute boy and Harry loved it.
“Lyonnaise Potatoes.” Draco says “I’m a bit shocked that you didn’t buy frozen meat.”
“I’m proud of you man.” Harry patted his arm and Neville smiled like he just won the lottery.
“I’m just glad.” Harry replies “shall we continue  our date?”
“Yep, git.” Luna says and stick her tongue to him. Ron just pouted looking jealous that Luna was receiving 20 pounds.
“With my friends and this girl who was sitting with me on the living room.” He told him and he nods while opening the chips.
After classes, Harry kept on asking Draco to have lunch with him or just anything so that he could make up the times where he had rejected his offer to hang out. He declined all of them and he was pretty sure now that Draco was kind of avoiding him and he didn’t know why or maybe, he was really an asshole that Hermione described him to be but again they were just friends or were they even? He looked down on his shoes, leaning his back on his locker and sighed. But he deserved it for declining his offers before.
“You know, this is my first time riding a Ferris wheel.” Draco looked at him
“I didn’t know that.” Harry replied and put his hands on his jean pockets.
Malfoy: it’s a surprise *Heart Emoji*
A few hours had passed, Ron was now dragging him to the cafeteria where they were being called by a group of people. They sat down and the curly haired girl immediately beamed and told her other friends to start introducing.
“You’re really good.” Draco grinned down at him.
“Please.” He insisted
“They’ve been best buds since 7th grade.” Hermione says “along with Pansy.”
“I know right.” Harry says “I just can’t pinpoint what song it is.”
The handsome person in front of him was looking curiously at his hand then looked up and met his eyes. He gave him a small shy smile knowing that he has been caught by his act.
“I agree.” Luna said and glared at hermione “why do you dislike him?”
Harry: n...oooo?
What a beautiful face
“It’s not your fault, mummy.” Harry smiles a bit “We’ll just have to hide a bit.”
“It might have worked but I’m driving.” Harry held back his laugh this time, because he knew if he wasn’t driving right now Harry would have looked at him and then he’d be spilling all the details of their date.
“None.” Mione shrugs “I’ve always wanted to visit Iceland.”
“Okay.” Harry said
“Is that gonna be a problem?” Harry looks away feeling a bit anxious.
“Good morning.” He greeted as he sat down
“You will soon.” There was a hint of a seductive tone from the way he had said it. “Wanna dance?”
“You lost?” Cedric asked him
“No, we were just going to buy some holiday presents.” Harry quickly denied
“Thanks, mate.” Blaise thanked him then left.
“Oh dear, do you need someone to carry you to your bed every night?” He asks
“You don’t know that.” He spatted
This chapter is dedicated to the brave people.
“No.” He shakes his head and brought up a random pen “We just went to get this.”
“Ced..” He whispers and looked away “I have a girlfriend.”
“Ravi de vous rencontrer également.” He replied and Harry thought it sounded french. He didn’t speak nor understand french so he just shrugged it off.
“I know, Nev might have mentioned you.” Harry says remembering that Blaise liked Neville.
“Okay.” Draco deflated and looked liked a sad puppy. Harry almost regretted declining his offer.
“Pay up, Mione.” Luna suddenly says while Hermione groaned.
Harry POV
“I just met him. Don’t be stupid.” She rolled his eyes “this is Harry and that is my brother named Ron.”
“What?” He looked at him with a raised eyebrows like he was innocent to what he did.
“Yep.” Ron nods and patted Harry’s head “get well soon, Harry.”
“Harry..?”
“I don’t think he’s ever done that.” Harry stated, he knew he had just met the guy but he was kind, a bit shy as lovely. When drunk he was confident and a funny lad.
Another uncomfortable silence washed over them and they looked away from each other. Draco then cleared his throat which caused him to look at his beautiful face.
Harry never knew he would be like this so attracted to this stranger. Admiring a guy well more likely thirsting over him and being obvious about it. He can even see an old 'Karen' looking at him in disgust like she was about to make a hundred tarpaulins in disagreeing about queer people.
“So, where are you taking me?” Draco asked him, when the traffic lights went red He looked at the white blonde haired boy and mouthed secret
“Good.” He says and put his right arm around Draco’s waist. Harry then leaned in closer to him.  “Cause I really like you too.”
“Are you sure?” He ask again “Is your migraine getting worse? I can tell our teacher about that if that’s if you wanna go home.”
“Here goes your boyfriend, Harry.” Luna grinned at him.
“Be my boyfriend Harry.” He asks and looked at Harry’s green eyes.
They arrived at the lobby and he followed Draco who said goodbye to the security guard and lobbyists. They went outside and Harry almost shivered, it was super cold. He noticed draco who was wearing a shirt and black jeans was shivering. He took off his hoodie and offered it to him.
“We shall.”
“I don’t plan on telling my parents.” She says avoiding the first question “ and it’s too late if I told him, he’d never love me the same.. he’d be forced to because of our baby.”
“That’s not my fault!” protested Harry. Hermione rolled her eyes before she sighed and ducked back under, vanishing the rest of the mess that the unexpected package delivery had made. In all of the hullabaloo, he’d almost forgotten about the package that arrived. Looking around, he saw it laying on the floor behind the bench. Harry waited until Hermione had reappeared, his willy now safe from a misdirected Vanishing Spell, before he bent down behind him and picked up the slightly soggy box.
“What are you going to do with me?” Draco whispered suggestively, tilting his chin up so that their lips just barely touched.
“Are you sure?” Hermione asked again, pointedly ignoring Ron as he nuzzled his nose in the hair behind her ear.
“Now I love Tweaky even more than you.” Harry grinned and Draco gave him a playful smack on the arse as he stepped down into the churning tub.
“Yes, sales are still growing, but the rate of growth is dropping. See?” Hermione pressed a few buttons on her keyboard and the monitor switched over to an Excel window where a line chart showed the upward curve of sales. “The sales are still going up, but if I look at rate of growth, “ she scrolled down to show a new line chart, this one with ending with a small downward curve, “it’s started to decline.”
“What?” Fred asked, potion momentarily forgotten. “I know for a FACT that they work. It took three weeks for the hex burn that Angelina gave me when I told her she looked fat to heal.”
“What about Pansy? Her hen night?” Harry asked, nervousness and excitement roiling around inside of him. This all felt like it was happening so quickly and his brain was frantically trying to catch up with his body.
Slughorn looked up to watch as Seamus poured directly from his bottle of Lethe River Water into his cauldron, not bothering to measure it. “No, no, Mr Finnigan. You must measure out two drops exactly!” Slughorn cried, rushing over to the other table and entirely distracted from Harry and Draco.
The whispered words shot straight through Draco’s cock and it shifted behind the zipper of his trousers. For a moment, he contemplated stripping naked and taking Harry then and there, but he stopped himself. The wait would be worth it and the release that he’d eventually have would be all the more satisfying for it.
Harry cut Hermione off, “Thank you, sir. We’ll do that.” Kingsley gave Hermione an amused look and nodded his head before heading off towards his office. Hermione looked like she was about to protest that there was still too much work to do so Harry decided to forestall her. Circling around to behind Hermione, Harry placed his hands on his shoulders and began steering her out of the conference room and over to their desks. “Call Ron and have him drop the baby off with Molly and then meet us at The Hog’s Head. It’s time for some exercise!”
“Closer than mine, so your place it is.” Before Harry could say anything, Draco had stepped into the street to hail a taxi. Harry was just about to say that cabbies never stopped around here and they’d have more luck if they walked one street east when a taxi pulled over and stopped to pick them up.
Harry was just about to put a spoonful of cereal into his mouth when an owl swooped down and suddenly he had a lap full of milk and soggy Honey Nut Cheeri Owls.
Draco slid his non-wand hand beneath the cloak and shook off Harry’s grasp, bringing it up around to Harry’s back and lifting his shirt. Harry let out a hiss between his teeth as Draco’s snow-chilled fingers rubbed against the bare skin of his lower back, but he didn’t stop Draco’s questing hand. Draco felt the cold snowball bump against the back of his hand and he withdrew his hand from Harry’s warm flesh and grabbed the ball. He ended their kiss and gave Harry a brief, wicked smirk but before Harry could react he smashed the snowball against Harry’s lower back and pushed as much as he could down the back of Harry’s pants.
The silence stretched between them, both men staring the other down, the tension growing, until the corner of Draco’s mouth quirked in a tiny gesture. “Then let’s get out of here.”
Harry chuckled to himself as he walked away, leaving the couple bickering lightly with each other. They did this a lot, but their bickering never held any heat, and Harry always got the impression—though he had no desire to confirm it—that squabbling was their version of foreplay.
“I suppose I did,” Draco agreed. “Wait here and I’ll go get my coat.” Before Harry could say anything, Draco had slipped back inside and the green door was shut in his face. Harry couldn’t stop grinning, nodding at several people as they walked past him down the street and wishing them a good day.
“Hey! I work out!” Harry protested. Well, he had a gym membership anyway. True, it may have been a while since he had actually used it.
“Merlin, I should have asked for this fantasy years ago when I had more vigour,” Draco sighed. “What time is it?”
Sitting up, Draco scowled down at him. “Harry, when did you cast that charm?”
After that, they had collapsed together onto the bed, Harry laying atop the other man and memorizing the feel of every inch where skin met skin. He hadn’t bothered withdrawing his still-hard cock after that fourth time, which meant that he was perfectly situated for the slow, gentle lovemaking of his fifth release.
Harry looked around at the stony faces in the room, their expressions giving away nothing about how his presentation was going over. He smiled inwardly, knowing this next part would be the hook that landed them this account.
Finally, the man spoke, “Is that all, Mr Potter?”
Harry collapsed onto Draco, hissing when his cocked and loaded dick rubbed against Draco’s erection through the thin layers of material. Draco placed a kiss on the top of Harry’s head, breathing in the warm vanilla scent of his shampoo.
“My profession requires elegance, intuition, and sophistication,” the man explained, clearly stating—without actually stating—that he found Harry lacking in all three.
Draco dropped his head and groaned, the sound muted by the soft fur and the padding filling the giant teddy bear. When Harry had insisted on winning the over over-sized prize at the Muggle carnival they’d gone to tonight, Draco had stood impatiently, arms crossed in front of his chest and toe tapping as his boyfriend had dropped what must have been half his Gringotts vault on the silly ring toss game. Draco had needled him for his ridiculousness the entire way home, but it wasn’t until the door had closed behind them and a familiar twinkle had shone out of Harry’s eyes that Draco had suspected there was more to Harry’s attachment to the bear than he’d first thought. Clothes had been banished with a hastily cast spell and Draco had soon lost track of how long they’d been here, his body stretched between the soft pillow of the bear and the hard pounding body behind him.
“How are you coming along, Mr Potter?” Slughorn asked as he sidled up to their table.
“You’ve missed a spot. Just there,” Harry offered, pointing to Draco’s right cheek where there was still a streak of red lipstick smeared across the sharp cheekbone and making it appear as if Draco had broken out in an appealing blush.
At the words, the other man groaned, the reverberations travelling up Harry’s cock and his eyes rolled back in his head at the sensation.
The couple stood in front of them while he and his companion for the night stood toward the back corner of the elevator. Harry looked over to see a confident glow on the other man’s face as he shifted closer, letting Harry’s hand graze against the soft fabric of his trousers over one pert arse cheek. Harry gladly accepted the invitation, casting a furtive look at their fellow occupants to make sure they didn’t notice anything strange as he spread his palm and let it wander over that perfect curve of flesh. Feeling a rush of exhilaration at his boldness, Harry let his fingers curve down into the crevice, pulling the fabric taut as he pushed deeper. Harry felt an answering call in his own cock, a fresh spurt of warm precome painting the skin of his stomach before sliding down around his head, as his finger brushed against a round, flat object.
Draco seized his opportunity and tackled Harry’s invisible body, taking him down to the ground and wrestling with him, trying to pin his hands to the ground and give himself the advantage.
“Really?” Hermione asked, her voice rising in excitement.
“How did you do that? Cabbies never stop here,” Harry said, amazed. Draco pulled open the back door of the cab and held it open for Harry.
“Of course I’m serious, ‘Mione. No thanks, keep the change.”
Harry was intentionally vague, waiting for them to take the bait. He didn’t have to wait long. A woman at the other end of the table, who was sitting beside Hermione, leaned forward in her chair, hands clasped together and she leaned on the glass-topped table. “Who were you thinking?”
They arrived just in time to drop their books onto their respective workbenches when Slughorn stepped into the classroom from his office and called the class to attention. Which was ideal for Harry because Draco was deprived of enough time to sling even a single insult in Harry’s direction.
Ron’s face split in a wide grin and he said, “I never turn down a free drink,” which earned him a swat to the chest and chastisement from his wife.
“Here’s a mock-up of a potential skyscraper ad we would run online. Depending on the final details of the agreement with Channel 4, we can coordinate print, digital and TV spots. We can even include enhanced television spots that will allow the consumer to click on a link directly within the ad to take them to the recipe that Ramsay featured.
“Is that so? Well, as they say, fools rush in, so we will need some time to consider your proposal.” Harry nodded, giving the intimidating man a terse, close-mouthed smile. “You will hear back from us next Friday.”
“Good boy. Daddy’s not going to give you a cock ring to help you with that, so you’re going to have to be a very good boy and control yourself.” Harry bit his lip nervously as he panted softly. “If you’re a good boy for Daddy, I’ll take you home after and give you a nice reward. How does that sound?”
“His come is going to be painted all over that fancy suit of yours if I have anything to say about it,” the man threatened as his head finally slipped past the boundary and into Harry’s slick heat. Harry moaned at the penetration and Draco smiled down at him.
Malfoy shrugged and continued chewing the last Reversaroon. Harry contemplated warning Malfoy about what had happened, but he was worried that people would think he’d done it on purpose. After all, it was widely known that he and Malfoy didn’t exactly get along. He was sure that more than one person in this school would happily lay down bets that Harry had done it on purpose just to get a break from Malfoy’s sharp tongue.
Harry cast another nervous look over at the man and was greeted with a raised drink before the man took a slow sip of his glass of what looked like whiskey on the rocks. He stared intently at Harry but didn’t seem inclined to step in. Harry wasn’t quite sure why he wanted this stranger to come to his rescue anyway—they’d barely said more than a dozen words to one another.
The Healer turned towards Draco and inspected him for a few moments before shaking her head. “I can’t say the same for you.”
“Those are mine! I never said you could have those!” Harry hissed, grabbing the box and finding that both of the treats were now gone. He watched Malfoy nervously, trying to gauge the other wizard’s reaction when he realised that he had been inadvertently dosed.
I apologize for this one. I find this prompt hilarious though.
Harry groaned again and didn’t move for a minute and Draco wondered if Harry was going to fall asleep right here, but then he finally sat up and slipped on the jeans and sweater that he had worn to the club. Draco stood up, adjusting his eager erection before holding his arm out for Harry, who cuddled into his side, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
“Sorry, Hermione. What were you saying?”
“A pint would definitely hit the spot,” Draco agreed.
“Who’s it from?” Ron asked through a mouthful of pastry.
Grinning, Harry reached up and shook Draco’s hand. A second later Draco yanked on his hand and pulled a stumbling Harry in toward him, his other hand snaking up and running through the short hairs at the base of Harry’s skull.
Harry grinned at his best friend as he leaned back and looked up at the building. It was a white brick, three-storey building. The unit that Harry was interested in was midway down the street, sandwiched between two others. Across the street was a private, gated park which was a sure sign that the price tag for this particular piece of real estate was far beyond Harry’s salary. The door for number 5 was painted a deep pine green colour and above it was an elaborate array of windows which resembled a spread-out peacock’s tail.
Turning back to Harry, she said, “I know a counterspell that should do the trick and then you and your husband can get back to your celebration. How does that sound?”
“Of course. I’ll make sure to bring three bottles of champagne this time.” Last time they’d gotten together for brunch, the mimosas had run dry far too quickly.
“Damn...that was amazing,” Draco panted, resting his forehead against Harry’s shoulder as he tried to catch his breath, small ripples of ejaculate still shooting out of his cock as he came down from his high.
“Aren’t hen nights generally, you know, women-only?” Harry asked as he used the napkin he’d been given with his drink to wipe off his own cheek.
After Married-and-in-the-Closet came a great bear of a man who was the first of the men to give Harry’s cock some attention, bending over the bed and pulling Harry’s cock back to suck on it until Harry began whimpering with the need to come. Shifting up, Draco watched as the man ate Harry’s arse, extending his tongue out to slip inside the tight ring of muscle. Draco felt his own cock leak in reaction as Harry began fucking himself back against the man’s face, trying to get that thick tongue deeper. The large man had then fucked Harry with surprising tenderness, lavishing plenty of praise on how sweet Harry was and how hot his hole was until, after about half an hour, the man gave three deep, hard thrusts of his cock and spilt.
“You’re so beautiful, baby,” Draco whispered. “Just this one more cock and then we can go home and you can come.”
After Surfer Dude, there was a nervous-looking man with a dad-bod who was, given the tell-tale tan line on his finger, clearly married.
Ron nudged Harry with his elbow, wagging his eyebrows in a comical, suggestive way. Harry snorted. “Believe me, neither did I. I’m still not entirely sure how it happened. One thing I was standing here trying to order us our pints and the next thing I knew I was in the middle of a bridal bacchanalia.”
“Shit!” he shouted before he could think the better of it.
Draco stopped walking and whirled around to face Harry. Holding up his hand in greeting, he said, “Draco Malfoy, pleased to make your acquaintance.”
“Yes, I understand that, but unfortunately people aren’t always rational about things like this,” Hermione said.
Harry struggled to get a hold on himself. He’d spent months wondering about who this man was and wishing he had a way to contact him, and now, here he was, delivered straight to Harry’s doorstep. Well, technically Harry had delivered himself to Draco’s doorstep, but no point quibbling over the minutiae.
Draco fought back an eye-roll at the man’s chummy disposition and focused on Harry, who was now breathing in short, panting breaths as the stranger crawled up onto the bed behind him and rolled on a condom before spitting on Harry’s hole.
“What I was going to say is that I’m the flourish,” Harry said, accompanying the pronouncement with a flick of his wrist.
“Yes, I’d pieced that together,” Harry said, trying to be polite, but his eyes shot over to Draco when he snorted at Harry’s remark and the two shared a knowing look before Pansy continued speaking, completely oblivious to them.
“Don’t worry. I’ll get her home safe,” Millie promised.
“You did so good, baby,” Draco cooed, just loud enough for Harry to hear, the other man grinning happily at the well-earned praise.
“Baccha?—you spend too much time with my wife. You’re becoming just as confounding as she is! Anyway, I came over to tell you that we’re going to head out. Hermione’s...ready to blow off some steam, if you know what I mean.”
His second had been while buried deep inside the tight, hot channel as the other man had bounced energetically up and down on Harry’s cock.
That head turned and the jawline was so sharp that Harry thought it could cut him if he gave in to the temptation to reach out and slide his fingertips along it. His eyes followed a path down Harry’s body, taking him in from head to toe before his lips thinned and he turned away, giving Harry his profile once more. “More than you can afford.”
Harry shifted forward carefully, not letting any of the shiny condom wrappers slide off from where they were resting on his lower back for easy access, and they kissed gently. Their lips brushed together, but Draco didn’t push for more—this kiss was an affirmation, not a claiming; they both knew they belonged to each other.
“Why don’t you two take the rest of the afternoon off?”
“How about we go grab a pint instead?” Harry proposed, laughing.
Draco cast a nervous glance behind him and then stepped outside, pulling the door closed behind him. “I know that I’m a fantastic lay, but it’s inappropriate to track someone down to their place of employment like this, Harry.”
Harry turned back around when the yanking pull on his arm finally ceased and he found himself face-to-face with the bride, who was definitely blushing, but that was more than likely because of the alcohol they’d been consuming.
With a wicked grin that went unseen by his gorgeous companion, Harry reached up and pulled the other man’s cock between his legs so that he could suck teasingly on the head before lavishing the same attention on each of the man’s testicles. When Harry heard the sinfully erotic sounds coming out of the man, he pulled back, returning to play with the sparkly toy.
Harry wasn’t sure how he was going to be able to wait a week before finding out whether they’d managed to land the account, but he pushed down his insecurity and smiled at each of the Growers board members as they came by to shake hands with him before leaving the room. The last to leave was Severus Snape, who gripped Harry’s outstretched hand in a dominating grip paired with a curt nod before turning and blowing out of the room. The third of September felt a million years away.
“Alright, but come find me later, ‘kay?” Pansy pulled Draco’s head down once more, placing another bright kiss on his cheek, the other one this time. “You can buy us another round of shots!” Turning to Harry, she said, “Draco will buy you a shot too!” Then she waved and spun around, staggering towards the patio door and back into the pub.
Harry was pretty confident that, with the help of the Half-Blood Prince, he would be able to brew the potion with relative ease, but on the other hand, he definitely didn’t want a never-ending nosebleed. He stood up and looked down at the big wet spot on his robe. “Could you at least help me out with this?”
“That answers that mystery,” Harry said, laughing as he pulled out his mobile, which was ringing yet again. “Yeah, hi Hermione. No, everything’s fine. I just ran into an old friend. I’ll tell you all about it later. I might be a little late with your salad though; he’s going to take me out for lunch. Okay, bye.”
Harry felt a little uncomfortable using such harsh words, but it was all a part of the fantasy, and from the gasping inhale and the way the other man’s hand sped up, they landed on the mark. “I’m going to get my money’s worth and fuck every inch of your body,” Harry groaned out, digging his nails in as he thrust their bodies together. “Going to cover you in my come.”
For the first time since he’d begun this presentation, the potential clients seemed truly excited. Harry couldn’t blame them; when he’d first been handed this pitch, he’d thought it was going to be impossible to come up with a way to advertise something as drab as kale. He’d fretted over it for days, inspiration remaining persistently elusive until lightning had finally struck when he’d run into an old boyfriend.
“He told me to tell you that if you ever find them, you should bring your bollocks over there with you to talk to him in person. And that you should be sure to bring your wallet with you,” the bartender relayed the provocative message to Harry, looking amused. Behind him, the smirking blond held the drink Harry had bought him up with a challenging look.
Harry let out a low groan and then crashed his lips down on Draco’s, his hot tongue sweeping in to stroke against Draco’s. It took all of Draco’s concentration to focus on directing the snowball to slip unseen beneath the cloak.
“Yeah, I know all of that and it’s all fine with me. From what I hear though, this little cockslut hasn’t come yet, and that’s going to end with me.”
“So that’s ‘Pans’?” Harry asked, still trying to wrap his head around the confusing encounter. Draco snorted as he began wiping away the lipstick marks on his cheeks.
The courtroom broke into a flurry of whispers as the verdict was read out by the Chief Warlock, and he would be deluding himself if he thought the overall tone was one of sadness.
They paused and waited for a reaction from Mr Snape, but he merely watched them expectantly, the nail clacking away the only sound in the room. After a few moments, he asked, “So there are three people conspiring against our organization’s interest, then?”
“Yes?” Hermione asked, standing up and crossing her arms in front of her chest while drilling Harry with an expectant look. “You’re not honestly going to try to claim you’re the brawn, are you?” Her gaze trailed meaningfully over Harry’s torso before returning to his face.
that it would work. He tipped his chin up, marshalling up the stray strands of confidence that had begun to leech away. “This campaign will make kale just as vital as lettuce. You’d be a fool not to sign on with Media Magic.”
“I have seen those ads, actually. That was a really good campaign,” Draco said, uncrossing his arms and lifting one to lean against the frame of the door. “In fact, I owe you one, because it helped land us a new account.”
Harry slid his underpants back off and stepped into the shower. When Draco gave him a confused look, Harry shrugged and grinned. “May as well take advantage of it while we can.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and lifted him up against him, encouraging Harry to wrap his legs around his waist as he began walking in the direction of the bathroom. “Tweaky will have drawn us up a nice hot bath by now,” Draco said, smiling against Harry’s mouth.
“We have all night,” he said as he admired the teeth marks he’d just placed on the previously unblemished expanse of smooth arse. It was equal parts promise and threat.
Harry’s breath hitched as the man’s fucks sped up, his cock pistoning in and out of Harry’s arse and forcing sexy little whimpers from Harry on each push. The whimpers seemed to be getting to the man and he sped up, the grunting with each swing of his hips and the squelching sounds of lube an erotic melody.
Forcing that thought aside, Harry wound his way through the crowded pub and towards the bar on the far side of the room. There was a crowd of people standing around, vying for the attention of the barkeep who, as Harry watched, tossed a bottle of clear alcohol in the air in an impressive spin before catching it upside down and running it across a line of shot glasses that were arranged on the bar. A rowdy hen do party squealed and clapped at the trick, but all Harry could think was that it was a shame so much booze was being wasted as it spilt over the top and between the shot glasses and left a wet puddle on the bar.
Harry grinned. “It just so happens that Gordon Ramsay is developing not one, but two cooking reality shows that will be airing on the telly in a few months’ time, so his people are going to want to get his face out there to promote them. The fact that kale has long been part of the traditional Scottish diet and Ramsay is Scottish will give the endorsement an air of authenticity.”
As the man crossed over to the bed and eyed Harry’s proffered hole, Draco shared the conditions, “Sucking and fucking him are both fine, but he stays in this position and you have to use a condom, which we have been kind enough to supply.” Draco gestured to the multiple purple foils scattered on Harry’s back. Draco could just make out the small field of goose pimples across Harry’s back that had arisen in anticipation. “And once you’re done, tie off the condom and drop it in this bowl over here.” Draco gestured over to a wide-mouthed porcelain bowl sitting on the table beside him.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “She’s very beautiful, but she just isn’t my type.”
“Umm… sure,” Harry agreed reluctantly. One shot to be polite and then he could go back and pick up where he left off with the blond.
Hermione gave him a hug goodbye and Ron patted him on the shoulder and then they turned and disappeared into the crowded pub. Harry managed to grab the attention of the bartender much more easily, offering a non-committal confirmation that the body shot had indeed been “awesome”, and ordered his pint. Taking his pint, he beat a hasty retreat as the hen night began to gather volume again and he headed out onto the second-floor patio. Leaning against the rail, he looked down at the people walking along the busy street below as he enjoyed his ale.
Draco crowded Harry against the wall, pushing him in against the layer of squishy loads. “Look at your pretty new trophies.” Draco reached over to squeeze one of the condoms between his fingers, distending it as he slipped his other hand down to slip down Harry’s crease. Harry hissed when Draco’s finger met its mark, the wrinkled rim of flesh puffy and raw from all the friction it had endured over the past few hours. “Are you ready for your reward now?”
Hermione’s stern look lasted for a few more moments and then her features softened and she smiled at him. Lifting her hand, she pointed to the computer screen again. “There’s been a 19% drop in the use of the search terms we’ve been using for targeted advertising.”
. Draco was making no move at all to prepare for their morning full of potion brewing and was lazily spinning a quill around in a circle inside the quill pot in front of him.
The condom stack slowly dwindled as a long string of cocks stepped into the room, used Harry to slake their need, and then left. Draco had only been forced to take action once, when a man had balked at the condition that he had to wear a condom, saying he preferred raw. He had reluctantly agreed to wear a condom, but Draco’s instincts had screamed an alert and he had covertly grabbed the handle of his wand and cast a
