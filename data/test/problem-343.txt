‘Mr. Malfoy.’ Rosier said with a smile, his blue eyes rather charming, ‘Where were you on the night of December 19th?’
Draco nodded; he didn’t have anything else to say to father, so he lied down: ‘If you’ll excuse me… I’m tired.’
‘I actually thought about it. You know. Because it was very public. Leather paddle? One strike for each badge.’
It took a while before the crazy urge subsided, the desire faded to the background, and Draco could feel his arse was almost too painful for him to endure. Potter was right.
Planning a wedding, especially one combining muggle traditions and pureblood traditions, wasn’t exactly easy. Potter and his friends took care of the muggle and casual part, and Draco took Pansy with him to settle the pureblood part. They were cake tasting now, and Draco’s having a hard time deciding whether they should go with lime or green apples for the third layer of the cake.
He was afraid that Potter would humiliate him again by saying something like ‘Begging already, Malfoy?’, but instead, the caning stopped, Potter’s warm hand combed through his hair and cupped his right cheek, brushing away a few tears. The hand was gentle and comforting, as if complimenting him for saying the apology. He couldn’t help but leaned into the touch.
The man took Draco’s still red and swollen arse in his hands, squeezed the warm flesh, and then slipped one finger in Draco’s cleft to check the healing condition: ‘How is it?’
‘Such a slut, Malfoy.’ Potter chuckled darkly, stroking Draco’s furry ears, massaging them, making him whimper, then ran his hand over Draco’s prettily red and hot arse.
Harry looked up just in time to see Malfoy turn the corner, his face pale and emotionless——he’s a bit too thin really, not eating properly these days, despite his appearance being meticulous, not a wrinkle in his clothes, not a hair out of place, he looked delicate to the point of fragile, his platinum fringe and long eyelashes draped over his silver eyes, only a gleam of light could be seen.
The second thing that tipped him off was the mug. Not that it was empty, Garrick seldom had the presence of mind to both take AND fill his tea cups, no what struck him as odd about that was the particular one he had chosen. Garrick, as most old men (and Draco) was a creature of habit and every morning when he chose his empty mug for the day and pretended it to be a big adventure he chose the same damn mug. It had driven Draco up the walls at first. The building suspense as Garrick danced around his array of porcelain, eager to chose the perfect one, The One for the day and the complete let down once he chose the exact same damn mug again.
He was walking behind Harry and from time to time the former would turn around and smile at Draco and Dracos heart would flutter a little every time. Then, after a few minutes Harry came to a stop so abruptly Draco almost ran into him.
“But this much of a change of heart”, Draco shook his head: “My father has never hugged me before, never Harry, and now he’s hugged me two times in the span on half an hour. I am in serious worry over his mental state”.
“But you didn’t”, Potter replied and watched the Mediwizard as he tried removing the fabric from Dracos skin: “Which is almost a shame because then you wouldn’t have been my case and I could have played Legend of Zelda in peace”.
A few minutes passed by without a sound until he heard it, faintly and quietly. Someone was singing.
“Of course I came, darling”, she said and took his hand. Her hand was dry and cold but Draco felt his spirits lift momentarily.
“Solitude gives much time for thought”, Harry said: “He might have thought about his dealings prior to his trial and came out dissatisfied with them”.
“Why yes”, Mr. Burgin said: “He had come in to look at my collection of wands, he bought six of them, he had a great scar on his cheek, right down by his right eye”.
“It’s late”, Harry said and yawned: “I’m going to bed”, he stood up: “The Weaseleys expect us at 1 in the afternoon, so you can sleep in”, Harry said and went over towards the door.
“Good”, Draco said, pleased his father was telling the truth: “We need you to tell us who else was involved”.
Harry smiled: “Yes”, he said and looked at the picture: “They have become my family, the best one I could hope for”.
Harry heard the whispers as soon as his head penetrated the water surface. Some, delirious watchers were cheering and applauding, but most of the onlookers just stared at Harry in disbelief. Harry blushed with anger, well he couldn’t just leave him now, could he?
“I have not had the pleasure”, Martha said with a grim look on her face, apparently her pleasure was very much at bay.
“Oh I know exactly”, Ron stumbled through his words: “You’re obsessed with that Dude, Harry, it needs to stop”.
“We are here to see Lucious Malfoy”, Harry said and nodded, coat wrapped around him against the rain.
Dracos lips quivered: “They are quite small”, he reassured the man in front of him and tried hard to keep his lips from twitching: “I’ll make sure to get you the deluxe kit, those tend to disappear less frequently”.
“Oh nothing”, Harry said and shook his head: “It’s just”, he paused: “It’s been a while since we were happy last”.
“I’m sending for backup”, Potter reassured him: “We’re going to find them”, he outstretched his wand: “Expecto Patronum”, he said and a great silver stag erupted out of his wand: “Request backup”, he told the stag: “Code 360 and 368, at risk individual requiring protection, Olivanders shop, now”. The patronus bolted away.
One of the figures was very obviously sleeping, one could see it in the way his nose was smushed against the back of his hand and the quite audible snoring coming from the right hand side of the room. The other persons face was illuminated by a Gameboy. Draco only knew it was a Gameboy because when he had been 8 he had seen Arthur Blyly take one form a muggle boy in the village. Draco had foolishly asked for one as a gift for his following birthday, which his father obviously and for good reason refused and Draco never spoke of it again.
She flicked her wand and a tray with three cups of tea and a truckload of biscuits appeared in front of them.
“May that be as it is, I find it hard to imagine that a strong bond can be formed when you are being so formal in your addresses”, Harry said slowly.
“Nonsense”, Harry said and chuckled, straightening as to toss away the unhappy thoughts: “You are not intruding”, he said: “I am happy to share this with you”.
“Oh so you are Draco then?”, the woman asked and looked at him for the first time, she smiled a huge smile: “It’s so good to see you again”.
“Yes they did”, Harry laughed: “You need to learn a lot before you have children, Draco”, he shook his head.
Draco was now very much offended: “What do you mean, am I sure? In case you forgot, Potter, I’ve seen the curse used often enough, yes I’m sure. I heard him say the words and I saw the curse hit the wall behind me, he was trying to kill me”, Draco breathed angrily. Did Potter think him a fool?
Draco was surprised by the personal question but thought about it: “She is unwell”, he said finally: “The loss of my father and the memories of the war are gnawing on her”, he said.
“The Weasley, I mean, Ginny, doesn’t really rejoice about me being here”, Draco said: “I’m sorry if I caused you any trouble”.
“Nonsense”, Molly smiled and put a shit ton of glasses next to the bottle: “It’s very thoughtful of you”.
They walked through the garden gate and a small, round woman with red flaming hair waited for them in front of the door.
“Listen”, he said: “I was wondering”, he interrupted himself, not sure where he was going with this.
Draco nodded and turned around. What could be a good fit for the chosen one? He ran through his mental catalogue of wands and was tempted to just start with the ugliest one, a stubby little thing with a greenish shade of wood and a little loop at the end but he was too much of a perfectionist for that. Damn him.
It took all his courage but he reached out one hand and intertwined his fingers with Draco’s. Draco smiled.
“Well with you here I can’t break up with her”, Harry explained: “It will be messy, Ginny doesn’t go down without a fight and we’ll have to figure out where we will live from then on, all that stuff”.
Something furry and soft caressed his ankle and a big smile spread over his lips: “Mary”, he yelled and picked up his cat, she was purring softly.
“I’m sure you didn’t know of its origin”, Harry assured the man: “Don’t fear, we have no interest in investigating the dealings of you buying your products”.
“I have seen him last more than four years ago”, Draco said sadly: “I have not kept in contact with him, he seemed like the wrong crowd to keep around me after my probation started”.
“How are you, Cissy?”, Lucious asked and Draco looked at him in shock, never, NEVER, had he heard his father call his mother by her childhood nickname.
Much more likely was it that Draco had actually forgotten to place the care kit in the bag and Potter had just wanted to be polite upon seeing someone slave away on a hot summer day as it had been. So Draco was okay. Or at least that’s what he told himself every time he looked up at the whistling bell that accompanied a new customer just to look down again, disappointedly when it was just another eleven year old kid in need of a wand for school.
“We’re missing a couple of tools, several knives and gouges, our whole inventory of thestral hair and a bit of wood”, Draco listed.
“We’re not that perfect”, Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes with his hands: “We fight a lot”, he shook his head: “I shouldn’t even be telling you this, only Hermione knows, and if she knows so does Ron probably, but we’ve been having troubles for the last couple of months, almost since we moved in here together”.
Harry smiled at him: “There was an incident about fifteen years back”, he explained: “There was an attack on two muggle teenagers, you were cited as a witness where the wand that attacked your son was left behind, do you remember the incident?”.
“He had heard only great things about me though”, Harry said, bewildered. “Yes”, Draco said simply and now it was Harrys turn to blush.
Harry rolled his eyes: “The assailant didn’t have time to seriously harm my companion”, he explained: “But he did lose his wand in the process”, he signed towards the plastic bag on Marthas desk.
“I’ll take a slice”, Longbottom said and held out his plate. That was apparently the signal for the others because, finally, chatter commenced and people walked over to Molly with their plates.
“Wild guess”, Potter said and helped him to his feet: “It was too quiet, the whole night”, he sat Draco down on top of a chair: “Did you see his face?”, he asked.
“I don’t need to let anything out”, Harry chuckled: “I’m okay and so are you”, he shook his head: “I have forgiven you a long time ago Draco, believe me when I say that”, Harry looked at him from the doorway.
“Oh”, he said: “There isn’t much to know”, he thought about it: “They are very close, the family you know”, Harry said.
“That is very good”, Mr. Burgin said: “Tell him he is greatly missed at Burgin and Burkes, when you next see him”.
He turned around and went through the store to the front door. Everything was in shambles where the curses had hit the walls, burnt paper and wand boxes, glass and splinters of wood from the showcasing tables covered the floor. He could see the dust particles dancing through the air in the faint moonlight illuminating the room. Draco, and the assailant for that matter, could count himself lucky that none of the many wands had exploded with the impact of the curse. Wands were rather sensitive about being hit directly by a curse and the explosion would have been enormous. He went outside the front door and looked around. The street was empty and silent again, no sign of the mysterious man that had attacked him.
“Oh of course”, Draco exclaimed and laughed: “Claire, you were two years below me in Hogwarts, weren’t you”.
“And you’re a condescending prick, we make quite the team”, Draco said and stood up, he was ready to go.
“Well”, Harry said, smiling a little: “It was good of me to keep an eye on you or else I couldn’t have testified on your behalf”.
“I assure you that I love my parents deeply”, Draco said, blushing a little: “This merely shows that I respect them enough for common politeness”.
Before he could think about it he reached out and, with his right thumb, brushed away the crumbs in the corner of Malfoys mouth.
Draco wanted to laugh at the request, don’t move, hilarious with a body binding curse on you, utterly hilarious.
Harry smiled at that, a real smile, pleasant and crinkling around his eyes: “That would be nice, thank you”.
“I mean I did defeat Voldemort”, Potter said: “It has to come with some perks”, he grinned: “But I hate the statue”, he admitted and waved his hands around wildly while describing: “I look like I’m fifty and that grin”, he paused: “I look just as evil as Voldemort on that statue, I’ve seen little children cry after they saw that face”, he shook his head: “That’s not right”.
“We”, again he emphasised the word: “Aren’t doing anything, Malfoy”, he had stopped chuckling now: “I’m going to hunt down whoever it is and end this before it even starts”.
Draco got his toothbrush from his luggage, his cat was still sitting inside her cage, looking around warily, meowing confusedly at him as he walked by.
How are you? I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I have gone to visit father this morning and he seems worried about you for you have not visited him for these last three weeks. Is something the matter, are you unwell? I wish not to intrude upon your privacy and only inquire of you to answer me weather I can be of assistance. I would enjoy meeting with you in the near future to show you my flat and talk over a cup of tea if that is convenient for you.
“Ouch”, Potter said, still smiling for some reason, Malfoy was insulting him, Potter was supposed to be angry now: “Message received, you think me a horrendous person, now let me try that wand”.
“Work, of course”, Harry said and pulled a button down over his head as he walked into the kitchen. Draco could see his firm stomach where the shirt was not pulled down all the way. Draco looked away with hot cheeks.
Dracos heart fluttered again, cold it be Harry? But why would he want to see Lucious as well? He deflated immediately.
Harry sat down at his desk and layed a clear plastic bag in front of him: “We start with the wand”, he said: “See if it is registered with the Ministery”.
“I do not know, indeed”, Draco said and shook his head: “But maybe you are right, maybe he will talk to me, though I doubt it”.
“Don’t know really”, Harry said: “Molly and Arthur are still a bit weary and they don’t like unannounced company”.
“Indeed you are not”, Harry admitted and took a huge bite: “But someone out there still is and I don’t know how we might find him”.
For a millisecond the world stopped and Draco blinked slowly to realise what had happened. The next second everything sped up again and he heard a raspy voice yell out: “Stupor”. A red bolt of light crashed into the closet behind his left ear and Draco jumped to the side to hide behind a table.
Draco was blushing again and because he didn’t like himself blushing and because he was sure he would only continue to blush he lay a muffliato over the table when nobody was looking.
Someone with character. He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, someone who wasn’t afraid to tell him when he was being an insufferable bastard.
The door was unlocked for a second time tonight as they ran towards it. Draco didn’t slow down and ran though it: “Garrick”, he yelled and stormed through the storefront, Potter hot on his heels.
‘Last but not least, I want to serve as the reminder of celebration. We don’t just need to be reminded of the loss, and the purpose of remembering was not to dwell in it; we don’t just need to be aware of the danger in the future, and we need not to be afraid of it; we also need to be reminded of what we still have, what we can still get, as the present is the most precious thing that we have. And in the memory of a very dear, very creative friend of mine, to honour his noble act of fighting against injustice and unreasonable, and as a salute to one of the best moments of my own school life, also in the memory of a few other friends that fought with me back then, I would like to remind everyone how colourful life is, and we should celebrate each day we work towards a better future.’
Mother had long accepted Draco was gay——earlier than he was ready to tell her, actually. After the war, all she ever wanted was for him to be safe and happy. If anything, she could tell he was…cold, like a snake left out in the snow, freezing to death bit by bit. She had mentioned carefully once or twice that he should find someone nice for himself, but Draco had been too caught up in his mess with Potter. They never actually talked about being exclusive, but somehow from some point, Potter kept a polite distance from everyone. It’s not just there’s no evidence of him being with anyone else, but there had been this prosecutor, young, handsome, funny and blonde, totally Potter’s type, overtly showed his interest in Potter, but Potter had turned him down. Again it wasn’t something Potter asked of him, but it felt natural, their frequency of sex life was content to Draco, and it felt like too much work to break in with someone else, and…there were a lot of reasons Draco could list, but really, he didn’t want to hurt their delicate balance.
Shaking hard, he moved, trying to get to the position as best as he can, and as soon as he settled, the next strike landed.
‘So that was the amount I decided for you.’ Potter said while he raised the whip, rubbing the rough leather material across Draco’s tender skin, stopping at Draco’s left nipple, grinding at the pink bud, ‘Since you stopped me at one hundred, mouthed off to me after I already warned you once, I hope you enjoy the next fifty strikes with the whip.’
‘Potter is a lot, surprising me constantly, but there’s one thing he’s definitely not——he is not a politician.’ Pansy said as she took a handful of floo powders in her hand, pausing, not caring the powders slipping through her fingers, ‘I don’t think he’s marrying you just because he needs you for his political career.’
Call me a kitten, I’ll show you a kitten. Draco was in a playful mood. He circled his tongue at the head as he would do to a lollipop, licked at its length as he would do to ice cream, sucked at it, trying to take it as deep into his throat as possible a few times then let it slip out, licking at the precome at the tip like a little kitten licking up milk.
He remembered the stairs of the astronomy tower, every step he walked with fright and hesitation, and then there are these stairs now right in front of him. He was walking the most determined, and unrepentant steps of his life.
‘And you take me here because…?’ Draco asked as Harry dealt with the complicated looking locks on the door.
Potter didn’t respond immediately, but looked at Draco, assessed his expression, then demanded: ‘Apologise, thank me and ask for each strike. You can do that for me, pet?’
‘It was a pet project of mine. My friend thought I was crazy, researching and creating such a spell with everything else that’s happening. But I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t get that image out of my head.’ Potter ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, massaging the extra pair of furry ears, ‘You, with these perfectly white ears and tails, would be my perfect pet.’
The way he suddenly switched from an angry imbecile who could barely control himself to this composed but definitely psychotic person, sent the alarms of Draco’s going off like crazy.
He had never seen the man like this before, every bit the composed and controlling Dom, while so heated and rough that he was reminded of the night he lost his virginity to the man. He could tell the man was triggered by something, what, he had no way to know. But seeing the man like this, as if unstoppable hot lava flooding through an invincible iceberg, they were at war but also in harmony, and Draco was incredibly turned on and trembled under his gaze.
Draco raised a vial in front of Neville’s eyes: ‘Pain potion, harmless to the baby. Took me a while.’
Draco didn’t move or speak, so nothing he’s thinking or feeling would be revealed. Frankly, he didn’t know what he was thinking or feeling right now.
This was why Draco didn’t want to go over the security detail by himself. Not all people were understanding when it comes to his past mistakes.
Weasley looked surprised, and Draco was beyond irritated: ‘You not capable of being anything other than surprised Weasley?’
The man was somehow nervous, back to his awkward self again: ‘Er, because that pair is nipple clamps. And that is cock cage. There’s a second layer for crystal anal and urinal plugs.’
All the pain, fear, frustration, grievances feelings of abandonment and loneliness, suddenly just burned with lust ignited by Potter’s words. The fire burned painfully, Draco was eager to please, sobbing at the emptiness and coldness of not being kissed or caressed.
And then Potter’s tongue was at his tail bone, tracing a line down to his abused arsehole, and began licking and sucking at the rosy swollen pucker. It’s definitely the number one thing on Draco’s list of things Potter does that he couldn’t resist. Potter had never done it to him as his Dom before, and what he did now was so different from the dirty way he did it outside of a scene; he’s methodical like everything else he did as a Dom, and it’s not as intense as Draco would have liked it, but coldly teasing, making him sob and whimper, begging for more, for the orgasm he couldn’t get from it, or for the sweet torture to stop.
His body twisted and ached at that name —— everything he’s against, making every cell in his body defiant, and everything he’s ever wanted, making him burn in lust. For whatever reason, he felt tears well up in his eyes, he felt embarrassed at his weakness, blinked, and the light in his eyes wavered, but he didn’t dare to look away.
The two looked like they couldn’t care less about each other right now, Blaise at the peak of his curiosity, smiled as he tilted his head and observed everything about James, Pansy at the verge of her protective mode, narrowed her eyes as she said with her sugar voice: ‘James, is it?’
That sounds promising. Draco’s finger tremble in fear and excitement whenever he thought about the upcoming punishment.
Pureblood. That was probably why Potter chose him as his husband. Pureblood witches and wizards still took up quite a part of the population, and Potter tried to incorporate the magical society rather than tear it apart. Draco had been leading a project authenticating which pureblood ritual was actually magically necessary and which should be abandoned, contributing to the integration process. They couldn’t just abandon old beliefs overnight, and Potter needed someone who’s an insider to help.
The man didn’t answer, just gently stroking Draco’s hair, and Draco was sobbing: ‘Third year. When I found out he was scared of Dementor, I tampered with his game. But he wasn’t afraid. There I was, in the middle of the air, watching him pull out his wand, cast the charm, and the silver stag came straight at me, it looked younger than it was today, but already strong and no less beautiful… and he was souring into the sky, catching the snitch… He was so fearless, so beautiful… ’
‘You are afraid things won’t end well between us. And though I’m going to do everything in my power to earn your trust and make you feel safe, I figured a little cheating wouldn’t hurt anyone —— and I know you want a better proposal which you would never tell me.’
‘Think about it.’ Rosier chanted joyfully, ‘How perfect it was going to be. The beautiful face, perfect body, and the soul of our rational, ruthless Lord.’
‘Draco.’ Potter said, backed away a bit as Draco pushed his wand forward, his eyes shimmering with every word, ‘For what it’s worth, I never lied to you.’
Even Potter raised his brow at that, took the cane slowly, held it in his hand, bending it and swinging it a few times before he walked back up to Draco, rested the cane where he intended to strike a few times before he actually landed it.
The man didn’t say anything about the raging news coverage, but Draco could tell he wasn’t exactly so comfortable with the topic concerning Potter anymore. It’s not like he was suspicious or anything. He did ask about how Draco felt about Potter, when Draco assured him he wasn’t interested, he believed Draco, and never brought it up again. But Draco could feel he felt threatened, and had been extra careful to maintain their relationship.
But not a word from Potter, his face stern and cold as stone. Tears of humiliation welled up in Draco’s eyes, but he couldn’t really put up much of a defence with both his hands bound, and his tears couldn’t move Potter, not even a little. If anything, his earlier defiance had enraged Potter even more. He roughly pulled Draco’s pants down, leaving on the thin and pearly white silk underwear.
He tried to make it lighter and flirty at the last sentence, but failed and said: ‘Really. There’s nothing more to forgive. Everything happened back then… I guess I’m just screwed up like this because now, when I think back about it, I just like you more. Our antagonistic history, you being bratty and juvenile… I just love you more.’
So Draco got into the slip dress and got a taste of wooden ruler —— the kind that’s used by a tailor, the man really had a thing for poetic justice. Just ten strikes on his arse but they were not so easy to take nonetheless. It had the similar bite of the wood paddle Potter used on him earlier, but the ruler's square tip hurts more, so Potter kindly aimed it at Draco’s right arse cheek as his left already sustained the overlap of whip marks. It had Draco moaning and writhing, painted Draco’s arse right back to the pretty red.
‘Only if you make an unbreakable vow to me to let him go and never harm him in any way.’ Potter said.
Draco froze and looked back at Potter; Potter blushed hard, his eyes bright as stars, pinned Draco to where he was standing.
Draco didn’t answer at first, just looked at the fake Forgecount —— something about him made Draco feel unsettled.
It wasn’t a hard slap, but firm, and extremely painful, as Draco’s arse is already thoroughly caned that not much force was needed to cause great pain. He couldn’t help but jumped, cried out and kicked up his legs.
Each time he resumed the position, the cane would come down immediately. Soon he was shaking and crying, unable to stop, terrified of resuming the position, but he forced himself to do just that.
The man was rarely this unconfident, almost shy: ‘I mean… you said you didn’t want to go because they were in love. And they tease you for being single. I can go with you. Would that make it better?’
‘Why are you here.’ Somehow, Potter was at ease, his posture elegant and relaxed, the emerald eyes staring into Draco’s silver eyes through the mirror.
‘What, you can only be cool when you are playing the Saviour?’ Draco teased, ‘Relax, really. I uh, I find it kind of cute.’
He could feel the venom of his own magic and scents filling his canines, could even taste the cold incense——the Alpha inside him was provoked and seduced, went into full drive rising up to the challenge.
The man tilted his head, let the water run through his hand to make sure the temperature was constant, even though he knew his spell was solid: ‘It’s just… I never thought I would consider you being juvenile so cute.’
Also, everyone surrounded Hannah Abbott, as her pregnancy had just begun to show. She had that glow of becoming a mother, but she also panicked about many things. Good thing Draco got paper bags and other things prepared for this kind of emergencies, especially as Neville Longbottom, the new father, was no use at all as he needed paper bag every time his wife did.
‘I would say closer to twenty but, it doesn’t matter.’ Hermione whispered back, ‘Told you you shouldn’t drink so much. We would be back at our place now if you listened to me.’
‘Er, we never got that far.’ The man blushed in embarrassment and said lightly, ‘We um, we don’t share the same interests. She isn’t exactly the type to kneel and call me sir.’
Harry shrugged, and Malfoy looked down as he started cleaning their work station, his faded eyelashes flickering just a little: ‘Because no one will believe me even if I tell anyone?’
Everyone else was looking out for everything else, but the seekers only cared about each other. And this had always been Draco’s favourite time, because that’s when he could get most of Potter’s attention.
Stimulated by his words, the Omega’s balls tightened; he stroke even harder for a while at the arousal, but Harry could tell from the shaking of his hand that the Omega may be outright crying by this point.
‘To tell you I have not just been the owner of a sex dungeon for the past ten years?’ Harry said as he pushed open the door, ‘And something else.’
Draco had bucked his hips a few times, hoping to get his cock down the man’s velvet throat, but the man deliberately avoided that, instead, he pulled Draco’s legs up, parted Draco’s arse cheeks with his thumbs and licked at Draco’s arsehole.
Draco opened his mouth, but apparently he opened his mouth too quickly, because Potter knew what about to come out would be a lie, and warned: ‘Uh-uh, think carefully before you say anything Malfoy, I will know if you are lying, and I will hang you back up for doubled time.’
When Draco finished playing, Potter patted his head, pulled up his zipper and reached to free his belt from Draco’s hand, probably was about to carry Draco to the bathroom. Just to start his usual conversation that pulls Draco out of the sub mindset, he teased lightly: ‘You know, I always thought you had a crush on Cedric in fourth year.’
Draco tried his best not to hiss or squirm, but he was already making a good show for the man, as the man was enjoying his cup of tea on the couch behind him, some parchments he took from the office untouched.
‘Not your fault.’ Draco forced the word out, ‘You did what you thought was the best for your friend, and you saved us. I’m sorry for a lot of things too, back in school. You have been more than understanding about us, so let’s call it even, settle it over dinner or something ——I’m paying.’
Unfortunately, the event started with various tedious speeches from ministry officials, starts with the minister,down the ladder, and then McGonagall.
Bit by bit, Potter started experimenting with Draco what life after their wedding might be like, and Draco just loved him more and more, to the point he would startle awake at night, found Potter soundly asleep next to him, and he would watch for a long time, his heart a bubble floating in moonlight, iridescent and vulnerable.
Ruby stopped, eyed Draco closely; then she smiled: ‘So that’s it… well I should have seen it coming. Here’s my suggestion: you need to figure out what you really think, pretty boy, which is it? You are not good enough for him, or he’s not what you want?’
The arse perched high on the wall shone a snowy white in the cold moonlight; it was of the perfect curve, plump and firm, supported by long, lean thighs and a pair of pale, slender hands gripping at the silver bar above his waist. It had been thoroughly defiled ---- seven times, judging by the red tally lines written on his arse tainted by the fluids of Alphas ejected on it. The pretty little arsehole was fucked bright red and clenching involuntarily, leaking the cum it couldn’t swallow, but his cock, also bright red and pretty, was still hard, his balls tight and swollen, hanging heavily between his pale thighs, evidence of a high-rank Omega in rut, unable to be satisfied by Alphas below his rank.
He said as he carefully cleaned the arse with the handkerchief and cleaning charms till it was flawless again, as if porcelain in the moonlight.
It’s a rather normal response, as Malfoy was…was class A- Alpha, and given their antagonistic history, it’s normal for him to be on guard when approached by Harry. Plus he had always hated Harry’s scents, very vocal about his hate too——scents of Alphas do that to each other, provoking antagonistic response, prone to fight, rather than attract as they would do to the opposite sex.
By now, Draco wasn’t so skeptical about all things she said anymore; he hesitated, then gave in: ‘I had help.’
That hand trembled so hard that Harry almost took pity on the Omega, but it wasn’t stopping Harry anymore, so Harry proceeded, fucking his tongue into the clenching hole, stimulating the inside walls with tender licks or fucking in and out as deep and fast as he could.
‘Yep.’ The man said with a smile, kissed Draco lightly on his cheek and rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco blushed a little.
The man bowed deep before he put the mask back on and pulled Draco away. The door closed slowly behind him, and Draco saw Severus gave him one last look, hopeful and worried, just as a father would look at his daughter before he walks her down the aisle.
Granger stopped him: ‘The court was well aware of the possibility that Mr. Malfoy may have transferred the tracking powder to Mr. Potter, and the court had reason to believe that if that were the case, it was an honest mistake.’
He hadn't been able to sleep without his wand under the pillow, and even so, sleep hadn't welcomed him with its sweet blackness. Unfortunately, his nightmares hadn’t died with Voldemort; if anything, the war added new materials to them. The flashing green lights of the death curse, the unrealistic pain of losing a loved one, and the empty hollowness of having to deal with the ruin that was left behind, froze and burned him over and over again. It wasn't that he was afraid of those dreams, no, but they were burdens threatening to drown him deeper in a sea of grey and nothing. Whenever he woke from one, he found himself staring at his bed curtain till dawn. Since the beginning of the eighth year, he had gone right back to roaming the hallways at night.
‘It’s okay.’ Potter held his face with the hand without the spell, seemingly still unable to move the other hand, ‘My fault, not yours, okay?’
The man’s eyes darkened, his fully erect cock pressing against Draco’s thigh, distracting Draco even more. Draco thought hard, but came up with nothing. The man provided: ‘You were angry with me. I admit that addressing the problem directly with me wouldn’t have done you a lot of good back then, but try that next time. And maybe you shouldn’t take it out on someone else.’
Draco couldn’t very well feel what the feathers of Buckbeak felt like, but the warmth of Potter’s hand against the back of his hand was distinct. He wanted to pull his hand back, but it would seem too abrupt, as it really couldn’t be considered inappropriate, and maybe this was just Potter’s way of making him feel less embarrassed about their mistaken handhold earlier. And, it’s not like they haven’t shaken hands before, and there’s that time Draco took his hand and Potter saved him from the fire, and there’s last time when Potter gave him a hand to get back into the building. Draco didn’t want to hurt Potter’s feelings again. But then again, right now, he had the hand of his crush on the back of his hand.
The belt struck with a crack, landing across both arse cheeks, and Draco groaned regardless of his effort to save face. The belt caused exploding pain on the surface, as well as sending pain deep into the muscles. The second strike landed, and Draco had to bite down on the cuff of his sleeve at the pain. Oh this is going to be difficult to endure.
The man must be tired too, as he hasn’t slept all night, but he told Draco he had something else he needed to take care of, though he would stay till Draco fell asleep. In the darkness of the night, his emerald eyes were glinting softly, and all he was looking at was Draco.
‘Too late.’ Malfoy said, his tone long and flat, ‘Heard he was fucked by half of the school already.’
Potter wasn’t offended, just picked him up as he wished and carried him through the door that appeared on the wall, and they were in the dorm room again. He gently let Draco down on the bed and turned to leave.
Draco just couldn’t stay angry with him whenever he looked so cute and innocent with those pleading puppy eyes. He turned his head and opened the door: ‘Anyway, just go inside.’
But the man enjoyed it, too much really. The bastard even made him spend time in the corner, bending down a little and lift his dress to put his red arse on display, and when he didn’t think Draco’s posture was compromising enough, the deviant bastard plugged Draco with anal hook and bound the hook and Draco’s hands together, forcing Draco to stick out his arse. Not that Draco didn’t enjoy it. The humiliation was a bit annoying, but the man could barely take his eyes off him, and Draco just loves that.
And at that moment, Dumbledore burst out laughing: ‘Severus. You needn’t be so hard on H..him. You of all people should know, he is a man of character. The pathahead of them may have many obstacles, but it’s the path of their choosing, and I believe they have what is needed to conquer them.’
The position suit him well. Even in such a compromising position, Draco managed to look graceful. With his shoulders pulled back, back straight and head bowed, he was as beautiful as the cursed princess swan would be on the starry lake. His proudly erected cock was a bright colour of pink, painting eroticism over the almost holy pure view. The man reached out and combed Draco’s hair, holding the beauty tightly in his hands. .
It took his tortured mind a few moments to realise Rosier never really cared about where Potter was. Grimmauld Place was Potter’s official residence, where he stays on occasions, but it’s also a headquarter for the Aurors, almost like a dormitory for Aurors; it would be suicidal to hit there. And by what Rosier had said, he knew Potter from the dungeon; he knew where Potter was, and knew attacking a giant room of requirement of Potter’s command would be impossible.
He had his fun bossing her around, throwing tantrums whenever he wanted, spitting acerbic words in every sentence. Come to think about it, Elise was one of the few people who would work for Draco the ex-death eater, and the only person who could stand being his assistant for more than three days. Mostly because she grew up in a ghetto, she had to take a student loan to study at Hogwarts, so she couldn’t afford to lose her job.
Draco’s eyes looked up at that, and Rosier smiled: ‘Where did it start, I don’t know, but it’s an inside joke of the Aurors, that Harry was really bad at keeping secrets. Rumour has it he once had a few doubles, but he outed himself as the real Harry when captured. After that, Granger had spells to prevent him from doing that, and it went from there. When he posted your bail, I asked Wizengarmout in Forgecount’s name to install a stricter spell. I knew he would try to tell you who he really is, but every time he provoked the spell, he gets punished, not enough to erase his being like an unbreakable vow would, but enough to unstablise his soul, in preparation for our Lord’s soul to take possession of his body.’
He panted, gasping for air, blinking his sweat away from his eyelashes, fighting for his eyes to focus.
‘Gentlemen!’ Rosier yelled, ‘In case you’ve all forgotten, I’m right here, and I can kill you in a split second, Malfoy.’
Draco’s fingers paused very briefly at that, as he felt his heart was stung by a poisonous bee; a fierce pain shot through his heart, immobilised him for a moment before he forced himself to move.
He had paused when he saw Potter’s name on the testify list, running his fingertip over it in reminiscence.
So many things happened that Draco wouldn’t remember it’s still Christmas, if the man hadn’t given him the dress.
Draco couldn’t help but smiled a little at that, and also, couldn’t help but think, this must be everything Potter had ever wanted, to go back to Hogwarts, the place he felt most like home, and be a teacher, to pass on the legacy of Dumbledore and Lupin.
‘When I saw you, yes. If you don’t like it, it wouldn’t be my name. Write it on a paper, and I would tear it to a million pieces.’ The man said, blushing and looking down at the back of his hand, then back at Draco as if he couldn’t help himself, his eyes honest and dazzled, ‘You look…
Potter briefly stopped, only to walk to his side and firmly place his hand on Draco’s lower back to pin him on the table, and asked teasingly: ‘Whining already, Malfoy?’
‘What…’ Draco widened his eyes, staring as the man threw away the seat cushion and lifted the cushioning charm, leaving only the tall, hardwood chair.
Draco tensed at that, and then he changed the subject: ‘By the way, are you going as his double at the memorial?’
Right now, as the adrenaline faded, Draco was feeling pain in every cell, and it’s hard to stand as it was; he couldn’t even speak. Forgecount picked up on Draco’s pain and cast a mild healing spell.
Potter wasn’t surprised by his hesitation, if anything, he seemed to enjoy Draco’s moment of torment, those green eyes vibrant, glinting with lights of pleasure — the man truly is a sadist. But Draco knew as well as Potter, that he is in a vulnerable position. The punishments were already close to his limits, he couldn’t afford to disobey or delay. In fact, Draco’s sure the only reason Potter hadn’t rushed him was because he was enjoying Draco kneeling on the ground, debating internally whether he should climb on his lap too much.
What the man said burned Draco with want and shame. Indeed Draco was made to swallow his pride for quite a number of times in his life, but it always takes a lot of effort or grave threat to break him. Never would he thought a few simple words from the man would make him almost desperate to prove his worth, to want to kneel before him and beg him to let Draco take his length into his mouth, or please the man anyway possible —— to deserve the attention and reward.
‘Umm… let me see.’ The kidnapper smiled, ‘There are a few mistakes in your words; where do I start? Well first —— our Lord isn’t dead, and I’m going to bring him back.’
Potter didn’t say anything at first; then he answered: ‘For what it’s worth, I forget who we are too whenever I was with you.’
The man studied his face carefully and laughed a little: ‘I see you really picked the right memory. How ironic —— Accio Memory ball.’
One more, and Draco cried out, Potter stopped to stroke his hair, kissed his ear and asked: ‘You want to take a break? Pet? Want me to kiss it better?’
Draco looked around the tiring display of fake smiles and conspicuous luxury, and somehow, he easily found those emerald eyes in the crowd, he didn’t know what he expected to get from doing that, didn’t know who he expected to see behind those emerald eyes, but the moment he saw them, he was calm. They locked with his, bright and dazzling because of alcohol, but Draco could almost see the reflection of himself in it, his own silver eyes cold and lucid like ice and snow.
‘Yes, my Lord.’ Ron said exaggeratingly, bowing down at him, ‘And thank you for your reward, my Lord.’
The sting was only slightly more distinct, but it felt hugely more humiliating, and the crowd had caught up with it, as Draco heard someone gasped: ‘Is Harry… is he
“So we don’t have a name registered to the wand”, she said and came over to them: “But we do have an incident report where the wand was left behind after the attack on two muggle teenagers. The wand was later stolen from evidence Lockup”.
“Father”, Draco said sourly: “I think we both know that you weren’t merely a witness to the attack”.
“Well good on you for not panicking, I presume”, Draco said and raised his eyebrow: “Anyway, MysteryMan will take his time to kill you only after he’s fixed the wand and even with our supplies fixing it wont be an easy feat”, he tried to bring back some reason into this conversation: “And as I’m sure everybody knows by now you are particularly hard to kill”.
They apparated from the front of the building, Harry took Dracos hand and together they landed in front of a public toilet in muggle London.
“She hired someone to retrieve the Elder Wand and break into Ollivanders”, Draco said very fast: “I don’t think she meant for anyone to be hurt or Ollivander to be taken but she is the mastermind behind the whole thing”.
“You can sleep on the couch”, he said and Draco picked up his luggage and his cat to follow him. Weasley huffed and stormed out of the Entrance hall back to her bedroom presumably.
Malfoy grinned at that: “I have a lot, the Houseelves were quite generous”, he began rummaging through the basket: “”I have Baguette and goats cheese and Basil and Olives and ham., I have Avocados and cherries and croissants and chocolate truffles. What do you fancy?”.
They realized it the exact same moment, their heads shot up and their gaze met each others: “Olivander”, they shouted at the same time and ran towards the door.
“Probably not”, Harry said sadly: “But she’s been here”, he said, looking around: “Some of her stuff is missing”.
“Indeed I have”, Mr. Creston said a shocked expression on his face: “And you are investigation it?”.
As if he had heard it Harry asked: “Would you mind taking Teddy for a minute? I really need to go to the loo”. He hadn’t really asked for an answer, he had stood up and lifted the boy from his lap and onto Dracos.
Draco had experienced three of those mornings so far and he had spent weeks getting over each of them, not to mention the cleaning up he had to do every time Garrick decided (on those days it was about four or five times) that all of this wasn’t worth it anymore and he should just go in a home for old people to play Bridge and decompose. Those comments were heavily underlined by an angry throw of boxes and one or the other rather vicious jinx at their shop window. Draco would spend those days hiding himself and any unlucky customer who had wandered in behind thick doors and a Protego so strong it made the air flutter with magic.
“You were borderline obsessive”, Draco said and took another spoonful of porridge: “You were stalking me”.
“Yes very much so”, Draco said struggling against the dry crumbs in his mouth: “Mr. Olivander is a very patient teacher”. That was very much a lie, since Garrick never let a chance pass where he might be justified in screaming at his employee but Draco felt it was no use mentioning that.
And up to that point everything had happened exactly as it was supposed to, Maggie had had the morning shift at the bakery and like every such day (it was Wednesdays through Fridays and the occasional Sunday) she flirted with Draco and because she was pretty and nice to him Draco flirted back, today she had even given him an extra éclair with his croissant free of charge, but not even that had tipped Draco off about this day being a peculiar one.
That’s how he came to know that a Gameboy was illuminating this particular face. And what a face it was.
They walked out of the alley onto a quaintly lit street with orange streetlights illuminating the night.
“Thank you”, Harry said and took a pen and paper from the table. He started to write in a hurry, his handwriting was almost not legible.
“Sure they do”, Potter sighed: “Then the cat comes as well”, he began walking towards the flat. Draco hurried behind him.
Thinking about it he had been rather preoccupied with Potters mouth. What he meant by that of course were Potters words (not his lips, very much not his lips).
“No problem”, Potter answered and bobbed up and down on his toes: “Anytime!”, he paused for a second and his eyes grew wide: “Not that I want you to be attacked again, I hope you’re quite save now, I just meant, that if, you know, you were to be attacked again I’m here to help”, he rambled on and ended abruptly.
“Let me call for a sketch artist this instant”, Harry said and made his way to the door, leaving Draco behind.
Draco looked after him in frustration. What was his problem? Draco had been very nice to him, he found and his customer service was always on point. He even gave him free products something that always earned him a smile and a wave from other customers. And now there was Potter who had come in possibly faking his need for appliances just to see Draco in all his working glory and couldn’t wait to get out again. He stood there confusedly fuming for a good three minutes until it slowly dawned on him that maybe he would do good being frustrated with himself rather than the embarrassed man hurrying down the alley as fast as human feet would carry him.
They ate their breakfast in pleasurable silence then, Harry got distracted by Mary Antointette who made it her mission to steal some of his porridge and Harry laughed happily while fighting her off.
“We must hope he didn’t sell the wand on the black market in the streets, we may never find him then”, Draco said and folded up his box.
“So what do we do now?”, Draco asked eagerly and looked at Potter, he had now completely given up hope the other policeman would ever wake up and contribute to the investigation.
Draco had a speech when he opened the shop the following day. Explaining his lack of manners sufficiently but without sounding too eager to go on said lunch meeting (date) after all. But Potter didn’t come in.
“Alright, alright”, Draco put up his hands in defense: “I’ll brush my teeth and you won’t see me again until tomorrow”.
“Yes, please”, Draco said and stole a peak at his watch, a quarter to nine, he hoped Harry liked to sleep in.
And lonely he was, so very lonely, he didn’t have friends, he didn’t have a family, he only had work and Garrick and even though he enjoyed it that was not enough.
Mr. Burgin sighed and looked around his dusty cabinets: “We have not the best reputation, as you may know, Mr. Malfoy”, he said: “We are struggling, I have to admit, but we make due”.
They could hear muffled shuffling from inside the cell as Dracos father made himself ready to receive visitors.
“I intend to show it around in the less prestigious pubs and inns around”, Harry said and took out his Notepad to write something down: “Someone has to reckognize him”.
He looked at Malfoy then. His hair was in disarray, flying around his forehead in white curls, his cheeks were flushed, lips a little wet still and his robe hat slipped a bit so he could see Malfoys right collarbone poking through. Harry blushed again.
“No”, Draco said sternly and walked towards a semi free chair in front of Potter: “It was committed on me”, he paused: “to me”, he paused again: “Upon me if you so please”.
He sat down on the bed. He was wide awake, replaying this evening in his head, searching for a turn of events that wouldn’t land him here, but no matter what he did inside his mind he always woke up in this cell again.
They walked out the door into a narrow, dark hallway illuminated by torches that gave little light but also little warmth which Draco appreciated, he was frozen to the core. They walked up several flights of slippery stairs until they came to a stop inside yet another narrow hallway.
On a normal day it took him about 7 minutes to reach the shop from his door but tonight it took him less than 2. Draco was sprinting, rather ungraciously as he had to admit but he didn’t care. His robes were fluttering behind him in the airflow, slippers flapping with every step he took and hair in a curly and now slightly sweaty mess. Someone was breaking in. He couldn’t believe it. Never in his life had he thought someone would break into Olivanders shop. He hadn’t thought anyone would dare as the owner had a most peculiar aura about himself and he didn’t put him past booby trapping the whole of the storefront.
The people had started sitting down and Draco spotted some more familiar faces, there were Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan, Oliver Wood was here, so was Neville Longbottom (of course) and Luna Lovegood.
“How good of you”, Harry said and Draco heard something like pride in his voice, he blushed again and hoped Harry would credit it to the chilly wind on the sea.
It was silent for a second. Then two. Then three. They were just standing there. Four. Five. Looking at each other with wondering expressions on their faces. Six. Seven. Draco had to say something, it was getting uncomfortable. Eight. Anything really, but he had to stop staring down at the man. Nine. Ten.
Hermione came over and saved him, talking a mile a minute, not noticing Krum at all who was desperately trying to gain her attention.
“That would be wonderful”, Potter nodded and turned around: “Good night”, he said then, a bit awkwardly.
So she wasn’t scared, she was certain we would not be able to trace the wand back to the man working with her. And maybe she was right, maybe the wand had travelled through so many hands that tracing it would be impossible.
Harry beamed at him: “They have a little girl, she’s nine weeks old, the mother isn’t even sixteen, father is out of the picture”, he swallowed thickly: “She’s ours if we want her”.
Harry nodded. They were silent again. Harry took a sip of wine and felt the warmth spread through his belly.
And at that Harry blushed profusely, it started at the tip of his nose and spread out toward his temples. It looked adorable.
He landed in front of a big house that looked as if a cliché fairytale witch with wart on the nose and a black cat for company had constructed a big office building. The crooked walls were a meagre yellow tone with a good bit of dirt mixed into it and every window had its own brown shutters. It looked too big for its windows and ugly paint. Draco was still panting when he knocked on the front door.
“Don’t you have informants or something like that?”, Draco asked as they stepped further towards the desk.
Draco was by now greatly concerned about Potters mental state: “I’ve been here the whole time”, he said and shifted his head slightly to look into Potters eyes more directly: “Did you just notice me now?”.
“Don’t tell me that’s what you sleep in”, Harry laughed and Draco awoke with a start. He looked down at himself, he was still wearing the dress pants and his shirt.
Harry looked surprised: “Well let me think, I’m not exactly an expert, all I know I’ve learned from movies and tales”, he said: “Well first of all you may never let them think you don’t love them”, he said: “That is very important”.
“I have not”, Harry said and ran a hand through his hair: “He is quite peculiar, your father, I know not what to make of him”.
Why hadn’t they done this years ago? This was so good, this was how it must feel to be completely safe and secure. Harry had never thought he would feel that way with Malfoy, never. But here he was and he only wanted more.
The woman behind the counter smiled at him a bit confusedly and Draco imagined not many people in a suit frequented this establishment.
“You know Neville, I mean Professor Longbottom too”, Draco insisted: “You’ve known him since you were a baby”.
“Porridge sounds fine”, Draco said: “But if you want I can cook something, I’m quite good, not to toot my own horn”.
“I just wanted to give you this”, Draco said and gave her the bottle of Cognac: “Thanks for having me”.
Harry grinned a little: “Sometimes I don’t mind it, when I’m stressed and need to get rid of the tension, but mostly it’s a chore that has to be done”.
Harry folded his letter into a paper airplane and swished it out of the window, then he sat down beside Draco again.
“You’re late”, Malfoy said then and walked over towards him. “I’ve been here for a while”, Harry admitted.
Harry. Had he ever called him that? Had he ever even thought about him like this? So friendly, so respectful, so…fond. No, as far as Draco remembered he’d always been Potter, stinking Potter, meddling Potter, oh-so-good Potter. And that was the way it was supposed to be. They weren’t friends, they were barely friendly when meeting.
Draco huffed: “Well I wouldn’t say that, granted we were friendly and got over the initial awkwardness but I’m not sure if he particularly likes me still”.
It’s Sunday, he thought so why was his alarm going off in the first place? Not many people knew of it, but Draco Malfoy was not a morning person and on the rare occasion his cat would allow it he would spend his weekend mornings contently sleeping until the rays of the noon sun pierced through his eyelids. There were no sunrays now though.
“I thought it unwise to associate myself with my family”, Draco said: “Too much has happened, and I am disgruntled with her way of acting during the time of the war”.
Draco swallowed: “You can’t postpone it just because I’m here”, he said and put a hand on Harrys shoulder: “That’s not fair, to you or her”.
They arrived at Azkaban in the middle of the night, the warden was not amused. The affair was over in a matter of minutes, Draco had to sign something he didn’t read, then the man left and the warden instructed him to take off his clothes. Draco hesitated but then he did how he was told, slipping out of his suit, too aware of the way the snake was slithering over his wrist, of the way the scars on his chest glistened pink in the moonlight.
“Must’ve lost it”, Potter mumbled and put his hands into his pant pockets sternly avoiding Dracos face.
Ginny looked at him like he had cursed her firstborn: “Yes, sometimes”, she said very deliberatedly: “It does happen”.
“Okay, let’s set a few ground rules”, he said but weirdly he was smiling again: “No Blowjobs, nothing illegal and nothing too expensive”.
“That is serious matter indeed”, Potter murmured and looked worriedly at Draco: “Are you alright?”, he asked then.
He took out his wand and severed the stems of three sunflowers, he would give them to Harry back home. Back at Harrys home, he meant of course.
“We’ve come to inquire after a wand that might have been in your possession fifteen years ago”, Harry said and took out the wand: “Do you reckognize it?”.
“What brings you to me?”, Lucious asked and turned around to sit on his bed again: “Please sit down”, he signed for two chairs opposite him.
Somewhere deep down he knew he deserved it, deserved to be punished like this. And maybe Azkaban wasn’t this bad now that the Dementors were gone? Maybe he could spend some quality time with his father?
When Draco came to the front of the store there was nothing suggesting something was going on behind its dark facade. The street was empty and silent and the sign above the door swayed gently in the warm summer breeze. He walked closer toward the door, it was slightly ajar. A shudder ran down his spine and even though it was warm outside the little white hairs on his arms stood up in anticipation and fear.
Malfoy was already there. He was sitting on a bench, a basket full of food next to him and chewing nervously on his bottom lip. He had conjured a big clock in front of him and he was staring at it intently. He was kneeding his palms with his fingers.
I regret to tell you that I feel a bit under the weather these last weeks, my healer has informed me that it is something called Menopause, it is not curable, but do not worry yourself, it is, while taking a long time, not detrimental to my overall health.
And at the beginning or end of those classes Harry would find a note on his table or a note would collide with the back of his head and it would read: Have a nice day.
“Get behind me”, Potter shouted behind him but Draco didn’t listen, he had his wand outstretched and ran towards the backdoor leading to Garricks living quarters. The silence was complete inside the store and Draco had a sinking feeling inside his stomach, he knew what they would find.
I have found the pieces of the wand where you have described it. I will need further materials and will try to acquire them by tonight.
Harry hurried along: “It is only for the duration of this investigation”, he explained: “The Prophet neglected to mention that Mr. Malfoys life had been put in jeopardy twice that evening when he tried to stop the assailant”.
Harry felt the heat of anger rise in his stomach as he looked at Malfoy. But the longer he looked the calmer Harry felt, Malfoy looked weirdly innocent, with his closed eyes, no trace of the usual sneer on his relaxed face, he looked vulnerable.
Draco held his breath and nodded. How would it be this flat were Potter lived? He imagined a scruffy bachelor pad with wildly mismatched furniture, cosy and disorganized. What he saw when Potter finally turned on the light was the complete opposite. They walked into a modern and minimalistic entrance hall with a big abstract painting on the far side of the wall.
“Very pretty”, Draco said and fixed his gaze at the coffee machine, apparently a muggle concoction he didn’t quite understand. He was no big coffee drinker, he preferred a strong tea for his caffeine fix in the morning but whenever he had coffee it would come out of a simple French press everyone could handle.
‘Yes, Potter.’ He sighed, ‘Now come out and play before anyone else come to look for you, wondering if I murdered you.’
Part of being an adult meant there could be a tsunami happening within you, destroying your inner world, and you would still look calm as if nothing was happening. And a Malfoy would say proudly that no one could best them at keeping up a mask.
‘…Nah.’ Potter smiled and looked at Draco’s wand, ‘Maybe I should take yours, and you get a new wand. I really like it, it was by my side at the worst time and the hardest battle.’
“Sure”, he said: “Harry then”. It sounded very wrong and it felt wrong on his lips, like kissing his grandma with tongue. Draco shuddered.
“Why does it not surprise me that your father is slap dap in the middle of this?”, Harry hissed and walked towards the elevators.
The man stood in the darkness, Draco could only make out his silhouette. It was the same man, dark cloak, black hat, heavy leather boots on his feet.
They looked warily at them but stayed silent, until a small man in his fifties turned towards Harry and said: “Great to see you, Mr. Potter”, he held out his hand.
“The wand was used to attack Mr. Malfoy”, Harry explained: “And its holder kidnapped Mr. Garrick Ollivander two nights ago”.
Draco didn’t know how long they stood there, air heavy with the scent of sunflowers but way too soon Harry pulled away, cheeks pink and lips shiny. Harrys eyes were glazed, like he had a fever.
“There must be something I can do”, Draco said, outraged by the lack of his involvement in Potters plan.
“That is not all of course”, Draco hurried: “I would like to raise a child and give it everything I never received, you know”, he stopped: “Have it be safe and happy and content”.
“I’m sorry to hear that”, Draco said and layed a hand on Harrys thigh: “I’m sure you will be successful sooner than later”.
Harry came back into the living room with two full glasses of red liquid and put them down on the coffee table before them.
“Not really”, Potter pondered a little: “Don’t use our toothbrush and when you have dirty laundry you may choose to put it in with our wash if you’d rather not use magic for that”.
But this was odd for two very rational reasons: the first and probably more important one was that Garrick hated mornings, one of the few things he hated more than mornings were mornings that were somehow worse than others (he had never explained exactly how he determined which would be which) and the only thing he hated more than that were the mornings he felt the arthritis in his knees flare up. And today was one of the latter.
Draco raised his eyebrows but said nothing further about the matter, instead piling elixir after elixir into an already aching trunk full of wand care products.
Draco had also gotten used to that (looking at it like that he thought him rather tolerant now, he had gotten used to an almost ungodly array of things) and only rolled his eyes half way.
Harry held out his arm and Draco took it, the last thing he saw were the three sunflowers still in Harrys right hand.
He opened his eyes and stared into the darkness of his room. This was too early, way too early for his liking but also objectively too early for any human being to be awake. He hesitated, unsure what all of this meant and why it was keeping him from sleeping until his tired brain adjusted a little bit and he realised: This wasn’t his clock, this was the stores alarm. Someone was breaking in.
“Thank you Martha, Mr. Creston”, Harry rose from his chair and nodded at them both: “It was a pleasure”.
It took a minute for Draco to realise he was alone once more. He was still crouched behind his desk and breathing heavily.
Draco tried another smile and this time the corners of the mans mouth tilted upwards ever so slightly. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and stared towards the doors.
“Draco was attacked”, Harry said and Lucious gasped: “Quite violently and not only once, we have reason to believe the attacker is known to you”.
There was silence around the table when Harry stepped back. Only a few seconds had gone by, a few wonderful seconds and Draco could breathe again. He stared at Harry, who was watching him closely. He could feel that his mouth was open in surprise but he couldn’t do anything about it.
They were silent then, watching the fairy lights dance around the dark sky. It was magical, the magic was buzzing in the air and made Harrys insides warm up, his fingers tingle and the wine made his brain twirl.
“Well, we will not be worse for it if nothing comes of it, I’m sure”, Harry said and pocketed his notepad again.
“Nice day today”, Potter said now: “Do you have any plans or are you stuck working here the whole day?”.
Harry looked between them: “So Greyback, Dolohov and the Carrows”, he said: “Anyone else who was there?”, he asked.
Krum must have talked to Malfoy more than Harry had realized or Malfoy wouldn’t be in the lake now. Harry rolled his eyes and realized the merepeople were still staring at him intently.
Draco looked at him wide eyed. Somewhere deep inside his belly there was a heat that had not been there a minute prior but he ignored it best he could.
“You’re not too bad yourself”, Malfoy whispered still staring into Harrys eyes with wild intensity. Harry felt his stomach twist and turn.
Harry blushed a little at that: “No we haven’t”, he shook his head: “I don’t know”, he hesitated, then he leaned in towards Draco and whispered: “I don’t know if I want to”, he said and looked around the room if anyone heard.
Harry looked at him, astonished: “That is horrible, Draco”, he said finally: “To not have your parents be your best friends growing up, your play mates”.
It was silent then,- Harry was stirring the porridge and again Draco wondered why he didn’t use magic for it but then again Harry had grown up as a muggle, had spent his holidays around muggles, maybe he was so used to doing everything their way he didn’t think about it anymore.
“But”, Draco started but Potter interrupted him: “I will escort you home and will keep in further contact if we have any more questions”. And that was the end of it. Draco was offended but what was the use in arguing? Potter had been stubborn from the moment he came into this world and Draco had better things to do anyways. If Potter didn’t want his help, he sure wouldn’t force it on him, his loss. Draco would have been big help, that was for sure, Draco thought himself quite helpful indeed.
“I was stupid once”, Lucious said: “Stupid and scared and I did not protect you like I aught to have”, he shook his head: “I am sorry for that, son, I am seriously sorry”.
“Well I am very sorry”, Draco replied, sarcasm dripping from his lips: “That my existence is such a burden on you”, he was jumping his leg up and down and the Mediwizards head was bobbing along with it: “Next time I’ll remember to die”.
“Don’t worry about it”, Potter said and yawned: “Go use the bathroom, I have to do some paperwork before I go to sleep”.
“Of course”, Lucious said and thought about it: “There was Fenrir”, he said: “He was in a very bad mood that day. And Dolohov. And the siblings Carrow”, he hesitated: “That was it, it was the five of us”.
Draco didn’t know what to say so he just stared at the man in his kitchen, he looked like an angel, granted, a little disheveled for an angel but still.
Potter chuckled and turned towards the door: “Sure, sure, but you still think I’m brave”, he said over his shoulder as he closed the door behind him.
After what felt like only a second and an eternity at the same time they parted and looked at each other. Harrys lips were tingling.
“You have done well in deciding that way, I am sure”, Harry said with a stern look: “How long has your father yet to sit out?”.
So they despised him, he thought, of course they did. This was going to be a miserable afternoon, this was going to be horrible.
“There was a break in at Olivanders”, he said: “I’m sure you read about it in the papers this morning”.
Draco took a spoon full, it was sweet and buttery and hot and it tasted so delicious he didn’t even mind burning the roof of his mouth with the next spoon. Then he felt the stare on him and stopped, looking up meeting Harrys eyes.
“You were a deatheater, Draco, now you’re a wandmaker, a spellbreaker. You’re a survivor, just like me, we are equal”, Harry said.
“Nobody who knows you will think that, Draco, and for the others, fuck them”, Harry said and smiled.
Potter smiled at him and put the wand back into its box: “Well, that’s settled then”, he said and Draco saw the goose bumps on the other man’s arms.
“Everything”, Potter said: “The weather, politics, movies, books, games. They are very nice people”.
“Like a normal human being”, Harry sighed in exasperation: “Just be polite and charming and don’t make my colleagues hate you”.
“Is it very expensive there?”, Draco asked, not daring to drink any more wine, what if the bottle had cost him a hundred galleons?
“No”, Harry said, serious now: “I’m glad your father has understood what the meaning of a second chance is, and I’m glad he is determined to deserve one”.
Draco tiptoed out into the hallway and opened the first drawer of the cabinet. Bills. Spare keys. Scarfs and gloves. He sighed and opened the second drawer. There was tape, finally. Draco had just wanted to close the drawer when he realized it was smaller than the first one he had opened. He looked at it bewildered, the back wall seemed multiple centimeters nearer than the other drawers. He knocked against the wood and a hollow kind of sound travelled to his ear. There was a false bottom there he realized with bewilderment.
It was still closed and Draco stood there waiting in the brisk morning air, eager to continue on his mission.
“We have muggle friends who come over from time to time”, Potter shrugged: “It’s good to keep up appearances”.
I am relieved to hear your illness is – while not curable – not interfering with your life too much.
Draco watched him, in his jeans and the blue socks on the wooden floor, so very domestic, so trusting, his wand lay in the hallway, far away out of reach.
Draco took out his wand and unlocked the door again, he had to force himself to remember that he didn’t have to be quiet this time and instead yanked to door open quite indelicately.
“I think I want to kiss you again”, Draco said, frowning: “I want to kiss you in front of everyone, the whole school, my father, my mother, everybody”.
The door opened again and the Weasley and Potter came back into the hall, she looked angry, red blotches on her pale face, Potter looked tired.
“Hello, my name is Harry Potter, Auror Department 13f and I have a wand that I want to check against the registry”.
Draco didn’t talk much the whole evening, but he did tell a few comical stories about Garrick and his eccentric ways only stopping once he realized that he didn’t know when, if ever he would see his boss again.
There was movement around him and he opened them again. Thick brown rope was slithering around his body like snakes, tying him up. Draco couldn’t breathe, he felt the panic settle in his bones as a cold shudder ran down his body.
“Oh is that so”, the lady yawned and opened the door: “Department 13 f if you don’t mind”, she gestured towards the dark hallway: “Up the stairs until you’re on the fifth floor then to your left”.
“I see”, his father said and nodded: “I will do my best. But first, may I inquire of how it came to be that the both of you are visiting me together?”.
“Garrick”, Draco shouted, eyes still fixed on Potters back bobbing away through the crowd of people: “Do you reckon this day is getting any bigger yet? Because in that case I need to take a break”.
“Garrick?”, Draco asked in a tone as quiet as can be, no use setting off the bomb that was surely brewing inside the man somewhere: “Are you alright?”.
“Draco I’m so sorry”, it burst out of Harry with a force Draco had not anticipated: “Ginny told me everything, you were right, I just”, he paused: “I couldn’t believe it, I thought I knew her, I knew her best of everyone in the world, it was just so out of character, I couldn’t believe you”.
“Nonsense”, Harry said and clapped in his hands, a smile on his face: “Let’s drink a glass of wine and forget about that”.
Lucious got to his feet and lead Draco towards the visiting area. Sitting on one of the round tables was Dracos mother. Draco smiled.
His first thought when he saw one of the merepeople was, wow those are ugly. They looked peculiar, not at all like the muggle mermaid legends.
Draco was still panting and suddenly very aware of his attire, his knee was bleeding through his pyjama leg, his head probably beat red from the excitement and his curls flatted with sweat (also from the excitement, it was a lot).
The woman looked at him: “It’s about Spiderman”, she said and Draco realized he should know what that means.
“Do you want to bring the cat or not?”, Potter asked: “Because you’re not very good at persuading me at the moment”.
At that Draco did roll his eyes and Mr. Creston looked at him with shock: “Don’t you roll your eyes at that young man, I’m sure you know what Mr. Potter has done”.
Draco looked around the room, half the shelves contents were thrown on the ground or discarded on the workbench and he didn’t know where to begin his search. So he started somewhere between the chisel and the unicorn hairs.
So they had to go to Azkaban and to go there was a wild ride on its own, first they had to apparate to the coast and then get into a stingy sailboat that brought them more or less safely to the island where the prison was located.
“Are you one of the bad Malfoys?”, Teddy asked and Draco swallowed. “Nana told me the Malfoys were on the wrong side of the war”.
So Potter (Harry) was still with the Weasley girl, how romantic. He huffed and spit out toothpaste. Maybe they were engaged already, it had been long enough, but Draco had not seen an engagement ring on her finger. Maybe she only wore it outside? He made a mental note to investigate in the morning, maybe sneak around the house a little, look at the pictures, rifle though their mail, all the things a good guest should not do.
Then he walked over to the table and looked down at the place settings, there were small cards on top of the dishes, with the name for the person that was supposed to sit there on it. Draco walked around the table until he found a card with his name on it and sat down.
He heard a loud bang and looked around. They stood in a small alley behind a sandwich store and breathed in the warm air.
Draco huffed: “That can’t be true, what about Hogwarts? We practically lived together for seven years”.
“Garrick”, Draco shouted now after feeble attempts of lot more gentle methods: “The store was broken into”, he screamed into the old mans ears.
“He states he was merely walking by when he saw four men attack the teenagers”, Harry told him and Draco huffed: “When the Aurors came the attackers disapparated leaving only Lucious behind, the teenagers were promptly obliviated and sent on their way”.
“Certainly”, he said, as convinced as possible and Potter smiled in agreement. Good thing they had clarified that, Draco thought with a huff.
“I don’t want to bring her”, he huffed: “I want to stay with her, in my own flat and my own bed and drink my own tea in the morning”, he declared and ruffled through his curls: “The bad guys have what they want, I’m not in danger anymore”.
“Yes indeed”, Draco said: “They decided it was better to take away his money and started a foundation with it, it is in favour of houselves and magical creatures, it is sure to irk my father to no end”, he laughed.
“Wand?”, Potter coughed out the question so suddenly it startled Draco into a little unfashionable jerk. His eyes darted back to Potters face (they might have wandered a bit – Potter was definitely going to the gym) and to his horror he felt heat spread over his chest and up his throat.
Now they were stood there nodding at each other. After a second Draco turned around and went towards his door, his legs feeling weirdly jello like.
“Oh you two boys live together?”, Mr. Creston asked with a grin: “I’m sure that isn’t always smooth sailing”.
“Yes, Draco”, Harry said and rolled his eyes: “But have you never rolled around with them on the floor, play fighting, or sledded through the mud with them, had a snowball fight?”, he asked.
“Very nice to meet you, Martha”, Potter said and shook her hand: “Have you met Mr. Malfoy?”, he asked, trying to introduce them.
“It’s my birthday tomorrow”, Harry said finally: “We’re all going to Ginnys parents to have a party, the whole family will be there and you’ll have to come with me”.
Next they walked into a big white kitchen, nice and clean, with a marble workspace and silver appliances.
“It’s nice, actually”, Draco grinned: “It feels like the good old times, we’re both in danger and you’re watching me while I’m sleeping, I feel at home already”.
Draco nodded and squeezed his father one last time, then he turned around and followed the man out of the ward.
“Yes very”, Potter reassured him fervently: “I haven’t used it at work yet but I find it very compliant in everyday tasks. Just an hour ago I managed to get a stain off my trousers without setting them on fire which my last one tended to do.”
“I’ll call for a Mediwizard anyway, you’re a bit too bloody for my liking”, he said and folded a piece of his notes into a paper airplane and sent it through the open window: “They’ll be here in no time and until then you can tell me exactly what happened”.
“There’s a lot out of place here Potter”, Draco said dryly, he was quite poignantly looking at a piece of pillow on top of the chandelier: “Where should I begin?”.
“It’s good you boys are having your fun”, Mr. Creston said and smiled at them. Draco decided to like him, he was nice if a bit simple and he seemed all too eager to forgive him now that he had seen that Potter had done so as well.
“Yes”, she said: “Apart from the weekends obviously, although during active Season we do train on the weekends sometimes”.
“Look, honey”, Potter pleaded: “I didn’t have a choice, I’m sorry but we’ll just have to make it work”.
“Scared, Potter?”, Malfoy asked silently. He leaned in closer. “Terrified”, Harry whispered and leaned in closer too.
Draco nodded: “I’m sorry to cause you any inconvenience”, Draco said even though he didn’t ask for this, Potter had insisted he come.
Draco couldn’t move as the body bind took effect and he plummeted towards the floor with great speed. Someone was in his apartment, he thought, someone was attacking him, again. He collided with the floor with a deafening crunch. A sharp pain shot into his right shoulder and lingered there. His shoulder was broken.
It had started to rain now, the drops pattered against the high windows and lulled Draco in. Draco closed his eyes.
“And hit you with a killing curse?”, Potter asked: “No, this is a dark wizard yearning for power, Malfoy, I know it”.
“Of course a baby”, Harry rolled his eyes: “What did you think, that I was talking about a fucking pony?”.
“I’m going to need your help carrying that to my flat”, Potter said then and flattened his hair while gesturing towards the huge wooden trunk overflowing with potions: “I’ll buy you lunch in exchange”.
“I do actually”, Harry said proudly: “But I will only contact them once other sources of information fail”.
“Terrible as always”, George admitted and kissed his sister on the cheek: “And you’ve brought Malfoy”, he said and looked at Draco with unveiled curiosity.
Draco would stay alone, he had long given up on finding someone who could stand him enough to fall in love with him and Potter would have seven children, one more insufferable then the other and he would get a bit chubby as he grew older and balder hopefully.
“I’m just saying, you don’t have to keep it if you don’t like it”, Draco explained matter of factly, his stomach was churning.
“Oh I’ve read about that in one of the muggle books in the library”, Lucious winced: “Have the hot flushes started already?”.
Narcissa nodded, apparently understanding that Draco didn’t want to disclose any further information.
“I don’t make deals with scum”, the man said and spat into Dracos face. Draco flinched back and wiped his face.
“Well it isn’t quite morning anymore, you two”, Harry said: “We have to hurry, your parents expect us in an hour”.
Draco cleared his throat, properly overwhelmed by this whole display: “Here I am”, he said and scratched his head: “And I’ve come with a friend”, he said.
No he first noticed something was off as he pushed open the door to the workshop behind Garrick’s storefront and saw him sitting there, feet restlessly jumping up and down, both knees incrusted with lumps of fabric and eyes staring into his empty mug, murmuring at his hands with anxious excitement.
“They are good people, Draco”, Harry said and put on his coat: “They just aren’t as, how should I say it, refined as you might be”.
The door swung open with a soft shriek as he slowly made his way into the shop. He was careful to avoid the creaky floorboards and put his leather loafered feet down carefully at every step, as to not make any unnecessary noise. He heard something from the workshop.
The morning was mild and busy, fruit sellers shouting out prices and arguing loudly when someone disagreed with said prices, businessmen in suits and polished robes hurrying along with bags from a bakery in one and a newspaper in the other hand chewing passionately on the contents of the first (unless it was just one of those days and they took a hearty bite off todays headline), there were children not wanting to go to kindergarten, screaming and begging their parents to take them to work instead and parents equally devastated to do exactly that. It was awake and loud and so alive.
He had just begun slicing at her ropes when there was movement in the corner of his eye. Cedric, looking puzzled.
I have been attacked here as well and am now in the protected ward, I have heard that father resides here as well and am looking forward to seeing him again.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes: “I wanted to do it after my birthday”, he said and shook his head.
“I’ll explain everything to them, I’m sure they will be civil”, Harry reassured him: “I can tell them you have changed”.
“Yes”, Draco said: “I thought it was the least dangerous occupation there was, but it turns out I was wrong”.
Harry looked over his shoulder and chuckled: “How formal”, he said: “Do you always talk to your parents like that?”.
“He doesn’t know what effect he can have on people”, Harry said, but he didn’t smile, he was looking at Draco somberly.
“Oh my word”, Mr. Burgin said: “Mr. Potter, what a surprise to see you. And Mr. Malfoy, how do you do?”.
“Your house is very nice”, Draco said and put his luggage down next to the sofa: “How long have you lived here?”.
“No worries”, the woman was still smiling: “I know which one he probably has, I’ve got a few good games for that”.
Draco couldn’t help the tears from falling down his face: “Are you serious?”, he sobbed and Harry walked over, hugging him tightly.
Most of those were stored inside glasses and barrels and pouches and phials and chests inside a huge, dark wooden, over 3 meters high shelf taking over the whole back wall of the room.
“You’re coming with me”, Potter said to Draco as they headed for the door: “It’s not safe for you to stay in your flat alone”.
Everything hurt, even though the prison nurse had patched him up pretty nicely. Some of the scars on his chest (Harrys scars) had ripped open again and she had not known how to close them back up again, so she had bandaged them up and they were slowly bleeding through his jumpsuit.
“I’ll keep an eye out”, Draco said and opened the crate door. Mary Antoinette was very confused, she seemed unsure of what to do next so Draco just left her there, she could get accustomed to her new surrounding at her own pace.
“Didn’t the Weasleys lose a son in the battle of Hogwarts? Fred, wasn’t it?”, Draco asked tentatively.
“He should be in any minute now”, Harry answered: “He probably went for a coffee yesterday, he has a five month old at home and sleep is hard to come by”.
He got a black and white striped jumpsuit that didn’t suit his complexion at all and was shown to his cell. There was a bed , two chairs and a desk there.
Potter had a look of bewildered fascination on his face which Draco found both infuriating and weirdly endearing. No, not endearing, amusing, yes he meant amusing.
“Will do”, Draco said and made a mental note to hop into the shower at exactly half past seven: “Anything else I need to know?”, he asked then.
“You’re very welcome”, she said and took him by the elbow dragging him towards the house. He could hear Harry chuckle behind him: “I told you they’re excited to meet you” he said and shook his head. Draco swallowed.
Harry was changing, he saw it immediately through the door that was slightly ajar. He was wearing blue jeans and he was barefoot, he had just taken off his Pyjama top and his upper body was naked. He looked tan and wiry and muscular and his skin shifted with every movement.
Draco wondered when he had started to want to kiss Harry Potter, somehow that had passed him by these last few days but here they were and Draco was all tingly and hot and he couldn’t stop smiling.
“He must have apparated with him”, Potter breathed heavily and looked around the room for nothing in particular.
Harry came back into the shop, accompanied by a young woman in her early thirties, she was holding a sketchpad and pencils.
Did that mean…was Potter lying to see him again? Dracos heart squeezed tight and made him a bit dizzy. No that couldn’t be it. Maybe Draco had forgotten to put it in? But he was sure he hadn’t, so maybe Potter did lose it already? He was known do be rather unorganised, bordering on negligence in some instances, so maybe he had lost his kit and was embarrassed to admit to it in front of Draco, someone who had his life together and was a functioning adult man.
Malfoy unfolded the piece of paper immediately and Harry couldn’t see his face from here but he could have sworn the gits shoulders were shaking with silent laughter.
It had been pathetic (and a bit cute) how little Potter had been able to conceal his interest, not that Draco had been particularly watching him, no no, everyone, he was sure, had been able to tell, even the Weasel and as far as Draco was concerned that meant a lot. No surely they weren’t together anymore, even though he took Potter for the One-and-Only love of my life kind of guy, it was too obvious a pairing if there ever had been one. They had been too perfect for each other, no Potter needed someone different, someone to disagree with him, maybe even fight a little, someone who didn’t melt at his feet the moment they saw him.
“That’ll be 10 Galleons”, he said and put the box into a bag: “Are you a member of our Discount Club?”, he asked and Potter made a grimace.
“Yes very nice”, Draco said absentmindedly checking the expiration date on each bottle he chucked into the trunk, most of them had expired a good 35 years ago and he wondered if they would still be good. “A bit too hot for my liking, so I’ll hide myself inside the store”.
Harry nods: “Thank you”, he said and turned around. Draco smiled at the woman who looked after Harry with amazement and turned to follow him.
Again there was silence. Four. Five. Now it was Potters turn to say something, Draco thought, but Potter didn’t show the slightest inclination to open his mouth. Six. Seven. Potter was still bobbing up and down on his toes, looking at Draco. What was he looking at? Eight. Was there something on Dracos face? Nine. Maybe there was dirt on his face. Ten.
Potter had been polite towards him, that was good. He seemed quite professional in his job, that was also positive.
He heard Harry take in a sharp breath and he wanted to step away, afraid he had done something wrong, even though this felt so right, but then he felt a hand at the back of his neck pulling him in closer.
“He will be happy to have a visitor”, the woman said and opened a heavy steel door. They walked inside, it was barely any warmer, but it was dry and the loud patter of the rain was muted by the thick walls.
Dracos priorities were not aligned with those of the wand master, he was all about searching for new cores, new combinations in wood and length, new processes of melting the core into the wood, while Olivander in his old stubbornness was quite satisfied with the way things were done already and didn’t understand nor condone Dracos tireless search for innovation.
“There’s the bathroom over there”, Potter said and signed towards a door to their right: “Do whatever you please with it but make sure not to use the shower shortly before half past seven, since that’s the time Ginny leaves for work”.
“Well, it’s a good thing you now know the common life”, Harry said: “Are there wizard supermarkets?”, he asked: “I never checked”.
“I did what everybody would do and got myself a job”, Draco said proudly: “I struggled for a few months, living in cheap muggle motel rooms until I had enough money to rent the flat I currently live in”.
Lucious Malfoy was sitting on his bed, gaunt face excitedly facing the door, he was wearing the grey striped prisoners uniform over his thin body, there was a thick blanket around his shoulders.
Backup arrived fifteen minutes later, ten stern looking aurors apparated into the shop all at once with one single deafening bang.
“Hold still”, Potter pointed his wand towards his shoulder and with one sickening crack and a flare up of pain he had repaired the break.
“That is an excellent idea”, Harry agreed: “We ought to go to Burgin and Burkes, there we might inquire after it some more, are you almost done with your food?”.
It wasn’t too bad in prison, granted, the food was terrible and he longed to go on stroll through Diagon Alley but he managed.
“No they would never”, Harry said: “And they don’t know where I am anyway, so no use waiting for a letter”, he took his glass again.
And he had, strolled in casually that was. So damn casually. With a light sway of hips and bringing in the buzz from the Alley outside so god damn casual and alive. It was quite astonishing (and reassuring) to see Potter being so, well, casual.
He was a mere three meters away from the assailant when it happened. He had placed his hands on top of one of the showcasing tables to not put too much weight on one particularly noisy floorboard when his fingers brushed the wand displayed on a big cushion on top of the table. He barely even touched it but the wand started moving and with one earth shattering bang it fell off the cushion and onto the glass tabletop. Tip and End and Tip again.
Potters lips parted into a grin. He had dimples on his cheeks. Draco hadn’t noticed them before since they were almost lost between his dark freckles. Why had he noticed them now? Because the light was different, he thought, of course, the light inside the storefront was completely different to the light inside the castle.
Draco nodded, he understood that. It was like polishing the wand after making it, it didn’t do anything for its magic, it didn’t benefit the wand in any way other than to make it look prettier. Not that Harry looked pretty now, that was not the point at all.
“Harry”, a voice boomed through the room and Ron Weasley made his way through the crowd towards them.
“Yes”, Potter said and put away the newspaper he had been reading while Draco had rushed through the house chasing Mary Antoinette: “My flat is protected but we can apparate to the store on the corner”.
“It’s okay, Harry”, he said: “I understand that you trusted your girlfriend of however many years more than a death eater you only really knew for a couple of days, it’s okay”.
They were silent then, Harry looking between them with unveiled curiosity and Draco kneeding his palms nervously.
“Well this is a lovely party”, Draco said nonchalantly: “And a beautiful cake, Molly, very thoughtful”.
“That’s the spirit”, Harry chuckled:: “Here, take my notepad, write to her now”, he reached over and pressed the notepad into Dracos palms: “You can go by the owlery and have it delivered as soon as we are done here”.
It happened as soon as Potters fingertips brushed the dark wood. Golden sparks erupted out the wands tip and flew around the room like a thousand bright stars. Little spots of golden and red light danced over every surface (Potters face) and made it look like a fire was raging inside the store. The air was electric, crackling and sizzling with magic and Draco felt the hair on his arms stand up.
“You don’t know that and neither do we, maybe he comes back, maybe he wants to eliminate witnesses”.
Now he stood there, unsure of what to do and looked around. There were a few groups of people talking with each other, but they seemed so engrossed Draco didn’t want to disturb them. So he decided to go and check out the house and the garden, have a look around. He walked through the crowd and into a small living room with a hot fire burning, he didn’t appreciate the fire, it was already too full and hot inside the house, the sun was burning down restlessly.
Oh how wonderful that sounded. No more Malfoy. No more sneering, no more bullying, now more laughing behind his back. No more worries. Because Harry was always worried when it came to Malfoy and it made his stomach ache and his head pound.
“Yes, thank you”, Draco replied: “I have gone to visit my father earlier today, he seems in high spirits”.
Harry finally fixed his shirt and rolled up his sleeves: “Well I can’t leave you here on your own”, he said: “You’re going to have to come with me”.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes, then he took the cloak off. “Potter”, Malfoy breathed: “You came”.
He went over to Molly and Arthur, who seemed happy and exhausted: “Thank you so much for allowing me to be here”, he said: “I had a wonderful day”.
Draco did not know what to do, his father had never hugged him before and even though he was frail, thin and a bit smaller than Draco his grip was strong and unrelenting around his chest.
Draco nodded and knelt down next to Mary Antoinette: “Can I let her out?”, he asked and looked at Potter.
“Did the curse hit you in the knee?”, Potter asked and flinched a little as the Mediwizard cut open Dracos Pyjama leg to reveal his blood encrusted skin.
“It’s on the house”, he said and smiled proudly. This was a nice gesture, sure Potter would realise it.
But Harry laughed, his real laugh, all belly and happiness and Draco couldn’t help but grin like a dumbass.
He wanted to ask them where he had to go, but only bubbles came out of his mouth. They seemed to understand though because the freed a way for him to swim through. Reluctantly Harry followed the path layed out in front of him, dozens of eyes watching him swim by with strong strokes.
“I thought illegal would be exactly up your alley”, Harry said and felt his lips twitching. Stupid lips.
He needed a birthday present for Harry, but where should he start, what even did that man want? He wandered around the street for half an hour without coming to a great conclusion until he saw it.
“No nothing, my dear”, Molly said and ran a hand through her hair: “I’ve got everything under control”.
The room was dark, only one lamp was burning inside and barely illuminated two figures crouched over their respective desks.
Draco smiled at her, then he nodded at Arthur who nodded back curtly and turned towards the garden gate where Harry was waiting.
“I need a birthday present for a friend of mine”, he said and once again couldn’t believe Harry was his friend: “He has a Game Boy”, he explained: “I was looking for a new game he could play”.
And then Draco just did it. He reached out with one hand and stroked Harrys cheek, very softly, took a step forward, that was all it took and put his lips on Harrys.
His father looked ashamed, properly ashamed: “I don’t know son”, he whispered: “I was a different man back then”.
He could see Potters head jerk in his direction out of the corner of his eye and Draco understood, a friend? Was that really what Harry was? But what else would he be by now? He was no enemy no more, he wasn’t a foe.
It was exactly where he had put it, Draco had revolutionised Ollivander’s sorting technique ages ago and was still sufficiently proud of his work.
Today, he had genially deduced from the fabrics around Ollivander’s knees he wore on those occasions, every time drenched in a homemade concoction of vinegar, white rum and what smelled like a long expired splash of Anti Ailment Elixir, was one of those days. What didn’t fit the picture was the absence of both the imminent destruction and the harsh stench of burnt liquor bottles (apparently Ollivander had forgotten to drench his compress today) that normally tipped Draco off the second he walked into the shop on these glim occasions.
Teddy must have realised that this was important because he was very still, looking at them with interest.
Potter had wanted to go to lunch. With him. And Draco hadn’t just declined, he hadn’t even answered. Draco groaned. There he had been, looking out for subtle clues and not noticing the most obvious one when it hit him in the face. Draco slapped himself. He had to clarify his intentions when Potter came in next. Or rather apologise and deal with the unpleasantries like a grown man.
Martha sighed: “So far it does not look good, Mr. Potter”, she said: “But give me two more minutes and I can be sure”.
“So what is the story behind this wand?”, Mr. Creston asked and Draco was very much ready for Harrys dismissal, that it was an ongoing investigation, that he couldn’t say anything about it but instead he started to talk, mouth full of biscuit crumbs.
“Is this your plan to break us up?”, Harry asked, venom in his voice: “We kissed once, Malfoy, I don’t even know why”.
A giant towel was wrapped around his body as he made his way through the crowd and sat down at the farthest corner from everyone.
Harry shook his head: “No”, he said: “I wanted to write them a few times, let them know I’m still alive, find out what became of Dudley, but I never have the nerve”.
Martha looked at it for a long time, then she sighed and took it, Draco smiled and she blushed a little.
Draco had suspected for the longest time that Potter would never become a semi-productive member of society, he had imagined him more like all the muggle child stars (he had done some research), the ones that reach their peak with puberty and become drug addicts with greasy hair and pimples. On further consideration, greasy hair might be Potters best option regarding his look, maybe the oils on his scalp could tame that mess he called a hairstyle.
“Well I’ll be sure to have more panic attacks from now on”, Draco said it without thinking about it, he regretted it immediately.
“You forget that the Dark Lord personally taught me”, Draco said silently: “I know my way around some nasty curses”.
Oh no, Draco thought with a grin, she would know he was here. He would moan and snore and raid her fridge, whatever necessary to make her life just a tiny bit more difficult. It was the only thing he could do in this situation, he would have been a bad Malfoy if he didn’t at least try to be as inconvenient as possible. He looked around the entrance hall and studied the large abstract painting. It was beautiful, it looked like a rainy afternoon in Norway, somewhere far away from the next building, somewhere next to a fjord or by a big lake, somewhere where little people ever made their way to.
“Good to see you too, Ron”, Harry said and waved across the room, where Hermione Granger tried to politely shove people out of her way.
There were people already sitting at the table, glasses of wine in their hands, talking vehemently with each other. Children were playing catch over by the chicken coop with grass stains on their knees and bloody palms from skidding to a halt violently. Draco saw another table, smaller this time with a big pile of presents on it and promptly put the small present he had hidden inside his coat on the top. He tried not to imagine how thoughtout and intricate the other presents may be, how much better than his.
He closed the bathroom door behind him and went back to the living room. Potter had put a fluffy blanket and a firm pillow on the couch and Draco sighed in relief at the sight of it, that would very much do.
“All four of them are in Azkaban or dead”, Harry whispered to Draco: “None of them could have attacked you”.
Lucious finally let go of Draco and turned towards Harry, still the biggest smile on his face: “Mr. Potter”, he said and walked over to him, hand outstretched: “What an honour to have you visit me in my humble abode”.
The floor was dark wood, polished to reflect the people standing on it. It smelled like cedar and honey and Draco was very confused. Somehow this didn’t fit at all he thought, was his picture of Potter this wrong?
“I need to be relieved from protection duty”, Harry said curtly: “Take him or put him into protective custody, I don’t care”.
“I’m done listening, Malfoy”, Harry said: “I thought you were done lying, I thought you had changed, but apparently, once a deatheater always a deatheater”.
“That’s good”, Potter said and went over to grab the assailants wand from the floor: “And we have his wand”, he held it up triumphantly.
He twirled it around in his fingers and looked at it carefully: “Can you tell me something about it?”, he asked and gave it to Draco.
“Well, take a look now then”, Potter said and wandered around the rubble: “And tell me of anything that’s out of place”.
“I’d get the kids but they are for once entertaining themselves, so I won’t disturb them”, George said.
“We have training three times a week, even more when I was still in the academy”, Harry said and shrugged.
“Then put him in jail where he belongs”, she said and Draco stood up straighter. Now that wasn’t quite fair. Draco had been well on his way to jail, it had been Potters testimony at his trial that had spared him from Azkaban. Three years probation was all they put upon him and Draco had felt that it was too little. But he accepted the sentence with as much grace as was possible and had vowed to turn his life around. And he had managed quite well in his own humble opinion.
“Sure thing”, the man said and yawned: “That would be this beauty”, he said and put a dusty looking bottle onto the counter: “That will be 150 Galleons”, he said.
He shook his head slightly and put on a sufficiently disapproving look: “It’s a piece of wood with different supernatural cores to channel someone’s magical abilities”, he explained: “Or were you asking if we had any? Because it should be quite apparent that, indeed, we do have wands”, he signed for the tightly packed boxes covering every wall of the store with a flat hand.
She took the letter: “I have to read it”, she said, apologetically: “Just to make sure there’s nothing dangerous in here.”
“I see”, Potter grinned but still pocketed the card: “Thank you very much”, he handed over the money: “I will recommend you to my friends”.
“And you train up into the night sometimes?”, Draco asked: “Since you weren’t here yesterday when we came back”.
Draco didn’t know how much 3 pounds were but he imagined it wasn’t much so he took another sip himself.
He found the old man sleeping in his bunk just like he had hoped and went about to wake him. That was no easy feat since Garrick Olivander was a quite heavy sleeper and a quite grumpy waker which didn’t make it a very pleasant experience for whomever did the waking up.<
Harry blinked a couple of times, then threw an unsure look at Draco, but he only shrugged, he didn’t know what was going on either.
“What’s missing?”, Potter asked as his partner excused himself for the search of the outside perimeter.
What could they have taken? His broomstick maybe? He would sorely miss his broomstick and he couldn’t risk losing it. He pushed further into the black water.
He was sitting in the library next to his father (Lucious had arrived at volume five – dish washers) when the warden announced a visitor for Draco.
There came a chuckle from the living room door, Draco looked up to see his husband standing there, a warm smile on his lips.
Draco awoke early the next morning. He had told himself to wake up early yesterday when he went to bed, because he had things to do this morning, secret things.
“No”, Draco hesitated, this wasn’t a particularly brave injury: “I fell down my stairs when I rushed out to confront him”, he murmured and looked down.
Breakfast was terrible, stale bread with blue cheese, Draco hated blue cheese almost as much as being locked up in here.
The green flash of light hit the back of the storefront and shards of glass and burnt paper rilled down onto him as he heard the man scramble to his feet and run out of the shop. He heard a loud bang as the man disapparated.
“I’m sure it has”, Mr. Creston smiled: “And what do you do, Mr. Malfoy”, he held out a biscuit at Draco and he took it, nibbling on it for a second.
He was just telling Potter about the limp the assailant had been walking with when two bored looking Mediwizards came into the office without knocking.
“Your mother and I are friendly, nowadays”, she told him once she folded the letter back into its envelope: “We talk a bit every time she visits your father”.
Draco laughed: “We are not Savages, Harry”, he said and shook his head: “And politeness is one of our highest virtues”, he said and folded the letter.
“Aldi is a supermarket”, Harry explained: “You know, a store where you buy groceries and all that stuff”.
Harry didn’t dare to make himself known, too afraid of an ambush, so he just stayed where he was, looking at Malfoy and how his face would fall with every minute that passed.
So Draco prepared for a big day. He made tea in a hurry, simultaneously chewing down his rather spectacular tasting croissant and therefore not giving it nearly as much attention as it deserved, sorted through their new arrivals in record time and cleaned up the window to be ready for when this day decided to make a turn for the big.
Harry felt the anger rise as Snape wrote something down on the blackboard. He took out his quill. And furiously began to write.
“I’ll make sure to contact her and ask about her wellbeing”, Draco assured his father: “I am sure she was just inconvenienced by something”.
“Nothing in particular”, Harry said and looked out at the waves: “It’s just”, he stopped: “I am glad, that is all”.
Draco went to brush his teeth and take a quick shower. Then he went over to his luggage and put on a pair of black dress pants and his grey cashmere sweater.
He didn’t have much, he had come here with nothing, all he needed to do was take the books back into the library.
And at that Potter blushed. He fucking blushed. A rosy tint spread from the bridge of his nose outward over his cheeks and up his temples and Draco was pretty sure he was going to die from the sight of it.
It was early afternoon when they landed back inside Diagon Alley and the sun was hot and high in the sky.
Draco nodded and smiled shyly at him but Mr. Creston gave him a look that made the smile die on his face.
“We have to go with the times”, Draco said and handed him a small punching card: “Your tenth wand is free”, he explained.
“Malfoy, Harry? Really?”, Ron looked completely shell shocked. “I don’t know either, Ron”, Harry sighed.
That explained a lot. Draco didn’t do sports, ever. It was so very pointless and humiliating, running around for no reason, lifting heavy weights for the simple benefit of swelling up your muscles, sweating, getting red, panting, no it was all very unMalfoy like and Draco wouldn’t have anything to do with it.
“Home”, Potter simply said and opened the door for them: “Until we find a better arrangement you’re under my protection”.
“I see”, Draco closed the lid of the box again. “On further consideration, give me a moment to get the one with the Troll whiskers, it might be suited better for you”.
“Why is that exactly?”, Draco asked unsure, the Thestral hair was expensive, yes and quite hard to come by without the right connections but it was nothing they couldn’t replace in a month or two.
“Martha, I’ve asked them already, don’t be tedious”, he said and Martha turned towards him: “The have a wand here, want it checked against the Registry”.
“Don’t talk about Fred”, she said and closed her eyes: “Please”, she sighed: “I’m just starting to like you”.
It was careful at first, cautious as not to startle each other. But then the kiss deepened, lips parting, tongues stealing their way into the others mouth. Malfoy tasted so good, like the cherries he had eaten just now and like freedom and longing.
Martha rolled her eyes but looked up, apparently Mr. Creston was big on practical jokes and she didn’t expect to see Potter waiting there, still smiling, still smelling so darn good.
“Get yourself a coffee or something from the fridge if you’d like, I don’t mind”, Potter said and waved towards the fridge.
“I knew one day you would find your way to my cell”, Lucious said still completely ignoring the other man inside his living quarters: “Every day I’ve waited, four years now, I have waited and I knew one day you would come”, he smiled: “Thank you for coming”.
“A trap he set up in front of the whole class and a teacher?”, Hermione raised one eyebrow: “I don’t think so”.
“Right”, Potter said and nodded: “Mine broke this morning and I can’t really work without one so I need a new one as soon as possible”.
“Thank you”, Draco said and sat down on his chair. It was his mothers handwriting. Dracos heart fluttered, he opened the envelope and took out a single sheet of paper.
Malfoy held up his end of the bargain like a champion. It was awkward in the beginning, Malfoy would go out of his way to avoid Harry as not to have to be nice to him and Harry got more and more annoyed by that. He checked the Marauders Map even more often than before, looking what Malfoy was doing.
He spent the rest of the evening watching Harrys hand stroking through Teddies hair, whispering soothing nothings in his ear from time to time.
“Good afternoon, Gentlemen”, Mr. Burgin said as they entered the store. The store was dark and dusty, only a few lanterns illuminating the storefront.
That’s when he saw them, four dark figures in the middle of the water, floating breathlessly. Harry furrowed his brows and swam closer so he could see who it was.
He thought about telling Harry that his girlfriend was involved in this, he thought about Ginny being taken into custody and felt bad, she had only wanted to help the man she loved.
Harry looked around for Crabbe or Goyle hiding in one of the corners, but all he found were little fairy lights Malfoy must have conjured flying through the black sky.
“I can’t blame you for that”, Draco admitted and took another sip of tea: “Sometimes even I can’t believe how lucky I am”.
The damn mug had haunted Draco’s dreams, he would have recognised it by only looking at a burnt piece of that wonky left ear of that stupid goat. So it was rather unusual that he walked into the workshop and there the old man was, no grudge on his face, stainless and practically odour free knee compress and with a regular sized, simple grey mug in his hands telling nobody what kind of day it would be.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?”, he yelled then, taking a couple of steps back. Draco felt his heart sting at the name.
He took the tape and went over into the kitchen, the gift was almost forgotten. How would he tell Harry? He had to tell him, didn’t he? Or should he just wait until he found it out himself? He wouldn’t believe him. But he could show him the letter. Yes, Draco thought nauseously, he had to tell him, as soon as possible, as soon as they had a minute alone.
“Fuck”, said Draco for the third time this night, he wasn’t a big curser usually but under these circumstances he couldn’t help himself.
“Nothing”, Malfoy said and Harry could hear the smile in his voice. “So do we have a deal?”, Harry asked tensely.
“You don’t know that”, Draco said, he wanted to keep going, wanted to defend his father but the words just wouldn’t come.
“No you won’t”, Garrick said and took a generous sip from his mug: “You’re going to tend to our customer”, he slurped another sip and looked delighted by the flavour: “And I am going to go to my study and brood a bit”.
“Then you’re in great danger”, Draco hurried: “You’re the last master of the Elder wand, whoever fixes it needs to kill you before they can use it themselves”.
“Someone broke into Olivanders”, Draco said and Potter made a note on his notepad: “I went to go confront, or rather detain the person when to my own shame he saw me coming and attacked me. I fought back, of course but the second curse was Avada Kedavra which I took as my cue to relent. He fled and I am here to report the incident”, he ended heavily.
“And how is your position as an Auror suiting you?”, Mr. Creston asked and turned towards Harry again.
“Yes”, Potter smiled cheekily: “It’s a piece of wood with different supernatural cores to channel someone’s magical abilities”, he explained and it made Draco’s toes curl up. He knew that.
What you heard is true, I should inform you of the following events as I am currently in protective custody in Azkaban and long for a friendly word.
“They’re very underrated”, Draco explained while hiding the chosen wand in the highest part of the shelf he could reach: “It serves its master quite nicely if said master is, what do they call it – a knob head?”, he looked down at Potter: “And even better if he is also entitled, moody, vastly overrated and full of himself.”
“Who’s the patient?”, one asked but immediately seemed to focus in on the unconscious person lying over the desk when Potter spoke.
Draco nodded and didn’t trouble himself with explaining that he couldn’t even get a coffee bean out of this machine, let alone freshly brewed coffee.
But Ginny threw her napkin onto the cutlery, a loud chinking sound, and stomped back into the house.
“In here”, Draco said and pointed to the shop. Potter and his partner were looking down the dark alley, the partner yawning loudly as he scoped out his surroundings, Potter seeming alert to any possible dangers lurking in the shadowy distance.
Draco got nervous again: “I actually wanted to talk to you about something”, he said through gritted teeth.
“Yes”, Draco nodded: “I met George inside, the minute I got here. Your children are roaming around here somewhere?”.
“No”, Harry said loudly: “It’s not okay. I fucked up, I was a bad Auror and an even worse friend and I am sorry”.
A wave of guilt hit him like the cold water of the lake but he decided to push the feeling away and himself further into the darkness beneath him.
They woke him up at seven, which was horrible on its own, also horrible was his back, aching from the thin mattress and his sense of pride for being locked up after all.
“How do you do?”, Miss Mortimer said and sat down on an armchair opposite Mr. Burgin: “Let’s get started straight away”, she said and opened her pad.
He looked surprised at first, then delighted: “Thank you”, he said and closed his eyes in the warm breeze: “How very thoughtful of you”.
“I am well, thank you”, Narcissa smiled: “I have been diagnosed with an illness called Menopause”, she disclosed then, seriously.
“His mother, she isn’t his biggest fan, recognised him from the sketch”, Harry explained: “She came to us with the address of his workshop”.
Draco stood up and followed Harry into the kitchen, Ginny was already dressed and sitting in front of a huge coffee mug.
He saw the bright light of a lumos spell wandering over the room and ceiling jerkily as he crept closer.
He put on his pyjama and crawled underneath the blanket. He closed his eyes. He felt Mary Antoinette jump onto his legs, then burrow her head underneath the blanket and rolled up beside his hip.
Lucious let out a deep breath: “I’m sorry”, he said and Draco didn’t know what he was apologising for, the assumption that Draco had done something that would land him in prison or the fact that he had to be protected, that he was in danger.
“Alright”, Harry nodded, feeling a little pang in his chest: “Stop bullying me then”, he said deliberately.
Draco followed Potter into a big living room with high ceilings and a brick coloured sofa in the middle, there was a fire place but no fire was burning and the big fuzzy carpet had the colour of vanilla cream.
And wanting to win he did. He wanted to show everyone that he wasn’t this weak fourteen year old child that couldn’t handle a challenge.
“Alright”, Malfoy said and sat down on the bench again, putting the basket beside him. Harry hesitated a little but then he sat down beside him, far enough away so they wouldn’t accidentally touch.
At 6:25 Malfoy stood up and gathered his belongings, he was shaking now. He took the basket and made the clock disappear with a swish of his wand.
Yes, Draco knew, his own little place was tiny and full of junk but it was his junk at it was his tiny place, it was home.
They walked up the several flights of stairs and Draco tried hard to keep his breathing under control since Harry didn’t seem to be faced by the exercise.
He searched the bottom of the lake for a particularly sharp looking stone and made his way over to Cho.
“Oh yes”, Mr. Burgin nodded vehemently: “There are some families who have supported our business for generations and they still do, new customers are hard to come by”.
Draco cackled: “As if”, he said: “Dumbledore wouldn’t just let us die down there, you ought to know that”.
There was a girl he had never seen but he was sure it would be Fleurs sister, they had the same face, the same silver hair. The second girl was Cho Chang he realized with a pang, her eyes were closed, her hair even more black than normally. Then there was Hermione, hair strangely silky in the water.
“No problem”, Draco said and shoved another cookie into his mouth: “Want one?”, he asked Harry but he only grunted, disgusted.
They stared at each other for a long time. Potter had gotten recognisably taller since (the trial) the last time he’d seen him and Draco didn’t know how that was possible, he had stopped growing when he was 16, 18 the least and here Potter was in his mid twenties and apparently still busy with becoming an even more impressive figure than he already was.
Garrick pranced into the room and coughed up a cloud of dust: “That was very good”, he said completely ignoring Draco’s question.
“Only one wizard was cited as a witness”, she paused and looked at Draco sadly: “His name was Lucious Malfoy”.
They came to a stop in front of yet another wooden door, a big metal number 3 glinted on the doorframe.
Harrys chest ached from longing to touch Malfoy more, he wanted to put his whole hand through the curly hair, he wanted to trace the veins on his hands, wanted to breath him in.
To visit Lucious was not an easy feat. He was incarcerated, in contrast to his son, Lucious had not been lucky enough to get away with probation since he did not have the Holy Potter speak in his defence.
“Martha”, he yelled over to a witch around his age who was sitting behind a big wooden table: “Misters Potter and Malfoy are here for the Wand Registry”.
Draco blushed so much Harry only looked at him, then back at the parcel: “Is this from you, Draco?”.
“Be that as it may”, Harry said: “Both of you have hurt the other, I’m sure you’ll come to an understanding”.
“Honey”, Potter shouted back: “You’re still awake?”. Honey? Draco blinked at Potter. Well this was a development he had not anticipated.
They apparated right in front of the store, the loud bang announcing their arrival cut through the quiet summer night.
“Wait, wait”, Potter said and held up a hand: “You’re not going anywhere right now”, he shook his head: “You’ve just been attacked again, who knows what he’ll try next”.
“I am glad”, Draco said and smiled a sincere smile, Harry stared at him. Draco stared right back. Draco could feel the heat rise in his stomach, could feel it hot and pulsating against his ribs. Harrys eyes were so green, so very green and wild and beautiful, he thought he might drown in them. He wet his lips and Harrys eyes darted down towards his mouth, his own lips parted slightly and Draco could see the tip of Harrys tongue stealing itself outside and wetting his lips. It was all a bit too much. They were very close, so close indeed that Draco only would have to lean in slightly and their lips would touch. Draco wanted desperately to lean in, to taste his companion, sweet and hot against his lips.
He waded through the rubble towards the workshop. It was a small room with a wooden workbench the size of a queen sized bed in the middle, there was a carving station with chisels and gouges and knifes and something that looked like a weaving loom for the preparation and processing of different wand cores.
“Yes, yes”, Potter said and took a couple of steps toward the counter: “It’s the darndest thing, I wanted to take it out this morning, to polish you know, I think it’s very important to take meticulous care of your wand, don’t you? They are rather underrated in general, wands I mean, without them we can’t do much but when I think about how I treated mine back when I was younger, and they’re expensive as well”, he took in a shaky breath: “not that they’re not worth the cost, that’s not what I meant, they’re rather magnificent, Olivanders in particular”, he trailed off: “Don’t you think?”, he said then with a dignified look of finality on his face.
“Very well”, Potter said and put his wand into his pocket: “Then let’s go and look at the crime scene”, he stood up, crumpled up a thick piece of paper and threw it against the sleeping mans head.
Draco spent his Saturday trying to stop his cat from destroying his furniture and had gone to bed late after reading a new book about wandlore that was both intriguing and dull as can be, the weird mixture that makes you too interested to lay a book down yet too bored to really pay much attention.
Potter blushed a little at that and it made his freckles stand out from his pale face: “I’m working towards entering the task force later this year, but I had to work myself up like every new guy straight out of the apprenticeship”, he sighed: “I don’t get as much special treatment as you may think I do, you know”.
The walk from Draco’s apartment to Ollivander’s store took seven minutes and left him with exactly enough time to buy himself a croissant with apricot jam at Marrilow’s Magic Bakery (he wasn’t quite sure where the magic came to play) for his breakfast and heard the bell on Ollivander’s Store entry jingle at exactly 8 am at which point he would be giddy and anxious to start his day.
Harry sighed: “It wasn’t great Draco”, he said and put his glass on the coffee table: “I lived with my Aunt and Uncle, they had a son too, Dudley”, he shuddered: “They didn’t like me much, you know”.
“How very observant of you”, Potter said and let go of his arm: “Thought it was safer that way”, he explained: “Also more anonymous”.
Draco sat there petting his cat and felt unnaturally not out of place, he somehow felt like belonging here in this fancy apartment he would never have been able to afford, just a few meters away from Harry Potter who was humming happily while pouring the wine and it felt all so very not strange that it was most peculiar.
So when the shrill alarm went off at 3:37 am on the right side of his head Draco was rather grumpy and reluctant to address it.
“He is very proud”, Draco said: “At least when I saw him last, you will do good to appeal to his pride”.
The sensation was as unpleasant as it was quick and he didn’t want to imagine how confused and scared his cat had to be right now. She had never apparated before, obviously.
“Mr. Burgin”, Harry said as he walked over to them: “May I introduce Miss Mary Mortimer to you, she will sketch the man you are describing”.
What was happening here? This was all sorts of peculiar. Was he bantering? Just having a playful bicker with Harry Potter.
Harry tried to look away, but he couldn’t. That would have made him seem weak and insecure and unsure of his actions, he didn’t want to give Malfoy any ammunition for his insults.
Again Potter seemed to be surprised by words being spoken: “Yes, good night”, he nodded vividly: “It is late”.
Boy was his new name, had there been name cards for Garrick’s employees Draco would have put all his money, his cat, his rather modest remainders of dignity and best leather loafers on his reading Boy, nothing more, nothing less. He had forgiven the old man for that not because he felt deep down that Garrick knew his actual name (Draco was rather certain he didn’t) but because of one instant three weeks into his studies. It had been the first of those days and Garrick had howled and wailed and whined himself tired and when Draco had finished cleaning up the shop at about half past one in the morning he had put the old man into bed and in a sleep- and pain-filled moment Garrick had confessed to him the wish for a son, a boy of his own, that he had said.
Harry stopped abruptly and turned towards Draco: “Listen, if I thought you had anything to do with this I would not let you come, but you might be my best chance to get Lucious to open up, you’re coming with me, or is that a problem?”.
Draco sat up and put Mary in his lap, he looked up at Potter with his steaming mug of coffee and a broad grin on his face.
“He would have gotten a better price at the store, if we’re lucky Mr. Burgin still remembers who sold it to him or who bought it afterwards”, Harry said and went towards the Leaky Cauldron again.
He heard muffled laughter from the window and went over to a small door that led out into the garden. He stepped outside onto dry grass and winced against the bright sunlight. He held a hand over his eyes to shade his face and looked around. There was a huge table on the far side of the garden with seats for at least thirty people, big bright balloons were magically flying in place over the lawn and fairy lights were buzzing over his head.
“Well if Potter and Malfoy can get along there is hope for all of us, isn’t there?”, she laughed: “There is the chance that my family will someday be forgiven too”.
“It will only take a few minutes”, Martha said and went back towards her table: “Please have some tea and biscuits while you wait”.
He signed at Cho, than back at his own chest. Harry frowned. Cedric signed again, took out his wand and sliced through Chos ropes with ease, Harry just stood there and watched he two of them vanish into the darkness.
Then he waited. For something. Anything. But the hours ticked by and the store stayed empty and Garrick became more and more grumpy with every obnoxiously loud click on the clock telling them another eventless minute had passed by.
The warden, a young woman, smiled at him: “Of course, Mr. Malfoy”, she said and Dracos heart fluttered, she was being nice to him.
Thick teardrops plopped on the letter when Draco was done reading it. He had seldom felt this alone.
The woman blinked at him: “No sorry”, she said: “I don’t have any wrapping paper, only during the holidays”.
The voice of a woman announced that they had arrived at the second story and Harry, Mr. Creston and Draco went out of the elevator.
“Well I’ll have to check if we have any”, he said to his own surprise and – worse of all – a small grin curling his lips.
“Indeed he will”, Harry walked over towards them along the huge table: “Hey kiddo”, he pulled a laughing Teddy into a hug.
“My name is Draco Malfoy and I need to report a crime”, he said and stood on his heels. This was all taking very long.
The rest of the afternoon went by in a blur, Harry unwrapped the rest of his gifts, then Molly brought out a huge dinner nobody really needed anymore and after that Arthur brought out the booze (the kids were already asleep on their dads laps, or in Teddies case, his godfathers lap) and Draco saw his Cognac in between two bottles of Firewhiskey.
Draco blushed a little but he kept the wand where it was and watched Harrys hair ruffle in the breeze, he smelt him too, so young and fresh and sweet.
“I see”, Draco said and looked her straight in the eyes. Her eyes narrowed slightly. Then she looked away and took another sip of coffee.
The island came into few a couple hundred meters in front of them, large and imposing, dark and worn by the weather.
Hermione rolled her eyes: “Do what you must”, she said and turned back towards Ron to, presumably resume their conversation.
But he wasn’t as lucky and on the fourth day he slowly came to terms with the fact that Potter wasn’t about to just appear on his doorstep and ask for more stuff just so Draco could apologise. Also the more days went by without Potter coming in the less convinced he became that Potter had sought out his company in the first place.
Draco shot up from his chair behind the table and looked straight into the shocked green eyes of Harry Potter.
Of course he did. Probably the only one aside from Goyle that still visits Vincent Crabbe’s grave since his father was imprisoned and his mother died three years ago. He and Goyle were loyal friend of his for many years, and Draco had always felt responsible for Crabbe’s death as he didn’t steer him to the right way.
He sat on the couch, feeling the buzzing of alcohol and agony tore through his whole being; in the end, he made a decision.
Draco remained still, in case it was just a bluff, but a second kidnapper added: ‘The effect of the stunning spell should be over by now. Shall I test it with a Crucio?’
He stood up to leave, and Draco suddenly panicked, he scrambled forward, reaching for him, hoping to get back the lost intimacy: ‘Look, Potter, I’m sorry about it. I didn’t…’
There was a light pink blush on Draco’s cheeks as he leaned in for a second time, kissed the man on his forehead and held him close: ‘There’s… there’s this song mother used to sing to me when I couldn’t sleep. Have um, have anyone ever sing you a lullaby before?’
‘What did you learn?’ After the potion was absorbed and his arse felt warm again, Potter’s hand left him, Draco turned back a little, seeing that Potter had picked up the cane again.
‘No, of course, it’s fine.’ Hermione said quickly as she cast a few private spells at the carriage, and passed the man a brown paper folder, ‘This is the newest intelligence on Harry’s security. You might want to read this as soon as possible.’
And that was the last sign, Draco sighed and let the name roll off his tongue: ‘It’s been so long —— Good to see you alive, Vincent Crabbe.’
Draco had thought that would be what life was going to be like for the rest of his life, walking on the line of grey between black and white, until he got a weird firecall one day, from the Aurors Department, saying he was hired to represent a pureblood witch.
Elise smiled apologetically, then passed Draco another set of silver accessories with engravings of narcissus including a hair ring, and suggested: ‘You want to surprise him? Maybe you should take a hair growing potion and wear your hair long. You would look stunning.’
The cold and him initiating the hold-hand painted Draco’s cheeks a lovely pink, and he was smiling timidly, the last snow of the past year was falling fast, soon ladened his hair and eyelashes with shining snowflakes.
‘At least you have my consent. And you take care of me.’ Draco said, his cheeks pink, ‘I just feel… I don’t know. That you are much more than this. You are a good man.’
And he was afraid. He knew he was just postponing the inevitable and making it worse for himself, but the worse his punishment gets, the more he refused to face it: ‘This is not fair.’
The man was busy with his gauntlets and answered with a smile without looking up: ‘Yeah. It’s my favourite sport. Why, you want a seekers game before our scene?’
Draco looked up and saw Elise’s funny expression, then laughed a little: ‘No. not like that. I didn’t cheat on anyone. It’s… complicated. I had a crush on that man, and he knows it.’
The man was thoughtful, but laughed at Draco’s last sentence, at some secret Draco didn’t know, in a cat stole a fish kind of way: ‘That… that actually made a lot of sense.’
Potter nodded, settling himself in Draco’s arms, his hand caressed Draco’s face, and just like that, Draco felt safe and relaxed.
Omegas usually rut once every month, with a period variation between one day to three days, but the mysterious Omega frequented the wall a lot more. Some maliciously suspected that he was just a slut like that, but Harry knew better. The Omega just had irregular rutting periods. Therefore, it’s easier for him to be there first every time.
Draco’s uniform on the other hand, was probably showing him in a different contrast. The robe was pushed up and the trousers were dropped to pool around his knees, and this was somehow more embarrassing than completely naked. He already received a spanking delivered by hand on his bare arse for his disobedience earlier, not enough to be painful, just tingling, and hot. Potter stopped when his arse showed the perfect lovely pink.
Then he took the bottle of yogurt, took a big gulp and fell back down onto the bed; he was quiet for a while, then he said: ‘Can’t I just be in love with the normal guy James and didn’t want the whole charade of ex-death eater dating the Saviour?’
Before he gets to the dessert though, he saw the man blending the chocolate and the orange cream together, but he had the wine glass to his mouth and was too late to stop him. Both Pansy and Blaise couldn’t help but showed a trace of contempt.
Potter ran his hand down his back, checking Draco for one more time, then landed the last three strikes in rapid succession, so it’s easier on Draco. Draco screamed, his hands lost its grip, only stayed in place because he was chained there tight.
He wondered for a second what Potter could have sent him, but soon gave up as he really didn’t know Potter that well.
Pansy snorted as she shoves Witch Weekly into his face again: ‘Well then, you are doing a fantastic job at it, getting all the press without actually dating him. Tell me, is it any consolation finding out you’ve actually been dating Potter while all these troubles happened? If Potter really was that good in bed…’
Ziegler used quite a few checking spells on him, as there’s no telling what the Crucios might have damaged; Draco was just lying there, quite bored, so he asked: ‘Potter knew you from the hospital first, didn’t he. He used to irritate the hell out of madame Pomfrey, because she had to fix him again and again, year after year. One of her most frequent, I believe.’
The warmth of the tea made Draco felt more like himself instantly: ‘Didn’t go to Hogwarts I take it?’
That phrase stung a little, Draco couldn’t say yes, just turned his face angrily: ‘We are only pretending we are dating because we can’t tell people I’m your sex slave. We are not dating. I can’t break up with you.’
It’s how it had always been with Potter; Potter enjoyed making Draco chose between two kinds of torture, each time Draco was overwhelmed by the pain, Potter gave him the tender and unsatisfying rimming, and the strikes would hurt more on a thoroughly tongue-fucked and sensitive arsehole.
And as the vision dissipated, Draco could see Harry, standing before him, with the same ridiculously large bouquet in his hand.
‘Why the fuck did you listen to him?’ Draco shouted as Rosier loosened his hold, his eyes burning as he stared at Potter, ‘He lured you here to kill you. Fuck you Potter, I told you to go.’
During Draco’s previous stay, the only thing they hadn’t tried out was the canes. Draco wasn’t exactly afraid of them anymore, knowing Potter would never really hurt him badly with them, but he wasn’t exactly fond of them. And since he never made any severe transgressions back then, Potter deemed it unnecessary to use canes on him. Now, Draco gets a general idea. The thicker cane carried duller but heavier pain, involving more flesh, and though thinner canes were lighter, they bit into the flesh, and caused sharper pain. There’s really no easier way to put when it comes to canes, just a painful choice between heavier strikes or sharper bites, and balancing the two just means getting both rather than none.
“Would you like to say hi?”, she asked him and without waiting for an answer she yelled: “Teddy! Would you come over here for a second?”.
“You have a cat?”, Potter chuckled: “Didn’t take you for a pet guy, but then again a cat suits you, just as proud, just as impolite”.
“Potter”, a red haired man laughed and came over, almost tripping over a little girl: “Roxanne, would you be careful please”, he said laughingly and came over to hug Harry.
“Mr. Malfoy”, Harry said with a shy smile: “Good to see you in good health”, he said then and Draco admired him for being so nonchalant about this.
Potter cleared his throat and breathed in deeply: “Hello”, he said then, with a somewhat wonky smile.
“So it’s true?”, she asked him, staring into him with bewildered force: “That you changed, that you’re good now?”.
“It is indeed”, Harry said with a smile. How could he be so consistently smiling? It sure must hurt his mouth after a while.
Draco felt himself becoming lightheaded and hastily put the parchment back where he had found it, securing the board again.
He tried to imagine the Weasley girl as a criminal mastermind and couldn’t. No he was quite sure she hadn’t wanted anyone to get harmed, sure she had just invested her trust in the wrong man who had taken things into his own hands without her consent.
The spray was dripping down Dracos cheeks where he stood in the front of the boat, looking out at the waves crashing against each other in the high wind.
They were silent for a while, both hanging on to their own thoughts, occasionally Harry would sigh, put his hands through his hair, other than that he was silent.
Draco turned towards her and smiled: “Hello Angelina”, he said and held out his hand, she shook it with a grin.
He wouldn’t miss Malfoy. Not at all. He couldn’t count the times he had wished this bastard to disappear and now there was his chance.
“It must be nice to have a proper family now”, Draco said: “With the Weasleys”, he nodded towards a family photo of the Weasleys with Harry around Christmas time. They were all wearing matching holiday sweaters.
“I’m sorry”, Draco said and looked down on his lap where Mary Antoinette had curled up and stared at him expectantly.
Draco looked at him with bewilderment: “Just levitate it”, he said and pressed the trunk closed with a silent groan.
Speak again, Draco pleaded internally, speak again so I know who you are. But the man remained silent. He pointed his wand towards Draco and Draco flinched his eyes shut in preparation for the next curse.
“He might be dangerous”, Weasley was hissing now and Draco was perfectly offended. He couldn’t think of the last time he might have been dangerous, not even in his darkest days he had the guts to seriously hurt someone, not even when the Dark Lord was looking over his shoulder, demanding blood. So the thought that he might be dangerous, might hurt someone was equally hurtful as it is ridiculous.
“She’s been looking at you lovingly for the last ten minutes”, Potter said and Dracos eyes snapped open: “I’ve never thought I would see someone looking at you like that, congratulations”.
Draco looked around him, now he needed something to wrap this with, he looked through the high bookshelves but nothing seemed to fit. He looked at the books, there were two whole rows of muggle crime novels, some non fiction, some autobiographies, some spell books, he even saw Harrys old school books, but nothing to wrap his gift with.
That meant it was not only morning, it was also a worse morning and one with flared up knees on top of it, but that wasn’t the end of Garrick’s suffering, his hurting knees were now also probably baking under a thick layer of otherwise useless cloth which had to worsen the pain and keep Ollivander painfully sober through the lack of white rum fog that normally filled the air. Why then was his employer so very excited?
They had taken his wand, safety precaution, they couldn’t risk one of the prisoners get a hold of one. Draco sighed. He thought of Harrys lips on his, he thought of sunflowers and wondered if Harry had kept the ones he had given him. He fell asleep.
When the cake was almost gone and everyone was holding their belly, groaning in satisfaction, Molly vanished the dirty plates and shouted: “Time for presents”.
The first one had not been great, Draco had to admit, it had been wonky and a bit too bad tempered to sell, so had his second and third wand. But his fourth had been okay, great for experienced wizards who didn’t shy away from a challenge. The wands he made today were spectacular. At least Draco thought so, Garrick was almost satisfied with his results.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?”, Draco asked one last time, weighing the notepad in his fingers.
“Then we talk to the people who might now of something going on, we go to Azkaban”, Harry shrugged and Draco gasped.
“I have sources”, Potter sighed: “And I’ve had my suspicions for a while now”, he put his hand through his unruly hair.
The shop was as he had left it, no light was shining through the locked door, no noise came through the high windows.
“Speech! Speech!”, he heard them chant dully through the sound of his own blood rushing through his veins but Harry was kneeling in front of him.
A man looked out at them, thirtyfive years old maybe and with a big scar on his cheek that ran down from his right eye to the corner of his mouth.
“Maybe not”, he said: “But let me tell you as someone who does not have the luxury of parents, you will be sorry for casting them out once you have lost them completely”.
It became harder and harder to breathe all of a sudden, he tried to keep the smile on his face but it didn’t surprise him when Harry leant down and whispered: “Draco, are you okay?”.
The man said, pulling out a black and red riveted furry leather collar that was buried behind the pillows, dangling it on his finger, making its chain clutter. Draco was more than turned on, he swung his arms around the man’s neck, and tilted his head seductively: ‘Gladly, sir.’
Extra punishment. Even more if he didn’t follow the man’s orders quick. It didn’t seem like a good idea to start his second punishment with the extra punishment that had him crying and begging last time.
He made a split-second decision, ditched his broom and jumped to Potter’s embrace, his hand reaching behind Potter as if to hold him.
It wasn’t difficult to find the right room as the doors all had a gigantic number with relievo of rose thorns and snake molded of gold on them, as he approached, the snake raised its head and asked: ‘Passsssword——”
‘Well, I kind of was.’ Potter said, ‘But I died and got rid of it ten years ago… long story. Anyway, no, he’s permanently dead.’
‘The way you talked and acted, was so much like him.’ Draco said slowly, ‘But you were trained to pretend to be him, right? The shampoos and perfumes, I presume you used the same. So what, you spent a lot of time with him, you became friends, and you told him that?’
‘What the…’ Draco quickly took Potter’s hand in his, pulled out his wand and cast a healing spell at Potter’s wrist, ‘What in the name of Merlin was that?’
On his way up, he thought that maybe years later, he would still remember the feeling of ascending those stairs.
Draco arched a brow and continued: ‘For those who wasn’t a trained Auror and caught up as fast as you did, Potter, please remind us what was the one thing broken in the study where the deceased and my defendant was found?’
Potter settled Draco over his lap, stroked Draco’s arse in circles for a few times, and brought his hand down. Draco groaned a little at the pain, and shifted on Potter’s lap.
Before he lost his lucidity, Harry moved right on top of him, those emerald eyes looked down straight into his eyes, sneered with a bit of white cum by his reddened lips, the glints in his emerald eyes were both lazy and aggressive, like a contained lion and a child waiting for a compliment.
He wasn’t in a good mood, stayed at the manor for his mother but left all his gifts untouched and took a long shower. He felt better when he got out of the shower, and that’s when he heard a tapping sound on his windowsill.
Draco’s eyes shot to that Slytherin green present with sliver bow tie in mother’s hands, and snatched it from mother’s hands as fast as it wouldn’t be suspicious. Everything from James felt too intimate for mother to hold.
Draco remembered that room, and his question about it: ‘What is it? That room. That can’t be the room of requirement.’
‘Well, I lost my entire belt.’ Potter said, his tone carefully humourous and regretful, ‘I kind of liked that one.’
The man was still pissed at him, Draco was sure of it because he woke up nice and clean, his wounds taken care of, but he was in the
The man raised his hand without looking and caught the ball with ease, then he gestured Draco to stretch out his left hand, and placed the ball in Draco’s palm.
‘You are unbelievable!’ Pansy threw a blueberry at Draco, ‘Is this how much Potter spoiled you, Draco? I feel bad for him, really.’
‘Not his fault. Mine.’ Draco said, his fingers went white at the strength he was using, ‘The first time I saw him in ten years, I made a horrible mistake and almost got him and his family and friends killed. You know what he did? He trusted me. When I saw the evidence, even I had a moment of doubt whether I did it. That Saint posted my fucking bail and personally saved my arse with that beautiful patronus of his. Why? I would like to ask why! Why in the name of Merlin he did what he did. Because I apologised, and we are friends now? Friends? So easily and he would do so much for me? Why was he so nice to me? Why did he invite me into his house? He shouldn’t… I don’t deserve it.’
It felt good actually, to love someone when you knew your love was as true and sincere as it could be, and you were the right choice, a better choice than all others, to the one you love.
Harry felt the Omega’s right hand in his hair, trembling, carding his messy black curls with those long, pale fingers, not to grab his hair and keep him there, but gently shoved Harry away.
The hippogriff was a large beast, so there was enough room on its back for Draco to sit without being too close to Potter. Draco hasn’t sat down since Potter’s speech as his arse was still swollen and painful, but he was an experienced horse rider due to his education as the Malfoy heir, so he duplicated a saddle for himself, supported his weight with his legs and sat gingerly. Potter didn’t say anything about that, just extended the harness with a wordless wandless spell and passed it to Draco, then leaned down, patted the hippogriff and said something in its ear.
Realisation appeared in the man’s eyes. He then arched a brow, emerald eyes looking only at Draco and asked curiously: ‘What makes you think that wasn’t punishment? I for one, would find cuming by humping my victim of bullying while being spanked like a little boy quite humiliating.’
He got his fucked, swollen arsehole licked and sucked again, this time even more brutal, he could feel Harry eating his arse out, cleaning it of every last drop of his own cum, dragging his sharp canine over the sensitive flesh, even nipped and pulled at it.
He was——as embarrassing as it was——a virgin, and keeping his powerful Alpha at bay wasn't as easy as he thought it would be when he was lost in such intense pleasure. At some point, he registered his nails had grown into claws and broke the Omega's skin by his hard grip, ten points of bleeding stark on the Omega's alabaster skin, but it just somehow aroused him more. He managed to mutter an apology before he picked up a more brutal rhythm, pounding into the Omega; he could feel the Omega writhing under it; if Harry could hear him, he would be sobbing and whimpering. Reluctantly, Harry took a deep breath, forced himself to pull together, retracted his claws and changed his motion.
The man clad his hand over the dark mark and kept his tone soft: ‘When we talked earlier, you kept saying you don’t think you deserve or worth…’
‘This is supposed to be punishment, and I…’ Draco was shaking. He clung onto the man’s knees as if it were his lifeline.
‘Unlike you, I don’t have a habit of breaking curfew and wandering hallways at night.’ Malfoy said as he collected the potion into a vial, ‘Really, Potter, what would your Gryffindor friends, your precious little girlfriend, and your loyal people think about you, consorting with
The man was kissing and biting down on his neck and shoulder, his hands roaming Draco’s body, pinching and pulling his pink nipples till they are hot, hard and red like rubies then press them back into the cold glass, he cast a few more hexes, leaving Draco’s arse hot red and swollen as his fingers stroked and pulled at Draco’s arsehole roughly, forcing their way inside. Draco was incredibly aroused, moaning loud, screaming and trembling even as the man’s fingers hit his prostate and Potter’s eyes somehow glanced over his direction.
Ten minutes past since Draco had gotten that damned memory ball in his hands and he still couldn’t figure out what he forgot.
The man shortened Draco’s chain before sleep, and it wouldn’t let him get off the bed, but Draco’s movement woke the man anyway. The man tugged Draco in tight and pulled on a green sweatshirt and pants before he opened the window, and a condescending looking eagle owl flew in with a gust of cold wind. If the man didn’t have impressive reflexes, that eagle owl would have landed in his hair.
‘No, I stayed for you, because you are an idiot who can’t see anything you don’t want to see even if I shove it in your face.’ Pansy stared daggers at Draco, then her eyes softened, ‘I need to keep an eye for you. That’s what Slytherins do for each other. They look after their own. And it doesn’t hurt to open up a business here in London.’
'I didn't understand… I couldn't understand.' Draco pressed his forehead against the man's, and the man immediately picked him up as Draco's mental wall came crippling down, and all the messy images and emotions poured out like waterfall as the dam collapsed.
The circle was activated the second Potter was in there; glowing purple chains reached out and pulled Potter till he knelt on the ground. The restraints on Draco were broken the second Potter was locked into place, Draco scrambled over, trying to reach for Potter, but the circle had an invisible barrier preventing any intrusion; all Draco could do was pound at the invisible wall of magic.
Draco probably didn’t, but it’s better to let Forgecount think he lied to make Lovegood happy than he was crazy, so Draco kept his mouth shut.
Maybe the man had incredible endurance, maybe Draco was really bad at blow jobs, it took him a while to get the man near his orgasm. By then Draco’s jaw was sore, he could feel his saliva tainting his chin.
He gave one last hard suck, and Draco was coming in his mouth, moaning so loud that he could hear his own voice echoing in the Quidditch field.
The man wrapped Draco up in the blanket and let Draco lay over his laps, comforting Draco by stroking his hair and back as if Draco were a cat: ‘I did go to Hogwarts. And I’m about your age. It wasn’t so hard to know something like that about the Slytherin Prince.’
Draco had wanted to say no, but the man just grabbed his hand and pulled him out of his seat, and there’s something in his gut telling Draco he should go, so he would be free of the shadow that’s been looming over them lately, and he eventually followed compliantly.
‘What’s the point of having a bed if you don’t use it?’ Draco propped himself up on his elbows and looked up at Potter, his eyes teasing and provocative.
Draco snorted a laugh sarcastically: ‘That’s high hopes of me. Or maybe I don’t want to deal with his trouble.’
‘Oh, my poor boy.’ She cried as she pushed his hair behind his ear, kissing his forehead as she saw him came to, ‘What you suffered…!’
Potter struggled to look at him before he apparated away, his emerald eyes sad and Draco felt as if they tore something from his chest.
‘Yeah.’ Rosier sighed, ‘He really thought he was the leader of the group. Poor man, really, he thought he was going to be Lord’s right-hand man after we bring him back, and Lord will heal his scars, bring his mother back from death and free his father from Azkaban. He actually cared about you, you know? He was going to credit you for bringing down Harry so that you would be a high ranking death eater again.’
The first night Potter brought it up was forever imprinted in Draco’s memory, something he would always cherish, but in the few years after that, he forced himself not to think about it, warning himself that it might just be a joke, and there’s no way he would ever bring it up to make Potter marry him or anything anyway.
The man was tentative: ‘Well, to be fair, it’s a really nice arse to save. Maybe you gave him too much credit. His motivation might be simpler than that.’
‘No.’ Rosier smiled; the smile was almost impossibly dark on his handsome face, ‘Harry’s going to rush here, thinking that you need him, and walk right into the trap.’
‘You know, just making sure your pretty boy’s alright. You seemed a bit out of it lately.’ Ruby said with a little smile, ‘Your sub is cute, but a handful. There’s also something I would like to talk to him about.’
It took Draco quite some courage to go to the dungeon again. This time, he saw a lot of things he made himself ignore.
Ruby might not have been able to receive Draco’s pleading look through the curtain, but she definitely knew Draco had hoped she would let him off easier, and could hear it in his voice. However, much to Draco’s fright, she sighed and said with just a touch of apologetic and a lot of amusement: ‘Sorry, pretty boy. You deserve this.’
Draco gave Elise a raise as apparently, her job's content expanded to picking out her boss’s dating outfit now.
He was shaking, and as soon as the man opened the door, Draco was leaning into him, and the man held him and sat down at the couch, allowing him to lie on his laps and curl up on the couch.
Rosier struggled to look up, fixed his eyes on Potter, and spoke coldly: ‘Is there anything you would like to say to me?’
He could have been sitting on the bench by the tree for a while, but probably had a notice-me-not charm cast, and frankly, he wasn’t the kind to stand out in a crowd —— he was only moderately good-looking, not exactly handsome but had a face that people would feel comfortable looking at forever. He had dark brown hair that was almost black if it weren’t for the bright sunshine of the afternoon, messy in a cute way, and common brown eyes framed by a pair of gold-rimmed square spectacles. He was wearing khaki woolen wind coat, brown suit pants and coffee scarf, made him look like a mild gentleman, proper but humble. Since there were still a few minutes till their scheduled time, there was no rush for him, and he was watching the traffic with joyful lights dancing in his eyes and drinking from one of the two coffee cups in his hands.
