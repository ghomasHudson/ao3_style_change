From within the garden Harry can hear Malfoy’s quiet murmurings and can feel the magic of the plants responding—something he’s become more attuned to under the guidance of Professor Olarinmoye. He couldn’t say what these plants are, despite or perhaps because of years of being decidedly mediocre at herbology, though he’s reasonably certain most of them he’s never seen before.
“Help me get them out,” Harry pleaded.
“I’m Elio Durand, and welcome back to
‘We were just fooling around. But… he wanted more. And I didn’t. He kept pressuring me… that night he- he forced me- I didn’t- Couldn’t- He just didn’t take no for an answer.’
‘You could kiss me now,’ I say eventually. ‘Since we’re not fucking.’
I breathe him in and then open my eyes to watch him leaning back against me.
‘Oh for Salazar’s sake, just call her Pansy.’
‘You did so good, Harry…’
He cards his fingers through his hair. It’s his tell.
‘I do. I know.’
‘There are better ways to go, you know?’
I say this in my best casual tone. His leg all but freezes. I keep going.
It catches me off guard, of course it does.
Lips brush his. Warm. Light.
‘You did so good, Harry… so, so good…’
‘No…’ Harry took a deep breath, allowing himself to fall down into it. It was like allowing gravity. It felt just right, unavoidable. Malfoy was waiting, his scent so overwhelming Harry wanted to drown in it.
You turn on your bed, completely dressed. Shadows play on your walls. You should get undressed, but it’s too much trouble.
He shifts beside you, turning around and leaning against the balustrade. It occurs to you he’s doing it so the smoke doesn’t bother you.
His first impulse was saying love had nothing to do with it. This was fucking. Not even that, this was tying up a man and showing him his rightful place at his feet. This was… Malfoy and Potter. Impossible. Crazy. Dreamlike.
I don’t know what I’m going to say until it’s out.
‘I’m really no good at flirting. Or words. Or Christmas surprises,’ Potter says.
Harry moaned freely, something in his control loosening up, his eyes trained on the movement of Draco’s hands.
‘I only want one thing. Let go. Do it for me, Harry.’ Malfoy’s fingers tightened around his cock, circling it perfectly and he pumped him once, twice.
‘That I would be open to the idea of an exclusive romantic relationship with you. Yes.’
‘Merlin, you know it.’
‘Why do you always have to play the hero? Save me from the fire, now save me from - what?-’ I’m shouting. My voice is not my own.
‘Yes, Malfoy, I want to be yours for tonight.’
‘Listen up, you golden fuck.’
‘He’s hurt?’
But he didn’t even know how to end that sentence. What he wanted right now was for Draco to stop time and stay. What he wanted right now was to know if Draco felt like his world had been shaken and torn and turned upside down. Because Harry’s had and he didn't know how to put it back together. How to make it the way it was before. Before this.
Harry swallowed his come.
Draco turned his smirk to Josh, all the while feeling Harry’s eyes on his face. Harry wouldn't look away, only if he was told to.
‘You’re guessing wrong.’
‘I didn’t have to.’ I lie. ‘Some of your fans were happy to quote it by heart.’
‘I would,’ Harry said. Draco didn’t know what he was talking about - his loud thoughts or his previous provocation, but he didn’t fucking care.
‘And if he were to touch me…’ he took Josh’s hand and pulled it around him, dropping it to his lower back, close to the swell of his arse, knowing Harry’s eyes would be there, transfixed. ‘You’d probably go crazy, wouldn’t you,
The first place where he kisses you is your neck. It’s soft, barely there, but it makes you gasp. Your hands catch on his arms and his lips are warm, trailing down your neck, over your shoulder and up again, his hands on your hips, on the loops of your trousers, pushing you closer. His breath on your neck, his warm tongue there, so sweet. You bite down a moan, he pulls you flush together. You were never this aware of getting slowly hard. It’s always been something you notice after the fact. But now you are aware of the way there, and of him, getting there too.
You hit his prostate.
So, I wasn't planning on this, but Draco's POV sort of happened. Hope you like it!
I was surprised that, of all the things, he wanted me.
‘I trained his gag reflex,’ Josh said, in between deep breaths, his hand on Harry’s hair, pressing him down on his cock so that his whole length was being sucked in. ‘See? He loves gagging on it,’ Josh added, and his hips pistoned up. Harry didn’t resist any of it. He let his mouth be fucked, spit trailing down his lips, over Josh’s cock, his breath harsh, his jaw slack.
I swear I didn’t mean to ask this, but it comes out matter-of-factly, like I’m asking about the weather. I regret it as soon as the words leave my mouth and wish to take them back. He frowns in confusion.
He turns his face and kisses my fingers softly.
You reach the balustrade, your hands on the cold stone. Down bellow, the trees form long dark shapes like a garden of stone. You can breathe for the first time in hours.
‘I want to be so good for you…’ Harry curled his fingers around Draco’s cock. He gave it a gentle pull.
‘If I were you I’d finish inside his hole,’ Draco drawled, and heard Harry whimper.
‘It’s not like you think, Harry,’ he said slowly.
I take a step towards him. His eyes rake my face. There’s a wall of warmth rising before me, his whole body barely an inch away. I feel his all-encompassing need to touch me, so I edge him on.
And, as it turns out, Harry Potter is definitely my cup of tea.
Draco was smirking back before he could stop himself.
He was barely aware of Malfoy moving to release the restraints on his ankles and then coming up to do the same on his wrists. Was it over then? The sobs were rising on his throat and he didn’t want to, he didn’t mean to cry, he had loved every second of it and if Malfoy said it was over he had to accept that. Maybe Malfoy already had what he wanted from him, maybe this was exactly what he’d meant from the beginning: to leave Harry desperate and wanting and unsatisfied,
‘I… I’m not easy, Harry,’ Draco said. He gave a wry laugh at his own understatement. ‘But this… I don’t want to walk away from this. Whatever this is. I left that night because I thought it was the right thing for you. But now… I can’t- I fucking walked away from everything in my life and now I can’t. Because I’ve had you.’
Darkness erases distance, you think. That’s what it does. It brings everything close.
Harry withdrew his hand, but he had the hint of that half-smile tugging at his lips. Draco noticed the small dimple forming on his cheek. He couldn’t think clearly.
‘‘Cause you have bad taste in hair?’
He yanked his eyes up again. Malfoy was still looking at him, eyes unreadable, shadows playing across the hard angles of his face. God, Harry wanted to kiss him. And much more. He wanted to draw all that fire out. How did he never notice Draco Malfoy was this fucking beautiful? But he
‘You should wear this everyday,’ Draco said, the words carrying between them. His fingers trailed over the metal ring. ‘Only this.’
‘When Harry sets his mind to something, or
‘What do I need to do for you to stop this charade and fuck me?’ I walk over to him, and pull my sweater off, drop it to the floor, and then start on the buttons on my shirt. ‘Do you want a show, Harry?’ I ease two buttons open and let my hands trail down my chest and stomach and then I cup myself through my trousers.
‘The next time my mouth touches your cock, I want you to come.’
‘Obedience. I come only if you let me, if you order me to. You already know my limits. You can have anyone fuck me, I’ll do anything for you.’
‘Did you… did you like it, Josh? Was I good?’ his voice came out in a rasp. He’d never asked this. Not like this anyway. He’d almost forgotten all about Josh during the play, he felt guilty and couldn’t process it, his mind was racing. He let his head fall against Josh’s chest, his hand tightening on his shirt.
‘I want to help-’
‘He told you,’ he said. His voice sounded detached, mainly to put some distance between himself and the staccato rhythm of his heart.
He’s already there, of course. As I knew he would be.
‘Josh asked you a question.’
‘Would you like that, Draco?’
He moans into your neck, his fingers dig into your shoulder blades. He shifts, and impatiently pushes your hand down, your fingers finding his hole. He closes his eyes, murmurs a sequence of spells for protection, deep in concentration. His magic rubs against your skin, makes you heady.
It was like any other night at the club. Josh had been having fun torturing Harry’s nipples, for almost half an hour, the clamps shining brightly against Harry’s chest, sweat trickling down his skin, making Draco want to lean in and slowly lick those beads of sweat. He remembered Harry’s taste, his scent. He craved it.
My hand lifts of its own accord and I don’t know its purpose until my fingers close around his neck. His eyes widen, he gasps. But he does nothing to break free of my grip.
- over & over again.
‘Yes, fuck, please,’ he bucked back, exposing his arse as best as he could for the cane. He wanted Malfoy to give it to him. He could feel his skin breaking where the cane hit. There was blood, he felt its liquid warmth. He was diving into the feeling, as Malfoy’s cane hit him, and hit him, and hit him again, marking his arse in long red lashes.
‘No,’ Harry scrambled for purchase on the sheets, his fingers tightening hard. His eyes were on Draco’s. ‘I… I want.’
‘Color?’ Malfoy breathed on his ear. His hands came up to Harry’s hips, probably to reassure him, but for Harry that touch meant that he belonged to Malfoy. That was how Malfoy had touched him all night: like Harry was his.
‘I don’t believe you.’ Harry’s eyes were wide on his face and so green. Draco never knew he loved green so much. ‘Look at you. You’re…’ he struggled to find the words and lifted himself up, sat on the bed. His fingers twisted the sheets for a while. He looked rumpled and young and unsure.
I feel it again. This feeling I’ve been fighting all through the last week. My heart clenches. Tonight is our last night together. The last night I get to sleep with him. We both made a point of not talking about what happens after tonight. But now it’s here, open trunks, scattered belongings, and my boyfriend has dyed his hair blue. Or turquoise, whatever that is.
He practically sighs my name. I practically drink it down.
There’s the kiss.
‘It’s like riding a broom,’ he whispered, a faint smile tugging on his lips.
‘I’m not going to. Not
Harry sucked at the head, refusing to go down more. Draco let him, in fact he wanted Harry to take him like this, to take control of his cock, to drive him to madness. He felt indeed crazy when Harry pulled back again, and his cock bobbed in the air, red and covered in Harry’s saliva.
He kisses you.
He turns away from you, then turns back again.
‘Can I kiss you?’
He notices me staring, puts his arms around himself and stands there, seemingly unsure. I quickly look away. My eyes burn.
My face feels wet, my throat sore.
‘You never do this with the others,’ I say, my voice cracking weirdly.
And it’s not like you can keep your hands off me, Malfoy.
It sounded like a confession. Harry shivered and for once it had nothing to do with Malfoy’s hands, or his excruciating proximity.
But there’s soft amusement under his words and it warms you all up, until you’re heady with it.
‘What do you want, Harry?’
Hufflepuff hot dad... :) Fuck I'm so lucky
My hand slides into his hair. He immediately stops speaking. His lips part slightly. His hair is bright, soft, silk between my fingers. His breath catches.
. Harry gave a muffled cry. He bucked back against Malfoy’s hands. He wanted Malfoy to feel him up, to know that he could - he could do anything with it. Anything at all.
‘Are you tired?’ he asks
Loved it? Hated it? Expected more? Tell me all about it.
He finally looks at you, but there’s no judgement in his eyes, in fact, you don’t quite know what you’re finding there. He looks infinitely tired, fragile.
‘He’s the only one I had for years.’ There’s some kind of emotion in the way she says it. It’s fleeting, but there. I realise I’m probably taking a peak at the person Hermione fell for. The illusion takes no time fading away. Parkinson presses her lips together.
‘Draco… I want…’ he was babbling. What if this never happened again? What if he never got Draco again? He couldn’t bear the thought. His heart was hammering inside him.
Somehow I manage to make him lose his footing. He sways on the spot, takes a step back and it’s enough for me to run blindly for the desk. My wand is there. He grabs my robes. I hear the fabric tearing, a horrible tug. I stumble forward. He yanks the wand away from me and it clatters loudly to the floor.
‘Kiss me, you bastard,’ I say.
‘Yeah.’
‘Do you want to be kissed, Harry?’
‘I’m going to fuck you now,’ Draco said. And then he moved.
The fingers stilled over the head of his cock, soft. Harry wanted to snap his hips forward, to have his cock fuck Malfoy’s tight grip.
He comes to the top of the tower every night. Sometimes he smokes.
I spot him sitting on the sidewalk. Lonely. He lifts a cigarette to his lips, his hand unsure. He lights the tip silently. I heard those Muggle things kill people. And here I thought he was tired of dying.
You just nod, feeling at a loss.
His smile stays in place. It sends a red-hot jolt down my body, burning through everything. He gets up, arms open, hands empty, palms turned upwards. I’ve seen him go for wandless and non-verbal magic like it’s nothing at all. I’m ready for it. Whatever he throws at me. But wandless is much harder to predict. I lift my wand.
was in charge of his orgasm. Malfoy would have the final word. He was completely under Malfoy’s will and command. And that idea was enough to drive him further down the spiral. The following hours of his life would be as Draco Malfoy would see fit. He felt on fire, as if he’d been already spanked raw. But Malfoy had barely even touched him.
‘Fuck my mouth, please. I wa-’ sweat broke on his temple, as Josh kept sinking into him. Draco watched the tension on Harry’s throat, under the collar. His hand was moving over his cock and ghosting over Harry’s with slow purpose, making Harry whimper and beg.
Lightning strikes, cuts the sky in half. For a second, I’m blissfully blind. I imagine what it would be like. To be hit by thunder. Struck by lightning. Some would think it symbolic. I, for one, would call it poetic justice.
‘Funny thing, really,’ I set my now empty glass on the counter. ‘I give the press what they want, they take the picture, I dump the bloke- everyone gets off my back. You do the math. Or the arithmancy, whatever does it for you.’
Harry sucked in a breath, his body swaying forward.
‘You’re right, Malfoy.’ I say, catching my breath. ‘I don’t fucking care.’
‘Yes, you can, Harry,’ Draco said.
‘Don’t worry, sweetie. I’m saving all my judgement for your Potter addiction. Or should I say favourite brand of poison? Atrocious hair, body like sin, fucks every pretty boy that looks like you?’
I watch in resigned silence as she signals the bartender and asks for a dry Martini. The drink is set between us and she turns her steely dark eyes onto me. I feel exactly like the single olive in her drink. Pierced through and through.
I thought he wouldn’t want anyone to know we’re sleeping together, that he wouldn’t want people talking about it, thinking it was something other than it is. Because we’re just
To me, I mean.
‘Great powers of observation, Potter.’ He tries to go for his usual irony, but it comes out empty.
‘You’re not a coward, Draco.’ He whispers. ‘He’s the fucking coward. Only a coward would do what he did to you. You did what you had to do to survive.’
As if on cue, Harry’s cock leaked a thin flow of pre-come onto the sheets, still trapped by the spell. Draco felt an insane urge to laugh at the fact that they both got off on their shared fucked-up history. All that pent up tension could be used to make Harry Potter look exactly how he looked now, so far gone and aroused Draco was sure he’d come the second Draco’s hands went anywhere near him.
Josh leaned forward and gripped Harry’s cock matter-of-factly, pumped it once, then left it. Harry shuddered, managing somehow to keep his balance and his eyes on Draco. Only his lips parted, a gasp escaping them, too close to the bulge on Draco’s trousers. What he wanted was so clear. Oh, but he was going to have to scream for it.
‘Did he cry?’ I ask, as I take a slow drag of my cigarette.
The why and how and what the hells all evaporated at once. The world was reduced to Harry Potter’s wrecked face in the semi-darkness of the room, his eyes alight.
‘I thought… either you’re here to get drunk alone, or you’re waiting for something,’ he says.
‘I have a reservation. At your favourite restaurant.’
Turns out, it’s sooner than you expect.
‘God.’
When he finally leans back, I feel faint, black spots in my vision. He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Bites his lip. My hands are shaking, the dirty grey tiles of the bathroom floor filling up my vision, as my gaze slides over to his. He’s still kneeling at my feet, breathing hard & I cannot, for the life of me, move. He lifts a hand, his magic washes over me, cleaning me wandlessly & nearly setting my nerves on fire again. He tucks me back in & he looks up, assessing me. One of his fingers softly eases a crease in my trousers. It is not a sexual touch, but it is still a fully blown shock to my body. I grapple at the wall behind me. I’m no longer drunk, I think, but I don’t know what is going on. This is far from my first blow job in a dingy bathroom, nor do I intend it to be the last, but it’s like the script got all scrambled up.
Words dissolve in his mouth. He tastes of need.
The lights from the club flashed over Josh’s piercing blue eyes. He had a curious smile on his face, his posture completely at ease. It made Draco all the more aware of the tension building in his shoulders. Draco actually liked Josh. He was the type of man who was completely straightforward in all his interactions. You knew from the uptake where you stood with him, which lines you could cross, which were out of bounds, which were up for debate. A part of Draco wished he could always be like that, totally transparent about his own desires. But this whole business included Harry Potter and that complicated things.
My whole body is burning, my face all wet. I can hear my own heartbeat, a loud frantic beating against my ribs, like something about to burst out of control. And he hasn’t fucked me yet. This is what he does to me.
to do so. He could spank Potter raw, then have his arse, make him come under his mouth or empty himself pounding him, then leave. Aftercare wasn’t even his job - Josh was in charge of that. It would be so easy… And still he couldn’t do it. Informed consent was everything in a play. If he lost that, he would lose all his hard earned self-respect. The only damned thing he had left.
‘I… fuck, don’t stop now,’ Draco said, his head dropping back against the couch.
You’ve been staring at it for a year and one night.
But I will tell him soon. He’ll know. He’ll know exactly how I feel around him, with him, about him. I will tell him about trust, about hope. I will tell him with every word that I can muster, because he deserves it.
‘Someone’s been paying attention.’
‘Leave them,’ he says, eyes fixed on your bulge, and fuck, he licks his lips.
‘What happened to Malfoy?’ he teased.
‘Harry.’
He came to after a while. For a violent  second, his eyes were scared and wide. Then he seemed to recognise me. He rose up and stepped away from me, his face closed off to any sign of emotion. He asked for a change of clothes. I gave him a sweater and pyjama pants. I was careful not to pick something too Gryffindor, they’re grey and pretty nondescript.
I take my hand away. He lets it go this time. I make myself look right into his eyes.
Potter laughs.
The way he says it — equal parts gentle and angry. It’s all
‘Fuck. Okay, Draco.’
I’m sure he’s the only reason they let me get back to Hogwarts. This is all I have now. Finish school. Get a proper job. Marry whomever mother says. Produce an heir for what’s left of the Malfoy’s fortune. It’s nothing but a task list. All I have to do is check the boxes. Unless something happens.
We’ve only shared a few handjobs up until now, but he’s made it pretty clear he wants more. He’s been trying to fuck me for weeks. I always end up distracting him with my hands, postponing it to never ever. I can tell he’s getting impatient. Yesterday, I let him come on my naked back. I felt so disgusted afterwards, it took me several cleaning spells and almost one hour in the showers to be rid of the feeling of his come on me.
You pull back, your cock aching inside your pants. You’re not expecting anything else, but his thumb drags across your cheek and collects a drop of his come from the corner of your mouth. He slicks your lips with it and then pulls you up and kisses you hard, his hands on the collar of your jacket. It’s so unexpected, you make a surprised noise. He tastes of Firewhisky and now of his come, too. It’s too much, not enough. Your head spins. The words are out before you think them.
She’s already opening up her purse to pay and leave when I manage to speak.
‘I want…’
But Josh had followed him, stopped him in his tracks. And was looking at him now, a defying smile on his lips. It would be infuriating if Draco didn’t feel the pressing need to listen to whatever he was going to say.
It complicated them much more than he wanted to admit.
‘I keep thinking… you need a place to relax,’ Harry whispered. His hands cupped Draco’s bollocks, his tongue darting out to lick at them, slow. He took his time to make Draco wet all over before he even turned to his cock. Draco groaned in frustration, his hand shooting to Harry’s hair. His cock rubbed against Harry’s cheek.
This time, when you close the doors behind you, he turns to look back. He does a quick swipe of you, his face saying nothing. You have the distinct feeling he was waiting for exactly this.
I feel his fingers slipping into mine. He pulls me close again. I’m afraid to look in his eyes, to let him see.
My mind draws a complete blank. We stare at each other in silence.
Sounding bored is a skill I’ve honed my entire life. Too bad Harry Potter seems to have developed full immunity to it. Even worse, he seems to get off on it.
‘Harry.’
He sounds exactly how you imagined it. Breathless, insistent, aroused. You can feel his cock achingly hard, trapped between you two. You pay no mind to it and you open him up like you never did anyone, taking your time, using your fingers until he’s unable to order you around.
Harry fixed Draco with those defiant eyes, a low moan barely suppressed. There was a groan from Josh, a gentle slide, his hands smoothing over Harry’s arching back, the whole of Harry’s body allowing the invasion, submitting for Draco.
‘I want to be yours. Collar me. Put me on a leash.’
‘Yeah,’ his voice catches for the first time. We both stop the slow dance.
‘I’m always afraid,’ he says quietly. He’s right next to me, so much so that I feel his warmth reaching the tips of my fingers still tight around the bowl.
‘Yes. You’re hard,’ he said, his voice shaking. ‘Oh god… please.’
But really, he doesn’t.
So when he moves again, there’s no hesitation, no doubt. He grabs me like I’m there for the taking. That’s when it hits me. The heartbreaking bit. I know he’s going to break my heart when this — whatever this is — ends. Because it will.
Harry let out a pained whine, but whispered yes.
It was Blaise who caught sight of him first and the teen’s eyes widened which was all it took for Draco to jump up from the couch he was on and rush towards him. Harry all but fell into the blonde’s arms as he listened to the soothing words coming from his mate.
“We can find a nice classroom to work on it,” her curly blonde hair was in his face and he controlled a gag as her perfume wafted around him, it was sickly sweet and made his stomach curdle.
Draco shrugged, “More or less, yes. I had hoped he wouldn’t have pulled his wand on you immediately after seeing you, but I had expected the anger,” nothing more was said as they pushed aside their plates and Draco tugged at his hand.
“Ronald Weasley! You’ve been friends since first year, I’d hope that you’d be adult enough to not let a resorting come between that,” Hermione pinned the other boy with a glare and Ron glared right back.
He made it back to the common room entrance faster than he had anticipated and walked into students chatting excitedly with one another. Harry was quick to clock Draco as his mate, with his blonde hair, stood out among everyone else.
“What is this magic,” the man roared, and Harry pushed back his shoulder’s.
“Your wandless magic is improving?” Harry grinned.
Shoving the key back into his pocket he gave Hermione and Luna a hug goodbye seeing as the girls were staying at the castle for the break.
Snape was sitting behind his desk with a stack of papers and his quill poised for grading. His black eyes briefly flickered up as they entered before returning to the assignment he was marking.
“Her last letter said that Dumbledore had sought her and Hermione out to see if either had heard from you,” Harry leaned forward with concern.
“Does that mean you’ve accepted that you’re a Riddle?” Blaise’s question pulled Harry from the depths of Draco’s eyes, he grimaced.
Harry felt embarrassed as students began to snicker. Normally, he would laugh about it with Ron but by the looks of it, Ron was just laughing at him.
In darkest times of thee
“My mother signed me up for a summer course covering artwork,” the group snickered, and he glowered at them, saying nothing more.
“Why are there so many rooms?” Harry asked as Draco turned around another corner, the blonde tilted his head to the side.
Their Potions Professor sighed once more and motioned for the two to sit down.
“I’m to take you to a different room,” it said, and Harry wavered.
“It was all I could think of at the moment,” he whined as Draco rolled his eyes and went to reach out and wrap an arm around the smaller boys shoulder.
“Wait, does she-” Draco rushed to interrupt him.
Harry had managed to read half of Salazar’s book and while he still hadn’t found anything about the Horcruxes he had learned a lot about the man himself. Salazar was present each night, reminding him to concentrate when his mind would wander, and to clarify something when his magic mixed up words or phrases.
“I know that you boys have spent the day on a train and wish to retire for the evening, but I did have the house elves prepare a light meal we can take in the adjoining room,” pulled out of his trance Harry followed Blaise’s example and set his trunk down and followed the Lady of the manor as she turned and walked down the side hallway, her heels clicking with each step she took.
The first years mingled with one another as they each scribbled out an outline of what they wanted to do while Hermione watched over them with an excited look on her face, she told Harry and Luna earlier that she had adjusted her own schedule to help out.
Zabini shrugged.
“So, if I choose not to accept the bond, it’ll just go away with time?”
After a few moments of eye contact Harry broke away, he felt himself flush. Toying with the idea that it could have been Malfoy that trashed his room he disregarded it; the blond had done nothing to warrant suspicion, if anything Malfoy was the least likely suspect, something he couldn’t have imagined thinking a year ago.
Harry didn’t take too much time to process the apprehension his Professor had shown though he did wonder if it was because he was Draco’s mate and he was the Veela’s godfather.
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected walking into his room, but it didn’t disappoint. There was a four-poster bed, decked with the Slytherin emblem and green sheets, it was very much like the bed he had in Gryffindor tower. There was a desk on the other side of the room with a wardrobe next to it. There was a small window looking at the lake and Harry mourned for the light he had in the tower.
“I couldn’t let you shower alone,” licking his lips Harry wondered how late they would be to breakfast.
“I had never considered giving up my baby, but I didn’t know what I was supposed to do after the birth. I found myself befriending a kind woman that welcomed me into her facility a few weeks until my due date. She worked with children and loved each of them as her own; she promised me that my baby and I would have a place to stay and a job after the birth and for a moment I felt like everything was going to be okay.”
memories of second year flashed in his mind and Harry watched as Draco dodged the spell with ease.
Making his way down towards the end of the Slytherin table Harry sat himself as far away as he possibly could from the other students. He didn’t dare look up. He could feel every eye on him in the Great Hall and he barely registered that Dumbledore had stood up, encouraged the students to enjoy their meals, and retire for the evening.
He saw the younger version of that man in the Chamber of Secrets his second year.
It was another minute before more words began to appear.
“I’ll be here as long as I’m needed,” she said, and with that the garden, the manor, and Merope, vanished.
Fennekitten

Till we read again,
“Anderson!” he cried, trying to move he felt Draco’s arms tighten around him.
So, as he made his way up to the Headmaster’s door, he mentally reminded himself that Draco and Blaise were down the next hallway waiting for him. Both had insisted that they would be there for him and with a worried glance from Draco, Harry ventured to find out what the older man wanted.
“My gran explained to me that I have control of the Longbottom finances since my parents passed away, you’re not a legal adult in the wizarding world until you’re eighteen but it’s been found that between sixteen and eighteen witches and wizards can adjust into their responsibilities rather than be forced to understand right at eighteen,” Neville interjected, face pinching as he mentioned his parents.
It was mid-afternoon before Harry had the house to be cleaned to his Uncle’s standard. He was out of breath, vision swimming, and his body ached, but he wagered that he would have enough time to clean up. He had a few glasses of water and a slice of bread, having ate around the blueish tint on the corner.
During his dreams Salazar was no help either, the man was more infuriating then Snape on a good day and belittled him any chance that he got. In a fit of rage Harry had destroyed one of the rooms to Salazar’s amusement and Harry had ignored him the following few nights.
There was movement above him, slow steps down the stairs followed by a bang against the wall, then silence, Harry couldn’t breathe. It was too late for his Uncle to be up, he usually would have passed out by now, but Harry could hear grumbling on the other side of cupboard door and knew his night would only be getting worse.
“You did what!” the Veela’s voice had dropped yet Ginny’s eyes had turned towards him with as equal fury as he had received.
Waving his wand and a
“I can heal that for you, if you’d like,” Malfoy muttered.
“Yes, there is at least one portrait of each, as to where they aren’t, I wouldn’t know,” silence fell over the group but broke as Draco shot his best friend a suspicious look.
“Harry,” and in that moment, Harry’s heart began to beat rapidly, glancing towards Draco, Harry looked back at the parchment at the blonde’s surprised look.
“Will you be able to get me to see him?” Mister Malfoy nodded.
Harry caught Draco’s impressed look.
“What happened?!” Harry could see Blaise and a few other students standing outside the hole in the wall, each had their wands raised.
“Potter,” glancing up he accepted the piece of parchment from Snape, skimming over his schedule Harry hadn’t realized how little Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s saw one another.
As they finally made it to the dining area Harry tensed as he caught sight of another individual sitting next to Lady Zabini.

“Tonight, he called me to his office, he had found one of the Horcruxes and he told me I needed to find a way to destroy it, that he couldn’t,” there was something about that piece of information that triggered something in his mind but he pushed it aside, “He had found a ring, and when he put it on the desk it felt so familiar, I reached out to it,” Draco hissed and even Blaise shot him an unimpressed look.
February came with more snow and an overwhelming pile of homework from all his classes and Harry fell into a routine to balance it all. Between his wandless tutoring, Occlumency lessons, dueling practice, assignments, spending time with Draco and hanging out with his friends the days had begun to fly by.
“I don’t accept this Draco, your mate has put you in danger,” he held up a hand as Draco started to protest, “regardless if she was aware of it or not. She will never be accepted into the Malfoy name,” a flood of emotions washed over Harry as he clenched the hem of his shirt, he barely noticed that Draco’s head had glanced towards the door with confusion etched over his face.
Harry had felt a swell of emotion as his friends reminded him that they would do anything to help him, Draco and Blaise had been silent and Harry had mused whether they realized despite the change of house his friends had the hearts of a Gryffindor.
Neville had excused himself and went back to the Great Hall to grab something to eat for the group. As Harry stretched his legs, he felt the familiar presence next to him, smiling up at the Veela Draco returned the smile.
“In Renee’s most recent adventure she’ll seek out her heart’s desire, but what if her heart’s desire happens to be someone close to her and in love with someone else,” he repeated and with an eyebrow raised he handed the book back.
Waving his wand over the random selection of books Harry muttered the spell as he kept an ear out for anyone walking his way.
“My Uncle has been the only one to craft these stones and when he died, he didn’t pass the trait on, so I’m very particular about who I show these too,” feeling his heart swell he felt extremely grateful.
It was the moment after the hat had stopped singing that the hall was silent. Scanning the Professor table Harry could see that everyone was stunned, even Dumbledore who had tried to mask his shock, was looking at the Sorting Hat closely.
Draco coaxed him on to the bed, he didn’t wrap his arms around him, but their legs and shoulders were touching, and Draco laced their fingers together.
Harry had finally taken his potion and was dozing on the couch listening to Blaise and Draco debate over Potions homework; both boys had lowered their voice and Harry relaxed to the soothing sounds of the fireplace. The last two days had been more than stressful, and he could only hope that things would go smoother leading into the New Year.
Pulling out his own parchment and quill Harry watched as Ron scribbled down the means of an essay and no matter how much he whined and pouted none of the group was willing to give him the answers.
“Is this family some how related to the Snape’s?” Salazar gave him an annoyed look.
, wishing he knew it as well as Hermione did his eyes traced the passage.
Slowly making his way down one of the larger hallways he approached a door that he hadn’t explored before but the sound he was hearing was coming from the other side. Pushing the door open slowly he peered inside and gaped at what he saw.
Taking a deep breath Harry found himself picking out a few books from every other isle, some were on the top shelf others were closer to the bottom. It really didn’t matter because after the spell was finished the books would return to their place on the shelf, completely undamaged.
It was rare that there was weather in his dream. Nights were usually filled with silence and Merope had joked with him that while crickets were a nuisance, she longed for them.
“That was my late husband’s, Blaise’s father’s, Animagus form when he was alive. Having it hear has always made me feel like he was protecting us,” she said with a wistful look and Harry’s face dropped, he hadn’t meant to make the Zabini’s feel upset.
His uplifted mood was soured when Hermione had brought up the Halloween feast.
“I understand what’s expected out of me, Professor,” he replied stonily and reigned in his emotions so that his mental barrier didn’t waiver.
Arriving back in the common room Harry was surprised that it was welcoming glances that were shot his way.
“It confirmed that I’m his heir, but it doesn’t make sense, how or why, I am,” he finished with a sour tone.
It was quite dreary, cement walls surrounded him, and it was quick work that he found himself at the top of a set of stairs heading down. Rolling his eyes at the founder’s appreciation for dungeon-like areas, he treaded onward.
“Well good riddance mate, you look like you enjoyed the time away from them,” Hermione shot the boy a glare and Ron held up his hands in a surrender fashion.
As Harry walked into the different room, he was momentarily surprised to see Tom standing next to the fireplace. Looking lost in thought the man turned towards him as the door clicked, he seemed as out of character as he had hours before.
His shoulders shook as he sobbed into his fingers uncaring that Blaise was watching him. He felt the firm grasp of the teens hands on his shoulders and he looked up amid tear-filled eyes to Blaise’s reassuring look.
Heart feeling light Harry concentrated on the bond between him and his mate and focused on the blonde. The bond still felt numb, but he could feel that Draco was there.
With the storm still raging outside Harry peaked into each one of the rooms as he walked by. Most of the rooms were bedrooms and Harry made a mental to ask her, or even Draco, why manors were filled with rooms that he assumed were never used.
“You’re my best friend Hermione, you always will be,” he finished softly, she gave him a smile as she pushed back her hair, but it wasn’t the normal Hermione smile he was accustomed too.
“Harry, it’s imperative that we have an idea of what Voldemort is planning in order to stay one step ahead,” Harry nodded, but felt unconvinced, something felt off.
“So, if we make the potion and use some of my blood then we can see if it’s true?” Draco nodded and Harry sagged in relief. While it wasn’t an immediate answer, they had a direction to go with.
It was very relaxing to be exchanging gifts with them both; Blaise was ecstatic about the chocolate and his eyes had lit up at the box of pranks, Draco had sent him an unimpressed look which Harry returned with an innocent smile.
Her eyes traced his face and she hummed, “I’ll do some research,” and she abruptly stood up and headed away from their secluded area of the library, Luna giggled as Neville eyed the blonde.
The following night Harry kept an eye on Draco and Blaise as they headed out of the common room prepared to make their rounds, he observed as Draco wore one of his nicer coats and stuffed an ingredient bag in his breast pocket. The boys said goodbye and Harry waited until the common room entrance closed before hurrying back into his own room.
Alright! Hopefully one more foundation chapter and then things will move along. Poor Harry, nothing ever is easy for him.
Harry snorted and chortled.
“I – I just can’t, there is no way, Draco – I, wha – what?” it was a garble mess of words as Draco tucked the smaller boy under his chin murmuring random nonsense to calm him down.
“Wonderful Mister Potter, full marks and ten points for Slytherin,” Harry walked back to his desk feeling proud, missing the upset looks from students from both houses and the smug look Malfoy was sending him.
It was Neville who brought up the mid-term exams and Hermione went straight into lecture mode, having even brought out her study table. Harry shot the boy a grateful look while Luna indulged the older girl with listening to another explanation of when the witch planned to study for certain classes. Later, she had told Harry and Neville that Hermione had told her the girl’s study schedule a dozen times, but she didn’t mind hearing it once more.
Saturday morning came with a flurry of green and silver as the Slytherin house rallied together for the game against Hufflepuff. When Draco had talked to him about a new plan for the match Harry had internally winced, he’d have to miss the game, yet as he watched the captain of the team bring together the players in the common room Friday night with words of encouragement he couldn’t tell the blonde that he’d be absent from the game, Draco would be too distracted.
watching as a cloud of smoke surrounded his half of the arena Harry clocked the shadow of Murphy as he knew that the other boy couldn’t see him.
“I hope we have an uneventful end of term,” came the offhand remark and Harry gave him a weak smile, the previous year’s flashing in his mind.
“Overly confident are you Potter, you stroll in here and didn’t expect that I would kill you?” he let out a dark chuckle and Harry shrugged.
have known.
“A Horcrux is the result of a witch or wizard cutting part of their soul and placing it into an object,” Harry’s stomach plummeted.
Luna pointed her wand to the shattered pieces and murmured a quiet Repark and the compartment lit up once more.
He wouldn’t lie, he missed some of the friendships that he had left behind when he had been resorted into Slytherin. While the deeper feelings he held for the youngest Weasley had faded away he had enjoyed her friendship.
“You should see the mark I left on you,” the blonde whispered as his lips came back to his and he captured the smaller boy into another searing kiss.
It is for the best Mister Potter. With one last breath Harry opened his eyes.
“Oh, hi Mister Evans!” she seemed flustered as she rushed to collect the papers on the floor, Harry noted that she had three pens sticking out from her bun on top her head. Reaching down he collected the few pages that had went his way.
he paused,
“Not a fan?” Harry shrugged.
“What did you see, my boy?” Harry was confused, he wasn’t quite sure what Dumbledore wanted him to get out of that memory.
Running down the hallway he could vaguely hear the man calling after him, but Harry was scared. It was the first time someone else had been in his dream, and Harry just knew that the man was real.
Whether or not Blaise realized it Harry appreciated that he could give Draco his gift without an audience, thrusting the box onto Draco’s lap he watched as the blonde unwrapped it and lift the top of the case.
“I told the Headmaster that you’d be safe at the Zabini manor, that as your Head of House I have no issue with you leaving for the holidays, but,” irritation surged across the man’s face, “he asked that I check in with you daily for the duration of your stay. Seeing as it would be less suspicious if I go rather than someone else,” he said giving Harry a look.
“I appreciate it Luna, he says he feels better,” her eyes lit up as she turned back towards Neville with a spring in her step, said teen gave him an amused look and indulged the girl with an arm around her shoulder.
“How do you feel,” Draco asked immediately, as it seemed to the blonde that his smaller mate was feeling more coherent than previously, his nimble fingers traced Harry’s face, through his hair, and gently tugged the green-eye teen towards him.
tears welled in his eyes once more and he tossed his glasses to his end table.
Their day had been spent drinking Butterbeer, picking up a few items from Honeydukes, and Hermione had even managed to convince the group to stop a small bookstore that she had found their third year.
‘Yeah.’ He sighs. ‘But other things hurt more. You have to know, Draco. Surely you know.’
He steps out of the bathroom wearing my clothes. The sweater hangs loose around his narrow shoulders, but the pants seem to fit. He seems weary, exhausted, like he’s lived years in just a couple of hours. His hair is still wet from the bath. There are dark circles under his eyes. But what gets me are the bruises. He has a cut on his nose and on his upper lip. It will probably be swollen tomorrow. There’s a dark-purple bruise on his jaw. And more on his neck, finger-shaped, like someone held him down, suffocating him.
‘Get on the bed,’ he said. ‘Josh is going to fuck you for me.’
‘I knew I would love it... I can’t believe you’re letting me have it.’
I keep waiting for him to get up, to stand back against the opposite wall & wait for me to return the favour. I would too. I more than want to. But he does nothing of the sort. This would be the perfect time for me to sneer & say something caustic, but he’s still kneeling at my feet, looking up & I can’t think of a single thing to say, sarcastic or otherwise. His eyes avidly rake my body, starting at the tips of my shoes, climbing up my legs, sliding over my crotch, along my belly & chest & up my neck, only stopping when he finds me looking at him. So much for the pretence of anonymity. It’s like he’s binding us both to this memory. His mouth curves into a sweet smile. I realise that he is probably playing me, like he does with all of the others. The ones he drags home every night, making increasingly shrewd headlines in the next morning papers. The Golden Boy’s love life has proven to be an endless source of income for wizarding media all over Britain. Or rather, sex life — I don’t think love has much to do with it. I’ve just become another one of his conquests. I know this, but can’t make myself look away.
Malfoy’s lips brushed his cheek, curling into a smile.
no longer feel familiar. Rain batters at the windows, thunder strikes. I used to feel safe here. Safer, anyway.
‘Not this time.’ His tone is unflinching. His thumb brushes over my lip. It is so hard to breathe. ‘I want you on a bed. I want to take my time.’

Harry kissed him harder, his hands coming up between them. He opened Draco’s shirt’s buttons, hands venturing beneath Draco’s clothes, untucking his shirt, searching. Somehow they managed to stand up and kissed, bodies crashing and trembling.
‘What exactly did

‘No, that’s his job,’ Draco said.

‘The War changed everything,’ he says.
He looks quickly away, like I knew he would.
You take another step and drop to your knees. It’s cold and wet and you couldn’t care less. You palm him through his pants. He’s not fully hard yet, but he’s getting there. Your mouth waters.
I know this is fucked-up. There’s a part of me that craves being needed by him when he’s weak. And another part that wants to get lost in him when the alcohol can take the blame for my actions. At least when I’m fucking him I feel like someone wants me with everything that I am, all my fuck-ups, the damned mark in my arm, the tainted family name. He wants me like that, and for some unhealthy reason I need that to come from a place of pain and not love.
‘‘Cause you have bad taste in hair?’
I run after him, heart banging on my wrist, chest, neck. It beats under my feet, on the trees, off the castle walls behind me and the whole world is a throbbing gigantic heart beating inside the cage of my teeth.
I reach the landing, then the front door.
the letter just like I did with all of the others, but the sight of his terrible writing, spelling my name just
Merlin.
‘Harry.’
‘You’ll have to break him some,’ Draco said. He remembered how tight Harry was. Even after being rimmed for so long that night, he’d been like a tight vice when Draco finally entered him. God, he missed that. ‘I want your fingers up his arse. Stretch him.’
Josh always took that moment to check their surroundings, noticing which men were enjoying their show the most and which he thought he and Harry would like. Harry had been feeling the men’s eyes on him, even with the blindfold on, buzzing on the skin of his exposed arse. Josh kept spanking him, just the exact amount of pain Harry craved for the beginning of the night, his body starting to warm up. Someone was watching him so intensely he felt himself harden from it. Josh noticed it too. He gave an appreciative hum and moved Harry, placing him on all fours on the floor. The air felt electrified. The man was really enjoying the display. Harry raised his arse in the air, wanting to give him the better angle. He felt magic prickling around him. So… this man was a wizard, and fuck fuck fuck, he loved it, that brand of magic on him, on his exposed, burning skin. It turned him fucking on.
Harry obeyed, lowering his head. This was their signal. Josh was handing him to this stranger. Except…
Pansy’s eyes acess me.
He drops the cigarette down to the floor.
‘Please, Draco.’
‘You’re also waiting for something,’ I say, unbelieving.
And this time it was everything and nothing like the first one. Their lips brushed slowly, then Draco coaxed his mouth open. Harry’s lips parted, a sob, a moan, a pitiful little sound escaping his throat and Draco plunged inside his mouth, carefully, deeply, his tongue running over Harry’s lips, his teeth nipping, his fingers tangling in Harry’s hair.

He was also a well-cast
After almost three months of staring at him, it’s like I’m seeing him for the first time. Maybe because now I can’t ignore that he’s seeing me too.
‘I thought you hated rules. Suddenly you’re all well-behaved and proper,’ I say, and even I hear the feeble complaint in my voice.
‘Harry,’ he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
I can’t breathe. My hand finds his. He holds it. I let myself collapse, my face on his chest. My eyes fill with sudden tears and I remember that this is not the first time he’s seen me cry. But that moment in the bathroom is light years away. We were different people then. This time, I don’t hold back. I let myself feel the terror and helplessness. I should be embarrassed, ashamed, but I’m not. He holds me through it. He doesn’t say anything, he doesn’t try to fix me. He just holds me.
Something nagged at the back of his mind about what Ginny had said, yet he couldn’t place it.
“What happened here!?” she exclaimed, already casting spells and running diagnostics over the new patients.
“Well after the ritual was completed there was a mark on the person, a mark that wouldn’t go away with spells or potions or even over the course of time,” her eyes flickered back to his scar and he stared at the wall unmoving.
“Harry my boy, I feel we’re one step closer to finding and destroying Voldemort for good,” Harry nodded slowly as he watched the older wizard’s fingers reach out and open the envelope.
“I had asked him to take me to see you, I needed to know you were okay. Once we got back here your father had horded you in your room, not wanting anyone to get close to you, your mother said that he had completely let his Veela side take over,” Draco let out a visible wince and Harry nodded.
Rubbing the back of his neck he tried giving Blaise an innocent look, the older teen rolled his eyes and pushed him gently.
“I still can’t believe the Professors are scheduling a mandatory Prefect meeting on the last Hogsmeade weekend,” Blaise whined as Draco rolled his silver eyes, Harry sent him a knowing look.
Yet, the man didn’t explain anything that was written, even when Harry pressed him with questions.
Harry had become mildly obsessed with Riddle’s locket as the magic surrounding it seemed to become restless; Harry had only assumed that the Horcrux that was embedded inside of it was desperately trying to find Tom.
“Well, at least you thought enough to go to Severus and get help, I’ll be sure to thank him,” he said and picked up his robe tossing Harry’s Christmas gift towards him.
It was the third of June and just two days from Draco’s seventeenth birthday and Harry had finally managed to find time to put memories into the stone and wrap the gift. They’d have exams on his birthday and the day after, but he knew he could coax his mate into an hour or so of time to themselves seeing as they only had a few moments in between exams to spend with one another.

It was then that Harry felt Draco relax in his hold and strong arms wrapped around his shoulders as his chin settled atop his messy hair. Pressing his ear above the Veela’s heart he could hear it beating erratically.
“I know that this is a lot for you to handle my boy,” Harry flinched as Tom’s screams resonated in his mind as Dumbledore had called him the same thing, “but I truly believe that you have the capacity to destroy Voldemort for good,” Harry nodded.
Ron had been oddly silent, but Harry had pushed his ex-best friend to the back of his mind as the first Hogsmeade weekend was approaching. It was mid-October and the weather was getting colder by the day.
Approaching the library Harry walked to where the dot indicated he could find the other boy. Rounding the corner, he faltered as he saw that Malfoy wasn’t alone, he hadn’t paid any attention to anyone else on the map.
“So, talking with Salazar’s portrait might provide us with a direction to go in but not exactly the final destination?” Blaise smiled, “Exactly,” he responded.
“What took you so long, I thought you were leaving as we were,” she said worriedly as Luna walked to Neville and handed him a small bag, the boy flushed and Harry averted his eyes from what seemed a private moment.
It was moments later that Harry found himself in a restless sleep back in the manor, wandering aimlessly through the halls.
“Care to join me somewhere different tonight?” tilting his head to the side he nodded and trailed after Draco as the group parted ways.
Harry gaped and he could hear Blaise sucking in a breath next to him.
“So, if the ritual was successful, that would make me what to Tom?” her brown eyes adverted from his and he felt sweat trickle down the back of his neck.
“Before break, Draco found a potion that has been used to confirm heir status, it was mainly used centuries ago when wizards and witches said they were an heir to claim the benefits of it. We brewed it over the winter holiday,” Harry rummaged around his pocket for the crumpled up piece of paper and smoothed it out before pushing it towards the three sitting across from him, as they peered at it Blaise and Draco placed their own pieces of paper on the table.
It wasn’t until Madam Pince shooed the boys out that the three made their way back to the common room. Lost in thought he felt a gentle bump on his shoulder and looked up to see that Draco had nudged him, giving him a smile. The butterflies returned. As the three said goodnight for the evening and went into their separate rooms it was the first time Harry felt a special sense of happiness wash over him.
and the faint snarl from his side indicated that Draco was less than impressed.
Closing his eyes he could hear Madam Pomfrey read off the list of injuries as Anderson and Esmelda explained what had happened, the group had gone relatively silent as Esmelda explained the fight in the abandoned classroom and both Draco and Blaise gave their perspective from when they had arrived.
“This is Upper Flagley, ‘arry. The main place ‘ye want ter stay will be Potts Inn a few doors down. Mainly the elderly resides here, ‘s a wizardin’ community,” Harry nodded and dumped the necessary Galleon’s in Stans outstretched hand, as he made his way down the steps, he turned back at Stan who was watching him carefully.
“I’m fine Draco, none of my injuries hurt and Madam Pomfrey cleared me for classes and extracurricular activities,” Draco looked like he wanted to argue more but they had reached the door leading to the dueling club, shutting him up effectively.
Luna chuckled and stepped over a rock in the path.
Harry peeked up through the fringe of his bang mildly wondering if he needed a haircut.
Dumbledore’s contemplative look deepened as he stared at a nonsequential item lost in thought, Harry could imagine that the man was weighing the risk of this idea.
“And where will I be?” side-eyeing Blaise as he inched away Harry glared at Draco.
He was moving on autopilot as the food appeared, having lost his appetite once the resorting had commenced. He nibbled on some chicken, choked down a roll and barely made it through some pumpkin juice, before his stomach churned in protest. Half an hour later students began to filter out of the Great Hall and Harry fumbled with what to do next.
“It’s not a trick father,” the silence that followed was thick with tension and Harry didn’t hesitate to hold on to Draco’s hand tightly as the blonde’s fingers sought out his own.
“Yes?” he said as he glanced over his shoulder and cocked his head to the side with an innocent look on his face.
Draco raised a blonde brow.
“It’ll be fine, my parents have been looking forward to when I found my mate,” Draco said softly and it was Harry’s turn to snort, “Until they find out it’s The-Boy-Who-Lived,” Harry said with annoyance.
She caught his line of sight and handed it to him.
Scarcely acknowledging the pulse of magic from the locket Harry cried out as a wave of heat pushed them forward; rocks were beginning to fall as the cave began to shake and with one last burst of adrenaline Harry tumbled into the rowboat.
“Oi, none of us need to see that,” came a call from Blaise and Harry stuck out his tongue.
“You’re what?” Harry scratched the back of his neck.
It wasn’t until the break was almost over that Harry began to get antsy. The necklace was becoming increasingly restless and Harry was running out of time to somehow manage to see Tom. When he had finally confided his worries with Draco the blonde told him they would corner his father in his office first thing the next morning.
“I think I need to lay down,” he said softly, and Blaise gripped his elbow tightly as Hermione looked towards him worriedly.
“What is it father?”
“I’m happy too,” she whispered, and for that moment, he let himself indulge in the feeling as well.
“There is nothing wrong with the Hufflepuff house! Without those who are caring,” an image of Hannah Abott flashed in his mind, he had watched as his fellow sixth year had taken to helping Madam Pomfrey in the Hospital Wing, “without those who are loyal, a true friend,” he pictured the third year Hufflepuff’s that had reached out to some of the Slytherin students to study with, he thought of Justin, of Susan, he couldn’t move the image in his mind of Cedric.
The next two days Harry had tried to distract himself from the thoughts of Malfoy; he had kept busy reading up on wandless magic and helping the two new Slytherin Beaters, but he still couldn’t get the feeling that something was going on with the Slytherin Prefect. Harry was feeling anxious about the boy and couldn’t understand why.
“He’s not your mate Draco, this is a trick,” Draco’s father hissed, wand still pointed at his son.
“Listen Pansy, I was told there were some Gryffindor’s sneaking around and I need to check it out, why don’t you,” and he eyed the other ogling girls to the side, “and everyone else, make your way back into the castle,” she shot him one more pout and walked off towards her friends whispering with them as the blonde walked away.
Mid-terms were in full swing and the sixth- and seventh-year students were feeling the weight of it. Even the normally composed Draco was looking more frazzled than normal. Hermione had taken to the library with the rest of the Ravenclaws and he hadn’t had a chance to continue the discussion with her about what was going on between him and Draco.
Grabbing a handful of floo powder Harry thanked Mister Spaulding once more before the green light surrounded him and he shouted, ‘Kings Cross Station.’
“You look lovely Luna, how were your holiday’s?” they made small chat for a few minutes with the two quiet Slytherin’s behind him acting as buffers for any student wanting to stare and gossip about them.
Students were angling their necks to get a better look at Harry, Esmelda, and Anderson, all whom were ushered to the couches. Harry groan as he sank into the cushion, he ached everywhere.
“Why was Tom there?” uneasily, Harry handed the picture back.
Brandishing his wand, he spent the entire lunch period repairing what he could, grateful that his more personal items, like his Firebolt that he had got from Sirius, was hidden beneath his Invisibility Cloak.
“This is amazing, how did you come by it?” he felt like he was taking something precious and rare, the shop keeper laughed.
After the Battle at the Department of Mysteries he had relived Sirius’ death night after night. Though after his sixteenth birthday at the end of July those nightmares faded, and his nights were filled with these new dreams. Now weeks until the new start of term all he was dreaming of was this manor. The detail in the dreams drastically increased, he suddenly was able to see the text of books, the patterns on the cloth, even the grain on the wood.
“I’d recommend sleeping with rosemary leaves and drinking a cup with breakfast daily, it should help cleanse your aura,” Harry nodded awkwardly but was lucky that the Professor had been distracted by the pile of twigs that Padma was passing around.
Harry felt his face heat up at the attention that he was receiving but he smiled slightly as the stag gave an excited prance as it trotted around Draco, the blonde that was giving him an amused look.
“I know Hermione, I didn’t think any of this could be real, I wanted to be sure that it was before I told you, any of you,” Neville gave him a weak smile as Luna’s lip trembled, Hermione tugged at the strands of her hair.
“It’s probably Esmelda and Anderson, girl had black hair?” at Neville’s hesitant nod, he still looked uncomfortable at the Slytherin’s outburst, Draco shoulders dropped.
Madam Pomfrey’s lip turned into a half smile, all too aware of the dungeon’s dangers.
“I’m not your mate, Malfoy, you’ve got that wrong,” though as Malfoy responded with silence, a blank look on his face, Harry felt his stomach churn.
“Yeah, their captain has something to prove this year and while his tactics are,” Draco bobbed his head from side to side, “less than impressive, his drive could lead to a win,” Harry made a small noise of acknowledgement, they had this conversation multiple times already.
“I’m sorry you were moved, I know the students would have loved to talk with each of you,” her face lit up once more.
brief mention of loss of a child during pregnancy, seriously it is just a mention it does not go into detail about what had happened just that it had happened.
“Theo, you know it’s against house rules to attack a fellow housemate,” said Rupert who looked down at Nott disapprovingly, Nott glared.
The room was larger than what he had at the Dursleys, there was a queen-sized bed in the middle flanked by end tables; a desk was pushed up under the window overlooking the street he had arrived on, there was a closet, a bathroom, and dresser that Harry made good use of and unpacked what little clothes he had. The room was shades of blue and gave Harry a calm feeling.
“Correct, Missus Love, five points to Hufflepuff. For today I would like you to work through this list of spells from previous years and mark down how much the spell has changed; take note if you have to put more or less force into the spell or if there are any changes once you’ve cast the spell. Once we have a better idea of how your magic may have changed, we will practice spells traditionally used in dueling next week,” students began to chatter as the class worked through the multi-page list.
The dungeon space wasn’t large, only a handful of rooms; some were locked while others just opened to an empty space. As his fingertips trailed the cold wall of stone he paused at the door at the end of the hallway. It was one that didn’t open, and he never felt inclined to force it.
Luna, Hermione, and Neville all looked at him worriedly and he tried to give them an encouraging smile.
Harry grinned because he was that.
“But why, Murphy’s never been interested in anyone else,” there was a crackle in the air and Harry breathed out of his nose.
The familiar sound of the results of
Luckily, a few moments later Vernon staggered backwards, panting in the corner chair and Harry was relieved to see the beefy form slouch over. He finally passed out for the night.
He couldn’t imagine how a relationship between them would work, having been enemies since their first year there was murky water between the two; Ron would have blown a casket if he knew, while Hermione would have thrown herself into the research. Shaking his head, he pushed aside what the others would think, it wasn’t their choice, it was his. He knew too, that he didn’t have to decide right then, but something in the back of his mind was telling him that right now was important.
and Harry was thrown back several feet, smashing into a pile of chairs that were stacked. Pain shot through his body like knives and he could feel numerous cuts tear at his skin. Winded, Harry struggled to sit up having realized that he had lost his wand.
They had been working on conjuring a flock of birds for the last week and today was the day they would show McGonagall what they were able to produce.
A comfortable silence settled between them as Harry opened his door and even before the door fully shut Harry found himself wrapped up in the Veela’s arms with Draco’s nose pressed into the base of his neck.
Seeing stars Harry staggered upwards, vision swimming, as he tried to make out who was coming towards him. The red hair was a giveaway and bracing for a spell Harry was caught off guard as he felt a burst of pain blossom on his cheek from where Ron’s fist had connected with it, followed shortly by another.
A minute before he was expected to start his detention both Slytherin’s walked into the Potions classroom. Snape was sitting at his desk and as the door closed behind them his eyes looked up and when he saw Draco, he let out a sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“It happened at the beginning of term Severus,” black eyes briefly flickered between the two.
“I am Mister - ” his face flushed as he realized he had never caught the man’s name, the gentleman waved his hand in understanding.
Making his way through the hallways Harry headed for the entrance to the common room when he noticed that both Malfoy and Zabini were hunched over whispering, neither would have noticed him had he not bumped into a chair a knocked it over. Both boys jump and Harry felt the blood rush to his cheeks, giving them a nodded he picked up the chair and made for the entrance in record speed.
“A Veela you say? Well no need to apologize, you’re concerned for you mate,” Merope waved her hand and Draco finally seemed to catch up on the earlier words Harry had said.
It was a beautiful bathroom with a large shower and tub. There were two sinks in the middle and another door leading off towards the toilet. It was a mesh of silver and white and all Harry could think about was that the color scheme suited his mate. Waiting until the shower was warm and the room filled with steam he stepped in, groaning as the water pressure eased the stress in his shoulders.
Smirking, Harry picked up a few items that he knew Blaise could enjoy. Pausing and tilting his head to the side, Harry had an odd feeling that he was being watched. Keeping one ear towards Luna and Neville chatting beside him he peered down to the end of the isle.
There was Seviper, curled up motionlessly and unresponsive. Placed innocently next to him was a white box, the size of the palm of his hand with a folded piece of paper atop it.
“I, uh, sure,” the boys didn’t move, and Harry looked at them with confusion.
“Where’s Draco? I want to see him,” the creature blinked.
“No, thank you for your help,” so far Harry had only heard the parents and the teen couldn’t help but wonder where the youngest Malfoy was.
He had spent most of his time in the library looking at the various text that filled the shelves. The library was huge, it was two floors with a long table running down the middle of the first floor, circular staircases gave for easy access between levels. Candles and warm lights illuminated the corners and Harry felt mesmerized by his findings, he made a mental note to apologize to Hermione for all teasing he had ever directed at her regarding her love for books. There were rows of defense books, light magic, dark magic, advance transfiguration and countless books on potions, over half the first floor was dedicated to potions; the ingredients, techniques, cauldrons, and everything in between.
“The Prefects and Head Boy and Head Girl will show everyone to their rooms, I will have schedules tomorrow at breakfast,” as students began to disperse Harry shifted from one foot to the other.
Harry was beginning to hate the suits of armors.
“You’re my mate, Potter,” mouth opened Harry stared, stunned.
The following week had gone relatively smooth and between his potions and an overprotective Veela, Harry was looking forward to things going back to normal, whatever that was.
“I’m not to take you to see the young Master as he’s still asleep,” Harry’s mind whirled.
“Some lingering pain, and I wouldn’t have changed my decision,” Draco said hotly, and Harry gave him a sheepish grin, the blonde likely felt his remorse through the bond.
When his clock chimed midnight and Draco made a move to get up Harry clenched him tighter.
“Mister Potter, when my son said he was inviting a guest over to the manor during break I hadn’t seen it in the cards that it would be you,” it was curiosity lacing her tone and Harry moved slightly in his seat glancing upwards at Blaise hoping the teen would interject.
“I see your saddled yourself with an incompetent mate, even unable to do the simplest thing as plating his own food,” the words were laced with irritation and the smile that had been on Harry’s lips vanished immediately, Draco stilled and shifted towards his own plate.
“Why are you guys here?” she looked towards the window longingly.
“I kept tabs on Tom in the time following our last encounter and found that he had been employed at Borgin and Burkes, but then, he disappeared,” tugging at his beard his eyes found Harry’s.
Tom struggled to stand, and Harry could understand the concern Mister Malfoy had expressed earlier, this wasn’t the Voldemort that the Wizarding World had come to fear, this was a broken man.
Draco seemed as if he was done talking about his parents, about what had happened weeks ago, and Harry was all to eager to comply.
“Harry, Harry,
Figuring that he had to be emotional he thought back to his summers at the Dursley’s and his anger came quickly. Thinking to all the times his Uncle hit him, his Aunt starved him, and his cousin tortured him, his anger quickly escalated, and suddenly, the quill levitated too. Shocked, Harry’s thoughts of the Dursley’s derailed.
“Mother, Harry isn’t my boyfriend, he’s my friend, and I invited him here for break as he rarely leaves Hogwarts aside from the summer months,” she raised an eyebrow and set her cup down gently.
Back at the Riddle manor Harry wandered the halls and felt the familiar nostalgic feeling that he recalled during the nights he spent with Merope.
Not recognizing any of the Prefects, except for Zabini and Malfoy, Harry spied each of them as they would raise a hand when their name was said.
Harry chuckled.
“Three Broomsticks Harry?” returning the smile with one of his own the group made their way into the warmth of Madam Rosmerta’s pub.
“How long ago was this,” his mind was in overdrive, he knew that he could try to get Esmelda back to the common room, yet the absent Anderson was worrying him, and he hadn’t seen anyone on his trek to where Esmelda was.
“Did you see Hermione and Blaise?” he asked to fill the silence, while it wasn’t awkward by any means he had started to notice something between the two.
He suddenly had the feeling he was witnessing something that the ring wanted him to see.
Neville arrived back not a moment too soon with a pile of food, he had even grabbed something for Blaise and Draco, to which both grunted their thanks; Neville flushed and squeezed in between Luna and Hermione on the opposite bench.
But now he wasn’t dreaming, no, sixteen-year-old – Savior of the Wizarding World, was crammed back into his cupboard nursing his busted cheek and trying to not agitate the cuts on his back. It had been three days since his Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley had left and while Harry had become accustomed to the abuse that came daily from his Uncle since his first summer home from Hogwarts, the first time the beefy hand had connected with his son’s face Petunia bundled her little Duddydums and left.
In the middle of the box laid the pocket watch that he had got Draco for Christmas. Yet it wasn’t the watch that had made him sick, it was the copper smell that wafted up from it and the dried red stains that blemished the traditionally polished silver.
“When a Veela turns sixteen there can be a pull that they feel towards their mate, it’s unlikely that the mate lives in the immediate vicinity of them so Mother and Father took me to various places over the summer to see if I felt the pull. We were passing by another town and I felt drawn to Flagley,” still sounding smug it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes.
“So, when did you feel the spark?” it was Missus Malfoy that had asked the question and Harry appreciated that there was nothing but curiosity lacing her tone.
But Harry had.
“Welcome students,” Professor McGonagall paused, and gave one of her rare smiles, “when I call your name please come forward and have the hat placed on your head.”
They were at the end of the train station, just past where they had left at the start of break and it was empty except for a few people wandering about towards the front of the train. Giving Blaise a wary look his friend gave him a sheepish smile.
Harry watched as Murphy was quick to bring up his own shield in protection.
“Harry, that should have been the first thing you did once you found out what type of dream it was,” Blaise admonished gently.
“Luna, he couldn’t,” she said softly.
“You’re mine,” the blonde roared and in a blink of an eye Harry found himself pressed up against the closed door and Draco’s tongue pressing against his own.
“Speak up I can’t hear you,” he hissed and jerked out of the way as Draco’s arm flung out as if attempting to hit what every had spoken.
Looking towards Murphy he could see the teen trying to wave away the whirlwind of snow.
It was a tense few minutes before Draco opened his eyes and glanced towards his friend, his Veela side was still present but Harry could feel his mate start to calm down.
“Who,” snapped Draco, pushing aside the anger that bubbled Harry squinted, mulling over the idea that his previous best friend attacked him.
“Tom was always interested in the Dark Arts during his time at Hogwarts, it was evident with his career choice that he was planning something, but,” Dumbledore’s tone changed, “I believe that if we find the Horcruxes, destroy them, we can destroy Voldemort,” Harry’s heart hammered in his chest, this was a lot to take in.
“How was hanging out with Granger, Longbottom, and Lovegood?” Harry knew that Draco had no interest in what his friends were doing but appreciated the polite gesture.
It was Blaise that burst out laughing, all composure gone, as Draco’s eyes hadn’t left his own.
“I do hope Mister Potter that with more time spent with Mister Malfoy and Zabini that you become a better liar, I do not wish to know why you suddenly want to leave during a holiday break but I assume the three of you have put some thought into this,” he said with a leveled tone and eyed each of them suspiciously, briefly Harry imagined how different this was than when he was being lectured by Professor McGonagall.
It was Wednesday after dinner when Draco was finally able to leave the Hospital Wing. Harry had only been made aware of it as he witnessed a bunch of his housemates rushing around the common room in excitement while a few of the sixth years had gone to escort him down to the dungeons. He had always known that Draco was popular but watching the Slytherin’s drop their guard as one of their own returned solidified that belief.
Sorry. The kids just went kinda crazy
‘I used to have great taste in everything,’ I say, and the laugh is out suddenly. It sounds hollow. I pick up the sugar bowl. ‘I left a perfectly good bloke there.’
Draco kissed his forehead, his lips warm, brushing gently against the scar and Harry closed his eyes against the welling emotion. Draco Malfoy was kissing his scar. The scar he’d insulted all of their lives.
He moved his hand to his crotch, fingers over the buttons of his trousers. Harry made to move closer. Draco let out a chuckle. Slowly, he crossed his legs.
‘I never thanked you for anything-’ he starts.
Actually, in that version of reality he should be Harry.
‘You came back,’ he said.
I think of drowning, of silence and stillness, inside his mouth.
He took out his wand and had the glasses on the side table filling with water. Josh picked one up and drank, Draco waved his wand and lifted the other two glasses. He drank his then grabbed the other one and reached for Harry. He brought the glass to Harry’s lips and Harry drank.
Harry thought he’d imagined it, but Draco said it again, as the tip of his cock breached his hole. Harry’s whole body tensed at the intrusion, sweat breaking on his temple, and he forced himself to relax around the cock he wanted so badly inside him. He breathed in deeply, concentrating on the feeling of Draco’s fingers running up and down his leg, soothing him. So gentle… Harry looked at Draco, searching his eyes. Draco seemed about to ask something but Harry stopped him.
I only stop at the familiar sight of it. The quiet hidden spot behind the castle. My knees buckle. I fall to the ground. I'm about to throw up. My hands sway in a strange way before me.
He untangles from you to light the lamp by the nightstand. It gives off a dimmed light, filling his room with shadows. There’s a large, and (you can bet) comfortable bed at the center, sparse decoration, but you can’t pay attention to any of it.
I look at him. He still has that smile.
I was surprised to find mine still working.
He laughs. It’s a nervous laugh.
‘I can never reach you unless I’m injured and begging you to touch me,’ he says in the silence that follows. ‘You fuck me when I’m out of my mind with pain. I fuck you when you’re numb with drinking. I want more than that.’
My eyes are closed. I feel the walls of the castle towering over me. They no longer feel familiar.
‘Oh no, you’re not. Not yet,’ he breathes on my neck.
Harry bit his lip. He was ashamed of the sounds he was making inside his head. He didn’t know if he could just let it all out, not before Malfoy.
A boy leaves the castle at night. He walks fast in a straight line, towards the lake. He’s going to end his life.
That night, there’s something different about the way he fucks you. He’s fucked you hard and brutally many times before; he’s also been slow and gentle before. This time, he takes you hard and fast, no prep, your face down on the mattress. You’re surprised at how fast you both come. He then makes you lie on your back and works you open again with his fingers, sucking you until you feel like you’re floating out of your body. You come hard down his throat. You close your eyes just for a little while, your nose in his hair, his hands on your waist.
‘Well, fuck.’
Draco felt exhilarated.
Harry dragged his hands over Draco’s back, one of his hands searching wildly under his shirt, and finally he was touching Draco’s skin. They were kissing again, slow and desperate. He was falling inside Draco’s mouth, falling falling falling and it was like flying and falling at the same time and fuck… it couldn’t be. He was
‘Fuck me open, Draco...  I’ll take you. All of you.’
‘Let's fix that problem for him, shall we?’
‘Want to… god, want to suck you better than anyone ever did.’
‘And of course there’s Ron and Hermione. But there’s also…
‘Yes,’ Harry said, his hand setting over Draco’s.
I don’t even care for a retort. I also don’t have to look back to confirm any of it. Potter’s type is not exactly a state secret. It’s the infinite source of some questionable in-depth longform journalism, all of it to describe a rather simple set of characteristics: tall, blonde, gay. Pretty boys with pretty faces that look good on their knees & run their mouths every chance they get.
Malfoy placed his legs on the leather, parting them to his will. Harry turned his head to the side, smelling the leather. It was slick with his sweat, after all he’d been strapped there for what looked like hours. He felt completely exposed like this, to everyone watching, but especially to Malfoy. This way, Malfoy could fuck him better, not having to worry about lifting his weight and for Harry it would be more comfortable too. Instead of feeling the urge to hide, he felt that this was right. This was what he wanted all along. To be spread out for Malfoy to use him.
You’ll get the real thing later ;)
‘As amusing as your life is, I have my own to attend to,’ it’s a lie, but it makes him feel stronger as he turns to leave.
There were hands on his thighs and a warm breath over his cock. Then Malfoy took him whole inside his wet mouth.
But in reality you think it might be half of that time if he touches you again.
Dead.
His hands dig into my hips. I feel nothing when he touches me.
Your hands find their way in his body. It’s easier in the dark.
Draco turned to Josh.
He grimaces.
‘Dance with me,’ he says, his words gentle, like his mouth is going to be over my cock later tonight. It’s like I’ve known this Draco all my life. But I’m still unsure.
‘To make what stop?’
‘Such a demanding bottom,’ Draco said and gave a short laugh. It rippled through him, like a current of power down his legs, his arms, his fingers. A dozen or so ways of making Harry confess his every fantasy came to Draco’s mind in the space of a heartbeat.
He felt trapped in a world filled with Draco Malfoy. His demanding voice that could be cold and sweet all at the same time, his hands so cruel and gentle, his eyes that could pin Harry down like restraints, even if he could not see them.
‘Ask nicely,’ Malfoy drawled, and his lips curled up into a teasing smile.
He wants to make sure I want him. I want him to be sure.
‘Is that all?’
He wants me. And my body has always had a prefered choice of poison.
Harry gave a curt laugh, then looked away from him, his eyes on a spot on Draco’s clavicule.
‘No. But you want me.’
‘If you want to, I mean,’ his next words shook. ‘I’ll be whatever you want. Whatever does it for you, whatever kink, I’ll-’
‘Does that mean?...’
Draco was muttering against his face, kissing along his jaw.
Harry was falling asleep, too exhausted to realise what was even happening. He felt another pair of hands on him. Josh’s. He heard him speak to Draco, voices low and he didn’t get the words. Draco’s hand was brushing over his leg, gentle, Josh was softly thumbing his wrists, as they kept talking. He was so tired he couldn’t get anything of the conversation, he couldn’t even manage to open his eyes, he just wanted their hands to not leave him. This was the moment when he became fully Josh’s again. He whimpered weakly, as Josh nuzzled him against his chest. His heart was beating loudly.
Draco’s lips stretched into a smile. He let his eyes linger on Harry’s cock. What a pretty sight, all red and painfully hard. He was intending on keeping it like that for a very long time. When he looked up, Harry’s face was a wreck.
But mostly, he takes you on his bed. Slow and purposeful. He learns your ways, he takes your cock in hand and works you up until you’re babbling, incoherent,
Harry’s answer was a wide smile. Dimples formed at the corner of his lips when he looked down - at his soft cock, covered in come that was drying up, then at Draco’s ruffled, dirty clothes, his hard cock covered in Harry’s come. They’d made a mess of themselves, really.
She doesn’t even blink. Her long fingernail clinks on the wood of the counter.
‘We have to pack, don’t we?’ he asks softly.
‘It’s fine,’ you say.
‘Not for this,’ you say, which is the truth. Work has been hell. Every waking hour has been hell, except for this.
His lips stretch in a sort of smile. His focus shifts entirely to your cock. His lips part. He breathes deeply and the warmth of his breath sips through the fabric of your pants. Even before he moves to do it, you know he’s going to be good. So good at it.
But when you look at him, he just looks scared. He’s afraid of what you might say, like you’re the wild card for him, not the other way around. It makes you hope.
‘Why do you think I keep turning them down?’
He doesn’t care.
It’s the ritual, again. Pure darkness. You and him.
into you. He just never thought you’d want him again.’
Draco turned the collar in his hands. Harry lifted his chin up, exposing his throat. Draco’s fingers brushed his neck as he pulled the strap of leather around and buckled it carefully at the back. It sat comfortably on Harry’s neck. Draco lowered himself so that his eyes were just slightly above Harry’s. His finger curled around the ring.
He takes a slow swig of his Firewhisky. I watch as he swallows. I can’t breathe.
‘Imagine what the Headmistress would say,’ his voice is almost soft, but dead cold. ‘A Death Eater hexing one of the students out of duelling class... You’d be out of here in a heartbeat- and you can’t afford that, can you?’ His smile broadens. ‘You have to behave. Everyone knows your family is ruined.’
‘What, Harry?’
‘Let’s go to one of the private rooms,’ Draco said, finally turning to Josh.
‘Oh, Draco, you really don’t want to do that,’ he says with a wide smile, catching his breath.
I know he’s talking about what I just told him, but it seems like he means more. He does mean more. He means the War. He means everything. The tip of his finger brushes against my cheek. Gentle, the most intimate thing.
I find myself smirking at him.
Draco felt speechless. A thousand things he needed to say got trapped in his mouth. Harry was watching him. There was no easy way to say it.
There was the crack of a flogger cutting the air.
His tongue slides inside my mouth. It goes there tenderly, but there’s so much hunger in it. It’s not an invasion, it’s something I want and I’m so glad I waited, I’m so glad that even though he’s not my first in other things, he is my first kiss, my first real kiss.
He feels so good inside me. I’m flying & anchored down to the earth at the same time. I can take on anything, even if I’m only taking his cock, even if he doesn’t belong to me. I bring my mouth over his.
His fingers brush a strand of my hair behind my ear. He’s touched me before, but this feels too good to be true.
‘I’m not.’ He slants me a determined look.
I realise that since this thing between us started, I never saw him in daylight. He’s wearing Muggle clothes, but they’re not his club clothes (skintight jeans, the even tighter shirts stretching nicely across his chest, his usual garb for picking up not-so-innocent blondes). Instead of those, he’s using plain clothes, maybe they’re his weekend, spend-time-with-his-friends type of clothes. I wouldn’t know. What I do know is that he looks good. His dark hair looks bright, even if as untidy as ever. The green in his eyes looks greener somehow. Maybe it has something to do with the turtle neck, cozy green sweater he is wearing. I can barely stand to look at him.
Harry wanted to stay like that forever, his cock hard, Malfoy pressed against his pained back and arse, Malfoy’s arms around him, Malfoy’s voice on his ear.
Harry answered with his mouth against Draco’s chest, the words rumbling there.
‘It’s all just a game to you.’ I mutter. I never meant to say that & for a moment I think he didn’t catch it, the music way too loud, pressing up around us. But he is close, gaze right on my lips. Something bright flashes in his eyes. I can’t read him. He glances at the dance floor, where anonymous bodies move under the flashing lights.
Harry’s heart hammered. His head swam and his whole body was trembling from the interrupted orgasm. He fought to be able to speak, his throat closing down on him.
As if answering him, Harry turned his head. With his arms free, he could adjust his position and now his eyes were again trained on the darkness surrounding Draco. Josh resumed the flogging, the first blow eliciting a low growl from Harry, his lips falling open, his legs straining to keep him up, his eyes unwavering.
His hand brushes the collar of your shirt, his fingers already starting on your buttons. You stop him, your hand over his.
‘Yes.
‘I’m so sorry...’ he says. ‘Tell me what you need. I’ll do anything.’
You open the door and he’s there.
‘You’re worrying too much,’ Harry said, his hand lifting up to Draco’s face.
I feel frozen to the floor, holding my pants up, the sleeve of my robes hanging loose, ripped. He steps closer to me and I can’t move. My eyes are fixed on the wand on the floor, my heart racing.
‘You wish,’ Draco smirked at him.
For he could never be a cup of tea.
Potter takes a deep breath. He looks at Draco. Determined.
‘You’re nothing if consistent.’ I say dryly.
Truth is…  nobody cares what happens to the hero after the story is over.
In all the times we’ve fought, he never once used his famous signature move. No
‘Harry, be a good boy and tell us why I had to say no to three perfectly good blokes. I’m sure Draco wants to hear all about it.’
The want in his eyes is so clear that for a moment I think he’s going to drop to his knees in front of me and suck me off. The thought surely crosses his mind, because he looks down, eyes fixed on the bulge in my trousers.
‘Hating on each other and arguments? I don’t think we need a change in relationship status for that.’
Someone is laughing hysterically. Someone who shouldn’t be laughing, because this is not funny, not funny. I put my hands on my face and they’re wet, and bloody, and I’m trembling, trembling, laughing. He’s helping me up, but I don’t want his help. Everything burns and then I feel so cold, so cold. These dirty hands, they’re not mine. They can’t be. They’re tainted. He should get away from me. I push him back and feel the ground coming up, the blackened sky hurtling down, the trees spinning towards me.
I’m not in the habit of stalking him, but the truth is I was worried. Even when he’s gone for a whole day, like today, he always comes back to the room.
Then one day the inevitable happens. He meets Hermione and Ron as we’re walking out of my room. I freeze, but he doesn’t. He says good morning, says he’s heading down for breakfast. I’ll save you a seat, he adds to us as he leaves.
Mother thanked him, of course. His answer, if I remember correctly, was that he also had something to thank her for. I have no idea what they were talking about and I couldn’t care less.
‘We look good together,’ I say.
‘You think you don’t deserve me,’ he says. ‘You’re wrong. Let me show you you’re wrong.’
I can look, but not touch.
actually means yes, and I’m glad he gets it. He picks me up and my legs wrap around him and then he’s walking us out of the kitchen, towards the stairs.
The last spell is different: it leaves your fingers sticky and wet. You circle his hole.
‘I thought… either you’re here to get drunk alone, or you’re waiting for something,’ I lift my arm up, unthinking.
In the end, it’s all in the way he doesn’t look that Ravenclaw in the eye.
‘Spell damage. Auror related injuries. I don’t know the specifics, but the last one had Hermione sleeping over at the hospital. He’s out of danger now, back to work. But that’s what got me thinking, because he was acting out and you were here, like you’re back on house arrest, but instead you’re probably just avoiding him-’
‘Just fuck me.’
‘I want you. Want you to…’ he swallowed around the words. ‘Fuck me.’
The cold night air is blissful. The buzz of voices fades behind the closing doors. The quiet and dark suits you better of late. It’s something you seem to have in common with him.
The second I recover from his curse, I pay him back with interest. He blocks the first one, misses the next. I watch him fall to the floor, clutching at his chest, gasping loudly for air. These are the sounds I love. Anger, resentment and challenge. It’s all in there, as he fights to breathe, his fingers clutching his wand.
So of course I have to fuck it all up again. That’s what we both seem to do best.
. My heart jumps to my throat when he turns his head and sees me walking over.
And really, there’s no finesse to it. As far as pickup lines go, it’s pretty crass. And yet.
Draco felt like crying out. His cock was in heaven, there was no other way to put it. His fingers traced a path over Harry’s cheek, feeling for the swell of his cock under the skin. Harry pulled back, spit trailing from Draco’s cock to his lips.
Harry made a strangled sound with his throat and he cupped Draco’s face.
‘You don’t want him,’ he says. He sounds cocky, confident, and I curse my cock for enjoying that.
That’s when he sees it. He’s completely sure it wasn’t there before.
I barely have time to take in his admission. His hand covers mine and drags it up to his thigh. He looks up at me. Every doubt leaves my mind. We’re so close I could kiss him, but I want him to do it. He has to want it like I do.
He searches for his cigarette silver case, fishes it from his coat pocket, but just shuffles it between his hands.
‘You’ve been hard for hours. Did you know that?’
Draco stared at him, in awe. God, he wanted to take Harry now, like this, exhausted and abused. He wanted him on his lap, wanted to kiss that damp forehead, wanted his hands all over that body, but he wouldn’t, not just yet. He leant down. His mouth brushed lightly against the corner of Harry’s lips.
‘Parkinson.’
They were alone. Harry looked at Draco, green eyes clear like mornings.
. Their cocks brushed together.
He looks haunted. And I know, deep inside, that this is the complete truth.
‘You. All the time. Thing is… I think you like it. A little bit.’
I turn back to look at Potter. Our eyes meet. Lights flash, rainbows between us. I’ve known him all my life and it’s like I can’t stop noticing the little changes in him. He’s thinner; it shows on his face, under his recently grown beard. The beard fits him, goes well with his careless, worn-out hero look. He still carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. It’s in the way he leans against the counter, slumped, lost; it’s also in the fact that he’s on his seventh drink. I counted them. I also count how many times he avoids anyone wanting to chat him up. So far, three blokes, one girl. He’s not into people. Not into
You’re already warm and clean, in a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, searching the house like mad for a flask of sleeping potion when the doorbell rings.
I’m glad he’s back.
Indifferent to all of it, Potter leans over the counter, peers over at my nearly finished drink. I see the hint of a smile tugging at his lips. The scent of his aftershave is maddening.
You're still considering it when sleep drags you under.
Our kiss is a thing of desperation. Slow. Liquid. I get drunk again on the wine on his tongue, and he grinds against me, his nails scraping my jacket. We never use magic. Our urgency translates better when he undresses me with trembling hands, when my fingers struggle to unbutton his shirts, when he palms me through my trousers. He does it now.
If words are a prayer, that’s what I do then. I pray they can be gone with the rain.
I don’t know why or when I start to cry. I just realise it’s happening when his tongue reaches my hole. I collapse on the bed, biting into the pillow to keep the sounds in. He eats me out like I’m his favourite dessert. He is in no rush to move things forward, in fact, he could probably do this the rest of the night. Make me come like this, without ever touching my dick, without even fingering me. The idea makes me feel like I’m going mad, my brain screaming things I’d never say, terrible things like
Josh removed the gag and Harry coughed, traces of saliva dripping down his jaw. Draco had the sudden urge to trace them with his fingers, wiping them off his face. He didn’t act on it.
Harry was shy and awkward all of a sudden, his body drained, his heart wanting. He looked at Draco’s lips. They were just there, so close.
He works by the light on the tip of his wand. He finds the office lights too bright, they give him headaches. He finishes his paperwork, files the reports, cleans his desk. Everything in its place, as it should be. The sight of orderly things grounds him. Assures him the sun will rise again in the morning.
So she’s our child again? She looks so happy, I wish you could be here
‘So.’
‘I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t fucking work and I fought way too hard to be where I am at the Ministry,’ I say. ‘Not all of us are famous War heroes and have our jobs guaranteed because we’re fucking reckless and not afraid to die.’
Draco had no fucking doubt about that. He let his thighs spread on the couch, watching as Harry’s eyes darted to the swell under the fabric.
For the first time in months, I feel brutally alive.
‘How do you want me?’ You ask, standing up, fully naked.
Harry gave him a short smile, and very slowly placed a kiss over his left thigh, that delicious mouth brushing over his hairs, going gently upwards.
Draco chuckled. His hand came up to Harry’s jaw and forced it up. Harry was faced with hungry grey eyes on his, and he burned, heart frantic on his chest. Those eyes made anything worthy.
And doesn’t that hurt like a fucking hex to the heart. I lean back, still twirling his favourite drink in my hand. I like the memories it brings better than its actual taste.
Harry looked up at him.
He smirked and Harry blushed harder. Draco coiled the leash around his arm, tugging Harry closer so that their lips were almost touching when he spoke.
Mcgonagall is giving me the eye
I take off my heavy winter coat and take a seat across the table, feeling his eyes on me. The waitress comes over and I ask her for a cup of strong Earl Grey. He’s already holding a cup of warm coffee in his hands. Neither of us says a word.
Like he was doing once more.
His lips twist in disapproval. Great, now he just hates me some more.
Draco glanced at Harry. He watched the heat climbing up his neck, the faint red covering his cheeks, his chest heaving. It was clear that he loved to be discussed like this, like he wasn’t even there and didn’t have a say in it. That was damn perfect, because Draco had a thing for making his subs go crazy with just the right words. It doubled the pleasure - saying everything he meant to do and then doing it.
I guess it had to happen. I’ve been getting away with too much, anyway.
He gives me the first real smile not filled with sadness.
I’m not sure any of this is real.
, he’s not wrong.
I can tell I also need some time to get used to it. All I can think of is sinking my hands in his hair and kiss him until I lose what’s left of my breath.
‘Yes. Yours.’
‘Yeah. That’s what Parkinson- I mean, Granger-Parkinson-’
There’s the castle, and the night, and the way, and the lake, all silent and the same.
Aren't you at work?
I can feel the push and pull of his magic building up momentum all around me. That’s when I decide to hit him with three hexes all rolled up into one. It’s a neat trick I’ve been wanting to try out. He doesn’t block it, but instead evades it, jumping quickly to the side. I hear something crash loudly somewhere in the room. He curses me, I block it, he falls down cursing me again and now my skin feels blazing hot. I no longer can tell where one spell ends and another one begins.
You can’t quite sleep, not even with your usual dose of Dreamless Sleep. You lie in bed all day, in your pyjamas, staring at the ceiling. You ignore the frequent buzz in your Floo downstairs. Hermione shouldn’t worry, really.
‘It’s fine if you like him, Harry.’ She says after a while. She always saw right through me and I fumble for an explanation.
He takes out another cigarette from a silver case. You wait for him to light it, but instead he holds it in front of you. Before you can think it over, you’re leaning forward, your lips closing around the tip. His fingers twist again, you inhale, the other end of the cigarette alights. You nearly shiver. The smoke exits your nostrils and you try not to cough. You rarely ever smoke.
And I realise that I really want to kiss him. If I’m being honest, it’s not even the first time I want it. But I don’t move to do it. Instead, I rest my head on his shoulder. He doesn’t push for an answer and he doesn’t push me away. His arms come up around me. He has no idea how peaceful he makes me feel.
like me, that he did what he did for his family. How can I say to her that he didn’t hand me over to Voldemort, that he lied about not recognizing me and that later on his own mother lied too and that those two lies changed everything. It’s too much. Even thinking it — is too much. My thoughts get all confused when the issue is Draco Malfoy. But worse than all of this, how can I explain to her
You kiss me like you don’t want to die anymore.
‘I don’t wanna talk about it,’ I mutter, watching his hand on my knee, the bones on his fingers, the slow movement of them over my jeans.
He stands under the hard rain. His hair looks nearly white, plastered to his face, his  black robes soaked through, tugging at his thin chest. His sleeves are rolled up. My eyes catch on the Dark Mark, right there, on his left arm. A crude thing. A dead thing.
Draco dragged his cock along his crease, breath stuttering quite suddenly. His eyes glinted in the light of the club and what Harry saw there eased the knot in the pit of his stomach. Draco was going to take him apart, carefully and brutally, just like Harry liked. Just like they
want you to leave. The little show we were putting on? He asked me to do that. For
Potter looks… I have no idea how he looks because I never saw him looking like this. Maybe it’s the daylight. Or the fact that we’re having tea instead of Firewhisky. I have no field guide for what’s happening here.
His voice is like a drug. It’s everything. You pull all the way back and then you push into him in one slow slide. You stop there, your arms trembling.
He walks after it. The light flies in front of him and he can almost feel its energy battering at his skin, drawing the cold away. He turns left, then right, the streets are almost empty but there are some Muggles rushing past him, friends laughing, and lights shining on every building. He reaches a square. The light is positively ecstatic at this point. It sparkles in front of his nose, then flies so fast he almost has to run to keep it in sight.
Pansy is silent. She lets me cuddle against her, but I can tell by her distant, calculating look, that she’s on to something. I don’t like it. I don’t like it at all.
She’s laughing, I’m laughing, and I hear him joining us. His laugh is a bright, gentle thing, deep, unexpected, my heart jumps to my throat. The War almost took all our laughs away. His fingers twine with mine, like it’s nothing at all.
He kicks my wand away, it rolls further to the side. I can’t reach it without getting past him. He tilts his head, admiring the spectacle I make with my robes ripped, my neck probably marked by him. I fight the urge to cover myself. His eyes zero in on my mouth.
I hate that she always says his name like this. I can practically hear the italics on it. But whatever, she’s right. I don’t know when it all went wrong. When did sex became this enormous thing opening up to the abyss?
‘That’s when you what?’
‘He's playing you, hon. And you're letting him.’
‘Apparate us, Draco.’ He says finally, voice rough. I like that he also sounds a bit unhinged.
A perfect cocktail of fire & madness.
I think it’s the name Potter-Malfoy
The glass doors close behind him.
He’s so close to you, but still he doesn’t touch you. He’s waiting, daring you. You’re both standing on the edge, wondering who’ll be the first to drop. But you don’t want to drop. Not with him. You’ve fallen into bed with enough strangers, just to let some steam off. You’ve had your share of men, some women here and there. Lately, you’ve been more of a loner. Dating is a nightmare when you’re, well,
‘I thought we had a no blood agreement. No hexes.’
He looks up at me, silent, chest heaving softly & I am pretty sure this is not how a casual hookup is supposed to go. He blinks, swallows, then his eyes focus on my crotch & I forget what I was thinking. It is all very fast afterwards. I think I’m already coming, but instead I’m clutching at his hair, fucking his willing mouth, warm & sweet & hungry, his palm spreading over my hip, fingers brushing my belly, keeping me vertical, as I sink further down his throat. I come, I’m coming, he has his eyes open as he drinks me down like I’m the last in his row of drinks, the only drink he’s been really craving.
‘Just leave it, Potter. I told you: you can’t save everyone.’
‘I need to leave,’ Draco says after a while. He doesn’t move though.
‘You’re right. I’m not. I’m in love with you.’
Against his better judgement, he had found a couch in the shadows and had sat there, a glass of wine in his hand, an unimpeded view to the center of the room, where Josh had placed Harry, kneeling on the floor, hands bound behind him, lights playing on his naked body, illuminating half of his face and chest. A spot of light in darkness.
I lift my eyes up to find my best friend’s wife looking down at me.
He could be bothered by the sound he made then, but he wasn’t. Not remotely. Not even when it turned to a fucking loud groan, not when his hips snapped up harshly, his cock disappearing inside Harry’s mouth.
, then shook his head, his eyes alight with desperation.
tell you?’ I ask, feeling like myself for a second.
This time, you actually laugh.
‘You can’t like me,’ I say and squeeze his hand once, then take mine away and rise from the chair.
‘Does it hurt?’
‘Is that a no?’
‘What?!’ I lift my head up, heart climbing up my throat.
Malfoy was reaching even deeper inside him, touching secret thoughts he had pressed down. Harry wanted to relinquish all control, that was why he loved this, submitting to men. But this was
Harry blinked up at him. He inhaled deeply with his eyes closed. When he opened them he was there, fully present, and Draco stared into those eyes and lost his breath. It was so strange to look at Harry when they were both just two men again, equals, nothing else.
Josh placed a hand on his chin and lifted it up for the other man’s inspection. Josh’s finger brushed over his lower lip and Harry’s tongue darted out to lick it. He liked other men to see how good he was to his Dom. How obedient. How willing to please. He sucked on Josh’s finger slowly, taking it into his mouth. He was so aware of the man’s eyes on him, his cock was throbbing. Josh let out a low laugh. The other man was silent. There was something familiar about his particular trace of magic, but Harry couldn’t quite place it.
I watch him and force my breathing to slow down to his rhythm. Inhale. Exhale. It’s harder than it seems, to make myself breathe like I’m not under attack.
I’m finishing another glass of wine. His hands are on his lap now, one on top of the other. The image blurs and sways in front of my eyes for a moment. Then it stops. He’s touching the ring with his fingers. He turns it on his finger. Once. My heart twists. Twice. Something tugs in my chest. Thrice. I sober up in seconds. Everything looks sharper, his pale hands, the metal band, cutting his finger. He removes the ring, slowly, decisively. It shines once on his palm. Then he makes it disappear inside his pocket. My temples throb. My mouth is dry. Dinner is over.
. As I’m sure you know, since you’ve known each other the longest.’
He was always so blunt. So honest. He probably didn’t have any idea what that did to Draco.
We share it between our mouths, biting, beating.
‘Not just sleep,’ Harry smiled his sweet smile that made Draco dizzy.
‘I- You have to know that-’ I hesitate, trying to find the words. ‘It’s not your fault, Draco.’
‘I feel…’ he breathes out. He shuts his eyes, he feels pliant and easy, and I sink into the rhythm seeping through me. It’s easy. Like dancing.
11 p.m. He’s the only one left at the office. No surprise, really.
wasn’t lost on Draco, nor the smile Josh was giving him.
‘I’m so sorry.’ He says, ‘I’m so sorry this happened to you.’
‘You’re going to be such a good boy for me, aren’t you?’
Harry had never been kissed like that, like he was about to die and Draco was a lifeline. But he wasn’t the only one. Draco looked lost in it too, his hands tugging at Harry’s hair, and face and neck, too intimate, too close, too… lovingly. Harry tangled his hands on the blond hair, marvelling at how soft it was, his fingers rubbing against Draco’s scalp.
‘He does remind me of a younger you…’ He says. ‘Minus the Death Eater act-’ Potter gives a wry laugh, like the jerk that he is, tilting his head in the general direction of the bloke. ‘But then again, you were never really that good at playing bad.’
Harry reached down with his mouth over Josh’s bulge, breath stuttering. Then his teeth were on the zipper, pulling it down, slowly. Josh lifted his hips up, the swell of his cock rubbing against Harry’s nose.
It’s not a question. I don’t need to tell her anything else, but I feel like doing it all the same.
‘Baby,’ he whispers. And then his hands cup me and I’m in heaven, so desperate that I take too much time noticing what he’s actually doing.
(when before it had said, impersonally, DM) was way too much.
‘Men love my mouth,’ he said.
‘We’re not here to have a casual chat.’ He presses on. I shudder at the slight undertone of impatience in his voice.
‘Here?’
‘Fuck.’
Harry tastes like strawberries and whisky, Draco thinks. Warm liquid fire.
‘I think it’s a bit different with us… you know?’
Draco took the leash and hung it on the ring. His hand slipped down the leather, fingers curling around the handle. He took a deep breath. He tugged at the leash and Harry looked up.
Josh laughed, his chest rumbling, his voice sweet against Harry’s neck. He felt relief washing over him, his mouth searched for Josh’s and they kissed, slowly, gently. The kiss sealed the night, it signaled the moment when he became Josh’s. Everything was fine. But Harry was still terrified. He’d never been taken like this.
‘How desperate are you?’ he asks, bringing my wrists up above my head & keeping them there, trapped.
he thought suddenly.
- was Malfoy’s for the taking. Whatever he wanted to touch, to have, to taste, was his.
‘You had ten.’
Trust is more about faith than it is about blindly following someone. The Dark Lord never understood the difference. Harry Potter is someone people can believe in. Someone I can believe in. He won the War because people needed to believe in something and they believed in him. I still believe in him and I don’t think my trust is misplaced. No matter what we did to each other, everything’s different now.
, then I go for his throat with a curse. We fight like we’re at war. It’s like we never really left. He blocks me, I jinx him, he falls over a desk. He sends it flying over my head. It comes crashing loudly on the other side of the room.
His hand freezes over me. His other hand, pressed against the wall, tightens minutely.
‘Stop saying my name like that.’ His voice shakes.
‘I wanted to keep them,’ Harry said. The words seeped through Draco’s chest. ‘I wanted to keep your marks on me… In case we,’ Harry breathed out. ‘In case this never happened again, I wanted to remember you on me… every time I sat. Or moved. I wanted to keep you… It’s stupid, I-’
The dark is a very strange place to be for quite so long.
He smiles, almost shyly. It’s so unusual in him I just stare. And stare some more. This is what he means. No walls, because I can’t bring myself to put them up with him.
‘To be honest, I think I’m done with non-monogamy, Potter. Ethical or otherwise.’
Harry’s voice went down his spine, as Draco’s hand set on Josh’s back and pulled him closer.
‘She’s waiting, Pans,’ he says, as his hand climbs a tiny inch up.
And I never know if he will.
Magic blows up in my veins, draws down to my fingers, hits him right on the chest. His silent counterspell strikes me full force. I see white, the whole room erupts in a violent scream, but it’s as if I’m under water, swimming a thousand miles away. Deep, deep under. I taste blood in my mouth.
was exactly the type of man he had a weakness for. Inside the club, that was all that mattered. Josh wanted to watch them. Together. Josh wanted Malfoy to break Harry. And then fuck him, probably. It would please Josh to no end.
‘You don't know a single thing about him.’
Our lips part. He’s everything I knew he would be. He rests his head against mine, panting slightly. We’re both fully dressed yet, but I never felt this close to anyone. We breathe each other’s breaths. He has a question, his hand hovering close, but not touching.
. Me and him,
Harry Potter is my drug of choice.
Draco was speaking against his mouth.
Pansy presses two fingers to the sides of her nose like I’m a particular brand of nuisance she despises. She looks at me like she’s seeing me for the first time. A humourless laugh escapes her lips.
‘Draco is a pretty blonde.’ I say it like the jackass I, apparently, am.
Hands were moving up his sides and coming up from behind to hold him close. Malfoy’s arms circled around him and he heard someone sob, lost, whimpering and babbling. He took some time to realise it was his own voice, that he had passed the test, he hadn’t come with Malfoy’s tongue inside him, he had been good. Malfoy was whispering something on his ear, soft words, his lips brushing on his neck, but he couldn’t hear it, he just felt Malfoy’s hands rubbing circles over his chest, so gentle.
‘Yeah?’
I’m too aware of the fact that the other bloke is still waiting several steps away, out of ear shot, but clearly watching his supposed date hitting on another man.
Yeah, Malfoy has pink hair. Or sort of. Half of his hair is shaved short and dyed an aggressive pink. The other half is still white-blond, a strand falling over his right eye, only the left side of his face visible at all times. He turns it slightly and spots me beyond the moving bodies. He doesn’t stop dancing, a smile plays on his lips. This time I don’t look away like I used to when all this began.
‘This kiss is going to lead to sex, Potter,’ I whisper against his lips.
They meet halfway. The first boy turns, the other one catches his arm. The first boy says something in a low voice. The other boy answers him, shouting. The first boy kisses the other.
for me. Apparently, he wants me armed and ready. I want him
I fight back a wave of nausea as I recall the reason I’m here. Everything in my body hurts. I meant to go back to my dorm last night. I think I remember him asking me to stay. I refused. He said he would sleep on the floor, I could take the bed, he wouldn’t bother me. I told him that was the dumbest suggestion I’d ever heard. We argued about it for some time. But I guess we ended up falling asleep in his bed. I think it’s the first time since the end of the War that I slept through the whole night. Even after what happened.
‘That’s a… Is that another one of your fantasies?’ Draco asked, gripping the base of his cock.
I turn wildly to where this voice is coming from, terror, terror.
look at them. He had let himself fall right into them. It felt like being under a very strong
Harry Potter really was a sight for sore eyes. An
Here's the inspo for Draco's hair I used (for the colour, ignore the haircut): https://pin.it/vbjdeag2rhh6cb
‘Yes.’
Harry’s eyes were on him. Driving him skywards when he needed to stay grounded.
He opens his coat, then his hand drops to his trousers. You watch him unbutton and unzip with his left hand. He doesn’t say anything, just looks at you, exhaling the smoke.
‘And you’re delusional if you think I can sleep with you naked. There’s only so much I can take,’ his tone is amused, tender, and I’ll deny melting at the sound of it until the end of my days.
‘You’re so amazing, the most beautiful slut I’ve ever seen in my life.’
‘Draco, I-’
It wasn’t a provocation, Harry realised. It was an honest question, one that showed care. He’d been cleaned and rimmed, but he knew it was going to hurt. No matter, because he liked it, he liked it a bit rough, a little on the side of painful, and he knew Draco would be careful. The thought made something twist inside Harry, something he did not want to be feeling because it really complicated things.
Harry looks at me.
‘Who?’
, he didn’t say it, but thought it. Then he thought no more of anything. There was only his hand on his cock, his heavy breathing, his will keeping the orgasm at bay and, more importantly, Harry’s plaintive half-scream of surprise. Harry shook, almost falling forward if not for Josh’s hands on him, keeping him up.
‘Yes,’ my mouth forms the word. There’s this drumroll of need drawing us together. His lips are right there, chapped from the cold. He’s going to, he’s...
He could jump. He could fall.
Wait, what? Seven?... He knows how long we've?- My thoughts are in a complete disarray. I stay silent while I search for something to say that won’t sound completely pathetic.
‘She’s waiting, Pans,’ I say, and move my hand slightly up.
‘You fucker,’ I say, my voice low. He doesn’t seem worried. ‘If you’re not going to fuck me, I’m going to find someone who will. Tidy hair will fuck me.’
‘Give me ten minutes,’ you say, out of breath.
‘How's the withdrawal going, Draco?’ She asks, a hint of a smile on her burgundy lips.
I stare at my empty teacup and realise I’ve been lost in thought. I reach out my hand and he holds it across the table. It’s a casual gesture, but it means the world.
He looks up.
So it’s for you, reader, to speak their words.
The other boy shouted something back, something boiling, something biting, something he’d kept there in his hands, in his chest, in his mouth and before it’s all out he’s being kissed by the first boy.
‘Look at me, Harry. Did I say you could look away?’ The loving hand behind his neck was tight over his throat, hard, pressing, Malfoy’s fingers slowly suffocating him.
I take his mouth. I’m kissing him like I always wanted to.
in between us, Draco,’ Josh said. ‘We’re not in love.’
‘I’m addicted to sleeping potions.' You say. 'Since the end of the War.’
‘Harry.’
He lets the question linger, open-ended. It’s up for me to name what I want. What I have always wanted from him. With him.
‘What do you think?’ he asked in a low voice. ‘I know you’re dying to touch it.’ His tone made Harry shudder. He paused, feeling their breaths evening together, synced.
‘You’re… so expressive,’ Draco said when they broke apart, but expressive didn’t begin to cover it. Harry could drive him to orgasm with the sounds he made, that was more like it, but Draco was not about to tell him this. Harry looked down between them.
They're more alike than they know...
Draco’s fingers trailed over the leather. He held it in front of Harry’s face.
He let Harry drop to the floor, where Harry rushed to kneel again, arms tucked in position behind his back, the leash trailing from his neck to Draco’s hand. He really was a sight like that.
I stood outside the door, not knowing what to do.
. The sobs were out, as were the words.
We sip the tea in silence. It warms me up inside and the cookies taste good, lemony and ginger.
He came screaming inside Draco’s mouth, his spunk shooting between them, Draco fucking into him so deep he felt like he was being split in two. His come was splattering his own chest, Draco’s mouth crashing over his lips, biting on them viciously, and Draco was still thrusting inside him.
‘What was that, Harry?’ Draco asked.
I take a sip of my drink. Firewhisky, of course. His favourite. I find myself smirking.
Draco stopped in front of it, his hand around his shaft. He gave a it a pull, the tip nearly brushing Harry’s lips. He noticed the way Harry kept from leaning in, from doing anything else than wait in place. Draco gathered the slick at the tip of his cock. Harry’s chest heaved, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s cock.
‘You mean?...’
He yanked Harry up to a standing position, dragging him by the leash, and forcing their bodies together. He had a moment to appreciate their height difference, that made Harry tilt his head up to face him. Then he snapped hips forward with purpose, the swell of his erection grazing against Harry’s.
‘Stay the night.’
‘You never belonged there,’ Potter says in a heartbeat. Draco shots him a quick glance. Potter is also looking at the tree.
‘Look at me,’ Draco said, even though he didn’t have to. He’d never had a man watching him like Harry was, his eyes taking stock of everything they could, like Draco was a prize at the end of a painful trial.
The room was in semi darkness, two lamps in each side, lights dimmed and red toned. There was a four poster bed in the center, with a dark coverlet, and two sofas, one to the left, another to the right. A table in a corner was set with water bottles, glasses and a bowl with condoms. Since they were all wizards, they wouldn’t be needing those.
‘Just excusing myself to your shag, it’s only polite. Don’t let it be said that ex-Death-Eaters and pureblood conceited prats don’t have manners,’ I give him my best dazzling smile, feeling the clothes clinging to my skin. He looks utterly lost.
Potter comes at me, I throw a
Harry let out a breath, like falling. Draco was barely aware of Josh, of how he had lubed his cock, climbed on the bed and then rubbed his cock between Harry’s arse cheeks. Josh waited, Draco gave him a curt nod. The tip was in, just like that.
Don’t worry she’s probably arguing for the creation of a fifth house
‘What… what are you saying?’
‘No.’
I turn away, not waiting for a reaction. I don’t need one. He will follow me, I know it at my very core.
I take one breath of him, my head spins. I want to answer that my taste in men is just fine. Andrew was fine. Potter is the problem. I had a little taste of him all those months ago & I just can’t seem to get enough of it.
He says it first to the table, then he looks up at me.
‘Draco… please… please…’ he fought to speak, voice coming in cut rasps, all the air about to leave him. He blinked, his eyes wet, white spots on his vision. Malfoy was breathing heavily, like he was the one fighting for air. The hand on his throat released the grip, and Harry coughed, his body shuddering, Malfoy pressed against him, that hand, that hand going down, moving between them, but to not to touch Harry, no. Instead, Malfoy unbuckled his belt, opened his fly, no hurry in his movements, only a relentless determination in them.
‘You know… my eyes are up here,’ Draco said slowly, and Harry’s head snapped up. The green was almost dark. Harry licked his lips, swallowed. He was so fucking easy to read, Draco felt the threads of the power play coming to life around him, pulling Harry inevitably to him.
Draco scowls.
‘You’re allowed to move from now on. But you still can’t kiss me,’ Draco added.
Harry looked at him, and there was no pain left there. Only want. Josh groaned and sank into him again, slow and deep. Harry’s whole body shook.
My eyes open to a thin layer of cold light filtering from a window. Dawn is breaking. For an agonizing moment, I’m back in that classroom, those hands pushing me against stone, the hard press of a body, that smell, his breath all over me. I have no idea where I am. This isn’t my bed, or the Slytherin dorms. Nothing feels familiar. My fingers clutch hard at my wand, I sit up, cold sweat breaking at my temple. I slept armed again, like I did all through the War.
‘You've known Draco almost all your life. You've watched him for the better part of it. Just put the fucking pieces together.’
wanted. His eyes were on Draco’s.
I can’t stop the tiny laugh that bursts out of me.
That’s how I find out the truth, after weeks on high alert, obsessing over it. It feels like sixth year all over again. Only this time I have even less to go on than I did at the time. I can’t ask him again, point blank, who did it. But I need to find out who hurt him and make sure that the bastard will never do it again. Not to him, not to anyone.
‘I don’t- have- a Potter-’ I stop myself.
‘Did you know he has a kink for pure-blood cock?’
Oh god. Josh knew Harry had a thing for tall, demanding men, with lean features and hard looks. Usually with blond hair, long fingers that wrapped amazingly around his cock and a sharp, dirty, tongue. The type of man that was used to have what he wanted, when he wanted it. This one was probably exactly like that.
‘You two need some time alone,’ Josh said with a smile that held no jealousy, no hurt.
‘All week?’
‘You mean, desperate?’
He felt Malfoy shifting behind him, slowly, deliberately.
Harry stared at Draco, eyes questioning.
‘No,’ he said. And the cane twisted over his nipple. Through the haze of it, Harry saw Draco dropping to his knees, laying the cane on the floor and looking up.
And then I find myself laughing. I can’t help it. It feels strange, because I haven’t laughed in a very long time. And it’s also weird because I should be feeling like I owe him again, instead of this odd warmth, like a knot has been eased in my chest, a weight has been lifted. Like I can breathe again.
Her voice is as bright as her fancy Cartier eyewear flashing back at me. Pansy waves her wand in a precise motion & my curtains come open on the other side of the living room. I lift my hand up in front of my eyes, to block the sudden blazing light. Pansy drops her Chanel purse on the center table with a clatter. She’s dressed impeccably, of course, in a tight black embroidered dress (Hermès? Dior?). The fact that I no longer can tell Muggle luxury designer clothing apart goes to show how deeply I’ve fallen. I catch sight of a perfectly manicured hand, long vibrant dark green nails. I would compliment her on that, if my tongue wasn’t currently glued to the roof of my mouth.
He adjusted his clothes, picked up his bag. Draco wanted to thank him, but he had no words. Josh turned, lifted the wards, then he opened the door and was gone. The wards went back up again.
‘Draco-’ it sounded more like a moan than anything. It felt so good to say it.
Draco’s eyes darted to Josh, sitting on the sofa next to them, his hand caressing Harry’s leg.
‘Beautiful,’ Draco breathed. He watched them adjusting to each other, with the easy confidence of long time lovers. Josh canted his hips back, hands on Harry’s hips and there was silence and consent in everything about Harry, in the way he let his body open, in the way he never stopped looking at Draco, not even when pain hit him, not even when Josh pushed in deeper, not even when a line formed on his damp forehead, not even when he bit his lower lip, not even when he seemed about to beg Josh to stop.
His breath hits my face. Warm. A breath of distance.
‘I can’t stop thinking about you.’
There was a sudden pained scream. The sound made Draco snap out of his reverie, even if he had been transfixed by everything that was happening right in front of his eyes. The flogger stripes hit Harry on his back, the leather biting into his skin. The force of the impact made Harry squirm on the bench, his whole body shaking, the movement allowing Draco a glance at his cock. Hard, dripping against the bench, ignored as it should be. Draco felt his mouth water at the sight. Fucking hell, he was doomed.
Harry just gives me one defeated smile.
He felt tears welling up on his eyes at the words, his body melting into Draco’s. His hands tightened on Draco’s arms. They were lean and strong. He was so glad he could finally touch them.
