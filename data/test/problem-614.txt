Which meant he had a werewolf to track down and a meeting to attend. He wasn’t sure which made him cringe more a meeting with a werewolf or stepping foot into a Weasley home. Though he had to admit the twins had surprised him, they had joined him in the circle even before Sev. Which meant they held a great deal of loyalty and trust in the young Potter.
“We should get to bed.” He said standing and pulling Evan up with him. The boy just sighed and followed him up the stairs to their room. Remus watch as Evan did a silent headcount of the room before he crawled into his bed and closed the curtains.
pointless, Potter.” The blonde sneered. Then he shook Harry off, walked over and dropped onto the couch. Harry placed the book in his hand on the shelf and followed Malfoy to the couch.
The shirt felt incredible, the long sleeves were warm but not hot and the soft material felt almost like a blanket wrapped around him. He finished buttoning it and looked down. Now that it was on he could make out small design was hidden in the green, not very noticeable but there appeared to be some kind of ivy leaves stitched along the sleeves and the collar.
As Snape announced the potion the class would be making, and ordered them to get to work, Harry could feel the class’ eyes on him.
A hand appeared in front of him and he took it. Once on his feet he started running his hands down his robes trying to smooth them and get any dirt off them that might have found its way there from the floor.
“Sirius.” Remus said in a deep voice. Like he was trying to stop his friend for doing or saying something wrong.
Harry pressed his lips together and tried to think of a way to explain things to the other student with out revealing to much. He knew it needed to be believable and with Malfoy’s knowledge about magic far outweighing his, he needed to be careful of what he said, because the blonde could possible catch a lie.
The two of them stood them staring for a few moments, Remus silently cursing the blonde because he was sure he was now late to meet the two students he was supposed to be showing in. And he really hoped the two young kids didn't wander off.
SO, over the last couple days I have posted three chapters. And I have done this because I had been slacking hard on my fanfictions and I felt bad. Lol. I might add a couple more.... Also these aren't beta read. My beta reader got busy with life, so all mistakes are mine. and please feel free to point them out. Hope you enjoy :)
“Harry,” Draco said gently reaching over and taking a hold of Harry’s chin. “I want this.” Harry let out a relieved breath.
It felt strange to be standing in a circle with two older students (well ex) that he had never said a word to before, his professor and his best friends father. He knew which families stood on which sides of the war, and the fact that these four people (not counting him) had been not only civil towards each other but seemed to be in agreement to trust that this was all set up by Harry Potter and Draco surprised the hell out of him.
He looked over at Malfoy and wondered if the other boy was worried about seeing his father. He didn’t know much about Malfoy’s relationship with his mother but surely, he would be happy to see her right?
It was a couple of days after he had talked to Snape so the note made sense. But he had been expecting Lucius to tell Snape anything important and then Snape to tell him. He hadn’t planned on the man wanting to meet with him himself.
“Hey Fred,” The werewolf grinned, Fred groaned. Him and his brother had been trying for years to confuse the man, but always failed. Somehow during their fourth year it had become a game. One the older man seemed to enjoy because he never put a stop to it.
“I asked the castle to remember that room. So, we can come always get back into it. Even leave stuff there for later.” He said and started walking away.  He heard Malfoy’s hurried steps as the blonde rushed to catch up to him.
Harry Potter sat in the smallest bedroom of the house he had lived in with his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin for the last 15 years. He sat staring out his small bedroom window, trying to remind himself that he only had a few more days here. A few more days and he would be free of the depressing, suffocating aura that hung around the house, and of course the neglectful way his
“Potter!” He dropped his head, only a little grateful that he now had an excuse to walk away from the man who was still giving him a strange look.
He sighed and grabbed a dark green shirt. He snorted, at the idea that Malfoy picked it because of the color. It was soft, and he found himself running his fingers across it a few times before he unbuttoned it and slipped it on.
,” he stressed looking at Black, “They sent a letter, and I am assuming you were only allowed to read it after stepping into a Truth Circle.” Lucius nodded.
“You will find many spells in Gringotts, one of which identifies bloodlines as they enter. It is to help ensure the safety of our vaults and your items, we are interested with.” Well, he thought, that should make proving who we are easier.
“I had to guess your size, because you decided to hide over here.” Then Malfoy took the book out of his fingers and placed it back in the bag, “Now up, you have to try them on.” He stood there in shock. Malfoy was going to buy him clothes? Not only that but the blonde had taken the time to guess his size and pick things out for him? His own Aunt wouldn’t do that.
Early the next morning, Snape woke them up just before Madam Pomfrey came in to check them over one last time, before sending them off to the Great Hall for breakfast.
“We have two new students that will be arriving at the front gate in a half hour. I would like for you to greet them and show them into the Great Hall to be sorted.” The old man smiled at him.
“What do you mean.” Though he knew. Well he knew how his housemates in his time would have acted. If one of them had sat with a Slytherin. They would have assumed it was a prank at first but if nothing happened they might think it’s strange and some would probably get offended. Dammit. He hadn’t thought about that. Truth was he would take Snape over Pettigrew anyway. And wasn’t that sad.
“First we need to see if it’s just him.” His brother said quietly, not liking the idea of doubting their family. George groaned. “You don’t think dad or Bill knew? And I know Charlie wouldn’t have. He doesn’t even really know Harry. Percy hasn’t been around--”
“His dragon.” George said, as if that answered Snapes question. From the annoyed look on the professor’s face all it did was irritate him more.
“Lucius has told me that Draco and Harry have a plan? A Ritual?” Lupin asked,  the people in the room nodded. He looked at Severus, “Do you have the supplies for it?” The potions master thought about it, “All but thorn-apple but I have been assured the twins can get some, and the items needed to tether both boys.”
He knew he shouldn’t, but he ran out of the room. Needed to get as far away as he could. He made it out the door before he slammed into another person.
The first couple chapters I have switched between two POV's, because it makes the chapters read better. I don't know if I will keep this up through out the story, let me know what you think. Enjoy.
“What?” He mumbled and read it again and then a third time just to make sure. Why would Sirius tell him not to trust the headmaster? Dumbledore was their leader, their friend. Harry had been told for years to trust and have faith in Dumbledore. And now all of a sudden Sirius was telling him otherwise- it just made no sense. He felt a rush of anger towards his godfather for not giving more information. Just a little something that gave a reason or explanation for the man’s sudden lack of trust in Dumbledore. Anything that would clarify things. He knew Sirius had to be careful in case his message was intercepted, but was three words really all he could manage? Then he was confused because what could the headmaster possible done to cause Sirius to doubt him.
look for it eventually). Then he reached for his quill and an empty parchment. His hand was shaking when he dipped the quill into the ink well but the moment the tip touched the paper his hand was as steady as always when he was drawing.
in his hands but still no one around him was moving and Pansy was busy writing an answer to her last letter, smiling so bright her cheeks had to hurt. Turning back around Draco took his wand in his hand and while prescribing a circle around the player flying higher than everyone else whispered
"No, I didn't see it, I just..." Draco reached behind himself and pulled the parchment form under the rock. "Some idiot lost his homework to the wind and it blew over. The description was quite acurate though." And before she could ask another question or the sound of his pounding heart could spill his lie he let loose of the parchment, the wind pulling it away once more.
“He didn’t show. I just can read you. I can tell when it’s good old Remus being protective and when its Moony. Whatever happened set you both off and he wanted to protect Evan.” His friend said into his shoulder. Then he felt Sirius start to pull away, he felt Moony wanting to hold him more. Keep him close because he smelt great, like to many things that meant home and love to them.
“Now, as for money.” The goblin said, handing them two different pieces of parchment, “This we have planned for, you fill these out, and we set up a vault, no connected to your families, we place an allotted amount inside, that you have access to. We will keep track of what you spend and if need be add more, “The goblin took a second, “Then when you return home, the amount used is removed from you vault to pay back the bank.” Harry looked down at the paper, in his hand. “If, however,” He head Grimmhook go on, “you do not find a way to return, you have until that times comes naturally to you, to pay back, the amount.”
They both understood what the goblin was saying, but it still felt wrong. Fred looked over at George, “Should we?” He asked. His twin looked at the envelopes. “If it’s as important as it sounds, “George said with a sigh, “Then I think Harry would be okay with it. As long as we can give them to him later?” The last bit was said to the goblin who nodded.
“I know.” Lupin whispered kneeling down in front of his friend, feeling that this was personal, Lucius quietly got to his feet and walked out of the hut. He didn’t have to wait for long for Lupin joined him.
Malfoy opened his mouth, but Harry was fast to cut him off, “She was using it to attend classes, but…” He hesitated, would Malfoy tell anyone what he was about to say. Were his uncertain fears enough to but Sirius and Buckbeak in danger.
“What do you mean?” Charlie asked, as he moved closer to his brother so he could feel the smooth scales. He wondered if Bill was bothered as the twins joined him and Percy. But when he looked up he saw only amusement.
“Fuck,” He cursed, what the hell happened. How did they get from inside the castle to where ever they were? He turned around trying to see how far away the school was but it wasn’t there. It looked like they were on some kind of hill, and when he looked down he could see a small town. One he didn’t recognize.
James looked up when he walked in and he could actually feel his friends eyes roaming over him. Taking him in making sure he was okay. Remus stuck his tongue out playfully and quietly walked towards them.
“Now,” The women said, “ I can not send you back to school, but maybe I can access your families floo? She asked.
“I must have each of you swear, that what you will not speak of what you learn here today. Not to anyone not locked inside the circle with you.
Harry was hit with an urge to back away, he didn’t know where it came from, but it took effort to keep his feet from moving. He did however see Mafloy’s head snap up suddenly and weird frown on the blonde’s new face.
“So, you’re the proof.” Luc said eyeing the twins, “That Potter and Draco are for some reason working together.”
When the redhead poured him another he chuckled lightly and looked around the room. Charlie was sitting on the couch running his hands through his hair, looking nervous. The twins had joined him in his drinking. He knew Bill and Remus were at Grimmauld Place. Snape was at Hogwarts and Lucius Malfoy had returned home. Everyone was in place and all that was left was to wait until they got the call that Harry and Draco had been found.
“Where are we headed anyways?” Sirius asked as they started walking again. And Remus shook his head. Only his friend would ditch practice to track him down to ask a question, he could have asked later, but was to impatient to wait. Then not pay attention to where he was being dragged off too.
He felt a small bit of satisfaction when Malfoy was joined at his table by the elder Malfoy. The younger floundering for a second before getting his face blank, pretending he wasn’t freaking out.
They made sure no one saw them as they raced across the yard and stunned the Willow. Blaise looked a little worried about walking close to the tree but he followed behind them anyways.
Unfortunately, some time in the night he must have fallen asleep because he was now awake, laying in bed pressed against Malfoy. His head was again on the other’s chest and his arm was thrown over the other’s chest, only this time Malfoy was still asleep, and he had his own arm wrapped about Harry’s waist.
“Because Potter,” Malfoy said walking closer and dragging his hand along one of the threads. Unlike before this time the blonde touched them. And every touched sent a shock through Harry.
“Stop.” he demanded. Only to be hit with the urge to back away, when Malfoy’s glare met his. Something in the back of his mind told him to back down, he tried to ignore it.
He tried not to blush from embarrassment. The shoved the blonde away. He heard Malfoy laugh, but didn’t get a chance to yell at him.
Fred put the cup down on the counter and reached for the kettle, “I don’t know. Our family, Mum, Ginny,” His brother gasped, “Ron. they have been using Harry. And he trusted them.
The goblin nodded and moved back towards the box, he pulled out two smaller boxes and handed one to each twin.
“Somehow Draco placed in an expectation for telling me. Which is incredible,” the man grinned, “I wish I could have worked with him more. Brilliant student.” Lucius let himself smile.
“The headmaster asked me to show you into the main hallway. The first years will be waiting there to be sorted. I believe he wanted to sort you two first. Please follow me.”  He walked away quickly tried to understand what the hell was going on with his wolf and his mind was always going over that these two new students where a lot older than first years.
When the dinner was done, James walked besides him telling him about the castle and the tower they lived him. He laughed when he was told about a misadventure his father and Remus had on the moving stairs in their first year. It was nice, and he felt a pain in his chest when he thought about it ending, when they found their way home. The conversation felt sadder after that.
He was so caught up in his own mind he never heard the flames of the fire place change or the footsteps of the twins as they entered. The identical teens looked at each and then at their brother who was clearly worried about something. As one they moved grabbing his arms and pull him towards the couch.
The first landed proudly on his feet. While the second hit the ground hard enough to have the air knocked out of him. Remus ears picked up the grunt that followed. He quickly moved to help the young man up.
It was Grimmhook that broke the silence, “Who ever placed these is powerful.” Which cause Harry to roll his eyes, because he already had an idea who had done it. What he wanted to know why and what they did.
“Mister Hallow,” Professor McGonagall said, “If you would?” She waved her hand towards the hat, and with a small bit of dread, Harry felt Malfoy let go of his arm. Then he watched as the blonde walked up and sat on the stool.
“I think you underestimate how your housemates will see this.” Snape muttered. Harry stopped and looked at the taller student.
When his friend when to open his mouth, he elbowed him. Hoping that was a clear sign to stop. Siri glared at him and he glared right back. Then his friend looked away. He watched as Sirius pushed his food away and stomped away.
So someone commented saying the POV shifters are a little disorienting, anyone else having issues with them? I'm only doing that that way because there are small bits of information i feel are needed that can fill a chapter? Let me know. I'll try to do less of them.
He sucked in a breath and slowly opened his eyes, he pressed close to Malfoy, his arm over the other’s chest. He tried not to breath as he slowly lifted up his arm and rolled away from his rival.
“Are you sure?” the hat asked. “You could do great things in Slytherin.” The familiar words sent shivers done his spine.
He put his wand into his pocket and grabbed his bag, pulling out his potions book. There was movement next to him and he looked up to see who his partner was. He chocked on air when Snape sat down next to him.
“Why aren’t you sitting with Pettigrew?” The question came out of nowhere and he almost lost a finger when he started and looked at his lab partner.
When Lupin pulled out his wand before taking his arm, he tensed, the wolf saw it a froze, “Disillusionment.” The man muttered.
It took him awhile to figure out what he was going to do. He desperately wanted to help James. To save him from whatever happens. But Malfoy had been right. If he tried to change things, it could mean that Harry would never be born and how could he deny James his son. It broke his heart but he wouldn’t say anything. Though he still hopped to talk to Harry. Maybe if he had all the facts it would be easier. He doubted it but it gave him something to hold on it.
He looked up towards Malfoy and saw the man looked resigned. A throat cleared from the door away causing both him and the blonde to look towards Charlie, who at least looked sorry about interrupting them.
“Guys.” He groaned at the twins, who were still holding him, “I don’t want to make him come if he doesn’t want too.”
If him and Malfoy went to Hogwarts, here in the past, they would be in the same school, possibly the same houses and classes as their parents. His parents. The two people he had dreamed and imagined meeting so many times in his life, the same two people that died because of a fucked up prophecy and a power hungry madman, how could he be here, around them and not warn them of what was to come.
These letters were a pain in the ass lol. Also for some reason when I type Severus and Lucius, I kept typing them Severous and Lucious haha I think i corrected them all but let me know if I missed one.
“Are we allowed to change our minds?” He asked back, even as he pushed away the blanket and got out of the bed. He heard Malfoy mumble something but didn’t catch the words.
Bill gave them a confused look, “His a nice kid, a little reckless but brave.” The twins grinned at each other.
Harry had been silent since they entered the library. The Gryffindor had spent the first 20 minutes or so searching the rows of books for any on submissives or inheritances. He found only one, Draco had seen the frustration on the other teens face when he grabbed the single book and slunk away to the back of the library where he wouldn’t be bothered as he read it.
He had a brief thought of making up some story, but then he remembered something he had read. The goblins at Gringotts, we not allowed to tell anyone what was said or done by one of their clients. So, here was someone they could actually tell about their problem and the Goblin couldn’t say a word to anyone without their permission.
“Because Potter,” And he jumped because he hadn’t realized that Malfoy was that close, in fact the blonde was holding him. Through blurry eyes he realized him and Malfoy were sitting on the floor, the blonde behind him, arms wrapped around him and he’s back against the other’s chest. It wasn’t what he was expecting he blushed and tried to push away, but his legs had at some point turned to jelly and he fell right back into Malfoy’s arms.
Sorry for this crappy and short chapter!!! My English is not my main language and as exhaustion draws nearer, my writing always gets worse. Thanks mind! Anyways, definitely enjoyed writing this one and the way Harry is still unaware of his own sexuality :) poor Harry! But, don't worry, I have huge parts of this story already planned out and he will figure it out eventually!
"NO, I don't want to be normal you don't understand!" The boy ranted into her face. He looked disgusted with himself after he realized he'd been so contrary and with a feeling of guilt, he sprinted back up the stairs, away from the hurt expression on Mme Pompfrey's face. Luckily for him, he knew just where to go.
"Ah look who it is!" one of the tall boys said, Lucas. He wore a vile smirk and his eyes shone with amusement. "Icky Little Scarhead came to his secret spot, did'nt he just." Milicent, a rather chubby girl with black pigtails who weren't exactly neatly done. "I don't think it's so secret anymore now, Potter." laughed the third boy he did not know the name of, but, judging on the way he looked like, he was positive he only joined the pathetic club in fear of getting bullied himself. Not that Harry cared, he just knew kids with a spotted face weren't exactly accepted here.
“The course of true love never did run smooth.” Harry whispered to himself softly. He was sitting right underneath his creaky bed, reading one of his favourite quotes from Shakespeare. The orphanage did not have a lot of books, and definitely not a whole library. It was only in one of the many offices that were spread around across the whole orphanage, books lay, scattered everywhere like trash. Fantasy books, romance, adventure books, historical romans,... all those books, Harry loved so dearly much. Books were his only real escape from the world he found himself in, the awful and most boring world one would not even dare to imagine. It was the afternoon, and most of the orphanage children were playing outside with the sun glooming down on them. They were laughing and screaming and yelling stuff at each other. Fun. That’s what they called it. “Why don’t you go and have fun with the others, Potter”? they always said. But for Harry, it was nothing like fun. It was pure torture and he’d rather spend his time anywhere but here in this world. Books helped with that extremely, so he grew rather fond of them. Unfortunately, the demons in his life always seemed to come back and invade his fantasy world he was currently flying in.
Now, although, he would rather be anywhere else than to confront the probably fuming Madam Pomfrey at the beginning of the staircase. Anywhere.
"When all things are lost,and are falling along with you infinitely down the cliff of despair, all you need is a branch that sticks out, to hold onto and pull you up again. Then, it is only a matter of time to get out of the depth and wait for help. Only of course, if your stick is strong enough, big enough. Find your branch in life, let it hold you and prevent you from falling down that merciless fall, let it be. That's how I am still here, I found my branch and strong, it is." Harry has always praised his sudden thoughts that led to realization and make him a bit more intelligent. It felt good to know something that others didn't, it felt like a certain power he had. In his daily life, Harry definitely didn't had any of that. All his choices were made for him; what time he gets up, what he eats, how he dresses, what family he goes to someday, yes, all choices were made for him already and Harry felt powerless against that. It was only his mind where he had full power on, because they couldn't control his thoughts, of course. Just like they didn't had any control of his movements right now. After the rather poor interaction with Mme Pomfrey, Harry only felt like escaping. He had felt these particular thoughts multiple times, and a long time ago had here by created a special place for him to go to.  A place where he could be himself, where he had the ultimate power, his branch.
The chubby girl leant forward a little, just enough to whisper into Lucas' ear something he found rather funny and sniggered. The shock from being caught in HIS favourite spot, turned into raw anger. He was furious. This was the only place he got left to feel safe and to feel like himself, like Harry. They couldn't take that away from him, when they already had claimed somewhat the entire school. Adrenaline and anger guiding him, he gathered all the courage in him to say something in return, to make the demons go away. "Not a bit small for your great ego, Lucas? Although from the looks of the place here it would totally fit for you but the size, not so sure..." Harry held his breath, waiting to be yanked away from the tower, right into the dungeon with the rats. But, it didn't come, what happened was WAY worse. Lucas, the leader of the club, had yanked the notebook from the girl quite violently and with one swift motion he opened the book and began to scroll EACH page with his hateful brown eyes. Then, embarrassment, confusion.
“Potter!!” a loud yell echoed through the entire orphanage. It sent shivers down Harry’s spine almost directly. “Potter! Come down here at once!”
A tint of cadmium red started to appear onto the boys cheeks and the ever so green eyes came out even brighter as they widened in shock. Had Mme Pomfrey just said to act normal? He knew he was different than the rest with his wild bunch of raven black hair nested onto his head, his lightening bolt scar he had gotten from that one time a steel bucket had made contact with his forehead and ofcourse liking the idea of entering a whole new fantasy world rather than playing on a 10 by 10 stone square, thank you very much. If he really were to act normal like the other orphans, he had to give up all of his favourite worlds, characters, poems and qoutes, and in no possible way he was going to ever give that away, ever. No, he'd rather stay the odd and quirky self he was now and let the part of being normal pass him like a train.
For those who are looking for some sort of list of the characters with the anne with an e characters too, here it is!
her face turned into a small knowing smile that somehow lit up the room, even just a little bit. The knot that had formed into his stomach earlier, was slowly disappearing.
'And there went Oliver, one hand firmly grabbing the wooden bow and the other just above his eyes, to block the sun from his eyesight. His legs moved fast as he approached the battlefield of Tenelusk, a city doomed to be perished to ashes by the evil forces that now ruled the empire. Oliver was only 12 years and only a simple farm boy. His hair was a light shade of blonde and locks of hair kept falling elegantly in front of his eyes. His eyes were like sparkling crystals that could blind any enemy approaching with its vibrant shine-' Harry frowned at his unusual way of describing boys. Usually he never described boys with sparkling eyes and silk hair let alone thinking attentively about the image itself. Deciding to just continue with writing seemed like a decent plan when all of a sudden his notebook was grasped away from him, which made him notice four pair of legs standing right in front of him. 'Bullocks'
Every muscle in him tried to go down to that demanding voice at once. He really didn’t feel like making a whole scene out of nothing. The windows were closed tightly with wooden planks as barriers to keep children from escaping the gloomy building. Most of the candles were not even lit and along with the closed windows, the orphanage really did have a dark and unwelcoming look. Harry took no notice to that anymore.
Harry nodded vigorously. Although many of the staff were absolutely dreadful, in Harry's opinion, madam Pomfrey was quite alright. She was strict and cared much for rules, yes, but still cared for the orphans. The only person you were allowed to really hate was headmistress Dolores Umbridge. She's been the headmistress of the place since who knows for how long. Family heritage some say, and turned the building into a dull orphanage.
Harry shook of the trance he got into unconsciously and quickly rolled out from under his bed. A bit of dust was found on his old and baggy trousers, but no real dirt. He looked normal for an orphan.
All up above the dark roof of the dull boring orphanage was an old tower placed on top. It was once neat and clean looking, but now, it looked abandoned and old. There were several bricks missing and some gaps were that big, they could fit for a window. Over the years, the surrounding birds had claimed the tower somewhat thanks to the many holes they could fit into and gathered together during winter to warm up with the warmth a group provides. To someone who has never been into an orphanage, and never met the terrors of actually living in one, would call the place a remote hovel, inaccessible. For others, like Harry, who has been living into the darn orphanage for almost his entire life was the place a spot of heaven. All the noise of the playing children downstairs, dimmed. All the commands and complaints of the working staff, dimmed. Only the sound of his own beating heart, regular breathing and the chirping of new born birds were audible to him and it felt like music to his ears. Entering the tower with his notebook clutched to his chest tightly, Harry proceeded to sit down on his favourite spot. Over the years he had made the spot somewhat comfortable and worn out moth-bitten pillows lay scattered onto the cold brick floor. He also had a minor collection of his own books he had written over the past years with a increase in quality writing each time. He rather enjoyed writing and besides reading it was definitely on his top of best-things-to-do-in-the-orphanage list. It was February the 5th and winter was still to his displease, horribly active. Grabbing some of the pillows surrounding him, he wrapped them around him as an attempt to stay at least bearably warm. As thus, he began writing the continuation of his most recent story; Oliver the Archer. So far he really enjoyed writing the story and with every word his feather quill wrote, he started to fall even more into the story..
"Harry, I know you don't like the children very much but," she hesitated, bit her lip slightly in doubt. "can you at least try to play with them? Act..like..a normal child?"
He’s been into the orphanage for his entire life now, well since he was 6 months anyways. He’d been adopted for 5 times already but each of them didn’t last long, except for one.
The sun shining on the paper was so brilliant it hurt his eyes, but it was too beautiful of a summers day to sit in the shadows or - even worse - study in the library.
When he was in the Slytherin common room he mostly drew Pansy, Pansy by the fireplace, Pansy doing homework, Pansy reading love letters or brushing her thick ebony hair. Sometimes he also used Blaise as a model, once or twice even Vincent and Gregory (though only to try out more moving scenes and less for their innate grace or beauty). But when he was up in his bed, the curtains closed and only a lumps to lighten his paper, he sometimes drew Potter too. None of those were really good since it was all from memory and somehow this probably was for the better - if they'd been good incarcerating them in the morning would hurt more. But he liked to capture scenes he remembered about Potter that day, how he looked at a potions recipe full of concentration or how he bit into a treacle tart at breakfast. Even when his sketches never saw the light of the day Draco like having them under or next to his pillow for the night.
His pale skin was prone to getting sunburns, the wind was blowing strands of hair into his eyes every other second and the laughter of first years throwing sticks for the Squid in the lake was less heart filling and more nerve wrecking, but Draco couldn't bring himself to care when the sun was warming his face and grass was tickling his naked toes.
The lines fell easy from his quill, hastily set in fear of Pansy looking at him but steadied by inspiration. The line of the broom and Potters cape flowing in the wind, quickly drawn with no detail, just to have a line of action for his sketch. Potters body, almost filled with ink to capture the feeling of his eyes being struck by bright red, the loose line of Potters arm and his hand holding the shaft of the broom.
"I was finished anyway." And while clouds slowly moved in front of the sun Draco let go of the Parchment, letting the wind pick it up and blow it away, beyond the other students and beyond their little beach, out to the lake and the squid to never be seen by other eyes than his own.
He looked for a student desperately running after their project, but everyone he saw was sitting on a blanket either chatting or reading and no one seemed to search for or chase after parchments. While looking for the owner of the astray homework his eyes fell down at the quidditch pitch.
A completely inefficient and oh so Slytherin thing to do, but as much as Draco had to laugh about Pansys ramblings of "auburn hair" and "peachy lips", it also was the most Slytherin thing to help a friend in dire need.
“You have to go met Mister Malfoy,” Charlie said moving to stand by his younger brother. “Once you have Owen in place, we will bring them.”
“Come on.” Luke muttered, interrupting Remus’s panic. He slumped forward listening as they walked away.
He almost gasped when Evan not only relaxed in his arms but leaned into him. Moony however whimpered and urged him to hold the other closer. To protect and comfort him. He swallowed and watched as Evan looked back over his shoulder at him. He took in the other kids surprise and wondered if the brunet had been expecting someone else. Probably Luke. But then Evan nodded.
With him now awake and no longer trying to move away, Potter settled down and fell into a deeper sleep. Draco watched him, wondering what kind of nightmare Potter must have been having that had him clingy so desperately to him.
“And portals? Or perhaps information on Gringotts? Or maybe laws about underage magic?” The blonde said sneering at him.
For now that was a good thing. It meant no one was looking to blame Draco for whatever imagined slights he might have done to Potter. Lucius was felt relieved that the only a small group of people knew about Draco’s disappearance. He wasn’t sure about the Weasley twins but they seemed to care for Potter, so he imagined they would keep quiet. As for Sev he trusted the man with his life and that of his son, he knew his old friend wouldn’t tell anyone. His wife didn’t know, Narcissa would cause problems if she found out. So he let her believe that Draco was fine at school.
‘Hang the clothes up?’ Harry thought looking around the room, there wasn’t much a bed, a table, a small door that led to a bath room. No closet or anything to hang up anything on.
treated him. A few more days until Professor Dumbledore would be here to pick him up. Then he would be surrounded people that actually cared about him and wanted him around. At least until next summer.
He knew he should listen to his friend but somehow every time he went to say no, he agreed instead. He sighed again.
It didn’t make any sense, they hadn’t been here long enough to have seen him on a full moon or even after. And he knew none of his friends had told them anything. Unless Snape was spreading a rumor. But that didn’t make sense no way would he chance getting expelled and Remus was pretty sure Malfoy hadn’t figured it out.
Sirius must have felt his gaze on him, because his young godfather looked his way and gave him a wink when he saw Harry staring at him. The feeling of longing that small stupid gesture caused had him sucking in a breath and he forced himself to move his eyes along the table.
The weird sensation of having the webs touched as cause Harry to get frustrated and he was tempted to shout a Malfoy to stop but he also wanted to hear more, so he could understand just what had been done to him.
He looked across the hall towards the Slytherin table. Malfoy had sat at the next to an older student leaving room for the first years that would soon be joining them. So, he figured he would do the same.
“Nothing,” Harry said shifting his feet a little. Maybe he should have thought about what to tell Draco before he rushed over here. He hadn’t even told the blonde that he had spoken to Snape about well anything, let alone about Voldemort and Lucius.
He wanted to shout out and tell the Slytherin that he wasn’t mad at him. That the fight wasn’t the reason he was pulling away. But Draco was already gone. He kicked the closest wall, cursing when pain ran along his foot. He let out a frustrated groan and turned towards the tower, and stomped along the empty hallways. Not caring if he was caught out after curfew.
He stood up and winced as pain rushed along his spine, he took a couple small steps, testing just how much pain he was in, when he demined it minimal he took larger steps and approached the other body.
“I’ll get us supper. You can get out clothes out, organized and hung up.” Then the blonde started towards the door.
“Leave him.” He whispered, “I’m not tired,” He lied. “Plus I have a charms essay to finish,” not a lie, “he can use me as a pillow.” James gave him a questioning look but did as he was told.
“My father's cloak,” Harry whispered. “It is or will be the only thing I inherit from him. Or the only thing I knew I inherited.”
The blonde stopped only long enough to survey the rack, then nodded his approval before moving and placing the tray on the table.
He smiled as entered his bedroom. He hadn’t been gone long but when he walked into his living room, Blaise was sitting in the middle of the couch, Professor Snape to his right and Fred to the left. From the playful grin on his brother’s face he was having fun teasing the olive skinned Slytherin.
Harry wanted to thank him but the first years, excitedly worked their way up the stairs and in-between them.
“Thanks.” He said reaching up and taking the hand. The person grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet with surprising strength.
It seemed Malfoy had been busy, he had written down a few accounts of people saying they had traveled in time and had even wrote down a few basic spells that were said to manipulate time.
Draco watched him go shaking his head, of course the amusement faded as Potter refused to come out of the bathroom.
“Luc, stop.” He ordered moving towards his friend, “You have no idea what you are swearing to. This could be a trap.”
Harry just nodded and started eating his stew again. He wasn’t really hungry and it had grown cold. But he knew he should eat.
"Thank you, my boy." The headmaster said and then turned and walked away. It was only after the headmaster was far enough away that he let out a sigh and started walking towards the front of the school.
Lucius found himself in a small alley behind weasley’s Wizard Wheezes joke shop. Lupin still holding his arm, lead him around the front of the story and around the small crowds of shoppers, up the staircase and then through a door he hadn’t seen and up a smaller more narrow staircase. At the top of those stairs stood another door. This time Lupin stopped before it and looked back at him. The wolf seemed to release then that he was dragging Lucius around because his eyes widened and he let go. He turned back to the door and knocked.
The hall fell silently for a moment and then the hat shouted out Gryffindor and Remus's stomach sank. Why couldn't the guy be placed in another house. That would give him time to figure things out before he did something stupid and outed himself.
“In the past.” He said, slowly moving to seat across from his rival. Although he was freaking out over the possible time travel, he was also trying to work out what the hell was different about the blonde. Ever since he had woken up confused with the other teen over him, there was this feeling like something was off. Not to mention they hadn’t been fighting or arguing, which they had always done before.
He looked around, it felt strange to be standing here in the same spot waiting to be once again be sorted. He wondered if this time it would be different? And also wondered how different things would have been if all those years ago, he had shaken the blondes hand instead of letting Ron’s voice rattle around in his head about how cruel and hateful Slytherins where.
“That cup,” His twin said, pointing at the third cup on their small coffee table. “Has two drops of Veritaserum in it. We need you to trust us and drink it.” Charlie lifted his eyebrows surprised. Then he looked back and forth between them. He must have seen how serious they were because he walked over to the table, picked up the cup, and downed it in one long drink.
He was grateful when they apparated back to the cottage and Fred and George grabbed his arms and dragged him towards the small bar in the main living room. One of the twins, George he was almost positive, poured him a glass of firewhiskey. He thanked them and downed it.
He stayed leaning against the wall until he was sure he was alright, then finished heading back to their room.
Draco wondered if Potter thought he had done this. If he hadn’t known the Gryffindor well enough to know he would never put someone in danger, he would be thinking the same thing. Plus, no way Potter would risk, putting himself out in the open, alone with him, while the Dark Lord was after him.
His godfather tilted his head, then nodded. “Your friend started to follow you. But for some reason,” A weird flat tone crept into his voice, “He saw me chasing after you. He handed me your schedule and then walked off.”
“I don’t know.” He muttered, “But there is a town down there.” He pointed towards it and watched as Potter shuffled his feet and moved closer to him. The brunette eyed him when he got close, but didn’t say anything.
His happy moment was ruined when he saw the length of the message. It was a single small piece of parchment folding in half once.
He found the bottle of fire whiskey he opened the other night and poured each of them a glass, leaving the bottle and two empty glasses on the table. Before walking back over to the couch.
While George sat down next to him, “We have a lot to talk about.” he said, using his wand to summon to two pieces of parchment that hadn’t been sent with his brothers.
"The headmaster wouldn't have brought another wolf here, at least not without telling you first." Lilly said suddenly, and Remus wanted to hug her. Because she was right. He let out a breath and felt Sirius sling an arm over his shoulder.
For those who asked/begged for a Dumbledore chapter, I tried, I really did. And this most likely be the only one you're going to get because I had such a hard time writing it.
“For such a powerful ritual it is surprisingly simple, Draco did well. It will work.” There was a relieved sigh from most in the room.
“Evan.” He whispered. Nothing happened. He sighed again, it seemed the boy would inherited his father's sleeping skills.
He was just unshrinking the two trunks when the blonde walked through the door, a tray floating behind him.
Note: I got a comment about bad syntax and grammar, I guess this chapter was really bad? I don't know. But like I said in the notes I believe in the last chapter, pollen has been killing me and while I have a sometimes beta reader she has been busy. Meaning in new chapters all mistakes are mine. And I have no problems if you guys point out mistakes, several have done it before.
But no. His job was to meet with Lucius Malfoy and help set up a cabin that Owen owned. Sirius was responsible for making it look like the two boys had been held there for the two months they were missing. Malfoy’s job, one that Sirius didn’t envy, was going to charm and change Owen’s memories. Making the man himself believe the lie.
He stayed pressed against the wall, heart beating rapidly in his chest as he tried to understand what just happened. Two people outside of his friends, the headmaster, and Snape knew. Two people he didn’t even know and for some strange reason they didn’t seem bothered by it. Despite Luke’s comment about him eating them, which sounded to much like Sirius or James when they joked for him to think the kid actually thought he was going to eat anyone.
“You think Draco would trap us?” He friend said looking him in the eye, the anger and worry clear as can be. “You think Dragon would do anything to hurt us, his father? His godfather?” His friend growled, then tilted his head towards Blaise. “What about his best friend?”
And the fact that he was doing so now, made him a little lightheaded, And the fact that it was because of Malfoy, made him dizzy. How was it, a person who had bullied him and made him miserable seemed to have more care or manners then his own blood.
“You will see us tomorrow.” George added. Blaise gave them both a questioning look but his arm was grabbed by Snape and then they were gone.
He knew it was dumb to hide in the bathroom, because he would eventually have to go out. Not that Malfoy let him hide very long.
He had shaken Remus hand, and he hadn’t wanted to let go. He wanted to shout out that he knew him and that there was so much the man needed to know. But he bit the inside of his lip and kept his mouth closed because he knew no matter how badly he wanted to warn the man he couldn’t.
“No.” He said, sticking his hand out to help the other of the floor because no way in hell he was sitting on the floor. “I need to find a way into the restricted section. I’ll probably have better luck in there.”
“Does it matter?” He asked, pushing the last of the ginger towards Snape. The other student looked it over and nodded.
Remus almost turned to corner to look at them, because Evan had said with such conviction and confidence that he wanted to see the young mans face.
“I think we are now outnumbered by snakes.” His brother whispered, well stage whispered. He snorted and saw Snape roll his eyes.
“Mister Potter, I wish to try a spell. Is that alright?” Saomur asked, and Harry wanted to ask what kind of spell? What for? And what was going on? But it was like he couldn’t get his mouth to work. So, he just nodded.
It took all three of them to shift Evan and move him enough that James and Remus could switch places. And the second Evan’s head landed on his shoulder Moony let out a happy yip in his mind at having his cub resting against him. It was strange but Remus liked it.
“Thought that might help.” Sirius chuckled lightly, “My cousin Andromeda is a submissive, her mother side of the family, and whenever she was feeling overwhelmed or upset her mother would do this. She called it grounding. I think it releases some kind of chemical that helps submissives relax and balance out.”
“Potter,” Malfoy’s voice broke through his thoughts, and he looked up at the other boy, “If we can not seek help, what is your plan?”
Harry had to wonder what the average size of a snow leopard was, he had seen one once at a zoo and he was pretty sure it had been smaller then Malfoy.
“I’m sorry, sir, “Harry said quickly pushing his bowl away from him, “But I think you have my friend,” and was that a weird word to use about Malfoy, “Confused with someone else.” The man gave him a dark look, and turned to look at Malfoy.
“No,” Charlie replied bitterly, “the question is why mum ordered me not to ever mention it to anyone.” His brothers all looked at him in shock.
“An overdue conversation.” He muttered pulling his arms out of their hands. “Want a drink?” He asked pushing to his feet. They twins looked at each other and back at him, Charlie tried not to fidget as they studied him.
“M--Remus?” Evan asked sounding confused as he started to actually wake up. Remus gave him a smile. Evan’s eyes shot open and he jerked up, “Are you--” The smaller boy started and then slammed his mouth shut. Remus got the impression he had been about to ask if he was okay, only to remember he shouldn’t.
He sighed, “At least this way you get to meet them,” he said hoping to show Potter that there was a small bit of good out of this whole messed up situation.
“The hat almost put me in Slytherin.” He mumbled out before he thought about it. The blonde’s eyes widen and he took a few steps to Harry.
“Fucking ridiculous.” Black yelled, “I’m innocent. I should be able to be there for my Godson!” Then Black dropped down in his chair, “I lost 13 years, Remy I just want to protect him.” Lucius found himself feeling bad for the man, if he wasn’t able to protect Draco, he wasn’t sure what he would do. If Sev wasn’t as well, it was unthinkable. Though how no one knew the small fact about Black being Potter’s godfather was astonishing.
It took several minutes after the other boy was gone, for him to move from his spot. He dropped back down on the couch and pulled out some parchment and a quell.
“Sorry, coming.” Harry called after her. He put his hand against his pocket, ready to reach for his wand should he needed it, and he heard Malfoy moving behind him. It should have made him nervous having Malfoy at his back, but the truth was this town scared him more than the blonde.
A quiet tapping at his window jerked him out of his thoughts. Expecting Hedwig, he reached out to open the window, not really looking at the owl on the other side. Which left him surprised when a small brown owl flew in and landed on Hedwig's empty perch.
Shame, the other boy hadn’t gotten one, with out slow, Potter was moving, Draco was tempted to pick him up and just carry him down the damn hill.
12/05/18: This chapter has now been beta read and over 600 words added!! Thank you to the awesome help of Nik and Jenn.
“But we miss him.” His two younger brothers finished together. Charlie sighed and stopped trying to sit up.
Once it was up, he started pulling out clothes and hanging them up. He placed all Malfoy’s on one end and his on the other. Most of the pants also went on hangers, two pairs folded over to save on space. He then folded his sleep pants and planced them on one shelf and Malfoy’s on another. He tried not to blush when he added both of their boxers to the same shelves. Then he placed the wrist holsters on the top shelf and the boots on the last.
He had horrible nightmares that night of Voldermort killing Draco, he woke the next morning already planning ways to keep his mate as far away from the final battle. He couldn’t, wouldn’t lost Draco. So far, his best plan was Lucius Malfoy. While Harry had no real love for the man, he knew Draco’s father loved his son and would do anything to protect him. He just hoped that meant Lucius would be willing to force his son away from his mate and the fight if the need ever came.
Fred looked back at the goblin and was about to tell him to leave the wills for Harry, but the goblin held up his hand.
“What kind of prank?” A different voice asked. Causing him to look up behind him as James, Sirius and Remus joined him at the table.
“Somewhere safe, for us to research a way home.” He muttered dropping down on one of the couches, he took in the rest of the room. There was a small bathroom off to the right and a few more shelves along the remain walls filled with everything from caldrons to quills.
It wasn’t like the quick kiss before, hell it wasn’t like any kiss before. It was powerful, passionate, and overwhelming. He didn’t understand why he whimpered and loosened his arms around Draco, but when his mate pushed him backwards against the wall he didn’t care.
It also seemed to help Harry’s head clear. He blushed, “Sorry,” he muttered without looking at anyone.
“This one is as well.” Then to a third and fourth, “These two are connected to you core, your power.” Harry shivered, not entirely from the touch, but from the information, was the binding damaging his magic? Was it why he sometimes still had problems with accidental magic, while the other’s his age had out grown them.
“Isn’t that…” He heard one of them mutter behind him and always stopped to see what was going got be asked but he told himself he didn't want to know and kept moving. Keeping his ears open to make sure the two followed behind him.
The reason why he left a few months ago, was the unfortunate death of Mr Winstons. Heart attack while chopping wood. Harry was a witness and as Mrs Winstons accused Harry of his death, he got thrown out, back into the orphanage. That was the first time Harry was actually pleased to go back to the orphanage and mostly to just spend his day reading underneath his bed or in the cold stone tower, where the birds gathered together to eat the left overs of the orphanage. Yes, Harry was even happy to go back to the orphanage a few months ago.
He was resting, not hiding, in his guest quarters when someone knocked on the door. He groaned. There were only two maybe three people that would seek him out, Draco was in class and no doubt the werewolf was in his own rooms, that left Severus.
“Maybe a little less.” James added. He look down at his friend and sighed. James eyes were red and he could smell the exhaustion on him. He loved his best friend but he was a bit of a mother hen. He reached down and ruffled James’s hair, earning him annoyed huff.
“Because you idiot, all I know is how my own instincts react to you and how I’m suppose to treat you.”
It showed just how thrown the other teen was, that he didn’t hesitate just picked up his stuff and followed Harry.
He gasped and reached for the tooth, without thinking about it. When his skin made contact there was a hum and another spark hit him, and this time a wave of magic left him and the tooth it rippled across the room, tossing the goblin backwards.
Harry’s skin felt too tight like it had been stretched thin in order to find over his body and it made him feel more frustrated then he already had been. Which meant he shrugged Draco off, a little rougher then he had meant, the second they entered the school. He saw the hurt look in the blonde’s face and had been about to apologize when Draco turn his back to him and stormed off.
“Fred,” He looked up at Charlie, not realizing he has been staring down at the counter top, “Bill is good. He wouldn’t betray anyone. I promise.” Fred looked up and tried to give his brother a smile, it was weak at best. He just didn’t have it in him. Charlie sighed and walked out of the kitchen.
Harry had wanted to agree with her but figured the teachers would have caught on by now if he had been cheating. And now, having Malfoy point out things he missed, important things, he was sure that Malfoy was more intelligent then he had thought.
He looked at his brother, who just shrugged and followed after the goblin. He sighed and caught up to his brother, “If we die, it’s all your fault.” His brother chuckled.
Fred as only slightly annoyed at Malfoy’s timing, he tried not to frown as he opened the door. Though he shouldn’t have worried because he gasped in surprise to see not only Malfoy standing there but Remus.
“So, “ Fred said, walking over to Blaise, “How do you feel about sneaking around Hogwarts with us?” He grinned over at his new friend, who blushed a little before grinning back, “sounds fun.” There was a groan which caused Fred and George to look over at their old Potions Professor. The man didn’t say anything just glared at the three of them.
“He knows where Harry is.” The wolf said. Lucius wanted to roll his eyes, that was not a smartest way to start this conversation. Black growled, apparently getting the wrong idea.
He really liked the shirt, but he found himself unsure about the fit. It felt like it fit to him, but he hadn’t ever owned a nice dress shirt before and he didn’t know if there was anything special he needed to know about the way to wear it.
Charlie gestured to the sitting area and his brothers all sat down. Before he joined them he refilled his glass and handed Bill and Percy each one. Percy gave it a strange look and looked up at Charlie questioningly.
He opened his mouth but slammed it back down. They hadn’t gotten their timetables yet. So, he didn’t even know what classes he had and when. He sighed.
And while this summer had been uneventful, there was this nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach that something was coming. Something bad. Of course, with Voldemort out there, the feeling didn’t come as much of a surprise him. It was the sense that whatever it was that was coming had little or nothing to do with Voldemort that worried him. His nightmares seemed to center more on the unknown and less on the madman, leaving him with a foreboding feeling.
“Is that why you seem so worried?” He asked, “You’re worried the hat will place you in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor?” The sound of lots of feet walking towards them caught both of their attention as they turned to face the sound.
“But we also don’t know any names that would be safe to use, with out someone knowing someone who could be related to which ever we choose.” Harry added.
“Alright.” The goblin said, getting up, “Excuse me for a moment.” Then he turned and walked away, leaving them alone in the room.
Remus was listening to James and Sirius debate about using a spell to change the hair color of all the girls in their house. Sirius thought it would be brilliant, but James didn’t want Lilly mad at him. He groaned at his two best friends already dreading the detention they were sure to get afterwards.
Harry pulled back enough to look at Draco wanting to make sure he meant it. What he didn’t expect was Draco to gasp and grab his chin, holding Harry’s head in place. Harry leaned into the touch liking the warm feeling that bloomed in his chest at the touch. Then Draco was kissing him.
The blonde looked offended that someone could have done this. It was that look, the look of disgust on Malfoy’s face that caused the impact of it all to hit him. Because right in front of him was a Slytherin, a student whose father followed Voldemort, someone who was cruel and a bully, and that someone was disgusted with what was done to him. How horrible would something have to be to offend a Malfoy?
I know in the books there is a Goblin Names Griphook. Mine is a made up on with a similar name, this is intentional.
“As for the backstabbing traitors you will only have to pretend to be their friend long enough to end it. Me and Blaise are much better for you.” Harry chuckled. “As for the Dark Lord, I’ll be by your side.” The words were meant as an encouragement but Harry's stomach dropped. The thought of having Draco dying at his side scared the hell out of him. He couldn’t admit that to the proud blonde because Draco would just tell him off for being stupid and try to reassure him that everything would be okay.
“We can’t know that.” He whispered. He felt his friend scoff at him, but he didn’t pull away from the hug.
“Dumbledore, warned us. Beforehand. That messing with time could be dangerous and that interacting with ourselves or others, could have really bad consequence.”
“I’m Sirius.” He watched as his friend stuck his hand out all smiling and playful. To his credit the new kid didn’t seem fazed just shock Siri’s hand and gave his name. “Evan.”
Instead, he just started moving, walking closely behind the other, in case he fell. Heaven only know how much slower they would be moving, if he fell and hurt himself worse.
George cursed and eyed the bird. His eyes sparking with mischief and Fred knew that second, his twin was debating what would happen if he gave one to the bird.
He wanted to be angry that again the blonde had thought of practical things that had never crossed his mind, but at this point he was to hungry and tired to really waste the energy. So, he pulled the metal rack and unshrunk it. To his surprise it came with hangers along the long thin bar and had on side that held for small shelves.
Malfoy didn’t miss his hesitation because the blonde bumped into him, shoving him towards both the goblin and the portkey. He sighed tightening one hand around his wand and sticking his other out to grab the paper. He saw Malfoy do the same.
Remus shifted his feet, he would much rather go off and see what his two idiotic friends where doing but knew that he couldn't say no to the headmaster.
The next morning they sat at home, the black box on top of their work table, while they sat on their couch with a bottle of fire whiskey.
Remus left them at the same stairs he had first walked up with Ron on his very first day at Hogwarts. The stairs where empty, meaning hopefully that they had arrived before the first years.
“We are meeting our parents.” Harry said, “They wanted to see us after what happened last week.” Using the information, the woman had given them. Tom sighed and nodded.
He watched as his father looked over his shoulder at Sirius. They two held a silent conversation harry didn't’ understand before James jumped to his feet rushed towards him. Harry tired to hold it back. He told himself to wait it out, wait until he was alone and in his bed with curtains closed but the second his father wrapped his arms around him he broke.
He snarled and threw his glass at the wall. He didn’t believe his son would go after The Boy Who Lived. Not only because it was illogical but because Lucius was positive his idiot son was half in love with the hero. He also knew his son wouldn’t betray him. Or at least he had been sure, but his own mind was starting to doubt it. Because it didn’t make sense that if Draco was in trouble he couldn't reach out. To him or to his godfather. He sighed.
He rushed after his friend and when he was close enough he wrapped a hand around Siri’s arm and using his extra strength pulled his friend to a stop.
After that he let the conversations around him fade into the back ground as he ate. He wondered what happened to Sirius’s brother. He knew he had to have died, otherwise his godfather would have been challenged as head of the Black family. He wondered if we he made it home, if he should talk to him about it.
He grabbed his coat and pulled it on. Shoving the letter into one of his pockets, he used his wand to cast a notice me not spell, taught to him by his mother, over himself and snuck out.
Sev’s mouth opened and then slammed shut. The other man took a deep breath,  “I do not know. But at least I would have understood.”
“Three more days,” he mumbled. He knew it was only a handful of days, but it felt longer. Maybe it was the loneliness that made it feel like the days just dragged on and on. He told himself to focus on the positive; Hogwarts, his friends, Remus, and the Weasley’s. It took some effort, but he slowly started to feel better and a little excited about the end of summer.
“Fred, George, where--” There was a knock at the door before it opened and Bill walked in. Charlie watched as his older brother took the three of them in, him sprawled out on the couch blushing, and the twins standing in front grinning.
The goblin nodded, not seeming bothered by their twin speak. “I had assumed that young Mister Potter would have read them years ago. Or perhaps his guardian. It is most strange that they have not.”
Another mumbled, reply had him grabbing his wand. With a wave and muttered spell, the door flew open.
He was right in his guess, because when he entered the common room. Remus was laying across on one of the couches, reading. He was surprised to see that Lilly was sitting on the floor below him, writing away on a piece of parchment. Both stopped when he entered the room. His mother gave him a smile and went back to her work, but Remus’s kept his eyes on him. Harry felt his heart beat a little faster, a small part of him feeling like prey under the gaze. He forced a smile and hurried out of the common room. Trying to figure out why Remus was looking at him like that.
“Harry,” Draco said softly against his ear. “We have to finish talking to my fathers and then we can go to bed,” Harry whined, “together,” his mate added.
He hadn’t meant to notice the new kids scent changing. But he had been curious enough when instead of setting next to Peter he found an empty table behind him and Sirius, that he kept part of his attention on the other kid.
“Why?” Charlie asked, moving past them to drop down on their couch. Their brother looked much like they had when they found out. Full of disbelief, hurt, and anger.
“The hell?” he muttered. He had never heard of a goblin demanding a wizards presence and doing so while telling him to keep it a secret? That was strange.
“Well we have been here for a couple days; do you think that’s how long its been in the future?” Draco raised his brow. He hasn’t really thought about it much. All he really cared about was getting home, not how long it would take.
Draco stood still and watched how Potter winced and cringed as he walked. It seemed the other boy, was in a lot of pain, more so then him. He would bet it was because of his inheritance.
When he was close the blonde, gently ran his hands along Harry’s shoulders, smoothing down the shirt, then he stood back and Harry could feel the blonde’s eyes on him as he looked over him.  It felt weird having Malfoy’s full attention on him, it was different then their normal interaction. Still intense but less hostile.
Then Harry watched as Malfoy took a handle full of the powered and threw it, “The Leaky Cauldron.” With green flames, the blonde was gone.
When he was back to facing the women, she seemed content that he was whole, and moved towards Malfoy. Not wanting the suspicious Slytherin to hex her, Harry moved into her way, “No spliching. Really, we are okay, just a little lost.”
As he walked out of the room Lucius ears caught him muttering about pushy werewolves, manipulative old men, and hating cooking. He tried not to find it amusing but failed. It seemed Black reminded him a bit of Severus which given the animosity between the two shouldn’t have amused him, or perhaps that’s why it did.
“Well, I’m Remus.” He said sticking his hand out to Harry, “The headmaster asked me to show you into the main hallway. The first years will be waiting there to be sorted. I believe he wanted to sort you two first. Please follow me.”
His brother nudged him, and he looked down at the letter. They both touched it and it gave a soft glow, then unwrapped itself. They looked at each other and let out a relieved breath.
“What’s wrong?” He asked, his voice quieter then he wanted. That same voice in the back of his head warning him, not to challenge the angry dominant in front of him. He swallowed not sure how he felt about it all.
“In second year, he found a black quartz out along the end of the forest. It took us months but we charmed it into a bracelet. He normally wears it everywhere. But I saw it in the dorm a couple days. Would it work?” He asked both Professors.
Then suddenly Harry was surrounded in red lines, or webs. He wasn’t sure but they reached out from his body towards the Goblin and they were entertained and in a few places knotted.
Harry’s feet stopped moving, “What?” That didn’t make since, Voldemort had been laying low since the fight at the ministry. Harry hadn’t heard anything about him attacking anyone.
He froze because despite Malfoy condescending tone, those were good questions and he hadn’t thought about any of them. He has been caught up thinking about his friends and only focused on time travel because it took less effort.
He stayed as far away from Snape as he could during the remainder of class and then bolted the second, he could.
His mind raced as he tried to figure out why Dumbledore would do this, because there was no doubt that his headmaster had done it. He was the only with access to him and the power to do it. But why? Harry was already on his side, with Voldemort killing his parents. He had already resigned himself that this war would come down to him and Voldemort, so what game was the headmaster playing.
Harry sighed, because of course it couldn’t be something simple that could just be answered when he wanted.
“And not only did they do it, they made me their silent partner, they send me free samples all the time, and always ask how i’m doing.” He took a breath, “I think they care and that they are my friends.” He looked away, because if he was wrong, they would be stuck here.
“There were stories, during the first war that the Dark Lord knew of a very dark spell that would grant him immortality. I never truly believed it. I thought it was a ploy, a way to get more people to follow him. But it seems I was mistaken.” The man met Harry’s eyes, “When I slipped this into Miss Weasley’s bag in your second year, I knew not what it was. Only that it held dark magic and that it would hopefully get Arthur Weasley in trouble. When rumors started about the chamber I believed it a coincidence, until you handed gave it back to me.”
“Well, the freaking portal thing for one. But the fact that no one has recognized either of us. I mean your Draco Malfoy and….” He took an annoyed breath, “And I’m the boy who lived. Either one of us, should draw attention. The two of us together.” He stopped talking. Not really needing to finish that sentence.
“Me too.” Bill said. They looked at him as he pulled up his sleeves to show, brilliant red and orange scales.
When he was shown into the common room, he asked where his bed was. Stating that he was exhausted and wanted to sleep.
Though all his amusement faded as him and Draco stood dressed, wands and school bags in hand at the Hospital entrance looking at each other. Neither were happy as it was time for them to go their separate ways. Every instinct in Harry screamed at him to stay close to his mate.
This time when they exited the shop, he didn’t assume they were done, he just stopped and looked at Malfoy.
He sighed and strolled down another row of books. So far he found nothing useful. There was a book on time turners, the same as at Flourish & Blotts. Two books on the theory of time travel, he wasn’t sure of their usefulness but took them just in case.
Now while Potter’s mind was stuck on what was going on with him, Draco was focused on trying to find a way home.  He understood why the other boy was sidetracked but he also knew he couldn’t allow himself to be. If he did they could wind up stuck here, and Draco had no intentions of living through his parent's misery and mistakes.
What made Owen perfect for Remus and Draco’s plan was the man’s clear hatred for The Boy Who Lived as well as Dark Wizards. Harry had shivered when he read the man’s interview from last year. He blamed Harry for not killing the Dark Lord correctly when he was supposed to, and even stated he was only back because Harry had failed again at stopping him. He was the ideal, as someone who would want to kidnap both Harry and Draco.
It had taken him 4 days to work up the courage to owl his brothers. Now he sat in his small house in Romania waiting for them to arrive.
When he was turned to face Malfoy, he saw the other teen had pulled out his wand, Harry shook his head, telling him no.
This got a snort from Malfoy, “I’ve know Blaise since he was a child, he does not need to be corrupted by the twins, he seeks trouble enough on his own.”
“If you think, Potter, then I’m wearing the same clothes for more then a day. You are mistaken.” Then he was pulled into a store that he hadn’t been in before. It was nice, too nice. Harry was sure the clothes he could see we worth more than his entire wardrobe. He sighed.
“We can not go today,” Severus said, pulling all of their attention to the man. “Dumbledore would be suspicious, I’m sure he is already wondering where you are,” he looked at Harry, “and it might be better to search after we investigate Black’s library, it might give us a better understanding of what we are looking for.” The potion master pulled out his wand and pointed it at the book. It flew into the air and then disappeared with a pop.
He fought against a forgotten instinct to lower his head to his friend. It wasn’t something he did anymore.
Breakfast was quiet, neither of them speaking as they looked over their parchments and ate. When Malfoy was done, he got up and grabbed his coat. Harry, having gotten used to it, just grabbed his own coat and followed him out of their room.
The dim sunlight that hardly shone through the window made the face of Madam Pomfrey look even more demanding as she stood there with her arms crossed, one feet tapping continuously on the wooden floor of the hallway. Harry gulped at the sight of her stern face. "Potter can you tell me why on earth you are not playing outside with the other kids? You'll get some sort of sickness one day from always staying indoors."
''Harry!'' He jumped slightly when Amy slapped his shoulder. ''Be nice! Go!'' She said and pushed him up.
Harry shook his head and mumbled ''sorry'' under his nose. ''What is it?'' He asked and Malfoy eyes went wide.
Harry a little surprised sipped his tea and started explaining everything. ''Well as you can tell... I got a lot more fame after the war than I did before.'' Draco snored. ''But I didn't like it.'' Draco looked up and met Harry's eyes. ''I never liked it you know? This whole 'The-Chosen-One' thing. I actually hated it.'' Draco now was looking paler than usual. ''So I got a place here, because no one knows me here and to be honest, I love that. Well... I loved that.''
Like he would care. Harry thought. What was he doing anyway, but he couldn't lie it was surprisingly nice seeing him.
''What?'' Harry asked oblivious. ''Oh! Ginny, right. Well, we decided to spilt up because I didn't really love her that way, she was more like a sister to me.''
''Are you actually suggesting that I stay at your place?'' Draco asked curiously still not believing his ears.
''Nothing!'' Draco started crying again. ''It’s me who’s supposed to be sorry. I was such a prat to you, I thought you were an awful person, I was jealous of you. I was jealous about everyone else that were friends with you, Harry... I am so sorry. For everything. I truly am.''
Harry took whistling kettle and flooded the tea. He grabbed the mugs and slide one of them to Draco who mumbled something like 'thanks'.
With that both man sat at the couch looking in watch other's eyes when they finally both fell asleep.
''Malfoy, what do you want?'' Harry said angrily. He was with his friends tonight, it was that one night that he got to meet them but NO. Draco Fucking Malfoy had to show up.
''I know. But just so you know, I don't mind your company at all. Besides you've changed.'' Harry said and blushed a little.
''Draco... I know we didn't exactly... like each other.'' Draco smiled at that. ''And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not accepting your hand, I'm sorry for saying all those horrible things to you. Sorry for beating you up a few times, I'm sorry that I stalked you in the sixth year...'' Draco's eyes opened wide and he began to sob even more. ''I'm sorry for using 'Sectumsempra' on you... I'm so-''
''Well I don't know if they would want a stranger in their house, you know?'' He didn't give Malfoy a chance to reply. ''But you could sleep at my flat, I have a extra bedroom so-''
''Yeeez...'' Connor mumbled. ''Wait here, I'll pack you up.'' with that he slammed the door shout in front of Draco's face.
''I'm an adult Potter, I can take care of myself. You know?'' Draco asked teasingly and stood up. ''I will be going then.''
''Nothing.'' Harry responded. He reminded himself that his friends were waiting for him inside the pub and they're probably are half way through the drinks. He groaned loudly and looked at the night sky.
''You don't know who Amy is-of course. She's one of my muggle friends. The one you met at the pub.'' Harry said questiongly.
Draco snored but then looked at Harry's concerned face. ''Harry.'' He looked up. ''I will be okay.'' But Harry didn't look convinced. ''How about... If I don't return 'till 2pm you will come after me? ''
''What the fuck do you want?!'' he yelled and Draco stepped away. ''Now?! Now you're coming here, huh? The fuck you want?! This isn't your house anymore!''
''Well, when I moved here... I moved in with Ginny. And now I'm alone so It's pretty boring. But hey! Now you're here!'' He said the last part with a little much enthusiasm.
His head flied straight and he looked over the others man's eyes and he clearly lost himself in them. They were so beautiful... grey... violet... mercury. He snapped his thoughts away when he reminded himself they were Malfoy's eyes!
''He cheated on me for the whole two fucking years!'' Draco shouted and started crying again. ''This whole time...''
''Yeah, yeah. Ok.'' Malfoy Inhaled deeply and now more confidently said. ''Fuck it. Do you know someone who could sleep me over tonight?'' Malfoy said and his eyes meet Harry's.
''Well today...'' Draco started and Potter looked at him. ''My boyfriend and I broke up.'' Potter's eyes went wide at the word boyfriend, Draco smirked. ''And well, he kicked me out.''
''Uh, two years now i guess.'' Draco looked at his feet and felt tears coming out of his eyes. He started crying loudly. ''I-I'm so-sorry..'' he chocked out.
His mother on the other side was an absolute angel. She would do anything for his son. Draco loved her with his entire heart. It was hard for him to leave her, but a part of him was glad about the decision he has made.
''I'm fine'' Malfoy said through this tears. After a while he wiped his eyes and looked at Harry who was staring at him. ''Don't stare at me.'' He said.
''Are you fucking deaf?! I said! I. Want. My. FUCKING CLOTHES BACK!'' he shouted making Connor flinch.
''Well yes- I mean-no, we were but we broke up not long after the war.'' Potter sipped his coffee and went to sit at the couch. Draco picked up his mug and stood in front of him.
''Wait! You would actually let me stay at your flat?'' He said loudly like he couldn't believe what just happened.
After a year going through an actual hell he met Connor. Connor was a tall slim guy. His hair was brown and shiny, what Draco noticed, he was a typical American guy. They were friends for a couple moths but then they decided to date. Pansy warned him a few times. She didn't like him, but Draco did and he didn't know if it was because of who he was, or maybe because he was great in bed. After four months of happy relationship they moved in together into a small apartment somewhere in California. Draco was no longer having mental issues. It wasn't true, he was still sick but he has been to happy to even think about that. His relationship was amazing and Draco began to fall in love with the man, but something didn't feel right. Sometimes Connor would get home at night drunk as hell and yell at Draco for literally nothing. Once he even hit him, next morning he was beginning Draco to forgive him. As you can presume he did forgive Connor. This event didn't change anything, Connor still was yelling at him, no long after that they would made up. Once Connor came back home with a hickey on his neck and they would argue about it, Draco was ready to leave but then Connor told him that he loved him. So he stayed.
''Fine. I'll tell you.'' He looked over the couch and Potter gestued him to sit on it. They sat there a couple minutes both of them not daring to speek.
He still attended to a psychologist, she was muggle though. So he couldn't tell her everything. No long after, he was diagnosed with depression and a PDSD. At that time Draco has cried a lot, Pansy would visit him almost everyday. He cried at her shoulder and told her everything that was brooding his mind. But it wasn't something he didn't expect.
All of his friends turned away from him because of the choices he's made in the past, except from one person. Pansy Parkinson. She was his best friend since he remember, she was always supportive even when he told her he was gay in the sixth year, that is why he loved her, he loved her so much. She helped him a lot. Helped his to get a new place, to get over his relatives' death and comforted him anytime. She was the best friend anyone would have.
Now he was here. Laying awake in Harry Potter's bed. He was also wearing his clothes, he still couldn't believe that this actually happened. Draco spent most of the night thinking about his life. Questioning himself what to do.
''I don't know really... I don't know...'' Potter said and mumbled the last part. After a few seconds of silence he got up and said. ''Okay so...'' he took a few steps and opened the door to a small bedroom. ''You can sleep in here.'' They walked inside it. ''The bathroom is there'' he said pointing his finger somewhere at the hallway.
Harry looked at him with a pity in his eyes. ''I just want you to forgive me...Nothing else I-'' Draco was cut off with Harry's hug.
''I forgave you long ago Draco. Your mom, she saved my life.'' Harry pulled away to look at Draco's eyes. ''And you... Without you...I wouldn't kill him.''
''Quite good as well...'' Malfoy said and looked over Harry's friends who's eyes went wide and jaws were open to a perfect 'o'.
They've been in this kind of relationship for a long time, Pansy would often call him and they sometimes would meet somewhere at the beach or at the cafe, that Pansy loved. He told her everything. Even one night Pansy was ready to hex Connor out of his mind but Draco has managed to stop her.
''Okay, I'll be in my bedroom if you need anything.'' Harry was now walking away but he stopped and turned around. ''Good night, Malfoy.'' he said and smiled.
''The war?'' Draco asked and Harry nodded. He leaned on his hand and looked at Harry with a weird expression. ''Well starting of... I didn't have any friends, except for Pansy of course. I have got a place in America.'' at that Harry's eyebrows lifted. ''Then not long after that I meat my boy-ex-boyfriend. We moved in together and yeah...''
''Well no-I mean yes.'' Harry  scratched his head. When Draco gave his confused look he said. ''I was 'seeing' couple of blokes and girls, but well.'' He coughed.
''And why would I know something like that? Malfoy I don't know if you remember but we hate each other.'' Harry said and Malfoy shrugged.
''Thanks.'' Draco murmured as he held the mug. ''Well, I might be staying at Pansy' but she's not home yet. So I guess I will get some hotel room or something.''
''Okay Malfoy...'' he whisper-shouted. ''It don't know what you are playing at! But I am having fun with my friends tonight. And I don't want you to ruing it so-!'' He cut himself of when he saw Malfoy was beginning to cry.
Next day Amy called him and asked him if he was down for a pub night with couple of her friends. He said yes straight away, he wasn't in any pub for a long time besides he had nothing better to do.
''No Harry!'' Harry jumped at the unexpected change in tone. ''You!''  He pointed his finger at Harry's chest and looked at his emerald eyes. ''Have absolutely nothing to be sorry about.''
Draco haven't returned back to the Malfoy Manor, he was to afraid. To afraid of the memories that were spooking him ever since he got the Dark Mark.
''What happened?'' he asked and after a few seconds of staring he realized what he has said. ''Oh god! So-sorry! I mean, you don't have to tell me It's just-''
''What the fuck Malfoy?!'' He exclaimed loudly, anger filling his body. '' You fucking show up here, after four fucking years and you're asking me do I know someone to sleep you over?!''
Not long after the war she and Ron had gone to Australia to try bringing back her parents' memory. It worked and now they could remember her again. Harry was surprised at first, he couldn't believe it but then he remembered that Hermione is 'the greatest witch of her age'. When they came back everything changed. They got a place together somewhere in wizard Australia. They were visiting him almost every week, that was the only thing that was making him happy.
When he finally asked Hermione, she to his surprise said that it would be great and that she is happy for him.
Draco chuckled. ''Actually, I think I will appariate to my place today.'' Harry looked at him with shocked expression. ''Potter, I need to get my things.''
''Mmmm...'' The thing beside him mumbled. Harry sat straight away and realized that the 'very warm thing' was Draco.
''Do you want tea or coffee?'' Potter asked and turned around to face Draco. ''You can sit, you know?''
''Alright, alright! You are choking me.'' Amy managed to say, Harry pulled away and realized that it was true he nearly choked her.
''I mean you don't need to come with me.'' said Harry. ''But I don't think you have anything else so...''
Potter stood up and grabbed Draco's arm. ''Hey! Are you alright?'' He asked worriedly and sat Draco down on the couch. Not long after that Draco begin sobbing.
''It's alright.'' Potter looked down and up until he met Draco's eyes and asked. ''Did you sleep well?''
''Here. Let me help you.'' The blonde said as he helped Brad to get up. He looked over to Harry and smirked.
''You-your welcome. I mean of course.'' With that he waved his hand and placed some clothes on the bed.
''Okay... Now could you please tell me what is going on?'' Draco snapped out of his daydream and looked over to Potter who had a confused face expression. He took of his jacked and placed it on top of Potter's.
''Well...'' Malfoy's hand went up to his hair, Harry thought it might be some kind of nerve tick so he tried to calm himself down.
''So you were living with him?'' Potter didn't seem to care about the word he anymore and Draco was thankful about it, he didn't want to argue with him right now.
''Harry! Nice to see you!'' It was Brad one of Amy's friends. He didn't quite like him, he was too... It wasn't even a second when he tripped and feel to the ground —clumsy.
