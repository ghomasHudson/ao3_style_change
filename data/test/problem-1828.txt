Regrettably, before Harry got the chance to discuss his theory with Draco or Emily, he got called into work. Missing persons usually were not his metier. They had a department of Aurors especially educated to deal with those. But somehow, Kingsley had demanded him and Neville to join the investigation. When they entered the meeting room the team had been assigned, they both stopped dead the moment they recognised the latest victim: Madam Irma Pince.
Surprised that the witch was speaking so openly of her financial situation - usually, such matters were not addressed outside of the family - the blond pondered, "I still cannot see Lord Greengrass being all that happy with you for giving up what had come along with the Rosier name."
"Even at the risk of his own safety."
Responding in kind, gently caressing the pureblood's cheek, she chuckled, "Garrick is driving me up the wall. He constantly tries to suggest patterns, despite knowing that wood chooses its carving."
"I forgot about that …" Ron admitted quietly.
"Excuse me?" The Auror replied confused.
Chuckling, Neville shook his head. "And would you like the bow around her neck to be green or blue?"
He whipped around, when he heard a weak voice whimper, "Make the mean blond stop, Hermione, … hurts …!"
While the man had looked around, the witch had caressed a baby that lay sleeping in a crib beside them, while smiling down at the three young people before her. Her eyes had become impossibly tender when they had fallen on the mirror-image of her husband. Harry had never imagined hearing his name spoken with such overwhelming love - most memories of his mother were of her screaming and sobbing, begging for his life - as she had spoken softly, "Harry."
--O-O--
--O-O--
“Has he had breakfast yet?” Draco demanded to know.
Never before had anybody present seen binding magic at work. It appeared to gather around Kreacher, pressing into him from all sides. It did not feel painful, but every witch and wizard in the room felt the potential for it to become exactly that. No wonder elves preferred to punish themselves if this was the alternative. Kreacher squirmed for several minutes, fighting against the overwhelming force until he vanished with an audible 'pop'.
Shrugging, the blond replied, "Because I remember how it was with Him. Father deserves punishment, for he has tried to attack you, even taken your wand. Voldemort would have killed him for far less. This… this is nothing."
"Be my guest," Harry invited and watched with hawk's eyes as his colleague started casting.
Instantly assuming a defensive position, Alexander pulled his aunt between them and Neville clutched an amulet he carried hidden beneath his robes. Spotting his friend's gesture, Harry smirked and hissed in parseltongue. Immediately a protective shield flared up.
"They would never hurt you, Sir … Severus. It's not only Emilia and Draco and me who look out for you … who are concerned about your wellbeing, the house is too."
Scratching his head, Harry grinned sheepishly, "Not particularly well."
Shaking his head, Harry took a sip of the tea Draco had just served him. “Don’t take this the wrong way, Lucius, but can you imagine what would happen if word got around that I have left you alone in Malfoy Manor with all the dark artefacts still around?”
"Harry, may I sit?"
"You are a smart girl, and you are a
"How do I do that?"
century, be it kicking and screaming. Muggles are dangerous, their technology and weapons develop faster than their understanding of human behaviour. Just because our war happened after World War II does not mean that we can ignore the horrors of the genocide committed. After all, Tom was not that different from Hitler."
Barely able to suppress a shiver, the man kissed the back of her head before pulling her close. "I am sorry, my love. So very sorry."
Rolling his eyes at the prideful pureblood, Harry stepped in front of the prisoner, folded his arms in front of his chest and took his time to glare at him. Maybe he was taking a little too much pleasure in bringing this man down. But then, the last time they had talked, Lucius Malfoy had threatened him by calling his Lord to kill him. So, with more vindictiveness than was usual for him, Harry loomed and informed him silkily, “Oh, you will bow to me. You will go where I tell you; sleep when I permit you; eat what I provide, and not a single syllable that was not approved by me will come out of your mouth.”
Looking back at the kneeling pureblood, the liege flickered his wand, releasing the bonds. Though he was not touching Draco any longer, the blond still stood beside him. A part of the young Auror was repulsed by the perverse pleasure he felt that Draco Malfoy had apparently chosen him over his father. However, now was not the time to delve too deep into that matter. "You have your orders, Lucius. Kreacher will give you money. The address of the shop is on the paper. Now leave, I expect you back with the collar and the leash tomorrow at ten a.m. sharp. Don't dare to be late!"

"Potter's sleeping."
"This has to be your first Christmas," Hermione had breathed out.
"As can be expected, considering the circumstances," Emilia shared while serving herself a cup of tea. "He slept about thirteen hours so far; suffered from nightmares. His mind is still not up to par, to deal with the situation. Our young Mr Malfoy came up with a spreadsheet of topics best to avoid."
"And …?"
"Hermione has read every book on the market about coma patients Flourish and Blotts provides, and a few muggle ones as well. Basically, they all say the same," the redhead shared. "As long as he does not want to get better, he won't."
--O-O--
"Hungry and in desperate need of being groomed, I would say. And she's not the only one!"
"Nope," Harry shook his head, instinctively reaching for his wand when Nott pulled out his own, waving it over Draco, who suddenly stood in but his pants in the middle of the living-room.
Looking down at the rude account manager, Severus gave his very best 'stern Potion Master' impression. Griphook seemed unfazed. So, the wizard merely nodded after a few moments and invited, "Lead the way."
When all three younger Aurors finally stood side by side at the table, Neville shrugged. "Still, doesn't make any sense," before stealing Charles' last biscuit.
Surprised, his best friend interrupted their conversation, "You won't go to work tomorrow?"
An angry glint lit up Snape's eyes, "I
With an inward grin, Hermione shrugged. "Do you want a bite?"
"Thank you. I had a very good teacher."
"I'll be in the lab for another hour," Draco revealed once his parents were gone.
"He will return home," Luna supplied, not even looking up from her editing. "For Kreacher and for you."
"Antonin, I'm surprised to see you here." Lucius overly polite voice broke through Draco's rising terror. Yet, instead of being released, cold fingers brushed over his cheek in a mock of a lover's caress.
"Minerva showed me pictures."
"I can't believe we had the antidote all along," Draco mumbled, ignoring the question.
"Aunt Walburga preferred to live in London, but there is a nice cottage near Eastbourne. And another one on the Isle of Skye, because Uncle Orion always said that the key to a good marriage was the chance of living apart if one so chose. Also, he was not a great fan of the summer scene of Southern England. I have visited her a few times. Aunt Walburga's summer home might not be as big as Grimmauld Place, but it is a little nicer there. Bigger windows that look out over the sea. Uncle Orion's house I have never seen. I think he never was fond of us kids. But, what about the Potter estates? I know your father hated the grandeur and formality that came with growing up in pure-blood society, but apart from the house he bought for your mother in Godric's Hollow, you must have inherited at least one."
Considering what he knew about the youngest Weasley child, Severus wanted to know, "And how did … that go?"
For someone so well-liked by almost the entire department, Sandorn certainly had had a hidden dark side. Though always correct, even jovial in his interactions with his colleagues, he seemed to have had no qualms about fabricating or dismissing evidence if it served to gain a conviction for a Dark Wizard. Thomson made two of his lawyers available to go over all of their former colleague's cases and decide which of them needed to be re-tried. It was clear that their department head felt personally insulted by what had happened.
Whimpering slightly, Kreacher tugged on his ears once again, before guiding her to a door on the first level. "Sir has made it clear that Kreacher is not to enter this room." After a heartbeat, he added, "Mistress shouldn't either."
Draco, who had just fastened his saddle on a beautiful, cream−coloured beast gasped when he watched his mother mounting her mare. Her motion was as elegant as if she had just stepped onto the dancefloor of the Manor. What shocked him, however, was her forgoing a saddle. "Mother!" He exclaimed scandalised. "How can you … you said that a noble should never ride a horse without the proper attire!"
"Not really." George yawned, scratching his belly.
When Walburga woke him, he merely grumbled. Surely Neville would forgive him for being late. He was a good friend. As the painting cleared her throat, informing him primly, "It is a quarter to ten, young Auror. That is stretching even the most lenient boundaries of 'fashionably late'."
While Harry summoned, "Accio Nimbus brooms."
Sententia - at that time 'Arbitrary Decisions' - started as a NaNoWriMo story in 2017, though I did not start posting until 2018. For two more years, I added 50.000 words in November, in addition to about the same amount throughout the rest of the year.
The raven's attention was drawn away when Narcissa briefly squeezed his hand. "We are very glad that you have finally woken. We have, indeed, been quite concerned." From a pureblood and Lady that was practically a declaration of love, so it was now Harry's turn to blush and avoid her gaze.
After a few moments and a strengthening sip of whiskey, the Potion Master stated, "I see. Are you concerned about binding yourself to a Black Widow, so to speak?"
Chuckling, because Harry was well aware that Molly Weasley was most certainly not the female Teddy was dressing up for, he corrected, "The Weasleys are on Sunday."
"Have you ever thought it
magic had the sole intention to protect me when you created it."
--O-O--
Harry had steadied himself with Severus' help, and was roughly scrubbing over his face. Grateful, he squeezed his former professor's arm before addressing the panting, "So you're more like my parents than you were before; with more memories?"
"You touch it again, with intent."
Then he watched her firing a couple of jinxes and hexes at him, all of whom glided past him, leaving only a gentle tingling behind. Turning, twisting and stretching, Harry grinned decisively. "It's much more comfortable than my usual armour. I love it!"
--O-O--
His vassal indeed looked so pitiful that the young man could not help but laugh. "You're always welcome, Lucius. You should know that by now. But don't you think it would be easier for you to tell your lovely wife that you need a break? According to Hermione, the verbal attacks on you have died down, but not stopped. Everybody would get it if you needed a weekend of calm solitude."
Looking at the man who had not moved in nearly half a decade, Harry tousled his hair agitated and whispered, "There has to be a way because we can't go on like we are. That's simply not acceptable." He was talking about more than the state of Wizarding Britain, but his patient was not able to offer any reply, another situation the young man found unacceptable, but had no idea how to change.
"Harry! Harry! Nana made me a new plane, look!"
>To Harry, from the family<
He would, most definitely, not disrespect Severus Snape to the point of 'publishing' his journals.
Satisfied, Andromeda rose from the sofa and told Harry, "I will be sleeping here tonight."
Once both wizards had settled with a book, the pureblood mentioned, "A marriage does not have to be based on love to be happy. In fact, most in our circles are not. They are arranged in the cradle, and the children are expected to respect their families' wishes. Mostly, it is enough if both partners know what is expected of them and can come to an agreement. Love comes with time if you are fortunate and willing to make an honest effort."
"Of course, …" the Potion Master had closed his eyes in defeat. "Of course, Harry Potter would inha… have a house with talkative wards."
"You still have Harry and Draco."
"Will do."
Not looking up from the documents he had pulled out again, the former Lord deadpanned. "The horses, most of our owls and half our house−elves."
"Sure," the witch shrugged. "We waited for three years after Rose was born before we tried again, and we'll give ourselves the same amount of time, after Hugo." Rubbing her belly, she assured, "Who we will love just as much if he's a she. Just saying, sweetheart."
"Ice cream!"
knew. "Prejudice and racism will not be tolerated! Not as long as I am Minister. So I implore you: put down your wands and end this madness. Cursing the very land we live on will only lead to disaster and destruction."
Rising from the floor, Hermione started to explore their prison cell, trailing her fingertips over the walls. It was crude, only a few feet in any direction. But at least it was dry and moderately warm. "That's not true, and you know it."
From Sydney, he flew to Los Vegas and spent an entire weekend wrapped up in women, booze and gambling. Since he had never had much money, he had set himself a sensible limit on how much to spend. Yet when he woke on Monday morning, with more money in his pocket, he suspected that his magic had given him a little nudge.
"Knew that Severus Snape was not, in fact, dead, as everyone believed."
dangerous example to set, and Hermione was determined to solve it! Yet, with George by her side, him calmingly putting a hand on her shoulder in an implied offer of support, she unwound a bit and was able to take a steadying breath. She was not alone in this. Like all the times before when there had been trouble, she had her friends and family by her side, so they would solve this puzzle, without the shadow of a doubt!
"I …"
At Ron's inviting gesture, Lucius chose a place at the broad oak-table that dominated the kitchen and helped himself to some tea Ron had set down before him. In the meantime, Harry helped to clean up Rose a little bit and started to assemble the cookie recipe as per the girl's instructions, so that his friend could return to his dinner preparations.
--O-O--
Chuckling under his breath, Harry admitted, "Kreacher and I had a rather … rocky start. When I offered him clothes after moving in, he wouldn't talk to me for a week. After noticing that I was cleaning the house by hand, he started helping. I think he forced himself to accept that I am the last Master he will ever get, and that Grimmauld Place is my home; while at the same time not thinking that I am worth the position since I am but a half−blood.
A heartbeat later, Narcissa followed.
Leaning against the fading wallpaper, Draco felt pretty small. True, this afternoon's conflict had banished his parents from the grounds, one by word and one by choice. But still, he could be sure, that his mother and father were all right. No matter how much he feared Malfoy Manor, it was still their home, and they were safe there. The mere idea of losing them as Potter had lost so many threatened to suffocate Draco. He just could not fathom a world without his parents in it.
"I never thought so," she assured. "May I continue?"
With a smile, Harry remarked, "Your speech has improved these last few weeks."
"Remus …" Harry whispered, clutching the table in front of him. The man had lost two of his best friends through the betrayal of another, that night. He had lost his family as much as Harry had if his stories were to be believed. Still, he had remembered to save James' and Lily's wands from possible raiders and gold-diggers. Had kept them safe for Harry to find more than twenty years later.
"You losing it won't help!" The brunet snarled, battling Harry's involuntary magic, so it stayed contained to their office. Fed up with this, he demanded, "You need to calm down!"
Taking a deep breath, Harry put the cup back on the table, like a peace offering. “Lucius Malfoy has the knowledge and desire to help us. All he needs is the opportunity.” Holding up his hand to ward off an interruption, he continued. “I know you don’t trust him, Sir, and honestly, it would be naïve of me to expect you to. But we are stuck with this case, and we all know it. We need help, so, I guess what I am here to ask is: can you trust me, to take this chance to make things right.”
"Depending on my superior's decision, we might have to keep your wand as evidence."
Gently turning the boy around, forcing him to meet his eyes, "Knowing your mother was the best thing that happened to me in my entire life. She was my guiding light during a childhood nearly as ugly as yours. True, circumstances and pride kept us from remaining friends past our teenage years, yet never – not even with my dying breath – have I ever regretted loving Lily Evans."
"Not my story to tell. But when was the last time you did Narcissa the courtesy and kissed her hand?"
The first two flights had gone off without a hitch, though he had had to rely heavily on the bannister. The last few steps were another matter entirely. Though the former spy would never have admitted it, he had considered taking a break before finishing his way to the ground floor. However, the pride of a man who had foiled the Dark Lord's plans numerous times had not allowed any leniency. Had he given in he would have spared himself quite some of turmoil.
Neville gathered his composure and ordered, "Sit down! Both of you. I'll go and get us the floo protocols from the Manor, and we'll take it from there. Harry, Narcissa, we will find them! I promise!"
"Auror Jenkins, so good to see you again." She said in an overly friendly tone. "and you brought Lady Malfoy, how very thoughtful of you. I'm sure Harry will appreciate your efforts when he wakes. Now, Narcissa−dear, why don't you help me feed that stubborn son of yours? In his concerns for Harry, he is neglecting himself entirely."
Silver eyes … beautiful silver eyes appeared before him. But no matter how much he tried to communicate, he felt like he was running against a wall. That was Draco, he recognised, his godson. Why wouldn't he let him in?
Before Harry could reply, the flames flared up. "May I come through?"
"A cauldron, my love, and please, Draco, I am sure your mother would appreciate some hot juice as much as I would."
"You know perfectly well that he was not even listening properly!" The Potion Master scolded.
−−O−O−−
"But … but … but I want to help Harry," Teddy wailed until Draco shouldered past the two women.
Wordlessly, Harry shook his head.
"Of course," Alexander straightened and offered his arm. "Lady Malfoy, would you do me the honour?"
Now the two were sipping camomile tea, not really talking until Harry sighed exasperated, "Alright, what's in that blasted letter?"
Looking from Harry to Severus, brushing a kiss over the man's knuckles before putting his hand back on the bed, Draco held out his own hand for the vial of blood Harry was still clutching so hard as if his life depended on it. Closing his fingers gently around it, he promised, "I will do my very best."
"Alright," Teddy beamed, already skipping out the door towards the downstairs bathroom.
"Yes."
"Aunt Andromeda is downstairs."
"Master Draco has not even gone to sleep." The elf glared, rubbing his forehead, where Harry had nearly toppled the both of them.
After a minute, his former professor challenged, "And yet you do the same."
"A little," Neville confirmed, though he was offering a comforting smile at the same time. "However, since we are friends, I don't mind sharing. We've been through worse than different opinions about spirituality. When I was young, I was … heavily encouraged to join my grandmother in her prayers to Esus. He's a triple god with aspects of war, thunder and is also called 'the god of the people'. My father was brought up praying to him. But when I started Hogwarts, when I realised that I would always be so much better at growing things than destroying them, I looked and found a goddess that suited me much better. Praying to her actually gave me comfort instead of merely being 'something to be done'. Since I was eleven, my prayers and sacrifices had gone to Anu, the Earth Goddess of Nature and Agriculture."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Estates? As in more than one?"
"I'm sorry," the raven-haired felt the need to say. "I didn't know."
Briskly, Harry shook his head, "Of course not! Astoria Greengrass is a strong and kind person. How could I hate her, considering what she is willing to do for Draco and his family?"
For more than a month he lived with these people, breathed their magic until his very soul started hurting because he missed his home so much. The last thing the men and women of the Brazilian temple taught him, was how to connect points of high power. Portkeys, he was educated, were a shortcut over small distances, a couple of hundred miles at best. But if you were able to feel the very magic of the earth, with enough power, you could travel the ley-lines from one node to another. So, he tried and meditated, learning to sink into the ground to follow the power-grid that surrounded the planet. Harry was not able to travel farther than the edges of the country, but his teachers congratulated him because that was quite an achievement for someone who had had no knowledge about parselmagic before. They showed him a map of the world as they knew it and with little difficulty, Harry could identify the node of power at home. He helped prepare the ritual and promised to return, but they all knew that to be a lie. Still, they let it go and offered an open invitation.
"I would care for some ventilation, Kreacher. We could make it work." Harry assured him, but the house-elf shook his head decisively, taking Draco's and Harry's hand, guiding them down the corridor. Before the blond got the chance to ask what this was all about, the elf looked them in the eyes and revealed in a firm tone, "Master Regulus' lab is in the attic of No. 12 Grimmauld Place."
Easing the tremors, he had forcefully suppressed until now, the blond nodded. "I'll do my best, my … Harry."
I'm sorry for not posting last week but this chapter needed a little more time. However, I promise it will be worth it.
Briefly gazing at the encouraging faces of her friends, Hermione smiled when rising from her seat and stepped down confidently onto the open floor. “Hermione Granger, Department of Magical Law.” Looking at the mostly empty seats of the courtroom, she realised that what Malfoy's story was true: this was a setup. Someone tried to get rid of Lucius Malfoy without drawing attention. But that was not how justice was supposed to work, so Hermione squared her shoulders and announced, “Though I have no doubt that the amount of evidence against Lord Malfoy is overwhelming, we object to the sentence. Me and my friends were the last prisoners in Malfoy Manor, and we don’t feel that justice is served with a simple Kiss. The aftermath of the incarceration and the torture we have suffered under Lord Malfoy’s roof will burden us for the rest of our lives. So, we consider it quaint, that Lord Malfoy serves an equally long sentence.”
Surprised, Draco asked, "What makes you think that I am any good?"
"Don't be," Narcissa replied easily, letting him go. Preparing everything she would need to treat her husband's minor wounds, she reminded him, "You have put a heavy burden on your shoulders today. It is expected of you to need support on occasion. And as I said before, I would be honoured to offer it."
Snorting, Draco shook his head. "You can't really believe that, Potter. Nobody is that altruistic."
"What for?"
the way to go!"
With the help of her husband, Narcissa pulled the knitted garment over her head, admiring the way it accentuated her still slightly too small waist. An emerald snake wound around a stitched letter 'N'. Gazing at her sister, whose jumper was midnight blue, the witch admired the silver-green serpent that moulded itself to a white letter 'A'.
"You are right," Harry grinned, offering his hand for her to take. "This is so much better!"
. He was not overly comfortable, but he had known pain in his life. What he was feeling now, was mild irritation at best.
Obviously irritated, both by Hermione's explanation and the heroics of a former, convicted Death Eater, Robarts growled, "Give me that!" When he reached for the cane, he barely made contact before he flinched back, letting it fall to the floor. His hand was covered in blisters as if he had reached into fire for several seconds. "Bloody hell, Malfoy!"
The older wizard's voice was acidic as he stated, "You, Mr Potter, are not my caretaker!"
"Know better."
"I, … we, … okay, I … ahm … I'm sure we can adapt our plans accordingly." Trying to catch up, Harry wacked his brain about social standing and jobs tied to it. He had learned - mostly from Neville, and a little from Andromeda - that a governess was more or less the predecessor to tutors in pureblood society. Maybe Rosier had wanted a chaperone for his wife and not called it such? He should ask his partner, or better yet Draco since this woman would live under their roof. He startled when the floo flared up, and a beautiful young Lady, with wood shavings attached to the hems of her robes, entered. Baffled, Harry watched Astoria's face lighting up as she rose and kissed the witch. "Welcome home. How was your day, my love?"
"No," he whispered hoarsely, "No!" he repeated louder as his entire body started to tremble. Frantically, he looked at Harry. "No, … Luius, dander. No! Down! … No! Lyar. … Loyal. Alwai. …
"Draco, I …" the raven-haired protested, clutching the doorknob so tightly as if his life depended on it. But once again, the blond cut him off.
Trading smiles with his friends, Harry and the others tilted their heads at the former Slytherins, for refraining from commenting on this remark. Secretly, Harry pondered that Luna helping Narcissa in the kitchen, all afternoon, to prepare a delicious dinner, was to thank for that. Anyway, when they sat around the kitchen−table half an hour later, enjoying several meat−pies and a fresh salad, the Slytherins and Gryffindors alike went out of their way to show their appreciation for the delicious meal.
"Oh, wait. Ahm …" tousling his sleep-mussed hair, Harry stammered, "I have to … please, don't hex me for this … I …" he then reached carefully under Severus' pillow and pulled out his wand. "Ron discovered it in the boathouse and kept it for you."
"Ice−cream?" Lucius wondered. "But it's getting colder already."
Sighing, Severus admitted, "It would help if that idiot boy knew
Pulling the other man against his chest, Harry let him ride out wave after wave of overflowing emotions. The room around them started to shake, and Harry cast a Silencio to keep his other guests from waking. Sure, Narcissa and Lucius would want to help, but Draco was his responsibility now. Caressing the blond's head when the shaking let up, Harry eased him under the covers, not getting up when, even in his exhausted state, Draco held on to his wrist like a lifeline.
"I need a muscle stren… streng…," damn those sounds! At least the witch knew better than to correct him by now. He was no child in need of guidance, no matter how much he sounded like one. "Tisle. Tistle!
Aware that there was literally nothing any of them could do that night, Draco knocked briefly before entering. Drawing his wand, he gazed at Harry, who had just jumped up from 'their' armchair. With a flicker of his wrist and a mumbled incantation, the chair expanded into a settee big enough for them both. Then he shuffled past Potter and stretched out on it. Once comfortable, Draco lifted his arm. After but a moment of hesitation, the raven-haired joined him.
"Yes, you have! I will not have the Malfoys take the stage following someone who looks like a beggar."
Enjoy the new chapter :).
>To Mum and …<
Miffed, Harry replied haughtily, "I will have you know, that I can think for myself on occasion."
--O-O--
"Where?"
When Draco stopped mid-sentence, Severus studied his face, but could not discover what had him so despairing. "You and Daphne had gone along quite well if I remember correctly. Are you concerned that you won't … will not be able to come up with a suitable arrangement? I have little doubt that your parents would be willing to offer advice if needed."
Ron, however, traded a mere look with his brother, who gave him a sharp nod, stepping up to their mother. He kissed her forehead, then rubbed his nose over Rose's cheek. "If you would ask us if this was the smartest thing to do, I would tell you, 'No, probably not', but …"
Griphook didn't say a word as he carted them back to the surface. As they departed, he held Ron back. "I'll be in my office until seven."
As Lawyers were not allowed to carry a wand during interrogation, Goldsmith had claimed her wand - as well as Sandorn's - as soon as they had entered. Now he placed Hermione's on the table.
"We …" the team-leader started, but closed his mouth again, since he was too caught up in his anger, he could not say for sure.
"Severus!"
"Hey," the child smiled weakly. "You're the sleepin' wizard from the other bedroom."
"They are not my parents," Harry whispered, looking out of the dark windows. All he could see was his own, distorted reflection. He had to remind himself, again and again, lest he started projecting. "I wish they were, so much it actually hurts. But they aren't. They are reflections of what my parents had been. And though I love having them around, your and Draco's comfort is still more important, because unlike them, you are alive. If you don't want my dad to have access to your room, I get that. I won't mount a picture in my office either. At least not a magical painting."
"Yes, Mr Potter?" McGonagall looked up from her grading, still more comfortable to do it here than in the office. Surprised, she noticed her former pupil fidgeting, so she transfigured one of the desks into an armchair and invited, "Tea?"
Tilting her head, the pureblood replied, "Thank you, for listening."
"Mate, he's even weirder than usual. You know how Hermione is with house−elves, so she searched Grimmauld Place top to bottom until she found him in the cellar. He was hiding … is hiding in an old wine−barrel but won't even talk to her. Not even to Narcissa when she tried to give him an order. We have no clue what's going on, but at least he is physically alright. He even allowed Hermione one diagnostic spell to get her off his back."
"I am sure it is delicious," Narcissa offered, serving her husband and herself, before taking a small bite.
It was clear to everyone that Percy would be lost to them, for the rest of the day.
of January and bring you back here on the 1
"I'll help you," Hermione offered, but Draco held her back. "Let me."
They had spent the better part of the day moving boxes. Yet, when they had encountered a particularly resilient chest, that just would not bulge, Harry and Lucius had exhausted themselves trying to get it out of the attic. All they could do now was request help. Once the letter was written, Harry opened the window and looked around his garden. “Fox, are you here? I have a letter to deliver.” Leaving the window wide open, the young man returned to his desk and pulled a bag of owl-treats from the last drawer to the right.
blind not to see how much the young man loved his godson. Hence, he could understand the boy's … young man's frustration, when Andromeda stated, for what seemed like the umpteenth time. "I know that you would never willingly put him in danger. But we have to get him to St. Mungos. They have a whole department, specialised on poison-victims."
Next, there had been clothes: robes, dresses, shoes, jewellery in all the colours of the rainbow. Harry selected a set of simple black titanium cufflinks for Ron - very resistant to potions and other laboratory disasters that tended to happen in the brother's lab, Harry had discovered them in America and sent them back for the Weasley brothers, and Snape, since all tended to work in volatile surroundings - and a slim bangle of the same dark colour for Hermione. Quite an elegant piece that would go lovely with her every-day robes. Opening another jewellery case, the young wizard had chuckled, "Dad seemed to really have a thing for cuff-links. At least I know where to go before the next Ministry function."
"No, he would not, not even when he walked around in fraying second-hand robes," Lucius replied with a small smile. "But he was entirely agreeable to be paid for his work. Headache-cures, Pepper-Up Potions and certain hair products were always in high demand, and with my help he got quite an operation going. Unofficially of course."
Relieved, Fred smiled. "She said to tell you 'thank you' for doing what she could not because of her stupid pride."
Patiently Severus waited until his godson had eaten and had had two cups of tea. As the boy started his third, he sighed. "Now, would you please explain to me what you were talking about, earlier?"
Shaking her head, the former Lady Black looked at her husband, as if he was a particularly dense first year. "Magic is all about intent," she lectured. "But more than that, it is about belief. Not only what the witch or wizard believes, but those surrounding them. Our son is the perfect Slytherin. He thinks and watches and then decides on the course of action with the most benefits for himself and those he cares about. If everybody is convinced that he belongs to Harry Potter - the Saviour of the Wizarding World - mind, body and soul, he is safer by his side, than behind even the strongest wards of Malfoy Manor. They are bound together by a promise. Nothing more, nothing less. And you and I know perfectly well, how easily such a promise can be broken. Because otherwise, why would He have ever needed these?" she asked, gently brushing her fingers over the Dark Mark on Lucius' wrist.
'This whole place can go to hell!' Harry thought, but then rolled his eyes. "Ruby?" When the elf appeared, he commanded, "Make sure that any potential fire stays confined to the dungeon and your mistress house doesn't burn to the ground. Can you do that?"
Accepting the unspoken invitation, Draco curled up beside him. Sleeping together had become a comfort they both needed from time to time but had never talked about it in the light of day. "So, the case is closed."
But the ghostly figure interrupted him. "Don't, Harry. I know George has talked to you about it already, but to make sure that you really get it: What happened to me is not on you!"
--O-O--
"You still think it's a good idea?"
Once the door had closed behind her, Draco curled into himself and whispered, "Harry, please, you have to find me, or I'm going to go insane."
"To be honest, Harry, we need a change. The future is passing us by, and no matter how powerful we think we are, the muggles will overwhelm us with their technology and their science. We need our coming generations, to be open to such things. A generation who leads us into the 21
"I, …" the raven-haired started but knew it would be foolish of him to protest that basic truth.
to do that?"
Looking up from the puff pastry he had spread out over the kitchen table, the young wizard was surprised to find Lucius hovering at the door of the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. The bad conscience of the man was palpable, and the young man might have been tempted to laugh, but the thought of this man, his vassal, the person he had saved from the Dementor's Kiss believing him capable of collaring and caging someone, his son on top of that, killed all sparks of humour.
Awed the young metamorphmagus' hair turned a snowy white when he reached out to let the little fox sniff his fingers. Only when the trembling eased, did he cautiously touch the head of the shy animal. To Harry's relief, the boy was overly cautious as he whispered, "He looks hungry."
"I doubt that's true, love," his mother tried to offer comfort. Yet his father probed, "What makes you think that?"
"Sorry, silly me," Harry apologised, cleaning up his mess with a quick Tergeo.
"Have you …" Hermione started, but cut herself off after a moment.
Surprised by that concise description, the man tilted his head after a moment. "Basically. I never expected to find myself in such a position. All my life, I have thriven to make up for something. So now that I have enough money to support myself, no family and no conflicting masters, I feel … at a loss."
Slowly drifting into sleep, Severus wondered why the gesture had felt so right and so wrong at the same time.
"Nothing we have not seen before," his Ex grinned. When Harry pointedly looked at her fiancé, the youngest Weasley-sibling chuckled and covered Justin's eyes. "Don't worry. I'll protect your innocence, dear."
Handing back his wand, Narcissa shook her head. "Not yet."
"Excuse me?" Hermione gapped. "Astoria has a boyfriend?"
"He's a child!"
"Harry's," Pansy stated, studying her friend.
Once Neville had left the oppressing house, he took a liberating breath. He couldn’t imagine living in such a suffocating home. Not even counting all the horrible things Hermione, Luna and Ron had endured in here. When his eyes fell on the neglected herbal garden, his heart broke in sympathy with all the wilting plants. Looking around, he was able to see the grandeur that had once reigned. But years of neglect had taken its toll, especially on nature.
"Being up and about is actually good for him," he heard the witch's voice from the side and one of his desk-chairs sliding over the terrace. "As is the fresh air." Emilia entered his line of sight, gazing down. "From what I remember, Fridays spent with your friends, usually last longer than five p.m. And you have never brought a guest before." With a sigh, she waved her wand over his body. "From everything I have heard, I would consider Mr Longbottom trustworthy. If Mr Snape disagrees, he would have done something about it already. However, since they are staring at each other over tea and biscuits, I will take my leave now. " Putting away her wand, she added, almost as an afterthought, "I would free you, but I guess that would cut your partner's punishment short, and I don't want to interfere. Have a good weekend, Harry."
"Where should I put …," Ron asked, weaving the wrapped-up painting.
"What do you think they are doing?" Neville mumbled, guarding his plate of raisin cookies jealously.
Emerald, however, did not let this criticism bother her. "Sir-Master-Harry said 'brilliant'. Now we play!"
Draco did not understand, a glance at the other wizard told Harry as much. No wonder, he was babbling … explaining a decision he had barely processed himself. However, since the blond seemed ready to give him time to sort through his thoughts, Harry scrubbed over his face and shook his head in an attempt to clear it. "I saw his past. He was best friends with my mum, did you know that?"
When the gathered witches and wizards smirked at Draco, the blond snatched up the container with the chocolate mint ice-cream and took a humungous scoop before pushing it at Harry. His, "Shut up!" had all of them explode into giggles.
After a moment of hesitation, Harry nodded. It was better to go into the first day of the new year together.
Of course, he had had the best of intentions of returning after but a few moments. Harry, had excused himself for a mere minute, stating that he only intended a brief chat with his superior. Draco was aware that his family was skating on thin ice tonight. One wrong move could destroy all the progress his father had made with the Department of Law Enforcement. They might cost Harry his job, even his reputation if they were not careful. So, when the grey-haired wizard with the cold, blue eyes – Draco had recalled him vaguely from a few of his parent's 'social' gatherings – had stirred him to the side, he had done his best not to make a scene, despite the sinking feeling in his stomach. Now, his opposite was boldly clutching his chin between ice-cold fingers, turning his head, as if Draco was a horse, stirred up for inspection. When he tried to pull back, the grip turned into a steel-clamp, making him suppress a whimper.
Speeding up their steps, the four burst into the kitchen, only to step back out and in again, making sure they had not entered an alternate reality. In their defence, the picture that presented itself was most unusual for a Weasley household. All children in attendance, sat at the enlarged kitchen-table that was adorned with mismatched plates, cups and glass-wear as well as all cutlery available in the house. That might not be that surprising, but nobody was loud or unruly nor reaching over his or her neighbours' plates for a certain dish. No, the children sat patiently, only nibbling on an assortment of diced fruits that lay on their plates. At the stove, in the middle of Harry's many food-containers stood Andromeda and Narcissa, preparing coffee and tea, slicing up rolls and reheating food Harry had prepared so painstakingly the day before.
Caressing his head, smiling when his hair turned white-blond, Narcissa assured him, "That is very powerful magic, Teddy. That's the only thing that magic is really about. Do you know what 'intent' means?"
The night passed in quiet conversation, joyous laughter and the recollection of happy memories. Most family members rose out of a light doze, when Arthur left his place beside Molly, declaring solemnly, "It is time!"
"Mother?" Instantly concerned, the young wizard sat up straight. "Why? What's wrong? Is she in trouble?" Paling, he looked down at the table, where he had just levitated some toast. "It's me, isn't it? In using a wand, so I'm violating the terms of our house-arrest. Since they can't get to me, as I'm under your protection they take it out on mother. "
Neville looked at his colleague, then at Harry, who let his wand fall into his hand, hissing a spell under his breath, then back at the Unspeakable. "No, I mean: how did you know that Severus Snape was alive?"
--O-O--
"Hermione?"
"Lucius is a good husband and always tried to bring honour and glory to his house, just like his father taught him. But he tended to make the wrong choices when going about it. He needs a guiding influence, that is not ruthless and cruel. My husband was a good man once. But I am afraid he will need a lot of help to remember that. As for Draco, he tried his best to be strong and supportive. But everything that has happened, especially everything that has happened here, he seems to be slowly breaking. I know that he barely sleeps at night and that he tears himself apart over his inability to support us by growing food. No matter how menial the task you have for him, he will thrive if he can succeed for once. So, no, my Lord, nothing could be further from the truth than me being angry with you."
--O-O--
"Why?" The blond grinned. "
"No," the young wizard spat, "You were in coma, more dead than alive! It would have needed very little to push you into the afterlife. Is that what you would have wanted?"
Not knowing how to proceed, Harry had remained on his knees, watching, listening, trying to gauge the reaction of these people. Then the apparent leader had stepped before him, banging his spear on the floor, shooting fireworks into the sky. When the man had looked at him expectantly, he had cast a Patronus. Though he doubted that they had ever seen a deer, they understood the inherited magic, and with a toothy smile, the man had offered his hand and helped Harry to his feet. He then had been invited to join them and entered their home through the pyramid. Harry had emerged on the other side into a picturesque valley where women were preparing food and clothes, children were running screaming between them and men were labouring away on the fields and plantations that seemed to cover the mountain walls surrounding them.
"Who said that?"
Considering her grumbling stomach, Hermione was quite taken with that idea and was half-way through her plate, before inspecting him properly. Lucius sat straight as a ruler, not leaning against the wall. He was spooning up some bland stew, obviously forcing his hands not to shake. Suddenly losing all appetite, she wanted to know, "What did they do?"
"Of course not, he …" relaxing slowly Harry nodded. "Thank you."
"Why would you think anything is different now?" The blond asked a little bitter. He had done research, lost sleep and maybe a little bit of his sanity when working on his godfather's potions. Especially considering how chummy he now was with all the Gryffindors in his life. And then that bastard dared to give up before they had explored all venues of what might help his recovery.
Shrugging, the Auror pondered, "Keep her out of my office. Since you love the books in the Black-Library nearly more than me, I have complete faith in you to keep anything of value safe." When he noticed the visible sag in Draco's shoulders, Harry stepped up to him and reached out. "Honestly, Draco, I trust you." Reaching out to caress the little fox's head, the raven-haired smiled. "If you want to bring her along, I have complete faith in you to take care of her."
An angry glint lit up Snape's eyes, "I never turned my back on you! I have always done my best to protect your family. My godson!"
Soberly, his father concluded, "A curse-scar."
"Fine," turning on his heel, Severus preceded, holding open his door.
"Thank you, Professor McGonagall," her former pupils chorused.
"A while?" Cynthia snorted under her breath, mumbling, "Try a day or two. Michael was beside himself for an entire week when we …" Gazing at the female Inquisitor, she caught herself just in time before repeating, "He might take a
"He is," she confirmed, choosing a place, facing him. "Don't think that I have not gone over every combat spell, curse and jinx I have ever been taught, for the last few hours. I know, I can be an asset, my parents raised me a Black after all. But neither you nor I can do this alone. We have to trust Harry."
"Really, Narcissa?" Lucius took another sip. "I always thought you enjoyed that particular type. We have a vast amount of it in store."
Even after two hours of interrogation, the witch appeared determined to hold on to said prize. She continuously denied all accusations of being involved in Draco's abduction. Harry was ready to storm the room, but Charles held him back. "She's not lying per se and hitting her with random curses won't be well received. We'll have to try a different approach. Come on, Potter. Let's go."
"Yes," the young potioneer. "I found a nest in the walls and keep them around … for Inari to chase. She needs to keep up her predatory instincts."
Since he had had a previous engagement with his fiancée, that evening, Neville did not come to Grimmauld Place, despite having promised to take a look at the wards. The next day, after reading the headlines of the Prophet and other local newspapers that had been rather flattering for the Auror Department, the partners left work in high spirits.
"Better with the potion," Draco revealed, kissing his mother's cheek when she offered him a cup of tea.
"I can assure you, Harry," Severus stated calmly. "Had you had any intentions of pursuing a relationship with Miss Weasley, you would have most definitely have needed one!"
"Our children?"
--O-O--
Outraged, Narcissa hissed, "And you did not think to contact any member of your family?"
Nodding, the brunet explained, "One way or the other, each and every one of Harry's friends and family possesses an item, similar to this cane."
Surprised, Severus turned towards Harry," He trapped you in a vault with an active Gemini Curse and took the Sword of Gryffindor from you. Why would you trust him with your money?"
"He was a bastard," Harry interrupted this stammering in a quiet, yet decisive tone. "Tom Marvolo Riddle was an insane, sadistic bastard who enjoyed torturing people."
−−O−O−−
−−O−O−−
"Greengrass."
"Merry Christmas, Harry. Don't you like your garden any longer?"
"Thank you, Ron." Ginny smiled before kissing Harry's cheek. "Since you are in good hands now, I have to dash. I have a meeting at nine and practice at eleven. Love you, Harry. Nice to see you, Malfoy. By, Ron, tell mum I'll try for Sunday, but I can't make any promises."
"And we would like to keep it that way," Neville insisted calmly.
Thinking about Hermione, Severus and Bill, Harry nodded. "Possibly."
Since everything is out of sync anyway, I decided to pop out this chapter in the middle of the week, since my beta and I have finished it. Only two more chapters to go. I'm aware that I will leave several plot-lines unfinished, but I've found a good point to stop and somehow wanted this story to 'end'. I think I'll get back to it eventually, though it might take months or even years. Until then, I invite everyone to play in my sandbox if you are so inclined.
Tilting his hand, the young wizard watched his friend fade away. The last time, the stone had given him the strength to do what had to be done. This time … it felt like losing Fred all over again. Through teary eyes, he watched George capture the little gem in its protective casing and then allowed the redhead to pull him into bed. Harry was grateful for the messages, but on nights like these, he sometimes wished for everything to be over, so he could finally be with his family again.
"Mate? Mate, come on, don't do this to me!"
"Lucius," the raven-haired soothed. "It's okay. You're out. Azkaban is over. Voldemort is dead. Shhh … look at me."
Watching the conversation between the two Death Eaters, from behind an enchanted wall, Head Auror Robarts demanded. “Please, explain to me one more time, why you think this is a good idea. And use small words. Otherwise, I doubt that I can follow your leaps of mind.”
“I know you do.”
The elf, however, straightened to his full height, nearly reaching Severus' belt. "Me has been given permission! No other house-elf needs permission to punish himself, only Kreacher! And Kreacher has been given permission, yesterday!"
"I have not."
That brought Draco out of his post-Christmas-fatigue, "Camomile tea, at three p.m.?"
To those of you, who don't celebrate Christmas, have the greatest day ever and enjoy.
"The goblins checked it for me and said, that the picture of the moon correlates with its current phase, making it shine a little. I thought you might like it to … you know … keep track, because watering and weeding sometimes has to be done following the moon-phase."
In the corridor, the Master of the house called upon his elf and then smiled at him in gratitude, "The room is perfect, Kreacher, thank you very much."
"It's the time leading up to them when the students need me the most. And it's not only O.W.L.s but N.E.W.T.s as well. Your library is hidden. All you have to do is guard a few artefacts and catalogue new books when they come out. You have no clue about the destruction pubescent teenagers can cause when they are stressed, with little sleep and too much pepper-up and coffee-fudge from Honeydukes. If I don't return before the end of the month, I am afraid my books will be as good as gone. Also, half the students from my school might suffer nervous breakdowns, because they can't study or do their homework since all the sources they need will be missing!"
"Kingsley might be aware," Harry admitted. "But I'm not entirely sure. He looked at me rather strangely all through the ceremony, where he gave me the Order of Merlin 2
"Actually," Harry piped up from the door, where he had hovered with Hermione, Ron and Lucius. But before he could continue, his best friend squeezed past him and held out his wand to the young Malfoy. "Take mine."
--O-O--
"Or not …," Harry pondered, scrutinising him.
“Damn,” the raven repeated. “Can you heal him?”
"No, I didn't. I thought of all of you. The idea that any of you could come to harm or die just because of me … I couldn't bear that."
“Because” Neville lectured, while opening the door, “Mrs Malfoy is still under house arrest. So, I can guarantee you, that her floo won’t be connected. Since you can’t apparate on the Manor’s grounds, you will be out in the open with your arms full of a known – and let me remind you hated – Death Eater. How do you think it will go, if someone recognises either of you?”
"Milk in camomile tea. Are you sure?" He teased.
"But the elves could, …" the blond protested half-heartedly, while she nudged him out.
"What can Sero be doing for Mrs Andromeda?"
"Because of Daphne. She … she really made something of herself. She's strong and so, so good! She can really make a difference, where she is now. I was always the second daughter. The best I could hope for was an advantageous marriage. Well, I got my wish. And my sister is …" Shaking her head, she angrily brushed away her tears. "It is how it is."
"Purity will always conquer?" Harry replied, looking a little proud of himself. "That's the motto of … of your family."
Frowning, Draco raised his head, scrutinising the little creature. At first glance, she looked perfectly fine, like any other house-elf. But there was something distinctively wrong with her. He just could not lay his finger on it. Then it hit him. Instead of an iris, the elf's eyes seemed set with rubies, not even pupils were visible.
Shuffling into the room, Kreacher put the tray down and prepared the first tea with but a splash of milk and a second with a lot of it and a heap of sugar while grumbling under his breath.  "Mistress Walburga trained her house elves. No elf of the Black family would disgrace the family by being inattentive towards guests."
With a sigh, Harry rose to reclaim his drink. "You know that it drives me nuts when you do that." After swallowing a mouthful of hot chocolate, he did not even struggle, when the other took it back. "And no, I haven't."
"Master-Harry-Sir could not come. Ruby is forbidden from sharing this place with any witch or wizard!"
Ginny and Justin's arrival were met with a cheer so Harry could slip out unnoticed when Kreacher informed him that there was someone in the fireplace. For gatherings like this, he usually kept his wards down for an hour so his friends and family could enter unencumbered. Someone waiting to walk through meant that unexpected guests had decided to join as well. Well, not entirely surprising since Harry
Serving another round of tea, Harry started, "The problem is not the traditions per se, but the reason we need them. The Statute of Secrecy is important, but we take it a step too far. Every person should be allowed to choose their religion, but even in elementary school we learn about different belief systems, other than the Anglican Church."
During her last weekend off, George had gotten hold of one of Ginny's sports-dress and had charmed it to change colours in the middle of her next match. A nifty spell he had been very proud off at the time and promptly used it on their last line of products, colour-changing sweets. It was a great hit with children one and above. Her team had won that match with flying colours, but during the victory-photo the shirt had changed into an appalling shade of pink, clashing horribly with her hair.
let you go!" Hugging his best friend's shoulder, the redhead stated, "But if you want to show your appreciation, for me sticking out my neck for you, all the time, I will take these books and have a read-through, before you throw them at your pet potioneers."
After dusting herself off, Astoria offered a perfect courtesy. "Mr Malfoy, Lord Potter-Black, it is a pleasure to see you. Thank you for your invitation."
Since spying had been second nature to him for the majority of his adult life, Severus Snape barely needed a conscious thought to determine if the house was empty. Therefore, when he felt a little peckish one afternoon, he decided that a trip to the kitchen was in order. He could have called upon the elves, but he had been self-sufficient his entire life and did not plan on giving that up now. Well, at least not in the afternoon. After all, Draco was the only one around and after spending the morning theorising over the librarian's research, the boy … young man had bowed off after their shared lunch. Most likely to return to his sacred lab. An impulse Severus could entirely understand, and he had to suppress his envy that his godson had that chance.
Indicating a bow, the young man departed. He was nearly at the door, when a quiet voice held him back, "Harry?"
Because it would not have been right. That's why!
With unexpected calm, the young wizard shrugged, while sitting down on the bed, caressing his smiling wife's hair. "It seems that you were trying to protect Hermione from a possible intruder."
"Excuse me?" Harry's eyes went impossibly wide, and for a moment, Severus berated himself for making such a stupid request. Surely Potter would laugh his ass off in a second, due to his childish wish. But contrary to the older wizard's expectations, the boy's mouth started to mirror his eyes, until he was positively beaming, not even a hint of mockery on his face. "Oh, Sir, you have no idea, but you are in for a treat!"
"Astute observation," Draco drawled, gesturing for the redhead to open the door for him. "A scared, overwhelmed, nervous fox to be precise." He glared at Harry as if this was somehow his fault.
"I shou… should… should not have told him," Terry hiccupped and started crying. "Now he is angry with me."
Kissing his beloved’s hair, Neville glared at his partner. “If you think that you can leave me hanging at the next Ministry Gala, think again!”
Though their questions were formulated with different levels of eloquence, Lucius' and Robarts' thunderstruck expressions were near identical. But where the Lord remained quiet from then on, the Head Auror had no qualm about sharing his opinion. “Potter, have you gone mad? Or did that bastard somehow put a spell on you? Otherwise, I really can’t imagine why you would make such a ludicrous request. This is completely and utterly out of the question!”
Right on time, this weekend. There is a lot of drama and magic and Harry messing up in this chapter. So I hope all of you will have fun with it :).
Kreacher is a damn cheeky brat. Don't you love him?
"You expect me to know the content of all of your vaults?" The goblin challenged.
Swallowing through a constricting throat, Draco had replied, "A friend from school, Mistress. She had me do hers so many times, I picked things up."
After having finished her second (or maybe third) round of diagnosis spells, Emilia stated sternly, "I assume you have everything under control now, gentlemen?"
--O-O--
may your spirit shine bright, this very night.
Shaking his head, this time in exasperation, the young Auror offered, "Look, your father is trying. I know he is. But the longer this liege-vassal thing is going on, the tenser he seems to become. As if he is just waiting for me to curse him into the next week for speaking out of turn."
obscene curse echoed through No. 12 Grimmauld Place around noon on January 1
"I'm me! How can she not see that?" George shouted, throwing the tumbler against the wall, Harry had used to serve him. It shattered into a thousand pieces, and the raven-haired very much doubted that he would be able to repair that particular glass. Not even with magic. Not that it mattered. "She calls me Fred and then looks so damn guilty that I can't even call her out on it! And I hate her for that, Harry!" He turned his blood-shot gaze on the other wizard who sat on the bed, watching him patiently. Obviously, the alcohol just consumed had not been the first of the day for George, as the young man was wobbling considerably when he slurred, "I hate her so much because she hurts as much as I do, so I can't even scream at her."
“Ron?” Hick! “What’s happening?”
With a heavy heart, Harry rose and bowed out of the office. Robarts was right. He and Neville
If you have questions, I will be happy to answer them. After all, I put a lot of thought into this story and am sure that I can provide believable explanations as to why the characters react the way they do.
Sipping from her tea, as if they were discussing the weather, the medi-witch inquired, "And what if it were not about making amends? What would you want to do if the world would not care?"
Shrugging, his godson admitted, "I drank it."
--O-O--
Severus had been appalled … had felt betrayed by his own body when he had realised that his fingers would not obey his commands as they used to. At his first intended correction on the research Draco had presented to him, he had nearly destroyed the entire page when losing control over the quill. Embarrassed, his godson had claimed the feather, promoting his godfather to dictate his thoughts.
Maybe he should accept Draco’s offer of servitude officially, forming a binding magic contract between the two of them. But until anybody gave him troubles for inviting the two other Malfoys into his home, it was better to leave things as they were. In the end, he didn’t want any more power over their family. Draco’s word was enough for him.
"I know," Lucius sighed, rising and putting his hands on his son's shoulders. His child had received precious little these last few years and never anything without a hidden agenda. A present from someone as pure as Teddy Lupin; given with the only goal to make Draco forget his sadness, was infinitely precious. "But is it really worth antagonising our only source of good−will over it? We are entirely dependent on Potter. How do you think will he feel if he sees you with an offering, he has to know was meant for him? After all, Teddy didn't even know you would be here."
"No, I merely changed the place where it is stored, official note included. I might have forgotten the magical trail to my office, and I am afraid my quill was leaking when I wrote down my name. Still, the process is entirely legal. It is not my fault that they aren't giving us better tools to work with."
Draco suffered through the night, by starring at the ceiling of his room, trying to discover when exactly his loyalties had shifted, prioritising Potter's emotional wellbeing over that of his family. That moment had to have happened since there was no other explanation to have taken Potter's concerns more seriously than his father's, still, he could not find it. Lucius was undoubtedly suffering, but the idea of him attacking Harry again made Draco think that he deserved the punishment his liege had heaped on his head. How horrible of a son was he?
Capturing her son's hands, that ran frantically over her body to discover a potential injury, she stilled him with a kiss on the forehead. "Be at ease, Draco, everything turned out fine." She then stepped aside, so her son stood face to face with his father.
"You and your son are still under house−arrest," someone growled. "And while the young Mister Malfoy might be permitted to be here due to his acclaimed vow of servitude, the same cannot be said for you. So, either you return home, or we will send you to Azkaban since you are violating the terms of your confinement!"

"Something …" the blond helped out in a whisper, scared to offend the proud man, who put so much visible effort into speaking clearly, despite not having had the chance for several years. Apparently, the support was not appreciated, since the man glared at him and forced out, "… another."
Leaning over the exhausted figure, caging him by placing his hands right next to the shackled arms of the Death Eater, the young Auror whispered into his ear, “Because I have your son. Draco pledged his freedom to me for the mere attempt to get you out. So, no matter the outcome, your boy is mine to do with as I please.” Chuckling darkly, he continued, “And Narcissa, your beautiful, strong wife, is struggling as it is. Always hungry, locked in a mansion where insanity reigned for too long. How much time before she follows in the footsteps of her sister Bellatrix and simply relinquishes her hold on sanity without you?”
With a look that told Harry precisely what Kreacher thought of this, the elf snapped his fingers, and a tray with pristine, white plates appeared on the kitchen table. Picking up the pot, Kreacher distributed the now steaming soup equally between the pre−heated dishes. "Sir wants to drink his tea now."
"I … I know that you are together, together. Nana explained it to me. You are living in the same house and share your problems, and you laugh and fight and touch each other. You even share a room. But when I'm here, you do nothing of these things Nana said normal couples do. So, I … I thought maybe you didn't want me around so you could be happy again. Together!"
"That's your theory." The Auror pointed his spoon at her, only to put it down sheepishly when Narcissa looked at the offending cutlery with raised eyebrows. "Sorry," he mumbled, before picking up speed again, "The point is, we do not know anything for sure."
"What about tea?"
"Why?"
"Why?" Draco wanted to know somewhat snappish, making the young witch flinch.
"That mudblood Evans? But you …"
"I had a proposal today," Draco stated out of the blue.
"Mate," Ron put a comforting hand on Harry's shoulder, remembering all too clearly the hesitant and somewhat frightened boy he had met on the train nearly fifteen years ago. "That's a lot of change. How do you plan to achieve that?"
"I didn't," Harry sighed exhaustedly. "For the longest time, I had no clue. But every time a part of Tom was close, my scar started hurting. I even piggy-back on his emotions. As soon as he became aware of it, he used the knowledge to torment me." Severus was supposed to teach me Occlumency, but … it did not go overly well. His way of 'teaching' was on par with Voldemort's vision." However, despite the bad things that had happened between him and his professor, the young wizard merely shrugged it off, prompting his father to muse.
With a weak smile, Lucius corrected himself, “No, you are most certainly not. Thank you, Harry.”
Finally entering, Lucius walked to the little suite in front of the merrily crackling fire, so he could face his liege. "The librarians are running potion experiments. Narcissa supervises. There are magical creatures everywhere. I just … please, don't make me go back there, Harry."
Though the patriarch of the Malfoy Family had initially been irritated by the invasion of privacy the librarians had dared to commit, he was not blind to the boost of morals his wife received from working with them. Ever since these witches and wizards had come along, Narcissa had been calmer, more confident and more focused. Back in her own element. The years under the Dark Lord's boot had taken their toll on all of them, but these days, Narcissa was slowly turning back into the vibrant witch Lucius had fallen in love with. So he could not really disapprove of those librarians, even though the bubbly witch treated every flat surface in the Manor as her personal chair, and Manson was walking in and out of the Malfoy Library as if it was his own. Fortunately, every last one of them showed the volumes his ancestors had collected the respect they deserved.
--O-O--
"What by Merlin and Morgana is going on here?" Emilia's voice thundered through the room, with her looming imposingly in the doorway. She looked as if she had fallen out of bed recently and raced from the living-room floo right up to the third floor in one go. After taking but a heartbeat to judge the situation, she cast, "Somnis!" Severus instantly fell asleep. Pulling together the robe she had slipped over her pyjamas, she started to cast a preliminary spell, before demanding with a stern gaze, "Gentlemen, there better be an excellent explanation for why you tried to restraint my hysteric patient! I have a strict working schedule and do not appreciate being called out of bed and home at this hour!"
The young Auror reached out once again, knowing what Emilia Nightingale was capable of when defending a patient. There was a reason he trusted her with the life and well-being of Severus Snape after all. Yet, instead of growing angry, rising to the bait, she stated coldly, "And I am responsible for his care. So, if you don't want to add yourself to my list of patients Mr Malfoy, I suggest you do as I say!" And before either wizard even got the chance to contradict her, she had pointed her wand at them and evicted them from the room.
"It will!" Ron assured her, kissing her forehead.
"No," the other wizard replied gently.
Taking in the room, all witches and wizards present breathed a little easier. "Not perfect," Christopher decided, "but it will do. Now, let's begin."
“Who is ‘we’, Miss Granger?” A law-witch at the side demanded to know. “You are talking plural, but for now you are the only one who demands an altered sentence.”
"Yes, of course, you know what I mean!"
"Yes, Sir," Harry offered a weak smile, squeezing his best friend's hand to assure him that he was alright.
"This leather-bracelet contains an undetectable extension charm. It's not big, just enough for a wand. But if you would allow me a piece of advice: keep it out of sight until absolutely necessary." Only after the Lady's confirming nod, did the young Auror continue. "And lastly, this," opening is hand, he revealed the old snake-ring with the black diamond. "I would very much like for you to wear this."
"Because he
"It's quite obvious," Ron gestured from behind Hermione, before stealing a piece of fruit from her plate. "You want a house-elf to talk, sic our baby-elf on her."
Daphne showed the back of her head, where the newest addition to her team, Alexander Fairchild, had let a box of evidence fall, making her bleed like crazy. "It's probably gone in half a year, with the hair growing over it again, but until then, I am milking it for all that it's worth," she grinned maliciously.
" the Auror bellowed, startling his companion. Grinning, he added, "A goblin will never best you without your explicit permission. You always have to be careful when offered a business proposal for your approval."
"You don't think I am expecting too much?"
Now, they were toasty warm, when Harry set them to the side. Then he carefully wrapped himself into his comforter before curling up on the not overly large bed. He had to feel something, some kind of human contact because despite Ron having been there and having saved him, a part of his mind was still trapped in the horrible ‘what ifs’.
"Time-turner," the quartet replied in one voice.
Remembering his time as head of Slytherin House, the wizard pondered, "In my experience, the Lady Greengrass has raised two very perceptive and cunning daughters. What part of this arrangement sits ill with you?"
--O-O--
After a complicated spell to trace the magic that emerged from the tip of the vine wood wand, Leewood confirmed, "The wand and the spell carry the same magical signature."
Looking at the others, Pendragon sighed and deflated when the other four nodded their consent. "Fine!" He grumbled, "but then I get the Lady Malfoy in return!"
Once he had departed, the trio looked at each other.
Shrugging with forced nonchalance, Severus admitted, "We did. That did not mean I wanted her dead."
"Because we could not let him die."
Why had Draco not tried to explain who the leash and the collar were really for? Why had he chosen Harry's side over his father's?
"Master Regulus' lab is in the attic of No 12 Grimmauld Place."
As soon as the two ghosts were out of sight, Harry whipped around and dashed into Snape's office.
"Midnight it is then," the witch corrected herself, caressing the girl's head to ease her into sleep. "There were once three brothers, who were travelling along a lonely winding road, at midnight. In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water …"
"Yes," the other wizard stated drily. "But since you choose to ignore all corresponding concerns I have brought to your attention, a week into our arrangement, I can't see it becoming an issue now."
Caring and supportive of the smallest of creatures, while at the same time betraying the trust of a person who had protected him his entire life. Of course, the Potion Master and the infamous Harry Potter had never gotten along. But after speaking so passionately at Severus' posthumous trial, getting the Ministry to award an Order of Merlin Second Class, Draco had assumed the 'Saviour' to have more respect for the man's property. However, maybe he was expecting too much. After all, Potter had him searching for antivenoms. So there had to be an important poison victim somewhere.
"I brought your little fox," the redhead replied equally demure.
Despite his worn figure, Draco sank to his knees gracefully on Harry’s living-room carpet and bowed his head in submission. “I’ll be at your service, following your every whim, my Lord. It’s the only thing I have to give since my life is the only thing they have not yet taken.”
"Both, I guess," Harry scratched the back of his head. "Mdm Pomfrey has free access to my home and Emilia works here. I shudder to think what these witches could do if I invoked their ire."
"You want me to put on make-up?"
"But," the young witch gasped.
"With 'civilians' you mean the ex-spy, the Black daughter, and the wizard whose pregnant wife has been abducted?"
--O-O--
"It would be my pleasure, Mr Pince," the witch assured, allowing herself to be guided with his hand covering hers on his arm. When they passed through the door, she advised, "Close your mouth, Harry."
"What if … what if I can't take it? He was a Death Eater for so long. What if his redeeming quality is not enough for us to get along?"
"You had nothin' … nothing in common?"
Trying to defuse the situation, she put a calming hand on Lucius’ arm, deciding, “We will go back to bed and leave the boys to sort this out for themselves.”
Once the meal was finished, the wizards sat relaxed in their chairs with a cup of tea. Harry wanted to know, "Have you made a decision regarding Astoria's offer, Draco?"
"I don't have dizzy spells!" Snape interrupted her sharply.
"Very well." She rose gracefully. "In that case, I expect your owl within a fortnight, since I do not plan to stay a widow for an indeterminate amount of time."
"You messed with my coffee, are you nuts?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Take us," he requested.
"Of course, we will," Neville confirmed, pulling Harry to his feet. "The fact that we can't get Draco out right now, does not mean that we can't get anything
--O-O--
Having already spotted the papers, the pureblood claimed the seat and started to gather an overview.
"A cage," Harry informed him off handily before he returned to discuss his New Year's Eve plans with Narcissa.
Tousling his already messed up hair, the young wizard looked at his live-in patient, and Draco's breath caught in his throat at the amount of pain and longing in the other's eyes. "He's here because I want him to have a chance. Severus Snape and I are not so different when you think about it.
"No brewing!" Draco smiled. He was aware that he had worn himself ragged during Severus' depression, permanently feeling inadequate, convinced that, if he just found the right potion, he could help his godfather. But in the end, it had been Harry, and whatever the other wizard had done, he would not put it in question, mainly since it had worked.
As you can see, we are still celebrating the Winter Solstice. Since this is a time of prayer, I looked up ancient ones and found a Celtic Sunrise-Prayer I liked very much. However, since it was not exactly what I wanted, I took the liberty to adjust it to my needs. I mean no offence and you are warned in advance.
Harry tried to follow the ward's logic.
How could Potter be like that, the Slytherin wondered.
The next moment, all conversation ebbed away, as the Aurors turned towards the ebony-headed witch that had just entered. Her attentive brown eyes, seemed to lay all secrets bare, just by looking at a person. Though she wore blue jeans and a green shirt with a Greenpeace logo on it, nobody dared to even breathe, since she wore the robe of an Unspeakable on top of it all.
Somehow, for him, this room had become Sirius'. It was the place where Harry felt closest to him, and the fixtures started to reflect that. Starting with the deep red carpet, to the light-golden drapes that gave the salon a lighter and friendlier finish, to the cosy furniture that would suit the Gryffindor common room. The 'indignity' of the painting might be the reason for Walburga Black edging to the front of the frame, trying her hardest to ignore the ridiculous canines at her back.
"Yes, Malfoy."
“Yes, Sir,” Harry confirmed. “As I said: we are stuck anyway. So no matter what Mr Malfoy tells us, it’s a win-win situation.”
of December?"
"It means that the tree only needs itself to carry fruit. Usually, you would need two trees so the bees could carry pollen from one tree to the next."
"Nobody ever said so."
“Why should I?” The boy-who-lived sneered. “The reality of your family is grim enough without me making anything up.”
"What for?"
Sensing that this was no topic to pry, Lucius changed the subject, gesturing towards his notes. "These two piles contain all the research I have conducted and the transcripts of all conversations I have had with my client."
Everyone smiled at that, breaking the tension, so none of them took note that Ms Boleyn had spoken in singular, or that she had gazed at the Lady Malfoy, who sat on the exact opposite side of her at the table. Narcissa, however, merely lifted her own tea-cup and accepted the compliment with a content smile.
"Pregnancies? I thought Draco was an only child."
"No, you don't."
"Harry, … I, …" Severus felt pathetic, like an imbecile he had always accused the other to be but … there were simply no words to express the gratitude he felt.
Unceremoniously, Harry was pulled into the hug as well, while Andromeda explained the 'memory depiction' spell to the other Weasleys. By now she had a sizable collection of 'Harry on the Floor' pictures she was quite proud of.
--O-O--
Softly his friend scolded, "Because you wouldn't ask for help."
"Still, you managed to pop in and out without a problem?"
When he left the bathroom, only a towel around his waist to cover his nudity, the witch had studied him with clinical detachment. Draco had had to fight himself not to fidget. He had been aware of how he looked at the best of days. His body had nothing on the battle-hardened, muscular frame of Harry, for example. Still, he had tried to stand his ground. Even when the witch had vanished his towel, scrutinising him without any regard for propriety.
"Nothing personal."
With a sigh, the Lady Malfoy sank onto her sofa and shook her head. Lucius had not had it easy, as she was well aware of. The sole heir to the Malfoy name had been brought up by a domineering father, who had instilled in him the single conviction, that it ought to be his purpose in life, to make their family-name great. At Abraxas' side had stood a weak and easily frightened wife, who had not dared to speak up for anything, least of all her son. Narcissa's mother in law had been the perfect pureblood wife for the Malfoy Patriarch. Poised, well mannered, educated beyond what was expected in her time and breathtakingly beautiful. However, the current Lady Malfoy had never been able to muster even the slightest bit of respect for her. Even during her and Lucius' engagement, she had made sure that the future Lord Malfoy was aware that she would
Casting some cleaning charms, before covering Snape with a fresh blanket, Emilia inquired, "That depends on how much blood you have taken from him."
"I do."
--O-O--
Gesturing towards the staircase that led down into the vast Ministry ballroom, the pureblood explained, "Because Auror Potter has just entered, boy-toy included."
"Draco, breathe!" Harry ordered, reaching over to encircle the blond's wrist in a steel grip. "First, your mother is not in any kind of trouble. Nor are you. Second, you are not violating the terms of your house-arrest. I re-negotiated them when you moved in with me. And third," he added, noticing the vice-grip Draco had on his wand. "You were unarmed when they took you in. So nowhere in your file is your wand even mentioned. As long as you don't wave it in everybody's face, you should be fine."
Within twenty minutes, Kreacher had lined up a crate, and though most potions and books were conveniently labelled, Harry did not believe for one second, that every vial contained what the markings suggested. He would need a mass of school-owls to transport everything to London. Fortunately, since the feast and celebration were over, the owls might be free. Hopefully, Professor McGonagall would give her permission.
"He was my Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in third year. And curling up after finding me did not seem to be on his agenda. Though, in his defence, it was a rather stressful night."
Returning to the room, the young wizard hovered for a moment, clearly unsure of how to proceed. Swallowing his pride, Severus allowed himself a scathing remark, "This can hardly be the first time you have assisted me in the cleaning process." Not that this was a particularly comforting thought for Potter's spawn to have seen him naked … all of him, even the tattoo on his lower arm.
"Off! Get off of me you annoying little pixies! Go, find Ron and ask what's for dessert."
Not wanting to go into his vassal's betrothal contracts, Harry shook his head. "But friendship … that's really the best you can hope for?"
--O-O--
Snap.
Gazing down at their son with so much tenderness and love, his parents assured him, "We love you too."
"Harry changing in the middle of Ron's living-room."
Hermione and Lucius were left alone well until mid-morning. The pregnant witch had received a nutritious, well-balanced breakfast with ham and eggs on toast and a small fruit-plate. After some experimenting, the prisoners had discovered that, while Lucius could not take anything from her, Hermione was perfectly able to share his porridge. So they had spiced up the tasteless pulp with some fruit and had evenly distributed every dish between them. Around ten, the wizard was roughly dragged from the cell. When Hermione tried to help him, she received a backhanded for the attempt; and though she could hear one of the wizards reprimanding the witch for doing so, her cheek still stung.
Well, that was another can of worms Emilia seemed not prepared to open. Hence, she merely encouraged her patient, "If you judge it safe and Mr Malfoy here has tested it already, I see no harm."
So here they were, worrying for their best friend, who had to unroll his past to make his parents' portrait understand his present.
Interrupting the child, his godfather gently gripped his chin and kissed his forehead, tenderly assuring him, "I think it's a lovely gesture. Now give it to him and say good−night."
"Celtic."
"Potter, shut up and prepare the circle," Severus interrupted the young man's rambling. At Neville's grin, he merely winked, not letting go of his stern expression, even as he dressed down. Snape was a little surprised when Weasley took off his belt and put it in the middle of the circle, followed by Narcissa's bracelet and a small gardening knife the Potion Master had seen sheathed at Neville's wrist at all times. As understanding dawned, he took off his cuff and added it to the pile.
Hissing at Narcissa, Griphook replied, "The Potter family vault contains five other wands, including those of your parents."
"Is that how you feel about Astoria? Do you hate her?"
Accepting the compliment, Harry replied evenly, "Thank you." Before leaving the Malfoys for some much-needed quiet time.
"Love," his mother coaxed, "please, just tell us."
The worst dreams his twisted mind came up with were of Draco still and composed, dressed all in black and polished to a shine. He never said anything, never acted out, never took the initiative. He merely stood beside the Dark Lord's chair, following his every whim. Even the simplest of gestures were correctly interpreted, and hissed orders - hearing the snake-language still drove shivers down Lucius' back - fulfilled swiftly and accurately. It seemed not to matter if the order in question was the demand for more wine, a meal or a curse being thrown at one of the Dark Lord's followers that sat the table. In these dreams, Lucius sat frozen in his chair, too far down the table to understand what Lord and servant were talking about. Still, he was close enough to notice the adoring look in his son's eyes, whenever his gaze fell on the hooded figure by his side. When Narcissa spoke up unexpectedly, his heart stopped. The Dark Lord did not take well to backtalk, and Lucius knew, without the shadow of a doubt, that his son would never raise his wand against his own mother. That night, however, he was proven wrong. At a quiet hiss from the Dark Lord, Draco lifted his wand and whispered, "Crucio." Lucius could see his wife arched up from her chair in agony, though no sound escaped her lips. When he gazed up at the table, wordlessly pleading with the terrifying couple to stop this, his son's wand wandered from his wife to himself. In a cold voice, Draco proclaimed, "This is all your fault. I tried to do what was best for our family. Tried to keep the two of you safe. But there was only one way. And now, we all have to live with the consequences." And when the cloaked figure finally turned towards Lucius, his hood fell away, and the eyes that met his were not blood-red, like the ones he had known all his life. They were emerald green and filled with unholy glee.
"Are you alright?" Draco asked concerned.
"And what did she expect in return?"
Then the raven-haired instructed, "Don't let go. I know it will feel like pins and needles, but I need a complete circle for this to work."
"No …
lied to Draco, no matter how gruesome the details. However, it was mind-numbingly terrifying to be chained to an ancient monolith, with a menacing lunatic waving a knife right beside him. Only Severus' steady hand, around Draco's wrist, had him breathe, instead of letting the terror overwhelm him.
So, it was nearly eleven, before they all gathered around the Christmas tree, to hand out the presents. Of course, the children had to come first, and there were a lot of screams and overjoyed exclamations to be heard. But once the little ones were out of the way, the adults could turn to their own gift-giving. It had been agreed upon, that everyone would receive but one gift. Not all Weasleys were that well off, so the money spent had to be limited somehow.
Briefly looking at Harry, Narcissa indicated a bow. "Of course, Mr Manson, this way, please." She would have a lot of explaining to do once Lucius returned from the Ministry. Not only why she had given access to their precarious books, but also why their home was - once again - invaded by wizards from all corners of the Kingdom. Somehow, she imagined that her husband would share her bewilderment of how
Involuntarily, Neville whined, "Harry! This is
So, Harry told them: about the Triwizard Tournament, and everything around it, concluding, "That's why I gave my winnings away. After everything that had happened, I could not stomach to even look at the money. Fred and George, however, they were such amazing people. I am sure you would have loved them. They were so much like the Marauders, just without the maliciousness. They even found your map in Filch's office, first year. They gave it to me a few years later."
"And you have a problem with that, why? My birthday is in September, my parents and I had time to come to terms with me being a witch. An entire year in fact. But what about people like you? Children with birthdays near September 1
Now all of you can enjoy the fruits of our hard work.
"Not tonight, love," the young wizard stabilised her since she was known to topple right down. "Kreacher, I want you to teach Emerald the recipe for 'Remus Special'. But double the milk, please."
"But that's the thing, Draco, I was! Ever since entering our world, I was being told over and over again that it was my destiny to kill a man so that countless others could live. Dumbledore assured me that it was all for 'The Greater Good' and I believed him! I spent a year of my life hunting down every last piece of Tom Riddle's soul, so I could finish him off. And not even after he had died did I ever ask myself if it had been the right thing to do. So, I am not really the right person to ask. Because if I accept that it is right to kill one wizard so hundreds, maybe thousands can live, where do I draw the line? Is one life worth less than a thousand, than a hundred, than ten? You decided that Astoria's life was worth more than Rosier's and I think that I am the wrong person to tell you that that was a mistake."
"But not necessarily with each other?" Harry said. Slowly … oh so slowly catching up.
"Shut up, Potter," the blond yawned. "It's after two, and you really can't afford to lose any more beauty sleep."
Rolling his eyes at the tease, the young Auror returned to his case−files.
"Yes, Neville."
"Big time!" Neville beamed. "And you will pay your debts in full, my friend. Mostly in hot, caffeinated drinks but partially in baked goods. Luna requested a batch of your carrot−cream−cheese−muffins, and what the Lady of my heart wants, she will get."
"You're good," the wizard chuckled, sheathing Excalibur before offering a bow, "Christopher Pendragon, at your service, Lady Malfoy. Though I feel the need to inform you that I do have siblings. So, I'm not the
Awed, the three wizards starred at the vial the blond had placed in the middle of his granite table before Ron exploded.
Laughing, the muggle-born witch caressed her daughter's head and confirmed. "That they do. Now, do you want to help us prepare the feast?"
"Ecstatic," the other deadpanned.
1 cup warmed with ¼ ounce honey to every meal.
"No, I am offering a partnership where we both get what we want. You can do your duties to your family, and I have the freedom to be heard and to choose my own fate."
Laughing, shaking his head, the younger wizard returned to his preparations for the New Year's dinner. "Do not think that I don't appreciate you trying, Lucius, because I do. But you will have to forgive me for saying: None of your bloody business! What goes on between Draco and me stays between the two of us. But rest assured, that his magic is in no way restricted. If I insult him and he desires to hex off my bollocks, nothing will keep him from doing exactly that."
"Despise you."
The elf seemed to waver a little at that command, but in the end, bowed and vanished. At the raven-haired's inviting gesture, the Lady sat down on the sofa and for a few moments, neither said a word. After a while, Harry took a deep breath, looking at his guest. “I am sorry I shouted at you. That was rude and uncalled for. I apologise. In my defence, this place is kind of personal. Even my friends know better than to come in here.”
When Lucius did not reply, Harry rubbed his head, tussling his already unruly hair. "It's what He would have done."
--O-O--
A finger wiggled out and pointed towards a corner.
George had always been absurdly grateful for Harry yelling at Molly and Arthur during their second Christmas after The Battle. The burrow had been unbearably suffocating for George, everybody treating him like glass whenever there was even a hint of his missing twin. Harry had watched him, all of them, until the raven-haired had lost his temper around midnight.
"You're welcome," Draco rose from where he had been crouched down beside her. "Now excuse me, please. Considering how long Potter seems to take, he might as well be baking our biscuits from scratch. I just want to make sure that he won't burn down the kitchen in his sleep-deprived state."
Swallowing visibly, the young Auror looked from one Slytherin to the other. "You know that I'm doing my best to protect you. But you can't just discuss …
"It's been nearly two months, but we still have no clue as to how to find them. Robarts will slim this team down soon, if we can't produce any leads."
Storing the disk in the folds of her robes, Hermione promised, "I will show you next time. But now let us collect the Lady Malfoy and get you to Grimmauld Place. I have to write a report on the verdict and would not mind returning home before ten p.m. for a change."
"I need a lab," Severus informed him with forced calmth. "I need a proper potion's lab. The setup in my room won't do."
"We did," Harry confirmed. "Draco brewed the potion, and I slipped it into your glass."
In his desperation, he had not even noticed that the tray with his hot chocolate had fallen victim to his uncoordinated movements. All he knew was that he had to make Harry see what a snake Lucius Malfoy was and that he could never,
Three-quarters of an hour later found him sitting in the kitchen, staring into his third cup of coffee. Somehow, the caffeinated drink did nothing to invigorate him. Could coffee expire … or lose its potency? When Harry heard the front door, he scrambled out of his seat to intercept Emilia, before the medi-witch could even approach the stairs.
After studying the other, the older wizard tilted his head once again.
"What may Isa be doing for you, Miss?"
When Draco entered the dining room, he found it cold and empty. After a little exploration, he spotted Potter in the kitchen, staring bleary-eyed into a cup of coffee.
Harry, however, seemed unbothered by his sharp tone since he only shrugged, "This is the first time you are awake." Then he pulled out his wand and before his ex-professor could ask his intentions, he cast a feather-light charm. With a soft smile, the young man then stepped up to the bed and offered a hand. "Can you sit up?" And to Severus' surprise, he found that he could.
Following that explanation with great interest, Neville still gave food for thought. "But house-elves are living things."
Though his partner appeared doubtful, after a moment, he nodded. "Alright, we'll talk tomorrow."
Thinking about it for a moment, the blond then tilted his head. "Sensible advice, indeed."
"No."
Blushing, Harry lowered his eyes at the unexpected compliment. "Thank you, Sir."
After giving his pre-functioned knock, he slipped into the room and claimed the armchair. He looked out of the window to compose himself because it hurt too much to see his godfather lying in bed, unresponsive and not because he had to because of a coma, but because he chose to not react. The grey weather of mid-day February seemed to reflect his mood. Forcing himself to take an even breath, the pureblood started, "Since we have finished 'The Warlock's Hairy Heart' yesterday, let's continue with 'Babbity Rabbity and the Crackling Stump'."
"Because I am talking to my best friend; more than you are talking to the brother you spend time with ten hours a day."
Since Malfoy seemed ready to topple over, Harry invited him into the living room and once the blond had received a strengthening cup of tea and Harry had donned sweats and a long shirt over his tread-bare sleeping pants, he demanded to know, “Alright, what do you need?”
Trading a smile, the young wizard asked, "Do you need anything? I mean anything I can get for you?"
Aware of Weasley's watchful eyes, Lucius followed Hermione's unspoken invitation and sat down in the chair facing hers. Gratefully he accepted the cup of tea she offered, then tried to recall the interrogations. "They consider muggles barely one step up from animals … dogs, in this case apparently." Instinctively, he glanced towards Inari who lay curled up under Harry's desk, miserably. It was obvious that the familiar knew that her wizard was in danger. Shaking himself, he continued, "They are convinced that their goddess is pleased with the numerous sacrifices they have made. But they want to go one step further. Seven circles with seven sacrifices at a place of ancient power, and one to tie it all together, at the centre. They are convinced that the witch or wizard most worthy from each circle will receive their goddess blessing. The last seven, planning on conducting a curse too - I quote - 'Rid Britannia of all those who are unworthy' - end quote. I have no idea about the nature of the curse or where the ritual is supposed to take place, only that I was supposed to be the one to tie all of the other sacrifices together."
"Go on," Ginny encouraged, "Try them on!"
Shrugging, the other tousled his unruly hair. "Hidden passages, hidden rooms, … everything concealed could only ever be accessed by those who knew how. No elaborate spell-work was ever needed."
Harry whistled under his breath. The goblin, however, continued unimpressed. "We have a purpose, benefactor, … all done. The final point is the rent." He turned towards the raven-haired, who was negotiating on Lucius' behalf. "Usually, for a proper potion lab, you can demand around three to nine sickles per square-foot; depending of course on the equipment and the general state of the object."
While Neville started his casting, Harry and Severus watched him avidly. As did Draco, who had come out of the library after hearing his name hollered. So, none of the wizards noticed the person who had watched Grimmauld Place all evening, pulling out a wand, casting a spell on their own.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He baulked before entering his parents' personal vault."
Leaning back in a chair taking comfort in studying the tapestry that held not only his godfather's name that now held his own as well, Harry closed his eyes and admitted quietly, "I need to."
"Of course."
Cornered, looking at the damning smoke in confusion, the witch gestured behind herself. "In the kitchen, but I only have a wine-cellar, and … there is just a wine cellar down there."
Leaning against the table beside Charles to study the information available, those who had been sent to Westminster Abbey and the British Library still had to come through, Harry stole a biscuit and pondered, "When you update a book, is there only information added or removed as well?"
"Because, …" the young wizard replied hoarsely, "because one of Luna's horses is ill and she's afraid the mare has to be put down. And I … I thought of ways to … to slow down the heart without … the beast knowing. People feel good when they take Belladonna, it's …"
Rolling his eyes, the Potion Master continued, "Are you aware that very few marriage contracts contain a fidelity clause?"
Then the pure-blood, who had spent his entire Hogwarts career antagonizing this boy to get any kind of reaction, finally decided to take what he wanted, consequences be damned. So, he pulled Harry close and kissed him.
Sinking down in his chair, hiding his face in a giggly Teddy's paling hair, who was clinging to him like a limpet as to not slide to the floor, Harry growled, "You are enjoying this."
Looking at the Auror, the Inquisitor asked snappishly, "So you are telling me that we are helpless until Astoria is delivered to St. Mungos?"
"What if I do?" Harry challenged.
At the continuous encouragement of his family, the raven-haired sighed and finally shimmied out of his shoes and trousers, trading them for the dragon-hide garments. Once he closed the zipper of the jacket, he felt protective magic settle around him like a hug. Caressing the fabric, admiring his reflection, Harry took half a step back, when Hermione drew her wand on him. Instantly raising his hands, he looked at her questioningly.
Looking thoughtful, Ron brushed over a heap of ancient coins that filled a chest on a sideboard, "You know, once upon a time, I would have wanted to take you up on that offer. Pretty much until the Department of Mysteries, I considered the monetary support your parents had left you, your greatest asset. But with the prophecy and Sirius … I'm sorry that it took me so long to understand."
"He rarely does, since I'm not sleeping with him any longer." Harry rose as well.
The exasperated voice that responded belonged to Robarts. "We double-checked every document in our vault, and while the oath your father swore to Auror Potter has been filed, the same cannot be said about your alleged pledge of servitude. While I personally would give your family the benefit of the doubt, especially considering how helpful your father was with the Lostrife-case, this is out of my hands. You will return to the Manor, Mr Malfoy, and only after my Auror has confirmed and filed your alleged vow, will you be given leave to return to Grimmauld Place."
The next morning, Ron and Hermione woke to a babbling Rose, who shared her nightly adventures. Since their wards had not alerted them to any intruders, both brushed the story off as their child's somewhat over-active imagination. That comforting thought lasted until they reached the kitchen and found a small cauldron filled with a minty-spicy-smelling mixture and a note attached to it.
>For Draco, from Molly and family<
"No, thanks, I'm good."
"Narcissa?"
"How much longer? " Harry inquired at their backs when they had a brief pause.
Reluctantly, the Lord confirmed. "You are right. I don't understand." And really, he hated not understanding, especially the one thing he had apparently done right.
"I'll take a shower now and then go to bed." George informed him before retreating into the bedroom.
Groaning, the raven-haired hid his face behind his pulled-up knees. "You're enjoying this far too much. I hate you!" He mumbled into his legs.
"You still don't get it, gorgeous." Cynthia Belfast chuckled when the young Auror's cheeks flared up. "Christopher did not abduct us. He explained what he wanted to achieve and then gave us the time-turner so we could convince ourselves to come along. No 'late night' conversations, no 'suspicious men' loitering around. I caught myself on the evening of my latest exhibition. Tomas picked himself up at the cafeteria at the University. Michael interrupted himself when going out for Sunday Roast and Irma found herself in the Restricted Section and then simply left Hogwarts via the Hogshead."
Whipping around, Lucius froze at the very sight of him, breathing out a disbelieving, "Severus …"
"You were never one for prayers, where you?"
At Neville's encouraging nod, Luna opened the present, and her eyes began to shine. On dark blue velvet lay a necklace of white silver, adorned with countless, little stars that dangled from the chain-links. It would be far too excessive for the likes of Andromeda, Narcissa or Molly. For Luna, however, the shimmering jewellery was perfect and would suit her festive attires perfectly.
"The day you took my wand … after you've escaped," Draco tried to explain in the barest whisper, "… he came … You-Know-Who came and he …"
He wasn't sure if anybody else noticed the strangled noise of distress, Draco emitted, but upon closer inspection, he noticed that the blond looked about as bad as he felt. His complexion was so pale it could not be distinguished from the walls and his sunken−in eyes had circles so dark they looked painted on. Meeting his concerned glance, Draco offered more water at once, much to Harry's relief, but resolutely avoided his eyes.
"Of course. This way, please."
"William Weasley, he works for Gringotts as a curse−breaker. We lived with him and Fleur for a while during … well, before Victoire was born. If he's free, he might help us."
"Okay?" The blond suggested weakly.
Looking after the blond, Kingsley asked incredulously, "Did Mr Malfoy just scold a fox?"
"Please, tell me again why we are using the Leaky Cauldron to reach Diagon Alley?" Narcissa inquired, eyeing the water-like cape Harry held out for her.
Leaving through the research to take notes, Harry wanted to know, "Would that not make the potion more volatile?"
"You would manage. You always do." The young witch assured him with a smile and held on tight for a moment before ushering him out of the door. "Now go, Neville is certainly already bouncing on his toes."
The moment Sandorn had taunted her before fleeing the scene, blaming the 'near' divulging of secrets on Lucius Malfoy, she had been confused.
"Not a reason not to care for one's money."
"I will thank you." There had to be a way to make use of this … anomaly. Something was happening, beyond a sadistic witch as head of the house. Draco just had to find out what. Eating the first few bites, the pureblood realised how hungry he actually was. Between the main dish and dessert, he glanced at the corner, were the cufflinks were hidden. They were of the utmost importance to Harry. Draco was of utmost importance to Harry. And if there had only ever been one thing the blond had learned about their 'Saviour' during their reformative years at Hogwarts, then that Harry Potter would do anything for the people that were important to him; even die so they could live. Hence, there was only one thing he had to do right now: hold out until his friend came for him. For they had become friends. No doubt about that. That stupid Auror would come for him. Hopefully soon.
"Are you sure that's a good idea, mate?" Ron sipped his beer, playing with Hermione's locks while she was leaning against him.
"Brewing."
"How could a bunch of doctors … healers do better than an antidote brewed especially for him?" Harry protested, obviously having repeated himself as well. "Please, Andromeda, trust me. There is no place in all of Britain where he will receive better care than here!"
Holding out his left wrist, Severus demanded to know, "If I took this off and put it on Draco, would it protect him as it would me?"
"But why?" Charles spoke up, looking from one 'missing person' to the next. "What could be so important to necessitate all this?"
Stepping up to the bed, Harry studied the comatose patient for a while, before sharing quietly, "I'll try to come back tomorrow, and you can help me plan the lab. We have to be careful, however, not to draw too much attention. If the press notices me equipping a potions lab at Grimmauld Place, while still working full-time, they will have Draco cooking up poisons, love potions and what-not in a day. The rumours of what he is doing in my house are preposterous enough as it is.
"Oh, for Merlin's sake," the blond huffed exasperated, grabbing the small fox at the scruff of its neck. "Charles, if you could assist me, please."
With a smile, Molly continued:
Shrugging Luna replied, "It's a good arrangement. They help and receive food and shelter in exchange. The farmers around here cherish them. They think they are magic."
Shaking his head, as if to clear his mind, the raven-haired mumbled, "Tell me about it. For a moment, I felt like I was one with the house."
Somewhat confused, the wizard reached for the floo-pot as the girl bounded back into the room. "You are fast. I lost it just now. I wanted to show it to mummy and daddy. But … but if you are here, I guess that's okay." She held out her tooth. Yet, before the man could react, she closed her tiny fist around it. "Wait a minute! Where are your wings? Fairies need wings."
Guiltily, the boy snapped his mouth shut.
Heading towards the cafeteria for a snack, Pince suggested, "Lady Malfoy is still wearing her bracelet, and as long as one of us stays with her, it should not activate. Maybe you could take her to Gringotts?"
Taking a steeling breath, Lucius turned. His face was an impenetrable mask when he explained. "Our society, the real wizarding society is slowly dying. Our obsession with blood-purity has weakened our bloodlines. Bellatrix came from an excellent family, but inbreeding has weakened her mind." Looking at his wife apologetic, he continued. "Narcissa and I tried for an heir several times. When Draco was born, we had nearly given up hope. Andromeda was the only Black who carried an offspring with exceptional powers, simply because she bonded with a muggle-born. Yet Nymphadora was never educated in our ways. No matter her exceptional abilities, our traditions were lost on her." With a sigh, Lucius turned towards the window again. "That's what he wanted to change."
For the next few minutes, the raven-haired traded places with his colleagues, until he mirrored his partner's position at the other edge of the site. "Be prepared to cast a Patronus," he advised his colleagues as he passed them.
Today, the young man discovered, was different. Though Draco and Severus had informed him that they would spend their weekend at the Manor to oversee an experiment, the crushing sense of loneliness was missing. Harry knew that everyone was cared for, so the 'Saviour' could simply take the day off. After some contemplation, he chose his office as a place of relaxation, since it overlooked the garden, making it the brightest room in the entire house. Upon entering, he even opened the window-frames that protected the necklace collection Teddy had gifted him over the years, making the stones shimmer and shine like the greatest treasures.
All of a sudden, Snape had been back in the Dark Lord's stronghold, trapped by conjured vines, about to be tortured for an imagined slight. Panic had made it hard for him to breathe, tugging at the wooden appliances he had scratched his skin raw.
--O-O--
side of the story published first thing tomorrow."
"You need blood replenishing potions, nutritious potions and maybe a muscle strengthener."
Frowning, Harry probed, "You are not interested in children?" Her assessment had sounded rather clinical.
They did not like it, looking at their friend with worry; still, they mumbled, "Yes, Professor,"
From the side came a nasty sneer, "Clearly her Slytherin-whore finally lost it. Maybe the pressure of maintaining a mask all day became too much for him. He's so used to betray other people's secrets; it might have been an involuntary reaction. Honestly, gentlemen, her Silencio was practically self-defence." With a visible effort of not spitting at the kneeling Slytherin, Stephen Sandorn passed them by and vanished into the gaping crowd.
"So, Lucius …" Harry pondered.
"I know! Remember, I needed nearly seven months to clean my own house."
"Yes, you are, Draco," Harry interrupted gently. "You are staying here because you like Grimmauld Place better than the Manor. You have your own lab, and with Inari and Severus around, you feel comfortable … safe even. But that does not mean that you do not genuinely like my company. I see all the little things you do. Things that exceed your vow of servitude by far. That's friendship. It does not have to be selfless for it to be true."
--O-O--
"Well," the redhead grinned lecherously, helping himself to some toast and jam. "Let's just say Rose slept in for once and Hermione and I made good use of our time."
"Draco," Harry pushed up to his elbow, inquiring cautiously. "What are you saying?"
"Most likely not."
Grumbling tiredly under his breath, their patient mumbled, "I don't need a keeper, you know?"
"Yes," the other wizard snapped. "One of them got kidnapped, and the other has a 'saving the whole world' complex! I could hardly trust them to resolve this situation on their own."
This is NOT the beginning of a prank war. But I think Lucius will look lovely with his died hair :).
"What is 'Chilli'?"
Looking at the young man by her side, Irma Pince chuckled, "I can imagine Severus being interested in Christopher. Even though he had never shown interest in the same sex. He was always drawn to intelligence above all else. And Chris is as smart as they come. However, he's also incredibly arrogant, convinced of his own superiority in his field of expertise and self-confident he borders on being rude."
"I …," the young man sighed, reluctantly meeting the other's eyes. "With their souls connected to the picture … it's hard to explain. Yes, I can talk to them, and yes, they are as close to my parents as I can probably get, but …"
"The Master of Death, according to the tale," Lily finished. Apparently, she was not as oblivious as the two wizards had assumed. At James' surprised look, she shrugged. "I do read Harry bed-time-stories. The Tales of Beedle the Bard were one of the presents we have received upon his birth. I think Alice gave it to him."
"We had gnomes?" Lucius asked surprised because until now the Manor had never had to deal with such pests.
Popping into existence right next to him, startling the overly tired wizard, the elf barked, "Master wants to lower his voice. Emerald is still asleep."
Rolling his eyes, as if he had expected nothing less, the man composed a note and sent it on its way. "One member of your team, Pince, stays glued to her side, no matter when, no matter where. Even if she decides to use the Ladies' room, one Auror accompanies her! Have I made myself clear?"
"I …"
Smiling softly, James turned back around. "My mum found it at a flea-market in Glasgow. There are warming charms woven into the fabric for extra comfort." Then he shook his head. "You're avoiding the topic. What do you mean, Severus sent you to your death?!"
"To be completely honest, Harry, I thought that I had trained you better. But if you want, we can brainstorm ideas to breach that particular topic in a socially acceptable way."
"Easy for you to say," Neville mumbled. "You deal with this stuff every day. If we do this wrong, we hurt Harry further."
Throwing one of the carrot-sticks at Ron, Hermione had put out as snacks, Harry grinned, "If I have to suffer, so do you! You are one third of the 'golden trio' after all."
"Yea, I get that."
"Charles, I thought fatherhood would become easier after the first time. However, I was not prepared to deal with a boy who filled our house with exotic bugs, wounded birds and - on one memorable occasion - a wolf-pup with a broken paw. I thank Merlin every day that you have found your place in life, where your compassion and your thirst for adventure are equally satisfied. The cardinal point of the ever-changing flame shall be yours tonight."
Pulling the young man in, reversing their positions from the beginning of the evening, George rubbed the younger man's back soothingly. "I know, Harry. We have talked about this, remember? I know you are not to blame. It was Fred's and my decision to be there, to fight by your side because frankly, anything else was out of the question."
"Malfoy," Harry shot back, prompting the blond to groan.
Now, more than three years later, Grimmauld Place was warm, almost homey, thanks to the house elf, who had helped with any restorations Harry had decided upon but had had no clue of how to achieve. Still, some days the dark thoughts and spells generations of Blacks had cast in this place seemed to permeate the very walls, making it hard for Harry to relax. Entering the expanded kitchen – nearly every room in the house had gained a few square feet with him imploring wizarding space upon them – he demanded to know, “How is he?”
--O-O--
His godfather had barely been able to explain the essentials mere hours ago. Though Draco understood that he was about to be rescued, he was still terrified. A dozen witches and wizards had blown the door off its hinges and then barged into his room. They had not even bothered to explain, merely stunned him and apparated away. Draco had been close to a nervous breakdown when he had come around at Stonehenge, chained to a monolith, surrounded by people that had madness gleaming in their eyes. Then Severus had circled his wrist with his warm, dexterous fingers that had soothed aches and demonstrated the most amazing potions throughout his entire childhood. So, Draco was still afraid, but holding on to his godfather. He was waiting for an opening to slip away, if he found a way to get rid of these chains.
Holding the witch back before she could open the doors to her domain, Harry wanted to know, "The project … did you ask him why?"
As they settled on the couch, James walked into the picture of a temple, surrounded by water. Harry had bought that particular piece to brighten the room. Together with the pale-yellow wallpaper, it fitted quite nicely.
"You shared our plans?" Harry demanded to know, once Kingsley had left.
Losing his patience, Alexander Pince rose. "Professor Snape is dead. His funeral is public knowledge. Honestly, Longbottom, you're a nice guy, but if you continue wasting my time, I'll leave. I have better things to do, namely working on actual cases!"
Once the child was gone, he put his hands on Draco's shoulders. "Look, this is a muggle place. The chances of meeting someone who recognises us are slim to none. Also, Severus needs sap from a Dragon's Tree, and at Diagon Alley they were all out. If you are really not up for it, I can do it myself. But A) are you more skilled when it comes to potion ingredients, and B) …"
"Gods are a complicated matter. Until now, nobody has been able to prove or refute their existence conclusively. Most old families consider their house-gods a guiding influence. They believe that they provide protection and comfort."
"Renew us," was the answering plea from family and friends.
All three shook their head until Narcissa interrupted herself. "If you would be so kind, Miss Weasley, and fetch me some Essence of Echinacea? It boosts the immune system and since I expect Harry to thwart our attempts to keep him in bed, his body needs all the help it can get."
"How old were you, son?" His father had inquired softly.
A few hours of cleaning hooves and brushing manes, Xenophilius offered a hearty albeit late, lunch. Since the cylindric house did not provide enough room for so many guests, Harry and Luna charmed a sturdy carpet into a several square−feet cover for the ground and threw in all the pillows they could find. Though lunch contained stew and freshly baked bread on the floor, Narcissa, ever the lady, took off her boots before stepping onto the fabric. She took a bowl and a piece of bread with a charming smile. "It is very gracious of you to invite us to eat with you, Mister Lovegood. It smells delicious."
--O-O--
When the raven−haired noticed Draco turning around, he closed his eyes and breathed evenly. "No," he heard the blond admit before the door opened and closed.
The moment his father looked up in confusion, Potter pushed a button, and a flash went off. Fascinated, Draco watched the other wizard pull the black and white square the little machine had spit out, shaking it to dry the potion that coated the developing picture. The three Malfoys were still blinking dots from their visions when Harry gave a broad smile. "Lovely. That goes into my office.",
Harry wanted to reach out so badly; to pull Draco into a hug and promise that everything would be alright. That his life and family would be happy. But he could not guarantee that since nobody knew what the future would hold. All he could do was offer his unconditional support. "Then let's find a way to make it worth her while. The happier the witch is, the happier the wizards are."
Putting down his breakfast, cleaning himself with the napkins Harry always brought in abundance, the young Auror studied his partner before bringing a certain fact to attention. "You are aware that her target was Draco and not you."
"No," Lucius admitted, "but not unheard of. Unofficially, of course."
From their point of view, the two wizards could see a pure excitement lighting up the girl's face before she turned slowly. "As have I," she replied evenly, before she broke out in delighted giggles, reaching for Teddy's hand, pulling him along. "Come on! Let's watch grandpa play with the crayons!"
Glancing at his wizard as if he was an imbecile, Kreacher stated with forced patience, "Master Harry has the young Master Draco study ancient potions recipes, especially anti-venoms. The Potion Master's library is the best place to look for an antidote. Or at least a recipe. Kreacher is an old house-elf, he has learned to think without having to snoop!"
Snapping his mouth shut, Draco reminded himself that Luna Lovegood was a Ravenclaw. It was too easy to underestimate her, with her forgiving nature and natural smiles. Still, underestimating someone's intelligence was dangerous. Draco had thought himself to have learned that particular lesson. Apparently, not all lectures of the war had stuck.
Thomas Manson, an elderly wizard from Manchester, who wore a green jumper with elbow-patches - quite the professor type - handed over a steaming cup of tea before suggesting, "Maybe introductions are in order?"
Raising his hands placatingly, the redhead defended himself, "I had no way of knowing that the desk had an underbody of steel. That increased the density of the object."
"Fortunate," the Potion Master commented, accepting the writing tools. After a few hesitant swirls, he brightened. With this whiteboard, he would be able to practise to his heart's content without anybody seeing his failed tries. "Thank you, Harry." Then he gestured at the box.
"Thank you, Auror Leewood."
"That's easy," Harry grinned, "but when I do it, it always tastes off. Ron is much better with … wait a minute! Are you implying that Jesus was a wizard?" Laughing out loud, the raven-haired shook his head. "I would so love to discuss that idea with Aunt Petunia."
The Aurors exchanged uncomfortable looks, but chose not to comment, as Harry and Ron approached the table. "Alright," Harry sighed, "What do we actually know, beyond them being alright for now?"
Clenching his fists, Harry growled, "If Hermione and Lucius were with her, chances are that Draco is with the Children of Hecate."
"I have no clue whatsoever, which invitations to accept and which are safe to decline!" Harry groaned, throwing a bunch of letters on his desk. In the last few weeks, his office at Grimmauld Place had been redecorated. Where once a single desk had taken up the majority of the place, another, smaller one, had been added at the side. Most days Narcissa sat there for a few hours managing Harry's social calendar.
--O-O--
"I woke. Now, please answer the question. How often did you inhale the pollen of this plant!"
"Well remember the …bat - the last time we saw him fight, I would say that's a dangerous thing to forget, Ron."
"The scar … by Merlin." Lucius sagged back into his chair.
Feasts were where Ron could shine. He enjoyed thinking up new recipes, finding the ingredients and surprising his family with the spoils of his efforts. The young wizard was thriving in the kitchen. Yet nothing compared to the joy he displayed when his family actually enjoyed his efforts and made their pleasure known.
Dejected the man stepped back, raising his hands in surrender. For a minute, both hovered in suspension, Lucius barely dared to breathe, before Harry hissed, "Get out of my sight!" Then the man fled.
Rolling his eyes, the young Auror grinned, "By putting us all in a food coma, followed by a 'harmless' interrogation that would put the Spanish Inquisition to shame."
"As a spouse or as a friend?"
--O-O--
Embarrassed by the praise, Draco explained, "It's just hot apple−juice with a few spices thrown in for effect. Sev…" he cleared his throat against the sudden blockage, before he continued, "Severus made it for me when I was little."
It hadn't been a poison.
young man, the older wizard stated, "You have known that for fifteen years. But instead of lamenting unchangeable facts of life, your energy would be better invested in thinking about what Mrs Granger-Weasley could do and how to best support that."
"We need more blood," Draco informed him, when Harry entered the attic around four in the afternoon, with some snacks and more coffee. Hermione had left two hours earlier, to pick up Rose from Bill and Fleur.
Looking at her husband, who sank down at the small table, attempting to turn on the wireless that stood there, Hermine rubbed her hands over her trousers. "Hikers found it. About a year ago. Fortunately, they were wizards. One of my notebooks lay on the table. I … you know I always write my name on the cover. They packed it up and sent it to me."
Draco's eyes became impossibly large when two old racing brooms passed him by. He could not even remember the last time he had mounted one, just for fun and games. These last few years the only brooms he had clutched, had been those for cleaning. The longing was so prominent on his face that Harry pushed a Nimbus 2001 at him almost instantly. "Here, get a feel for it."
"Like separate accommodations in general. Mother has her own room with an en-suite, an office, a salon and a dining room, albeit a small one."
Looking panicked all of a sudden, Snape replied, "That's hardly appropriate, Miss Granger!"
--O-O--
A few seconds later, a lamp appeared, hovering mid-air. They were halfway through their dinner when in the corner farthest from the door a four-poster-bed appeared. It was only slightly bigger than the beds at Gryffindor tower, but inspecting it, Hermione smiled, "This will certainly do."
Igniting only a few candles, Harry kneeled down before her, requesting gently, "Can you tell me who did that?"
use a bag of burgundy chintz!
"Your Harry and my Draco?" Lucius challenged with a raised eyebrow but then shook his head. "Fidelity is a private arrangement between couples. And as little as the Lady Greengrass will expect it from my son, as little will she offer it."
"But your mantelpiece is covered in plants!"
Rolling his eyes at the formal words, Harry held Draco back one last time, with a warning, "Malfoy!"
Taking a deep breath, Ron cut off his brother in a hoarse voice, "It's alright, Bill, thanks."
"And you're okay with all this?" The raven-haired turned towards Regina.
"So, you are reading my mind?" Harry accused, equal parts angry and worried.
sent out invitations.
Accepting coffee from Andromeda, Harry stated surprised, "The potion came from you?"
"But Luna said so!" Harry defended himself. "I remember her talking about this plant specifically!"
Tilting his head, the man took his leave, "Harley, Potter, have a good evening."
"I am!" Lightening his grip on the bond's wrist, the raven-haired started to rub soothing circles over the skin. "Don't worry, Draco. Not about something like this. Everything will be fine. But now I have to go." Harry was nearly out of the door when Draco threw him another vial.
Breathing easier, Lucius dropped his gaze. After countless minutes, Harry lowered his wand and stepped back. The pureblood, however, waited for a gesture before he rose from the floor.
--O-O--
"Harry!" When the other looked at him with wide eyes, Draco offered a comforting smile. "I know. You could never be so malicious as to take someone I care about from me. I just …" he shrugged. "I got lost in the memories of him … Voldemort … he took our entire family hostage, despite us being loyal supporters from the start. But you are not like that."
For the first time since he had been admitted, struggles instead of words woke Harry. People were fighting, at least two from the sound of it. He identified one agitated whisper as Draco's, who hissed, "I can't just leave! I'm taking care of him."
The blond clawed at his back, trembling all over. "If you're gone … if something happened to you …"
Chuckling, Harry hovered beside the older wizard, his eyes alight. "Then catch me if you can!" Then he leaned over the handle, bursting into the star-filled night.
With a faint tint of red on his cheeks, the brunet did not protest, merely tilted his head. He really had come a long way from the scared first year to the 'leader' he had become in seventh year, who had worked the Room of Requirement to keep everybody safe. He had stopped downplaying his achievements and accepted praise when it was due. Still, he would probably never feel entirely comfortable being the centre of attention. So, he glossed over the moment by pulling out his wand, casting, "Lumos!" When the light flared up, he gestured at a clearly ancient passage. "Let's go."
Interrupting the ever-occurring argument, Auror Pince interrupted their bickering, "So, Aunt Irma is safe back at Hogwarts. What about Welsh and Belfast?"
"But we said no presents!" Harry protested, "Just brunch tomorrow with you guys, Xenophilius and Augusta!"
He ought to know. There were still nights when Harry woke screaming, reaching out for a man who had fallen through the Veil nearly a decade ago. Nights where his own sobs woke him, because all he could see were Cedric's lifeless eyes, staring at the sky. Nights where he woke suffocating because Hermione's or Ron's tortured screams took his breath away. Some scars could fade, but they would never go away, not entirely.
When Astoria nodded somewhat reluctantly, Harry called out. He was grateful when Draco opened the door slowly to slip in. Obviously, both wizards were aware that any sudden movements could startle their late-night … or early-morning (depending on the view) guest.
Drawing closer, Robarts hissed, "Stop hurting yourself, Potter. You're of no use to us if you collapse."
Slowly turning around, Severus spotted the youngest Weasley-Granger hiding behind the doorframe of the living room. Narrowing his eyes, he replied on a whim, "No, I am a tooth fairy."
"Because you trust him."
"We would like to talk to your mistress," Neville demanded and cautiously followed the elf, as she bowed deep and scurried into the house.
A very,
“Are you sure?”
"It's not as if we are going anywhere, son." James soothed.
"But his journals are private." Draco continued the sentence. "They are like …"
The two young wizards traded a glance, before Neville offered, "And I would be alright with you watching me, Sir. If you are interested."
Gesturing at the new cage, Charlie inspected the construction, after an inviting gesture. "That's actually a good thing."
Banishing the ashes, Hermione nodded, "Yes, please."
"Draco," he whispered, slipping onto the bed, closer to the blond. "Draco, look at me, please." When the young man lifted his head anxiously, Harry gently reached for him and brushed away his tears. "I need you to do something for me." At a half−enthusiastic nod, he continued, "You know Occlumency, right? I need you to occlude and push me out with all your strength." Before Draco could work up another panic, when Harry pulled his wand, the raven−haired was already casting, "Legilimens!"
Stirring the Chilli one last time, Harry shook his head. "No, but you can help Lucius set the table, please. Oh, and be so kind to ask Kreacher for some red wine. Something a little on the sweet side would go splendidly with this. At least for you." He winked.
"That's not an easy task," Hermione pondered, looking from her friends to Draco and back at the two young men on either side of her. "But I might have an idea where to start."
"But you …"
"Wanna bet?" His partner challenged, grinning from ear to ear. He picked up a little bucket of gardening tools Harry kept in a cupboard near the back entrance, before opening the door. "Luna showed me this amazing trick where …"
"Good to know," Griphook replied, entering the bank.
"Fine," the younger wizard snapped, tilting his head, gesturing at his colleagues, "This is …"
Messing up his hair, Harry sagged against the house, admitting quietly, "We thought about calling a mind-healer. We have a good one at work. But who could we trust with a secret as big as Severus Snape?"
Nodding, he confirmed, "For the next seven days at least. You know where Lord Malfoy has been. We will need a meal he can stomach. Narcissa and Draco are little better off."
Tilting his head, Lucius challenged, "You'll never have a chance to outfly me on this model."
"Lord Malfoy," she curtsied before taking the unspoken invitation and claiming a chair in front of the fireplace. If she recognised the similarities to their last encounter, she did not let it show.
In fact, it appeared to be the Lady's turn to fight for composure, with only her strict upbringing enabling her to stay poised. A wand, one to call her own, to do magic with … Narcissa had been resigned to the idea of being wandless for the rest of her life. Purebloods could be quite vindictive if one of them did not live up to their expectations. But now … everything was changing before her very eyes. With her own wand, she might have had a chance. After she had paid her debt, maybe it would have been returned to her. But Draco had needed it, and she did not regret for a heartbeat to have handed it over to her son so he could defend himself during those crucial last days of the war. But now … the idea of being able to cast spells, even a simple Lumos … to be a real witch … it was overwhelming.
While Ron put a stasis charm on the dish, Hermione neatly arranged everything on a tray, and Harry requested, "Kreacher, could you please let Ron and Hermione in. Maybe they can help Draco."
"Right now!" Neville snapped. Sometimes this hero-worship his friends were receiving was a beautiful thing, something he liked to tease them with. But on days like today, it was just an inconvenience.
Encouraged by Harry's smile, Draco clasped the wood and was in the air a heartbeat later. He rose, dove, zig-zagged and pulled up a trail of freshly fallen snow, a few minutes later. Still, he returned to the ground when he noticed Teddy waving at him excitedly. The moment, he touched down, his little cousin was upon him.
Eyes going wide, Narcissa lifted her napkin to hide her cough when a piece of meat went down the wrong way. Harry addressed her with forced casualty, offering more wine, had her look unsure between the two young wizards. "Actually, I am not sure if this vintage is to my liking."
With a small smile, his partner tilted his head, "And we intend to find our missing librarians, safe and unharmed."
"Even without you being heads over heels in love with her?" Neville prodded.
Looking at his godfather, Draco received a conforming not, so he revealed, "It was Harry's.
Studying the young wizard, the Potion Master had pondered, "You are a parselmouth as well."
Turning towards the blond, he instructed, “You can see I’ve done the bare necessities with this house. It will be your job to renovate it and make a proper inventory. Since you are good with magical objects, I assume you will be able to figure out which ones to keep and which ones need to go. Work your way from the second floor down, the third one is off limits. My private rooms are there, and I don’t want you snooping around. Understood?”
"Yes, Professor," was the weak reply, before the young witch and wizards followed her into Snape's room.
"Potions?"
"I doubt this place even has dungeons," Lucius forced himself to reply. "Though, knowing Walburga Black, there might be some cells."
Pulling back, she had petted his head. "Very well, then. You have twenty-eight minutes. If I'm not pleased by your effort, we will pick up right here. Have I made myself clear?"
He was equally grateful and embarrassed to notice that the medi-witch seemed to have stepped around the bed, appearing behind the other woman. Snape felt ashamed because obviously, Poppy had seen his weakness, that even a simple task as turning his head needed nearly more strength than he had. At the same time, he was grateful, since that way he could keep an eye on both. Still, he was surprised to hear the usually so stern witch give in, "You are right, of course. But in my defence, if you show even the slightest bit of leniency with teenagers, they walk all over you!"
Death Eaters."
Studying the pureblood who looked dead on his feet, the young Auror sighed. "Tell me you don't want to talk about it. Hell, tell me it's none of my business, though, with the oath, we know that it is. But don't lie to me, Draco. And after everything we have been through, I think I deserve better."
On their way to Harry and Neville's office, Alexander Pince pulled the younger Auror aside and hissed, "I do not appreciate you going behind my back, Potter! You might be Robarts' favourite pet, but that does not make you in any way special! You are still a member of my team, and if you pull shit like this again, I will kick you, your partner and your precious purebloods out faster than you can say 'Protego'. Do we understand each other?"
Hesitant, Narcissa inquired, "Do you wish to excuse yourself?"
--O-O--
Smiling brilliantly at Harry, she pointed, "Tea!"
What a strange concept, both the conversation and having a master to watch out for his well−being. Lucius had followed the Dark Lord, had tried and succeeded in harming this young man. Yet, all that did not seem to matter anymore. How strange of a concept to bend his will to someone so quickly. A person who actually was concerned with not only his physical and mental well−being but that of his family as well.
Glimpsing through the door, Neville wondered, "Thought I heard you. Are you ready to leave?"
"He was your only constant," Draco summed up.
Harry and Draco were the last ones, who stood on the outside now. While the blond shivered slightly, making Harry step closer to him in wordless support, the raven-haired looked at his chosen family. His heart was overflowing with love for these people. For more than ten years now, they have stood by him. Not because he had been born their child, but because they had chosen to treat him as such.
Securing it around his wrist, Severus nodded and held out his arm. "Do it."
Instead of answering, Harry put down his scrolls and stepped to the window. "How much do you know about 'the prophecy'?"
Hermione clenched her jaw. It was horrible to see the once so proud Lord reduced to begging. Yet, she was well aware that Lucius knew of at least two cells they had investigated, so all was not lost. Still, she had to coax him out of the soft, warm bed, whispering comfortingly, "It's okay, Lucius. Harry is here. We just have to help him to find us. Let's take the blanket and relocate you to the other mattress."
"And lose others. Everything has a price. No life can be gained without another being lost. Fate always insists on getting its due."
"Teddy," Harry smiled, reaching for his godson's hands, brushing a coppery strand of hair out of his face. "She will love it, and you know that. Whatever you have chosen in the past, Vici has loved it. Now stop worrying and go find your cap."
Stepping in front of him, she pulled a riding crop from her bell-pouch. Caressing his face with it, she explained, "The flailing curse is used for punishment, the crop for training. I will teach you to love it, like every one of your predecessors. You will crave its bite and find fulfillment in our training sessions. But that comes later. Now, I will use it to help you correct your behavior. Ten lashes for every infraction that did not meet my expectations. Then I will give you a chance to try again. I admit that this makes for a rather lengthy training process. Yet if one expects perfection, some things simply need time." Caressing his face, the witch smiled. "As a fellow pureblood, I am sure you understand that nothing but perfection will do."
"Harry?" Hermione's quiet voice had pulled the boys out of their conversation. "I think you should see this."
Third … nothing.
For a heartbeat, they were both stuck in suspension, then she asked tentatively, "Are you alright?"
"Anything weird?" The brunet inquired curiously.
--O-O--
"Give me a chance," he whispered, closing his eyes, trying to reach out. "Please … I don't want to violate his privacy or steal what is his. It's just … his research is my last resort. If anybody ever has a chance to find an antivenom to Nagini's poison, it's him! He's not dead yet, but seeing him, lying motionless in his bed, day in and day out … having to move his body, having others put their hands on him so his muscles won't diminish completely. He would hate that! Hate how weak he has become. He has such a strong mind. I want to believe that … need to believe it, because what would have been the point of it all otherwise? He should be at St. Mungos or another clinic, but Poppy was right the day of the battle. Nobody would ever take care of him the way we can. Because nobody would ever understand the ordeals he had put himself through. He never had a chance at Hogwarts because all that counted for something in Slytherin were purity of blood and money. Nobody but Tom understood his ambitions, how he was determined to overcome is 'lacks' with hard work and ingenuity. And once Snape saw the Inner Circle for what it was … saw Voldemort for what he was … well, he had lost his chance with them too."
"Since the two of you are our latest additions with a … shall we say 'intimate' knowledge of the castle, we need you. You, in particular, Longbottom, since you managed to keep yourself and a whole bunch of students safe in your seventh year."
Ignoring the snickering around him, Harry waved his elf away. "Alright, we know who, but how are we going to get her to tell us where Draco is?"
Though he was not required at the Department of Magical Law between Christmas and New Year, the former Lord could barely sit still in his own home. Memories of how his son had acted around Potter at Christmas, as opposed to the day before, wove themselves into an incomprehensible net he tangled himself up in. Hence, the pureblood filled his days by using the copying charm the young Hermione Granger had given him, digitalising as much of his library as possible. Yet, often, he came across books on Dark Magic he did not want to offer. Least of all to the Department of Magical Law. Those tomes once again drove the message home, how 'complicated' his family's history was. His father had insisted on Lucius studying this kind of magic from an early age. Abraxas had advised him that he always needed the upper hand in any situation. Why Dark Magic had to be involved, the former Lord only now took the time to contemplate. Though he shared the belief that knowledge was power, and with magic that was even truer, Lucius wondered when it all had become about power, instead of what was best for their family. Knowing the darkest curses had certainly not helped, in the end.
"I'll tell you, okay? One day, I'll explain it all, just not now, Draco, alright? It's … complicated."
magic.
"That would be correct, Harry." His partner grinned, when the raven-haired bristled like an insulted cat upon entering their office.
Sighing, picking up his materials, the blond pointed out, "I swore to serve him, and I do so to the best of my ability. Just like you taught me. But I am not a mindless puppet. If Potter behaves like an idiot, I will call him out on it." Looking at the book he was studying, the young blond shrugged. "Not that it's of any concern to him …"
"And, of course, we will keep an even closer eye on our parolees and their masters and mistresses from now on. To prevent a repetition of that unfortunate event and to keep our fellow citizens safe, of course."
Harry naturally took a brown one. You could never go wrong with chocolate. After his blood-sugar-levels were sufficiently boosted, he waved his wand over the marked map of London; they had spread it over the couch table. As the crumbs disappeared, he studied the vague red circle their summoning had produced. "Only Westwood Gardens, corner Westwood Road makes sense. But there are only suburban, one-story houses. Will this be enough for Robarts to let us investigate?"
"In one word, you hate it!"
This is the last Chapter for a while now. But, don't despair. NaNoWriMo is going really well. For once, all of my characters do behave.
"Draco was a snotty little bastard at Hogwarts and I never particularly liked him. At Quidditch, he was always more interested in showing up Potter than Slytherin winning," Flint shared dispassionately. "But our first evening at Hogwarts, Professor Snape taught us that Slytherin House is family. He said that outside of our common-room, we stand together." He sneered at Daphne. "So, sure, there will be a Ministry sanctioned operation, but they will care about these Children of Hecate above all else. This cult is a threat to wizarding and muggle Britain, so taking them out will be their priority. Maybe that 'hero' Potter will look for Draco, but I say, we are Slytherins, and we get our snotty, little bastard back. And after we have saved the life of Saint Potter's servant, they can do whatever they want. We just have to make sure that the Daily Prophet gets
"So, you are not angry?" Draco asked in a small voice. He sounded like a child and should have felt embarrassed, but he was just so drained.
Turning towards him, Robarts studied the young man with interest. "Tell me, Potter: who briefed you on what to say? Because after working with you for four years, I find it hard to believe that you would come up with such diplomatic responses and carefully concealed threats on your own."
"One thing he does right," she remarked before gesturing towards the pipes. "Well, go on then. I want to know what my husband and child are talking about."
Transforming one of the side-tables into an armchair, Harry sank into it and looked up. "You remember the extenuating circumstances I have mentioned earlier?"
"I'm sorry, Pot… Harry, for taking what was yours. Please, take it back."
"We should have," Harry relented in a whisper. "Right from the beginning! If Severus had not been around …"
These journals were brilliant! Every Potion Master in the United Kingdom would kill … well, maybe not kill but seriously maim or injure to get their hands on them. And Draco - an Ex-Death Eater without a wand - had the honour of reviewing them. Draco knew that this knowledge was wasted on him. Still, he was too selfish to reveal that to Harry. He had only been instructed to do research. He certainly did not need a wand for that.
When he was finished around five, nearly the entire table of the kitchen was covered in boxes. Thank Merlin for Hermione's undetectable expansion charms. After a brief shower, Harry picked up the charmed picknick basket and his overnight bag and flooed to the Granger-Weasley house. Knowing his way around, he stored the perishables and peeked into the kitchen. As expected, Ron was in the middle of an organised chaos, where he put some last-minute touches on several dishes and charmed others for later consumption.
"Oh," Harry mumbled sheepishly. "So that's foxglove over there."
Rolling his eyes, Harry followed. The amount of decorum necessary for an 'official' visit between purebloods he would never understand. Neville had hammered enough rules and regulations into his head and advised him to adopt a 'fake it until you make it' mindset. Yet in the muggle-raised's mind, this was bordering on ridiculous. Still, he dutifully followed the couple to be, because messing this up would evoke Narcissa's ire and he had no intention whatsoever of doing that. Slowly he wandered the elegant halls, wondering why - despite Draco's repeated assurances that this was what he wanted - all this felt so incredibly wrong.
Rearing back, as if she had slapped him, Harry jumped to his feet, growling angrily, “How dare you to say that? You didn’t even know Sirius. He deserves this!”
"No," Harry had grinned. "I am not."
Dumbfounded, Draco looked after him and inevitably asked himself, why the Auror would have a blood sample of a random poison-victim in his room. Then he realised: Harry wouldn't. He would not have a blood sample of a random stranger in his room. It made no sense for him to store blood at all. Hence, he would not do that. That, however, led to another revelation:
Harry had never considered himself a particularly religious person. Of course, the Dursleys had gone to church on occasion. But since he had been locked in his cupboard at the time, he had had trouble considering their actions as an act of faith or altruism. Aunt Petunia's charity work had only ever been motivated by elevating herself above those who had less.
"Earl Grey," the witch inhaled contently. "Goes quite well with the cupcakes."
Clutching his wand, purposefully relaxing his posture, the younger Auror studied the crowd again, to maybe find a reason for his unease. "Something will happen. I just know it."
The two steamrolled wizards traded another shrug before Draco instructed, "The overnight-bag is in the bathroom. Just throw in my toiletries, and I'm good."
And then - after finally having hope for the first time in so long - Harry made a crucial mistake.
"You'll have to ask Potter."
With a sigh, Draco informed him, "I have tried that as well."
"Mr Potter taught you at Hogwarts, from what I've heard."
"Bullshit! That's bullshit, George, and if you would stop making excuses for her and everybody else, you would see that. You were identical; I know that we all know that since you enjoyed toying with people, posing as the other. But she is your mother. Looking at you, she should see George and nobody else! Fred is gone and deserves to be remembered. And you are here and deserve to live and be seen!" Turning around, watching the other Weasleys and Hermione, he had challenged, "Or does a single one of you believe that
Interrupting his son when he drew breath, Lucius remarked, “If it were convenient for you, I would like to return to the Manor today. If I am supposed to draw up a defence, for that pathetic excuse of a Death Eater, I need access to my books. It will not do much good, but if I don’t at least pretend, Mister Lostrife might get free on the excuse of a negligent defender.”
That evening, Severus found his godson in the garden after dinner. Lucius and Narcissa had already departed, and the Potion Master had had a craving for fresh air and a firewhiskey. He was surprised to find Draco nursing a tumbler, with the bottle by his side, watching a patchy white-grey wolf digging through some leafs. The young man flinched when he claimed the other lounge chair and helped himself to some whiskey.
Quietly, her nephew defended himself, "But Victoire would like to have one."
"Good, old-fashioned revenge, for taking her toy and preventing her from gaining another? You know, some people are petty like that."
"Conjuring fire is not a first-year spell!"
Closing and locking the door of the private bathroom, Harry turned towards his pale companion. Usually, these 'powder rooms' were reserved for the ladies. But the young wizard could not care less at the moment. Not when Draco seemed ready to faint.
Steadying himself with the help, the raven inquired surprised, "When did you come in?"
"Do you think he will look up anytime soon?"
--O-O--
"I think …" the man started, but the Auror interrupted him by raising his hand.
"No way! But you're a Pendragon. You have to be one of King Arthur's descendants," the raven-haired Auror protested.
Defeated, Lucius held out the paper-wrapped band of leather and a coiled leather leash.
"Mother and Aunt Walburga had a book on herbal remedies for pregnant women. Maybe I can find it in the attic."
When the blond pulled back, he blinked. Slowly working through Harry's memories. Draco did not move, did not even pull back from where he was still clutching the wrist of Harry's wand−arm, in a desperate attempt to keep him from casting. "He's really dead," Draco whispered after a while, looking up at Harry with a reverence he had never shown before. "You didn't just kill him … you destroyed his soul."
--O-O--
"Harry," his friend reminded him, "Priorities!"
"Why would I …?" Harry asked, digging himself out of bed, but once again, his elf interrupted, "Master wishes to take a shower now!" Before vanishing.
With a raised eyebrow, Michael Welch, the Librarian of the Westminster Abbey inquired, "So the Malfoy family is currently not under your care, Mr Potter? Somehow the Daily Prophet left that impression."
Trading a glance with his godfather, Draco suggested, "There are potions that can help a witch to get pregnant. Troubles conceiving are not uncommon with purebloods."
attention on his medi-witch. "You … discussed my treatment … with my godson?"
Angry about the commotion, Kreacher picked up the girl. "That's a fish-fork, Emerald, as I have told you three times already. And it is considered impolite to pop in without being called."
"Smarter than the both of us!" Talking over the man, Harry shot him an angry look. "Listen, Lucius, I need you, someone with your experience and your knowledge of how to further a new political agenda. But I am afraid that I can't work with you, as long as I am not convinced that I can trust you."
"They have to drink Camomile Tea. All. Day. Long!"
"I am perfectly fine. Stressed and overworked at times, but that is to be expected in my position. I
Drinking his juice, handing back the empty bottle, he asked, "Can you tell me what this was about?" The sugar was hitting his system, invigorating him nicely and the camphor seemed to settle lasting nausea that went with most head−injuries.
"You should have told us." The blond berated quietly, leaning against the vanity. He was calmer, now that he had something else but Dolohov to concentrate on.
The Auror's eyes flickered, avoided to look at Snape who sat at his accustomed chair at the table. Angling his body so the Potion Master was at his back and Draco in front of him, he nodded, "Very well, Draco Malfoy, did you brew a poison to kill Lord Alexio Rosier?"
Looking at the three wizards, Kreacher slipped from the chair and bowed deeply, as Harry offered a half-hearted, encouraging smile. "Yes, Master."
Alright, this is it. This story carried me through two years of body forming surgeries (inside and outside)  with the grand finale of this Corona Virus Pandemic.
Rising to hug her brother, the girl revealed, "Because you were always sloppy polishing yours and I would get oil all over my clothes. Mum never caught me, when I used Fred's."
Neville, covered for his partner by distracting the red−head, "Because we've raided a safe−house not three days ago and haven't managed a single conviction, because the bastard living there cried 'uncle'."
"And yet that is exactly what you offer."
Have a wonderful summer.
On Thursday, Lucius had requested to see his 'client' again, but having been called into the field, Harry had simply not been able to make that happen. He had seen the frustration in the former Lord's eyes, but the man had simply tilted his head in deference and withdrawn his request. At first, Harry had considered this gesture either a calculated effort, showing oneself compliant to get one's way or a quite childish bout of passive resistance. However, when the pureblood had returned to their earlier topic, the young man had realised that Lucius had never honestly thought his request to be granted. Yes, he needed to talk to Lostrife but was well aware of his liege's packed schedule. Still, Malfoy had put his request on the table, despite knowing that he would be denied.
Whipping around, Lucius froze at the very sight of him, breathing out a disbelieving, "Severus …"
"Scourgify!"
Severus was shocked when he took in the picture his usually so perfectly groomed godson made. Blond strands were in disarray and slightly greasy, the boy had not shaved in at least two days, and if the former professor was not mistaken, those were the same robes he had worn two days ago for dinner.
"You needed sleep. These last few weeks, you would take a nap on the couch in your office, this time of the day."
Then they turned back towards their Potion Master. "Alright," Harry started, "Where do we begin? Once upon a time …"
"No, you can't," Harry laughed when he and Neville tumbled out of the floo of No 12 Grimmauld Place three hours later.
"I could, but they don't need me to. They told me that everything is up to standard. Especially after Hermione brushed them up when we stayed here a few years ago."
--O-O--
When Harry merely looked at his hands, mumbling something incomprehensible, his former professor prompted, "Speak up!"
When finally, after nearly twenty minutes, the boy calmed, Harry placed him on the table, so they were eye-to-eye. Draco still hovered at his back, clearly overwhelmed with the situation, but willing to soldier through to help his little cousin. He handed over a cup of camomile tea a desperate Emerald had prepared.
Once he left the burrow, he found the rest of his family lounging around the huge bonfire, spreading over transfigured sofas and loveseats. Easily slipping down beside Draco, he pulled the blond close, so he could cover them both with the quilt Molly sent over with a flicker of her wand. At first, his companion resisted the gesture, but after a minute, when nobody seemed inclined to comment on their proximity, Draco relaxed into the impromptu embrace. Neither he nor Harry noticed the meaningful glances George threw his sister, and the sly smile she offered in return.
"Yes, Master."
Rolling his eyes, Harry tried to recall what Charles Young, the Auror crops' psychiatrist had told him, "There is no measure to trauma or pain, Draco. No scale you use to say: yes, these events qualify for a person to develop PTSD and no, this is not 'traumatic' enough. Even a few minutes of torture can be enough, and apart from Lady Blackwood, you basically were in a hostage situation from 14 to 17 in your own home. No matter how reluctant, Voldemort made you a warrior in his war. I think all of that, with the abduction as icing on the cake, is enough to drive anyone nuts."
"Not at the moment," she eased Harry. "But if you’re not around, it could be."
Narrowing her eyes at him, Hermione pulled over his plate and started devouring the rest of his lunch, before finishing her cake and milk, challenging him wordlessly to say something.
The young wizard could not suppress the beaming smile when he nodded and gazed at Draco, who still hovered by his side. "How do I do that?"
Aware that he would not get out of this discussion, Harry trudged towards the kitchen, in the hope of discovering leftovers. At his dejected look when he found the stove empty, Draco pushed him down on the bench and called for Kreacher. Within minutes Harry had a hot meal in front of him. There had been leftovers after all.
Draco's fingers were trembling, as he looked down at the wand he had missed like a limb for the last four years.
--O-O--
Draco was rambling, even in his own head, he realised. Still, watching the moon travel over the night sky, through the third-floor window, the blond took his time to sort through everything he thought, felt and knew. He banished his petty jealousy to the back of his head, resolved to serve and support his new master to the best of his abilities. Not because he had promised, or because he owed it, but because it was the right thing to do. Potter had been through enough in the first eighteen years of his life. It was time that he had more people in his corner who supported
