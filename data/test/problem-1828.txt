“Well I think you have to use a Slytherin approach to get him to talk to you. He needs to know that you are not going anywhere and that you are willing to work with him through all of this. The Sorting Hat is barmy, but the selection of dance partners was spot on for all of us.”
“Well, I would appreciate it if you stopped dawdling and just got this over with. I have no interest in being here, so just get on with it and choose which poor soul gets stuck with me.”
“Only fashionably so.” There is a roughness in his voice that betrays only a hint of annoyance, and Draco feels an answering shiver of his own.
The next day found Harry waking early. He thought back to the previous evening and caught himself smiling. They had talked for ages, and even though Draco had to work a shift later, he had promised to take Harry to the botanical garden. Or as he had said
“Uhm sorry.” Harry licked the fresh mango juice of his fingers, and turned toward Draco only to feel his own breath catch.
The last sentence made the hairs on his neck stand up, but he pushed the feeling aside. He focused on the other characteristics of the wood, but nothing really spoke to him.
“It looks like you have the honour of putting him to bed.” Draco blinks at her. “Don’t worry, he is easy when it comes to bedtime. Just stay with him until he sleeps.”
"Well, England was not home any longer and I just wanted to get away. My family's roots are French and I wanted to go somewhere warm. So I just picked the place that I knew the least about. I found peace here."
I am alone, caught in the fire and I know that no matter how long or loud I scream for him to save me he won't come back, won't rescue me. I swallow smoke fading from consciousness but then I awake in the damp cell of Azkaban. Alone again, why would I matter to anybody? And the fear, to be forgotten settles into my bones, clinging like tar to me.
This morning is particularly bad. Even getting up requires effort, but he has promised Mipsy to finish the library soon, and there is still a lot of work to be done. The fire in his room is already going by the time he manages to drag his body out of bed, and there is a chill in his bones that he can’t seem to shake. Even worse, he presumes, is that he can hear the walls whisper to him, calling for him. Well, he would do whatever they want if they could be clearer in their instructions. As it is the soft pleading is driving him spare. No clear words, but the tone is cajoling, as if he should know what they want from him.
The soft sucking on his earlobe, caused Harry’s knees to buckle, and only Draco’s strong arms kept him upright.
Not only his wand felt complete when he was with Harry. He himself felt complete when he was with Harry.
"Will you tell me about the dish that Maman told you to serve me on my first day, and you keep mentioning it as well so I guess it must be special for the island right?"
The shop with the attached atelier is perfect. He loves the light falling into the backroom, and he can see himself already working with the fitting models.
"I would say we realised that we were better off as siblings than we would ever be as husband and wife. I care for her deeply, but I had to admit that physically she just doesn't do it for me."
So of course he was engrossed in his work, touching up the last of the new polish for a delivery of wands when the doorbell rang.
Which is why she stood in front of the small cottage that Harry inhabited. The downpour was even harder here. Harry didn't open the door, but Ginny didn't let that deter her.
“No that would have been me! You need a distraction from what Pansy told me!” Draco shoots from his seat at the sight of his oldest friend, standing in the door of the library.
Harry loved autumn. He loved it when the days started with the crisp air streaming into the room through the open window, and the feeling of waking under his warm duvet. But just as he wanted to turn over again, the pop of Apparition resounded in his bedroom.
“I have been young too, and let me say, Mr Malfoy, that situations like yours and Mr Potter’s tend to spring from suppressed passion more often than not. And given the fact that Mr Potter started this entire thing in order to make you smile - well, just see where this week takes you both.”
I get ready for my day, thinking about the logistics. It doesn't help I have to try and transfigure a loo for a cat and find a way, to take him with me to the cafe. I can't leave him here alone, the poor little thing.
Phoenix has spent the entire day in his basket watching the going ons, and apart from clawing at Vicky, he has been a very sweet cat. Maybe she had aggravated the stitches?
"You are doing it again!" I am angry all of a sudden and only the weight of the crups keeps me where I am. "How can you sit there and say you care about me and at the same time threaten to leave me alone? Mother, I don't want to be alone! I want you to talk to me, to be there for me for once! Do you know how happy I was to hear you laugh when I came to visit you? And then I realized that is was because of them, and Potter here." I blink because suddenly my eyes brim with tears and I will NOT cry in front of Potter. "I would have done anything to be able to make you laugh like this."
He is led into the courtroom, and pushed on the lonely chair which puts him in chains immediately. The first stirrings of panic encroach him, but he focuses on breathing. He has no idea what the actual charges are and how he can respond and defend himself, maybe there is no defence for him.
“I am sorry, I need to get back to the Manor for a bit,” he throws out without a thought or two. “You can manage with Teddy?” Without looking back he Summons his things and Apparates back to the empty Manor. He throws up the wards that won't let others pass and collapses onto the cold stone floor.
The existence of the peculiar piece of magic, obscure and just another more archaic aspect of family magic would have remained forgotten. If not for the machinations of one Lucius Malfoy.
"Your wand doesn't work when I am not around, because I am not there to protect you, and you have not accepted your wand’s choice," Harry mumbled.
"You'll be the death of me." Harry mumbled and chewed the foods softly. He loved the idea of Draco making food for their outing and nurtured the small spark of warmth that he felt with the former Slytherin.
"Thank you." Harry was baffled, that Draco had paid such close attention, but dug into the food without further comment. They sat in silence for a while, both eating and enjoying the mild breeze that caressed their skin.
"I haven't done enough to help him?" I sound bitter - but why is it always about me doing something for others?
“This is where I have to tell you that yes, men can get pregnant, and that the lack of equipment is exactly why you feel like shit at the moment. Harry, I have to send you to someone who can actually help you, and I can’t stress highly enough that you have to see them immediately. In fact, I will transfer you, as soon as I made a floo call, because I can’t answer the questions that you have, as much as I want to.”
would never point out that every man that you have dated in the last five years has had a resemblance to a certain wandmaker we both know."
"Hate to break it to you, but you don't need to call upon that spirit. You channel her well enough." Draco started to laugh.
“Send him away.” Draco feels old, much older than his 18 years. Mipsy pops away to do his bidding—but Harry would not be Harry if he just took no for an answer.
"May I see?" Ollivander stretches his hand over the counter, and he places his wand into the gnarled fingers. A small flinch flits over the old man’s face and he sighs.
“No, tea is perfectly fine!” He stands there not knowing what to do with himself, well aware of the strange figure he must make in the cozy cottage, dressed in his finest robes. He wishes he could tug on the collar but that would be so undignified.
“Very well then, Ms. Granger.” He slowly gets to his feet and comes around the desk. “If you’d be so kind as to follow me.”
“Bye, Draco. See you at the hearing.” He’s regretting his words, even as he slams the door shut. But he doesn’t go back.
He leans forward and takes a look inside. He catalogues the room carefully. There’s only one door, and the window is too narrow to be used as an escape route. He can feel the anti-Apparition wards, like a lingering claustrophobia, pressing in on all his senses. It’s not the sensation that’s unpleasant. Not really. It’s the awareness of what it means that makes his skin crawl and his heart slam almost painfully against his ribs.
Ron’s frown turns into a smirk. Harry throws a biscuit at him and sinks into one of the kitchen chairs.
Malfoy bends over with his head low and his hands resting on his knees and takes a few deep, shuddering breaths.
They wait another half hour. It’s twenty past eight now, and the Warming Charm has worn off. Harry is about to suggest they go home, when Ron elbows him in the ribs and nods towards the stone hut.
There’s a bit of shuffling around and a few muttered curses as the Cloak slips, but in the end, all three of them manage to fit under it, and they make their way across the moor and into the stadium. They find a quiet spot under the stands, and Harry slips the hair into the vial of potion. It swirls and bubbles, and then the smoke clears. Jamie Cadogan smells a bit like gasoline, and the potion has a nasty, oily look to it. Harry gulps down half the vial, wishing that he'd thought to bring a freshmint. The taste makes him gag, but only for a few seconds. Then the feeling of his body simultaneously stretching and shrinking is so overwhelming that he can’t focus on anything else. His waist grows wider, and his face turns pudgy and pimply. He can feel his fingers grow shorter and wider too, and when he looks down, he has to take off his glasses to see his ragged fingernails clearly. Hermione holds out a hand for the glasses, but the thought of giving them up makes him feel oddly exposed. He slips them into his pocket instead.
Draco has his arms crossed in front of his chest, but his face is completely blank. The only thing that betrays emotion is his eyes. They’re so full of panic, Harry can almost feel it himself. Guilty eyes, the Auror part of his mind supplies. Harry tells it to shut up, and tries again.
Oh fucking hell. Reminding Draco of the past is probably a really bad idea. But Draco just smiles that small, nostalgic smile again.
“Sorry I’m late. I had to stop by the excavation. One of the trainees forgot to cover up the trenches. Again. And it’s been raining a lot this morning.”
“St. Mungo’s–but I’ll be fine to go on my own, if you want to go home, or to your office or somewhere else. Erm. I mean...  I can Floo you after I check in with Ron.”
Malfoy throws him a half hearted glare, and walks to the bar. Harry can’t help noticing a subtle sway in his hips that wasn’t there before.
“You’re welcome to borrow it, if you want. It has some very interesting notes in the margins, made by my great uncle.”
When he looks at Draco, he’s startled to see a small, genuine smile, just like the one on his own lips. It’s good to know that Hermione has made a friend who is as hungry for knowledge as she is. It’s the one area where neither he nor Ron has ever been able to measure up.
The cottage is a pit. There’s the clutter that comes from someone living alone and not bothering to pick up after himself; plates of half eaten food, cold cups of tea and an overflowing ashtray are scattered over every available surface. And then there are all the signs of someone ransacking the place. Furniture has been tipped over, the cupboard is gaping open and an old cloak has been tossed on the floor. A few books have been tossed to the ground, surrounded by torn out pages. A beer bottle has been knocked over and a puddle of cheap, Muggle lager is seeping into the threadbare carpet next to the upended armchair. Harry mentally catalogues it all, careful to look in all directions and take in as many details as possible for later Pensieve viewing. Beside him, he hears the familiar mumbling of Ron’s voice, while he casts detecting charms, trying to find out what kind of magic was last used here, and when.
“How can you say that?” he asks. “That last memory. He only put it there to remind Potter why he shouldn’t be working with me. And the rest of it? Completely trivial. What the fuck am I supposed to do with a memory of him reading books and being tortured?”
“Yeah, okay.” Davies can’t quite hide the grin on his face, when he turns to the reception desk. Gracie is looking at them with a small smile. “If anyone asks for me, please tell them I’m assisting Auror Potter.”
The study reminds Harry of Draco’s office at the museum, except there’s no sign of Muggle technology. He’s glad in a way. A laptop in Malfoy Manor would probably be one surreal thing too many on this already bizarre day. Besides, it’d probably blow up from all the magical energy inside the Manor.
“Frustrated. Other than that, there’s no change.” She sinks into the armchair next to the fire. Her eyes are fixed somewhere in the middle distance, and Harry’s heart sinks.
Ron nods and hurries towards the corridor that leads to the second floor. Harry gets the water boiling and finds three mugs in the slightly lopsided cupboard. He usually drinks out of the slightly chipped one that Rose has decorated with finger paint, but that one is huge and thick, and keeps the tea warm for ages. He roams around for small, thin ones instead. They don’t have time for more than a quick cup while he explains what’s happened and Ron and Hermione wake up.
Harry waits, but Malfoy doesn’t say anything else. He can feel his frustration rising and bubbling into anger. Malfoy being a stupid, smug wanker hasn’t changed just because he’s grown up to be less evil and more gorgeous. He scowls. Malfoy smirks at him.
Oh. So Adam hasn’t recognised him yet. Harry relaxes a bit. Perhaps he should try to stay anonymous for a while longer. Just to postpone the moment where the conversation turns from awkward flirting to awkward remembrance of dead loved ones.
"Not a lot." Ron throws the tissue away and shrugs. "Confirmed his identity. Had to listen to a lot of nonsense about pure-bloods and Death Eaters. He did say that he had ‘big plans’, but he didn’t go into any details.”
He doesn’t meet with us. I reckon he doesn’t like getting his poncy hands dirty. But according to Bludger, our orders come from Malfoy.
How the fuck is he supposed to answer that? He mutters something unintelligible and hopes that neither Malfoy or the guards will take offence. They need the guards to let them in, after all.
“That sounds more like something you’d kill people for. And the people who are interested in that sort of thing sound exactly like the sort that wouldn’t think twice about setting off a SDEA alarm.”
“Fuck, I was stupid!” Draco murmurs against his lips. “Thinking I would be able to just put this out of my mind and go on like nothing happened.”
They Floo back to the flat together. Somehow, it’s not as awkward as he might have imagined–if he’d ever imagined something like this–having Draco there, in his cozy but not exactly posh living room, on his sofa, with a bottle of lager in his hand. He doesn’t look out of place at all. Harry sits down beside him and he smiles.
“Weasley, Potter. Welcome to the Stonehenge excavation.” He takes off his glove and holds out a slim hand for them to shake. Harry doesn’t hesitate. This is not the first time he’s held Malfoys hand, after all. A brief flash of a shaking, sweaty palm, desperately grabbing at his hand as fiery monsters dance in the background seeps into his mind, but he quickly banishes the flash back. Malfoy’s hand is cool and surprisingly soft, but the handshake is firm.
Harry looks in the direction of the voice, and finally sees Malfoy. Or, part of him, at least, because Malfoy is kneeling with his back turned towards them. One arm is stretched out in front of him for support, and in the other, he’s holding a small trowel. He’s leaning down to look at something on the ground, which means that his very firm arse is showcased nicely inside heavy khaki trousers. Harry’s mouth suddenly goes dry, and he doesn’t quite know where to look. Luckily, Malfoy pushes smoothly to his feet and comes to greet them.
Several cups of tea and discarded files later, he’s skimming through Bludger’s family history, when Ron shows up, grinning from ear to ear.
Draco casts a charm on both of them, and he finds himself wearing a black, muggle suit. Draco’s similarly dressed, and Harry has no idea how he manages to look so crisp and put together after two nights in a cell and a quick trip to the Ministry bathroom. Draco looks him over and nods his approval.
The thought that Draco has been worried about him is enough to make his heart skip and his face soften. “I had to,” he says. “The alarm went off. But I’ve got loads of new information.”
The Death Eaters have some kind of leader with more brains than Bludger, and they are planning to strike at a time where many Muggleborns are in the same place at once. They’ve hidden the Chalice, and they’re going to hide the diary that holds the ritual that can release Ron’s magic back to him. And that’s where it stops. Without Ron there, he can’t form a plan of action. He eyes the vial. There is evidence of a crime in there, which means that technically speaking, it’s evidence. He shouldn’t take it outside of the Ministry. But Hermione and Ron both have the proper clearance, and Savage has authorised Draco as a consultant on the case… And if he hurries, he might still get a plate full of leftover lamb chops and possibly even some dessert. He pockets the vial and makes his way back to the atrium.
They stand there for a few seconds, just looking at each other and catching their breath. Then Harry casts a set of standard crime scene wards on the hut, while Ron checks for hidden persons behind the few pieces of furniture. He can feel the relieved smile spreading on his face, and see it mirrored in Ron’s wide grin.
The lift door opens and they enter. The Ministry is deserted this time on a Saturday morning. No one else needs to get on or off the lift, so the ride to Level Two is quicker than usual.
“Thank you for Apparating me. I must admit, this hasn’t been the easiest morning I’ve ever had.” Malfoy coughs and takes another sip of whiskey. “In all honesty, I’d probably have splinched myself.”
“Wh- oh,” Draco says faintly. He staggers back to the bench and sits down, hiding his face in his hands for a moment, and Harry’s heart swoops. Fuck! There’s no way he could have put the things he’s just said delicately, but maybe barging in here like this was a bad idea.
Harry can feel the heat spreading up his neck and across his cheeks. Fuck. He’s probably bright red and splotchy. How did he miss the fact that letting Draco see the memory would mean he’d know about the shoe pissing thing? He looks at his battered old trainers. They’re not looking any worse than they did this morning. The cleaning charm must have been thorough enough. But still…
“I’m so sorry.” Malfoy gently puts a consoling hand on her shoulder. Harry has to make an effort to keep from gaping at them. Who is this new Malfoy?
“Good. We’ll go inside under this Cloak, and you’re going to guard the door. If they try to leave, please stun them. Nothing else. Just stun them. Do you understand?”
“Yeah, alright.” Tanned Bloke’s shoulders slump. “I need to piss before we leave.” He walks towards the door, and Harry flattens himself against the uneven wall and tries not to breathe too loudly.
“Wha.. yes. I suppose we do.” Harry shrugs. His brain seems to have frozen. Is this… thing between them supposed to be a secret?  “He’s all right,” he adds, helplessly.
They pull out of the Pensieve at the same time, gasping for air, and shaking their heads to clear away the disorientation. Harry speaks first, while Ron is still shaking his head like a dog, trying to dislodge the Pensieve liquid from his ears and spraying droplets all over the small, dark room. Harry has never understood why the only Pensieve in the Ministry must be stored in what must at one point have been the Department of Mysteries broom cupboard.
Harry considers it. Disillusionment charms aren’t Ron’s strongest point, but he’s a capable wizard, and besides, it’s easier to get the wand movements right if you’re not trying to aim at yourself. “Swap,” he says.
“Yeah. I figured. There’s not much to talk about, really. They still can’t find anything wrong with me, physically. I’m healthy as a hippogriff, except that I’m a Squib.”
Draco turns around, startled, and brushes his lips across his cheek, and then finds his mouth for a quick kiss.
He dries off and grabs a pair of jeans and his oldest, softest Weasley jumper. No formal robes with millions of buttons today! He ventures into the kitchen in search of some sort of breakfast–probably dry corn flakes, he thinks. He hasn’t exactly had time to run to the shop these last few days, and the milk has probably gone off by now. He picks the letter up on the way back through the living room. Then he makes a cup of tea, and tears the envelope open. The letter is just a short note, written in Hermione’s neat cursive.
“Ibuprofen would probably be best, if you want it,” Draco offers. “It won’t interfere with the Skele-Gro.”
“I don’t know. I’m feeling a bit dizzy,” Draco murmurs. His face is greyish and his eyes are wide and unfocused. Panicky. Fuck! He has to do something.
“Bloody hell,” Ron whispers. He strokes Rose’s sweaty hair away from her face and shakes his head. “Your mother has gone soft in her old age. But don’t worry. I’ll always be the voice of reason in this family.”
Hermione sends Harry a small smile, and follows the old man down the corridor. Harry hurries to catch up.
Draco nods, but he doesn’t make room for Harry to step around him. He just stands there, staring at his face. At his eyes and–oh God–his mouth?
It’s not until he feels the relief surging through him that he realises how badly he’s been wanting to avoid going to hospital. He slumps down in the uncomfortable kitchen chair and takes a deep breath. “Thanks,” he says. “It’s just that… I really hate that place!”
Harry does his best to look repentant. When he risks a glance at Ron, he’s wearing the same, slightly embarrassed face.
“It’s a mixed village. Both Muggles and wizards. They know me, so there’s no reason to hide,” Draco says. The corner of his mouth lifts in a soft smile. “On the other hand…May I transfigure your uniform for you?”
“Good work on the diary, Auror Potter.” Savage gives him a stern look. “I trust that I won’t have to tell you what I think about putting civilians at risk by bringing them along on a mission. Or about the possible sanctions, if you should choose to do so again.”
When he steps out from behind the shed for the second time that day, he almost runs into Draco. He looks a little paler than usual, and his mouth is set in a grim line, but when he sees Harry, his face lights up in a smile that makes Harry’s heart do an odd flip flop.
“All right, all right. No need to get your wand all bent out of shape! Maybe I’ve heard a few things after all.”
Malfoy’s pretty lips are forming the word, and Harry realises he must have been a lot less subtle than he intended. Fuck!
“Since we started working together. It was awkward at first, but Draco always puts work first. He’s not the kind of person who puts personal opinions before what’s best for the project he’s working on.” The last sentence is delivered with a very pointed look.
Draco’s cheeks are turning slightly pink. Harry shakes his head. He might be friends with Hermione these days, but apparently he doesn’t know her very well.
He hopes it will, at least. It’s been too long since they’ve been out together, all three of them. The last time must have been at the beginning of February, when Hermione got promoted to do whatever it is that she does as an Unspeakable, which means that he has been doing practically nothing but working for almost three weeks.
“Brilliant! Thanks.” The smile is so sudden and so big, his cheeks hurt. “So, I’ve got my potion, and you’ve got the Cloak. We’d better get moving. You never know when Shannon’ll catch the snitch. She’s dead fast.”
“I know some of it might be confidential, and I’m not asking you to tell me anything like that,” Malfoy says at last. “But I need to know what precisely it is that you want my help with. Because I am going to help you, if I can, but I have a job here too. It might not mean a lot to you, but Stonehenge IV is probably the most important excavation in a decade, and I’m not leaving it to a couple of interns so I can go and be your research assistant. I’ve better things to do with my time than look up references for you two, at least unless you give me a good reason.”
“No! No. Sorry. I’m not explaining this very well, am I? Savage signed the release order. It was your father… He was orchestrating everything from Azkaban. Please! We don’t have much time.”
“No. She told me you would handle it, since it’s your case. I’ll take you through to the crime scene.”
"I think it's this one. My old copy of Beedle the Bard." Draco smiles and points at the dark purple letters on the cover. "The title is written in charmed ink. It changes colour depending on the owner's mood."
Right on cue, Officer Davies bursts through the door with a vial in one hand and the signed permit in the other. Harry grins.
He’s dressed and Flooing to the Ministry by seven thirty the next morning, ready to dive back into the piles of background checks and follow-ups strewn across his desk. He hesitates in the lobby.  There’s an almost physical force pulling him towards the holding cells. But Savage made it clear yesterday that there is to be absolutely no ‘sullying the good name of the Auror department by fraternizing with a suspect’. His insides twist up painfully at the thought. It might be days–weeks even–before he sees Draco again. He forces his leaden legs to move towards the DMLE instead.
“What are you going to do about those two?” Draco gestures vaguely to Bludger and Matt on the floor next to the dining table.
Of course she did. It takes a lot more than a murder case to get the Head Auror out of bed before eight a.m. on a Saturday.
“I hope so.” Hestia's grin turns slightly smug, but he can't really blame her. The fireworks case has been giving them headaches for weeks.
They sneak through the hall and Draco tugs him towards a wide set of doors. The sound of rough laughter is coming from the room beyond. Harry digs his heels into the gleaming floor, and they come to a stop.
Harry Floos into the atrium and manages not to stumble at all. Which is lucky, since he lands in the middle of a press conference. Percy is standing in front of the fountain, surrounded by photographers and reporters.
“Yeah, Percy is a wanker,” Ron mutters. “He can fuck right off, with his stupid election. But I think Harry’s broken his ankle. He should be in hospital.”
“Great. You go and get a Portkey set. I just need to grab my uniform and a few other things from the Auror department.”
Hermione and Draco come back from the dining room. Harry watches Draco put the kettle on, like he’s been living in a Muggle house his whole life. He wonders how much of the conversation with Ron he’s overheard. If he did overhear, does he mind?
“No. It didn’t. We’re not even sure which murder was committed first, actually. It’s right this way.” He gestures towards the MLE Floo.
“Let’s get this one back for questioning.” Ron nods at Smith. “Might not be the one you were thinking it was, but he’s still a shitty little coward!” He grabs his wand and conjures a length of rope. Except nothing happens.
“Right. Savage was asking for you. I told her you were getting your injuries fixed and you’d check in when you got here.”
“What the hell are you talking about? My house in France?” He narrows his eyes. “I hope you’re not asking me to flee the fucking country, Potter. Because I’m not going to run away like a fucking criminal!”
“Erm, some of the curses and wards are… I don’t know how to say this politely. They aren’t exactly Muggleborn friendly. I was hoping we could handle this without her help.”
“No it’s not. Everybody knows you have a complex about saving.people.” Draco’s smile is so smug, it really makes Harry want to punch him in the arm. He smiles back instead, and takes the chalice from his pocket. He holds it between gloved fingers, for Draco to see.
Ron tries again. Nothing. He stares at his wand, completely at a loss, and Harry’s heart starts racing. The white light when Ron grabbed the cup and Bludger’s laugh just before he disapparated... He looks down. There’s a malicious glint in Smith’s eyes now. Fucking hell!
“Interesting? Hmm. I think so too. So, what do you do, when you’re not choking on your Firewhiskey, Harry?”
I hope you got back safely last night. Ron is much better today. There is no sign of his magic returning, but he is very hopeful and in good spirits. St. Mungo’s can’t really do anything, so they are releasing him today. I’m taking him home this afternoon.
“Your emergency Portkeys. Put them in your pockets, and I’ll activate them for you. If you touch them, you’ll be transported to a secure room, and we’ll come and get you. Please keep them hidden from view at all times,” the guard instructs. “If you’ll please come with me, I’ll let you into the cellblock. The prisoner you’re interested in has been moved to the interview room at the end of the hall. It’s soundproof.” He smirks at Harry. “To ensure privacy.”
"Come on, then. We can use the Floo in here," Malfoy says. He's leaning against the doorframe next to the bar, and Harry jumps to his feet and hurries after him, without meeting his eyes.
“There’s one at the library in the department of mysteries. And it’s clear of Dark magic, so we’ll be able to handle it.”
We’ve decided that Ron might be more comfortable in a Muggle environment for now. We’re going to stay with my parents for a few days. I hope you’ll join us for breakfast.
"The Chalice takes the magic from anyone who touches it. And, if you perform the right rituals, it can be set to take magic from people in a certain location or with a certain magical signature. Like Mudbloods." Smith smirks. "And I know that since you don't have the Chalice, and you have no clue how to release the magic, Weasley is no more than a squib."
Ron goes bright red. Apparently even Polyjuice can’t counteract his tendency to blush. “Fuck you, you wanker,” he hisses.
“Easy there, Weasley,” Malfoy says mildly. “You know, it might help if you told me what exactly it is that you’re investigating. If you don’t, I can’t judge which informations might be important.”
Fuck. He has no idea what or where Scara Brae is. A kick over his calf almost makes him jump. He looks down.
Half an hour later, Ron hops down from the stool and excuses himself for the bathroom. He slips through the back door unseen, and Harry has to run to catch up with him outside Borgin and Burkes.
He’s mildly alarmed when she aims her wand at his nose. But then she’s shooting a gentle cooling charm up first one nostril, and then the other one, and he sighs in relief as the pain fades away. He tries to sneak a look at the blond in the corner, and finds him trying–and failing–to hold back a laugh.
Harry feels his own lips curl up into a smile, breaking the almost-kiss they’ve been sharing. He pulls back and just looks at Draco. His face is open and his eyes are softer than Harry has ever seen them.
“He is wanted for questioning regarding the murder of Adrian and Adrienne Wright. Further, he’s endangered the life of an Auror, as well as two civilians, and resisted arrest. May we come in?” Ron says. Harry has to fight a twitch in his lips, despite the seriousness of the situation. Hearing Ron speak in that formal Auror voice will never stop being funny.
“No thanks. I know the way.” The healers have stopped whispering to stare at him. He turns and starts making his way up the far too familiar flight of stairs, wishing that he had been thinking far enough ahead to bring his invisibility cloak.
“Did you expect him to? Honestly! He’s the leader of a criminal organisation. Of course he’s not going to talk to outsiders.”
The noise of the morning traffic covers the sound of Apparition as Harry and Hermione spin into existence in a secluded spot behind a hedge in Bloomsbury Square Gardens. Hermione rummages in her beaded bag and pulls out a scrap of parchment, which she thrusts at him.
“Listen! I don’t like him. He was shit to Draco, when we went to Azkaban, but how the fuck do you know he’s lying?”
He curls around Draco, fitting their bodies together, and burying his nose in the fine strands of hair behind his ear, as he takes deep breaths and lets his body calm down. He lets his senses flood with all the impressions Draco's body has to offer; the smell of his hair, the salty taste of the skin on his neck and the silky feel of his skin under his hands. The soft sound of his heartbeat is a calming lullaby, and Harry drifts off, basking in the glorious feeling of lying next to someone he can't wait to wake up with.
Instead, Harry makes his way carefully across the wooden beams that support the stands, until he spots mainly blue jerseys above his head. He pauses for a moment, just long enough for an invisible hand to brush his shoulder to let him know that Draco and Hermione are behind him. Then he starts for the stairs. He makes it all the way up the stairs and into the stands, before Bludger and Tornadoes Shirt notice him. Harry looks around. That nickname won’t do for the extremely tall bloke anymore. Everyone around them is wearing Tornadoes shirts.
“Sorry,” Hermione says. “It’s just…You have the first edition of Theories of Transubstantial Transfiguration… All twelve volumes!”
A cold gust of air alerts him to the fact that he's alone. He opens his eyes, and finds Draco sitting at the edge of the bed, illuminated by a beam of light from the landing. A cold blanket of disappointment settles in his guts.
Draco nods, and reaches for his outstretched hand. His fingers are icy, but his touch still makes a pleasant, tingly heat shoot up the length of his arm. He looks at the tiny, wrapped chalice in their joined hands.
“No. Listen. I want to. But…it’s complicated right now, with the case and…” Draco leans in and places a quick kiss on his lips. Nothing more than a peck, really. And Harry’s too paralysed to do anything but accept it without trying to deepen it.
Hermione shoots them that look. The one that means they’re missing something really, really obvious.
"Something unexpected. Like... starting a home for abused crups and kneazles, or going to Romania to work with dragons."
“But… we need him to tell us about the cup. You should have heard me yammering on about my interest in antiques.”
“Not a clue. I was just fixing Rose’s porridge when one of those grumpy owls delivered a message, telling me to get here and that you’d be here too. That’s all I know. It was my turn to cook breakfast and wake Hermione up just before you were supposed to come over. She’s not best pleased about missing her Saturday lie in.”
“An archaeologist?” Ron sends her a sceptical look. “Doesn’t that interfere with his manicure or something?”
He stands up and turns around. Then he leans down, and Harry loses himself in the soft glide of their lips and the tickling of Draco’s hair against his forehead. “I’ll see you tomorrow at Ellis Moor,” Draco whispers against his lips. And then he’s gone, leaving Harry to toss and turn for hours, trying to interpret every little gesture or statement he’s made, examining them for proof that Draco wants to be with him. Around dawn, he finally comes to the conclusion that only time will tell, and he manages a couple of hours of uneasy sleep, before his alarm goes off.
Draco runs the pad of his thumb over the inside of his wrist, and he gasps. The hand on his skin stills. Fuck! He shuts his eyes a little tighter. No. He has to look. Has to see what expression is on Draco’s face. He opens his eyes, and finds startled, grey eyes staring at him. Draco’s lips are slightly parted, and they look so soft and perfect. Before he really knows what he’s doing, he’s leaning towards them. The grip on his arm tightens almost to the point of pain, and then relaxes, as Draco leans in to close the distance.
Savage is signing a pile of paperwork so high, it makes Harry feel a tiny twinge of guilt at his previous whining. She looks up and puts her quill back into the holder on the ornate inkwell.
He reads over the statement one more time. Our orders come from Malfoy. What the hell have you done, Draco? He hears Draco’s weary voice in his head. ‘Whatever those charges are, I didn’t do anything. You believe that, don’t you?’
And yes, Harry thinks, that is exactly what it looks–and smells–like. The disgusting smell comes from the soiled trousers clinging to the victim’s legs. Harry takes a closer look at the man, again cataloguing for the Pensieve. The victim is male and middle aged. He’s wearing a stained, grayish white shirt that might once have been part of a set of wizards’ formal wear, if the ruffles and the golden cuff links are any indication. His dark grey trousers are old and dirty. His face is sallow, but that may be due to the manner of death. His greying hair is swept back and tied with a black string at his nape. There is a yellow discolouration on the first and second finger of his right hand, likely caused by chain smoking. Harry’s eyes wander to a piece of parchment lying next to the victim’s wrist. It’s torn, but there is part of a drawing on it. A sunrise or sunset, and some lines. Harry carefully levitates it off the bed and keeps it hovering in mid air waiting for Ron to cast the usual protective charms on it. Instead, he conjures a very Muggle looking Ziploc bag. Harry sends him a questioning look and gets a sheepish grin in return.
Harry was at the Lake, he hadn’t even waited for his dorm-mates to go to sleep, he hadn’t said anything at all about where he was going, and none of them had asked. He threw a rock into the water and watched the ripples spread out. He’d taken off his shoes and considered just diving into the lake for the giant squid to get him. Nothing could ever go right; he could never have a school year of peace. His feet were covered in sand. He wanted to pull out his hair, wanted to scream, wanted to yell, wanted to drown in the fucking lake because every time he tried to just be as normal as The Boy Who Fucking Lived could, every single time it fucked up, and someone was angry with him, and he was under pressure or in danger and –
By the end of the week, Harry was home, and the Dursleys were the same as they always were, brash, awful, and demanding. Harry swept the floors and wondered how soon it would be until Voldemort tried to kill him again.
The way this story is formatted it like a series of vignettes, I suppose. I hope it all makes sense with how it's formatted, being short scenes and everything. This is just how I know how to write, it's how my mind works. Please let me know what you think - comments and kudos are appreciated :)
“Every school year I nearly die, at least second year involved a flying car, you know?” Harry shrugged, smiling a little at Draco’s absolute bewilderment.
Harry’s arm was still bleeding, and he felt numb and cold and hot all at once and everyone around him was screaming and Cedric’s parents – they were yelling and they took his body from Harry’s trembling arms and the next thing Harry knew he was in the hospital wing and he couldn’t answer anyone’s questions even if he’d wanted to. Hermione and Ron visited him, caught him up to speed. Hermione proudly told him that she’d caught Rita Skeeter in a jar – she’d been an unlicensed animagus, apparently – and Ron told him about Cedric’s parents. Harry wasn’t listening, not really. The schoolyear would end that week, and thank God, because Harry wasn’t sure he felt safe at Hogwarts at all anymore. If he could be transported away just like that, tortured, maimed…he wasn’t safe at Hogwarts or at home and yet he knew no alternative. He couldn’t ask Sirius. He wouldn’t let himself be pitied, despite his situation.
And here he was again, in his dorm, sweating through his pajamas, trying hard not to wake his dorm-mates with the screams he felt caught in his throat. Whenever Vernon had wacked him with the belt, he would get ten more lashes for every scream. Harry had learned how to be quiet, every time he woke up from a nightmare, he managed every time to keep his shouts in his chest and out of his mouth.
Draco was there the next night by the lake when Harry sat down at the shoreline, not bothering to even glance at the blond. Draco was there the next night and the next, and Harry was too, sitting on the shore, silent besides occasionally sticking his feet into the water.
, when we are actively going through the Forbidden Forest, and –” Draco tripped over a tree root. Harry grabbed his arm before he fell, and pulled him back to his feet. “You are such an asshole.” Draco said, “but you better tell me the rest of this story.”
“You sleep alright last night, Harry?” Neville asked him. Harry had made it back to his bed last night, though he felt sure that he looked a mess. He’d been shocked to find Malfoy of all people behind him at the Lake, and had just stared as Malfoy ran away from him. It wasn’t until a few minutes later that Harry made his way back to the Tower and into his dorm. He’d been tossing and turning all night wondering how Malfoy had known to find him there, wondering why Malfoy had followed him in the middle of the night, what could he possibly be scheming against Harry now?
“Ah. I should’ve guessed. What has your father heard of then?” Harry chuckled a little at his own reference to the blond’s titular phrase.
It was nightfall. Hedwig sat in her cage, beak between her feathers when her eyes opened wide. There was another owl at the window. A brown horned owl, carrying a letter attached by a green ribbon to its leg. Harry opened his window, quickly, snatched the letter. He knew who it was from before he even opened the thing.
“Then let me teach you how to swim, you git.” Draco led Harry further out into the water until it was up to Harry’s chin. “Now just go beneath the water, and if you need to go back up, just squeeze my arm, and I’ll take you back to the shallows.”
“Why’d you leave in the first place?” Harry asked, immediately wishing he hadn’t – he didn’t even know if it was his place to ask.
Hermione was on him as soon as he told her about the mermaids. He didn’t mention his lackluster swimming skills. “If you’re going to be going that deep, you won’t be able to hold your breath that long! The mermaids are down at the bottom of the lake!” Hermione exclaimed. “Ron,” She turned to the redhead sitting with them at the library, “what do you think we should do?”
“What are you going to do?” Malfoy asked, walking up to Harry and sitting down beside him, one of those nights at the Lake.
Draco opened his mouth to answer when Filch walked right past them, merely feet away from where they stood.
“What are you reading?” Harry asked him, turning around to actually look at Draco for the first time since they’d started sitting together at the Lake. “It doesn’t look like a textbook.”
Draco laughed, “That’s ridiculous. Firstly, because even if there were magical jellyfish, they’d be in the ocean, they’re saltwater creatures, Potter, goodness. And secondly, the only thing you’ve got to worry about killing you are the mermaids, and they probably know about the task already, so I don’t think they’ll
I know there's child abuse in the tags of this story, but I still thought I'd give a warning! Child abuse is briefly referenced in this chapter.
Harry hadn’t expected his name to come out of the Goblet of Fire. He hadn’t expected to be rushed into an interview with the other three students who’d been picked, and he certainly hadn’t expected for Ron to not believe him when he said he didn’t put his name in the stupid Goblet. But now he had Ron angry with him, Hermione wouldn’t talk to him about it, there was going to be an article about him in the
In his dreams he would slam Draco against a wall and kiss him. He was so angry, and so hurt, and he would take the boy’s pale body in his arms and bury his face in the taller boy’s chest. Draco would reach down, tip up his chin and Harry would kiss him, right on the mouth that he so wished he could smother, suffocate. He thought of shoving a hand down Draco’s throat, crushing his windpipe from the inside out. He thought of Draco breaking his arms and legs and leaving him still breathing in a graveyard, unburied.
Dudley kept pestering him. Kept laughing at him. Harry had been waking up screaming and at first his uncle had given him a good whack for it, but he must’ve given up after the first two weeks of it. He certainly wasn’t pleased with Harry’s nightmares though – he kept giving Harry extra chores to “make up” for all the troubled sleeping he was causing everyone else in the house. As if Harry himself was sleeping very well.
“Don’t you ever think you’ll be caught down here?” Draco asked abruptly. He’d never spoken before while they had been together at the Lake. “The Lakeshore isn’t exactly hidden if someone were to really look outside.”
“Well, Granger socked me in the nose last year and it was a bit of a wakeup call, I suppose.” Draco bit his lip and looked out at the Lake. “I grew up hearing all about Pureblood purity and my father using…that word so it was normal for me. And that’s awful, I know that now, so I’m trying to fix it. As for why…well,” Draco took a sharp breath. “I don’t quite like kids calling me a soon-to-be Death Eater. I know its not the same thing but…I don’t want to be thought of like that anymore. I just want to get through school normally, like anyone else.” He rubbed his hands together. “I figured the first step to becoming a better person was to well…be better. Its been weird, having to rewire what’s been so engrained into me from my father but…I like to think that I’m doing better – being better.”
Draco hadn’t seen where Harry had gone, but he definitely didn’t want to be caught by Filch, definitely didn’t want to scrape tables. And then he felt a warm hand grip his wrist and spin him around to the wall, and Draco was staring straight into the eyes of Harry Potter.
“You really need to get some sleep, Harry.” Hermione said at breakfast. “You’ve been looking tired a lot lately, but you’ve got awful dark circles now!”
Harry walked through the corridor, his cloak over him, and he glanced down the hall leading to the dungeons before making his way back out to the Lake. He wondered if Malfoy was still trying to follow him around. He sat against the tree he’d seen Malfoy leaning on that first night, pulled his knees to his chest, and looked up at how the moonlight bled through the tree leaves.
They're finally starting to open up more to each other...more will come, though. I'm thinking of extending this fic past 4th year, MAYBE writing the rest of the series?? I don't know, but if you guys would like that let me know! I have some ideas in the works if I do. I wrote this chapter in a bit of a frenzy last night, so hopefully there aren't too many mistakes I missed in editing. Also sorry that this chapter is short! I'm hoping to write longer chapters in the future but we'll see lol.
“Every day they would remind me that they didn’t want me – that I was just a baby dumped on their doorstep.” He took a breath. “I didn’t learn about magic until I finally got my letter for school. And my family tried everything they could to keep me from finding out. When I finally got here, I was so happy. People here were excited to see me, and it was this whole new world! I was never allowed out much as a kid, and suddenly I find out that I’m able to do all these things, in a place that seems so unreal. My first year was mostly fun, until the first attempt at my murder. Well, I suppose it was technically the second attempt Voldemort made on my life. But then it happened again second year. Third year, I suppose it wasn’t Voldemort directly, but either way, I nearly died again. This year I’ve already had my life at risk twice. Every day I wonder if I would be better off at home, I wonder what would be worse. But then, I suppose I keep coming here for a reason, either out of a sense of guilt – I’m the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy after all, they wouldn’t let me get away, and I don’t know if I would feel right in leaving it all behind. But still I’m left contemplating which is worse. I’ve come to think home is worse. At least I have people to talk to here, and some sense of freedom. I don’t have that at home.” Harry finished. Draco reached out for Harry’s hand. Harry took it.
Harry and Ron sat down with Neville and Hermione at a small table with a crystal ball as their professor pulled out a large star chart. Harry was just glad he didn’t need to pay any attention – he rested his chin in his hands, elbows on the table, and let himself drift off.
Harry woke to a dark dorm room. He could hear Seamus snoring across from him, and Ron turned over in his bed. The room felt…too small. Harry felt so stupid – this dorm was so much larger than that stupid cupboard, and he’d managed in that for 11 years, why couldn’t he handle being in a damn room? He was breathing hard. Harry grabbed his glasses off the nightstand and left the room, putting a temporary silence charm over the door so he didn’t wake anyone else.
“It’s boring. You know what’s going to happen, everyone dies, or someone kills their wife or their husband or someone or other is a ghost. So why bother reading it?”
“Slytherin common room is in the dungeons, yeah? We’ve got a big window looking out at the lake. The mermaids like to scare the first years.” Draco smiled. “They’re rather good at it, too.”
“Yeah.” Harry said. “They are.” He laid down next to Draco and looked at the constellations. The sky was clear tonight.
“This doesn’t make any sense, Malfoy.” Harry flapped his arms uselessly in the water, keeping his feet planted firmly in the mud. The water wasn’t even up to his shoulders. “Can’t I just like…doggy paddle or something?”
Harry looked at him. “I’m glad that you’re trying.” He said, crossing his arms. “You’re so different than how I thought you were.”
Harry was worried. Or as worried as he seemed to ever get about these kinds of things. He’d written to Sirius the week before, and his godfather had started sending him owls daily. Harry was working on spells with Ron and Hermione, getting ready for the third task. As with the previous two tasks, he just hoped that he wouldn’t die.
Draco couldn’t fathom why Granger and the Weasel hadn’t stormed up to him, asking him about Potter and why he’d been spying on him last night. Unless, he thought, Potter hadn’t told them. Now that he thought about it, it was curious that Potter had been alone, without either of his Gryffindor friends by his side (as they almost always seemed to be). He glanced over at Harry, only to see him smiling with his friends as though last night hadn’t happened. He never looked over at the Slytherin table, like he usually did (often to give Draco a dirty look) during breakfast. Harry left for classes with his friends and it was like nothing at all had ever happened.
“I don’t like going home either, Malfoy. I’m not judging you.” Harry pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself. He looked down. If Malfoy was lying about being his friend, now would be the time for him to laugh. But he didn’t.
“S’okay, honestly.” said Harry. He was looking out at the water, orange in the glow of the sunset. “I’ve been practicing anyway.”
“Still,” Draco said. “It was more than most people would do.” They sat down. The grass was cold. It would snow tomorrow, it was inevitable. “What are you going to do?”
“I’m messing with you, Potter.” Draco laughed. “I’m taking Pansy. Millicent is still unawares of dear Pansy’s affections, so she’s stuck going with me for now.”
They made their way through the woods, wands lit up in their hands. Harry grinned. “You know there’s a giant spider living in here right?”
Hello! Sorry, this chapter is coming later than I expected. I had a lot of schoolwork to do, plus I had a flare up from my chronic pain, so I've had a bit of a week if you know what I mean haha. I hope you're all doing well, and that you like this chapter! Please let me know what you think!! Comments mean the world to me <3
He sat on the sand with his legs crisscrossed and took a few deep breaths. He listened carefully to the water lapping at the shore, to the crickets in the grass and the gentle stirring of the giant squid sleeping at the bottom of the lake, and closed his eyes.
about the tournament now. He hadn’t wanted to be a part of it in the first place, and now it was just another thing he had to get through.
Harry’s body, possessed, jerking and broken and painful, his eyes rolled back into his skull and he was sure he would be dead. But he could hear their laughter. And then Harry was holding his wand again, and Voldemort was telling Harry to bow, and there was nothing but the feeling of his flesh being pulled apart pore by pore as they fought. Harry saw Cedric, and his parents, and the light surrounding them was golden and Harry felt as though he would go deaf from the sound of the Death Eaters, laughing and screeching like banshees at the sight. And then it was over, and Harry was running for the Cup – the Portkey – holding tight to Cedric’s body as the air around him screamed.
Draco put his hands on his hips, “It would be nicer to have a pool, I’ll admit. I’m not a huge fan of mud.”
“You don’t have to talk to me if you don’t want to, but you don’t own the Lake,” Draco said, “so if you don’t mind, I was going to study.” He pulled a book from his bag and sat down in the grass. Harry didn’t object and walked back over to the shore to sit by himself. What would be the point in arguing?
“You ought to go to the hospital wing, Harry, I’m sure Madame Pomfrey could get you some Sleeping Draught if it’s keeping you up.” Hermione took a bite of her eggs. “You’re not gonna survive the Second Task if you can’t stay awake!”
Harry couldn’t move, tied to the headstone he couldn’t move, could only stare at Cedric’s body lying not twenty yards from him, both of their wands and the Triwizard cup beside him. Then Wormtail dragged a cauldron in front of him, a snake – Nagini – circling the tombstone. The rest was hazy – the grave beneath Harry’s feet cracked open, and Wormtail cut off his own hand at the wrist. The sound of his flesh tearing, cutting into the bone – and the soft thud of his dismembered hand falling into the cauldron. Harry squeezed his eyes shut; he didn’t want to see this. He couldn’t see this. He shouldn’t. And then Wormtail slid the sharp end of the knife against Harry’s arm, and his skin felt like it was burning, and he could hear Wormtail muttering,
Luckily, Cedric had told him to take the egg to the bathroom, because Harry had told him before about the dragons. So, Harry did – he snuck out in the night to take a bath in the Prefects bathroom only to be laughed at by Moaning Myrtle as she tried to dive beneath the bath water to get a look at him. He opened the egg and heard its siren song, looked at the stained-glass window across from him of a beautiful mermaid, and left as quickly as he could manage. He needn’t be laughingstock for a ghost.
“Nah. I stuck to the shallows for the most part. Besides,” Harry said, “I didn’t know if you were coming back.”
He saw Malfoy and rounded the corner, throwing his invisibility cloak on. Why was that git still following him? Hadn’t he scared him off? Harry heard Draco’s footsteps as he too, came around the corner, when Harry realized Draco looked like he was going back to the dungeons. He wasn’t following him, then. Probably.
Harry had slept for two hours at least, before he’d woken up from a nightmare. He’d had a nightmare the night before too, but he was apprehensive to leave, considering Malfoy had followed him the night before. He’d ended up only managing to toss and turn all night, not getting a moment’s more rest. It’d been two days now though, so Harry figured he should be alright (though he kept glancing around the corridors in fear of being found by teachers or Malfoy). Harry thought about going to the Quidditch pitch, but it was far too open, and the full moon was too bright – he didn’t want to be spotted. So Harry made his way to the Great Lake again.
He unlocks the door to his flat, kicks off his shoes and puts his coat away. He also steps out of the ill-fitting jeans that he used to impersonate Jamie Cadogan. The sitting room looks the same as it always has, but after all that’s happened today, it feels… emptier than usual. He turns on the telly, hoping the background noise will make it feel more welcoming, but it doesn’t really work, so he turns it back off and starts rummaging through the kitchen cupboard for something to eat. There’s a half-eaten box of corn flakes and some less-than-crispy digestives. He eyes the menu from the curry place on the corner, which he’s stuck on the inside of the cupboard door with Spellotape. No. He’s not in the mood to go back out, and he doesn’t have a Muggle phone, so he can’t order in. Maybe he should get one. It’s a primarily Muggle building, and there’s only a minimal amount of magic around to keep it from working… But the only Muggles he knows are the Grangers and Dudley, so he’s never gotten around to it before.
"Yeah. He offered me a trainee position after the war. In case I wanted to escape all the publicity."
He hears Malfoy hit the ground with a satisfying thump. And then the anti-Apparition charms are lifted. Bludger’s mate grabs the young man in the tattered cloak by the arm and Disapparates.
Draco has started walking again, and he hurries to catch up. They step into the fireplace, and he wraps an arm around Draco’s waist to keep him steady while they travel. It’s time to go home.
Harry can’t help the answering smile stretching slowly across his own face. Ron and Hermione really are the perfect couple, and he’s so happy to have witnessed them going from friends to lovers to the settled couple with a baby they are now. They really deserve their happiness after everything that’s happened. He mentally shakes himself. An end of the week trip to the pub with his colleagues is not the time or the place to be sentimental.
Harry runs a hand over his face, trying, and probably failing, to hide his frustration with the tiny quivering elf. She’s wearing what looks like a frilly kitchen curtain draped like a toga, and a crochet doily as a floppy hat. Her feet are dangling off the chair, and her hunched shoulders and wobbling lower lip make her look like a small, frightened child. Harry pastes on his most patient smile and tries again.
“Harry!” Rose runs at him and wraps her chubby arms around his legs, nearly tripping him. “Are you going to play with me?”
“Okay. I’ve got the Portkey to get us there. It’s touch activated. Want to do the Disillusionment yourself, or swap?”
Draco pulls back enough to stare at him, and Harry has to force himself to meet his eyes. A rejection now is going to hurt like hell, and it’s not only his pride that’ll be smarting, he realises.
He can hear Fifi letting Hestia and Williamson in. Draco’s words echo in his mind. It has too great a potential for evil. He makes sure Matt and Bludger aren’t watching. The he hurriedly shrinks the cup and  wraps it up in his handkerchief. It feels heavy in his hand, and he’s almost afraid to touch it, despite the protective fabric. He stuffs it deep into his pocket, and focusses on his colleagues, who are being shown into the dining room.
Ron fights his way free of the Cloak, and runs towards the shed, but before he gets there, the tell-tale sound of Apparition tells them that it’s too late.
“Right.” Ron casts a quick glance at the window. “To summarise, you admit to taking bribes from a prisoner, conspiring to cause harm to innocent witches and wizards and housing a fugitive?”
Savage looks at him for so long that he has to consciously keep himself from squirming like a Hogwarts first year, unable to answer a question in Snape’s potions class. Then she nods curtly.
Harry shakes his head. “Not right now, to be honest. But it might, once we get the books sorted and find out if there are any pages missing.”
Draco doesn’t answer, but his eyes open sluggishly, and he blinks up at him a few times. Fifi appears with a vial of sparkly liquid, and he presses it to Draco’s lips.
“His name is Adrian Wright. He’s in his fifties, pureblood, the family were known supporters of Voldemort, but he never took the Mark... or maybe it was never offered to him. His family lost everything after the first war and he’s been keeping to himself ever since, with the exception of trips to the Muggle shops in the village a few times a week for cigarettes and beer. His last known contact with the magical world was a Floo call a few weeks ago by his sister. Davies and his partner are trying to contact her. She’s the only living relative.”
“I used to hide behind the cypress over there.” He points at a huge tree on the other side of the small square.
“Oui. There are two men there. They are in the dining room, and they are drinking Monsieur’s best wine. Fifi tried to stop them, but they said that Monsieur Lucius sent them here.” She wrings her hands. “Fifi knows that Monsieur Lucius is no longer a respectable wizard, but he is still a Malfoy and Fifi must do as he commands.”
“Sorry, boss,” says the young one. He tugs on his tattered cloak sleeve, drawing it down to meet his stained glove.
Does he? Harry’s not really sure. Hermione’s Draco’s friend, and she’s probably more than willing to help… but she’s also really grumpy when she doesn’t get her sleep. Then again... perhaps a grumpy Unspeakabe is exactly what they need.
Harry doesn't want to see the inside of St. Mungo's ever again, if he can help it. He holds Draco's gaze for a second. Then he lifts his arm slightly.
“Now, let’s try this again. Do you see this memo? That’s a SDEA autorisation. Do you know what that means? It means that if you don’t comply with the veritaserum, I’m authorised to bring an Unspeakable in here and have her Legilimise you. So, I’m going to need to know which it’ll be.”
He extracts the memory of what happened, before thinking about it too much can make his own thoughts interfere with the pure sensory memory. When he’s drawn the silver strand from his temple, he stoppers the vial, and closes his eyes, letting the conversation between the Death Eaters unfold again in his mind. Fuck, he misses Ron right now! Going over this by himself feels all kinds of wrong. He tries to look at the information from all angles, but somehow, knowing that he can’t bounce his ideas back and forth with Ron keeps tripping him up.
Harry feels like he’s about to be sick. He looks at Draco and Hermione, and they both look like they’re in shock. Hermione is pale as a ghost, and Draco… two bright red spots are visible on his cheeks, and he looks like he’s fighting to stay upright. He’s gritting his teeth, and Harry can see the muscles in his jaw throb. He looks livid.
“They went inside.” He buries his head in his book again, but adds, “You’re welcome to wait here, if you want.”
“Your father? But he’s in Azkaban!” Harry blurts, and immediately wants to kick himself. Hard. Malfoy bloody well knows that his own father is in prison. Behaving like a bumbling idiot probably won’t exactly make him any more cooperative.
“The interesting thing is, in the Iron Age, caries were associated with wealth and aristocracy. Poor people had quite healthy teeth.” Draco leans back in his chair and takes his elbows off the table, so Harry can set a plate down.
They’re sitting on the sofa with a stack of take away containers spread across the coffee table. Rose is sleeping soundly, her head resting against Ron’s thigh and her feet in Harry’s lap. Harry can’t stop thinking about Hermione’s suggestion from earlier. Apparently, neither can Ron.
Of course this is the wrong thing to say. Before he knows it, Hermione is yanking at his arm, casting a diagnostic charm on the perfectly healed skin where the burn used to be, and muttering about stupid boys and how he’s so  stubborn that he hasn’t been to see a healer. Harry glances helplessly at Ron, but he just shakes his head in mock sadness and mouths, “Draco,” while rolling his eyes. Unhelpful bastard!
Harry doesn’t really know, but his imagination immediately suggests a range of scenarios, one more scary than the other. In case someone breaks out of prison and takes their boat. In case there’s a storm coming. In case someone tries to sabotage it, to prevent them from leaving. This place is making him paranoid.
“Erm… My foot’s not broken.” It’s not a lie. At least it’s not broken right now. But Ron isn’t that easy to fool.
“Mother really enjoys spending time here. Particularly in summer. She wears dresses with floral patterns and goes shopping at the farmers market.”
"No. But I think I know why you do. You're a half-blood. I think that's why it’s reacting to you. I can disable it, but I may need your help."
“It’s a nice broom,” Ron says. “You should talk to Davies,” he mutters under his breath. “Get him to take Jamie Cadogan in for a friendly chat about illegal potions. That way, you’ll be able to avoid him at the match.”
Harry feels his blood run cold. Taking the magic form Muggleborns and leaving them as Squibs sounds horrible. He tries to picture Hermione without her magic, and… he can’t. He shudders.
“He’s healthy, physically, but there’s no sign of his magic returning,” Hermione replies. The wobble in her voice is almost inaudible, especially to someone who doesn’t know her well.
“That filthy bastard!” he grits out. “This was nothing but a fucking guilt trip. What a bloody waste of time! Fuck!” Draco’s fist collides with the wooden table, and the small vial tumbles to the floor and rolls toward the fireplace. Harry suspects that it takes a lot to make Draco snap these days. He’s obviously witnessing something that not many people get to see: Draco Malfoy being completely honest about how he feels.
The ripped page describes how to create a vessel to store stolen magic. It also mentions a ritual to free the magic from the vessel, but the printed text doesn’t go into any detail about how to perform it. Harry and Ron are trying to make sense of the few letters left in the margin, when a red faced MLE officer knocks on the partition.
“Not here. Mother will have a fit if she hears about this and can’t fuss over me herself! We should go back, and I’ll go to St Mungo’s.” Draco looks down at the bandage. “But I don’t think I can Apparate or Floo. I don’t want to risk it starting to bleed again while we’re in transit. I’ll be fine on my broom, as long as we don’t fly too high and fast.”
“Right. And you’ve already set up Surveillance Charms on the meeting places Smith told you about, which means that you won’t need our help right now. All you have to do is wait for someone to do something stupid. I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long with that lot.”
Draco narrows his eyes slightly and raises his wand again. He doesn’t even have time to get nervous, not really. Then he feels his hair being tugged this way and that, before it settles into some elaborate style that’s not at all like his usual scruffy look.
“Don’t worry. I’ve had worse. And from people whose opinions means more to me.” He closes his eyes for a moment letting the memories flash by. Molly, asking him if he isn’t at least bisexual, and choking on the word, because it’s probably the first time she’s ever said it out loud. And Hermione, his best friend, reminding him that all he’s ever wanted is a normal life. As if that’s still not what he wants. As if what he had with Philippe, and what he has now is abnormal somehow. He opens his eyes and smiles at Malfoy. “Besides, who am I to complain, when someone insinuates that I’m having a relationship with a good looking bloke?”
“Bloody hell!” He looks over at Ron and finds him trying to dislodge a Kneazle that seems to have decided to climb his leg. He’s looking so disgusted that Harry bursts into a very inappropriate laugh. After all, this is a murder scene.
Harry can’t help smiling. “Yeah, mate. You probably are.” He holds open the door to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and gallantly gestures for Ron to enter first.
“Please do, Weasley.” Malfoy opens the door and holds it for them, and they have to squeeze by him to step outside. Malfoy smells like fresh air and expensive shampoo, and Harry can’t help a tiny shiver running down his back. He turns back and belatedly shouts a goodbye, just as the door is closed with a snap.
Draco turns slightly and looks at him. There’s something new in his eyes… something more honest than he’s ever seen from Draco.
“It must be in his old study. Mother had the elves lock it up after the war. I think everything is as he left it.” His smile fades. “Including the curses. I’m not sure we’ll be able to get in there, at least not right now. It could take days to dismantle the wards.”
Harry stares at the small print on the memo-plane, and bangs his head against his desk in frustration. Ron pokes his head around the flimsy wall separating their cubicles.
“Fuck! Harry! You’re so fucking perfect like this! Letting me use you. Letting me fuck myself on your cock,” Draco breathes, the words hot across his ear, and he shudders and bucks against him, chasing the feeling of Draco clenching tight around his cock.
Does he? He cradles his head in his hands and closes his eyes. He’s been so sure that Draco’s innocent, but… a statement under Veritaserum is hard to argue against. And yet, all he sees in his mind is Draco looking at him with those dark circles under his eyes, swearing that he hasn’t done anything, without knowing what he’s even charged with. Fuck!
“Wait! His sleeve. See that cufflink? The engraving is charmed. Looks like some sort of cup or trophy with a snake slithering around on it.”
“Maybe not. Rose ripped out some pages from a few of Hermione’s books before she child-proofed her library.” Ron grimaces, and Harry can understand why. He can just about picture the look on Hermione’s face when she found her precious books torn and abused.
“Auror Weasley! You are out of order!” Savage says. She doesn’t particularly sound like she disagrees, though.
”Those artefacts are more than four thousand years old, Potter, and the only thing holding them together is the charms I put on the bag. Don’t damage them.”
He looks down into big brown eyes. He misses this, he realises. These last few days have been so busy, and except for reading to her yesterday, he hasn’t really had time to play with his goddaughter. He really wishes he could tell her yes. He shakes his head.
He puts his foot on the floor carefully, and when that doesn’t hurt, he tries to stand. There’s still a throbbing sort of dull pain, like there might have been some spraining along with the fracture, but other than that, he’s fine.
Shit. The one condition they’ve agreed on before coming here is that they won’t give Malfoy any kind of information, just in case he decides to tip off his old Death Eater buddies. But he has to agree with Hermione. This new Malfoy doesn’t seem evil. Infuriating, yes, but not actively malicious.
“Yes, Ma’am!” Ron scrambles to his feet. Harry hurries to follow him. They’re already at the door when Savage starts giving orders to the other teams about border monitoring and extra protection for the Muggle Prime Minister.
The little elf hands Draco a jar and a vial of potion. He leaves a soft-looking light blue t-shirt on the table and disappears with a bow.
“I… Look, I know I’ve said it before, and I know you don’t want to hear it, but I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have barged in there like that. It was such a stupid mistake to make.”
“We’ll just tell them that I swerved off course because of my leg, and you had to do a Wronski Feint. It dropped out of your pocket when you saved my life with your mad flying skills.”
“I’ve set up the Pensieve in my study. It’s down there, to the left.” Draco indicates a corridor, and gestures for them to move first.
The missing page is towards the back. Ron turns a few pages, and Harry leans over his shoulder to read the chapter title, Magic Theft.
The three of them are sitting in Ron and Hermione’s cosy kitchen, warming their hands on steaming mugs of tea and nibbling on Ron’s home baked biscuits. The photo is on the table between them, and Hermione is tracing the drawing with a finger.
Voldemort stands up, and Nagini slithers to his side. Lucius remains kneeling, but bows his head almost to the ground.
Harry sinks into his chair and peeks around the screen at Ron’s desk. The mug of tea he left almost a week ago is still there, on top of a half finished pile of paperwork. Of course Ron’s desk looks the same. He’s stared at it every day for a week, not wanting to clean it, because that’d mean admitting that Ron isn’t coming back soon enough to do it himself. He doesn’t know why he’d expected it to be any different, but somehow, after all that’s happened, the normalcy of it is startling. He banishes the half empty mug to the kitchen with a sloppy flick of his wand, secretly hoping that it’ll hit Donovan in the face on its way there.
“None of that, now, Harry,” Percy tuts. “I’m sure you’re all aware that Harry is an old family friend,” he says to the reporters, and maneuvers Harry to stand next to him, giving the photographers room to capture a shot of them both, with Dumbledore looking benevolent in the background and the Magical Brethren off to one side. Harry suddenly wants to throw up.
He collects the pieces of paper he’s strewn all over his desk, and finds a clean sheet of stationery.  Of all the stupid, reckless things he’s done over the years, this could very well be the worst, he thinks, while he pens a quick message to Narcissa Malfoy, that her son is safe and he’s doing everything he can to get him released.
“I have no idea! The wards have been set to accommodate anyone with a warrant, ever since the war, so they were able to Apparate right into the hall. They scared the elves half to death. They told me that I was being arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity, and brought me here. Then they told me they’d see me in the morning, and they left.”
Ron narrows his eyes. He stands up, places his hands flat on the table and leans towards Howards. “Veritaserum!” he hisses.
“Listen to this: Stealing Magic also known as Theft Spells is used when a witch or wizard wishes to acquire the magic of other witches or wizards. This is not your everyday Unforgivable, for it goes against the very nature of magic to be transferred from one individual to another. Only very few have tried to do this, and fewer still have succeeded.” She points at where the page has been ripped out. “And look! There were handwritten notes in the margin here.”
“Look, I’m not a bloody Blast-Ended Skrewt for you to experiment on! Just leave me alone, and work out how to perform the bloody ritual!”
A tension he didn’t even know he’d been carrying leaves his shoulders, and he envelopes his friends in a tight hug, not caring that they’re standing in the middle of the Ministry. “I’m so happy for you!” he whispers into Ron’s shoulder and Hermione’s hair.
He throws the duvet over the shirt, and goes to take a quick shower. It’s not as if he actually needs one, he muses, while massaging shampoo into his hair. He washed twice during the one he had last night. Once before wanking furiously to the thought of Draco kissing him and running his fingers all over his body, and once after. God! He’s actually turning into a seventeen year old! He shakes his head. This is exactly why Draco said they should wait until the case is over to see where this… thing is going. And it’s also exactly why waiting is a bad idea! There’s no way he won’t be thinking about that kiss all day!
Harry remembers too. There’s a vivid flash in his mind of scorching heat, wiry arms around his waist, a chest pressed against his back, and shallow puffs of breath in his ear. He shakes it off quickly. He hasn’t thought about Draco Malfoy in years, and he’s not about to begin now.
They scuttle back with offended murmurs, but the shade of Ron’s face doesn’t leave any doubt that he wants to be left alone. And, Squib or not, no one is going to challenge him when he’s wearing that expression.
Malfoy stops in front of Harry and just stands there, looking at him. Harry doesn’t really know what to do. Those grey eyes are so intense, and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen that particular expression in them before. There’s plenty of pride there, but also a hint of something else. Hurt? Apprehension? Worry? It’s hard to tell, but he looks like he actually cares if Harry believes him.
Harry rolls his eyes and tries to slip by unnoticed. He needs to extract a memory of this. And buy a ticket to the Tornadoes vs. Puddlemere game tomorrow. Unfortunately, Percy seems to have other ideas.
They land on a soft carpet and Harry recognises Draco's study. Then he's being pushed into a soft chair and strong hands are gripping his shirt and ripping it off. Or rather, it's ripped from his torso and down one arm. Draco kneels in front of him and pushes his knees apart, and he’s too frozen with pain and confusion to do anything but make room for him between his thighs. Then those fingers go from forceful to gentle, as they cradle his wounded arm and carefully peel the wet fabric away from burned skin. But no matter how gentle Draco is, it still hurts like hell. Harry clenches his teeth and focuses on keeping his breathing slow and steady.
He looks around and finds the room empty, except for a small knot of healers in their lime green robes, who are having a conversation that involves lots of whispering and pointing at a clip board, and a bored looking young wizard behind the reception desk. He walks over, and has to clear his throat several times, before the young man looks up from his magazine.
“I want to help you,” Malfoy says. “But it won’t be without personal consequence to do so. I need to know if I can trust you to keep a secret, and I need to know that you trust me to have Hermione’s best interests at heart. If you still don’t believe that I can be trusted with information, then it’s simply not worth it to me. I won’t risk it.”
