“It had tons of information about other cases like this, and examples of contracts. Thought it would help, I guess sometimes two brains aren’t better than one.”
“The hyena tree, or the Alihotsy tree, is a plant whose leaves can produce bouts of uncontrollable laughter.” Draco panted each word out, trying to breathe through small giggles. Harry looked over to him and watched him wipe a tear away. His stomach flipped over. A real snowflake drifted onto his face, cold and wet. It cooled him down pleasantly and he started to regain some of his senses.
It felt a lot nicer to walk in with Luna than by himself, Harry’s body was almost completely un-tensed by the time they had made it to the long table. It was covered in all matter of delicious looking pastries. Harry recognised Hermione’s handwriting labelling a dish ‘apple crumble’ and plonked his container next to it.
Draco opened his mouth, most likely about to say something along the lines of ‘certainly not!’ but before he could get anything out, Blaise piped up.
Harry had started scanning the area again, for anyone he was comfortable with talking to when the whole place became deathly silent. A stark contrast to the joyous energy wafting in the air only moments ago. Laughter was replaced with whispers and Harry’s heart started racing. Everyone must have finally spotted him and were spreading rumours, or, maybe some dark entity had decided to crash the party and he was expected to fend it off. His eyes darted this way and that and finally settled on the archway entrance.
“Where’s my plate, love?” Arthur asked when Molly set a place in front of the three of them and missed him.
were heavy, large tomes wrapped in brown paper that made his bag slip down his shoulder from their weight.
Hermione’s face exploded into an eye-crinkling smile, “Thank you so much!” and she handed over her collection. What could have only been three or four books, it felt like Harry was carrying a whole library. He should find less academically inclined friends, he supposed that was what made Ron so great. Or maybe he should follow their lead and read until his brain rotted. Yet Harry couldn’t remember the last book he read. Wait, that was a lie, the last book he read was
The kitchen was surprisingly tidy when he walked in, a few old recipe books tucked under one arm. Harry had found them stuffed in the very back of a bookcase, they were falling apart in his hands but there had to be something good in one of them. Kreacher was standing on a wooden crate over one of the great big sinks and looked up at the sound of floorboards creaking. The old house-elf looked surprised to see him.
Civil, that was the word for it. Civil and nothing more. Although the Slytherin’s were still in a corner of the snowy lakeside all on their lonesome, they were there and it was a start. The rest of the Eighth Years were speckled around, some on the lake and some making snowmen. It was peaceful and relaxing, some might say a bit too peaceful.
“Yes, Draco?” No one else was left on the lakeside, just him and Draco. Alone. “Do you need something?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pansy was yelling more than whispering at him, sitting next to him in Charms. Blaise was on his other side, staying blissfully quiet, and Harry was across from him. No one else had bothered him so far, he hadn’t really expected them to anyway. The next edition of the Daily Prophet wouldn't be released until next week. After the second trial. Draco shuddered at the thought of going through that excruciatingly painful ordeal once more.
Draco took a deep breath, “I’m fine, used to it even, I just don’t want you to get hurt by being seen with me.”
Before Harry even had a chance to greet her, Molly was setting down plates of rolls and tubs of butter.
Percy’s confidence had grown exponentially as the morning progressed, the shaking was gone and his words were less aggravating to listen to. Draco gave him a terse and concise smile as he stood to deliver his final point. He wanted this to be over.
The first batch of so-called ‘biscuits’ that Harry took out of the oven was a complete and utter failure and Harry remembered then that there was a reason why it was always him doing the brunt of the cooking and Aunt Petunia making the fancy, posh desserts. The bin was looking decidedly fuller as he scraped yet another tray into it. It took him a miserable three hours to make something even half edible enough to give to other people.
“Nice to meet you too, Henry,” his hand shook hard when Harry took it and he couldn’t tell if that was the tremors or the boy trying to give him a handshake.
Ron fixed him with a stare that he felt saw into his very soul but kept his mouth shut and then smiled at him, for which Harry was insanely grateful. There was nothing else he felt he could say. Hermione didn’t seem nearly as satisfied but Ron came up behind her and put his hand on her shoulder. She seemed to understand what that meant and neither of them said anything else for a while like they were having their own psychic conversation. ‘Love is weird.’ Harry thought as he took the container out of Ron’s hand, pulled out a piece of fudge and sank into it happily. It tasted stupidly sweet, but most of all, it tasted like Molly’s love.
“Of course, and it’s not a Christmas party,” Hermione replied after a moment. She finally moved away from Ron and sat down on one of the dusty sofas.
“So are you guys going to Luna’s Christmas party?” Harry asked, mouth still full. He spoke more for conversation's sake than anything else. It seemed Ron and Hermione had forgotten where they were and that Harry was standing not even a metre away. They pulled out of their rose coloured love daze as he spoke.
Harry’s steps sped up as he looked wildly from side to side, along each corridor he passed. Finally, he spots the back of a Slytherin robe slouched, hobbling away. Harry calls out as he reaches Draco.
Harry pulled his head back into the compartment and sat down with a huff. Ron offered him a chocolate frog with a face that said ‘I’m sorry you have to leave your boyfriend and are sad about it, here have a sweet as comfort’.
Harry turned to Draco, amused, only to find him bashfully looking away, scuffing his fancy leather shoes in the snow.
Percy sighed, “Alright, I need more evidence to suggest that Lucius is completely unfit to overturn the will. Either that or evidence that Draco is better suited than he is. Sadly, this sort of thing doesn’t happen very often and the few papers I’ve found just repeat the same useless information. It would help if I had some examples of cases or more information.”
“Is that why Blaise and Pansy…?” Draco nodded, “I’m sorry I wasn’t there. I feel like I’ve let them down, let you down.”
“-And never come back here again! You pathetic Death Eater scum! You should be rotting in Azkaban with your crook of a father! I will not have you tarnishing my shop with your dark magic!”
Dean just laughed and balled up another one. Pansy floundered to hide behind Blaise, who had been minding his own business with his head in a magazine.
I wasn't quite happy with this chapter, so I edited it again and have now reposted it. Hopefully, it's a bit better now!
Henry scratched the back of his neck and coughed. He hesitated before answering, “My dad’s a lawyer, I want to... follow in his footsteps one day.”
With the large bag weighing down his walking speed, Harry hauled it over to the counter. As he dropped it heavily down in front of Ambrosius Flume, he noticed the large pile of Daily Prophets stacked in a display case that read ‘Newspaper - 1 sickle’. A large picture of Draco Malfoy covered the entire front page. Camera flashes exploded in his face, forcing him to cover his eyes with one hand. Percy walked in front of him, pushing press out of the way so they could keep walking. The headline screamed out, “DRACO MALFOY TO INHERIT FAMILY FORTUNE, LUCIUS MALFOY BEHIND BARS YET AGAIN - continue on page 4”.
Harry Potter, as great as the stories about him boasted he was, felt he was a terrible coward. He had, without warning, holed himself up in Grimmauld place with only Kreacher and the angry portrait of Walburga Black to keep him company. Walburga’s cries of dismay were better than the mounting pressure of being the Boy Who Lived Twice, Harry reasoned to himself. He pulled his lethargic form out of a dusty old chair with a great deal of effort. A loud groan echoed around the library but he couldn’t tell if it had come from him or the house settling. Harry made his way along the dusty bookshelves, what seemed like hundreds of them in an endless, winding maze. He read the spines of books as he went, searching for something new to read. Harry never used to be that type, but he had picked up a few boring history volumes from amongst the piles and piles of Dark Arts textbooks. There was nothing bloody better to do anyway.
Draco sighed and looked down at his foot, weighing his options. Harry strolled casually towards him.
Draco didn’t say anything for a few moments, just breathed heavily. Harry was about to retract what he’d said and play it off as some sort of sad joke when Draco scooted closer and put his hand over his.
One hour later, the ground was almost visible, its snowy blanket decimated to make ammunition. Everyone was soaking wet and cold. Exhausted, they all packed up and made their way back to the castle. Harry smiled, watching Pansy laugh with Cho and Marietta and Blaise chat with a Hufflepuff boy Harry couldn’t remember the name of.
“Yes, Harry told us a while ago. I still can’t believe it. How can a father want to throw away his only child like that?”
“Good on you, mate! Dream big!” He clapped Henry on the back and the small boy made an odd squeak before trotting off to the other side of the store. “He’s a strange one,” Harry said to himself.
“Oh no, don’t eat that!” he rushed out as Harry brought the muffin to his mouth but it was too late, he had already taken a large bite. He looked up at Draco who was staring at him like he was anticipating something awful to happen. ‘What’s the matter? They’re just Luna’s muffins,’ he wanted to say. Before he could get a single word out, his face had broken into a manic grin and he just could not stop laughing. Loud and unashamed, he laughed so hard that he started to clutch his stomach in pain. He laughed until his sides were burning and his eyes watered. Through the tears, he could see Draco watching him, sympathetically.
That was all it took, in a matter of moments the peaceful lakeside had turned into a battlefield. A happy one for once. The fight became more and more intense, soldiers joining together and then splitting into separate factions. The ice skaters had become land born and were making quick work of Padma and Parvati’s makeshift bunker.
With the small paperback wobbling on top of its larger, heavier counterparts, Harry eventually made his way to Madam Pince’s desk. He dropped the pile on the wood with a sigh of relief and
“Oooh, are these the pastries you’ve brought to share?” She was looking at the container in his hands and Harry was suddenly very embarrassed about the quality.
“I know you can’t comprehend that there are people who want to help you with this but there are. And it helps that your dad is a bit of an arsehole. It means the public might already be swayed to your side.”
Draco spotted Harry then, still standing awkwardly next to the punch bowl. Their gazes lingered on each other for a moment before Draco switched into gear and walked confidently over to him, or rather, to the table.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, “Hello Pansy, Blaise,” he nodded at them and tried to pull Harry along the road, away from the two other Slytherins. They persisted and trotted along close behind.
“That’s what I thought. You both do need to finish that scroll by tonight though, it’s due tomorrow. Come on, then. We should go meet up with them all in the common room.”.
Hermione, ever the all-knowing, was right. As soon as the three of them walked into the Burrow, they were whisked away to the dining table and forced to take a seat. Arthur followed behind them, throwing his brand new enchanted car keys towards a fruit bowl that came flying to catch them.
The whole area looked like an outdoor Yule Ball. ‘Sort of like Bill and Fleur’s…’ Harry’s brain supplied, oh so helpfully. He managed to squash any ‘not fun’ memories by pouring himself a glass of something that looked like punch but smelt like hot chocolate. Harry’s stomach wasn’t quite settled enough to take a sip just yet, so he held the glass awkwardly and looked around. He was in a giant plain, no less than two football fields in size. The place was very well decorated. It seemed like Luna had made a point not to put up anything that looked too Christmas-y. This was, after all, not a Christmas party. Floating, glass snowflakes dazzled ten feet above them like weirdly shaped disco balls. Lanterns carrying bursts of blue fire lined the trimming of a large tent in the centre where tables were laid with plates and glasses. The table of pastries was under its own, special tent off to the side. People were everywhere, dressed in their very best robes. Harry was suddenly happy Hermione had forced him to go out shopping, otherwise, he would have looked like one of the waiters (who were carrying around trays of empty plates, presumably for collecting one's selection of pastries).
I'd like to give a special thanks to vanillacrisp, who leaves lovely comments on every chapter! <3 You have no idea how much that means to me!
Harry turned the book over and over in his hand as he walked back to the dormitory. He flipped through it and checked the inside cover. The Hogwarts Library sticker stared back up at him and he leant his head down to see it better. Harry let out a noise of audible confusion.
“How cute!” She pouted at the blond, “but Draco, I’ve just realised, you haven’t even introduced your bestest friends to your boyfriend yet!”
“I’ve been looking everywhere for you two! Where have you been?” Harry opened his mouth to explain but was immediately interrupted, “Don’t answer that! There’s no time! Malfoy!”
The trail down to the lake was much easier to traverse in the spring. It was clean of snow and flowers brushed his ankles as he walked. Over the crickets buzzing and birds chirping, Harry could hear the boisterous screaming of his friends. They could forgive him for being late, how couldn’t they with all of the sweets he had brought. Though Harry doubted any of them would have the chance to sample them, with Draco’s sweet tooth as strong as it was. He looked up as he passed a particularly familiar rock, looking over the horizon to where the shore was just visible.
“I heard Dean and Seamus talking about snowball fights, I think they’re planning on starting an all-out war, like that Muggle movie Dean was talking about the other day.”
Too far away to hear them over the chatter, Harry tries and fails to read their lips. Parvati chips off some sparkly pink polish from her thumbnail and shifts from foot to foot. She steadies herself, looks directly at Pansy, and speaks.
“I just wanted to see if you were, you know, okay. Why are you limping?” Harry felt reasonably confident as to why, but he didn’t want to bring up the nightly skating before Draco did. As expected, Draco dodged the questions and asked his own.
“Very happy to meet you too, Pansy,” Harry found he couldn’t stop smiling, this was ridiculous. And it became even more so when Zabini strolled over and the whole charade began again.
They squeezed through the Honeydukes entrance, crowded with what seemed to be the entire Hogwarts’ student body. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to keep him close and they began browsing the various tubs of sweets. Draco stopped at every one of them, staring longingly at the colourful treats and pouting at Harry until he would chuckle and pop them into a paper bag for purchase. Ron might have said something about ‘being wrapped around his little pointy finger’ but the look of pure joy on Draco’s face as he tasted tested from tray after tray made it all worth it.
Harry swung around and spotted Luna Lovegood behind him, smiling in that pleasant, whimsical way that only Luna could. He relaxed his shoulders and greeted her with a nod.
“Well,” she began slowly, “I wasn’t going to tell you this at all. I thought it would change your mind about going and I think it’s really important for you to socialise now that you’re ready! And anyway, it might not be true at all! It’s really just a rumour…” She trailed off and looked up at Ron with pleading eyes. Whatever this ‘rumour’ may be, she thought Ron would be able to handle telling Harry better, which was not a good sign at all.
finally made its escape, falling from its throne of paper onto the floor. Harry bent down to pick it up. Madam Pince’s sour face peered over the top of the stack at him and he could almost see the headache begin to form in her head.
Percy pulled out the paper and presented it as evidence, pointing to a part in the scribbled text that said just that. Draco could see Lucius’ grin grow into a large smile and he looked over to Draco and gave a smug smirk. Fairburn straightened his back and looked hopeful. Draco tensed his eyebrows in confusion and ignored them, focusing instead on the carefully crafted case Percy had put together.
“How are things going then, Luna? Is everyone here?” He asked, trying not to sound too desperate or hopeful.
“I should have asked Hermione what she was bringing,” Harry muttered aloud half an hour later, as he scooped handfuls of spilled flour into a small bin. “Or at least asked her to help me.” But honestly, her dragging him and Ron up and down Diagon Alley last week had been enough of her unintentional bossiness. He had never spent that many galleons on one outfit in his life. Harry had already forgiven her for it in his mind though. It gave him a strange sense of comfort to hear Hermione sigh and say, “Honestly!” while sending a loving glare to Ron’s back (as he retreated to return the ugly, orange ‘Chudley Cannons’ sweater to the rack it came from).
Once both of them were well gone, and Harry was helping clear their empty sandwich plates with Kreacher, he couldn’t help but notice he felt a lot happier. The presence of his two best friends gave him new strength, he just hoped it was enough to face the large crowd at Luna’s party. Sadly, he didn’t think any number of hours with Ron and Hermione would give him the strength to face the possibility that
Draco enjoyed the long hours on the ice, forgetting all his troubles and basking in the glory of the power skating gave him.
The whole class turned to watch Draco as he slid into the room. He looked awful. He didn’t even bat an eye when Slughorn took five points away from Slytherin, he just sat down in the nearest empty seat. Right next to Harry.
Hermione stared at him quizzically for a few moments. Harry felt like a confusing art piece in a museum.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They both ignored Ron joining in with a chorus of inappropriate moans as they ran hand in hand, giggling, up the path.
It felt nice, talking to Draco like this. This year was a fresh start for all, it seemed. Draco had changed, maybe more than anyone, after the war. The result of the things he had seen and the events he had been a part of was clear in his demeanour.
Draco smiled, a real genuine smile and it made Harry’s insides do confusing somersaults. Harry had his arm around Draco’s waist, supporting his body weight, just as they were on the way down. This time, as they made their way slowly up the path, it felt infinitely better.
Draco sighed, “It’s not over yet,” he plucked a twig from an empty bush beside him and broke it into little pieces, “though in some ways I wish it was.”
The room broke into whispers and gasps, the judge leaned back and nodded solemnly. The blood trained from Draco’s face and his heartbeat loud in his ears.
Harry and Draco walked together all the way to the Common Room, where they finally parted ways, giving each other small, wordless smiles as they separated.
There it was! He pulled it out from his crumpled book bag, thrown into the farthest corner not to be thought of until school began again. He triumphantly threw it down on top of Percy’s large stack of papers.
Draco’s mouth became unglued and he visibly relaxed again, as glad as Harry that the awkward interaction was coming to an end.
Wilkis Fairburn was a sour-looking man, with a long white moustache and no beard. He looked ancient enough to be a ghost but Draco was not unfamiliar with his appearance. He had been one of his father’s lawyers for as long as he could remember and was most likely the best of all of them. Draco willed away the tears for the hundredth time that day. He thought of Harry and what he might say to him, ‘
I can't believe we're more than halfway through! Thank you so much for reading! I hope I did the drama of this chapter justice...
“‘S no stress! Just a small get together, you can spend the time hanging around us if you like. We’ll hide you behind our backs!” Ron gave him a playful wink and Harry tried to give a meek laugh at his joke. A look of realisation flashed on Hermione’s face.
“I doubt it’s going to be that much of a big deal, don’t worry.” Draco gave him a comforting smile and pecked him on the forehead, leaving him to lean against the stone wall and tap his foot on the floor.
“They’re insufferable and embarrassing,” Harry laughed at Draco’s grimace, “Sorry about them. Let’s go to Honeydukes before they come back to harass us again.”
“Oh, of course, Harry! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to put any pressure on you! Really, it’s just among friends!”
“Come on, Harry! The train’s going to bloody well leave without you! Stop being in love!” Ron shouted out of a compartment window through the steady cloud of steam. Harry floundered at the word use.
Lucius Malfoy had not stopped glaring at Draco since he and Percy had entered. If looks could kill, Draco would be dead cold where he stood.
“Once you're done pruning your feathers, I think it’s only fair you take these,” Draco pointed to the reasonably sized pile of books on Harry’s bed (
Pansy looked genuinely shocked for a moment, eyes wide open and mouth agape. She gathered herself together before giving Parvati a small, hopeful, smile. Smacking Draco’s side and getting up, silently ordering him to follow, she makes her way to her dorm room. Blaise trails after them. Before long they come back, Pansy swinging a pair of ice skates from her arm and the two boys behind her.
“Whatever it is, it’s a bloody good excuse to drink alcohol and eat way too many sweets, so I’m down.”
Harry chuckled and looked down at Draco's fond face as he gazed at his friends. Harry couldn't help it and the threat of a mud pie to the back of the head wasn't so bad, he leaned down again. Draco made a noise of disgust as he tried to continue where they had left off.
Harry stopped where he was standing and waited for Draco to say something. When he didn’t, Harry coughed.
“Absolutely, you’re talking to the champion in that particular department.” Draco laughed as Harry began to slice a plant he didn’t even know the name of.
Draco was lying on his back against a wool blanket. His arm was behind his head, propping him up enough that his closed eyes were visible. There was an empty place next to him, waiting for Harry so he took the invitation and sat down beside him. Draco opened one eye.
Pansy -now clearly their de facto leader, and happy about it- let go of Draco and crossed her arms, speaking with her chin high in the air. She looked like a mother hen protecting her chicks.
“You arse Harry Potter! How could you just walk out on us like that?” Harry was starkly reminded of this time last year and felt shame crawl in his insides as he thought of how distraught Hermione had been over Ron’s disappearance. She didn’t look all that angry at him though, certainly not as angry as she had been at Ron. He saw understanding lingering in her eyes, masked behind the sadness, frustration and relief. As far as an explanation went, Harry didn’t have much to say. He had drafted lines in his head all morning, anything he could say to not come across like a total knobhead. Nothing expressed it all quite right so he simply shrugged and said in the most apologetic tone he could manage,
And without a second glance, he limped over to a large rock and sat down, not dissimilar to a toddler having a tantrum. Harry smiled, finding it surprisingly endearing, maybe even a little cute. He shook his head and went off to find Hermione and Ron.
Madam Pince took it from him and turned it over in her hands, squinting at it. She shrugged and cast the same charm as the others at it. It didn’t move. Harry tilted his head, so did Madam Pince.
Suddenly, Harry remembered Henry and subsequently remembered the small paperback Henry had given him that day in the library.
Harry hesitated before taking it, “No, I’m pretty sure it’s from Hogwarts.” He recalled seeing the Hogwarts library sticker on the back inside cover, “see, look,” he flipped it open and pointed to it.
. In her defence, it would have hit its target dead-on (if Ron hadn’t dodged out of the way on instinct), instead, it hit Dean Thomas directly on the shoulder. He turned his head towards them in shock and smiled before making a snowball of his own and throwing it back.
Without really knowing what had happened, Harry was watching Pansy and Blaise chat happily in front, with an armful of grumbling Malfoy, pointedly looking away from him.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was heavy and on the inside was a large box gift-wrapped in red and green. Harry pulled it out and admired the sparkly ribbon around it.
Percy sat down with a stiff back. It was rehearsed and unbearable to listen to, like nails on a chalkboard.
Harry tunes Neville out as they continue on. The path is strange in the daytime. They pass familiar trees and rocks and roots, yet it all seems different in the bright light of the sun. In Harry’s opinion, things look pretty under the moonlight.
Harry beamed at him. That was a lot purer than he had imagined, though on second thought a first-year trying to sue someone would be a bit far-fetched anyway.
Harry smiled at the beaming sunlight as he walked the path to Hogsmeade. It had melted the snow away, leaving fragrant flower blossoms to take its place. Feeling sentimental, Harry admired the fresh colours as he went, wondering to himself if stopping to sniff them might be a little bit on the ridiculous side of things. He nodded with a bright smile in greeting to every person he passed, who looked shocked for a moment but nodded happily back. Sue him, he was in a good mood.
What would Harry even do if Malfoy did show up? He didn’t feel the same hatred towards him, he didn’t exactly know what he felt. No one had heard anything from Malfoy since the war, some say he fled the country, never to return. Harry had never thought about it very much. He was too busy sulking in his own sadness.
Suddenly, Draco’s hand left his and Harry looked around, only to find him completely gone. In shock, he peered over the crowd to try to spot the tell-tale beacon of blond hair, but the ever-moving wave of customers kept him walking. This had to be some kind of hazard. He mentally apologized before steeling himself and pushing through the sea of people.
Harry looked down at the demented biscuits shoved into a Tupperware container. Feeling sarcastic, he muttered out a terse, “Brilliant.” He was not feeling very optimistic about the next day.
Harry smiled, pleased with himself, and leaned in for a thank you kiss, to which Draco complied. When they pulled away Harry looked to the ground and remembered the paper bag on the blond's arm.
He was cut off by the sound of rushing footsteps flying down the stairs. Percy Weasley appeared in front of the table, waving papers in his hand with wide eyes.
It occurred to Harry only the afternoon before that he did actually have to bring a pastry to share for ‘
“Harry! Are you going to the library?” Hermione came around the corner, with a large pile of books under one arm, he nodded, “I was just going there myself to drop these off.”
“Oh, to hell with it.” He whispered and plucked his own muffin from the plate and popped it into his mouth and then Draco was laughing too, just as loudly as Harry was. If anyone had turned to look at where all the noise was coming from, neither of them noticed.
She looked longingly over to the corner where Draco and Pansy had situated themselves by the fire, already deep into their reading.
“I’m fine, probably a little bruised but that’s no big deal. Do you see now, Harry? People may hate my father but that doesn’t mean they love me!”
He brought the envelope closer to his face to examine it and was immediately assaulted by the smell of pine and gingerbread. It made for an unholy combination.
He’d kissed Draco goodnight before they’d left their parking spot. He’d been right to do so—a ruffle of curtains meant Petunia had been peeking out the window. Harry knew she meant well, and it was only because she cared so much, but just for once, he yearned for a little privacy. He wanted the freedom to kiss his boyfriend—was Draco his boyfriend now?—in private before he went inside. If Petunia was still watching, all she would have seen was two friends shaking hands as they said goodnight. She didn’t see the heat in Draco’s eye or the way he clasped Harry’s wrist, stroking over the tender skin on the inside, which still burned from his touch.
Harry blinked. His heart raced, and for the briefest of moments, his forehead throbbed. But just as quickly, the menacing figure before him shifted again, sprouting long, greasy hair, a hooked nose, and eyes as black as the night sky. Relief surged through Harry’s body, but swiftly turned to annoyance as the man looked down his curved nose at Harry.
It was three nights later when they got their chance. Petunia dropped Harry off at the cinema, but instead of watching
Malfoy leans back in and slips a piece of paper into Harry’s hand. “You get invited back to mine for drinks. Come to this address at eight o’clock tonight. Don’t be late, Potter.” He pulls back, his silver eyes darkened to gunmetal grey. “You’re already on the Naughty List, I’d hate to have to punish you further.”
A Malfoy would never willingly give up even an ounce of their magic. But he was Draco, and not Malfoy, and he would do anything to protect the man he loved.
. First, it was the hair. After all these years, I’d finally got him to wear it neat and tidy. But now it’s messier than ever, all because that boy thinks it’s more stylish that way.
—to touch him. Borrowing one of Draco’s tricks, Harry casts a nonverbal spell and transfigures the gloves so they are fingerless. The tips of his fingers brush along a chiselled cheekbone, warmer than marble but just as perfect.
Draco skipped his customary morning shower in favour of the much faster Cleaning Charms. He dressed quickly and headed out the door.
. Malfoy has that look about him, the one where he’s infuriatingly smug because he knows I’ve cocked things up again.
Second, he used to be camera-shy. That’s why he wasn’t in any of the family photos. He didn’t feel like someone afraid of cameras, but it was nice of the Dursleys to consider his feelings. He felt all right now, so Petunia had taken him to a photography studio, and they had their portrait done. She’d gotten it framed and it now joined the others on the mantelpiece.
. Harry thought about Hermione and Ron, how they had always stood by him. He saw their faces, firm and unyielding, when they told him they were coming with him, that they wouldn’t let him hunt Horcruxes alone. He saw them now, Hermione’s arm wrapped around Ron’s shoulder as they knelt by Fred’s body, surrounded by the rest of the Weasleys. They were home—all of them.
“What you need is rest.” Draco brushed the sweat-slick hair back from Harry’s forehead, and what he saw sent chills down his spine. There was a crack—a lightning bolt—opening like a fissure, the ragged edges red and angry.
Harry calmly walked out into the foyer and over to the cupboard under the stairs. Somehow, he knew he’d find a dustpan there. What he didn’t understand, though, was why he shuddered as he opened the small door. Inside he found an odd assortment of items: an old cot with moth-eaten blankets, old toys (all broken), a small assortment of rabbit-eared books with broken spines, as well as various discarded household items. Harry took a deep breath. The cupboard held unwanted items, normal things to cast aside over the years, yet filled him with inexplicable dread. He snatched the dustpan and returned to the living room, where he knelt and swept up the broken glass. He’d have to give it a good wipe-down later to clean up the sticky traces of whisky.
Malfoy is stunning. Statuesque. He should be on display, in a gallery or a museum, where the masses can congregate and pay homage to his sculpted form. Harry lets his eyes wander over every inch of perfect, alabaster skin. Malfoy’s outfit, if you can call it that, leaves little to the imagination. He’s wearing the most delectable pair of Santa underwear. The black elastic, edged with tufts of white faux fur, has a shiny gold buckle in the center; the fabric, red velvet, is so tiny it barely covers him. Harry’s eyes trace the obvious outline of Malfoy’s cock; soft, but definitely there, and most impressive.
“Draco,” Harry says, his voice whipped away by the wind. “You’re the only one for me.” He gnaws at his lip. “When you died, a part of me died too.”
. Draco’s magic, floral and delightfully tingly, washed over Harry, and the apron became Slytherin green. “Brings out your eyes.” He winked at Harry, and when Harry looked down, the apron said,
“You look beautiful,” Harry said. Hermione wore a floor-length lace gown in navy blue, with her hair styled into a sleek updo. She brought a hand to her waist—her engagement ring sparkled.
Draco kisses Harry fiercely, touching and grabbing, as Harry slowly works himself up and down. Draco slides down in the chair, using his increased leverage as he grabs Harry’s arse, gives it a firm spank, then spreads his cheeks apart, making each thrust feel more intense. The aged leather squeaks with each movement, filling the room with the sounds of their coupling.
As Draco approached the house, with its neatly manicured lawn and perfect hedges, his skin tingled. It was subtle, and at first he took no notice. But as he strode closer, the prickly sensation amplified to searing pain, and the Dark Mark throbbed intensely.
“Harry?” Draco called out. There was no response. Draco sat up and hoped Harry was just in the loo, but the knot of anxiety building in the pit of his stomach told him exactly what the cold bed meant: Harry was gone. The letter on his desk confirmed it.
Draco kissed Harry’s lips gently, basking in the afterglow. He couldn’t tell him the truth. Not now. Maybe never. This was everything he had ever wanked over, and he wanted more. Sex with Harry was like a drug, one taste, and he was addicted. Instead of coming clean and telling the truth, he agreed to another date.
“Believe me, I want to, Draco. But there are bars on this window, and she’s bolted my door shut. I can’t get out.”
It was a shock to hear Petunia described as such—a stark contrast to the woman he’d come to know, respect and love. Petunia loved Dudley so dearly and always spoke so fondly of him. But then he remembered Dudley’s recent letter, his hurtful words. Their relationship was obviously complicated.
Draco exhaled slowly. His anger seeped away, his pulse quickened, and butterflies fluttered in his stomach, as though everything hinged on this interaction. “I meant all of it. Every word.”
Draco smirks and casts his Patronus. A silver dragon springs forth, looking every bit like a moving ice sculpture. It swoops down and pushes Teddy along, its wings beating with power and grace. “Weeeee!” Teddy calls out as his hair lengthens and turns platinum.
Draco shuffles into the adjoining bathroom and performs a Tooth Cleaning Charm. Upon exhaling, he sees his breath, which is unusual. He shrugs and casts a Warming Charm. While examining himself in the mirror, he runs his fingers through his hair but freezes with his hand mid-air. Slowly, he turns around and calls out, “Potter! Why is there snow in our bathtub?”
Harry straddles Draco, overwhelmed by the slide of well-worn leather against his skin, and the thrilling possessiveness of Draco’s kisses. Draco carefully inserts one, then two, lubed fingers inside Harry. He curls his fingers, brushes against
Draco sat on the floor, his eyes closed, taking deep breaths into his belly. He continued like this while he contemplated what Hermione had told him.
Draco holds the challenge of his gaze, and in the tipping up of his mouth, Harry knows he was right. “Books can wait,” he says.
Beneath the surface, he’s astonished at the speed with which Harry’s picked up on the skill. The fact that he’s describing anything this solidly at all is impressive. It’s likely down to that raw power he’d like to eschew, plus a cleverness he doesn’t get to employ often enough.
He’s turning towards the door leading to the cells when a firm hand grips his arm. Just like that, his temper flares and he snaps his head back at the larger man.
The poor bloke, hair tangled and parted out of place, lips pinked, looks mortified. “Harry, what—did I do something wrong?”
After the last curse, he was a bumbling mess. Tonight he makes up for it in spaids, moving with a determined, fearless urgency. He bursts through the door to the holding cells and past the Junior Auror sitting watch, who looks up with a surprised “Oi!” and begins to race after as he turns the corner to the cell Draco had occupied. It’s empty.
“How so?” Harry leaps to ask. “Tell me what you see. In the gardens.” Draco’s brows wrinkle in curiosity, his gaze trained on the fountain, and Harry sees it as a question. “I know you better when I look through your eyes.”
, and what if he’s feeling especially reckless? What if he doesn’t want to think about the consequences? What if he wants to give the go-ahead and live a little?
“It was Erickson. He must not have recognised me in his… upside-down distress. But that’s odd, isn’t it? The both of them?”
Usually, he’d try to steady a mood like this, but never here. The whole point at Jab is to get the anger out. So instead, he lets himself get angry about the banquet cut short, then angry about Malfoy leaving the Ministry without so much as a thank you, then angry about the war, angry about the way he’s been treated afterwards, like a machine that’s done its job.
“It’s good if, say, a Bludger is coming directly for you. You dodge quickly without losing your position.”
Potter looks uncomfortable. “Well, I guess, but you don’t have to—I don’t think talk like that’s necessary.”
He moves towards the edge of the bed, stands and stretches, making eye contact with a sour-looking Draco.
Harry watches him carefully, trying to piece out whether Malfoy will be open to questions. Then he chides himself for such caution—if he was any other consultant, Harry would have no hesitance. And so, he dives in.
“Enough,” she says, liltingly casual, "It's getting late,” and when her eyes bore into Harry’s with shocking darkness and she opens her mouth again, Draco shouts “NO!” at a volume that stalls them all. Even Lucrezia can’t help but turn to him, eyes wide at the disruption.
All that considered, Draco has not planned on enjoying his time at the Ministry. He wonders, not for the first time, if Flitwick had ulterior motives for forcing his attendance, considering his tendency to challenge Draco into taking the harder path.
She needs him. She needs him, and he’s forgotten her, acted cross, mentioned his father. He watches her sip her tea, remembering the governess he’d known better than her as a child. And the thin relationship they’d had in his teens. And the stronger one that had grown surprisingly well in the Manor for years after, drawing them closer than during his entire time at Hogwarts. Shared grief over Lucius, shared embarrassment over the war.
“I’m just kidding,” he adds, trying to keep a casual tone and failing miserably. “We’re friends. Obviously.”
by Barnaby Scrope. It’s on healing, particularly healing from the aftereffects of curses, mostly from the First Wizarding War. It won’t have the answers, but it has information you might apply in new ways. Original ways.”
Meanwhile, Draco is stuck in an overwhelming feeling that he can’t name besides thinking ‘I hope he keeps coming round’. His stomach flips again, imagining all the times he’s sarcastically called Harry ‘our Savior’ or something equally spiteful, and vows never to have a go with any
—his tone so complexly expressive that Draco couldn’t tell if he was happy or sad or embarrassed or found it corny until he pulled him into one of the best kisses of his life.
Dinner at Ron and Hermione’s was always chaotic at best, as life with a young child indisputably became. He’d never thought to tell them outright but seated at a table with his two best friends and the little being they’d created (who was becoming more like them both every day) could fill a million Patronuses.
Watching him interact with children fills Draco with a dangerous fluttering feeling, so he preoccupies himself with lightly kicking the rusticated stones of the apothecary’s façade. When he turns back, they’re running off towards their mother, who Harry waves at with a smile.
“Been called worse, you’ll have to try harder,” he’d mutter back in mock-irritation, not looking up from his calculations.
“I’m not cross, really, I’m just… tired. And you look like you need some rest. Here, my genealogy books.”
“That’s great news. This should all be over soon, but please communicate if it gets more painful. This curse intends to suspend the victim indefinitely, allowing for the natural reaction of blood rushing to the victim’s head to do all the lasting damage while responders attempt, usually at length, to research the counter curse. It’s a rare one, hard to find in books. Lucky for us, rare curses were one of my favourite studies. I’m telling you this so you’re aware that our only obstacle is time and we’re working fast as it is, which means everything will be fine. Alright, Leonard?”
Agnes Parker, who Harry recognises from MLE’s recidivism reduction unit, is frozen in fear, or pain, or both, as her skin seems to disintegrate in deep stretching tears up her arms. The woman to her right must have screamed in shock, and for a brief moment, everyone merely stares in shock as the blood dribbles down Agnes’ gown onto the white tablecloth and the floor.
When he pulls his head in, the page is sitting on top of his work, jutting out into space in the rectangular shapes it had been folded in. He flattens it, slides it back into the envelope, and tucks the envelope under a stack of finished pages.
He steps into Draco’s space, closer than he has in at least a week, and wraps his arms around him before he can react. Draco freezes, feeling too much all at once; Harry’s hair tickles his cheek, his chest rises and falls against his own, and the smell of his shampoo or soap or something woody and sharp fills the air. It’s quick. By the time Draco thinks to raise his arms from his sides, Harry’s let him go and retreated to the kitchen quickly with his face hidden, where he extricates a couple of plates from a cabinet.
Harry quirks an eyebrow, one corner of his mouth tipping up, as Draco sneaks his hands up along his ribs under the jumper. The look in his eyes is almost enough to make him throw away the day’s responsibilities. He winces regretfully.
“Careful, Harry,” Ron’s voice carries from the hallway. He’s returned and pulls his chair closer to her. “Famous last words.”
“The case has been reviewed, and it’s the department’s opinion that it be tabled unless another curse should occur.”
“Harry will thank him for you,” she says meaningfully, turning to him and pulling him into a hug as she does so. It’s warm and tight and filled with love as if he’d been the one cursed. “Take it easy today,” she whispers in his ear. “Don’t look at the case until tomorrow, when you’ve got your wits about you, alright? No impulsive heroism—Draco’s fine.”
“Can’t I just be cross? Just having a normal bad day? Ever had one? I have to see my mother tomorrow night, that’s… nerve-wracking.”
It’s past noon in India when they arrive, and so when Draco takes them to a major Muggle market, it’s already deliriously loud and busy with locals and tourists. There’s an almost endless drone of horns, from cars and tuk-tuks and motorbikes, and there’s the prattle of shoppers and sellers, and new smells of dishes stumbling into their path with every step. Only Draco’s hand still on Harry’s arm keeps him moving in any particular direction.
It’s a moment of quiet happiness, and there aren’t enough of those, so he turns to face the sleeping form with an arm tucked under his head, eyes tracing the long line of Draco’s body, marvelling as he’s keen to do on lazy mornings at the beauty of the man beside him. He’s splayed out under the sheets, still like a perfectly-etched marble statue, bare chest rising and falling slowly, one leg stretched towards Harry.
“I yelled at you. You glared at me for an unsettlingly long time, told me to stay or go, and disappeared.” Interesting, he thinks, that his life-ruining discovery of attraction looked like a measly glare. “
“He was upside down,” Draco offers again, as if he’s suggested something more considerable like ‘he was blind’. Maybe it’s as simple as the idea that he’s forgettable, or Leonard was a tad distracted.
He sends a narrow, side-eyed look at Malfoy, who has stood back politely. He gets the impression that the young Auror is still uncomfortable by the unannounced intrusion and doesn’t want to be the one left alone to decide what happens now. Harry can’t blame him—he isn’t too sure what to do next either.
“It was okay,” Draco lies, remembering the wonderful food, the beautiful autumn air, the old friends, and the orange lens that covered the entire countryside. Only Harry waking beside him each morning could have properly completed the escapism.
” she hisses, eyes narrowing. “That halfwit wouldn’t have been able to comprehend an ounce of the planning I’ve done. The
“You sound like Pansy’s advice program,” Harry says, mouth creeping up a little for the first time tonight.
“I’m sure you’re feeling the discomfort of that natural reaction right now, but you will be right-side-up long before we have serious problems. I’ll just need to mix the ingredients and have you ingest them. Won’t taste the best but it’ll get you down. It’ll feel—“
Draco’s emotionally and physically exhausted by the time he climbs the spiral stairs back to McGonagall’s office. The delightful effects of a Cruciatus. Or possibly tea with his mother. They present similar symptoms.
Professor Flitwick holds his gaze for a long moment, deciding how to proceed. He manages somehow to frown warmly at him.
The house is at the end of a long row of homes, all similarly sculpted with brick ground floors and timber-framed first storeys. From the lack of cars, he infers that it’s a wizarding neighbourhood and then, peering around the fence of the most overgrown building on the street, he spots a broom shed and knows it to be true.
That gets Harry’s head spinning again. He’d looked intriguingly confident compared to the Aurors surrounding him. If Hermione was right, which is usually a non-starter, then he couldn’t have been cursing Agnes moments ago. He would’ve had to curse the silverware before, stealthily, then be dense enough to stand up and point his wand at the victim. Even a git like Malfoy wasn’t that thick. But if they were carting him off—
He took his hands from his face, turning to examine Harry. Under those pale eyes he was suddenly a bit self-conscious, and sat patiently through whatever gears were turning behind them. Finally, he seemed to come to some internal conclusion.
“Home game this week,” she explains. “The timing couldn’t be more perfect, plus I’ll have a chance to stop by the castle and clean up the changing rooms and the broom storage before the new school year. Hopefully, I’ll be too busy worrying about the World Cup qualifiers later this month to do it then.”
“Oh. I got a bit preoccupied sixth year. I’m not sure if it was that serious anyway. Better as friends.”
“Can you charm this room bigger?” Harry asks. When he’d enlarged the punching bag from the transportable shrinking he’d done in the shop’s alley, it took up a quarter of the room. “And vanish the desk?”
In his periphery, he sees Harry procrastinate too, removing his glasses and wiping them clean on his shirt, replacing them and adjusting the frames around his ears.
The draft of Sirius Black’s necklace chapter was horrible. It had been written so quickly, in the brief space of a day where Harry’s absence had left him distraction-less, and first drafts aren’t masterpieces but this one made him look like he’d lost all his expertise overnight. He’d sent a mortified letter to Marta immediately, telling her not to bother reading the new chapter because he’s already rewriting it.
Her eyebrows are drawn together and his stomach twists in recognition that she’s asking more genuinely than she ever had. It fills him with a bone-crushing desire to be honest.
“Merlin…” he whispers from just above Harry’s head. It’s the first word he’s said since his arrival. Harry tilts his head back, but when he looks up he just gets an eyeful of
He warms up on the bag, punching firmly and powerfully, feeling in the snap of his wrist all the anger—Draco’s words, and his own even more, the way he lashed out, then Murray dismissing him from the case, and preemptive guilt for the raincloud that’ll surely hang over his head at Hermione’s unless a miracle occurs.
nothing like closure would come of this and something is welling up in him that feels like something Harry would handle by running but he’s
“There are names on the back,” Pratik adds quietly. “That’s Ashok there. His wife. Their children. Oldest daughter stayed—“
?” he demands, sweeping his hands in exasperation. His left stops firmly in midair, like hitting a wall, and when he tears his eyes from Draco’s to look down, the other man’s strong grip encloses his wrist. He wonders if he can feel his quickened pulse there.
Is it too soon? another part of him questions. Is this new? Or old but unnamed? No, he hated him. At Hogwarts, he hated him, unquestionably. What he can’t be certain of is whether something else had exacerbated that hatred. It’s too soon for this, he thinks again. It takes everything in him to nod along, to act normal, and he thinks maybe he should have begun the Blaise Method tomorrow.
It was easier to convince himself that Harry was nothing but a blip in his general constitution when he wasn’t around, just as it had been easy to convince himself that whatever lay electrified between them was imagined when Harry wasn’t looking at him like he is now.
“I guess I hit my stride. And Marta lit a fire under my arse. And it was more diagnostic than the cursed object chapters. No Arithmancy proofs.”
Draco doesn’t answer, but he steps aside for Harry to enter. He looks well-rested, though it may just be the brightness in his grey eyes or the clean cut of his clothes; slacks and a perfectly fit navy blue button-up. He looks effortless, and when Harry walks through he shuts the door and returns to the study without a word.
“What an ‘emergency’,” he mutters. “If I could just speak quickly about what Mr Malfoy has discovered from the latest evidence, I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Well, maybe you’d be imagining it if he hadn’t actually kissed you. But now I think you likely weren’t.”
Pansy reaches over and digs her hand into the chips Draco ordered for himself, pulling back before he can slap her hand away.
“You do now. And cumin, and coriander, and cinnamon…” He grants him a chiding look. “And salt and pepper.”
When the model arrives, wearing a red velvet Santa-inspired robe, everyone looks up. He’s pale, lithe, and utterly familiar. But it can’t be. Draco Malfoy is a Curse-Breaker, not a model for a Muggle art class. Harry glances to his right and Hermione looks far too pleased with herself for this to be a coincidence. Harry suspects this little ruse has less to do with Harry achieving balance in his life and more to do with his not-so-secret crush on a certain pointy, blond git.
set to end the spell after ten minutes—Slytherin to the core, he had a modicum of self-preservation.
Draco wouldn’t—he wanted to get this over with so he could leave. But Potter summoned a pot of tea from the house, and it settled down at the garden table before Draco could answer.
The goblins at Gringotts had been more than happy to sign a non-disclosure agreement; they would keep their mouths shut about Harry’s existence, so long as he did the same about his break-in and theft from their bank.
It doesn’t take Harry long to locate the box—ivory with brown stitching. He opens the lid, closes his eyes, and inhales deeply.
“She has? That’s wonderful,” Draco exclaimed. He knew she could do it. But then his eyes narrowed. “She left you alone?” He couldn’t help the intensity of his voice.
Draco continued to breathe and visualise: a magical container, created out of necessity, no longer needed but still there, sucking in magic and memories.
Draco purposely avoids the ballroom and takes Harry to the music room, which has a cosy feel and is less formal than the lounge. Draco informs him that the tree is classically themed with Rococo elements. All Harry can see are an excessive number of naked angels and harps.
Harry continues to sketch and shade Malfoy’s hipbones, wishing he could touch, dip his thumbs in and trace the indentation. He wants to suck on Malfoy’s fingers, one at a time, while he looks him in the eye. He wonders what it would feel like to run his hand over the red velvet, to trace the hard lines beneath. Surely Malfoy didn’t have a semi earlier? Harry would have noticed. He’s certain he would have done. Unless he’s been too distracted by his…everything else.
Harry was sleeping so peacefully, and it looked like he hadn’t slept properly in days. The night’s events found Draco exhausted as well. There were many things to worry about, riddles to solve, decisions to make, but it could all wait for the morning.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied. “I think I had too much to drink. I must have hit my head; things are a bit fuzzy right now.”
Two weeks after their initial confrontation, Petunia’s demeanour had completely shifted. She became warmer around Harry, caring for him, doting on him. It was a sharp contrast to the cold and dour woman he found in the living room that first morning. But grief affected everyone differently, and Petunia had been through so much. Harry couldn’t fault her for her lukewarm reception.
One word, but it expressed so much. They both knew what had happened. And yet here they were, making polite conversation over a cup of tea like strangers. Because that’s what it was: Harry Potter, with his memories intact, did not want Draco Malfoy. In fact, Potter was probably angry with him—and rightfully so.
The pebbles kept coming, one after another. Harry staggered to the window and couldn’t believe it—Draco was in the backyard. He stood in the bushes, with a pinched expression on his face, and Harry’s heart swelled. He wished he could touch him. But just to see his face, it was enough.
Harry’s skin feels all tingly, his stomach flutters, but he stands tall. “Hey, I stood up for you. I sent that Warming Charm your way too. That was good, wasn’t it?”
There was still the slight matter of not being able to reach Harry. He’d tried calling him—many times—but each time Petunia answered and firmly told him to stop calling.
They were kissing passionately, grinding their erections together, when Draco experienced the first wave.
He stared at them—they were written in his messy scrawl. They seemed strange and out of place, because something else should be written there instead. Shouldn’t it?
Much like the rest of his flat, Draco’s lunch was a simple affair. A plate with cheeses, crackers, and cured meat, far removed from the lavish meals of Malfoy Manor. Nowadays, Draco delighted in the freedom of simplicity. Liberated from the heavy burden of expectation, he could finally breathe.
Draco looked into her eyes, imploring her to trust him. She seemed apprehensive, but also burdened by the past. “It can help to talk about these things. I mean, let’s examine my role. I had this”—he rolled up his sleeve, and she winced. “It burned every time he’d call his followers, and sometimes, when he was angry, he’d press it for fun. A long-distance Cruciatus.
But what would he do now? He shook his head, folded the note back into a crane, and carefully placed it back inside the trunk. The answer didn’t matter.
of hooves sounding in the distance and spectral colours falling from the foliage above in a fine mist. Just like before, he could feel the emotions of his guardians—love, protection, and loyalty, beating from their hearts, rippling outwards and converging into his—but this time he could see their faces. One was an older version of himself, with glasses and hair poking out in all directions. The wolfman and dogman were there too, in their human form, with hands joined. The fourth figure was a woman—a striking beauty with long auburn hair plaited with lilies. But what entranced Harry the most was her eyes. She had his exact eyes—it was like looking through a window into his soul.
