“You’re all going to get to learn history this year in a way that no one else has learned it at Hogwarts since…before Professor Binns.” The class tittered at this. Bolstered, Harry continued on. “I need you all to work hard and do well, because if we all do well together that means other students will get to learn what you’re going to be learning this year. And I think it’s much more interesting than what Professor Binns is teaching,” he added with a wink. All the students laughed again.
“I’m getting my hair cut!” she plopped down on the grass in front of him.
It was late, definitely later than usual, when Harry was woken to Pansy’s voice, shrill with anxiety beside him.
“Right,” Harry said. “Are you sure that’ll work?”
They took up their usual spaces, Blaise and Pansy immediately curling up on his bed while Draco and Harry perched on Harry’s bed, before realizing there were two more to their number today. Granger and Weasley looked around the room looking distinctly awkward before Granger grabbed the chair from Zabini’s desk. Following suit, Weasley took the chair from Harry’s desk, turning it around and sitting down beside his girlfriend.
“Erm – hi,” Harry said. It was a strange moment, where he longed for the Days Before when he could talk to his friends without any awkwardness or shame. He was a product of the Days After now, hardly thought about the Days Before anymore.
Once they were in an empty hallway, Pansy removed the charm. It was just in time, too – as they started on again, a group of young looking Hufflepuffs came around the corner and nearly ran into them. Instead of shock or fear the group squealed.
“They made my life miserable,” she said. “Malfoy called me slurs, Pansy reminded me I was ugly every chance she got.” In a fluid motion, she pulled up her left sleeve, revealing the word that Bellatrix Lestrange had carved into her skin less than a year ago. Mudblood. “They hurt people. They killed innocent people. And then we come back from Australia and you’re friends with them? No warning? No hi, Hermione, how was your traumatic experience putting your parent’s memories back into their heads? Just ‘Hi, Hermione, come meet my new boyfriend, Draco bloody Malloy.’”
“You were having a nightmare,” she explained evenly, as though that explained everything. She stepped back to sit on Blaise’s bed – which, Harry noticed, was empty, and looked at him expectantly.
There aren’t any answers for this, either. Did you know that there are wizards in the Department of Mysteries studying genetics and magic? I would like to work there one day, I think. My point is – perhaps we will find out muggle blood does
going to remember that password,” he groaned. The Gryffindor boys at the front laughed, and then the tension was broken and they surged in.
“Not everyone can afford a tutor,” Pansy said, looking at him levelly. “And some parents don’t have the time to teach from home themselves.”
“Harry,” the familiar voice sounded behind him before he even had the chance to see if she had made her way down from the table. He turned in his seat, accidentally knocking Draco’s hand off his knee as he turned.
“Awesome,” Jason breathed. They took off towards the exit to the common room, only Jessamine remembering to go tap some of the second years on the shoulders. After the roar of noise as they exited, the common room became strangely quiet. Harry felt more tired than he had been before.
“I’ve already given them space,” Harry grumbled again, but nodded nonetheless.
“Should have chosen a different subject then, shouldn’t you have?” Blaise asked with a smirk, looking up from his position on the floor where he was playing a one-person chess game.
Madame Pomfrey nodded in agreement as McGonagall spoke. “That means there are some very important rules you’ll have to follow,” Pomfrey said. “No magic, in class or outside of it for the next two weeks. No extra activities that will put any strain on your body, like quidditch,” she said with a pointed look at him. “You’ll see me every day for the next week so I can monitor your magic levels, and then every other day the week after. Once we pass the two week mark we’ll devise a new plan based on the levels of your magical stores.”
When he entered the kitchen, he mostly expected it to be empty. But it wasn’t - he noticed the telltale sniffs of someone crying, first, before his eyes even registered who it was.
“I’ve been known to have them,” Draco drawled. If Harry’s eyes were open, he would have rolled them, but he was already drifting off into sleep.
“I don’t stick my nose in other people’s business,” Harry responded mulishly. Minerva just raised an eyebrow at him as if he were a misbehaving first year. It almost made him feel like a misbehaving first year. “What kind of person would I be,” he said after a moment, “if I didn’t speak up for the people who needed it? I have a voice, I have to use it somehow.”
“Tomorrow morning, under a few conditions,” Madame Pomfrey said, giving him a pointed look. “The Headmistress will be here in a moment to discuss.”
But Harry didn’t get to hear what it sounded like, because at that moment a knock on the door sounded, followed by hushed voices from the other side. Everyone looked at each other for a moment before three sets of eyes landed on Harry.
“Okay,” Harry responded. He felt like he was missing something – they were always up early to eat by themselves in the kitchens, but surely waking a little bit late wasn’t the end of the world. Especially now that the castle was full of students, not just eighth years.
“You could knock,” Draco groused. He turned his body back towards Harry, bent low and nuzzled his cheek once before rolling off him. Harry, in turn, sat up quickly in surprise.
“Please,” she said, leading them to the fireplace and adding a pinch of floo powder to the flames.
He stood close to Draco, their shoulders brushing, as their classmates stepped through the floo. Pansy Parkinson was on Draco’s other side, looking studiously grim and aggressively avoiding eye contact with Harry. Dean and Seamus and Neville had come through, had said their hellos to Harry, but were now standing on the opposite side of the room chatting with Ernie MacMillan and Justin Finch-Fletchy. According to Parkinson, Goyle had decided last minute to attend Durmstrang instead.
and the second was
“Library or common room?” Pansy asked. Harry hoped it wasn’t the library – if he had to spend any more time in there his brain would start leaking out his ears, he was sure.
So I simply said no, although of course I recognized Harry. I would recognize him anywhere, even then.
“I did,” Harry responded tiredly. “Boom.”
She regarded him for a moment, then shrugged. “I guess you’re right.”
Andromeda just smiled and squeezed his hand. “You can’t put a timeline on these things, Harry.”
And then, Hermione, you were being hurt by Bellatrix. And I wish I could say I would hear your screams for the rest of my life, but I won’t, because that was nothing compared to what I saw at the hands of the Carrows. You are branded, though – not like I, of course. I am branded by choice, poor though it may have been. You are branded because of your birth, due to something you can’t control.
Hermione said something, maybe, Harry wasn’t sure. He was dimly aware of them getting up and leaving – or were they backing away from him? He couldn’t see anymore, couldn’t feel. The world had gone from grey to white, he was angry like he had never been, not even in the Days Before, not when he had hated the world. The newspaper crunched in his hand and then felt hot, as if it had burst into flames.
It was a two part request, Harry knew. The first part was the offer, because of
He thought that McGonagall looked slightly abashed, but she didn’t say anything to address it.
I hope you understand me some more now, not that there is much to understand. Your ideas of me are quite likely accurate.
“Everything, really,” Harry said after a moment’s pause. “I’ve overseen two detentions so far. We’re updating curriculum-” he cut himself off. He wasn’t supposed to tell anyone this, really – except Draco, and by extension Pansy and Blaise. In fact, McGonagall had given him and Draco express permission to tell the other two, seeing as they were always together anyways.
“Oh, love,” Andromeda said with a sigh, breaking him out of his stupor. She reached out to take his hand. He clung back as if he were a child. “They will come around. I know it’s hard, but give them time. They’re grieving, too.”
“Granger,” she ground out. Harry snorted, surprsinging simultaneously himself and the three surrounding him.
“Why would she be mean?” Mar asked, looking confused. Harry did his best to keep his cool. He would tell Pansy about this as soon as he could. They would figure out what to do.
“Potter now, is it?” Harry retorted lazily.
He noticed the Slytherins had stayed uncharacteristically silent, too. Harry, Draco, and Pansy had taken up space at the back of the group almost immediately, and somehow Zabini had ended up on Harry’s other side. He tried not to look worried by this turn of events, where he was surrounded by the people the rest of the school hated most.
This, of course, only caused Harry to blush harder, while Pansy snickered downright evilly.
“Why do we have to read this? Shouldn’t we all know about them already?” she looked genuinely confused, and there were more than a couple students who looked like they agreed with her. He settled himself on top of his desk and regarded the class.
Blaise was right – it was a stipulation of the class. They weren’t graded, per se, but they needed at least a mark of Acceptable to pass the class and they needed to pass the class to graduate. It wasn’t designed to be particularly challenging, but it was designed to be thoughtful and require participation. Honestly, Harry sort of hated himself for creating it now that his work load was so great.
It said.
He was too shaken from existing, in the Days After, to handle a crowd of that size, if he were being honest. Instead, he left the castle, Invisibility Cloak tucked into his pocket. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had each other, the others were distracted in the Common Room; it finally felt relatively safe to go for a walk by himself.
He and Andromeda had spoken at length about it over the summer before he had sent an owl to McGonagall with his requests for classes. After deliberation and much conversation with Andromeda, McGonagall, Ron, and Hermione, he had decided to take Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, Potions, and work outside of class with some professors to take his OWLs in Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Muggle Studies, which had shocked Ron.
“Of course not,” she said, finally. “I saw it through the window. Also three lampreys, two trouts, and I think a Salmon, but that doesn’t really make sense because they’re supposed to live in rivers.” She was looking at him expectantly and didn’t seem to notice Blaise, who was trying to hide a laugh with a cough and Draco, smiling beside him. Harry elbowed Blaise in the ribs.
Well, that explained it. “Can I still teach?” Harry asked. He turned to look imploringly at McGonagall.
Blaise was right – it was a stipulation of the class. They weren’t graded, per se, but they needed at least a mark of Acceptable to pass the class and they needed to pass the class to graduate. It wasn’t designed to be particularly challenging, but it was designed to be thoughtful and require participation. Honestly, Harry sort of hated himself for creating it now that his work load was so great.
to keep it secret. After all, he trusted his three friends implicitly. It was more that it was one good reminder of the Days Before. A connection to his dad, but also a reminder of the fun he had had, Before. And was wasn’t quite ready to give that up, to share it around – not yet.
He felt Harry nudge him, and looked over to see him smiling slightly expectantly at Draco. “Oh yes,” Draco continued, drawling now. “And tea with Potter, how could I forget? Sometimes even tea with Potter
“You could say that,” Harry said, unable to help the way his voice came out breathy and soft, unable to keep Draco from affecting him so viscerally.
“When we talk about the most recent war, we’re not going to use titles like He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named or Lord Voldemort, either.” You could tell the muggleborns, he thought, because they were the ones that didn’t flinch when he said the name Voldemort. “His name was Tom Riddle, so we can either call him Tom Riddle or Riddle. None of this fancy name business.
Before Harry could say anything, he was engulfed in Andromeda’s arms. It felt like home, as it did every time, but the homesickness hit him this time like it hadn’t before – perhaps because of his nightmare the previous night, or because of how he had been feeling all day. He let himself cling on tightly for a moment before pulling away.
Maybe it wasn’t his death, really, that had changed his life so significantly. Maybe it was many tiny things. His death, sure. Andromeda, finding him tired and sobbing over Lupin’s body that same day. Charlie, taking him under his wing when his best friends had left.
“Okay,” he said, the glum feeling returning as he heard the dismissal for what it was.
“I heard it’s under the lake, and it’s always dark,” said another girl nearer to the front of the group.
“Are you all excited to finally be at Howgwarts?” he asked after a moments silence.
The students began to whisper as he approached them, with all the subtlety that eleven-year-olds possessed. He heard his name whispered and had to fight back a wince. They were children, he couldn’t blame them for the hero worship that he so desperately hated. Even if he
“I don’t disagree,” Minerva said. “And I admire your tenacity. But you cannot simply force your way through politics by trying to force people to agree with your opinion,
The class nodded in agreement. “We’re going to learn about some muggle history, too.” He anticipated whispers, and let them have a moment of surprise before hushing them. “We’re going to learn about World War One and World War Two, mostly, and what the role of wizards were during those wars. Now, can you all take out a quill and some parchment for me?”
Harry flinched every time the floo came to life and another one of his classmates stepped out. He couldn’t help it. In the Days Before, Harry had disliked travelling by floo, but hadn’t minded it either, not really. In the Days After, to put it simply, he was glad he and Draco had been the first to arrive, so no one but Professor McGonagall had to see him be sick in the potted plant in the corner of her office.
“When will they realize, though?” Harry asked. “Anyone dangerous is in Azkaban. The rest are serving house arrest sentences, like Draco and his mum. These laws won’t do anything but control family and friends of Death Eaters that had nothing to do with the war.”
“What happened, anyway?” he asked, turning back to Andromeda. “I remember fighting with Ron and Hermione…” he trailed off with a sigh.
“Thwarted?” Draco asked as he pulled himself to his feet. “Enjoying what you were seeing, then?”
“Alright,” Harry said, giving his friend a small smile. “Don’t see much of him, really. McGonagall is much more interesting.”
“I’ll only do it if he starts actually taking care of it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “Hair like Potter’s will ruin my reputation.”
He was sure he had wanted to say more, something about how Ron and Hermione were leaving, how Ginny would barely look at him, and how the quiet at Andromeda’s house was oppressive. About how every time he looked at Teddy he was filled with love greater than anything he could have ever imagined and grief stronger than a tidal wave. About how he dreamed of having the luxury to have stayed dead. About how different the Days After Harry was than the Days before Harry. About how beautiful Draco looked in the moonlight.
“Not completely,” she said. “But I will let Minerva know what we discussed and see if she has anything to say to it. Don’t try anything until she approves, alright?”
I’m sure you think of me as a monster. I think of myself as a monster, too, sometimes. I won’t be self-depreciating, but I will be honest. Perhaps by the end of the war I no longer wanted to be fighting. Not because I disagreed with all of their ideals, but because I wanted to
Harry nodded and turned to watch Teddy play with the bubbles floating around above his head. Every time he popped one with his chubby little fingers, another appeared.
“I hope it wasn’t in bed with you,” Harry responded jokingly. He felt more than a little forced, and it must have shown because Mar frowned at him in clear confusion.
She gave Harry a soft smile. “I don’t know what happened, really. You probably don’t remember him in third year, but he was tiny, like he was starved. He was angry, at first. People were picking on him, but he was picking fights with everyone he could. I guess he spent Christmas with his mum, because when he came back he wouldn’t even talk to any of us. Draco used to say he’d get to their dormitory after lights out every night, and leave before everyone woke. We think Snape let him do whatever he wanted, so long as he slept at some point. Spent a lot of time with Ravenclaws in the year above. We were all horrid to him about it, of course.
Draco was flushed bright red, and Harry guessed it was more from the question he had asked than their previous activities. Suddenly, something clicked and he couldn’t help but grin at Draco.
“I didn’t know what that spell did, you know,” he said quietly. Not quite an apology.
“I daresay that woman needs a break,” said Minerva. Harry nodded his agreement as he took a sip of tea. British habits may die hard, but sometimes he really, really wished Minerva was a coffee drinker.
“Andromeda did
“Harry,” she said warmly when he sat down.
“It’s not important,” she said. Harry was impressed – not even he was that flippant with McGonagall. She was still the Headmisstress, after all. “What’s important is you
“Every single person in this room lost someone – whether it was a parent, a sibling, or a friend. Every single student in this room lost part of their childhood to He Who Must Not be Named. Many of you,” she nodded towards the Slytherin table as she spoke, “lost your faith in Hogwarts, and the people here who should have protected you.”
“Then, last year, he didn’t come to school. Rumour was going around he was in hiding with his mum – she was never a Death Eater. Not many women were, though. And this year it seems he’s become pals with your lot. That’s all, really.”
“No,” Draco responded, sitting up slightly. “You would have been happy, I hope.” Draco moved off him, then, curling up against Harry’s side in the bed instead.
Harry felt his breath leave him in a short gasp as Draco’s mouth trailed down his jawline, found a sensitive spot on his neck. He ran his hands down Draco’s sides as Draco’s mouth found his, kissing him tantalizingly slowly. When Harry pressed forward into the kiss, Draco pulled back. When Harry arched his body, Draco lifted his own body away and -
“Professor Binns will be there too,” Harry responded, doing his best to dodge the question. The truth was, he
“I like your hair like this,” was all he could say. Draco just smirked.
Harry couldn’t actually tell what time it was, but they had found, once they had made it to their room the night before, that it had enchanted windows. They seemed to be similar to the ceiling of the Great Hall, showing with at least some accuracy the weather and time of day outside. Judging by the windows, the sun was just now peaking above the horizon.
. But why was he reacting like that?
Professor Stone waved them in. Harry could feel the concerned look she trained on him as he walked by, but he kept looking ahead. There were more pressing things on his mind than his breakdown – like why Ginny Weasley had shown up out of nowhere after months of anger to partner with him in potions.
this...probably could have been two chapters but oh well. enjoy a really freakin long chapter, haha. and please excuse me projecting onto mar... we stan her as much as we stan pansy now thanks :p
I LOVE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS ALSO, they give me life force i swear
. Just when Harry wanted to scream from the tension, Draco was gone, standing beside the bed, pulling his own jeans off.
It was two months to the date since the Battle of Hogwarts, marked in Harry’s mind as two months Since I Died. That was how life seemed to be these days, in the slowness of recovering and learning how to live in a world free of Voldemort. There were the Days Before – his whole childhood marked by danger lurking around the corner – and the Days After – marked by fear and flashbacks. Hermione had been reading, of course, her only coping mechanism, really. She threw around words like “post traumatic stgress” and “anxiety” as if she had been studying them her entire life. Harry preferred to call it “Maybe I Should Have Stayed Dead”.
He couldn’t help but think, though, that perhaps the prejudices that had fed the war, that had already been in place, were as much the fault of those in the Hogwarts houses that constantly demoized Slytherins. Perhaps people became what you made them.
“No,” Draco ground out. Even after all this time - although it hadn’t really been that long since the war, sometimes it felt like ages – the insinuation that he didn’t enjoy hurting people –
He half stood up to reach out to her, but she was already at the door. She gave one look back, not at him, but at Potter. “I can’t, I’m sorry.” And then she was gone.
Draco shuddered. “A little warning next time, Potter,” he grumbled.
“Give that to me,” Malfoy said suddenly. He took the lighter and cigarette from Harry’s hands, surprisingly gently. With one hand, he delicately placed the end in Harry’s mouth. With the other, he flicked the lighter to light it.
There was the combination of grumbles and explanations of glee around the table, which made Harry snort. Slytherins were a testy bunch, honestly.
“Set Teddy down, love, and go shower,” she said to him without looking up. Harry smiled to himself. Having someone to care for had kept Andy busy and seemed to keep her grief at bay. Being cared for did the same for Harry in the Days After.
“That still doesn’t explain…” Hermione began, but trailed off when Harry ran an exasperated hand through his hair.
“She’s married to Professor Stone,” he said, just as McGonagall cleared her throat over the din.
welcome to another episode of the Pansy Parkinson show...haha oops i mean my drarry fic obvs
“That’s the same thing,” she sniffed.
“Alright,” said Harry, relaxing slightly. Ron and Hermione were being…incredibly infuriating, of course, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them hurt – or to have hurt them. “So – what happens now?” he asked, before his thoughts could take him further than he needed to go. “Am I alright now?”
It was hard to ignore the stares, the whispers of
“I’m not,” he said. “I mean – I
He felt the ripple of the wards as he stepped outside of them, saw the world shimmer slightly and reform. Draco appeared with a pop almost at the same moment, holding the arm of an Auror, who must have side-along apparated him here. The Auror nodded once at Harry, then spun on his heel and vanished with another pop.
The other two laughed, and then the conversation continued in a similar fashion, with lighthearted joking at others expenses while they ate. Or rather, while they picked at their food. Some time later, when the kitchen began getting busier with bustling elves and the smells of food, they all pushed their chairs back. It would be breakfast time soon in the Great Hall and they had to make an appearance – to collect their offical professor assignments and meeting times, at any rate.
All in all, it looked as though there were around twenty five eighth years returning. Harry flinched again as the floo flared and Theodore Nott stepped through, felt Draco’s’ hand brush his wrist. He missed Ron and Hermione sorely in this moment, more than he had missed them yet. Something about being at Hogwarts made their absence feel profound.
“Isn’t Harry a Gryffindor idiot?” Michael asked.
Harry wasn’t really sure where to go from here. How did one start a possible insurrection in a week? There was only one good answer. Pansy Parkinson.
Lost in thought as he was, he hadn’t realized that Draco had stopped walking until he was a step ahead. Harry turned around to look back and Draco was kissing him. His lips were on Harry’s, hard and almost unyielding, teeth biting at his lips, hands slipped under his shirt.
They had taken a rare moment, just the two of them, in Draco’s room together. Pansy was meeting with the mysterious defence professor before dinner, and Blaise was waiting for her. Harry was currently sprawled out on the bed, staring at the ceiling, while Draco worked on an essay for Slughorn at his desk. His room was small, his desk close enough to the foot of his bed that Harry could reach out with a foot and touch him. The other side of his bed housed a wardrobe, and across from the bed was a door to the room – a painting of a dog on the other side that swung outwards when you pet its head in the correct pattern.
“Thwarted by a shadow,” Harry said quietly.
He glanced behind him quickly, tugging on his hair that was long enough now to graze his ears, although still wild as ever. He locked eyes with Draco, who gave him a nod and a small smile.
Draco couldn’t help it – he felt himself blush furiously. Normally, he didn’t mind Harry kissing him or taking his hand no matter who they were in front of. He welcomed the touch, especially in these days after the war – but also as he always had when Blaise put an arm around his shoulders or Pansy played with his hair. It was different, right now, though, with both Granger and Weasley now staring daggers through him.
They were all huddled in Blaise and Harry’s room, as usual. Harry was on his bed, lesson plans for his first years spread out around him along with their introductory essays. Pansy was at Blaise’s desk, the heavy tome open in front of her. She had some complex looking calculations on a parchment beside her that Harry didn’t have enough of an arithmancy grasp to even come close to understanding. Draco was at Harry’s desk, pretending he couldn’t hear them all in favour of his potions book. Blaise was, of course, on the floor between beds.
“Let me,” Draco whispered, before nipping his earlobe. He pressed their bodies together at the hips. Harry felt his knees go weak at the pressure. Then his tie was in Draco’s hands, but instead of undoing it Draco was pulling on it, forcing Harry to tilt his head to the side. He felt Draco’s exposed mouth on the skin of his neck, then, their bodies pressed together as Draco licked and sucked. He was sure that there would be a mark but didn’t care, not now.
The warm July air blew patterns across Harry’s skin, although he shivered in spite of it. The starry sky felt as though it was flooding his vision with light, and for a moment he considered going back inside but shook the idea off quickly.
That was how he ended up curled up in bed, half asleep, at a time that was horrendously early, with Draco complaining about how he needed to take better care of himself. Harry could only really grunt in response. He was more focused on the lesson plans for the next week that he still needed to complete.
By the time he came back out, Andromeda was in the sitting room with a tea for each of them. Harry set Teddy down on his mat on the floor and Andromeda charmed some bubbles to float above him and keep him occupied. Harry settled himself in the couch and accepted the tea that Andromeda sent floating over with another wave of her wand.
“Where are you?” Draco whispered finally, after silence that had stretched out endlessly. “You’re so far away today.”
In the Days Before, Harry would have been furious and probably argumentative. His identity had been Gryffindor through and through, moreso because he had
He glanced around furtively before reaching into his jeans pocket and pulling out a cigarette and a lighter. There were charms for this, of course, but his magic had been unstable to say the least in the Days After; once he had set fire to Andromeda’s back garden, so for now he stuck to lighters.
He checked Draco’s room first, but none of his friends were there. They were unlikely anywhere in the eighth year dorms, but perhaps the Slytherin common room. Or…he checked his watch. The kitchens for a late lunch.
Pansy’s eyes lit up and she leaned forward towards them. “Apparently, McGonagall is making an announcement tonight, and he may or may not have let slip what that exact announcement will be.”
I am not writing this to make excuses to explain away my past. I was a stupid boy who made others feel small to make myself feel better. I was a horrible teenager who hurt and tortured people, who kept prisoners in my basement and played house with a madman.
Madame Pomfrey ushered him out almost before the Healer had finished speaking, muttering all the way about incompetent healers being the reason she was no longer in the businesss outside of Hogwarts. Harry barely listened, even to her reassurances.
“You sound like Pansy.” His observation earned him a very real glare from Hermione. “Honest!” He added. “She’s about as scary as you, too!”
with them. Parkinson tried to hand you over to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
“You’re jealous of Ginny,” he said.
“Welcome to History of Magic,” he began, looking out at the classroom. It wasn’t quite as full as a usual class would be – as classes were when it wasn’t the year after the war, anyways. There were officially twelve Slytherins – five boys and seven girls - seven Hufflepuffs, and nine Ravenclaws.
“I think there are more than just us two who feel like this,” Harry said carefully. “We just have to find the rest.”
“You will have to be careful,” McGonagall said. “Exceptionally careful with the amount of energy you are expending over the next couple weeks.”
He dropped into his bed in the eighth year dorms after his last class of the day, Arithmancy, and groaned. It wasn’t long before Draco, Pansy, and Blaise trooped in from Ancient Runes. Draco dropped onto the bed beside him.
“Pansy,” gasped one of the girls. She rushed forward again to hug Pansy around the middle, the rest of the group following until Pansy was nearly buried under Hufflepuffs. A couple made their way to Blaise, too.
No, the moment the cognitive dissonance stopped for me, the moment when I realized that I no longer truly believed what I had been raised to believe, was that moment when I watched Bellatrix carve the word
“What do I do, then?” He asked. He was aware he sounded like a petulant child. He also didn’t care.
“It’s always alright,” she said warmly. A warm Minerva was something Harry was still getting used to. Not that she had ever been cold, per se – just removed, as teachers often were.
“Stop working, then,” Harry responded, throwing a pillow at him. He was being a little bit obstinate. He had work to get done, too, but he was too nervous about the next day, Ron and Hermione arriving to do anything about it.
“Pomfrey does, I think,” he said instead of answering her other question. At a raised eyebrow from her, though, he continued on. “I just…needed a break. For a minute.” He took a sip of his tea.
“You’ve changed,” she said, finally. He hummed, not sure what to say to that. “You’re so much calmer. And thoughtful.”
“You were having a nightmare,” she explained evenly, as though that explained everything. She stepped back to sit on Blaise’s bed – which, Harry noticed, was empty, and looked at him expectantly.
Draco hummed in understanding against him. Then his weight shifted off of Harry, who was left gasping, aching at the loss for a moment. Until, that is, he felt Draco’s fingers at his belt buckle, making quick work of his fly, pulling his jeans and pants off of him in one movement.
“-can’t just walk him out with other people around,” she said as he came to. He felt around for his glasses, accidentally smacking Draco on the nose as he did so. The other boy, who was already awake, huffed out an exasperated “Potter!” before handing Harry his glasses.
“Andromeda did
“You sound much too cheerful about that,” Harry responded. A strange warmth was pooling in his stomach, though. Sure, Hogwarts was undeniably different. But perhaps it was still home.
“Very well,” she sighed. “Come along, then.”
“Ron misses you,” she said angrily, as if it were somehow his fault. “And he thinks we should make up with you but you don’t - neither of you-” she let out another great gasping sob. A pit of guilt sunk in Harry’s stomach.
“What reputation?” Blaise asked with a grin, while Harry glared at Pansy with mock offence.
Harry almost smirked. Draco looked significantly uncomfortable, and also startled to be addressed so directly even though they’d been talking all evening already.
“I need to…” he said, and paused. What he needed, in all honesty, was to talk to Andromeda and hold Teddy. Neither of those were options.
“Don’t act like you don’t have blood on your hands because you wouldn’t use some unforgivables, you bastard. You have the blood on your hands of every person who was hurt after you left and didn’t take anyone with you, of every Slytherin child who was hurt from the first
That made him smile at her, only slightly. “I think I’m done with any favours of the death sort, honestly,” he said.
“You’re awake?” came Andromeda’s voice again. She was beside him, then, glasses in hand. “How are you feeling?” she asked as he put his glasses on.
“Alright?” Harry asked Draco as they started walking. Draco was flushed and looked as though he’d be sick at any minute.
“Kind of, yeah,” Harry agreed. He wanted to touch her hand, hold it still, but was fairly certain that was the wrong thing to do. “Mary was being sarcastic. She was trying to be mean to you.”
Harry was back on him, then, Draco pliant underneath his hands. He pushed Draco down, straddling him as he lay down on his cloak, kissing anger and longing and apology across the pale scars on Draco’s chest and abdomen.
Predictably, Gryffindor cheered. The man who stood up and waved also seemed quite young, although older than the two other professors that had been introduced. He was rather handsome, too, Harry thought – quite tall, with sandy blonde hair and broad shoulders. He certainly
“The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin when I was sorted,” he continued. Pansy looked up, shocked. “Everyone says it was because I had part of Voldemort’s soul in me, or something. I talked to Andromeda about it, too. She was Slytherin, you probably know that. She was horrid when she was younger, too. But Slytherin – ambition, cunning, valuing friendships, even – I don’t think any of those are bad traits, not any longer. And I think they all represent me, too. Maybe the House system has just been taken too far.
“Come on, you idiot,” came a girls’ voice from his side. He couldn’t focus, couldn’t see, even; couldn’t think, but he allowed whoever it was to lead him toward the door to the classroom. He came back to the world once they were face-to-face with Professor Stone, jarred out of his panic by Draco, who had hastily dropped his hand.
Your wish is my command, this will be a full length fic! I don't have a plot fleshed out really, but I'm hoping it'll develop as I go along...
smug,” Harry said with a sigh.
“What reputation?” Blaise asked with a grin, while Harry glared at Pansy with mock offence.
The fist in his chest, the spinning, the crushing, was receding, now. He felt as though he could breathe, but
you'll notice this has been turned into a series and a second work has been added. all it is is this story without the smut, since i had some friends who wanted to read it but don't want to read the sex bits. so if you enjoy this, ignore that! if you'd prefer that, hit next work! i've also been thinking about starting a collection of one-shots from other characters points of view (pansy, blaise, mar, ron, hermione, etc). if that's something ya'll would be interested in, please let me know in the comments!
The images in the dream came back to him, unbidden. As if they would want him there, it was
“And you died,” she said for him, finally. “In the Final Battle.”
It was Pansy, though, that answered. “There are,” she said. “And I think the library has a great big book about them with pictures and everything.”
Harry groaned. “Don’t remind me, please. I’m trying not to think about it.”
“You wait,” said Andromeda, prompting another sigh from Harry. “You let them know you’re there from them, then you give them space and you wait.”
Harry snorted at that mental image. “Thanks,” he said after a moment of silence. Zabini took his cue, standing up and making his way over to his own bed.
“We’re late for breakfast,” he said, by way of greeting. Harry sat up quickly at that, shock coursing through his system.
He emerged not long after, wet hair dripping into his eyes. Andy shooed him off to meet Draco at the apparation point, just past the wards of the cottage.
“Oi!” he called as he approached the first years. Mar stopped short when he called out, prompting another first year, Jason, to bump into her. “Don’t you have work to be doing?” he asked, in his best stern professor voice.
“Ms Parkinson,” McGonagall said with a sigh, “I promise you, this has been taken into account by all the professors and we have come to what we believe is a suitable arrangement.”
your brain working.”
“That’s not true!” Hermione began, fiercely.
“We slept in,” Pansy said, turning her dark look on Harry.
It wasn’t so surprising, not really. They had been children, raised for different purposes, on opposite sides of a war.
“Nev,” he began, tryign to come up with the words to say – trying to come up with a way to fix it, a way to apologize for not being the saviouir they had needed. But he was interrupted.
Draco smirked lazily up at him. “What’s wrong with the astronomy tower?”
“We need to go,” Pansy said suddenly, giving Draco’s legs a hard shove. “We’re going to be late!”
Harry nodded, the cobwebs clearing completely from his mind for the first time all day. He kissed Draco quickly before dragging himself out of bed. He felt himself flush, even though they hadn’t done anything, really, except talk. But after disappearing for so long, Harry was sure everyone else’s minds would jump to
Harry let out a laugh that sounded more like a choke. “Like that,” he said. “Draco is always mean before he has his coffee.”
“Common Room,” Blaise said with finality. “We can hunt for some sixth or seventh years to help us with muggle studies.”
Harry nodded, thoughtfully. “Were your parents Death Eaters?”
Harry ran his hand through his hair. A couple times. These were the kinds of things he needed Pansy for. Mar had started tapping her collarbone, though, like she often did. And the more he let the silence go on, the faster she tapped. He gathered himself together in a deep breath.
Harry rubbed his face in frustration. “Why don’t they go to muggle schools, then?”
His chest felt tight, and he almost wanted to cry, but couldn’t place the exact reason. Because Pansy was upset with him? That wasn’t it, not exactly. It was as though the sounds of the dining hall had amplified around him, too – and they were different, this year. The chatter was subdued, voices tinged with worry and fear. Harry felt it in the core of himself.
“You’re all making it awfully hard to focus,” Draco said, finally looking over from Harry’s desk.
“I just needed…space.”
Harry found it within him to give the other boy an amused smile. “I feel like I have to disagree with that on principle,” he said, “but you probably aren’t incorrect.”
Draco’s hand came up to cup Harry’s cheek and he turned into it, kissing the other boy’s palm. Draco withdrew his hand, leaning down instead to press a slow kiss to Harry’s lips. “You don’t owe the world anything,” Draco said against his mouth. “You didn’t need to stay, you never had to. No one would have been angry if you had…gone on.”
“I know we have a class that’s probably quite mixed in terms of skill,” said Professor Stone. “So we’ll start off with a practical review. Please turn to page 17 in your books. You’ll have this class to brew Dreamless Sleep potion as a review. It won’t be for an official mark, but your grade will allow you and I to see where your skill level is at.”
“I wasn’t always the Dark Lord’s favourite,” Draco gasped out. “I was particularly useless, most of the time.”
He looked up to find Draco and Blaise sitting at a small table, looking at him in astonishment. A house elf appeared beside the table, snapping into existence two more chairs and place settings, before buslting away as quickly as it had appeared.
Blaise Zabini, on his other side, was smirking at him. “Not the time, Potter,” was all he said when Harry made eye contact. Harry mumbled a quick thanks back, working to calm his racing heart.
“Just sad,” she said, giving him the kind of look out of the corner of her eye that made him feel as though she could see right through him.
He dropped into his bed in the eighth year dorms after his last class of the day, Arithmancy, and groaned. It wasn’t long before Draco, Pansy, and Blaise trooped in from Ancient Runes. Draco dropped onto the bed beside him.
“Harry, I saw an
things they could have been doing. Draco gave Harry a look that told him he was thinking the same thing exactly.
“People who are being right pricks?” She asked.
“Harry James Potter? Think before he acts? That’s preposterous,” she said. Hermione didn’t laugh, but he could hear the lightness in her tone.
“You’re expected in the Great Hall for lunch in an hour where I will provide you more instructions for your first week here and what to expect upon the arrival of the rest of the Hogwarts students. Until then, you’ll find your room assignments posted on the far wall. I will not hear any arguments or requests to switch rooms, these are final.” With a final look at all of them, she spun with a swish of her robes and departed down the corridor.
“Don’t make me regret this,” she mumbled to him as they sat down at a table directly beside Draco and Luna. Draco shot him a concerned look as well, which he ignored, choosing instead to raise his eyebrows in Luna’s direction. Draco merely shrugged in response, but Harry could see him fiddling with his shirt on his left forearm again.
Pansy scoffed at him. “The Parkinson’s aren’t even Sacred Twenty-Eight anymore, though my parents and grandparents tried to pretend like we were. But no, and it wasn’t a noble decision, either. ‘Neutrality never loses’ is practically the Parkinson motto. Neither was Blaise’s mum, though she was a pureblood. Too busy marrying rich men and then killing them; doesn’t care whether they’re wizarding or muggle or anything so long as they’re rich. Actually,” she leaned in conspiratorially towards him, “I’m fairly sure Blaise’s dad, whoever he was, was muggle, from the way he talks about him. I’ve never asked, though. Blaise was a right ass when we were younger, anyways.”
“No,” he said, with a rueful shake of his head. “I need help with Arithmancy, though. Maybe we could all study together after classes tomorrow?”
Pansy looked shocked. Harry couldn’t tell if it was because McGonagall had just confirmed that there was indeed a Defence professor hired for the fall term, or because she had just been offered a method of avoiding the rest of those in their year by the Headmisstress herself. To her credit, though, Pansy merely nodded in acknowledgement.
Pansy had been expressly forbidden from telling anyone about who the new Defence professor was, but she absolutely gushed about her at every possible opportunity. Blaise was not enjoying Arithmancy with Professor Vector, and he made sure everyone knew it. Mostly, he had been stuck tutoring Harry, so Harry, at least, didn’t really blame him.
“Sometimes I am,” she said finally. “But no, not right now. Sometimes I think I never will be, you know?”
“Something like that,” he said.
“What do you need?” he felt Draco ask against his ear.
girl in the corridors to attack her for revenge? What’s the curse going to be? I heard you have a pretty mean cruciatus. I know your stupid
Draco gave Blaise a small smile. “Yeah,” he said. “She seems alright, too.”
“Better,” Harry said honestly. “I feel better.”
Harry gave him a hard look, not entirely convinced but unsure how to argue – unsure if Draco would be upset if he pushed more.
“The look that tells me I should start insulting you before you get a big head,” Draco said. Harry could hear his grin through his words.
He still hadn’t told the three Slytherins about it. He was beginning to feel that they might be angry with him for hiding it from them. He wasn’t exactly sure why he hadn’t told them, either. There was no
“It’s alright,” she said, standing from her place on the chair. “Give him here, I’ll let you two catch up.” She took Teddy from Harry, giving him a long hug when she bent down. She gave Draco a quick kiss on the forehead, to which he blushed. “I’ll see you boys in the morning.”
“We heard that you were planning on assigning two eighth years per house this year,” Pansy began after a pregnant pause. The Headmistress looked shocked – whatever she had been expecting from the two of them, it was not this.
He drew four columns on the board and turned back to the class. “I think we all know at least one evil wizard that we’ll be talking about today,” he said. There were some whispers, but no one said anything out loud, so he continued on. Turning back to the chalkboard he wrote
His flashbacks were less, now that he had been here for a week. He less often walked through the corridors shaking and gasping for breath, less often had memories rise to the surface. When they did, he could push them down. He wondered if it would have been the same if he had been back in Gryffindor, with Neville and Dean and Seamus.
“Sorry?” Harry responded. “Why is Blaise in the kitchens now?”
“Ms Parkinson,” McGonagall said with a sigh, “I promise you, this has been taken into account by all the professors and we have come to what we believe is a suitable arrangement.”
His breathing was coming faster, now. He hadn’t stared down the other end of a wand since Voldemort; he hadn’t thought his first day back at Hogwarts would find him doing the same thing. He couldn’t think of any spells to cast, couldn’t move all of a sudden. It was like everything in him was frozen and screaming, like the night Dumbledore had petrified him on the Astronomy Tower. Bile rose in his throat and he swallowed it down.
He stood close to Draco, their shoulders brushing, as their classmates stepped through the floo. Pansy Parkinson was on Draco’s other side, looking studiosly grim and aggressively avoiding eye contact with Hary. Dean and Seamus and Neville had come through, had said their hellos to Harry, but were now standing on the opposite side of the room chatting with Ernie MacMillan and Justing Finch-Fletchy.
. It took him a moment of haziness to realize that it
Uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him, Harry slid out of his chair. Perhaps in the Days Before, Harry would have shouted or thrown a tantrum to avoid the emotions he was feeling now. But in the Days After, he just didn’t have the energy.
“McGonagall wouldn’t-”
“Of course not,” she said, finally. “I saw it through the window. Also three lampreys, two trouts, and I think a Salmon, but that doesn’t really make sense because they’re supposed to live in rivers.” She was looking at him expectantly and didn’t seem to notice Blaise, who was trying to hide a laugh with a cough and Draco, smiling beside him. Harry elbowed Blaise in the ribs.
“You mean he’s not, now?” Harry snorted. Pansy smirked back at him, but her expression was slightly vacant.
Pansy scoffed loudly. “Forgive me if I don’t believe in your definition of suitable.” Harry stepped slightly closer to Pansy, a quiet show of support. He didn’t want to speak, didn’t entirely fell it was his place and was sure that Pansy would not appreciate it if he did. But he did want Professor McGonagall to know that he agreed with Pansy implicitly.
“But Dumbledore what? Dumbledore, who grew up standing for the exact same ideals as Voldemort? Dumbledore, who probably would have kept siding with Grindlewald if he hadn’t killed his sister?”
Ravenclaw,” Mar said, as if it were the coolest thing in the world. “I told her she was pretty, and she said she’d cut my hair for me, and I really want it shorter.”
He couldn’t have, not really. Not when the world needed him to defeat Voldemort, and especially not now that Teddy needed him. But it was his one selfish wish.
He checked Draco’s room first, but none of his friends were there. They were unlikely anywhere in the eighth year dorms, but perhaps the Slytherin common room. Or…he checked his watch. The kitchens for a late lunch.
He waited until they were outside in the grounds to speak again. “It’s not – it won’t be taught the way Muggle Studies was before. It’s not just about things like electricity, not a way to make muggles look eccentric. It will have a large focus on muggle and magical history, taught in a way that emphasizes reading comprehension and writing skills, especially in first and second year. Then it will focus more on wizard-muggle relations and how to navigate the muggle world. Spending money, technology, using the post, the library, applying to muggle unis – the lot of it. There will be mandatory field trips and everything.”
He didn’t know, though, if he would be coping so well if he were rooming with them as normal. Blaise woke him up during nightmares; Harry did the same for Blaise. They had cleaned up after each other when they’d been sick, spent late nights talking about the past and the future. On one memorable occasion already, they had snuck Pansy and Draco in and sat up all night with hot cocoa delivered by the house elves when it was all too much.
I am sure degradation was the point, with Bellatrix. That and the pain she must have caused you – the lasting scar. Have you ever thought about covering it up with a tattoo? I have, but I won’t. My mark is part of me, part of my past. I cannot erase it and I would not want to. Rather, I can only hope it will remind me to be better.
“He changed,” Hermione said, weakly.
and be
He looked as he always did these days, slight and tired. His eyes had their now characterstic bags, his hair was long – nearing his shoulders, and mussed. He was wearing muggle clothes, jeans and a sweater. Harry thought it was frightfully attractive, though he’d never say it.
Saint Mungos was much the same as it had been the last time Harry visited it - after Mr Weasley had been attacked by Nagini. It was less frightening now, however, walking through the halls with Madame Pomfrey at his side into the outpatient area of the Spell Damage ward. At least, there was no one with teapots on their noses or legs cursed to dance forever.
“You’re all going to get to learn history this year in a way that no one else has learned it at Hogwarts since…before Professor Binns.” The class tittered at this. Bolstered, Harry continued on. “I need you all to work hard and do well, because if we all do well together that means other students will get to learn what you’re going to be learning this year. And I think it’s much more interesting than what Professor Binns is teaching,” he added with a wink. All the students laughed again.
In the end, I was a pawn for a madman. Forgive me for saying this, but perhaps you both will be able to relate, given how you spent every waking moment with Dumbledore’s biggest weapon (yes, I mean Harry).
She regarded him for a moment, then shrugged. “I guess you’re right.”
Just because it’s happening in your head doesn’t mean it isn’t real.
Harry didn’t respond, couldn’t, around the emotion in his chest. Was it fair that he, himself, was sometimes grateful he stayed? When he was laughing with Pansy, in quiet moments with Blaise; whenever Draco was near him and the sadness was at bay. Was it fair that he didn’t hurt, in those moments? Was he allowed – could he allow himself to live in this world, fully and properly, ever again?
You know the rest, anyhow. I hadn’t expected to be spoken for at my trial. I had expected Azkaban. I cannot say with any certainty that at the point of my trial I believed that muggles weren’t inferior. I do not know when I stopped thinking that, but I am fairly certain that I was still set in my ways.
“Um,” she said, nervously glancing at Ron and Hermione as if only just noticing their presence. Harry gave her an encouraging smile. “Well, I told her she was pretty and then she said if I was acting like a dyke she could make me look like one,” Harry did his best to stifle a gasp. Or groan. He wasn’t sure. “But I didn’t know what that word meant, so I asked and she said I needed shorter hair, and I told her I always wanted short hair but mum never let me, and she said that if I met her in the charms room after curfew she’d cut it for me.”
“Drink this,” said another voice somewhere past the foot of his bed. Madame Pomfrey bustled into view, potion vial in hand.
“One could argue that you would have a quiet life if you stopped sticking your nose into everyone’s business,” she responded.
“What are you doing in here?” was the first thing that came out of his mouth. It was slightly more aggressive than he intended but, well – the sun wasn’t even up.
The conditions of my parole are to stay within the grounds of Hogwarts and refrain from use of magic outside of class, other than small wandless spells. And to help rebuild, of course. As it turns out, I did not do much of the rebuilding part.
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Blaise responded theatrically. “Don’t worry, Weasley was shafted with Smith. I’m sure you’ll hear so many stories it’ll be like you lived with him anyway.”
“How was your meeting with Professor Mysterious?” he settled for asking.
“How was your meeting with Professor Mysterious?” he settled for asking.
“You can’t expect us to believe,” Granger said, lifting her head, “That you have anything to
Harry woke slowly, dimly aware of hushed voices speaking somewhere in his periphery. There was something soft underneath him – a bed? He winced as his eyes opened, becoming aware of a pounding headache and his sore body. Slowly, his argument with Ron and Hermione, his conversations with Mar, came back to him. He let out a frustrated huff of breath. Whoever was nearby must have heard him because the hushed voices stopped.
This was the aftermath, he realized, of a group of children left to fend for themselves. This was the aftermath of having only the older Slytherins left to protect them. The aftermath of the people who were supposed to protect them leaving them to fend for themselves. Harry was sure there was more than just this, too – more than the visible results of experiencing a war in their own school. There would be nightmares and panic, walking through the halls and seeing the ghosts of their friends – the Slytherin students would experience it just as severely as any other students.
“Honestly, Potter, it’s like you end up in a different world,” she said. He shrugged, but could feel Draco snickering against his back. Perhaps in the Days After he was a little bit…fuzzy – but it wasn’t him, really, it was the world. The world was fuzzy; too fast and too slow and too hard and too soft and hurt too much and didn’t feel like anything at all and Harry didn’t know what to do with it. He had the strong urge to look up, towards Ron and Hermione, but forced it down. Now was not the time.
“Welcome, and welcome back to Hogwarts,” she began. “I have a few brief announcements before I can let you go for the evening.” She smiled down at the eighth year table for a moment. “You’ll notice a new set up in the Dining Hall, the table at the front is here to house the school’s eighth year students, who have come back to complete their schooling. You will see many of them in your classes, working to assist your teachers and provide extra help.
“I’ll go, I know where she went,” Harry said with a sigh. Before anyone could protest, he had kissed Draco on the temple and disappeared through the door.
They had stopped walking. Draco’s eyes were on him, serious and bright. He didn’t know, really, who Draco was trying to convince – Harry, or himself.
“Is it just you and Professor McGonagall working on this?” she asked.
They turned to their work, then, and Harry put his head back down on the table with a thump. He felt Draco’s hand on his knee, and leaned into the touch before forcing his head back up and taking out a piece of parchment.
Well, I couldn't leave everyone hanging for too long...
“Oh, it’s you,” Pansy sighed when he stepped in.
“When will Ron and Hermione be at Hogwarts?” Andromeda directed the question at both of them, although of course Draco would have no way of knowing the answer.
He took another drag – too deep – and coughed.
more than what has been handed to me.
She took a deep breath, leaned against him carefully. He put an arm around her, equally as carefully. It wasn’t that he was touch-averse, necessarily, but Ron and Hermione had never needed so much affection from him. He found it strange.
McGonagall paused for a moment, and Harry felt the weight of it – it was a pause that held the weight of a war; perhaps the weight of two wars, the weight of the pain endured by everyone who was present here, and everyone who wasn’t present in the world any longer.
The warm July air blew patterns across Harry’s skin, although he shivered in spite of it. The starry sky felt as though it was flooding his vision with light, and for a moment he considered going back inside but shook the idea off quickly.
Draco kissed him gently; the side of his mouth, under his jaw, then sat back, running his fingers through Harry’s wayward hair. “Don’t be sorry,” Draco said. “It’s not your fault.”
Instead they were kissing. Harry wasn’t sure who started it or even how it had happened, but he was keenly aware of Draco’s lips on his; hands under his sweater and roaming. Harry instinctively curled his hands in the ends of Draco’s hair, pulling his head back. Draco let Harry maneuver him, and then his lips were on Draco’s neck and he was tasting the sweet of his skin mixed with the salt of his sweat.
She took a deep breath, leaned against him carefully. He put an arm around her, equally as carefully. It wasn’t that he was touch-averse, necessarily, but Ron and Hermione had never needed so much affection from him. He found it strange.
He waited a moment as the class reached into their bags to pull out the requested materials, and stayed quiet until they were all settled and focused again on  him. “For the second half of the class today,” he continued, “I think we can play some games that will help us all get to know each other. But for the first half of the class I have a writing exercise for you all.” There was a collective groan from the class that he couldn’t help but laugh at.
But then Draco was kissing him, gently, tenderly on the steps, and maybe, Harry thought, maybe it didn’t matter what they were Before. Maybe it only mattered that they were better now.
“You never told me that,” Draco said finally, breaking the silence.
“Harry!” It was Mar, of course, entirely unable to understand the tension of the situation she was approaching, as usual. “Guess what?”
What Harry wouldn’t have given, in that moment, for someone he loved to be here to make sense of this for him. Sirius, Lupin, even Andromeda.
“You and I have to plan for welcoming the Slytherins this evening,” Pansy said, then. “I was thinking we could after lunch. Draco and Blaise can help us.”
“You could say that,” Harry said, unable to help the way his voice came out breathy and soft, unable to keep Draco from affecting him so viscerally.
his career.
She gave him a levelled look. “That would be a highly unpopular stance, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes it’s best to let these things run their course. The public will realize it’s a bad idea, over time.”
but before he could say anything Draco was tugging on his arm. Taking the hint, Harry turned to face Draco, legs still crossed. Draco closed space between them to plant a kiss on Harry’s lips. When he tried to pull back, Harry held him fast. They ended up falling backwards on the bed, laughing.
“It is,” she said instead.
“Don’t act like you don’t have blood on your hands because you wouldn’t use some unforgivables, you bastard. You have the blood on your hands of every person who was hurt after you left and didn’t take anyone with you, of everyone who was hurt from the first
“I- he- you-” Weasley blustered. Granger had her head in her hands. Draco strongly suspected she was crying, but couldn’t bring himself to care.
She looked at him through swollen eyes. “You really are thick, you know that?”
hurting people?”
Harry swung Teddy up and into his arms. “Let’s go, Teds. If we spend much more time out here Andy will throw a fit.”
“It’s quite interesting, really,” she said to Madame Pomfrey, ignoring Harry almost entirely. “I will have to have the Healer come in and look for himself. I’ve never seen anything quite like this.”
The brutality at Hogwarts opened up my eyes to something that has been essential to me, recently. The Carrows did not care about who they hurt. The Slytherins were the most accessible to them; there was no one to stand up for us – and that’s alright, I understand, really, why everyone believed we got preferential treatment. Why everyone believed we were evil. Some of us were – some of us are. I had to watch my best friend hurt children – and enjoy it. That is neither here nor there, nor is it an excuse. I will stop dithering again.
In the Days Before, Harry would have been furious and probably argumentative. His identity had been Gryffindor through and through, moreso because he had
She lunged forward and flung her arms around him. “Thank you,” she said into his shoulder. Then she jumped back almost as abruptly as she had leapt forward. With one last, wary look at Ron and Hermione, she ran off. Hopefully, Harry thought, to do homework and not stir up anymore trouble.
who to save, and I couldn’t, and…I went through the veil instead.”
“Just this,” he whispered back, before letting his emotions overcome him and fading into sleep.
“That’ll be Teddy,” she said, releasing him with a look of fond exasperation. “Why don’t you go get him and I’ll make us some tea?”
“I’ll meet you at the Slytherin table,” Harry said quietly, shrugging with the baby in his hands. Pansy just nodded curtly and walked away, leaving Draco standing helplessly between them. Harry rolled his eyes. “C’mon,” he said to Draco.
“You are a bit of a prat,” Hermione said, looking at him from the side of her eye. With that, Harry knew he was forgiven. But he wasn’t done speaking.
Draco gave Blaise a small smile. “Yeah,” he said. “She seems alright, too.”
Yes, I hurt people. No, I never killed anyone. No – despite what you may believe, I did not hurt children at Hogwarts. It was not a noble choice, rather it was a line that I felt the Carrows crossed. Wizarding blood – even muggleborn wizarding blood – was worth more, in my eyes, than the blood of muggles. It wasn’t as though I wanted to see muggles killed, not at that point. No, I would have done anything for life to go back to the way it was, where I could continue to be quietly superior. But again, this was not because I believed muggles worthy of saving, rather because I believed no one worthy of killing. That isn’t a redeemable characteristic of mine, simply a self-serving characteristic.
The appointment, thankfully, was fast. They were led into a quiet room - no doubt only afforded to them because Harry was the Boy Who Lived. A much friendlier looking witch assessed him, waving her wand around him in complicated movements to check his vitals while he tried not to flinch.
“Now there’s one more muggle I’m thinking of, from around the same time as Hitler. I’m not sure if anyone will know who I’m talking about or not,” he said, but Mar’s hand had already shot into the air for the fourth time that day. “Alright, Mar, who do you think?”
“The thing is,” Neville continued, “Things will stay this way unless you…well, show your house loyalties, if you know what I mean.”
“Not completely,” she said. “But I will let Minerva know what we discussed and see if she has anything to say to it. Don’t try anything until she approves, alright?”
“I believe Mr Potter would like to be included in any discussion,” Madame Pomfrey said to the Healer, lazily waving her wand in an arc to douse the flame as if it were an everyday occurrence. Then again, maybe it was for her. Harry was quite sure he didn’t know the half of what went on in the Hospital Wing.
really, just Draco. His Draco
Hermione sighed. “Nothing. It doesn’t mean anything.”
“Pansy is going to be angry,” Harry said with a sigh much later. They were curled up on top of the bed facing each other, exchanging gentle caresses and kisses while Draco told Harry about the parade of Slytherin students that had come by the Hospital Wing while Harry was recovering.
She paused a moment, as if to consider. She was tapping her fingers rapidly against her leg as she thought, and it made Harry’s chest feel tight – as though he should be running or moving or doing
“We’ll know soon enough,” Pansy responded. “We have her first…with the seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.”
“If he’s talking about what I think he’s talking about, I bet it was directly before he exploded,” Blaise said. Harry shrugged ruefully, trying to ignore the concerned look Draco was giving him.
“That’s easier said than done,” McGonagall responded, taking a sip of tea before she continued. With the tension gone from the room, Harry let himself slump back in his seat a little bit. “There is much anti-Death Eater sentiment, and for good reason.”
Is this what it had been like in Slytherin, the past six years? Always waiting for conflict, striking before others could strike, unquestioningly doing what Draco said? Although in the past, Draco would never have asked anyone to stand down, Harry knew with certainty. Draco would have led the fight. Harry would never have stood down, either. Not in the Days Before. Nor would he have taken direction from anyone else like this.
Mar furrowed her brow. “But everyone says he’s boring. I think you’ll be a better teacher.” Her fingers were tapping on her thigh again, a fast pattern that Harry couldn’t make sense of.
Ron tossed down a newspaper clipping in front of him, from the Daily Prophet. He could only make out a headline, dark black on the pale parchment of the newspaper.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He leaned back on the pillows and closed his eyes for a moment. “How has wizarding society existed for so long without solutions for problems like this?”
Harry gave him a small smile. “Of course, you great berk. You’re family.”
He stood and stretched, giving Draco a small smile.
“War takes a toll, Harry,” she said after a pause. “Killing takes a toll. Of course it does, or it would be impossible to create something like Horcruxes out of death. You are afraid of your magic.”
Harry saw Zabini raise an eyebrow and exchange a look with Pansy, but he nodded. “Guess that leaves me and Pans. To the grounds it is.” He winked at Draco, and Harry tried to pretend he hadn’t seen.
Harry woke in a haze of confusion to someone shaking him. The first thought his brain supplied was
“You’re Potter whenever you’re annoying me,” he responded loftily. “Which is most of the time.”
“Isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “Tell me, when you waltzed into the castle with Potter in toe and went to find your friends, did it occur to you why it was only them locked away? Why they didn’t save any kids or Slytherins or
She looked surprised, just a little, but hid it quickly. “Let’s not bring it back up,” she said, almost immediately. “I don’t want to think about…” She paused setting up her cauldron to rub her face. “We’re here now. That’s all.”
Harry kissed Draco slowly. Tried to convey what he couldn’t with words; how Draco was essential to him, how being with him felt like breathing again after suffocating for so long. Draco responded in kind, lifting his body against Harry’s, biting at Harry’s lip, making him groan. Before Harry could form a coherent thought, his mind was exploding with stars, and his heart with tenderness.
like he would be good at defence.
Harry couldn’t help it – through the panic, he snorted. “Yes, and instead I went to him willingly,” he countered. “We were all doing our best to survive, we
“I haven’t-” Harry had to pause again, take a deep, shuddering breath. He focussed on his breathing for a moment; slowly in and slowly out, knotting his hands in the bedsheets on either side of him. “The last time I had a dream that bad was after Cedric – after the tournament,” he said. “They were horrible, that summer – the next year, too. Because Voldemort was in my head. And now he’s gone, but…”
“Is it selfish,” Draco whispered in his ear, “that I’m grateful you stayed?”
“Um,” she said, nervously glancing at Ron and Hermione as if only just noticing their presence. Harry gave her an encouraging smile. “Well, I told her she was pretty and then she said if I was acting like a dyke she could make me look like one,” Harry did his best to stifle a gasp. Or groan. He wasn’t sure. “But I didn’t know what that word meant, so I asked and she said I needed shorter hair, and I told her I always wanted short hair but mum never let me, and she said that if I met her in the charms room after curfew she’d cut it for me.”
It took Harry a moment before he realized what thought had crossed his mind, and he mentally kicked himself. As if the Slytherin’s hadn’t suffered, or lost anyone to the war. As if they all hated muggles. Of course they would observe a moment of silence.
Harry sat heavily in the stool next to her, knowing better than to interrupt Hermione when she was angry. He didn’t fancy a flock of charmed birds flying at his head, thank you very much.
“Good morning, Minerva,” he responded. Her name did not roll smoothly off his tongue, and he had to fight the urge to call her
“Not the really big ones,” Jason said. The other first years nodded their agreement. Honestly, Harry thought, they had a point.
their own. So no Gryffindor eighth years for Gryffindor houses, no Ravenclaws for Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs for Hufflepuffs or Slytherin’s for Slytherins. What if someone like Zacharias Smith gets put with Slytherin?” Harry felt Draco tense beside him, saw Blaise’s eyes flicker and the dark look he cast at Pansy.
Harry shrugged. “Could be worse.”
Harry flinched every time the floo came to life and another one of his classmates stepped out. He couldn’t help it. In the Days Before, Harry had disliked travelling by floo, but hadn’t minded it either, not really. In the Days After, to put it simply, he was glad he and Draco had been the first to arrive, so no one but Professor McGonagall had to see him be sick in the potted plant in the corner of her office.
The minute they entered the common room Harry was accosted by the first year Slytherins, led by Mar, scampering around them and begging to know what happened. He refused to explain to them, but reassured them that yes he was alright and yes he would still be teaching History of Magic the next day. Eventually they left him alone, and the rest of the common room seemed confident that he was alright once he had answered all the rapid-fire first year questions and complimented Mar’s haircut, so they were left in relative silence, the four of them.
“I want to,” Draco began shakily. Harry felt his heart contract in
Pansy, Harry, and Draco had been in the Slytherin common room far too late into the night. They had spoken, separately, to each dorm about the upcoming year – had worked on getting to know each and every student (although this was mostly Harry; Pansy and Draco were familiar with the majority of the students in their former house). The younger students had reacted with awe and wonder at the seventh years. Many clung to Pansy, wanting to tell her about their summer or receive comfort about being back at the castle. The older students, meanwhile, were mostly angry and sullen at Harry and Draco’s presence, refusing to speak to anyone other than Pansy. It had been…exhausting.
He couldn’t just leave Teddy. He couldn’t bear to have the small boy out of his sight. Andromeda had already promised up and down that she would attend as many Hogwarts meals with Teddy as possible, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he’d make it to the hols without having his godson with him everywhere he went. Teddy had Andromeda, he knew, but she wouldn’t be able to take care of him forever. Better if Harry started sooner. Plus, the three of them in Andromeda’s small cottage had begun to feel like family, even moreso than the Weasleys had ever been. It was the first time he wondered how children like Ron and Ginny were ever excited at the prospect of going away to boarding school for the year.
Harry had never been more uncomfortable in his life.
“You would be a sane person, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said, exactly as if he were a misbehaving teenager again. But she looked proud, which was something.
Harry took a moment to glance worriedly at Pansy, but her face was blank. Blaise was looking at her with something like awe in his expression. Draco was, if possible, even paler than normal. Harry couldn’t help but remember being taken to the Manor during their year on the run. Draco had been there, not at school. No doubt Pansy’s words had hurt him.
Mar furrowed her brow. “But everyone says he’s boring. I think you’ll be a better teacher.” Her fingers were tapping on her thigh again, a fast pattern that Harry couldn’t make sense of.
The knocking came for a second time before Harry finally made it to the door. It opened to reveal the faces of Ron and Hermione, as Blaise had predicted.
“Well Potter seems to have forgiven you, why can’t they? It’s not as though they were never cruel to you, either,” Blaise said, after a moment’s silence.
I grew up experiencing cognitive dissonance at Hogwarts. Not an excuse, no – I say this only to be able to describe when the cognitive dissonance stopped. It was not in my seventh year of Hogwarts because the only thing I understood then was that the Carrow’s tortured for the sake of pain. It had nothing to do with ideals or beliefs, so I could separate it from my beliefs. Muggles were lesser, but the Carrow’s didn’t care about that. They just wanted to cause harm, and that was undoubtedly evil.
“That still doesn’t explain…” Hermione began, but trailed off when Harry ran an exasperated hand through his hair.
“McGonagall wouldn’t-”
God, but he wished he had a cigarette.
a reflection to write for their muggle studies seminar the previous evening. Perhaps Pansy would help him with that one.
“Did you go out of your way to hurt kids? All those first years?”
“Sure,” she said. They both stood up, Pansy with a small smile on her lips. “But lets find the other two, first, make sure no one’s resorted to fist-fighting instead of wands.”
“Just going to make Teddy’s bottle,” he said, shooting a fleeting glance to Andromeda. He warmed the boy’s bottle as quickly as he could – on the stove; his magic was still prone to powerful fits that tended to set things on fire.
!” Draco sat up suddenly, blocking Harry’s view of the door. But of course, he didn’t need to see who it was to know.
She moved to open the door to the classroom, but looked back at them. “I admit that I thought those in Slytherin would have been safe from the Carrows due to blood status. I see now that I was incorrect; all the Carrows cared about was harm. Hogwarts failed you, and I hold myself responsible for this. I will do all in my power to ensure Slytherin House is a safe and welcome environment for every student that passes throught it as long as I am Headmistress of this school.”
“That’s different-” Draco began, pausing in shock as Pansy burst out laughing.
“Firstly,” she continued, through the whispers of other concerned students, “You will be working with dangerous, volatile potions and ingredients. I do not want to see anyone getting hurt. If you’re fighting with a friend, an ex, an enemy – that all stays at the door. In this classroom I expect everyone, especially my oldest students, to be calm and respectful. If you cannot manage that, you will be asked to leave and to make up your work on your own time.”
“One could argue that you would have a quiet life if you stopped sticking your nose into everyone’s business,” she responded.
“I’d like to open a school,” he said finally. Pansy raised her eyebrows, which he took as permission to continue. “My godfather left me his old house – I’d like to convert it into some sort of primary school that would take in purebloods, halfbloods, and muggleborns before Hogwarts. They’d learn core subjects from muggle schools, but they’d also learn magical basics – history and culture. That way they’re exposed to all ways of living, I suppose,” he finished, somewhat lamely.
Draco smiled. Just a small smile, but it was there. “Hardly,” he said back, almost a quip. “You have a very obnoxious habit of getting out of difficult situations.”
“It’s the Welcome Feast tonight,” Draco continued as Harry sat up. “Andromeda and Teddy will be here.”
“Neither could we,” Pansy said, after a moment of silence. “Nor did any of those tosspots,” she meant the Gryffindors who had been at the castle, he knew. “And they
“Maybe,” she responded with a resigned sigh. “Still, maybe you just need to try again.”
They stood together and parted ways at the door to the Great Hall, Pansy and Blaise heading outside and Draco and Harry turning left towards the Owlrey.
Hermione put her head on the table, cradled in her hands. She didn’t shake off the tentative hand that Harry put on her shoulders.
have. So I don’t see how that makes you or I any worse than them,” she sniffed.
She sighed. “I didn’t particularly want to bring you, but Blaise seems to be of the belief that Draco would murder us if anything happens to you. So I suppose we have to make sure you’re not dumb enough to do anything stupid, now.”
“Oh please,” Ron said, finally. His face was bright red, like there was anger boiling just beneath the surface. Harry could feel the explosion coming – wished he could run, wished he would be able to yell back. In the Days Before he certainly would have been able to – yell back, at least. But in the Days After he was just struck by how desperately he wanted to sleep the world away.
The students began to whisper as he approached them, with all the subtlety that eleven-year-olds possessed. He heard his name whispered and had to fight back a wince. They were children, he couldn’t blame them for the hero worship that he so desperately hated. Even if he
“And when are you planning on doing the rest of your work?” he asked. “Between old McGonagall today and meeting with Binns tomorrow it’s not as though you’ll have time.”
“To brood,” Draco responded, his mouth quirking up.
Harry obliged, gripping harder and increasing the pace. He latched his mouth around Draco’s nipple, sucking in time with his strokes. It didn’t take long for Draco to finish with a stifled cry, nails digging into Harry’s side.
does. You’re just like them. You deserve this.”
Draco turned to look at him, grey eyes crinkling at the corners. “No,” he admitted, “but I can see your shadow.”
“Potter, are you absolutely mental? They’ll hurt him, he can’t even use a wand!” she had jumped up and had a hand on the door already, looking particularly murderous.
“You’re an arse, Harry Potter,” she said, finally. It felt almost a relief to Harry, to hear her say it out loud. “You’re an arse and Ron is an arse and your new friends are horrid and you just - you never think before you do things.”
“You’ve got that look on your face,” Draco said suddenly. He turned and began working his hands through Harry’s hair in a gentle scalp massage. Harry leaned back into the touch.
Perhaps my father going to Azkaban was the best thing for me, really. There is no pressure, nobody’s standards to live up to. Except Professor McGonagall’s. And Andromeda’s. She offered me a place to stay when I graduate – did you know that?
He still hadn’t told the three Slytherins about it. He was beginning to feel that they might be angry with him for hiding it from them. He wasn’t exactly sure why he hadn’t told them, either. There was no
It wasn’t until she had swooped forward and wrapped him in a hug that he realized he had been crying, tear tracks tracing their way down his face and into the soft cashmere of her jumper. A wail sounded from down the hall.
“Surely that’s not how you’re supposed to do it,” came a drawl from behind him.
your brain working.”
around, who was there to bind the wounds of the first year Slytherins? You think the Carrows didn’t hurt us? They didn’t care about blood status, they cared about torturing children. The teachers stopped turning you lot in for breaking rules, but guess what? There was no one to stop the Carrows finding us doing wrong. Ours was the only Common Room they could get into, or had you forgotten?
“Looking for-” he thought better of it. Paused. Tried again. “Why are you here?”
Ginny hummed thoughtfully when he was done. “It will sort itself out,” she said finally. She gave him a pointed look. “It usually does.”
He was dimly aware of their location somehwere near the Hufflepuff common rooms when Professor McGonagall stopped walking. She stood in front of a carving on the wall that looked to be the Hogwarts crest. Dimly, Harry wondered if this was on the Maurader’s Map, although he knew it wasn’t. He was torn between wanting to ask Hermione if she could change the Map to include the eighth year common room, and not wanting to touch anything his father had made.
“Thwarted?” Draco asked as he pulled himself to his feet. “Enjoying what you were seeing, then?”
“Your attention, please!” He jumped and winced as McGonagall clapped her hands to bring the group to attention. He wasn’t the only one, either. Draco’s hand that had been brushing his arm suddenly gripped his wrist hard.
“Today is also a day for grief,” the Headmistress continued, finally. “As we mourn for those who cannot be here with us, for those who will not be waiting for us at home, for those who’s memories still exist in our hearts.
Andromeda just sipped her tea. Harry stifled a sigh. She never made it easy - she’d never ask questions or push him to talk. It was nice, most of the time. But sometimes some things were hard to say.
“Alright?” Draco asked quietly, breath on Harry’s back, body pressed against him under the pressure of the water. Harry could only let out a strangled sort of gasp in response.
“Good, you’re decent,” she said sardonically. “My eyes are saved, to be scarred another day.”
Mar ran forward and, much to Harry’s amusement, flung her arms around Pansy. “Can you show me now?” she asked eagerly.
dilute magic blood. But that isn’t a reason to commit murder. With or without magic, we are all still humans and we can all adapt. I wish this was something I had understood all along. Magic was essential to me as breathing, until it wasn’t. Sometimes the sight of magic makes me sick after all the things I did and I am glad I can no longer use my wand for much.
“You don’t need magic for History of Magic, so I see no reason why not,” she responded after giving him a level look. “However, if you are having difficulty catching up with your school work please inform me. Professor Binns will be able to substitute for you if you need.”
“You need to learn to trust it again,” Andromeda said, gently. “Do you remember the first spell you ever did?”
Draco’s hands strayed, tracing down Harry’s sides, around the curve of his arse, back up to his hair. He stood still, hands on Draco’s waist, letting the other boy explore him, make sure he was intact. “I’m alright, love,” Harry said gently. His words struck Draco out of whatever stupor he seemed to be in because Draco’s hands were fisting in his shirt and pulling him close and his head was resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry was clinging back to him as if he were the only steady thing in the world – which, really, he was sometimes.
HAHA this was only supposed to ever be a one-shot, but I guess here's another chapter. I love this Harry and have a whole character and storyline fleshed out for him now. Should I keep going?? Focus on the fanfics I already have going?? help aaaaah
Harry snorted at that mental image. “Thanks,” he said after a moment of silence. Zabini took his cue, standing up and making his way over to his own bed.
“Oi,” Harry said, although it was mostly false indignance. He was fairly certain he’d be rather useless, at least at first. Even if the Sorting Hat had almost put him in Slytherin, that didn’t mean he knew how to
Draco couldn’t help it – he felt himself blush furiously. Normally, he didn’t mind Harry kissing him or taking his hand no matter who they were in front of. He welcomed the touch, especially in these days after the war – but also as he always had welcomed touch; like when Blaise put an arm around his shoulders or Pansy played with his hair. It was different, right now, though, with both Granger and Weasley now staring daggers through him.
To his surprise, Justin, Ernie, and Seamus all drew their wands, as well. Ernie and Seamus had their wands trained evenly on Zabini. Justin, though, Harry realized with shock, had his wand trained directly on him. At least when they made eye contact Justin had the presence of mind to look slightly abashed.
“Don’t act like you were the only ones who suffered,” Pansy continued angrily. “Don’t act like you’re so righteous. What happened last year, Longbottom? I’ll tell you. You and your cronies painted some stupid graffiti, acted like it was the most rebellious thing in the world. Then Corner got hurt and what happened? You
“I’d like you to each take some time to read what I’ve handed out and then we’ll use the knowledge you’ve learned to help us list some of the similarities between these men, alright?” Most of the class nodded, but Arwen, raised her hand. Harry raised his eyebrow at her and gestured for her to speak.
“Bloody hell Potter,
The other two laughed. In what seemed like unspoken agreement, they all pushed their chairs back. It would be breakfast time soon in the Great Hall and they had to make an appearance – to collect their official professor assignments and meeting times, at any rate.
“I have my moments,” Harry responded in an imitation of Blaise’s arrogant tones. “They’ll probably just yell a lot,” he said, more normally this time.
Blaise put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezed. “I know we’re here, on your bed, in the eighth year dorm at Hogwarts. I know Pansy isn’t far away, probably arguing with Granger instead of sleeping.” He gave Harry a strained smile. “I know Draco is in his little room, probably fast asleep like the peaceful twat he is.” This wasn’t true, they both knew, but was comforting somehow. “I know Slughorn is in the dungeons, definitely in some sort of
“Everything hurts,” Harry said, sighing again. Perhaps in the Days Before he would have said he was fine, just so he could get back to his friends and his dormitory; would have protested having to stay in the hospital wing. But in the Days After he was simply tired – too tired to protest, too tired to heal, too tired to lie.
“I was sleeping,” he said. “Haven’t been sleeping well.”
By the time they entered the Great Hall, he was on high alert – every sound making him jump and shake. Draco was still holding his hand on one side and Blaise had materialized on the other, both keeping him steady. Pansy was ahead of them, saying goodbye to the Hufflepuffs as well as a couple Ravenclaws that had joined along the way.
Harry felt Draco lower himself onto him, his mouth never leaving Harry’s. They rocked together, breath’s coming in sharp gasps, hands quivering, bodies straining. Draco came first, with a soft keening cry. He reached his hand down, speeding up his pace against Harry’s cock until his world exploded into a blaze of light.
“Sure,” he said, turning back to Ron and Hermione. “Maybe we can go for a walk.”
He had spent the summer pulling strings at the ministry, too. Himself, Andromeda, and Professor McGonagall of all people, to be exact. It had ended, after appeals to the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic himself, with permisson for Draco to visit his mother and Andromeda as long as he provided a written request to the Ministry a week before and did not bring his wand.
“I need to go…” Pansy spoke, but trailed off slowly. “Not be here,” she finally said with a sigh. “Maybe a walk on the grounds will do it. Are you lot coming?”
“Then, last year, he didn’t come to school. Rumour was going around he was in hiding with his mum – she was never a Death Eater. Not many women were, though. And this year it seems he’s become pals with your lot. That’s all, really.”
Confused, at least a little, Harry raised an eyebrow. “I already said it’s part of his parole. The Headmistress is confident in him, the plans were put together long before we came back to Hogwarts. I don’t see how I have anything to do with it.”
It was two months to the date since the Battle of Hogwarts, marked in Harry’s mind as two months Since I Died. That was how life seemed to be these days, in the slowness of recovering and learning how to live in a world free of Voldemort. There were the Days Before – his whole childhood marked by danger lurking around the corner – and the Days After – marked by fear and flashbacks. Hermione had been reading, of course, her only coping mechanism, really. She threw around words like “post traumatic stress” and “anxiety” as if she had been studying them her entire life. Harry preferred to call it “Maybe I Should Have Stayed Dead”.
“Okay,” Harry responded. He felt like he was missing something – they were always up early to eat by themselves in the kitchens, but surely waking a little bit late wasn’t the end of the world. Especially now that the castle was full of students, not just eighth years.
Technically he couldn’t write such a note – he wasn’t fully staff, but he doubted any of the teachers would begrudge him. “If you find any first years or second years in other houses that aren’t doing work, take them too,” he said.
He glanced over at Ron and Hermione. They were both watching with unabashed curiosity. Ron still looked like he was fuming. With some effort, he turned a smile to her. “What, Mar?”
of September with everyone else since they were still in Australia.
Pansy smiled down at the girl and gently disentangled herself. “I’ll show you after dinner,” Pansy said. “Look, Professor Vector is handing out your timetables now. You don’t want to miss that.”
“It seems as though you had an argument with Mr Weasley and Ms Granger, correct?” she continued. Harry nodded affirmatively, hoping she wouldn’t ask what it was about.
“Draco has choices now and he’s making the right ones. Have you seen how so many of the kids here interact with him and Pansy? You don’t have to like it, ‘Mione, but the DA failed here. And I’m not saying I expected them to keep putting themselves in harms’ way. We were all just kids. But when they left, when they hid by themselves, it was Draco and Pansy and Blaise and Daphne that took over. And it was them from the start, keeping the Slytherins safe.” Harry sighed. “No one is going to wake up the next morning and be over it. But we can at least start.”
Yes, I hurt people. No, I never killed anyone. No – despite what you may believe, I did not hurt children at Hogwarts. It was not a noble choice, rather it was a line that I felt the Carrows crossed. Wizarding blood – even muggleborn wizarding blood – was worth more, in my eyes, than the blood of muggles. It wasn’t as though I wanted to see muggles killed, not at that point. No, I would have done anything for life to go back to the way it was, where I could continue to be quietly superior. But again, this was not because I believed muggles worthy of saving, rather because I believed no one worthy of killing. That isn’t a redeemable characteristic of mine, simply a self-serving characteristic.
Harry nodded and turned to watch Teddy play with the bubbles floating around above his head. Every time he popped one with his chubby little fingers, another appeared.
“That’s our cue,” Pansy sighed. “Remember to try not to make an idiot of yourself.” She cast a look at Harry specifically. He just rolled his eyes, He had learned, in the past week, that she got like this when she was nervous – angry and abrasive. Or rather, more angry and abrasive than usual.
In hindsight, perhaps inviting Draco Malfoy to Andromeda’s house had been Harry’s second particularly stupid decision after the war. The first being that night on the astronomy tower, of course.
“She’s not going to keep that secret,” Blaise muttered to Harry. Harry found himself laughing, a rare occurrence.
Her smile was gentle, but Harry still frowned at her words. For the past three months they had shared house duties and Teddy duties. It had kept Harry from sinking into despair, even through the sleepless nights where the boy cried and cried, missing the mum and dad he had never known.
Harry smiled as Pansy stopped pacing immediately and started at McGonagall, mouth agape slightly. He nudged her and she closed it.
Draco snorted inelegantly. “No one can ever get any work done when Pansy Parkinson is around.” But he stood up from the chair and jumped onto the bed, straddling Harry at his hips. “Is this what you want?” he leaned forward, his breath in Harry’s ear, nose brushing his cheek.
I AM SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG i have been working like 70 hour weeks and really not loving it, had absolutely no time to write until now. but finally another chapter full of wholesome pansy and draco content. apologies in advance for my sorting hat song i do Not poetry
really, just Draco. His Draco
“They’re always vague like this, here,” she said to him as gently as he’d ever heard her speak. “I don’t find it good practice to beat around the bushes with my students.”
They actually made it to lunch without being accosted by a single Slytherin first year. The first years had spent most of the previous day shadowing them, and even Pansy had noted that it felt strange that morning when not a single one approached.
Of course, you got away, Harry with my wand. The danger that put me in – suffice to say I was punished and badly. Did you know it is much harder to practice occlumency without a wand? I do, now. But it was irrelevant at that point, I had the seeds of doubt placed and I looked only to survive from then on. Make little noise, do as I was told, don’t argue. I was not allowed to go back to Hogwarts. They wanted to keep an eye on me.
One of the seventh year prefects, a boy named Andrew, gave them a look when they approached. “We’re just deciding if we should tell the first years to get lost or not,” he said as they approached. “It’s become impossible to get work done.”
Mar gave Harry an eager wave as the four friends scrambled out of the common room to get to the Great Hall on time. Somehow, though, Harry didn’t think this was going to be the last time they were going to discuss the issue.
out of his element watching it all unfold.
lost people, Smith. I don’t blame her; neither should anyone else.” He turned his voice, then, to the crowd that had gathered around them. Most of them looked slightly incredulous. Hannah Abbott was looking rapidly between Harry and Zacharias. Neville and Dean were standing to the side, speaking with each other in rapid whispers. Nott looked distinctly uncomfortable, but was standing resolutely near Neville and Dean.
Hermione huffed out a breath and pushed her hair out of her face. “I didn’t want you to worry,” she said, finally, looking at him out of the side of her eye. “If it helps, Ron wanted me to be honest.”
Her tapping stopped, replaced almost immediately with bouncing on the balls of her feet. “Okay!” she said, before sprinting back to her friends.
“Um-”
For Draco, McGonagall had pulled some strings, it seemed, and under the guise of being supervised for “disciplinary measures” required by the ministry, she had put him in a Potions placement with the new professor (a young woman Harry had only seen on a couple occasions at meal times), which he was enjoying imennsely.
Draco felt Harry’s hand grip him, perhaps reflexively, but he didn’t look over. He opened his mouth to say – well, he wasn’t sure
“Your room,” Harry groaned, mustering every ounce of self control to let go of Draco’s wrists and prop himself up slightly. “Let’s go there.”
Ron tossed down a newspaper clipping in front of him, from the Daily Prophet. He could only make out a headline, dark black on the pale parchment of the newspaper.
“You can,” came a voice from behind him – Pansy’s voice. Draco had come with her, and he pressed the back of his hand against the back of Harry’s hand when they approached.
Draco looked stunned. “She did?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, shifting in his seat. He could tell she wasn’t upset or disappointed, not exactly, but he hated that she worried over him.
Harry felt Smith’s eyes lock onto him. “There’s no reason for you to be around them, Harry. We can talk to McGonagall, or the Minister. I’m sure they’d switch your rooms for you. If anyone deserves their own rooms, it’s you. Not this scum.” He indicated Draco with a jut of his chin.
“Oh, I’m Potter now, am I?” Harry smirked, but Draco had stubbornly turned back to his essay and wasn’t looking.
Do not misunderstand me, I am not upset by this. It was quite cunning of her, really. She understood that I was, in part, willing to learn – I just didn’t want it to seem like my idea.
“What’s wrong with liking other girls?” Mar asked, scrunching her face again.
i am...very fond of this chapter, i think
Predictably, Gryffindor cheered. The man who stood up and waved also seemed quite young, although older than the two other professors that had been introduced. He was rather handsome, too, Harry thought – quite tall, with sandy blonde hair and broad shoulders. He certainly
Have you heard of cognitive dissonance? I learned about it this summer. When you’re presented with knowledge that goes against your beliefs, your brain ignores it – literally, unless you can consciously confront it. It’s a muggle idea – as many ideas about the brain are. They call it psychology. I don’t know why wizards have never bothered to study the mind, it seems so important.
Opening his eyes, Harry reached forward and traced the newer scars on Draco’s chest, caressed the Mark on his arm. “It was war, Draco. We all have blood on our hands.”
“Granger,” she ground out. Harry snorted, surprising simultaneously himself and the three surrounding him.
was untouchable and aloof, but it made me crave his acceptance and love more. My most cherished memories are when he would pay me attention; he would sit me on the desk in his study and speak with me as if I were a man, not a young boy. He would tell me about my legacy as a wizard, as a Malfoy. Explain to me the importance of pure blood. Why shouldn’t I have believed him?
*small note, the title of the chapter is not from a poem as Pansy implies, but rather part of the song they sing at Dumbledore's funeral in the movie, lol
“Not always,” Hermione said.
Then I became a Death Eater. Again, I will not make excuses. I could say I was under pressure, there was a madman in my house, my family was under threat, my other option was death. Perhaps this is not untrue, but nobler wizards that I would have chosen death. Nobler wizards than I would rather have died than do the things I did. I chose, out of my own free will to follow the Dark Lord. I believed in the world he wanted, a world where wizards ruled; where we did not live in fear. I did not realize that we have power already, just as muggles do. I did not realize that we are not oppressed, rather that we live in a world of our choosing – a world that benefits us, a world that makes us oppressors of magical beings and, to some extent, muggles. I did not realize, but that does not excuse me. The consequences are mine, too.
Harry couldn’t actually tell what time it was, but they had found, once they had made it to their room the night before, that it had enchanted windows. They seemed to be similar to the ceiling of the Great Hall, showing with at least some accuracy the weather and time of day outside. Judging by the windows, the sun was just now peaking above the horizon.
“Idiot,” Harry responded as he wrapped his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling the other man’s head back and tasting the salty sweet of his skin. He unwrapped his hands, pressing his hips against Draco’s, relishing in the sweet pressure, before pulling back. Draco was watching him, and he watched right back, unabashedly taking in Draco’s flushed lips, the bruises forming on his neck.
When Madame Pomfrey gestured him towards the Floo in the foyer of Saint Mungos, he didn’t hesitate. Except it wasn’t Hogwarts he called for when he stepped in. He was only dimly aware of his words calling “Tonks Cottage” and Madame Pomfrey’s exasperated look before he spun away.
After a beat of silence, Draco sighed. “They’ve been talking about it for ages,” he said gently to Harry. “It was bound to happen.”
“You’re all making it awfully hard to focus,” Draco said, finally looking over from Harry’s desk.
“Shut
“Now, have I assumed correctly that you are here to speak with me and not taking a casual stroll around the castle? If I’m wrong, by all means,” she gestured to the corridor behind her. Harry had to stifle his laugh at Pansy’s confused look.
“That was…” Pansy trailed off with a grimace.
“Let’s get you up,” he muttered to the boy, brushing the last of his tears from his eyes before leaning into the crib and scooping Teddy up by his armpits. He moved the boy to the change table to change his nappy quickly - no matter what he said about equality and muggles, some things were just better with magic. This was one of those things.
Harry nudged him in the side with his foot.
“Just this,” he whispered back, before fading once again into sleep.
“I don’t stick my nose in other people’s business,” Harry responded mulishly. Minerva just raised an eyebrow at him as if he were a misbehaving first year. It almost made him feel like a misbehaving first year. “What kind of person would I be,” he said after a moment, “if I didn’t speak up for the people who needed it? I have a voice, I have to use it somehow.”
It was Draco, of course, with a plate of breakfast and a concerned look on his face. “Blaise told us what happened,” he said, and it took a moment for the memories to come rushing back in. His nightmare, Lupin’s pale face, Tonks’ haunted eyes, Sirius’ anger and Colin’s despair – Bellatrix holding his friends hostage. His stomach heaved despite himself.
“Noticed you don’t have a room, Death Eater,” came a voice in front of them. It was Zacharias Smith, of course. Harry was utterly unsurprised, although he was more surprised to see Justin, Ernie, and Seamus flanking him.
Harry couldn’t help but make a face at that. “Is it so wrong to just want a quiet life?” he asked with a sigh. Realistically, he was only kind of joking. Sort of.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, giving Harry an unguarded smile.
Mar started to nod, but another girl – Jessamine, gave him a doleful look. “It’s raining,” she said glumly. Harry tried not to sigh – at least not too aggressively.
“No,” she said. “You’re here now, and if you’re going to stay you’re going to listen. You do not get to speak.”
“Alright,” Harry began once his last first year had trickled into the classroom, “Today we’re going to talk a little bit about some similarities in some well known evil Muggles and well known evil Wizards.” The class tittered excitedly, as if learning about evil was the best news they’d received all week. Harry laughed to himself as he turned toward the chalk board.
It took him a moment to locate her. She was the smallest of the bunch, tucked in near the back of the huddle. She looked less nervous than the others, though – more self-assured. She stood up from the bench, too, as he neared, and flipped long, black hair out of her face. In a way, she reminded him of a young Hermione.
Harry felt him nod along with the others as they triapsed out of the Common Room, the door grinding closed behind them. “What does the password mean?” Harry asked as they left.
He had fought with Ron and Hermione of course, many times, but it was never quite like this. It never felt like it was something that might never be repaired. Never felt quite like the end of the world – a signal, if anything, that the Days Before were really behind him. Perhaps in the Days After he wasn’t friends with Ron and Hermione – perhaps it was marked by death. His own, his friendships, his old life.
“It was, at that.” They both jumped at a voice behind them. It was Professor McGonagall, having clearly just exited her office, which was just around the corner. Harry felt himself blush.
In the Days Before, Harry would have bristled at the nickname. Now he just shrugged. “Wasn’t expecting you,” he said dully, not quite looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
“Firstly,” she continued, through the whispers of other concerned students, “You will be working with dangerous, volatile potions and ingredients. I do not want to see anyone getting hurt. If you’re fighting with a friend, an ex, an enemy – that all stays at the door. In this classroom I expect everyone, especially my oldest students, to be calm and respectful. If you cannot manage that, you will be asked to leave and to make up your work on your own time.”
Harry couldn’t help it – he made a face. The thought of Binns teaching his first years, especially Mar, gave him a weird feeling. “Is that everything?” He asked, before the Headmistress could say anything about the face he made. She looked like she wanted to.
“We’re hunting for fish,” Mar said, so innocently Harry had to focus to keep from laughing. Draco and Blaise were both watching from somewhere behind him – he only knew because he could distinctly hear both of them laughing.
outside of your stupid club with them?”
“How did you meet her?” Blaise asked from Draco’s other side. Harry felt Draco’s chest shake with laugher against his back.
“Funny,” he said. “Very funny.”
. Fitting, all things considered.”
“Some of you might know about them already, you’re right,” he said with a nod, “but not all of you. You’re in a unique position Arwen, because you’ve been to non-magic school and now you’re at a magic school. But many people in your class haven’t had the chance to go to a school that isn’t magic, and even if they did you don’t always learn about the same things. And there are some people here, like you, who didn’t know they were magic until they turned eleven, but they haven’t been interested in spending their time reading up on people like Grindlewald.” He let a teasing note enter his voice, “Believe it or not, there are some things that are more pleasant to read about.”
That’s why he smoked, he reflected, taking a long drag of the cigarette. Smoking receded the shadows. It calmed his breathing when everything was too much.
“I like it,” she said finally, snapping him out of his moment of concern. “I’ll be Mar, then.”
“I have to go send a letter to Andromeda,” Harry responded. “But I’ll see you after my meeting with McGonagall.”
There was no urgency, but neither did they hold back. Harry braced his arms at either side of Draco’s head, kissing down his neck, rutting against him and relishing in the feel of the pressure it created. He moved his body lower, kissing his chest, pausing to catch his nipple between his teeth, listen to Draco keen with want.
“I’d like you to each take some time to read what I’ve handed out and then we’ll use the knowledge you’ve learned to help us list some of the similarities between these men, alright?” Most of the class nodded, but Arwen, raised her hand. Harry raised his eyebrow at her and gestured for her to speak.
“They don’t,” Draco said with a harsh breath. Then he was pulling Harry – or Harry was pulling him, maybe – by the hand in the direction of his room.
Both Weasley and Granger had gone quiet, Draco noted with some satisfaction. “That’s right – they don’t know. And they don’t care, either.”
“If it’s your fault, it’s mine, too,” Harry said, looking at him hard. They were standing facing each other, less than an arms length apart. Harry had to tilt his head slightly to look Draco in the eye. When Draco began to protest, he continued. “I could have gone to him sooner; could have given up sooner. I should have. Less people would have died. But I was scared, so I didn’t. But you – you saved me when it counted. If it hadn’t been for you at the Manor, I would have been dead.”
“Really?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Only, I imagine there’s a lot of work that goes into her job. What do you help with?” She looked uncomfortable again – about speaking so eagerly to him? Or something else? Harry wasn’t sure.
“I want to get Muggle Studies out of the way,” Blaise said with a sigh. “No use in putting it until the last minute and then not being able to graduate after all this.”
“What’s the story with Nott, anyways?” Harry broke the silence to ask Pansy curiously.
“I’m okay,” Harry said instead, pulling back as much as he could to look Draco in the face, running his hands through the other boy’s hair again. Draco’s hand came up, tracing the lines of his cheekbones, running through his hair, which Harry was certain was even more unruly than usual.
With that, she swept out of the room, emerald robes trailing after her. Moments later, Harry found himself rather uncomfortably holding a sobbing Pansy Parkinson.
It was hard to fight what I’ve learned – to learn new ways to live and see the world. Did you know that muggles have been to the moon? I did not. I think that is fascinating. Even with all the magic at our hands, wizards have never even dreamt of entering space. I am dithering, though.
“No one’s allowed to visit me,” Draco responded sardonically. He didn’t, Harry noted, say no.
She wrinkled her nose at him. “No, my name is Maribel, so that’s what you call me.”
“Part of what we’re going to do in this class is make sure that your reading and writing abilities are good enough to help you keep up in your other classes. And if they’re not, we’ll figure out how to fix it. Today, to see where we’re all at, I’d like you all to write me six inches on what piece of history you’d like to learn about most this year. It can be something I already mentioned, or something I didn’t, and it can be magical history or muggle history.”
The eighth years followed McGonagall out of her office and down the spiralling staircase into the main body of the castle. It had been rebuilt well, a far cry from the castle’s appearance when they had all gathered for the two month anniversary of the battle. Paintings had been restored, walls rebuilt. But everywhere Harry looked, he saw flashes from the past in his mind eye; crumbling walls, curses flying, Fred falling, Colin Creevy still on the ground, Lavendar Brown’s body broken on the corridor floor.
Hermione sat up and scrubbed at her face. For a strange moment, Harry thought she was just going to get up and walk out of the kitchen - away from him. But instead she leaned into his side and let him wrap his arm around her. It reminded him startlingly of camping in the Forest of Dean, just the two of them against the world.
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco said suddenly. Harry turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow sleepily. “You look a mess,” Draco said fondly.
He gasped as Draco’s lips came back up to his, let himself go pliant underneath Draco’s hands, too tired to really do anything except
cried leaving in a flood of tears had done more to shake his confidence than anything had since the war itself. He sat down heavily on Harry’s bed, and it seemed to shake everyone out of their surprised stupor.
“It seems as though you had an argument with Mr Weasley and Ms Granger, correct?” she continued. Harry nodded affirmatively, hoping she wouldn’t ask what it was about.
Your affable acquaintance,
, probably something rude about Weasley’s, but Pansy beat him to it.
Harry winced. “I’d like to think it would have been different if I had been here, but I know nothing would have changed.” He sighed. “All summer Andromeda had to remind me that we were still kids when it all happened. I’ve used Unforgavbles, I’ve killed people, I doubt any of us were charming to you lot either, when we were in our younger years.”
more than what has been handed to me.
And then he was pulling away from her, dodging a slap that was aimed at his shoulder and laughing like he hadn’t laughed in ages.
There were probably healthier ways to achieve the same thing. Meditation, maybe. Occlumency, probably. But he’d never been good at either. When he smoked, at least he didn’t have to put in effort.
“Of course,” Harry said warmly to Andromeda instead. She handed him over and with a small squeeze of Harry’s shoulder she was off to the High Table. The timing was good – just as she left, the sorting hat was sat upon its stool by Professor McGonagall. Harry shifted Teddy in his arms so he could lean against Draco as the hat began its song.
, he couldn’t help but think. It was his fault.
He did his best not to laugh, but really – it was hard. “Okay, do you have a nickname or a different name I can call you?”
“She won’t,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter, anyways.”
“You’re not upset?” Harry asked, incredulous. He would be upset if his movements were being tracked, spells monitored, conversations listened to.
Harry was transfixed on the two of them. Neville had gone ghostly white, Pansy was flushed and shaking.
It seemed to bring the nerves back in the group – they all shifted uncomfortably for a moment. The boy who suggested the name Mari piped up again, looking distinctly more nervous this time. “I heard it’s in the dungeons,” he said, quietly.
“He was never in my head,” Blaise said, “so I know it’s not the same. But sometimes, it helps me to focus on things I know are true.” He looked up at Harry in the darkness, the whites of his eyes shining. Were they just bright, or were those tears? There were tears in his own eyes, Harry realized – he hadn’t noticed until now.
“Harry,” the familiar voice sounded behind him before he even had the chance to see if she had made her way down from the table. He turned in his seat, accidentally knocking Draco’s hand off his knee as he turned.
Hermione rolled her eyes, although it looked half-hearted. “Your consequences were winning a war. His were hurting people and probation.”
Draco heaved a deep sigh when he was done. “No wonder she didn’t want to talk about it,” he said finally. “It’s funny, that year was so horrible, but perhaps if it hadn’t happened the way it had we would all still be as horrid as we were in sixth year.”
“The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin when I was sorted,” he continued. Pansy looked up, shocked. “Everyone says it was because I had part of Voldemort’s soul in me, or something. I talked to Andromeda about it, too. She was Slytherin, you probably know that. She was horrid when she was younger, too. But Slytherin – ambition, cunning, valuing friendships, even – I don’t think any of those are bad traits, not any longer. And I think they all represent me, too. Maybe the House system has just been taken too far.
Harry felt himself draw his wand and raise it. It wasn’t conscious, was completely instinct – something that remained from the Days Before, perhaps. He saw a flash in his peripheral vision – Zabini, also drawing his wand.
“Does anyone know the name of another wizard who started wars before Riddle, when many of your grandparents or great-grandparents were young?”
“Two, and neither of them defence professors? You continue to surprise me, Potter.” He saw her glance at him out of the corner of her eye. “Binns could very well be horrid. Don’t come complaining to me when you regret your choice.”
Harry nodded absently to Draco and instead turned his head to Andromeda. “Would you like help with the washing up?”
also i made a tumblr?? i don't know how to use it, but you can find me as CaspianJames and maybe I'll learn how to use it so I can post about the fics and things I'm working on (more drarry? yes. long haul drarry? yes. fix it fic drarry? yes. trans harry? yes. so much yes.)
“What if,” he said finally, meeting Andy’s eyes for the first time. “What if I wasn’t supposed to come back? What if it…threw off some sort of balance? Like in the Tale of the Three Brothers. They couldn’t escape Death forever. You can’t run from it. What if…what if this is my way of dying again? Restoring balance?”
“You are so goddamn beautiful, Draco Malfoy,” he whispered in the other boy’s ear. He felt the moment Draco’s breath stopped, the moment he started breathing again.
“We haven’t been anywhere without Pansy or Blaise all week,” Harry said, watching Draco intently. “I’m just saying, we can work on assignments when we’re with them.”
“Nothing,” he said evenly, although privately he was shocked. Shocked, mostly, to think that he had spent seven years in classes with the group of people before him and had not an inkling of what any of them were interested in. “What about you, Zabini?”
All of this being said, I deeply apologize for the horrid person that I was, that I sometimes still am. Hermione, I targeted you constantly. I called you slurs, implied you were less than me but for a simple accident of birth. I will not bring up every incident – indeed there are likely too many to even recount here, but I am truly sorry for my deplorable actions. I am a better man now, and I will be better in the future. I understand how I have hurt you, how I contributed to a society that was bent on seeing you fail. I will no longer contribute to this. I will actively oppose these ideals for the rest of my life in any way that I can. You are welcome to hold me accountable for this.
There wasn’t anyone waiting for him, though – except Draco. He was looking away from the door when Harry stepped out, sat on the stone floor with his knees drawn to his chest. Harry leaned against the wall, taking a moment to watch him.
Her tapping stopped, replaced almost immediately with bouncing on the balls of her feet. “Okay!” she said, before sprinting back to her friends.
“You sound much too cheerful about that,” Harry responded. A strange warmth was pooling in his stomach, though. Sure, Hogwarts was undeniably different. But perhaps it was still home.
He turned to write his instructions on the chalk board. He could have done it by magic, sure, and it would have been faster, but there was always the chance he’d make the chalkboard explode instead. He should really, probably tell McGonagall about how unstable his magic was being.
“You’re right,” said Harry, drawing a surprised look from Blaise. Which was mildly hurtful, he thought. Surely they’d know how he’d feel about this better by now. “I’m going to go talk to her, make sure there’s a Slytherin for the Slytherins.”
She waited a breath. Harry could feel the air in the Great Hall tremble, on the precipice of great relief and sadness. It was a physical feeling, the air around him was literally vibrating, as if straining to hold back the emotion. Was this a product of death, being able to feel the emotions so keenly?
Harry sighed inwardly. “We don’t have houses this year.” He was being deliberately stubborn. He knew what Neville meant, of course. Knew he didn’t mean it in bad faith, not exactly. They were all scared and scarred in their own ways.
“Mary, she’s a
“Well, how would you put it?” Ginny asked after a moments silence. Seeing he wasn’t going to get out of it, Harry relayed to her the events of the first week – everything from the first day in the eighth year common room to smuggling Draco out that morning.
“Probably throwing a temper tantrum because he can’t see you,” Andromeda responded, smiling softly.
“You’re jealous of Ginny,” he said.
“They really are trying to make sure we have the most work possible, aren’t they?” Blaise sighed. Draco smiled at him, but Harry noticed that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. He knew it was frustrating to Draco to watch his classmates get to choose professors to shadow, be assigned to rooms, help younger students, meanwhile he wasn’t even allowed to carry a wand outside of class.
He took another drag – too deep – and coughed.
And maybe, there was a chance they could change that, starting now. They were all children in a war, after all. Andromeda had said that to him often.
“You should report that to McGonagall, you know,” Hermione said once Mar was out of earshot.
“Maybe it was a magical fish?” Harry said. It came out as a question – he didn’t know
“It was, at that.” They both jumped at a voice behind them. It was Professor McGonagall, having clearly just exited her office, which was just around the corner. Harry felt himself blush.
, but rather nervous about how they would react to him, or if he would even be any good at this.
With that, she swept out of the room, emerald robes trailing after her. Moments later, Harry found himself rather uncomfortably holding a sobbing Pansy Parkinson.
“I saw people who-” he shuddered at the memory, leaned into Draco’s touch “-who died in the war. They blamed me.” He didn’t specify, didn’t need to, not for Draco to understand. Draco leaned over to kiss him again, hands cupping either side of his face.
He waited a moment as the class reached into their bags to pull out the requested materials, and stayed quiet until they were all settled and focused again on  him. “For the second half of the class today,” he continued, “I think we can play some games that will help us all get to know each other. But for the first half of the class I have a writing exercise for you all.” There was a collective groan from the class that he couldn’t help but laugh at.
“Perhaps,” Draco said, thoughtfully. “It didn’t end horribly last time, really.”
As they sat, Harry looked up to see Neville had abandoned his seat to make his say over to them. He pulled up a seat beside Harry and perched himself gingerly upon it, looking around furtively as if worried he’d be seen. Harry gave a glance around the room, but mostly people were talking amongst themselves. The only ones wo were looking were Dean and Seamus, which Harry expected, and Zacharias Smith. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye all three Slytherin’s lean in closely towards Neville and Harry.
He was dimly aware of their location, somewhere underground, near the Hufflepuff common rooms, when Professor McGonagall stopped walking. She stood in front of a carving on the wall that looked to be the Hogwarts crest. Dimly, Harry wondered if this was on the Marauder’s Map, although he knew it wasn’t. He was torn between wanting to ask Hermione if she could change the Map to include the eighth year common room, and not wanting to touch anything his father had made.
The air carried a slight chill, as if it knew it was the first day of term. He struck off in the direction of the forest, opting to take a path beside the lake. It was peaceful here, the most peaceful place he had been in days.
“There are magical fish?” she asked in wonder. Harry couldn’t help but smile.
“That’s why your school is such a good idea, Potter,” said Pansy, scrunching her face as if the compliment hurt her to hand out. “It provides an option for families that wouldn’t normally have one.”
Harry quitely filed away another discovery under his list of Days After traits:
“So are you,” Harry responded, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. In the Days Before, he would never have imagined this conversation would ever happen. But right now, if he were being honest with himself, he felt closer to Pansy than he did Ron and Hermione. “Are you okay?”
Before Andy could say anything else, McGonagall came bustling into Harry’s little area of the Hospital Wing, Madame Pomfrey in tow.
He thought that McGonagall looked slightly abashed, but she didn’t say anything to address it.
“Oh, love,” Andromeda said with a sigh, breaking him out of his stupor. She reached out to take his hand. He clung back as if he were a child. “They will come around. I know it’s hard, but give them time. They’re grieving, too.”
. “Can I,” Draco tried again, “Can I ride you?”
“No,” Draco ground out again, supressing a shudder. He had been hurt in exchange for his refusal, been punished while he was at the Manor for Christmas, and then again for Easter.
Harry’s breathing began to slow, his brain catching up to his surroundings. He was in Hogwarts, he was perfectly safe, and he recognized that voice.
“Idiot,” Harry responded as he wrapped his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling the other man’s head back and tasting the salty sweet of his skin. When Harry lifted his head, Draco was watching him. He watched right back, unabashedly taking in Draco’s flushed lips, the bruises forming on his neck.
Everyone was changed, but he knew what he thought it would be like – curtains pulled around their four-poster beds, silencing spells casted, grief dealt with quietly, screaming from nightmares hushed. When he looked at the three of them – which he didn’t often, hurt as he was by their behaviour – he imagined that his guesses weren’t far off. They often looked drawn and tired. Then again, they had more horrendous memories here than he ever had, really. Nothing he had experienced could amount to the seventh year they had spent here.
Pansy let out a small, dark laugh. “He’s interesting,” she finally said. “His dad was a Death Eater, I’m sure you know. His mum left him when we were in second year, I think. Left Theo with his dad for the whole summer between second and third year, thought it was still important for them to bond, I think.”
Before Andy could say anything else, McGonagall came bustling into Harry’s little area of the Hospital Wing, Madame Pomfrey in tow.
Pansy muttered something under her breath that definitely included the phrases
In the Days Before, Harry would have bristled at the nickname. Now he just shrugged. “Wasn’t expecting you,” he said dully, not quite looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
Did you know Lovegood is my cousin? A couple times removed, but nonetheless. And Ollivander – both are pureblood. Lovegood a blood traitor, perhaps, but I couldn’t see how that made her life any less worthy. And although she was a prisoner in my home, she became my source of comfort with stories of her mother and her life, her friends, her strange animals.
Harry sighed. He could feel Hermione’s eyes boring through the back of his head, refused to turn back, to see the judgement of Mar he knew must be on their faces. He focused on Mar, who was hitting her leg now, with the bottom of her fist. Not hard enough to hurt, but he was worried, a bit.
I maaay have stolen some visuals from the movie (as opposed to the books) for part of this chapter. Please don’t hate me, it was more dramatic. Some frank discussions of war and PTSD-like symptoms although the phrase is never used, just as a trigger warning!
“What’s going on?” he asked, once he felt more oriented. Pansy was sitting up on his left, glaring at Blaise, who was standing over her. Draco was still curled up beside Harry, their legs tangled underneath the bedsheets. Ahh DS Ah FHalf of him wanted to stay like this all day.
“I wasn’t on school grounds in the first place,” Harry said grumpily, but he felt himself lighten all the same. “Shall I take Teddy through?”
“Stop being melodramatic,” Pansy chastised him. She was running her fingers through his hair, which he typically found quite relaxing, but today it made his insides squirm. “They’re Gryffindors, they’re the most
It was clearly not the type of evening where any work was getting done, though. They curled up on the couch in front of the fire, Draco with his head in Harry’s lap and legs across Pansy and Blaise, the latter seated with his back to the armrest of the couch so he could face everyone, talking aimlessly amongst themselves.
He headed into the sitting room, picking up Teddy, who was dozing, and depositing himself on the couch. Harry nuzzled the bottle between the boy’s lips until he latched, holding him close.
It said.
The only eighth years who wouldn’t be there, as far as Harry knew, were Ron and Hermione. They had been given permission to arrive the 1
“I think this counts as exertion,” Harry said between gasps.
“Merlin, that’s twice in one day,” Draco groused as Zabini vanished the evidence with a flick of his wand.
When his trousers were off, Draco guided him onto the bed. Every nerve of Harry’s was on fire, every spot Draco touched him felt like a blaze.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, giving Harry an unguarded smile.
“Why do we have to read this? Shouldn’t we all know about them already?” she looked genuinely confused, and there were more than a couple students who looked like they agreed with her. He settled himself on top of his desk and regarded the class.
Harry felt him nod along with the others as they traipsed out of the Common Room, the door grinding closed behind them. “What does the password mean?” Harry asked as they left.
Blaise burst out laughing, presumably at the look on Pansy’s face. Even Harry found a small smile from within himself.
“Alright?” Draco came into the room and sat delicately beside him on the couch. Andromeda followed behind him and deposited herself into the armchair by the fire, which she lit with a lazy wave of her wand.
They walked in silence. Harry felt tense, could feel the energy crackling between them. It was almost amusing, he thought. In the Days Before he was so oblivious, he never would have noticed. But in the Days After, every feeling, every sense, every thought he had ever had was amplified.
Draco maneuvered him away from the wall for a moment so Harry could shake off his robes and shirt. Draco’s hands and lips trailed across Harry’s body as he pulled his clothes off, until he was a whimpering mess. He reached for his own tie but found Draco’s hands on his before he could even begin to undo it.
“Okay,” a couple voices chorused back, and then there was silence – or mostly silence – as they all set quill to paper.
She nodded once, as if he had passed some sort of test. “You’d best be careful,” she said, “Or you’ll make yourself a politician.”
“I should have been a better friend,” he said after a moment. “I’m sorry.”
Pansy was pacing. Harry thought she looked shocked from her own outburst, was sure she had planned to say something more eloquently. But she looked the Headmistress in the eyes and didn’t back down.
“I’ll be teaching you this year, but you don’t need to call me Professor or anything because I’m still a student, just like you. You can just call me Harry.”
“For Merlin’s sake,” groused Draco. Harry watched with satisfaction as he threw down his quill and spun in his chair. Draco’s face was flushed, and his eyes dark, but not, Harry noted, with anger. With something else.
“Don’t make me regret this,” she mumbled to him as they sat down at a table directly beside Draco and Luna. Draco shot him a concerned look as well, which he ignored, choosing instead to raise his eyebrows in Luna’s direction. Draco merely shrugged in response, but Harry could see him fiddling with his shirt on his left forearm again.
“Ew,” she said, making a face. “But Mary didn’t say anything mean. She just said she could cut my hair.”
Or maybe how badly he wanted a cigarette.
You know the rest, anyhow. I hadn’t expected to be spoken for at my trial. I had expected Azkaban. I cannot say with any certainty that at the point of my trial I believed that muggles weren’t inferior. I do not know when I stopped thinking that, but I am fairly certain that I was still set in my ways.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He was exhausted, now. “I’ll have to talk to Pansy about it.”
But then Draco was kissing him, gently, tenderly on the steps, and maybe, Harry thought, maybe it didn’t matter what they were Before. Maybe it only mattered that they were better now.
But those were the Days Before, and this was now. He had changed, in the Days After. He hoped that the others, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, would be able to change, too. Hoped that they all would do better.
“This involves you, too, you twat,” she said sharply. “I can’t do this with just Potter, he’s useless!”
“Better for all of us,” Smith responded snidely. “I’m shocked they even let you back in.” Before anyone could react, he spat, hitting Draco on the face.
“That’s easier said than done,” McGonagall responded, taking a sip of tea before she continued. With the tension gone from the room, Harry let himself slump back in his seat a little bit. “There is much anti-Death Eater sentiment, and for good reason.”
“Not over the summer,” Harry said with a sigh. He tried not to let his mind wander back to the summer, it would do no good for anybody.
Pansy had finally made the decision for them all, declaring they would walk Harry to the Great Hall so he could eat with his friends while they waited in the eighth year common room for the end of breakfast. And this was how he had ended up curled up on the sofa before the fire, feet in Blaise’s lap and head in Pansy’s, feeling as though he was going to be sick.
Despite what he said, Zacharias just smirked at him. “We’ll see what your friends will have to say about being replaced by a bunch of bloody Death Eaters when they get here, then.” He turned suddenly and the crowd dispersed along with him, presumably heading to their dormitories as though nothing had ever happened.
“Well you were the ones who got to spend all your time shut up in the Slytherin common room while other kids were tortured. We’ve heard the stories, you know – we’re not daft.” Draco saw Weasley’s blue eyes flash with anger and looked at him, almost incredulously, though he tried to hide it. He could almost feel the anger pouring from Pansy across from him.
Draco snorted inelegantly. “No one can ever get any work done when Pansy Parkinson is around.” But he stood up from the chair and jumped onto the bed, straddling Harry at his hips. “Is this what you want?” he leaned forward, his breath in Harry’s ear, nose brushing his cheek.
, did you?” she shrieked.
The two Gryffindors scrambled towards the door. In other circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the display, so cowardly for people who were considered so brave, but he just sagged down in relief as they left. Blaise moved, coming to sit beside him on Harry’s bed.
“Draco…” Blaise breathed, but he ignored the other boy.
“It’s a little bit drafty,” Draco continued. “But we’ll teach you some warming charms. There’s always a fire on in the fireplace, too, and the older students will conjure you flames that you can carry around if you ask.”
“Abuse of your power so that we can study?” Pansy asked as Harry made his way back to the table. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
She gave him a levelled look. “That would be a highly unpopular stance, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes it’s best to let these things run their course. The public will realize it’s a bad idea, over time.”
“She’s not that bad,” he said, when Pansy turned her look of fury on him. “She might fold your socks, though. She likes things alarmingly clean.”
Draco Malfoy was not having a good day. He had woken late that morning, of course – so late that Blaise and Pansy had almost knocked down the door only to discover him and Harry, curled up in bed, completely naked. They woke to Pansy shrieking, dramatically as always. His friends needed to learn how to knock.
“Andromeda-” he began, intending to point out how Andromeda had successfully rescued herself, ended up on the right side, hadn’t hurt a single soul to do it.
I'M SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG TO UPLOAD!!!!
By the time he came back out, Andromeda was in the sitting room with a tea for each of them. Harry set Teddy down on his mat on the floor and Andromeda charmed some bubbles to float above him and keep him occupied. Harry settled himself in the couch and accepted the tea that Andromeda sent floating over with another wave of her wand.
He was broken out of his introspective mood by Parkinson storming over.
“They made my life miserable,” she said. “Malfoy called me slurs, Pansy reminded me I was ugly every chance she got.” In a fluid motion, she pulled up her left sleeve, revealing the word that Bellatrix Lestrange had carved into her skin less than a year ago. Mudblood. “They hurt people. They killed innocent people. And then we come back from Australia and you’re friends with them? No warning? No hi, Hermione, how was your traumatic experience putting your parent’s memories back into their heads? Just ‘Hi, Hermione, come meet my new boyfriend, Draco bloody Malloy.’”
“Obviously,” Draco responded, but he rolled his eyes, which Harry was grateful for. He was significantly too tired to figure out how to react to sarcasm right now.
Harry let Draco push him down on the bed, straddle him, nuzzle the crook of his neck gently. He let the feeling warm him, force his mind back into my body.
“It’s alright, you daft idiot,” Pansy said from his side. Her voice sounded far away – it was the feeling that was becoming familiar to Harry, since coming back to Hogwarts. As if everyone was on the other side of a long tunnel, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t quite get back.
“Hermione-” he tried.
“Still,” Smith blustered. Harry felt Zabini, Pansy, and Draco shift around him. At first he thought they were trying to extract themselves from the situation, but he realized they had closed ranks behind him to mirror the stance of the other four – had closed ranks to protect him. “You don’t have to
“Harry, come on,” Neville said imploringly. “You weren’t here last year, with the Carrows. And I don’t blame you,” he added, putting his hands up in a placating gesture, “but others don’t all see it that way. They feel that you, Ron, and Hermione – and even Dean, to some extent – spent the year out of the thick of things and left them to suffer here on their own. You had your stuff to do, we wouldn’t have won the war without you, Harry. But being here brings up horrid memories, so not everyone is able to see it that way. If you’d just talk to them, spend some more time with us, they wouldn’t be so focused on being out to get you. They’d listen to you, if you explained.”
He leaned out over the edge of the Astronomy Tower, cigarette resting between his lips, and gazed out at the shadowy outline of the Hogwarts grounds. They were all here, of course, to celebrate and to mourn. Everyone had been offered a bed to stay in for the night. Naturally, most Gryffindors Harry’s age were currently seated in the Common Room, getting pissed on Ogden’s firewhisky and cheap muggle rum.
from.” Her mouth had twisted in a line, but she looked distraught. And honestly, for someone who was supposedly the brightest witch of their age, she was being gratingly obtuse right now.
“There are solutions,” Pansy said. She paused a moment, twirling her hair as she thought. There were prominent bags under her eyes – Harry knew from Blaise that she’d been having especially bad nightmares. But of course, there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. They had taken to shifting their sleeping arrangements – Harry with Draco and Pansy in Harry’s bed instead. It wasn’t as though Hermione was horrible to Pansy, but she felt safer with Blaise. And Harry couldn’t complain – he was, of course, more than happy to stay with Draco.
She waved away his question. When he protested, she added, “I can handle the washing up for one night, Harry. You can keep an eye on Teddy tonight in case he wakes. Merlin knows I could do with a full night of sleep before you’re gone and he’s all my problem.”
“No,” Draco responded, sitting up slightly. “You would have been happy, I hope.” Draco’s hands trailed down, found the hem of Harry’s shirt, lifted it slowly, Harry’s sighs turning to gasps as Draco kissed his way up his chest.
“Alright,” Hermione responded primly. Harry grabbed a jumper off his bed-post before gently closing the door behind him and following his sort-of friends into the corridor.
“Er- that’s great, Mar. Is Pansy doing it?”
She waved away his question. When he protested, she added, “I can handle the washing up for one night, Harry. You can keep an eye on Teddy tonight in case he wakes. Merlin knows I could do with a full night of sleep before you’re gone and he’s all my problem.”
Really, this whole conversation was much above Harry’s non-existent paygrade. “Sometimes,” Harry settled on saying. “But it doesn’t bother us, because we know the things they say aren’t true.” He glanced back quickly at Ron and Hermione. Ron was looking tactfully down at his crossed legs. Hermione simply raised an eyebrow at him.
“With all due respect,” she said, sounding as if she held not an ounce of respect for the man. It made Harry grin in spite of himself. “His magical core is dangerously depleted. It seems even using magic may be a danger to him. Surely you realized this.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at her, but was cut off by Professor Stone before he could say anything.
“I’m not spending anything near the amount of time on my hair that Draco does in the mornings,” Harry said. “That’s too much work.”
“But Dumbledore what? Dumbledore, who grew up standing for the exact same ideals as Voldemort? Dumbledore, who probably would have kept siding with Grindlewald if he hadn’t killed his sister?”
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, except a few choice words that he was sure the Healer would not welcome. However, before he could form a response, Madame Pomfrey spoke up.
But Harry didn’t get to hear what it sounded like, because at that moment a knock on the door sounded, followed by hushed voices from the other side. Everyone looked at each other for a moment before three sets of eyes landed on Harry.
“I felt left behind,” he said, finally. “When you and Ron went to Australia. I know I could have come-” he added, when she opened her mouth indignantly, “but I couldn’t have, really. Andy needed help with Teddy and I needed…to feel stable, I guess. I didn’t realize it was so hard for you. You always seemed to be having such a good time.”
He half stood up to reach out to her, but she was already at the door. She gave one look back, not at him, but at Potter. “I can’t, I’m sorry.” And then she was gone.
Harry almost smirked. Draco looked significantly uncomfortable, and also startled to be addressed so directly even though they’d been talking all evening already.
Maybe it was his hero complex – Andromeda had certainly encouraged him to get out of the house; to visit the Weasleys, go flying with Charlie, visit the joke shop, floo Ron and Hermione who were still in Australia. Most of this he did. Most of it, actually, he did with a smiling baby attached to his hip.
“I don’t disagree,” Minerva said. “And I admire your tenacity. But you cannot simply force your way through politics by trying to force people to agree with your opinion,
in one column.
“So are you,” Harry responded, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. In the Days Before, he would never have imagined this conversation would ever happen. But right now, if he were being honest with himself, he felt closer to Pansy than he did Ron and Hermione. “Are you okay?”
“Perhaps,” Draco said, thoughtfully. “It didn’t end horribly last time, really.”
“Get out,” Blaise parroted, his tone equally as deadly.
Harry sighed. He was leaving for Hogwarts the next day, flooing in. Draco would be staying with Andromeda and flooing in with them. It wasn’t September 1
“Grindlewald,” the boy said in a near whisper.
Zacharias Smith, Harry was pleased to notice, looked slightly nauseous at the sight.
Still, the period passed quickly. History of Magic, after it, was horrifyingly slow – although Harry was almost used to Binns’ drone at this point, and even managed to take some notes. Hermione was sitting across the room, but he could feel her glancing over often, as if shocked that he was actually paying attention. Especially compared to Ron, he figured, who was napping beside her.
“I wonder why that is,” she responded delicately. She was definitely making fun of him, in her own weird way. He fought the urge to blush.
“That’s awfully poetic, Potter,” Pansy said in response. She sniffed and looked away, as if in indifference, but Harry was fairly sure he could see a tear escape one of her eyes.
“How do you mean?” Harry stepped away to pick Teddy up as he began to fuss. As usual, the familiar weight of Teddy on his hip was a comfort - a small piece of stability in a shifting world.
Draco kissed him gently; the side of his mouth, under his jaw, then sat back, running his fingers through Harry’s wayward hair. “Don’t be sorry,” Draco said. “It’s not your fault.”
“I like your hair like this,” was all he could say. Draco just smirked.
in the next column. Randy was quiet, Harry was fairly certain he was a half-blood or pure-blood, although he had asked none of his students about their blood status. It was clear he had never been to school before Hogwarts – he often seemed overwhelmed by the number of people in his class and the noise around the castle.
The images in the dream came back to him, unbidden. As if they would want him there, it was
“That’s not a bad idea,” Harry said after a moment of thought.
“It’s part of his parole,” Harry said dully. “And it’s important to have a committed pure-blood on the team. He knows more than anyone what information he’s missing to integrate into muggle culture.”
“But Dumbledore-” she began, but Harry cut her off surprising even himself with the sound of his laugh.
“Yeah,” he said, dully. Harry didn’t particularly want to think about leaving, even if it would become reality tomorrow.
Ron and Hermione’s eyes were on him again, Harry could feel it. This time, they didn’t look away when he looked up. Hermione gave him a small smile, even from the distance across the table he could see her eyes glistening. Ron nodded, his arm firmly around Hermione’s shoulders, and even Neville gave him a funny look. Harry was hit with a feeling of
Did you know there were Slytherins who fought in the battle? Of course you didn’t – but it should be obvious. Children fought against their own parents. And all I could do was hide like a coward.
Harry looked back evenly before shrugging. “Then we build it again, but better.”
Harry couldn’t help but give her a rueful grin at that. “Yeah,” was all he said.
“I didn’t know what that spell did, you know,” he said quietly. Not quite an apology.
“Don’t tell me it’s different because you’ve sucked his dick,” she said between cackles. Draco buried his face in his hands. “I don’t think that will work with Granger, I’m not sure she has one, but you could always try with Weasley.”
“Tomorrow morning, under a few conditions,” Madame Pomfrey said, giving him a pointed look. “The Headmistress will be here in a moment to discuss.”
“I hate that worse,” Maribel responded primly. Harry couldn’t help a smile this time, at least.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He leaned back on the pillows and closed his eyes for a moment. “How has wizarding society existed for so long without solutions for problems like this?”
“Harry!” It was Mar, of course, entirely unable to understand the tension of the situation she was approaching, as usual. “Guess what?”
“Hitler!” she said, beaming when Harry nodded at her.
“Better,” Harry said honestly. “I feel better.”
those two could somehow speak Latin. There was a great creaking and the crest split down the middle. It continued splitting to the floor as the wall moved horizontally out until a comfortably wide doorway was formed.
“Drink this,” said another voice somewhere past the foot of his bed. Madame Pomfrey bustled into view, potion vial in hand.
“Oh, I’m Potter now, am I?” Harry smirked, but Draco had stubbornly turned back to his essay and wasn’t looking.
“Oh,” she said slowly. “Do people say mean things to you and Draco because you’re both boys?”
“Knock on your solid stone door? Or is it better to slap your dog portrait until he barks?” Pansy snapped, but she still came around and sat on the foot of the bed. Blaise deposited himself on Draco’s chair.
Both Weasley and Granger had gone quiet, Draco noted with some satisfaction. “That’s right – they don’t know. And they don’t care, either.”
Harry woke in time to rush out for his pre-breakfast meeting with McGonagall, leaving Draco fast asleep behind him. He was starving, not to mention still groggy from the extra sleep and anxious about all the school work he had to complete. Perhaps he’d go for a quick run before breakfast, or a fly – but that seemed a waste of time when he could also just get some food from the kitchens and work on his charms essay or lesson plans instead.
their own. So no Gryffindor eighth years for Gryffindor houses, no Ravenclaws for Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs for Hufflepuffs or Slytherin’s for Slytherins. What if someone like Zacharias Smith gets put with Slytherin?” Harry felt Draco tense beside him, saw Blaise’s eyes flicker and the dark look he cast at Pansy.
was untouchable and aloof, but it made me crave his acceptance and love more. My most cherished memories are when he would pay me attention; he would sit me on the desk in his study and speak with me as if I were a man, not a young boy. He would tell me about my legacy as a wizard, as a Malfoy. Explain to me the importance of pure blood. Why shouldn’t I have believed him?
He glanced behind him quickly, tugging on his hair that was long enough now to graze his ears, although still wild as ever. He locked eyes with Draco, who gave him a nod and a small smile.
“Isn’t Harry a Gryffindor idiot?” Michael asked.
“Nope!” Mar said, emphasizing the word with a popping noise on the P. Ron wrinkled his nose, Harry saw out of the corner of his eye, which made him bristle with protectiveness.
“How are you feeling?” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear. He didn’t have to specify, he knew what Draco meant. He could tell his nerves for the upcoming day were coming off him in waves. He was anxious – anxious about classes, trying to learn again as if everything were normal, helping Binns, tea with McGonagall that afternoon – just anxious.
of September with everyone else since they were still in Australia.
Saint Mungos was much the same as it had been the last time Harry visited it - after Mr Weasley had been attacked by Nagini. It was less frightening now, however, walking through the halls with Madame Pomfrey at his side into the outpatient area of the Spell Damage ward. At least, there was no one with teapots on their noses or legs cursed to dance forever.
“Malfoy?” Hermione asked calmly, almost too calmly.
I am sure degradation was the point, with Bellatrix. That and the pain she must have caused you – the lasting scar. Have you ever thought about covering it up with a tattoo? I have, but I won’t. My mark is part of me, part of my past. I cannot erase it and I would not want to. Rather, I can only hope it will remind me to be better.
“I felt left behind,” he said, finally. “When you and Ron went to Australia. I know I could have come-” he added, when she opened her mouth indignantly, “but I couldn’t have, really. Andy needed help with Teddy and I needed…to feel stable, I guess. I didn’t realize it was so hard for you. You always seemed to be having such a good time.”
old lady nightgown.”
desperately hate it.
Blaise put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezed. “I know we’re here, on your bed, in the eighth year dorm at Hogwarts. I know Pansy isn’t far away, probably arguing with Granger instead of sleeping.” He gave Harry a strained smile. “I know Draco is in his little room, probably fast asleep like the peaceful twat he is.” This wasn’t true, they both knew, but was comforting somehow. “I know McGonagall is in the her room, definitely in some sort of
He was broken from his reverie by a sharp elbow to his ribs, and he looked around wildly, breath coming in gasps. Draco on his other side was engrossed in a whispered conversation with Pansy and didn’t seem to notice his near-breakdown.
Harry realized he hadn’t thought of this – whether or not the eighth years would contribute to the ranks of prefects or not. It wouldn’t have affected him, but Draco and Pansy had both been prefects.
“Stop being melodramatic,” Pansy chastised him. She was running her fingers through his hair, which he typically found quite relaxing, but today it made his insides squirm. “They’re Gryffindors, they’re the most
and yet – he couldn’t help but wish.
Harry could see, now, the leader Neville had become in the past year – the leader he had needed to become. Harry had thought his heart had been broken before now; broken to never be mended, that he could not possibly feel it break any more than it had, but it did. It broke a little more for Neville and the DA and all the children that had been left to their own devices at Hogwarts under the rule of Alecto and Amycus Carrow.
this chapter contains a TRIGGER WARNING for brief, undetailed mentions of torture. if anyone needs me to mark it off in the text in some way so they feel safe reading please let me know and i'll see what i can do to mark it off.
“No,” Draco huffed back, much too quickly to not sound defensive to Harry’s ears.
Harry took a drag, willing his thoughts to calm. He couldn’t think, couldn’t move like this – and all the help his brain could supply him was one word –
“My punishment, if you could call it that,” he said. They sank down against the wall in unison, sitting next to each other on the stone under the stars. “I’m here until the end of eighth year. Can’t leave school grounds, can’t use magic outside of classes, can’t drink, can’t share rooms with other students. You get the idea, I’m sure.” He cast Harry a piercing gaze. “Why aren’t you back inside with all the others?”
“Not everyone can afford a tutor,” Pansy said, looking at him levelly. “And some parents don’t have the time to teach from home themselves.”
Harry placed Teddy in his chair at the table. “It smells good, Andy,” he said.
He felt Harry nudge him, and looked over to see him smiling slightly expectantly at Draco. “Oh yes,” Draco continued, drawling now. “And tea with Potter, how could I forget? Sometimes even tea with Potter
the kids, even. You can’t let it happen.”
He winced, knowing it was coming before he even closed his mouth. He had debated leaving Draco out of it, not saying anything, but better they find out from him now than find out he was lying to them later.
, even now.
But there was no place for the Slytherins to take refuge. It was hurt or be hurt, and knowing them now he knew that they would choose to hurt – most people would, really. He knew, too, that there were students from every house that had participated. To place the blame on the Slytherins alone felt…irresponsible, almost. Especially for a war that was so brutal because of a madman’s ability to pit children against children.
The fact was, Harry had found dozens of excuses to visit in the weeks following that night. Sorting library books for Madame Pince, calming Myrle while her bathroom was being repaired, permanently sealing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. And of course, if he happened to bump into Draco Malfoy, who would complain, really? He couldn’t, however, find any good reasons to stay the night. In fact, it was expressley not allowed. The other problem was that he had time to visit the castle much less than hel iked, simply because Teddy was here and needed him.
“Lots of reasons,” Draco said. “At least I’d imagine. There’s the risk of exposing muggle children to magic, for one thing.”
Confused, at least a little, Harry raised an eyebrow. “I already said it’s part of his parole. The Headmistress is confident in him, the plans were put together long before we came back to Hogwarts. I don’t see how I have anything to do with it.”
Pansy snorted from the other side of the room. “So you just stared at it for an hour?” she asked in amusement. Harry just made a face at her – mostly because she wasn’t wrong.
She waited a breath. Harry could feel the air in the Great Hall tremble, on the precipice of great relief and sadness. It was a physical feeling, the air around him was literally vibrating, as if straining to hold back the emotion. Was this a product of death, being able to feel the emotions so keenly?
I owe the both of you (and many others) more apologies than I could ever think I’d owe anyone. I will not be offended if you don’t read this letter, if you’d rather throw it away and continue hating me. But I hope you will give me a chance.
“I don’t disagree with you,” she said after a moment. “I’ve seen it in my lifetime. I am afraid, sometimes, that war is inevitable, thought I know it is not.” She looked up at him then. It was a careful look, adult-to-adult, rather than teacher-to-student. “I do not know that we can do anything about it. We are just two people.”
She sighed. “I didn’t particularly want to bring you, but Blaise seems to be of the belief that Draco would murder us if anything happens to you. So I suppose we have to make sure you’re not dumb enough to do anything stupid, now.”
But I cannot say that was true for me. I was not afraid of muggles, particularly, unless you count the belief that they threatened wizarding society. Polluted blood, I was told, would diminish magic over centuries until we would be nothing but muggles ourselves. Except, when you’re a child it is hard to fathom the idea of centuries – the consequences seem immediate. Maybe that was the point.
Draco’s hands were in his hair, on his sides, scratching his back, grasping his hips, urging him on. They went on like this, Harry shifting his weight onto his left side, moving his right hand down to give Draco a gentle stroke. “Faster,” Draco groaned.
Harry found it within him to give the other boy an amused smile. “I feel like I have to disagree with that on principle,” he said, “but you probably aren’t incorrect.”
“Finally, Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is strictly off limits, and that all students should review the list of banned items posted in his office.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but was silently impressed. This was likely the longest he had slept without nightmares since, well – as long as he could remember, anyways.
Harry stood and stretched. Draco was due to arrive soon, and he had been trying to calm his nerves. Truthfully, nothing had happened since that night on the Astronomy Tower. Nothing but talking under the watchful eyes of professors, at any rate. They hadn’t spoken of that night, either. In the Days Before, Harry may have asked.
Harry sighed when every single head at the table turned toward him for advice. “I’ll handle it,” he said dully. They all seemed pleased by the answer. Wankers, the lot of them.
She paused again, a small smile on her face this time. It almost,
“He changed,” Hermione said, weakly.
“I’d like to try again,” Draco said, “With your friends.”
She stepped down from the podium as the bustle of hundreds of moving students filled the Hall. Harry sat up slowly, cradling Teddy to his chest. The boy had begun to stir and whimper quietly.
“Aw, Pans,” Blaise said, “Not everyone is as blasé about sex as you are.”
Blaise Zabini, on his other side, was looking at him. “Not the time, Potter,” was all he said when Harry made eye contact. Harry mumbled a quick thanks back, working to calm his racing heart.
, he couldn’t help but think. It was his fault.
McGonagall gave them all a terse smile. “I have your papers here. I realize you had an early breakfast,” she continued, ignoring their shocked looks, “so I think early papers are in order.” She passed a piece of parchment to each of them. “Potter, I will see you in an hour, and you right after, Mr Malfoy. Ms Parkinson, I’ve arranged a floo call with your Professor since he will not be arriving at Hogwarts until the first day of term. All the students who chose Defence will be meeting outside my office three hours from now, when I am done speaking with Mr Malfoy. If you’d like to go first, I recommend you arrive with him.”
“War takes a toll, Harry,” she said after a pause. “Killing takes a toll. Of course it does, or it would be impossible to create something like Horcruxes out of death. You are afraid of your magic.”
“The thing is,” Neville continued, “Things will stay this way unless you…well, show your house loyalties, if you know what I mean.”
Draco sat up as Potter approached the group of three, not bothering to hide his smile as he left his friends behind him. “I’m going to pretend I never heard that,” he said with an amused glance at Pansy. She shrugged unabashedly, and Draco felt a strange surge of warmth for them both.
If I hadn’t been so compelled to do this on paper I am certain I would not be dithering so much, although we would certainly be arguing more. Of course you know that Harry spoke at my trial and returned my wand. I did not see him again until the anniversary in July. I did not attend the proceedings, then – I am sure I would not have be welcome – but I heard he spoke.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “That didn’t have anything to do with-”
Harry was too tired to argue.
I’m sure you think of me as a monster. I think of myself as a monster, too, sometimes. I won’t be self-depreciating, but I will be honest. Perhaps by the end of the war I no longer wanted to be fighting. Not because I disagreed with all of their ideals, but because I wanted to
“Worried they’ll hate us?” he couldn’t see Draco’s expression in the dark, but could imagine the quirked, slightly unsure smile.
“That’s different-” Draco began, pausing in shock as Pansy burst out laughing.
“Must not be bad, being here this summer,” Harry said after some silence. “Better than,” he gestured broadly.
“Like hell it didn’t,” Ron snarled angrily. “I’m sure he’s loving the benefits of fucking the Saviour of the Wizarding World – the sooner he does his time the sooner he can fuck off back to his life of luxury and muggle killing, right?”
He was exceptionally grateful, then, to find tea and toast waiting for him in the spare classroom he and the Headmistress met in. She held a deep hatred for the portraits of the ex-headmasters and their constant need to give opinions, so they hardly ever met in her actual office. Harry wasn’t even certain if she ever used it.
