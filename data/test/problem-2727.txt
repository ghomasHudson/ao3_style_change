“Acquaintances at best,” Niall said after a moment’s contemplation. “Anyway, they asked me to teach them defense against the dark arts, and I told them no.”
Harry’s mind kept on Draco as he worked. Thoughts and scenarios of how their lives would be as mated Alpha and Omega. Would they live here, in Malfoy Manor, or find their own home? How soon would it be until Harry was pregnant with their children? How many children does Draco even want? Harry himself wants as many as he can properly take care of or at least five. Or maybe six as an even split, three boys and three girls. It was a longtime fantasy of Harry’s. Living peacefully surrounded by his children. He would be reading to them, chasing them, or teaching them how to play Quidditch. Maybe one of their younger ones would be tugging at Draco to get him to do something demeaning like giving a piggyback ride or, god help him, change a diaper! The thought of Draco Malfoy changing a baby’s diaper was so ludicrous that Harry laughed out loud.
“Good,” Draco said, a smirk playing his lips. “How about we go and practice, a bit of pre-heat fun?”
oh dear....
“Who hasn’t? He’s a cheap Omega.”
“It’s just something inside me, I don’t know if it’s the Omega in me but, it seems natural in a way,” Harry frowned. “I want a normal relationship, believe me, but I don’t think that is possible now. I’ll try to keep it as normal as I can but, because of our new instincts…” Harry let out a low sigh, “I need to talk to Dumbledore about this.”
“I will Uncle Sirius,” Harry said. “If you don’t mind, I’m almost done as well and I just want to finish it before dinner so I’ll be in my room.”
Harry thought, as they turned towards each other, so that the crowd can see them too instead of their backs fully. They decided earlier on during their practice rehearsals, and planning that Blaise would go first, followed by Draco and Harry last.
“Gentlemen! A pleasure to meet you,” the man said cheerfully, his gruff accent completely gone. “Let me introduce myself, good sir, my name is Mr. Garrison, and I am here on behalf of a very concern friend of your… pregnancy problems.” He removed his hat to reveal a very handsome face. “Now, perhaps we can move somewhere more private to talk? This is not for children to hear, be they male or female.”
“And you will die,” Harry said, “once all of your Horcruxes are gone your soul will have nowhere to run. You will fizzle out of existence.” He turned and pocketed the vial before pouring himself tea. He glanced behind him and saw that the Dark Lord was not moving, a cold, amused smile gracing his face.
“No, no, I cannot kill you—you are my Horcrux, you are too important to kill as keeper of my soul… and my apprentice,” Voldemort said. “You do not want to get rid of your mother, but you are not, her magic will stay, her memory and actions will always remain. But your relatives, those muggles whom Dumbledore force you to return to summer after summer, who mistreat you without fail. You can replace them, cut ties from them, so that you will never visit them, never forced to be with them again. Think of it Harry, a life without the Dursleys.” Harry couldn’t help but smile at the thought of never having to see his Aunt and Uncle again, of never having to suffer Dudley and his friends ever again.
“If I did, I pushed those feelings down,” Voldemort said. “Those feelings were useless to me. They’re still useless to me. Love and affection, they only stood in the way of my goals.”
“So nobody of our concern,” Mr. Krum said. “I have you know, I am important in Bulgarian Ministry of Magic, Mr. Fud, and Harry here is going to marry my son Viktor!” (“We’re just friends,” Harry protested lightly.) “And both he and Niall are proud Durmstrang students—top of all their classes. You have no say to where the boys go to school.”
His gaze lingered on a round-faced Gryffindor who gulped.
“The Dark Mark is a curse, a powerful curse,” Dumbledore said. “It is tied directly to its maker. With the defeat of Voldemort, it will fade, however, a scar will always remain.” Harry gave him a hopeless look. “However… until then, there is a simple glamour I can teach you, Harry, and allow your arms to once again freely wear short shirts.” He gave a small smile and took out his wand. He tapped Harry’s arm and it glimmered for a second, shimmering like a reflection in a pond as the Dark Mark faded, leaving smooth, flawless skin in its place.
Ron chew quickly and swallowed, panting. “What was that?” he demanded. “You never acted like that before! I think.”
His robes for the meeting were black, a pure black that had no fading spots or hints of grey. As Harry tried it on, he was amazed, it was as though he was wearing shadows itself. Mrs. Malfoy trimmed and fitted the robes until it fitted perfectly. Harry kept the hood off and amused himself as he glanced back, the robe was a little longer, so he had a slight train, which billowed slightly at his command.
“Yeah, bye,” Harry said. He looked at Blaise when Ron was away, “Zabini?” he asked.
Relieved, Harry looked at Loki and mouthed ‘Get my Uncles’ before saying, “Go to bed Loki, we’re fine here.” The fox stared at Harry, his eyes shining intelligently. He stood up and walked away, disappearing in the darkness. “Creepy familiar,” Blaise grumbled. “You chose that?”
“Let us hear it,” Voldemort said, his voice sending a deathly chill throughout. “Girls, why shouldn’t Draco Malfoy wed my son?”
“Good question,” Uncle Remus said, he looked between the three of them, “Well, you all are marrying each other for this trick so… I would suggest that Blaise propose to both of you, or the three of you propose to each other. The only differences would be just determining who is waiting by the alter, and who is walking up to it.”
“Then how in the world does Mrs. Lestrange know it?” Draco demanded.
The couple decided to spend their first break together, Draco dragging Harry to the library so he had some motivation to work on his Ancient Runes assignment. Whispers and glances followed them everywhere they went, and Harry found that he cared about them less and less. They were just a normal couple going to the library to do homework—who cares if he’s ‘The Chosen One’ and Draco is a Slytherin! Or that they’re both boys!
“What happened?”
Harry nodded, swallowing down a sudden rush of guilt and dread. He turned to the man and did his best to breath normally. He was an older looking man, perhaps fifties, or late forties with salt and pepper hair. He was a bit overweight, as Harry saw, and not the best of shape as he was already wheezing.
News of the breakout broke quickly. The morning’s version of Daily Prophet had the faces of the Death Eaters freed facing back at him. There was a disturbed tension in the air of the Great Hall, and Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty as it continued. His stomach started to bubble, and he started to feel hot. A rage built inside him as Hermione showed the Daily Prophet to him, and the paper blamed Sirius Black. Then, a thought raced through his head.
“Mrs. Lestrange, I do not know what you’re talking about,” Harry said sweetly. “True I would like to get married later on, but right now this is all just for a project. If you don’t believe me, I’m more than happy to give you notes. Perhaps, you can give me a personal interview about your experiences? Specifically, about the night before, has His Unholiness blessed you with his visit?”
“I think he means you,” Blaise whispered to Draco.
“Harry, you don’t need to apologize again,” Uncle Sirius said, keeping his eyes on the demon. “Right now we just need to figure out what we are going to do with this demon.”
“Uncle Remus! Uncle Sirius! We’re home,” Harry called out as the two boyfriends walked into the home. “I brought Draco with me, I hope that’s okay.”
“Neville can’t have nuts, “Ron hummed. “Oh and Blaise really loves blueberries, they’re his favorite, along with strawberries.”
“Indeed,” Voldemort said. He looked from Harry to the seating chart. “It must be exhilarating, thinking of the plunge, knowing that once you’ve taken that step you can never go back. I’ve killed when I was your age Harry. I know what it feels like, the power, the control… the chaos. You want to kill all my followers Harry? I cannot help but wonder, how will you handle the circumstances?” He chuckled coldly as Harry just stared at the names. He took a deep breath, pushing down any fears he may still have, and looked at his father.
Mr. Malfoy smirked, “Hard of hearing, dog? I wouldn’t be surprised considering your… life choices. Now come along Draco.” He turned and began to walk away but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder. Without anyone noticing, Uncle Remus ran up to Mr. Malfoy and grabbed his shoulder. “What do you want, mutt?” he demanded.
“Don’t apologize,” Hermione said, “We have to actually go down into the prefect carriage,” she said a little awkwardly.
Viktor stared at Harry’s hand. He watched Harry and Draco for a moment and sighed, “This is it, isn’t it?” he asked.
They stood up. Harry’s hand was stinging painfully. When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
“However that is just impossible Professor,” Harry continued. “Life is full of dangerous creatures, people most of all. Sometimes, there is no time to consider whether or not using defensive magic is legal. Sometimes you just have to act… on instinct!” He whipped his arm, his wand slid smoothly into his hand, and in less than a second Harry shot a spell at Professor Umbridge.
“Burn them,” Voldemort said, his eyes searching the crowd. He smiled broadly when he noticed an old man with long silver hair and beard appear seemingly out of nowhere. He saw the horror in the man’s eyes behind half-moon spectacles. “Burn them,” he repeated, “and replace them with lilies.”
Mrs. Malfoy instead went to Draco. “Are you sure?” she asked.
“Of course,” Mrs. Malfoy nodded, and Harry left her.
“Sounds like a man who has a lot of stamina,” Blaise chuckled. Apparently he was louder than expected as Belby’s face turned rather red.
“I can scent something for you if you need it,” Harry offered.
Draco frowned. The mood around the table immediately soured as the blond started to turn into himself, Theo laughing at the forefront of his mind. He could smell him, see that cocky smirk of his as though the man was standing right in front of Draco.
“Help me overcome my father,” Blaise said. “Together we can bring back Magic, real Magic, along with the deities of old.”
“I am,” Draco nodded. “Harry and myself are male, one hundred percent. Greyback did not change that. Anyway, besides from the higher testosterone and changed body with traces of lycanthropy that is all I know for certain.” He started to look annoyed, “When I tested my semen a hypnotic smell rose, which I guess is for the benefit of attracting my omega—I mean Harry. That, along with something Greyback said, makes me thing that if we try, Harry and I can have a child.”
“Yes, Weasley,” Theo nodded. “How does that make you feel?”
Harry held tightly to Niall’s feet with his own. The pain was barely bearable, but he refused to show Umbridge the satisfaction of his pain. Time moved; the parchment shined with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain. Night came with a silent agony, and after how long Harry did not know, Umbridge said, “Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?”
He thought but he couldn’t bring himself to yank his drink away. He just held it steady as Harry drank. The taller raven-haired leaned back, licking his lips satisfied as he smirked at Draco, “Tastes great, but it could use a little hint of sugar,” he purred.
“Harry, you’re not well,” Ron said shakily. “Neville’s gone for help.”
“As much as I hate to say it,” Draco grumbled, “she is.”
Niall leaned towards Harry and whispered in Bulgarian,
“I know, Draco, I know,” Harry said. “Blaise… this all of this is just…”
Love Like You
“And what of Hell?” Mr. Riddle asked. “With your father gone, who will rule it?”
“He still shouldn’t be here,” Ron muttered. “That stupid slimy bastard bitch.”
“We need to talk with you, both of you,” Harry said, looking at Theo.
“It’s been a while since I’ve ordered you around boy,” Draco sighed, “so I decided to make some fun for myself this match.”
Back through the darkness into Grimmauld, Harry barely stepped out of the room he used when he was pulled into a body, arms wrapping around him. “Harry, I was worried.” It was Sirius. Harry collapsed into the hug, he felt like he was in deficit, and Sirius’s touch was what he needed now. He grasped onto Sirius, holding him as tightly as a child would hold onto their parent. “I was worried,” Sirius said again, “I was worried that you would take this too hard. Blame yourself.”
“What is it, sir?” Harry asked.
“Annoying? Is that how you say lovely and sexy, my pet?” he chuckled. Harry rushed towards him, ignoring Hermione’s protest as he reached and hugged Draco. Hermione hissed at Harry to be careful while Ron just stepped up to them. Draco saw him approach and growled in the back of his throat. Harry felt a submissive shiver and collapsed into him, nuzzling Harry’s chest.
Neville was lounging on the leather sofa watching television as Blaise played on his phone when the two walked in. “We come bearing food and cuties, I’m the cutie,” Harry announced.
“No, that would be counterproductive,” Voldemort said.
The twins stood up and followed her out of the room. They walked into the Great Hall and Harry stopped for a second. The Great Hall looked intimidating to the Omega. There were five tables, four parallel to each other with one at the end of the hall, all with people staring at Harry and Niall. In front of them was a three-legged stool, on top of which was an old hat.
Harry didn’t question it, but still a small part of him wanted to hear Dumbledore’s side and hoped that this was all a misunderstanding or some tragedy on both sides. Voldemort stood and stepped to Harry. He held Harry’s head gently, pressing his fingers against the sides of his skull. He breathed and closed his eyes as he concentrated. Harry felt something push inside him, melding with his brain. It prickled but wasn’t honestly painful. The sensation went away quickly, and Voldemort removed his fingers. “That should protect you my son,” Voldemort said. He looked around the room as if searching for something.
Harry did not feel afraid, strangely enough. He just looked at the Dark Lord, their eyes meeting. “What if they die from a cold,
It was two voices. One deep inside him, menacing and growling, the other, sounding from inside, and intensely familiar. “Harry… open your eyes, you should be awake now.”
“You would not dare!” Lucius roared.
“Sorry,” Harry said awkwardly, going back to his seat. The silence continued, but now it was awkward as everyone just stared at each other, too ashamed to start talking. Harry did not care about them. He only cared about the people around him, and though he tried to return to the original sadness he felt, his anger wouldn’t leave him. It stayed inside him, boiling quietly as he did his best to frown and look as though he was full of melancholy. They did not know how long they sat there, until the portrait hole opened once more, and Professor Umbridge, dressed in all cheery bright pink, walked in. She had her same smile as she looked around the room. “Hem, hem,” she said. She sounded too happy, too cheerful, for anyone’s liking, even those who gossiped glared at her. “Would the family members of Fred Weasley please come with me?” Professor Umbridge said sweetly. George, Ginny, and Ron stood up, along with Harry and Hermione. The group walked towards Professor Umbridge; whose smile stopped when she saw Harry. “I said the family of Fred Weasley, Potter. You are not family,” she said.
“Ten years,” Lilith sighed, “Let’s just hope he’s still not here to see it.” She cleaned the house, making sure everything was just as it was, before leaving once and for all. She was tired of this nonsensical game, and wanted no more of it.
“But a lovable idiot,” Harry grinned, surprising Draco as he winked at Hermione and kissed her cheek before falling, rather gracefully, into the chair that his shirt was on. She scoffed but grinned, shaking her head.
“I do not but you are not getting married!” Uncle Sirius yelled back, now standing as well. “There will be heaven to pay before I allow you to do such a stupid and idiotic thing! You are my child and—”
“They’re
Tragic Beginnings
Harry glared at her. She stared, looking victorious as Harry sat down. “I’m sorry,” he whispered to Ron.
“Ron!”
“No, to offer Hell to you,” Blaise said, “I will not rule it, not while I am here, on Earth with my loves. So, until we are ready, Hell is yours, Lilith, and with it the powers it gave my Father.”
“So how long until you’re okay with me and Draco?” he asked.
Left by himself, Harry got out of bed and stepped in front of a nearby mirror. He couldn’t see any difference. He looked the same as he always had. He looked like Harry, just Harry. The same raven hair, same emerald eyes, same spottily tanned skin… He could feel that he still had his knobby knees. The only noticeable difference was that he no longer had glasses, and his hips looked… a tiny bit bigger. Needing a closer look, Harry started to take off his clothes, and gasped.
“My nest,” Harry said sadly. “It all feels wrong, smells wrong.” He picked up a shirt and pressed it to his nose, inhaling deeply and frowning. “It doesn’t smell like me at all! Or you. It smells like Dudley’s old farts.”
“Yes, that would be good,” Mr. Riddle said. “Harry, Draco, I will see you both at the Academy. Good night.” Harry was still in shock as Uncle Remus escorted the Riddles out of their home. Uncle Sirius made a noise and drained his glass before moving to refilling it and draining it again twice. Harry felt Draco’s arms around him, and he was resting against his boyfriend.
With his look perfectly, and body fully clothed, Harry opened his door and left his room, going down the corridor, into the foyer, down the stairs, turned a left and walked into the kitchen where two men were already sitting at a table with three plates set up. “Morning Uncle Sirius, Uncle Remus,” Harry smiled, kissing their cheeks good-morning before sitting down in his table. Remus placed his paper down and sleepily slurred, “Mornin’ Harry.”
Harry stuck his nose up at the disgusting office as he made a beeline for Umbridge’s desk. They pulled out draws, seeing official stacks of ministry papers, doilies, old copies of the
“Can I get up now?” Harry asked, irritated.
The office was a circular room filled with silver trinkets and instruments that Harry had never seen before. Near the door was a perch, on which a brightly crimson phoenix sat, looking down at Harry curiously as he passed it by. Headmaster Dumbledore was sitting at his desk, waiting with his hands folded on it. It was empty except for a clear bowl filled with muggle candies. Dumbledore gave Harry a small smile as he stepped closer, “Harry, so glad to see you’ve come,” the old man said. “Please, sit, and would you like some candy? I’m particularly fond of sherbet lemons.”
“You,” Harry muttered. Niall moved to Sirius and the twins held on tightly as a second later, both Sirius and Remus apparated away. They landed on a cobblestone path with stores packed against one another and large crowds of witches and wizards moving together. Sirius and Remus checked the boys to make sure they’re whole and they went off down the street. “Never thought we would be at Diagon Alley to buy your Hogwarts school supply,” Sirius said, trying to smile. “Never thought we would see this place again period after getting you boys into Durmstrang. When was the last time we were here? Four years ago to get your wands and Hedwig?”
“They’ll be murdered in their sleep,” Mrs. Weasley said, staring at the sign. Harry and Draco however, snickered and shared a knowing look. They walked in and Harry was shocked at how crowded it was! He couldn’t get to the shelves which had boxes that piled high to the ceiling. The twins quickly found them and gave them a tour of the shop, not noticing or not caring that Draco was there, Harry could not say. The shop was too crowded to have a decent conversation, however by the end the twins shown him their real moneymaker, clothing that was enchanted with protective spells they learned from Harry.
“Please try not to get into trouble before we even get at Hogwarts, Weasley,” Draco drawled.
“I’m rubbish,” Ron said gloomily.
“Damn love,” Draco said slowly, “okay, I’ll help you out, my sweet submissive.”
“Without asking me?” Harry asked.
Cedric chuckled and looked at the two first years, “Thanks, you can go now,” he said. He turned to Ron when they were alone, “What do you want to talk about?” he asked.
The twins’ eyes shined at this, growing wide as saucers as they looked up and down Cedric like a piece of meat. “You want to know?” Fred purred.
“I do not,” Dumbledore said, “however we may see in a moment. … For I wonder if any of you have also noticed this.”
Harry moved without thinking, running towards Cedric before the hooded stranger with the bundle in his arms could get him. His wand in a tight grip, Harry jumped towards Cedric, and a gravestone near them sprung into the air, taking the killing curse for them as they fell to the ground. His scar exploding with pain, Harry could barely see what was around him. He and Cedric fell behind a tombstone, however somehow the older boy became unconscious. He knew that the short man in the cloak was coming closer, and he had to do something before he reached Harry and Cedric. Gritting through the pain, Harry jumped up suddenly, and screamed out “
“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing—so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. ...Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher, who’s never done an honest day’s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So, you see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish,” Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
“I know that! But—but I want him to be,” Draco yelled back. “I want him to be mine and I keep fucking up! I don’t get it!”
“Dragon’s getting weak, scent this,” Harry ordered before relaxing against the dragon again. Niall nodded and rubbed the plushie around his neck before giving it back to Harry, who nodded approvingly.
“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,” she added in an urgent whisper.
“Fine,” he said forcefully. “Let’s go make you a drink.”
“I believe you, Potter,” Professor McGonagall said curtly. “Put on your dressing gown—we’re going to see the headmaster.”
“Why not? Don’t you like your Alpha’s love?” Draco chuckled.
His mind started to wonder, turning to Draco as memories of their time together. There was a lot of kissing and cuddling, Harry realized with a smile, but also just the two of them relaxing at the side of the lake in Malfoy Manor. He stared happily at Draco, who was watching the sorting intensely. Taking after his Alpha, the Omega turned to look at the sorting as well—only to see the Headmaster.
“Nope, I’m dead serious on that,” Ron said. Draco groaned and pressed his hands harder on his head.
Ron shrugged, once again saying it was no problem while Neville blushed, “N-No problem,” he muttered. “Uhm I just didn’t know that umm. … it’s still not, down, you know. Oh god, I sound like a perverted criminal!” He groaned.
“No, you know the rules, once we are bound, we must serve!”
Voldemort chuckled, “She would bite you if she heard that,” he said.
“Wouldn’t that be rude?” Harry asked shyly.
“Yeah,” Ron nodded.
“Yeah… Mr. Riddle,” Harry said apprehensively.
Greyback stumbled and fell to the ground. Draco stood in front of him, breathing heavily as he glared down at him. “What the hell have you done to me?” he demanded.
“But even still, there must have been someone he was interested in,” Harry insisted.
“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did—” Hermione began.
Chapter 19
“But what if they do something—Slytherin to you?” Ron asked.
“The loo,” Harry answered, and he went out after Malfoy.
“Draco—it’s important please… please, Sir,” he whispered. Draco smirked at that and stood up calmly.
“To force my child to fight against me, for one of us to kill the other,” Voldemort explained. “At least that is what I think is the reason. It would be the cruelest punishment for both of us. To be killed by my son, or to kill my son unknowingly, and you to your father. This prophecy business, Dumbledore pushing you to fight against me, is his punishment against me.”
“Yet I also kind of love Blaise, especially with all our nightly meditation,” Draco said. He looked down and smiled when he saw Harry nodding in agreement with him. “Do you… can it work, do you think?”
“A perfect weather for the Dark Initiation,” Lord Voldemort nodded. “The last one, for a while at least.”
“I do,” Remus nodded. “He is staying with a friend. However, I’m not sure if he’ll welcome me. We haven’t seen each other since Sirius died.”
“They were as expected,” Harry shrugged. He gave a smile and kissed Draco again, “I missed you,” he mewled.
“Do you, Harry Potter, swear to follow our Dark Master’s wishes without question and obey faithfully?”
“The bedroom is ready,” Voldemort suggested. “You can stay the night, maybe more.”
more than sure about my brother and his secrets just as he is as sure about mine!”
“Speak little of it Harry,” Voldemort said. “I still do not know what to do with that situation. For now, however, I am planning on giving Dumbledore a distraction as I continue my research into what he is looking for in the Ministry of Magic.”
“I haven’t been with anyone since Viktor,” Harry said. “That’s true. And I haven’t… had those feelings or urges since. Even my heat went away to just a dull ache that I could have ignored. But last night, after our little fight, I felt it again.” Harry’s cheeks were blushing red, he did not dare look at Mrs. Malfoy as he heard himself confessing. “For the first time since Viktor, I made my own slick... Draco made me do that and I don’t know what it means.”
“A weapon, however, from what I hear it is more than that,” Yaxley said. “He is looking for something specific in the Department of Mysteries; a prophecy that ties you and him together.”
“Unacceptable!”
“Fine, I’ll give you until tomorrow,” Harry shrugged, “now, if I can finish my letter?” The two looked at each other before sitting down on the beds, and Harry turned back to his letter. The room was silent, except for the scratching of Harry’s quill. Ron and Hermione looked as though they still had many questions and concerns, however they knew that it would be better to ask once Harry had calmed and finished his letter.
“I can work through them too,” Harry said.
“Oh? And what is that thing, my pet?” Draco asked, his hands roaming Harry’s chest, pushing his robes open and starting to unbutton Harry’s shirt. The Omega gasped as his skin was revealed, and Draco’s hot hands pressed against his skin, sliding to his Harry’s nipples which hardened instantly.
Then they just disappeared from the Wizarding Community, nobody knew where they went or what happened. All they knew and heard about was how Niall Sirius Potter, the Alpha son of James and Lily, defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and saved his sweet little brother. This followed by a few days later with Sirius Black being arrested and imprisoned without trial for the murder of Peter Pettigrew and betraying the Potters to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
“Honestly, my marking Harry, if that is why my father has chosen him, is a saving in disguise. For because of that my sweet Harry now has the opportunity to live his life the way he wants to, instead of becoming a mindless slut for my father’s amusement,” Blaise finished. “So really, all four of you should be thanking me for saving Harry’s future… a thanks that I will accept in the form of food since I am starving.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, immediately latching onto his Alpha. He leaned to Draco’s ear, “Apparently we have to talk about collars later, Alpha,” he whispered.
“Brash?” Harry said, “is that what you think of me Theo?”
Remus snarled and stepped in front of Dumbledore until they were chest to chest. He knocked Sirius’s hand from his when his mate tried to pull him back. “You will not take my boys away from me,” he said coldly. “They are
“Yeah,” Harry nodded and left quickly, pushing past the rest of the students, struggling against the pushing and shoving when he reached doorways out of the train, until he reached the compartment where he started in. Theo was the only one there, holding onto Hedwig’s cage. “Did you know that Parkinson tried to get in here?” he said as he placed the cage down and helped Harry get his luggage down.
“Does it matter?” Draco demanded. “Shouldn’t you two be going now?”
Lavender Brown and her date were not brought up for the rest of the day. However, whenever she saw Ron she smiled and waved which caused Ron to give a half-grimace smile at her. “Does she expect me to give her a necklace?” he asked as they left their final class. “I don’t even know how to make one!”
Cedric frowned, he shuffled off of George and sat next to him. “I don’t understand,” he said. “Harry didn’t mention anything like that.”
“Think you can show me?” Ron asked. “How you uhh got them?” Cedric looked at Ron for a long moment, testing to see if he was serious. Ron met his stare, and the Hufflepuff laughed. “I mean, I can show you what your brothers taught me, it’s all about confidence and dominance.”
Harry glanced at Draco for a moment before reaching for the book on the ground, his eyes never leaving Voldemort. The Dark Lord did not move as Harry got the book and opened it, flipping until he reached the page that Draco wrote on. He glanced down at it for a moment, calming his breath, before looking back up at his father. “Sixteen,” he said. “Sixteen people.”
“Draco!” Harry yelled angrily, “What the hell are you thinking?”
“No she won’t,” Harry said. “If you are insistent—I will go and stay at Grimmauld Place.”
“It is?” Ron asked. Harry nodded and both his friends frowned. “How did they get that?” Ron asked.
“Yes, is there a problem, Twilfitt?” Voldemort asked coldly, looking down on him.
“Yes, thanks, sir,” Harry said.
“Why did I fuck Harry? Because I love him, and Draco,” Blaise smirked. “You have your harem of mindless demons and humans who only think and care of worshiping you… and I have my lovers. I don’t think there needs to be anything else.”
Remus frowned and sighed. “I’ll bring him with me when I get the cup of water but that’s it. I mean it Harry when I say that you shouldn’t be around Alphas during your heat. You’ll understand when you’re older.”
“We’re sorry,” the twins chorused and returned to their food.
“What else?”
“Brimstone, the foyer reeks of brimstone Harry,” Blaise said. “Was he tall? Incredibly handsome with blue eyes?”
“The essence taunting a warlock? That’s unheard of,” Lord Voldemort said. “Are you weak?”
Mr. Riddle turned to Harry and looked between him and Blaise. “Harry… Blaise, may this kiss bind these two in everlasting marriage, in the honor of our Dark Lord.”
The killing spell shot towards the fleeing kidnappers, missing them both. Voldemort shot another killing spell, but the two disappeared, apparating away and a second later, the killing spell hit where they were.
“Is he?” Harry asked, cocking his head to the side gently. “I don’t know,” he muttered. “Anyway, Draco and I won’t be doing anything drastic. At least for now. All I want is to talk to Dumbledore about this and try to teach my Alpha—I mean Draco some manners.” He frowned, “Why did I say that?” he muttered.
“Well, it’s just as you’ve read Harry,” Theo said. “You give up your muggle self and, socially, you can marry Draco, even under the Submissive Clause. However,” he took a small break, as though to think it through logically, “I cannot see the connection with our war and the clauses.”
Harry nodded. He stood up and said, “I’ll try to get as much information as I can. I’m going to go tell Draco now. He’ll be both worried and angry if I go without telling him.”
“Yeah, brilliant,” Harry smiled.
“Pathetic,” Voldemort sighed, “you are so lost and confused Harry. But don’t worry, that is why I’m here… together we will get rid of your confusion, wipe away the muggleness that stains you, and you will see that everything will work out.” He reached our for Harry, his long fingers looking monstrous, his eyes hungry and smile fake. Harry’s mind snapped; a decision made before either could think about it. His emerald eyes sharpened, Voldemort’s ruby eyes widened in surprised as both wands became pointed at one another, but only one voice yelled out.
With haste, his eyes darted towards Satan. He was still there, never moving, always watching Harry, his eyes burrowing further into him. “Ahem… I thought that I would never find love, let alone a friend. Being the only orphan… and being me, I was bullied and grew separate from all, never wanting to venture into the world for fear of getting hurt. Draco, you’ve changed that. Your love and friendship showed me that there is a world outside, a beautiful world full of love and happiness, and world big enough for you and me… and Blaise came along and that world became bigger. I moved out of my comfort zone, always being who I am, and what I found was beautiful. A world full of friends, family, people who support me for who I am. There were enemies, yes, people who hated what I do, but both of you, Draco, Blaise, you’ve protected me. You gave me love to survive a destiny I thought that will drown me, to survive a life that will surely kill me. So, with my vows, I vow to love you and love life. I vow to honor and obey you both, to be your loyal husband and take care of you two when you are at your lowest points. Through sickness and health, life and death, I will love and honor you Draco, Blaise… now and forever. I love you.”
“Uh—sure,” Ron nodded dimly. Terry smiled, his cheeks blushing lightly. “Okay then Alpha, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Well, then what do you expect to do?” Niall whispered back.
“What? Throw away his muggleness? As if,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “He doesn’t have the courage.”
“I see,” Mr. Riddle nodded, his wife whispering in his ear. “Thank you… Harry, you are indeed changed, there is a womb beginning to form inside you.”
“Harry.”
The Minister scowled and picked up his gavel, “Fine. We fine Dolores Umbridge guilty of all charged crimes.” He slammed his gavel roughly, the sound echoing in the room.
“Um Professor, do you know what is going to happen?” Harry asked. “In regards with Dumbledore.”
“A walk?” Harry asked.
The men were sputtering and gasped for air when Blaise pulled the appendages from their mouths. Harry and Draco helped the two into chairs while Blaise went to the corpse of the demon.
“No.”
Currently, it was a night of the full moon, the perfect time for a secret rendezvous.
A strange heat started to grow inside him. Harry found himself swallowing hard as the heat grew.
“What? Are you insane Draco? We’re only sixteen—”
Harry nodded and the three returned to the book, each more determined to find a way out, yet all a little off kilter from what Mrs. Lestrange said. Harry was too busy with his nose in the diary, that he did not notice when Blaise stopped reading, and instead stared at both Harry and Draco with a thoughtful, worried expression.
“Not going to. Given orders,” Mr. Garrison said. “Make these two impotent and mostly dead. Simple as that.”
“Guess I’ll uh never get on the team, huh,” he said. “First in my family to not get on. Aside from, well you know but we don’t talk about him because of everything that happened.”
“Harry! HARRY!”
Harry asked. He moved slowly to lay down on the grass. It was somehow easier on his body to lay down than to sit. Nagini moved so that she was laying on Harry’s chest. The weight hurt a little, but he did not complain.
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.
Goyle jumped and shimmied down the bench, making room for Harry. The Gryffindor sat down without a comment and looked around, saying a quick “Hello” to Zabini and Theo, staying quiet to the others.
“Because I can control them as well,” Harry confessed. “Because of my link to Voldemort, I could see them, interact with them. Dumbledore knew about this but, we didn’t know he would do something like this... I didn’t know.” Something inside him shook. “This is all my fault,” he said. It was true. All true, he realized. If he and Draco didn’t make that poison, if he didn’t flaunt his power in front of the Dark Lord, didn’t kill his followers so openly with the poison, then Fred would still be here. A tremor shook through Harry and his tears started again.
“Yes?”
“You are confused,” Voldemort said simply.
Blaise was gone. Instead the Devil stood before him, just microseconds away from sealing a marriage with him, with a kiss Harry’s soul would be forever bound and intertwined with Satan. Panic flew through his body, and the boy screamed out the first spell he could think of just as the Dark Lord’s clawed hand grasped onto Harry’s wrist.
“No magic happening at all,” Fred shook his head. “Such a blighted existence.”
Blaise looked at his boys to the stump ahead of him. “Well,” he said, “I guess first thing is I should change into my regular form…” He shrugged off his clothes and Harry and Draco stepped back. There was a burst of flames surrounding Blaise and a moment later, his wings spread out in beautiful black and white feathers, his leather straps barely keeping his body modest while revealing everything else. The demon smirked at the two mages and folded his wings towards him. Gritting, he pulled several feathers from his wings until he had a handful of black and white feathers. He looked towards Harry and Draco and held out his free hand.
“Definitely hot,” Draco said.
“Daphne Greengrass,” Harry said, “She has a date today but won’t tell the others who.”
“Not yet actually…” Draco said, the high of the battle still driving him. “Harry and I wanted to ask you something important, before we were interrupted by that disgusting demon.”
“No, I didn’t,” Harry said, looking guilty. “My Lord, can I show you an act of faith for you to trust me?” Voldemort nodded. Harry looked around at the shadows, “Bring the cauldron,” he commanded. The shadows filled the room for a moment before recessing back to normal, a large old stone cauldron standing full of a clear poison in front of Harry and Voldemort. “This is all of it, the Strangler. The poison I used to kill your men.”
“The best,” Blaise smirked.
The two Potters gave a sad, depressed noise and nodded as they finally opened their letters. It was exactly as Harry expected, a letter of congratulations of being accepted to Hogwarts and their school list. It looked that all they needed was to get new robes and schoolbooks. The twins went over the school supply list. “At least,” Niall said, doing his best to sound hopeful, “we have most of these books already, I think.”
“What did he tell you about my father’s mark?” Blaise asked.
Ron smashed his face against Theo’s, their lips colliding sloppily. When Ron moved away, Theo shook his head, “I like that I’ll have to teach you how to kiss properly,” he added before moving a hand to under Ron’s chin, “Like this, Weasley,” he breathed and kissed Ron, his movements graceful as their lips slid across each other’s Theo’s tongue darting out to taste Ron’s lips. When they separated, Ron was grinning proudly.
He shook his head and stared down at the mark that he received on his Dark Initiation, which felt almost a lifetime ago. All too soon, time passed and Uncle Sirius knocked gently on his door before entering. “It’s time,” he said.
“The development of Magic?” Professor McGonagall repeated, frowning slightly. “Can you please further explain?”
The snake looked between Voldemort and Harry. She slithered towards Harry, coiling her long body around his leg as she spiraled up onto his lap. She hissed, her tongue tasting his bare skin.
Sirius had a strange look. He turned his head to his husband. “What do you mean?” he asked.
“You really want to call the Dark Lord’s son a cheap whore, Parkinson?” Daphne asked. “I don’t exactly think that is a good idea.”
“So, Harry,” Dumbledore said in a business-like tone, “you have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these—for lack of a better word—lessons?”
“Nothing is wrong Niall, it is just his heat, completely natural,” Remus said soothingly. “Harry, pup, your body is getting ready for some big changes, that’s all.”
Greyback gave a barking laugh as he carried Draco out of the room.
“OH! Daphne! That reminds me!” Ron grinned, looking like a rather excitable puppy as he hopped slightly. “Draco said he’ll sing for me!”
“Mrs. Lestrange… no, you are not,” Mr. Riddle said shortly. He turned to the class and said, “Class, this is Mrs. Bellatrix Lestrange, our newest member to the faculty. She told me this morning that she wished to give an announcement to the student body… however I did not think that this would include interrupting my class, Lestrange.”
More minutes passed, and Harry’s anger did not quell at all. He stood up, causing Hermione to jump. “I’m going to tell Draco and Theo,” he told her, “they should know.”
“Experiments?” Draco repeated, a hint of fear in his voice.
The first thing he noticed was his hair. It was longer and darker. No longer a platinum blonde, but more of a dirty blonde that reached past his chin. He was distraught. His perfect hair, his Malfoy hair, spoiled. Tainted. With cautious eyes, Draco forced himself to look down at the other grisly changes Greyback forced upon him. His perfect body, sleek and tight, was now totally different. Instead of looking as if he spent his days lounging, it now looked as though he lived for the gym. His pectoral muscles were beefy, pushing out slightly with a distinct line separating them. The pillowed chest led to perfect abs and, as he turned his eyes to his arms, he noticed distinctly large muscles. His legs were equally as large, and, as Draco stood up cautiously, his ass had ballooned slightly. However, there was one matter that Draco fixated at.
“Well there’s no way I’m not drinking this potion,” Harry said.
Harry wanted to laugh. Pansy’s eyes bulged comedically as she looked at Draco. However, the shock quickly turned to a hatred, a biased hatred that filled her to the very core. However, Harry could feel that that hatred was different from his, not powerful enough to fuel the Dark Arts yet still as destructive. “That’s disgusting,” she said. “I won’t believe it.”
“Good but you need your sleep, my dear… can I call you dear?” Draco asked. “Because you are dear to me.”
The room gotten awkwardly silent, the only sound being Harry’s breathing as he worked on getting that and his emotions under control. The three kept glancing looks at each other, Harry had a hand on his hip while the other hung, a look of irritation on him while Blaise and Draco both were crossed-armed, looking up at each other with more and more sheepish looks each time they’ve saw Harry’s irritated face.
The two just rested on. For the first year of their life, it could be said that it was their happiest. Niall and Harry were loved very much by their parents and godparents Sirius Black and his husband Remus. They had many toys and seemed to have their firsts together from their first crawl, the first time they opened their eyes, and even first steps and words. On their first birthday, Harry and Niall were spoiled with so many presents by their parents and godparents that they didn’t know what to do! It did not matter that they were in hiding, even though both boys had no consciousness or awareness to it, they were surrounded by toys! And their mummy and daddy, but mostly toys! The two were on their way to becoming beautiful babies as well.
Niall stuttered and looked around as more and more eyes fell upon them. “I’m sorry—you have to be mistaken, look we’re just here to visit our friend and—”
Mr. Malfoy glanced at Voldemort, who took a step forward. “I am a good friend of Lucius,” he said. “My name is Tom Marvolo Riddle.”
to Harry?”
Chapter 3
“I know where they are,” Niall said, crossing his arms. “The health teacher taught us.”
“Can agree with you there,” Ron grumbled.
“It’s okay Draco, we’re borrowing a lot of things for me to get my answers,” Harry said. He checked his list and took a breath, “It’ll take a bit of blood,” he said. “Maybe using both of ours will be easier.”
“Yeah!” Ron agreed.
“Of course my puppy,” Mr. Riddle nodded, “take your time. I will show you how trustful and devoted a husband I am. How loving of an Alpha I am.”
“I’ll think about it,” Draco said, stretching. “But in the meantime, I don’t mind singing more for you. Do you have any requests?”
Draco smirked and wrapped his arms possessively around Harry. “A ceremony, huh?” he said thoughtfully. “We only have days left before we have to leave.”
“You don’t even know?”
“The Alpha Protein, it’s continuing, but it’s tied to my seat it seems,” Harry said. “My food isn’t spiked here.”
Harry gave them a long stare. “I have not told you because I’m still in the closet, as for him… it’s Draco.”
“Ron, Hermione, go and make sure everyone gets to their dormitories safely,” Harry said. “We’ll be alright.” His friends nodded and ran. Harry and Draco turn to follow Umbridge. They followed her up to Dumbledore’s office, where the Minister of Magic was waiting with a group of Aurors.
“I will, Sir,” Harry said. Draco laughed and backed away, turning to Harry right before he reached the door. “Teach them, but make sure that I can still beat them all in a duel, especially Longbottom.”
“I wonder why,” Harry muttered. “You thought I was girl for the first couple years I’ve lived with my uncles!”
Standing up to stretch, Harry’s thoughts turned again to Draco and their situation. He wanted the day to be over. The last two hours seemed to drag on. His boredom was soon replaced by anxiety and nervousness. Laying on his bed for the last hour, Harry jumped up more in shock than relief when there was a loud knock on his door, and Lord Voldemort entered. “Follow me, Harry,” he said, “it’s time.”
Harry found himself in a large room that looked like it belonged to a baby. Stuffed animals were laid around the floor, along with baby books. There was a large window which was closed, underneath there was a large supply of diapers and baby needs, but Harry’s eyes fell on the man before him. It was Lord Voldemort, looking less monstrous than he remembered. His skin was pale, and his eyes were red, but he still had his nose and hair, looking somewhat human. In his arms was a baby who cried loudly.
“Stay in the castle,” Draco argued. “I am not going to allow you to rush out there to your death!”
“That’ll be hard with Greengrass,” Draco said, “but I think I can sweet talk Blaise.” Harry smiled and hugged him.
“I—yeah okay you have that point,” Harry said. He made a show about picking out the heaviest bags, causing his biceps to bulge slightly as Draco just shook his head. “Anyway just admit that Kairi is a sweetheart who’s been done dirty, and you’ll be back to being a good boy,” he said.
When he returned to the Great Hall, instead of going back to the Gryffindor Table, he moved to Draco. “Harry, are you okay?” Draco asked, “I saw you walk out.”
“Blaise, stop it,” Uncle Remus said. Blaise ignored him.
“No Minister, that is not,” Mr. Riddle nodded. Harry took this as a cue he can return to his seat and did so without haste. Remus patted his back and gave Harry an encouraging smile. “We are here about Dumbledore and his crimes against my family. Starting with when he hired two people many years ago to kidnap Harrison.”
“Heavens no!” Remus gasped. “You will help out obviously but you’re just kids! Where is all of this coming from, what did they do to you?”
“Sure,” Theo smirked, “anyway… if you want someone to talk to about all this… I’m here, if you want, and if you don’t want me, then I know someone else.”
“We don’t have any say in what is going on,” Harry frowned.
Draco frowned, “What are we going to do?” he asked.
“I mean it’s only been a week or so,” Draco said. “But I think I actually like Professor Lupin’s class the most.”
“No,” Harry said flatly. “I am not going to make out with you just because Ron is doing it with Terry Boot.” He found a booth that was out of Ron and Terry’s sight and pulled his Alpha there. Draco went to get their drinks and Harry waited, not wanting to interrupt or make Ron’s date with Terry, which looked going pretty well considering the tongue war they were having. The blond returned with two bottles of butterbeer and after a couple of sips, Harry started to relax and the two went on as normal.
“No,” Harry said.
She still was using her regular office instead of the Headmaster’s office, and so when Draco knocked, the door immediately opened and Professor McGonagall was sitting behind her desk, apparently in the middle of grading papers. “Come in, boys,” she said. “Mr. Riddle, if you would please close the door behind you. Hogwarts, just as her students, have a tendency of listening in to conversations that do not involve them.”
“Dude!” Ron yelled.
“Harry,” Ron said softly.
“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FOUND OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON! FOUR WEEKS AND THANK GOD FOR MY BOYFRIEND BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SO MUCH USEFUL THAN EITHER OF YOU!”
“Yes Sir,” Harry said. Draco smirked, his grip on Harry’s shoulder tightened. The ring started to glow, and they transported away, Harry feeling oddly calm as he stayed kneeling in front of his Alpha.
“Gee, great,” Remus said a little bitterly. “Even my godson is keeping secrets from me.”
“What are you doing here?” the boy asked.
“Seamus—stop,” Dean said. “He only does Alphas anyway.”
Harry froze.
“To deny that is against now only our Church’s laws, but it would mean going against the Dark Lord himself,” Mr. Riddle said. He looked at his wife and said, “My wife will perform the tests to see if there is a womb inside you Harry.”
Harry slammed his fist on the table and glared at the girl who said that. She was a little shorter than him with black hair tied in short pigtails that looked more embarrassing than cute. He smelled the air and barely smelt any scent from the girl, only cheap perfume that she seemed to bathe in.
“Exactly!” Blaise grinned. “I’m so happy to have a mage who thinks in the morning… many should learn from you, sweet Harry.”
“That stupid fucking bitch,” Malfoy muttered under his breath. Niall didn’t know who he was talking about and hoped that it wasn’t about Harry.
“Yes,” Harry nodded. “I’m sorry, by the way, to say that you were jealous of Ron.”
With a puff of smoke, and a roar of thunder, a being appeared before them, sitting naked on the stone slab. Harry didn’t know where to begin in describing it. The being was both male and female, having an androgynous face with long black hair, black impish eyes, and a wide smirk. His… or her… boobs were moderate size, easily grabbable by those who were into women’s breasts, and their skinny body led to both a cock and vagina. Harry blushed and quickly looked away as did Draco. “Mortals! Gazed upon my brilliance—my magnificence—my—”
It was the day of Harry and Draco’s wedding. However, Harry’s mood was far from happy or giddily nervous. He woke up in absolute darkness, the shadow-creatures surrounding his bed. He was not surprised, or even angry. Instead he got out of his bed, put his glasses on, then walked. He arrived moments later into an empty bedroom where clothes were waiting laid out for him. It was a white wedding suit with a long back, almost robe-like. Harry frowned at it, it was something that he would never wear in his life. On the breast pocket was the Dark Mark sewn into it. Seeing it made Harry feel uneasy, both a mixture of pride and disgust. It was just another reminder that the day was not his, not truly. It was his father’s.
She shrugged, “Honestly anyone insane enough to go after Draco is not worth bothering,” she said, “especially if it means it’ll get Pansy shut up about it. But I didn’t know that you and Draco were a thing.”
“I loved you!” Harry yelled back. “I loved you Viktor so damn much! But—but—the ministry…” Both boys heaved as they stared at each other.
Professor McGonagall rushed in a moment later, Ginny following after. “My goodness,” Professor McGonagall muttered as Ginny rushed to Fred’s bed and grabbed his cold hand, begging for him to wake up. But he never did. The boys had to pull Ginny off of Fred’s body, and Professor McGonagall took over.
“Uh you should know that,” Harry said awkwardly, his mind going to Quidditch, “I’m the Seeker you guys keep losing to.”
Ruined Omega
“Yes, I do. Harry is my godson,” Remus said. “I got a reply from Molly, she thought it was just vitamins and is extremely worried about Harry, I can go talk with her.”
“Funny,” Draco smirked. “I was about to say the same to you. Besides, it’s not right to bully such a beautiful Omega.”
Sirius looked at the clock on the mantle and said, “By god it’s almost two!”
“Forgive him Sirius’s death!? Forgive him Lily and James’s? Harry this monster is the reason why you lived with those horrible muggles! Why you were forced to endure the Dursleys’ abuse!”
“So uh, if I get this right, you are You-Know-Who’s and this guy named Adrian’s son who was kidnapped when you were a month old. … Dumbledore had something to do with that as well as giving you to the Potters and placing this magic sucking spell on the Muggles’ house when you lived there. … And despite all of that you decided that the best thing to do is accept a Bonding Necklace from
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer an nearer Ron—
Chapter 3
“That’s not good—are you alright? Did you tell Dumbledore yet?” Hermione asked.
“No, out of the question,” Voldemort said. “I just had you back. I will not let that disgusting old man touch you again—”
“No, I played no hand in blocking all communication. That was the Minister’s idea and the Minister alone. Why even I did not think to do such a horrible thing,” Dumbledore explained.
“Which was?”
Nagini hissed sadly. Harry started to pet her unconsciously. It was weird, this instant connection the two of them seemed to had, but Harry wasn’t complaining or even questioning it. He needed someone to vent to, someone to confide in. And if that person was a snake, who was he to judge?
Snape was quiet for only a second too long before nodding, “I am, my Lord.”
Harry frowned, “I don’t feel different,” he said, “my body hurts… and my voice is sore but still I don’t feel different at all.”
Hermione said nothing, she just nodded and asked carefully, “Has Harry always been so… experimental with potions?”
“What do you mean?” Sirius asked.
Harry remembered her from Fourth Year, saving her sister during the Second Chance and competing against her during the Triwizard Tournament. Never did he expect, however, to see her waft into his room smelling of lilacs and lavender with a tray of food with Mrs. Weasley coming up behind her, “I told you that I am more than capable of bringing this to him,” she said.
“That was the last thing my father was researching. If it exists, it will have tremendous power,” Harry explained. “I want that power for myself. Now, if you would, I have a private visitor coming.”
“But why is he here and alone with you?” Draco demanded, glaring at Viktor. The older and bigger Alpha just held his hands up defensively as he smiled easily.
“Truly tragic, yes,” Slughorn nodded, “and so we turn to Draco Malfoy. Here is a name that needs no introduction!”
“Wicked,” he breathed out, “is this because you’re a werewolf?” he asked.
“I know,” Draco said, “But can I have some classes first? I still don’t feel fully situated.”
All throughout lunch, Draco and Harry kept glancing at Umbridge. She looked like she was rather comfortable in her chair, forcing Professor McGonagall to have a conversation with her, ignoring the tight, annoyed expression on the Transfiguration teacher’s face. Under the table, they kept holding hands as they ate. Draco started to pull away reluctantly, but Harry grabbed on tighter, the two sharing a nervous smile.
“When a person is bitten by a werewolf, their bodies stay the same, for the most part, but your body have went through changes akin to puberty,” Dumbledore said, “your eyesight, for one thing. Another, you did not shift while you were unconscious.”
“I did nothing!”
Voldemort nodded. “It is Harry, and I would not have know what I do now without your help. And so… I believe I’ll tell you more about my old apprentice.” The Dark Lord moved to a chair and sat down in it. Harry immediately moved to sit across of his Lord. “He was a Black, the same family as your godfather Sirius Black. However, he was before Sirius’ time. His name was Alphard Black. And yes, Harry, he was my first apprentice, as well as companion. He died to poisoning in Nineteen Seventy-seven. Growing up the boy was malleable, just as you are, and he has chosen me to be his Dominant just as you have chosen the Malfoy boy. I’ve used him, and he used me. But that is all that I will share with today. You have done well Harry, remember that. You are free for the rest of the day, consider it a birthday present from your master.”
“I wasn’t thinking!” Draco yelled. “I wasn’t thinking and wanted to make sure my omega was okay!”
“And it would be nice, Omega, if you remember your place,” Draco growled out.
“No, I’ll do the trials,” Harry said immediately. He was going to be with his twin. Professor Cornett frowned but nodded. Harry was able to quickly outwit the ghost (he had to get to the potions table without the ghost noticing him at all or his shadow) and when he reached the Potions table, he immediately smiled as he recognized several of the potions. He quickly picked out the potion that would make the drinker puke as well as its antidote before being asked to move onto the next challenge. Harry lingered, however, taking a couple of potions and smiling as he mixed them together. “Mr. Potter, what are you doing?” Professor Cornett asked.
“It’s from Viktor!” Harry said excitedly. He ripped the letter open and read it.
However, as they started to make their way back to the castle to prepare for the Third Task, Niall and Harry were surprised to see their godfathers at the castle’s entrance. Behind them, was Professor Dumbledore along with a man in a bowler hat whose face was very red and a couple of Aurors. “Harry! Niall!” Sirius said when he and Remus caught up to them. The men immediately brought their boys into a tight hug. “What are you two doing here? Are you hurt? Why aren’t you at school? What did Dumbledore say?” Sirius asked frantically.
This caught the boy’s attention. “What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“Why would I be? We’ll need friends if we’re going to survive here. Especially since we don’t have…” Niall’s voice died down and Harry shook his head. “Viktor,” Harry finished for Niall. “I’m—I don’t want to cry over him anymore.”
They watched Blaise eat in silent, both not knowing what to say, or if they should even talk. When Blaise was done, he placed his dishes in the sink and turned toward Harry and Uncle Sirius smiling. “Right,” he said, “show me this storage room where I’ll be sleeping. Oh, and don’t worry, I won’t be doing anything tonight so no need to turn me into fertilizer.”
Ch. 13
you?” Greengrass sneered as she took a step closer to Harry. “Are you a boy or a girl?”
Harry frowned.
“You will, Harry Malfoy,” Draco purred. Holding the book to his side, he took Harry’s hand and pulled him out of the shop. Harry felt the weight of the collar still against his skin, and blushed as they were in public. “You never told me,” he said, “why the collar?”
“Sorry… Granger is a muggleborn… you’ve read those books, they’re less than us.”
“Good idea pet,” Blaise nodded.
“In that case bring him here.”
“I know, I’m being silly,” Harry sighed. “I mean, I’m a warlock! A Potter! I’m supposed to be strong! But sometimes I wish… I wish that what happened didn’t happen… and that I wasn’t called ‘The Coward’s Son.’” He shook his head and patted the two, “Come on, finish up and I’ll ask Uncle Remus and Sirius if I can take you two with me to the woods. Would you like that boys?”
Harry went silent on that. He shook his head, “Just family stuff,” he muttered but still frowned. He looked up at the Gryffindor table to see that Niall was looking just as concerned. They nodded to each other, silently telling the other to wait for him when breakfast was done. He looked around and asked generally, “Has this stuff happened before with any of you? Your letters missing or not arriving?”
With both classes done, Draco found himself free for the rest of his first day at Hogwarts. He asked Harry if he was free too, but the raven-haired beauty shook his head, “I got one class after lunch,” he said.
Niall huffed and turned on his heels, muttering that he needed to find Harry. Ron and Hermione still followed him but thankfully remained quiet. The three found Harry by the staircase leading to the dungeon. Niall ran towards him immediately and held him close. “Are you okay? Are you hurt? Let me see your cheek,” he said quickly.
“You have nothing to fear about yourself,” Voldemort said. “You are perfect in every single way, from your body to who you are. I accept who you are. I accept your body, your love, your voice, your feelings, and thoughts, and most of all I accept your lycanthropy. You do not need to hide it from me, my puppy. I want you to accept who you are, and I want to help you work on that as your Alpha.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a necklace.
He was furious at the Omega when his mouth was finally free, and he stewed in it for the rest of the night as they returned to the Slytherin dungeons, but then something changed. Draco sat on his bed, satisfied that Harry’s was right next to his, and he watched Potter make his nest. It was messy with blankets and plushies were thrown together at a random order with no rhyme or reason, exactly the opposite of Theo’s, and it reeked. The nest reeked of Potter’s Alpha twin Niall, and Draco’s nose scrunched up at it. He wanted to grab the nearest plushie and rub it all over himself. Replace the offending twin’s scent with his own, but he knew that Potter would only move further away. Then, out of nowhere, Potter became shy. He looked hesitant and for the first time of that night looked like a proper Omega. His eyes wide and innocent as he held a small stuffed animal that was unscented.
Harry jumped awake when the door to the boys’ dormitory slammed open. He was blind and groggy when George’s voice screamed out full of anxiety and grief.
Harry and his boyfriends moved to sit across of Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus. The dogs and fox walked up to them and immediately sat on their laps, Loki (the familiar) sitting on Harry and staring up at Loki (the old god) with a queer look. The old god, however, snapped his fingers and a regal throne made of the finest materials appeared, hovering over the floor a couple inches as he reclined in it with a loud yawn. Harry’s uncles ignored the old god and focused on Harry, Draco, and Blaise.
Harry nodded and quickly took off his pants, revealing his own cock, smaller but still just as hard. Draco got off his seat and pulled Harry’s robes off and pushed his shirt up, revealing his smooth skin which tingled against the stone floor as Draco had him lay down.
“Your new girlfriend,” Draco said simply. “Honestly, it’s freaking Ron Weasley out.”
“Yeah,” Neville nodded.
He walked around the corridor three times, willing the room to appear in his mind. On his third trip, the simple door appeared, and Harry stepped through to see the Strangler still safe in its cauldron. He went to the table and took a small empty vial. He filled it and again pocketed it with the fangs before summoning the shadows. “Voldemort will want me to show loyalty,” he said as the room was engulfed by darkness. “When I call, bring me the cauldron.”
“O-Ohh okay,” Ron frowned. “But Draco—”
“As if!” Harry said, and Draco laughed as they fell into a light-hearted argument about which character was better. Neville came during that time with their food and drinks before leaving. They spent the rest of their time eating and talking about Kingdom Hearts before they had to leave for their next class, which Draco was shocked to see they shared.
Ron shrugged, “It’s true though, I’ve seen some of the homework Neville had to deal with and it looks horrible! I don’t get how he and Hermione can go after their majors, they’re like super difficult.”
, 1991, the first day of Hogwarts’ school year, and Niall Potter, their boy-who-lived, would start his education along with his younger brother! It has been almost ten years since the twins disappeared from Wizarding Society, and the community was all too excited to welcome back their savior and his brother to where they belong. There were more people than usual on platform nine and three quarters that day, everyone wanting to get a peek of the Potter twins if they could. Families stuck together, as students claimed compartments. Sometimes a child or two would get on the train to run down its length, looking in every compartment before coming out to shake their head, much to everyone’s disappointment. Eyes shifted from the train to the muggle entrance from Kings Cross, and then to the spot in the back reserved for Floo travel and Apparation. The excitement was palpable as everyone wondered about their unanswered questions. Where did the twins grow up? Who raised them? Why did they disappear? Did they even know? Was Niall being trained? Would they be Gryffindors like their parents—of course, they would be, it’s mad to think otherwise!
“Harry! Will you stop ignoring me,” Daphne said, “You’re being so rude!”
Time passed and the door jiggled one more time around twelve as an old lady pushing a trolley full of sweets passed. Harry brought some cauldron cakes for him and Niall and thanked her politely before closing and locking the compartment again. They ate in silence and continued doing what they were doing. Around dusk, they changed into their new robes and frowned at each other. “This feels wrong,” Harry groaned.
Harry’s fifteenth birthday started as any other day. He woke up early and, as with any day, worried himself as he glanced at the obedience potion still hidden in his sock drawer as he got dressed. Letters and the Daily Prophet waited for him, the letters already on the ground while the owl who brought Harry his newspaper waited patiently for the money. Harry paid, watched the owl fly away, and threw the paper to the side, going for the letters instead.
“I will do anything for you Harry,” the Alpha promised. “I hated seeing you in pain.”
he thought to himself,
“Right, well… I guess we have to talk about that, huh?” Uncle Sirius sighed. “Come on two you, time to set some rules.” He turned around and walked out of Harry’s room, Uncle Remus glaring at him. Giving a long sigh, he turned to Harry and Draco, “Come on boys, we’re not angry at you Harry, however there needs to be ground rules.”
“The truth,” Harry said simply. “About me, who I am, and how Dumbledore’s been lying to all of us.”
” Draco laughed as he plunged in.
Hermione still looked at him, shocked, before shaking it off. “It’s nothing, really.”
The lip balm spun on the piece of paper, moving on its own before pointing to the north. The three followed the lip balm’s direction, going up and down stairs, down musty corridors and through dim hallways until they found themselves in an old classroom hidden away in the corner of the school.
“Ohh him! He’s the very tall seventh year,” one of them said. “He’s in the common room!”
“My mercy!” Voldemort cried out. “Thank me boys, for it is your friend’s father and not yours, Draco!”
“What do you think?” Harry said, looking up to Draco, “for everything you’ve done to me! To my friends! Five years of bullying. You have to apologize.”
“Yes father,” Harry said. He looked at the pantry and with a couple swishes, their doors all flew upon and they were suddenly full of food. Even the old icebox had food and drinks, all perfectly chilled and preserved. Harry used his wand one more time to turn the oven on as Nagini slithered out from under it.
“We chose each other,” Harry said. “We’re a partnership.”
“Mine. Now please show me the ingredients to test it,” Draco said shortly. “I need to break down my blood’s components.”
“You won’t tell my brothers right?” Ron asked, his face redder than his hair. Cedric shook his head. Ron took a breath, “You know Theodore Nott? He’s a … he’s a Slytherin. We’ve been… talking you know, and uhh… well with our talks I saw… see that he’s not really a slimy git like the other Slytherins and he is nice to look at and sometimes at night my, you know, agrees and—”
“That’s not till the afternoon,” Niall shrugged, “Plenty of time to make out with Neville and grab his ass.”
“Yeah, he’s a cool dude,” Harry grinned. “Remus and Sirius are amazing!”
Harry and Niall’s life drastically improved. It took some time for them to get used to living with so much more freedom and open love from Remus and Sirius, but slowly over the years, the abuse and trauma from living with the Dursleys went away. Even so, however, as they have gotten older Harry and Niall only seemed to get closer and closer. The second day after they moved in with Remus and Sirius, for example, Remus took Harry out to buy blankets, soft stuff, plushies, and everything else he needed for a nest, and though the man showed Harry how to begin it, Harry refused Remus or even Sirius near it as he worked on it. Only Niall was allowed in Harry’s nest, the Omega roughly pulling his brother into it in order to scent a few plush animals. Besides that incident, the boys grew as happy, normal children. Niall took to the outdoors like a fish to water, planning outside whenever he could, even if it was just flying around on Sirius’ old broom with the older Alpha supervising. Harry loved doing that as well, however, he also found to have a flair for more indoor activities. Such as potion-making. The young boy seemed to have inherited his mother’s natural ability at Potions, making very simple and silly potions that turn the drinker’s hair different colors by the time he was nine! His favorite was a potion that turns the drinker’s hair pink, which he may have snuck into Sirius’ drink once or twice or ten times. He got in trouble for it, yeah, but it was well worth it. He also liked to take care of animals, much to Remus and Sirius’ amusement. However, that also included the rare garden snake that would show up every now and again, and Harry would bend down and talk with them, or rather hiss with them and pretend to know what they were hissing back. It creeped Sirius out, but even after talking about it Harry never stopped.
“A bit,” Blaise said.
“Well imagine he does, and they want to start a family, with a potion like this, he can, and Mrs. Weasley would definitely be very happy about it,” Harry said. “The point is, that I can see this whole situation producing something good if I can figure out what exactly is making me able to get pregnant.”
“Yeah, yeah that’ll be great,” Draco agreed. He nodded and looked at the book, muttering the ingredients needed. “Many of these are very rare,” he said. “Belladonna I would expect, as with Hellebore and Hemlock, those I can get easily, we can get those from Snape’s personal stash. But the others… Blood lilies, venom from various snakes… this will take time to gather. However…” he continued to read the directions, “we should be able to make it. Especially if you and your friends were able to make Polyjuice Potion three years ago.”
“Draco!” Harry said a little loudly, “please… we don’t want to wake up my Uncles.”
“Yeah, and this might help you in Quidditch too, you know, ignore the rest of those uh slimy gits,” Cedric said.
Harry was still getting his notebook out as she was talking. Some of his classmates laughed as he was signaled out. Harry felt his face reddened but gave no answer. This was apparently the wrong thing to do as Ms. Samael said, “Oh so you are too smart to take notes I take it? Well then Mr. Potter, if you would list for me now all six Generals, I may consider not giving you detention for disrupting my class!”
Harry nodded and said, “And everyone who is Azkaban. Voldemort wants to free them soon… I know it’s going to be soon.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Harry said, thankful that his robes hid his neck. He walked out and, as told, quickly made his way to the Gryffindor Common Room where he found Hermione alone.
“Harry didn’t tell us that,” Ron grumbled, “just that he had a fight with some Slytherins, but it wasn’t Draco.”
“Shush!” Harry said.
“Very funny Malfoy,” Angelina said, “how do we know that it wasn’t you who told Crabbe to do that!”
“Oh, right of course, sorry,” Hermione blushed, and she removed her arms from Harry’s neck gently, clearly embarrassed, before stopping. “Wait… did I hear you right?”
The bullying naturally didn’t stop; however, it was a comfort for Harry to have his dormmates defend him. Seamus and Dean took it upon themselves, whenever Ron and Hermione weren’t around, to ack as sort of bodyguards for the Omega as an act of contrition. It was amusing to Harry, having the two Betas act as bodyguards, however, he was just happy to have his friends back again, so he overlooked the times when they were being a little too pushy about guarding him. One thing he wished they could fully guard him against, however, was the Alpha Protein that always found its way into Harry’s food. He felt bad giving it to Ron always, as it made the Alpha go into an almost lustful frenzy however every time Harry tried to say nothing or just refuse to eat, Ron just brushed off his concerns, “It’s nothing really mate, just means I get to nut harder,” he joked a week into classes.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled at them both, “this means so much to me—Draco and I are going to go over it tomorrow, I’ll tell you both more when I know more, okay?”
Draco refused to leave Harry’s side for even a second. It was the day after the full moon, about a week until Halloween, and Draco refused to even let Harry use the bathroom by himself. Harry felt annoyed, but even then he didn’t feel particularly safe whenever he was outside the castle. Even sitting by the window he felt the angry glares from the forest, causing the hair on the back of his neck to rise along with a need to run. He found himself combing through his Potions book, looking for any spell or hint that would help him. All he found was a spell he never heard of. There was no description except for “For Enemies” and Harry was uncertain to test it out.
The door opened and Voldemort handed Harry his clothes before closing the door once more. He turned to Twilfitt and said, “Harry will be wearing them out.”
Harry turned to look at his friends.
The snake looked up at Harry, blinking in surprise.
“Then we have an agreement,” Remus smiled and offered his hand. Malfoy glared at it as though it was the most disgusting thing in the world, but he shook it after a moment.
“Yes Harry, your time in Hogwarts has clearly made you grow soft,” Voldemort said. “So in your time of isolation, we shall resume your training in the Dark Arts.”
“Chocolate parfait and tea, understand,” Draco nodded. “What is that woman doing to you two that hurts your hand? It can’t be simple lines.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Hermione said. Madam Malkin’s eyes fell on Harry. He could feel an intense hatred and stepped back. She smiled at the two Alphas, “Why don’t you two dears go and wait in the back for my fittings? I only have two, I’m sorry.”
Blaise jumped up suddenly, looking furious. “Don’t move,” he said and ran for the dormitory. Harry frowned and looked at the other two.
Harry looked at Draco and felt his cheeks turn red. This was a side he barely saw in the Alpha. He seemed soft, gentle, and caring. There may be something there that wasn’t there before, in Harry’s eyes. No arrogance, just concern. Harry nodded and lifted his hand for Draco to mend. Draco pressed his wand against Harry and the blood cleaned itself up before bandages appeared, wrapping around the middle of his hand so he still had use of his fingers. “There,” Draco breathed. “It should help with the scarring, maybe make it faint at least..”
“Yeah, it kind of was,” Niall said a little embarrassingly, “Granger—that girl who’s with him—kept having to help him out. Also, Harry, Potion-making is hard when I don’t have my brother helping out.”
“Of course, my love, of course,” Voldemort said. “Ah, here we are,” he pointed to the Apothecary right next to Flourish and Blotts. Remus frowned and looked around, “You never really told me what exactly you need here,” he said.
Greyback’s eyes focused on Harry, a deathly chuckle rolled in his throat and he spat, the mixture of blood and spit landing on Harry’s cheek. “You bitch,” Greyback cursed. “The Dark Lord’s going to…” life left Greyback’s eyes, and his body slackened.
“He will be,” Voldemort said, nodding. “His womb is damaged, but it will repair itself normally with time. The problem is that I do not know how to act from this. I cannot go to the Aurors, his friend’s family is tied deeply to them so they would cover it up or just call it an accident.”
Harry looked at Draco for a moment, “Actually, I’ll take you up on that, thanks,” He said. “I’ll write a reply during our break.”
“F-Fred,” George said, “I think we found one!”
“What do you mean?” Harry demanded.
“He doesn’t have one—”
“Of course, my lord,” Mr. Malfoy said, bowing his head briefly. They returned to Malfoy Manor briefly so Voldemort could take the hawk and then he left, appearing in front of his home where a note waited for him from Remus.
“Whatever they are, it concerns me having a baby with your father,” Harry said, a look of ill disgust on his face. “But… I’m only sixteen!”
“I know,” Harry nodded, “Just don’t treat me like a helpless damsel… the shock’s out of my system I think.”
“I mean if they’re that sexy enough, yeah,” Blaise smirked, “but I don’t think I can handle dating the Dark Lord’s son, sorry Harry.”
Harry and Draco both felt a heavy crushing feeling within them. As if the reality of the situation finally fell on the clearing as they stared at their new marks on their hands. Harry shivered as Draco’s lip whimpered. Both of them were on the verge of crying. Blaise saw this and sighed, wrapping an arm around both their shoulders and pulling them closer. “Come on, buck up, eh? Not ever mage can say they’ve been personally marked and protected by the Prince of Darkness, eh? We three are about to spend a lot of personal time together so you really should just get used to my being here. Besides! Down the road, you two are going to be like ‘thank you Blaise for marking us as yours! We love you very much.’ No… alright give it some time.”
“Alpha stuff,” Draco muttered. Greengrass just raised an eyebrow at that but left it at that. However, the people around her perked up at Harry’s name and started to whisper and gossip. Harry’s heart fell as he looked around. The school will know that Harry Potter slept in the Slytherin dormitories in an hour.
“No, not that,” Hermione said, grimacing. “I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we’re not going to learn any defense from her at all.”
“What, Hermione? It’s true, that’s what we’re doing,” Harry defended himself. “Besides, its better that we keep these to ourselves because, well, I think I can get pregnant.”
“Patience, Sirius, let me see if I cannot invite a shadow to answer your questions,” Dumbledore said. He looked around, “But there is far too much light in here—Ron, if you would please, be a good lad and close the curtains and extinguish the candles?”
“Come along Potter!” Nott yelled out.
“You’re an Omega!” Ginny raved. “You’re an Omega and you’re supposed to be an Alpha! You lied to us! You lied to me!”
“I needed to walk, to run and stretch my legs,” Harry said. “I’m stuck at the Burrow because of everything that is going on. And I just felt this hot agitation inside me growing.”
“That’s horrible,” Harry said.
The Dark Lord took to a chair by a fire, his snake curling around the chair’s legs, snaking up the furniture and onto his shoulders. The door opened and Voldemort barely glanced to see Mr. Malfoy walking in stiffly, followed by his son. Chuckling to himself, he said, “Leave us Lucius.”
Voldemort hissed, slipping back into Parseltongue.
“I rather you just fucking die,” Pansy spat out.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded, “I have no idea what this means, but it could explain our attraction to each other, not counting how hot both of us obviously are.” He chuckled and turned up, kissing Harry’s cheek. The Gryffindor smiled and blushed lightly. “And it helps that we both had crushes on the other,” he added.
“Not yet,” Harry said, “this book only have a glancing mention about Horcruxes from what I see, although talking with Greengrass actually made one thing certain for me. It’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a while, actually.”
“I am,” Harry nodded. “but what are we going to do now?”
“Headmaster Dumbledore,” Remus interrupted for the first time. “Niall and Harry are my godsons. Their wellbeing is my responsibility as well as Sirius’. The reason why we chose to send them away is your meddling. Any threats to the family will be dealt with by the family. For now, until we can see otherwise, I feel our relationship should stay completely professional.”
“No,” Uncle Sirius said, “he’ll be busy all day preparing for the Initiation.”
The twins gasped. Harry turned to Umbridge as Niall turned his gaze at the Minister. Their hearts felt heavy on the point of shattering at this revelation. Their own Ministry was the reason why they near heard from Viktor. The Ministry is to be blamed for separating the twins from their first friend.
“Thanks,” Ron said. Now that it was the two of them, Theo couldn’t help but feel an uneasy awkwardness between them. It reminded him of their previous meetings.
Gryffindor’s Rest was surprisingly empty for a Friday afternoon, but that was for the better in Draco’s mind. He did not want anyone to see him actually being interviewed for the job. Believe it or not, Draco Malfoy never had a job before, sure he helped out immensely with his grandparents and parents (mostly when forced to by his parents) but he came from a background of money. He was certain that his father would cut him off once he realized that Draco is not in the same state as he was, Mr. Malfoy was currently doing business in England if Draco remembered correctly, but that did not mean that he would be left moneyless. His grandparents left him a decent amount just for him when they passed, and he was determined to let that grow through his own actions. He wanted to thrive without needing to worry about his mother and father ruining his life, and a job during college was just a step towards that.
Malfoy answered. “Granger and Weasley,” he sneered. “If your brother has any sense he wouldn’t dare even touch them.”
“You will offer your blood to the tree, which will be blessed by the goat’s sacrifice beforehand, and afterwards you will add your name to all those who came before you in eternal servitude to our Lord,” Lord Voldemort said. “And in return, he will give you freedom beyond your wildest dreams, power to control the skies, and life eternal.” There was a preachy nature to Lord Voldemort as he said that, standing taller than normal as he assumed a position of great importance. Harry just nodded, biting his lower lip as he thought about Draco.
“I have to tell Draco,” Harry said. He looked at his Uncle and asked, “Can familiars give messages?”
Draco wept and struggled, but it was useless as potion after potion, Greyback poked and prodded his body, violating his dignity and privacy until, as the moon rose high above the mansion, Draco was completely naked, covered in a mess of potions and salves, and openly weeping. Fenrir watched with a sick fascination as Draco wept, before leaving him alone as his changes began.…
There was a hush as the Death Eaters looked at Voldemort, every face looking surprised, yet only Snape looked fearful. “Friends,” Voldemort said, “I have summoned you all to join in celebration. As you can see, I have regained a lost appearance… and power. The Dark Arts once stole my humanity, but I have conquered it, becoming more powerful than any Dark Lord has before… and it is all thanks to my son.”
“Are you not saying you’re not devoted to him?”
Harry smirked, “Winner gets a blow?” he said.
Harry took Draco’s bleeding hand and opened it, kissing the bleeding wound, licking at the blood. Draco did the same to Harry’s, both their lips being bloodstained before they pressed their lips together. The knife still having both their blood, Draco knelt and angled the knife, so the blood mixture dripped. He traced the Latin phrase, looking up at Harry, who nodded. “Be his sword and shield, allow him to venture to the soul hiding inside him and take its power for his own. Our love’s blood shall lead him, our love’s blood shall defend him; our love’s blood shall conquer!”
“How do you know?” she asked. “How do you know that you can trust any of them?”
Command
“I see,” Voldemort said, “and this took you more than three months to complete?” he asked, his eyes slowly blackening.
“I see,” Ginny nodded, “and you didn’t do anything?”
Harry found that he couldn’t eat much during dinner. His stomach was too nervous, and his hole was too sex-deprived. As soon as they were all done eating, Harry stood up and announced, “Uncle Remus, Uncle Sirius… Draco and Blaise are going to stay with me in my room, we’re locking the door and won’t open it for anything until morning, just in case.”
“I know but still… it’s just a vibe I’m getting from him,” Harry sighed. “Know what? Never mind, let’s forget it for now. My worries will be gone as soon as we summon the Dark Lord.” Draco looked as though he still wanted to talk about it, but Harry gave him a look that made it clear they won’t talk about it for now. Instead the two spent their break looking over the shelf, pulling out any books that looked as though it will pertain information they need. Draco skimmed through some books while Harry stuffed one or two into his bag for later reading. One book in particular was a reproduction of a journal named
“You know,” she whispered, “we haven’t kissed once.”
There was a silence after that, as though Harry was supposed to feel sad. However, he couldn’t find it in him to feel that. Instead he looked at the two and said, “So… I now have a furry little problem.”
“Exactly,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Such a beautiful flower but with such an ugly meaning. I cannot help but be drawn to it.” She tapped her wand against the flower and let it float from her fingers, landing in the lake. “But I also see a sort of power in it. The flower in it’s beauty challenging its beholder. In it’s selfishness for beauty, the flower gains a strange sense of independence. At least that is what I like to think. Agree with me or not, for I do not care. What I do care, is what you will do with my son.”
Mr. Riddle waved his hand, muttering under his breath, and Harry gasped when he saw Parkinson’s other hand was thrust in the air, rusty-looking shackles binding them together, her left hand was in a strange case rendering it useless. She looked as though she was in pain, not bad, but reasonably mild as she fell to the ground. Mr. Riddle saw Harry staring and said, “This is what happens, Mr. Potter, when you are caught breaking rules. I pray that you are more elusive than Miss Parkinson here.”
“Yeah, of course, no judge,” Ron said, nodding. “Just know uhh, we don’t do metal.”
“But Uncle!”
“Not that it matters anyway,” Fred said. “Right George?”
“Good,” Niall grinned. “I’ll expect something great.”
“Oh… oh,” Harry said, frowning slightly. He looked down at the rude snake and petted its head. “Well, who knows, maybe Slytherin and I are related somehow. That much be how I can talk to snakes,” he said, giving Draco a hopeful smile.
yet and they barely understood my second gender!”
“You son of a bitch—”
“Okay Uncle Sirius,” Harry nodded.
“And who are you?” Theo asked. They both stopped in the emptying corridor. Theo stared at Harry, looking both wiser and older than Harry has ever seen.
“Yes, what do you expect to learn by coming here, Mr. Potter?” Mr. Riddle asked.
“He did,” Voldemort said. “Yaxley reported it to me the same day we went shopping. There are several charms on the muggle household. Only one protection charm, tied to your and Lily Potter’s blood, that lasts as long as you are convinced that the place is your home and those muggles are your family. The rest are magic suppressors. Harmful magic suppressors targeted specifically for your magic.”
“And we agreed and realized that all three of us have feelings for each other,” Draco finished. “This was a conversation that we were going to have anyway, but the demon interrupted us.”
“Good, now follow me and be quick about it,” Madam Pomfrey said. “Your room is ready; meals will come to you directly. You will have no contact with anyone during your two days, your heat is two days long, correct?”
of my husband. A feeling you might understand once you marry… if you live long enough to do that.”
Bellatrix frowned. She moved back to her seat, more falling into it than sitting. She didn’t look at Lilith, instead staring blankly at a fire. She was silent for a long time before finally looking towards Lilith, “I can’t remember the last time we had a talk that wasn’t about our Lord or that Potter boy,” she said in a haunted, far off voice.
“Yeah, I am, why?”
His snake slithered into view, thick as a man’s forearm and longer than any other snake, Nagini was impressive in her own rights, fearsome and vicious, yet never strikes without her master’s command.
“No thank you, Sir,” Harry said as he sat down at the desk. “Sir, why am I here?”
“Let go of me you disgusting dog!” Draco yelled, struggling. Fenrir punched his face and growled, “Shut up, bitch.”
“Oh?” Voldemort chuckled. “True, you are not melting in my hands like my sweet Omega here, but still, I can see you trembling.” He took a step closer and placed his hands on the counter, leaning towards the smaller man. “You will tell me everything about this supplement. Albus Dumbledore ordered and picked up a portion of the order, while a small dumpy woman with ginger red hair picked up the rest. She acted nervously, but then when she asked about the order, she relaxed and started talking about my son.”
“No they’re not though!”
“Thank you,” Draco sighed. “Thank you.”
“So sometime between eleven in evening and eight in the morning Harry disappeared,” Dumbledore said, sounding very troubled. He looked at Mrs. Weasley, “Where are the children?”
“No, no, I need to get going,” Tonks said, not meeting Dumbledore’s eyes. “’Night—”
, Hedwig flew towards them with a letter. She dropped it and stole a bit of bacon from Harry’s plate before flying off. “Who’s it from?” Niall asked curiously.
“I still have not forgiven Daphne for her disgusting disregard and behavior she has chosen to show against my friend Hermione,” Harry said. “She called her a mudblood! And acted as if it was nothing wrong.”
Something There
“Yeah, of course,” Ron nodded.
Niall perked up at that and nodded. He jumped up and ran to the kitchen with Remus following, chuckling. Niall helped Sirius with the eggs and bacon and when they had a plate ready, Niall brought it up in a tray, smiling brilliantly with Remus and Sirius following him. He went into Harry’s nest room without knocking and placed the tray in front of Harry and sat down in his nest. Harry instantly attached to him and whined. “This sucks,” Harry groaned.
“That you did Ron, that you did,” Harry nodded. “Come on, let’s go—”
“It was just the Cruciatus Curse,” Voldemort muttered, rubbing the back of his head. “Besides, I’ve dreamt of doing far worse things to you when I thought you were a Potter.”
Chapter 1
“That’s enough!” Sirius yelled. “They’re kids for Christ’s sake leave them alone!” He and Remus stood between the boys and the crowd, giving them all heated looks.
“Yeah, yeah I’m fine,” Harry said, draining Ron’s goblet and clearing his throat. “Ron, I’m sorry but—”
Harry nodded. “Almost,” he said. He looked back at the congregation, “I’ve saved you all with the help of magic that I would never known without the help of Draco Malfoy and Blaise. I would not be here, today, with these two. Blaise is Satan’s son… in regard to his father his will is mine. I study and worship the same practices that you all, however in this matter I will defeat Satan if it comes to it. I’m not going to pretend that I have all the answers—I’m not even sure who is against me and who is with me—but I do know that I believe in Blaise, and I will follow him to heaven and back. If all you want to do is throw insults at me, fine, do it, I don’t care. But if you excuse me… I have an old god to wake up.”
Theo ignored it and moved towards Ron. The redhead stayed still, so when he was next to Ron, Theo looked around. “Well, if you intend to stay out here, you could at least give me company.”
“Then why must you phrase it so vulgarly you child?” Yaxley demanded. “I must talk with your father about your perverse behavior.”
Number Four Privet Drive had its lights on as Harry ran up the small pathway to the front door. He heard a hiss and turned to see Nagini sitting in a garden windowsill.
Draco watched as Goyle spasmed. He felt satisfied with his work, and yet he felt it was still incomplete. What he has done would only effect Goyle, and only he and Draco would know what has happened immediately… no, Draco needed to figure a way to make sure everyone knows not to mess with his boy. “A mark? A lost finger… no, it needs to be subtle, something that can be hidden… something that can always be looked at.”
“Is that such a bad thing?” Harry chuckled. A mischievous glint appeared in the Omega’s eyes as he reached up and stroked Niall’s chin. “I’ve been such a bad boy, haven’t I big brother?” he purred.
Weasley is our King!
Draco exhaled slowly. “I’m with you,” he said.
“And I love you,” Viktor said, “but now I know I can’t have you.” He sighed and stood up from the bench and out of Harry’s arms. He turned and smiled at Harry, “Call me possessive, but I don’t want you out of my life.”
“If you are talking about magic supremacy over muggles, I am a little insulted, Malfoy, that you think I truly believe that,” Voldemort said. “My dear Adrian was half-blood, his father being a muggle. No, the purebloods who attached themselves with me brought along their values and have started the first war themselves, using me mostly as a boogieman. I saw it as a way to advance my research into the Dark Arts, so I did not mind it as much. However, it was after losing you, Harrison, that I allowed their views and insanity to take hold. I do not regret the advances in my research, and I make no apologies for them, my son, but what I do regret are the actions that have affected you and Remus personally.” He sighed and shook his head. “The Dark Lord shall fade away, dying a secret death.”
by a man named Gilderoy Lockhart.
“I’m sorry ma’am,” Harry said, ignoring the victorious smirk Parkinson held while her friends held in chortles. “But I’m only going to be here real quick, I ran out of my scarlet eyeliner…”
“However you have me,” Draco smirked. “Harry, can I take this photo and talk to my father about this? Please? I can make the pain stop for good.”
“Ron!” Hermione gasped, looking at him like a very stern mother would look at a naughty child. “Honestly,
“Will you…” Harry panted in a weak, soft voice, “will you hurt me again?”
The town of Hollow’s Grave was on the medium side. The houses of more prominent or wealthier members were spaced out along the outside of the town, skirting the woods for easy access. It was one of those towns that did not have any apartments, everyone had a house, from a small cabin to a large manor. There was a main street that ran down the middle of Hollow’s Grave, and on that street was a makeup store that Harry frequents. It was ran by a senile woman who called Harry a girl most of the time, earning giggles from teenage girls his age whenever they hear her. Harry ignores them most of the time as he buys his makeup, however for some reason, he walked into that makeup store feeling particularly angry.
“Zabini!” Pansy screamed.
“All of us purebloods are interrelated,” Sirius explained. “There are only so many choices if your son or daughter are allowed to marry fellow purebloods.” Harry nodded slowly, his mind distracted for a moment before resting again on Voldemort and his murder of Regulus Black.
The two left Ron’s room and made their way downstairs to Harry’s. Harry was surprised to see that Draco was still sitting where he was when Harry left. He looked up smiling at Harry, only to turn that into a scowl when he saw Ron. “Here to punch me again, Weasley?”
“How can you be so calm?” Ron demanded. “What about you and Malfoy, he gave you one and you two didn’t even have a date technically!”
“Whenever you drink that, I feel this anger inside me,” he mentioned to Harry one day as Harry drank his potion. “I can’t explain it, it’s this disappointing anger that is coming from deep inside me.”
“Yeah,” Ron said. Lavender packed a few small sandwiches as well as cookies and pastries. Ron took a sandwich and took a large bite out of it, smiling. He barely remembered to swallow before saying, “This is good.”
“Not me,” Harry said quickly, pushing the badge back in Ron’s hand. “It’s Ron, not me.”
“You know the words Harry…” Voldemort hissed in his ear. Harry did not hear him come close. “You have the power. Say it…”
Uncle Remus nodded and poured Mr. Riddle his drink before sitting down again. Mr. Malfoy glared at Uncle Remus as he prepared his own drink. Uncle Sirius had to take a sip of his own before he could chortle. Once drinks were served, Mr. Riddle looked around the room before focusing on Harry. “Harry, if you would let me examine your hand,” he said.
“You made me look foolish,” he complained to them and walked towards them, and into the darkness.
“That is something that I will explain later,” The Dark Lord said. “It involves an item that I only know half the details on, and I will not share until I know fully on what it is.”
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“It is alright, Molly,” Dumbledore said, “but no we have not find Harry yet. Instead, I would like to look around your room in case there are traces of the Dark Arts.”
“SHUT UP!” he roared. The common room grew silent as everyone turned to Harry. He glared at them all, “Fred is dead! Gone! And all you idiots can think about is fucking gossip? Do you have any compassionate at all? Or are you all just full of bullshit as you give us your shit-eating smiles and talk nothing but half-hearted lies?”
A figure walked out, silhouette, looking more a sheet over an object than a being. A long hand reached out from the figure, holding a single letter. Harry took it and read.
The Potter Twins took care of each other. It was the two of them against the world. When they were five, they learned about how Omegas nested, gathering blankets, pillows, and soft things that calmed them. Usually, their first nest was helped by their parents, but most of the time it was a special sanctuary meant for the Omega to calm themselves. When they talked about what they’ve learned in school, and Harry meekly asked for blankets, the Dursleys just scowled at them and Aunt Petunia found an old rag and gave it to him “Scent this then, boy,” she sneered and left them.
“Then what’s going on here?” Pansy demanded. “Why do you have a boyfriend if you’re not gay!”
Harry nodded and a thought occurred to him, “Sir, why can’t I tell them?” he asked. “I saw him many times.”
“Harry,” Mr. Riddle said, “in all seriousness, you can be a stubborn boy, a very stubborn boy… however, you are also resilient. You have a resilience and strength I have seen time and time again. Though at times we might have our own agendas, and at times we might have been at odds and have different views, you are still a part of my coven, our town, and I for one am proud to call you my spiritual Brother. I have watch you grown from a babe to a beautiful man you are today, and now I have the honor of marrying you not only to a well respected son of a well respected family, but to the son of our Dark Lord himself. Harry Potter, I thank you for this opportunity, and I know that your parents would have been so proud.”
The church members all bowed their heads in silence for a moment. Harry glanced at Blaise and the two shared a frown. “This is only the beginning,” Blaise whispered.
“We’ve been told that magic comes from your father as a gift,” Draco said, frowning, his world slowly becoming undone. “Does that mean…”
“Okay,” Harry nodded, his smile returning in full.
“Nakedness,” Blaise interrupted.
“Oh, so that’s why he didn’t answer my letters?” Theo asked, “I thought he was being rude.” He stared at Harry for a moment, his nose held up. He looked as though he was thinking for a moment. “Since you’re here, that means someone needs to find another compartment.”
“Who?” Harry frowned.
Part XI
Harry just nodded dimly, staring at the outfit in a mixture of horror and confusion. “Sir,” he said respectfully, “I do not mean to insult Mrs. Riddle… but isn’t this outfit a little too showy?”
“Draco, I need to talk with you,” he said when he was close enough.
They turned to see their High Priest walk towards them. “Harry, just the person I am looking for,” he said, without looking at Mrs. Lestrange. “As you should know, Samhain will soon be upon us, and as a new member of our Church of Blackest Night, you will play a crucial role in our celebration.”
“Then boys, follow my lead,” Blaise said, joining them. “Time to learn a new spell.” He thrust his hand out at the demon, “It is called,
“That’s messed up,” Ron muttered. “More reason he shouldn’t be here, he’s off the deep end!”
“That’s the problem,” Ginny said harshly. “Friend,” she spat out. “Damn it, Harry, I wanted to be more than your friend!” The silence that followed was awkward. Mrs. Weasley looked between the two of them and silently walked away, holding a basket of carrots. Harry stared at Ginny, looking dumbfounded.
“Huh?” Harry said, looking between the three of them confused. Uncle Remus sighed and took a sip of his tea, “We woke up to the demon—Blaise, making breakfast. I’ve tested it myself, nothing suspicious in it, and, well, we started talking a little. Specifically he talked about his life with the Dark Lord, and it reminded me a little of my life… with my own father.”
puts it. Anyway, goodnight.”
“He’ll find out soon enough! Let’s go see which poor soul he catches.”
“You heard me,” Draco said. “You’re a submissive? Then I want you to kneel in front of me for the rest of this talk.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Theology.
“Definitely,” Harry smiled.
Draco turned a corner and led down the corridor, into the first classroom that they spotted. It was a potions room, with empty cauldrons and long tables. Torches lit the room, though Harry could still feel a chill going through him from the cold. Harry turned and locked the door behind him as Draco gathered two chairs for them to sit in. “So, what is it?” Draco asked as they sat down.
“You finally believe me?” Harry asked, smiling.
“Come to the Burrow,” he said.
“In a cube until Loki deems it,” Blaise answered.
“Good morning pup!” Sirius grinned, “So… just two more days, huh? Sixteenth birthday. A very important day.”
“Thanks,” Draco muttered. He quickly turned around and made himself another one before leaving with Harry, having to push himself close to the raven-haired when they reached the backroom to squeeze past the dancers and out the door once more. They returned to their group and Daphne quickly got up to give Draco her seat. He looked around to see that the fratboy, Seamus, was gone.
“Nine years,” Sirius said.
“Yes, however in rare cases potions cannot or do not take effect in the drinker, and during such times it is the responsibility of the partner to try instead,” Mr. Riddle said, his eyes glancing at Uncle Sirius. “However, there are some men who, through the blessing of our Dark God, have a natural womb. The fire and the mark could be a sign that our Lord has blessed you with a womb.”
“Then why leave the other alive?” Voldemort asked with a raised eyebrow.
Draco gave Harry a look, “Did you even start it?”
“And you will have us as well,” Daphne continued. “Since Draco will kill us if we allow anything to harm you. So let’s see off the bat that’s, seven people who’ll fight with you, eight including Draco. Against one crazy old man. I think I like our chances,” Daphne grinned.
The boys nodded. The four walked with their heads high. They all silently agreed that they would not show any of their emotions to the crowd. People would be looking for their nervousness, their sadness, or their excitement. The people would want to invade their lives and turn them into entertainment. They would have none of it. Niall and Harry stood close to each other as they walked in front of their godfathers, close enough for their hands to touch but they didn’t hold hands openly. It was a secret thing for them and their loved ones alone.
“Oh joy… and let me guess, he’s at the prefect’s carriage, isn’t he?” Harry drawled.
Before he could answer any of his questions, Professor Lupin closed the door and said, “Right, time to begin. I know that this is a general course that we all need, but still, I hope to make this an enjoyable course. My name is Professor Remus Lupin. A little bit about me: I’m actually a graduate of Hogwarts, I’ve gotten both my bachelor's and masters here, I’ve taught secondary for a couple of years before deciding to get my doctorate, which was fun and something I advise you guys to never do. I’ve been teaching here ever since along with my husband Sirius Black who works for the Engineering School. I look around here and I can see some familiar faces from him, Weasley, Goyle… Crabbe, oh and Miss Brocklehurst, so good to see you all today.” He looked around and smirked when he saw Harry, “And not listening already, are you Harry?” he asked with a raised eyebrow.
He looked at his cute omega and smiled when he saw that Neville was eating a full breakfast instead of starving himself. He patted Neville’s lap under the table and the omega’s cheeks blushed slightly. “Good boy,” Niall whispered.
“Impossible,” Mr. Malfoy said, getting everyone to stare at him. “It’s impossible to think that our Lord would choose to personally attend a random child’s Initiation. A child who has no importance or significance to his church!”
Chapter 1
Back in Hogwarts, it was almost dinner and Harry made his way to the Great Hall.
“It was a dangerous time, if people knew that I was visiting Harry’s home to make sure he was safe, Voldemort’s followers would have eventually found him,” Dumbledore said. “I had to stay away for Harry’s safety. I’ve left a letter explaining everything to Petunia and Vernon Dursley.”
“Because I have caught several students using their familiars to cheat in exams Mr. Black, and while I will not punish Harry now for having his familiar here, if I see that fox again on the grounds of the Academy then there will be consequences,” Mr. Riddle said. The Blacks and Harry frowned but said nothing.
Draco’s hands were very skilled, he grabbed and worked Harry’s cock expertly, one hand moving up and down swiftly while the other teased and played with Harry’s balls. “Draco—draco—oh god Draco,” Harry breathed.
“No—well all I said was that I had a nightmare about him and Ginny dating and now we don’t need to worry about that,” Ron said.
Blaise and Draco also gave Mr. Riddle a sharp look, which he saw. “Husband, I mean,” Mr. Riddle corrected himself with a good-natured chuckle. “I must admit that Harry’s beauty stunned me, that for a moment I have saw my wife standing in front of me.”
Harry still felt guilty but gave Ron a smile, “Thanks,” he said.
“Very well,” Scrimgeour muttered, not looking pleased. Dumbledore, however, just watched Mr. Riddle carefully before nodding.
Fred looked oddly peaceful in his bed. His eyes were close, he did not move, at a glance you would simply assume that he was sleeping. But there was a feeling, an aura that radiated from Fred’s body that suggested otherwise. Harry took careful steps, his breath stuck in his throat as he moved towards Fred’s bed. The air around him seemed to grow colder the closer he got. Fred looked so peaceful, sleeping in his bed. But the more Harry stared, the worse Fred become. His skin was sickly pale, unhealthily white with blue lips and sunken cheeks. His eyelids were forever closed, and his hair was still, not as animated as it usually was. However, Harry’s eyes moved to Fred’s neck, where two large holes were. Harry reached out, and there was a spark of magic. Harry gasped and jumped back. “Snake bites,” he whispered. He turned to George and Ron, tears falling, “He was bit by a snake… the same snake that... that...”
“Who’s that?” Hermione asked sharply, pointing towards the middle of the staff table.
“Yeah,” Daphne nodded, taking a bite of food.
Draco smirked at him, and squeezed Harry’s side, “Look at my hand, boy,” he commanded. Harry did and saw that Draco was wearing an old ring with a dusty, faded pearl. “A Personal portkey,” Draco said. “All you need to do is play with the pearl, and you will be taken away to the store. We’ll leave in Hogsmeade.”
“That’s a lot,” Blaise said, looking a bit bashful, “I thought it was just a sex thing like our collars.”
“Harry!” Ron said, his voice cracking.
“We heard it from the leader after he ripped the other one’s head off,” said Macnair. Voldemort was silent, Macnair looked worried, but the Dark Lord just motioned for him to continue. “So after a few days, we’ve got the giants’ trust. They killed the ones who didn’t want to come with us and after that we left.”
Harry nodded and pulled out one of the books as Draco left to get their drinks. It was the first book that the old man gave them, and he leafed through it idly as he waited.
“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.”
The Slytherin shrugged and gave them a final look, “I will see you later than Harry,” he said, “I will save a carriage.” He kissed Harry hard once more, squeezing his ass as he did so, and walked away. Harry stood awkwardly for a moment, watching his boyfriend walk away, before turning back to the compartment and walked in.
Niall was in the Gryffindor Tower, still riding high from his date with Neville who looked like he was caught in a vicious hurricane. He looked up at Ron and Hermione, “Yeah?” he said.
“Oh? In that case, I should go for redheads like him too, shouldn’t I? I should ask Ron if he’s free later tonight.” Draco suggested. Harry’s face went red and he sputtered. Draco laughed, loving the sight of a Harry Potter lost for words. He walked out of the classroom and waited for Harry to follow, smirking at him he thought for a moment before saying, “But I think you’re lucky Harry, redheads aren’t my thing. Come on, I’m actually a bit hungry now.”
“Okay,” Uncle Remus sighed, “Boys, we’ll talk more about this tomorrow. Goodnight and don’t worry. Everything will be fine in the morning.”
The three days Draco claimed that he’ll have Harry under his thumb pasted quickly. The most they advanced was that Harry started kissing Draco’s cheek whenever the blonde teen did something good or nice for the Weasleys. After Dumbledore’s visit, Draco seemed to be working his hardest to try to be polite to the Weasleys. He started by apologizing to Ron and Hermione, Ron wanting him to list every single thing he had done against the trio (being a massive prick coming up multiple times) before Ron even thought to smile at him. Hermione was a little more forgiving, but Harry could still sense that there was a huge tension between her and Draco. The only real problem Harry found was with Ginny.
“Of course,” Theo nodded. “We are just acquaintances who are share a similar friend.” He stood up and turned to face Ron, “and with that, I think it’s best for you to head back to Gryffindor Tower.”
“I’ll show you how much I’ve changed, and who I really am,” Voldemort whispered.
Draco gave him a sharp look, “You’ve been teaching?” he asked. “And you didn’t think to invite me?”
“Or maybe you are trying to get into his better graces—but no, I am doing this only because the Dark Lord asked me to,” Harry said. “I am an obedient son, after all.” He took another sip and finished his first cup.
“It’s fine, Hermione,” Harry said, though he sounded annoyed. “Yes, Draco is a git, I get that. I’m not asking that we all just magically forget every single thing he did to us but that we just stay civil until he apologizes to us.”
“Because he is an Alpha and my best friend,” Harry laughed. “What? Are you worried I’ll be mated with him?”
Harry stood up slowly and turned to his friends, “I mean,” he said in a slow, angry voice, “that while you two have been palling around in here, getting able to join everything that going around here, I was stuck with the Dursleys! And while your vague letters didn’t tell me crap I kept getting long, detailed letters from my boyfriend, which I thought friends were supposed to do!”
“Let’s have a ceremony now,” He said, “Nothing official but… just something that we have control over… you have control over.”
He grabbed soap and started to scrub. The water rose, growing hotter and starting to burn, but he didn’t feel it.
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down the room, noticing briefly that Hedwig was in it, looking scared in her cage at Harry. Finally, he dropped back in his chair, leaned over his letter. There was a long pause.
“They are!”
Ron let out a huge sigh of relief and grinned like a little kid who was just told he now owns a candy shop. “That’s amazing! Though to be technical, I’m bisexual, see,” he pulled up his sleeve to show off a tattoo of the bisexual flag on an impressive bicep which he flexed. “Got this when I was seventeen, wicked right?”
“You sent her to trick me,” Harry accused, “didn’t you?”
“Because Dean, if not, if we’re far apart, I think we’ll be hurt,” Harry said sadly. “Last night for instance. Draco and I were in terrible pain. We couldn’t’ breathe, it felt like I was being stabbed. It was only when we found each other in the castle that the pain went away. We realized what it meant instantly and went to the Slytherins dormitory to sleep.”
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked.
Uncle Sirius nodded and the five of them waited in an awkward silence. Twenty minutes passed before the knocking on the front door invaded, scaring everyone. Uncle Remus stood up and Harry watched as he left, only to return a moment later with Draco’s parents.
Ron stopped. He looked between the two and shrugged, sitting at the desk on the other side of the free desk. Draco still did not move for a second. He had to force his feet to move, certain that his face was as red as a tomato, and when he reached the desk he sat down rather mechanically. Harry was smirking at this and he stretched, his shirt lifting slightly to reveal a tantalizing view of skin and pubic hair. Draco swallowed hard. “So how are you this morning, Draco?” Harry asked innocently but his tone and movements were anything less. Draco looked at Harry’s face, which was his first mistake. He seemed to be several times more beautiful and sexy today, all of his piercings in, two silver studs in his ears, and an industrial bar at the top.
Harry frowned. “Are you sure?”
“Your major,” Draco said, “I want to know what it is, see if our class times will match up good or not. Because I would rather not have a roommate who I only see late at night and on the weekends.”
Chapter 9
“Mmm, my two sexy boys,” Blaise purred. He stepped forward and started to circle around them slowly, his hands roaming around their bodies as he did so. “Such a pretty pussy,” he whispered, patting Harry’s butt causing the mage to blush. Blaise gave Harry’s round butt a couple soft slaps, chuckling. “I see you do a lot of yoga, dear,” he chuckled, “I have a few more things you can add to that for better results.”
“Come on, come on,” he muttered, trying desperately to pull his wand from his pocket. He heard a growl behind him and turned to see Fenrir starting to shift. Black fur covered his body and his jaw and mouth elongated, becoming more wolf-like. He grew in height, his shredded robe falling to the side as, much to Harry’s horror, he saw that the man was turned on. He quickly turned away and decided to just grab his pants and run, he can search for his wand later.
“Then you’ll be in my room,” Niall said easily. “And your room can be your nest. Come on, let’s get clean.”
Harry said, crossing his arms.
“You know, you really know how to be a bitch at times,” Uncle Sirius said.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, however there will be one condition,” Blaise said. He stepped towards Mr. Malfoy, his eyes flashing dangerously red. “You will not harm Draco ever again… if you do, you will regret it. I do not need you, Lucius, for an in-law when I already have the superior Remus and Sirius Black.”
Suddenly the red eyes vanished. Harry felt a hand around his throat. As he and Draco were pulled back through the shadows, and as light surrounded them, they were face to face with Lord Voldemort.
“DUMBLEDORE DID THAT!” Harry yelled; his temper lost. “DUMBLEDORE STOLE ME AND—”
“But can’t you find your way out of it?” Harry asked. “For example, using the submissive marriage clause to wed someone you actually like.”
“No,” Cedric said, “Starting with you two going downstairs and helping your mother. …Now!”
“It’s bigger than normal and has another…bulbous part that makes it so that when we have sex during the full moon, he is locked inside me when we climax,” Harry continued. “It might be the mixture of our two changes or just mine, but however in the end, male pregnancy is possible,” Harry finished.
“Then perhaps you should have defended against it,” Mr. Malfoy said coolly. “That is, after all, in your job description, is it not? And from what I hear, it is a simple tradition used in Durmstrang, the students performing small jinxes on their professors for the professors to block against and then question said students on why they used those particular spells.”
“Yes, Alpha?”
“Uh-huh,” Draco nodded.
“Though I’m curious about what type of magic was that,” Uncle Sirius said, “I have never seen that stuff before—did you really put an explosion inside of him? It sounded like it.”
“I—I well…. Wow!” Hermione said. “Well done, Ron! That’s really—”
Harry nodded and moved onto the bed, laying on his back while he held his legs up, his hole quivering with need and wet with his natural lube. Draco stood over him, hard cock in hand and aimed it at Harry’s chest. With a noise of relief, a stream of piss flowed from Draco’s cock and onto Harry’s body. Both boys moaned at the hot liquid, Draco moving his cock so he could coat Harry in his urine while the omega sat there, his hands occupied holding his legs up as his own cock jerked and his fur became even more matted. As the stream of piss stopped, Draco couldn’t help but stare down, chuckling.
“Fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up to my desk for testing,” Snape said. “Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
“No,” Draco said, blushing. “I just picked up a few things making drinks for my grandparents and their friends. This was my Nonna’s favorite.”
“I see,” was all Snape said, and he waved his wand to heal the small cut. The bell rang signaling class was over and Professor Snape silently excused Harry from his office.
Harry nodded and stepped away, muttering another apology. “Yes,” he said, and he began telling his father everything that happened in Dumbledore’s office. He slowly pulled out the ring and glanced up. “He saw you in my mind and I ran. The only good thing is that I was able to get this out as I ran away. I’m sorry, father. Truly.”
There were a couple of tables outside, all full of families or couples. Harry parked in the free spot right in front and smirked at a little kid who watched in awe. Harry helped Draco off and smiled at him as he offered his hand.
Move your hand from opposite Shoulder to fully extend and snap with the name.” He did the movement and yelled out,
“I uhh wanted to know how to go from here,” Harry said, “The group is called Dumbledore’s Army.”
“She can’t,” Harry said simply, and left it at that. The others exchanged looks but decided that it would be best to leave the matter alone. Harry simply relaxed after that, leaning on Draco as the blond wrapped an arm around Harry for support and listened to the others talking, giving his voice here and there but otherwise silent.
“Why would he do that?” Harry asked.
“I’m a boy, Mrs. Lestrange,” Harry said, doing his best to keep his tone.
“Then it must be difficult being separated now, especially with your… tri-monthly problem?” Dumbledore said, “We have heat rooms for our Omega students, naturally, however, I was told that you preferred to stay in your nest, which was always scented by your brother.”
Harry stared back at him, confused. “What?”
“Really? I could have sworn otherwise,” Greyback said. “Not to worry, a month of fucking you will remind you who you are!” He whipped his wand, sending a stunner towards Harry. Harry immediately blocked it and sent a Stunner of his own while Draco finally got his wand out and sent a curse.
Rodolphus fell lifeless, landing next to his wife. Harry smirked at the appearance of the two lovely dead couple and turned to the remaining Lestrange. “I only need one Lestrange to do my request. You will find a cup in your vault. Small and gold with two handles and a beaver engraved on it. You will go and fetch it for me.”
“Of course I do, how are you been boys?” Mr. Weasley said, shaking both their hands. He looked at Harry and his smile grew even larger, “Ahh Harry Potter,” he said, “welcome to the Burrow, and congratulations on last night! Though that was rather a surprisingly explosive ending,” he chuckled good heartedly. “Gave us all quite a scare.”
“Theo is too busy yelling at Blaise,” Harry chuckled. “He says the last date they went on is when Blaise collared Theo.”
The scarred words seemed to glow in the firelight. Harry’s face burned with shame as his three friends just stare at him stunned. Theo reached for Harry’s hand slowly, looking between both the hand and his face. Harry gave a small nod and Theo took the hand slowly. “How?” he whispered. “You told me it was just lines.”
Harry nodded, “They don’t smell home,” he decided.
Harry nodded he thought for a moment before speaking, “The diary… your diary, that was a Horcrux… wasn’t it?”
“I can?”
“Draco Malfoy, you finally got your small ass here,” the young woman interrupted Ron. She was extremely pretty with long blonde hair and a small nose and large brown eyes that were now glaring at Draco with full annoyance. She stepped towards Draco and raised an eyebrow at him, crossing her arms. “Well Malfoy?” she said.
An elf came an hour later. “Wake up, please!” it squeaked. Harry opened his eyes and put on his glasses to see a wide-eyed elf wearing an empty potato sack standing by the bed, looking extremely worried. “Please sir, wake up!”
“Before I knew it, I was running out of my dormitory,” Draco said.
“What were the two of you talking about upstairs?” Mrs. Weasley asked conversationally. “I called you down a couple times, you know.” She glanced between the two of them.
“Now? I’m making a visit to the Malfoys,” Voldemort said. “Lucius has ties to the Daily Prophet, naturally. I’m going to start opening up about Dumbledore as well as building my case against him. I was hoping to gather more evidence to use against him, however we are short on time.”
“He will be happy to let you use it,” Mrs. Malfoy smiled, her eyes shifting to Draco. The Alpha glowered for a moment before backing down. Mrs. Malfoy winked at Harry, “See Harry? We Omegas have some power over Alphas.”
“He’s a beta,” Hermione said, “and had a girlfriend.”
“There’s no need to be worried, I was just excited is all,” Bagman said, “you two are good friends with Viktor Krum?”
He stood up abruptly. “Harry?” Ron asked.
“Thanks, I wouldn’t have done it without Draco,” Harry smiled, “it was fun, right Malfoy?” He teased, sticking out his tongue.
“As if!” he shouted.
Harry’s mouth did not move at all, yet Draco heard it loud and clear as though he talked right inside his head. His eyes flashed with intelligence and smirked.
The two shrugged and returned to bed. Draco led Harry out of the Slytherin Dormitory and through the common room into the dungeon. It was dark out, not even the prefects were outside patrolling the corridors. Harry and Draco made their way to the seventh floor, going towards the Room of Requirement. “I want us to be alone,” Draco said. The door appeared, and Draco carried Harry inside.
“—and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knee Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing, “Come on now, Angeline—looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat!—SHE SHOOTS---SHE—aaah…”
, when Ron groaned and slapped his hands against his head. “That’s it!” he yelled loudly in the Gryffindor common room. “I can’t do it!”
“My sweet puppy,” Tom murmured, reaching a hand up to comb his fingers through Remus’ hair. “you do not need to get yourself involved in this.”
“But I’m only sixteen!” Harry said, pulling his hand out of Mr. Riddle’s grasp. “I’m too young to have a kid! I’m far from ready—I just got my boyfriend!”
Harry took the plate and shoved it under Hermione, “Smell it—in fact taste it,” he demanded.
“I will,” he promised, his voice sounding not so hopeless. He stood up as well and turned to Draco. He looked at the Alpha closely and made a face. “You are Harry’s Alpha, no?” he asked.
Hermione still looked conflicted. She had a deep frown as he looked at Harry. “I—I don’t know,” she said, sounding genuine.
“As I am, Harry’s well-being has always been my and Sirius’ priority,” Remus said. He took a breath and frowned, “So I’m guessing the woman you mentioned was Molly?”
“Nothing… really,” Harry said. “She doesn’t talk.”
“Then a mindless whore he will be, and Satan helps you if you interfere!” Mr. Malfoy yelled.
“No you stupid elf, you’re killing my Omega!” Draco sneered.
“Shame,” Yaxley muttered. “Then refill it.” Harry reached for the kettle and poured more tea.
“Yeah of course, I’ll just spend some time with Ginny,” Hermione nodded. “I have other friends than just you two, you know,” she gave Harry a smile. Harry nodded, and looked relieved. “But you know,” he couldn’t help but saying, “if you want, I think Blaise is left by himself too.”
“Why the hell would he stay with you?” Ron demanded.
“And the picture?”
The tooth popped out with a sickening wet rip, and Harry quickly wrapped his shirt around the fang before putting it in his pocket. The fang acquired, he left the chamber through the shadows, and arrived on the seventh floor.
They landed on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry’s trunk from her broom. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamp, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.
“As if I would joke about something as serious as this,” Draco said, holding up Harry’s necklace. Blaise shrugged and pulled Theo closer to him. “I got one too now,” he added.
“Freak!”
“He said no mum,” Ron said rudely.
“Well in that case,” Daphne chuckled, “how about you get back to kissing me?”
“Need me, eh Riddle?” Draco breathed. “Your pussy’s so loose and wet down here, you’re just a fucking slut for your Omega, aren’t you?”
“No Mr. Riddle, I am sorry, but I will not stand by and allow this man to insult my son or my deceased friends,” Uncle Sirius said. “Your son can stay, but I want you two out of my home this instant!” He and Mr. Malfoy glared at each other. His nostrils flared, his eyes bugged out, but Mr. Malfoy stood up, his eyes never leaving Uncle Sirius.
Lilith chuckled, “You didn’t know? My Bellatrix Lestrange… you sure have gone senile in your age.”
“Everything okay?” Harry asked.
“No, I changed because I was no longer interested in becoming one,” Harry said, he felt himself slowly gain confidence as he inhaled Draco’s scent from the necklace. “However I thought the point of this was whether or not my father was teaching me the Dark Arts.”
Sirius sighed and shook his head, crossing his arms as Remus returned to the kitchen. “Harry’s on his way upstairs,” he said, “and the Malfoy boy is on his way home. Very polite and has a good familiar with him.”
“Ten years,” Bellatrix nodded. She gave the dagger one final glance before holding the hilt tightly. Aiming directly at her heart, she didn’t give it a second thought as she stabbed herself. She gave a cough of blood and collapsed, dead before her body hit the floor. There was a smell of brimstone hanging in the air, the fireplace burned brightly as the flames appeared to grow, moving slowly towards Bellatrix’s fallen body, licking and burning every inch on their way until it surrounded and consumed the corpse. Lilith watched as her friend’s body charred and burned, the smell of burnt flesh mixing with the brimstone. It was a disgusting, yet sad display. Lilith watched as body turned to ash, and the flames died down until the fire was just as it was in the fireplace, leaving a trail of ash in its wake. Lilith shook her head and waved her arm slowly. A hole opened underneath the ash, swallowing it whole.
“Found anything baby?” he asked.
“We wait for Yaxley to die,” he said, “but in the meantime…” Harry’s voice died out, his hand moving to hold his chest. “There is a part of him inside me, the horcrux. A part of Voldemort’s soul.”
Like an explosion, sound came back to Harry, the rush of noise ringing in his ears, his family struggling, the disgusting demon’s tentacles writhing and, most importantly, two electric noises that surge and brought the demon screaming.
“Most of you are not even supposed to be here,” Remus said, “Skeeter I know for a fact that you do not have any children!” he said, looking at one woman in particular. He turned back to the twins and escorted them onto the train. “Have a safe semester,” he said, “Don’t worry, we’ll see you on Christmas. Stay safe and keep your heads down, understand?”
“I see,” Harry sighed. He looked at Dumbledore with a strange, thoughtful look. “Thank you,” he said.
Harry did so and Draco looked at his back, “I think I did more damage to you when we’re snogging,” he muttered.
Malfoy Manor turned into Surrey in a second. They were on the sidewalk outside of the Dursley’s home. “I see that Malfoy did give you the necklace,” he muttered.
“Give us an opportunity,” Harry said, getting Draco’s plan immediately. They smiled and turned to Blaise, “Let’s get married,” he said with a shining smile, “however, I want you to invite your father.”
“Both articles regarding your father, Mr. Riddle, brought you up, along with accusations against Headmaster Dumbledore! I would like to hear about it directly from you, as well as why you have not gone to me when you have learned? As both your Head of House and Deputy Headmistress your safety is my utmost concern, Mr. Riddle! You should have come to me first.”
Ron looked at Harry, confused, but the Omega just shrugged. “He’s a good one,” Harry said. “Come on, let’s get to the common room.”
“Excellent boys! Excellent!” Blaise praised them. “I’m so proud of you two. Now—hold still, and you’ll see how it works.” With a wink, he jumped back and held one hand in the air. “Ready?” he asked. He waited until Harry and Draco realized what he was about to do. Their bodies turned stoic and their arms and hands felt like stone and they gave a short nod. Blaise snapped his finger.
The killing curse radiated the room with it’s unearthly green glow. The cats on the plates hanging on the wall all froze and disappeared in fear. Harry’s face was illuminated, his smile growing with a sadistic glee. The light of the killing curse dimmed, and Harry stared at the lifeless body of Professor Umbridge. He gave a dark chuckle and hummed in satisfaction. He looked around and took his time taking the plates off the wall and piled them on a windowsill. He sat next to them and opened the window, “Close all the lights,” he ordered, and watched as the shadows slowly grew in the room, creeping from the open window. He threw the plates one by one out of the window, watching them fall to the ground and smashing into tiny pieces.
“To fall in love with Harry and Draco? Far from it,” Blaise said sincerely. The two adults nodded, and Uncle Sirius said, “Then the same rules apply to Draco applies to you, boy. Doubly so since you live with us.”
They were back at Hogwarts, Ron raving the entire day. Draco was honestly getting a headache from the Weasley, however since neither Harry nor Hermione were yelling at Weasley yet, Draco decided that it would be bad if he was the one to start it.
“Oh… well uhh… is this temporary?” she asked.
Draco shook his head and ran after Harry. “I know, I know that she said that awful word—but I’m sure that it was a word slip,” he said, “Greengrass is really is one of the nicer Slytherins, I mean she is my friend—”
“No Sir,” Ron jumped.
Cuffe’s eyes widened and had a shiny aspect to them, as though he was mentally counting galleons. He quickly opened up a drawer and several self-writing quills all jumped out along with several long sheets of paper. “Please, continue, and don’t mind the quills,” the man said.
“He does not—”
Harry quickly looked at the bundle of robes and through the pain in his scar, began piecing the two mentally. He struggled, his tongue pushing against the forced cloth in his mouth, opening and closing his mouth and moving his jaw until he was able to spit it out as Wormtail emptied the robes into the stone cauldron. “Wormtail!” He called out.
The British Wizarding World woke up to see a picture of a very handsome man looking distraught along with Harry Potter both on the front page. The public was shocked and horrified as they read the exclusive, those who once laughed at Harry Potter and cursed his name now weeping sympathetic tears for him and his father. In Hogwarts, Dumbledore was unresponsive. If he had a reaction, he did not let the Great Hall know as he read the morning newspaper. The staff all shared curious, nervous looks and began whispering to one another as the students all roared with hundreds of conversations. Harry found that his face was entirely red as he and his friends read the article. Ron looked between the newspaper and Harry, his mouth hanging open slightly.
he thought,
He looked up to see Uncle Sirius staring at him with concern.
Harry knew better than to ask for more details now. Instead he just gave a faint smile and nodded, “Thank you milord,” he said. Voldemort seemed almost human as he considered Harry one last time before the pure blackness and darkness returned, thousands of red eyes joining his staring at Harry. The boy, however, did not stray as he kept his stare on his lord as Voldemort backed away, becoming one with the darkness around him, his robes seemingly swallowing it and him before disappearing as one.
Dumbledore frowned. He looked like he wanted to argue. However, he did his disappointment and sighed, “If that is what you believe, then I hope you all have a good day, Professor Lupin, Mr. Potters.” He nodded his head and stood up. The family only relaxed once he was gone.
“Daphne Greengrass.”
“Ohh, interesting,” Harry hummed.
“Hmm? Yeah,” Harry said, “just looking for an extra quill,” he lied quickly, “Knowing Draco, he’s made Prefect too. I’m guessing a letter from him gloating is on it’s way.”
“Dobby must be punished!” the house-elf cried. “Dobby has been hurting Harry Potter!”
Uncle Remus sighed, “The point is Harry… that we don’t want you to think the argument was about you. We love you, always have and always will, and we still love each other no mater how loud or stubbornly we fight.”
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry looked around with his eyebrows raised, Ginny suppressed a giggle. The train rattled on and Harry looked around anxiously as grey clouds and night overtook the sky. He did not know why he was anxious, he was with his friends, and they were having a normal talk, easily forgetting about the awkwardness that Harry came in with.
The two Alphas watched him go, Hermione, frowning. “It’s like he’s a different person,” she muttered. “How can he be so oblivious to the obvious risks Malfoy has?”
Lord Voldemort was very happy. Today was a day that he liked very much. He was going to kill muggles. Specifically, he was going to kill the Dursleys. And what a day to do some killing.
Harry thought but didn’t say. His mind wheeled anxiously but no names could he find. “I don’t know ma’am,” He said softly.
“Would that tip Umbridge off?” Harry asked, “And what about Dumbledore if he too was reading my letters?”
“Unpacking her stuff in Ginny’s room,” Mrs. Weasley answered. She looked at Ginny and said, “Go help her if you’re done eating.”
“You? Potter you are a child—”
“I…yes it is, my lord, but how do you know that?” Harry asked.
“Huh?” Harry looked up. A snake who was wider than his wrist was making its way to him. Its scales were perfectly green, and it looked impossibly long. Harry winced and sat up. The snake hissed warningly at the sudden movement, but Harry sat still, and the snake continued towards him.
Harry blinked. “Why is me and Draco’s bonding the most unbelievable thing of what I said?” He demanded.
WEASLEY IS OUR KING!
he praised mentally. She smiled at Ron when she got near, “Hello Ron,” she said, “shall we go?”
“How do we know that your son will not expose everything to Dumbledore?” she asked.
“They’re my family—and—”
“I am—well maybe, just close your eyes, okay Harry?” Draco stuttered. Harry frowned, confused, but did as he was told. He heard Draco shuffling, the floor squeaking under him. “Draco?” he questioned.
the voice yelled again. A blast of sensations overcame Harry, and he fell to his knees as his anxieties and thoughts were blown away. “Kill Nott!” the voice repeated again, filling Harry’s mind.
“Yes, father,” Harry said once more. With their business concluded, Voldemort gave the two a final look before disappearing right in front of them. Draco breathed out and looked at his Omega, pulling him into his arms. “Everything will be okay,” he whispered.
“Draco!”
Mr. Malfoy sneered in disgust. “As if I would allow you to disgrace our family from marrying a Potter,” he said. “Honestly Draco, I have thought you would grow sense and end this trifle manner by now. It seems that I was wrong.”
“Good news?” Harry asked, looking between the two of them. Did he already know? Remus sat up a little taller and smiled at Harry.
“As is war, but it still requires killing,” Voldemort said coldly. “That man was in the way, and so we had to have him eliminated. Shamefully, even after Nagini had to retreat unless she too was harmed.”
They went to a section that was dedicated to collars. There was a man behind the counter, and he smiled at the two, “Teenagers?” he grunted.
Ch. 11
Harry thought. It was rather disappointing. He looked up at his brother as he confidently walked towards the stool and took the hat. He placed it on his head as he sat down. The entire hall went silent. Harry shuffled nervously, focusing solely on his brother. The brim of the hat tore open, and it yelled loudly, “GRYFFINDOR!”
“I see…” Blaise said, looking strangely thoughtful. “But why would he… Harry, let me touch your stomach.”
“Just say it,” Theo said in a soft tone.
The congregation all rose obediently, Harry glanced back to see that only Satan was sitting.
“And what name is that?” Uncle Remus asked.
Draco gave a small smile, “You’re welcome Harry. I’ll have more for you tomorrow night. Good night.”
“No! They dared force you into a cupboard! For eleven years! The Dark Lord’s son forced to live in such humiliation—”
“No… it’s a troll,” Blaise said, approaching the slab. “Father must have chained it to keep Loki in… perhaps if we get it off. His claw grew in size and seemed to burn a bright red. He pressed it against the chains that began to heat up immensely before melting off. Blaise did this to the chains until nothing was keeping the skeleton trapped to the stone slab. The three pushed it off and Draco raised his light, “Look!” He said, pointing to the middle of the slab.
Niall rolled his eyes, “Honestly Harry stop making friends with potions professors, you’re going to make me look bad,” he chuckled.
he thought to himself,
“No—not at all,” Harry lied, trying to get the flashes of his late night activities out of his mind. Particularly the image of Draco Malfoy.
Part II
Uncle Remus led Lord Voldemort and Harry towards the small part of the forest that was on their property. Particularly to a large tree whose roots were sticking out of the ground, and branches knotted together as the trunk looked as though it was twisted by two invisible hands. Lord Voldemort stepped up to the tree and inspected it, placing his hand on the tree for a moment before making an approved noise.
“Well we had much more important things on our mind,” Mrs. Weasley said, barely holding in her annoyance. Fleur turned around, her silver-blonde hair waving gracefully over her shoulder as she looked back at Harry.
“Really? I really don’t care,” Harry said. Niall frowned. “Look Harry, if you’re still angry about Viktor—”
“I won’t,” Harry answered. “This is much better than the muggles Dumbledore forced me to live with and, finding my father felt like some hole inside me finally being filled, a hole I did not even know existed. I feel… completed,” He looked at Voldemort, who nodded.
“Wait… Potter wants to go through that?” Zabini asked, looking at Harry with a new light.
“It’s a start,” Harry shrugged, “and for the record, Draco and I did not talk about collars. At all.” He looked around at the five of them. He relaxed a little, leaning towards Blaise. “What about you guys? Since I’m revealing all.”
“I’m not a werewolf,” Draco interrupted. “Greyback changed me, but not into a werewolf.”
“I did not say that,” Harry said, “I simply said that I will not marry him.”
They knew that that was what it was called. Their roles told them. Their roles guided them. Alpha and omegas bind together, Alphas and omegas mate. That was what they did last night. They mated under the full moon. But now… “Am I pregnant? Oh god did you get me pregnant you dick?” Harry panicked.
“I’m sorry, I am just too worried about Harrison,” Voldemort muttered. “The sooner Dumbledore is out of Hogwarts, the sooner I can relax.” He kissed Remus’s cheek and stood up, picking up both the letter and container. “I do not know how long this will take; however I will be home as soon as I can.”
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked.
“Besides our hands burning?” Draco drawled.
“None of you won’t be going anywhere,” a harsh voice growled out. The two turned to see the door to the castle closing, Greyback standing in front of them with his wand out and pointed at Draco. “Hello, my bitch,” Greyback said, glaring at Harry. “It’s nice to see that the Malfoy spawn didn’t pump babies in you yet. Knew you were saving yourself for your real Alpha.” He gave a smirk and laughed.
“HEY!” Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus both stood up. “You do not come in here and insult our son!”
The two quickly made their way to the hospital wing where, after almost half an hour of prodding and embarrassing questions, Madam Pomfrey declared that Harry’s womb was fully healed and functional, as well as his lactation system. She followed this by a stern warning to the two about “Testing it to make sure” and sent them down for dinner. Though Dumbledore was gone, and there was no threat of the Alpha Protein, Harry decided to have dinner with his Alpha, sitting next to him as they ate before pushing onto his lap when they were both done.
“I said, if you are to pray to the Fallen Angel, you should at least light a candle,” the boy said.
They shared a smile and turned to Dumbledore. “We can do that, yeah,” Draco nodded.
“I do, unfortunately, and that is the problem,” Voldemort said. “He’s a very powerful man, much loved by the people.” He sighed and looked at Remus, “I would understand, pup if you wish to get away from this drama.”
“They were meeting me,” Blaise interrupted, standing up. He smiled and took Ron’s hand, shaking it in a friendly matter. “Nice to meet you, my name is Blaise Zabini. I’m a warlock for a neighboring town. Harry’s Uncles knew my father and I’ve been sent here to stay with them for the school year… maybe even longer.”
“Good… yes, now sit my son, and we will call our followers,” Voldemort smirked.
“Sounds perfect,” Draco said. He split the books, and said, “Obviously it’ll be difficult, I mean not only will the magic required must be higher and more difficult that any average wizard to do, but just finding it will be hard. There is no way we can just walk openly into the Great Hall and read these.”
Draco smiled and kissed Harry once more. “Don’t you dare fall for Weasley while we’re separated,” he warned with a smile.
“No! It’ll be fine,” Harry tried to argue, but Mrs. Weasley did not respond. He turned to Draco, “I’m not dangerous!”
“Yeah… yeah,” Ron said, with growing confidence. “Thanks Harry—I think I’ll go tell Mum, who knows she might be so happy she’ll get me a new broom!” And smiling, Ron ran off.
Draco looked up to see Harry and Daphne grinning brilliantly as the others just stared at him as the guitar played. He smiled, his confidence returning, and he continued to sing.
“Hey! You’re awake! That’s awesome!” a voice said, and Draco groaned as he sat up, shaking the last of the sleep from his head. In front of him, sitting on the other bed, was a tall lanky redheaded man around his age with freckles on his nose. “Slept well, roomie?” the man grinned.
“And I am very glad for that,” Draco chuckled. He kissed Harry’s lips, “You know I love you?”
“And The Cannons have nothing but downs,” Niall chuckled. “But the Magpies have their downs—two years ago our Seeker had to be completely replaced because her legs lost all of her bones due to a misfired spell!”
Niall swatted Harry’s hand away, the two laughed as they stood up. “I’ll get the letter done. Then maybe after tonight, we can talk to Umbridge about dropping the rest of your detention.”
“Your most loyal…” Harry repeated. Voldemort nodded. “Then they are your most foolish followers, father,” Harry said.
“I’m not a girl—”
stared at Niall. Niall whined and took Harry’s hand, kissing the words softly and rubbed it against his scent glands. “What are we going to do?” Harry asked. He took Niall’s hand and rubbed the scarred words on it against his own glands.
Murmurs surrounded them and Harry couldn’t help but smirk as he saw some of the Slytherins starting to look at Pansy uncomfortably. He looked around and thought for a second before saying, “My father is merciful. He will forgive any insult or horrible thought sent his son’s way in ignorance. After all, we have been separated for sixteen years. However, if you continue to do what Parkinson is doing, who can say what will happen? I’m writing a letter to my father later tonight. If I were you guys, I’d hope that I don’t mention you.”
