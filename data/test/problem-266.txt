"Remember, I'm always here." I said softly.
"So, did you like that movie?" I asked Scorpius, as the Credits began rolling.
But wouldn't it have made me even more cruel to leave him without his own real father?"
"I thought you left forever, like mommy."
"My aunt and uncle... and my cousin."
he was planning on telling her precisely the information I withheld.
"What did she say?" He asked. I swallowed thickly, her presence still felt, sending shivers throughout my person, making everything just so uncomfortable and itchy.
"I guess we'd better start interacting with folks- let's have a table at the Three broomsticks right there," suggested Ron. And we all agreed, more than ready to have a late lunch.
But after a moment, he stood up and offered his hand, which I took after looking at it and then at him. I stood up, and Harry asked, "What would you like to do now?" I thought about it for a minute.
I stood in the kitchen trying to find an apple for Teddy who'd asked for one. Harry said he was going to stay in his home office for the day- that he was busy. I didn't mind at all, it had happened more than once in the past. I mean of course he's bound to be quite busy at times. he's Harry Potter. Even the American wizards know what he did. I found an apple and now went through the drawers to find a peeler when I came across a 7-day pill organizer and curiously recognized that today's- Friday- was not empty.
The rest of the evaluation went much like yesterday, and ended with Harry having been rendered shy, closed off, and nearly mute, just like yesterday. But, he was released. The room emptied back out, and Harry sat there with his head hung low. I went over to the spare clothes I brought, bringing it over to him.
Draco looked at the three of us, eyes lingering on me a little extra. I found it difficult to breathe, but kept any physical show of my emotions at bay, ignoring the pain in my stomach that so plainly stated that I am hungry, and that a small bowl of applesauce hours ago, one that I had to keep self-justifying over and over as I ate it and even afterwards, was not enough for the whole day.
"It was loads of fun, and there was nothing Wizarding related, by the way." My eyes widened in surprise.
"How'd that get in there?"
"It's ok. You don't have to continue." I understood now what happened. Talking about the war triggers him. I thought about what to say next for a moment.
Harry at the hospital :0! He thinks about a lot of things.
"Happy Valentine's," I whispered, leaning in close.
"I'm fine. Just got a little overwhelmed. I'm fine, though. I know breathing techniques and stuff. I'm okay. I was just staring to calm down." He explained. I felt Draco's presence as he leaned against the doorframe behind him.
I placed the last piece in the puzzle.
"He's perfectly fine. I made him a sandwich for lunch, and we played together for a bit too." I responded, feeling proud that I was able to help Draco by watching over Scorpius.
"Teddy. We can keep hugging after we put on our coats, okay?" I said, tapping him on the back. With a sniffle, he let go. I took out my wand, Accio-ing both of our coats, and helping Teddy put his on, before putting on my own. Then, as promised, I lifted him up again. He held on tightly.
"Funny how different it all is, hm?" He asked, his voice airy with a hint of heaviness.
"I'm not leaving you alone in a house! Surely you should understand I don't trust you enough to do that at the moment." I said, anger still evident in my voice.
"It seems you've gotten a bit sick, Scor. Don't worry though, a simple potion should cure you right up." As soon as I finished saying that, Scorpius began to give a hearty, congested cough, and I sat him up, rubbing small circles on his back.
"Enough, let's go home. Draco, will Andromeda mind if the kids stay the night?" Asked Hermione.
I didn't quite care.
Draco didn't respond to that. Not for a long time. And I didn't think it right to push for a response much. So I did what I could best: provide him comfort through the rest of the night long past the point where he fell back to sleep, and until finally, I fell asleep as well.
"What if we all eat breakfast together?"
"You're not going to have another."
I blinked, staring up at him. He sighed.
"For how long?"
"Hm?" Was what came out of his mouth as he remained in his position: curled up and facing away from me.
"How's 'Mione?" Ron's voice had gone so soft I almost didn't catch it.
"Hey! It's about to be time for class, erm... We should move along for breakfast," Gabriel suddenly interrupted, which caused me and Victorie to turn towards him. His eyes were wide and his neck craned forward, as if he was ready for a projectile to come whizzing out of someone's wand. I pursed my lips, glad that Gabriel had such a penchant for talking. He cleared his throat.
It's no use hiding by changing my appearance anymore. They will all know I am Edward Lupin, werewolf, and son of a werewolf. I should probably remove my disguise while I still can.
"Luna Lovegood," piped up a familiar wispy voice. "Editor of the Quibbler. Are there any updates regarding Rita Skeeter and her status as 'wanted' on multiple accounts of libel and slander?" I flashed her a grateful smile, before going back to my trained expression.
"Wait, I know you! I've seen you! Hi!"
"How-" I stopped, seemingly at a loss for words. Teddy, who had a long face, decided to speak up.
I looked around, half expecting to see Uncle Vernon, crouching to look at me through the small entry way of my cupboard, but everything was too blurry to make out. I burst through the front door, leaving it wide open, and took an enormous breath. As big as I could. I felt the cold air bite through my lungs, burning my already dry throat, cracking my chapped lips. It made me feel worse.
"Remember the stealth and tracking course we took during Auror training?" Asked Ron. I furrowed my brows.
"Draco..." he whispered.
"Okay, so... I talked to Bonnie and Gabriel for a bit before you got to the table at breakfast. She said that there could only be seven players in the field at a time, so I guess they'll be taking turns?" Luca questioned, putting his hand to his chin.
"We packed it all together," he insisted.
Every day I find more and more that I want to tell Draco I love him.
"Reducto!"
Wood, a drawer, rummaging, feverish searching. Cold metal, a sharp tip, blood. Screaming, anger, a sinking ache in my chest, more blood. The hallway, a voice, a crash, a bed, and finally, darkness.
His look became one of worry and it was clear to me he was nervous to speak to her. I held his hand tightly:
"How about you stop coming over for all of the tragedies and emergencies, and actually start being a friend again. Don't give us a heart attack and then try to move on like it was nothing when we're all scared out of our wits that the slightest word will make you slit your wrists. Then, we can talk. Goodbye, Harry.
I keep doubting if I've made the right decision. I mean, yes. Mal-Draco, can probably manage. But what kind of friends don't make sure their best friend is found and in good hands? We could have left as soon as he was found, to give them their privacy... what if Harry questions why we aren't there for him? I opened Rose's room, and saw her peacefully sleeping. I heard the muffled voices of Ron, Neville, and Luna down stairs...
"Good, good. Go to your room, please?"
"So did I." I said with a smile.Â  "Now let's go- in the shower." I said more parent-like. "I can't believe it takes you more convincing than Scorpius."
"Okay... Thanks for, y'know... coming in." I put my hands on my thighs, rubbing light circles.
"We need to continue looking." I retorted.
"This is how it's going to be, isn't it..."
"I'm sorry."
"Oh, it's not, but we're planning on turning it into a transport from here to the park next door- Universal Studios."
"After the Second Wizarding War, and after the rebuilding and refurbishment of Hogwarts and our Ministry of Magic, we had our first tournament since 1994 in 2000. While we were meant to have another one last year, the preoccupation of the French Ministry of Magic prevented Beaubaxton's from attending, and the tournament was pushed back. This year, finally, we may compete again." McGonagall ended the speech with a smile, and everyone began clapping. McGonagall waited patiently before continuing again:
I brought my hand to his head, combing my fingers through his hair, feeling as he relaxed into my touch. It always seems to calm him down, and I don't complain- I love playing with his ever-so-messy black hair.
I closed the door behind me, heaving a sigh as my eyes trailed to Harry- pale, skinny, and worn looking Harry. Yesterday, he'd had another breakdown. This time, because of the Weasley family. Harry spoke of Fred and the war, and how it was his fault that the twins are where they are now. That it was his fault Ginny is a single mother, and that he was the one who had draped the blanket of grief that the Weasley's always seemed to have over them now.
"So! Would you like some tea? or something to eat?" Said Wea-Ginny heading towards the kitchen.
Shirt forgotten on the bathroom floor, arms veiny and trembling, supporting him against the sink, back arched miserably, tears down each pale cheek- pooling at his chin and dripping helplessly- hair ragged, messy, unkept.
She didn't really deserve to die, did she? All she wanted was a good story... she just didn't go about any of it the right way...
"So. Next year you start Hogwarts!" I told Teddy, sitting next to him on the couch. "Are you excited? Which house do you think you'll be sorted into?" I asked, looking to make light conversation with him. I was surprised though to see him just shrug.
"All right now Scorpius, I need to explain to you something, but it's a secret do you understand?" He nodded.
"But I can't." He complained, I shook my head.
"It says here you can have a cat, an owl, or a toad. What are you considering, Scor?"
"Draco! Ven! [Come!] Your turn!" Said Maria, breaking apart her dance with Scorpius.
"Harry please just tell me. Harry... did you dissociate again? You should've woken me. Harry you have grounding techniques, you have me... Harry you need to use these tools to your advantage."
"There's that smile of yours." I head him say. Soon, I was met with the soft warmth of his lips on mine, and I the only thing I could think to do is bring our hands together and squeeze three times while kissing back. He squeezed my hand back.
He left the room excitedly, closing the door. I was left in silence, glancing down at the taller man, fast asleep on top of me. How on earth am I going to move?
After a moment, he spoke in a guilty and shaking voice. "I should have just... left a note saying I'd gone home and-" he took a large breath of air, more of a gasp.
"Everybody is alright? Nobody got hurt?" I said, looking around, Scorpius and Harry shook their heads. "Good. Good." I said, In a slight daze.
"I rather think Sirius would have loved this place... it just feels his style." Harry was looking around in quiet awe, before grinding to a halt. "Stop, stop." Harry tugged at me. I looked back, pausing.
--Harry POV--
"I know, but the opportunity never came up... why have you been sneaking out lately?"
"Good, he's just turned three. Got him a toy broom." Ginny began shaking her head with a fond sort of smile. "The bugger loves it. Probably imagines he's a professional quidditch player."
"Look, here's mine." He pulled his own out of his pocket, more simply crafted, and closer to black than brown. It was also smooth and straight. For a bit we just sat there, examining each other's wands before the compartment door opened again.
After a few seconds, the same incantation was heard, along with an impact on the mossy mound. The Welsh dragon screeched and clawed along the mountain floor to the mound, presumably where its eggs were. The projection in the sky followed a path to an opening created on the mound.
"Your birthday is soon. Isn't it?" I asked, knowing the answer already. Scorpius nodded his head eagerly.
"Harry, you need to do this anyway. I suggest you find the energy to get up and get dressed at the very least. I don't know where to go to do this stuff. It's not like I wouldn't go do it for you..."
"Really? I think you'd do good as well. I'd probably get eaten. That is, if the dragon likes skin-on-bones."
"Alright, alright. Then yes, I guess his is fine." I answered, looking at him bewildered as he so monotonously listed off the worst things Harry could possibly be doing as if it wasn't absolutely horrifying to think of, let alone imagine. Then, painful realization dawned on me, like ice across my veins. I furrowed my brows, stepping forward slowly. "He's not..." I swallowed, taking a breath. "He's not... been doing that stuff... right?"
"Okay, that's understandable. Well, our time here is almost out, but. Just before we wrap things up, let's go over your homework." I raised an eyebrow, looking at her. "Find an outlet for your feelings that isn't harmful. Next time we see each other, tell me how it went."
Harry's uncle, Vernon, was quite the large character. Honestly, any small child would have been intimidated by his look. I of course gave my most polite greeting possible, given I am in their home, with their son and their nephew, but I was very forcibly suppressing the urge to corner them and make them pay for affecting Harry's life the way they did.
It was late at night when Draco was sprawled out on the couch and I had taken the spot between his legs to lay on top of him. He was playing with my hair, and the Muggle T.V was playing at a low volume.
It was odd. The house was untouched, and the air musty.
"No... I don't want to do that to you."
a lot. It really is, and you have every right to feel overwhelmed, I mean," something inside me told me to stop. I cant be a comfort to him right now. I'm just as afraid as he is.
"Did you lock the front door?" I asked Harry
I became increasingly uncomfortable.
"Get over here, Scorpius," I told him. He promptly jumped up onto the bed, walking over to me with his knees and holding the spoons out.
"Harry." Draco called out for me.
"Let's go to sleep?" I suggested.
"Then what's the deal talking to him about your problems? As my family would say: para de comer mierda y haz lo que necesitas. [stop eating shit and go do what you need to do]."
"I'd think it's a lot more of you." He replied, playing with the bottom of my hair.
"I... I think I get it now." I relaxed my hands, which had been stiff at my sides for a long while. I put them in my lap.
I rolled my eyes, letting out a laugh. "It was great, Gabriel."
"Molly... How is she?" I asked, a hint of guilt in my voice.
I don't remember when I started crying uncontrollably. I don't know when I decided to hug him as if letting go would make me die.
"I hope it's come out good," began Ron, taking a seat after guiding Hermione to hers. I took my seat directly across from him. Draco sat on my right, and Teddy on my left. While others began to eat, I began tugging my sleeves over my hands, not feeling quite up for a meal. My stomach was churning uncomfortably and I was really too tired to find the will to eat something anyway. Draco took my hand softly, gaining my attention. He gestured to the plate, whispering in my ear.
"Harry, talk to me... tell me what you're thinking, what your mind is telling you." I pressed the subject gently, fully aware of his tendency to shut himself away and change the topic, and become defensive. I put a hand on his shoulder, which he didn't shrug off- a good sign.
"A lot of time and a very detailed recipe." He turned to glance at me, flashing a victorious smirk, before taking my hand and leading me to the table.
"Gah- please, don't scream in my ear." Hissed Ginny.
Harry moved ahead, pulling out a seat for me. "Why thank you. I didn't think you could be this classy. I was getting ready to do the same for you." I joked with an impressed face. I took the seat, and he took his own. I looked at Harry, who was waiting for me to begin eating.
"Mr. Evans? Mr. Evans, are you all right?" I heard a semblance of a voice ring in my ears. I felt two gloved hands grab my shoulders, and I tensed, then subsequently stopped moving, My breathing was still unsteady as I tried to find who was holding me down.
"Yes you are. I made the appointment. Get in, sit down. I'm taking Scorpius to Ron and Hermione's." He went from tense and persistent to soft in a matter of seconds, looking me up and down. "I'll be back before you go in."
"What's going on here?" Harry asked, after giving me, Scorpius, Weasley, and the other Auror an urgent, inquisitive glance.
I inhaled, responding: "At the moment, there is no evidence suggesting that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy pose any threat to the public, the Statue of Secrecy, or anybody else-"
We didn't do anything. Not for the rest of the day. Draco remained in his own world, and for the most part, so did I. We sat together, yes, but it wasn't like other times when we were actively enjoying each other's company. It was dull and faded, because neither of us were really present. Or at least, I was not present. Though I don't really think Draco was either. All I kept thinking about was everything that had happened today. I replayed every single detail in my head from the moment we made it to Kings Cross, to the moment I lost consciousness.
"Are you suggesting that we shouldn't have told Kingsley it wasn't bad? I would assume the fact that they don't think we're real is a good thing," commented Draco.
I took a deep breath, trying to keep calm.
you're feeling hungry?! 'I know exactly what will help me in life as I recover from depression, how about trying to starve myself?' Is that what's going though your head?! Hm?!"
"So you must know loads of stuff already..."
I looked up to meet his incredibly confused expression. "No matter how many people I lost, and I lost a lot of people-"
"Twelve, actually. My father took me to Hogsmeade once while I was still twelve, and I had a sip from his." He replied casually.
"But at least we have a guess, which means we have something to look for." Commented Ron.
"She's awesome. She even gave me a scarf."
"I... guess that means I'll stay in Hogwarts over the break."
"Any thoughts about... Yule ball dates?" She said with a suggestive tone, resting her chin in her hand, leaning forward. Wendy's eyes widened and I swear I saw a bit of red. I couldn't hold in the small snort that came out, and Luca did the same. We quickly looked away from each other.
"I love you, Scor. I always have, and I always will. Ever since the moment I knew you were going to be a part of my life, I promised that everything I did would be for you."
"Why are you always so sad?"
He stared at the radio. For such an upbeat song, and such an upbeat person that listens to it, it was off-putting to see him so gloomy. I stopped my sad attempts at dancing and grumbled.
All of a sudden, an ornate, light blue carriage swooped down in front of us, pulling sounds of wonder and delight, more than a few girls exclaiming, "How pretty!" From there, students dressed in the same blue tint emerged, with the same elegance of a swan, I think. That's how I had heard it being described from others here, at least. And it was true... I could see Victorie beaming if someone remarked that her mother attended Beauxbatons.
"Th-that means... we're not really gone from all of that..." he asked, and I could tell he was beginning to overthink.
"It's the mark... let me go get the ice-"
"Harry, Harry I need you to focus on me," I heard him say softly. I tried to nod but couldn't bring myself to it. I was scared. I'm a grown man and I'm scared of my own uncle? Pathetic. I flinched at the feeling of something on my back, then allowed myself to return my back to where it originally was.
"Old," Scorpius replied, though he kept hugging his father. Draco turned to me.
Darkness. Shapes and patterns and darkness was all I saw.
"Harry... I'd say it's... at least a little bit important... given the current circumstances."
"Why?!" He asked, suddenly alarmed.
I frantically looked around to my sides, grabbed the book, and handed it to her with trembling hands. Aminata uncrossed her arms to snatch the book away from me, her other hand balled up in a fist, much like my free hand. She briefly looked up at my hairline and furrowed her brows, before clicking her tongue and opening the book to the correct page.
"I uhm... I read those books." My head snapped up at Dudley. I faintly noticed Millicent rolling her eyes beside him. "I thought that... it would help me understand more what happened... it was... before. Before I met Millie. Around the early 2000's... I just wanted to see what it was all about."
"It's not important... it's in the past anyway."
"I should go check on the baby anyway, he's just positively adorable with his babbling and giggling." Just then, she briefly leaned in towards me and Draco secretively, but with a light, giddy air surrounding it.
"Answer me, please." His voice was a mixture of stern refusal to get a lack of an answer, and a soft concern as he coaxed me into talking.
"Harry, what does this all mean?" I asked, my voice a tentative whisper hovering at the edge of uncertainty. He furrowed his brows slightly, in confusion.
"I will, don't worry. And I'll explain things when I pick him up. Let him know I'm going to be a little bit late."
"Well sure you can." I said stubbornly. "Please?" I said with a much softer voice than before.
"It also dries your skin and makes it easier for your skin to break."
"I know." His jaw tensed, and I took that as my cue to ease him. I brought a tentative hand to his cheek, gently turning his face so we could look at each other in the eyes.
"Still nothing," he replied. His hand found its way into my hair, and he brushed it back thoughtfully.
"Of course I care! I'm not her friend!"
"Why can't I just give him Hermione's copies of the books? All of the notes are there-"
I looked at him, and the only thing that was coming through my mind was that I really, really wanted a hug. A proper one. I softly nudged him, signaling that I wanted him to move. At first he moved over a tad, but I kept nudging him.
Enjoy!
And I know your friends would be absolutely heartbroken if you were gone...
"Door again, please." I said, leaning back, knowing that my grip was giving out.
"But surely... I mean..." I found myself at a severe loss for words. I didn't know how to counter him, I knew he could be right, but something that felt like a million daggers inside me said otherwise.
"Harry," I whispered. "I'm not upset... I want you to be okay. I want to help you feel better."
"Thank you, Happy Christmas, Dr. Gilroy," I said, shaking her hand, and then allowing Draco to do the same.
"We're going to figure this out. But you're thinking too much about it and it's driving you mad."
"I'm sure that eight month streak is something you're immensely proud of! And I guarantee that Draco there is proud of you too, and so am I, really. This is your longest streak that I know of.
"I- well it's obvious isn't it? I don't naturally have a clean face."
"He?" I nodded. slightly surprised that I only now learned this information. "Congratulations, again. And it's okay for you to travel like this?"
. I hung my head low.
"Ah, don't..."
"Okay!" He continued his attention to the program seemingly without another thought. I headed upstairs in the direction Teddy said. I opened the door and saw a room with two owls, a messy desk, and a computer. No Potter. I looked around wondering where he could possibly be. I saw the light in one room turned on. I walked that way, took my wand out and whispered "alohomora" , putting my wand away before opening the door.
"What about Muggle therap-" I cut myself off. We can't associate with the Muggle World anymore. We stayed quiet for a few seconds.
I sniffled again, removing my glasses so I could wipe my eyes. I set them down on the night stand. Before leading the both of us to lay down. I hugged him, burying my face into his chest.
"Are you alright?" He said. He's really just standing there letting me collapse on him like it's nothing, and I couldn't be more grateful. Everything just feels... off. I answered his question with a shrug.
"I've never been more grateful that you were around Harry. But why? How? You never cared..."
"But Dada I'm a big kid now!" Said the child innocently.
I felt his hand squeeze me tighter, I returned it in reassurance.
Harry closed the front door than rushed to catch up to me down the hall, opening Scorpius's bedroom door. I got him in the bed just in time, whispering to myself:
The park was enormous, and I had never been anywhere like it. None of us had.
"It's okay. Thanks, really." I assured.
Harry did eat a small bit of breakfast- two bites of everything, and about three strawberries. I was happy about the fact that he had even attempted to eat without protest. He kept saying throughout breakfast that he felt like he'd been forgetting something. I saw the wheels in his head turning as he struggled to pinpoint what it was. We knew it wasn't his medication, because I kept him on top of that. I can't have been clothing, or brushing his hair. After a moment I brought up birthdays. He stayed staring at me, before his eyes widened.
"Ron! There are children," Hermione scolded silently.
"Okay." He gave me a quick tight hug before running upstairs to catch up with Teddy. I felt bad for lying. The truth is I know nothing about Harry and Ginny's relationship and I have no idea if they'll work this out... whatever 'this' is. I got up and put the remaining plates in the sink before casting a quick cleaning spell. Deciding to put the plates away, I first began opening cabinets to find the one where the plates and utensils were kept, thinking about how last night, somebody was by my side in the bed for the first time since Astoria passed. I pulled my thoughts away as something curious caught my eye. I found Harry's medicine organizer, completely full, including the tab that said 'Sunday', which is today. I took the container out before finishing putting everything in it's place. Then, I went upstairs to find Harry and give him his medication and some water.
"ButterBeer is barely alcoholic anyway. I'm surprised we in the Wizarding World haven't done that already," commented Draco.
"Yes..." I felt myself begin to tremble slightly, and I suppressed it. "Scorpius, they raised me to have the same beliefs, and for a very long time I thought that Muggle-born wizards and witches were... lesser. I thought that they didn't deserve to practice magic..."
"I- This is
Enjoy!
"Where's dada?" Asked Scorpius? I became nervous.
"Remind you of anyone?" He asked humorously.
"But hey, they're just stupid students. Nothing bad can happen to us-"
Once I was outside, I caught my breath.
"Yeah of course. I was planning on introducing him to my friends!" He answered. I smiled.
Hooch quipped, cluing me in that the song was over, though my hands were still in position. I lowered them as fast as I could, looking at the crowd and rubbing the back of my neck in embarrassment. I went and sat back down next to Bonnie and Wendy, who had just finished dancing together, and noticed Bonnie was red in the face.
--------
"And now is when you tell me?" I said with an amused tone.
"Draco? Can you hear me?" I nodded faintly. "You were in there for two hours!" My heart began to beat more prominently, getting me to fully regain my bearings.
"Out-fucking-where?! You hate leaving the damn house-"
Shaking my head, I turned my attention back towards those in the cabin with me. The loud conversation that could be heard as Luca led me here had died down, and there was only the occasional conversation between two people, plus the usual lingering gaze between Bonnie and Wendy.
I closed my eyes, focusing on the never-ending in and out of my breath. Feeling it fill my lungs, then leave me.
"Dada I want to do that!"
He grew uncomfortable at that.
I paused, thinking.
At one point during his... experiment, in the kitchen, we did get a moment of time to do other things, and we took advantage to watch a Muggle film that he had previously owned on DVD, titled A Beautiful Mind, about a math genius who was very introverted, and didn't have many friends, who developed a disorder the Draco told me was Paranoid Schizophrenia. I briefly remembered him mentioning something similar a few years back. The movie was... not what I expected, but then again, I never really saw any films in my life. We spoke about how after two years in Muggle America, Draco had found himself at a store with Scorpius, searching through a large bin full of Muggle films, and how he asked a worker what films he recommended for someone who really doesn't watch anything.
"Is there a way to get rid of it?" He asked, avoiding what I said.
My thoughts were zipping around in my head, but I couldn't move at all.
"Are you a pure blood then? It seems like everyone in your family are Wizards." He asked.
him, aren't you?" Bonnie threw a 'don't be rude!' look his way.
"You too."
"That's... Brujeria... His favorite."
"Uhm... Yeah! Sorry," I scrambled to organize my materials on my side of my desk, stopping when I saw my notebook on Victorie's side.
"Well, in my opinion he was always a bit of a coward. And he was misguided by his family too. He cared a lot about them and I think he might have been willing to do anything for them back then. But the times I stood up to him, he would back down for the time being. You could ask him, too. Though I'm not sure he would admit it." I said with a small laugh. This made Teddy give a small laugh too.
I was met with silence.
After walking out of Three Broomsticks, I felt Harry tap me on the shoulder.
"But-"
"Dada! Good morning! Can we eat?" I chuckled lightly at my son's energy before letting go of Harry.
"I see. Well, that's good, very good. Less for us to worry about."
"Okay." I told him, not really sure of anything else to say.
"We should do this more often," Draco sleepily murmured after a long time. I allowed my eyes to close gently.
When we got outside of the house, after I bade farewell to Dudley and Millie, and gave a passionate speech elucidating that Vernon and Petunia don't deserve what they got away with, Harry turned to me, looking almost like a wounded dog. It seems his anger was short-lived, and replaced with guilt and sorrow.
Eventually we were left to our own devices, sitting side-by-side in there with the man, who was writing things down and texting people and, well really he was doing all sorts of things that I can't even begin to describe, but there was a mobile cot between us and him. It almost seemed like he ignored us. I could imagine Harry was relieved when the man left us alone, at least slightly.
"Oh!" I chipped, "Good idea. Practice has been a bit slow lately."
I looked around the room, processing what she had told me, shifting in my seat, trying to shake off the discomfort I'd felt since I walked in. Nothing has happened, everything is fine. I'm fine.
"I understand if it bothers you to tell me... I was just curious, but it doesn't matter.
I looked at Luca, and we both seemed to be thinking the same thing. I'd thought of joining Quidditch, but I don't think I'd fare especially well with the... Beaters. So me and Luca have agreed to stay in bowling, at least for now.
"I know... but you have to. But I'll be there." He said, grabbing both my hands. "Don't worry."
Harry and Scorpius, and their happiness, laughter, and excitement.
I've ruined lives...
"You're young enough to get away with jeans... and I don't want you ruining your nicest pants." I said, going into his closet, while he just looked at me.
"I can't answer that question for you, Draco... I can tell you though that
It took me a bit, but I did figure it out, albeit a bit slower than I hoped. "Today is Halloween... do you want to visit your parents?" I asked softly. He nodded into my shoulder, squeezing me tighter. "I think that's a good idea." I whispered. "We'll go soon, but I need you to eat a quick meal first."
"But it was different with me... I'm not everyone else. I saw you for six years, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was among the first to see you cry, albeit by accident." I tried explaining, while scrambling through my brain.
"She is gone physically, but, and I've told you this before, she's still in our hearts, and in our minds. Her and Maria."
"Just another minute." I said, hoping to completely calm down, and just enjoy the moment.
"Can we make chicken?"
âTeddy POVâ
I asked myself, holding back an outraged expression, and determined to protect Scorpius from these ridiculous, baseless rumors about him and his family's 'disappearance'.
Once the singular kiss ended, he rested his head on my chest, not burying it again, and we both just stayed there, enjoying each other's company. After a long bout of comfortable silence, he spoke.
"Hello Harry..." she told me before glancing at Draco. "Malfoy." She said politely. I swallowed hard.
Nothing was wrong, nothing felt weird. We were just together. Luca and I had started spending more time together, starting a few months earlier. The tension whenever we saw each other started evaporating little by little, but not completely yet. It's still there, hanging above like a raincloud.
"It's okay, Draco. It's going to be okay."
"No, I just wasn't thinking about it." He said with a shrug. Soon Scorpius zipped past us with a DVD box, stopping abruptly at the shelf of movies I had for him. He looked around, confused at not having found anything out of the ordinary.
"Good." Said Ginny, appearing accomplished for getting him to engage. It seemed as though it was my turn to ask a question so I went back to the topic of muggles.
I looked at the clock on the stove behind me. It's 12:05 in the morning. December 24th, 2008.
." Hermione was fuming. "There are things in there about-"
"Hello," I greeted him passively, summoning the folded change of clothes for Harry that I had left upstairs, and grabbing my wand from the top of the piano where I had set it. "I'm going to pick him up. Please be aware that his mentality may be a bit fragile," I glanced at the clock on the wall. Eight-fifteen. "Make yourselves comfortable. We'll be back." I apparated with a swirl and a pop.
I glared at them as I took my son's hand and went outside with him. I heard a faint "good-bye" from a couple of the teenagers.
"I just- wanted to make sure..." I took a deep breath. "What's the time?"
"But, that's not the point." He clapped his knee, sighing. "I just get scared... that if he's raised the way I was, he'll be the same nasty git. Every day I wonder if I'm doing something wrong, if I'm going about everything the wrong way, and if, come Hogwarts, he'll change and become like I was anyway." It was his turn to lean his head onto my shoulder. I then leaned on his head, once again wrapping my arm around him.
"Edward?" I whipped my head back to look at Luca, feeling slightly angered when I saw that grin painted across his freckled face. "Stop messing around, Luca, what's..." I stopped for a second to look at the broom again, outstretched in my shaking hand.
She topped stirring her tea. In fact, she just froze, her seen face turned downward, and she avoided eye contact for a few moments.
"I- tomorrow... no more today." I took my wand out, and with a swirl and a pop, landed myself in my bedroom, in Grimmauld place, feeling drained and hopeless. I didn't bother telling Draco I'd arrived home. I didn't find it in me to care that he was worried about me spending the day at the ministry playing pretend employee, and that he had wanted me to tell him what I found, and if I was okay.
The lesson finished, and we were dismissed out of the room. Prefects went outside to begin their patrol, while my friends and I made our way to the dormitories, talking and predicting about how the first task early tomorrow will be.
"I haven't read any of my books yet! I didn't have time to-" Continued Bonnie. There were words similar to these bouncing off the walls and around the small chamber. I tuned them out because I knew what the sorting ceremony was- It was only explained to me by almost every adult I know, along with their boasting of what house was theirs. Uncle Harry, Aunt Ginny, Ron and Hermione, along with all of the Weasleys, have been in Gryffindor house. Andromeda was in Slytherin, and she told me my dad was a Gryffindor, and my mum was a Hufflepuff.
"I'm never going to leave you. Especially not anywhere near those Muggles. Never. Especially not after today." He said, allowing us to sway side to side in a sort of comforting way.
Kingsley spoke: "I agree, Ron. Don't get me wrong, I would just like to assess the situation-" I slammed my hands down onto his desk.
"He had another nightmare?" I asked.
It's around midday when I allowed Scorpius a break from his school work to eat lunch. I have him homeschooled because I don't want to risk his magic setting off in public, surrounded by Muggles. I haven't really taught him much. Just small things using my wand. I'm not quite sure what will happen when he turns 11. I might home school him, or he will go to Hogwarts back in London or Ilvermorny in this country. I'm not sure if I can go back. I don't have a proper home up there and I'm definitely not returning to the manor. There's too much that has happened within those walls. I sighed at the thought.Â  As I was watching him play on the swing set in the backyard my mind wandered back to Scarface and his unusual behavior. I looked at my watch and noticed it had been an hour
I thought, silently cursing myself.
problem that I need to fix... I need to be there for her. For her child-"
"Isn't it a... soup?" He asked her, which only elicited a disappointed shaking of the head from her. "A soup when it's alone! A topping and a sauce with anything else."
One, mine. The other, Voldemort's.
The three of us leant in, trying to listen to the hushed voices of the couple. I still couldn't get a proper look at the woman they were holding, only her whimpering.
Malfoy in the eyes now without remembering how ridiculously I'd behaved. my wrists began to itch and sting. I felt like I needed it. Deserved it. But I didn't want to move. So I hugged myself.
I walked up to the front door. Worry consuming me. What could have happened to have Wea- Ginny this worried? After all, Potter is a grown man. I knocked on the door and waited for an answer. After not receiving one I knocked again. Nothing.
"...since when do you know about Elton John?"
"Harry," Draco whispered, rubbing circles on the back of my hand with his thumb.
"Can I taste what you ordered?" He asked.
Harry Potter? From the books? And Draco Malfoy? The bad guy?"
I took in a trembling breath, turning to face him.
"Sorry, I- I'll be in the restroom." She walked away as quickly as a nine month pregnant woman, could, and Ron's eyes kept going from me to her. I sucked in a breath, willing myself to keep it together for Scorpius, and on account of the audience that would follow should I have a breakdown here.
It's currently 3:30, and classes ended a half hour ago.
"Let's go, it's best to get some sleep before the sun rises."
enjoying your first ButterBeer in third year at thirteen," Ron added, narrowing his eyes at Draco.
I whipped my head up as the voices came closer, exiting out of the common room. Out came Gabriel and John, the former as gleeful as ever.
"I'm serious." I told him, voice hoarse and quiet.
"No..." I balled my hands into fists. All the times that Aminata would lunge at me and leave me battered with bruises and cuts quickly flashed in my memory, my reflection in the restroom mirror after burning in my eyelids.
"Tea in this situation? I can barely stomach the air I'm breathing not knowing what they're talking about up there." I replied a bit harshly.
Just then, I heard my compartment door slide open, and was met with a short kid with curly, dark brown hair, a little bit like Uncle Harry's. The kid was also pale, skinny, and already wearing their Hogwarts robes. I got a good look at them, just trying to figure out: are they a boy, or a girl? I couldn't quite seem pinpoint it off appearance alone, so I stayed silent as to not embarrass myself.
Malfoy.
"Again." He said breathlessly. I turned us over, giving him a long, slow snog, bringing our hips together again. He returned the gesture, and I could feel my excitement from earlier beginning to grow again. I reluctantly stopped for a brief moment.
"Harry, it's me, Draco." My muscles flexed and I squeezed myself tighter. "Harry, the door is open. You can come out now."
"Eating will help you." I heard. I shook my head.
"Scorpius, silent."
"And you remembered your medicine right?"
My hand, hovering hesitant over the tattered door handle, gripped it slowly, turning the knob as softly as I could.
"Harry remember your medicine please. With food. I have to go off to work early today. And I may be back late as well." I nodded as I turned to face her and groaned.
"You do realize we had to turn over custody of Teddy to his grandmother because you had proven time and time again that your mental health had been long abandoned, right?" I looked up at the man standing across from me. His only response was that of absolute silence. "Harry respond, please."
"No Harry, I'm only suggesting, I don't know... just go to London for crying out loud. I'll be there, we can apparate or floo and that way it'll be less painful for you I guess... explain that I'm going to be there, or not, I don't know! Tell her that you need to speak, whether it's here or in London or at Granger's or Weasley's house, I don't know Harry, but you can't just leave without responding to her. And you told me yourself that you want to have this conversation in person. Tell her what you've told me. Don't worry about it being perfect or anything like that. This is a big thing you're talking about. You're not a politician who needs to plan all of his speeches." He said, now slightly out of breath. I was taken aback by his minor passionate speech.
"Teddy, are you alright?" I blinked a few times.
. I leaned over the side of the bed, shaking him awake.
The tightening feeling had spread to my head, and before long, I had a headache.
"I can try."
"They don't understand- the others. You do, you know what it's like to have your mind tell you to leave everything behind because you feel there's nothing left." He said, looking at me and letting his sleeve drop. I gratefully did the same, still feeling speechless.
. I glanced over to Ginny, my wife, who was holding my godson Teddy's hand.
"But Dada-"
I sat there for another few moments before getting up and leaving, deciding it would be the best thing to do at the moment.
"I've been needing someone to tell me that."
"Hey, is it just me, or does it look like Wendy likes Bonnie?"
I found it a bit trivial- making the bed. I just never thought it was a thing Harry really did. I turned over to try and see him face-to-face. "Harry?" I peered past his side profile, and only then did I notice his feverish movements, and his stone-hardened face, full of pent up emotions. I went to him, taking his hands gently, trying to coax him to relax. "Hey, hey. It's okay, stop, stop. Steady yourself for me..." I rubbed up and down the back of his hands with both of my thumbs, and when he was facing me, it became a comforting passing up and down across his arms. "What's going on?"
At this I walked out the front door- not forgetting my keys- and made my way next door. I knocked quickly and soon enough Maria- my neighbor- answered the door.
"It's quite impressive." He said, then he saw my old potions books, and my Alchemy manuscripts. "You really have a knack for learning." Then he saw my shelves of potions and ingredients, and a few cauldrons. "I see you never really stopped making potions." I could see that through all of it, he was tense. I wasn't sure if it was my collection, my keeping it a secret, or something else.
"What?" He asked.
"Thanks." He said with a fond smirk. "You're pretty awesome too."
"We don't really know anything, though, do we?" asked Ron. "And... Skeeter, I wonder what she had to do with all of this."
"Sorry. I didn't realize-"
"Oh, okay. Well, that's good."
"What do you mean Ron isn't answering his floo?!" Just then Hermione hissed in pain, forcing Draco's hand to her own, giving it a death grip, forcing large controlled breaths.
"Well? Aren't you going to say something?!"
I watched as Draco twisted his arm, looking at the scars even as he held his son. Scorpius noticed the slight change in Draco's hold, and mumbled through Draco's shirt.
"I'll be right there with you," he replied. And in his eyes I could see he meant it. So, with all the strength I could muster, I straightened myself up, standing with determination. I dusted off my clothing, and went upstairs towards Scorpius' room, making sure Harry was close behind.
"Do you think you felt better after the hospital?"
"I was thinking about the Weasley's... What I've done to them. I needed to h-" He said, trembling.
"Now dry those tears. I promise everything will be okay- there's nothing wrong with you- and it will all get better soon. And you know that I don't lie to you." I said, finishing with a playful smirk. He cracked a smile, clearly entertained by my facial expression.
Gabriel's eyes went wide, and he turned to me in silent shock. I only shrugged.
"Reporter Kikis Trecus, Daily Prophet. How can the public be sure that the Ministry hasn't fallen into corrupt hands, as it did in the last war? How can we be sure to trust our ministry?"
"We were all a bit young George- War isn't something that reserves itself for older people. It affects everyone, no matter what."
"He needs to stop running away from the damn past! From me! From Ron and Hermione, from Teddy! He needs to stop trying to run away from life! It isn't going to stop just for him!"
I decided not to open it until Harry was ready to do so. I looked at the shopping list I had been preparing for the past week, then went down the hall to my bedroom to get Harry after telling Scorpius to put on shoes and pick up his toys. We're going to the market.
pressed down onto my chest and my throat, smothering out any sort of air.
I'm Sam." Said a boy with long curly blond hair.
"Yes?" She prompted.
All you could hear in the thickly silent room was my breathing.
"Scorpius?"
"Oh, speaking of that boy, are you not spending time with him anymore? You two were always around each other- Ow! What was that for?!" I heard John say before he abruptly stopped, followed by what sounded like a slap to the arm.
"Only maybe- oomf. Pardon-" I backed away from the person I'd run into.
"Um... Ted?" Her smile didn't leave her face, and she turned her head away from me, but still kept her eyes on me, as if watching my every move.
"I'm fine... how are you feeling?" He responded. I backed up to sit down on the bed.
"Dada-" Draco gripped Scorpius' arm tightly, bending down to his level with an evil glare.
"Oh yes of course come in. Everyone is eating cake at the table. Do you want something, there's rice and chicken, pastelitos..."
"Don't worry about that. It's big news, and it's important news too. It's also something you probably didn't see happening eight years ago. You shouldn't apologize for your reaction." He explained.
I glanced towards the stairs.
Man, this vacation really isn't what they probably thought it would be. But, we do get a lot of questions answered regarding the books!
"Were you in Mungo's because of your brain medicine?" He let go of the hug.
"Well it wasn't
"You know," began Draco from beside me on the bed, where he had chosen staring at his arm over cuddling close to me. "Sometimes," he paused, letting silence surround us before taking a breath and continuing:
"Tempus." I heard him whisper, and watched as the numbers
I woke up roughly 2 hours later. Harry's head was rested on my chest, but he stared blankly towards the wall. I moved my hand to caress his hair, my mind recapping what had happened.
"Disclosing our information is dangerous at the moment, but we found it more crucial that Harry comes and speaks to a professional. If for any reason we believe that you will not keep us under secrecy, or find that you have decided to announce to the world that the Wizarding World is in fact real, we will be leaving, and erasing your memory. Also note that your lack of forethought will put us in danger, and will land us both in prison for seeking you out." He stated.
"Yeah, you're right I guess, but kids don't really like me that much."
"I love you, Ted. You'll do smashingly at Hogwarts." He looked up, seeing something behind me, then looking at Draco and Scorpius. "Andromeda will guide you aboard. Okay?"
"I'm positive." I nodded- one nod- expecting more information, yet knowing he may not be willing to give more.
"I hope you hadn't planned to throw it all away."
"Herm-"
âHarry POVâ
Just then, a door opened softly, revealing Hermione.
Things were moving smoothly. Everyone was calm, and finally, for the first time in forever, I was able to actually talk to Ron and Hermione without a giant threat or disaster looming over us. It was the most at peace I'd felt with them since we were children.
"Not now Teddy," I interrupted, keeping a piercing glare on an absolutely bewildered Malfoy and a confused Malfoy Jr, who were stood just a few feet away. "Thank you, though."
"They are."
Suddenly I could feel the cold floor beneath my bum, and Draco's heart, relaxed and steady, flowing through the palm of my hand, up my arm, contrasting the pitter-patter of my own.
"Now, Scorpius, I understand you're upset but this is no way to behave-" I began sternly until the I felt the cat swipe at my pant leg from below the table, causing me to jump slightly. Harry gently placed his hand on my bicep, as though he were telling me to leave it alone.
"P-Harry I promise that it won't do anything to me except allow me to understand better what's going on." I explained desperately. "Please let me try to help you."
"Yeah, I've got it." I responded as I lifted myself from the couch. I opened the door to be greeted by Malfoy and his son. Malfoy dressed casually nice in a polo shirt and jeans, and his son similarly dressed. I could see faded lines where his dark mark used to be. I shuddered at the thought.
I also found it slightly amusing that when he spoke about Scorpius dressing up as Spider-Man, watching the movies with wide eyes, he was trying just a little bit too hard to make it seem as though he himself did not care for 'such a childish thing.' But really, I can see that Draco would enjoy it too. Because of course, he sat and watched the movies with Scorpius 'purely out of obligation.' Honestly, Draco can't hide from me. I told him we should all sit down one day and watch the three movies- because Draco says there's three of them.
It was long after dinner and the kids had fallen asleep together for a second time. Harry and I were in my room. I was reading my book and Harry rested his head on my chest. Things were still and relaxed.
"I got a bit upset at your friends for waiting for Lovegood and Longbottom to begin looking for you, so I went off on my own. I was worried that the longer we waited..."
"You delivered a child, then named him after your father... he's not even your child." He said, finally looking into my eyes, which held a glint of upset confusion in them. I gave him a blunt face, unsure of what exactly he was trying to say. He took a large breath.
"I was just thinking about... something I overheard at the book store. It was nothing important." I told him.
His voice was dripping with concern, sorrow, and fear. I knew that he didn't know what to say. I was okay with that. I just wanted him here. That seemed to have been helping, even if it was only a bit. Even if nobody else noticed.
Gabriel and I scoffed in unison at John's crude response to his question. He quickly received a slap to the arm.
"Why?" I asked, genuinely curious.
"Well at that rate you won't get anything done," commented a voice from behind. I turned around, sending a stink eye to Draco, who was leisurely leaning against the wall behind me, eating grapes. "What? I'm right." He got up, popping another grape into his mouth. "Look:" He stalked over to me, resting his hand on the desk and leaning over me to the book. "It's been a week," he said, pointing at the book. "You haven't read a word."
"Well, with the trauma that was caused by...the war," Hermione began. "It's not entirely unreasonable that they're scared. What's odd is why they'd think it was you of all people. 'The savior gone bad,'"She said with air quotes.
"Here." He said while sitting down on the side of the bed again. I didn't move, feeling drained.
I sighed, flipping the page and trying to find something more worth reading, when I felt a tap on the shoulder.
Lunch and dinner had both passed in silence, and I observed that neither of us felt up to completing our dinners. Though, where I only had around half, Harry didn't even get the first bite into his mouth. It just sat there on his fork as though he had an initial intent to eat, before realizing he didn't have the stomach for it. Not today.
"Scorpius- stop, you'll fall!" He turned around when he heard my voice, and scrambled to the floor, two seconds from falling every bit of the way there, and left the kitchen without another word.
I sat in silence on the edge of the couch, my arms folded and my head hung between my legs. The dream had me stuck thinking about Hermione and Ron... how we had said goodbye for what we had thought was the last time, especially after we had gone through almost everything together. The thought sent a sharp pain across my chest, and guilt began to form a small pit in my stomach.
In a rush, he bounded back down the hallway, throwing our door shut, and within a second he was sitting centimeters away from me, hand gingerly on my chin, before taking me into a deep, passionate, and hungry kiss. After my initial surprise, I returned it. He was hurried and feverish though as he eased me to a laying-down position on the bed.
"I'll care for the trolley, Teddy. Go on, grab your trunk and owl. They'll sit in the compartment with you. Remember I put a sandwich in the pocket of your robes. That'll be your lunch, dear. There's money in your trunk if you need it, but I doubt you will. It's enough for you to get something if the opportunity arises." I heard her say. It seems my feet had carried me to the front of the train along with loads of other children. Many in regular clothing and holding their robes in their hands, like me. Some, however, were already in their school robes. Andromeda had assured me last night though: "The ride is long enough for you to put on and take off your robes 50 times."
"It's okay." Replied Draco. He removed his arm from around my shoulders and held my hand to quickly give it a squeeze. I'll admit having him here is making today a lot better than the last time I went to the supermarket, but right now, I just really want to get home.
"Great."
"It's okay. Take your time, catch your breath." I said softly.
"Sure thing, Scor. Why don't you prepare those strawberries then, hm?"
"Guys!" Ron interrupted. "We're being awfully obvious, arguing about that stuff down the hotel corridor."
"Nothing happened," he soothed. "You did it. You're so strong for having done this."
"I care about you a lot too, Draco."
"We have five more days here, I think it's best we call it a day when we're done here," said Hermione. All three kids immediately protested it.
"No!... No. Please. She doesn't know I do this."
"Yeah," he sniffed and looked at me, "just... Parents." At this, he stopped smiling and puckered his lips.
genuinely laugh that you end up-" I got whacked in the arm by a menu, I retreated, looking at a thoroughly flushed Draco.
"We'll talk after class, Luca!" I said offhandedly, rounding the corner out of the great hall.
"Teddy!" I kept running, only barely glancing back to see Luca's arm raised and waving.
He sniffled again, and I held him tighter.
"Well, I have to go see Madam Maxime, so... See you, Ted," Victorie quipped with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
Uh oh, the gang is withholding certain information now?
"You know, Scorpius, there's a constellation with your name too." Harry said, I held back a smile while admiring how at peace he looked with the sky.
I felt my heartbeat quickening, threatening to break through my ribs and leap out of my chest. I heard Luca gulp next to me. He tapped his fingers on our table again, using his other hand to shrug his robes forward again briefly. My robes and uniform became a furnace, slowly cooking me inside.
"Give me a call." Weasl- Ginny walked up to me and sighed before hastily pulling her phone out and giving it to me.
"Goodbye then,"Â  said Ginny briefly as she gave me back my phone. She then asked Teddy for his hand and left with him.
"It's okay, it's okay. I'm here. Don't worry. You're safe now." My breath hitched at his words, and I felt myself heating up with burning guilt.
Teddy was using his Metamorphagus again, though not as much as he used to, still. He's growing up rather quickly, and he's quite the kind young man. He's respectful around the adults, and gets along with Rose, and Scorpius especially, given they were each other's first friend. I've also come to notice Teddy to be a bit shy.
"At least you don't have to deal with it anymore... right?" I felt bad for not knowing quite how to comfort him. I really wanted to just, sort through all of the information I had, but now wasn't the time.
"You're dating... her?" I said, turning to Dudley, a bit dumbstruck. I meant it to sound malicious, but it just came out plain, and confused. As surprised as I was that Dudley is dating a witch, I was equally as unvexed that it was Millicent of all witches.
"You bring feeling into my life, Harry."
"What did you do?" He asked knowingly.
"Why?"
"It's ok. You don't need to apologize at all. I'm here for you, always."
"Harry...?"
A seven-year old Victorie Weasley, along with Molly II, and her younger sister Lucy were all sitting off in the corner, looking down at their laps, not speaking. Neville was in a chair in the dining room, consoling a nine-year old Fred II, who was crying just as hard as Hermione.
"Thanks for responding to the questions. I wasn't sure if you would." She said timidly.
He got up and gave The pair a hug before sitting back down. I gave my farewells and watched as We-Ron went to get Rose and Gr- Hermione went towards another room, probably the bathroom.
, John," Gabriel quickly retorted.
"Who would have known about my life though... besides, it's alright, really." I responded. I brought my hand up to caress his face.
"They locked you up, underfed you, and punished you for making too much noise."
"It's okay, Molly. I'm sorry I hadn't arrived sooner."
I walked towards him, taking his face in my hands briefly, looking into his eyes, feeling time slow down... then, I kissed him, melting into it, needing the relief. His hands pulled up and one came around the nape of my neck while the other found its way around my waist, pulling me in.
to kill yourself..." I took another breath, squeezing his hand tighter.
"Harry! Malfoy. Happy Christmas. How are you doing?"
"You have feelings for someone? An enemy? Is it Draco Malfoy?" She said standing up as well, I froze. Did I really just say that? God, what an idiot must I be.
"Oi, are you here to visit my mum, or me?" I peered over to see Ron, smiling weakly at the two of us. I quickly went over to him, noting the bandages around his upper body.
"Well, you're about to tell me, or I don't know what I'm going to-"
"Come on, Harry's put something together for us."
My brows furrowed in confusion, but I did just as she asked.
I heard Draco's muffled voice:
After a second or so, he seemed to regain his bearings and looked up at me, before leaving to the bathroom. I stayed where I stood, watching him wash out his mouth from across the hall. I looked around, taking in my surroundings for the first time. Harry's glasses were set over legal papers, with Ginny's signature at the bottom. His wand was on the far right of the desk, and scattered around were various letters.
I stood in the kitchen with my elbows leaning on the counter beside my wand. My hands pressed over my eyes as I fought off my newly found headache.
âHarry POVâ
"Is that a challenge?" Draco and Scorpius had come towards us, taking a seat beside us on the carpet. "Set up for four people, Teddy. I think I need to teach Harry here how to properly lose at a card game."
Right now, though, it was just us, and a silent knowledge that everything has changed since back then, and that we're working through it together.
"Oh, nothing- only your heartfelt conversation with dear old mum!" She smiled a nasty smile, feigning innocence. I had to resist the urge to punch it clean off her face. A sideways glance told me she now had out her enchanted notepad and quill- writing. I swallowed the unease growing in my stomach. I should have been more careful. We shouldn't have left the house.
I closed my eyes, resting my head in my right hand, which was propped up on the table. My leg began bouncing up and down. I took another sip.
It was stunning how much attention to detail was put into this.
"Hey, hey, Draco. I'm here," he said, then tried to stifle a yawn.
"Hello, I imagine you haven't picked him up yet?" Hermione stepped through the fireplace, Ron on toe.
"Scorpius was really excited. I haven't taken him on a trip since he was seven years old," Draco chuckled. I simply sunk into the feeling of the soothing vibrations that I knew were coming from something as pure and simple as laughter and happiness.
âGinny POVâ
"Voldemort had given me a vision," he began. "He tricked me into thinking he was going to kill Sirius... I needed to save him- to go to the department of mysteries, I... it was a trap. When I showed up to save him, he- he wasn't there." During his explanation, he had stopped playing with the grass, and I had stopped carding through his hair. His arms were lying limp on his lap, and he sat crisscrossed, staring at them. "My heart dropped to my stomach and I thought it was too late, but it turns out he hadn't been there in the first place... he went to save me because we were surrounded and, well Bellatrix began to duel me but Sirius stepped in and... it was my fault. I didn't- He shouldn't have- It wasn't- I should've known."
"Draco?"
The conversation died down again, though. Luna still stood patiently in the corner and Draco had wandered back off to the kitchen while Ginny and I just... stood. With each passing second, it hit me a little more how much we'd changed, like a bludger to the chest.
When we separated, we were mere centimeters apart, gazing into each other's eyes, those beautiful eyes, holding a lifetime in them. I stroked his cheek gently with my thumb.
Teddy, Draco, Scorpius, and I were in one car, and Ron and Rose were in another car.
My mind was racing with her words. I didn't want to know what she could be implying.
As Ginny turned to go see Rose, I stood up, quickly excusing myself. "I need the restroom. I'll be right back."
"Alright, Scorpius. This is going to be your first year. Don't forget, I provided you with money. It's shrunken and in your pocket, and I charmed it to grow back to normal size when you take hold of it."
There is a final book to this series, which can be found on my profile.
"Hmm... Interesting."
"It's made of Willow wood, and it has a Unicorn hair core. Dad says that's the same core as his wand. And it's 11 inches and he said it's rigid." I nodded through Scorpius' words as he listed off all the traits Ollivander told him about his wand.
He was right. I sniffled, taking note of our position and where we were. We were both in the floor. I was sitting against Draco's chest, and he was holding me. I looked to my hand, a certain shade of pale, still clamped harshly against his shirt. I let go of it, watching as the abused shirt slowly unraveled itself, showing newly formed wrinkles, and watching as the color returned to my hand.
"Are you excited to make new friends at Hogwarts?" He asked.
"Ted, wait up! Come on, Bonnie. Quit dozing off!" It took a few snaps of Wendy's fingers to get Bonnie out of another one of her trances she seemed to get into so often, whether it was looking at the beautiful Black Lake near the school, or a completely blank and dull wall.
"130 centimeters- He rode a rollercoaster with Teddy."
I turned behind me, to Mordecai and Doxar, signaling them to keep quiet. Round a corner, I could see a large man with blond, buzzed hair, his arm outstretched, and two thin arms reaching down his arm, painted nails grasping weakly at his sleeve. I could only imagine he was holding a woman up against the grimy brick wall by her collar. There was another woman, who, similarly to the blond man, was clad in black robes. She was holding a wand to the other woman's throat. She had brown, ashy hair. It was long, and pinned into a neat bun. I immediately recognized the antagonistic pair.
"That's okay. That's fine." Draco told me, shifting so that my lazy leaning into him could be an actual hug. That was when I realized that a splitting headache had brought itself forward. I sighed, twitching in an attempt to soothe my itch- pushing it back.
"Right here." Ron and Hermione appeared behind me, and Ron helped ease Hermione to sit on the floor, before doing so himself. I glanced towards Draco, who stayed aside, like he does during every one of these briefings.
"Oh, okay... so why are you so... shocked now? I mean, I'm sorry but, you can hardly say it isn't obvious. We've slept together... loads of times. You definitely seem into it." He began, I cut him off.
"We're using baby tomatoes today- they don't need cutting." I finally felt the thin plastic of the salad bowl and grabbed it, handing it over to Scorpius.
"Thank you," she replied with a smile.
"Scorpius are you okay?" He nodded, breathing heavily as Harry and I were. I turned to Harry, who was frozen in a position with his legs half up, and I noticed that I was gripping the wheel tightly. I looked out the left window, and slightly behind us I noticed a red racing car, turned on,Â  stopped in the middle of the street. I took an enormous sigh of relief, muttering a 'finite' so the car could go again before the driver could get suspicious. I closed my eyes in hearing the driver turn off the car, before turning it back on and driving away with a loud roar and squeal from the tires. I swallowed to calm myself down, looking at Harry, who was sitting normally again, looking off in a daze, and Scorpius, who just sat quietly.
"Scorpius-" I reached for him, trying to hold him, to make his tears disappear as I once used to do. He flinched, rearing back as he let out a broken sob.
"Fuck," he cursed under his breath. His hand automatically clamped up as his arm tensed. I pulled away completely, sitting down normally and putting Draco to the side. I gingerly took the burning arm, rubbing back and forth gently, muttering a cooling charm. He leaned into my shoulder, allowing me to help him... or giving up in resisting my help.
"The three of you are sleeping here. Harry and I will be in the room just that way, and Ron and Hermione will be in the opposite room. No entering before knocking, we respect each other's privacy. Now, Scorpius, it's time to get ready for bed."
Or, knowing Harry, there would have been a confrontation- a fight- and who knows the disastrous and possibly deadly consequences that could have had.
"Really?!"
I got up and headed out of the room. I looked back to see Harry sitting up and stretching. It took everything in me to not stay and wait for him to stand so I could hug him.
"Is anybody else thinking of that one Harry Potter character? Malfoy's son I forgot- what was his name?" asked one girl wearing round glasses. Water poured into the vehicle, soaking my shoes, and making a believable excuse for my now tense demeanor.
From there I found myself tugging the drawer from its place, letting myself fall to the ground sitting with it in front of me. The next shirt I found was white and blue, and it wasn't put away properly. I picked it up, folding it and setting it aside on the floor.
"Wizards chess is difficult, but I can help you learn and get better," I responded. Scorpius tilted his head.
Draco unlocked the car, and helped Scorpius in, before closing the door. I got into the passenger seat, and As soon as Draco got in and turned on the car, I fiddled with the buttons to turn on the heater.
"Why didn't you wake me?"
"Stressful." I answered truthfully.
John leaned back, then hunched back forward and held his hand up in a dainty way, looking at his nails.
"Yeah, and you could take back entire bottles of Firewhiskey with no problem." He retorted.
"Do you think if we explain what a Boggart is, he'll feel better? And maybe give him sleeping draughts for the night?"
He's... just a stranger who lives in my house. But Dada is so close to him.
"Thank you Scorpius. That was an ingenious idea." I took the jar from his hands, handing it to Draco, who said he was going to put it in the dining room. Scorpius was now wearing a proud smile- proud to have thought of such a masterful idea. I scooped him up into a hug, ruffling his hair and whispering a thank you into his ear. It was slightly odd, and I didn't quite know what came over me. We'd never showed much affection towards each other anyway. His grin was now ear-splitting, no doubt from the praise. He hugged me back.
"Stop. He's not like he used to be... It's a long story." Said Hermione. I huffed as he put the wand down and stood back.
"Oh, by the way, Hermione texted me, since she knows we're in the Muggle world. She said she wants to have dinner, maybe next week?"
"Hey, It's going to be fun, you'll see. And I'm going to be with you the whole time." I said,
"I heard she had been acting... weird. Like something had been going on back there in France. Me and my family had gone there for a bit, but we left pretty soon, though that was a while ago," he stated between mouthfuls of food, abruptly stopping once he realized he was about to go on a tangent, and promptly going red in the face. I smiled and chuckled, covering my mouth, and Gabriel did the same.
I began thinking of the warmth we share when we lay together, and how his touch somehow calms me down. I thought of the intimacy I experienced with him, and no one before, just three days ago. I'd never even been with Ginny that way. I took a deep breath, before the conversation I had not an hour ago swam past my mind. It left a pain in my chest, and I ignored it.
"Yeah. I swear it seems they have nothing better to do." I angrily stabbed a carrot on my plate and sticking it in my mouth- my food had gone unappetizingly cold.
Harry sniffled, moving one of his hands to violently rub at his nose before he answered me. "But the assignment-"
There was no answer, as had been the trend lately. Scorpius kept his face away, completely ignoring me.
"Scorpius, I'll go read with you in a bit, I need to talk to Harry." I felt his prying hand on my shoulder with a gaze so intense it burnt through his grey eyes into what should be my own eyes.
"Why stare at it, though?"
James Sirius. That's his name. I don't know why I agreed to name him without a second thought. And I don't know why it took almost no time for me to think of the name. It's almost as if some hidden crevice in the back of my brain was ready if the occasion occurred where Ginny and I had a child. But this isn't our child, is it? It was a child that came of a horrible circumstance. One that I was responsible for. This child wouldn't have a father unless I stepped up for it. And I understand the pain of not having a father figure.
"I don't want to go home tonight."
All I could do was quietly listen to her speak.
"Well, come on and introduce me," I responded with a smile, hopefully shaving off a little bit of the tension between Scorpius and Draco. It was making me uncomfortable.
"No- Yes! She's perfectly fine, ma'am. She's giving birth," I explained.
Just... don't push us away anymore, Harry."
"Call for me if you need anything. I'm going to see about that potion. Okay?"
The mass of ugly thoughts slowly got smaller, enough that I could hold it in my hand.
"We aren't bad people, right?" He asked curiously.
"I could have sworn I saw
The projectors shot up as the band stopped playing. The three champions proceeded into the maze, sprinting in right away. The Hogwarts champion slowed her speed down and took slow, cautious steps as she went on, while the Durmstrang champion walked forward with heavy footsteps. The Beauxbatons champion kept charging forward at top speed.
"A private room reserved under the name Granger?"
bookstore? There has to be something more... There has too..."
I'm a horrible friend...
âHarry POVâ
hours later, and I took to sitting on my roof, listening to choral music. I told Draco I'd needed to blow off steam after sending the owl and he didn't protest to it. I've been up here for quite a while, but the music accompanied by a view of the multicolored sky and setting sun simulated a sort of escape from my reality. I felt at peace, yet, in a sort of disconnected and lost way. I took a deep breath as I continued to let my distraction engulf me.
"You have a cool name. I like you."
is going to have to come to
"Yes. Always."
"Does that mean you know?" He shook his head, fully laughing now.
"Hi Hermione," He responded, running towards her excitedly and taking his place at the table. "Where's Rose?"
I thought stubbornly.
"It's complicated," he responded. H- Potter glanced at me as though assessing if I'd make a dangerous move. I stayed put, making as much of a display of innocence as I could.
I don't know what happened next. But Aminata was on the floor again, but she was different. Her eyes were held nothing but fear, her had held the side of her face. She scuttled backwards before sprinting out of the room, almost falling on the way out.
"Oh my goodness it's freezing outside and you're in just a long sleeve shirt!" She said, hurrying to get the blanket from the couch.
Despite my tears, I smiled. He walked over to where I was sitting, bringing his thumb to my cheeks. "You know, tear tracks on your face aren't quite my favorite thing," he said, voice soft. I chuckled.
"Don't do this." I felt tears welling up in my eyes, crawling down my face. I didn't wipe them off.
You need to tell him about the war."
you read the books?"
"I'm so stupid." I muttered, head in my hands.
"I-I'm sorry, I-"
"You don't have to, Harry. It's alright." He slowly removed his hand from mine, using it to pull up his left sleeve. I did my best to heal it fully, really I did. But I'm not a healer, and I really only knew this because of Astoria, and it was something I hadn't practiced, but at least it stopped from further damage coming to Harry. The area surrounding his wound was bright red and inflamed. The cut itself had, for the most part, become a scar with raised, red, and tender skin over it. I remembered watching it scab over when I'd healed him, and now, I was proud to have at least sped up the process, and helped.
"I n-need it. I need the friction to distract me." I knew that it would hurt him. I switched gears, aiming to relax him before anything else.
Silence. Everyone in the crowd was silent as well, waiting for which cunning beast would come out of the cave.
"...That is a possibility."
. A sigh escaped my lips. "It was... the bathroom... sixth year... I don't really talk about it." I admitted.
Dr. Gilroy was right, my primary love language was a tie between physical touch and words of affirmation. Draco's was quality time, with physical touch and gift giving as close seconds.
"Hey, what's going on?" I heard Harry's voice come around the corner.
I woke to somebody gently shaking me. That somebody being Ginny.
"No really, I was. Even
I shook the thought away, getting a small piece of Yuca and eating it. It was, incredibly different, from anything I'd ever had.
Riddle." I tore the paper in frustration and defeat, casting it into the fireplace.
Soon enough, he let go of the hug.

âDraco POVâ
"You get used to it." Commented Carlito. He then put an oven mit on as well, and they each grabbed opposite sides of the tray on top of the box before lifting it, and moving it aside.
Scorpius' eyes were wide and watery as he took in what we'd said. I wiped a stray tear from his cheek. He took a few shaky breaths, steadying himself.
I walked to the door and through the hallway, feeling every single one of my barefoot steps before I reached the bedroom door in full. I took a deep breath, raising my balled fist to knock.
"You're going the wrong way. I saw a pub just behind us."
Enjoy!!
"Sod off, Malfoy."
I put her letter down, deciding I would write a response at another time. Ginny is coming home. I burst out the room, knowing I'd need to tidy our bed before she got here. However the bed was already made. No doubt by Draco. I went downstairs to the kitchen and everything seemed untouched though I know that wasn't the case.
"Good morning." I said softly. Keeping an expressionless face.
After an hour of tossing and turning, I decided
"Well, forgive me, but the books talk about you and Ginny Weasley," I flinched slightly at that. "And you married..." He pointed at Draco "Forgive me, I don't remember...?"
"Thank you."
Going through the sliding glass door, the first thing I noticed was children who ran past, laughing and playing.
"Yes. I'll be in the room." I got up and left Ginny and Teddy at the table.
He blinked a couple of times, moving to hug me again, as we were before he'd begun talking. I allowed him to nuzzle into the crook of my neck, bringing my own arms around him as well. He sighed.
The urinals were empty. I peered under the stalls, and saw a small pair of feet within one of them. After hearing the sound of a zipper and the sound of the toilet flushing, I backed into an empty stall, hiding. The man opened the door, clearing his throat. I watched as two feet dragged each other over to the sinks. The water began running. My heartbeat was in my throat. I soundlessly opened my door, and looked out.
"Well how does that sound! Would you like to make some new friends?" I asked him. His eyes were beaming with excitement.
"I know, Malfoy. I had to learn about all of that to get a healing job in the Muggle World." She said, keeping her gaze down and away from me. I put my head down. For probably the first time, the only person in the room who knows less than me is Weasley. It felt odd knowing that his sister knew more about this stuff than I did. Hermione, I was used to. Father would always bother me about having worse marks than a Mudblood...
I reminded myself.
"Yes, there is- with magic. You will learn about it in school. But can I ask you why your biggest fear right now... is me dying? Do you think about that a lot?" He nodded somberly.
"We're leaving now."
"3 months!" He said excitedly, his eyes lit up.
"Actually, yeah... Luca and I are staying in bowling this year."
"Well? Draco? What was it that got you like that?"
"What the hell is your problem?!" Draco snapped.
"Oh, I guess... well, there should be another large blanket up there too. It's blue." He pointed to the top shelf again, and with a nod I went back over to it, reaching up and feeling around for the blue blanket.
dealt with him when he consistently refuses to take his medicine and just stays in bed unmoving, day after day. I had almost forgotten what it was like to wake up every night to calm him down after a particularly frightening nightmare, or one he thought was real. He still kept his wand on him- really next to him, always in his line of sight. "Just in case," he always says. It breaks my heart, seeing the star he's in, feeling like I can't help him.
"If you must know, Astoria passed during childbirth eight years ago." Draco stated, clipping his voice.
"What're you doing?" He asked curiously, noticing the Owl in the room.
"I felt the guilt wash over me like-new." He croaked. "For a second, I was back in the room, pleading for someone to help... you took my hand."
I was laying down, and there was noise... voices, speaking hushed and muffled by the fog in my brain. Slowly, I opened my eyes, blinking rapidly as the bright daylight reached them, making the thump in my head even more prominent. The voices stopped, and soon I felt something on my hand.
"Hello Teddy, and Teddy's friend," Ron answered while fixing Rose's jacket for her.
have. You have to enjoy when it gets good because it's always going to go away. But it always comes back, too." I looked at Draco, unsure of what to say or how to feel about what he told me.
"Oh, uhm. He could have sworn that meant it was back, and that he was being summoned, but it just... never happened. The pain went away after, I don't know, a half hour? and he wouldn't stop staring at it, convinced that the mark was back and that he just couldn't
"No, no. I don't dance." I said with an awkward smile.
"Forget it." He said to us both. "I practically don't play anymore. Anyways, We're at the car now, let's go home."
I thought as I stared at the ceiling, willing my eyes to stay open, feeling weak and floating in and out of life. The ringing in my ears still had not subsided, and closing my eyes felt a lot better than trying to watch my skewed vision readjust itself. So, I closed my eyes, taking in a deep breath.
"Let it out; it's alright... there was nothing to forgive, Harry. You went there because you wanted to save him. You were being manipulated and that's not your fault. It's not your fault, Harry. He protected you because he wanted to. You did nothing to him. You did not cause his death, Harry. It's not your fault."
"I'll be quick," he assured. "And then we can talk. Okay?"
"I needed to do it... It was like I was forcing myself to commit suicide." His breath caught in his throat, and he shut his eyes. I went over to him, unsure if he would want a hug, but ultimately going for it.
Maybe she would have known if Voldemort was still alive.
"I never knew my parents... they died when I was one year old." I sucked in a quick breath, sitting tentatively on the edge of the bed. He didn't stop me, or start screaming, so I think I'm doing alright so far. "The people I lived with weren't very nice, so I really didn't have anyone- well, at least not until I made friends at Hogwarts, but that's a different story." I said, shaking my head to stay on topic. "My best friend- you've met him- Rose's dad, Ron. His mother was quick to take me in and treat me as her own. And she already had seven other children to watch over." I said with wide eyes and a fond chuckle.
It was no more than a half hour later that we found ourselves at the front of the queue for this ride, being asked to choose between a red and blue rollercoaster.
"I'm not hungry." I told him sternly, before calming down a bit. "Leave me for the night, please."
I lazily mumbled in agreement before the lights were turned off.
"The books were part of their plan," I told him quietly. "Their plan must have something to do with Muggles."
"These movies, what are they called?"
"You're not being careful, Scorpius." I brought his hands down to the sink. "Drop the knife."
"Harry you... you really did take a hard fall back there. You should rest for the remainder of the day."
"Dada, Dada, Dada I wanna go that way!" Scorpius kept tugging on Draco's arm, pointing towards many superhero characters. "It looks fun!"
"Of course. It was nice. To think things between us all might improve."
"No you're not. That shirt looks like you washed it in a bucket, and then dried it by hitting it over a rock. Repeatedly. Did you even
"You like him. You're losing your affections for Ginny."
"I'm sorry. I'm fine. I'll try to do better." A wave of anger came over me and I quickly stifled it.
"That's because they're my favorite," I explained with a smile.
I left the room when the thought came to me:
." He spat
"It's okay, just work through what you want to say in your head before speaking out loud. That way you won't get stuck. My hand began to pass through his hair. I really just loved the way his soft hair fell between my fingers.
A gasp "-no!"
"I'm getting ready to cook dinner. Would you like to do that with me?" I asked confidently.
"Harry Potter... Draco..."
"No!" He reached forward and I stepped back. "Harry it's not safe, you cannot leave the house-"
Let me know what y'all think, and as always...
"Believe me, I'm as confused as you are. I don't think even Harry understands what's happening... he looks like he's just floating through life."
"I'll get it." I said, going to open the door.
"Come on, your son is waiting."
"Me? A prat? I hardly think that's accurate," he said, planting a quick kiss on my nose. We quickly took to holding each other tightly. I was letting myself get lost in the feeling of getting to hold him.
"Harry, that's not funny." Hermione commented shyly. I looked at her and noticed the worried expression she bore. "Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Of course." I said, going in for a brotherly hug, before giving a similar one to Hermione.
"You were doing what you needed to survive." I reassured, suddenly feeling like I understood, yet feeling at the same time that I would never understand.Â  I felt him shaking his head against me.
"To be honest I'd rather skip straight to dinner with the Weasley's," I replied, remembering when Hermione and Ron told us that 'it would be the best present for Molly to see you under happier circumstances.'
"Why have you been sad?" He skipped over to the bed, plopping down in front of me and crossing his legs. "Was it because of your eye?"
"Good, because you'll find out what disaster I created now."
in Azkaban for something like that."
"Yes, well..." I paused for a second, thoughts racing, pushing me to think quickly. "...Right now, he has Transfiguration, and Astronomy is his next class."
"I wonder what amazing, absolutely impeccable human being recommended that." A mischievous glint could be seen in my eyes when he said that.
"Who's that?" He asked curiously before seeing him trailing behind me. "Oh! Okay." He turned back to where he was sitting.
Enjoy!
"We're late for class!" We exclaimed in unison. I hastily gathered all of my things and ran.
"You haven't been giving him loads of chocolate while I was asleep right?" I said half jokingly. Harry shook his head. I looked outside, noticing the setting sun.
I turned to him as we began down the stairs. "What did you have?"
I shut my eyes tight to avoid the written contents of the parchment. I thought I could read this but I can't. I already know what it's going to be about:
"Me too."
"Yeah." I responded, not entirely wanting to leave Luca like this.
"Go take care of Teddy, alright? I'll see you on Saturday for their play date."
My head hurts, and everything feels heavy. The sunlight bleeding into the room made me want to keep my eyes shut, but I turned to face Draco anyway, and gave him my best 'fuck you' face, before turning back around, wanting to fall back to sleep, and wanting to stop feeling everything around me, but in an unbothered sort of way.
"Warner Brothers" She squeaked quickly.
Draco got closer to me in a concerned rush.
"You already do so much-" he put the plate in my hands and stared into my eyes.
"My friend is missing and I need to know if he turned up here. You are going to show me the record of people who have checked in within the last 24 hours. Understood?" His eyes were fear stricken.
"Teddy... Teddy!"
"Duly noted." I felt our silence twist. It was no longer comfortable.
"Hey, how's James?"
"Anytime." I replied. He shifted, turning and letting go of the hug so he could be at eye-level with me.
"Why of course I know that. You're my grandson."
...I love you, Scorpius. Please remember that."
"No Scorpius, you are not cutting the tomatoes. Just go ahead and stir the pot for me."
?" I nodded, wanting only to disappear from the spot.
The weak, pulsing feeling that was in my bones, that I'd been feeling since I woke up last night, had spread to the veins in my neck, making static ring through my ears and making my brain feel fuzzy.
"Tio Pito, this is Draco, and this is... Harry. Yes." Then she turned to Harry.
It hurts to see you in pain, Harry. Please, you cannot be afraid to talk to me. Be afraid of anything else, just not that. I hate not knowing if you're okay, Harry."
"Next time, then. Don't beat yourself up over it."
"Remembering everything makes you depressed again," Teddy finished. I blinked several times. "You don't need to explain it to me like I'm seven. You take medicine because of the memories that make you depressed."
As soon as Teddy left, I made my way upstairs, mumbling Draco's name to gesture for him to follow.
Overall, this trip felt necessary for multiple reasons. Aside from all of the Ministry bullshite that we had to investigate, it was fun, and it was very different from anything any of us had ever done. We all got closer as a unit, and I learned that Ron's snoring is equivalent to the rumbling approach of a steam engine.
"Hey," I looked up at him, feeling my eyes water. "You did it! You were right, he has changed. Nothing happened." He said with a smile. All at once, the last two hours hit me like a tidal wave. I let out a sob.
After the Sorting Hat seemingly came to life, it sang a song that explained the sorting ceremony, and that all you need to do is put the hat on.
The dark room became pin-drop silent. The only thing that could be heard was Draco's heavy breathing.
"Uhm. Why are you awake?" I asked, leaving the topic.
"Episky... See? Nothing to worry about! You're as fit as a fiddle. Now go on."
"Draco? Are you ok?" I heard Harry ask. I opened my eyes, taking a deep breath in, before closing them again, and nodding shakily. I moved my hand from his arm, to his hand, lacing our fingers together. And sniffled slightly, as a few more tears fell down. I squeezed his hand, allowing myself to keep my breaths calm, even if they did shake, just like my body wanted to do right now.
"Let's dance." I whispered excitedly.
"That's it, again, one more deep breath. You're okay." I blinked rapidly, taking another deep, shaking breath. Lip quivering.
"Not in the least. You have no idea how brave it was of you to do this, Harry. It takes a special type of nerve, really."
"I'm not going in-"
"Next time?" He said hopefully.
"After many, many failures," she countered with a gentle laugh. Then, she turned back to my son. "How old are you?"
I furrowed my brows. "You really think that two people going missing is such a cause for concern?" I asked incredulously.
"I-" I shifted nervously in my spot. "Can you get Uncle Harry?" He nodded.
âDraco POVâ
"Yeah, Harry."
â2 Days laterâ
During the interview with the hospital's psychologist, their psychiatrist, what they called a case worker, a doctor, and a nurse, Harry had been probed with what even I would have considered invasive questions that could no doubt slip someone such as Harry back into a harmful mindset. Harry had clarified that no, this was not a deliberate attempt at suicide. And when asked if, given a blade, he would do it again, he hesitated. But of course, it's not like people would readily give him a blade, but then again, I guess being handed a blade is akin to being in the kitchen, eyeing the paring knife. They asked again: if he were let go, would he actively try to find a way to hurt himself? He said no. They asked if he had any plans for suicide, such as a planned date, or chosen method. Again, he said no.
Maybe she could care less since she got the opportunity she wanted: to write a good story that would captivate people.
Harry is really about to spit some straight facts right now. But he's also going to have to deal with the consequences of accepting the investigation and take those first steps.
I pushed the thought violently towards the back of my brain, remembering what happened with Draco only two hours before. Besides, right now I need to focus on Hermione. Speaking of Hermione, I looked back up at her, suddenly realizing my downward gaze, and tears were spilling from her eyes as she waited for me to continue speaking. I glanced towards Draco, who was stood aside with Ron. I took a breath.
"Do... do you want me to tell her?"
At least, neither of us had spoken until Harry said what he'd just said.
"Nothing." I said, a bit too quickly. The back of my head began to deliver a dull pain and I realized at one point I must've hit it against the wall. My mind was racing.
"What? No way! Oh, my, God. Wait, what's your favorite-"
"Hey, relax, breathe, in... out... Think about what you're saying, then tell me." I stopped and looked at him, feeling scared. I took a quick breath, then tried to talk again.
"Of course. The oven will beep when it's time to take out the chicken." I replied. He started running to his room. I dried my hands And wentÂ  to my room, where I saw Harry sleeping soundly, I went over and laid down next to him.
It sounds stupid. I crumpled up the parchment, tossing it to the side with the other lost attempts, and put my head in my hands.
But that seemed impossible through my wincing. Soon, that wincing became huffing, and that huffing became strained breaths, and the pain spread through my entire body. I felt my face contorting and an unwelcome lump form in my throat, one that I had been dreading and might as well have filled me with more fear than the physical pain itself.
He passed his free hand through my hair, comforting me. I loved it.
"I'm not sure I agree with that." He said.
We were getting back in the car when a question popped into my head. I decided now's as good a time as ever to ask.
Harry grabbed two paper towels and dried his hands before throwing them into the trash.
I placed my hands on either side of the countertop surrounding the stove, taking deep and controlled breaths, forcing myself to calm down, to let go of the tension in my shoulders. I won't be able to avoid his questions for long.
"Does dad's arm hurt every night?" I turned to look at him, blinking. His expression was scrunched up, as though serious and concerned all the same.
"It wasn't a disaster..." I said after a while, breaking the silence.
"What if... the war... what if it never really ended?" He gently removed himself from my hold, shifting in his spot to look at me. I laid on my back, ready for him to rest his head on me if he wished. "What if that last battle was just another battle? What if it never ended?"
"Okay, good... you know I love you, right?"
"Harry, it is always a good thing that you're here... How long have you been having these thoughts?" I asked, in disbelief that he would so casually think in such a way- concerned for what could be hiding beneath his words.
"I've done... horrible things in life." He swallowed.
"It's that obvious? I was trying to keep to myself." I shook my head. "That's not the point. Can I talk to Scorpius? That way he can choose if he wants to go home?" I asked, knowing she'd understand.
On the third day, he spoke. I asked him if he was okay with talking about it, but he said no. I reluctantly allowed him to continue on. I did discover though, that he hadn't taken his medicine in more than a few weeks. After scolding him for that, I went to his house and got his medicine, insisting he takes it every morning. It was quite the surprise to me when this made him start feeling worse mentally. He woke from nightmares several times through the night, and I woke up with him to help get him back to sleep. He also seemed even less motivated to do anything, as if that were a thing. After doing research I realized that restarting on a medication can make things worse for a little while. I also read that it's not uncommon for someone to fall into a depression after a failed attempt at suicide. To be honest: I'd prefer him depressed rather than dead, but the ideal situation involves him not being so depressed.
Both of us backed down immediately, looking at Ron, who was absolutely correct. I took a breath, holding Scorpius' hand.
"But-"
"Mr Matt Frazier? Teddy's tutor that comes here 5 times a week!"
"Well,
"I pass. Harry, your turn." I said. Harry looked down at his last Domino. If he puts it down, he wins the game, but, he passed as well, meaning he can't make the move, and returned his attention to the sky.
"Just keep reading." He mumbled. Then again. "Haven't you read that before?"
," he bit, voice wavering in panic. But I persisted.
I snorted. "Maybe? The man looks like a bloody peacock."
"So, you have several people at home who would like to see you, including Teddy... would you like to go home now, or do you want to do something, just you and me, before we go home to them?"
"Because I am!" I yelled, frustrated and in denial. Turning on my heel, I marched out of the door to the study, slamming it hard, and climbing down stairs, pointedly ignoring the cupboard that was now used to store our brooms, ignoring anything that might make me think about anything else.
He suddenly walked off, leaving me and Wendy near the table. I exhaled sharply and got my things.
He didn't react at first, then he spoke.
"He's lied to me," Scorpius said, his voice dropping several decibels, almost to the point where I couldn't hear him. "And he's hurt people."
Harry walked in in a towel. as much as my mind wanted to admire, I couldn't. Not only is he married, but there were scars along his back and torso as well. Except these didn't look self inflicted. They looked deep and old. I sat in thought. Just how little did I know about him? How could he have more than just his lightning bolt scar? My mind left the subject when he had a shirt on. He looked at me as if to silently ask me to turn away. I did.
"Why?" He asked in disbelief. I sighed, knowing I'd have to elaborate at least a little bit.
Please let me know what y'all think of the story so far... we're in the home stretch for this one, folks! And, as always...
Idk why I have a soft spot for this chapter. I just really like the whole idea of Draco and Ginny interacting
"Keep your voice down. Finish packing the bag, and call Harry. I'll be in the car with Ginny."
"Please. Please I deserve it, I just need to make everything stop please." Soon enough I couldn't hold my tears back any longer. My futile attempts at fighting grew weaker.
"Cant you not destroy a priceless musical instrument?! Thank you-"
"Watch it, Malfoy. She's still my sister." He ignored me, which made me more upset.
"Let's sit. Tell me about it, yeah?" I guided us to the floor, sitting down on the grass. Harry sat down between my legs, leaning into me; his hand was idly playing with the grass below him. "I thought Bellatrix killed him... it was all over the prophet when it happened," I commented, putting my arms to rest around his waist.
"I figured. That's why I brought you that small something, just so your stomach isn't entirely empty." I nodded gratefully.
"Teddy. Does your uncle Harry take medicine?"
"I don't know how to use the shower here."
My son doesn't deserve the weight his name has."
I hugged him. I don't know what came over me. But he grabbed me and returned my hug. I grabbed him, fearing that if I let go, he would be gone forever. I sniffled as I felt the tears run down my face.
"Hello! I'm freezing out here!" Scorpius' voice rang through our little bubble, and I glanced over to find him clutching his arms, looking as angry as a ten year old could look. He was only slightly wet, having sought shelter as soon as it began to pour, unlike me and Harry, who were positively soaked. A chuckle escaped me.
"It's a long story, Ted. Don't worry about it, though. As I've told Draco," he turned over to him dramatically, but Draco wasn't looking. Harry turned back to me. "With a little bit of time, everything will be fine again." Harry said it as though he wasn't only telling me that, but Draco too. "Don't you agree, Teddy?"
The line hung up.
I don't remember her saying that it was rape, that it was her fault for being out late at night, that she should have brought her wand. That she should have fought harder. Hysterical, telling me she doesn't know what to do. That she's never been so terrified. I'd heard her cry for the first time ever that night, over the phone. I don't know why, but I wanted nothing but the ability to comfort her at that moment.
Making my way to the coffee table where my wand sat, I grabbed it, using a simple spell to move the coffee table over quietly. My cold feet landed on the rug, and I stood there for a second, closing my eyes.
I looked at the time and realized I'd been out of the house for a little over an hour. I had to get back to Scorpius. I got up slowly. My eyes still haven't left him. He's obviously more calm now, but still frustrated.
"It's alright. We're here now, aren't we?" I said in a futile attempt to reassure him. "Everything is okay now."
"It... it's nothing really-"
"What are you going to do about your medication?" I asked curiously while turning opposite him to change.
"We were eating dinner at the Leaky Cauldron, and it just... happened. He- well it was weird. And I kept asking him if he was okay of if we needed to get help and he said 'look at me, I'm fine. Everything is okay.' But he didn't look okay, not really."
," he swallowed, "they weren't mistakes! You hurt people." His voice quieted at the end. I felt a lump at the back of my throat and tears blurring my eyes.
and you're worried about Rose?" Molly stepped aside to reveal Teddy, complete with teal hair and a smug grin. Scorpius' eyes promptly popped out of his head and he ran at Teddy, who opened his arms as the took each other for a brotherly hug, smiling from ear to ear.
"Maybe that's why we got a private room," I countered with a cold stare. "Please, lead us to our friends."
"We have all of the strongest protection spells and wards up, Harry, and we've recently made the house unplottable. Staying here won't make a difference."
I glanced towards Draco, then back to the parchment.
"He won't. I'll be there. Besides, if he really wanted to do something to you, he would have carted you off to Azkaban as soon as the wa-" Harry clamped his own mouth shut, staring at me. Scorpius stared at us with squinted suspicious eyes. I turned to him, a firm gaze, daring him to ask any questions. For a second, Harry vanished from my perception as I locked myself into a staring contest with Scorpius. A challenge which Scorpius, if he knew what was good for him, would lose.
"Let's remember that here, we can be open with each other without judgement. We're here to work through our struggles and heal." She candidly explained. I looked her in the eye, silent, save the fully rapid tapping of my foot. She sighed, readjusting her position in her rolling chair. I looked down.
On the kitchen counter was a freshly cooked dinner- beautifully roasted chicken breast, potato wedges, and steamed vegetables- and a parchment beside it, that held, in scrawny handwriting, a brief note:
When we were all in our boats, The man started to move them with magic. I watched the water as the boats glided across the perfectly still lake, and I could have sworn I saw something enormous moving, lurking in the depths of the body of water. I looked up, ready to make a remark about the mysterious movement, but was stopped by the look on my new friends faces.
"Harry-"
"I think it might be better if you lot leave." I began explaining with a sigh. "He's not feeling well... again." I looked up at Ron and Hermione as they stood from their seats at the table.
"I hate to ruin this touching moment, but I have two ice cream cones that are melting and I have absolutely no doubt that Scorpius and I can eat it for you." Teddy and I let go of our hug to see Draco and Scorpius. "Scor, you can go ahead and take Teddy to the room, bond over ice cream flavors, why not?" Scorpius walked over to Teddy.
"The kid?!"
Suddenly, his determined expression was centimeters from me and both of his hands were gripping my shoulders harshly.
Draco, with a curious look on his face, said "I'll get it." before disappearing towards the front door. I heard a distant "Hello M-" followed by the loud voice of seemingly an old woman, cutting him off with "Move. I smell something wrong."
I tossed the tomato slices into the bowl of salad that was prepared, then reached toward the cabinet for 3 bowls to put the soup we made.
We slid into the bed beside each other, and it was... odd. Turning to look a him, I studied his features. he was devoid of all energy, and looked almost sickly. It scared be a bit too much.
...The lesson finished before I even noticed. I had raised my hand and answered questions as if it was by mere muscle memory.
"Where on earth did you fit that monstrous thing?" I exclaimed, to which he simply stated:
"Please stop it." I told him, my emotions switching to that of a desperate person. "You really don't deserve the pain you put yourself through." His head was faced down.
Each step up became louder against the wood floor and soon enough they became numb to my ears.
I went to my room, grabbing my wand silently, and then came down the hall, kneeling down onto the floor. I used my hands to perform wordless magic, and surely, a trapdoor made itself appear beneath me. I opened it up, climbing down the ladder into my basement.
"It's okay. You're super strong, no monsters can get you." I said, returning the hug. His nightmares have always been ones of fantasy. Monsters chasing him, usually.
"You know, I could say the same for you. You are, truly, spectacular." I shoved him playfully, flushing.
"Teddy, You know I love you right? With every fiber of my being." He nodded.
She drew in a breath. "Well, Harry, I think you should give him his wand back," she said eyeing my wand that Harry still held. "And we must get going. It's late."
"Maybe." He said. I put the bacon in its place before going towards him with a hug; he reciprocated it before granting me a kiss.
"Together."
"I still wake up sometimes thinking he's here. I end up having to feel the pain of his death all over again, like it's brand new." I tore my eyes from the sleeve I was fiddling with, up to George, who was sitting next to me, cross-legged, and staring at the quilted pattern of his bedsheets, just like I had been only seconds ago. I couldn't help but feel guilty about Fred, after all, he'd died protecting me, fighting for me, fighting because of me.
, but I only sat there dumbly, sobbing and struggling to breathe and feeling my heart clench, because I miss him. I miss him, and I hate that I was the one who led to his death, and that I couldn't just,
"Well it's not T-shirts and jeans either, so what is it then? That man is in a button down shirt, and slacks. His wife and their daughter are both wearing dresses. What do you call that?"
"You all go to the parks without me. Islands of Adventure. Talk to people. Ask about their opinions."
"I don't hate you either. And I care about you quite a lot."
"Okay, that was eleven years ago, and if I remember clearly, he's been cleared of all Death Eater-related charges, on account of him and his mother saving my life multiple times-"
It's been what feels like an eternity since I last saw Harry. I couldn't stop thinking about him or how I found him. I wonder what conversation we would have had if he was awake.
"Harry. M-Draco has agreed to have dinner with everyone. I know it's last minute, but it'll be fine I suppose, I'll make an extra 2 servings." Whatever it is that Ginny's said from downstairs didn't register to me. Just that she spoke.
"Dada isn't going to eat with us?" He asked slowly.
"No, it is not. We aren't discussing this again." I said, handing him the garment.
"I see, well how about I give you some tips before nothing turns into something. Have you ever heard of grounding techniques?"
"Didn't you listen? Let go." My voice was low and rumbling. Vernon retreated to his seat across the table, intimidated.
"I'm sorry that's happening. I do hope things get better soon."
"What happened, Harry?" No response.
"George's shop, actually. But we agreed it's best I don't start until I secure everything here at home." After his response, the table went quiet, and I realized then that we'd never really become friends enough to keep a conversation going.
âHarry POVâ
"You don't believe that." He replied, leaving me in a sort of silence as we laid staring at each other.
I whipped forward, looking at Scorpius, who had his hands at his hips and a victorious expression. I bowed my head in defeat, placing my hands on the countertop. We all laughed outright.
"Please, please... just talk to me. Don't do this to yourself." I heard him whisper. "Don't do this to me." I cried harder. I swear I don't mean to hurt anyone but myself. I don't mean to hurt Draco... But here he is, crying because of me- again.
We arrived at the platforms, Professor Longbottom guiding us off the boats, muttering words of how he helped a champion, along with a few wistful sighs. We were in the bottom section of the platform, so many were looking over the edge to see what went on. The three of us were quietly looking over the edge, our hands on the guard rail.
âHarry POVâ
"No please don't worry about that." I replied, we looked at each other in the eyes.
"Harry..." The voice was Hermione's. "You don't... you don't really think that, that you don't matter... do you?" My ears started ringing.
"No. He's at home finishing school work." His face wasn't as excited anymore. "How has your day been?" I asked, to make sure he was okay.
"It's really quite late, isn't it. Let's go to bed." He shifted some more, as though to get up- and making me slide down a little more-, but with a slight tug of his shirt from me, he eased back down.
âHarry POVâ
Uncle Vernon dropped me. My elbow stung with the aftermath of a blow to the jaw.
"It's alright. I don't mind at all. I do care about you, and you really shouldn't have had to listen to that argument.."
"Well, you looked like you were handling it," he answered.
"Harry, Kingsley is training me."
"Do you feel that? It's okay, just focus on my heart, focus on my breathing, try to match me."
"Please... stop talking. Just stop. Stop please... I can't..." He slouched and looked down towards his lap as if he wanted to become a ball and his hands gripped his head. His eyes screwed shut.
Draco jumped in with a retaliation on the tip of his tongue: "But didn't you say at the hospital last week that you were quitting? Just do it. What's the worst that happens, you get sacked? You've already put in your two weeks notice-"
He left the room with the door open, and so took the opportunity to turn around and look at Harry. He seemed as though he was sleeping peacefully, and Merlin knows he needs the sleep. I removed my arm from over him and rolled out of bed; everything felt heavy.
"N-no! Not at all, it's not like th-" he sighed, looking around, and I could see he was shaking slightly. I stayed put, raising a single eyebrow.
"I know... I'm nervous about it myself," I began to explain. "But, I-I just... was wondering. I mean, last time, he wasn't... that bad. He seems to want to get to know me without combining his fist with my stomach." I let out a rueful laugh.
"Aurors Weasley, Berrycloth and Williamson; don't move." I boomed. Thorfinn let go of the woman, who gulped down a large breath as she collapsed down to the floor, her white curls bouncing. She scrambled to her feet coming towards me.
"I need you to breathe with me. Follow my breaths as I count." I saw a flash of white blond settle by me; my stomach gave an awful lurch.
Time stilled for the briefest of moments, and goosebumps ran across me. As many times as we had shared our affections before, there was something about now, that made it feel different. maybe it was the chill of the wind or the sound of the rain, drowning out all of our surroundings. My hand travelled up into his hair, now matted down by the cold rain, and I felt his hand move up to do similarly to my own wet hair.
Then I remembered that one time I caught them snogging and
"We weren't sucking face." Replied Harry. It was an innocent kiss."
I smiled at him warmly. "Go ahead. "
"Y'know, your scarf is barely even there... I could have grandmum sew something for you!" Victorie suggested, leaning close to me and looking up at me with eager yet relaxed eyes.
âDraco POVâ
"Luca."
"H-Scorpius... look. Teddy is here for a visit." I said, aiming my words to the living room.
"Anytime, Harry."
"It's nothing important, besides, it's you and Scorpius we need to worry about." He mumbled stubbornly. "Besides, you already know. It's just me being stupid and self-critical."
"So, anyway, maybe just, give dad just a little bit of, space? I mean, just a little bit, you know, let him use the bathroom alone and, sleep in his own bed most nights... you know? Just like, just a little bit just, some space to breathe." I immediately became frantic. "A-and don't think it's just you!" I calmed down. "I need to do that too. You know, maybe we could, do more things together, while Draco does a little bit of his own thing... maybe."
are being so calm! He's a bloody death eater! And based on his recent behavior it seems he didn't change as much as we thought he did!"
I twitched, my breathing becoming heavier.
"I know what it's like- to think that hurting yourself will get rid of whatever you're feeling... I also know it doesn't help- not in the long run." He whispered softly.
"Better be on your feet, Silver Arrows! A goal has just been scored by the Shooting Stars! They gain ten points, and the Silver Arrows stay at zero points!"
"What did you do?" I asked, eager to see a solution to what was happening.
"It doesn't matter. It's fine, it's-"
he specified.
"but I also think you take care of him, in a way. I absolutely know that, ever since you were born, you have given him nothing but happiness. I can tell that every time I look at you smile at each other after you solve a jigsaw puzzle, or when you cry in his arms because you had another nightmare."
"I-I'm sorry." I told her, my anger settling
It's odd to know from personal experience that vertical cuts bleed more than horizontal cuts. I stared at my arms, noting that the most prominent scar on my arm wasn't even one I gave myself. It was one that Voldemort gave to me- no, Pettigrew- during the Triwizard tournament. Speaking of Pettigrew, I accidentally spilled a drop of blood onto his face on a photo that was sitting on my lap as I sat on the bed. Fitting, if you ask me. Now, I gave myself what was probably going to morph into an identical scar on the other arm. Even with the sting of the blade against my arm and color springing to my raw, open skin, I didn't feel like I'd gotten what I deserved. After all, Voldemort killed. He killed, and that alone justified why he needed to die. Have I not killed too? If a killer deserves death, I can't worm my way out of my own fate. I shouldn't have shifted blame. I caused Sirius to die.
"Harry, it's me. Good morning." What startled me was that instead of uncovering himself slowly, he basically jumped, bolting upright and staring at me wide-eyed. I stepped backwards, slightly startled by his outburst.
"Hermione, it's late. Please. Let's go to sleep okay? Maybe we can Owl Harry, or visit him and talk. Just us, or just you. Whatever you prefer."
Harry and I both sighed in realization. It was only Ron and Hermione. Harry shakily set his wand back down, fuming. I got up and opened the door before him, meeting Ron and Hermione's worried expressions.
"What do you mean?" I swallowed thickly, trying to rid myself of the tremor I'd developed.
"I want to hurt myself. I want to stop feeling. I want to go numb." I told him, my voice cracked.
Anger turned into panic, turned into frustration, turned into guilt. All I could do was fight myself to stay calm. A fight I ultimately failed.
"Expelliarmus!" My wand flew from my hand. "Diffindo!"
"Woah! That's cool! Look, I have toys to play with!" Said Scorpius.
"Maria? What did she do? What happened to her?" Asked an absolutely frantic Scorpius, who was, quite understandably, scared out of his wits as Ron held him almost protectively by the shoulders, and Draco was, well, still in a full body bind, laying on the floor where Auror Berrycloth had so carelessly put him. If it weren't for the constant spinning of my head and hiding my now more-than-common shaking, I would have started a fight with him on the spot. I looked over at Auror Williamson, who still had both mine, and Draco's wands in his hand, standing proudly in his spot. I wanted to wipe the look on his face clean-off, but I could barely even handle the excruciatingly nauseating Floo trip we took over here.
"Oh, well," Dad cleared his throat, closing his book. "It's going to be quite the change.
"Oh... What?" My chest tightened, and I shrunk into myself in the chair I was sitting in.
"To be honest, I can't quite remember..."
"Excuse me?!"
I brought my hips forward, a sort of thrill shooting up when he caught me by the hips.
"Good morning, how are you feeling?" I asked softly, watching as another strand of his messy black hair fell into his face. I brushed it out of the way, and Harry took my hand gently, kissing it, and moving it down to his chest, over his heart. I let him keep my hand where he wanted, not at all unfazed by his silent greeting, yet growing more concerned the longer he stayed silent. He turned around with a slight groan, wrapping his arms around my waist and pulling me in for a hug. I kissed his temple.
I blinked a few times, pleading for my eyes to adjust as much as they could without my glasses.
I woke up the next morning with a headache. I squinted because of the bright light coming in from the window. When I moved, I realized I was wearing short sleeves, and both of my arms were bandaged. I furrowed my brows, looking around to find Draco sitting on a chair next to the bed I was in. I reached over for my glasses, which were handed to me by him. Slowly, my blurred vision became clear, and I realized this wasn't the bed I'd been sleeping in since we moved.
"Thank you for watching them. I know it must have been a surprise, seeing me of all people, asking for such a big favor."
"Can I sit here? Everywhere else is full." I looked up at him... him, and nodded.
"Excuse me?" I said, resting my head on my hand, propped up by my elbow, eyeing Harry with a look that said
She began walking away.
"Are you feeling alright?" Asked Draco. I heard the rustling of a belt buckle and assumed he was slipping on some pants. The only response I found myself giving was an audible exhale and a small moan, knowing that if I opened my mouth I would need to run to the bathroom, and knowing that such sudden movements could make my vision go black again.
"Well boy. It's good to know something good came out of all we did for you." I froze.
"You can be a real git, you know that?" He said, still not moving. I nodded.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Headmistress McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.
badly, but, life seems to have it set up for me to fail- for me to relentlessly claw my way towards any semblance of improvement only to be mercilessly dragged to the floor again.
"This happened to you as soon as he died, you once said." Harry's voice was hollow and fragile.
Draco kneeled down in front of his so , smoothing out Scorpius' robes as he did so.
"Harry?" I blinked a few times, falling back into the present situation. Hermione watched me with a pained expression. I realized she had been speaking, and I was too wrapped up in earlier to pay attention to now.
I spent yesterday trying to calm him down, to have him see the weight of the circumstances, and the fact that No, it wasn't his fault. The fact that the War had just worn them thin, like it did to everyone else. He didn't cry yesterday- he was too mad at himself. As for me, trying to settle and extinguish a blind rage fueled by self hatred that has been bubbling for eleven years isn't a cinch. I had to stop him from scratching the daylights out of himself and hitting himself. It's difficult for me to watch because I care about him so much and I just can't stand the times when I don't succeed in stopping him. He refused to eat lunch and dinner even as I had insisted he eat at least some of it. He decided that he just couldn't stomach it, saying he'd throw up if he tried.
"No, Scorpius, I'm not your 'mum'". Harry interrupted. Dada and Harry shared an embarrassed smile. They both looked back at me.
"Better for us though, we won't have to make food for lunch tomorrow... maybe even dinner." He commented before taking a bite of his own food. Things were silent from us, we were both just eating for a small bit before Draco asked me something.
"Good morning," his voice brought me back to reality for a moment. He groaned, scrunching his face and cuddling into me, his cold nose buried against my neck. "Happy Valentine's Day," he whispered, planting a soft kiss onto my shoulder.
"No. He's mad at me." I said, glancing over to the door that had so violently been closed shut.
"But I do care about you. And I want to be with you." He whispered. I fought back a smile, successfully. I thought to reply, but I didn't. Instead I leaned in and gave him a slow, simple, emotional kiss, which he returned. It felt amazing to be able to do this without every doubt clouding your mind. Knowing that you both care just as much as the other.
"Well you are right now," I countered. He made a move to protest, and I did the only thing that could prevent that, bringing us into a kiss. My hand traveled to his hair, still covered in flour, making it impossibly softer than usual. We broke apart, and I couldn't help but stare at him, feeling happy, and sickeningly in love.
I pushed at the door, again, and again, and again, every failed attempt had me shaking more vigorously and breathing a lot less.
I sat down on the couch, shoulders slumped and head down.
"It's overwhelming..." He whispered. I hugged him tightly.
âHarry POVâ
"Let's go. The day has already started." He said as though he were a parent, I could sense him standing by the bed. I just knew his arms were crossed. I only groaned, finding the covers and covering myself again, wanting the comfort of soft warmth.
"No. I wouldn't have... if anything, it would have changed how I saw you. I had always been jealous of what I thought was your perfect life... I was horrible to you back then, and I was only adding to what you already had to endure at home-"
The conversation between me, Ron, and Draco carried on like that for a long time- awkward and tense. We could barely get through a sentence about the Ministry before I found myself overly agitated and biting out all of my words. Ron left just over a half hour later, giving me a pat on the back, and an "I'll tell Hermione you said hi."
"Scorpius... Maria knows that we're magic." I saw his eyes light up. It crushed me.
"Agreed. I quite enjoy doing this with you," I replied, before turning around to face him. He grumbled and held me closer.
I forced my thoughts to stop wandering as I realized the gravity of this very moment. I looked at him. His eyes bore into me with wild hatred. He was disheveled and on edge. I would have half expected him to have jumped straight out of a jungle with how his hair had managed to become exceptionally messy. He was sweating and the hand over his wand trembled ever so slightly.
"Wake up sleepy head." I said as I shook him.
"Yeah, of course!" I trusted what he was saying, so with a smile, I went over to my room for a bag, some clothes, and Gobstones.
"Do you think they'd be proud of me?"
"Ron, please let them in and close the door it's practically freezing out there." I heard Hermione say from behind him.
He was out of bed, moving. He was fixing the bed sheets.
"No you're not, don't say that." I heard Draco reassure, closing the door of the bedroom and sitting with me on the bed.
Hello readers! I will be posting two chapters today!! In this chapter, may we present, task 2 of the tournament!! Let's see what's in store for the kids!
," she said while pointing her thumb at her chest. Molly
Well, just enough.
"It wasn't your fault... and if it helps, I'm going to see a professional about it soon. A Muggle professional."
"But dada-"
I thought to myself, setting the shirts on the floor.
"Uh, not the person." Ron took a sip of his butterbeer. I felt Harry's hand discreetly weave its way into mine, squeezing. I rubbed my thumb up and down the back of his hand in a comforting manner.
All too suddenly, the door burst open and Scorpius spent no time climbing onto the bed with us.
"You! With the funny glasses. Go and help Scorpius set the table. Draco and I will serve."
âHarry POVâ
"You would mess up the first note." He dramatically accused, accentuating each word. Then he continued: "You aren't even a musician." He said with a smirk.
"Well it's awesome. If you haven't read any of the books or seen any of the movies, you should. It's like, so awesome," replied her friend.
"Oh. I'm sorry. What- what is it you were saying?" I asked, slightly embarrassed.
"Draco... I'm scared too. I don't- I... it's tough. I don't want anything to happen to anyone, at all. Nothing, and yet I've already let someone slip through my fingers- even if I didn't ever like her, she didn't deserve-" Harry stopped, closing his eyes.
"Ginny, Just calm down, lower your wand.. it'll be okay.." He said with a cautious hand held out.
Leaning toward the table, I focused on the sunny green pasture spanning over the cold, hard wooden surface. I held a piece of a golden flower in my hand and scanned ahead. Dada said they're called gorse flowers.
It's currently midnight and I'm sat at a square table with Harry to my left, Maria in front of me, and another woman to my right. Scorpius is sitting on my lap, and we are all halfway through a game called dominos.
In that instant I took Scorpius' hand and stood him up. "We'll be leaving now, mother. He and I still have supplies to purchase." Mother stood as well.
"Alright!" We brought our hands out in fists, playing the best three out of five. I won.
please let me know what y'all think of the story so far, and as always...
"What's up?" He asked, taking a bite of his snack.
I looked to my side and saw Harry and Teddy hugging, then, I looked ahead of me, and saw a soft smile on Andromeda's features.
The Shooting Stars are pelting the Arrows' Keeper, number 12, left and right! He looks vastly overwhelmed and oooooout of control! Will he be able to guard, and protect the hoops, the sanctity of his team, with his very life?"
"Scorpius, let's have a talk." I guided him to his room, while Harry wordlessly turned to go downstairs. Opening his room, I saw his television turned on, and two Wii remotes sitting on the floor. The screen showed that his dancing game was paused. I briefly wondered why he would have two remotes set up for himself.
The silence was odd, and there was a new type of intimacy found in discussing such an elementary and equally important topic with Harry. I somehow couldn't pull my head up to look at him, yet all I wanted to do was get lost in his eyes, in his hold, his warmth.
"Happy birthday Scorpius." She said, "How are you?"
"This stuff is delicious!" Teddy had a cream mustache and a half-drunk ButterBeer in his hands. His hair was bright orange.
At the breakfast table, Luca had sat in his usual spot waiting for me. I sat down, giving him a tired hello before beginning to put food on my plate for breakfast.
"You should join us for dinner, please. I would hate to know you couldn't eat your own food." I began.
"You may have mentioned something of that fashion once or twice." He said, allowing a small smile to adorn his features.
I did as he said. I truly don't want to fight him like we're children again. Especially not in front of Scorpius. If I can do anything, it's honor how his mother would have raised him, and honor how she helped me grow and change into a better person.
"I was thinking more Hufflepuff," Victorie responded, straightening her posture and casting an unsure glance towards Luca. "But then again, no Weasley has ever not been a Gryffindor. It would be a shock." Then she spoke again: "Oh, Teddy! I never told you, but Headmaster said that since I'm ahead of so many others in my year, I would get to take an elective." My eyes widened in surprise.
"I wish I could tell you I did, but you know I'm rubbish at cooking." He chuckled, following me in with a pleasant smile across his face.
"So that's a yes!"
"Take your time, remember to breathe as well." I took a breath that felt more forced and mandatory than anything else, in response to the man's words.
"Thank you. I owe you."
I found the shelf where I had a simple cauldron, some bottled and labeled potion ingredients, and vials of many simple potions- Calming Draughts, Antidotes to common poisons, Bruise removal paste, Burn healing potions, cough potions, and Pepperup Potion. Of course, it was all organized alphabetically, with the spot for dreamless sleep potions empty, as I had taken my fair share of those back when I first moved. Looking at my ingredients, I realized I was low on everything.
We all laughed lightly and snickered at the prospect. "I don't think we'll have to imagine, to be honest. For someone from Beauxbatons, he looks more bumbling than graceful," I made a curtsy motion with my hands and changed my hair into blonde, bringing out a guffaw from my friends as we walked down the hallway, nearly tumbling into other people.
staring at me, his eyes wide. I couldn't say anything.
"Those books." He answered after a moment, opening his eyes and shifting around to look at the sky, so I was hugging him from behind again.
I kept reminding myself.
My mind was in a haze, and I just faintly remember being in the bed, Draco and I remaining together. Everything was slow, and sounds were muffled. I felt his lips brush
Things were silent, and I quickly remembered why I don't talk to kids often. It was always Ginny who did that kind of stuff.
Kingsley cleared his throat.
"I accept."
I tried not to move my feet that much, only shuffled or tip-toe in the smallest steps possible. My hands were the same. I made small movements, making a fist, or a heart, or relaxing my hand whenever necessary. I was doing quite well for someone who hadn't played this game before or danced in this style before; that is, until a certain movement, combined with the telegraphs in the bottom not making sense, completely threw me off the groove. I furrowed my brows, letting out an audible sound of confusion.
"Look, I'm not disagreeing with you, I just don't want him to get too worked up." At that moment, the fireplace roared to life again, and Teddy stepped through with a small trunk.
"Th-this was a mistake, you didn't-" I sighed. "Just, whatever. It's not- that's not what I meant." I turned around to leave, head towards the floor, but was stopped by a firm, yet gentle hand on my shoulder.
"Draco never stepped even a
"Really?"
"Can I... go see him?"
"Harry, can you get that please?" Called Ginny from the kitchen.
Draco gave her a pleasantly surprised look. All I could think was
"No!" I exclaimed sharply, before calming down, and taking a breath. "Draco di-"
Enjoy!
"Oh Scor... Harry is absolutely right. I do think you are strong. I
"Let's get the bruise healing paste on your eye and get you back to your grandmother, I'm sure she's worried." I told him, getting up and offering him a hand up as well.
"Potter... we put our wands down together."
I almost forgot I was half an hour late to breakfast, until I'd heard the passing chatter of people leaving to get ready for their classes. I nearly jumped out of my chair to run to my Defense Against the Dark Arts class, only stopping when I remembered that all the people I'd sat with also had it with me.
Hello readers, *from now on, Updates will come once a week, every Sunday.* This is because I start school (marching band camp) tomorrow!! And Because of my responsibilities as a leader, this means I will be significantly more busy than I was these past several months. Thank you for your understanding, Please let me know what you think of the story so far, and most importantly...
"We can't." he whispered.
"It's good to have you back, Harry."
I remember answering the phone only to be met with an absolutely speechless Ron trying and failing to form the words he needed to tell me.
"Luca?" I scrambled up from my spot on the ground, running to him and giving him a hug.
âHarry POVâ
In that, stupid,
I heard a sigh from the other line.
"This isn't a so much a matter of the Ministry, but rather the MACUSA."
"You're the best, you know that?" I said with a broken chuckle and a worn voice.
"The simple answer is that I'm anything but special, and I should have suffered the same fate as them. What happened to them happened to me, but I managed to be the only one who came out of it."
"It's nothing." I mumbled. He leaned back, showing annoyance at me; I don't blame him.
"Dad says that mum died because she was sick and she was in a lot of pain... is that-"
I sighed, staring at the hedge maze, hoping the task would start a little faster. Just then, the band started to play a festive tune, something that sounded rather jovial for the night.
"I'm fine, I just fell." I called out, closing my eyes. Everything felt far off, and jaded. The only thing I was fully aware of was the ground beneath me.
"Excuse me? No. Not after last time, it's not a good idea."
different. And, this seems fun. We'll be fine." I told him. He squeezed my hands lightly, giving a slightly uneasy smile, then a small nod.
We aren't the only Wizarding population in the world! This puts us all in jeopardy! And- and why me? Why didn't this person write about- I don't know, Merlin, or the founders of Hogwarts or, I don't know, some other famous person! Why me? What is so special about me? Why did she find it necessary to sort through
Carefully, I left the bed, hopefully without waking Draco, and made my way to the bathroom.
"Scorpius please be careful! I told you to watch where you step-"
"Harry have you been reading the papers? Even without ministry confirmation, people have begun to recognize the abductions... some parents are even concerned to take their kids back to Hogwarts."

"Bye Neville."
"Don't do that." He said softly, almost as if he wasn't sure what else to say. I slightly acknowledged him pressing them to his chest like he'd done earlier this morning. I turned it into a hug though. I needed the calm and steady rise and fall from his breathing to ground me. I felt myself fading away from reality.
I shrugged. I don't think I want to tell him yet. It seems we both decided to reside into a laying position at the same time. Now we were both just, looking at each other. I wasn't sure what to call the silence- concerned, stunned, confused, deflated.
"Relax, Merlin... I didn't know that." I calmed down a bit, seeing Draco deep in thought. "What do I do then? What happened... it-"
"Stop that." I could feel hands carefully trying to take my own and I could feel myself curling into a ball. Just stop panicking for no reason. It's gone. It was a dream. But for some reason I felt like if I'd opened my eyes I would see Uncle Vernon right in front of me or even Dudley with his smelting stick.
"I need to see her, take me to her, please."
"Hm..." Wendy leaned closer to me, sitting up straight in his chair, "I am rubbish at Quidditch, and she is rubbish at waltzing. That evens things out. You're not as bad as I thought you would be, though. Good job mate."
, what's going on here?" Gabriel peeked his head around the dormitory door, upon which he saw Wendy angrily pacing around and grimaced.
"I know you're sleeping, but please talk to me. Let me help..." I had to wipe a tear off my eye, one I didn't notice I had shed.
," I protested. "If you aren't feeling up for it, then you really shouldn't be going." Telling him about my dream from last night will have to wait.
"Yes, well, that's actually really funny, uhm-" He grabbed the letter from my hand and I let him, taking in a breath. "Dudley has invited me to christmas lunch... again." Draco glanced up from the parchment, eyeing me sceptically. "B-but! But, notice, he said that Vernon and Petunia won't be there. He said he's sorry, you- you see that, right?"
"Uncle Harry, I'm sorry about the House thing, I didn't know what to do, and-"
"Dada!" Suddenly Draco was clutching his gut where Scorpius had jumped and landed on him.
"Whatever. Your Muggle mail. Show it to me." He said.
"I don't see why I..." I sighed again, standing from the chair, defeated. "I'm going to go to bed," I said, realizing now how much the day has worn on me. Draco stood too, silently taking both of our not-empty plates and sending them off to be taken care of with magic.
"Who?" I asked, confusion clear upon my face.
Percy was at the front desk, arguing with the lady working there, and ignoring his wife, who was telling him: "Calm down, they're working as quickly as they can, it's okay."
"Let's go. Come on, it's not that bad."
"I know you tried. We all did." I replied. At this point, Ginny and IÂ  were both crying silently. She never cries. I took her hand and led us to the couch, for comfort. But not before noticing a flinch that she tried to hide.
I hadn't been in a broom since seventh year. I hadn't been on a broom since the war.
"I didn't go to St. Mungo's; it was a Muggle place," I corrected. Then, I hesitated. Teddy took this as a yes, and I silently cursed myself for not being able to answer him more quickly. His hair quickly changed between a sickly grey, and yellow, before he glanced up at it, and shook his head, forcing it teal again.
"Okay." I said, stuck in place.
"Maybe in America, but, No. I think what Arthur is thinking about is U.P.S." Hermione then shook her head quickly. "Anyway, No. It's not a package. Uhm." She grabbed a hold of Ron's hand and rested them atop the table for everyone to see. In that split second, my gaze turned to Ginny's. She had probably heard the news from Ron the day it happened, albeit having to decipher it from his hysterical crying. For a moment, even with the eternal distance that stood between us, we both felt mutual happiness for Ron and Hermione. We both smiled at each other. I said nothing as Ginny threw a quick look at Hermione.
"You know your mother and I named you after that constellation on purpose. Almost everyone in our family is named after a constellation, Scorpius."
Just then, a tall blonde girl who looked older than me, having green eyes like Harry's and freckles lining her nose and cheeks, poked the younger boy in the ribs. "Cut it out, Louis, he's obviously shy. I'm Victorie, Bill and Fleur's daughter. The weirdo over here is my younger brother Louis." She said with a smile and a wave. I stuck my hand out, strictly remembering my manners.
Victorie gave a confused look, but still wore a smile. "Are you alright?"
"She doesn't know about magic." I said. The three turned to me in sync, and Hermione responded.
"Yes."
After I backed into the house I immediately turned to a more private place to stop and think. Why is Malfoy making me feel this way. I get this feeling like I'm going to embarrass myself or something. Why do I just want to go and hug him again so I can feel better? It's not normal... I don't like this I don't know what this is. My mind continued to bombard me with questions as I sat around. Before I knew it I head a voice, Ginny's
"No!" Without thinking, I nearly ran towards him, and grabbed him by the arms. "No, Luca, please... stay. Until the passing period is over. Please."
"Hey, are you alright?"
"I know we haven't hung out in a while, but... I have a question to ask you," she said as she let go of my hands.
Enjoy!
"I'm cold," He mumbled. For a split second I was surprised, before replying with a simple "me too."
"She said that since my father was a werewolf, that I am. And she told me, that-" by now I was hyperventilating. "She's heard that my dad once transformed and attacked-" another gasp. "Uncle Harry, a-and he hurt people and ran away-" by now I was a terribly embarrassed, blubbering, emotional mess, and I let Luca bring me into a hug as I slumped into him, feeling defeated.
