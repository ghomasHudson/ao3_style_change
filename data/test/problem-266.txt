Harry grimaced. “So many things. Lucius Malfoy is at the top of my list. I don’t know what he wants and this lack of knowledge kills me. I’m worried about Draco. Lucius wants to break us apart, I’m almost certain of it, but I can’t do anything about it because I don’t even know where he is!”
After the ecstasy, they cuddled. Draco loved that part. It was so quiet and peaceful. In those moments he knew for sure that Harry loved him, when they just held each other, waiting for their hearts to beat normally again.
I couldn’t even begin to imagine what was going through her head, but at this point, all I wanted was the comfort of my living room and a strong cup of tea, preferably with my pills. I needed my pills urgently. I walked with some difficulty toward the porch where Astoria was looking at me as if petrified by a spell. Her eyes grew wide as she saw the little boy attached to me. I guess her motherly instincts kicked in because she came to us immediately and knelt down next to him, taking him gently away from me and leading him inside.
“What do you mean when you say you and Lily will fix things?” Nathan sucked his thumb, making Harry more suspicious. “Nathan?” Nathan didn’t answer, and Harry sighed. “Please, son, you’re too young to fix things. You’re only five! Let daddy take care of it, ok?”
Harry came closer and I could see his eyes were stormy and the pupils dilated. The green of his eyes was incredibly dark. My lips parted slightly. What was I expecting exactly? I should run, go far away. But I just stood there, waiting…
“My marriage was set by my parents and Astoria’s. It’s not real. We went along with it because it was better for both of us to be together at the time. But we haven’t shared the same bed in a really long time,” I confessed. Harry was the first person I ever told it to, apart from my therapist. I could feel his eyes burning me as I went on, “We’ve tried for a while, thus Scorpius was born. But Astoria and I have always been more friends than lovers.”
He mumbled a lullaby that he couldn’t remember ever learning but was soothing to him nonetheless. He could almost hear a man’s voice singing it and it never failed to help him calm down.
Ron grabbed Hermione and brought her closer to him for support. And Harry dropped his wand from the shock of seeing his son for the first time in so long. He practically collapsed in front of Nathan, and not able to hold his tears, he let them fall freely. He was speechless. His son looked exactly like him. Even the green eyes were the same colour.
“Oh, Ron, not everything in life is black and white. Maybe he was a bastard in the past, but he’s changed! And I know for sure that he loves Harry not only because he said so, but also because every time he looks at Harry he sparkles! Harry, you have to know this better than anyone!”
“If he sent you here you can tell him to just forget about me,” it was the first thing Draco said, even though it wasn’t what he really felt.
I shook my head. After the war, I’d been too busy with my own wounds to care about everyone else’s. I had hated every minute of my life as a Death Eater. I sometimes felt like ripping my arm out every time I saw the dark mark on my wrist. It had never vanished completely after the Dark Lord died. It was now faded, but still there.
“He knows,” Draco ruffled Nathan’s head and kissed his forehead as well. “In fact, I think our dear Nathan is cleverer than we think. With his cute face, he can pretty much convince all of us to do whatever he wants us to do.” Draco winked and Nathan laughed.
"You thought I was Saulus and in a way, you were right. I used that name. Then, to my surprise, I discovered that there was actually a Saulus Fimcyl. It was such a coincidence and I called myself stupid over and over. You see, Saulus Fimcyl was created with my own name and never in a million years could I have imagined that someone with the same name actually existed! He came after me to clear things up and, well..."
I paled instantly. Why did I say that? What was he going to think of me now? I didn’t have the courage to look into his eyes. I was afraid of what I was going to see in them. He was saying something, but I was so disturbed that I didn’t hear a word of it. I thought I would pass out. Something was compressing my chest, making me out of breath.
What I saw, however, was not complete destruction or dark wizards ready to pounce. There was only Harry on the floor, and naked. I wondered if I was still dreaming, and if that was the case then I surely did not want to wake up at any time soon. I stared at his fit body trying hard not to drool. Harry was a sight to be seen. His strong thighs let me salivating. I felt like running my hands all over his body and making it my main dish.
It was funny to observe the different reactions on his face as he skimmed it – surprise, distaste, extreme distaste, and finally contempt.
Demon Harry slapped him again. “Don’t be insolent with your new owner. You’ll obey me after you realise that no matter how powerful your lover is, he won’t be a match for the Corona. You won’t deny me then.”
And then he was gone. I stood still for a long time, and that was how Astoria found me minutes later. She tried to make me talk, but I had no strength left. I just went back to my room, locked the door and fastened the curtains. Then, in the dark, I cried.
He kept throwing me sideways glances as we walked towards our destination. I tried my best to look normal. Only then did I pay attention to our surroundings. It was derelict area, to say the least. There was no one in sight but a few stray cats that didn’t bother with our presence. It had a Knockturn Alley feel to it. It gave me chills.
I had not been exactly unhappy at school. Only in my Sixth Year had I really begun to realise the chaos of it all and what it was really like to be scared to death. Only then had I really felt what it was like to feel guilt and despair, lost and undone.
Am I being a hypocrite? Maybe. But every father hopes that his son will fend for himself. At least in that matter, I could relate to Lucius.
Dizzy, Draco got up and almost fell to the ground. His body hadn’t recovered yet from the series of jinxes that had hit him. He placed his hands protectively on his belly, praying that nothing bad had happened to his baby. He’d never forgive himself if he lost the child he was expecting. He should have stayed home instead of going on a suicide mission.
“That’s very suspect.” Draco looked thoughtful. “Do you think he was a Death Eater and that now he’s looking for revenge?”
“I know you meant well, Bob, but next time you accuse my husband, bring me proof. Otherwise, I don’t want to hear it, ok?” Harry said, a masked warning behind his words.
“I don’t understand, Harry. Give me a goddamned good reason to go! Because right now I’m way too confused to think of anything! What did I do?”
The dinner was a disaster from the beginning. As if turned out, Bob was a gorgeous brunette that wanted nothing more than to get into Harry's pants. It was clear to Draco that Bob had a huge crush on Harry, and curiously, he seemed to be the only one to notice this. Even Hermione didn't have a clue about it. How could they be so blind? Of course, they were Gryffindors. That by itself explained their lack of malice. But that was not all. Bob was a Gryffindor, too, and for them that was enough proof that he was reliable. They seemed to have forgotten that Peter Pettigrew – the traitor – had been a Gryffindor as well.
“Have you talked to him yet? Or are you just coming here when he’s asleep?” Draco asked knowingly. “Well, I’ve been talking to him. He keeps asking for you every time.”
And Draco did, but still, he felt as if that was all a dream. He shook his head, trying to deny what he had just heard. He couldn’t possibly be…
Neither of us could look away, so we just stared at each other for a really long time. Being prey of his emerald eyes was scary but in a good way. I was afraid of what had been going on in Harry’s head. It seemed so unlike the adult Harry to be swept away by his desires, which could only mean he had been pondering about us for a while, and his needs had become strong enough to make him put his wife aside. It was a crazy idea, but I was full of hope.
Draco started moving inside Harry again, escalating the movements slowly. Harry almost closed his eyes, but Draco forbade him by stopping again. This time Harry whined a little, but he kept his green eyes locked with Draco’s silver-blue ones. As they stared at each other, it seemed like they were caught in a whirlpool. It was damn good, in Harry’s opinion. That strong feeling of lust certainly wasn’t new for either of them, but at the same time, it was an entirely different thing. The experience was unique and Harry was dumbfounded by how long he was hanging on without exploding with pleasure.
No, this isn't a dream. I am actually updating the fic. I am also crying. I miss you all. I always receive pleas to update the fic. Thank you so much for never giving up on me. This update if for you. <3
‘There’s nothing stopping me from stupefying you, get a sample of your blood and send you back home.’
“Dean is also gay?” Ron stumbled in the chair and stared at them perplexed. “What’s going on with this world? Suddenly all of my friends are gay! Do you think Neville is gay, too?”
“Even though we didn’t believe there was something worse than Voldemort,” Lucius went on, “We still gathered the best sci-wizards at the time to study Nathan as soon as we found out that you had a son.”
"This arrangement sucks! But I guess it’s necessary until we find out what they want with Nathan and with us. Besides, we’ll see each other Saturday, right? It’s only two days away."
‘Why am I surprised?’ Draco thought, his head aching. ‘Bob was the bloody traitor. I should have known... I never liked the bastard.’
I spent the rest of the day wandering around the house, trying unsuccessfully not to think of Harry. I wondered if he would leave for Egypt without me. I was so paranoid that I began to think he had slept with me just to get a sample of my blood. I had no obvious marks, but he could have taken them away using magic, couldn't he?
“There was nobody there when we arrived, just a big hole in the wall of an empty store, and some damage here and there. You were there, weren’t you?”
Harry shook his head and then smiled. “You and Nathan think you can get away with pretty much everything, huh? All you have to do is wink at me and smile.”
Harry had gone to work against his will. He entered his office slowly, dragging his feet and wearing a sad expression on his face. He had shadows around his eyes, courtesy of an awful night of sleep. He was feeling depressed and miserable, and he wanted nothing more than to spend the entire day in bed feeling sorry for himself. He just got out of bed because everywhere he looked in his apartment he saw Draco haunting him like a bloody ghost. He felt as if he was lost in a tour of memories.
“I dunno.” Nathan shrugged, putting his thumb in his mouth. Draco went silent and after a while, Nathan took the thumb out of his mouth and said, “It’s a baby girl. She’ll be better than me in Quiddish.”
‘When we reach Paris we’ll apparate to Spain. We’ll stay there for a day and then apparate to Egypt,’ he informed me.
This made Dursley talk instantly, “You must understand that they told us you were dead! It was a small fellow with some weird purple hat that stepped into my house and said to me that Petunia and I were the only family the boy had. We took him, just like we took you.”
Harry moved uncomfortably. “What? Why did he send our son a gift? What was it? Did you check to see if there were any spells in it? Why didn’t you tell me this before?”
They stared at each other, dazzled. Finally, Harry embraced Draco in his arms, giving him a deep kiss.
He did the only thing he could do on a situation like that. He shut the door in their faces, hoping that he had broken someone’s nose.
“I don’t think this is neither the time nor the place to have this discussion,” Hermione pointed out.
“Of course you can. You’re the Great Harry Potter. You can do everything you want,” I whispered. Maybe my voice sounded too sexy for my taste.
I didn’t dare to create false hope, but who said that it was possible to stop our illusions from building up?
He also knew he was playing with fire and he could get really burned on that one. Harry trusted him not to do anything stupid but that was exactly what he was doing. Talking to Lucius alone was the first step to breaking Harry’s confidence in him and yet he couldn’t help it. Lucius was his business and no one else’s. He’d trusted the bastard and that had almost killed Nathan. Draco couldn’t let him go unpunished.
‘I guess that is true for some, but not for your family. In fact, I remember them being quite committed to the cause.’
They had built a strong friendship as the days passed by after the war, enough for Draco to reveal some of his most intimate secrets, including his obsession for The-Boy-Who-Lived. When Draco decided to abandon the wizarding world, Seamus had supported him in every way he could. He helped him build a new life and a new identity.
“Luc,” Saulus called, putting his hand in Lucius’ arm. “Please, calm down. I’m sure Harry is as worried as you are, if not more. Besides, you’re scaring little Nathan.” Saulus pressed a button on the wall and a young witch entered the room a few minutes later. Saulus addressed her, “Joanne, please take care of Nathan while Mr Potter and I talk.”
“No one knows really. I guess it’s because muggles live in a different reality. There aren’t too many theories about it, but if you want to, I can give you the name of a few interesting books about the subject.”
It was quite funny – from Hermione’s point of view – how both men had changed. Seeing them together, it was like they had traded personalities. Draco used to be the one that spent hours looking at the mirror and making sure that his hair wouldn’t get messy, while Harry was more like the clumsy type. Now Draco didn’t care much about those things – although he was still a little vain – and Harry was the one that was constantly worried about his hair, his outfit or whether everything in his house was set in perfect order. But in spite of Harry’s attempts to look as solemn as an Auror should look, his hair was still rebellious.
"I don’t think it’s safe, Draco, especially now that the hearing is settled. In fact, I advise you to owl your husband and tell him to remain hidden until the big day."
It wasn’t something I had actually thought about doing, but now that I was there on my knees and having that vision in front of me just waiting for the taking, I did not hesitate to do just that. I touched his stiff member with my tongue and hands. I felt it throb. I grinned with satisfaction and pleasure. I tried swallowing it all and heard Harry moaned something I did not understand because I was too busy at the moment. It was quite an experience to feel his prick grow inside my mouth. I knew Harry was in as much ecstasy as I was, almost coming again.
Harry grinned widely. “Really?” he exclaimed, hugging the woman tightly. The nurse flushed. Harry let go of her without noticing her embarrassment, and then he took Nathan in his arms. “You have a sister!”
It was then that they heard the soft voice of a child coming from behind them. The first one to look was Draco, who gasped of the sight of what he would call later ‘a carbon copy of the Boy-Who-Lived’. The only difference was that Nathan didn’t have a scar on his forehead.
“That was how I knew Draco was in trouble. You would be surprised at how much a person can tell you after a good shag. I saved Hermione the same way. And you, Harry. I told you about the attack in Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. Do you remember?”
Jonas gave them the address and after a while, Draco and Fred were back on the street again. Draco wondered if they shouldn’t call for help, but Fred told him they didn’t have to warn the others about it. Draco still pondered if they were doing the right thing, his mind always on Harry, but Fred was determined to go alone if he had to.
Harry smiled and I saw two dimples on his cheeks. It was so adorable I almost sighed like an infatuated teenager.
“That’s preposterous! So do you really think that all you have to do is whistle to have me at your disposal? HA! You wish. I’m not your sex toy.”
They ran towards Nathan, both with their hearts on their mouth. Harry knelt beside his son, a sense of dejavu coming over him. His trembled hands touched Nathan softly, afraid of what he might find. Tears fell down his eyes and he let out a screech of despair. The child looked so quiet and… pale. But Harry couldn’t even think about what that meant.
‘You know, no one tells me anything certain about your disease, which drives me crazy.’ Harry’s fingers on the keys hardened. The sound made me cringe. ‘What exactly do you have?’
He had slept with me, but not with some internal struggle, right? He was no Casanova. He was Harry Potter, The Harry Potter. He was righteous and reliable. I’d never read anything scandalous about him on the news. He was the perfect father and husband. Wasn’t he?
‘I just hope you’re not doing it as a wait to punish yourself… or because you hope you won’t survive the experience.’ The last sentence came as a surprise to me. As I looked into his eyes I could tell he was really afraid of that being true.
He walked away and Hermione watched, amused, as Ron sock George in the arm. Harry saw the whole scene from the corner of his eyes and he laughed a little before turning his attention to his husband. Draco looked at him frowning and formed a voiceless ‘what?’ He muttered a ‘later’ back at him. Finally, they kissed each other under the cheers of the guests and the feast began.
“Oh, right. I guess I was a little harsh with him. I was jealous, I confess. I didn’t think he was the right guy for you. I mean, he was a Death Eater and a Malfoy. All my life I was taught that the Malfoys were just a bunch of evil and corrupt bastards. I was led by my old prejudices and I’m sorry. I still don’t trust him, if I may say so. But maybe he’s a nice guy.”
When I entered the main living room, I poured myself some whiskey. It was never a good idea to drink with the kind of meds I was taking, but what the hell. I needed something strong. I offered a glass to Alfred, who, in a daring move, took it from me and drank it in one gulp. It was funny to watch him roll his eyes and pass out on the couch. The boy had probably never drunk alcohol in his life. I enjoyed the silence, broken only by Astoria’s light steps.
I started playing Pathetique, by Beethoven. It was a little less difficult than Rachmaninoff, but not less beautiful. After that, we played Konna ni Chikaku de. It was softer, just like a lullaby. He followed me well. We left the melody to overtake us. I smiled as I hadn’t in a long time. Angel’s sweetness and innocence made their way into my heart.
Harry, who had been packing his stuff in his office, glanced at Ron. "Yes, they did. Elisabeth was thrilled to give me the news. She said she couldn’t have a criminal on her staff. What I did goes against the major principles of the Auror’s code. I should have never attacked Dursley and blah-blah-blah."
“You don’t need to get heavy on me, Potter. In case you’re wondering, you can use spells. A simple one ought to do it.”
“Just common criminals, except for the hooded fellow. I don’t really know who he is. He’s looking for a missing person, too,” Jonas informed.
“It’s about his foundation for orphan boys and girls that he started after the war. It seems to me that there is this gang of teenage wizards on the streets of London who are sons and grandsons of ex-Death Eaters, and he plans to insert them in his project. Matilda Junian has shown interest in the matter.”
“George and Fred will come with my mother later. Oh, and Sirius told me he’s on his way here too.” Ron sat by his side. “So, how’s Draco?”
That husky and sexy voice was making Harry’s senses shaken. They closed the distance between them and the silver-blue eyes met the emerald ones. The stranger took Harry’s face in his hands and stroked it softly. Harry sighed, lost in infinite pleasure. The stranger’s hands slid down his shoulders taking off his cloak which was followed by his linen green shirt. Before the stranger could unzip his trousers, Harry detained his hands firmly. The stranger looked at him unsure of what to do, as if he was scared of Harry’s reaction.
They kept silent for a moment and then Hermione said, “Do you think Harry and Ron will get out of this one? It’s so bloody unfair! Harry was just saving his son from those dreadful people.”
As the day went by quite peacefully, Draco and Harry took a moment to be alone. They sat on a bench inside a bower, just a few meters away from where the feast was taking place and held each other for a long time.
"Oh, but I'm sure of it. I know them, Malfoy, they're my friends. I know how their minds work," Ron said, annoyed.
“What I had to! Angel was only two! It’s been difficult, but we’ve managed. We found others like us!”
“See? You can see why he’s Harry’s son. He’s hungry! A bar of harmless chocolate didn’t spoil his appetite. Right, Nat?” Draco said, amused, and he winked at Nathan.
Draco massaged Harry’s balls, buttocks and legs with his strong hands and then they ran up again, along with the teasing tongue. Harry felt as if he was going to explode. He couldn’t resist touching Draco’s hair and burying his hand in it. Pulling Draco by the hair, Harry kissed him hard on the lips, their tongues entwining madly. Draco pulled back a little and Harry sighed in frustration once again.
“He will have to attend special classes,” Neville warned him. “It’s all in the book. And if you don’t mind, I would like to monitor him every once in a while. I’m very interested in telekinesis. Did you know that he could develop clairvoyance? That’s really cool, don’t you think?”
The reality was that the moment we arrived Harry took me in his arms – not in a romantic way – and we apparated to Madrid. On the upside, I could touch Harry without it being an issue. Unfortunately, apparating had its downsides. Even with Harry doing all the work, I still felt like throwing up as a side-effect.
It was later that night that Nathan found Draco sitting on a big armchair on the terrace, looking at the stars and sighing deeply. Even though Nathan was too young to understand certain things, he could feel that Draco was sad and worried, more than his father was.
“Draco is alive. Nostrums wants him, but he’s confused about it. He’s never felt human desire before. He only knows how to use our emotions against us, but he doesn’t know what to do with them now that he can feel. Don’t let him trick you, though. He’s a demon, no matter what he says. He always tricked me. But he’s so much like you… I couldn’t resist.”
"Apparently, you and I have very different notions about what it takes to be a good friend. He's not your friend, Harry."
“They were mortal enemies in a previous life, then.” Draco also seemed lost in his thoughts. “Nostrums came back just to get even with Nathan for locking him away all those years ago. Do you think… do you think they were like us?”
Harry embraced Draco’s waist with his legs and pulled him closer. “I’m patient enough. It’s our honeymoon. Have mercy! Please?” he made a sad puppy face and Draco smiled.
“I was also thinking that you should stay there with Nathan for a little longer so I wouldn’t have to worry.”
“Please, tell me this is a cruel joke! We can’t have a thing like that at our house! It’s bloody dangerous! It almost ripped off my arm once!”
“I don’t think he will want to see you, Harry. Give him some time. I’ll try to talk to him to see if I can still fix this mess. Honestly, Harry, I’m so disappointed! How could you do this on his birthday? What a jerk! Besides, if he cheated on you for real, then you should ask yourself what was missing in your relationship! You never said you loved him!”
Taking Harry by surprise, Draco flipped them over with an impetuous movement, so Harry could be on the bottom and he could be on top. Almost a few seconds later, he penetrated Harry and thrust inside him deeply. Harry cried his name successively. Draco was bombing Harry fast, and the enraptured face of his husband showed that he loved every minute of it.
Later that night, Harry and Draco sat side by side in the hospital room, watching over Nathan alertly. The other’s had long gone to their own houses but they assured the couple that they would be back in the morning. Draco laid his head on Harry’s shoulder, his eyelashes starting to get heavy.
The next morning Harry woke up in an empty bed. He sighed, deeply frustrated. It wasn’t fair. The mysterious man was responsible for the most memorable night he had ever had and he hadn’t even left a phone number or an address so they could contact each other again. The beautiful and tasty stranger hadn’t left a bloody goodbye note. Harry hid his head under the pillow. Suddenly, he stood up determined, throwing away the pillow and the silk sheets on the floor.
He laughed and it was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard in my life. I felt like sticking out my tongue at him but in a cute kind of way which would just be ridiculous and child-like.
I began to flick through the Daily Prophet and froze for a moment as I saw Harry’s picture. He had received yet another prize. How many had it been that year? At least ten, I thought. I wonder if they never got tired of praising him. It was a dumb question really. If I couldn’t resist him, the rest of the world had no chance but surrender to Harry’s greatness.
On the third day, Astoria read me letters from my mum and from Scorpius. There was nothing new in Paris, by the grace of Merlin. At least my parents seemed oblivious to what was happening in the UK.
More annoyed than ever, Harry Apparated home only to find it empty. He shouted for Draco everywhere but got no answer. Upset, he sat on the couch, swearing aloud and cursing Draco’s stupidity. Brutus showed up in the kitchen’s doorway and barked to call his attention.
"No, you don’t understand, you were dead. For a minute you were dead. I pulled you out of the water and you weren’t breathing. I was so scared. I thought Voldemort had won. But he was dead already. I made sure he was. But you weren’t breathing, Harry."
Draco gripped his fingers on Harry’s back, bringing him even closer to his body. The room around them was spinning round and round and they were feeling deliciously dizzy. Draco felt himself clutching Harry more and more and screaming like he had never done before as the raven-haired man speeded up, their hips finding the perfect cadence for a perfect dance.
She did try to tame Harry Potter and the Weasleys at one point. I confess it had been fun to see her fruitless efforts go down the drain. Harry Potter refused to treat her as a goddess, so Matilda detested him. And that’s why I found Harry’s visit to her club an anomaly, to say the least.
They glared at each other. Saulus felt the need to cut in. “We have more important things to worry about at the moment.”
All my senses became fully alert. I felt something at the tip of my stomach, and my mouth went dry. Slowly, as if I didn’t really care, I folded the letter and held it tightly in my hands before turning around to look at Harry. I should have known he would be called here. I guess deep down the whole point of annoying his Aurors was to get Harry here in the first place.
“I think I have the right to know what’s going on, Potter. After all, I was the one who saved them,” I challenged him. It was quite a step for a coward like me. On second thought, where Harry Potter was concerned, I always felt my blood boil, and I could never refrain from standing up to him.
"Right. But you were the one who grabbed my arm when we heard a weird noise that turned out to be just a rat," Draco commented, amused.
As I looked at Angel and the way he kept shoving food down his throat as if expecting everything to vanish from his sight at any moment, I felt the worst man alive.
Draco felt his lips trembling. “Do you think it’s easy, Harry? Because it isn’t. You don’t know how hard this is for me. You have no idea.”
"He was. And he failed miserably." Seamus wiped away his tears. "It’s hard, you know? It was so much easier when you and I were together. No strings attached. Just wild sex, lots of fun and adventures. Do you miss me, Draco?"
“Don’t forget to eat well, Nathan,” Draco said. “Don’t skip meals either. And don’t eat too many chocolate frogs! They will give you pimples! And behave! Don’t keep wandering in the corridors at night. Don’t sneak out of your room to meet… people.”
Draco, she noticed, seemed to be glowing and Hermione felt happy for him. After so many storms, he deserved to be happy, and so did Harry.
I clenched my fists. I had never been as good as my father to obtain information from other people. Lucius was a natural at it. He always knew what buttons to press and how much to pay. I, however, didn’t have his wicked talents.
I clenched my fists. He crossed his arms. It was a battle of wills and we were both stubborn bastards.
Draco felt warmth running through his body, soothing his heart. The pain in his belly ceased as if Lily had indeed understood him. Draco smiled tenderly. If only he hadn’t come after Seamus. Then he and his baby would be fine and Harry wouldn’t be risking his neck to save them.
"There’s nothing written in blue," said Harry with a serious expression. "There’s only black ink, Nat."
“I would never do that to you, Draco. This is not just about sex, even though the sex last night was out of this world. I’ve told you already, what I feel for you is stronger than what I’ve ever felt for any other person before.”
I don’t know if he meant to hurt me or if he was just trying to make me face reality. I think he meant for both. I glanced at my image in the big mirror hanging above the fireplace and I saw that he was right. I was white, almost translucent. I was also terribly weak and thin. My old charm was long gone. It was humiliating.
“How could that be?” Nathan asked, his voice wavering. “Is love so horrible? I’m the one who made you like this? It’s my fault.” Tears fell down his cheeks. “I’m... I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.”
Exhaustion overtook me as it didn’t in quite a long time. Soon I was fast asleep, and I wished for sweet dreams. I was awoken suddenly by a loud noise and a curse. Harry. I ran to his room immediately clutching my wand tightly.
“Yes,” Nathan put his thumb inside his mouth; something that he did quite often, especially when he was feeling scared.
“I don’t know where he is,” Harry said, and he looked at Lucius. “Actually, before you called me, I was thinking about asking you the same question. I thought he was with you.”
‘I’m not pretending, Malfoy,’ he said coldly. ‘It was you who wanted to come on this journey. So you’d better go through with it till the end.’
“What do you mean, what’s going on? We’re bringing down this place and every single one of the demon’s minions!” Fred shouted with excitement, his eyes glowing as if he was a child in an amusement park. “It’s what you get when you put Lee and me in the same cell!”
Nathan made a gesture for Draco to be quiet and then placed his hands on Draco’s belly. Before Draco could stop him, a blue light surrounded the swollen belly, and Draco felt as if invisible hands were tickling him from the inside. He stared at Nathan, fascinated. He could feel that his baby was becoming less agitated. He himself was much more relaxed.
‘I could arrest you. You still have a hearing at the Ministry. I could arrest you right now. You’re not authorized to leave the UK.’
I opened my eyes at once. My sight, however, was a bit blurry. I turned my head around slowly. I felt tremendously sick. I spotted Harry’s silhouette against the light. He was sitting on a very uncomfortable hospital chair. Great. I was in St. Mungus.
“I want the truth!” Harry demanded. “I have the right to know what’s going on! What happened to Nathan when he was born? And why have you suddenly decided that Draco should get pregnant? It doesn’t make any sense!”
“I hate you so much right now, Malfoy! God! You have the nerves to show up here looking as innocent as an angel. I can’t believe how stupid I was when I decided to trust you. But I was blind and today I had the best eye-opener in the world and I finally saw the truth.”
“Come on, Draco,” said Goyle a little less aggressive. I noticed, however, that he gripped his wand harder. “We just want the boys. They belong to us.”
When the ecstasy was over and they lay side by side, hands and legs entwined, Draco grinned. “My body was missing this.”
“Mr Potter,” he heard her saying, “Could you please sit down and wait? Dr Longbottom is on the phone right now and he will be with you in a minute, sir!”
“I’m not going to arrest Malfoy,” Harry said quickly as he saw Angel looking scared.  “We just have a... date in court to solve the problem.”
They were separated by only a few inches now. They were so near and yet so far away. If Draco wanted, he could reach out his hand and pull Harry into his arms. Then he could satiate his body’s need that had been neglected ever since the previous day. So little time had passed since they were apart... It seemed like forever that he had savoured Harry’s cherry-red lips for the last time. Now he wanted to just surrender to his damn needs and kiss him. But he wouldn’t. Not until Harry pleaded for his forgiveness.
My desire grew so strong that I thought I heard Harry moan on the other room. It was a deep, desperate moan like my own. His voice was throaty, sexy, masculine. I bit my lower lip. My body shook. The ending was bliss. It was a mixture of colours and sensations. I went to the moon and back. The proof of my desire spread all over my belly. I didn’t want it to end, but it was inevitable.
“NO! It’s not that! I just need a little time to think about everything that has happened. You omitted an important fact of your life Draco.”
“You know… We never talked about the days you spent in Nostrums’ hideout.” Harry was reluctant about bringing that difficult subject up, but he needed to make sure that Draco had escaped unhurt from that hell. “What happened there? Did he… did he touch you?”
“Look, Miss Thunder,” said a more peaceful Ron. “Harry is just here because this whole situation is somehow connected to him. We just want to know what Davies was doing here. Did he have any information to share with our department?”
“I think we should join forces and investigate those disappearances right away,” Harry said decisively. “This is terrible news! Someone is trying to regain power and we don’t even know who it is. We don’t know for sure if this person is Lucius Malfoy,” Harry hurried on when he saw Bob opening his mouth to protest. “But I do agree that we need to arrest Lucius. He has crimes to pay for.”
Burke’s hands grabbed the bag before he opened his mouth. I pulled it back forcefully. My body reacted negatively to the whole place. I felt my stomach churn. If I listened to my instincts, I would run as fast as I could and go back to the comfort of my house. I had to gather a lot of courage to stay and face the disgusting man in front of me.
Not even his tantric lessons had prepared Draco to such a puissant moment. When he came, that single instant alone seemed to last a lifetime. Harry followed him a few minutes later, hugging Draco tightly and whispering loving words in his ears. Harry kissed him tenderly and for a long time, they stayed entangled in each other’s arms, stroking each other’s hair and face, chin and lips.
Who was the idiot now? Of course I was feverish, but not because I was sick. I was feeling like that because of him.
There was a place I could get information if I wanted to. I guess I’d pay a little visit to Knockturn Alley.
“Well, you should. You were there after all. An eye-witness saw you shoot spells around more than once. One of them hit somebody. But no one knows who the others were.”
Hmm... I have no idea how to write battles, so the battle in this chapter will be very, very weird. I won’t waste my time with long battle scenes because of my poor vocabulary. Hey, it’s hard to write in English! ^_^ I will also mix religious’ beliefs, but this is fiction! If anyone feels offended or insulted in any way, it was never my intention, and I apologise in advance. That said, enjoy the story!
Something poked him and his little body trembled. He heard a bird shriek and felt another poke on his ribs. Immediately, he pulled the covers away and his eyes met Eerie’s, the baby Hippogriff. He smiled sweetly at the sight of his new friend. It was as if Eerie had sensed his fear and came to his rescue. Nathan appreciated the company, but Eerie’s presence didn’t make the disturbance to go away.
“I’m sure Seamus is fine. Maybe he went to Scotland,” Draco said to calm Dean down. “He has an Uncle living there that he likes.”
There I was, Draco Malfoy, a man who had spent almost twenty years without getting himself connected to any sort of serious trouble; a man who lived in complete isolation and would rather have his dogs for company. I was now a man who didn’t want the limelight. And yet my heart felt so much more alive now that Harry was back in my life. I knew he would come again because it would be necessary.
Huh? My heart literally stopped and I think my soul left my body for a moment, perhaps to try and understand what he had just said. That was the reason why I missed the rest of his speech, and when I finally came back to earth Harry was staring at me angrily.
“You can’t, Nat.” Harry knelt down in front of Nathan and kissed his forehead. “But do you know what you can do? You can go home and give Brutus the big news!”
Harry laughed at Draco’s face and applauded Ron, giving him a tight hug afterwards. Sirius stood up the next and made an emotional speech that brought tears to everyone’s eyes. He quoted James and Lily Potter, and guaranteed to Harry that they would have been really proud of him.
“Yes, Nat. But she died like a heroine. She died protecting you. She loved you very much. She was a Quidditch player, just like daddy. And she was very, very good at it. Not as good as Harry, of course but...”
“Well, since your birthday is in two days, he’s planning something romantic. I don’t know if the surprise party is for all of us as well or if it’s just for you two, if you know what I mean. He hasn’t decided yet. I’m counting on something romantic just for the two of you.”
‘Hey, would you two stop that? This talk is giving me the creeps…’ said Alfred staring at us with a strange look on his face.
“Do you want a piece of chocolate?” Nathan handed him a large piece but Draco didn’t accept it. Then he offered it to Ginny, who shook her head and took a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe away some tears that had run down her eyes.
Harry changed his clothes and Brutus appeared in front of him with a letter in his mouth. Harry took it – but not before cleaning it a little – and ripped it off quickly. It was a message from Draco just in case Harry woke up before the right time.
If he insisted on the matter, as flattering as it was, I would hex him. I didn’t want to delve into the subject any longer.
If Harry thought I would just let him go he was seriously mistaken. He had no right to just take away what was mine without an injunction from the Ministry. Without a care in the world, I cast a spell on the door and locked it before any of the Aurors outside could even realise what was going on.
“Maybe you’ve changed over the years in the matters of the heart, but Harry is still a beginner. He was never the type to voice his true feelings. I think he’s afraid or something. It doesn’t mean that he doesn’t love you.”
Dobby's big bright eyes shone happily, and he bowed before the man he admired – Harry, of course – and went away.
Harry crumbled down on a chair, way too stunned to answer. He had had sex with Malfoy, his most ferocious enemy after Voldemort. He had had sex with Draco Malfoy and he’d liked every minute of it. Actually the word ‘like’ wasn’t even close to what they had shared together. It had been amazing, out of this world, and Harry wanted more.
Draco handled the paper to Seamus, who analyzed it. "Meet at Magical Park," Seamus read it out loud. "Signed by Saulus Fimcyl. Interesting. I remember the place. It was a common Death Eaters code. Magical Park... what a joke. They used to burn muggles alive in there. It was horrible. Why do you have this?"
“You’re damn right I was worried! Where are Hermione, Sirius and Remus? They should have been taking care of my son! Dammit! Do I have to do everything around here? First Draco disappears and then my friends let my son wander around the neighbourhood alone!? I should have stayed in the cabin. It would have spared me a lot of headaches.”
"She had a baby, my baby, and I only knew after she was dead." Harry’s eyes were shining with unshed tears. "I don’t know why she didn’t tell me. Maybe it was because of the way my life seemed to be so damn complicated already without a son. Or maybe she was just scared. When I looked at him I knew instantly that he was mine. It was love at first sight. His name was Nathan, and I had the privilege to be with him for three whole months. It wasn’t enough, but at least I got to be with him a little before Voldemort killed him."
‘What a lovely surprise!’ I exclaimed trying not to show how nervous I actually was. ‘We’ve just received mother’s post this morning. Has something happened?’
Draco had been really distressed about those things in the beginning, but Harry was getting better. He wasn’t so paranoid anymore – except when it came to Lucius.
Harry Potter was the only person I was hoping would successfully follow me, and there he was. Mission accomplished.
I should have known. The way he had stated that so matter-of-factly made me want to kiss him breathlessly.
I was afraid that Lucius already knew about everything, or worse, that he was involved with The Almighty. Although he had promised us not to deal with dark magic anymore, one could never be sure, especially when the said group wanted to bring back Slytherin, an idea that I was sure my father would find interesting.
‘Please, tell me you are going to France to visit your parents. I’d rather have you conspiring with Lucius than thinking that you can go to Egypt by yourself.’
For Hermione, this could be easily explained. Since they’d been secretly in love with each other all their lives, once they were apart after the war, they unconsciously started to absorb the other’s character to supply the need they had for each other’s presence. That way, Harry started to act like Draco and Draco started to act like Harry. That was how strong their love was.
Draco gulped, his eyes suddenly becoming very lucid. "Do you even remember your last duel with Lord Voldemort?"
Indeed, that was what happened. Draco didn’t even bother to look at them as they played. He only turned around once when he heard Harry yelping, but when he realized everything was ok he turned his back to them again and finished to prepare their meal.
There was no response. He wondered where he was. They’d been together for five months. Five fantastic and unforgettable months. Draco couldn’t be happier. After all he had been through, his life was finally perfect. Not that his relationship with Harry was simple. Harry wasn’t kidding when he said he was a perfectionist. His apartment - the one he found himself in at that exact moment - was so neat and organized that Draco usually felt out of place every time he was there.
Hermione made a face. “I know. The Ministry never made much sense. Don’t you remember Fudge? Saulus must be behind all of this because we know The Daily Prophet only publishes what the Ministry orders. We should do something. Perhaps you should give an interview to another newspaper, Harry. I heard that there’s this new newspaper – called The Independent – that is very good. They don’t take orders from the Ministry. What do you think, Harry?”
“It’s not easy, Malfoy. Perhaps it is for you because you belonged to that filthy environment, but it isn’t for me!”
Harry arched an eyebrow. “That sounded terribly contradictory. How can he do a good job while supporting corruption?”
"Look, Seamus, I know that you’re needy, but I’m not the answer to your problems and you know that. I’m married, in case you haven’t noticed yet. And I love Harry. I could never cheat on him. Ever."
Not the answer I wasn’t expecting, that was for sure. However, it was so Harry I couldn’t help but smirk. I wanted to beat him up for being so enigmatic. At the same time, I was dying to press my mouth against his.
The Great Hall stopped when he entered. No one was supposed to know his secret identity but Harry had this unique charisma that attracted the eyes of every person in the crowded room.
"I’ve thought of it, but do you know what? I’m actually tired of this place. Maybe this is all for the best." Harry shrugged.
Harry’s mind kept drifting away to the future. There he saw Nathan as clumsy as he used to be, having his first date, experiencing his first kiss.
“Well, let’s see...” Harry got a little closer, but not enough to let me intoxicated, just enough so that his perfume could invade my nostrils and tease me a bit with his manly scent. “For starters, you’re in a secret room full of old parchments and suspicious books... And my men told me they heard some horrible noises coming from here.”
Draco clenched his fists. "How dare you? Do you know who I am? I'm no woman! I'm a man, and my family owns these lands and this stinky town. We've been masters of this town for generations. Show me your respect!"
“Please, make yourself at home. I’ll ask Swan to bring you a cup of tea,” said Astoria with her melodic voice. “Or perhaps you’d prefer something else.”
Seamus nodded. “I wanted to make him jealous and the only person he really hates is you. So I ordered a Polyjuice potion and convinced Renan to drink it. He actually thought it was a funny prank.”
‘There aren’t many Muggle things in my house, it’s true. I do admit I am a bit old-fashioned. However, I don’t despise Muggles, Potter.’ Not like before, anyway.
Draco kissed him on the lips and whispered, “Just don’t take too long to come back. And please, call me.”
Hermione seemed to be in a state of shock when he told her about Lucius’ resurrection and the group he had gathered to transform Nathan into some sort of superman.
Knowing my father I knew he expected Scorpius to succeed where I had failed. However, I did not expect the same of my son. All I wanted was for him to have fun and be happy. It didn’t matter if he wasn’t the Seeker of the year. I didn’t even care if he didn’t make it into the team. What I really wanted was for him not to feel the weight of being a Malfoy.
I didn’t want to let go. I wanted to be held by Harry forever. Harry tenderly stroked my face, then our eyes met. Slowly, our lips touched. It was such a sweet kiss I felt like crying. There were so many things I wanted to ask him, most of them connected to Ginny Weasley. It was clear to me their marriage wasn’t going well. Harry was not the type of man who would be kissing me if he was happily married.
“I hate those bastards!” he yelled. “How can they ask me those things? How can they think that about Harry? Harry was never a Death Eater. He saved them from Voldemort and this is how they repay him! This is why I vanished! I can’t stand reporters and…” he stopped talking when Nathan entered the living room.
Draco caught the pashmina scarf that was on the bed and circled Harry slowly until he was behind him. “Can I put this on you?” Draco muttered in Harry’s ear.
Nostrums frowned, upset. “Oh, please. I only chose this look because I thought that if I looked like Harry Potter, you wouldn’t have the courage to hurt me, and it would be easier to destroy you.”
“He’s lost four patients because of complications during birth, but that’s because they didn’t follow Dr Jules’ advice,” Draco guaranteed. “Dr Jules told me most of them tried to get pregnant on their own and afterwards they didn’t want him telling them what to do.”
“Yes, of course,” The Minister called three guards that were nearby and ordered them to lead everyone to a safer place.
“Now that’s not true!” Draco objected. “She only steps over Harry. I’m trying to discipline her. It’s Harry who’s spoiling everything!”
“He calmed her down. But Harry, please let Neville take a look at Nathan, just to be sure he is really ok.”
The morning was cold and grey. Unfortunately, the cloudy sky and the freezing wind stopped me from having breakfast in the solarium as I usually did. Instead, I preferred to remain inside where it was warm but as sombre as my mood. I wasn’t hungry, but breakfast was a necessary ritual. Besides, I needed to eat something. I knew that if I didn’t I’d only feel worse later on.
I felt chills down my spine. The old Death Eaters couldn’t obviously get together. They were all dead or in Azkaban. Burke wasn’t talking about the old bunch, but the next generation. Sons and grandsons of ex-Death Eaters. Were they the gang of wizard orphans Harry wanted to help so much? Was Harry in the Club because he knew something was not right? I felt so stupid. Harry knew, of course. He didn’t do anything without a purpose. I bet he followed me and pretended to help me to see if I’d say something. Harry Potter was a bastard. He was always a step ahead.
“They failed in the past, didn’t they? Just because they have a different name now it doesn’t mean they’ll succeed. I don’t believe in any of them. But most do. Some of the boys... Well, some need protection. And they’re very angry... But I won’t surrender. I don’t need anyone!”
“Is she your mum?” I asked. When he answered me with a positive nod, I went on, “She was very pretty. You look like her.”
Goyle and Crabbe had been my thugs in Hogwarts and nothing more. Crabbe had let the Dark Lord’s power go to his head and he ended up dying. Goyle had been a little less idiotic. After the war, our parents had lost touch. Goyle’s father was sent to Azkaban while my father managed to get away with it, as usual. That was one of the reasons we were called traitors. The other one was because we had failed in pretty much every mission the Dark Lord had assigned us with. The fact that I'd saved Goyle's life didn’t seem to matter. Or perhaps it did. Perhaps that was why he hadn’t hexed me yet.
Draco thought of telling her about Lucius, but he didn’t want to worry her. Narcissa would probably have a heart attack if she heard that her ex-husband might be alive and was the Minister of Magic nonetheless.
He was curiously calm, whereas I was almost foaming. Deep down I knew he was enraged. The adult Harry Potter hid his true emotions under a cold façade. But I knew the real Harry. I knew he was hiding a lot of passion under that cool Auror exterior. I wanted the out of control Harry back, the one I had in my arms.
‘No problem. I can solve this by a flick of my wand. But I have to warn you. You might end up naked.’
"I have a lot of compromising papers in my possession. I stole them from the Death Eater’s files when I ran away."
“Yes.” Harry sighed heavily. He was obviously upset. “You really don’t know anything about it, Malfoy?”
The old Burke was still alive, and he came from the backdoor when he heard someone entering the store, but he stopped when he saw me. He blanched, and I thought he would turn his back on me and run away. However, and surprisingly, he limped towards me, his shoulders down, one eye was completely taken by cataract. I think his greed was stronger than his distrust.
Harry was very satisfied with his life. Voldemort’s old minions and Nostrums were all gone. The wizarding world was finally at peace – at least for the time being. Even though there could be new problems ahead, Harry had his family to take care of now, and they were the only ones that mattered. He would take his time to love Draco properly. No more petty jealousy or fights over silly things. They all deserved happiness and some time off from the world’s problems.
Harry ran his fingers through his black hair and sighed. The stranger held him from behind and kissed Harry’s shoulder tenderly.
I waited for more, but father’s silent let me uneasy. If he wanted me to squirm, it was working. His piercing eyes made me want to confess everything to him. I was about to do so when he ended our conversation.
“Someone to love. Most demons were once sacred beings, Harry,” Harry frowned at the mention of his name instead of the usual ‘daddy’. “What I could gather from Nostrums’ feelings in the past was that he wanted to be loved but was afraid. His fear eventually turned into hate, and hate into irrational anger. My job was to bring back his human side.”
I felt my face burning. My hands clutched his shirt and I sighed. Denying the obvious would get me nowhere. Confessing, however, was more difficult than I had imagined. The words got stuck in my throat. I could feel them wanting to get out, wanting to be heard. I would love to know the effect they would have on Harry. Unfortunately, I was still not brave enough.
And then there was Draco Malfoy. Dean was terribly jealous of Draco, not just because he had been Seamus’s boyfriend, but because Draco hadn’t been as easily scared by Seamus’s past. Dean hated him for it. He hated the fact that Draco had been stronger than he was.
Looking at Alfred, I noticed that he was as shaken as I as if only now he was also realising that he was my son.
“That’s the point, Potter. He did show up, but he’s probably weak, so he must be using someone to do his dirty work until he’s strong again.”
“Fuck the concentration! I want you inside me and I want it now! I won’t hold much longer and if you don’t do something about it I’ll have to take drastic measures,” Harry said with a serious expression.
“The girl is right.” Dursley pointed out but instantly shut his mouth as Harry stared at him with a threatening look.
That was the truth. Before the incident with the Death Eater rebels, the Daily Prophet had only written nice things about Harry. Well, as nice as the Daily Prophet could be. But after the incident… Harry almost grunted in distress. After the incident, he was considered a suspect.
“All right. But I’ll just drop you there. I have some things to do and some people to talk to. Like Ginny... And I think Harry shouldn’t be left alone so I’ll get back to stay with him.”
"What about you? I mean, not so long ago you were talking about running away with your son and leaving me behind and now…"
“Narcissa will be delighted to have a grandson. Because it will be a grandson. I hope Potter is treating you all right and that you are eating properly. You have to eat properly, Draco. Think of a good diet, with all the right food and the right vitamins. I can provide you with the vitamins if you allow me,” said Lucius.
“No! You listen!” Draco cut him off. “I’m tired of this, Harry. You don’t trust me, that’s more than familiar to me at this point! But–”
That was undeniable. I was actually envious of how clever my father was when it came to breaking the law. I’d tried to be like him, but I’d failed miserably. Nowadays I couldn’t care less about that kind of lifestyle. I didn’t wish for fortune, power or fame anymore. I didn’t wish for glory or the wizarding world at my feet. Nope. All I wanted was Harry Potter.
Draco only nodded before pulling Harry on top of him and kissing him breathlessly. They were about to take off their clothes when someone knocked on the door. Harry sighed, frustrated. Draco didn’t look so happy about the interruption either. They talked about the possibility of not answering the door, but Harry was expecting news from the secret operation and so they stood up, rearranged their clothes and went to get the door.
I sighed. I felt drained. I sat on the nearest armchair and covered my face with my hands. Astoria got worried and she quickly came to sit next to me. I had to let her know about my impulsive decisions. And so I did.
Dean looked at him with doubt. He wanted to believe Draco, but couldn’t. His sixth sense was telling him otherwise. It had been sending him warnings ever since the first day Seamus hadn’t shown up at his door, but he had been too stubborn to go after him right away. It would be his fault if Seamus was hurt. If only Seamus had told him the whole truth about his past…
As the conversation went on, Draco took the opportunity to observe Harry. He knew Harry wasn't fine about that key; that the curiosity was getting to him big time, but he didn't know why Harry kept delaying it. Of course, they'd been travelling. But he could have seen what was in that vault before their trip.
The moment Draco walked out of the door, Harry fell apart. He buried his hands in his hair and cried. On the other side of the door, Draco was doing the same thing.
“Nostrums was one of the worst demons of the Middle Ages,” Hermione began. “His recreation was to cause wars among humans, or what he liked to call the ‘inferior species’. The only one he was afraid of was a man named Toledo, who was a Spanish monk. Toledo and Nostrums fought against each other many times, and their last battle was terrible for both. Toledo was actually a wizard, and he managed to lock up Nostrums in a magical ark. But a faithful servant of the demon killed Toledo and stole the ark. The servant knew nothing about magic, so he didn’t open it. But he guarded it, hoping that someday his Master would be set free.”
"Nope. I tried to do everything by myself but everything turned out to be a disaster. I’m not very good at this cooking thing and I absolutely loathe kitchens. I’m sorry, Drake." Harry made a disappointed face and then he joked, "But I think that if you look close enough you’ll find something almost eatable."
By the time I opened my eyes again, I realised I was lying in a king-sized hotel bed. My whole body ached. I turned my head carefully to find Harry near the window glaring at me with what looked like murderous intent.
“Are you ok?” he asked worriedly, sitting next to Draco and measuring his temperature with his hand.
Later on, when Nathan was sleeping in a bed that had belonged to Bill, Percy and then Ron when they had been kids, and leaving Brutus with Nathan, Harry went after Draco and found him at the attic immersed in a sea of papers. Draco was reading a very old parchment and Harry wondered what that was all about.
"What? Why are you looking at me like that? I have nothing to do with it! Besides, who am I to deny anything to a child? Look at him, Harry! Those green eyes are the downfall of us all! He’s enchanting!" Hermione defended herself.
So they had confiscated everything. Astoria hid that fact from me. Needless to say, I wasn’t happy. My father would be even less.
“I’m not. Honestly, Harry, I could prescribe something else, but I don’t think you need it. What you need is to count to ten and take a deep breath. Camomile tea is the best thing in the whole world to calm a wild spirit,” Neville grinned. “Try it. If you feel like you have to take something stronger, then I’ll give it to you. But for now, I don’t think it’s necessary. You should learn to be patient.”
My other concern was Harry in the other room. It wasn’t much as a concern as it was a torment. I glued my ear to the wall without even realising it. I thought I heard something, a kind of a soft moan. Or perhaps my imagination was just running too wild.
Hermione came into the living room a few minutes later with John. The Weasley’s older son was quite different from his little brother and sister. Although he had red hair, he was a lot more like Hermione. He was as smart as she was and since he already knew how to read, he was always found with a children’s book in his hands.
“Idiot. I’m fine,” I assured him. I led his hand to my pulsing prick. “Do you think I would be this excited if I wasn’t ok? Magic makes me tired, Potter, not sex.”
It took a while to convince Harry, but after a while, the raven-haired man followed Saulus out of the room with Lucius by their side. When they were comfortably sat on a large couch in Saulus’ office, Harry said, “I hope this conversation doesn’t take too long because I still have to find Draco.”
Astoria and I talked about our intentions with Angel and Alfred. Angel’s amazing green eyes sparkled brightly as he listened to the idea of becoming our son. Alfred, on the other hand, seemed rather taciturn and disbelieving. I couldn’t blame him. He was a teenager after all. Besides, his life hadn’t been easy. Adults were not to be trusted in his world. To make matters worse, I was an ex-Death Eater.
‘If I wanted you dead I would have left you in the Room of Requirement. And stop being a smartass. Just shut up.’
“I don’t understand how you opened it… It was supposed to be sealed with the most powerful magic there is.”
I forgot about everything else when a rather thick letter came to my attention. It was from a friend of my grandfather who had spent his vacation in Egypt in 1930. But before I could read it, my hiding place was rudely invaded.
They waited for Nathan to draw the name he was seeing at the bottom of the page eagerly. It took a while, but when Nathan was finally done, he looked at the adults with a victorious smile on his face. Harry and Draco smiled back at him.
“If it isn’t the Dark Lord, Potter, then who is it?” I asked when he was with his hand on the knob ready to open the door.
When Harry opened it, Hermione was standing on the doorway looking rather tired. She stared at them with a sad expression. Harry instantly pulled her inside and closed the door.
He sat down again and hid his face in his hands. “I didn’t know any of this. I knew he’d been Lestrange’s lover and that he’d used that to find out about the Death Eaters’ plans, but I never really knew how deep the story went. He never told me. Why didn’t he tell me?”
“What a bunch of crap! You wanted to save me?” Nostrums asked. “You’re such an idiot, Toledo. It’s impossible to turn a demon into a human.”
Harry looked at me as if I was the most idiotic person in the world. He walked toward the bedside table and got his famous holly wand. Then he pointed it at his bruise and healed it without uttering a single word. Harry was still young and yet he could already be compared to Dumbledore. He was amazingly powerful. It fascinated me to think of how powerful he would be when he was older. Unfortunately for me, I would have to follow his greatness through the newspapers, if I lived long enough that is.
“All right, then.” They stood up and Hermione got ready to leave with Dean when she turned to Draco and said, “What about you? Do you want to come with us?”
The next couple who called their attention was Dean and Seamus. Seamus had told Draco that it had been difficult to convince Dean to come to the wedding as his date. Dean was still mad at Seamus because the sandy-haired man had hidden many secrets from him, not to mention the whole episode with the Polyjuice potion and the fake Draco. But Draco hoped that they would get back together that same day because Dean seemed really jealous of the closeness between Bill Weasley and Seamus. Right at the moment, for example, as Bill got closer to them, Dean gripped Seamus’ hand firmly in his own and glanced at Bill with distrust. Yes, they would get back together pretty soon, Draco just knew it.
Inside the cell, Harry and Draco watched them fight with his eyes open widely and their heads almost glued in the bars, horrified with the entire situation. They heard Remus cursing under his breath and then some guards appeared out of nowhere to put an end to the fight. In a moment, Sirius and Severus were broken apart and to everyone’s distress, they were locked up with Harry. Now there were four people inside the small space and Harry wondered if that could get any better.
Draco didn't reply, even though he felt his anger stick in his throat. He didn't want to ruin the night for Harry. But from that moment on, Draco had a hard time hiding his desire to break Bob's neck and Harry noticed it. It was obvious that Draco didn't like Bob at all and as Bob kept up the façade of the nice guy, Draco felt even more irritated than he already was.
Draco flinched as he saw him, too, and he took a step back. He was ready to leave again when Harry walked towards him.
Their lips eagerly tasted one another. Their tongues battled endlessly, invading each other’s mouth, savouring each other’s lips. Soon their tongues got in and out of their mouths, imitating the most intimate act that two people could share together.
To my utter disbelief, I felt a stroke on my left hand. My heart went mad in my chest. My breath quickened. I wondered as I looked into Harry’s eyes what that touch in my hand meant.
Harry crossed his arms, annoyed. Bob was telling the truth. Harry, indeed, had hidden information from his department, mainly because he used to think that, if it was his investigation then they shouldn’t know. But hearing Bob accuse him like that made him blush slightly.
The child opened the little box and the chocolate frog gave a leap, landing on Nathan’s head. His crystalline laugh echoed on the large corridor, followed by Draco’s. Ginny hid a smile under her breath.
I snorted and refused to shake hands with her. What was the salary of an Auror anyway? Couldn’t they afford a more habitable place? Was Harry really serious about spending the night with that… that… awfully attractive woman?
For now, I’d rather focused on my music. Perhaps I could get some answers from it. I was hoping each note would bring me some inspiration if not oblivion from everything else. A sudden noise distracted me. I looked around and found Angel observing me with his big green eyes. He looked startled to have been caught spying. I smiled.
The tip of Neville’s wand changed its colour from yellow to green and glowed throughout the bedroom. Neville sighed, continuing his mute examination. Harry thought about saying something but Hermione shook his head. Neville shouldn’t be disturbed.
Draco giggled. “As I said, be patient. Now, drink this.” Draco kissed him again and shared with him another kind of liquor that burned down his throat. He loved the sensation. “Did you like it?”
Plus, Lucius had been responsible for his pregnancy. He had made it possible. Harry knew that Lucius didn’t do things unless there was a personal gain for him. What if because of that Harry asked him something that he wouldn’t be able to answer? What if Harry asked him to have an abortion?
Draco and Hermione were impressed by how much Nathan ate. Draco blamed the Dursleys for that. He remembered when Harry had told him that the Dursleys had always given him leftovers or just old bread with a small piece of cheese to eat. They must have been doing the same thing with Nathan. The poor child was starving! No one could blame Harry for losing his mind the moment he had found out that Nathan had been living with those awful Muggles.
"I couldn't show any interest in you. You were too close to the enemy. Lord Voldemort could have hurt you."
Harry looked at me again. He seemed to be looking for something. I guess he found it because the next thing he said was, ‘I hope you know what you’re getting into. There will be no turning back.’
Draco didn’t stay too long inside the courtroom. He suddenly felt his heart compressed and Nathan appeared in his mind as if calling him. Quietly, he left the room and was met by Nathan the moment he stepped outside the door.
Remus smiled at the truth and Sirius didn’t know if he should feel annoyed or proud. His Mansion was one of the safest places on earth.
The tepid water ran over my body and relaxed my sore muscles. I was certain I’d fall asleep immediately once I settled my head on the pillow. I wasn’t wrong. I woke up with Astoria shaking me delicately. Her beautiful face looked worried.
Draco looked at him way too stunned to say anything. The words seemed to be stuck in his throat.  He felt the world spinning around him and the floor suddenly disappearing from underneath his feet. He should have known that Harry would do this to him one day. He just wished it wasn’t on his birthday. He felt like someone suddenly ripped his heart out of his body and had thrown it away. But he wouldn’t cry in front of Harry. If there was one thing he still had, it was the Malfoy’s pride.
“You’re not helping, Bob!” Draco snapped. “I can’t believe Harry and Ron didn’t know it wasn’t you.”
Draco pulled a disagreeable face. “You’re such a kill-joy. I don’t know if I’ll be in the mood later,” he complained, remembering the spoil brat from the old days. Harry kissed his cheek.
Once upon a time, there was a child born with wonderful, talented and special magical skills. He was destined to be the hero of the wizarding world, the boy who would face evil over and over without knowing dread or desperation. He would grow up to do great things.
“No.” Harry got next to me. He looked exhausted. “I came here because I need to make some things clear. I don’t know exactly what you’re planning...”
Harry didn’t say much. He just listened, and when he finally said something it was in such a low voice that I doubted even Ginny could hear him.
They entered the room holding hands, looking for each other’s comfort. The first thing they saw was Nathan’s smiling face. Harry carefully held him, his eyes filled with tears.
“All of the candles, crystals and flowers have a meaning, Harry. But I’ll tell you after you put something on.” Draco pulled something out of the closet and handed it to Harry. “It’s a silk black robe. I want you to wear it.”
"Are you sure? I feel like I’m dying. My head aches and my stomach is a wreck. I think I’m going to throw up," he whined. "Merlin, I need a bath. I stink. Can you help me with that, Harry? I don’t think I can walk."
Draco smiled and leaned to kiss him. They ate without talking much and when Harry was washing the dishes, Draco enlaced his waist from behind and nuzzled his shoulder. Harry almost let the dish he was holding slip off his hands.
"Ok, kids, drop it," Hermione said in a motherly tone. "Harry, ever since your wedding day I've wanted to ask you something. What was the key Dumbledore left you? I was curious when you told me about it."
Harry kissed Draco, wakening the dragon’s desire once again. But just when Draco felt his body burn, Harry got out of bed all of a sudden and said as he left the room, “I’ll just check on Nathan and I’ll be right back. Wait for me!”
“We didn’t exactly fight,” Harry said sleepily. “Wait a minute. Does that mean that sometimes you pick fights with me on purpose?”
“What’s done it’s done, Brutus!” Draco answered, irritated. “We can’t go back now. In fact, I don’t have much time. I need to find Seamus before Harry wakes up.”
Harry glared at him. “Oh, no, you won’t! We’ve had this conversation before, Draco. It’s not your fault! They’d have asked for my head even if you weren’t with me. It’s not you, it’s me. They fear me, they always did.”
He had moved to the couch, which proved to be another stupid idea. ‘He told so many of his fears, hopes and dreams as we lay side by side on this couch… And that bookstand… he helped me putting it together. It was so funny. He lost his patience and he used his wand to put all the pieces in the right places. He used his wand… It’s so rare to see him doing that.’
Draco opened his eyes wide at the news. “Hermione is pregnant! I knew it! All her mood swings were very suspicious.”
“Good morning, darling. I hope you’d slept well. It is not like you to sleep until late, and for a moment I was quite worried. But Harry Potter was a sweetheart and told me you were perfectly fine and that I should just let you rest.”
“I need to speak with you,” said Harry looking straight into Alfred’s eyes. “Your name’s Alfred, right?”
When they arrived the town was quiet and asleep. It was past midnight, after all. Everybody was saving their energy for the big feast tomorrow. It was all the more perfect for Draco, who managed to get into Harry Potter's house unnoticed.
How was he going to tell Harry? How would he explain if he didn’t know? It was the worst timing ever to tell Harry he was pregnant. Their lives were in danger. A new Dark Force seemed to be regaining its powers. And there he was, Draco Malfoy, pregnant with Harry’s child.
In spite of his frustration about not meeting his father yet, Nathan was having the time of his life. Hermione had left him with the Weasley family and their house seemed like one big, magical playground. He watched, amazed, as the plates, cups and pans washed themselves and the weird little creature sneaked under the table looking for something. He called Mrs Weasley and pointed at the creature, asking her what it was.
“Well, she’s not sure; that’s why she didn’t say anything to anyone yet. Ron told me this in confidence and now I’m telling you, Mr Potter.” Harry winked at his husband. “So let’s eat the cake because that would make her happy and then we can enjoy our honeymoon.”
They stared at each other fuming, each one wanting the other to give in first. Draco usually did just that, but now he was determined not to do it. He was resolute about protecting his family at all costs.
“I forgive you,” Draco said with a smile. “But only if you keep me company for the rest of the day.”
Astoria hugged Scorpius and I saw her eyes filled with tears. She was actually managing to hold herself together really well. I smiled as I saw Scorpius quickly escape from her arms. He was, after all, a preteen. It did not look good to have his mother hugging him like he was a little baby.
“I think that maybe Draco is right. Bob is acting very weird. Look at the way he behaved yesterday. He tried to provoke you into doing something wrong to Dursley. Besides, in front of us he acts like a good guy, but after all the tumult, he vanished. Today I caught him talking to a reporter from the Daily Prophet and believe me if I heard it right he wasn’t saying good things about you.”
Finally, they sat at the table and before the food was served, Ron, who was the best man, made his speech, “I remember the first time I saw Draco at school. He was an insufferable git and he offended my family and me.” Draco flushed from head to toe. Harry kicked Ron under the table. “But look at him now. He’s a new man, and I dare say that he actually likes me, even though if you ask him, he’ll deny it ferociously.”
He was about to take down the spell that was holding the magical dimension when he felt dizzy. He blinked a few times but everything seemed out of focus. His memories as Toledo were starting to fade away, and he was coming back to being just Nathan. He leaned against a tree and closed his eyes. He knew what would happen. His body was too young to handle such a strong power. It needed some rest.
“You know what you have to do. But you won’t do it, will you?” asked Draco with his eyes filled with expectation.
“Maybe I don’t know what you’ve been going through, Alfred, but I’m also an orphan,” Harry said looking at Alfred. “I never met my parents. I know how you feel.”
“Of course you didn’t know,” Nostrums pointed out coldly. “How could you? You’re such a hypocrite. You accuse me of being afraid of love, but you, as a Mage, can’t fall in love. You’re forbidden to feel such a powerful emotion for someone. It would be distracting and dangerous... So you don’t really know what love feels like.”
“I was a wreck, too!” But a pang crossed his heart as he thought of Draco feeling depressed because of his misjudgement. “Was he really that bad?”
That exact moment, they heard the door slamming and Brutus running to greet Harry. Draco entered the living room a few minutes later, looking at Bob with an unpleasant face. Seeing his owner’s belligerent posture, Brutus growled at Bob.
Draco frowned. “Lee Jordan? What–” Draco looked thoughtful for a moment, and then he opened his eyes wide. “Open the door, Jonas.”
“I know what the truth is, Mr Dursley,” Horace said in a cold tone of voice. “Unfortunately my personal judgment of the situation can’t help Harry at the moment, but the child will stay with his husband till further notice.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know, Potter,” I cut across him quickly. I really didn’t want to hear his passionate speech about the wonders of the Ministry of Magic. “If you don’t take the Death Gang into consideration, I guess our world is indeed safer with you in charge of the Aurors Squad.
Harry didn’t care for any of those things. He was too busy paying attention to the man that was beside Draco. The same man that had kissed his boyfriend in front of him. The bastard! He had nerves!
“Can we talk about this later? I’m not ready for this. Let’s go to the Weasley’s house to see Nathan. Then we can talk later. God, we’re so stupid...”
“You have to subscribe to the Daily Prophet, Harry,” she said. “It’s important to keep yourself well informed about what’s going on in the community.”
“What? Become a Death Eater’s whore?” Draco smirked and Harry nodded. “No, I didn’t. I would never do it. I honestly don’t know how Seam did it. Lestrange was disgusting.”
“I’m not overprotective,” Harry said crossly. “I just don’t think it’s very healthy for a kid to have a tour in a hospital. And you do need to rest. I’m just trying to look after my family…”
“HA! You’re screwed!” shouted Dursley from the door, “I knew you would end up in jail sooner or later! And Nathan will stay.”
I was shaken, though. Harry’s green orbs were now as cold as ice. However, as I stared at him intently, I realised things were not as they seemed. I was almost positive that he was as shaken as I. The difference between us was that he was much better at pretending to be fine. I, on the other hand, could not stop my hands from trembling.
“Yes, exactly! Nostrums knew her as Lily, and I want her to have a fresh start. I’m not sure if I believe in all this reincarnation thing, but… Just in case, I think she deserves a new beginning. So I decided to call her Hope.”
“That’s not true! They like you, Draco. For Mrs Weasley, you and I are like her eighth and ninth son. Every time I meet Mr Weasley at the Ministry, he asks about you. ‘How is that nice husband of yours?’ he used to say. And Ron... Ron considers you a friend. He still jokes around because, well, he’s Ron. But he trusts you. He thinks you’re right about Bob. Sirius and Remus like you, too. And Nathan said to me that Uncle Drake is cool. Well, you know how the youth is,” Harry joked.
Draco thought to himself that no matter how much you prepared your heart for a situation like that, you were never fully ready to confront it. He would die if Harry did something like that to him.
But now, seeing Seamus just a few steps from him, he wasn’t so sure anymore and it wasn’t because he didn’t love Seamus. It wasn’t about Seamus’ past anymore. Dean had pretty much cleared that up with Draco and he was more resigned about what had happened. He still didn’t like it, but it wasn’t as if Seamus had had a choice.
He decided to take a bath first and talk to Draco later. But as the day went by, he didn’t find time to talk to Draco alone. Nathan was always with them and later on, Ron and Hermione dropped by to tell him the latest news about the Ministry. Hermione asked him about Draco and he told her that he had gone to the ice-cream parlour but he would be back soon.
"I mean," he tried to fix it. "I didn’t expect you..." he stopped talking. He was looking guiltier by the minute. "Look, Harry, whatever you think it was happening between Seamus and me, it wasn’t! Seamus was just..."
"So Mr Malfoy, what seems to be your problem?" asked Saulus sitting on a large leather chair behind his oak table.
Harry came back minutes later and attacked him on the bed. While they kissed and started the game of seduction and love all over again, Draco couldn’t help but think that this time nothing would be in their way. The future was ahead of them and as long as Harry was by his side he would face it bravely.
It was probably true, but I didn’t pass out that easily. Well, maybe just once or twice a week. I made a face.
“I’m not a violent person. Besides, Draco knew Harry wasn’t out of town for real. Actually, he spent the entire day expecting you, Harry.”
“Ah!” Bob made a face. “This story gets better and better. It makes sense. Harry isn’t the evil type. I should have suspected something… Well, I’m kind of slow to get things… Ron was always joking about it. He said he didn’t know how I graduated as an Auror in the first place!” Bob winked at him.
Draco was finally ravished like he wanted to be. Harry lay down on top of him and kissed his sensitive spots. Draco threw his head back when Harry took his erection in his mouth and gripped the sheet when Harry filled him. Harry still tried to take things slowly, but Draco moved his hips faster.
Harry was staring at me with such intensity that I was finding it difficult to have any coherent thoughts.
A hand steadied him, and Draco thought it was Fred. But as he turned, he was stunned to see the same face he’d hated ever since their first meeting. It was the same person that had attacked him in Flint’s house. It was Bob.
Harry entered the closet and dressed in a black outfit. While he was getting back, he heard his friends discussing Hermione’s comment.
“Because I do! I was the one who defeated him! Besides, Voldemort isn’t the one they want it back. It isn’t Voldemort they’ve been worshipping in Matilda Junian’s basement.”
“What happened? You look awful!” She came to my side and put her hands on my forehead. “You have a fever, Draco. I think you should have a bath and then go to bed. I’ll take care of the rest.”
Her rosy doll face blanched. I knew Astoria had hated the war as much as any normal wizard and witch had. Her father had resisted the temptation of being the Dark Lord’s minion, but he’d paid a huge price for his cheekiness. His first-born son had been killed as punishment.
“I think the energy already filled me up entirely and now I have to spend it a little, otherwise I’ll go nuts here.”
Harry took off his own mask and threw it on the floor. “I don’t need this anymore,” he felt like he should explain. “Did you plan all of this?”
“You just said babies all look the same to you!” Harry pointed out without taking his eyes off his baby-girl.
"Do you want a bodyguard?" Saulus asked gently. "I understand that you and Mr Potter have been facing a lot of problems lately. He has a hearing at the Justice Department, right? His kid is in danger."
By this point I was exhausted. Even though I wanted to be able to go on, to ask for more because I did want more, I was too sleepy. My eyes fluttered and my breathing became sound and relaxed.
Draco held Nathan close to him and they stayed that way until the child fell asleep and Draco made a decision about telling Harry. Carefully, he took Nathan inside and carried him to his bedroom. When he got there, his eyes came across Harry’s, who was holding a fairytale book. While Draco placed Nathan on the bed, Harry put the book on the bedside table and stood up.
Harry slowly got closer to him and carefully stroked his face. He said nothing but the glow in his eyes soothed Draco’s heart. They held each other for a long time, each lost in their own thoughts until Brutus’ whining broke them apart.
“Well, Thomas, you’re lucky. Brutus likes you, so that means you’re welcome,” Draco said, stroking Brutus.
"He can’t handle a little competition," Harry said, looking at the dog with a threatening look. "Hypocrite!" he said, still staring at Brutus. "Yesterday he was thankful that I was here to help you and now look at him. Back to our old duel for your attention."
Harry wanted me. That was a fact. There was no way he would tell me since when he had such feelings for me, but what did I care. The biggest problem was Ginny Weasley. I didn’t want to play the jealous lover in the relationship, but I suppose it was too late for that anyway. I must talk about things between us or I would explode.
“You were too harsh with them,” said Hermione. Harry just glared at her. “Well, you were. I know it’s hard, but you should consider the fact that Nathan and Draco disappeared at the same time. Nat must have sensed that something was wrong with Draco and went after him. You know your son is a Mage. He’s sensitive. If he really wanted to go after Draco, no one would have stopped him. He has powers we don’t know about. That was probably why the spells Sirius cast didn’t work.”
“I looked everywhere,” Remus said sadly. “We put spells in his room to warn us in case he got up, but they didn’t work and we don’t know why. He’s not in the house, Harry. We don’t know where he is. I’m so sorry.” Remus had tears in his eyes. “You trusted us to take care of him and we failed.”
Horace had been helping Harry and Ron a lot, feeding them information about how things were going. Horace believed in Harry’s innocence, so he didn’t see the point in hiding important things from Harry, who was one of the best Aurors he’d ever seen in action.
“They didn’t exactly invite me here. Hermione’s been trying to make a speech here for a long time. They finally agreed with the condition that I gave the speech instead of her.”
Lucius gave him another cunning smile and apparated from there before Draco could do something about it.
Nathan couldn’t sleep. He was feeling a great disturbance in the air, but being just a child, he didn’t understand it. Fear was making its evil way into his heart, and when a shadow came upon him, he hid his head into the covers and prayed for it to go away. He didn’t want to be scared. He had made a promise to grandpa Albus, the old man who used to visit him in his dreams, that he wouldn’t be afraid. After all, grandpa Albus had guaranteed that nothing could harm him but fear.
Harry stopped resisting. He hugged the other man and kissed him hard. Soon, every trace of rational thought evaporated. Their bodies found a movement of their own. Harry wanted to possess and to be possessed. But first he would be the one to bury himself inside the other man.
Harry looked deeply into Ron’s eyes and nodded. Then, he pulled his friend closer and hugged him tightly.
“Of course not, Draco! How was I supposed to know that Harry would be in the same street at the same time as I was? It was just bad luck!”
He walked to the window and looked outside. His eyes seemed to get lost in the scenery. Mine took their time to admire his beautiful silhouette against the light.
I didn’t know what I was doing. I was obviously being selfish. If I kept the boys with me, then Harry would have a reason to return. I was a horrible person, but I couldn’t stop myself. In that brief moment with Harry, I had realised a strange improvement in my general state of mind. I didn’t feel so weak and scared. It was as if Harry gave me the strength to get better. I needed him so much. It was a shocking discovery.
“I don’t deny it, but I don’t like hearing you say it. There can be only one attractive man in your life, and that man is me.”
Nathan looked angry for the first time, and if the situation wasn’t so surreal, Harry would have found it amusing. “You forget that I am more powerful now. Maybe I really can turn you into a decent human being in just a few minutes.”
“HAR–” Draco was speechless when he saw Harry standing in the corridor half-naked and dripping water all over the floor. If it had been any other time, that would have turned him on immediately. But with so much to take care of, Draco felt more like going for Harry’s throat. “What the hell? How come you’re not ready yet? We are late!” Draco fumed. “If we don’t run, Nathan will miss the Hogwarts Express!”
It was impossible to control the hasty beating of my heart. I didn’t want to see Harry, but at the same time, I did. If he was there then it couldn’t be a good thing. I bet it had everything to do with the turn of events in Knockturn Alley. Somehow he had gotten word of it. Then again, Harry always knew everything that happened in the wizarding world. There were no exceptions. I still remembered how he knew exactly where to intercept my dragon’s cub and how amused he had been at my audacity.
Ron reddened. "What was I supposed to think by hearing your conversation? Oh, it's huge, Harry. May I blow it?" Ron imitated Draco's voice. "It seemed obvious."
After a few minutes, the potions turned slightly blue and he heard Severus sigh. It was then that the grimaces started.
“Oh, never again,” Draco whispered back. “Just do your job, Potter. I’m burning here. It’s been a long time.”
Harry stared at his best friend’s serious expression as he talked to a calm Neville. Ginny was the one who looked rather embarrassed with the situation, and Hermione was trying her best to drag Ron away from there.
“I didn’t promise you anything,” Nostrums said coldly. “I could easily kill you now that Potter isn’t in my way.” Nostrums pointed the Corona at Nathan. “I can sense a great source of power coming from you. You are indeed more powerful than you were before. But the Corona is still stronger. This time I’m ahead of you. This time I won’t lose.”
“I don’t like it. In fact, it actually makes me more upset to know that! We both know what can happen with spies, Potter.”
I finally let him off the spell and walked to the Hall. The brat walked behind me asking millions of things at once and ordering me to bring him his brother.
Scorpius was absorbed in school work, and by the looks of it, he was making lots of friends. He didn’t mention Albus Potter in particular, but I could tell there was someone he considered more than the others. I knew he would tell me about it when he was ready. The last thing I wanted was to make the same mistakes my father had made. I wanted Scorpius to trust me and see me not as a threat but as a counsellor.
While Draco showered, Harry exchanged his wet sheets for new ones. He sat for a moment, thinking about what Draco had said. He had been there when Harry had duelled with Voldemort. He hadn’t been the only one. There had been a small crowd there that day. Harry hadn’t seen anyone. He only had eyes for Voldemort and the rage that had poisoned his heart.
Harry turned around to face a sleepy but almost recovered Draco staring at him stunned. He bit his lower lip and pulled an innocent face.
But not everything was perfect in his world. Sure everybody loved him. The problem was that he wasn’t loved in the way he wanted to be. His love life was a wreck. All women only slept with him because of his name, not because of the person he was inside. Everyone loved him all right, but just because of his fame, his wallet and his handsome features.
I closed my eyes and tried not to think of Harry, but that was as impossible as stop breathing. I let my feelings overtake me. You see, twenty years ago I had no idea that all that hatred was, in fact, love. I had always hated Harry Potter more than anything. And then, when my health had started to deteriorate and I had to look for professional help, the bastard made me realise that I had actually loved Harry Potter all along.
“Nathan!” he exclaimed, trying to hold back his emotions. Harry wanted to take his son in his arms, but he didn’t know if he was allowed to move Nathan away from the bed. He was afraid of hurting his son. “How do you feel? Are you hurt? Why are you crying?”
With my soul torn, I sat on the piano bench and started to play Rachmaninoff, concert n.2. I let the music flow and overtake me. I didn’t have an orchestra behind me, but I could hear it anyway. I could hear each and every instrument as if they were a part of me. I let myself go hoping that the music would make me forget about Harry and the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about the Book of the Dead apart from what I’d read in some muggle and wizarding books.
My voice simply disappeared. What I actually wanted to do was tell him that he could have my bedroom if he liked. What would he say if I asked him to sleep with me? Better not take any chances. I didn’t know what his intentions were, but I was sure it wasn’t going to bed with Draco Malfoy.
Draco snorted, annoyed that he was so predictable but unable to retort not only because it was the truth but because Harry was stripping in front of him. A naked Harry always worked as a diversion. Harry, of course, knew that very well. Draco hated the fact that his brain was weaker than his body. He wanted to be mad at Harry, he wanted to shout at him for letting him worry, for not calling and telling him where he was all day. But at the sight of Harry’s cute toned butt, he was unable to concentrate on anything else.
‘No. What I want to know is what you have. Hermione told me some wizards can lose their magic with the passing of the time, but those are rare cases. And none of them felt as sick as you.’
By nightfall I was a nervous wreck and I had trouble sleeping even after taking the Sleeping Draught. Surprisingly, by the next day I found myself more energetic and with my head full of ideas.
Harry was not excessively brawny, which pleased me. His body was sculped with perfection thanks to his job. It was a detestable job, indeed. But that job had brought him to my house, and it had shaped his thighs and hips. As much distraught as I was for being ignored, just looking at him was not without its advantages. The way his jeans shaped his buttocks was driving me mad. His eyes were sparkling with glee, obviously for doing something that gave him tremendous pleasure, and this fact delighted me even more.
The truth was a knife deep inside my heart. Hearing those words hurt more than words could say. To my utter humiliation, I felt my eyes wet. I refused to cry. I wouldn’t cry in front of him. I couldn’t.
Scorpius also sent me a letter. We had promised to keep in touch at least once a week. He seemed happy, which made me feel quite relieved. He thanked us for the sweets and biscuits sent by Astoria, and for the Potions book sent by me. Scorpius loved potions. I expected him to be as good as Severus had been on the subject. He was certainly talented enough.
Neville apparated there seconds later with all of his instruments and with Hermione and Ron at his side. He took one look at Draco and made a strange face. Harry took that as a bad sign and he bit his lower lip, nervous.
“Oh, yes,” she said. “But this is normal procedure in male pregnancy. He’ll have to stay in the observation room for a day and just rest. His body wasn’t built for pregnancy so it needs a few days to come back to normal. Dr Jules will explain it all to you. He’s still with Mr Malfoy.”
Draco wasn’t so sure. Nathan was very special. They didn’t know the real extent of his powers. Perhaps he could do something like that and much more. He didn’t understand Nathan’s reasons though. Draco didn’t understand anything anymore. Was Nathan the key to everything? In the few conversations Draco had had with Nostrums, he noticed how obsessed Nostrums seemed to be with Nathan. It was almost as if he feared Nathan more than he did Harry. But that wasn’t possible. Why would a demon-like Nostrums be afraid of a child?
“What?” Harry’s mouth hung open. “What are you talking about? It’s me you want, right? You want me and my powers. You don’t want Nathan. He’s only a child!”
"Draco, please! I'm sorry, alright? You can't just expect me to believe in all of the things you said about Bob! I've known him for two years and he's never made a pass at me! He's a nice person, at least when he is with me. It's hard to associate the person you've described with the person I work with. It doesn't make any sense to me! But if you're saying..."
I leaned against the armchair and closed my eyes. What good would it be to hide the truth from him? Perhaps if I shared a little of what I knew with Harry, somehow we would be closer. Or maybe I should just cast the killing curse upon myself and end with my sorry excuse of a life once and for all.
Harry was completely overwhelmed by the vision of Draco’s beautiful face lost in a state of pure rapture. The most amazing thing was that Harry didn’t even have to touch him the way he wanted.
After a while, Nathan yawned. Draco took him in his arms and carried him to his bedroom. It was weird to hold a child. Nathan was light as a plume and very small. It was nice though to be the one responsible for him. Harry had entrusted him that task and he had been scared at first, but now, holding Nathan in his arms, he was happy that he had been chosen. Nathan was adorable. They had barely spoken and Draco had fallen in love with the child.
Astoria came and sat next to me and let me know how happy she was that her begonias were growing healthily. She loved spending time in the garden. It was her favourite hobby, even if it made my mother snort. According to mum, Astoria was not appropriate for me because she was not a typical rich housewife witch. On the contrary, Astoria kept herself busy. Even though she didn’t work – because that would be the death of my family and hers – she spent a lot of time in our beautiful greenhouse in the backyard. She found it entertaining to dive her delicate hands in the dirt. It made my mother horrified, and I loved Astoria for that.
"Yes." Harry sighed. "I decided that the job no longer appeals to me the same way it did in the past. I can find another job. In fact... I was thinking... McGonagall offered me a job as a professor at Hogwarts not so long ago and..."
‘What?’ he asked. I could see he was annoyed. ‘What is it with that look, Malfoy? You need to eat. The food is great. You should at least take a bite. I promise it won’t hurt your fine palate.’
With all those reporters around, Horace didn’t have a choice but to take Harry away. Harry didn’t complain, the only request he made was that Nathan didn’t see him being arrested. Horace let him stay with Nathan alone for a few minutes, and Harry tried to explain to him that he was going away for a few hours, but he would go back. In the meantime, Draco would take care of him. Nathan didn’t like that arrangement, but he agreed.
He didn't seem bothered in the least. It was obvious he didn’t believe me. Screw him then! I should have kept everything to myself and refused to see him. Then in the morning, the boys would leave and there would be nothing to connect me to Knockturn Alley.
“Yes, I know. And the three members of the Council are dead. It’s obvious that that entire act was a way to murder them and me as a bonus. Dead men can’t talk. Someone is afraid to be discovered. Maybe it’s your father. He was there, wasn’t he?”
"Yes, of course I do." But he was lying. He remembered the exchange of angry words shouted in rage; the pain of knowing he would never see his son again, their wands raised, a thin green light connecting their powers together and that was it.
Harry felt as if he was missing something, but because he didn’t want to think of his five-year-old son’s love life, he decided to shake his head and forget about it. The situation was weird enough as it was.
“It’s ok. I don’t expect him to welcome me,” Dean said, entering the house carefully as if he was expecting an attack.
Harry felt like throwing up. His life was upside down. The story was so crazy and confused that he didn’t even know what to think.
‘Really?’ I felt him breathing down my neck. ‘And how exactly do you intend to do it all by yourself?’
They lay down side by side, stroking each other every once in a while. Soon, desire ran through Draco’s body. It was reminding him that they hadn’t made love the night before. One night and he already missed it. He was an addict, he thought amusedly.
Knowing I was just a tool hadn’t hurt me as much in the beginning, after all, it had connected me with Harry again. It was an illusion that kept me going. It was all an illusion in fact. I was the biggest fool of all. I wondered if Harry had slept with me to keep me docile. Perhaps he was this type of man. What did I know? I didn’t know Harry Potter anymore. He may be the greatest pretender on earth.
“I’ve been thinking...” Nathan’s eyes seemed to be very far away. “I don’t think love is a bad thing. Look at Harry and Draco. They really love each other. I suppose there are some ups and downs, but in the end, they are always there for each other. And love turns out to be the thing that keeps them together. I don’t believe that love is so harmful. I think it’s something that makes everything all right. It saves you in the end.” Nathan took Nostrums’ hand in his and he felt a powerful emotion running through him. He didn’t want to let go. He felt that if he did, he would miss something very important. He felt as if a void would grow in his heart. But he had to send Nostrums to the Temple. He gripped Nostrums’ hand hard and smiled with wisdom. “It will save you.”
A smile escaped my lips and our eyes met once more. Harry looked at me with curiosity, perhaps wondering what I thought was so funny when the subject he was talking about was so serious. I liked the idea that I could still get under his skin. I’d rather have him staring at me crossly than with his usual indifference.
I felt pain and relief at those words. Harry seemed to be feeling the same way. We were shaky, conflicted, guilty, but not regretful. When he was finally gone I stood where he left me for Merlin knows how long. I wanted to scream, to break something, to curse. I did none of those things. Like a sleepwalker, I walked back to the piano and started playing again.
“Your daddy is only being a little overprotective,” Draco stated. “Now come and sit next to me and your sister! I missed you so much! You’ve barely said hello to me today!”
Harry lay his head on Draco’s lap and let his husband caress his hair. “I need to get out,” he said with determination.
I felt like using a Time-Turner just so I could hear their conversation ‘in loco’. It must have been extremely interesting. I just couldn’t picture Astoria telling Harry to go easy on me.
“Things that are none of my business. That’s all I’m saying. If you need anything else, I’m at your service. But I don’t deal with that kind of thing no more, if you know what I mean.”
"Why don’t you tell me about Nathan now? And how do you know that we’re in danger? I mean, you just said that you had no idea about who’s trying to frame Harry!" Draco shook his head. "You’re lying to me! Maybe you’re behind all of this mess! Maybe you want Nat to yourself!"
Eventually, the crying stopped and they all talked, joked and laughed. Nathan, who usually was a quiet child, couldn’t stop talking about all the things that he had learned that day and all the exciting things he had seen. Harry listened to him enchanted and he remembered the day Hagrid had appeared at his door telling all about Hogwarts and magic. Hagrid would be thrilled when he heard about the news that Nathan was alive.
Well, not exactly, but I was suspicious by nature. It made me realise I was being hypocritical. I could not expect a kid like Alfred, who had been through so much, so blindly trust others just because we said he should.
The pleasure in Harry’s green eyes was too much. My body was on the verge of coming hard. The friction intensified as did our moans. I didn’t close my eyes. I kept them locked in Harry’s. I wanted that moment to last. I wanted to die of pleasure in his arms. My hands closed on his. Our mouths crushed in a breathtakingly kiss.
"Why? Well, let’s see why... First of all, you’d never told me that McGonagall had offered you a job! Second, we have never discussed it! Third, you made your decision without consulting me! What about me, Harry? Were you assuming that I would just go with you, no questions asked? Or are you planning on leaving me, is that it?"
I laughed humourlessly. ‘As if I didn’t know… Before you tell me anything else, just remember that I lived the horrors of the war. I know very well how human beings can be monstrous.
Astoria giggled quietly. “I have no doubts about that, Draco, dear. You know, I’ve been thinking,” she continued after a pause, “Why don’t you...”
Hermione started reading and then she laughed. “Oh, my! You’re in deep trouble, Draco. Harry will be worse than Ron!”
We glanced at one another. Harry’s hands held mine like claws. I frowned as I waited for his next move. I was obviously afraid. I had no idea what to expect from that Harry Potter. Perhaps he would simply dispose of the proof of the crime by casting a memory spell on me. As if I would let him erase what had just taken place between us from my mind. There was no way in hell I would let it happen. I would die fighting if I had to.
There was a very ugly scratch on his left arm and the reason for it was right next to Harry, lying smashed to pieces on the floor. He had bumped into one of the grotesque statues that a relative had insisted on giving us for Christmas last year. The statue, which was supposed to represent a naked woman, was now completely broken. I was actually thankful for that as I have always hated the bloody thing. A satisfying smile adorned my lips. One statue down, three more to go.
Oh, yes. My life was fucking superb. I spent most of my days at home reading, trying to eat something and walking around my property with my dogs. Scorpius was certainly missed.
“Of course not!” I lied, but unfortunately, I wasn’t very convincing. He laughed and two cute dimples adorned his face. I felt like glomping him.
The stranger took Harry by the hand and led him to the dance floor. Harry felt dizzy, silly and completely swept away. His emotions were getting out of hand. The stranger wrapped his arms around Harry’s body and pulled him closer, their mouths only a few inches apart. It was a unique sensation that Harry had never felt before.
“Nostrums, you know why I’m here. I came to finish my job. I’ll make you understand once and for all that love is what’s really important in this or any other life.”
Bob sighed. “I just want you to be careful. Maybe I’m wrong and Draco has nothing to do with what’s going on. Maybe he’s not helping Lucius Malfoy. I’m just asking you to be careful. The Unspeakables know about the Lucius and Saulus connection. They have been investigating Saulus ever since he was elected. Saulus is not a good guy and neither is Lucius. I didn’t see Draco with them, but my friend assured me that Draco is helping them somehow. Just watch it, Harry. They think Lucius is behind the Ministry of Justice’s attack. They think he and Saulus are trying to resurrect Lord Voldemort.”
According to his way of thinking, I was an idiot as well. As if that fact was any news to me. Hearing it from the mouth of a brat, though, annoyed me.
“Tomorrow is fine. We have too much going on at the moment. Seamus is a personal friend of mine and I’m worried about him. I have to find him.”
“Oh, that’s total B.S.” Hermione sat by his side. “Harry isn’t the type of guy that plays with other people’s feelings. Of course he loves you otherwise he wouldn’t be with you. Trust me; I’m one of Harry’s best friends. I know what I’m talking about.”
“Well, dear nephew, you must understand that I’m reforming the house – which is why the kid is sleeping in the cupboard – and reforms cost money! I’m improving the house so your son can have a proper room and…”
Harry had also never felt that way before. It was as if a mist of lust had dropped upon him, making him need to be inside Draco as he needed air to breathe. He felt untamed and unruly. He heard Draco’s moan mixing with his own as the sweat dripped from their bodies.
“Oh, no, you won’t! First of all, don’t tell me how to raise my son.” Draco stared at Harry aghast but Harry went on, “Second, don’t think you’ll get away with this. You were stupid and careless, Draco! I can’t believe you went after Saulus like that! Are you insane? You could have been killed!”
I gave my back to him and went to stand next to the window. I felt my face burning. I was so embarrassed I could die. Had he found out about everything? Did he know about my feelings? I put that idea aside. Of course he didn’t know. It was impossible. It would be way too humiliating if he knew about them.
“It’s ok, Harry. I understand.” Ron sat at the chair in front of his. “Are you going to talk to him? Hermione said he was a wreck yesterday and that she will drop by here later to punch you in the nose.”
We stared at each other for a while, and I felt this amazing energy flow between us. There was a fire in the green eyes like in the old days, but I didn’t dare to hope. The attraction wasn’t mutual and never would be. Why couldn’t I just get over it? I was the first to look away.
Draco began to breathe furiously. Every now and then Draco cursed something or someone. Harry was glad that Draco’s curses were directed to the wizard who had invented the preg potion rather than at him.
“That information is highly classified, Potter! Or at least I thought it was... I think you really can’t trust anyone...”
Harry was finally out! After much talking and many threats, they finally released Harry and his friends, but not before paying for bail, which wasn’t unfair since he had threatened bodily harm and had used magic against Vernon Dursley, a muggle. Harry could lose his job as an Auror for that but he wasn’t worried about it. He wanted to see his son. He was relieved to know that Nathan was with the Weasleys. He couldn’t think of anyone better than them to keep an eye on his son. He knew George was spending some time in his parents’ house. He could imagine how much fun Nathan must be having with him.
‘And why do you want the book exactly? To put it in a shelf and show it off to your stuck-up friends and brag about the fact that if you want you can bring anyone back from the dead?’
"Have pity on me, Harry. I’m not feeling so good," he whined a little more, hiding his face in the pillow. "Can’t you be nice to me?"
“I will, sweetie. Don’t worry. Do you want some candy?” Draco took a chocolate frog from his pocket and gave it to Nat, who smiled.
They still gazed at each other for a while though, their heads leaning toward each other at a leisurely pace till their lips met in a gentle kiss.
“One question at a time,” said the voice, annoyed. “There’s a limo at the corner of your street. Take it.”
"No. You’re pregnant. I don’t want you to put yourself in danger!" Ron affirmed. "Let me help Draco."
Draco had thought about discarding his wand for good but he had kept it for emergencies. It had taken all his courage to use it again. He thought about going back to the wizarding world - after all, he would always be a wizard - but he was used to behaving like an ordinary Muggle. Harry was quite surprised at how comfortable Draco was living as a Muggle.
“Maybe from your point of view, but from mine, the world seems pretty fucked up!” Hermione grumbled.
“He’s with Saulus,” Lucius said in a bored voice. “Would you please be kind and pull your wand away?”
Harry invited Draco to dance the first song with him and some women sighed and whispered to each other that the best guys were almost always gay or married already. In the case of the grooms, it was both. During the whole dance, people gathered around to congratulate them. They were sparkling with bliss, and Mrs. Weasley commented that she had never seen grooms looking so happy on the day of their wedding. Fred gently reminded her that she had never been to a gay marriage before, and she just shrugged her shoulders adding that she had watched another gay union in the seventies and that her Uncle Thomas – one of the grooms – had been in a bad mood the entire day. Two months later they had broken up. But of course, that wouldn’t happen to Harry and Draco.
“Actually, since we’ll be working together, you’ll have to do as I say, Malfoy. Otherwise, not only will I have to leave you here instead of taking you with me to Egypt, but I’ll also have to arrest you for contempt. Besides, if you’re not well by the day we have to go to Egypt, I will find a way to do everything by myself. So if you want to challenge me and come after me, you’ll need all the strength you can gather, Malfoy. Having said all that, don’t you think you should start eating? We start training this afternoon. I’m going to the Headquarters now, but I’ll be back after lunch.
Harry got closer to him and stared at Nathan irritated. “What are you doing here, Nathan? I thought I’d told you to go to bed. It’s past your bedtime.”
“I’ll tell Ron about it. I think he’ll listen. I know Ron very well and I think he suspects Bob, too.”
Harry kissed me again and laid me down on the floor. He caressed our members with his hand. The contact was electrifying. I bit my lower lip and moaned.
“Now that I cast my spell on you, half of your powers are dormant, so there isn’t anything you can do against me now.”
I knew what Astoria thought about repressed feelings, but I hoped she wasn’t having any bizarre thoughts like me confessing my love for Harry. As far as anyone was concerned, Harry and Ginny were the perfect couple.
We looked at each other knowingly. It wasn’t really difficult to accept our sons’ friendship. It was just extremely odd to picture it, to say the least.
“If you come with me to the Institution, I can explain things to you better. You can talk to Matthew, too.”
I couldn’t say anything, but at least I wasn’t the only one who seemed to have lost my tongue. Harry appeared to be as lost as I was.
Oh, I knew that. I avoided thinking about it, though. I’ve been losing my powers for a long time. I didn’t know why. No one did. There were theories, lots of it. My psychiatrist, for instance, had a very brutal one involving Harry. But at that particular moment, I didn’t feel like talking or even thinking about it.
At some point I was invited for dinner by Harry and a bunch of creepy Aurors who were heading for a famous Tapas bar of the region. I obviously declined. I couldn’t help but notice the relief in Candelaria’s eyes. The thought of her spending the night with Harry almost broke me. I didn’t believe Harry was that type of person. But what did I know, really?
Harry didn’t seem worried though, to Draco’s distress. “I’m sure Sirius won’t let anything happen to Nathan. I know Eerie is not dangerous. He’s quite cute.”
“Silly dog. This is nothing,” Draco muttered. A drop of sweat fell down his cheek.  “Just go get Harry.”
“Hi, Nathan,” Hermione said in a soft tone of voice, her maternal instincts activated. “Are you hungry? Do you want some hot chocolate?”
Harry nodded. He knew pretty well how busy and stressed out Hermione was now that her baby – John – was born. And he knew just how stressed Ron would be feeling with his mother and his mother-in-law in the same house.
“I’m sorry. I just couldn’t hold myself,” he said, embarrassed. “I remembered those times when you, Ron and I used to joke about them after all no one really knows what they do. They’ve always interfered everywhere. I was just… remembering and… Never mind.”
Draco had been in St. Mungo’s for three days already. He was still recovering from Hope’s birth. Harry had been taken aback the first time he was allowed to visit Draco in his room. His lover had looked exhausted like he was severely ill. His soft face was pale and lacked its usual radiance. The blond hair, always so neat and perfect, was greasy, resembling nothing of the vain Draco Malfoy from the old days. But Dr Jules had assured Harry that Draco’s state was temporary, that all the blood he had lost had been restored, that the site of incision was clean and healing quickly, and that there was really nothing wrong with him.
“How could I be left out of this, Harry? Your son is alive! I wish I’d known sooner so I could’ve gone with you to rescue him.”
While Harry did get on Draco’s nerves, most of the time Draco found him very sweet. Harry knew by heart every medication and all the vitamins Draco was taking, and he always made sure that Draco took them at the right times. Draco bore all this manfully because he would rather have Harry worrying about him than stressing over the daily news in the wizarding world. Even though they were finally living in relative peace, there weren’t any guarantees that a new evil wouldn’t rise again. After all, Saulus was still Minister of Magic, and Lucius was still his lover. But so far, nothing had happened. Saulus was doing a better job than Fudge; there was no doubt about that. As for Lucius, he sometimes sent a postcard from his new hideout, always being careful not to sign his name. Even so, Draco knew Lucius sent them since he recognised the content of the letters. Lucius was always brief but sarcastic. He also sent toys to Nathan, and he was looking forward to his granddaughter’s birth.
“I miss him, too.” Harry stroked Nathan’s soft hair. “Remember the song, Nat? The strength of love is on our side.”
‘Don’t you have more comfortable clothes? Or do you always dress up as if you are going to be invited to a ball at any minute, Your Highness? You’ve always thought of yourself as a prince, haven’t you?’
Harry didn’t seem so happy when he said that. He repeated to himself over and over that there was nothing wrong with Nathan. He was a healthy kid who just happened to be smarter than the others. That was all right. But what if there were side effects to those vitamins Cho had taken? He decided to take Nathan to see Neville. If there was anything wrong with Nat, Neville would tell him. And again, his conversation with Draco would have to wait.
Harry also realised that they hadn’t had sex in a while. Since his body was now relaxed, it came to life as he touched Draco. He flushed slightly for thinking about such things in such a place.
Dean used to get mad at him for that, but deep down he found it very flattering. He knew Seamus was in love with him. He had always known. Even when they were best friends in Hogwarts, Dean had noticed that Seam wanted them to be more than just friends. The problem was that Dean had always been scared about his feelings for Seam. He wasn’t gay; he had dated more women than he could remember. But somehow, Seam had made his way into his heart and that had been terrifying.
Nostrums breathed hard. “I still have the Corona. If you keep pestering me, I’ll break my policy and suck up your energy.”
“I’m sorry, you’re right,” Harry said. “But this is rather serious. Our department, I mean, this department isn’t the only one investigating Lucius. If the Hit Wizards found out that we’re not, I mean, that this section is not co-operating with them, hell will break loose.”
“Nat!” Draco caught the little boy the best he could and Nathan curled beside him with his eyes closed and his thumb in his mouth.
Draco buried his hands in Harry’s messy black hair and watched him take his manhood in his mouth. He threw his head back, allowing his soul to explore the sacred lover’s world. Harry’s tongue seemed to consume all of him. He rocked his hips sensually against Harry’s delightful mouth and came shouting Harry’s name. Harry lay on top of him, placing soft kisses all over Draco’s face. Draco kissed him on the lips. It was then that he felt a lick on his feet. He opened his eyes, trying to clear his mind. ‘Brutus!’ He felt the licking again and he let out a strangled laughter.
“I’m not a coward! I’m ready to face this. I realise we’ll have to know each other all over again. I’ve changed, too. I’m a perfectionist; Hermione keeps telling me that it’s impossible to live with me. I don’t like people moving around my stuff. I have so many annoying habits that I’ll probably drive you mad. But I’m not the kind of man to just walk away out of nothing.”
“If this position has anything to do with sex...,” Hermione seemed thoughtful for a moment and then she added, “Oh, what the hell. I don’t want to know. Just tell me what your damn secret is to keep so bloody calm when the world seems upside down.”
“It’s true,” Alfred said. I was utterly surprised. “I never saw Mr Malfoy before. And Travers called him a traitor in the Alley.”
“You have no idea what he suffered, Thomas. No idea at all. Do you think he chose his path by his own free will? He didn’t. He was thrown into the war because of a boyfriend he had in Hogwarts. The bastard used him for his own sick purposes and left Seamus broken. Did he tell you that? Did he tell you that the only way he found to survive was to put his pain aside and spy for The Order? He was sold to Lestrange by that git that he used to call a boyfriend. Instead of killing himself the way he wanted to, he decided that, since he had access to secret information, he’d make full use of it. He was braver than you were! You chose to disappear in your safe Muggle world. He stayed to fight for what he thought was right, no matter how broken he was.”
Nothing was said. I wanted to verbalise whatever I was feeling but it was impossible. My vocal cords were paralysed. My uneven breath mixed with his. Emerald eyes glanced at my mouth for a second and then at my eyes.
“Not yet,” Draco whispered against his lips, barely touching it. “Drink this.” Draco kissed him and Harry tasted the liquid that was inside his lover’s mouth. It was Harry’s favourite liquor. His head spun and his body almost levitated. All this time Draco hadn’t touched him yet. When the kiss was over, Harry sighed, frustrated. “Be patient, my love.”
She grimaced. “All right, I have a few problems too. Although my twins are younger than your daughter…” She caught Arielle in her arms and Ron caught George. John didn’t seem to notice the turmoil around. The older Weasley only reacted when Nathan came into the room.
'It was all an Illusion charm, Harry. You believed your son wasn't breathing anymore and it wasn't true. All because of a stupid and simple Illusion charm. I did what I thought was right. I reported Fudge to the council, and I'm sure he won't be the Minister of Magic for too long. Don't fear Harry. We'll get justice for you and Nathan! I just hope I live long enough to tell you this. As you know, I'm very ill. But I'll make sure this letter gets into your hands at all costs and...'
“They are not right!” Draco assured. “So you lose your temper from time to time. Who doesn’t? You’ve been through a lot in your life.”
He had practically burst into Snape’s office at Hogwarts through the burning fireplace, scaring the hell out of him and almost getting hexed in reflex. Severus hadn’t liked his surprise visit at first – he had never liked surprises anyway – but when he noticed the shadows in Draco’s eyes, his hardened face had softened a little.
Draco kept whispering erotic things in Harry’s ears until the brunette was lost in pure bliss. Harry thought he would come from only the power of Draco’s voice, which penetrated his senses and made him go wild. Finally, he begged for Draco to take him.
“Don’t you dare!” Nostrums exclaimed. He raised his hands, ready to strike Nathan with a curse, but Nathan was faster. With a flick of his forefinger, he paralysed Nostrums’ body. “What? You little monster! You...” Nostrums called Nathan many different names that Harry had never even heard of.
Draco grunted. “I did! I’m not saying he’s bloody innocent, but I don’t think his purpose is to resurrect Voldemort. I…” Draco stood up and stopped in front of the window. He looked at the calm landscape beyond and sighed. “Oh, screw this! I’m pregnant,” he let it drop like a bomb.
I saw somebody moving outside. A man in a black robe waved at me just to spite me. It was one of the Aurors Harry had left at the Manor the previous night. I swallowed my irritation.
“That Horace guy seemed to like Harry. I think he’ll come back tonight. I don’t think they will have the guts to arrest Harry. I mean, he saved everyone in this goddamned community and he never complained about the task that was given to him. Those Hit Wizards should be helping him, not taking him away!”
Right. The quite young and impetuous Hugh Grey. Strong, tall and extremely polite. Grey was the perfect bodyguard. In order not to get in the way of our routine he made himself practically invisible. The boys seemed to like him a lot. Besides, Grey was not aggressive towards me like the others. It was quite a change for an Auror. Even if I still didn’t like their presence in my house, at least Grey wasn’t unpleasant. Also, Harry seemed to trust him completely, after all, he was one of the few chosen to stay here and keep our secret. The other Auror, a woman named Cindy Sinclair, was also quiet and never seemed to judge me.
“Are you mad?” Hermione said to George. “He’s too young to fly! You could have dropped him! Harry, say something! He’s your son!”
“Then you’ll die faster,” Nostrums sneered. “But before you go, I’ll allow you to look into me, and see for yourself the things you missed, the things you couldn’t or didn’t wish to see within me.”
“Ok, that’s it. Nathan is too young for this conversation,” Harry said with a scowl, obviously jealous of the way the medi-witches were staring dreamily at Draco.
Angel looked at me as if he understood. It was impossible, though, wasn’t it, that a child his age knew what I was feeling. Indeed, Angel was not an ordinary child.
Draco almost knocked his head on the wall in frustration. If he was there, he would know. “And then what?”
Harry avoided my eyes. Was that good or bad? After some moments lost in his own thoughts, he said, ‘Because life is funny that way.’
"I am on my side of the bed. You're being paranoid, Drake. I want a piece of the blanket, that's all. It's cold in here."
I hid my shaken hands behind my back. ‘It’s true. Potter went there to talk about one of the Ministry’s social programs.’
Another child appeared, but it was a teenager this time. He was probably fourteen. He was almost as tall as I and had brown eyes and bleached hair. When he saw the boy attached to the hem of my robe he seemed relieved. His relief didn’t last long. Another figure appeared behind him with the wand ready to strike. I instantly pulled my wand out, and before the hooded person could hit the teenager with what I knew was the beginning of Cruciatus, I hit him hard on the chest with a Stunning spell. The older boy looked at me both with gratitude and doubt. The little one grabbed my silky robe harder and hid his face behind me.
“Me too,” Nathan shouted happily and then shouted again when he saw Draco right behind his father. “Dad two!”
“He didn’t even tell you who let him go, Draco. It was an Auror, right?” Draco nodded and Harry went on, “That’s terrible. If an Auror let him go, he must have had his reason to do so. And again, your father didn’t tell you anything about it. If you ask me, I think this is very suspicious.”
“It turns out that your father is being watched for a while now. The Unspeakables are after him, although I’m not sure why. They think he’s trying to resurrect Voldemort.”
“Then who is it? Don’t I have the right to know? Fuck, Potter! I’ve opened up my house for you! I let your men come and go as they please!”
“No, of course not! It would be great to have a little girl around. I would be terribly jealous though. Nathan is a boy; he will learn how to take care of himself just fine. But a girl... Girls seem to be so fragile, so breakable. They are always crying and they are such a mystery.”
He didn’t know why but he had named his baby girl after Harry’s mother. Lily was a name Draco liked, and somehow, every time he said it aloud, his pain ceased.
“He is and I love him,” Harry stated to make things very clear. He didn’t notice the flicker in Bob’s eyes when he said that.
He was trying to piss me off, and it was working rather well. Bastard! I felt my blood boiling. Why was it that only Harry Potter could make me feel this way?
I couldn’t waste that opportunity to give him one of my Malfoy smiles as I teased him, ‘Why don’t you just come out and say you want to see me naked?’
“You thought wrong! This baby is a part of you and me. I already love him as much as I love you.” Harry took a few steps towards Draco but didn’t touch him. “All that matters is your and the baby’s safety. I don’t blame you for anything. Actually, this baby is a blessing. I never thought we could have a child together. It’s such a miracle!”
“Well, actually… No! Believe me or not, I’m just trying to protect you. You don’t have to believe me, Draco. All you have to know at the moment is that someone is trying to resurrect Voldemort. Someone that can crush your precious Potter, so you better take care of him and yourself. Take him to the same place you took Nathan and stay there until this mess ends. Saulus is trying to find the responsible for the Ministry attack and–”
"I’m talking about Sirius. I knew he loved somebody else but I thought that I could make him forget the person, whoever it was. I couldn’t. That’s the problem with women. They always think they can change a man... You probably know about it, right? About Sirius, I mean. You were there the moment he declared his love for his best friend."
“Voldemort,” I said. The name came out with a lot of effort on my part. I always had the feeling Voldemort would appear suddenly if his name was spoken aloud. In fact, for quite a long time after the war, I had horrible nightmares with the Dark Lord. His presence in the Manor had been too strong, and it’d lingered for many, many years.
“Don’t be a drama queen. Besides, you’re always in the mood.” Harry bit Draco’s sensitive spot near his earlobe than he blew on it softly until Draco shivered. “See? If I do that tonight, you’ll be in the mood right away.”
“You actually did me a favour. But you didn’t have to almost kill yourself in the process,” I added.
Lucius sighed, irritated. “Fudge was a bastard. He betrayed us. I confess we didn’t see that coming. When your son was reported dead, I knew it was a lie. Fudge wanted Nathan to himself. He wanted to use Nathan’s powers in the future for his own stupid reasons. He wasn’t the only one.”
Harry scanned the room briefly. Astoria was still playing with Angel a few feet away. Our eyes met momentarily. I tried to show her I was alright.
Quickly, the blond flipped Harry over until he was under him. He dipped his wet and needy tongue inside Harry’s mouth, tracing a path of fire with it all over Harry’s body. With the tip of his tongue, the blond circulated Harry’s left nipple and then the right one. He took it between his teeth and Harry closed his eyes, gripping the blond hair.
“Most of them don’t know who their leader is, but some of them swear it’s you, Harry. My boss let us use Truth Serum on them, and your name was the only one that came up.” Horace sighed worriedly. “What’s going on, Harry? They want me to arrest you, but I can’t believe they’re telling the truth! I know you. You’re not another Lord Voldemort. I won’t arrest you this time.”
"You’re right. I guess we weren’t ready to deal with our feelings for each other. I know for sure that I wasn’t. I cursed myself so many times after that kiss. But I couldn’t forget."
It didn't matter. Dobby was free and he wasn't even listening to Draco anymore. He was too busy contemplating his new future as a free house-elf.
‘Shit, Malfoy,’ I heard him say with a mixture of irritation and worry. ‘We’ve barely arrived and you’re already like this?’ He sighed as he picked me up as if I was made of paper. Our baggage floated behind us as we walked. I vaguely noticed people on the street as Harry carried me to the hotel. If he was using magic so openly, it must mean we were on wizardry territory. What did I care at this point anyway? All I wanted to do was snuggle against Harry and rest.
“Till then, don’t say a word about this to anyone! We are still choosing the men for the task ahead.”
“You don’t know that for sure.” Draco kissed Harry’s forehead. “Let’s go inside, shall we? Our boy is waiting for us.”
Angel got very interested in two plastic wands that were on top of the coffee table. I let Astoria take him by the hand and give him permission to touch them. Alfred was right beside me, watching everything as if waiting for the perfect moment to escape. Poor kid.
“No, he’s not that kind of person. Many years ago, when I wasn’t worth anything at all, he saved me. I was weak and I was not fighting by his side. I supported the wrong sort of people… Even so, he cared about me enough to save my life.”
He wandered around the hall for quite a while, listening to the soft music the orchestra was playing and watching the couples and their matches dancing, some quite comfortable with each other, some still a little suspicious of the whole thing.
Nostrums shrugged. “What did you expect? I’m a demon, remember? I don’t have feelings. All I want is revenge! Besides, I don’t think you understand, Potter. He looks like a child, but your kid is stronger than you. His exterior is young, but his spirit is very old.”
He sighed and was about to waken Harry when he saw Nathan with the corner of his eyes. He looked at the little child, who was sucking his thumb ferociously and realised that Nathan’s eyes were shining with tears. Draco quickly took him in his arms and held him tightly.
“Your psychiatrist told me nothing,” he said as if he knew exactly what I was thinking. “Besides, how I've found out is irrelevant. The thing is...”
“I told you. You’re not him. You might look like him, but you’ll never be him. Your eyes are darker and so is your soul. Harry has gentle eyes. His soul is pure. Even your scent isn’t like his. He smells of roses and sandalwood. You have no scent. You have no soul. You’re empty.”
I winked and he laughed as if I didn’t know already that he could defend himself very well. Scorpius might look fragile but he was a smart child. Besides, I had taught him a few tricks weeks ago just in case.
Nathan climbed Draco’s leg to sit in his lap. Their eyes locked and Draco felt as if Nathan was reading him.
I made a face. I didn’t want Astoria and Harry in the same room. She knew too much. I was afraid that she would let something slip. Although Astoria was a discreet woman, it was better to be safe than sorry.
“My dad... I don’t know,” Alfred finally said. I guess Harry’s sudden frailty got to him as much as it got to me. “He just disappeared. And my mum... She... She killed herself when I was eleven. You know how it is. The same old sad story. She didn’t have enough money to send me to school, and she didn’t want to accept anyone’s charity.”
Harry did. He smelled a strong sense of sandalwood, and right afterward he smelled Draco’s scent that his nose – and soul – knew by heart. Harry inhaled that smell as if he needed it to survive. He reached out his hand to touch Draco but his lover stopped him.
“I think they’ll like it at first. But don’t mention that place again when they are teenagers. They will hate it,” Draco said, stroking his belly softly.
I wasn’t a religious man, but if there was a God, then I hoped he could freeze that moment in time. Unfortunately, my brain refused to help me speak. I feared that any sounds coming out of my mouth might seem strange and unintelligible, which would only make me look more pathetic.
I wanted Harry more than anything, but I didn’t feel the need to use the children just so I could spend some time with him anymore. Was I maturing at last? I sneered. Better late than never.
My hand finally stroked my cock. I shuddered. I haven’t done that in so long. All I could think of was why not if the pleasure was so intense. Wasn’t pleasure the fuel of life? I have denied myself too many of life’s pleasures.
‘I feel the same way, Malfoy,’ he whispered back. His hand against our cocks speeded up. ‘You have no idea… ah…’
Harry licked his own lips very slowly and the silver-blue eyes followed its movement like he was hypnotized. Harry smiled. He saw the stranger’s red lips smile back. Their bodies slid on the dance floor as they were one. Satisfied and feeling more confident than ever, Harry leaned against the stranger’s body, took off the stranger’s hood and a mass of soft short blond hair with silver highlights were revealed. Harry couldn’t help but bury his hands in the stranger’s hair and afterwards his own face on the stranger’s neck, where he placed a light kiss. The stranger moaned softly and gripped his hands on Harry’s waist. It was clear to Harry that they were losing grip of reality. Harry raised his head so they could be face to face and their eyes locked inside each other. For Harry, the silver-blue eyes were a stairway to heaven.
Nathan seemed very worried. His usual cheerful expression was of deep concern now. That worried Harry a lot. Nathan was used to feeling things that most people didn’t. Perhaps something was wrong with the baby.
The scarf was off, finally. Harry did as Draco said and looked straight into the silver-blue eyes. He held his breath at the beautiful image of Draco Malfoy – now also Draco M. Potter – by the light of the candles and the prisms. Harry was bedazzled. The depths of Draco’s eyes reminded Harry of the wild sea. He was looking savage and so incredibly hot.
“Draco told me you said pretty nasty things to him that day that we went out for dinner,” Harry said.
Draco glared at her. "I never thought you were a quitter. Hasn’t anyone ever told you that just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean that it isn’t there? I believe that there’s something hidden in this parchment signed by Fimcyl and I’ll find out what it is. Its real information must be hidden by Dark Magic of some sort. I can’t remember the spells properly! It’s been a while, you know?"
Harry kissed him hard, his hand avidly stroking Draco’s body. They got lost in each other’s arms for a while, trading kisses and loving words until they both fell asleep. Harry was glad to have taken that weight off his chest. He was feeling lighter but also scared. But Draco was by his side now, and they would fight that battle together. He was finally home.
Harry’s eyes seemed to do the trick because Elisabeth sighed in defeat and let them into her office.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake! Just kiss so Draco and I can go home!” Harry shouted from outside the room. “Nathan is waiting!”
“Don’t, Draco,” Harry whispered as if Draco was a little kid. “Don’t go there. Don’t blame yourself for things you cannot control. You weren’t the one who let Lucius get away in the past.”
‘Yeah, you are an adult. You can take of yourself,’ he grimaced. ‘You are a pain, that’s what you are.’
‘Speaking of the devil…’ Lucius started. I felt my palms sweat. ‘I’ve heard that there’s been a lot of action going on in the Aurors’ Headquarter. And also that you – who would have thought – you talked to Harry Potter in one of Matilda’s meetings.’
I hugged Scorpius for the last time without caring about what the others would think. All I wanted was for my son to know that he could count on me no matter what.
His speech went on for a little more than half an hour. The clapping was minimal and Harry didn’t look very happy with the general lack of enthusiasm. The fact that he was innocent enough to think that he could soften those hearts of stone made me want to jump on to the stage and kiss him. Despite everything, Matilda was of the opinion that everything Harry said had been wonderful, and she promised to donate a large amount of money to his Foundation. I couldn’t understand why Harry needed their help in the first place. In normal circumstances, the bastards around him wouldn’t even look at him. They could barely tolerate Harry. And this was exactly what a reporter from The Quibbler – whose editor now was Luna Lovegood, Harry’s lifelong devotee – asked him.
And he worried. Maybe they had been under some sort of spell. He tried hard to remember everything he had drunk and eaten that day, finding nothing unusual. But then he thought about something. Was the liquid he had drunk at his stepfather’s house just innocent lemonade or was it something else? Even if there had been something in that juice, he decided not to worry so much. After all, full-blown lust in a relationship wasn’t that bad after all.
“Honestly, Draco,” he said after regaining his Malfoy posture. “I would never expect you to be so emotional. Malfoys are not like that at all.”
"Ok. Let's see what's in there," Harry said, trying to ease things a little. "Maybe is a pile of gold." He winked at Draco.
"Don’t say that, love." Draco entwined his arms around Harry tightly. "Don’t you ever say that again."
“I know he won’t, but Nathan has a will of his own. He’ll come after his two daddies. I do have a backup plan, Draco. Your father might have saved Nathan the first time I’ve tried to lure him to my domains, but he won’t be in my way again. My men will attack Saulus Fimcyl’s Mansion in a few days, and maybe they’ll bring me Nathan. The stupid Ministry think they have the situation under control. What a joke!” Harry laughed madly. “But even if Nathan doesn’t come this time, he will come when Colin lures Harry Potter here. Don’t worry, Draco. Your lover will be here soon. If you want to die with him, it’s fine by me. It’ll actually be quite romantic.”
“Don’t forget that this is my house, Potter. Just because you’re Head-Chief of the Aurors it doesn’t give you any right to do or say whatever you feel like. You’re not my boss.”
Returning from his thoughts, Harry shook himself briefly. “Ok,” he sighed. “Hope is a beautiful name. I like it.”
Nathan sighed. “I don’t want to fight. I just want to understand you, and since you gave me permission to look into you, I...”
When Harry stepped away, I felt cold. He didn’t touch me anymore. We kept our eyes on each other as if trying to explain the unexplainable. How could such different people with such a complicated past be so attracted to one another? The puzzle just got bigger as we considered our ages. We were not teenagers anymore. We were grown men. Harry was supposed to be living a dream-like marriage, and his kids were the proof of that. Then why…
Nathan’s tears dried off, but his eyes were shining even more brightly because of it. The green eyes were widely open, making Nostrums more uncomfortable and more aware of the things he had just said. Nostrums pushed Nathan away abruptly and stood up.
The minutes passed slowly and Draco was getting impatient. Brutus howled and he shivered. He had heard once that when dogs howl usually indicated bad luck. He wasn’t a superstition person but now he was having an odd feeling about it.
‘You are not a child anymore, Draco. You can do whatever you choose to with your life. I just that, one the time comes, you choose the side you are on after careful consideration. Your mother sends her love and she expects all of you for Christmas.’
I smiled back at him. I tried not to, but his smile was contagious. How could I resist him? My old wand did make me feel different. Perhaps I wasn’t feeling stronger, but I was definitely feeling more confident. I had my old friend back. I knew that if Harry claimed it, it would come back to him. But right now it had accepted me back, and that should be enough. I gripped it hard.
She stared at me with contempt. For Harry, however, she was all smiles. They began a conversation in Spanish so fast I couldn’t keep up. I did hear my name, though, and Harry laugh. I clenched my fists.
Draco looked at the side of the bed where Harry should be lying and the memories of the night before invaded him. The sensations were so strong they were still marked on his body in every bite and lick Harry had given him.
Close to midnight, Harry woke up with Draco’s cry for help. He turned around to stare at Draco and saw that his lover was sweating all over and sobbing again, as if he was having the worst nightmare of his life. Harry tried to hug him, but Draco didn’t let him.
Draco knew it was for real. He could feel it. He didn’t need a potion to tell him that. But at least now he was certain about it. He put his hands on his belly and smiled softly. He’d never thought he would be a father, let alone carry a child himself for nine months, but he was beginning to get used to the idea. And even though he was terrified about it, he was also extremely happy. He was so confused that he felt like crying.
“I just can’t believe that all that hell is back again,” Bob said. “We fought those bastards and thought it was the end of them all, but they are back! I wonder if this game will ever end.” Then he looked at Harry shyly. “I couldn’t bear to lose you, Harry. You are very important to me.”
Harry had then licked his own mouth in a teasing and mischievous sort of way that set Draco on fire again. Then he had taken the little box of strawberry ice cream into his hands and had opened it.
“We have to find a member of his family that is alive,” Harry said thoughtfully. “We need to know exactly who opened the ark and for what purpose.”
“Really, Draco! That’s great news!” Fred exclaimed, aiming at a hooded man. “Cases like this are very rare. I’ve never met a pregnant man before! I feel honoured!”
“You’re a bit rusty, aren’t you? You need to exercise more. Besides, I’ve promised Alfred to teach him how to control his magic. I think a bit of training will do you both good.”
In the end, Harry thought bitterly, it was all about power, just like Voldemort had once told him. He couldn’t care less about it, but that blind and incessant hunt for power had always chased Harry, and he didn’t know how to get rid of it. He was cursed, that was the only explanation why every time he thought he’d found a place to call home, his happiness blew on his face, and reality came down on him like an avalanche.
“No, and I don’t really care. I just wish to forget everything again, but it seems as if I won’t forget you ever. I tried as a demon and it didn’t work.”
“I know,” Draco cut him off slightly annoyed. “It’s just... Can’t you just stay out of it? For my sake?”
I could hear him walking away and opening the door. I also noticed his hesitation. It was enough to make me turn around and say, “They want the Book of the Dead. That’s how they intend to bring the Dark Lord back. They’re going to use the most ancient kind of dark magic there is.”
“Hermione, I need to ask you a favour,” Harry said. “Come with me to Saulus’ house. Then I want you to take Nathan to Hogwarts and stay there with him. Don’t make him leave your sight! He’s too smart for his own good.”
Maybe he was just curious. My desire for him had become quite clear that day. Who could tell what was going through Harry’s head at this point?  The worst part wasn’t the forbidden desire between enemies. It was the fact that we were both married, with kids. An affair was a terrible idea.
As for Nathan, he was still the same sweet child as he had always been. Nathan was always a source of peace and joy for Harry and Draco. That didn’t mean he was a saint. Nathan played tricks on them from time to time. In fact, Nathan had a predisposition for adventures just like Harry. And like Harry, Nathan didn’t seem to care too much about rules. Draco feared the day Nathan would be sent to Hogwarts, not just because they would miss their son, but because Nathan would definitely get into trouble every chance he could get.
“No buts.” Harry turned his attention to Nathan and asked the previous question again, “Do you want to come with me, Nathan?”
Draco wondered where Harry was. He walked towards the stairs and shouted for him. The house seemed strangely quiet. He had carefully made his way to the first floor when a sudden pain made him double over. He should be used to the pain by now, but he wasn’t. He breathed hard through his nose, telling himself that it would soon stop. He placed a hand on his belly and stroked it gently. He was definitely feeling more sympathetic towards women now.
He bathed Brutus, took a shower himself, and resigned himself with the fact that he would have to sleep without Harry by his side. The doorbell took him by surprise and since Brutus didn’t bark, he felt less worried about who it could be. The door was opened carefully and he smiled as he saw his mother standing there with a mountain of packages.
“What?” Bob chuckled. “You mean, sexually?” Draco nodded, annoyed, and Bob patted his back. “There, there, Draco! I don’t bend that way. Harry is my hero, but I never had sexual fantasies about him. Now, Hermione, that’s another story…”
Indeed. Life was certainly strange. A Malfoy had the power to recover the Book of the Dead and save an innocent kid from becoming Slytherin. A Malfoy who was weak and insecure and that loved Harry Potter.
How strange that his voice seemed so attractive over the phone. I wonder if I should buy one just to communicate with him.
“Yes, you do. Whatever it is you think you deserve from me regarding last night, you probably do,” he conveyed, upset. “It wasn’t planned, Malfoy. It just happened. It was… unexpected and... great, but it doesn’t change anything. There are so many things happening right now, and they are so much bigger than us, that I will need time to process this… this thing… between us.”
Harry crushed the letter in his hand, swearing aloud. He called Ron, who picked up a little after the third ring. Ron sounded sleepy, but as soon as Harry explained the situation to him, he said he was on his way to Harry’s house.
"God, Draco! You’re so hot," he said, kissing Draco’s forehead softly, a worried expression on his face. "What’s wrong with you?" he wiped off Draco’s tears with his thumbs.
“Ernie knew druid language. I guess it was meant to happen…” Colin’s eyes seemed to wander off. “I existed only to open that damn ark; to watch his rising; to be his slave. To love him, just because he looked like you, and he sounded like you. To hate him for that same reason. But not anymore. I won’t serve him anymore. Please, Harry, kill me!”
It was a fact. The boys missed their mother. Astoria was perfect for the part. She was irresistible. Even Alfred had treated her nicely that morning.
Harry got closer to the bed and stared at his daughter sleeping peacefully in Draco’s arms. One would think that she was a little angel. They didn’t know yet how loudly she could scream when she was hungry. Harry watched her delicate features closely and smiled.
With a sigh, he put a hand on his stomach. He hadn’t been feeling so good ever since he had drunk that lemonade in his stepfather’s home. His stepfather… It was really weird to even think that about Saulus.
“Oh,” Harry muttered, disappointed. ‘And why the fuck are you disappointed, Harry? You don’t want to see him again or feel his hands on your body or his lips meeting yours or…’
The following week wasn’t an easy one for Harry and Draco. At the last minute, Harry had decided not to join the secret operation. Instead, he had gone to Draco’s first appointment with Dr Jules so he could be sure that the baby was fine and that Draco’s pregnancy wouldn’t be dangerous.
Harry stared at Nathan for a long time until the Process Server opened the big oak door and invited him in. He glanced at Nathan one more time, kissed his cheek tenderly and handed him to Ginny. Fred stayed with his sister while the rest of the crew walked in with Harry. It would be a very long day.
“You should definitely buy him a broom, Harry. That has to be on top of the list. There are models for children of his age. He’s a natural, I can tell,” George recommended. “I took him out on my old broom and he just loved it. Right, Nat? He’s just like daddy.”
He climbed the back of the bird and clutched Eerie’s feathers not to fall. Eerie was still a baby, but he had grown up quite a lot that month. Eerie was also learning how to fly and was getting quite good at it. When they were close to the pot of Floo, Nathan stretched out his hand to catch some of it. He took a handful of it and his eyes glowed with excitement that soon died away because he didn’t remember how he was supposed to use it.
“What do I know, Harry? Every time we fight is always my fault, right? You got mad at me because of Bob but when you got jealous of Seamus, did I say anything to you? No. In fact, I was scared because, as usual, it was my fault – in your eyes at least! And now you ask me not to tell you how to raise your son. Is this what you want? Because if it is then I–”
"Of course not." Harry winked at him, his eyes shining with unshed tears. "It’s only two days and I’ll write to you."
I often wondered what Harry’s marriage life was like. He and Ginny gave the impression of being the perfect family, the kind that makes one want to vomit. What if it wasn’t true?
Harry got home very late that night. He tiptoed towards the bedroom, trying to keep Brutus quiet. The last thing he wanted was to wake Draco. His husband had been under too much stress lately and Harry didn’t want to make him even tenser by telling Draco what he and Ron had found out.
“I know,” I interrupted him before he could go any further. “I know. But maybe... Maybe I want to find a way to redeem myself. I know I wasn’t a saint, Potter, but neither were you. Not with me at least. You never gave me a chance. Since the beginning...”
My eyes were drawn to the moody teenager that arrived with one of the house-elves fretting behind him. I wasn’t sure whether I should laugh or frown. He certainly looked more presentable that morning. He sat next to his brother as soon as he saw him, and stared at me and Astoria with suspicion. Astoria smiled at him sweetly.
I wish I could say that I managed to say something witty before Harry could go, but it would be far from the truth. I just let him leave without saying anything.
“Draco!” Jonas said, grinning, his face full of scars lighting up. Now that they were alone he could be himself. “What’s up? I haven’t seen you in ages!”
At the Hospital, Neville assured everyone that although Nathan had spent a lot of energy, he was fine. He just needed to rest a little, and by the time he woke up, he would be fine.
Then Harry had shoved Draco on the bed, taking his own clothes off and opening the bottle of vodka. He’d taken a sip of it but didn’t swallow. Instead he’d kissed Draco and dribbled the liquid inside his mouth, sharing it with him. It had been the most erotic sensation of Draco’s life. His head spun with the memory.
‘And apart from Candelaria, not one knows you’re here,’ Harry said. ‘Good thing you coloured your hair. By the way, I like it, but I still prefer you blond,’ he muttered close to my ear.
I looked away. Seeing them so happy just to see me eat made me feel guilty. I couldn’t begin to imagine the stress I caused my wife. She was so patient. Too patient. I was useless to her and yet she always stood by my side. I couldn’t even think about the idea of divorcing her, not just because of Scorpius, but because I was dependent on her. I was a selfish bastard. I guess that if Astoria asked for her freedom I would let her go. But the funny thing about Astoria was that she never looked unhappy to be by my side. To a man like myself, she was the perfect mate. Besides, she had given birth to my precious son. I would be eternally grateful to her.
