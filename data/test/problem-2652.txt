It takes a while for things to calm down enough for them to get back to dinner. Neville hauls Ginny off Harry -
He loves the one by John Donne the best -
‘We got a good laugh out of your outburst,’ Ron grins. ‘I liked the bit where you made the witness stand explode. Very theatrical.’
Smythe visibly pales.
Draco growls and shoves ineffectively at Harry’s chest. ‘I’m going to hex you a new nose,’ he threatens, but Harry only pulls him close, and he laughs and laughs and laughs and laughs.
‘What the hell is going on, Blaise?’ Harry demands. ‘Why am I really here? Why do we have jurisdiction on Draco’s disappearance? I’ve seen nothing hinting at wandless magic or spell modification in any of Draco’s work.’
‘Auror Smythe, is it?’ he asks, as pleasant as a diplomat making their first introduction. ‘My family has come a very long way for this wedding. I don’t think they appreciate you making us lose face in this manner on such an important day. I really think it would be in your best interest to just leave. You really don't want to escalate this any further.’
See, you’d think that defeating Lord-bloody-Voldemort twice as a child would be quite enough heroism for most people.
Harry scrunches up his face as he searches for the best way to explain. He knows, from working on this case together, that Blaise’s expertise in time magic is limited at best - his education has largely been on the magic that comes from witches and wizards. If Harry succumbs to the temptation to slip into technical jargon, Blaise will be as hopelessly lost as he would be in the Forbidden Forest on a moonless night.
‘Oh, would you?’ Astoria sits up, brightening visibly. ‘That would be very kind.’
‘Professor,’ he says softly. ‘I apologise for interrupting, but my office is closing.’
‘Malfoy!’ Harry exclaims, grinning like a loon. ‘It’s been ages! How’ve you been?’
Kreacher is, of course, overjoyed to see Pansy -
, and it is a
Pansy snorts her disbelief. ‘Eat your curry chips and let me read this stupid list out to you.’
Once he’s sure Narcissa’s attention is absolutely focused on Blaise, Harry reaches out with his awareness, seeking out that quiet harmony of Draco’s magical signature chiming against the low hum of his Anchors.
Harry sighs again, and Draco lifts and falls with the expanding of Harry’s chest. His arm is a comforting weight around Draco, his leg pulled up to brace the side of Draco’s torso. He is steady, steady, the rocky outcrop from which the lighthouse stands, and Draco clings to him and breathes.
Daphne might be a horrible, manipulative bully, but she is undoubtedly the best Healer that Harry knows. She came up with a solution for his condition that wouldn’t only accommodate his magical sensitivity, but could also sharpen it into a tool. It’s pretty simple, really - give Harry something to focus on that is loud enough so that it drowns the background noise out. A shield. An anchor.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Then we started hex-proofing houses,’ Angel adds.
‘I think,’ a member of the Wizengamot says weakly, ‘that we should break for recess.’
!’ Harry roars. His magic rips out of him in a tidal wave.
‘Merlin’s saggy tits,’ Pansy curses, whipping around to glare at her extractor fan. ‘A listening spell? Are you taking the piss?’
The clouds roll off the moon and silver light spills down over them, kissing the tips of Draco’s lashes as he looks at Harry - looks
From the Headmistress’s seat at the middle of the High Table, McGonagall looks like she’s plotting their slow and painful murder. Flitwick retrieves the salad and Neville spoons more potatoes into Harry’s plate. They have treacle tart for dessert, which means Neville gives Harry his share. McGonagall and Trelawney get into a debate about large cats, and Singh weighs in from her end of the table, much to McGonagall’s abject horror. The only booms that shake the castle foundations are those of the vicious thunderstorm wrecking its way through Scotland - but Hogwarts’s defensive spells hold fast.
A week later, with the help of a pensieve and a magical dictionary, Harry does figure it out. He storms in on Malfoy and Andromeda having their lunch, waving a box of truffles threateningly at Malfoy’s smug head.
Harry reaches out between them and takes her hand. The ring on her finger sparkles as it reflects the brilliant moonlight. She squeezes his hand in response, and then releases it from her grasp.
printed on the front.
Harry pulls two cards at random from the deck and places them face-up on the coffee table. Both Blaise and Draco watch closely as Harry arranges the cards - two of spades on the top, ace of hearts on the bottom.
Harry bristles. ‘I’ve written three official apologies to the Department of Mysteries, Blaise.’
‘Good morning,’ he says.
‘Oh, Harry!’ Luna says, waving him over. ‘Daphne’s gotten me a drink already.’
Harry drops his head, leaning it on the curve of Draco’s shoulder. He closes his eyes. Draco’s scent envelops him.
‘Unspeakable Zabini, stay,’ she instructs. There’s enough steel in her voice that Blaise sits back down, obedient as a herd dog. ‘You’ll probably want to hear this too.’
‘You can’t-
Anyways, Draco’s probably gone on holiday. It’s a damn hot time of year, and Harry knows Draco is partial to getting a vicious sunburn on the sandy banks of De Haan whenever the temperature climbs above twenty-five. He’ll be back in the office in no time - but Harry doesn’t tell the Aurors that. He’d rather watch them chase their tails uselessly until Draco turns back up at his private practice, reeking of sunburn-potion and with his hair bleached near-white.
‘Speaking of,’ Neville says, turning to address Harry. ‘McGonagall’s giving you the rest of the year off on leave. She reckons you’ll be tied up with the Malfoy case for a while. I’ve already told her I’m taking over your classes and oversee your exams.’
Draco climbs down off the stepladder and repositions it to the other side of the bookshelf. He laughs when he catches sight of Potter’s disgusted expression. ‘What part of the book are you on?’
‘Alright then. Draco.’
Harry wants to touch him so badly the force of his desire makes his palms burn.  ‘Do you need any help with dinner?’ he asks.
‘To be honest, I’m happy for you,’ Teddy continues, a gentler tone settling into his voice. ‘I think you deserve to be loved as deeply as you both clearly love each other. As deeply as you both have loved me.’
Next up: a long-awaited confession,Teddy is the Best Boy, Harry tries to explain time magic (poorly), Pansy-f'n-Parkinson, and Lucius does not get what he deserves. At least, not yet.
She recounts Lucius breaking into her apartment, entering the building easily even though there were supposed to be wards keeping him out. She repeats the scuffle that followed - Draco drawing his wand, the swift duel, Draco disarming his father, Lucius grabbing Narcissa by the hair and threatening her life.
‘We can’t actually provide you the skeleton-key charm either,’ Angel says. ‘Assuming that’s why you’ve come to speak to us.’
‘Not even slightly,’ says Harry, ‘but go on.’
‘Well, what the fuck were you expecting, Daphne?’ Harry snaps. He slams the ledger down on the table and crosses his arms tightly over his chest. ‘Of course I can’t fucking eat or sleep or think straight. The man I love has been missing for nearly two weeks and is probably being tortured by his abusive, ex-convict father as we speak. So please, forgive me if I’m not sticking to your
Draco couldn’t come. One of his patients came down with a bad case of Spattergroit. As an apology he’s sent a case of champagne that has erupts with tiny shooting stars when it’s poured. Harry feels his absence like the crushing heat of a dead sun, but it’s a good day, and after everyone’s left, he goes upstairs to his bedroom and Floo-calls Draco.
‘My father and I are the same creature,’ Draco says aloud. ‘We deserve the same ending.’
The letter, of course, is beautiful.
Harry would trust him with the whole world. He nods silently in reply.
Daphne squeezes her eyes shut and leans back against the plush backing of her seat. She presses her fingertips into her temples. ‘I feel violated.’
Healer Thompson folds her arms over her chest. ‘I have patients who urgently need my time,’ she says, that same, frightening smile still fixed on her face, ‘and yet I am here, answering questions about what Mr. Malfoy did during the War, when you have already adjudicated those crimes.’ She gives a dismissive flick of her wrist. ‘I am here to speak about the crimes committed
‘Oh, wonderful,’ says Acquafredda. The coffee pot makes a chirping noise as it finishes brewing. He gestures toward the desk with his left hand as he begins to pour the coffee with his right hand. ‘Put them on the table there so we can have a look.’
‘We offer security solutions,’ Guy replies.
Harry wishes he could talk like that, smooth and clever. He could use it in his mind-numbing meetings with the Minister of Magic.
Harry takes a deep breath and tries again. ‘I wanted something to remind myself of how it felt to be with you,’ he says. He chooses the words carefully, plucking them from among the garden of his thorny, complex feelings. ‘To be near you. Because I am happier when I am with you. I am more myself when I’m around you. But I also know that I should have asked you before I got the Anchors done. And I shouldn’t use you - us - as a crutch. I’m sorry,’ he adds, quietly.
is your health,’ Harry retorts. ‘I care a bloody lot more about your health than I do about stupid paperwork and patrols and stake-outs. Besides, it’s too rubbish out for us to have a nice day anyways,’ he adds, nodding towards the blizzard howling outside. ‘May as well have a nice day in.’
‘What the actual fuck, Potter?’ Pansy says, a groove appearing between her eyebrows. ‘That’s not normal.’
The young Auror -
The Healers move Draco into the Spell Damage ward a few minutes after sunrise. They normally put a time limit on visitors but the Healer in charge of Draco’s case - a middle-aged woman by the name of Thompson - seems to take pity on Harry and sets up a cot for him in Draco’s room.
‘What do you mean, Draco’s missing?’ Hermione demands, striding out of the fireplace in Harry’s study. She’s still dressed in her formal robes, with her hair pulled back into a severe bun.
The young Auror jerks his hand away from the small music box sitting on one of the students’ desks. He turns to level an accusatory glare at Harry. ‘Why do you keep dangerous items in your classroom?’ he growls.
Harry’s not entirely sure how to react to the fact that Draco’s lawyer is, apparently, a Parselmouth, but he thanks the unusual wizard with as much courtesy as he can manage before turning his attention towards the ledger.
Harry pushes himself up out of his chair and crosses the study. Kingsley walks around the broad girth of his desk and comes to stand facing Harry, placing his considerable bulk in front of Proudfoot’s frozen figure. He presses the tip of his wand against Harry’s neck, over the tattoo that marks him as a prisoner of Azkaban. A sensation like trickling icewater spreads through Harry’s skin, leaving behind gooseflesh.
It is the witching hour, and Draco looks drunk. His eyes are smudged and soft like headlights shining through a rain-damp windshield. A blush spreads from his cheeks, down to his collarbones and over his chest. Harry traces his hand down it, fascinated and a little bit possessive.
. He’s wearing a white t-shirt and jeans, and a leather jacket with the collar propped up against the chill, and he’s got a freshly rolled cigarette tucked behind his ear. He’s put a little product in his hair so that it stays out of his face, but that only makes the colour of his eyes more striking.
‘Harry,’ Draco repeats, with the tiniest hint of a smirk.
‘I should make some calls,’ Hermione says. She rubs at her eyes and sniffles, tears still rolling hot and fat down her face. ‘I - I should talk to some more people.’
‘Oh, for Merlin’s sake, man,’ Kingsley says. He waves his wand in a complicated motion, and the restraints fall away from Harry’s limbs in harmless strips of metal.
Draco makes a lovely, gasping sound in his throat. He kisses Harry back with a reverence that makes Harry
Draco kisses his forehead, his palms, the soft inside of Harry’s wrist, over the silver-and-white scars running over his skin, and the black circles of Harry’s Anchors. ‘My delightful idiot,’ Draco smiles. ‘My sweet, lion-hearted buffoon. We have time to figure out a forever. All the time in the world.’
Or maybe Draco does hear him, because suddenly Draco’s hands are on his face and Draco’s lips are pressed against Harry’s and they are kissing. It should be hurried, hungry, clumsy - but Draco kisses the way he does everything else, tenderly, carefully,
Harry recalls liking Neville, once. In the early days, before Ron quit the Aurors, they used to meet at the pub every weekend to catch up. But that was before Harry ended up tunnelled under work and whittled away into a walking shell of a person. He knows Ginny’s been dating Neville for years now, and it shouldn’t matter, not really, because Harry is irrevocably in love with Draco - only it does, somehow, because Neville’s life resembles that childish, stupid everything-forever-happy-ending, and Harry has nothing but a broken heart and an eternity of sleepless nights and a faltering
‘Then perhaps two weeks should be enough, Professor Potter.’
‘It’s not so terrible,’ Draco replies, and his eyes drift to meet Harry’s.
But then Sunday comes around, and they have tea in the conservatory as the last of the autumn rains come down, and Teddy gets jam all over Harry’s shirt and Draco laughs so hard he snorts hot tea out through his nostrils, and Harry catches Draco’s eye and they just smile at each other. They’re just fine, because that’s what they’re like - Harry and Draco, Draco and Harry - and even if the earth shifts in its orbit slightly, it still obeys the rules of mass and momentum and gravity.
‘Yeah, but only after I made team captain,’ Teddy scoffs. ‘Honestly. We’re having a family emergency,
Pansy rolls her eyes and grabs him by the wrist. ‘Potter, don’t start,’ she says, and Apparates them to her apartment.
Harry drops into one of the seats facing the brothers. ‘I suppose you could start with explaining to me what Lopez & Lopez does,’ he says, pulling off his sunglasses and tucking them in his shirt pocket.
Draco withdraws slightly, and Harry mourns the loss of contact. ‘I remember what you said that last night in Ghent,’ he murmurs.
‘That is not easily done,’ Blaise frowns.
He rubs the Anchors on his forearms and huffs out a soundless laugh. Pansy was right after all. Harry found Draco because he loves Draco enough to imprint him on his skin.
He made a promise, after all.
‘Constant vigilance,’ Harry mutters, rolling his eyes at his own paranoia, and pens out a quick message in return.
Malfoy turns his hand over, his long fingers encircling Harry’s wrist. The lights dancing over his body shudder out of existence, the spell coming to a close.
‘Harry,’ Draco whispers, his breath hot on Harry’s lips. ‘Harry, you don’t want this.’
Harry hums and bounces his fist on the counter. ‘I tell you what,’ he says, pointing at Malfoy, ‘I’m done with my shift at six. Will you be free by then?’
Harry doesn’t tell her that he’s drinking heavily every other night just to knock himself into a state of blurry bliss that nearly resembles sleep. He doesn’t tell her that, in those long sleepless nights, his mind churns away with awful images of the victims he’s seen, the ones he can’t rescue, doesn’t tell her that even days after a duel, he can still hear the crack of hexes echoing in his mind like bolts of lightning striking the earth.
‘You were always my anchor, Draco,’ he says. ‘You, your magic… it was a safe place to go. A haven away from everything.’ He bounces his leg, wound up with nervous energy. His words feel clumsy. Inadequate.
‘Well, it’s been a long time since I last visited properly,’ Harry says, bending his head in apology.
‘She cares,’ Draco murmurs. ‘She cares so much.’ He glances up and gives his head a little shake, and the corner of his mouth twists downward. ‘I mean,’ he says, ‘of course she cares. I know she cares. She’s my friend. But-’
supposed to mean?’ Proudfoot retorts. His face is beginning to turn a familiar shade of puce.
‘What does it mean, then?’ Neville asks, wagging his eyebrows.
‘Well, clearly I’m not,’ Pansy retorts. She lurches to her feet, wobbling a little on her ridiculously tall platform shoes. ‘Got you a get-well-soon present,’ she says brightly, shoving the shopping bag into Draco’s hands.
(What had actually happened was that Harry found an exploded Time-Turner on a raid with Ron, and though Ron could find no trace of the magic that made the device work, Harry could feel the imprint of the explosion in the air around it. They handed it over to the Unspeakables right away, but it triggered a deep curiosity within Harry that filled his many sleepless nights with research.)
He is here to help, not hinder, so Draco swallows his burgeoning grief and steps aside as Luna hurries over to Hermione.
Pansy barks out a laugh and rolls her eyes. ‘
It’s a relief when Teddy comes to stay when school lets out. There’s a sobering effect to having a teenager’s eyes latched on you at all hours of the day - and a complete lack of privacy.
‘It means I need to speak with my family,’ Stephen says grimly. He shakes his head as he pulls out his mobile phone and begins to type into it. ‘I think we’re going to have to delay the honeymoon indefinitely until we sort out this mess.’
Harry thinks about warm looks over dining room tables and the taste of champagne and fireworks exploding in the sky and the way people lean together when they yearn for one another, and he doesn’t even know why he keeps holding himself back, why he doesn’t just reach forwards and ask.
‘The Mark isn’t
Halfway through dinner, Hagrid gets up to give a speech. He has to stoop a little in order to avoid tangling his hat with the fairy lights strung between the trees. There are plenty of encouraging whoops and applause as Hagrid straightens his horrendous tie and gives everyone a nervous little smile. He’s gotten a few grey hairs over the years, but nothing else about him has changed - not even his terrible taste in clothing.
, for Merlin’s sake. He scrubs his fingers through his hair and exhales in a quick, short burst.
Harry moves onto the bedroom. Draco’s suitcase is still on top of his wardrobe, and his clothes are all hanging neatly inside. A dog-eared book is perched on the bedside table, a ribboned bookmark peeping out from its pages. A peep in the en-suite confirms that Draco’s toothbrush is still there, along with his home-made, incredibly fancy hair potions.
People stop Draco in the street to fawn over him, press letters and gifts into his hands, tears streaming down their faces -
He seems calm. Almost too calm.
‘What if I’m feeling greedy too?’ Harry says, and maybe his voice is too quiet for Draco to hear.
Instead, on an insignificant November night, Ginny hugs Harry, tells him she’s really sorry, but that it’s over between them, and Floos to the Burrow.
‘Language!’ barks Hermione. She gestures at their teenage children sitting at the table.
into Draco’s shoulder, and apparently they’re all a bunch of sops, because Teddy’s crying now too.
Tonks was his partner. His
He glances at Ginny. ‘I can’t,’ he says.
Neville steps away from the table and peels off his gloves, tucking them into the back pocket of his trousers. ‘Yeah, go on then,’ he says, nodding. He squints at the dark sky. ‘We should be heading in too. Looks like it’s going to get nasty in a bit.’
They don’t let him enter the operating room, so Harry ends up sitting outside with his awful, spiralling thoughts. He stares down at his boots and tries not to think about the dark stain growing on Narcissa’s rug. The fingers of crimson spreading outwards. The flash of pink and white and red of Draco’s insides. The blood drying on his trousers, the sticky residue on his shirt.
‘Lucius Malfoy receives parole,’ Draco says, a bitter expression flitting over his face, ‘and he is released upon wizarding society once more. Before he disappears into the wilderness of Romania and eventually acquaints himself with a group of Neo-Death Eaters in Hungary, he arranges for twelve separate payments to be made from the Malfoy accounts to Selwyn Thestral Stables.’
‘You’re a sap,’ Harry says, and he loves Draco so much he might die.
Luna comes by on the third day. She presses a kiss into Draco’s temple, hangs a charm above his bed (all glittering crystals and pieces of brilliantly-coloured wooden beads), and reads him an entire issue of the Quibbler, cover-to-cover.
Harry feels a sudden stab of guilt, and an old, grey tinge of loss for the closeness they once had. He misses her - not as a lover, but the person who would giggle and joke and lounge around together on late Sundays, arguing about Quidditch while the dishes do themselves.
She gives Harry another reassuring pat on the back, stands up with a swish of her formal robes, and follows Malfoy down the corridor. Harry can hear her fussing even after they’ve rounded the corner out of sight. ‘Really, Malfoy, you should have someone take a look at that. I’ve been doing some light reading, and apparently curse damage can turn into a lifelong disability if you don’t treat it immediately-’
A horrible, impossible groan sounds through the very centre of the world. Harry comes alive, fear flooding his veins with sharp, prickly adrenaline.
‘Love you too, you great ponce.’
He holds out the macarons and flowers and smiles apologetically. ‘I know I should have owled,’ he says, ‘but I was in Paris and I thought it would be nice to drop by and see how you were.’
Harry closes his eyes and tips his head back, back, until the base of his skull rests against Draco’s shoulder. ‘It’s wonderful,’ he sighs.
‘There was a line, Pansy,’ Draco says, not unkindly, ‘and you never crossed it. Not once.’
‘Would you two care to explain to the rest of the class?’ Harry asks dryly.
‘I didn’t say I wasn’t free, Potter,’ Malfoy says with a small smile. Harry knows Malfoy’s laughing at him, but it doesn’t get his blood boiling the way it used to. ‘Come by at six-thirty.’
Content warning: Graphic depictions of violence. Blood. Knife-like wounds.
‘Alright, Harry,’ Draco says. ‘Then for me, just for me, stay alive.’
They both chuckle a little. It’s weird how they’ve spent so many years as friends and still only ever called each other by their last names. It feels like the end of an era, in many ways. The world pivots onward.
‘Will somebody please pass the salt,’ Teddy says.
Harry hums in agreement. ‘Right, thank you very much,’ he says. ‘That was actually really quite helpful.’ He presses a kiss onto her powdered cheek. ‘
Harry can hear soft music drifting from the kitchen -
The master bedroom is just as lovely as the living room. The furniture is made from a pale wood, and there are hand-woven rugs spread out underfoot over the carpeted floor, likely to protect Narcissa’s feet from getting cold on the long winter nights.
Daphne’s face creases with frustration. ‘Because we’re friends, for
(Harry, a broken doll stitched together with gauze and thread, unable to breathe without assistance, and then, later, attending funeral after funeral on crutches, so many friends gone in a splintering second.)
The elderly wizard nods appreciatively. ‘A war hero, then.’
‘Your family is insane,’ Draco says, grinning at Harry. He tilts the bowl of roast potatoes towards Harry’s overladen plate. ‘Do you want some of these, by the way?’
Harry closes his eyes, too, and the world with all its colossal weight disappears until there is nothing, nothing but him and Draco, Draco and him.
Things are a little different after the trial - or rather, after the trial is published in all the papers.
The Unspeakable blinks. ‘Blaise Zabini,’ he says.
didn’t you?’ she accuses, pointing at his chest. Her voice rises in cadence, growing shrill and shaky. ‘Oh, fuck.
‘Yeah,’ Harry sighs. ‘Hence, that monstrosity.’ He waves a hand at the magical sphere floating in his hotel room.
‘I do not want my nephew to be a war hero,’ Andromeda says, her voice edged with steel. ‘He is my family, and I want him alive. However, he shall not live for very long if you do not put that
Blaise,’ Draco tells Harry, pressing up against him with his long, lean body. ‘He fucks
Harry foregoes the delightful-looking baths for the shower cubicles. He keeps his wand in sight, his holster hanging from a peg on the door, because he can still feel the ringing of Lucius’s severing curse in his ears and he can’t help but resort to old habits.
Pansy and Ron both start shouting at the same time, outraged that nobody told them about this, while Hermione looks like she’s about to burst into happy tears. Bill hurries over to collect a significant sum of money from Percy. Fleur announces that she’ll get the good champagne and disappears with a pop, reappearing afterwards clutching two extremely expensive bottles that even Blaise seems to approve of. Arthur seems intent on coming around the overcrowded table to shake Draco’s hand -
, Harry’s heart leaned towards Draco like a sunflower following the sun’s path through the sky. He knows that now.
Harry sneaks another furtive glance at the doors. ‘Daphne, I can’t-’
Something in Kingsley’s face softens, and in his eyes Harry sees a heart-breaking combination of sadness, betrayal, and anxiety. It is the look of a man who has just been shown the rotten core of all that he once believed in. He finds that he has no anger for Kingsley - not even disappointment. He finds, in that bruise-tender place within his heart, nothing but gentle sympathy and pity.
It feels like an explosion in his chest -
Marsters takes a sip of his coffee and sets it back down. ‘However,’ he says, glancing up at Harry through his wire-rimmed spectacles, ‘there’s nothing preventing me from talking about myself.’ And then he smiles, slow and deliberate, and pulls a cigarette case from the breast pocket of his jacket.
‘Don’t be disgusting,’ Blaise says, rolling his eyes. ‘And congratulations, I guess. Well then. Let’s get this business over with.’ He produces a small, glass vial from within his robes, pulls out the stopper, and holds it out expectantly.
Harry laughs quietly and looks up at the sky. He thinks he might split open from the beautiful agony of it all. ‘Sure,’ he says. ‘Every Christmas. Forever.’
Neville traverses Harry’s classroom, his long legs eating up the distance easily. He raises his eyebrows appreciatively at the diagrams on the walls, the terrarium at the back of the classroom - and this annoys Harry, for some stupid reason, because he doesn’t want Neville’s approval, doesn’t need it, but something inside him swells with pride anyways.
‘Ah,’ says Michelle, arching a perfectly pencilled brow. ‘
Paris is a place that unfolds slowly, revealing secret compartments only after you’ve unlocked everything else and fallen a little in love with what you find there. Perhaps there’s some magic in that, the kind that Muggles talk about, not the practical kind that Harry uses when he’s cleaning his dishes or fixing his broken glasses.
‘Really sorry about the intrusion, Headmistress,’ apologizes Proudfoot. He sounds sincere, at least, but he’s avoiding Harry’s eye. Maybe he’s disappointed in Harry’s wasted potential.
‘Is he-’
‘Is there something wrong with me?’ Harry asks.
‘I’m fine, Harry,’ he says out loud. ‘Besides, you look far more handsome when you aren’t emulating a mother hen.’
Harry snaps the ring box closed and presses it into Draco’s chest. He hates himself for the flash of pain that flickers across his beloved’s face, that hurt at being rejected so coldly.
The lawyer’s name is Anton Acquafredda, and he reminds Harry of Snape - if Snape had better personal hygiene, a better haircut, and a rather impressive goatee. He’s dressed in a smart grey three-piece suit, gold cufflinks gleaming at his wrists. A small milk snake winds its way around the high collar of his shirt. For the first time in years, Harry wishes he’d been able to keep his ability to talk to snakes.
‘Breathe, Potter,’ says Malfoy’s voice.
Neville grabs Harry firmly by the wrist and drags him back into his seat. ‘Easy, Harry,’ Neville whispers.
‘Dump some whiskey or Bailey’s in it,’ Ginny replies. ‘I don’t care, just make it strong.’ She leans back in the chair and digs her fingers into her hair, dragging her fingernails against her scalp. ‘I can’t fucking believe this is happening.’
‘We irritated some Dark wizard enough to warrant a blood curse, it seems,’ Daphne says, upon catching Harry’s confused expression. ‘Or perhaps it was someone who married into the family. We don’t know where it came from, and there’s no curse recorded like it. It made it rather difficult to treat. We went through maybe twenty Healers who said they couldn’t do anything for Astoria. One of them told us she wasn’t going to last beyond twenty.’
‘But Draco is not there,’ Michelle says.
Hermione shakes her head. ‘It feels off,’ she says. ‘I’m worried about him. I’m worried about you, too. You shouldn’t have to do this.’
Harry presses a kiss against Draco’s shoulder. There is a freckle there, at the rise where his clavicle meets his arm. ‘Yes?’ he replies.
But he also remembers that one moonless night he sat drinking in Draco’s Muggle apartment (the telly playing in the background, empty wine glasses on the kitchen table, the quiet rumble of Artemis purring away contentedly). He remembers the quiet confessions whispered to him on the floor in front of the sofa, words that ripped through his heart and left a bitter taste in his mouth (
But teachers at Hogwarts don’t commute.
I also don’t know a lot about how the wizarding court system works, or if they have barristers or solicitors, so I’m just making it up because it seems horrifying that the HP universe justice system is basically a tribunal instead of a court (but that checks out because JK is kind of… well you know.)
Harry perches on the edge of her desk and flicks her brand-new shinbone. ‘Don’t be a smarmy git,’ he says.
‘Your hair,’ Neville replies. He spoons a helping of roast potatoes into Harry’s plate. ‘I managed fine with the bonsai.’
He shucks off his jacket and drops it over the back of a chair at the dining table, before heading towards the kitchen. Draco stands by the sink, filling up a tall pot with water. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, exposing the dulling scar of his Mark. He still keeps it covered up in front of everyone else, and maybe he would still keep it hidden from Harry if it wasn’t for the fact that they’d both witnessed the worst of each other.
It feels a little bit like being back at Hogwarts, only without the bullying and hexing, but Harry’s not sure he’s happy with that. This is Malfoy’s party. He should be sitting at the centre of it, not off to the side. But he doesn’t say anything, and enjoys the gentle buzz of alcohol as it overtakes him and makes all the sharp edges of the world smooth and lovely.
‘Is it quiet out here?’ Draco asks.
‘This is Astoria’s sister, Daphne Greengrass,’ Luna introduces, waving a hand between the two of them. ‘You remember Astoria, don’t you Harry? She was my roommate.’
P.S. the title is from You by Keaton Henson
He made a promise to Harry, years ago in a dingy alleyway stinking of piss and cheap booze - and he does not break his promises.
Acquafredda frowns as inspects the record. He lifts his hand to his neck, where his familiar is curled beneath the fold of his shirt collar. ‘
party, while Andromeda sits back in her chair and fans herself tiredly, muttering about being too old for this sort of thing. Draco’s been kidnapped by the army of Weasleys. When Harry peers over, he spots Draco looking horrified as George orders drinks from the bar, his arm wrapped around Draco in what Harry knows from personal experience is an iron grip.
‘Ah,’ says Harry, finally spotting the source of Ron’s distress.
‘Snape might’ve been nicer to us,’ Ron adds thoughtfully.
They join the others in the dining room. Luna makes tea and miraculously produces ginger biscuits and Biscoff cookies. Hermione stares listlessly into her tea, dipping her biscuit into it until it breaks apart and floats in scattered clumps.
Because that’s what he does. He watches people die, and he does nothing to stop it. He watches as Dumbledore tumbles off the Astronomy Tower. He watches through Voldemort’s eyes as countless people - innocent or otherwise - are slaughtered. His days and nights are haunted by flashes of green and the sound of Nagini’s jaws snapping shut.
‘A deal,’ repeats Ron. He folds his arms and leans against the wall. For a moment, Draco can see the echo of the Auror he once was - tall, broad-shouldered, grim-jawed and absolutely terrifying in his ability to stare someone down.  ‘What deal?’
Neville’s grip is an iron vice, but Harry barely feels it. His mouth is sandpaper dry. He hears the whip-crack of curses ricocheting off stone, the rumble of walls collapsing like distant thunder, the screams of people trapped under rubble, the stink of blood and burnt flesh.
, sweet and perfect and lovely, and he’s so happy he could fill the sky with it.
Draco allows himself to watch Astoria and Acquafredda for a bit, as the latter launches into the beginnings of the explanation of what they have uncovered. He nods to himself and turns away, walking towards the bay windows on the other end of the study. The curtains are half-drawn, revealing the distant, glittering view of the Shard as it catches the last shimmering rays of the sunset. Time seems to have travelled in strange hops and skips - though that might just be the sleep deprivation finally getting to Draco. He feels untethered, as though in any moment he might start drifting up into the vastness of the sky.
. Harry feels the last component of the spell hover at his fingertips, and he holds it steady, hovering just above completion.
kind of cheerfulness, ‘now’s the best time to consider that offer from the Tornados. They’re dying to have you.’
(See the end of the chapter for
He will not agree to their terms, of course, which means that he has all the time in the world.
‘When a person makes a decision, they are laying out a pattern with the cards,’ Harry says, tapping his forefinger on the cards. ‘If you go back in time, you can change those cards around.’
They put Draco into a magically-induced coma so his body can heal, uninterrupted. There was significant curse damage, the Healers say.
Harry bares his teeth in a grimace. ‘I can’t sleep.’
‘Yes,’ Pansy replies. ‘That’s exactly what I’m saying.’
They figure out the long-distance thing.
Harry leans into his touch. ‘If you like.’
‘Thank you for your kind cooperation,’ Smith winks, and then heads out, the flock of Aurors following him.
say that.’
Michelle answers Harry’s Floo-call almost instantly. ‘
Proudfoot pinches the bridge of his nose.
This isn’t an attack against Draco. Not really. Draco just happens to be the easiest target - the only person who won’t fight back. And Harry - well, Harry’s got a leash so tight around his neck he can’t do anything but watch the torture and destruction of the man he loves.
‘Hullo,’ says a familiar voice above him. ‘Mind if I sit?’
‘I’m so sorry,’ Harry whispers. The bones in Malfoy’s wrist feel as delicate as a bird’s wing in his grasp.
during the ceremony. Hugo slips on the muddy ground and loses the rings, which leads to Teddy scrambling around in the mud in shirt and coattails in a wild attempt to find it while Hugo bursts into tears. In the end Hermione performs a simple summoning charm and hands the rings back to Hugo, spelling the mess from his clothes and wiping his tears fondly -
‘Draco?’ Harry says.
‘What is she doing?’ Ron asks, looking quizzically over at Malfoy. His shirt is now a painful shade of fuchsia, peppered with vomit-coloured polka dots, which adds to the effect somehow.
‘Constantly,’ adds Acquafredda, tapping his wand on the coffee pot to fill it up.
‘Go,’ says Malfoy.
Draco laughs softly, setting down his quill. ‘I can imagine that would be unpleasant,’ he says.
Draco’s relief washes over his face, and he smiles so fondly at Harry that it makes the jagged wound in his heart almost bearable.
If this is a love story, then it is at least in part one about the love that our friends and found family give us. Thank you so much for coming along this ride with me. I hope this new year is kinder to you than the last.
‘See you Monday!’ Prentis calls after him cheerfully.
It’s extremely disconcerting.
Harry glares at Neville. ‘You’re right, I wouldn’t,’ he admits reluctantly. ‘But I will hide all the beer and serve
Ron pats him on the back with an audible thump. He has large hands to match his ridiculous height. ‘Catch some shut-eye, mate,’ he advises, standing up. ‘Or one of the frightening women in your life will make you.’
Draco rolls his eyes. ‘I’m an adult,’ he scoffs. ‘I can talk about our previous partners without having a mental breakdown.’
Neville is still laughing when they dash towards the safety of the castle and make it through the front doors, just as the rain grows torrential and lightning crashes down just beyond the dark wall of the Forbidden Forest. The air is sticky even inside the castle halls, regulation spells be damned, and Harry’s hair sticks uncomfortably to the back of his neck. He runs his fingers through his hair in irritation, wishing it was just an inch shorter.
The stranger’s gaze sweeps over Harry, and a deep groove appears beside his mouth. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, a dancer preparing to leap into motion, and suddenly Harry recognizes him through the film of cosmetic spells.
Malfoy laughs hollowly. ‘Then do it. I have nothing left to lose.’
‘Maybe he doesn’t know what to say to you,’ Luna tells him, when Harry meets her for coffee.
Draco lets out a soft exhale, his elbows drawing closer to his sides as though bracing for a blow.
‘Alright,’ Harry agrees easily. He props himself up with one arm, fighting against the treacle-sweet pull of post-coital sleepiness. ‘Let’s hear it, then.’
Harry doesn’t need to breathe, drowning in Draco’s deepwater love. He kisses with aching slowness, each movement gentle. His touch is cool against Harry’s fever-hot skin. His hand traces the rise of Harry’s hip, following the curve of Harry’s body up and over, until it rests on the small of Harry’s back. He is tender, tender, petal-soft and springwater-sweet.
but Harry loves the twist of magic and reality, the juxtaposition of death, destruction and love. Draco calls him a morbid little bastard for it, but since then he’s sent Harry nearly every other Joanne Harris novel, each copy beautifully bound and autographed.
‘Muggles call them safe rooms,’ Angel adds. ‘Our father had one built into the cellar of our house in Florida, y’know, for the hurricanes.’ He quirks an eyebrow and lifts his hands, palms spread. ‘So, we figured, hey, why not offer a panic room for magical attacks?’
Brussels in the evening is the very picture of loveliness. Golden light spills over the damp cobblestones of the square as the summer evening settles in, the sky shifting into a deep violet. Laughter drifts from the outdoor seating of a restaurant, and somewhere far off Harry can hear the faint strains of a violin. He dodges the heavy foot traffic as he hurries across the square.
‘It’s alright, mate,’ Ron says, patting his shoulder lightly. ‘It’s not that bad.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry frowns. He should really get back to it. Ron will have his arse when he finds out Harry’s been slacking.
Draco shuffles a little closer and takes Harry’s hands. His fingers don’t twitch anymore, not like they used to. His grasp is steady, and through it Harry feels his magic pool around them like an oasis. Harry wants to lean back into it and let it soothe all his jagged edges.
Harry gets to his feet slowly. The stars keep spinning out above him and the world rolls viciously beneath. The grass still carries the indentation of Draco’s shape, and the champagne bottle sits in the same place it was first discarded.
Harry tries not to balk visibly at the sight of them. He’ll never get through them in this lifetime.
‘I quit the DMLE,’ Harry clarifies. ‘And then the Department of Mysteries hired me separately.’
‘You can look at the ledger
‘Have you heard anything?’ Hermione asks, for what might be the hundredth time since Harry’s arrest.
,’ Harry says heatedly. ‘It’s not something edgy that should be celebrated - it’s a fucking blight on Draco’s life and it causes him actual pain every single day and I swear to Merlin’s fucking eyeballs if I see a single kid out there with a skull-and-snake tattoo I will hit Skeeter over the head with an anvil.’
‘What
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco. ‘I thought we agreed never to mention the Shacklebolt incident ever again,’ he says. Two months ago, he made the front pages by stomping on Kingsley’s wife’s toes during an extremely poor attempt at the foxtrot, halfway through a benefit for war orphans. Thankfully, both Shacklebolts forgave him for his two left feet.
‘This isn’t even your house,’ Pansy grumbles, but she adjusts her posture anyways, crossing her ankles and sitting up straight. ‘I’m exhausted, Draco,’ she complains. ‘Those stupid Aurors had me in interrogation for twelve hours.’
But there, above Draco’s lip - a tiny scar from where Teddy accidentally flew his broom into Draco’s face ten years ago.
‘You don’t,’ Harry murmurs.
Malfoy sneaks down into the dungeons later, his eyes dark and his cheeks sunken, and he presses chocolate into Harry’s palm. The fingers of Malfoy’s left hand twitch uncontrollably, and he nearly drops the tiny packet of silver foil and coloured paper.  ‘It’s all I have left,’ he whispers. ‘I’m so sorry.’
Smythe’s face is a twisted mask of displeasure. ‘Search the property,’ he orders.
He drops by the bookstore that Draco works at, on rainy weekends after his shift when all the lights have come on in the street and the store is empty but for a few stragglers. He leans against a bookshelf, reading a paperback edition of
He knows Hermione has been folding sheets of bubble-wrap precautions around Harry nearly all their lives, but there is no keeping Harry from danger. There is only the waiting for him to return, the bandaging of his wounds and the counting of his bruises when he drags his beaten body back home. Draco has made a lifetime profession of it. He has moulded himself into the best shapes to catch Harry when he falls.
‘Hm.’ Daphne pulls away, bracing her hands against the backs of Draco’s arms. She dips her chin slightly so she can properly study his face. ‘I’ll tell you what Luna said to me this morning. She said,
‘That was work,’ Draco reasons.
Ron’s face pales, drawing his freckles into stark contrast. ‘Bloody hell,’ he utters.
She gives him an incredulous look, opening her mouth to tear into him, but she’s cut off suddenly by an earth-shuddering boom.
Daphne glances sideways at Luna, and a silent conversation passes between them formed of looks and raised eyebrows. They have always moved together in perfect synchronicity, but to see it now makes a bitter taste spread in Draco’s mouth. Harry has been gone not even ten hours, and he already sees his absence in everything - like dark spots of mould growing on a bedroom wall - and he
‘You should really think about acquiring a survival instinct,’ he drawls, when Harry gets hit across the chest with a severing curse. ‘I hear they’re on offer down at Flourish & Blotts.’
Healer Thompson arches her eyebrows. ‘No,’ she says. ‘I would not say that.’
- something strange and old and woven between the two of them from the moment they met in Madam Malkin’s, a prince and a poor orphan. Or perhaps their love was already seeded when they were but carefree children, chasing each other on broomsticks in an early Autumn sky.
Teddy huffs a disgruntled sigh and nods. He trudges through the kitchen and drapes himself over Draco, groaning miserably as he leans with his whole weight.
Proudfoot winces and twists his face away from the witness stand.
Harry lies down the rug in front of his fireplace, and he stares at his ceiling and wonders how he can feel so fucking tired. He closes his eyes, hoping that sleep comes, even though it never does, but in the darkness he sees the faces of all those he’s loved so fiercely, all those kind and good and brave people who’ve left him behind.
Pansy’s face crumples and she folds inwards, a paper fairy drenched in the rain, limbs turning soggy and falling apart. ‘Then why do I feel so fucking guilty?’ she whimpers. ‘Draco, why do I feel like this?’
Malfoy’s eyebrows arch. They’re a few shades darker than the shocking colour of his hair, but lighter than his lashes. Harry has no idea why he’s noticing these details now.
(His father’s smile, as the Aurors led him away, fat and content, a cat filled to the brink with cream.)
‘I’ll go pop the kettle on,’ Harry announces. He gives Draco a discrete signal to make a swift exit to the kitchen before things get really ugly.
?’ Astoria asks anxiously. ‘What did you see? What does it mean?’
‘Bureaucrat,’ Harry replies. He nods towards the bartender, gesturing at his now-empty glass of whiskey sour. ‘I’ve stepped on some toes recently.’
It’s a beautiful afternoon. From Harry’s classroom, he can see the Forbidden Forest stretch out onwards, the leaves so bright the forest seems aflame. He’s got one of the windows cracked open, cold, autumn air drifting in and bringing with it the sweet smell of damp leaves.
The taste of rubble and ash on his tongue triggers something in his mind - a raw, untreated wound - and suddenly he is fighting for breath, delirious with pain, choking on the stench of decay and burnt flesh, staring up in a darkness that is nearly impenetrable, knowing that he will die here, he will die underneath this brick and mortar and plaster and wood and steel, bleeding into the broken earth, and nobody will find him, nobody will miss him-
‘We sleep with it under our pillow,’ Angel adds, nodding seriously.
‘Potter.’ Malfoy smiles at Harry, the motion softening his sharp features.
Harry glances at Neville. Neville’s shirtsleeves are rolled up to his elbows, hands and forearms entirely covered in dragonhide gloves as he leans over a bonsai whomping willow. Neville notices Harry’s gaze and flashes a shit-eating grin.
Luna sips at her coconut-milk mocha and frowns slightly. ‘You’re special to him, Harry,’ she says. ‘It can be a little hard to write to someone important. Your feelings get all tangled up like string, and you have to spend time by yourself picking apart the knots and winding it all up neatly again.’
‘Alright, you insensitive prick,’ Ron thunders, ‘you’ve been making Hermione sick with worry.’
, Professor?’ she purrs, dropping to her knees next to the fireplace. ‘I was just about to close up for the evening. How can I be of help?’
Narcissa shows off all the magical plants hanging around her bathroom, and all the potions Draco’s brewed for her hair and her arthritis. She presses Harry to try out all the taps, smiling serenely as he gawks at the jets of pink-and-lilac water.
Blaise looks pained. ‘This is making my head hurt,’ he tells Harry.
He can’t seem to move.
, and that simply won’t do, because then I find myself watching Weasley and Longbottom do their adorable little newlywed dance and all I can think about is you.’
Draco said that.
‘Of course I am,’ Draco says, a little reproachful.
Ron makes a gagging noise into his wine.
‘I see,’ says Andromeda. ‘If this is the measure by which you judge others, then it seems my nephew must be martyred to be worthy of your consideration. Thank you, but I think I have enough martyrs in my family.’
It takes him fifty-three drafts to get it right. Fifty-three drafts, and a box of chocolates.
my apology,’ she groans, ‘so I can get bloody well on with it, Potter.’
Teddy makes a soft little humming noise in his throat. ‘Okay,’ he says, sounding significantly more lucid. ‘I’ll stay with you then. D’you want fancy tea or normal tea? I can put the kettle on.’
Harry drags his fingers through his hair, exhaling a sharp breath of air through his nose.
‘I know where you’re going with that, you sneaky little shit,’ Harry grins. Draco’s been trying to get him to quit the Aurors and go work at Hogwarts for years now.
. What the fuck is happening? He’s in there, isn’t he? He’s been in there the entire time.’
He’s never been good at untangling, or clearing up his messes - since he was just a child, his approach has always been to just shove it somewhere and deal with it later.
‘It really doesn’t,’ Teddy replies. ‘I think I’m a little more surprised it took this long.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Perhaps the Bureau hasn’t,’ Harry replies wryly.
‘I know,’ Harry says quietly. ‘It’s different to witness the proof of her love.’
There are mountains of broken, charred corpses of things that used to be glittering and wonderful. The warped edges of lost magic dig into his awareness like barbed wire. He didn’t know back then, how these artefacts were woven together with so much beautiful, intricate spellwork. He can trace the echoes of the charms in the fragments that remain. If he’d known back then - desperate with fear and adrenaline, running on little sleep and even less food - would he have turned around, tried to stop the Fiendfyre?
. He gives Harry a near-imperceptible nod, his speech never once faltering.
‘You look remarkably sober, Potter,’ he declares. He sounds posher than usual, which is a good indication as any that he’s three sips away from being face-down-in-a-ditch drunk. ‘I insist you get horrendously inebriated, this instant.’
Harry feels a rush of something rising up within him, something not quite like anger, but deeper than it, darker than it. As dark as a train compartment, as violent as the snap of cartilage breaking, dark as an angry curse scribbled into the margins of an old textbook -
Ginny clucks her tongue and shakes her head as she watches him go. She looks so much like Molly that it makes Harry’s heart twist out of shape. He wonders if there would be anyone alive who could tell him if he looked like his father - or his mother, even.
We’re just past halfway through the story. Don’t get bored of me yet. Please. I’m sorry. THERE’S JUST SO MUCH PLOT LEFT.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. ‘You know, I used to fantasize about this moment,’ he says. ‘The things I would say. The things I would do. But here I am - here we are - and I must admit, I’m a little too overwhelmed to remember any of the things I wanted to do.’
‘Nice to see you again, Harry,’ Daphne says, smiling with only the corner of her mouth. She extends her hand.
‘And so polite,’ Michelle praises, wiping her ruby-red lipstick off his face with a thumb. She towers a good three inches over Harry, dark-haired and outrageously stunning for a witch her age. Sometimes she feels a little larger than life. ‘You are my favourite boy. I love it when you come visit.’
It has been nearly two weeks since then, and Harry is no longer weak.
However, Harry is also a direct descendant of James Potter, twat extraordinaire, and incredibly incapable of levity in any situation, so he says: ‘It’s not a competition, Draco. It’s a
‘It was your choice to associate with Slytherins,’ Daphne replies with a wink.
‘Alright,’ says Ron, ‘
idea.’ He pats Harry’s upper arm fondly. ‘I adore you, but you have the observation skills of a rock.’
‘So,’ she says, after she’s had a long chug of her drink, ‘what
Harry moves before his brain can catch up, vaulting over the back of the settee in one smooth, well-oiled motion.
‘Oh, come
Harry recognizes the stationary immediately. ‘Did Daphne put you up to this?’ he asks.
‘Then ask your boyfriend to send you another batch of potions,’ Neville says, leering.
‘Yeah,’ Harry replies, picking up his mug. ‘It makes me feel like he didn’t win, you know? You and me sitting here, talking like normal people - it feels like spitting in his face somehow.’
Harry shakes his head as he heads out the door. ‘I hope those bones grow back into a hoof.’
The wizard flushes an angry vermillion. ‘This is no joking matter,’ he huffs.
I ended up breaking this chapter in two. It became a bit of a behemoth and it was too much of a roller coaster to keep in one chapter. It’s going to be a real good chapter next, you’re going to have so much fun (she shouts into the quiet auditorium with only three people in the audience).
Draco’s thumb is a butterfly’s kiss on Harry’s cheek. He presses his lips to Harry’s forehead, feather-light and silk-soft, and asks for a forever-everything-happy-ending.
He pries open his heart and picks out all the pieces that have grown cobwebbed and neglected under his father’s rule. He writes letters, makes amends, takes all the gifts he has and pushes them towards making other people happy. He finds that he has rather a talent for it. He tilts towards it, a sunflower following the sun, and within him, something begins to bloom.
, Draco thinks.
Draco puts away his book as Harry climbs into bed beside him and leans over to turn off the lights. He takes Harry’s shaking hands in his own and holds them until Harry learns how to fill his lungs with air again. They lie down together as the night air drifts in through the open windows, and Draco pulls Harry close, closer than Harry’s ever dared to be, close enough for Harry’s legs tangle up with Draco’s, close enough to feel the
Harry, as always, Apparates directly into Draco’s kitchen. Draco can hear the soft
‘In fact,’ continues Thompson, ‘when I treated those victims, I discovered that they had already been given preliminary treatment. Potions. Countercurses. Apparently,’ she says, the corner of her mouth tugging upwards, ‘Mr. Malfoy was trying to run a volunteer Healer effort on the inside, despite his appalling lack of training. He did a worse job at patching those people up than he did hurting them. I think we are all lucky he did not decide to pursue a career at St. Mungos.’
‘How did you do it? How did you find me?’
‘Yeah, she was off. If I didn’t know better I’d say it was some kind of mind-altering curse - not Imperius, because we’ve got a track on those now.’ He shakes his head. ‘But there’s just so much background noise in that apartment. I can’t pick it out.’
Harry feels like he’s running out of time
‘May I?’ Blaise requests, lifting his wand and jerking his chin towards Harry.
The Greengrass estate hovers in an ocean of botanical wonder, the white pillars of its facade shining out over the hedges like the brilliant lights of a schooner waiting beyond the tide. Golden lights hover above the extensive gardens like flickering fireflies. Harry and Draco make their way down a long gravel path lined with tall hedges, following a long trail of wedding guests. The air has lost the balmy weight of midsummer, and the sky is clear of clouds.
‘I’m glad you’re alive,’ Harry says, and realises it’s the truth.
An invisible bell chimes softly as Harry pushes it open and steps into the shop.
The ledger flicks forward a few pages. Proudfoot’s jaw twitches as he adjusts his grip on the volume, sitting up now in the chair. His brow is furrowed all the way up to his hairline.
‘That’s alright, Pans,’ Blaise grins. ‘I reckon I can get five out of him.’
towards him, lips parted and eyes as bright as a thousand trails of burning magnesium.
It is sweltering hot and the sky is determinedly cloudless. Ron forces them all to line up so he can slather them in sunscreen while lecturing them on the dangers of melanoma. He blackmails Draco into agreeing to hydrate every two hours -
She’s silent as she cries into Harry’s shoulder, her fingers digging into his shoulder. Harry looks up at the impassive white paint that covers Pansy’s bedroom ceiling and tries not to think about the leviathans lurking between Pansy’s words.
Harry swears he already told reception he doesn’t want to be disturbed today - but this is Pansy-fucking-Parkinson, who is second only to Hermione with her ability to bulldoze her way to what she wants. She probably bullied the front desk until someone gave her the password to his hotel suite. Or maybe she just broke in. The Slytherins have always been irritatingly good at lock-picking.
‘It was a lot of previous partners,’ Harry says at last, quietly. He isn’t ashamed of it, but he isn’t proud of it either. ‘Hermione disapproved. It wasn’t - it wasn’t exactly healthy. Not that promiscuity is bad in and of itself - it’s just that I was using it as a way to self-destruct. But, well.’ Harry shrugs. ‘I experimented a lot.’
Draco throws Harry a lascivious wink. ‘You love me really.’
‘Hm,’ agrees Daphne. She nods her head towards the archway. ‘Shall we?’
Blaise is nearly soundless as he makes his way across the study to Draco’s side. ‘Out of interest, Draco,’ he asks, his tone intentionally mild, ‘what are you going to do with this information?’
Malfoy looks completely different from when Harry last saw him. His hair curls slightly over his temples and behind his ears, and his cheeks are flushed a blotchy pink from the heat of the shop. The ever-present bruises under his eyes from sixth year are gone. He’s dressed in startlingly Muggle clothes - sweater and sensible jeans - and though he’s still on the thin side, he no longer looks like a stiff breeze would knock him over.
Draco dances like Harry fights.
Malfoy looks up at Harry, his grey eyes burning. ‘I don’t think I will ever find a way to forgive my father for this,’ he says. ‘I begged him. Pleaded, even. And still, he offered me up to the Dark Lord like chattel. He let them put that
Harry lies in the dark, staring up at the ceiling of his hotel room, and tries not to get sucked into the spiral of his thoughts.
‘I see you, Draco Malfoy,’ Harry says. ‘And when Hermione’s done with them, they’ll see you too.’
Draco leans back against the kitchen counter. ‘Circe,’ he gasps, wiping a tear from his eye with his thumb. ‘Hermione can be so… so…’
‘If I let myself have this,’ Draco says softly, sadly, ‘I shall lose you as soon as you sober up and come to your senses. I can’t lose you, Harry.’
‘Is this your attempt at small talk? You’re abysmal at this.’ Malfoy leans forwards and the light catches in his eyes. He’s so damn pretty, all silver and white-gold, soft and sharp all at once.
, as though he hadn’t pulled that clever manoeuvre and sent all the air out of Harry’s lungs.
frighteningly effective.
‘I’ll head there after this, actually,’ Teddy tells them both. ‘I owe Gran a visit. Gran’s been complaining that I’m shit at letter-writing, and to be fair, I am shit at letter-writing. Oh, and I reckon I’ll pick up a part-time job while I’m here as well. I don’t want to be a burden on any of you.’
Astoria sinks into the closest chair and sighs. ‘Will someone explain to me what is going on?’ she demands.
‘Well, no,’ Harry admits. ‘But it’s not jarring. It’s more like ambient music.’
, of course, you mean the Dark Lord trying to murder you on an annual, semi-annual basis,’ Malfoy said dryly, tilting his head to each side in emphasis.
Draco’s expression is stricken as he watches his aunt. Harry slips his hand into Draco’s and squeezes it tight.
They climb the stairs through the empty, quiet house. Draco leads the way, because he’s seen Harry’s room before. He’s dragged Harry’s inebriated ass into bed too many times to count, after one too many drinks on a night out. He knows the way even in the dark, his steps sure as he finds his way up each creaking stairwell, and the way he moves with such familiarity through Harry’s home makes Harry’s heart
. Someone at the Bureau claimed that Draco didn’t have the appropriate paperwork for his rarer ingredients, which was laughable, of course, considering how many weeks Michelle and Draco had spent filling in forms and owling at least five different departments before they finally got the approvals in. Michelle descended upon the accuser with more righteous fury than all the archangels in heaven.
But you’d be wrong.
,’ says Daphne, her eyebrows arching.
Harry wins Draco a large stuffed tiger at the ring toss, and the park attendant on duty rings the bell and yells out the results of his victory. In a show of competitiveness that seems better suited to the pointy-faced boy of years past, Draco wins Harry a toy dragon at the next booth and then insists that the amused attendant celebrate his victory just as vocally.
. Harry is reminded of the eerie singing of the merpeople in the cold depths of the Great Lake, the way the centaurs of the Forbidden Forest moved and spoke, the sudden, fiery rage of the Veela. He thinks about all the things that witches and wizards refuse to understand, of the myriad of magical creatures lost in the ‘taming’ of Northern America.
Draco’s fingertips trace in soothing circles at the nape of Harry’s neck, over the rough lines of old scars. ‘
His phone dings a few minutes later.
And that’s alright. It’s alright.
‘When he finally saw how they had poisoned him,’ Andromeda continues, her voice ragged with old grief, ‘he had already devoted himself to a cause from which there is no escape. So, he did what he could. He stole a Horcrux from Voldemort, and it cost him his life.’
‘I’m not letting them take you away from me again,’ he says, softly enough that Harry has to strain to hear him. He slips his hand up and into Harry’s palm, grasping it tightly as he looks searchingly into Harry’s eyes. ‘Do you trust me to fix this?’
he explained, unravelling a particularly gruesome diagram,
There isn’t time to explain. He can feel them approaching now, their magic sour against the warm golden spread of the wedding guests. Harry unclips the wand holster from his thigh faster than lightning and tucks it into the inner pocket of Draco’s jacket. He slips a
‘I just, I want to believe that things weren’t as bad as they were,’ Harry says. ‘I don’t want to be a tragedy. I want things to be good.’
Draco tries to keep to his resolutions. He tries, he really does.
about the way he stalks back across the room that makes a wave of extremely ill-timed desire spread through Harry.
‘Are you familiar with panic rooms, Professor?’ Guy asks, plucking the paper from his brother’s fingers. He folds it neatly and places it on the desk. ‘They’re a Muggle concept, but every old wizarding house has something similar built into its core. A panic room is a fortified room to hide within, in case of an attack or storm. They’re usually designed to be impenetrable - steel walls, fingerprint scanners, all that stuff.’
Harry bites down on his lip. ‘If I find him,’ he says, ‘I’ll tell him then.’
‘Did you have a nightmare?’ Draco asks his nephew. Teddy’s hair only turns that colour after a bad dream.
Harry is helpless as warmth pools in his chest. Even now, even after what happened, Draco is tender, and Harry simply does not know how to bear it.
He leaves Andromeda’s home feeling as though the ground’s been torn away beneath his feet, and he’s freefalling with no idea of where he’s going to land.
‘I did,’ Harry points out. ‘For ten years.’
‘It means… it means, stay alive for me,’ he says. ‘Take care of yourself when I’m not there.’
The first floor is only the waiting room - Draco makes all his potions to-order after his clients discuss their requirements with him. The stairs are round the back and can only be accessed with a password. There are a few comfortable-looking benches and a number of plain, understated armchairs resting around the room. There are flowers everywhere, and the air smells like spring.
‘If you’re making an attempt to shake your moniker, Boy-Who-Lived, you’re doing a terrible job at it,’ he grins. ‘Valiant effort though.’
Draco sighs and leans his head on his fingertips, his elbow propped on the arm of his chair. ‘He wanted me to fix a modified Time-Turner for him. Or rather,’ he clarifies, ‘he wanted me to fix it, then modify it further. The Time-Turner he gave me was capable of turning back weeks. He wanted years. Decades, actually. I refused him at first - I only gave in after he threatened to turn his wand on my mother.’
Harry storms back into his office, his anger still burning in his veins as he slams the door behind him with a satisfying thud. ‘If one more person asks me why I associate with Death Eaters,’ he rages, shucking off his outer robes and flinging them unceremoniously at his chair, ‘I will hex them into oblivion.’
Harry stares at the glowing sign hanging above the tall, glass door, wondering if he’s managed to fall into some alternative universe where Draco-sodding-Malfoy frequents Muggle coffee chains.
Malfoy is up to something.
‘Because of who you’ve become,’ he says firmly. ‘Because they tried to put you in the dark, and yet here you are, in full bloom.’
Harry’s brow furrows slightly as he processes the information, stowing it away in the web he’s been crafting in his head. Another piece to add to the complex tapestry - another step closer to finding Draco.
It’s Christmas at the Burrow, and Bill pulls Harry aside, places a letter in his hand, and asks if he’s put Malfoy up to this. It’s another lovely letter, one that makes Harry take a long walk outside to clear his head. There’s a recipe for wolfsbane potion there too, one that leaves far fewer side effects and tastes a lot less like shit, according to Bill’s attempts at brewing it. When Harry comes back inside to help with Dinner, Molly pulls him aside and asks him if Malfoy’s doing alright, because she saw him in Diagon Alley while she was Christmas shopping and he was looking dreadfully skinny, and he gave her a letter which made her very sad and very worried about him when she read it.
‘You hate it when I talk shop,’ Harry murmurs.
Lucius tortured him.
Proudfoot sighs again, heavily, and turns on his heels, facing Harry properly for the first time since he walked into the Great Hall. ‘I’ll give it to you straight, Potter,’ the senior Auror says. ‘Malfoy’s gone missing, and we’re pretty sure he’s up to something.’
