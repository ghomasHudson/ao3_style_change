won't just let that happen, do you understand?"
Harry shifted on the bed just enough to see her as she moved about the room. There was something about how she'd said it that made him want to comfort her. And wasn't that a joke? He was probably the reason she was going to die, along with everyone else he knew.
Taking his silence for tacit agreement, she shook her head. "Well it turns out it's entirely possible when half of the people my father invited round that evening were working for him."
"Then let us not delay." Without needing to be called, Fawkes flew over and alighted on Dumbledore's shoulder. "Lucius is also in need of attention. Come, there will be much to discuss."
As a result, he was even less pleased to discover Iana Malfoy sitting at his table. As he rounded the corner she looked up and fixed him with a withering glare. Harry very nearly turned right back around to find somewhere else to sit, but after a brief hesitation, he forged ahead.
Sitting down on the edge of her bed, Harry frowned down at her. "I thought it was destroyed, like mine?"
The Headmaster silenced him instantly with a simple gesture, and pulled out his wand. He didn't say anything as he stalked towards the empty desk. Gone was any hint of the absent-minded old man who presided over Hogwarts feasts with speeches composed entirely of nonsense words. In his place was a wizard Harry could readily imagine Voldemort fearing.
"But you're Iana Malfoy," Harry said, throwing his arms up. "Everyone knows your name. There's probably lessons taught on you at Uagadou. It's your name because it's always
friends, not less. Does that make sense?"
"You're having a laugh, right? You're in danger of turning into Hermione."
"Still, it was a nice thing you did."
to you after your birthday? You went off to talk to old Dumbledore and we pretty much haven't heard from you since."
That got rueful looks from both Lily and Remus, while Sirius had another good laugh at it. Iana, to her credit, managed to take the question in her stride.
"I don't know." Harry shrugged. "I don't think they really know what to do."
Harry took another step forward; another step closer to Iana, and met Voldemort's red eyes as they snapped back to him in surprise. Then Harry recited:
The weariness settled heavy over Dumbledore's face again, burying a moment of something else. Had that been pain? He shifted his gloved hand down behind the desk. "I will do everything in my power to destroy the Horcruxes that remain, if we are able to deduce their form and location, but the fact remains that I may not be successful. Should I prove unable to dispatch them, it will fall to you, and whatever allies you might gather for the purpose."
"Obliviated I guess. Maybe Imperiused," she shrugged as if it didn't really matter which. "They were useless, anyway. The Dark Lord swept them aside like they were nothing."
"In here!" he said urgently. "Quickly!"
Juliet looked a little disappointed, but didn't make an issue of it. "Okay then," she said before quickly making good her escape.
"He said he'd offered my father a choice before, and he'd taken it. He told him it would be easiest if he stood by his word then. He told him to step aside, as he did before."
"How big is it?" Effie asked Snooks, who was bouncing impatiently from one foot to the other.
James leaned back happily, as if her answer was entirely reasonable. "I think you'll fit right in."
"She grew up in fourth and fifth year," said Seamus as he waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
"Oh yes!" squeaked Snooks as he bounced happily. "There is being the come and go room! All the House Elves are being using it."
The other figure had his back to Harry, but it was not hard to tell just who it was. Lucius Malfoy had never been one to shy away from attention the few times Harry had encountered him.
"So, why are you breaking curfew?" said Effie as she plopped herself down on the arm of Neville's seat.
It took a moment for Harry to register just what she'd said. He gawped at her. "Your real name?" he asked her in awe.
Iana nodded a little reluctantly, and repeated the words that had pretty much defined her life since birth.
"I think, actually, you three 'ruined it' by telling the same joke every year for six years. The poor boy was eleven at the time," said Lily as her eyes flicked to her unrepentant husband and his best friend. "I wonder what you two were like at that age, hmm?"
"Anyway," said Lily, returning them to the original topic. "All you can do is what you think is best. That is the way of prophecy. Either it will come to pass or it will not. If you focus on it, on trying to find a way out, or a way forward, you'll only bring it about. If Voldemort had never learned of the prophecy, he never would have gone after you, Iana, and if he hadn't there might be no way for us to defeat him."
Despite the seeming stupidity of the password, the Gargoyle immediately stepped aside to allow Harry access to the stairway beyond. He started climbing.
"He's dead," said Harry suddenly, and Remus turned to look at him more closely. "I did it."
"I'm new to all this." He waved his arms about vaguely. "I'm bloody terrified, and I let my frustration get the better of me."
"We've got Divination this evening," said Dean as he pointed to Seamus and Ron.
you mess up your exams?" asked Neville.
"I don't think he's all that fond of my family either," said Harry with a tight grin.
Harry couldn't help the grin which spread across his face as he looked over them. They were worried, of course. Maybe they were even a bit scared; that wouldn't be unreasonable. They were every bit as out of their depth as Harry felt, but they were sticking by him.
"Or she'll never work it out," Remus pointed out.
"What about Iana Malfoy?" Effie asked innocently. Harry had always known she had a sneaky streak a mile wide, but she still impressed him sometimes.
"What do I do now?" Harry asked, eyes locked on her as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath.
With Harry's injuries being minor enough that Pomfrey and her helpers had been able to heal them up in a few minutes. He didn't even have to endure the usual overbearing complaints about 'children these days'. As soon as she'd rushed off again, without exchanging any more than the bare minimum of words, Harry set off in search of his dad.
"We're looking for a Diadem," said Effie, lowering herself to the House Elf's level.
rare."
Or maybe it was just her idea of some light reading. Nothing could warm the cockles like reading about how your great great great great gand-father had once killed an entire village full of muggles for letting their sheep graze on his land. Probably did just the trick when she was feeling down.
Rosier's flat eyes alighted on Harry for the first time. For a moment, Harry felt like he was being inspected under a microscope. He certainly felt small. Rosier did not look convinced.
As usual, their arrival was met by much excitement from the Elves. While they typically did everything they could to remain out of sight in the rest of Hogwarts they seemed to really enjoy it whenever Harry and his friends went to visit them.
Lily seemed to sink back into the bed in relief, then a moment later. "What about Iana?" she asked.
Harry and Effie shared a helpless look. He really hoped the meeting was done soon, but judging by the raised voices he could just about hear it didn't seem likely.
Only, it wasn't. The real dream was the reality in which the children around him happily went about their usual greetings. Where before he would have been right there alongside them, now he felt like he was separated from them by a wall of unbreakable glass.
Harry thought about it for a second, frowning as he did so. "But why does it matter?" He shrugged. "You're called Iana."
Harry wasn't sure how to respond to that. "Okay."
"There was a Prophecy, you know?" Voldemort continued, addressing them all as his voice grew in volume. "Of one with the power to defeat me." He gestured to the brute who was carrying Iana, and he threw her to the floor.
"Voldemort cast a Killing Curse at me," she said sadly. "Eventually, anyway. I don't really know what happened, but it didn't kill me."
Once again, Harry had no idea what to say. He stared at the Headmaster, as if he was hoping that he'd suddenly change back into a highly amused Sirius Black, but it was not to be. This was Dumbledore, and he'd just laid an even greater burden at Harry's feet.
Perhaps his locking spell got them a second. Maybe two. Certainly nothing more than that. As he ran he heard, and felt, the powerful explosion which tore it from its hinges. The shockwave nearly caused him to trip, but Iana caught him before he did.
Iana didn't descend into tears again. "No," she said simply. She clutched her arms around her a little tighter.
Didn't everyone? Harry nodded hesitantly. What did Voldemort have to do with him?. "He found out that Lucius Malfoy was working against him from inside the Death Eaters, and went to his Manor to kill him, along with his whole family," he said, pausing when Sirius scoffed quietly before he was silenced by a look from Lily. "When he tried to kill Iana, something happened, and his Killing Curse backfired somehow. What does that have to do with me?" He glanced at his parents. They still looked very serious indeed.
"I have already reconvened some other like-minded individuals," said Dumbledore. "And whilst there is little Lucius and I see eye to eye on, he can at least be relied upon to act in his own self-interest. He will do everything in his power to ensure Voldemort is not able to return."
"It means Voldemort controls the Ministry, but he only has his main supporters outside," she said. "With the Order in here, we actually have a chance of holding out."
She was already awake, and her eyes shone with relief when Harry stepped up into her field of view.
"Can you imagine what she'd do if you went up to her and tried to give her a hug or something?" Neville asked, grinning. "She'd hex you so hard you'd be pissing teeth."
"Come in, Harry," Dumbledore repeated as he waved his wand languidly. A squishy pink armchair covered in brightly coloured stitched butterflies materialised. "Please, take a seat,"
"It's Voldemort!" His voice rose in panic, then dropped suddenly into something barely more than a whisper, which would have been inaudible if it were not for the complete silence that followed his first shout. "Oh, Merlin, no."
"You're a bottomless pit, mate," said Harry, and if his grin was a bit more grateful than teasing, who was going to notice?
Dumbledore led Harry over towards the security desk. In the half-darkness it looked to be unmanned, which was strange even on Halloween.
Harry would never admit it, but hearing his father say that, and the accompanying little squeeze on his arm from his Mum made a world of difference. They didn't know what the future held, really, any more than he did, but at least they were still there. He still had so many questions, though.
Harry glanced over in the direction of where James was still concealed from the rest of the room by drawn curtains. There was no reduction in the urgency of the witches and wizards entering and leaving his little cubby. "He's alive," he said, hoping it was true.
"Well, probably," he said, frowning. What was the problem? She got on well enough with them. "I can tell them to bugger off, though, if you'd prefer?"
"Nothing!" said Harry, opting to leave the hug out of it. It didn't really matter, anyway. "Just that. Orontius Crabbe, right?"
Ron and Seamus were just about nose to nose, but paused when Harry spoke. They both looked at Harry, then at each other, then back at Harry again. They both grinned a little sheepishly and relaxed.
With every word of Dumbledore's answer, Harry could feel his chances of escaping dwindle further and further. If it was as he said— and really, who was he to doubt Albus Dumbledore? —then it was certain. He'd have to be the one to defeat Voldemort. Most of his friends couldn't even say his
"Yeah, piss off."
"So, what did happen?" Harry asked gently.
Neville had just left for a study club, which left Harry and Iana alone again at their table.
"I need to stop her!" Harry shouted as he tried to yank his arm free, only for his other arm to be held back by someone else. He turned to find Effie holding on too, her face a mask of fierce determination. "Let go!" Harry bellowed.
"If he told Harry about it, he clearly thinks there's a chance of him failing," Neville pointed out with unwelcome insight. "And I guess it's possible we might at least be able to help, right?"
"Why?"
"What?" he asked.
"Yeah, so, like I was saying. Neville's mum is a pretty solid 7 in my book," said Dean.
," she said, her voice laced with fury.
"What is that meant to mean?" he asked.
?" Ron asked, his voice little more than a murmur.
The two that Harry had knocked down didn't take long to get back up, but it was clear that Iana had managed to steal the wand of one of them, as only one started returning their own spells. He might have gotten some duelling training from his father and Sirius over the last couple of years, but Harry knew his chances against three, with only a wounded Iana for support, were pretty slim. They needed to get away somehow.
A little of Iana's nervousness seemed to have receded, but she still didn't look altogether at ease. "Thank you, Mrs. Potter."
Every Death Eater who'd fallen had reduced their forces by two or three times that when their Imperius Curse victims were freed. Many of those freed had fled, or been too dazed and confused to offer any help, but a couple of them had clearly taken much joy in getting stuck into their erstwhile tormentors.
Malfoy snorted, and Harry couldn’t help but open his eyes and stare, shocked that Malfoy could make a noise so carefree and ridiculous. Malfoy didn’t notice, too busy pulling on his pajamas and climbing into bed.
“Oh?”
“Welcome to Australia,” she drawls, eyes fixed on some point in the distance.
“Shocking.”
It was a mark of just how far he’d come that instead of shutting down, Potter’s face twisted into sadness.
“Tomorrow,” Draco said sharply.
“Trust me!” the first boy yelled back.
Potter wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Their
“I just—” Draco broke off, ran a hand through his hair, searched for some way to explain what he meant without giving himself away. “Don’t you think it’s a bit ridiculous? We should just… I don’t know. Go back to our ordinary lives and pretend it never happened.”
“Good. Now give me the potions.”
“Draco—” Harry begins, but he’s cut off by the most drawn-out sigh he’s ever heard.
Granger jabbed him hard in the ribs with her elbow. “Ron, stop it. Draco’s serious. What are you apologising for? I’m positive it isn’t necessary.”
The argument devolves into yelling, and Harry feels himself growing more and more distant, almost like he’s hovering behind himself, looking down at the two of them. He doesn’t know why. It’s not as though he and Draco haven’t fought before; their entire youth revolved around it, after all. But this feels different. This feels real.
A face came into view—worried eyes and a fierce black bob. Pansy reached out and smoothed the lines of his cheek with her fingers.
Asking for help was definitely against the rules, Draco was sure of it. He’d have to write it down for next year.
“Hey, Potter,” Malfoy said with a smile. “We can go home now.”
Draco frowned.
Somewhere through the haze of anxiety, Draco acknowledged that Potter equated love with infatuation. He filed it away for later and forced himself to laugh.
Potter and Blaise both frowned at him. “No,” Potter said slowly. “I saw the Veela flying well before the curse started up. Before I changed the prophecy, too.”
Remembering his recent determination to keep things civil between the two of them, Draco let go of his rising ire and held out the Sickles in his palm like an offering. They glinted in the bright light of the hospital waiting room, and Potter stared at them in confusion.
Except he hadn’t. He’d gotten away early because the file clerk had stuffed up, and the department wasn’t able to release any paperwork until the morning.
“Yeah. Can—”
“All right, let’s try again. But not my dreams, this time,” Draco insisted, shuddering as he remembered the moment Potter took his wand. Seeing it again had awoken something deep and wretched inside him, and even knowing that this moment had somehow caused Potter’s magic to irrefutably reject him, he couldn’t bear the thought of seeing it for a third time.
“You’re as rich as I am, yet you live like a pauper,” Draco snapped. “Forgive me for questioning your sanity.”
Harry slung his shirt over his shoulders and began to button it up slowly. “I’ll just make sure to look pretty, then.”
“Only if I’m winning.”
The unnamed feeling grew, bursting within his chest. He’d always secretly admired Potter, respected him for what he’d done for the world, but, Merlin…
“What kind of inhibitor?” Potter asked suddenly, taking a seat on one of the wooden chairs lining the wall.
“Better?”
Because the curse hadn’t needed to make Draco love Potter, after all; it had only needed to make Draco remember him. Draco had done the rest.
“Yes.” Draco felt like he was treading on broken glass. “Things will just return to how they were before. It was a silly idea, after all, really. We’d need to be married before Pansy would believe it, and even then, she wouldn’t trust me.”
Harry froze, holding himself still as his attention switched instantaneously from the sensations on his cock to Draco’s worried face.
Weasley stepped forward. “Yeah, we’re his family.”
me. I’m a willing participant, Blaise. Merlin, what do you take me for?”
While Draco cast the diagnostics, Potter grabbed a pot of white, iridescent dust and brought it over to one of the remaining cogs that weren’t illuminated. The last of the mechanism around them began to glow, eclipsing the other colours in a light that seemed to make the very air around them shimmer.
But he’d said he would worship Potter—all of him. So he stepped back and ran his eyes over Potter’s figure, relishing the hitch of breath he received in return, the strange hint of shyness. He put aside his feelings for the night and focused on the man before him.
“Do we need you to swear an Oath?” Potter asked, one eyebrow raised. “We didn’t realise Parkinson had heard anything, or we’d have made her swear one too.”
They fell into a comfortable silence, shoulders brushing against each other occasionally but for the most part they were separate, enjoying the company but lost in their own worlds.
Draco and Harry leaned closer to the window to watch. Down below, a group of kids were huddled by the fence line with several cartons of eggs in their hands.
“Right,” he said a little weakly. “I’ll just go… do that.”
It was a good brew, based on petals from the Dendrobium chrysotoxum—the Gold orchid, said to bring youthful qualities through its elixir. Potter didn’t deserve it.
“Thank you.”
“I took a wild guess that the peacock keeper would manage just fine.” Potter bared his teeth in a smile, watching Draco over the top of his coffee mug. “Do you want to know what the plan is?”
Transfiguring the book into a fish, Harry throws it into the ocean. With any luck, a shark will eat it.
Potter’s eyes crinkled in amusement. “You’re
Someone would see. It was perfect, and if Draco took rather more pleasure from the touch than he was meant to, it was no one’s business but his own.
Potter ducked behind the garden doors and stood in the shadow. Draco rather thought this was getting a bit ridiculous, but he followed all the same. Apparently, it was not a moment too soon, as a tall, blonde woman immediately emerged and looked around the garden, eyes piercing. She eventually decided on the far corner and set off down the path.
“Are you sure—” Draco began, but he had to pause to regain his voice, make it sound like he wasn’t falling apart at the seams. “Are you sure you want me like this? You could have me on my knees again.”
, he thought, and when he opened his eyes for a moment the look on Potter’s face made him worry he’d said it out loud. He caught his reflection in the mirror by the door and saw the golden Veela eyes were back. He suspected they wouldn’t disappear again, not until the curse was done.
Hermione rolled her eyes—a gesture Harry very rarely saw her make. “Yes. Yes, I remember. And when he found out about Dean and Seamus he was
“If you wrote anything more, I’d have no room left for my skin,” Draco said drily.
Draco looked around at the strange walls, remembering all the times they’d commented on how odd it was that they’d appeared inside the curse rather than in front of it.
“Why didn’t you clue into the prophecy when you knew I was the Veela?” he snapped. “You’re meant to be the smart one, these days.”
them egg your house?”
“They still don’t know what the inhibitor is,” Potter admitted, his voice oddly subdued. “What it did to Ron is the most information we have on it.”
It was too much, and suddenly all he could think about was how much of a farce it all was. He’d been so anxious to get it right, for it to be perfect, and here he was: slipping out of Draco every other stroke. It was too funny. He couldn’t stop the laughter as it spilled out of him, and looking at Draco was only making it worse.
Potter regarded him, green eyes piercing in the low light. He’d watched Draco the entire time he’d walked over, barely moving at all except for his eyes which tracked Draco’s slow progress through the crowd.
For a moment, Draco was flattered. Then, the rest of Potter’s words sank in.
“Not here,” Draco protested faintly. “I want a bed for that.”
Pansy laughed and strode over to join them, linking her arm with Granger. “I was just telling them.”
“How do you make so much mess?” Malfoy asks, giving his head a little shake and finally turning to him with a strange smile on his face. “It looks as though ten people live here.”
He hitched his towel tighter around his hips and went to get dressed.
A hazy mist engulfed the bed, sweet in the air like honeysuckle.
Draco was holding himself very carefully now. Harry felt him start to lift his head up, presumably to look at Harry and ask him what the fuck he was going on about, but Harry quickly grabbed a hold of his shoulder and pushed lightly, the gesture a plea to wait. Slowly, Draco dropped back down.
“We have to stop meeting like this,” he muttered, before he woke up a little more and remembered that he hated Potter.
“Don’t whack anyone with it!”
“No, don’t do it!” one of them yelled while the others all covered their heads.
The way Potter said it, it sounded so matter-of-fact, almost peaceful. Like lancing a wound. But Draco knew better.
They stared at one another for several moments, guilt written all across Kalen’s face. Before they could speak, a whirring sound filled the room. Draco looked over at Potter, and saw him staring at his pocket in alarm. Draco realised what was happening a second before a brilliant white light filled the room and everything disappeared.
Harry stops dead. Shit.
He didn’t think it was only flashbacks. He’d seen Potter that night, seen how he reacted to the memory of the most traumatic events of his life. Draco didn’t pretend to be an expert, but his gut was telling him something else was happening too.
The words caught on the air, changing it, changing them. Potter cleared his throat. “How does raising peacocks make amends for”—he waved his hand at the board—“all those families?”
Malfoy hummed, leafing through
“Where’s the romance?” he drawled with his usual smugness.
He’d only been back in England for three days, and in that time he’d already been accosted by Pansy and Blaise on no less than four occasions. Pansy had been easily mollified with the boxes of jewelry, but Blaise had been harder to deter. He’d popped around every morning since Draco had arrived, bringing with him a box of pastries and strong coffee which he traded for Draco’s vulnerability. At least insomuch as Draco was prepared to give it.
The vision faded, leaving Draco shaking, angry, and alone.
The three of them fell back in their seats in laughter. Draco tried to contain his smile; it was all going perfectly.
“How can you stand it?” Weasley sat forward on the chaise, elbows propped on his knees and a deep frown on his face.
But the words were doing something strange.
He came to a halt at the foot of Ron’s bed and resisted the urge to shuffle his feet like an awkward schoolboy.
“I can feel it now,” he said. “I couldn’t before because I had nothing to compare it to. These last few weeks have been intense. I met someone—well, I’ve known them a long time but never really
He couldn’t quite connect to the idea. It didn’t feel real. So much so, that he was still trying to find an appropriate expression of joy when Potter emerged from the shower, clothed in loose black pyjamas he had borrowed from Draco and towelling his hair.
“Oi.” Potter nudged him lightly, an affectionate smile on his face.
“Fucking try me.”
There was no heat to his insult, though, and even if there had been, Harry was riding too high on excitement and nervousness to really have cared. Instead, he squeezed Malfoy despite his grumpy protest, and let him to his silence.
“Makes no difference,” Malfoy said, his voice a little rough.
Harry’s heart was beating quickly. He fancied Malfoy might be able to hear it with how loud it felt in his ears.
He couldn’t risk Pansy catching onto them already. They needed to move forward.
“Not yet,” he said quietly. “But I will. We’ll solve this, Potter, I promise.”
“You’re smart,” Potter said sincerely. “And you understand finance.”
it became real—its foundations were all wrong. I just wanted to fix that.”
I may be a bit clueless when it comes to other people, sometimes, but I do know that. It’s really just about being honest, mate. Not just out loud, but to yourself—for the parts inside that hurt too much to admit.
“Tomorrow?” he asked anxiously.
He’s never been someone who argued over tea before. Sure, he prefers things the way he likes them, but he’s fine with a little bit of change here and there. He doesn’t mind trying new things, even if the new tea Draco bought him was absolutely horrid. But the last few weeks have been nothing
Potter glared at him mutely but didn’t respond.
“What if it doesn’t work?” Potter asked, his finger tracing an idle line around the lip of his glass of scotch. “What then?”
“You’re doing this deliberately,” he said, keeping his voice slow and careful. “I don’t know why, but you are. And while we’re at it, how exactly were you going to finish that sentence before? You never took me as a what? Because if you’re going to start trying to use—” he trailed off and waved his hand vaguely in the air, “—this against me, what we have, what we’re doing, then… Well, why are we even doing this in the first place?”
“Wasn’t sure if I was on the wards,” Potter admitted, glancing up at him briefly before turning his attention back to cleaning.
I don’t know if this is some sort of test or something, but I’m ready for your next letter… Where do you want me to visit next? I promise I won’t hound you to meet me.
Several times since that second night, Harry had very nearly walked in on a number of people about to get a shag on on the way to their rooms. He’d gone beet red and stammered out an apology before hastily, and clumsily, backtracking out the way he’d come.
Potter’s mouth twisted into a wry grin. “Figures. What does that mean, then? We’re just stumbling in the dark until we land on a miracle and he wakes up?”
“They shouldn’t speak like that to a kid.”
“Maybe it is. Worried you can’t keep up?”
Draco took a sip and closed his eyes in bliss at the first taste. It was a rich vegetable soup, full of flavour and a sharp tang of spice that he couldn’t name. He arranged his napkin and set to it, trying not to look like he was as starving as he suddenly felt.
“Did you forget something?”
Harry felt like tearing out his hair. Just when he felt he’d begun to figure out Malfoy, he pulled something like this and Harry couldn’t make heads or tails of him. After last night’s conversation, he’d expected… he didn’t know what he expected, but reverting back to snappish, standoffish, teenage Malfoy wasn’t it. The night before, he’d said he was trying. What exactly that meant, Harry wasn’t sure, but it sounded like… self-improvement, maybe? Not being such an arse at the very least.
“Clearly.”
He turned to Potter and saw him already holding the inhibitor in his palm, a fierce determination in his eyes.
Harry tossed back the gin that Malfoy had bought him twenty minutes ago—it burned on the way down—and left.
He didn’t mean his flat, his living room; he meant
He was hard again before long, and he could feel from the way Malfoy carefully tried to avoid brushing against him that he was, too. His hands fell to Malfoy’s chest, to his stomach, to his hips, and he hovered there, nervous but eager for more.
Draco raised his eyebrows and turned to his friend. “I did not know that.”
Granger rolled her eyes, but it was lost beneath Pansy’s effusive agreement.
“Giving or receiving?” Harry asked cautiously.
It was nice to spend time with someone just for the sake of their company, not because of some overdue obligation. Not that Draco only saw his friends out of obligation, but it was different. There was an unspoken list of items to update each other on, past conversations to relay and gossip about, mutual enemies to diss. Conversation with Potter was more honest, freer.
It was only after the morning sun was well above his kitchen window that Draco realised Potter hadn’t shown any sign of knowing Draco was part Veela at all.
Potter levelled him with a stare. “I don’t know,” he said pointedly. “It aches a bit, but since this is only a metaphysical representation of the curse rather than a real room, for all I know I’m bleeding to death on your workroom floor. There’s nothing we can do about it now, so let’s just get started.”
The days passed by, and for the most part, things were different. Nice, soothing,
When he stumbles into the kitchen, eyes still heavy, the sight of Draco nearly takes his breath away. Straight after the war, Draco went through an intense phase where he wore nothing but Muggle fashion; it was one of the things that made Harry stop and pay attention to him. Harry couldn’t even attempt to name the labels Draco is wearing, but the tight cut of his jeans coupled with the rolled-up sleeves of his shirt make him want to grab hold of his man and drag him straight back up to bed.
Malfoy was trying to—bizarrely—be a better person, but he was still as much of a prick as he’d ever been.
Plus, he thinks old Dazza who works at the petrol station has been giving him the eye, and after several strained conversations that Harry swears weren’t in English, he isn’t certain he possesses the vocabulary to let the man down gently.
To his surprise, Potter grinned.
Malfoy was here, and that was what mattered. It was as though Harry was warm again for the first time in months.
“Could you help us fill out Mr. Potter’s forms? It will only take a moment; we just need a few contact details. You’re his partner, is that correct?”
“Alright. You?” Potter shuffled his feet.
The answer was so free of duplicity, so honest and simple, that Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face. After a few seconds, Potter returned it—sleepy and soft around the edges.
“I’m sorry I trespassed,” Potter said slowly, and the bastard even sounded like he meant it. “I didn’t mean to make you feel… unsafe.”
How did Potter see himself?
Potter opened his eyes, and the storm of emotions were gone, leaving a horrible, blank emptiness in their wake. He drained his glass in a single gulp and wiped his mouth.
And he really wanted the answer. Potter seemed to know something Draco didn’t, and since Draco’s own research diving into his ancestral books had proven largely unhelpful, he wanted to know what it was.
He felt something for Potter, felt something for a man who was deeply, undeniably, troubled. A man who was pretending to love him, and who desperately needed love himself—whether he knew it or not.
“What,” he said, “as in you’re
Potter’s brows drew down, fury flashing across his face for a split second before being replaced by something darker.
Draco waited. In a few moments, his patience was rewarded.
Potter waggled his eyebrows at him. “Should’ve checked that one out, I reckon.”
He cleared his throat. “Potter.”
In the end, he just dropped his head down onto Potter’s shoulder and held him close.
Malfoy hugged him. The velvet of his dressing gown was warm as Malfoy slid his arms around Harry’s waist, even through the layer of Harry’s pyjamas, and before he knew what he was doing, he was hugging Malfoy back. He buried his face in the soft material of Malfoy’s shoulders, closing his eyes into the warmth and clean—oddly sweet—smell from the fabric.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “It’s different.”
“What? Never mind. I’m assuming the pleasure is enough to provide the motivation itself. Or maybe it’s an organic confluence. Under the right circumstances with the right components, it just… happens.”
“What?” he squeaked when he’d managed to recover. How the hell had they known? He hadn’t looked any different in the mirror since his encounter with Malfoy the other day. It wasn’t like there was a flashing sign over his head that read “NOT STRICTLY A VIRGIN ANYMORE”. It didn’t work that way, did it? He hadn’t known for months when Ron and Hermione had given theirs up. “How—when—I—”
“They like to wait for confirmation,” Potter said darkly. “But that doesn’t help the Muggle family at all. Do you know what Muggles think of magic that can’t be explained?”
His entire body cringed in embarrassment, and he moved to take a step backward, but suddenly Malfoy’s hand enclosed around his wrist, and Harry couldn't breathe.
It was, he decided, a little messy, and he wasn’t sure he had enough room to move, though from the sounds he was making, Malfoy wasn’t complaining.
He paused and then seemed to slump forward. “Okay, fine, I’m not dealing with this too well, all right? And when you had a go at me for drinking on the job I ended up going to the Ministry and researching all night.” He gave a wry grin. “It was that, or drink another bottle of whiskey.”
Draco mentally added “mind-reader” to the dubious list of things he guessed Unspeakables did.
Granger cast a glance towards the door and worried her lip with her teeth. Finally, she turned back to him and leaned closer. Pansy and Weasley leant in unconsciously.
Draco paused a moment, eyes unfocused as he stared at his pinboard. So near the end, and those final steps felt insurmountable. The closer he came to wiping his debt, the less he believed he deserved to.
Draco had a single moment to think that he could look into those eyes forever before they disappeared and the world went black.
Draco felt like his skin was humming, burning with something unnamed and unknown. He allowed himself to fall into a quiet space that he rarely indulged in for fear of ambush—watching, listening, waiting. There was something comforting about Potter’s presence in his kitchen, making notes and humming to himself out of tune.
Harry wondered if there was a great big sign painted on his forehead. “Yeah,” he said, then filled his mouth with three forkfuls of food so he didn’t have to answer anymore questions.
Draco waited for Potter to lunge at him, braced for the fight and—truthfully—begging for it. It had been a long time since he’d brawled with Potter, and while the circumstances of their assignment required them to remain civil with each other, if Potter was going to turn up drunk just so that he could stomach the sight of Draco, clearly more drastic measures were required.
“It’s nice out here,” Malfoy said, and it sounded like an apology.
Malfoy was sitting on his bed, watching Harry as he fussed at his desk.
He focused on the way Malfoy’s cock felt in his hand, trying to pay attention to the times when Malfoy’s grip would become loose and his mouth would open in ecstasy, so that he could do it again. It was difficult because it felt like every part of his being was centered on the hand around his cock and the careful way that Malfoy was stroking him.
“Are you all right?” The words came out before he could rethink them.
Malfoy gaped at him, for some reason unsure of how to answer. Harry was just about ready to take it as a ‘no’ and reassure Malfoy that he was still happy to be friends, or whatever the hell they were, when Malfoy pulled himself together and visibly relaxed.
“Can’t complain.” Blaise studied him closely, then Draco, where he stared in particular at Draco’s new-coloured eyes, then back to Potter. “What did you say this curse was again?”
Now that he was faced with the real thing, he was beginning to wonder if there was more to it. If maybe these small changes that Malfoy was making didn’t extend to something more, something deeper. Which meant that Harry might have to change too.
Harry nodded, and Malfoy dropped back down so they were side by side, rocking gently into each other’s hands with their foreheads pressed together. It took him a moment to find a rhythm, with Malfoy grinding up against him, and it was doubly hard because he was lying on his right side and could only move his arm in tiny strokes. He switched to his left hand, and Malfoy’s head dropped back against the pillow, his mouth falling open with a gasp.
It wasn’t that the smell was bad; he was disgusted that it smelled so nice. He wanted to lean into Potter and just breathe in the scent of his collar.
“Yeah, well… yeah,” he said lamely, giving Malfoy the hairy eyeball, like he couldn’t believe Malfoy was capable of saying something that mostly lacked vitriol.
Potter laughed, an odd look in his eye. “No,” he said, glancing at the device on his wrist and jerking his head towards the door. The herbs must be done. “No, my house is very quiet,” he added, chewing on his lip thoughtfully. “Most of the time, there’s only myself for company, really.”
The peacock crept closer, closer, and as Draco suddenly registered the present day again, she darted forward and bit Blaise on the bum, warbling as he yelled and hunting for the grain in Draco’s basket.
the new bar down the end of the strip.
This sounds like a treasure hunt! Is there a prize?
“For getting yourself cursed and volunteering me as executioner? You’re lucky I haven’t just given into the curse and called it divine retribution.”
each other. I don’t know what she was thinking—sticking you two together. I reckon one of you’ll be in the infirmary by the end of week.”
Draco huffed a laugh against his chest and then pulled them back onto the bed. “You should probably undress me then,” he said, looking far more imperious than someone lying down should have the right to look.
“Not exactly,” Draco said ruefully. “Did you have any trouble getting the peafowl sent over?”
“Oh my
“This is insane,” Draco said without thinking.
to change course that it had finally started working again. Of course, that had meant enhancing the link between the pair so it was exciting and new, which didn’t exactly relate to Horcruxes.
“That’s impossible,” Draco whispered. “No one can change a prophecy.”
Is that the excuse you’re using for this terrible handwriting? I’ve known you since you were eleven; you needn’t bother.
They fell apart, breathing ragged as they sank into the mattress, hands and legs brushing. The mist trailed above them, a comforting bubble of separation from the world. One that Harry thought, now that he'd had it for even just a moment, he might not need anymore.
Malfoy smiled and nodded. “Let’s get out of here.”
“Absolutely awful,” Harry agreed happily as they calmed down, wiping a rogue tear that’d escaped off his cheek with the heel of his hand.
“Well, this is professional,” Draco muttered, steadying himself against the desk in the back room of the shop.
Malfoy’s veneer broke, and Harry saw a glimpse of what was beneath: surprise, warmth, desire. Perhaps something else, hidden deep behind the others.
“Pretty good,” Harry managed to say, his own voice choked and urgent.
Three hours later, his mild frustration had given way to something new. It was an insidious feeling, something faint and barely within reach. The more he read, the more it grew, steadily creeping along his spine until he could feel it thudding in every pulse of his heartbeat and he had to shove the book away. After several seconds of chilling silence, he realised it was despair.
Potter ran a hand through his hair. “The Veela I’ve… annoyed… lives in the hills along the border of this sanctuary,” he said, making Draco’s stomach dip. “I’ve seen it flying after midnight.”
“I have been well.” As he said the words, he acknowledged both the truth in them and the lie he hadn’t wanted to admit, even with everything that had happened. “But I should have come to see you sooner. Not even because of all this, but—” he stalled, trying to think of the words while Eleanor sat patiently and waited. “I don’t think we ever finished here. I just sort of… disappeared.”
Draco felt his stomach flutter pleasantly, and he bit back what he sure was an embarrassingly giddy smile.
Even as he continues to thrust, unable to look away from the eager desire in Malfoy’s eyes, he promises himself he will never do this again. Malfoy’s lips are slick with his own saliva now, the quick slide of his head as he bobs on Harry’s cock becoming sloppy, impatient. He pulls his hand away, both hands now resting on Harry’s hips, and closes his eyes. It is so clear that he is giving himself over to it, to the taste and feel of Harry’s cock, that Harry quickly feels his balls begin to tighten, his orgasm rushing upon him.
having sex for real, was overwhelming, and several times, he had to reach down and give himself a squeeze when he got too excited and thought he might come right then and there, just from fingering Draco and seeing and hearing him respond. Soon, he had three fingers thrusting in and out.
“Cut the crap. You know what I am now.”
“Who said Gryffindors can’t be crafty?”
“No,” he dragged the vowel out. “But it would help me probably figure out how to make things more, erm, pleasurable for you in future? I can go first if you like. I liked it. I
That was one thing he hadn’t expected—how calm Malfoy was. He’d never exactly been the kind of person Harry would turn to in a crisis, and he’d assumed their time together would be spent with Malfoy periodically breaking down into minor histrionic fits. Like usual. Instead, he was eerily focused for the entire day they’d spent together so far.
“Oh,” Draco murmured, too relieved to see with his own eyes that Potter wasn’t in the middle of doing something rash and stupid. Probably. “Forgive me for attempting a little courtesy. Potter, do you really live like this?”
Still, he was a professional, and Potter was an idiot, so he pushed the thought out of his mind as best he could. By the time he opened the door to Potter that afternoon, he was more likely to hex him than snog him, and that was exactly how Draco liked it.
Yours.
It wasn’t the fast, urgent prelude that Draco was used to when he took men home from the bar. The heat simmered below Draco’s skin, begging for an outlet, but he refused to rush. He wanted to savor this, to capture every moment in his memory. Potter’s eyes were heavy-lidded now, and it wasn’t just with desire. They were both a little tired, a little lethargic in a way that made Draco
“Potter,” he said, spinning him around and pulling him into a bruising kiss. “I am going to
The quiet sound of someone clearing their throat made Draco spin around. The shopkeeper was staring at the two of them, eyes wide, and he realised with slowly dawning horror that he knew her.
Pansy frowned at him. “Blaise?”
“Well, she’s gone and made you my soulmate,” Draco said flatly as he pushed away from the sink and walked towards the bathroom. “So I’d say take it up with her, but it looks like you’re in agreement—she wants to punish me for eternity, as well.”
“Of course, Professor.”
“Hey, Harry,” they chorused, seeing him. Ron did a doubletake. “And Malfoy?”
“What the fuck is a hydrangea?”
Malfoy,
Malfoy dropped his head lower until he was mouthing at Harry’s top button. Then, with a faint pop, he pulled it open with his teeth.
Draco’s mouth went dry; he hoped it didn’t take years.
Harry managed to make it all the way to the shower this time, though the memory of that wink had spilling over onto the tiles, moaning and thrusting into his hand, within seconds.
Malfoy recovered first, but not into his perpetual state of calm. Instead, the same shrewd expression Harry had seen earlier crept across his features. It took gargantuan effort for Harry not to respond to that expression with even more anger, but after a few slow breaths, he fought it down.
“Anyway,” Harry said. “Why are you lot laughing? It’s not that funny.”
Occasionally, the music buzzed through him in a particular rhythm that made his mouth go dry and his eyes search for the exits, but he wasn’t the only one. He would be alone, drifting, for only a second, and then Ron would see, rest a hand on his shoulder, and together they’d come back from that hidden place inside them that was more terrifying than dying had ever been. Or Hermione’s hand would suddenly be in his, leading him onto the dance floor and holding him close until the sound of the music drowned out everything else. Or Neville would suddenly be at his side, trying to teach him how to do the jitterbug to deep house music that thudded somewhere inside his chest and laughing, laughing, until they fell in a heap on the dance floor. And he did the same for them.
He’d just come from an incredibly dry and vicious seminar about the theory of Transfiguration that had lasted five long, ghastly hours, when he stumbled across yet another couple. This time, with the rules of intent when intending to perform a Transfiguration still ringing in his ears, Harry didn’t have the energy to be mortified.
“Ah.” Draco stepped a little further into the shadow of their corner.

Potter,
Harry awoke sometime after midnight, but well before dawn could appear. He padded softly out onto the balcony, barefoot despite the chill in the air that soaked up through the stone floor, and kneeled down to study the dial. It hadn’t stopped spinning yet, not that he thought it would, and he quickly moved away before he could feel too queasy watching the movements.
“And does the Great Harry Potter have a plan to appease this nesting mother?” Draco couldn’t resist asking, rankled that Potter had come up with so many ridiculous theories without ever thinking to ask for his help.
“Yeah. I caught her whispering to the other attendant when we were leaving, pointing our way. Might even get something in the
find it."
"You mean you do know it?" she asked rapidly.
The lack of response he got from Iana wasn't exactly positive, but it wasn't another 'no', so maybe it still counted? He wasn't sure how long they sat there, the pregnant silence filling the corridor.
knowing was perhaps more dangerous than knowing. It is not the same for you. Please, Effie. Just a few minutes."
She shrugged, clearly attempting to make it look like it didn't matter. "All I knew is that Professor Dumbledore turned up, and they were arguing about telling you something. Guess they've decided to do it."
Then, the shadow seemed to realise who it was who had summoned the fire, its baleful red gaze turning to Iana. Harry had only a second to erect a shield between her and the soul-thing, but with only a moment to spare, his glittering silver shield sent the thing rebounding back. It twisted back and forth in the air, almost as if it was thinking, before it split in two. One part of it descended upon Harry, while the other caromed off a huge wardrobe set into the wall of the crater of junk, and around his shield to attack Iana.
I'm really heartened by the response to this. I thought it would be a much less popular concept than it seems it is. Hope I can keep it up!
"It is a lot, I know," said Dumbledore, seemingly reading Harry's mind. "Yet I find myself without other recourse should the worst come to pass. I ask only that you consider carefully whom you wish to tell. Should Voldemort become aware that we know of this he will surely take actions to further protect himself."
"Only by like a year and a half!" Effie shot back.
This time, she glared at him. "If you don't want to help, then maybe you could fuck off." She tapped the page of her book. "Somewhere in one of these books is the first thing my father ever took away from me. What does it matter if there is some magical significance to it or not? I want it back."
"Look at Mum and Dad," she said, her voice becoming stronger with every moment. "They lived through much worse than this when they were our age, and they didn't push their friends away. They didn't lock themselves up. If he does come back, we're gonna need
The Diadem of Ravenclaw, though, was almost legendary. It was said that it could confer the wisdom of Ravenclaw herself to the wearer.
"Here, what's got you two creasing," asked Dean as he entered only seconds before the train began pulling from the station. He looked at Neville and Seamus. "What's gotten into them?"
"No!" she said instantly. "No, don't do that." She looked off to the side, and waved at someone unseen somewhere down the train. The smile she favoured the unseen person with was forced, but probably only Harry, or their parents would have been able to tell. "Look. Whatever it is that's going on— we can't just… stop. That's what you've been doing for weeks. Did it help anything? Maybe he'll never come back."
"You sure that's not what Harry's going to be doing?" Dean asked. Harry wasn't sure if he was oblivious, or merely happy to play along with Effie's needling.
"So it's to do with you and the Dark Lord?" she asked, eyes wide. "What did it say?"
"Alas, it is not," Dumbledore replied as he shook his head. "It is our belief that Voldemort opted for creating six Horcruxes, and as you will no doubt appreciate, only four have so far been accounted for."
Well, that didn't sound ominous at all. "I'm sure you'll find out soon enough," he said.
"This is a detention, not a house-witch gossip circle," he drawled, not looking up from whatever it was that he was so focused on. "As such, it will be completed in silence."
"I'm okay Mum," he said reassuringly, even managing a smile to back his words up. "No major damage. Effie'll be fine too."
He nearly walked into Iana's back as she stopped dead, hand outstretched to grasp the door knob. After a moment, and without saying anything more, she released a long breath, and pulled the door open. "Well," she said a little shakily. "I guess we can feed two crups with one bone."
"It means he tried to give me up before too," she said bitterly and finally her eyes started to fill with tears. "I dream about it sometimes. I just thought it was a dream. I can hear a voice, I think it's my mother, pleading with someone to let me live, and I can hear my father trying to get her to step aside. Then there's a flash of green light, and I wake up. The bastard tried to trade me for his own life when I was a baby, and then he did it
name, and said they could always have another child together." She looked up. "Even said he'd hope for a boy this time. Wanted to call him Draco."
While Effie had been discharged from the Infirmary on the same day as Voldemort's attack, Lily, James and Sirius had all been kept in much longer. Of the three of them, Lily was the least injured, but the spell which had killed Dumbledore had still near liquidised her insides. It was only the quick intervention of Madam Pomfrey and the small team of medical orderlies and medics who were part of the Order that had saved her.
Seamus had to slap Dean's hand away when he reached out to tickle the tip of his ear.
"That's fine too," said Harry, utterly lost. "How about we just sit here for a bit then?"
There was no response.
“We’re missing something,” Potter agreed.
Draco looked at Potter properly then, for the first time, and he was thrown by the strength of the bitterness he saw there. Potter was staring at the package without moving, his eyes lost in thought. Had Potter always looked like that? In school, he’d always seemed to take an attack like a personal challenge, rising to meet it and all that Gryffindor rot. Potter didn’t look like a Gryffindor right now; he looked jaded and full of harsh edges.
They sat on the other end of the couch, Malfoy by the armrest so Harry was closer to Ron and Hermione.
Potter laughed. “All right, considering.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “So, naturally, you take me here for our first date. Typical. I feel like a werewolf who’s been unwillingly scent-marked.”
“Missing me already?”
“Does that mean you’re going to be an aloof wanker now?”
Against his better judgement, Draco refilled Potter’s glass. Fortunately, Potter chose to sip this time.
Harry frowned, turning back to look at him. “I’m not doing this out of guilt.”
“I do have one question,” George said sheepishly. “I don’t understand how you can know that at all if you can’t remember what happens while you’re working. That’s right, isn’t it?”
He felt the smile against his skin.
“I carried your wand, Malfoy,” Potter muttered, expression fierce. “I know how it felt. A Unicorn hair core? In a wand that had been used for the Dark Arts for more than a year? That wand should never have worked, not just for me, but for
“Coffee? Tea? Something stronger?”
Potter’s answering smile warmed him far more than the Firewhisky that already thrummed in his veins.
“Er…” Harry started.
“Then, let us begin,” he gritted out instead.
Draco felt hands on his shoulders pulling him back. He fell into the person holding him and began to shake.
“So, how do we do this?” Potter asked. “Do you want to hear what I need so that you can tell me how much it will cost? Or do you want to just list off the ways it won’t work before we get started?”
Then Draco stood, crossed the room, and kissed him. His lips were gentle at first, questioning, waiting. When Harry’s hand—his left hand, still clean and dry—slid to the back of Draco’s neck and tugged him closer, Draco stopped holding back.
Potter raised one eyebrow. “So, you can insult the way I live, but I can’t ask a simple question?”
Harry gripped the sill, shaking and trying to regain his breath. “God, I think it’s just encouraged them.”
Harry snorted, but crawled onto the bed anyway.
He never claimed to be well adjusted.
Then the hand was guiding him, drawing him back and pushing him lightly onto the floor. Draco hovered over him, eyes heavy-lidded with desire but warm with something else, something more than lust, as he undid Harry’s fly and pulled his jeans slowly down. Harry’s head fell back at the sensation of Draco’s lips closing over him, and his world narrowed to the subtle give and take of their wordless conversation. His hand guided Draco faster, slower, softer, while Draco’s lips answered him eagerly, willingly.
Harry can’t quite manage a response, but he does succeed in dragging Draco free from the circle while the lads cheer and another man refills the shoe and takes his place.
Potter was already standing, Accioing his coat from the coat room. “Severity one,” he said shortly. “If it’s one of my cases, it’ll be an open security breach with threat to kill.”
The nurse smiled at him. “In that case, please come through. The rest of you will be able to visit shortly.”
That was how the curse worked. It spread through physical contact, lying dormant for up to two weeks or until the person displayed a heightened emotion. It could be joy, fear, anger… didn’t matter what. The witch or wizard’s heart rate escalated, their amygdala activating, and somewhere in the midst of physiological and hormonal responses, the curse ignited.
“Get over it, Malfoy,” Potter laughed, true relief infesting his voice, and then in a gesture Draco had no way of predicting, he picked Draco up and spun him around in a delighted circle.
, Potter.”
Draco gaped at him. “A tree? A forest? Not your house?”
Potter laughed humorlessly while Granger got that far-off look in her eye that suggested she was making Plans. “The stamping isn’t going so well. The incident was a series of attacks on some shops in that little Wizarding shopping district in Bath. They used illegal potions, which means they were smuggled in, and given how hard the Ministry has been focusing on
,” Potter cut back, voice rising to the familiar pitch Draco recalled from their last years together at school.
“Draco, can I have a word?” she asked quietly, and that caution in her voice, more than anything else, sent warning bells ringing in his head.
“What do you think it means?”
Potter’s voice, though back to his normal timbre, still grated like metal over concrete. Draco tried to think back to the moments before the explosion; had he still sounded like this? Draco thought he had, but at the time it had seemed plausible that he was just irritated at his secret being compromised. That answer no longer seemed so likely.
To Draco’s horror, Potter’s voice broke on the final words. He wondered distantly if he was about to see him cry. The cold, clinical walls of St Mungos were oppressive and bleak; Draco could think of nowhere worse to spend your final days, lying in a coma before dying on a surgery table. At least there were no barbaric practices like in Muggle hospitals, with knives and skewers and whatever else they jabbed inside you, but it was a small relief.
Will you send me some perfume?
But, as it turns out, running into Draco being accosted by boisterous Australian lads with a fetish for British accents levels the playing field. It’s difficult to be suspicious of your childhood arch enemy when you’ve just rescued them from something you don’t quite—and don’t want to—understand, and Harry supposes it’s difficult to plot dastardly things when your mouth still tastes like a stranger’s tinea.
Dressing gown clutched around his thin frame, Draco had tugged open the Sanctuary’s front door at midnight—equal parts concerned and infuriated by the incessant knocking—and found the Saviour of the Wizarding World slumped against the doorframe. He shook his head, the remnants of a strange dream fading rapidly away, along with the repeated words
They followed Seamus up the stairs, and Harry realised that, sadly, their room
,” Hermione muttered, her cheeks flaming. “Quick, let’s go. We don’t need to hear that.”
A sinking feeling settled deep in Draco’s gut. “No?”
He turned away and they went through the rest of the questions quickly, finding—somewhat alarmingly—that they had guessed every one correctly. The parchment wiped itself clean just as they were about to stand up and hand it in—well before the other groups had finished—and several new questions appeared.
A prophecy-child.
After the party, he and Potter made sure to keep their distance for a few days. They wanted to give people time to speculate, to guess what might be happening between the two of them. Someone had obviously gone to the press, since articles in the
When they were positioned the way Harry wanted, he pulled the stopper on the vial. It was much less viscous than he had been expecting, and more came out than he had anticipated, coating his hand in the slippery substance. Some of it dripped slickly between his fingers and landed on the bedspread. Throughout it all, Malfoy watched him with a smarmy expression. He canted his hips up invitingly, and Harry took the hint, replacing the stopper on the vial and tossing it to the side as he moved back between Malfoy’s thighs.
George eyed Kalen, one arm hooked around Morgan’s shoulder. His face was unreadable, which was surely not a good sign.
He slid slowly to the base, eyes on Draco the entire time, before retreating backwards and pulling off with a faint
“How is work?” he asked after the silence began to stretch too long.
He spotted Draco immediately and hurried over, resting his hand on the shoulder that Weasley wasn’t currently holding.
“I think you weren’t really looking close enough, Malfoy,” George said, but the twinkle in his eyes showed he wasn’t really angry.
“We won’t be,” Harry promised, unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, slow and unhurried.
Potter turned to him in horror, but then his eyes fell on Morgan and Draco knew he’d seen it too. He staggered to his feet but seemed to lose all momentum as he stood there, just staring at her.
“Oh,” he half moaned. “Oh, is that it?”
The undeniable look of relief on Potter’s face stayed with Draco for the rest of the day.
The smile became real, just for a second. “You have Malfoy to thank for that, actually.” He nodded to Draco. “He made it work.”
“Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess,” Weasley said brightly. “Mum and dad are out at the theatre, so we’ve all popped in to give the house a bit of a blitz for them.”
It was easier not to accept.
Harry cringed. He had no idea what he was saying. The whole point of it was that he hadn’t been thinking when he’d said it. He moved uncomfortably on the bed.
“I’m going to—” Harry began, but broke off, burying his face in Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy stroked him through his orgasm until Harry pulled away with a gasp and flopped back against the pillows. “Just a sec,” he breathed.
But intention aside, time was of the essence, because it was clear their sender was only getting more invested. And with such unpredictable, amateur magic, who knew what the next parcel would do? It was probably some pimple-faced fifteen-year-old wanting the attention of the Saviour and his friends, and the longer he was ignored the more desperate he could become.
Potter’s eyes met his through the crowd, and he felt a jolt of something uncertain race through him, like maybe he was meant to be there with him. He was hit again by the strange thought that there was something he and Potter knew, something that was theirs alone, but he just couldn’t quite grasp a hold of it.
The question was quiet, respectful. Draco wouldn’t have known Potter had it in him.
The sigh was almost inaudible. Almost. “Sunlight seems to dull the exposure risk. Not eliminate, but dull.”
Malfoy wasn’t a virgin. Far from it.
“What’s going on?” He laughed, cold and bitter and awful. “What’s going on is that I’ve never fucking won anything in my life, and you’re somehow all so fooled into thinking I’m a
“Where is your wand?” he asked, realising that he had barely seen Harry hold it since he arrived here.
Harry drew in a breath. Malfoy was watching him with hungry eyes, and Harry no longer knew if it was for his body or for the words he was saying or if it was just for him… just him.
Perhaps he could at least work out what it was and get a message to McGonagall. Then he could confer with whatever expert they actually needed. Be a third party go-between or something.
“Two teas, two hot chocolates, extra marshmallows and whipped cream if they’ve got it.”
“I didn’t know soulmates felt like this,” Draco said before he could stop himself.
“You already knew that, though.” Draco smiled over his mug.
He sagged against the floor, lost and alone.
“Lovelorn gazes?!” Potter spat, gripping the paper so hard it tore a little. “What the hell does she mean
“What was that?” Morgan asked tentatively.
“Of course,” Draco said, thrown. “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name?”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief when Iana silenced the girl. Despite the sudden stoppering of the fountain of words that seemed to flow endlessly from her, she didn't realise for a few seconds. When she finally stopped, Iana responded.
Maybe it was too soon. Maybe it was too quick, but he didn't care.. He didn't need words. He swept her up in his arms and captured her lips with his own.
. Or thought she did at least. She'd died for him, and part of Harry wanted to tear the man apart for what he'd done.
Had Harry not been present, he might never have believed it, but she snorted in an incredibly unladylike fashion. "What gave you
At that moment an orderly burst in through the curtains. "What on earth is going on in here?" he squawked in a voice every bit as grating as a Hippogriff's mating call. "Miss Malfoy requires rest! Not… whatever it is you're in here for, boy. Out. Away with you!"
When Harry opened his mouth to ask the obvious question, he was cut off before he could even start.
Harry stared at her in silence as he tried to digest the words. It was so very similar to the one which Dumbledore had been so certain could apply only to him, and yet the ending of it was different. He frowned. "Did Dumbledore know about it?" he asked carefully.
Seamus looked affronted. "Quidditch!"
Harry tried to find some suitable response to that, but wordless horror held his tongue. There were five more of the things to hunt down? He also still didn't understand what Snape had to do with it all. Did it have something to do with the Prophecy?
"We stand a real chance this year!"
Iana shrugged, and for a moment Harry was distracted by the things it did to her upper body. "I don't really know. It's why he used my blood in the spell to revive himself, though. He said it was old magic. I don't see how it can be that, though. It hasn't protected me from anything he's done since then. I don't even know if it stayed with me after I was a baby."
"Me?"
"We could try asking my mum?" Harry suggested. "She's meant to be pretty good at Charms. Or Flitwick. What with his background, I doubt he's likely to go over to Voldemort."
"The Dark Lord attacked the Manor," she said. Her voice was still raw and sore sounding. She gripped the silvery something in her hand even tighter.
Albus Dumbledore was dead, and no one knew what to do about it.
Harry tried to sit and read, but it was a lost cause. With the strange tension still not really diminished, and Juliet's endless chirpy discourse, he spent most of the time staring at a single page, reading and re-reading the same two or three paragraphs.
Even then, he wasn't entirely sure what it had been about. Mythical hidden rooms in Hogwarts, maybe? Whatever it was, none of the information had made it past his eyeballs.
From the noises she was making through their joined lips, he didn't think she much cared either.
"Well, you found me," Harry replied. "What did you want?"
"Harry," said James, shifting uncomfortably. "As you're now seventeen… well there's something we need to tell you."
The Grey Lady's interjection stopped Iana in her tracks. She blinked. "What?"
Harry wasn't thinking that. If he remembered correctly, it was Crabbe's father who had let Voldemort in.
Harry, grateful that the target had changed weighed in too. "Seven sounds about right."
Harry got the distinct impression that they didn't really know anything more than he did anyway. But how was that even possible?
The classroom itself was every bit as dry and boring as Binns'. There wasn't a single bit of decoration or adornment on the walls. Instead, one wall had been entirely taken over by a huge blackboard, which had the course plan written out on it in full. The floor of the room had ranks of benches, and at the front a single table at which Stump sat, as she always did.
Iana and her father used the brief respite the birds granted them to scramble around the devastated shelves, towards Harry. When Iana realised who it was that had come to her rescue, she stopped dead.
He found Sirius first, but with the amount of spell damage he'd received, it did not bolster Harry's hopes. He was swathed head to toe in bandages, and his body was covered in black, malformed lumps which stunk of death and seemed to have something moving inside them. He tried to ask the orderly who was casting spells over him what was wrong, but it only resulted in him being chased away, and the curtain being pulled around the bed to forestall any further interruptions.
idea?" she asked acerbically.
It seemed reasonable to him. "Does that help us?" he asked.
The journey to the Infirmary didn't take long, and Iana spent most of it in a kind of jumpy silence which Harry had no idea how to break. He tried a little bit of small talk to get her mind off whatever it was that was worrying her so much but in the face of monosyllabic answers he was forced to give up.
Harry cast a silencing charm at the door, grateful that he could finally cast magic at home without the risk of being told off by his parents. He looked at Seamus who pulled out a shrunken bag filled, hopefully with every kind of alcohol the other boy had been able to loot from his dad's liquor cabinet.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What the bloody hell was that?" Harry asked as he steadied himself on the shelf next to him, which wobbled precariously.
"What if I instead told you that you did not?" Dumbledore asked him. "That you could disappear to a different country, far from here? Assume a different identity such that even Voldemort and his followers would be unable to locate you, if they even knew to look? Would you do it?"
Then Harry realised that unlike everyone else in the room, Dumbledore was not holding his wand. Not visibly anyway. His hands were concealed within his robes, but it would surely take him precious moments to pull it out.
The laugh that question prompted was distinctly sardonic. "Didn't you notice? I don't have those any more. Not that they'd need it, anyway."
Harry awoke suddenly as the sound of shouting came from the corridor. It took a few seconds for him to work out where he was, and what had happened but one thing was instantly clear.
"All grown up at last," said Seamus as he brushed an imaginary tear from his eye.
"Including Effie and Ginny," said Harry pointedly. "How do you think Ginny would take the news?"
"I asked her why they'd done it. Why I'd been raised like I had, only so I could die. Why couldn't I at least have had a few happy years if all that was going to happen was Father was going to throw me at Voldemort's feet the first chance he got. I asked why they didn't fight for me like your parents fought for you.
James had been the worst off out of all of them. He'd been on the receiving end of multiple curses, and Pomfrey said it was nothing short of a miracle that he was alive when he'd arrived alongside Sirius in a pillar of phoenix flame. One side of his body had almost been completely burned away, and both his left arm and leg were gone completely. The dark curse that had done so much damage also meant that there was no chance for them to be regrown.
"Good luck, Harry," Ron called as Harry followed Effie out of the room. While it didn't really help the sense of impending doom, the effort was appreciated.
Iana glared at him. "Maybe it would, if I wasn't stuck being a blood traitor myself. In case it has escaped your notice, I'm the Dark Lord's main target. I'd rather the people on my side not be hamstrung by your victim complex."
The feeling of relief when Dumbledore's voice issued from the darkness, closely followed by Dumbledore himself. He was dressed most curiously. Fluffy slippers complete with pompoms, a long robe in incredibly garish purple and yellow, topped off by a floppy sleeping hat.
"If he does come back, I'm going to have to fight," he continued. He lifted Effie's chin up and looked her in the eye. "I don't really know how, but I'm going to do it. I'll keep Mum and Dad safe." For her.
The brewing brawl suddenly faltered as everyone looked at him in surprise. Everyone but Crabbe and Goyle, that is, who merely looked puzzled by the apparent change to the script.
A glance over at Snape gave Harry nothing to work with. His face was not blank, but the grimace he was sporting was common enough that Harry couldn't hope to interpret it.
"She—" Neville paused and frowned. "Actually, I don't know? Didn't hear Mum or Dad say anything about her. Papers aren't saying she's dead though."
The rest of the journey to the Slytherin Common Room was conducted in silence. Perhaps it might have been awkward, but there was really nothing Harry was interested in saying to Iana, nor she, him. Dumbledore seemed to be quite happy keeping his thoughts to himself. In short order, they arrived at the corridor which Harry knew to contain the hidden entrance.
Instead, she settled for a muttered "Whatever."
Harry looked at it more closely, and he realised she was right. There was something about it that left him feeling on edge. Iana joined him in peering at it.
The sudden sound of his voice, loud in the otherwise fairly quiet hallway, caused Effie to jump. It took Harry a moment to locate the source.
It took two long minutes for them to clear a large enough area to satisfy Iana. Every few seconds, the entire castle trembled under Voldemort's furious assault.
"Do you mean your dad?" Harry asked, once the tears had slowed down once more.
"You don't even know what you're looking for," said Harry. He put the book down and leaned back in his seat. "You don't even know if you'd be able to recognise it if you
"Both alive," said Harry. For now, at least. "And they're not your fault either."
Now it was the day Harry had been dreading, and somehow she knew it too.
"Fucking wanker," he muttered.
killed Malfoy like the papers said. Said it stinks of a cover-up. Mum just about had kittens." He raised his voice into a harsh shriek that Harry knew bore almost no similarity to his mum's actual voice. "That poor Iana! First her mother, now her father too. That poor girl. You should make sure she's okay!" His voice returned to normal. "Yeah, nah, thanks Mum. I value my tackle more than that."
"Cowards!"
"But, Professor, it's late and—"
"Might also have something to do with cosmetic charms too," said Neville Longbottom, his voice dry. He hadn't arrived until a little later and was in the unenviable situation of being a bit less drunk than everyone else.
lovegood," Seamus cackled.
Just as Harry was about to suggest that they try and make their escape that way, the world turned upside down.
"Also, I was wondering if there's anywhere in Hogwarts which would be really good for hiding something?" he asked hopefully.
"You have until sunset to see reason. After that, I suspect the Ministry will have no choice but to bring its full might against those who try to use children, the future of our people, as living shields against righteous retribution."
A new voice joined the conversation. "What if I came out in support?" Iana asked from her position at the door. Harry wasn't sure how long she'd been listening in, but it had obviously been long enough to know what was going on.
"Eww." Ron's face crinkled up in disgust. "No. I'm just saying she looks a right fright first thing. I reckon it's some of that— what was it again? The muggle thing with the micclescopes?"
Iana folded her arms resolutely. "You deserved it."
"Well, it's bad, obviously," said Harry, not understanding what his father was getting at. "Malfoy was supposed to be doing a lot to fight against Voldemort, right? Like getting the Ministry ready and such?"
Harry groaned but didn't respond. Instead he concentrated on his breakfast.
A loud whistle sounded down the platform, distracting everyone from Harry's admittedly weak attempt to shrug it off.
That enemy was surely enough to chill the blood of even the bravest Gryffindor. Taller even than Dumbledore, and robed in midnight black. His snake-like face, with a flat, slitted nose was pale as bone, and his eyes were a terrible, cruel red. He, too, looked more than a little the worse for wear, but that did not diminish the impression of terrifying power he exuded.
The little Elf nodded, and a moment later disappeared with a crack of displaced air.
"Oh, so did they tell you what happened?" Effie asked, all bright-eyed interest.
to act like you're not a seeker short?" Iana asked while she glared at him from a distance of just a few inches.
it had happened wasn't really clear. As soon as Lucius had recovered from his treatment he had left Hogwarts, and so far as Harry was aware he had refused to answer any questions on the other prophecy, which apparently included Iana of all people.
Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. "Hang on, maybe the ghosts can help. Some of them are pretty old right?" He looked around, and found that the Ravenclaw house ghost had stopped and was floating on air.
"I have a secret of my own," he admitted to her. He had no idea if what he was about to do was the right thing, but she'd confided in him. It was the least he could do to return the favour. "The prophecy with my name on it that you saw destroyed? I already knew what was in it." He paused. "At least, I think I did." Suddenly he wasn't so sure. How many prophecies were there? That Hall had been filled with thousands of the things.
"Your dad didn't tell you anything?"
your father think, I wonder?"
Snape's voice cut across their conversation before Iana could respond.
As she lapsed into silence, Harry felt breathless. He couldn't find the words.
"She said it had to be this way," said Lily, and Harry could see that she'd been crying. "That there was no other way to save you."
particular thought.
When Iana placed the last piece of equipment away, there was an awkward pause, as they both stood around, unsure of what to do next. Eventually, it was Iana who caved.
my name. It is your name for me. It is the name of the lie my father perpetrated to further his own influence. Everyone knows Iana Malfoy. No one knows me. Even I don't know me!" She pushed an errant strand of blonde hair from her face. "I've never had the chance. I was always training, or studying, or learning how to play the role of Father's perfect little Witch."
"Indeed, were it not for that, it is possible that the prophecy could have applied to either you or Mr. Longbottom. His mother is Alice, which means noble, and his birth was scant hours before your own. But he was born on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month. Had the year of your birth not been a leap year, it would be he to whom I would be talking now, instead of you."
"So," she began with feigned brightness, "what are you all doing for Christmas?"
She deflated very slightly. "Oh." At last she seemed to actually recognise Harry's presence. "Your hair is a mess. You should probably brush it or something, you know?"
"I swear to Merlin, Seamus, if you keep perving on Malfoy, I can't be held responsible for what happens," said Neville. "Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"
The mirth died in Dumbledore's eyes, and he sighed. "I fear it is a case of chickens coming home to roost. In this case, however, the chickens are not mine."
With a long, shaky sigh, Iana closed her eyes and began to recite:
Harry opened his mouth to deny it, but he was beaten to the punch by Neville.
More had arrived than just Seamus. Just next to him was Dean Thomas, and still surrounded by a slowly settling cloud of soot was a bedraggled looking Ronald Weasley. Effie was loitering somewhat conspicuously in a corner.
"It is," Harry agreed readily. "They have to be connected somehow."
Iana, being less seriously injured than a lot of the others, was in a bed nearer the door. As Harry approached the first thing he noticed was that she looked absolutely terrible despite her more minor injuries. She wasn't covered in acid-filled sores, or missing a limb, but looked so incredibly pale that for a moment he thought she might have died. Half her face was still covered with blood from the knock on the head, darkening slowly as it scabbed.
"Right." She stayed quiet for a moment. "Are you going to apologise?"
He'd always known it, but he'd never really dwelled on it. It had been the distant beauty of muggle movie stars, something to appreciate, and yet never really real. But she was real, and she was getting nearer. Everything else seemed to fade into the background, until all he could focus on was her face. They drifted ever closer.
As the Headmaster contemplated his answer, Harry realised that he looked weary. More weary than Harry had ever seen. From the first time Harry had met him, and all through his Hogwarts years, Dumbledore had been like a force of nature. He'd lost a lot of his influence to Malfoy over the years, but he'd never seemed to allow that to get to him. Now, he looked old, and Harry wondered just how long he could keep the fight up.
'. July."
"Have you heard of something called 'Horcruxes'?" he asked her one afternoon after McGonagall had finally let them escape. The Library was quiet, and the chances of them being overheard were pretty close to zero unless they raised their voices.
"Stop bloody following me around like a lost puppy, Potter!" she hissed, far closer to his face than he'd really prefer. It wasn't a big alcove. "It's making me jumpy!"
She pushed him away, and tried to straighten her robes, but it was pretty much a lost cause.
It was followed by a horrified gasp from someone else in the crowd, and Harry pushed through a gap in the crowd to see what they were looking at.
"Then we have to get out there," said Harry much though he'd prefer to cower and hide in the Come and Go Room until it was all over. With Iana there the company wouldn't even be so bad.
Her knuckles were white as they gripped the edge of the bench on which she was sitting with the kind of furious strength Harry remembered when he'd tried to comfort her on Christmas day.
to fight then we're doing our job wrong."
"You are misguided," said Voldemort with a rueful shake of his head, "but I suppose it is only to be expected. You were lied to. Kept in the dark for far too long, so that Dumbledore could protect his precious saviour.
"What's she doing?" he managed to ask when he managed to pull back. "She can't fight him alone!"
While Harry had been staring at Tonks' body Dumbledore had been casting spells. It wasn't until she was covered with a conjured white sheet that Harry returned to the world.
"Maybe it's not two," said Harry, equally at his wits end. "It only says he dies at my hand."
." As Lucius lifted off his feet, just an inch or two into the air, Harry looked back at Iana. "Then we pull him with us."
The byplay didn't go unnoticed. Neville narrowed his eyes again. "You two do know something, don't you? I knew Mum and Dad were hiding something!"
"Yeah, that." He leaned back looking very pleased with himself.
"Come on, Harry," Dean wheedled for what felt like the dozenth time that weekend. "What happened on Halloween? You have to tell us eventually."
Effie followed up quickly with a question of her own. "Why's it called that?"
When he lapsed into silence, it seemed like the entire world stilled. There was not a breath to be heard. No wind stirred the trees of the Forbidden Forest.
"You have any of that chocolate and raspberry tart left?" he asked quickly. "It was brilliant."
Clumps of her hair were frazzled and still smoking lightly. Soot and grime caked it thickly enough that it defied gravity, and he could barely tell that it was meant to be blonde. The cosmetic charms she used had clearly been badly mangled by either the explosion or the Fiendfyre, and she had something of the look of a distressed panda about her.
Harry and his other friends had of course always poked fun at him for it. Couldn't let an opportunity like that pass them by.
"What I said about your parents," said Harry patiently. Who knew it was so easy to get her to shut up? "It was out of line. A lot of what I said probably wasn't warranted, to be honest. So, I'm sorry about that. Can I do my research now?"
"I should go," Iana said, though her reluctance was clear to see. She looked around at the others in the room they'd managed to gather in, away from the mad bustle of celebration. All of Harry's family was there, including Sirius and Remus. Even Effie, who had disappeared for a while after the fight, had reappeared, looking suspiciously tousled. "You should catch up with your family."
"Old Dumbledore wants to talk to you," said Neville, leaning precariously over one of the stone bannisters. "Was just going to drop my stuff and find you in the library. Have you been hiding away from us again?"
"Do not worry, the Ministry event does not commence until later, so you will be able to attend the feast. In fact, it would be best, I think, if we are seen to enjoy the festivities," he said, allaying Harry's concerns.
The Death Eater's wand did not stray from Lucius, but another of the Death Eaters silenced him. The way his screams were so suddenly cut off, even while his body continued to convulse, was if possible even worse than the screams themselves had been.
"That's not fair—" Harry began only to be cut off.
"But me no buts! This kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Out!" Pince's wand materialised from somewhere within her voluminous clothing and with a wave their things were packed randomly into their bags before they were deposited on Harry's and Iana's laps.
He hadn't been able to get anything from his parents either, with them both quickly changing the subject, or giving him some minor chore to do in lieu of giving him answers. Sirius had looked pained about the whole thing the few times he'd visited, but even he hadn't said anything.
Suddenly his hand contained a familiar wand of pale wood. Dumbledore's wand. He pointed it at Harry. "It was your folly to stand before me," he said. Deceptively calm though the words seemed, the rage behind his eyes was an inferno waiting to be unleashed. "Draw your wand, boy. Let us see who the true master of fate is."
"And Voldemort's just going to sit around and let that happen?"
"You should probably run," she said over her shoulder.
With a final departing glance, and a brief squeeze of her hand, which he'd been holding the whole time, Harry quickly departed. He didn't go far, only the short distance necessary to check up on Effie, but he could feel Iana's gaze on him every step of the way.
There was a brief moment of silence, before James ran up to Harry.
Before those thoughts could run away with what remained of his determination, the lift doors opened, and he was greeted with a long corridor, swathed in darkness. At the far end he could see a slither of light escaping through an unclosed door.
"Stay there!" Harry called over his shoulder when he realised Effie was following. "It's not safe!"
Harry shrugged. "Maybe Snape? He was in the office once when I spoke to Dumbledore."
They were as good as their word, for a few weeks at least. Neville spent nearly as much time in the library poring over old accounts of the Founders as Harry did, and while the others didn't really have the attention span needed to spend hours focused on the task, they still made time to help, and would talk over Harry and Neville's findings each evening before bed.
"I'm sorry," she whispered hoarsely. "It's my fault. It's all my fault."
"You've got issues, mate," said Neville. "You ever think of anything other than girls?"
"Dunno," said Harry, "but she looks pissed."
While he might only be seventeen, Harry could tell when his parents were trying to put on a brave face. The way his mother and father kept meeting each-other's eyes, Sirius' loud confidence. They didn't know what was coming either.
"Hmm." The look on James' face made it clear he didn't believe a word of it. "Anyway while you know that Malfoy died, I'm not sure you really understand what it means."
"Well?" Iana asked after a few seconds. Harry glanced up.
The Hogwarts Express held a comforting familiarity. Unlike the platform at King's Cross, there were no worried adults, with distant looks of concern on their faces. It had been easy to see who was part of Dumbledore's group. They'd been the ones who had looked like the weight of the world was on their shoulders.
"Why?"
The other three jumped immediately to the most obvious conclusion.
"Hey guys," said Harry, taking the opportunity to put a stop to that particular topic of conversation. Did Dean really not think about anything else? "How's it going?"
"Huh," said Neville. "Weird."
Even before the word had finished passing his lips, a deep purple spell, trailing thick smoke shot from Voldemort's wand straight at Harry. By some miracle, Harry was able to duck beneath it and it sailed overhead. Even the most fleeting breath of the smoke which leaked off it caused him to retch, and a scream sounded from the assembled witches and wizards behind him, only to be abruptly silenced.
"You are an utter arsehole, Potter!"
"Because it is," Snooks explained. "Sometimes it is being there, and sometimes it isn't!"
"Don't know."
"Uh, yeah," said Ron with only a fractional delay. "I was wondering if they had any more of that tart thing." He smiled wistfully. "It was pretty good."
"Well, whatever." Better to try to move past that particular uncomfortable thought. It wasn't like he could judge her. Of the two of them, so far as he was aware, only he had actually killed someone. "You want to give it a go?"
"I just do," she snapped back. "We're out of time. It has to be Fiendfyre."
"Potter!" Snape called suddenly, when Harry was mere feet from freedom. "The Headmaster wished to see you once your detention was served. Do not keep him waiting."
"Your father?" Harry asked. Did she really have that much faith in him? "The man that hid behind you when Voldemort turned up?"
He knew he couldn't stay still, though, and scrambled through the wreckage to hide behind another of the shelves. He was able to catch sight of Iana and her father, both hiding behind another of the shelves. Somehow, Iana had gotten hold of a wand, and was exchanging spells with one of the other Death Eaters.
Iana replied with a one-shouldered shrug. "I thought you wanted her out of harm's way."
"First, I feel I should apologise for the manner in which I told you of the Prophecy."
Lily wasted no time in sending a blindingly powerful curse across the room at Pettigrew who screamed and threw himself to the ground unnecessarily. Voldemort reacted with the speed of a striking viper, and a large section of floor lifted into the curse's path before it could reach its target. The lump of stone and timber was utterly destroyed, but Peter survived unharmed.
Ron looked thoughtful for a moment. "Honestly? She'd probably want to get in on whatever it is we're going to be doing, but I get your point."
"I don't know," Harry admitted. "If Dumbledore found anything out before he died, he didn't tell me."
Harry nodded wordlessly. How had his
"Need to leave, just like Mr. Potter," said Pince, clearly in no mood to take any of Malfoy's posturing. "Now. Do not
done?" Lily asked, quickly quelling Sirius' chuckles, and rapidly chasing away Remus' grin. "Good." She turned back to Harry and Iana. "Now, can you explain what on earth happened?"
"You'd be the one to know," she said, grinning snidely.
Harry nodded. He tried to let go of Iana's hand, but found that she only clutched at him all the harder.
Most of them had taken Dumbledore's death hard. If rumours were to be believed, McGonagall had spent most of her evenings for the past few days plinking away at her impressive whisky collection, while Sprout had barely even been out of her greenhouses. Flitwick, along with a few of the other teachers, had only been seen at meals.
, and Harry might have to fight him? The whole world seemed to be collapsing in on him. Everything he'd ever known, his entire life, was gone. Destroyed before he'd even been born.
Harry peered at it, remembering what he'd seen in Dumbledore's office. "Is that a memory?"
With an expression that was somewhere between worry and surprise, Iana took one step closer. "I'll be okay."
"Nothing good," said Harry, scowling at the absolute mess it had made of his otherwise happy life. "You don't really think I'm gonna tell you, do you?"
Never before had Harry felt such an intense and burning desire to lamp someone. He went to pull out his wand, though quite which curse he was going to use he wasn't sure. It was entirely possible he was just going to try and stab her with it. Iana was already reaching for her own wand, but they were both stopped in their tracks.
"Oh, be quiet you old windbag," said Sirius, cutting him off before he could launch into some ridiculous and almost entirely fictional story. "That's besides the point. You're meant to be an adult now, Harry. Means you have to come up with your own jokes.
"Well, good night, Miss Malfoy," he said warmly. "I do hope my fears do not come to fruition, but I caution you to remember that even Slytherin himself had to work alongside those with whom he did not always agree in order to build his greatest legacy."
"Just about," said Effie. Mercifully, she also seemed to understand the gravity of the situation, even if neither of them really knew what it was. "I made it nice and warm. I thought that's what I'd probably prefer."
He looked nothing like he once had. Part of his face looked almost like it had melted, while the rest of it was covered in patches of burned skin. Despite that, he didn't let go.
She glanced away for a moment. "No idea," she said. "But that was the very first thing he took away from me. I can't get mother back. I can't get my childhood back. I can't get my Merlin-be-damned friends" — she spat that word too — "back. But I can get the name my mother gave me back."
"And how are you going to do that?" Harry asked her. "Look at it. It's still spreading. What if you can catch it?"
Neither of them did, and his shouting only attracted more attention. Soon, they were joined by his mum and dad, and all the Professors. Lily wrapped him in a hug, and his struggles weakened.
She whispered something that Harry couldn't catch as another explosion rattled the heavily laden shelves of the room.
"Is that going to matter when Dementors break in and kiss everyone the Death Eaters don't like?" she shot back. "You're not running. Mum's not running. Harry's not running. I'm not running. Get used to it."
"Okay then," said Harry mildly. He had to be careful. With her mood as it was it wouldn't take much for her to blow up in his face. "So… why did they do it? What does changing your name even achieve?"
One which Harry had come to recognise, called Snooks, a particularly short Elf with ears nearly as large as his head, dashed up to them.
Effie didn't look convinced. "That was a pretty nasty thing to say, though. How would you like it if you'd lost both your parents and someone threw it back in your face like that?"
"The Bloody Baron?" Iana blurted out, breaking Helena's flow as she turned to regard them both.
She paused again, no doubt trying to work out where to start.
"I grow tired of this charade," said one of the Death Eaters as he stalked back and forth. His voice seemed familiar, but Harry couldn't quite place it. "You know your defiance is futile. The Dark Lord will not be denied."
The spell cut off all sound from outside his bedroom, and Harry threw himself into his bed. In the silence that followed, the true enormity of it really hit him.
While true, her statement did very little to give Harry hope that they might survive whatever was to come.
They all looked out the window and indeed, they could see Molly Weasley doling out some last-minute hugs to Ron's younger sister Ginny.
But really, how much worse could it get?
It might have been half an hour before one of them spoke, the minutes just seemed to evaporate, and there was really not all that much that needed said. Not urgently anyway. Harry was quite content to simply be.
Harry realised that had come out far louder than he intended. His head whipped around to make sure Pince wasn't anywhere nearby, about to descend upon them. "He what?"
Seeing Harry's nearly empty trunk, she started bustling around the room, throwing clothes and other things into his trunk haphazardly. "Can you tell me what it's about?" she asked without looking at him. "You and Mum and Dad have all been acting really weird since Professor Dumbledore came around. What's going on?"
Iana's hopeful expression was only reinforced by the approving nods that came from James and Lily.
"Enough of this, Tom," said Dumbledore as he moved to place himself between Voldemort and Iana. "Whatever plan you had for this evening failed. You know there is no chance of that Prophecy surviving."
After nearly a minute of watching them study in silence, she stalked away again. It wasn't long after that that Iana spoke again, the anger gone from her voice. "Father didn't tell me anything," she said quietly.
Naked suspicion rose up in her eyes. "I don't remember that."
"What do you want?"
Harry sat down opposite her, legs crossed. He was soon joined by Effie.
Downstairs, James, Lily and Sirius ran to the front door from the kitchen. James immediately transfigured the door into something more durable, while Sirius peered out at whatever was in the garden.
When her voice broke, Harry pulled her tight into his arms, and they stayed like that, wrapped up together until she found her voice once more.
"Uh, aren't we waiting?" Harry asked.
"Dumbledore will work something out," said James with a confidence that Harry really didn't share. "You know that he was always the only person Voldemort ever feared."
There was a lengthy awkward silence, only broken when Harry asked, "How about you? Good Christmas?"
" he whispered desperately, hoping that the door hadn't been locked with anything too powerful to be overcome with the unlocking charm. The click of the door's lock was like music to his ears.
Then, at the back of the crowd, Harry caught sight of Snape, looking on over the proceedings with an expression of sour satisfaction.
"There's more of them," said Iana, glancing back at them. As she did so, her eyes came to rest on her father who was clearly still suffering from the after effects of the Cruciatus Curse. "Father also won't be able to run far or fast."
"Potter," he said with that familiar curl of the lip which always followed the name of Potter. "On time for once, I see."
Leaving his book open and forgotten on the table, Harry wasted no time in following her. They passed Madam Pince who, from the pinched look on her face, was indeed about to give them both a stern talking to, but she was stymied when Iana and Harry bypassed her and stepped out of the Library. Iana then led him into one of the less-used corridors, and slipped into a disused classroom without a backwards glance.
The Headmaster nodded. "Your perplexity is understandable, but consider that Iana Malfoy's birthday was on the 5th of June."
"From what I've seen, it requires you to murder someone to make one," said Harry, sincerely hoping that was be enough reason for her to discount the idea. "Something about splitting off part of the soul to store in an item."
"He became angry, then infuriated when he could not convince me with his weasel words and false promises. He always imagined himself such an intelligent man, yet he had not the wit to see the strings that governed his actions. He liked to think of himself as the true heir to Slytherin's legacy, and just as Salazar had once sought to court my mother, so too did he hope to court me.
The upshot was that only Dean was heading home, as he always did at Easter. Being born near the beginning of April, his birthday usually fell during the holidays, and his mother was an absolute stickler for him being home for his birthday.
Neville, Ron and Dean all broke out in laughter, with Dean actually toppling over backwards. Harry was less amused.
"So, what's the plan?" James asked as he pushed himself upright. His eyes settled on Harry. "Hey, you look almost as bad as me. You okay?"
"We didn't. But that doesn't mean we didn't do everything we could to save Harry from his fate."
Harry couldn't argue with that. He didn't want to argue with that. So he did exactly as she asked.
"Doubt it," he grumbled, as he folded his book closed, his thumb keeping the page. "Mum and Dad have been snowed under at work. Probably means another Christmas with Great Uncle Algie."
That cheery thought was not enough to lift the leaden weight of every step he took towards the Headmaster's office. Eventually, those steps led him to the Gargoyle guardian that marked the location of the Headmaster's office.
me, Miss Malfoy. So help me."
"We can go up now if you like?" he suggested.
"Who?" Effie asked immediately.
"You think yourself more an expert than the Minister?" she asked quietly. "Perhaps you gained your potions mastery over the summer? No? Then I would recommend you be silent on topics of which you know nothing."
"The fact remains that this
What if it was Voldemort?
The single word that Iana said in response chilled him. "Dean."
"Perhaps." Voldemort tapped his wand to his thin, almost non-existent lips. "But you have tried to defy me once already this evening. Remind me, will you, how that served you?"
"Miss Malfoy is uninjured," said Dumbledore, raising his voice after concluding a hissed conversation with James which Harry had not been able to hear. "There are more important matters to discuss. I have summoned the Order to meet, so perhaps it would be best if—"
"We didn't
"But he is also already involved. If your father and I had had our way, he would never have needed to know either," her tone brooked no further argument. "But in Harry's case
He rubbed her back in what was hopefully a comforting way. "It's okay," he said in the same soothing tone of voice he had occasionally used when Effie was younger. "You're safe now. You're safe here."
The answer came immediately. "No!"
"You're as bad as Dean and Seamus," said Harry, unable to conceal the ghost of a smile that drifted across his face. "I was completely bloody clueless, you know that."
"And Malfoy can afford a
Ignoring his sister's unnecessary huffing and puffing as she stood up and darted in the direction of the stairs, Harry turned back to Iana. "How did he manage that? Isn't the Manor one of the best protected places in Britain?"
"Not sure," she said with a shrug. "Father gave it to me while he was dying and thought I was my mother. I was going to throw it away, honestly."
They'd just have to hope that that was enough.
"Can you do that?" Harry asked, receiving a look which surely would have been withering if Snooks wasn't a House Elf.
"He must have sabotaged it in some way," said Lily. Then she shook her head, a chagrined look on her face. "No. Anything like that and Voldemort would have been able to work it out. Then how?"
"I very much doubt that," Iana grumbled with obvious reluctance. She didn't protest when he sat down, though.
Harry and Iana shared a grimace. "It will probably have to be destroyed," Harry admitted.
Harry was completely happy to have their pointless search called off for the day, but Iana wasn't going to go down without a fight.
Also, no, it's not an April Fools. There really is 60k words of this.
"Come in, Harry. No need to be shy."
Harry set his book down with a thump that seemed to linger far too long in the otherwise quiet library.
Sirius had been left with horrific burns over much of his body, the result of the acid-filled pustules he'd been cursed with. They were also highly resistant to healing charms, and as a result Sirius had spent much of the last few days in a morose silence.
"We've been doing what we can. Minister Fudge wasn't much more than a useful idiot for Malfoy, but at least he was no Death Eater. We're trying to get Madame Bones installed as interim Minister, but it's not easy. Seems like every one of Malfoy's cronies is firmly back in Voldemort's camp, and they're everywhere."
That brought Harry up short. The other boys also stopped laughing pretty quickly.
"She might be like that for a while," said James with a fond grin. "Come on, you lot. We'll leave her to it. I'm sure she'll let us know the answer at some point."
A firm punch from Dean shut him up. "Don't you say a thing!"
. He'd already told her that none of what had happened was her fault and there was no way his mum was the kind to hold a grudge.
The look of irritation on Snape's face was one with which Harry was pretty familiar, but had never seen directed at Malfoy. "I believe I made myself clear?"
It was Iana Malfoy. Of course it was. She'd never been one to pass up an opportunity to get in everyone's faces on the ride to Hogwarts. There wasn't a single trip which Harry could remember that didn't involve a little visit from the wizarding world's most unlikable celebrity.
been a happy bunny for the last month of summer. He'd stayed locked in his room nearly the entire time, venturing out only for meals and when his parents actually dragged him out.
"Fortunately," Dumbledore interjected, "that will hopefully be unnecessary. Prophecies are strange things, and governed not so much by magic, as by our own actions and choices. Had my brother found the young Death Eater just a little earlier, it is quite possible that none of the events of it would ever have come to pass. It was only by Voldemort's
In the end, this was a fun experience for me. I hope it was a fun read for you too, even if the joke at the end didn't really land. Future stories will return to your regularly scheduled crossovers. My next project is an original work, which will be followed by the sequel to Toppling Heroes. Beyond that, I have plans for some Warhammer crossovers in the works which are currently slated for next year. Oh, and I'll keep plugging away at Shadow of Angmar. Follow my author's page if any of that sounds like your cup of tea.
It wasn't until they were leaving much later, that they returned to the conversation.
"As only one of you have gloves," Snape continued, as if Iana's outburst hadn't even happened, "I would recommend that Mr. Potter continue with the cleaning, while you, Miss Malfoy, occupy yourself with drying and returning the items to their proper places."
"She's doing this for you," said Effie, weakly enough that Harry could tell she knew that it would be scant comfort. "She's doing this for all of us."
"Just because it's bad doesn't mean we shouldn't study it," said Iana. "The only way to fight dark magic is to know it."
"Harry! Are you okay? Merciful Merlin, what are you doing in the middle of all this?" he asked. His words came so fast that Harry almost couldn't comprehend them.
"Look, Harry, I know it's hard," said James with a sigh, "but the most important thing is that you don't draw attention to yourself. This isn't the kind of fight any of us can win by magic alone."
"I'm sorry, sir," said Harry, still struggling to understand where the story was going, "but I still don't see what this has to do with me. Or even with Malfoy. I was born on the thirty-first of July."
"We wondered if there was some way that… love might be able to hurt the Dark Lord?" Iana added, sounding slowly less and less certain the further she got. "That sounds stupid, doesn't it?"
"Shaggability? Really?" said Neville as he shook his head.
One might be forgiven for thinking that Iana had actually been head girl at Hogwarts ever since first year. She'd certainly wielded her status as if that was the case. When she'd been made a prefect it had only made things worse. Neville had only been able to do so much to protect his friends from her.
Seamus groaned. "Can I just say? Merlin I'm glad we got to drop Sorcery and Society after O. . If I had to listen to him complain about how terrible it is that me mam and da' were allowed to stay together for another year, I don't know what I'd do."
"Don't even try to get out of that one. You—" He paused, and glanced at Seamus who was still engaged in a battle, trying to get his trunk onto the rack. "You've got a wand, you know?" He turned back to Harry, ignoring Seamus' somewhat embarrassed "Fuck off". "You have a family, you know? They talk? Wouldn't be surprised if you'd forgotten about that little fact, though."
Harry's head dropped into his hands. "Kill me now," he mumbled much to the amusement of everyone else.
Both of them were unconscious, and wrapped tightly in thick chains. Their wands were nowhere to be seen. The room itself was a strange one. It was circular, with a wide empty space in the middle. The moment Harry stepped in, the walls blurred into motion, spinning fast enough that they left Harry with the same dizzy feeling he might get after an over-ambitious Wronksi Feint.
"Calm down, Harry," said Dumbledore soothingly. "There are protections on the Prophecies which ensure that only the subjects may remove them, or hear them. Only if Voldemort himself walked into the Ministry could your secret be uncovered."
He marked his place with his finger and met her eye. "Look," he began. "I'm sorry for what I said yesterday. I was out of line. Now, can I please get back to this?"
"Yeah, yeah."
They didn't break apart far, though. Bare millimetres lay between them as Harry stared deep into Iana's eyes, grey as a storm-tossed sea. A moment later, they came together again, unable to resist any longer. Cold though the stone might be, Harry rolled onto his back and pulled Iana on top so that she at least would not have to experience it. Even the brief contact with the cold flags had left goose bumps all across her arms and shoulders. His hands trailed over them, chasing away the momentary chill, and returning her skin to a smooth, silky softness that he never wanted to stop feeling.
Iana barely looked up as she read over her own book, a hefty tome which sported the title 'Startling Stars & Celebrated Celestials' in flaking gold lettering. "It is important," she said distantly as she continued to stare at the names.
Iana gasped, and it took a moment for Harry to realise why. Suddenly he remembered what Dumbledore had told him. Voldemort's name when he'd been at school had been Tom Riddle. It seemed their suspicions might very well be true.
"My mother's Diadem caused more than enough strife during my own lifetime," said the ghost almost airily, as if she wasn't discussing the destruction of what would surely be one of Magical Britain's most treasured artefacts. "It would be well for all if it was destroyed, I think."
"Thank you, Professor."
"Thank you, dear," said Lily, though Harry was pretty sure Iana ignored her completely as she swept back out of the room.
Around them, their housemates were engaged in the typical Halloween revelry. The Hogwarts House Elves had, as usual, outdone themselves with the selection. The long house tables groaned under the weight of so many dishes, and the students were doing everything they could to reduce that burden.
"You're a self-absorbed cunt, Malfoy!"
"You realise that this is pretty much it?" Harry asked, his exasperation no doubt leaking into his words. "In a few months we'll be out there in the world with all those released Death Eaters. No Hogwarts to protect us, no Dumbledore to keep us safe. How are snowball fights going to prepare you for that?"
"Don't mind that idiot," said James, leaning forward on the cane that he'd transfigured to help him get around. "The real question here is will you be doing it again?"
"No, I suppose the beast did not injure anyone," Stump admitted as she tapped a long gnarled finger on her chin. "A mercy we must be grateful for. Though, had it kept to the law we would not have to thank pure happenstance for that mercy."
Dumbledore turned back to Harry and Iana, and he was once more his usual genial self. "Now, shall we make sure Miss Malfoy gets safely back to her dorms?"
"You want me to put your trunk away?" Harry asked her, prompting her to start as if she'd been lost completely in her thoughts.
For some reason, that made Harry feel even worse. Iana Malfoy was doing more to help than he was!
It took a long moment before understanding dawned. "The fifth day of the sixth month… so she's the one in the prophecy?"
"Stop it!" cried Iana, and Harry could see her straining against the spells that held her, too, in place.
"Maybe it means someone you love?" he suggested, trying desperately not to look uncomfortable as he said it. He wasn't going to say a word more than that. He'd go hiking on Drear before he'd voice
"Your greatest strength, Harry, is your friends," said Dumbledore, once more ignoring Snape. "Do not underestimate them."
For a moment Harry thought she was going to pursue it further, but then she simply sighed and returned to her own book. Harry glanced at the cover and saw that it was some kind of genealogy book. What did that have to do with fighting Voldemort?
Surprisingly, his answer was
Even so far away, Harry was sure they locked eyes then. It was ridiculous, really. If he was being honest with himself, the chances that she could see him, a single face in one of the uncountable windows in Hogwarts' walls, were almost nothing. And yet…
In that moment, Snape's eyes lingered on something behind Harry, but when Harry turned to look it was only his mother and father. When Harry turned back, Snape was looking directly at him.
For a moment, Iana stiffened, but then she went very nearly limp, and wrapped her own free arm around Harry too. Then, very quietly, she started to weep. Had Harry not been close enough to smell the faint scent of brimstone in her hair, he might not have heard the way her breath caught every few seconds, but with her held tight in his arms, there was no mistaking it.
"Eight," said Ron firmly.
"I see the House Elves have been hard at work," he said in no small amount of wonder. It would have taken a witch or wizard hundreds of hours to make any kind of sense of the room, and the Elves had apparently managed to do it in the middle of a magical siege.
"I told you it is over," he said. He spoke softly, but there was no denying the cruel glee that suffused his words. "Your saviour did not even try to fight. Give in, and some of you at least may live."
"It's a Withering Curse," said Iana with grim certainty. "There's nothing we can do."
(See the end of the chapter for
"And me," said Effie with grim determination.
Effie scowled. "Fine!" she snapped before stalking away, taking extra care to kick Harry's shoe on her way out. "I'll ask Neville."
"Merlin, don't you have any other comebacks?"
"Let's be honest here," said Seamus as he shook his head. "We all know who the real stunner of the year is."
Harry might have nibbled his way through a few mouthfuls of food by the time the feast had ended. Everyone hung around for a while, chatting and laughing amongst themselves, while Harry hovered on the periphery, not really taking part in any of the conversations. Finally, and at long last, it was time. Harry watched as Dumbledore left the feast, and after waiting a little while he decided to follow along.
"You want me to try and find it?" Harry asked, unable to hide his incredulity. "Me?"
have to fight him. You don't have to do anything. If you do not act on the prophecy, and Voldemort doesn't know about it, then it will
With a wave of his wand he conjured a wooden peg-leg, and jumped onto the floor with a clunk.
He'd been Harry Potter. The best seeker Hogwarts had seen in decades. He'd had dozens of friends, and girls had just about been lining up to date him. Now what was he?
Seamus was the first to answer. "We're going to my Uncle's this year," he said with a scowl. "He's a bloody puritan, he is. And a muggle to boot but me mam said I needed to visit so here I am."
"Just for one second, can you
"Well, yes and no," said Harry as he flipped another book, this one a slim tome bound in leather so old and cracked that it looked about ready to fall apart. "Everyone and their Granny seems to have
"Where is it?" It sounded like the perfect hiding place. "Usually, that is," he amended.
"Speak to you later, then," said Neville with a good natured wave. He glanced over at Effie. "Alright, Ef? Keeping him out of trouble?"
With the only moment of excitement being a near miss with Peeves who was busily attempting to install a tripwire in the corridor that contained the statue hiding the Hufflepuff common room, they soon arrived at the entrance to the kitchens. Not wanting to waste any time, Harry quickly tickled the pear, and they all shuffled in.
"The Dark Lord broke into our Manor," she said simply, as if Harry wouldn't have been able to work that out. She'd even told him so on the night.
Seamus had the good grace to look ashamed, but only for a moment. "Wait, wait, wait. I know!" he nearly shouted. "I bet he wants to love her good!" He toppled over laughing while everyone else shared a glance.
"I guess you've had more important things on your mind," said Ron with a worried grin. "It does seem like it could be important, though."
A witch Harry didn't recognise tried to bustle him off in the direction of an unoccupied bed, but he pushed them off and staggered over to his mother. It was like trying to walk on jelly, but he managed to reach her before they gave way beneath him. Effie was okay, though she was covered in blood and looked completely shell-shocked as she was led away by another of the orderlies.
At first he'd been regarded with some suspicion by the usual denizens of the library's dusty stacks. Harry was sure Pince had spent most of the first week hiding just around the nearest corner, ready and waiting for whatever it was she imagined he was about to get up to.
"Tom," said Dumbledore lightly enough that he might have been greeting an old friend in the street.
"Hey, hey!" said Harry, drawing her attention back and holding her hand tight to thwart her weak attempts at pulling it free. "It wasn't your fault. None of this is."
She turned to him and nodded. "Call me Diana," she said with a broad toothy smile.
"He is not," said Dumbledore with uncharacteristic bluntness. "Not truly. It is my belief that he has managed to persist somehow. A wraith, weaker than any ghost, yet alive, still."
"I guess." She trudged away up the stairs. The single glance back when she reached the top betrayed just how interested she really was.
Before she could get any further, James pulled the door open again, and Harry could hear the staccato pop of apparations, and Sirius was the first through the door.
"How's that meant to work, though?" asked Seamus, looking every bit as confused as he sounded. "Isn't it just saying you have to kill him?"
"Or you may fight," said Voldemort almost like it was an afterthought. "But if you do that, then I fear the children may be in far too much danger. It is useless to try to resist me. Lucius Malfoy tried it. Dumbledore tried it. Amelia Bones tried it. The Girl-Who-Lived" — he spat the moniker — "tried it. All of them are dead now. The Malfoy girl even came to me wielding the wand of Albus Dumbledore." He twisted it in his fingers, seeming to revel in holding the most treasured possession of his most hated enemy. "It did her no good. Lord Voldemort cannot be bested."
Four figures in the same robes and masks as the two in the spinning room stood around two more figures. The one Harry recognised first was Iana Malfoy, though she looked much different from normal. Her usually perfect hair was in disarray, her ordinarily immaculate robes were torn. Even though he was still some distance away, Harry could see that she was bleeding from her nose and a couple of cuts on her face. The sleeve of her robes had been torn off completely, and a deep gash on her arm dripped blood onto the floor.
Still not really comprehending, Harry nodded.
"Why do you want to know? Going to run straight to Dumbledore with it, are you?" Iana asked. As she was speaking, something changed in her expression. The tiredness was replaced by anger.
"We need to get out," said Iana as she spun in place. Looking for what, Harry couldn't say. Was she planning on jumping out the window?
Iana sighed. "It is a thin band of metal, circular in shape, with a gem set into it," she explained.
"I lied about what happened when Voldemort… killed me," said Iana eventually. Her words were hesitant, as if she was having to dredge them up individually from some deep, dark place.
The way she avoided his eyes as she said it told Harry that there might be a little more to it than that, but he kept his silence for the time being.
question had been thoughtless, what the hell was what?
Whatever it was that Dumbledore wanted to discuss, it was clear he didn't want to do it out in the open, even if the night time corridors of Hogwarts were almost completely empty. He led Harry up a few staircases, and down a couple of corridors until they were standing before the Gargoyle that guarded the entrance to his office.
"I'm clear though," said Neville with a lazy shrug. "Guess I can join you."
Many of the dozen or so Order members who'd responded to help the Potters had been injured too, and nearly every bed in the Infirmary was filled. Madam Pomfrey and some other medi-witches and -wizards bustled between the filled beds, but there was a strange energy to everything they did, as if they were trying to void thinking about what had actually happened.
"No," he said, and perhaps there was just a little more life in that single word than in all the empty platitudes he'd voiced at meals over the last month.
"He's got a point," said Ron with a shrug.
The figure he recognised instantly. The shining blonde hair and the confident strut was all too familiar. As Iana crossed the final few steps, her stride faltered for a moment, and she glanced back.
That his voice didn't falter as he said those words was a minor miracle. He wanted nothing more than to cut and run but he knew his family wouldn't do the same. Even if they did, they'd probably never be truly safe.
He and Effie made their way quietly through the bustling children to find an empty compartment. A few people greeted them both, and they both smiled, and waved, and moved right on by in their search for a cabin before they all started to fill up.
Harry nodded, giving the idea some thought. "So he clearly wasn't just putting them in random places."
"How did that work out for you?" asked Neville. "What was it, two weeks of being locked inside?"
It was obvious that Iana was battling to keep her composure. While Harry would be quite happy to see her pick up another detention, he had zero desire to be caught in the crossfire.
He pushed himself upright, and quickly pulled his clothes and robes on. A quick flick of his wand erased any evidence of their presence. Benches and tables creaked back into place, and books and scrolls flew up from the floor where they'd been cast in the throes of their clumsy lovemaking, back onto the desks. He glanced up at the clock and realised with a start that it was getting late. It was nearly sunset.
"Can you go and get Iana some water?" Harry asked Effie.
It was clear that he'd have to give her some kind of answer to her own questions if he wanted her to answer his. After a few seconds of consideration, he glanced around to make sure no one was watching, and leaned forward.
Despite a few somewhat abortive attempts to join in with Harry's study sessions, Dean hadn't exchanged a single word with Iana since hostilities had been temporarily suspended. Iana was quiet, and spent most of the journey scowling at the passing scenery, doing an admirable job of ignoring the effusive Juliet. Effie was, nominally at least, listening to her friend, but in reality she split her time between nodding absentmindedly, and giving Harry meaningful looks.
reason to want you dead."
A couple of weeks later, as the cold weather and heavy rainstorms that often battered Hogwarts in the winter abated at last in time for spring to arrive, it had very nearly become normal.
"Come on, Harry," said Seamus cheerfully. "Buck up! You've been a right grump for months now. You sure your name isn't Ebenezer?"
Whatever that was, though, Harry never found out as before he could ask, Neville called out to them from one of the higher flights of the moving staircases they were walking beneath. "Oi, Potters!"
"The Slytherins won't like it," Effie pointed out. "Most of them have been itching to start a fight since Halloween."
"So you left it in Albania?" Harry asked, trying to pull her back on track. Iana gave him a slightly apologetic look.
Like an overgrown bat, he swept down the dark dungeon corridor to where Harry was waiting outside the potions classroom.
It was also obvious that Harry wasn't about to be included in the meeting, though he still had a little hope that he might be able to wheedle something from his parents once it was all over.
"Sorry, guys," he said, mid-bustle. "Mum's mental."
If he was being honest with himself, Harry really didn't understand why she was so fixated on the name, but then if it really had been given to her by her dead mother, maybe it wasn't so strange.
"I'm not stupid, you know," said Iana, glaring daggers. "As soon as you have what you want, I'm just your embarrassing little secret."
Harry frowned "I already knew that."
"What do you mean?" Harry asked, staring at the aging Headmaster. "Are you dying?"
He heard Iana bark out some spell, followed by a shout of surprise from their pursuers, and for a moment the spells flying around him paused. He ripped the door open and jumped through it. The moment Iana followed, he slammed it shut.
" he shouted before turning once more to run for the far end of the corridor. Maybe if they could reach the room with the doors they could lose their pursuers? He put on a turn of speed to catch up to Iana again.
"Well?" she asked.
"Anyway, the really important thing is that we try to find the leftover Horcruxes," said Harry, hoping to pull them back on track.
His wand held up and ready, though for what reason he wasn't really sure, Harry watched as Iana's face first became placid, like a high mountain lake, only for rage and anger to surface, burning like a fire in her usually grey eyes. "
"You don't need to do that," said Lily softly. "This isn't your problem to solve any more than it is Harry's."
He looked up to find Iana staring at him pointedly.
"Perhaps it would be best if I started from the beginning," said Dumbledore, tapping his chin. "Very well. The story begins, I think, in the Hog's Head, on a cold night seventeen years ago. I was interviewing a young witch for the post of Divination Teacher, a post I confess I had previously been resolved to leaving unfilled."
"So instead I find out
"Hmm. Then I guess it has to be Dumbledore, then?"
His voice departed suddenly, leaving a vacuum of sound in its wake. Harry turned to look at his mother, but it was James, apparently awoken by Voldemort's speech, who spoke first.
"Stay safe, you two," he said to his dad and sister. He then trotted quickly over to Iana. As he got nearer she made a little gesture with her head, and slipped around the corner.
The distant sound of shouting rose up out of the darkness behind him, and he realised they had very little time indeed.
"Just interested," Harry replied. Maybe Dumbledore had a reason for not involving her? "No other reason."
For some reason that marked the limit of Harry's ability to sustain his carefully cultivated misery. It started as a chuckle, but soon it grew to a full-voiced belly laugh that had him doubling over for breath.
Harry eyed Seamus. "Aren't you only a couple of weeks older than me?"
make them friends, and it certainly did not entitle her to requests like that. Not only was it unreasonable, but it was unsafe too. Voldemort was meant to be actively hunting her, and it was only the fact that she was safe behind Hogwarts' walls that had kept her safe. Leaving Hogwarts was a monumentally stupid idea.
"No."
"Uninjured?" Lily asked archly. Harry could well recognise the tone of voice his mother used for that question. He winced, knowing what was likely to follow. The pitch of her voice raised just slightly. "She is covered in mud and blood! What happened, Albus?"
had to be the one to vanquish Voldemort. How was it possible that there were two prophesied heroes?
Harry's reply probably wasn't particularly intelligible. It was barely even polysyllabic. Despite that, Effie managed to glean some form of information from it.
Iana clearly didn't look too happy with the idea of leaving it to Dumbledore, but even she couldn't argue that the man wasn't capable of dealing with it.
It was strange just how much the appearance of normality could paper over the yawning cracks which had opened up in Harry's life. While every now and then, Harry would lose himself in worry about Voldemort returning, as the days and weeks wore on, and the homework piled up further than even during his O.W.L. years, he found that happening less and less.
"Sorry, honey," said Lily, cutting Sirius off before he could say anything too off colour. "Peter has been really busy at work with something. He did send you a present, though."
"I guess I just wouldn't be surprised if you told me your dad wanted you to get the full experience," he admitted.
"You still trying to work out where the… things are?" asked Neville. Harry was grateful that he realised that talking about Horcruxes in the common room probably wasn't the best idea.
Had something happened between Snape and Malfoy? Some kind of falling out? What about Rosier? He was meant to have been one of Malfoy's men too. Unfortunately, he wondered about the answer to that question a little too long, and Snape turned his irritated gaze in Harry's direction.
? It seemed so sudden. Did she even really know what love was? But no, that was a stupid question. She'd been willing to give up her life for him without hesitation.
"What happened to him?" asked Effie. Harry stopped her from moving forward to try and help. "What are you doing? He needs help!"
"Sit down, dear," said Lily with a smile. "I think we all have some questions, anyway. Would you indulge us?"
Maybe the best way forward was to let her think he'd given in and told her as much as he could. "We can't talk about it here," he said as he swung his hand at the busy room. "It's a task from Dumbledore."
"Good," said Lily, her attention switching back to Harry once more. "Now what is it you two really want?" she asked with a wry smile. She'd always had an uncanny ability to tell when Harry had some ulterior motive.
There was a distant look in her eyes, and Harry could tell she was thinking about the events of Halloween. "What really happened on Halloween?" he asked. "How did you end up at the Ministry?"
He soon reached the top, and just as he was about to knock on the door, Dumbledore's voice issued from it. "Come in, Harry!"
"Is the students still being hungry?" he asked, looking delighted by the possibility. "Is yous be needing more of the food?"
"Our Elf saved my life," Iana said simply. "He also probably did more to raise me than my father ever did."
"She loved that ugly thing," said Helena. "Perhaps more than she ever loved me. And I resented it, perhaps more than I ever resented her. She was so perfect. Beautiful, witty, and of course with the wisdom of Ravenclaw herself. How could I ever have measured up to her standards? Especially when her standards were impossible to reach, even for her. She'd forgotten what the Diadem did for her, I thought. She'd come to think of it as a natural part of herself, and she resented me for failing to live up to her legacy."
"No, sir." Harry shook his head and peered closer at the bowl.
anything," said James firmly. "You're only seventeen, and there's no way we're going to let some hokum spouted by that old fraud put you into the middle of a war. If we can keep him from regaining a body, he might
"I dropped him and backed away, but he just called out to my mother again. Said they'd done everything they could to save the girl, me, but it was a lost cause. He said no matter how they tried to hide my name from him, even from themselves, the Dark Lord couldn't be denied. Then he died."
"Not only is Harry older, but he—"
"My arse," said a new voice. All three of them looked up to find Seamus lugging his own trunk into the compartment. "You don't lock yourself in your room for a month when everything is fine."
"Albania," she replied. "I fled with it as far from Hogwarts as I could imagine. I would have gone further, but the Baron caught up with me there."
“Strangely?” Draco asked, his stomach sinking.
Then Zabini had dragged Ron out onto the dance floor and tried to intimidate him by grinding against his crotch, only to find that, out of the four of them, Ron did the best slut drop. The sound of Zabini’s surprised laughter rang clear across the noise of the club, breaking down the last of the walls that had tentatively been held between them all. Parkinson slung her arm around Hermione’s shoulder and led her out to dance, while Bulstrode winked at Neville and waited for him to follow.
Then part of him began to panic—Draco had said he didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to fuck; he wanted to be intimate and vulnerable. All this time he had been waiting for Draco to be ready, and he suddenly realised he had no idea how to do that, himself.
“Me more than you,” he admitted.
And what had happened to him? When had he become so… different? So sour?
“Well—” he began, intending to carry their charade as long as he could when a commotion behind them made him turn.
Potter’s eyes met his, and Draco winced, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
The answer comes in the form of the sinking weight of guilt in Harry’s stomach.
“We can’t keep on like this,” Draco said slowly. “Not out there, but certainly not in here—we’re going to get ourselves killed.”
She never had been one to mince words. Draco’s chest spiked in irritation; couldn’t she stop analysing everything for five seconds? They’d only just begun to put their plan into action, and she was already stomping all over it in six inch stilettos.
“It’s after midnight,” he said lightly, going by no obvious medium but the stars. “Guess I’ll try the gate. If it’s going to open at all, it will be now.”
Harry was going to have a heart attack, he was sure of it, but what a way to die.
“Please,” he drawled infuriatingly, “The whole school knew how much you hated the Kneazle.
Potter hurled the first one so hard it hurt, and Draco responded in kind, because no matter what the curse was doing to them, they weren’t friends.
“I’ll be your anchor.”
He’s not someone who can change like that. He is who he is. It took him a long time to come to terms with that, and if that’s no longer who Draco wants him to be, then there is only one answer. It’s just not the answer Harry wants it to be.
“What? Why is that funny, Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry knew he had approximately two seconds before Malfoy got up and stormed away and that was the end of their exploration of sex together.
Just as the room began to fade, Potter leaned back in, their lips meeting in a gentle kiss that lingered a moment after everything else disappeared. Draco tried with everything in him to hang onto the memory, but after a few moments more, it faded too.
“For fuck’s—” Harry turned the parchment around to read it. The words were still moving; Malfoy was just being an arse. He shoved it back in Malfoy’s face. “Look at how they’re moving. You’re telling me that’s normal?”
“The headache is temporary.” Draco shot him a dry look. “That’s the good news. The bad news is that you’ve pissed off a territorial Veela, and now we’re both going to pay the price.”
“I mean, I’m not a Veela,” Potter said, studying his very human hands, eyes flicking to Draco’s. “But it looks to me as though the last debt is an offering of mercy.”
Draco crossed the room to the mantle and tried to turn the hourglass onto its side, like the right-hand one. But it wouldn’t move—obviously. “These must represent the three phases.” He ran a hand through his hair. “It’s found us compatible, and once this phase concludes, the execution will start.”
But before he could figure it out, something cold crossed Malfoy’s face, and he drew his hand away.
Draco feigned surprise. “Do I? How did I manage that?” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “And shouldn’t that information be a little more… unspeakable?”
When they were certain no one was in any danger, Morgan waved her hands again, and the store exploded once more into sound and motion, the echo of the explosion ringing in their ears.
After that, Harry pretended not to watch him at all. He was just about to suggest it was time they all go to sleep, when Seamus suddenly shushed everyone.
“I prefer to sober up outside,” he said slowly, wondering what was going to happen now.
Understanding dawned on Potter’s face. “So it’s not a government handout—it’s a charity partnership program.”
The only problem was that by opening the box, they would alter the state of the curse. The carefully maintained and isolated environment that the identification spell relied on would be ruined, and it would be too dangerous for them to re-enter the Ether and conclude their study. They would no longer be able to complete the identification spell and unravel the curse, which meant that the wards around the Pensieve wouldn’t deactivate.
