He wasn’t dependable. He couldn’t be trusted to keep a stable job. He was mentally ill for one thing, with nightmares so bad he couldn’t sleep without someone half the time, cue the consistent sleeping around. And some days the thoughts were so bad that someone; usually Hermione or Ron, sometimes Luna, Ginny or Dean would have to come over and sit with him. He was grateful for his friends, but also embarrassed about the days they had to help him eat or shower, stay with him to make sure he didn’t hurt himself. He had tried to join his parents when he was twenty, but Charlie; God, Charlie, had found him with a wand to his head, took it away, and held him while he screamed.
“You know my relationship with them is complicated, Harry. I just like to leave that all behind while I’m in Romania.”
He wandered around the house for a while, appreciating the fine architecture and the heavily woven magic embedded in the very core of the house. Magic that had been there for centuries.
But instead, Charlie approached with a big dark blue umbrella, angled it over Draco’s head, and rearranged his long limbs to sit cross legged on the bench next to him.
Draco couldn’t talk about his parents. He couldn’t even think about them without freezing up like that. Charlie didn’t like to talk about his own family much, said he had left for a reason and didn’t need them pushing their way into his adult life, too. But Draco never said anything. He had never spoken a word about them, about his childhood, his home. It was just too much. He hadn’t even wanted to come to England for fear that everything would come crashing back, but going back to the manor? It sent an indescribable wave of fear over him.
“I’m proud of you.” He reached out his hand to hold Draco’s. It was warm and familiar. It felt like home.
Charlie looked Harry in the eyes and reached out to hold his foster brother’s hand, and squeeze it gently.
And so he didn’t push him off, he didn’t pull his wand at him. He just let him cry, and held him closer.
“Charlie, I’m not. I’m 22, I haven’t figured out my life yet, my mental health is kind of a mess, and as we’ve just discovered; I’m a former Death Eater!”
“Marius will cover for me. I’ll even make both the phone calls for you, just stay in bed with me today.”
Draco didn’t want to talk about it with anyone, and certainly not this man who was everything to him, and who knew nothing about the horrors that had occurred at his own hands.
“Ok, that sentence means almost nothing to me, Harry. So how do you two know each other, and why did he throw up on the sidewalk when he saw you?”
“There are lots of people who are rough around the edges. That doesn’t mean they don’t need people who care about them. I mean, look at half the dragons that come into our sanctuary. They don’t trust us, they can be aggressive, I’ve gotten hurt more times than I can count in this career. But I’ve never doubted that each and every one of them deserves a chance. Deserves our care. Same applies to humans, doesn’t it? You still deserve people who care. I think everyone does. Even the people locked up in Azkaban have families who wanted better for them.”
Sure, he would love to give Malfoy a good yelling at, but he didn’t really feel the urge to slice him open anymore, which Hermione would say was progress.
They walked back, slowly and awkwardly through the rain, less cheery than when they came there the first time.
“It was a lapse of judgment! And you didn’t ask for his either, now can you explain the situation to me again.”
The bedside table had a glass and a (newly repaired) lamp on it, and- you know what? Yeah, if Charlie would be here too; condoms would be a good idea. He strolled over to his own bedroom and threw some in the drawer.
“He never loved me, I know that now. But as a child, there’s no way to believe that someone who raised you doesn’t love you, at least a little.”
Draco felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Potter was suddenly getting so angry just as he thought he was starting to make some progress with him. He had been trying to relate to the man’s experiences for Merlin’s sake, but suddenly he couldn’t breathe. The world was spinning again, and his heart was surely about to break out of his chest. He could feel the tears springing to his eyes because suddenly it was all happening again.
“It’s ok, Harry. Really, that’s what I was thinking. Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your hair in a bit.”
Harry sighed and slumped down at the table, stealing a slice of Charlie’s toast. “Among other things.”
Romania had done him good, but things like these didn’t just go away. He was no longer emaciated and on the brink of death, but there were bad days, and bad weeks where he struggled, and his eating habits weren’t exactly normal.
Harriet chuckled as she downed the butterbeer, using the back of her frayed sleeve to scrub away the froth clinging to her top lip.
Theodore spun to his parents, palms suddenly clammy, mouth opening, only to see them already turning, strolling away. His mouth shut with a click of clenched teeth. There was no point calling to them. They would only ignore him. They’d done what they saw as their duty, seen him, relatively, safely to school grounds. As far as they were concerned with their broken son, that was enough.
“Hey, don’t be like that, Cedric. I messed around when I was younger too. Many kids do. Except you got
Cedric Diggory was a boy who already had his life planned out. He would finish school and start an internship at the Ministry, aided by his father’s contacts. There, he would slowly climb the political ladder. At twenty-four, he’d have a wife and a modest home. By thirty, two shit brained kids, one boy, one girl that he could bring out for the Yule postcards and forget about as soon as they were back out of sight. By forty, young for their kind, he would be the next Minister of Magic.
“I’ll meet you right here at nine, don’t be late! We have a late dinner with the Greengrass’s and it’s the ideal occasion to sidle up to their eldest daughter and get some intel! Cedric! Cedric?"
Typically, Hogwarts was alive with sound. The hum of chatter buzzed off the towering stone walls in the corridors as students rushed to their next lesson in roving bands. The odd clang of a cauldron exploding adding to the beat. The bass the drawling scorn of Professor Snape tearing down another dithering student while staring down his hooked nose. The pitter and patter of house elf feet puttering in the kitchens, rushing to finish the evening feast. The bubbling of old copper pipes pulsing. The bellow of teachers standing in front of lecture halls trying desperately to keep the waning attention upon them. The click of laughter as a prank was played. Generally by some nameless Weasley in a long line of redheads.
, right now, this second. You waste that, and you have no hope of ever becoming Minister of Magic, as you should. The kids alright, a few bruises and scrapes, nothing Pomphrey couldn’t heal. However, what won’t heal so easily is your reputation. You need it
He stood there, alone, in the frigid breeze, staring at the white face until it struck a minute later. Then he rushed all in one, determined to get to the library, or as far as he could, before the odds came back and ruined everything and made him late and-
He plucked it up, the parchment rustling in his grasp as the quill rolled on the table. Thrusting his glasses up his slanted nose, Flitwick read on, the flutter of his lips shifting with the words.
That’s how. All that hard work, all that studying… Gone. Just like that. You’ll end up having to settle. Do we, Grangers, settle?”
potion set Draco had been eyeing was four years ago, and he had been given it in equal measure already, by both his mother and father, and even once from his Godfather Snape, for the last five Yules.
“You want to miss a Quidditch match? You want to ruin everything? Quidditch makes you popular, son, and it’s that popularity you will use once you leave Hogwarts for the Ministry. You start your networking
Harry wrapped his arms around her, letting his chin rest on the top of her head and his fingers played with her hair. Ginny smiled into his exposed chest, her breath falling in rhythm with his.
The girl looked up at his boyfriend with big eyes and pulled a small smile onto her lips, “s’alright. I just want us to be okay… And I’m sorry I finished it”.
“You did something to me.” Draco squeezed his eyes shut to avoid the stare, “you’ve been taunting me for weeks! Staring over at the Gryffindor table constantly, hell you even go to our Quidditch practises!”
An almost silence came over the table, only Ron’s harsh puffs of breaths filling their ears. Harry halted his hand and watched the liquid quickly become stationary before putting the glass slowly down on the table.
Occasionally she placed her plump lips on the side of Potter’s face and whispered in his ear. She was laughing again, her white teeth reflecting in the crimson flickers of the fire. She looked perfect, not a sign of blemishes anywhere. She has nothing to hide. The look Potter gave her made Draco’s eyes water in pain. He looked happy.
during the war must have been difficult. Not having any time to experiment but that does not give you the right to step foot into this castle and take what isn’t yours to have.”
Pansy was draped across the hard leather sofa. She was laying on her side, her head propped up by her arm, her legs perfectly placed to highlight the shortness of her skirt and the top of her stockings.
“-Well here is the time to announce something,” Finch-Fletchley wobbled to his feet glass in hand. “We may have decided to add a few drops of Veritaserum to the punch, for good fun!”
“Honestly Ron! I think he just feels guilty. You said he’s been following you, but he never makes contact or tries to get close. Perhaps he just wants to keep an eye on you, maybe return the favour after you saved his life?”
Throughout the night Draco had noticed Potter had been enjoying a few beverages here and there. His body language being relaxed and loose, but now he sat on the floor like a statue
Draco could feel a burst of fiery anger bubble throughout his veins as he stared at his mate. His internal talons pushing against the back of his hand ready to break out.
Her eyes were feral and glazed over with intoxication, looking Harry up and down. His t-shirt was slightly crumpled and a sheen to his forehead, “had fun?”
Even with ‘allure’, Draco was sure he looked a right mess. For one, his hair was absolutely filthy, two, he had dried blood all over him and third his pale skin appeared ghostly in the candlelight.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. This was all too much, Dean was right, he was weak, he has no way to fight back. His only option was to screw his eyes shut. The impact of leather soles scuffing against stone allowed him the knowledge that Thomas was encroaching into his space. A woody smell overpowering him. Warm breaths rhythmically hit his flushed cheeks. The faint rumble of his class was mere meters away but Draco was frozen and physically far too weak to run.
“Well you did, didn’t you?” Ron spun around, his forehead bunched up, “nobody is angry at you mate, hell, I know more than anyone about the dangers of love potions. He had it coming”
“Without my mate, I die,” Draco rolled his grey eyes. “I can’t get the medical help normal veelas would get so, yeah, this is it for me. That’s why that auror is here. He is waiting to cart my body off somewhere and have it announced that the Malfoy line is dead, along with its heir. Then the parties will start.”
He stared at Draco like he cared and for some reason, this was making Draco equally angry and ecstatic. He let his head fall into a slight nod, the bloody tips of his hair sticking in his fair eyelashes.
“I’m sure you are aware of why I’ve asked you here as I received your owl this morning,” she spoke quietly. “We need to discuss what happened with Dean Thomas.”
Deep down, Draco was more than aware of this eventuality. After discovering there were no more potions for him, it was a frequent worry. He couldn’t expect anyone to want to go out of their way to aid an Ex-Death Eater. His death was fast-approaching and it was probably going to meet him before the month was up.
“G-Get the hell o-off me!” The burning was only getting worse with the prolonged physical contact. Only a mate can touch their Veela. Draco swung his back and forth like a shimmy to escape the touch but Thomas’ grip was too strong. “P-Please…”
“Remember, they will alway believe me over you.” Thomas whispered into the shell of Draco’s ear before giving him a swift punch to the gut and walking out.
“Shh, just slow down a bit Gin, you’re getting yourself worked up,” he planted a soft kiss on the top of her head. As he petted her shine hair her breathing began to calm. “Right, so let’s try again. What did I do?”
A flash of red hair darted between the crowds on the staircases up to the third floor. Harry manoeuvred through the robed bodies until he could wrap his hand around her wrist pulling her back to him.
“That’ll be the Wrackspurts.” Carefully Luna carefully placed her hand on Draco’s shaking thigh, covered by his trousers and smiled up at him, “you’re in pain. You should be with your mate.”
“Ravenclaw are hosting a social gathering Friday, you should come…” Luna’s smooth Irish accent filled the empty corridors, it was strange to have a conversation with a willing participant. “Dean isn’t a bad person Draco, but I do think he is wrong.”
“They’ve gone now Dray,” she whispered. He quickly reached over his shoulders and felt nothing but the rips in his clothes. “They disappeared as you drifted off.”
“Finnegan,” snapped McGonagall, not taking her eyes off Draco’s. “This is a very serious matter Malfoy.”
Unfortunately, life has been really crazy at the minute. My department at work has been shut down and I was made redundant so I've not been in the right mindset to be writing. So this chapter may be a bit stiff but hopefully it will fill the gap! Please let me know your thoughts xx
“Lovegood said it’s allure or something…” She nodded and slipped back into her seat watching the jittery boy play with his hands. “…I didn’t even know I could do that.”
Pansy looked down to her feet and ran her hands down her skirt, eyes flicking up to meet Draco, frowning. “Do I really look like a trollop?”
“Come on Draco,” she smiled and twirled around. All of the bodies surrounding the courtyard watched in intrigue. So Draco aimlessly followed.
Draco didn’t make it to the bed, he crumpled down onto the floor. His robe catching on a splinter of wood on the doorframe.
“I don’t know what you are talking about Potter,” he managed to wheeze out. He kept a clenched fist pulsating under robes, the occasional droplet of blood rolling into his palm.
die and that auror outside will take his body to be thrown into an unmarked grave on Azkaban Island”.
“Ginny, I need you to fully explain to me what you’re saying because I didn’t lay a hand on Malfoy.”
Harry took a deep intake of breath, filling his lungs to the max before slowly letting all the air swift out through his nostrils.
The brunette boy frowned, “great so everyone is talking about me? Suppose there is no change there then”.
With another curt nod, the redhead raised up on her toes and planted a chaste kiss on the corner of his lips careful to avoid directly where Malfoy had supposedly been.
The fluffy insides melting in between his teeth as the syrup run slowly down his throat. He thought yet again that nowhere did breakfast as good as Hogwarts. Looking up as he continued to chew, he spotted Ginny standing as still as a post in the middle of the hall.
“I’m sure we would have heard if a student had died in a broom cupboard,” he slowly caressed his girlfriend’s back. “If it’ll make you feel better, I’ll go to the hospital wing after breakfast and see what they know, okay?”
Potter shook his head in confusion before realising what had caused the colour to reappear in the pale boy’s cheeks, “Jesus, no, not that Malfoy!”
Draco placed his palms either side of his hips and used his remaining strength to shift himself up a little against the wall so he could look right at the other boy.
Taking the slip of paper in slight confusion and making his way back towards the door, Malfoy shouts, “This isn’t over, Potter!”
"I'm going to need you well rested in time for the twenty-fifth, you know." Draco informs him, standing next to where Harry sits on the counter. "Which means you should probably stop wandering around the house in the middle of the night."
“'Appropriate' is a horrible word. So much condescension and control and pettiness all squashed into four little syllables."
The thought of it makes Harry wrap his arms around his torso, a protective barrier against the world.
Hermione purposefully frowns at the coffee cup in Harry's hand, shifting on the soft carpet underneath the Park sky.
"Yep. And this is the best I can do. You should know, I don't usually let anyone else come in here... except 'Mione, when she helped me with the ceiling." Harry's not exactly sure why he's telling all this, he just knows that he wants Draco to know. Ginny had stopped by for a few minutes the night before, to bring his favourite coffee, and Harry hadn’t mentioned it at all: he thought it was too personal to show her. For some reason, he only wants to share it with Draco.
“It’s from Ron,” he says, finding it difficult to hide his excitement. It’s the first letter from Ron in over six weeks.
“No one understands how difficult it must be for them!” Hermione rants, sipping Harry’s Earl Grey, which she prefers to his coffee (even the good Guatemalan one). “Working all the time, and with no breaks or anything. It’s slavery, only worse because of the way they hurt themselves.” A weird gleam coming into her eyes, she asks. “What do you think, Draco?”
"I do. As far as I'm concerned the whole thing is shrouded in mystery, but curiosity hasn't exactly served me well in the past." Draco sighs. "Bugger it, tell me anyway. Caution is for peasants and Hufflepuffs."
Malfoy had said. And now he knows the truth of all the things that occurred. And now Harry knows the truth of something entirely different:
After a few minutes of awkward silence, Harry decides to clear up and misconceptions from the night before. "You know," he says, and even he can hear how falsely casual his voice is, "I was pretty drunk last night. Probably talking a load of rubbish, I usually do. Not that I get drunk very often, but... yeah. Anything I did was just really... you should probably just ignore anything I said, or did, because—"
“She said she was going to fire me, and make sure I never got another job in charity, and... Potter, I’m sorry.” Malfoy sounds sorry, too, but it isn’t enough.
"If I'm the something then everything changes," Draco says quietly, and the emotion in his grey eyes is suffocating.
Harry thinks of Neville, of how Neville killed the last Horcrux; of how Neville will never get half the credit as a hero that he deserves; of how Neville is able to move on from the war and love his life, and his plants, and Harry's ex-girlfriend.
Draco chooses that moment to appear in the kitchen doorway. They make eye contact for a few moments, and Harry observes that Draco must be just as hungover as he is.
Hermione merely shakes her head again, muttering under her breath something that sounds suspiciously like
"Fuck off, Malfoy," Harry says, and Malfoy glares back. "I don't want to be your project, so just stop it."
"I do have my own owl," Harry mumbles, gesturing to a sleeping owl in the corner behind Malfoy (“Samira,” Hermione had named it, but Harry felt it best not to get attached). "It's not my fault if yours didn't want to go back to you. It's definitely not my fault if you mistreat your owls,” Harry adds, giving Malfoy a look that properly conveys he’s well aware Malfoy is an owl abuser.
"In," Draco mumbles against his mouth, and Harry wants to tell him to shut up and kiss him harder, but all that comes out is a low “hmm,” before he deepens the kiss himself.
“Fuck,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s throat when a gently eager hand comes to cup his growing erection.
"Er, I took them down," Harry says sheepishly. Draco’s glare deepens, so he adds quickly, "And put them back!" Draco just looks at him. Harry sighs. "I didn't think you'd let me in."
Until the words really sink in, and then all he feels is sadness. "How many of them left the country?"
“Who’s Mrs. N?” is the only response. Malfoy actually looks intrigued. It’s a far cry from the disdainful expressions Harry is accustomed to getting from him. Or,
“Shit,” Harry mumbles, rising to his feet. It’s been a long time since he’s Apparated. Actually, he’s rather lucky that he didn’t splinch himself.
“Er,” Draco starts, and then, taking a deep breath, “I told President Cholmondely that you’d be coming. To the Gala, that is.”
Harry thinks, and the thought makes him strangely unhappy. However, when Malfoy finally drops his silverware looking full and pleased, Harry can’t help but feel proud of himself. He hasn’t ever seen Malfoy looks this content. It’s almost as nice as his smile.
Although in all honesty, that’s not the only reason he doesn’t like Malfoy looking at him. Harry knows how bad he must looks these days, though most of the mirrors in the house have been covered or charmed away; he doesn’t want to look at Harry Potter in the mirror every day. He’s found that it’s easier not to.
Harry groans predictably when he opens the door; although, really, he’s not very upset. Can’t have Malfoy knowing that, though.
Draco doesn't reply. He sighs, and after a moment suspended in time, finds Harry's hand on the carpet. Their fingers lightly touch, and despite how fast his heart is hammering in his chest, Harry feels more serene than he has in a long, long time.
Viscerally, Harry feels as if he's about to implode; in addition to the unclear and downright contradictory emotions twisting through him, his hungover body isn't making things any easier.
Harry’s stomach turns unpleasantly as he watches as Draco’s face goes from shock to relief to rage. Draco throws open the door and glares.
"Still not helping, Draco." Harry says, tugging at his hair. "No, this is no good. It has to be the park, or it doesn't count."
"My friends don't know," Harry snaps, suddenly embarrassed, because Malfoy didn’t need to know that. "The only people that know what I've just told you are in this room."
Harry frowns. That sounds suspiciously like his dream last night. He really needs a new set of fantasies.
"Oh, fucking hell, 'Mione, I thought you were joking," Harry says, voice raspy from shock. He watches as Malfoy turns and look at him, watches his grey eyes go wide and his pale hand reach for his wand before Malfoy manages to pull himself together.
That’s why he is currently sitting behind his door, ready to open it the second Draco comes back, on the off-chance he ever does.
"That's right," Draco says, pushing past Harry into the hallway, "Saturday the first of May. You know what May is, don't you, Potter?"
Brows knitting, Harry looks up. “Because I want to smile more? I don’t know, ‘Mione. Is it really such a big deal?”
Harry had been planning on warning Draco before coming in his mouth, but when he finally unravels with an uninhibited shout, it’s too late to say anything. Draco doesn’t seem to mind.
Harry takes the seat opposite Malfoy at the table, resting tall mugs of coffee in front of them both. "What would be the point? You'd only come back anyway."
Today, Harry is sitting on the bottom step of the stairs, watching Draco clutch his newly re-packed briefcase like a lifeline. He looks worried.
Because Harry doesn't know where to go, he goes into his bedroom. It's the only room Draco has never been in, and therefore the only room where Harry can think properly without getting overemotional and confused again.
Flurrying around on the stove, Harry mutters, "I'm not tense," and worries that his voice is showing otherwise. Or the tight line of his shoulders. Or the way his hands tremble slightly from all the caffeine surging through his system.
Mrs. Norris, it seems, is in as bad a mood as Harry. He finds her shredding the curtains in what was probably Grandpa Black's old study. Not thinking properly, Harry reaches for her, and receives scratched hands for his trouble. Muttering a curse, he finally shoots a small shocking spell at her, and grabs her when she’s distracted.
using my own name to make me feel uncomfortable," Harry opines. "You always manage to make it sound like something rude.
Draco chuckles behind him. "No, it's not. It's cleaner here. Purer. And anyway, I hardly think you can call yourself an expert on fresh air."
"I don't expect you to do anything, Malfoy. I don't want your help! I never asked you to come here. I don't want you. Today is hard enough without having you sitting here and asking me stupid questions!" Harry yells, knocking his chair back and scrambling to his feet. Staring down at the other man, Harry is seconds away from punching him in the face.
Draco snorts. "I'm afraid that if you want anything done properly around here, you have to do it yourself."
"I will not. You were happy, Harry, and I can hardly believe it myself, but it was because of him," Granger says quietly, and the amount of pity on her face makes Harry's growing anger stronger yet. "And I'm not going to watch you make yourself miserable over him when it's obvious that you both feel—"
Draco’s expression is one of shock for at least five seconds, until he manages to pull himself together. "How do you know about that?"
A scene plays in Harry’s head, a painful memory from years ago in which Draco is shaking on the Astronomy tower and black-clad murderers are piled around him, telling him to kill Dumbledore,
"No. Filch died about six months ago, and nobody else wanted her. Hermione ended up with her at first; you know how she is," Harry explains, examining his own hands. "That didn't last long, though; Ron's a bit touchy about cats... long story," he says, looking at Malfoy, waiting for some response.
"Then stop pretending everything's fine!" Malfoy says, rising to his feet. "People died. Let's talk about that, shall we?"
"Well, excuse me for... " Draco begins, and then coughs clumsily, seemingly at a loss for words. "Go on."
“And it was nicer than you deserve. I’ve half a mind to throw myself off the Manor rather than deal with you
"It's just a name, Malfoy. I'm the one he murdered. Anyway, the point isn't the grisly details. The point is...” Harry twists his fingers and searches for words, “the train station.”
“I,” Draco begins, and is cut off by Harry’s mouth on his. “I won’t argue,” he tries again, when the mouth moves to his neck.
"No more so than anyone else," Malfoy admits, and when he looks up, their eyes meet and hold for a few long moments. Malfoy has nice eyes, Harry notices absently.
Worse than anything else is the knowledge that actually, one thing is different from when Harry first shut himself away, and that would be his libido. Even as depressed and jumbled as he feels, Harry can’t keep some of the arousal that comes with thoughts of Draco at bay.
Malfoy drops down onto the floor a few feet away, and Harry sees small puffs of dust rise up from the floor in his peripheral vision.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “Talking to me is better than being murdered? Wow, Malfoy, that’s the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
It feels like forever before he reaches the front porch, and Harry only has two slight heart attacks before he gets there. His frazzled mind takes two full minutes to find the magic-powered doorbell, and by that time he’s shaking.
Harry’s head goes blank. For the first time in days, there are no swarming words and building emotions and anything else unpleasant and unwanted. Instead, slowly, memories and phrases unravel in front of Harry’s eyes, and it’s like the whole world has taken a deep, deep breath.
"Cholmondely wants everyone on the Gala committee in her office in ten minutes," Draco sighs, looking at Harry, whom has luckily looked away from Draco's left arm by now. "I'm going to have to go."
"This one's a Sumatran, the other one was a Guatemalan," Harry explains, silently amused by how seriously Malfoy takes his coffee. “You are a Malfoy. You are Malfoy. That's your name. You're the one obsessed with it, anyway."
He's never seen him this vulnerable, so expressionless and calm. He looks nice even when he's obviously been drinking, even when his chin has light stubble on it and his grey eyes aren't open.
Suddenly, Harry feels both self-conscious and elated. The way Draco looks at him has feeling, emotion. While it used to make him feel like a bug under a microscope, Harry finds he rather likes it now.
"Shut up," Harry advises, dropping onto his back and looking at the ceiling. "Now lie down, and just look."
"Good morning to you, too, Potter," Malfoy calls, as he follows Harry through the hallway, into the kitchen.
"I hope my bitter disappointment isn't too upsetting for you," Draco murmurs, looking up and adding, "Potter," in his snarky way that makes Harry want to lean over and smack him upside the head.
"Really?" Harry asks, intrigued. It was a long way coming, he supposes. Those people were always a bit odd.
There’s no real use denying the hard-on that is growing steadily in Harry’s denims. It’s the first one he’s had in months, sure, but it isn’t as though he’s forgotten the feeling. Shakily wrapping a hand around his cock, Harry decides that it’s perfectly acceptable to take advantage of the situation.
"How much of it will I need to do so that your boss doesn't kill you?" Harry asks, stomach clenching in determination. He stares at the ceiling, unable to look at whatever expression is on Draco's face.
Rubbing a hand over his face, Harry says, “Things change, Hermione. Draco—Malfoy—he’s not like he was in school. He’s…” Harry pauses, shrugs, and tries to find the right words. “It’s not so bad, him coming here.”
"Well, tell me, then, before we both freeze to death," Draco says, arching an eyebrow and folding his arms. Christ, he looks so good. Harry only hopes that he can get Draco to smile again.
"Why is your stupid job more important than my safety?" Harry asks, pausing in front of Malfoy and looking him dead in the eye.
he chides himself, rising steadily to his feet and squinting his eyes against the sunlight coming from the ceiling. Shit, that hurts. He picks up the blanket and walks over to Draco, who is still asleep on the carpet. Carefully covering him with the blanket and mindful not to wake him up—because wouldn't that be awkward—Harry allows himself a moment to openly stare.
Draco pulls away, and Harry blinks at him, mind fogged by desire. Fuck, but Draco looks good with his lips swollen and his eyes almost black with lust. Grabbing his hand, Draco tugs him inside, and the warmth is more than welcome.
Harry rubs his face, wonders if maybe he should just threaten Malfoy into leaving his house, or hex him out, and decides that before anything else occurs, he needs good coffee.
Retrieving Malfoy’s scarf actually isn’t that difficult, once he’s found the cat and Stunned it gently. Back in the kitchen, Malfoy is looking forlornly at him hands and still trying to brush any remaining dust off his trousers. Harry pours them both coffee and leans against the counter.
They sit together in silence for a while, Hermione humming—and occasionally snorting in disbelief—as she flips through her copy of the
Hardly believing his ears, Harry laughs softly. Draco looks terrified, as if he wishes he hadn't said that, and he probably does, seeing as all Harry would have to do is say "no, actually, I'm not so sure," and then the whole thing will be shot.
"I know. I just wanted my list to sound longer. In fact, two things aren't even really a list," Draco admits, and Harry almost wants to smirk.
"Because it's not safe," Harry says truthfully. Nowhere other than this house is safe from the pain, or the prejudices, or the
"When you call me Potter. No one calls me Potter. No one's called me Potter since I was at school. I feel like I'm about to be called on to answer a question about Shrivelfig extract or given detention," Harry elaborates, scrunching up his nose and thinking back to unpleasant teachers and blond Slytherins that, in the past, would have rather fed themselves to a werewolf than ask him for a favour.
A few women walk through the entrance hall, and Draco practically trips over him in attempt to step farther away. It's too late, of course; the women have noticed them and walked away giggling.
Draco looks a little bit like he wants to cry, too. "You can't build a life around being safe and calm all the time. That's not how it works."
charm confirming just that, Hermione moves from the kitchen table and makes her way towards the door. "You ought to consider coming out of this house eventually, Harry," she calls.
Harry wonders what would happen if he punched Malfoy in the face. It’s a sad thought, because he’s sure the bastard would stay, anyway.
Coffee, he decides, and then he'll wait at the door for Malfoy, because Harry needs someone's company today of all days, and he's not selfish enough to pull down Hermione to suffer with him. Harry bets Malfoy is just as bad-off today as he is. Draco and that guilt of his.
Harry hears mumbled voices from downstairs and frowns. Hurriedly, he grabs his wand and sits up. That’s Hermione’s voice, definitely, but who is she talking to?
Oh. Just that, then. Harry breathes a sigh of relief. He really doesn’t want Hermione knowing which blond-haired git has been occupying all his thinking time lately.
It makes more sense this way. It's for the best, he mentally repeats, and the words have lost all meaning.
A moment of comfortable silence passes between them, until Harry quietly says, "I know you don't understand. You know, about the going outside. You don't have to pretend."
Harry rises from his seat and moves into what he’s dubbed Draco’s Favourite Armchair. But it doesn’t smell like him anymore.
.” Malfoy snaps, “Of course. My secretary is—never mind that, Potter. I demand that you give him back to me at once. Get your own owl.”
Harry groans, swears, and jumps up to sit on the counter, elbows on knees and head in hands. "Malfoy, if you have a shred... the tiniest shred of human decency left in you, please fuck off and leave me alone," Harry mutters. He finds himself strangely wondering if Malfoy will take that as a challenge to purposefully eliminate any human decency that may be left. Teenage-Malfoy would have.
There's a strange tension around Draco the next day, from the moment Harry opens the door. His eyes are darting around, trying not to settle on Harry’s face, and his ever-expressive face is looking distinctly guilty.
” Harry says. “It’s just… been a long time since I’ve seen him. And I don’t know if he’ll want to see me.”
"Even Malfoy needs something from me," Harry mutters, before deciding that it's about time he stops talking to himself. It’s a bad sign. He isn't getting
, Harry mentally chides himself. He knows better than anyone that Malfoy never wanted to do half the things he had to. And he had saved Harry’s life that day.
accustomed to getting from him, before the end of the war and the two years of bliss in which he didn’t have to see Malfoy at all.
It must have been strange to have grown up in such a large house, and with so much money. And it must be a dramatic change, Harry thinks, to have wound up living alone in a mansion with money that for once isn't helping you.
"That was different. I wasn't thinking about it. I was thinking about... something else," Harry says, looking out over the grounds.
"It's a good question, though, don't you think?" Malfoy asks, coming closer to Harry, evidently intending to enter the house.
"I look fantastic, as always," Draco sniffs, and Harry snorts because of the sheer fact that it's not a complete lie, and it should be.
He had kissed Malfoy. He had kissed Malfoy a lot, Harry would guess, although he doesn't remember the end of the kiss or anything afterwards, so he isn't entirely sure. They hadn’t had sex, at least: of that he’s positive, because Draco had been sleeping too far away, and they’d both been far too drunk to… clean up afterwards, so Harry would have known if they had.
Harry stares at him, watches Malfoy failing to control his anger, and thinks that this obvious seething passion is actually interesting to watch. In fact, he could watch Malfoy churn negative emotions all day; it’s schadenfreude, and it reminds Harry that he’s not the only one that doesn’t have all the control they need.
It works. Draco's eye blink rapidly, and he pulls himself back together. Harry wonders what the fuck that was about.
he thinks, pounding the doorbell slightly hysterically. He should have thought this through more. For all he knows, Draco is at work, or in bed with another person—
"Yes. And I still don't like you, by the way," Harry says, because agreeing with Malfoy is weird and he wants comforting familiarity more than anything else.  After a beat, he points to the cabinet and adds, "Cups are in that cupboard, there."
Both men hold their breaths, awaiting Hermione’s reaction. She cocks her head, apparently thinking about it closely. After a moment of thoughtful expression, she asks curiously,
Yet, here the stupid git is, knocking at his door. And knocking, and knocking, and knocking, until Harry gets so used to it that he doesn’t even hear it anymore. He re-immerses himself in a letter he’s writing to Ron—they mostly only talk by owl, these days. Ron’s too busy for much else.
Harry takes it as a compliment and, turning away to hide a tiny smirk, murmurs, "Gosh, thanks, Malfoy." That morning, he’d woken up feeling more rested than he had in longer than he cared to remember. Since before he was Avada Kedavra’d that second time, he suspects, and he knows why, too: getting the confession of what he had to do to save the world off his chest was more freeing than he ever would have thought. He had even tried not to think about it much after Malfoy left, because he hadn’t been sure how to feel about it, but now… After hours of excellent sleep in which no old ghosts haunted his dreams, Harry felt that maybe it wouldn’t kill him to shower and clean up a little.
Malfoy, it seems, has at least some sense, because he lets it drop. Instead, he takes off the duck gloves—unfortunately, Harry thinks, because really, he quite enjoys them—and mutters, "Her highness would certainly love that."
As soon as he had his belated epiphany, Harry had run all over his house, first grabbing shoes, then his wand, then a stick of Muggle gum to freshen his breath. Just in case. He wanted to make sure he would be prepared for anything, and, well, he does hope Draco will forgive him and they can move past it onto more... interesting things.
Somehow, it gets to the point when Harry misses Draco as soon as he's gone, and relishes the moment he arrives.
“Well,” Draco begins slowly, and Harry hopes with all his heart that Hermione and the pure-blooded prat aren’t about to have a massive dispute in his kitchen, “I think that as long as the elves are happy, we shouldn’t push them... right?”
Malfoy lifts his head fast enough to have it clang against the stove behind him. "Are you out of your
Malfoy sighs and puts his cup down. Harry finds himself annoyingly relieved—he really is going to hurt himself one day holding it the way he does."It's not about the money. It's about... let's call it damage control, for the Malfoy name. My parents are in France, so it's quite literally left to me. Don't think that I haven't exhausted every other option over the last two years," Malfoy says, studying his hands, and Harry has a feeling that he doesn’t talk about this much, to anyone. He wonders if Malfoy has any friends left. "Unfortunately, it turns out that charitable work for little children is the only thing that garners any respect for a Malfoy these days, and believe me, it's grudging."
Harry shrugs. “Most of the things she cares about are a bit… strange. House elf rights and werewolf legislation acts and evil cats are all part of who she is, really.”
Draco snorts, and Harry suspects that he's noticed all these things. "Mm-hm, and I might believe you if you could look at me or stop moving for a second. Or if you didn't look like you haven't slept for a week."
Harry smiles slightly, rubbing at his face a little, hardly believing himself. "Yes, Draco, I really will attend your horrible fucking Gala. I must have gone mad," Harry mutters. "You'll owe me big time, of course."
"I think it's time you start looking for someone, Harry," Hermione says cautiously, as though she's well aware how many times they've had this conversation before, and how differently Harry reacts every time. She seems nervous that Harry is going to blow up again, as he'd done when she brought the topic up a few months back.
“That's not true. You know exactly what to do to get rid of me," Draco says lightly, and as the words sink in, Harry feels something akin to longing in his chest. Longing for Malfoy to stay, for his companionship, if he's not mistaken, and that's not only weird, but it's also... true. Harry sighs.
"Care to elaborate?" Malfoy asks, glancing up from the floor and staring at Harry with wide, grey eyes that are devoid of anything less than kindness. "I know it's me and everything, but it rather seems like a good opportunity. And I shan't lie to you, I am curious."
“I'm going to make you a proper breakfast and you're going to eat it. Is that clear? Do you like eggs?"
He doesn't realise how long he's been sitting there until he hears the door to his house open, and his heart leaps inexplicably.
Harry has just gotten to the coffee part of that plan when the cupboard flaps a greeting above him. Turning around, he sees Draco in the kitchen doorway.
a voice in Harry's head asks, but he pushes it away. Fuming, he growls, “Yeah? Well he’s got a nerve if he thinks—”
“However much he doesn’t want to see you, he’ll want to see me even less,” Draco says, as if that’s some sort of consolation. It isn’t. “And the apartment is right there.” Harry swallows loudly. “Harry, it’s all right. I’m here.”
"Don't talk about her like that, Malfoy." Harry's snaps, less because he doesn't want Draco calling Ginny that—although he doesn't, of course—but more because he doesn't like Draco thinking about his sex life at all. It defies what they usually talk about—and they do have a usual, Harry has realised, which is all kinds of weird—and brings up topics that he would not discuss with anyone, let alone Draco. Especially not with him after all the fantasy-dreams that Harry has been having.
The last bit of Harry's mind that's sober is insisting he stop it this instant, because getting drunk with Draco Malfoy is the epitome of bad ideas. However, the last bit of Harry's mind that's sober is completely overruled. He takes another swig from his cup.
"Glad we got that cleared up," Malfoy murmers faintly, looking away. "So, you came back. You saved lots of lives. You defeated the Dark Lord. I'd say you made a good call."
Harry thinks of all the days Draco had come to Grimmauld Place not even sure if Harry would be attending the Gala, thinks of the owls his mum sends him at five in the morning and of the only pair of ears that has heard his story about dying. He sighs, not unhappily. "He doesn’t deserve it," Harry agrees. "Don't tell him I said that."
Scuffing his socks against the floor, Harry mumbles, "Yeah," and hopes to God that he sounds surer than he feels.
"With me, then,” Draco says after a few moments, holding out his arm. Harry bites his lip but grabs it, nerves speeding his movement. "If you want to splinch yourself, be my guest. You can't Apparate out of here... at the moment.”
Malfoy doesn't respond, and Harry feels the grey eyes boring through him. After a few moments, Malfoy changes the subject, asking, "So, where are all these journalists that are supposedly baying for your blood?"
And there’s Ginny, with her red hair and her curves and her fighting spirit that was never what he needed.
Harry snorts and walks back over to the owl that's still sitting in his kitchen, waiting for a response. It nuzzles his hand a bit, and he finds himself feeling sorry for the bird. Anything that belongs to Draco Malfoy must need all the love and attention it can get, since there’s no chance it gets any from Malfoy himself. Harry pets the owl, then shoos it out the window. He throws the letter on a side table and doesn’t make an effort to reply.
Draco takes a deep breath, and Harry would do the same if only he could breathe properly at all. "Your speech is the pre-dinner one, so you can say your piece, make awkward conversation with her highness while you eat your steak, and then you can bugger off if you want to."
He walks back into Malfoy Manor for what will surely be the last time ever. When he gets back to the Floo, he takes a deep breath and rubs his face one more time before going home.
“You knew they'd take pictures," Draco slurs slightly, "It was a... you know. A gonefore conclusion."
"Well, that's disturbing. You won't sign one little piece of paper to say you'll attend a Gala because you hate me, but you're cooking for me?" Malfoy says, as if it’s that easy.
"No, it's Gala month. And you'll always be Potter to me," Draco says, flashing Harry the brightest smile he’s ever seen. Suddenly, Harry isn’t tired anymore. In fact, he feels something close to... but, no. There’s no way. That part of his mind and anatomy has been asleep for far too long to wake back up at the sight of
A shout of “Malfoy’s here!” comes up the stairs, and Harry rolls his eyes. It must be time for another of her elaborate schemes to get him outside. He wonders if whoever is with her will attempt to ambush him and shove him out the door. Part of him hopes so: it’s been so long since he’s gotten in a good fight.
"They do say that people begin to resemble their pets, don't they? I'm trying to remember who was this antisocial first, but it's a close call, Potter."
"I'm sure it wasn't, dear." Then, after a moment's pause, "You know, Harry, you are a very nice young man. Much like the men in my day, in fact. Oh, but back then..."
Startled, Draco looks up, seeming generally confused as to why Hermione is asking him. He glances at Harry. Harry shrugs.
Draco frowns, glances down, and takes a deep breath. “Harry,” he says, and even in his anger, Harry appreciates the use of his first name. “Don’t.”
Harry wants to cry. For the first time since second May, he wants to cry, and that would not do.  He wishes Draco would leave, wishes he would just leave and not come back until the stupid Gala was over and they could talk about something else.
The sound of his name said like that, so open and vulnerable and unsure, makes Harry raise his head. He doesn't know what he's expecting though, and Draco only looks at him, apparently at a loss for words.
expect you to understand. You didn't have the same sort of upbringing I did. It's no one's fault," Malfoy says quietly, as though trying to comfort him.
Harry thinks of what Sirius would say if he could see him now. He thinks that maybe he doesn't want to know. Remus would understand.
He looks gorgeous, black dress robes clinging to his lithe frame perfectly, silver lining bringing out the light grey of his eyes. Light blond hair is styled more than it usually is, and there’s a slightly pink colour to his cheeks that could be excitement or anticipation or both.
The mention of the occasion when Harry had been forcibly dragged to Malfoy Manor seems to shut Malfoy up for a while. He wonders why talking about the hours Harry spent at Malfoy Manor seems to make Malfoy and guilty, instead of proud or indignant.
As for Hermione, he thinks she's probably sitting beside Ron, cooking with Molly and talking about work or a new book or the war. They never talk to Harry about the war. Sometimes, they treat Harry as if he'd died in it. None of them are even aware that he did.
Malfoy shows up earlier than usual. Harry can't help but snap a little as he opens the door. "What the hell kind of time do you call this? In, Malfoy."
"Look at the ceiling, not at me," he murmurs, because he wants Draco to see his Park sky just as much as he wants Draco to see
"Muggles are weird," Draco had said, pouting and with no real bite. His view on Muggles has changed some, since his years at Hogwarts, and Harry can’t help himself from appreciating the humorous, maliceless confusion that has taken its place.
"I meant in comparison to how terrible you usually look," Malfoy sneers, and Harry rolls his eyes. "Let's proceed directly to coffee, shall we?"
Holding a cup out to him, Harry takes a moment to study Malfoy; he’s still wearing expensive and slightly elaborate clothes, Harry notes, but with less of an air of superiority. Malfoy looks much better than he did at the trials: less pale and worn, more alive. The malnourished look he’d sported then, however, is still very much present. It’s a wonder if all the house-elves he must have aren’t feeding him properly.
Merlin, it’s unlike anything, seeing Draco wrapping around him like that—it’s better than any sex he’s ever had, and he needs to have it forever.
"Who is it, 'Mione?” Harry calls to her, though he’s sure he knows already. “Someone nice, or Malfoy?"
"I doubt that," Harry mutters. He looks up from his coffee into Draco's face, and when their gaze meets and holds, Harry finds himself struggling with a parade of clashing emotions, all trying to take control. In the end, he settles on annoyed, because it's much safer than slightly attracted or unwisely curious or any of the other unwelcome things he's feeling.
Malfoy had left the hospital wing. All of Gryffindor couldn’t understand why the Slytherin had been in the hospital wing for two days when he didn’t get hurt, Dean only went in for a brief check up and was out within the hour. Rumours had gone round that they were keeping him there for the Aurors to come and take him to Azkaban, but obviously this wasn’t true. The inky foot prints elegantly danced across the second floor until they went quickly off course into a classroom. Harry stared at the second name in the room,
He scuffed his heels across the bare wood flooring to the furthest bookshelf. His shaky hands instinctually reaching out to the copy of The History of Pureblood Society. Like on repeat, Harry opened the antique book to find the damage he’d inflicted on it. He’d taken no issue is knifing out the middle of the book. Those prejudiced words were replaced by something far more beneficial for Harry: Willow Heart.
There wasn’t much dignity left in a person after a stay in Azkaban. Still, nothing could quite prepare him for Divination.
There was a lack of air in the classroom and all Draco could hear was the slight wheeze on his own breath. Do Veela’s have appalling lungs as well as appalling taste in mates? His throat was open in hopes of allowing just a slither of air into his over worked lungs. What would happened if he fainted now? Pomfrey wouldn’t help. Maybe that would be it. No more waiting for his inevitably painful death, he could just go now with an asthma attack like muggles. Maybe this was a blessing in disguise.
Draco blinked at the secretive Gryffindor; he could feel the heat beneath his skin start to increase in temperature. He mumbles his next question.
Draco’s head emerged slowly from behind his manmade cover, the red in his eyes matching the patches of blood on the wings. Pansy leant in closer, on her hands and knees. The Veela appearing taken aback.
Pansy quickly shuffled onto her knees, an unsteady arm reaching out to point at him, her green eyes wide in awe. He could see clearly that her crisp white blouse now had two equal slashes through it with red slowly seeping to the cotton. He peeked down to his hands and saw his fingers replaced with short bloody talons. The scales surrounding the sharp appendages blended seamlessly with his pasty white skin. “D-Draco, you have w-wings!”
He found her on the second set of stairs to the boys' dormitories, perched on the sill of a stained glass window staring him down. Her body language tense and unforgiving.
“I don’t know what happened to you Dray but this is ridiculous. I’m going for breakfast, feel free to join me when you’ve grown up.”
“Fine,” he sighed, pausing for a second, “but it’s only right if I get to ask you things in return.”
The ends of her greying hair had started to curl out underneath her peaked hat. Draco rubbed his eyes and attempted a shrug but found he only hissed out in pain. Pomfrey ceased her pacing to watch the young boy wince.
Eventually, with Pansy’s help, Draco pulled himself to his feet. The outcome of all of the alcohol making him softly sway side-to-side, Potter followed suit and soon enough they left the common room. No words were uttered between the two on the journey to the elusive broom closet. Potter just walking ever so slightly ahead, a slight sway to his swagger.
Groaning, Draco prized his eyes apart. Black dots dancing in the forefront of his vision. “He’s worth it.”
The room feel into a level of silence where all you can hear is your pulse thumping rhythmically through your ears. Swiftly Thomas turned to face Draco, a look of uncertainty mixed with anger apparent.
Draco could feel his throat clenching at the memories, he swallowed hard trying to push down the sickly feeling.
The agonising sensation was still at the forefront of his mind but it was lessened by the tiny tender buzzing in his blood. A confirmation of his worst thoughts. Potter was close.
Everything felt too familiar, the waft of sausages and soap invading his nostrils. Those dark brown eyes penetrating his skull and the stone wall grazing the scabs on his tender back.
As a veela he should have felt proud to catch that intimate glance, but as Draco Malfoy, he was utterly ashamed. He was far too skinny and marked all over, there was nothing for him to feel proud of. He discreetly tried to pull the mangled sheets up higher, but Potter noticed and reverted his gaze to the ceiling.
Slipping out of his seat the brunette headed over to his red-headed girlfriend who looked as if she were once again petrified.
“Who wouldn’t want you Dray?” Her eyes were bouncing around the room to avoid looking in his vacant eyes. There was a strong atmosphere in the dormitory that felt like giving up.
Backed against the stairs, Harry watches Draco above him, watches grey eyes travel over him as his own wrists are pinned to the marble. Watches Draco’s cock dangerously close to his own, and holds his breath in anticipation.
Harry flicks his hand and thinks of a cleaning charm. When Draco examines his newly cleaned hand, he scowls unconvincingly.
Harry sighs, leaning down to examine (and pick at) his own cat attack-related scratches. "I was just saying that I don't believe you. If you had dozens of friends, you wouldn't have spent every day this week and most of your weekend with me."
"How fucking dare you? You know nothing about what happened that day. Nothing. So just shut the fuck up."
“Esme, you sodding little traitor!” Malfoy says, exasperated, as the owl nips Harry’s ear. Malfoy’s words register, and Harry emits a chuckle that startles both of them.
"You still call me Malfoy," Malfoy points out, "and if you don't mind, I'd prefer it if you—this coffee tastes weird." He frowns, completely distressed, as though the wrong coffee has just ruined his day. Harry thinks that maybe it has.
Still, if it weren’t for the appreciative look on Draco’s face, Harry would have backed out by now. He’s barely had time to worry about actually attending the Gala, what with all the work that needs to be done before-hand.
"I 'spect all kinds of horrible things these days. Safer that way," Harry says, reserve going out the window as he holds out his cup for more firewhiskey.
Draco grabs his hand and pulls him close. “If you’re going to look around my room,” He murmurs in Harry’s ear, leading him to the bed. “I think you’ll find that the most interesting part is over here."
Draco watches him quietly for a moment, before saying slowly, "So, if you have a pounding headache..."
Harry murmurs something along the lines of, "Yeah, well." He can see where this conversation is headed.
"You're welcome." Harry mumbles, yawning and moving closer to Draco, because he can. "Hermione would kill me for this but I don't think I can get up yet, so do you think—"
Harry is caught between pity and amusement as he makes his way over to where Malfoy is sitting on the floor. Showing him the various cuts on his own hands, he says, sheepishly, "That was Mrs. N. She can hear a silk scarf at fifty paces, or so it seems. That, along with a whole list of other things that upset her delicate sensibilities... I'm still finding them out myself. Hence the scratches."
He’s so lost in his thoughts that by the time he comes down the stairs and sees who exactly Hermione is conversing with, he’s completely dumbstruck.
Inexplicably, Harry feels hurt. He shouldn’t be surprised that Malfoy would stoop to that level, not really, and yet Harry had thought they were past that.
Harry opens the window and calls Malfoy’s owl, barely wincing as it lands on his shoulder and digs sharp talons into his skin. He’s used to claw-on-skin contact, after looking after Mrs. Norris for so long.
They make easy small talk for a few minutes, with how are you-s and nice to meet you-s, and then Harry, seized with a sudden idea, murmurs, "So how long have you known Draco for?"
They haven't discussed sexuality ever before, and Harry wonders if he's supposed to know about Draco's preferences. Although, truthfully, it's not exactly well-hidden. Even in Hogwarts, there had been signs—not rumours, of course, because too many people had been afraid of Malfoy back then to spread them—that Draco preferred men, like the way he leaned more into their touch and the way he looked slightly queasy when a variety of Slytherin girls—Pansy Parkinson in the lead—threw themselves at him. Harry’s suspicions had begun in sixth year, when he’d spent most of his time watching Malfoy’s every move, but he hadn’t given them much thought until Draco had showed up more recently at his house. Ever since then, he’d noticed that actually spending time with Draco wouldn’t leave anyone unsure as to which way he swung.
"I don't know,” Malfoy replies, making his way into the kitchen. “I'm surprised you haven't hexed me by now. I don't think you're really trying very hard.”
So Malfoy still couldn’t say Voldemort’s name. Interesting. Harry wonders if that’s at all related to the chip of guilt that seems sewed onto Malfoy’s shoulder, or if it’s because he’s still afraid.
Harry grabs the bottle of Ogden's and leaves the kitchen without saying anything else. In the room with his Park sky, he can hear Draco coming up the stairs to join him.
’d, or worse. He had taken pity on it. Slowly, Harry walks through the halls towards where he’s keeping the owl. He should have sent it, he thinks, and then Malfoy could have just kept mailing obnoxious letters instead of showing up here himself.
"Harry," He corrects. "Don't you think you'd know if I was a Legilimens? I'd be using it to find out all your secrets so I could make you leave me alone."
When Draco breaks into what might be a 'sorry for being a weirdo again' grin, Harry can't stop his answering smile. Oh, but he loves the way Draco looks when he's awkward like this. Or happy. Or content, enthusiastic, confused...
Harry snorts quietly, feeling the tension in the kitchen sliding away, as well as his anger. Slowly, he slides to the floor, drawing his knees up and looking at his scratched hands. "Did you just ask me if I died metaphorically? Only you, Malfoy."
He stops dead at the kitchen door watching Draco, who is sitting on his kitchen counter and repairing Harry’s cabinet, which has apparently talked so much that it’s actually fallen off.
"So, you don't really care about the poor little kiddies?" Harry asks, voice much more gentle than it had been. And much more gentle than he’d meant it to be. However, the thought that everyone has abandoned Malfoy and left him to fix problems that he didn’t really create in the first place is a sad one.
"You're almost outside. Just a couple of steps and you'd be in the grounds; it's probably safer out there than it is in here, listening to sinfully boring old people telling you how they made their fortune in the insurance business."
He flew out of his house before he had time for any real thought; whatever Hermione had shrieked behind him had been lost under the pounding of his heart.
Any retort Harry had in mind slips when he processes Malfoy’s comment. "How do you know that?" he demands.
"Er... too late in the year for hailstones?" Harry says instead, slamming the door shut and stifling a yawn. "And it's Harry, remember?"
A warm hand traces over the freezing skin on his back, and the feel of it makes Harry catch his breath. He tugs at Draco’s hair, running his hands through it again and again, unable to get enough of its softness.
Harry dares himself to hope that all the smiling faces mean he won't have to do anyone any favours tonight.
"You say that now..." Harry says, foggy mind trying hard to think back to the evening and failing to get there. A lot of bad stuff happened, that’s for sure. "But people took pictures of me," he whispers, trying to get Draco to understand.
Taking his fogging glasses off, Harry looks back at Malfoy, who is sitting close enough to not be too blurry. "Forgive me if I don't go into details, Malfoy, but don't worry, it was a one-time, circumstantial kind of thing. I'm not immortal, if that's what you're worried about."
"No more so than usual. Actually, a little more so than usual. I'm not depressed, you know. I'm not like this every day, as you may have noticed, seeing as you've spent more time with me this week than everyone else put together. It's a bad day today. It's a hard day. On this day, I spend more time than usual debating the wisdom of that decision... the rest of the time, I just live with the consequences."
And, really, Harry has no right to feel bad, because it’s his fault for staying locked up in his house. But Ron had left him during the Triwizard Tournament, and in the forest before the end of the war, and now…
Draco sits on the opposite side of the kitchen, chatting with the cupboards as Harry and Hermione have an in-depth discussion about house elf rights, something Hermione has been struggling for since she first joined the Ministry, without much avail.
"They used to," Harry admits, scrunching his nose at those memories. "They gave up." Then, without wanting to or meaning to, he changes the subject back to, "You don't really have dozens of friends, do you?"
Snorting, Draco says, "As if I'd worry about offending your delicate sensibilities. Seriously, coffee?"
"Great. Now they'll have something to talk about." Harry allows himself to scrub at his face with sweaty hands. "I'm going home."
As Harry busies himself making coffee, Draco begins an ongoing rant about his parents, house elf, and job. Harry finds himself listening.
Draco snorts, and Harry turns to shoot him a warning glance; there’s no point, though, because Draco knows how important it is for Harry to be here—he’s the one that dragged Harry here in the first place—and he isn’t going to ruin it. And Harry feels a burst of love and fondness and affection in his chest, and he feels calm when he looks back at Ron.
He catches Draco's eye over their respectable coffee cups, and something crackles between them. Draco's looking at him with something addictive in his eyes, something cool and hot at once, stronger and sweeter than Harry has ever seen before. He could kiss him now and Draco probably wouldn't even protest.
Harry hopes that she stays there. Or, better yet, that she comes out and attacks the man currently standing, unbelievably, in his entrance hall.
When he’d made to Apparate to Ron’s apartment, Harry hadn’t quite been able to do it. Instead, he’d taken them just over a mile away, and from that point Draco has been dragging him to their destination.
Harry wonders if Malfoy thinks he can really hide that smile behind his coffee cup. It’s too bright of a grin; it shows right through.
"This is the same person, mind you, who forces me into those terrible duck gloves. So you see what I have to put up with."
Harry hides a smile with his hands and says, "You're right, that is weird. And I can't believe I just said you were right. And... what? My cupboard's been talking to you? My cupboard's been telling tales on me to you?"
"Harry..." She begins, then shakes her head again, apparently at a loss for words. "Harry, you are such an idiot."
"All this time you've been trying to convince me you're not insane," Draco grumbles, and Harry smirks.
"Right. Well, I left some bags by the door, so..." she says, and Harry wonders what the fuck it is about today that's making people unable to finish their sentences.
"I know about Sirius Black," Malfoy says quietly, and Harry’s heart stops for a moment. His head shoots up and he watches Malfoy suspiciously.
Wrinkling his nose, Malfoy replies, "President Cholmondely, yes. She's got her tiny, black little heart set on you."
"We're not talking... metaphorically here, are we, Potter?" Draco asks, keeping the eye contact but looking nervous. "Because if we are, I think I'll..." He doesn’t finish the sentence.
"Did I...? Oh. No, I just put some wards on the... er..." Draco frowns, and Harry frowns back. Draco shouldn't look sad. That shouldn't be allowed. "Anyway, don't you want to be able to use it again? Now you know you can?"
Draco doesn’t even flinch at the name, and that’s how Harry knows the situation is very bad, indeed.
Draco had brought him some French pastries the other day, in an effort to 'show you, Potter, exactly what you are missing while you're kept up in this house all day.' Harry saw through him, and easily. Malfoy wasn't half as mean or selfish as he wanted people to believe.
“Here,” Harry says, and in response to Malfoy’s raised eyebrow, “It’s the Muggle coffee shop I get this stuff from,” he gestures to his now-empty cup. “You said you wanted to know what kind. Now you do. Get out, Malfoy. I’m not going to the Gala.”
The cupboard flaps six times in quick succession, and Harry scowls. "Yes, I'm aware of that, thank you."
Harry frowns. That last thought in his head had sounded suspiciously like something Draco would say.
Harry doesn’t realise that his wrists have been released until he notices Draco’s hand slipping under his own pajama bottoms, the other one wrapping around Harry’s cock. Draco bringing himself off with Harry’s cock in his mouth is the hottest thing he’s ever seen. His hips snap upwards without his consent, and Draco takes his quickened thrusts with a hum of appreciation.
He walks up to his attic, settles under the Park sky, and sits on the floor unmoving until Tempus lets him know it’s gone midnight.
"I died," Harry says without meaning to, voice gravelly. Anxiously, he runs his hands through his hair. No one knows that. Not even Hermione knows that.
Clicking his tongue, Harry gets to his feet as quickly as his lethargic body will carry him. "I'm making coffee."
They walk into the house, Draco following closely behind Harry as they make their way to the Park. By the time they've reached it, Mrs. Norris has struck again. Draco is still grumbling about it when they enter the room.
standing in my kitchen three days in a row?" Harry asks, stepping aside to let Malfoy into his house. It’s not like he has much of a choice.
"You look at me a lot," Harry informs him, and he means it to come out as a question, but instead it sounds like a statement. He stares into Draco's perfect perfect eyes and those eyes stare back and Harry wants to grab him and hold on forever.
Harry watches Draco read the letter, studying his shoulders and jawline as Esme nips at his ears. He finds himself staring idly at Draco's left arm as it holds the letter, wondering about the Mark that is no doubt hidden underneath Draco's clothing. Inexplicably, Harry wants to lift Draco’s sweater off of him and see it; in fact, he wants to take
"I'm making you breakfast," Harry says, suddenly feeling strange about it. It wasn’t that big of a deal, surely?
Harry’s mouth twitches, and he feels light with hope. "So the point is, Draco, even though I'm completely useless at this, I think you're the something and I'd like it back, please. And walking up your drive was one of the scariest things I've ever done, so the least you can do is let me in for a bit," he finishes, barely breathing.
Two weeks later, Hermione sits in Harry's kitchen, filling him in on how things are between Ginny and Neville. Harry tries not to let his mind wander toward Draco Malfoy. He's received four more letters from him, though Harry stopped reading them after the first one. Instead, he'd let them stack up in his kitchen, untouched, until he couldn't stand to look at them anymore. He'd mailed them all back in what he hoped would be a clear gesture of 'stay the fuck away from me.'
“There is a new law being passed,” Hermione continues, sounding genuinely friendly, “Regarding the amount of time house elves have to work, in proportion to the amount of time they ever have off. The law is attempting to help give elves more free time, and I’m wondering—to help strengthen my argument, of course—in your experience, what are common house elf hobbies?”
Surprised by Malfoy’s actual sense of humour, Harry finds his lips quirking and says, "Yeah, I'll sleep tonight now, Malfoy."
"Oh." Harry replies, surprised. He turns his head, watching Draco intently. The sunlight coming from the ceiling makes his blond hair glisten like gold, and Harry fights the urge to reach for it, to caress it. To kiss it. "Why?"
“I’ll come in,” Harry says, “And I’ll explain why Draco is here. But you go, first. I’d like to know why I haven’t even heard from you in ages.”
He thinks about Hagrid, of the first day they'd ever met, of finding out that he's a wizard. He thinks of laying limp in Hagrid's arms as the half-giant cried big, fat tears over Harry’s supposedly dead body on the walk out of the forest.
Draco doesn't leave then, but he does give Harry an almost twisted smile, a smile that makes Harry long for the nice, easy ones he used to get. And then makes him clench his fists even harder.
"Whether to stay there... to stay dead... or to go back and try to save more people." Saying it out loud isn’t as scary as Harry had once thought it would be.
Growing angrier by the second, Harry almost shouts, "This is my house! Or had you forgotten?” He looks around at Malfoy’s expensive clothes, strewn across his kitchen table and chairs, “You certainly seem to have made yourself at home."
"I'll be fine, too. The Floo connection's all set up, you're going to be at the other side of it, my dress robes are washed and pressed and Mrs. Norris is probably going to wreck the place while I'm away," Harry sighs, ticking off the points on his fingers. He isn’t looking forward to the Gala, not a bit, and every time he thinks about it, the ball of apprehension in his chest grows.
"You're a gonefore conclusion," Harry mutters, choking on more Ogden's. God, he never drinks. Now he remembers why: it burns.
He looks out the door at the house, confirming that, indeed, it is a dark fuchsia. When he turns back around, Draco looks thoroughly distressed.
Harry doesn’t realise that he’s holding his breath until Draco clears his throat beside him. He attempts a deep breath; it comes out sharp and jagged.
"Fine, so I don't!" Malfoy practically shouts. "How is anyone supposed to help you if you don't fucking tell them? How do you expect me to—"
"You do that." Malfoy says, bones cracking as he pushes off the ground to get up. It's very interesting, Harry decides, seeing Malfoy less than graceful. He thinks that maybe he likes the change. It reminds him less of school-Malfoy.
Harry kisses him back, running a hand over Draco’s arm. “Good. We’re still having a lot of sex before I go back outside.”
Harry glances over at her; Hermione looks caught between exasperation and bemusement. “You’re acting a bit weird today, Hermione, did you know that?”
“Who—I mean, did you want, or should I...?” Harry stops himself and rearranges his thoughts, attempting to sound slightly more articulate, lest Draco mock him. What he settles on is: “I’ve never had sex with a man. Like I said before. So I don’t...”
It's out of his mouth before Harry knows what he's saying, but, like most of his impulsive escapades, he doesn’t do much to take it back. Instead, he lifts his chin towards the ceiling, amused as he feels Draco’s shock reverberate around the room.
Hermione shrugs. “Pot, kettle. Anyway, Harry… it’s probably completely useless to say, but if you were to just go to the actual
“Yes, you do. Merlin’s sake, you have before, and it’s nothing if not irritating for me. Just…” Draco gets the weird expression on his face again, somewhere between pity, concern, annoyance, and something distinctly
Sighing, Harry returns to pondering the grounds. He doesn't need to think about that now. He's got enough problems being here as it is.
"I wanted to tell you... something,” Harry says, and suddenly, he isn’t sure of any of this. He’d come all this way, ran all the way up the huge drive at Malfoy Manor, and now, standing inches from the safety of the indoors, he’s more nervous than he’s been all year.
At this thought, Harry deepens his glare. "You're a horrible singer. What do you want, apart from disturbing my neighbours?"
"Please tell me you're not asking me to call you by your first name," Malfoy says, eyebrows raised, taking a cup of coffee from Harry and placing it on the center of his hand. "Because that's all kinds of weird."
Harry wonders if, had he chosen to ignore the pleas of people in the living world needing his help, and taken Dumbledore's hand to the realm of the dead back at King's Cross, his world would be calming silence, or something else entirely. He wonders if, were the former true, it would be worth leaving Voldemort for others to deal with over.
Draco ignores him in favour of placing his steaming coffee cup in the center of his palm and burying his nose further in the magazine.
A laugh catches in Harry’s throat, and Malfoy looks up, startled. Clear eyes catch on his, and Harry’s heart skips slightly—though, really, it’s been erratic since he’d first admitted his death. "You know, Malfoy, you can be quite funny when you want to. Shame you have no idea when's an appropriate time for it."
When he stands in front of hundreds of people and gives his speech, he isn't paying much attention to any of the facts or statistics he's reading off. He'd spent a good deal of his time lately writing the speech; partly because he had little else go do besides annoy Draco, but mostly because he knows that this is important to him, and doesn't want to fuck it up by making his speech a quick: "Actually, I couldn't give a crap less about any of this; the little floating lights in here, though, were a nice touch."
Harry feels a tug at his belt loops and realises that his staring might be a little weird. “Sorry,” he says breathlessly. "I wanted to see you," he admits, finally allowing himself to move away the restricting pajamas and touch the hot, hard flesh jutting out from blond curls. It’s so different than the way a girl feels, new and exciting and amazingly
As much as Harry wants to leave, he finds that, once standing in the entrance hall, he rather likes it here. Not here as in 'at the W.O.T. Gala,' but here as in, 'right in front of the door at Malfoy Manor.' It’s quite beautiful. Harry's eyes scan the ground before him like a starving man, but he doesn't step outside.
"Hang on, so, your parents left you on your own and buggered off to another country... and yet you're putting in all of this effort to fix everything for them? Why?"
Comfortable silence falls, and Harry turns back to look at the sun going down over the Malfoy property.
Malfoy Manor, Harry notes quickly, is really quite beautiful when it's not invaded by giant snakes and men with their souls in pieces. The ballroom—different from the one he had been dragged to two years ago when he'd been caught with Ron and Hermione is the forest, Harry is thankful to see—is sparkling. Glistening lights decorate the room, making everything glow in a light haze. Good taste hangs from every surface, along with velvet and wealth and silver. The people here look happy and content, and not like they care very much for any War Orphans, but then, Harry isn't here for the good of the children, either.
What he does feel is an irrational pang of guilt. It's not as if Draco cares much anyway, though, right? Not as if he plans on doing anything other than leaving in a few moments and never coming here again?
Harry snorts, "Yeah right, Malfoy. That might be more believable if you weren't spending all of your precious time getting attacked by my cat.”
Shaking his head slightly, Harry rubs his eyes. Of course he’s aware of that. And even though Harry knows that if he truly didn’t want to tell it, Malfoy wouldn’t have gotten this out of him on his dying day, he replies "I didn't plan on confessing anything, Malfoy. You irritated it out of me."
"If it's self-inflicted then I'm tempted to continue yelling," she says, louder than necessary. Harry scowls.
"Well, Esme," Harry whispers to the owl, petting his feathers as Esme nips at Harry’s finger, "I suppose this is the last time I’ll see you."
He picks up the book he’d been reading before Hermione’s arrival—and, consequently, all night before that. He hadn’t been able to sleep. Not when Remus still haunts his dreams, and Tonks... Sirius... Cedric...
“It’s not?” Harry doesn’t understand; of course it’s important, if Draco heard all those horrible things he said.
“I’ve always been the logical one,” Draco informs him. “I’m the one that actually goes outside, remember?” Pursing his lips, he adds softly, “And I’ve had enough friends over the years that stopped caring when things got difficult.”
Conflicting emotions surge through Harry, and he squeezes his eyes shut, hard. Breathes out through his nose. Props his feet up on the kitchen chair, and tries not to throttle Draco Malfoy.
“You’re scared to see a Weasley,” Draco concludes, and in contrast to his condescending words, a warm hand reaches out to grasp Harry’s.
Looking less angry and more unsure, Draco pulls his bathrobe around his chest. Which is a shame, because it had been dangerously close to opening and revealing more of Draco than Harry’s ever seen. "Why?"
"I didn't steal him, Malfoy," Harry says, sighing. And, really, he hadn’t meant to; Harry just assumed that the poor owl was beaten under the company of Malfoy, or
"I certainly do not!" Malfoy replies, indignant, but Harry has his doubts. “And anyway, this isn't about owls."
soft and musky and clean, with hints of spicy scents that he must put in his hair and wash his body with—soaping long fingers down delicate, pale skin in the bath, massaging it into his shoulders and chest and abdomen, slowly sliding his hands lower, lower, lower until he finally reaches light-coloured curls of pubic hair…
"Look,” Draco begins, and Harry tries his hardest not to repeatedly slam his head against the table. That’s Malfoy’s listen-to-me-now-or-I’ll-bother-you-about-it-for-the-rest-of-your-life voice, the same one he uses when speaking about the Gala. “I can no longer be arsed pretending that there's nothing different about today. Two years ago, a couple of great things happened, and a lot of fucking awful, senseless things happened. I know that, Harry. You know that. And I'm just confused about why your so-called friends aren't here with you, because you're not fine," Draco says, tone soft, concerned. Harry feels like crying. "Or are you just pulling your self-sacrificing hero act?"
Harry goes the bed the moment Draco leaves, and spends the next ten hours in the most dream-free and easy sleep he’s had in longer than he cares to remember.
Draco nods and leans against the counter. Harry feels grey eyes on him the entire time he's making the coffee. It makes him even more anxious, and after the day he's had, that's a difficult feat.
"You know what, Malfoy?” Harry says, rubbing at his face again. “Let's talk about the letters. You can say your piece, and then you can take your owl, and your personality, and leave me alone.”
"On the plus side, I didn't... die," Harry says, inspecting his empty cup and then sinking back onto his elbows on the carpet.
"I hate giving speeches," Harry murmurs, tapping his fingers absently under Draco's, still together on the carpet. He spends a few moments thinking more about it, but knows that in the end, he'll go. Of course he'll go. Draco needs him there. "Okay. But that's it. I'm not staying for the whole thing. And I hate Flooing, but... that's what we're going to have to do."
“All right. And I'm guessing you're fully aware of the irony of confessing all of this to one of those awful people who wants something from you... something that you're qualified to give because of everything that happened two years ago today?"
Draco moves in his peripheral vision, and Harry turns immediately to look at him. Janice has just left, and Draco is looking back at Harry with a smile on his face. Harry's lips quirk.
“Harry,” Hermione says after a moment of thoughtfully narrowed eyes, “You’ve been smiling so much today.”
“That’s why you always looked starved, then?” Harry wonders. “I’m sure you could buy a better house elf if you wanted.”
"That doesn't sound very Malfoy," Harry mutters, shifting so that he can see Draco’s face and moving dark fringe out of his eyes.
"That'll be your owl," Harry reluctantly withdraws his hand from Draco's and walks over to the window. "The one with the gender issues."
Harry leans back to look at the moving clouds, satisfied, but he can feel Hermione’s sharp gaze still on him. He tries to pretend it doesn’t make him uncomfortable.
"You're making no sense," Draco tells him, and Harry has to take a moment to think back to what he said before that. Something about conclusions.
Neither of them is able to move; Harry lies, eyes closed, sprawled out on the stairs; the marble hurting his back is negligible. Draco stays kneeling in front of him for a few minutes, panting, resting his head against Harry’s bent knees.
"What?" Malfoy asks, sounding agitated, and Harry can see why, considering the hailstorm that has apparently been falling on Malfoy while Harry was upstairs. He feels slightly guilty.
Instead, Harry thinks about what it will be like seeing Draco again. In his mind, a scene plays out where they crash mouths the second they see each other, and spend the rest of the day having sex on various surfaces.
"No. Hermione's tried enough times, believe me,” Harry smiles at a memory of her doing just that and snorts, “Typical that you should be the only other person who can understand it, now I'll never get rid of you."
"Well," Malfoy begins, and Harry knows he’s in for a lot of questioning. The thought doesn’t bother him as much as it did a few minutes ago; he’s too tired to care anymore, and he supposes the cat’s out of the bag, anyway.
just... maybe not yet. I'm still getting used to all the other new things in my life right now. Like going outside. You can teach me later, or… yeah. ” Harry reaches up to jostle his hair, feeling awkward.
"Thought you weren't keeping score," Draco looks down at his hands, and murmurs this so quietly Harry almost thinks he heard wrong. He knows that he didn’t, though, and Malfoy is right: it isn’t fair for him to bring that up now, not years later when it doesn’t matter and when Malfoy has been doing everything possible to take it back.
When Malfoy flashes him a huge grin for no reason at all, Harry’s heart skips a little. For no reason at all.
"So, we're agreed." Harry says, nodding, and walks out of the room, knowing Draco will follow, and, this time, wanting him to.
Harry wonders what Ron and Hermione are doing right now. Sighing, he murmurs, "I'm not your friend, Malfoy,”
His mind wonders, instead, to the visit with Hermione. Ginny is happy with Neville, then. Harry knows he should feel something about that, either joy or content or anger or
"You look fed up," Harry observes, examining Draco's tired face and wary expression. It's been a long night. "Everyone cleared off?"
“It isn’t easy for any of us to be here, all right? Especially not now. These past few days you’ve been in such a mood, even Ginny said you were a bit off.” Harry clenches his teeth. “Look, I’m sorry. I’ll talk to Ron. He has been busy with work, you know, it’s not only that he doesn’t want to come here.”
“Shut the fuck up,” Harry growls, knowing that he shouldn’t take his anger out on Malfoy and doing it anyway.
"He's quite happy about it, too," Janice informs him, eyes watching Harry expectedly. "He felt terrible about that fight you two got into."
Harry Apparates outside Malfoy Manor, and the distorted feeling from that, in conjunction with the pouring rain, makes him stumble and fall over.
Heart beating faster at the admission, Harry throws a pillow. Smiling wickedly, Draco reads the article.
"Draco, whatever you're freaking out about, just stop it," Harry advises, stifling a yawn. "It's all going to be fine. You're too anal for it not to be fine." Harry quells the rather juvenile supply of jokes about Draco and anal that come to mind.
Hermione shows up again the next day, this time earlier and in time to catch Draco. If Harry didn’t know better, he’d think she was keeping an eye on him.
