"Pansy Blaise as much as I adore you, shut up. Theo don't try to hide anything and tell me what happened?"
"Well alright he wouldn't want us to tear up, would he?"
So yes he was sometimes caught by Pansy staring at Potter during breakfast or by Blaise during dinner. Sometimes Theo would tell him not to stare during a friendly quidditch match or Millie would tell him to complete his homework instead of staring.
'SIR YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATLY REPORT TO THE WHAREHOUSE WHERE WE WERE INVESTIGATING THE TRAFFICKERS! SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED!'
"Don't worry Harry I will arrange everything. And thank you for loving my son so much. I wish you both happiness."
"You already know the answer Ron!"
This is a recollection of the times Harry found the notes and his reactions to it. Most of the time he would find them when he returns late from auror work and Draco has fallen asleep.
"Well they actually thought their middle fingers were the ring fingers and when I tried to tell them they told me that there were many tattoo shops around so well...I did their tattoos according to their wishes."
As the lights appeared he could feel the warmth hitting his face. All the fairy lights were on making the alleyway look not exactly bright but warm and there was a band playing on the stage and as he looked at the people who were hanging out on the streets, it looked like they were having the times of their life. Harry found himself smiling even though he had been so bitter before but then again it wouldn't hurt to smile.
"Draco! "
Theo turned back and spoke at the same time as Harry.
"Well since it's my shop I'm pretty sure I can. "
"I know Potter but it was the people who I looked up to and well the way I talked about them when I was little was truly wrong of me. "
"Yes dragon. "
And then when she found him in his rooms with the colour scattered all over she was not surprised. But as she got a closer look apparently there was a pattern. The first part was only blue, the second red and the third yellow. It seemed like her son had quite the eye for colouring.
Few hours earlier
"Well there aren't any ideas coming right now so let's get on with the next thing Nott."
"Oh! You know, stalking you, meeting my friends for pub night and the works. What about you?"
"Well I am mad obviously but that is for another time."
"News travels fast mate."
"It's all in place."
"What?!"
Taking out the note from the drawer Harry traced over the dragon symbol with his finger. 'Is this your work Malfoy?'
All over the room costumes were floating but a few of them were in the middle of the room, looking like they wanted to be seen. And something drew him to them as he slowly walked over.
"Scared Potter? "
They went to the group and met with a loud chorus of hellos directed to Neville while worry laced Theo's face and Draco knew what was coming.
"You know what I'm going to take the angel with me and get him a few things while you pick up your jaw from the floor. "
Draco surprised almost fell if his stool before he balanced himself. Looking around he noticed Harry on his knee with a smile on his face. Harry stared at him with the smile growing as he took out the box. He could notice Draco face warming up and a nervous look which was covered by a happier one. As he opened the box he thought this isn't as grand as Draco's.
So with a sigh of relief he waved his hand (he had mastered it wandlessly after using it a thousand times) and a small orb of light formed. The orb started moving and he started following it. After following the orb for a while he started recognising the route and didn't know what to expect. He was heading for the Come and Go room.
"Ma.. Draco? "
"Oh don't act so innocent, Ron already told me how your week was going!"
Darling,
"Oh no! Neville actually is acquainted with Theodore Nott because of which I had to once accompany him. And Parkinson kept on calling me a lion and how foolishly brave I was to always have someone protect others from danger."
"5 hours but we need to wrap it up in 1."
At Ron and Hermione's house he cheerfully ate the meal ignoring the looks they were giving him. His pocket somehow felt warm with the note in it and he was itching to take it out. But he wanted to wait for the perfect moment that was in 3....2.....1...
"Here Sir."
Nathan looked as if he was on the verge of tears and was mumbling something when Theo came and hugged him. Deciding this was a personal moment for them Harry went to Ron to wake him up. After a few nudges Ron was awake enough to put an arm around Harry so that he could be dragged out of the bar. Trying to make sure his mate doesn't slip and fall Harry takes out a few galleons to pay for Ron's drink.
"It's just the beginning Potter and I'm glad you joined us."<3
"I.. I think you like me! "
"That he was going to disappear."
"Let's not get cocky, we still have a lot of things to do."
"Whatever you say captain!"
"Because I have been looking for him for 3 years!"
"Just came from threatening one of the workers."
"Yeah."
Harry smiled at her and sat down at an table that had a clear view of the place. He was now observing the barista who was talking about something with the girl- who Harry recalled was Pan. There was something familiar about the both of them. The bob black hair reminded him of someone but he just couldn't place whom.
"I need to agree with Draco here Theo. So sweetie are we correct?"
"Why?!"
"Yeah, so what should we do?"
"Also we need to go costume shopping. "
"Sure sir, you can go ahead and sit somewhere and he will bring your order right up."
"The school would be destroyed if our year pulled pranks together."
"Without fail! "
"If you paid attention you would know! "
And the way Harry blushed while softly punching was so adorable that he couldn't help but laugh.
The blonde's smell had enveloped and he couldn't help take in another whiff which made the blonde groan a little. Focusing back on the game to control himself he turned towards Hermione.
"Hey Wesley, it's been a while."
"You are not to follow everything he does Draco. Promise me you won't ever use it again."
"Well let's make sure we don't mess up for the sake of our friend."
He had a bit of trouble at first since he wasn't use to wearing these kinds of clothing but after a bit of trial and error he was done. He felt that he looked quite alright and wondered how Draco knew he liked this one the best. After spacing out for a while he went back to the guest entering and then giving a twirl for Pansy.
"Go ahead Harry I am listening."
"Everyone did."
"Nott I swear on Merlin if in all the time I was asleep you both haven't gone out yet, I will start ripping Nathan's hair off."
So with a soft smile she lifted him up and sat down on a nearby sofa. Balancing him on her lap she took those small hands which were so small and fragile and slowing started wiping the colours with a wet cloth. At the touch of the wet cloth he giggled with twinkling silver eyes and Narcissa stared with aww at her beautiful son and made a promise that she'll do anything to protect him, no matter what.
"Whatever. Harry has some questions for you."
"Honestly Blaise you should know you're talking about our Darling Pansy."
The two blondes started laughing while Theo groaned and Ginny patted his shoulder. Nathan looked around him and warmth from the group enveloped him. He wished everyday was like this but he knew reality would never let him escape. But he was going to savour each and every moment he had with them because the sacrifices were worth it! All of sudden someone kicked open the doors and they all turned back to see Pansy and Blaise with Cheshire Cat's grin on their faces.
"Hermione you did what?"
"You want us to go to a bar at 10 in the morning?"
Draco’s face had started reddening but Harry listened to him and looked down to see the pair of narcissus wilting. Surprised he looked up to see Draco smirking at him but his expression held no malice.
"It can't be you! "
"I... Y... Yes alright got it! "
"Well so what three things do you want me to do? "
"You shouldn't call them that."
And this time when Malfoy held out his hands Harry gladly accepted them. <3
"Yes love? "
"Uhhhh...I wouldn't say skip..."
"Yeah. Potter we all saw how close you both became in 8th year and I am truly sorry that you both couldn't talk before he went away but you should know that when the circumstances had changed he told me to let you know that he has his eyes on you."
He felt him relax more and started leaving small kisses on his neck and groaned when he heard ths blonde moan. He turned and looked at the still huddled group and decided he can't control himself anymore.
"Alright! Call available aurors and tell them to meet us there in five minutes."
"Of course, it was like a duel to get your hair to look like this!"
“Hello there, my name is Harry. Would you like to be friends?” Harry knew this was impulsive, but he knew the blonde had changed. He hadn’t been paying attention to him like before but could still see as clear as day how much had Mal...Draco changed. He just hoped the Slytherin would shake his sweaty hands now.
"Shut up Draco! And Harry I can't believe you didn't use the charm! "
He gave the raven hair another smile before he again turned to his ring and he suddenly felt his stomach drop. His ring had turned pink! He quickly turned to the boy who was busy staring at his shoes. And on his stick like fingers Draco noticed it had turned pink too! But the boy seemed clueless about it...oh he was muggleborn. He was still in shock when his mother had came and taken him back.
“Potter stop thinking so loudly!”
"Where is everyone else?"
"What? How did you know about my map? "
Hermione and Theodore Nott had became great friends and we’re responsible for all the research. Blaise and Ron played chess at least once a week and had the best inside information since Ron had access to loads of Auror files and Blaise knew the financial status of everyone since he worked at Gringotts. Pansy had loads of foreign connections ready to assist them at any moment. And Draco well...Harry just could not stop finding new talents about him in every mission.
"As ridiculous as this is Potter you know we would be great together!! Imagine if you and your trio would join our group! We could literally change Wizarding England! Maybe even whole of Europe! Our goals are the same and if were to work together it really...."
So he pulled Draco into a kiss and he felt Draco murmur against his lips, 'finally mine's and couldn't help but smiling before apparating away in the middle of the club, not giving a damn because he had waited to long to be finally with his dragon. <3
"OMG THEO I NEED DETAILS!"
"I intended to, also I think they both will need a bit of help. "
"Let's go! "
"Wait what...aren't you going to reject me?"
"Goodnight."<3
"Well you can go ahead with the speech...now."
"Well she was suggesting me costume ideas and I was just rejecting them. And oh! Also we are going to go clubbing after 9 and I think that is after Teddy's bedtime so you need to come. "
After sometime he was finally away from the crowd and noise and with a look of his surrounding he took off his cloak. He shivered a bit from the recent cold wind and started on a walk to the forest.
"Potter? "
And Harry felt his heart skip a beat at the word 'home'.
"Umm could you let me go? "
"When was it?"
"I don't think you understand, but he doesn't want you! He is mine! "
And Draco fell in love again watching Harry lifting up a giggling Teddy and he was sure anyone who would think of hurting them would wish they hadn't.
After that he asked Blaise whether their weaponry was up to date and Blaise simply smirked at that. He informed that they could take over any magical or muggle place with the arsenal they had though he was sad that he couldn't show them off as much as he wanted to. Draco groaned at that and tried to throw some ice cubes at him(which he dodged gracefully but while doing so he fell from the chair. No one laughed, I am telling the truth! *wink*).
"Honestly Potter what's this about?"
"Sod off Malfoy! "
"But..."
"Ohh uhhhmm what?"
"Really?"
"Tell you what?"
"Oh! "
"That means you belong to me right? "
"Don't worry Potter, there nothing dangerous here. "
"No."
"What are you doing outside?"
"Well follow me. "
Harry knew it was a statement and not a question. Ever since they knew that this was it for them, Draco had gone to Hermione to learn all the basic diagnostics spells to check if Harry was even slightly hurt. And ever since he mastered it, Draco would without fail cast it(wandlessly now after years of practice) every time he returned home and Harry would understood how loved he was every time he did.
"Good morning mister Potter."
Harry had decided that he would think later about how the pair of narcissus were blooming before.
"Wait what are you talking about?"
“Malfoy… you know I wouldn’t hit you for no good reason, right?”
"Why can't you share?"
In front of them was a huge patch which just had a few pumpkins left but all of them were so huge! Potter was about to go when he caught Potter's hand.
"What? "
"Well..alright let's get ourselves a drink!"
"We have been calling you for the last five minutes! Stop staring at Malfoy and answer Seamus alreadyy."
"Eyes on me."
"Oh sorry Pansy. "
"Are you sure?"
"So Teddy dear show your outfit to Potter. "
"Oh c'mon don't be like that, darling. Loosen up a bit."
So without saying anything and making sure Draco didn't notice him he went down on one knee. All their moments together suddenly felt flashing before his eyes. Clearing his thoughts and replacing them by his love's smiling face he coughed loudly.
“Yeah?”
"What did you say Dray?"
"Sorry if it sounded creepy."
"Sir! The warehouse we were keeping an eye on for the traffickers, has shown a lot of movement. Most of them are muggles like usual but it seemed like the leader has finally appeared."
"Alright Harry what is it?"
"I do but we aren't tying them up this time."
"Yes! "
"Oh yeah."
Draco had been staring at him with a look of bewilderment and then looking like he made the most important decision of his life he slipped his warm soft hand into Harry’s and shook it gently.
"It was all Blaise-"
"Pansy is my hair glowing? "
"Frankly I don't see how that's a problem."
“Potter…. I…”
“Just look down Potter.”
"Hmmm well nobody cares Potter I'm 18 so being an adult means handling all the shit that happens to me. "
And the voice made Harry's knees go weak so he allowed Draco to drag him to the dancefloor. He didn't wanted to disappoint Draco but he couldn't dance to save his life. So he just slowly moved his feet from side to side hoping Draco wouldn't notice. But Draco obviously did notice because the only thing he had his eyes on was Harry.
"So what do we have?"
"I know. But you need to be more careful Neville. What if the next time it happens and none of us are here or you can't escape."
"Bottoms up!"
"You could always stay back to laze around with me Harry."
"Not so tough are you now Liz?"
He saw Draco finally stop laughing as Pansy handed him the keys and said 'Goodnight boss'?? Still amused Draco got up and stood in front of him and waited for him to get up. After he finally did he pulled Harry in for a tight hug which Harry returned.
Draco had tried some of the muggle candies and chocolate but he still felt the ones his mother gave him were better. Harry argued that most of the candies were for Halloween so he actually couldn't judge muggle sweets by eating only that. So they both agreed to disagree.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry Draco. "
It was until his mother tucked him into bed that he burst out crying. Surprised his mother started wiping his tears and hugging him.
"Thank you but now the corset and the cape. "
The situations were polar opposite. But the way they both felt was the same. The way Harry missed his parents on days like Christmas and the way Draco was still avoiding his mother and had only sent a set of scarf and gloves to France was quite similar. The little gestures Draco did when he needed comfort made his heart swoon.
"Well first of all, I'm the person who called you here and secondly I have injections filled with poison behind each of your henchmen and well with a snap of my finger they'll collapse."
"But hngnh father does!"
"Hmmm you are looking so good in that, love."
Draco could make wizard robes look good but the way he wore muggle clothes almost made it illegal. He was wearing jeans just tight enough so that it doesn't cross a line but tight  enough to make Harry brain stop working. And Draco's lips looked so soft that Harry almost couldn't control himself.
"If that is all you can leave."
"Morning love. "
"Then accept the kiss you git! "
"Alright...."
"That late? "
"Yeah"
“Hmmmm.... I actually don't know.”
"Good evening, Potter."
"So you are fine with me eh? "
“Since the time I heard your loud footsteps.”
When he opened his eyes the sky had turned darker and he had a blanket on him with wet tears on his face. He was against a tree and when he checked the time it was a bit over an hour since the time he arrived. Quickly getting up and shrinking the mysterious blanket he heads back to them which was not that far away. And his hand had reached for his wand when he saw light gleaming on the other side.
After standing in the front for a while he walked in the same direction as Ron had before and soon found Theo's bar and a  slight drunk Ron. Laughing at his mate's state he hoped on one of the bar stools and waited for Theo to turn back.
"Did you just..alright forget that, well have you spotted him even once after all that?"
"Why yes Potter and were you eavesdropping? "
"Yes! With big black crows and spiders! "
And he wanted to stop his blush from spreading as Pansy noticed his palms and started giggling.
"Well forget that! Now your face, I need you to listen to each and every one of my instructions, okay? "
"Rough day?"
“Yeah.”
"Yes, yes! "
Draco's face brightened up as he saw everyone settle down with small smiles on their face. Taking in a deep breath he started their meeting! <3
"Draco we are already an hour la..."
"Were you eavesdropping again? "
"The wine Ron took from me for your house party or something. Wait, what did you think I was talking about?"
"What just happened? "
"The next time you do that, you won't be able to find your wand cause it will be so far up your arse!"
"So honey bun what were you both talking about? "
"Don't worry, we'll eat them later. "
"What?"
Just then he felt a small tingle on his left hand's palm. On the corner a small owl appeared. It looked so small but it's details were beautiful. As he stared at the mark he started loving it unlike his other mark. He couldn't wait to meet his partner. But how exactly was he going to find them?
"Oho! You like me now huh Harry? "
"Yea, so umm do you like me? "
But then he remembered that Teddy was around. So with a lot of effort he gave a quick cough before stuttering out, "Whenever you want to go? " Draco smiled at him and told him to get ready in an hour and bring Teddy along cause he needs to head back to freshen up. Harry didn't even want to think what 'freshen up' meant as he went to look for Teddy.
Seriously though Harry had been able to witness some of the times their crew- the Sinners had to threaten someone. They would tie up their target, get them a bit flustered and irritated and then Malfoy would enter wearing one of his fitting muggle suits which most of the time was black silk and just whisper something in their ear. Within minutes the target would confess to their crime and then would end up in a cell back at his department.
Potter let go of his hands as if it was on fire and Draco already missed the warmth.
“What? You were awake the whole time?”
"Yes Hawwy you need to listen to Uncle Dwaco! "
"I... Wait a small white tail, white ears and a fluffy white onesie... You are a snow rabbit! "
"Spidews? "
"Then what happened?"
Pansy pointed to a corner before disappearing into the crowd. Harry was about to follow him but he felt those warm arms holding him again.
Harry took off the note from the box and opened it. Inside was a soft toy in the shape of a snitch and a soft sweatshirt. On it was written, 'He is my snitch' with an arrow. With a smile he quickly wore it to join his love who had already fallen asleep. He went inside the duvet and pulled his sleeping dragon closer. And when he was woken up by soft kisses he noticed his love was wearing the other sweatshirt with 'He is my seeker' on it. They didn't leave until the snitch was found.
Draco got up and sat in Harry's lap. He shifted a bit to make himself comfortable which in turn made Harry uncomfortable. Hesitantly he placed his arm around his torso and shivered a bit when the snake opened his eyes and stared at him. He placed his head on Draco's shoulder since the blonde was taller than him which basically made it difficult for him to see others.
"Well I think I do because you look like you will faint any moment."
"Yea but..I.. Well it's just been 3 years already."
But around the age of seven his father thought it wasn't fit for a Malfoy to spend all his time drawing. So he removed the teacher and took away all of art supplies. That was one of the most traumatic thing that ever happened to him.
When Harry had asked why they didn't go there anymore Draco face had darkened as he told him how a few years back when he had gone searching for it, a modern Starbucks was in it's place. Harry had pulled close to comfort him and had forgotten about it...until now.
"I don't know why I am telling you all this but I'm sick of the way the Wizarding World runs. I mean honestly it makes me nauseous thinking about it!"
With that he opened the door keeping in mind the bright almost blinding smile Draco had on him. The cottage looked cozy and warm. Harry pulled them to a corner which took Draco by surprise and had made him teary eyes. He pulled Harry in for a tight hug and held him for what felt like an eternity repeating thank yous and I love yous which filled Harry with warmth.
"Hello!"
Yes the git had started using first names. "Potter."
Potter smiled shyly before pulling him for a kiss. And it was everything that he had ever wanted. It was soft, sweet and so full of love. Draco felt he was the luckiest guy at that moment. And parted, looked at each other with shiny eyes before one of them pulled in the other for another kiss. They exchanged a few more kisses before they were breathless.
It took him a moment to collect himself and then he got up with a familiar smirk on his face. With a few graceful steps avoiding bumping into anyone he stood a few feets away from Potter's table.
"But I am, anyways the pumpkin patch is right there! "
"Ummm I would like a slice of apple pie and some coffee."
Harry,
"Wha...what?"
Draco again.
"What was that harry?"
As he walked through the crowd he was a bit afraid of people recognising him but nobody did. And the few who did just looked at him once before going back to their conversation. He couldn't help but let his smile grow because he had given up the thought of having a private life  in the Wizarding World. The bar finally came into view and he stepped in, again being enveloped by the soothing smell.
"Yea? "
"It mostly certainly would."
The sun had already set and the street lamps had been switched on. He could see a few people jogging or taking their dogs out for a walk. His fingers were twitching with anticipation and he kept looking at his watch. At exactly 7:30 pm he felt someone sit beside him.
“Merlin! Draco what the hell are you doing?”
"Alright Sir!"
"You don't know Potter? "
He took a few turns and followed the voice until he reached in front a door covered with black curtains where his subordinate, Dorothy was waiting.
He wanted to stare at them longer before he heard someone cough. With his hand reaching his wand he quickly turned to see Pansy Parkinson.
And Harry could hear the amusement in his words that made his grin bigger. Which made them both start laughing uncontroalablly until Harry had to clutch his stomach. It was a bit awkward after that but when Harry asked about the parchments with the tattoo designs, Ma...Draco took the parchments  from his hands and stared at them for a while. After looking like he had made his decision he took the one of them and started explaining it's beauty.
"Sure sir, what kind of coffee?"
He felt dizzy as his soulmate, some one he was suppose to trust, brushed him off and went the other way. He felt the tears build up before he put on his Malfoy mask swiftly just like his father and decided if he wasn't going to be his friend then he would just be his enemy. <3
"Of course love! You can dress however you want and never have to ask me. You would look bloody fantastic even a garbage bag and never let anyone restrict what you wear."
"You just need a reason to drink."
"Yea I know"
“What? Oh no, not at all Draco just thinking.”
"Love, talk to me. "
"Well let's see..."
"Goodnight mother."
"Potter you jaw is on the floor. "
And then slowly all the bricks came off and formed a staircase leading down below. Ron nodded at him to follow him before he disappeared down the stairs. With one look at the street he followed him down.The whole sight in front of him made all of his last few week's stress go away.
It was one of those days when Harry returned home late and didn't see his favorite dragon yet. With a smile he goes to look for him, subconsciously his hand reaching for his pocket to trace the small box in it. After a look in the kitchen and bedroom he heads to the work room not knowing what his love was doing so late in the night.
Harry was on his way to Hogsmeade when he found Malfoy under the Whomping Willow tree asleep, his knees pulled up to his chest with his head buried trying to avoid being noticed. But Harry knew even in a crowded hall he would never miss the blonde. He noticed a few parchments scattered so he went and picked them up. Harry could not help but gasp as he turned them over to see few of the most beautiful sketches ever. They were small and simple but at the same time held elegance and complexity. He sat beside Malfoy making sure the blonde didn’t wake up and kept looking at the parchments.
"Well during his trial, he named all of Voldemot's servants and even told all of their locations. And with my testimony he only had to do a bit of service work and visited the Ministry every time they captured a suspected Death Eater. And well after that he joined us in 8th year and you know all about that. But after all of us departed our ways, he had gone to the Ministry about some work and 1 week after that he disappears."
"Kind of."
"I..uhhb what?"
"Malfoy."
"Sure has Nott, but hold the drinks I just came here to talk."
"Hmm so would I, if you didn't smuggle Magical animals for your profit."
"Damn I'm good at designing stuff! "
"She is right. I mean it's the best way to have your morning dose of high without actually taking the high."
Draco had Harry on his lap, whispering their conversation and softly kiss him whenever he felt like it. He knew he might  have had a chance but that was it. He never thought Harry would actually agree to be together.
"Oh Shut up and tell us."
"Now now it is a surprise so now go on and get ready, wear something light."
In front of them was a narrow alley but the shops had enhancing charms placed inside. There were fairy lights and soft music going on in the background. While he followed Ron he noticed an Antique shop, a Book shop, a tattoo shop with a sight of a familiar ginger hair, a few bars and a stage with guitars kept on the sides and a few keyboards and bass. He also noticed a few cafes which made him want to get some breakfast. But their work was more important, so he patted his stomach and bumped into Ron who was just standing still.
Comfortable silence took over as Harry started thinking about the same thing he had been think about for the last three months. The moonlight made their room glow and the comfortable warmth around him made him feel safe. There was a soft wind blowing and the room smelled of dirt, chocolate, potions and ink, so the room smelled like them. Harry knew that Draco would support him no matter what but he was still a bit hesitant. His eyes finally fell on the shining ring on the lean fingers and Harry knew what he needed to do.
"Looking cute Potter! "
As he offered his hands to Neville, recognition crossed his face as he looked up at Draco with a big smile plastered on his face. Smiling Draco pulled him into a hug, stopping when he heard Neville wince. Without looking he placed his hand on Neville's chest and softly started murmuring a healing charm he knew by heart by now. After a few seconds he removed his hand and looked back at Neville who was smiling at him
"Woah slow down Grfinndork! "
Harry looked at Draco as he hesitantly looked at his sleeve under which they both new the death mark was there. With a small sigh he saw Draco un-buttoning the sleeves and then slowly folding them. He stopped just as the edges of the death mark started to appear. He stared at it for a while and then shrugged before he turned his forarm towards Harry. With a confused and curious expression Harry leaned in closer to look at the pale arm. And there, just in the edges of the mark Harry noticed a pair of narcissus. They weren’t moving or anything, just blooming. Harry looked up to ask Draco what he was trying to show when suddenly Draco slapped himself at which Harry winced.
"Th.. Thank you. "
All the 8th years we’re having a pre-Christmas party in the common room since most of them were going away. Ron, Hermione and Ginny were going to the Burrow, Dean and Seamus were spending the time with Dean’s family, Blaise, Lavender and a few others were going on trip together. Draco, Pansy, Luna and Harry were going to stay back. They all were huddled together in front of the Christmas tree and were blissfully tipsy. They were currently playing truth and dare and it was Hermione’s turn to ask Draco.
"Ummm so did we get all the details?"
"Hey hey hey, let's just chill alright?"
There in front of them was a huge room which was likely an old classroom. But it looked anything but old. It was filled with Slytherin colors. And sofa and loveseats were all across the room. And there was a thick rug filled with cushions and some books spread all over. A few old quills were on the table with a few parchments and an old  Slytherin scarf. There were also a few old empty boxes of chocolate frogs and old editions of the Witch's Weekly lying around. A wide-eyed Potter with his jaw on the floor was worth it.
"Damn!"
“Hello Harry. The name’s Draco.”
"Yes it's our secret. "
"Wait, he selected for me? "
"Alright, alright, I understand but before we go visit him you need to wipe your face. Damn! Your eyes are bloody red!"
"Of course I do. I love you. "
There in front of them was a huge room filled with all kinds of art supplies. Draco entered the room with wide eyes. There were shelves of with jars of different colours, muggle pencils of different kinds and all kinds of parchments and all his old drawings. Tears started slipping from his eyes as he wobbled to his mother to thank her. She picked him up and started wiping the tears.
“Okay Brown, truth or dare?”
When Draco got up next morning with his head on Harry's bare chest he couldn't help but smile at the shining ring on his finger. He couldn't believe it all had actually happened, it was like a dream. He felt Harry move a bit so he looked into those emerald green eyes.
After the first row of houses Teddy yad finally gotten down and would softly knock the doors and the run behind Harry's legs from where he would peek, watching Draco knock loud enough for the owner of the house to hear.
"Absolutely not.... "
"Wait how did you hear?"
"CRYSTAL SIR!'
There was a Slytherin Hogwarts uniform which actually made Harry roll his eye over. But the uniform looked so much better than the original. It looked like it was made of silk and it looked so soft that he leaned over to pull the tie when an image of Draco pulling him by the tie flashed in his head which made him blush furiously.
And then someone would come out, greet Harry and Draco who would smile sheepishly pointing their fingers behind them and then they would notice little Teddy. Once a man dressed up as a bear had picked him up and Teddy had started crying loudly. Draco had taken him and gone for a little walk, waiting for Harry who was apologizing to the bear. But looking at his honey bun cry made Draco think that if the bear lost all his candies then the kids would at least get one house to prank.
"Of course I can't let you be drunk so early in the morning."
"He complained about us saying that because of the things we did people will again start believing that everyone favours him."
"Goodnight my love."
"Wh.. "
And with that Harry pushed the bored aside and places his soft lips on Draco's and that moment felt so right! Maybe McGonagall really was upto something. <3
Just before he could finish his statement there was a loud knock on his office doors.
Harry stumbled out of his office's fireplace to see Dorothy waiting for him with a worried look on her face.
"It's alright Potter, thankfully Draco was here. "
"...okay mother."
"So Potter, finally ready to understand the world of fashion? "
And he really didn't care what others thought because he just wanted Harry to be happy. So he slowly took Harry's hand and placed them on his neck while he placed his on Harry's waist. And placing his forehead against Harry's he smiled down at him as he saw Harry's face lit up. So while everyone literally grinded against each other, both of the dorks slowly swayed to the fast music, sometimes Draco whispering something into Harry's ears which made him blush or sometimes Harry using the choker to pull Draco into a kiss.
"Really? "
"Yea and lastly hmmmm let's try to be friends yea? "
"No offense but last time you looked you were on the edge of losing control."
"Not me but my love. "
" Well Potter if you could get down then maybe we could get started sometimes this year? "
"What?"
"I don't think he saw my face though."
"Spooky? "
"Yes Potter? "
"Are you giving me consent? "
So for the next hour or two Harry just laid back while Pansy informed him when to open his eyes and went to close it, when to pout his lips or lift his chin. He seriously so grateful to her, because if she wasn't there he would've just put on the costume and go to his first ever proper Halloween.
"Yea... "
"Sir..it seems like they are floating!"
"What? Oh no! I'm just trying to the Head Auror. Hermione has everything else under her control."
"I mean I understand the irritation about the throne and all but clearly someone is just helping you, right?"
Like any other raid Harry waited outside the warehouse before getting the confirmations. There were about 10 witches and wizards who were smuggling magical herbs as drugs in the muggle world. And they all had been warned that they were carrying muggle machinery along with their wands. Because of which Harry's team needed to be extra careful.
"Yea! "
"Didn't think you would sit on the floor Malfoy? "
He quickly wrote a note to Hermione before apparating to Grimmauld place to wear something appropriate for a bar. It really didn't matter to him but he could still remember Draco mocking his fashion sense and helping him pick his clothes. As he fumbled with the leather jacket he started worrying about the bar being closed and Nott actually joking about it being open all night. But he needed answers and if he needs to make a fool out of himself for it then that's that.
Draco wanted to surprise Harry so he had been wearing a thick grey cloak with the hood on. Harry had asked him several times and each time he responded, " Patience lion" and pull him in for a kiss before he protested.
"Yea."
"Oh Merlin! I hope so."
"Of course love! "
Honestly as Harry spied on them, he couldn't help but admire their work. They had manage to even get the corrupted wizards and witches out of Wizengamot and got some half-bloods and muggle borns some seats. And Malfoy looking like an angel who could kill you was just a bonus.
"Well what do you think Potter? "
"Yeah like usual."
"And that's why he put us in charge of other things."
"Draco....."
"Oh c'mon! I might look silly in this but I lost a bet. Or else you could've seen how sexy I would look in a baseball player's uniform. "
"So who is it this time?"
"Alright, goodbye Potter. "
"I was worried Harry! You didn't even think to tell me. Even after all these years I worry. So please send me something anything even on small piece of paper but just let me know you are safe. "
The first time Harry was spotted with Draco (yes it is Draco now after all it is polite to call a bloke by his first name after he stitched you up so that you don’t bleed to death) the press went crazy. They started speculating from love affairs to poison or imperius to Malfoy worshipping the next Voldemort. The whole crew had a huge laugh as it made the front cover for almost seven weeks. They also used it to their benefits and placed some of their people into the press when they needed new employees to help the rush of the upcoming ‘Potter-Malfoy affairs’.
But it wasn't Draco's fault really. It was Potter's. Because it should be totally to walk around with an ass like that. And those soft lips that looked so plum and the way his hair looked as if he just got up after being shagged and he shouldn't even start on those emerald eyes.
"You are not hurt."
*while Harry was on his way back*
"Why? "
He didn't need to ask Neville since he was clearly succeeding...? Anyways seeing the dirt in his hair and his fingers cracked dry, he knew that the greenhouse was in good condition. He looked at Luna to see her calmly staring at him while sipping another weird cocktail created by Theo. He raised an eyebrow at her and smiled when she nodded. He knew that none of their 'prisoners' had no chance of escaping.
"Oh hello Potter you look stunning! "
"Alright, well you need to dye the edges of your hair for a week! "
"No."
"Alright. Do you know why he didn't tell me?"
Like Harry Draco had grey glitter in his hair which literally made it shine but also along with the glitter he had two fluffy wold ears. His eyes had a smoky grey look which made the silver glimmer and his lips were just the perfect shade of red. He wore a deep V leather jacket with nothing underneath and he wore leather gloves to go with it and they had metals claws in them. And the trousers hugged those never-ending legs perfectly and also had a... Tail? But the black leather choker on his glistening skin with the word 'Potter's' written on it made Harry forget about everything and he pulled the choker bringing Draco's delectable lips to his.
Wiping the small tears that had escaped he entered through the creeky doors. When he stopped in front their grave he saw someone had cleaned it up and had placed some shimmering flowers. And the tears didn't stop. He took off his spectacles and tried to wipe his face but they just didn't stop. All the moments he could have with them, the little time he had with them in forest that could've been everlasting and the way they had been smiling in the pictures could've all been here with him now overwhelmed him.
"Well, ummm have you heard anything about Malfoy?"
"Alright well you need to wear my Gryffindor uniform for the whole day! "
“Excuse me?”
With that Draco gently took Teddy from his hands with a soft smile of his face that was only reserved for Teddy and made Harry's heart skip a bit. And he watched then walk off into rows of clothes and could see Draco whispering something into Teddy's ear.
They ring also changed colours according to the emotions of the other pair. Now human emotions can never be counted to many of the ring's colours are unaccounted for but some of them have been derived. It turns gold for happiness, red for anger, blue for sadness, green for envy and so on. And if the pair ever met, the rings would turn pink. But the worst colour was black. Black symbolised death. If the other were to die, the ring mark would turn into an actual black ring. But we will talk about the rest some other day since there is a giddy eleven year old jumping up and down his bed because his soul ring finally turned golden after being blue for more than a month.
"No I didn't. "
"I guess I am, can't believe you started before me."
Taking a few steps inside,he was hit it one of the most sweetest and soothing smell ever. The whole layout was darker compared to the dark alley but he couldn't help but relax. After a few minutes, someone who he had been waiting for appeared before him, Theodore Nott.
"I am.... "
On the count of three, they break down the door and put up their sheilds expecting to hear guns firing. But you could hear a pin drop in that silence. So with a quick nod at his teammates he takes down the shields and start searching for the smugglers. He honestly thought that the info about the raid was leaked until he heard one of his subordinates shout for him.
"Draco? "
"Hmmm aren't you going to trap me and put in that Death eater costume, I wonder where they got it from though."
The adorable blush on Potter's face made him want to kiss him but he controlled himself.
"Potter even sweet little Teddy can speak better than that! "
“Oh, forget it! Honestly, Potter you can be so oblivious sometimes.”
"Alright! You remember the cool wave you felt when you entered the classroom. Apparently it was some charmwork. It is going to pair you with the most compatible person to your magic. And then you heard the rest. Oh! And we are going to a marked and we need to find the person who has the similar mark. I think she is upto something. "
"Oh yes it's a charm I thought would look good with your costume. And don't worry it's subtle, so only people close to you will notice. "
"Woah! "
"Morning."
"...be magnificent. I mean can you imag- What?"
"Hey, that's fine. Just let it all out in front of me."
"What? "
"Actually he wanted to but the circumstances didn't let him."
"Honestly Potter Dra...forget it, that's an illusion for the muggles."
Harry was a bit startled when Pansy started dragging him to the guest room until he saw what was inside. It looked like the whole room was transformed. It had things Harry had only seen in magazines and various kinds of trinkets floating around. In one corner he could see the costume which had made his dream reality.
"Yeah thanks also..."
So, when Draco returned covered in sweat after his fencing lessons his mother just smiled at him. And clutching those small hands she leads him down a corridor he has never visited before. After a brief walk they reach a closed doors which looked clean compared to the dusty ones. And with twinkling eyes Narcissa opened the door and looked down happily at her son who was mouth was hanging open.
"Our secret? "
"What.. Malfoy I mean Draco are you... This will sound really rude but is there a chance you like boys? "
"Wait you have more? "
"Dwaco... Uncle Dwaco. "
"No... honestly Malfoy I am done with thus shit. Working within the Ministry is just bollocks!! They are fucking infuriating with all of their bloody policies. And don't even get me started with the Prophet! They have literally branded me as the next Voldie and probably already have a report ready the moment I make a mistake! So yes! Me and friends will be joining you, though the others might not be so prone to an illegal activities. Oh! I also gave my resignation note."
His love stared at him a bit longer before picking up the bowl. They ate in silence their knees bumping and exchanging smiles and winks.
"Uh you have something of mine. "
"Alright call for others and get behind me and put up your shields."
“Since when have you been awake?”
Blaise who had been standing behind them came in front of Draco with a smirk on his face.
And as Draco's cold leather gloves fingers traced his ear he couldn't help but whimper.
"Which is why we have the potions!"
"Oh! "
"Hogwarts?"
"What? Why? "
"Potter."
"Nonono it is just something we use to say."
"I love you too, Draco Malfoy-Potter." <3
He stayed up the whole till he could no longer. He woke up past noon and his mark had turned back to golden since they hadn't properly introduced each other. Calming himself he quickly wore his glove. He decided he try to be friends with raven hair and if he felt morehe would pursue that.
“Merlin Draco do you really think I would want it on me if I didn’t think so?”
"Hello Potter."
“Why?”
He clutched the note he had taken with him in the morning to remember to return home early. But there had been a raid and he was held back and now it was one in the night. He tried not to worry but his gut was saying otherwise.
"Well Potter I didn't think it would bother you that much. Normally I would give it to you but Teddy is my family. I deserve to be there for his first Halloween! "
"Oh! Should I leave?"
Draco hugs him one last time before getting up and they head to the parlour. The bar obviously wasn't as big as the Manor but the layout was just as confusing though that did keep the curious eyes away. After going through a few passages they both made it into their parlour to see Luna, Theo and Ginny.
"Yeah! Ummm muggle."
"I don't care!"
"... Alright. "
Apparently Malfoy and some of his friends from his year had started an organisation. It had nothing to do with blood supremacy but some actual change. They had first started by spending an year in muggle London and after they came back they started teaching purebloods that muggles aren't as different as they thought they were.
"Just kidding Potter! "
"Well when we are alone I guess or when your last name changes, whichever comes first. "
Malfoy was kneeling in front of their place muttering something and conjuring up small white lilies and decorating their place. And the look on his face was different, a look asking for forgiveness. He stood there, while Malfoy placed the lilies and if he liked closely there was also some small light orbs all over the place. Oh! That made his hair shimmer!
"Draco might have charmed the costumes but I don't exactly know what it is since it will only work for you. "
"It can't be."
He say a flick of something fly by and his seeker instincts took over as his eyes followed it. It was a snitch and it was moving around a golden set of costume. Every piece of it was golden silk and the snitch was flying all around it. As he caught it he heard Draco whisper into his ears, 'Training for the ballet Pottah! 'but this time Harry was bending against him. And his blush became unimaginable brighter as he shifted to make his pants comfortable.
Harry knew that the blonde was always good in potions but that is a bit of an understatement since he can make any potion be it old or new with a 99.99% of accuracy. He had also picked up muggle MMA fighting and taught to anyone who volunteered since they can't always rely on wands during a mission. The kindergarten Harry had seen before was apparently owned by him and he visited at least thrice a week without fail.
“A tattoo. For me… could you design a tattoo for me?”
"I know you did but now you have the option of not having to do that alone. Go rest up while I try to wake Ron up."
"Oh I already got mine and Teddy's just pack them up and I'll taking all three of them. "
"Okay now why does it matter he is a boy? You both can be friends."
"I.. Alright Mal.. Dra.. Draco! "
He looked at the barista who was now making his drink but he couldn't see his face properly. He was not only wearing a mask but also a hat. He had a lean frame but also had defined muscles, his arm with the folded sleeves looked quite strong. He couldn't see his eyes but there were some loose blonde hair falling in front of his eyes which reminded of some one he thought of often now.
"It's not your fault and.. "
"Well except for someone solving our cases, yes actually."
"Yea I saw the painting. "
"Alright."
"It's alright mate, I got you!"
“Wait they move? Like actually move?”
So he had decided he would ask Draco to come along Trick or Treating with him and Teddy. So when he went to Draco's shop to look for him, he had to search for him for a while until he found him with Pansy in a corner of the shop.
"Yeah and I was finally getting enough recognition to get promoted but after the recent events I honestly don't know where my promotion stands."
"You didn't get hurt right? "
"I told yea didn't I. "
“Wait are you serious?”
"Excuse me what the hell are you talking about?! "
"Cause I like you too! "
"Well he complained about us."
He silently slipped inside the room making sure Draco was asleep and quickly changed his clothes. Then as silently as possible for a clumsy person like him, he entered the duvet. But as soon as he did Draco turned towards him.
“Potter I might've known you since I was 11 but at the same time I really don't know you, so don't blame me for being sceptical."
"Okay."
And as Malfoy waved at him with a playful smile Harry heard a rustle and in the next moment someone was casting a spell at them. Most specifically at Malfoy. Not know what came over him( Mione called it hero complex) he ran to Malfoy and clutched his hands before apparating to the one place he has been thinking about all day.
"I know you would."
"Wow.. I mean how? "
It was a Gryffindor red vintage silk shirt and black trousers. It looked quite ordinary but the jewelled corset made it look like the male version costume of Red riding Hood. It looked like there were a few rubies on it, just like the ones lining the robes. And he could see a halter for a dagger and wondered whether it was for his wand. He turned back as he felt someone tap his shoulder, to find Pansy staring at him with a bathrobe in her hand.
"Oh yes of course you can come... But ummm you were talking with Pansy about.. "
A chorus of protest filled the room but Draco turned his attention back to Theo.
"Wait aren't you here to help me dress Teddy? "
And he knew just what was going to happen as he saw Draco's smile slowly turning to a smirk.
The surprise overcame Harry and he just bursted through the door.
“You don’t need to tell me twice Malfoy.”
"In our defense-"
It wasn't like they were avoiding each other but they just didn't feel like they needed to spend time together. And so they passed by each other nodding their heads in acknowledgment with rare greetings.
Wrapping his arms around Potter quickly and smiling at the light blush he quickly apparated them to The Place. The stomach gurgling experience still made him think was it worth it or not, but when Potter stumbled into him during landing, it was worth it.
"I know I understand."
"Alright Malfoy. "
I had to visit father today.
"Well no matter how much of a denial you are in I am glad you wanted to go public so quick! "
"So that I can ask for a kiss as my third request. "
"Ha! He was sure you would chose that. "
"So ever since you joined the aurors, yeah?"
"Yea yea were you snuggling when you woke up?"
"Oh!"
"IT'S THE THIRD TIME RON!"
"Yeah I do."
"Oh no, it's a casual bar and it's morning so it's alright. Let's head in."
'You were knocked out cold and after seeing what you looked like earlier I couldn't wake you up. Also Ron apologizes for being a dumb drunk git and promises us to buy a round next weekend.'
Draco could taste the sweet chocolate taste from before on Harry's lips and he pulled him closer to taste it more. He held Harry's waist tightly not wanting to ever let it go and he asked for Harry's permission before entering his mouth. He couldn't control himself anymore and wanted to taste Harry's every corner. And when Harry's hand tightened in his Harry he could help but let a small groan escape. He could sense Harry's cheeks warm up but before he could go any further he heard a loud cough.
"It's alright Luna, thank you for playing the piano for me all this time. I know this is terribly rude but could you all step outside for a moment, I need to talk with Nathan."
"Trust me."
"Umm is this going to happen every year? "
As the modified camera focused on them which were currently being livestreamed every where in Wizarding London he felt Draco's grip tighten.
"Do you understand Nate?"
"The bar? I mean you were serious about the drink right?"
"Dra.. Draco it's fine and ummm I don't mind but just don't do it in public. "
"I won't wear any stupid costume.....repeat again.. "
"Let's talk later yeah? Remember, emergency?"
"BAHAHAHAHA I can't wait for him to be in the actual field."
"I'm dreaming aren't I? "
"Mate!"
He headed down to the kitchen and made some light breakfast with a fruit salad and bacon and eggs for protein. He heard his love coming down and turned back. He stared for so long that ths eggs almost burnt. Draco was wearing a soft pastel blue shirt with his sleeves folded and white trousers. He wore the stud pearl earring Harry had gifted him a while back and had his hair styled.
"This will be the fifth."
"Because your hair is the prettiest after mine!"
"What are you sorry about Nate?"
During the 8th year Harry had grown closer to Mal... Draco. They both use to sit in front the lake, hours together without saying anything. On their last day Harry had asked what was he going to do after graduation but only got a sad smile in return. Later in the train platform Hermione told him that the Ministry had banished him Wizarding London for the next 12 years. Harry went in search for him but it was already as he spotted Draco apparate with two Aurors.
"Hmm truth."
"This is going to be dangerous, Potter."
"You all should honestly stop meeting out here."
"Get off me!"
"You don't know that!"
"What Ginny is trying to ask did you get to stay the nights?"
And now not only was he a part of Harry's life, he was also part of Teddy's. And to think Harry had thought that Draco looked the cutest when he was frowning and concentrating while making a potion with a small pout on his face. Oh boy was he wrong!
"Uhhh they are well guarding the evidence I guess Sir."
"Well hmmm... "
Pansy without a word, ran and hugged Draco, keeping his injuries in mind. Draco simply smiled and hugged back knowing he needed to clean his shoulder before anyone notices the wet blotches or else Pansy would hide his wand away. Pansy pulled apart and placed a loud smack on Draco's cheek before sitting beside Nathan and ruffling his hair.
"THEOOO!!!"
"Oh yea I was going to return it until I saw what it is. "
"So Dorothy anything out of the usual?"
And after a few moments Narcissa had a precious sleeping dragons in her arms who she carried to the bedroom. Then with a wave of her wand she cleaned him up and placed him on the bed. With a soft kiss on the forehead and a promise to keep her safe she left the room to talk with her husband. To
"I guess we were. "
"Well I have been trying to greet you everyday so that we can talk or try to partner up with you,but you kept in avoiding me!"
"Come on darling please I'll go to Hogsmeade with you! "
"Well speaking about him, how is he?"
"Don't play hard to get! '
"Umm... Draco, love, dragon I can't form a proper speech but I'm going to try. That day when I picked up the sketch and looked at it, I was so shocked that someone looked at me like that. So when you had found me in the room of requirements I had been actually crying a bit. Because it overwhelmed me  to know that someone cared so much. And everything since than has been like a dream from which I never want to wake up. I can't think of spending my days without you, I mean I couldn't even sleep when you had gone to Hogwarts for a week. You are my past, my now and my future and I want to ask you, Draco Malfoy, do you want to be together, forever? "
Finally after half an hour they both got ready and Hardy presented the portkey which was obviously a tea cup. With a small smile they held the cup before the gagging feeling took over. The both took a few minutes to get use their surrounding. They were in a forest and Harry took Draco's hand and started pulling him in until the reached a small cottage. Harry looked back at him and started his practised speech.
And yet he was always waiting at home for dinner no matter how late Harry returned. Sometimes Harry would find him asleep on the table and he would feel even more guilty. Tonight was one such night. He had promised to return early but a witness had shown up for one of his cases and he needed to stay back.
"Don't worry darling, in the end it is up to you and know that you will have our support no matter the choice."
"Damn Gin!"
"Well if you don't want to that's fine I guess... "
Harry noticed the silver eyes sparkling as Draco explained each sketch with his voice full of hesitation but he hoped someday that the hesitation would be gone. And now as he stared deeper, he noticed a faint hue of blue along with specks of gold. Harry wondered how he hadn’t noticed that before when he realized how close he was to the blonde who was now talking about the dragon tattoo. Harry couldn't help but grin as he took in the new side of Draco and hoped he could discover more of them. He also wondered whether the easy transition from Malfoy to Draco was weird or was he thinking too much about it.
“Yea whatever, hey could you maybe…. uhhh what I meant…ummm…”
"Well Sir we sweeped the whole warehouse and found the expected drugs to be destroyed and the smugglers like usual aren't saying a word about who roped them up but there was a note attached to the leader and it seems like it was meant for you."
Draco didn't know what he would expect for his eighth year. He already knew most of the students will avoid him or hex him and he was ready for that. But he wasn't ready for Potter to return his sand and also form a truce with him.
"Oh! "
"Potter."
Draco pulled him even closer enjoying the warmth which will hopefully stay forever now and stared at the bushing idiot. His blushing idiot. After a while they were in the patch and he could hear a distant howl. They searched for a while before Potter spotted the perfect pumpkin.
"Yes."
"Few of the first years from Slytherin and Gryfinndor almost blew up the lab trying to prank some Ravenclaws."
Harry had been avoiding looking at the mirror so when he finally did, he was beyond shocked. His out of control hair actually looked controlled. It still looked messy, but it was more of an organised mess and it had a few rubies charmed to it and it almost looked like...
"Well drop this little bun to Granger's place and we can get the pumpkins and maybe talk? "
"When you have plants that literally try to maim you at every chance they get, only the crazy ones don't run."
"So you do this every year. "
After a short drive, she stops her car in front of an old warehouse. Making sure her make-up is alright and her dagger in place she silently goes inside, not before using a disillusion charm. There were about 21 armed muggle mens and they seriously didn't know what they had gotten into. Placing a few secret weapons behind them, she goes in front of their head and takes off her charm. And the minutes that happens all the guns were pointed at her. Smiling she lifts up her arms in surrender.
"You would wouldn't you? "
"Wait we weren't flirting right now? "
"LET'S MOVE IN."
"Well since you left in such a hurry you didn't actually take anything with you. "
With a swift movement she stood in front of Lisa and smiled at her cowering self. She pointed the blade at her before hitting her with the hilt. Lisa fell on the floor unconscious and she didn't think once before stepping over her and walk over to Blaise.
"Haha that line holds lots of memories but from your mouth, it's just filth!"
All the Ministry workers were tied up with a rope charmed by George to only let go when a certain word is spoken and all of their wands were taken away. And since all of them were just blobs without their wand there really was no threat. Minerva was sipping tea and chatting with Luna while the rest of the crew were setting up the equipments. They both walked over to Hermione who was in charge of the mission.
"Good morning Winky."
“I....wait do you seriously think I would hit you?”
Love, Draco
"We stared at each other for a sec and then started laughing."
Malfoy stared at with him with confusion and curiosity before his soft pale pink lips(He used to spy on him! He obviously needed a detailed description of his lips) turned into a smile full of amusement.
Theo took a deep breath to calm his nerves down and saw Nathan still shaking a bit, so with a small smile on his face he ruffled Nathan's strawberry  blonde hair and opened the door. Draco was sitting by the piano softly tracing his fingers on the keys. Theo was about to cough when Draco lifted his hand to tell him he knows they are there. 'Ever the Slytherin', thought Theo.
"So... "
"I know and I am going to talk to you about how you shouldn't be doing major spells later, don't think I will forget. But why do you always need to return with cuts all over you, Longbttom?!"
"Well Potter, you must've a lot of questions."
"Floating?"
"Oh yea! Anyways can I get that back? "
"Yes... Harry... You.. Me! "
Thinking it was one more illusion he leaned towards those soft lips thinking they'll disappear but met with a sweet taste. Surprised he opened his eyes to meet Dragons shocked ones."I... "Before he could think of something he pulled in for a soft gentle kiss and wanted the moment to last forever. Well until a certain Turquoise head said something. " Uncle Dwaco? Hawwy? " Harry jumped back and went to get Teddy but Draco caught his arms and whispered something which made him blush before taking Teddy from Pansy and going out.
"Well....we might have gone on a date or two."
"Uhhh Harry, would you be okay if I were clothes like these?"
"Pansy bring out the vodka! We need him to spill the details!"
"Uncle Dawco! Hawwy! "
And everytime Harry laughed at one of Draco's joke or pout when Draco would tease him too much, he couldn't help but kiss his lion. And after so many years of knowing each other he felt honoured  that he would be accompanying Harry for his first ever proper Halloween.
"Don't worry, it definitely was the one and only Draco Malfoy!"
"Yes mommy. "
' Perfect throne for your Chosen Arse' <3
“What?”
"Umm alright just clean it. Hmm oh! You are going to let me style that atrocious hair of your! "
He couldn't believe this was actually happening. He had been so nervous but maybe there was no reason to. But he still wanted to make sure that it was actually what he thought it was.
It had been about an year since Harry left the Aurors to start living in muggle London. He had gone head first into the job thinking it was the right thing to do but after five years of struggle and despair he finally left. He still visited his old friends from time to time but he rarely went back other wise. He was now working as an amateur photographer, exploring all parts of London. He was currently going to a coffee shop where his latest clients(recently engaged) had first met. They were going to get photographed there next week but Harry liked to get familiarized with the place first.
"What? "
He flooed into Potter's living room to find it empty. After waiting for a while he went to look for him and found him and Teddy in the kitchen. Teddy was on top of the island while Harry wiped his face with a napkin while murmuring something to him.
"Pretty much everytime we meet."
"Oh Draco I'm so sorry. It was all so sudden but it's my fault. I... "
As he apparated in front of the familiar brickwall he clenched the card tighter in anticipation. But somehow as he was about to say the password the card started glowing and the next thing he knew he was standing in front of the bar. He looked down at the card and then at his surrounding wondering how powerful the caster must be to implement all of this.
It was about an hour walking distance from the apartment he rented but it was all worth it when he saw the place. He was honestly surprised that he did not know about it before. It was in the corner of a quiet street, it had a rustic look with creeeps hanging and wild flowers growing in bushes. As he entered a warm waft embraced him. It smelled of coffee and cinnamon and oddly of Christmas?
"I would've believed you if you weren't grinning like a crackhead."
"Teddy! So what are you? "
With an eye full of fondness he got up not before leaving a small peck on his forehead. Harry didn't know how could he ever be so lucky to have him and stared at him till he disappeared into the washroom. Snapping out of his trance he quickly used the other washroom to get ready and looked himself in ths mirror. He was wearing a green and black flannel with an underneath black tee which should all his muscles and tight but comfortable  black jeans. He tried to get his hair under control but well all battles can't be won.
"Obviously, spooky places are best to visit at night! "
He softly lifted up Teddy with a smile on his face and felt Potter staring at him.
Harry took off the note from the bedroom's door and opened it slowly. With light steps he went over to his sleeping dragon. As soon as he sat Draco turned towards him with red swollen eyes. Harry quickly went and pulled his love into his chest and started patting his back while he sniffled. He tried to pull him as close as possible and softly started whispering. He held him till he felt asleep and then he wiped his tear stained cheeks and kissed him good night.
As he opens the door he notices the room had floating scented candles all over the place. And a huge canvas in the back with most probably his dragon behind it. As he carefully navigated his way through the candles and the piles of boxes and paints and parchments he was still tracing that little box.
Nott noticed he wanted a break so he stepped away from Harry fumbling with something behind the counter. Harry stared at the ice in his drink while a rush of memories over took him. He hadn't known he was crying until a tear dropped into his drink. Slowly he started laughing softly as he finished his drink. Maybe he didn't need to worry so much since apparently someone had his eyes on him.<3
"When was it Nott?"
"Gah! My mascara almost got ruined."
"Hmmm I don't know what you are talking about Mione?"
"You have no idea!"
"Why yes darling. "
"Can't say I haven't."
He had seriously not meant to eavesdrop but the conversation between them looked interesting. So he slowly crept around one of the shelves trying to catch bits of the conversation.
"No! I wanted to be like you and father!"
"So Minister of Magic huh?"
“Well, they are beautiful like really beautiful! And I had decided to get a tattoo before but all of the designs were weird. Whereas if I had your tattoo designs there at that moment I think I would've come out of the parlour with at least a dozen of them!
It was him. Not just any him. The one from the Charcoal sketch. It was the exact same thing but had more colours in it than before. And the eyes looked like green canopies of the forests. He stared mesmerised, tears forming in his eyes thinking how can someone look at him so beautifully. His eyes scanned through the painting taking in everything when he noticed a sketch of a ring in the corner. He wondered if there was a ring in the sketch bef.. Oh! Oh! Oh!
"So you knew he was going to disappear."
"Mal.. Wha.. Why didn't you tell anyone?! "
"Honestly Theo I would kill for those pancakes."
"Agreed. Harry would go ballistic if he knew someone sent him clues about his investigation."
"This it?"
"Uhh your choice but maybe something sweet."
"Yes darling. "
Harry looked over at Ron who was already asleep when he remembered that he hadn't even had a drink. Not able to decide whether to leave or stay he decided to wait for a few minutes and leave if things got uncomfortable.
"I know you must've had a tired day at work..."
"Uh..hngh..my ring."
"I.. No.. I mean yes... Wha.. You know what I meant! "
"What no....but you are going really? "
"Well you are going with me Potter so you need to dress proper and well after you both chose I'll wear something that would go with both. "
"Oh darling what's wrong?"
“Well, couldyoupleasedesignatatttooformedraco?”
" and when you find your marked partner you two must come up with three things you want your partner to do for you. Remember your magic is the most compatible so you must try to understand each other and come to conclusion together and no funny business, I don't care if you are eighteen or twenty-eight! "
His dragon was going to propose. He felt his heart stop a bit and he felt overwhelmed by all his emotions, his brain trying to comprehend everything. But wait.. What about the box in his pocket? Draco had done so much for him and this time he felt he should be the one to show how much he loved his dragon.
After awhile they reached the old painting of the Malfoy Manor which no one knew existed and whispered the password. And the gasp from Potter made his smirk bigger as he entered the room.
"What are you doing here Draco? "
"What happened Theo?"
"Let me repeat, hello Harry Potter."
"Well Potter I'm done, I'm sorry I didn't ask for permission and you can take them off. "
He was so excited that he almost missed the swishing red cape. And he was glad that he didn't because that was the best thing he ever saw. It was a long thick red cape that would reach the floor and it almost looked like the male version of Little Red Riding Hood's costume.
"Hogwarts, your robes. Are you going there?"
"Bu..b..you..he...he...he is awake!"
one building away from the warehouse.
With small laugh he pushes back his plate and takes out the note and places it in the middle of the table. With curious eyes Hermione takes the note and unfolds it while Ron hovers over her shoulder to read it. When they both looked at him with questioning eyes he nodded towards the left side corner. A small gasp escaped Hermione's lips when she used the magnification charm and Ron almost looked like he paled a bit.
"What! No not at all, Draco is taking care of that. "
"Yes! "
"Ughh a fake witness came and then attacked me?"
"Don't worry Potter, even if I could share them it wouldn't change things."
A guy about his age came running from the other end of the bar and stopped himself before he slammed into the front bar. He bend over holding his knees and took a deep breath in. After a few seconds he got up to see them staring at him. He grinned at them with a shy smile before getting on one of the bar stools.
"Yeah, he wants us to pile up their bodies like a fucking tower!"
"I guess the others send you out this time? "
"Well I'm sorry to inform you Potter but you aren't dreaming. "
Both of them were wearing black masks so he couldn't get a clear view them. They both were staring at him when he realized he had been standing there for a while so cleared his throat and went forward. He looked at the displayed food for a while before he decided on a slice of apple pie and coffee.
"Morning my love."
"Morning."
"Oh alright, ask away. But before that let me just ask one thing, have you received any gifts?"
"Yeah"
"I wouldn't do that, if I were you."
"No."
"Same. And I am so sorry to disturb your conversation but it's kind of an emergency."
"Well? Go on."
So as Draco held him close and apparated to an alleyway beside the club where they were meeting the others the only thought in Harry's head was, Is it weird to pull off your lover's cloak on the first date, before it even started?  But the blaring music from the club distracted him. It was a muggle one so uncomfortable that Harry doesn't feel uncomfortable but apparently the muggles loved to party on Halloween.
It was only Six in the evening but the neighborhoods of muggle London were already buzzing with small toddlers running all around, knocking from house to house. And because of the varieties of costumes on the street no one questioned why two grown men were wearing such thick cloaks during October.
He was startled out of his thought as the barista placed his order in front of him. He tried to look for the name tag to thank him but saw there wasn't one. Before he could say anything the barista gave a slight bow and went back. A bit confused he finally looked at the food which smelled delicious. He took the mug a took a small sip before a grin took over his face.
"Well I suppose I was but now I know something that no one else knows."
“Woah…”
"You know what that means right? "
"Alright, see you at 7? "
He had just returned from a very long walk which he had taken due to his anxiety when he came across Malfoy, Zabini, Parkinson, Nott and Bulstrode having a very drunk tea party. A tea party as in a tea party with muggle toy cups and toy cookies. But the most hilarious part was as he tried to escape unnoticed Parkinson had suddenly pulled him down(cause tea parties are obviously on the floor) and handed him a cup. She got up a gave a toast on how circular were Harry's glasses when a very drunk Draco had exclaimed the Potter's cup was empty. Everyone had started shouting and had started looking for the bottle of Firewhisky which was obviously the Tea! It took every ounce of self-control to not burst up laughing when Draco had snatched Pansy's muggle tiara and place it on Harry's head and apologise for the lack of tea.
"What? "
"Alright? But is it like before?"
"Well last time I saw him he was pretty healed up and might even join us in a while."
"We can't be sure! "
"You know I had planned many things. "
"I should've expected that. Though I had planned before to only slip him the clues but then his work would becoming rather boring."
"Good morning, Mrs- Narcissa, apologies on showing up unannounced."
Harry absolutely loved his life. There was finally no madman trying to kill him(at least he didn't know) and he could spend time with the person he loved and the people he cared about.
"How are you Draco?"
"So..?"
"Well then let's get to work darling!"<3
"Well there was a couple who got eachother's name tattooed on their ring fingers..."
And with that Draco got up and without saying anything went into the bedroom. Harry didn't know whether he should follow or not and that's when he noticed the dishes on the table. As he opened them his heart became more guilty. These laid a delicious looking Shepard's pie, treacle tarts and some pasta all under statis charms. He had really messed up this time.
"Listen up everyone! We have been tracking a group of magical animal traffickers for a while. But most of them were muggles who didn't know what they were doing. It almost seemed like they were under the Imperius charm. So we were waiting for the leader and today finally we have found her. Let's make sure we capture her but we need to be careful because I don't want anyone to get hurt. AM I CLEAR!"
Placing a soft kiss on precious Teddy's forehead, he gave a small wink to Potter, staying long enough to see him blush before flooing to the Manor to get ready for the night.
With a snap she disappeared only to reappear moments later.
"Already drunk mate?"
Thankfully Pansy had assured him that nothing major happened but his nerves still got the best of him. First he asked Theo about all their connections. Theo reported back that most of them are still faithful but a few had tried to blackmail them. So they had sent someone to 'blow'them up. Draco smirked at that and looked at the two empty chairs.
"Oh no! Not at all, I like this Draco, thank you very much! "
Curiosity filled her eyes as Harry started explaining his situation. She listened with interest and in the end a small smile appeared on her face.
*the morning of their anniversary*
"Oh dragon, this is great news."
His seeker skills allowed him to glude through the room without being hit by any of those flying trinkets and his hand reached for the red robe, stopping when he remembered that Pansy was with him. So trying to control himself he tried looking at the costume with a bit more attention to the details.
"I am sorry Dray!"
"What? "
He walked back into the main area to find the rest of the Aurors circled around something. With an irritated look he told everyone to move away but when it seemed no one was listening to him he pushed himself into the crowd and couldn't believe what he was seeing. It seemed like all of their suspects along with the leader who seemed like a daughter of a very social pureblood family were arranged in what almost seemed like A FUCKING THRONE! And in the seat was a crown along with another note. With his face reddening he went and unfolded the note.
And yet Draco couldn't stop thinking about the git.Not in denial anymore(not that he ever was, he just didn't wanted his father to know and now he was least bothered), he didn't mind staring at a bloke's arse.
The pighead tried to touch Draco's face when he started screaming. Harry noticed that Draco was was free now and had something shiny in his hand. With grace of a ballet dancer he quickly worked through most of the goons before he went to free Harry. With a flick the ropes came untied and Harry could only sit and stare.
"Perfect throne for your Chosen arse."
“Dare.”
"So...what do you know about Draco's disappearance?"
"21 bodies Pansy, even I need time."
"About the pumpkin patch... "
"Draco, love. "
"Alright, Muggle or Wizarding?"
"I would Weasley but then Potter wouldn't be able to finish his homework. "
He sat down on the rug and took out some parchment.
"Well Ron Hermione, let me just make sure you understood everything. Draco Malfoy is alive and it looks like he is up to something." And he decided to ignore the excitement he was feeling after all these years.<3
"Darling don't cry. "
"Hey!"
"Well Potter meet Nathan Agreste."
A small smile appearing on his face he walked over to look at the pictures on the wall. Some were of Potter's parents and his godfather along with Teddy's dad and mum. Most of them were of his friends and of the times from Hogwarts and he even found a few pictures of himself along with Teddy's. The one he liked the most was of him and Teddy with flower crowns and him bouncing Teddy in his arms.
Once Harry had followed Malfoy after he was done 'threatening' the target and he had gone to an ice cream shop? He had returned with about 10 tubs of ice cream and then went to a kindergarten. All the kids had literally swarmed at him and he almost fell. They had spent the rest of the evening playing with Malfoy who was joined by Parkinson later.
"Looks like we are destined Potter! "
"You... Go... Me.. Really? "
"Coming?"
"So...you will be join us?"
"Now you are using last names! "
"Gin?"
"I think we should talk first. "
"What? "
"No! I'll go and we'll get the pumpkins and maybe talk? "
"And I you. You do know this dinner was an early celebration for tomorrow right? "
"Alright Harry! "
"We'll see about that. "
He loved those moments and never thought about getting something more. He was happy and contented with the small smiles and the way Draco kept on playing with his hair. The change between them had a small bumpy start but the ship sailed smoothly after that(*wink wink).
It didn't take him long and the walk went by in the blink of an eye. He shuddered thinking about the last time he was here. Overwhelmed tears suddenly started pouring out of his which he tried unsuccessfully to wipe. He leaned against a tree trying to control himself when he heard a rustle.
"What, you noticed? "
"Alright give it to me."
When Draco was still wobbling when he walked his mother had given him a small set of colours. And she smiled sweetly at him as his eyes gleamed with wonder. He blowed a raspberry at her in a way to say thank you, which made her giggle a bit.
"What?"
Potter with a grin was about to touch his cheeks when he quickly moved out of the way.
"Well you better write the note."
All of their 10 smugglers were hanging from the roof, tied in way to make sure they are barely alive and getting tortured at the same time. And it looked like all of them were unconscious. 'Someone was here!' With one more look at their roped up bodies he told his team to get them all down and into holding and sweep up all the evidence.
"But I got you this year! "
"Let's go love. "
They were together for almost one year now and Harry wanted to do something special for their anniversary. Ever since they were 11 Harry had noticed there wasn't a single day Draco would go without tea and even now he always had a cup of tea on his desk full and steaming. And the morning after when Draco first said 'I love you' Harry woke up with one of Draco's arm around him and the other holding a cup of tea.
"Hmmm I guess I was wrong well then I'll be on my way but did you see anyone else enter the forest? "
"I do? "
"You can think about your boyfriend later, checkout your hair."
"And begin!"
"Just wanted to make sure before I do this. "
"Come in."
"Yea." And he pointed his finger towards the parchment.
"Nathan calm down, take big breaths for me. If something happens to you, I will be good as dead."
Standing in front of him was the raven hair boy who was apparently Harry Potter and an orange hair boy who just insulted his name. Angry he retorted back at the much obvious Weasley boy before he turned to Harry Potter and extended his hand in hope of friendship.
"I'll join them in Italy."
"You and Fashion will take time! "
"Yes he is out with Pansy and Blaise. I actually need your help."
"Yeah most of them will leave the Manor. They will set up in France since it is next on our list."
"Oh! "
"Go ahead! Anywhere but the face. "
Draco absolutely loved using post-it notes and felt it was one of the greatest things muggles ever created. And he would leave them all around the house for Harry to find.
"No way McGonagall can read that! "
"But.. I... Well.. "
"Let me talk first yea?"
With a bit of concentration and a flick of hands Draco enlarged the board and placed it on his and Harry's thighs and charmed it so it was stable. (Of course he could float it but then he wouldn't get a chance to bump knees with Harry). And when he was done the look of surprise on Harry's face due to the wandless magic was priceless.
"Maybe not immediately but you would have eventually."
As Luna and Theo stepped out, Draco motioned Nathan to sit beside him. Nathan slowly sat with a bit of hesitation. Draco looked at Nathan and saw worry and sadness as well as a bit of relief on the little boy's face. He pushed the strawberry blonde fringe behind his ears and hugged him. He held his little brother who started to weep softly and he slowly rubbed his back and whispered words of reassurance into his ear. After awhile when he felt Nathan slow down a bit, he pushed back his face to wipe the tears away and smiled softly at him.
"Why?You want to visit Pansy's clubs in the morning then?"
Draco noticed Neville stiffening a bit at the use of his last name but he smiled at the familiar routine. He was glad that not much had changed during the time he 'slept'.
"Mhm, see you later honey bun, love you. "
"No problem darling, but Draco did get you the ones he had charmed. "
He still smiled at the memory which made feel like he was floating and had suddenly remembered something. He had once asked Draco why he loved tea so much and Draco had told him about a fond memory of his. When he was small, he and his mother use to go to France a lot. His mother loved tea and he would tag along with her. And they use to go to one particular tea shop which had a library along with it and they would drink tea together while his mother read him the stories.
"That's very vague. But we'll umm because you are the saviour? "
"What do you mean?"
"Yea? "
"Lead the way!"
"Okay."
"What do you mean?"
And no one had questioned it. Because they knew when Harry had gone to Draco's side during Christmas Eve how much they meant to each other. And frankly speaking everyone adored how cute they were. But frustrated because they were still not together!
Harry grinned and basically ran up to him.
"Oh sorry about that. "
~bonus-next day~
"Nate, darling how can you be so sure? After all we are all humans and we are bound to make mistakes but the important thing is that we are their for the other person whenever they need us. And that's the true meaning of our little guild!"
"Pansy! You can't creep on me like that! "
Apparently Potter had a solution. Because with a small sonorous he shouted something that made Draco's heart skip a beat.
"Ha good one, how much time do we have left?"
"If you're that weak I'll charm myself but I'll not take no for an answer! "
"Oh alright, umm well I'll look at them first. "
And Harry couldn't think of suppressing his feelings any longer. Every time he saw Draco with Teddy he saw a newer side of Draco which made him fall a little bit more. And even though he still felt unsure about confessing, he wanted Draco to be a bigger part of his life.
He had already told Ron and Hermione that he would like to be left alone and they had agreed with pained expressions. So he was on his way. He had decided to use to apparate but wanted spend a bit of time in the Forbidden Forest. The place he had last seen them.
"Sir I am getting lots of heat signals from that room."
"Alright, good night. "
"Doing well Gin.How's the shop?"
Yea nothing much had changed. Draco would worry about the guild and Potter tomorrow. Tonight he was going get smashed with his gang.<3
"Pinky pwomise."
"Draco darling I know you are small but it is okay to love who you want no matter the gender."
Harry knew he was staring but he still couldn't stop. Draco was wearing a white suit that glimmered silver with every move and blood red tie which made him look just as dangerous as he was. His beauty was truly a double edged sword.
He followed her inside the big but warm manor unlike the forgotten one in Wiltshire. He entered the garden and saw Narcissa tending to a rose bush.
"I know you would but why me?"
"Ch.. Yes.... Of course.. They were beautiful! "
When he reached the door he didn't know whether it'll open after the fire. But just after pacing there a bit the door opened slowly. As he entered he saw the room was full of Gryffindor colours but slowly some of the things started turning into the Slytherin shade.  Well it could certainly be worse.
"Yea so what did he think about the costumes? "
Draco had already told Harry that pansy would be visiting Harry in Halloween morning for the costumes so he had visited his parents a bit early. He excitedly told them about his recent developments and how he wished they could meet him. He also told them about the charms(leaving the actual details obviously) and the fact he was a bit nervous about tonight. So he might've been a bit late to see Pansy waiting for him by the fireplace.
"Wait when?"
"I love it! Thank you so much for today, if you ever need my help just ask. "
"What? "
With a glimmer in his eyes Malfoy smiled softly. "Of course Potter. "
"Oh uhhh.. yeah mm truth wait no dare."
After they were done Harry was surprised by his reflection. His eyes had a smoky red glow and a little bit of.. Glitter? And his lips looked so red he thought he might've bit it. He seriously couldn't help but hug Pansy out of joy and kept on thanking her until she sent him to get into his costume.
"GAH! I hate hangovers."
"Yeah even I can't believe it."
"How are you Draco?"
"Granger!!"
"No, not at all. Remember I use to stalk you in 6th year? "
"Hmmm.. Oh just that we will continue this later. "
"Enjoy lover boy. And if you both decide not to take each other's clothes off we are over there. "
He heard a gasp from Potter as he looked around them. The dark forest with only some candles floating with all the bats flying was definitely spooky. But he use to come here all the time and after staying in the Manor with that Mouldy snake, he could stay in the forest for the whole night. And the privacy was just a bonus.
"Draco the others are on their way so we will be waiting  for you in the parlour."
"Good evening, Malfoy."
"Remember the Ministry making the first page for weeks after a huge raid on Death Eaters? Well I think you already know not to trust the papers."
"Pumpkins Potter? "
"Well let's go back home Potter. "
"Scawy? "
“Truth or Dare, Malfoy ?”
"So Potter, you coming? "
"Yess Uncle Dwaco. "
"I love you"
Harry was beyond pissed! He was on his desk which was piled up with open cases but the only thing on his mind were the notes. He couldn't understand why in the world was this happening to him. He thought Malfoy and him had at least gotten a little bit closer during the Eighth year and if he hadn't disappeared, right now they might've even be....unless it wasn't Malfoy and someone was impersonating him! Pulling his hair in frustration he looked up at the clock to check the time and it was almost quarter past 8.
As he reached the door he heard hushed voices behind it. So he leaned slightly on the door and tried not to make a sound.
And the scene inside amazed Harry. Literally each and every muggle was in a costume. Be it the vampire bouncer or the bartender as a ghost or the muggle girl in her cat costume. But before Harry could look at some more muggles Harry noticed Draco taking off his cloak. And he had to hold his breath when he saw his dragon's costume.
"A toast to that!"
"It's alright Nathan, he doesn't blame you."
"You'll spoil him! "
"Wait what? Isn't that a dare for Malfoy?"
"Wh.. What? "
"Wha.. eh."
"Hello, nice to meet you Nathan."
"They are not dead Blaise and I thought you like these sort of things?"
"Alright what's wrong?"
"Wait he was?"
"No Harry it can't."
He was about the crush it in his hand thinking the person was mocking him before he noticed a small mark in the corner. With a magnification charm he almost fell from his seat when he saw what it was.There in the corner of the paper, with green ink there was a small sketch of a Dragon. And that could only mean one thing. He couldn't help but smirk when he thought how Ron and Mione would react when they see they note because finally he could prove them wrong! Because Draco Sodding Malfoy was still ALIVE!
"Where were you? "
"Well I wanted to say a lot but Neville really wanted me to be there, so I just called her slippery like a snake trying to run away."
"For real? Like this is not a sting or something?"
“Hmm go sit with Blaise, I know you have been wanting since the start of the game.”
"Oh! So you're going to climb up and then change the whole system?"
“Well?”
"I shouldn't have left you alone and I seriously shouldn't have bitten you! "
To distract himself he started thinking about tonight. He couldn't believe he was finally going to go trick or treating with Teddy and he was still nervous about going clubbing with others. But since Draco would be there with him throughout the night he felt a bit relieved. And everytime he would think about him, he would remember the soft kiss and a light blush would appear on his face. And he was so lost thinking about his Draco that he didn't even notice Pansy was done until she coughed loudly.
"No..hngn no mother he is a boy and a mudblood!"
"Thanks."
"Dr.. Draco? "
"Yes you absolutely are, it's amazing Pansy! "
Harry was about to reach for his wand when he suddenly felt strong holding him. He suddenly felt the familiar warmth beside him and felt a little relaxed. And he was a bit startled by the angry voice from his dragon.
The change felt good. After Halloween they had gotten closer and Harry felt the boy under all those masks was pretty awesome. And if things had been a bit different in the past, it would have changed everything. He found Draco to be someone he could go and talk about his fears, someone who would listen, help him calm down and then give some advice.
"Yeah I understand how it looks but imagine being me. They think I got into the programme because of my special connections. And then finally when they think I'm capable someone starts solving all my important cases!"
"You know I had to know about the raid from Granger because even Weasley was smart enough to send something! "
And there was the most adorable nephew of his was standing with fluffed up cheeks and messy... Orange hair? And he couldn't help but call him to them, which he responded by slowly stumbling to him. And once he reached him, Draco picked up his sweet little honey bun and placed him between him and Harry and literally felt so happy that he almost let a tear slip. He pulled them both into a long hug before he could hear little Teddy's protests. Letting them go he gave a small kiss in Teddy's forehead and one on Harry's lips(which lasted a tad bit longer).
"That's actually not bad."
"Yea."
"Pansy shut up! Did you kiss?"
He hesitated before entering the bar. It was silent implying that it was empty but he let his memory guide him to the front bar where he saw Nott waiting for him. 'Ah! So there must be some security charms somewhere to inform him someone has entered.' He gave Nott a small smile and as he was about to let out all the questions he had Nott raised his hand to tell him to stop.
