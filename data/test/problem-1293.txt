“No questions, Potter! No questions!” Malfoy shouted, and then crouched down on the floor rocking back and forth.
, he just wasn’t entirely sure exactly what he wanted. And if he didn’t know, not exactly, how was he supposed to find the words to say that?
“Yeah, so I guess the police just found this whole group of people, like twelve of ‘em, all dead in a flat in Clapham. Neighbor’s called the police because of the smell. Apparently they all took some drug that poisoned them on Saturday.”
Draco looked at the girl who nodded at him; he nodded back. “Yeah, let’s keep you from Harry. It’s going to be okay, I promise.”
“No, your party.”
“Would you care to see the gardens, Astoria?” Draco asked suddenly, cutting off any potential disagreement.
She had to jump right in, didn’t she? Harry let out a long sigh. “I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him in a while.” Unless he wanted to count those dreams, but last night, there hadn’t been a lot of talking. There’d been a lot of noises, but most of them not words.
Once in the hall, he swallowed the lump in his throat and blinked his eyes--against the sharp light and for no other reason. He’d just have to think of something else, some other way to prove to everyone that he wasn’t just a muggle hating Death Eater.
“I love King’s Head.” Draco said once he was fully dressed and facing Sawyer.
If Draco wanted the two of them to thrive, he could not come back here again.
At the door, Harry held his hand out of Ajax. “Thank you for your time.” He didn’t say anything else, just waited to see if Ajax would take it.
The door was already open and a man in his fifties with greying hair was looking out at them. “The Missus put the pot on,” he said, holding the door open for both of them.
They slipped out the door into the warm air outside, and Harry took a deep breath that was grounding. Fortescue's was only a short walk away, and Ginny found a table outside while Harry went in and ordered two scoops of chocolate and then had a brief panic over whether it should be on cones or in cups, and settled for one of each, and he’d eat whichever one Ginny didn’t want. Stupid dietary restrictions.
“Just Malfoy.” Harry admitted.
“His name is Draco.” Teddy growled rudely.
Harry lurched forward and pressed his mouth to Draco’s, the only place where he felt like he could be who he was. And for a moment, Draco kissed back, opened his mouth, and welcomed Harry in, his mouth warm and safe, and for a moment Harry felt like he could crawl inside and keep the world at bay.
“Hm.” Draco pulled himself out of the bed, his good humor completely evaporated now.
“You can’t stay out here,” Harry insisted.
He banged on their bungalow door loudly, waited for a moment to see if someone would open it, and then started banging again almost immediately. He didn’t stop until Ron whipped the door away from him as he yanked it open. “Bloody hell, mate.” Ron rubbed his face and then turned back in towards the sofa. “Has somebody died?”
After pulling on some clean pants and a shirt, he spent several minutes looking over his clothes and trying to pick something for Malfoy rather than tell him he’d burned the brown robes. He settled on a pair of denims he’d never much cared for and a checked button down Ginny had bought him for Christmas when they’d still been dating. Harry’s shoulders had filled out a bit more since then, and it no longer fit properly. Hopefully it wouldn’t fall off of Malfoy.
It jerked Harry back into the present moment painfully. “So what if I am. He’s not the same arsehole he used to be.” He was a very different arsehole.
He fell into his seat, and Ginny sat down too so she could put a hand on his knee. “Feeling alright?”
She paused, hands still on his chest. “You could look at me.”
Ron gave a bland smile, cultivated over the last ten years of public events and over-zealous reporters. “Actually, that’s why I’ve come over here. Hermione was hoping to have a word with you regarding those laptops you requested. Something about delivery times.”
So Hermione thought Malfoy was clever. Harry had seen praise for his work in the probation reports, but it was weightier to hear Hermione say it “I guess that explains Atkinson, but it doesn’t explain why Malfoy would steal something, especially as it seems like he could have made a career there after his community service.” Harry piled some more rice on his plate.
“I swear I will! I will shout it out here in the hall until every fucking person in this building knows. And then I’m going to march out into the street and shout until everyone there hears. I’m going to take out an advert in every fucking paper!”
“Hello.” Draco greeted them, clasping forearms with Cade and Vale, peeking Faye on the cheek, and laughing at Florence’s raised eyebrows.
Jenkins, in her infinite wisdom, called in every customs agent she could get her hands on, even the muggle ones. After all, they didn’t need to know exactly what contraband they were looking for, just what it looked like.
And that was when Tilly started to understand. “I hate this,” she said loudly to Draco.
Draco reached up and grabbed Potter by the shirt, bared his teeth, and said, “There’s a lot you don’t know about him.” And he shoved Potter away.
Draco knelt down in front of him, took Teddy’s hands in his, and Teddy squeezed with more strength then a six year old should have. “It’s the moon, you know, it’s going to be all gone on Sunday. That’s why you feel like this, itchy and tired and wanting to be near your family.”
Who was breathing, but his shirt and pants were stiff with dried blood. “What happened?” Harry asked, knowing there wouldn’t be an answer.
So Harry talked to Robards and owled McGonagall, filled out some paperwork, and by the end of the day everyone was in agreement. Jude would return to Hogwarts via a ministry floo at 9am on Wednesday morning and then spend the summer with Harry at Grimmauld Place. His return would be early compared to the other students who had chosen to go home for the Easter Holiday, but it would also give him time to settle in. And Robards gave Harry guardianship paperwork to fill out and all of Tuesday off to gather all the school supplies Jude would need. It took all day, but by the end of the day on Monday, Harry and Jude returned to Grimmauld Place.
Harry gave Val a look to get her to back off. “Walk me through the day Sawyer went missing.”
“I don’t like it, Potter. That’s a lot of Were’s out there. How are we supposed to patrol for all that?”
“Yeah,” Draco nodded down the bar where Evan was frowning fantastically. “Evan and I work them out together. Would you like to try one?”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “It was all blood. A lot of dragon, Roxi and I think it was the Peluda blood he was after. They found some phoenix, some unicorn. Yours.
And then everyone was getting up, having their assignments, and Val was looking at Harry who was stuffing the toxicology report into his pocket. She raised her eyebrows, and Harry shook his head. This was definitely not the place he wanted to have this conversation. They gathered their things and apparated to West End.
But Malfoy didn’t look at him, eyes still wild, hand now scratching at his left arm through the robes. “Three meals. There’s always breakfast, but never lunch. Too much work for lunch. Have to do the work. Have to be good. Follow the rules, do the research. Don’t question. Don’t answer. Need to find-need to find.” Harry’s stomach started to clench up.
Faye raised her chin. “Yes, it is how you do things. And if I recognized your authority, that might be important, but I do not. For months, this miscreant has been terrorizing us, and your Aurors did nothing. In fact, as I understand, your Aurors do not even recognize his crimes as murder.” All the wolves behind her growled angrily.
efforts to keep the streets safe.
“I can speak for no Pack but my own.” Faye stared at Williams unblinkingly. “And I have come here, to this place where I am so distinctly unwelcome for everything that I am, to assist you in your goal of ruling over a peaceful city. I cannot speak for other Alphas, but I can tell you that we are angry, that the recent events, the murders of my brothers and sisters have made it clear to all of us how little
“Good,” Hermione said brightly. “Because Robards is not going to let you in the room, and I am going to have to pick my battles here.”
And Harry jerked back as if stung. “You wouldn’t--no one would let a monster like him do that.”
Draco looked back one last time before walking out the door. 4:35, he was going to be late. Not a lot, but enough to put Neil in a sour mood. He shoved his hands in his pockets, nothing to be done about that now.
Reluctantly, Hermione began to gather her own quills and parchment. “I’ve worked so hard on this. And Shacklebolt is starting to make headway with repealing the AntiWere Legislation, but none of that will make a bit of difference if we can’t get them to agree with us. Reopening the Werewolf Support Services is supposed to help them. I want to help them. Why won’t they let me help them?” she whined as she pushed everything into her briefcase
“That was awful. My
“Tell me it feels wrong,” Harry insisted.
Draco gave Harry a look that clearly said Harry was a moron. “What are you? A moron? Discretion would be a key aspect of my life.”
“Are you going to make me drink it?”
“Hmm,” Harry agreed, more asleep than awake.
“Oh.” Harry frowned again.
“He’s got a thing about scents,” Andromeda said by way of explanation, and Draco realized she didn’t know. Didn’t understand what her grandson was.
Jude clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “We all do things in the heat of the moment that we don’t remember later. If you want Draco to be kissing you, then maybe you should just tell him. Like a man.”
Luckily, the bar was just busy enough to be distracting, and worrisome thoughts about Neil and Harry and accidental magic prone werewolves got buried under a pile of tabs and dirty glasses. It worked really well until Sophie came in for a short shift and said something about a drunk in the alley.
Val braced herself.
Harry licked his lips, and unconsciously Draco followed the movement, remembered licking those same lips. “Come home with me.”
It was like being back at Hogwarts: Harry tried to pay attention, but was too hungry to really listen. He stalked around the back of the room, shoving appetizers into his mouth as quickly and discreetly as he could before it was his turn to walk up on stage.
He groaned loudly.
“I am sorry I didn’t tell you, but I was trying to respect his privacy. I am sorry Teddy dragged Rosie up here to meet him, but I promise you, she was never in any danger. Do you think I would let someone dangerous live in the same house as Teddy?”
“Don’t what?”
Draco shook his head, and then corrected himself. “I mean, he came into my interrogation room, but not since then.” He swallowed and pulled himself up. Better not to think about that interruption.
Harry wasn’t exactly in a good mood when he arrived at work an hour later. Malfoy had used up all the hot water and then proceeded to sit, cross-legged, on the balcony floor bickering with himself, which Harry only knew because he spent several minutes trying to break into the argument to find out if Malfoy wanted some eggs which resulted in a loud shout of “Fucking Questions!” At which point Harry slammed the door shut and tried to drown himself in coffee.
At the very edge of the crowd, he nearly tripped over Malfoy who still had that determined look on his face. He didn’t look like he wanted to sneer at all. He looked tall and lean, and he was wearing that dark grey jumper he’d worn to the Stubborn Goat.
“They’ll all be here soon,” Harry whispered to Draco.
“Ah,” Madam Malkin smiled. “I’ll need to take his measurements, but I’ve some about his size already stitched up in the back. Give me a moment.” She disappeared, and Harry lingered by the counter, catching snatches of the conversation between Malfoy and Jude.
Draco nodded. “There are proprietary aspects to the potions as well. Those I have pre brewed and should arrive at the end of the week. I am, of course, happy to answer any questions you have about the process for the rest.”
Malfoy didn’t speak, but nodded once, slowly. Harry didn’t say anything as he left the room. It was against policy to leave anyone alone with evidence, so Harry stepped into the adjoining room, to watch through the spelled wall. But he left the sound off, he could give Malfoy that privacy. It felt right.
“Top drawer.” He nodded towards his nightstand, and Draco reached around to open it. Harry’s hands never stopped stroking.
Malfoy was bent over at the waist with his head stuck up the chimney, presumably to inspect the floo. Harry’s mouth went a little dry, the way it seemed to be doing more and more often lately, at the sight of his arse. He had on joggers, and Harry distinctly liked the look of Malfoy in joggers. It should have been odd to see him padding about the house in just the trousers, but with his hair on the shaggier side and the earring--he just looked so casual. So unlike the Malfoy from school who wouldn’t have dared be seen in something so muggle.
“You don’t know that.” Harry mumbled sleepily
She backed off, her own face going slack and regretful. “You’re right. I should know better than that.” She looked at Draco. “If you change your mind about brewing--”
It was better this way. He didn’t want to encourage Harry, Harry had a life there, was an Auror, needed to look after Jude
Harry nodded, because that was the best he could do. He couldn’t make promises, certainly not about skinning a man, but he was sure as hell going to do everything he could to bring whoever did this to justice. “Thanks for coming in, Malfoy. Is there some way I can reach you if I have more questions?”
Malfoy jerked up and said stupidly, “What?”
“Hold on tight,” Harry whispered.
After a moment, Neil finally spoke. “Well, I guess you can make it up to me later. Come sit down, we’re listening to covers and originals and deciding who did it better.” He scooted over and patted the small space between him and the arm rest.
They both paused as Andromeda opened the front door and a large group of people stepped inside. They were boisterous and jostling each other as she led them down the hall and through the kitchen into the dining room.
“Is there someone else there?” Harry asked. Because whoever Drace had brought home was neither subtle nor quiet.
“Sounds good.”
Malfoy turned on the sofa to Harry. “See, she thinks I’m adorable.”
Draco leaned forward onto his elbows, hands clenched between his knees, not really seeing, not really hearing. His healer was calling to another, something about his magical core reading as unsteady. And Harry pushed himself up to sit, made to stand, but then Robards was next to him. “Take it easy, Harry.”
“Oh, uh, I just don’t want to be out late.”
felt good to pull that moment out of Harry every single time.
“How?” Dean was breathless, his voice a bare whisper as he leaned against the bars.
“How is that even possible?” Harry asked.
She rolled her eyes again. “And to give you something.” Faye gestured behind her where two wolves dragged an only slightly mauled body forward to dump it on the ground to her left. “We’ve done your work for you, found the wolf killer and given him justice.”
By the time the food was cooked, the tension in the room had dropped marginally, and they were both able to sit in front of the telly to eat without fighting. Harry had cleaned the bathroom after flipping the chicken. He tried not to think about what had caused Malfoy to bleed all over everything.
Draco squeezed his eyes tight and then blinked them open. “Alright, Granger. I’ll try.” God, Sawyer had never asked him to do shit like this! And then, he thought, but maybe if Sawyer had he would have felt part of Ajax’s Pack the way he felt here in Grimmauld Place. He opened the door and stepped out into the hall. “I’m going to eat, Granger. You could join us.”
Evan popped open a bottle of champagne, while Draco fussed with his phone and the sound system. And then Tilly laughed as Draco pulled her in for a dance, spinning her about the tables and laughing and smiling so hard he thought his heart just might burst out of his chest. And then, Draco pulled Tilly in close and crooned in her ear, “I love you, baby.”
He saw Hermione and Ron arrive a few minutes later, Ron pulling at the collar of his dress robes and looking uncomfortable. They joined the end of the receiving line, and that was when Harry realized that Draco and Astoria had not.
Draco scowled at her.
“Really?” Sarah asked, disbelief and hope coloring her words.
But Harry understood why Draco felt so insecure even if he didn’t agree with it in the slightest. “Can you just lay off?” Harry scowled. “I’ve been dealing with this all week, and I just wanted to have a nice night with my best mate where I didn’t have to listen to anyone tell me my boyfriend is going to flee the country.”
Namita Malhotra, Head Sorceress, stood to address the crowd. “What is on the docket today, Scribe?”
Her words were reasonable. All of those things about Malfoy were true, but why give him anything? Why trust him at all in that case? He threw in his powder and then stepped out of Hermione and Ron’s fireplace. “I’m not trying to pick a fight, I’m just saying I don’t think he is the same.”
Which was stupid, he reminded himself sternly, because it had only been twenty-four hours. Harry slipped the mobile back into his pocket, and went back inside to his friends.
On Thursday, Harry Potter was seen exiting the esteemed Trinkets carrying a suspiciously small bag. Has our Hero decided it’s time to settle down with his beautiful girlfriend, Ginny Weasley? Here at the Daily Prophet, we sincerely hope so. It’s time for a little happiness to shine down on Harry Potter, and what could be happier than the sound of wedding bells?
This time? But Harry wanted him to start something, wanted Draco’s attention on him not Tetchy Bloke. He wanted to feel Draco pressed against him, like that time Draco had shoved him down on the sofa  and ridden him so slowly Harry had thought he’d go mad before he came. Wanted to feel the line of Malfoy’s throat underneath his hands, to watch him come apart, to wreck him!
“It’s not a problem, Gin. I just didn’t know. It’s great, really. Really great. I’m excited for you.”
“In all honesty?” Draco opened both eyes and gave Dean a critical look. “I give it fifty-fifty.” He was too lonely and not angry enough yet to play this game.
“We went to Central Park!” Harry exclaimed, happy to have found some touristy thing they had done. “And we visited all these tiny restaurants in his neighborhood.” That was mostly because Hermione and Ron had insisted Draco give them all kinds of recommendations.
Grace nodded. “Have you heard from him?”
The bartender looked at him, and then immediately turned away. Which was odd because he had quite happily served Draco several times already. Draco leaned across the bartop and called loudly, “Hey, I’d like another, if you don’t mind.”
It was a relief when Jenkins’ patronus arrived.
“I agree.” Harry gave her a small but genuine smile, and she, in what must have been a strange fit of camaraderie, gave him one in return.
She flopped down on the sofa, head in his lap, feet hanging over the arm. “You’re the best, you know. The absolute best.”
“You didn’t,” Draco sat up and took Harry’s hand. “That’s what I’m saying, you didn’t do anything I didn’t want. And he didn’t either.”
Malfoy nodded, and Harry marveled at how not awkward the exchange was. “Going to Hogwarts, are you?”
Draco nodded and sat up, eyes carefully taking in the dark room. “Where am I?”
And he could hear them coming down the hall now.
“Stay,” Harry repeated.
Harry summoned the sofa closer to the door and then laid Malfoy down in the moonlight. It turned his hair silver and he looked relaxed. Harry smoothed Malfoy’s hair back off his forehead, and Malfoy turned his face to press a kiss into Harry’s hand. “Good man. Wish--wish--” He was drifting off, and Harry never did hear the end of the sentence. Or maybe Malfoy was just making sounds. It seemed impossible to know.
Harry turned around to see Draco standing behind him. He looked--he looked good in charcoal trousers and a white shirt with the top button undone. “Potter?”
Harry said, “We’re just looking.”
“Says the girl who lived with Greyback, who faced down Aurors in their own territory, who lived on her own for years.” Draco wasn’t trying to be dismissive, but he was trying to point out that she was being silly.
And Harry set aside the papers for good for the evening. “Harry,” Malfoy tilted his head back, and Harry just knew he was doing that thing with his throat on purpose. As if he knew Harry had a fixation on Malfoy’s throat, on the delicate lines, on the easy way he could wrap his hands around and squeeze, or perhaps just lick. “How do you know Ginny? Should I be jealous?”
And Draco imagined Harry pressing all this-this fear back into his chest, back underneath that good, strong hand. Because Harry was strong enough to hold back the tide, and no matter how he had left bruises and blood and scars across Draco’s body, Harry was still the place he felt safest. Harry would get Greyback and keep the whole city safe; he would keep Tilly and Evan safe even if he didn’t know he was doing it.
Draco looked down at where their fingers were still entwined. “That’s what I’m learning at therapy.”
They were close enough to the table that Ginny, Hermione, Neville and Hannah could all hear, and Ginny immediately came to Harry’s defense. “He was just defending himself. Harry would never start a fight.”
“It’s an internet cafe.”
“Professor Brambleberry has agreed to allow her into his first year potions class, with an additional remedial session every week. Herbology and Astronomy are no problem at all. But we are still trying to devise a strategy for what we are going to call Wandwork.”
“I do not.” She frowned a bit. “I spend most of my time assisting Mother with her charities and visiting with friends.”
So, he was lying on his bed, listening to music when Harry suddenly appeared in the doorway. He yanked the headphones down around his neck.
“No, Harry is still abed, and I don’t think his guest will be terribly happy to speak with you without Harry.”
Andromeda stood behind them, pushed through, knocking Alice’s gaze from Harry, comforting hand brushing Hermione’s arm, a nod at Val. She crossed the room and stood next to Harry. “I will stay. He will not be alone, and you will come back.”
Jude got up from his desk and made for the main lobby, and Harry realized if Jude was going for the apparition point, then there was no way Harry would be able to follow him. But if Jude went right, towards the floos, then Harry would be able to at least listen in for a lead.
“How do you live that close to him and not know about it?” Val asked as they started down the road towards Thirst.
“Potter!” Robards shouted, and all of Harry’s attention flicked to him. “If you continue in this matter--”
Harry laid on the floor for a moment and breathed deeply.
And Harry remembered that hot humid air that he couldn’t quite suck into his lungs. The air was still hot and humid here, and there wasn’t a breeze, not in between the two buildings, but Draco looked cool and calm like an updraft on a bright, sunny day, the kind that carried anyone flying up so easily. Harry closed his eyes. Had it been that sort of day when those two brothers had gotten their strange flying contraption up in the air?
“Would you say including hyssop as an ingredient then is not something many brewers would do?”
“I don’t care!”
He stood near the door and watched as Malfoy tossed his head a bit, and the bartender smiled and rolled his eyes before pouring a pint. It struck Harry then, how normal Malfoy looked, like any boy in the city, maybe just off work and looking to wind down, or a Uni student waiting for friends. Maybe waiting for a date? Maybe dating the bartender.
“Oh, thank Merlin. I know Molly taught me that spell, the one that gets rid of mold, but I can’t remember it.”
Draco looked at the girl who breathed in and out. “Okay. I can do this,” she told him, nodding and looking reassuring.
“Even if I knew, I wouldn’t tell you,” Faye replied calmly.
“Why muggle?”
Two grilled cheese sandwiches and two cups of soup later, they both sat down at the table to eat. Malfoy didn’t touch the sandwich, and drank only half the soup, but he settled as he ate. His eyes focused, and he didn’t mutter at all. Instead, he was silent and still, and it was disconcerting after so much movement.
Harry shook his head. “Yeah, that's exactly what I want to deal with, Henri and Draco. And let’s not forget how much Draco loves Luis who is over there now.”
He stared at the base of his martini glass, running a finger up and down the stem, suddenly all nerves and uncertainty. Harry was silent as he sipped his beer, hand fussing with something in the pocket of his hoodie. And Draco didn’t know how to break this silence, didn’t really understand what this moment was about, hadn’t understood what Potter had been asking when he’d asked Draco here.
Harry found a seat near Val in the back of the conference room and assumed his usual slouch.
“Oh my god, it was so gross. I guess he’s got an extra sensitive stomach or something because it was full on projectile, poor bloke sprayed some unsuspecting girl a full meter away!”
“No!” Draco cried and launched himself at Luis.
“Draco, dear, are you alright?” Narcissa asked, genuine concern in her voice.
Dan led Harry out the front door by the hand. The night had turned cold, and Harry’s hand turned cold in Dan’s. It felt wrong, and Harry paused. He’d done this before, picked up someone at a pub and taken them back to his place. It had always been nice, but empty. And Harry thought about it, orgasms were definitely nice, but he was getting those from Malfoy. And, okay, yeah, that was definitely wrong, and a violation of several department policies, and it was Malfoy.
He turned back towards her, looked her in the eye. “I bet he’s got mood swings too.” He said as quietly as he could.
Draco nodded stiffly and then turned to his generator, picking up a tool he didn’t need just to have something in his hand. He didn’t look away until he heard the door open and shut.
Roxi stepped a little closer. “Why do you smell like Clorox?”
“Yeah,” Harry and Jude made their way up to the register, and Malfoy lingered by the door.
Malfoy startled. “No, it’s normal. I’m always this warm at the new moon and the full moon.”
He growled a little at the thought and knocked Malfoy’s hand away so that he could wrap both hands across his stomach and chest and feel the long line of the scar that had torn him apart, left him a puddle on the bathroom floor, and
“Usually, when I talk about this kind of stuff, I’m drunk or in the middle of a panic attack or talking to my therapist. I lack the skills needed for your crisis.”
Draco was at the table with a large bowl of apples, cutting off long strips of peel. Harry took the seat next to him in front of the cutting board. “I want to be her when I grow up,” he said in a whisper.
Malfoy looked at Harry in something that resembled terror.
Mournfully, Hugo and Rose let go of Harry. “Come on, Hugo,” Rose said kindly to her brother. “Mum’s a bit tetchy.”
“But you did it.”
“What?” Faye asked, but Vale was glowering at Draco.
There were dances of grace, of sensuality, of lingering touches and gentle temptations. But Draco had never been one for grace or gentility. He pulled the man close, his thigh grinding indecently, his hand teasing along the back of his neck, his breath a ghosting touch along his lips. And the man’s eyes were wide, blown open with lust or with the heady feeling in the room, but open all the same. And Draco lost himself in those eyes, in the sway and grind, desire pooling low and heavy.
Draco hesitated for a moment longer, and then clasped his hand tightly. “Okay. I can try.”
“It might not be a great place to meet people, but Tilly is great at her job. She practically runs that place now.” He looked over, and she was smiling at him.
Malfoy peeked out. “Potter, what are you doing here?”
“What about owls?”
“Hello Ginny,” Harry replied, and she slipped her hand in his. It was warm and slight against his larger hand, and Harry curled his hand around her fingers to protect them from the cold.
Teddy sniffed, tears gathering in his eyes, and nodded.
Ginny stood up on the bench. “Oy! Oliver! He’s got a boyfriend so piss off!”
“He isn’t like that!” Tilly yelled, stepping forward and distracting Emma.
Harry could barely hear his words over the roaring in his ears. His heart pounded painfully in his chest, working overtime for each bit of oxygen. His arms and legs stumbled and stuttered their way after Draco, sluggish and heavy, almost drunken. Even his vision seemed blurred a bit at the corners. He swiped at his eyes.
“I promise.” The words were teary and nearly unintelligible. “But I don’t want you to leave.”
Harry watched him type into the boxes, not at all interested in the things he was looking up but deeply interested in the way he pushed his face just a little bit closer to the screen when he read. At the way he stared so intensely at the words, trying to parse out meanings and clicking on links to understand new words. At the surprisingly deft way his fingers moved over the keyboard.
“I don’t know who you’re--there’s no one here by that name--I--”
“Yes,” Hermione admitted, because these things would always be two steps forward and one step back. Opening lines of communication did not mean that it would be smooth sailing from here on.
His steps were loud in the small space, and abruptly Harry turned, eyes zeroing in on Draco. Draco didn’t let the strength of that gaze deter him as he walked forward. He could always leave, just walk away and text Tilly. He had options.
“He’s a right fucker, isn’t he.” Roxi sighed again. “I’m guessing he didn’t explain that it’s his life’s work to fight against wizarding prejudices against muggles. That’s why he’s been so keen to get this computer thing working, it’s why he wanted to reveal it in England, where those prejudices run so deep. Where he has personal experience. And it doesn’t really matter why someone trashed his lab there, he probably thinks the project is going to be canceled, and he won’t be able to promote muggle/magical integration in a place that produced one of the most racist wizards in a century.”
Maybe it went all the way back to that first day in Diagon Alley?
Draco heard the door open, heard the locks clicking as the knob turned, and then he smelled him. He smelled him even before he could see him, the dirt under his nails, the musk of him, and there was just the faintest hint of something that reminded Draco of his mother. He thought his heart might stop as he realized just who this tiny person was, why he smelled like home, like Pack. Draco looked up at his wild tangle of black hair, at the green of his eyes, at the shape of his jaw. He could feel the tendrils of his magic as it reached out, questioning, searching, but Draco ignored them
He turned back to Granger. “Well, since I’m apparently not leaving and I refuse to wake Potter, I guess we should talk.” He took a seat on the sofa and gestured towards the chair across from him.
He turned to her with a bitter smile. “Dead. Murdered. This is detective Potter and--” He gestured to Val and then looked at her. “I don’t know your name.” his lips curled angrily.
“People ask,” Ginny insisted. “I don’t like it. Just come out with us.”
“You really are telling the truth about the dreams.” Dean sighed and Draco said nothing. “My affair with Ginny, you could have told your lawyer and let it come out during a trial, created reasonable doubt. But you didn’t do that. Why not?”
“It’s spelled for you. We can’t read it.” Weasley sighed loudly. “We need you to read the letter to us.”
“Then let me clean off the blood.”
And then Harry grinned up at him. “You’ll need lube. There’s oil on the counter.” Malfoy’s hand shook as he reached out for the bottle. “Coat your fingers.” Draco drizzled the oil slowly over his long middle finger, careful not to let a drop hit the floor. “Oh god, you’re going to be amazing at this.” Harry watched, eyes glued to those long fingers, moving slowly, surely, to keep from dripping on the floor. “Come here.”
Draco sighed. “If you want to talk, we’ll have to talk and walk--I’m late.”
It was on the tip of Draco’s tongue to make a withering comment about small talk, but then he remembered he was trying not to piss off all the people around him here or get fired or end up accused of something outlandish. Although, he thought with a wry smile, something reasonable would not be amiss. “Not much change from last night. The bitter root will need to steep for another eighteen hours or so and then I can begin distilling it. I’ve started the second part, but it also needs to steep for twenty hours.”
For a long moment Draco didn’t move, held himself rigid, but he didn’t push away. And Harry waited. He waited for the moment that Draco relaxed against him and gave in. “I’ll stay with you the whole time. It won’t be bad. It’ll be loud, and everyone will want to meet you, but there will be the kids and they’re plenty distracting. The attention won’t be on you for long.” Harry brushed his nose into the short hairs at the base of Malfoy’s neck.
“I am not going to let him put her in danger!”
“Want to come with me to get the food?” Malfoy scowled, and Harry raised his hands in defeat. “I know, ‘Questions, Potter. Questions.’ I’m an Auror, we’re supposed to ask questions.” He gave another loud sigh. “I’m going; I’ll be back in fifteen. Try not to ruin anything while I’m gone.” Was that a guilty expression on Malfoy’s face? Harry walked out the door before he could think about it any more.
He turned and faced Draco. “Draco. How are you?”
Harry blinked rapidly and filled his lungs with air as he suddenly remembered to breathe. “You have a nightmare, and you come here to read about Muggle things?”
Jude put in his notice with Records, and Harry knew he should be upset about that, but whenever he saw the backs of their heads as they sat on the sofa not talking, just leaning in towards each other, he understood. Sometimes, when he’d been particularly quiet, Harry would lean against the doorframe for a moment, and just look at the way the two of them leaned towards each other, soaking up the presence of the other.
He paused in the parlour to ruffle Teddy’s hair and drop a quick kiss on his head, and then he went upstairs. He took them slowly, one at a time, listening to each creak and sigh of the wood under his weight.  Harry wanted him to be safe, to be home--he couldn’t have expressed his caring any more loudly than if he had taken out a television ad.
“Uh, that’s Arthur’s,” Harry said. “He likes to work on some projects.” But Draco was already walking towards the doors and slipping inside.
“Hello?” he said, because it was 8:04am and Harry hadn’t had enough tea yet.
Malfoy leaned forward, tilted his head up to stare at Harry and then said, “We’re in public.”
From his place on the floor, Draco couldn’t quite see what Luis was doing, and common sense warred with fear. He was doing something, and Draco couldn’t be prepared to face it if he didn’t know what it was. On the other hand, if he didn’t see it, then, even if it was only for a moment longer, he could pretend it wasn’t there.
When Ajax let go, Draco slid down the wall to crumple on the floor.
“A month?” Harry asked, surprised. “Are you sure?”
Harry didn’t care much for this part of the job either, although he didn’t like it for muggles or magical people. He’d had more than enough death for this lifetime. He nodded at Val and they walked over to the door where Harry pressed the intercom button.
“Chocolate?”
Those cool fingers rested lightly on the back of his neck. “You should sleep.”
“I’d like to go sometime. Sounds sort of perfect for you.”
Harry glared at his feet, “I hate you.” He handed over £2 and moved down the line away from that horribly embarrassing moment.
For a moment he didn’t think Draco would answer, and then, he pushed the martini glass across the counter. “I don’t like fire,” he admitted finally.
“Got it!” Draco shook his head at her, and then led Harry into the room to the left. “I don’t know what that is,” he whispered as they walked down a row of computers and then sat down at one by the window.
“That’s why we bought them.” Harry dug around in the cupboard for his instant coffee.
“I wouldn’t do that to a little girl.” Draco scowled. “Well, I might if I was really angry, but then I would feel really bad about it. I wouldn’t want to do that to Lily.”
Draco’s eyes darted up to him, and Harry realized Draco had been avoiding his gaze the whole meal. He reached forward and picked up his own, still mostly full plate. “No.” The chair scrapped angrily across the floor as he stood, at least, Harry thought it sounded angry. “Please excuse me.”
“I’m really not that interesting.” Harry muttered and took too big a swallow.
Around 1am, Jenkins tapped Draco on the shoulder. “Go home, get some sleep. More ships coming in tomorrow.”
Roxi sat down on the side of the bed, never releasing his hand. She reached up with her free hand and tugged his earring. “What kind of asshole are you today?”
“You abandoned your partner in order to fight with teenage muggle students while your partner chased the actual people involved and faced down two Werewolves on his own
“What materials are you missing? If you need something sooner, you need only tell me.” Hermione insisted.
“That is Harry’s MO,” Ginny teased.
Draco could see a mug in the sink and wondered if it was dirty. “You don’t know that.”
“Quiet you,” she shushed. “Let me see your chest.” Her hands were quick and light as she undid the buttons of his shirt.
“Oh, no, I just thought it was nice, and that maybe--”
Harry tried to keep his expression neutral. He didn’t want some big epic thing, he’d much rather not have a party at all. Apparently he wasn’t that good at keeping things off his face though because Ron was cocking his head to the side and giving him this assessing look, like he did at work when looking at the crucial piece of evidence. “You don’t want to go.”
Vale stared at her indignantly. “I think we had more than enough excitement that night.” He shuddered and muttered, “Aurors.”
Draco sucked the last of the liquid up through the straw, found his quarry, and left his fears for Granger as well as the highball glass behind. He was younger then Draco, but not by much, and he danced with a wild abandon that spoke more of enthusiasm than skill. He had long curly hair, the kind perfect for tangling in hands. Draco made his way through the crowd, shimmying around and away from clinging hands until he reached his destination.
“It’s just a letter, Dray.” But Tilly stood at the counter, looking at the strange paper from the corner of her eye, as if it might suddenly flap in her face.
“That’s what you did last year.”
“How do you know?”
Draco closed his eyes but gripped her tight. He ignored the storm and thought only of Grace’s hands, of the way they were a little dry from all of the hand washing, but warm and strong. There were calluses because she worked hard, and a small cut around the bed of her nail, long since stopped bleeding but not healed yet. Draco thought of the wound and felt the lightning flicker from him to her, flicker through the wound and knit it together.
“Oh,” Narcissa replied. “I hadn’t realized you had plans for this afternoon.”
Harry let out a sigh of relief. The Leaky.
When Draco stepped up to the counter, he slipped the earbuds from his ears, the faint music still audible, and said, “Yes, I’d like to make a withdrawal from my vault, 98. And can I get that in pounds?”
Vale settled slightly as everyone else nodded.
Draco closed his eyes and felt the storm. It had peaked, the rain was not so strong in him, and the wind more gentle, and the thunder softer. “It’s passing, but not gone. I’d like to stay a little longer.”
“Okay,” Jude held up a calming hand. “Well, I think it’s like that other stuff, just, you know, more?”
Eventually, Ginny noticed. “Who’s that?” and pointed straight at Draco.
“But I’m still hungry!” Teddy pushed futilely at Draco’s arm. He was biting his lip and trying to stare Malfoy down.
“Well,” Draco drew out the word slowly, seductively. “I saw him last night at the bar, all that messy hair, the kind that’s perfect for pulling on when he went down on me.”
“You love me. Put on
“Harry!” Draco cried.
Draco looked Harry in the eye, glanced at the two cups of coffee, and then ignored both of them in favor of unlocking the front door. “Just what brings you to my doorstep at this godforsaken hour?” he asked once they were both inside.
Harry took a deep breath and then stepped into the room. “Sorry.”
Draco draped an arm over her shoulder and looked back at the screen. “Yeah, me too.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry held his hands up, “But I think Rosie needs to go back to Hermione now.” He took a step forward. Draco didn’t move, but that was okay, because he was the only thing keeping Rosie on the bed. “Rosie, Rosie, it’s okay. I’m going to take you to your Mum now. You want your Mum don’t you.”
Out in the hall, Harry quickly shoved the tote at Thompson, and put a hand on James’s forearm. “If you’ll come with me, I’ll take you to the cell.”
And Draco swayed back. It might not have seemed like much, but falling a handspan or more until landing against Harry, not knowing--not for certain--for that brief moment that Harry would wrap his hands underneath Draco’s arms and around his chest. Hoping against hope that Harry would pull him close, would put his chin on Draco’s shoulder and spread his fingers wide across his chest, possessive and claiming.
“We were both in the laundry room. She helped me with the coins.” Malfoy put the basket down inside the bedroom and walked over to the balcony door. His happy demeanor was quickly dissipating.
Draco froze without turning to face it. He never faced the door if he could help it, finding the movement of people and voices distracting, but he often left the door open as an indicator that he was receptive to work related interruptions. Which meant whoever had knocked on his door felt he wouldn’t welcome the interruption.
Harry hadn’t, but Val was nodding. “If you and Ajax didn’t get along, how did that work with Sawyer?”
“But not about Pack.” Malfoy went back to scraping his nails along the cup. “I can’t tell you that. I can tell you they wouldn’t have done something like this.”
“But he wants me to tend bar?” Draco asked in clarification. Sometimes he couldn’t tell what Johnson wanted when he shouted and barked.
The question was what, what was so important that Malfoy felt it necessary to keep from Atkinson?
“Hate me all you want,” Malfoy said, back to crouching on the sofa and staring at the news. If he said anything else, Harry couldn’t hear it.
“What did you do?” He asked, wiped his face on his shirt and then looking through the room which was now filled with Aurors poking through the evidence. And Robards was talking loudly while Ron quietly pulled Atkinson to standing.
“10 o’clock.” Potter said, hand on the door.
She was discharged later that evening, all the tests normal, and Ron nervously hovering. Harry had put the note in his pocket and kept running his hand along the fold while they ate curry again. Ron tucked Hermione into bed, and Harry took the mobile. He said good night when Ron came back down the stairs, and apparated to Grimmauld Place where he stood on the street and made a phone call.
“Are you sure?” She finished up the second set and reached into her bag for gauze to bandage Draco’s arm.
“My judgement!” A man who picked a quill over a biro clearly had some judgement issues of his own. “You think Longbottom will be more impartial?”
He sent the rest of the Aurors out to their patrols, while Harry and Val followed him to his office. “I hate the fellytone,” he grumbled as he shut the door. “Alright, so, a Mr. and Mrs. Green in Chigwell reported that their son Sawyer ran away from home four years ago at the age of seventeen.”
“Oh,” Harry picked up the pace, not quite running, but definitely moving at a good clip into the parlour. If he could get Sarah into Hogwarts, then she wouldn’t be available for Robards to manipulate.
Harry scoffed. There was no way he could make it through a whole dinner with Malfoy, even under the pretense of completing his order. The next day, another note arrived. It was Harry’s favorite so far.
But an unyielding hand grasped Harry’s chin and forced him to look again at his snarling friend. They were so close that a fleck of spittle landed on Harry’s cheek as Malfoy spat out, “How dare you let him touch you? Don’t you know by now that you are mine, and I yours?”
Malfoy,
The one where Draco is a jerk.
“Er, no, not at all. Very flattering.”
“Friendly neighborhood...how absurd,” Draco scoffed. “You saved the world, which was already more than what everyone deserves. You owe nothing to no one. Except for me, of course.” He shot Harry a devilish grin before his face grew serious again. “Be whoever you want, Harry.”
Harry didn’t understand at all what he had done wrong. He had only asked one question, and now Draco was gawking at him as though he’d burned down Malfoy Manor and cavorted naked in the expensive ashes in full view of the press. They were only sitting on the sofa, and were both fully dressed, so Harry couldn’t think of a single reason his question had elicited such horror.
Malfoy sat up ramrod straight again and pursed his lips. “Quite.”
He was unspeakably lovely. Each triangle of white skin that was revealed made Harry want to see more. Malfoy had such lovely long legs. He was just as lean and muscular as Harry had imagined, but he had one little pouch of belly that Harry longed to cup in his hands. His pale skin seemed to shimmer as he stepped into the tub, carefully gripping the side and barely rippling the water. With a sigh, he settled back against Harry’s chest. Yes, he was bony, but all of his sharp angles seemed to settle into the dips of Harry’s body as if they were made to fit together.
“One could say that,” Malfoy smirked. “It was somewhat disgruntled by the actions my father had taken in the war and made me sleep in the kitchen until we came to an agreement.” Harry scribbled copious notes as Malfoy told him more about the manor’s preferences and idiosyncrasies. Eventually, he ran out of parchment, and all he could do was listen.
Still, Harry hesitated. “I don’t want to bother your roommate. It’s Zabini, right? He doesn’t really seem the easygoing sort.”
“--what more could the manor want?”
Panic briefly overwhelmed him. “Bugger it all, how am I to find my mate if I can’t follow the pull?” Draco snapped. Desperation slowly filled his body, like a rising tide. After years of no feelings, he seemed to be having them all at once. It did not become a Malfoy at all.
As majestic as the castle was, Harry wished they would have made it less drafty. Probably not a concern at the forefront of the founders’ minds, he figured. While returning to Hogwarts had eased the constant chill within Harry’s chest, the approach of winter had worsened his condition, so much so that his fingers were constantly waxy white and cold to the touch. Heating charms could only do so much, and Draco Malfoy had taken it upon himself to do the rest. They were currently seated in one of the large bench seats in a side corridor, across from a roaring fireplace. They would usually be in the eighth year common room, curled up on an overstuffed sofa, but Seamus had decided to smuggle in a karaoke machine, and none of the woefully enthusiastic performers were talented enough to make staying in the common room bearable. (Dean was particularly bad.) Hence their current presence in the bench seat.
* * *
“Okay, Kreacher,” said Harry. “Please be kind to Draco. Remember, he’s an heir of the Black family, albeit disinherited. Do you have a problem with that?”
* * *
“I haven’t tried to apparate with it,” said Harry.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Yes… boyfriend. I’ve never… well…”
… Is that okay?” asked Harry. Draco nodded. “You’ve heard a lot of things that only you know. This one is also known to Ron and Hermione, but it should be kept between us. Your godfather is in it. Okay?” Draco nodded again.
Harry giggled, “I feel like a bloody lovesick fool. This night couldn’t have gone any better! I was expecting a nightmare… not from you for the record.”
Better than most,
“Yeah,” admitted Draco. “Um… I know you want to take this slow and so do I. I mean… I’m not sure what that means.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. I always hated it because it was narrow and turned every seven or eight steps.”
“Good!” said Draco with a smile.
When you can hum.
“I’m going to take my shower tonight. Will you be okay for a few minutes?”
“I’m not as blind as that specky git,” said Pansy, lovingly.

“I used to blame myself for the abuse. I knew in some way that it wasn’t normal to treat a child that way. I mean, they didn’t treat their own spoiled kid that way. It took a lot of counseling at Hogwarts for me to understand that it was

“I’m happy for you Harry. I really am,” said Ron. “Have you pounded him into the mattress yet?”
Harry nodded. “That’s good.” Harry gave Draco a quick kiss and said, “Meet me in front of Gringotts with your belongings at eleven tomorrow morning and we’ll get the fuck out of here.”
“Good tears… just a bit overwhelming,” said Harry, wiping the tears off his cheeks and sitting up. “I love you so much that I never thought about... well... what you mentioned. I mean, I’m not against it, but I would only want it if you wanted it. I don’t want to see you forced into something that... permanent. We kinda talked about this before... you know... when I said that you owe me nothing... remember?”
“Molly, I’ll help you get started on breakfast, so Pansy doesn’t faint again,” chided Harry.

The men passionately kissed for several minutes. Draco pulled away from Harry and said, “I’m well read on certain subjects, as I’m sure you are aware. Something came to mind today. I remembered reading something about the history of... uh...
“There will,” said Harry. “The nightmares will probably come back as well. I’ve never gone three days without one.”
Draco led the women into the apartment past a stunned Harry. He finally came to and hung up their cloaks. “Welcome to our little home,” said Draco.

Yet simple at best.
“Fuck that!” exclaimed Pansy upon reaching Hermione and Ron.
“Oh,” said Harry, meekly. “I guess hell really
article?”
We asked several people familiar with Mr. Potter from his days at Hogwarts.
“Yes, Master.” With a crack! Kreacher was off and back within three minutes.
“Tonight,” said Harry, smiling. “Although, I always think of you as Draco in my dreams. It makes you look more… approachable.” He paused. “Draco, I’m lonely. I’m depressed. I need someone in my life to help with my… issues. You need to know that. I also have fierce nightmares.”
“I suppose you’re right,” said Draco. He dressed, then pulled out a vial of clear liquid from his valise. He held it up to Harry. “Veritaserum.”
“Oh,” blushed Draco. “I don’t know London like I should.”
It has been a long twelve months. I didn’t go back to Hogwarts for my sixth year. Instead, I helped my family house the Dark Lord (V). The Manor is now a qualified disaster area. Those filthy Death Eaters and catchers were here day and night. Talk about rude, unhygienic, uncouth Witches and Wizards! I can still smell their foul stench. Six of our twelve House Elves were killed for pure pleasure. They provided good sustenance for Nagini, V’s snake. That all is for another book.
“The first time Moldy Voldy tried to kill me... when he killed my parents... his soul was fragile and somewhat fractured,” said Harry. “Do you know what a horcrux is?”
“Harry, when did we start calling each other by our given names?” asked Draco.
Kreacher scratched his chin, bowed, and said, “For Master Harry, Kreacher will do anything. He saved us.”
“Any truth to them?”
Yes! It's me.
“They do... in some ways,” reflected Harry.
“Do you know who that is?” asked Draco.
Draco stared into Harry’s emerald green eyes and nodded. He whispered, with tears in his eyes, “I’m sorry, Harry.” Harry pulled Draco into an embrace. Draco lowered his head and cried into Harry’s shoulder. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s soft blonde hair. After a minute, Draco sniffed and looked up into Harry’s shining eyes. “I’m sorry. What I did last night was disgusting. I had to get your attention but didn’t know how. I’m just so fucking lost. I forgot the silencing charms and then… well… I can’t believe you’re holding me right now.”
“Thanks, Luna,” said Harry. “We are all worried about each other. That’s what friends do. I love the new friend I have here.” Harry grasped Draco’s hand.
Draco, through his panting and blissful voice, said, “Your turn.”
“Drama queen,” corrected Draco.
“Yes!” said Luna. “Unfortunately, the
“You told them about us, I hope!” exclaimed Draco.
“That doesn’t explain why you’re packing fudge,” said Pansy.
I have notified my parents of my penchant for buggery. They have officially disowned me. I’m alone now and it hurts. I’m crushed. I can’t help but be myself. I do not ask for your pity, but your help.
“What fam—? Oh!” said Draco. “Well... how about this... Could we perhaps have Ron and Hermione over for dinner tomorrow? What were you planning?”
We are now boyfriends. His armed guards will be standing down soon. They think the threats against his life are now diminished with the rounding up of hundreds of renegade Death Eaters over the last few weeks.
Harry got off the bed, stood up, and removed all his clothes. He stuck out his right index finger and motioned Draco to come closer to him. Draco did so and Harry turned around. Harry lit his wand and gave it to Draco so he could see the detail. Draco gasped and tears fell freely from his eyes.
* * *
Go here!
“Agreed,” sighed Draco. “Does that mean that I can’t…?” Draco placed his hand on Harry’s zipper and smiled.
But really your insides
“Yeah,” said Draco. “I never knew…”
“That’s far from selfish, Draco,” said Harry. “It’s self-preservation, no? You were saving yourself from a lifetime of mental torture, pain, and yearning. I can’t blame you for that. It took a lot of courage to come out to your family. You must have known what the worst-case scenario was.”
“What!? What!?” exclaimed Harry. “I don’t have a secret admirer!”
“I can,” said Draco. “At least, I hope I can. My mind is full of Wrackspurts right now, so I’m not terribly sure of anything.”
“It’s okay, Draco. I understand. We both agreed on the articles. They will help stop certain ridiculous speculations. Are you having any regrets?”
enough.”
Draco laughed, “I’ve never… made love… to… anyone. Let’s promise to help each other on our new adventure. Okay?”
“You two are sure already?” asked Hermione.
“It’s custom,” said Ginny. “Once it’s announced publicly, he has 60 days to reconcile with his family. If he doesn’t, he’s not allowed to use his last name in the Wizarding world. It doesn’t affect his British passport, however.”
“Hiding from Ron and Hermione.”
“It happens,” said Harry. “May fill in some more blanks about my childhood?”
many years? It doesn’t exactly come as a shock.”
Shit! Doorbell.
Meeting request accepted.
* * *
Guess it didn’t surprise her too much. She asked if it was Harry (freaking) Potter. I nodded. She hugged me. Since, she has been very supportive, but we both agreed that Lucius need not know. I’m calling him Lucius now. I hate that bastard. He doesn’t deserve to my father.
“We met when he delivered your invitation,” said Luna. “I’m glad Harry left the handwriting to you, Draco. You both look much improved. I was worried about you.”
“Oh!?” exclaimed Ginny.
“Thanks?” said a flustered Draco as he pulled away from the bear hug.
. She’s too mean. I’ve been near her enough times that I can see no redeeming qualities.”
Bushy? Broom rider? More to follow.
“Shh, Harry. It’s okay. Please, it’s okay. Listen to me,” said Draco. “Luna became my friend at Hogwarts. I smuggled food to them in the Manor’s dungeon. I’m the reason they lived.” Draco sighed, “Your testimony isn’t the only keeping me out of Azkaban.”
“Draco, did you believe what you read in the
“Dude!” exclaimed Harry. “You came up to your chin, you idiot! Think I can’t see that!? Your semen is soaking into the sheet and your cock is softening.” Harry paused. “Are you—?”

“Of course, dear,” replied Molly. “My brother was gay. He got killed the last time around. He owned the watch we gave you for your seventeenth birthday.”

“Okay,” said Harry, shrugging.
“I wish your father was home!” squeaked an embarrassed Molly Weasley.
Until then,

end.”
“Yeah,” said Draco. “I’ll take mine too. We’ve got two. Are there towels for me?”
“Oh,” said Harry. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell any of your earlier about… well… me.”
Bushy? A certain seeker is found to be abundantly fluffy just south of his belt. More to follow.
Draco’s jaw dropped. “Moldy Voldy!?” He started to laugh and couldn’t stop. “Fuck! That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard... in... forever!”
* * *
“I’m allowed through the wards,” said Harry. “If no one’s awake, we can start on breakfast.”
“Yes. Why?”
Harry was thoroughly confused, but shrugged and said, “I guess I just have that effect on people. I come out and the rest of the world follows.”
* * *
“I don’t want to push you, but I was wondering when you might like to meet my family?”
Only you! Only you!
* * *
“About the abuse?” asked Draco. “Yes. They were often in the room.”
“Ah!” exclaimed Draco. “What was that!?”
I have it on best authority that our savior is as bent as a circle. His absolute failure in the mastering of silencing charms has led many to hear his screams of my name during the occasional midnight wank. I do share a certain closet with the savior. Perhaps he would like to step out of it with me?
“I’m confused. I thought--”
* * *
“Is that why you were so nice to me?” asked Draco.
Harry introduced Draco to the wonders of public transit and department stores. Draco helped Harry with some spells to help carry around their purchases much easier than possible in the Muggle way. Harry returned to the flat with their purchases, then returned to Draco and took him out to a quality, relaxing dinner.
“No. Merlin! No. I would never use you like that,” said Harry. “There’s certainly a

to help resurrect Moldy Voldy.”
“Was not.”
After the Battle was over, Harry Poter (Harry) sought me out in the Great Hall, I think. Maybe I was just near him. Anyway, we were both sweaty, smelly, dusty, and dirty. We hugged emotionally and cheered in each other’s arms. It was erotic and exotic and… wonderful. He has this strong intoxicating scent. I never thought I’d like icky sweaty men that hadn’t bathed in days. I was in the same condition and he didn’t seem to mind.
Much of my fear of poofterdom stemmed from the treatment of gays in our society. The American (home of the free indeed!) sayings, “Liberty and Justice for All” and “All men are created equal,” are just bullshit. The treatment of gays in the UK is just as horrible. I was so afraid of people labeling me as: “that cock-sucking faggot fucker.” I don’t appreciate things like that.
Harry thought for a minute before responding, “If you are agreeable, your mere presence is all that I request… request, not require. You are free to leave at any time, though it would be devastating to me. I cannot lie.” Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, confused. “Draco, I cannot and will not force you to do anything you don’t want. You need happiness in your life. If it ends up that I can’t make you happy…” Harry now had tears rolling down his cheeks.
* * *
I must admit that at times I was very suicidal. No one ever suspected. I have always joked about plunging a knife into my chest, but no one knew when that joke was no longer a joke. I still remember the time when I could, for the first time, see that knife puncturing my heart, causing my death. My question to the “straights”: how many people actually take their lives from the pressure you put on them?
“I’m sorry,” said Draco, apologizing for his tears. He wiped them away as Harry put his arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders.
“Harry!” shrieked Hermione as soon as Harry opened the door. Hermione and Ron both pulled him into a bear hug just as he closed the door. Draco walked into the room. Hermione ran up to him, squeezing him in a smothering hug, picking him up off his feet.
It turned out that he did. We were off by ourselves and both of us said that we had thought about each other. A few days later we had sex. I remember afterwards saying to myself, “I guess I’m gay.” That did it. I was finally able to accept my true feelings. From that day forward I was not a “straight.”
“First time’s a charm?” asked Harry, staring into Draco’s apologetic eyes.
My problem is not that I don't know what my problems are, but that I don't know how to handle/solve my problems and lingering issues. Let's see.... I am lonely. I don't know how to meet friends without flashing loads of galleons. I am afraid of new things to the extreme. I hate myself. I can't place a value on my worthiness. My self-esteem is low. I treat myself like crap. I treat others better than I treat myself. I don't know how to cope with anything… I am miserable, I look at anything I do in a negative way. I feel that others don't value me. I feel that I am an annoyance to other people. I have problems accepting help from anyone. I have problems interacting with others… I let little things bother me. I cannot relax. I don't know how to really have fun. I haven't had a truly happy and good time in years… if ever. I still can’t produce a patronus. Harry will help me with that… I hope!
“Mm-hmm…” mumbled Harry. “I rented a Muggle flat in London. We’re moving in today.”
“I do.”
Covering the events of:
Draco, I don’t doubt that your letter was written under the influence of Vertiserum. If not, it’s the worst joke perpetrated against me.
“We did,” said Draco. “I should have known that you wouldn’t do that to me. I’m still a little... jumpy… uh… insecure.”
And in the employ, all the jerk,
That night, after Harry and Draco returned home and had taken their showers, they laid awake in bed.
As tears built up in Draco’s eyes, Harry kissed him on the cheek and said, “That was beautiful, my love.”
I'll surely look back and say,

“Some,” replied Harry. “I’m gay. You’re the second person I’ve told. The first was the cloaked man mentioned in the paper today. He’s been thrown out on his arse and needs a place to stay. I couldn’t stay at number twelve Grimmauld Place. It’s too fucking depressing. I had to get out of here, too. Not sure if you understood my decision to leave here, but I thought I needed some time alone.”
Harry showed up this morning at 2 a.m. I, of course, was not asleep. We talked until six. Well, he rammed his cock into my arse from 2:30 – 2:45. I’ve never seen so much cum out of two people in my life! I hit my own forehead… standing… against gravity!!!
“What’s that?” asked a confused Draco.
15 May 1998 thru ___________
Dear Harry,
“I’m sick of secrets,” said Draco. “Secrets caused all of this angst and pain. Thank you for telling me that story. It was lovely, yet tragic.”
Last year, I think I knew, internally, that I was gay, without using the word. I comprehended the subject of poofiness and knew that it applied to me but was still unable to proclaim it.
Draco was the first to unzip his trousers. He pulled his hardening cock through the fly in his boxers. Harry unzipped his jeans and pulled them and his y-fronts down past his bum. Harry made sure not to let Draco see any of his scars. He was scared at how horrified Draco would be. That was for another day.
When Pansy came to, the kitchen held three extra occupants, Arthur Weasley, Ginny, and Luna. The latter two because of Harry’s patronus. Pansy slowly opened her eyes. She said, “Sorry, I just never thought I’d see the day when... when...”
“Yes, Master Harry Potter?” asked Kreacher. “Do you wish the presence of Kreacher?” Kreacher bowed, saying, “Mister Draco Malfoy.”
I saw Harry and fought on his side in the battle. He was hot, but I kept hearing about all of the women he had slept with (back when we were in school… not true, by the way). I noticed him looking me up and down more than once after the battle. I obviously thought something of this. I really wanted this hot boy and I thought he wanted me.
“No!” exclaimed Draco. “No! No! No! That stuff is sooooo arcane. I’ve been shunned by Pureblood society, so I really don’t care. I’m assuming that after tomorrow’s article, I’ll no longer be able to use my last name.”
“It’s a long story, but nothing happened,” said Harry. “He and I both virgins. Merlin! Wait till Skeeter gets a hold of
“Please, sit,” said Harry, nervously. He looked into Draco’s steel-grey eyes. “You’re shaking… like me. Scared? I’m terrified.”
“I had nothing to lose, didn’t I?” asked Draco. “Luna told me you were lonely the day she was at the Ministry giving her sworn affidavit in my favor. She said you were looking for a
So… Me and Harry. That night he came to my room, he sat in the chair. I was standing in front of him. He asked, “So, what do we do?”
“Okay,” replied Draco. “Thanks, Harry.”
isn’t leaving me alone,” said Harry. “It’s not the first time I’ve heard my name screamed in ecstasy in the last few days. I must be vigilant about people coming after me. There are still a lot of enemies out there. I hope you’re not one.”
Harry looked around the room and smiled. “Well, we’ve only got two singles here. George, if you’re straight… and... Pansy, if you’re straight… Just saying!”
“She’s out for blood, Harry,” said Hermione.
Draco slowly increased the speed of his thrusts. Once he hit a pleasant pace a few minutes later, he was getting close. He began to stroke Harry’s leaking cock. In another minute, Harry and Draco were both screaming each other’s names, coming in harmony.
“Everyone,” began Harry, “this is my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy. He prefers if you call him
“That’s…” began Ron. “Um… apology accepted. Yeah… so… George isn’t holding up well at all. He’s only made one joke since… and Harry was there for it. You know, Harry…”

Ron said, “You appear to be making Harry terribly happy. We haven’t seen him like this in a long, long time.”
“I was going to ask you the same thing!”

“That’s brilliant, Draco!” exclaimed Harry with building tears in his eyes. “I did. I sent the new owl. It was a great idea, sending Kreacher to Diagon Alley to buy it. Did you get a howler from Pansy yet?”
“No, but you will need to remove those slinky new silk boxers and I’ll remove by new, brightly colored jockey shorts.”

frozen over. I’m sorry for underestimating all of you. Come on, let me show you the place. Draco, please help Kreacher get the food to the table.”
“Where do you want it and how much?” asked Harry.
“Would you like some mental health help?” asked Harry. “I won’t force you, but I’ll me more than willing to pay. Your mental health and our relationship are worth more than all the gold in Gringotts.”
Draco was facing away from Harry. He kissed Harry’s hand, which was across his chest. Harry ran his hand through Draco’s hair, bringing his hand to skim Draco’s cheek. “You’re crying,” said Harry.
After all cloth barriers were removed, Harry began to passionately snog Draco. After a few minutes, Harry sent his right hand down between Draco’s thighs. Slowly, he pulled his hand up Draco’s vulnerable inner thighs until he found Draco’s scrotum. Harry gentle rolled it around in his hand, then made his way up to pass lightly over Draco’s now erect cock. He smiled at finding a very hard Draco in his midst. Harry stood up and pulled on Draco’s legs, then arms, until he was seated on the edge of the bed. Draco leaned back, propped up by his arms behind his back.
Should you wish to pursue a relationship with me, I would prefer that you do not let Granger research the courting gifts and ceremonies of pure blood relationships. I do not desire a silk scarf with embroidered cherry blossoms. I do not wish for you to make dinner for me. I do not wish for you to wait ten weeks to make love to me. I only ask for your love.

“I don’t feel so young after what I’ve been through,” said Draco. “Are you being a sappy Hufflepuff right now?”

Harry wrote back. He saw the owl’s emblem and sent him back immediately before he could be caught. Harry had to send that twat of a house elf of his, Kreacher. That little guy needs to be punished for his insolence and disobedience. And I thought I had a foul mouth! Oh well… at least I got the note. Harry’s being kept under constant security protection by the auror squad. Owls are not allowed through. He’s been giving his testimony to the Wizengamot. I guess this last year was quite busy for him. Harry’s going to see me as soon as he is able. There is an anti-apparition ward on the house. Luckily, most of those don’t prevent House Elves from apparating.
“There will be a lot of girls and women who will be disappointed,” said Luna. “Does Pansy know, Draco?”
George stood up, stalked over to Draco, grabbed him into an incredibly smothering hug, and said into Draco’s ear, “You loveable bastard. Of course! It’s the most beautiful thing anyone could do.” George kissed Draco on the cheek and stared into his eyes. George then whispered in Draco’s ear, “I know you won’t but if you dare harm Harry… I’ll still like you.” He pulled away from Draco and winked an eye at him.

“We’re waiting for Pansy,” replied Hermione in a whispered voice.
Bushy? Who is our favorite underaged bachelor? More to follow.
“Just... for... you know...”
“I’m glad I’m not the only one who hears about this unrequited love… all the fucking time!” said Pansy, quite distressed.
“That phrase is so rude,” said Draco. “You probably don’t even know what it means. I am packaging a box of fudge to give to someone tomorrow. Is that alright with you?”
After both men took a sip of the truth serum, they questioned each other, becoming content that the other was not lying.
“You mentioned courting,” said Ginny. “You’re not going through all of those Pureblood wooing and courting rituals, are you?”
“Kreacher, what took so long?” asked Draco.
is why I was cruel. I was jealous.
“My turn,” said Draco, sullenly.
Oh, I forgot (doing a lot of that lately)… I HATE robes. They’re so… traditional. Uck! I bought a lot of perfectly fitting (not tight) clothes at Selfridges today. I think they make me look so fucking hot. Well, I’m not so hot right now. I’ve gotten nasty bags under my eyes from having so little sleep. My hair needs a good cut, but who’s going to touch a reformed Death Eater?
“Of course not!” replied Ron. “We’ll leave the ribbing to George and the rimming to Harry.”
The day will come,
“Shhh! They’ll hear you!” exclaimed Harry in a hushed voice.
“I’m sorry, love,” said Harry, hugging Draco and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Kreacher had finally arrived with the drinks. Harry stood up, handed them out, and said, “To new and renewed friendships.” They clinked glasses and took a sip of their drinks.
The thing that happened with Harry is looming over me. I cannot stop thinking of it. Who knew that one little hour could change me so much. I can’t believe it lasted a whole hour! Merlin! Harry has not contacted me yet... that is pissing me off... and I can't get the address him… He, of course, knows where I live… duh! The first and last time he was here wasn’t good, however. Damn!

“Does that mean you might be amenable to such a... proposal?” asked Draco.
“You mean... anything!?”

All will be better,

There were audible gasps around the room along with stunned expressions. “George?” asked Molly with a shaky voice, failing to hold back tears.
“The young man did not know why the teacher hated him until the day they both died. Only one survived. It is
After their panting slowed down, Harry asked, “What do you call that?”
Once Harry returned to the sidewalk, Draco asked, “What was that shiny colored rectangular thing that you used?”
“No!” exclaimed Harry. “Not yet, at least.”
Later that day, Harry and my mother had a two-hour conversation. They brought be in for the last thirty minutes. Thanks to mother’s persuasion and my… something… we’re not in Azkaban. Father (aka. Lucius) is now in that dreaded penal colony. Luna Lovegood was gracious enough to give testimony on how I fed and watered our prisoners in the basement dungeon. I only did what I thought was right. Thank Merlin for being able to keep my mind shut against V’s probing. I surely would have died. I nearly did, many times.
“If I would burn a piece of toast... If I would drop a crumb on the floor... If I would talk back... If I glared at any of them... If I didn’t do something they didn’t tell me about...
Didn’t sleep last night. Too much in my head and on my mind. I came to some conclusions….

“The Burrow, you know, Weasleyville, was too damned depressing. I visited the home I own here in London. I believe you know the old Black estate?” Draco nodded. “It’s fallen into neglect and disrepair. It’s depressing… much worse than this place. I need to work with magical contractors to get it fixed up. I also have to be at the Ministry nearly every day this week.”
“I had a lot of them,” smiled Draco. “Harry has repelled many.”
“That’s why I love you!” said Ron.
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry. “I order you to call me Master Harry and him Mister Draco. I order you not to tell anyone where we are living. Draco and I are gay and are in a brand-new relationship. I order you to not tell anyone about our sexual orientation or that we are in a relationship. This is a Muggle building. Okay, Kreacher?”
“Nope,” said Harry. “I hope that scares the hell out of you. It does me.”
Everyone, including Harry and Draco, was engrossed in the
“Poofter Potter has rented a flat in Muggle London and is moving in with one Draco Malfoy today,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron gasped.
After dinner, Harry bolted up to his dorm room and quietly slid into his closet before Hermione and Ron could catch up to him. Harry felt someone’s breath against his face. “Lumos!” whispered Harry, hoping to not be heard. “Draco!”
Harry nodded. “Let’s get back to our guests.” The two men went reentered the sitting room. “I’m sorry gals. I got a little emotional and didn’t want to cry in front of our guests. I was... overwhelmed.”
“Merlin! I never knew,” whispered Draco. “And I thought
Yours, Blondie
“How does that feel?” asked Draco.
“It’s not deviant. How did they find out?” asked Harry, gingerly.
“He’s still a twat,” said Ron. “Ouch! Why’d you crack me in the ribs, Hermione?”
“They did nothing?” asked Harry, shocked.
Draco nodded. “I sent an owl. Purebloods are horribly homophobic. It’s sad, really.”
“Just watch the sausage around Harry,” said Ron. Groans filled the room.
“How’s he doing?” asked Draco. “I can’t imagine. It makes me sad, and I wasn’t related. I’ll tell you a secret… I used to have to hex myself to not fall down laughing at Fred and George’s antics. I was a closet Fred fan.” Draco paused. “Harry and I have put a three-day pause on reminiscing about the past, but I need to say this. I was fiercely jealous about the happiness of your family and the warmth of your friendships. I could only dream about being happy like that.
Bushy? We have it on best authority that a certain raven-haired seeker has a rat’s nest down under. He’s certainly not in Australia, but at a Wizarding school of some repute. Several reports given to this publication tell of post-Quidditch showers in which the young man was seen in the all together. One young woman told us that the young man’s bollocks couldn’t be seen for the tangle of black hair. A platinum blonde student tells of foot-long hairs around the areola. Another student tells of flowing hair between the buns.
It could go somewhere from here, but I am unsure about that at present. At least, it was a new experience. I can now say that I know the size of Harry Potter’s penis… just kidding. I haven’t told anyone what happened or about what I am thinking. I am not sure if I should. I think I need to sort some things out first. I would never mention your name unless you want that. Right now, and for a long while, I just want to keep this between us. Okay? Thanks.
“Yeah,” said Draco. “We shouldn’t pretend that things never happened, but it always helps to escape for a short periods. Let’s never forget that.”
“Lovely day,” said Draco. “I can’t believe how wonderful
Harry shrugged. “I had Hermione and the ginger horde. They helped, but they didn’t know the whole story. They still don’t. You now know the most.” Harry paused for a long while, building up his courage to ask, “Your parents knew?”
Harry asked, “Good day. Yeah?”
“No. I love you, Draco,” Harry pulled Draco closer to his body. “Sleep?”
“Statement,” said Draco. “You need to know the truth. Something I said yesterday might have been misconstrued.” Harry looked into Draco’s teary eyes. “I told you I’ve never made love before. Well, I can’t count what happened to me as

Rita Skeeter (Hogsmeade). This reporter continues to be turned away from Hogwarts since the Battle. Fortunately, many of our Savior’s former classmates have been more than candid with this reporter about his actions. It appears that Potter is a well-known poofter. We have it on good authority that Potter can frequently be seen lifting shirts and staring at arses. Fellow Gryffindors confirm to us that Potter’s breakup with the youngest Weasley was not due to the negligence of her affectations, but his phallus worship.
“That she found my sketchbooks and broke into them?” said Draco. “Yes, that is true. She broke a complex privacy spell. I know how skilled she is at doing such things. I used to hide those books, not keeping them in plain sight. Well, I let down my guards in the last few months. I was exhausted and tired of the dark world. I didn’t have the energy to care about hiding them anymore. I kept them spelled shut, but not hidden from view.
“That was sooooo hot!” exclaimed Harry. “By the way, they’re
“Ronald!” exclaimed Hermione as Harry rolled his eyes.
“Why weren’t you at dinner?” asked Harry.
“Uh… the

If you do not wish to enter into a relationship with a foul git such as me, I need to know that. I ask for your presence in the Room of Requirement at ten o’clock tomorrow night. You may wish to use the grooming products given to you on Wednesday. I only ask that you keep your wild head hair as it is and to not groom your underarm area. It drives me insane.
Muffled, through the thin walls, Harry heard, “Potter! Oh! Potter! Harry!” Annoyed, Harry exited his room to find the sound. Someone was fucking with him. Harry used a silent alohomora to slip silently into the room next door and startle the wanker. Once inside, Harry silently cast a sound blocking charm and lit his wand. “Malfoy!”
“Mmmhmm....” responded Harry. “Later.”
“You mean,” began Harry, “how did the most skilled legilimens in the British Isles not know that I was being brutally abused? You mean, how did the most powerful Wizard, in charge of my welfare, bring me down and down and down again? You mean, how did the head of a school hang me out for the wolves? He sacrificed me.” Harry sighed, “Albus Dumbledore so believed in the prophecy that it blinded him to reality. That, my dear Draco, is the only way I’ve been able to explain it… however poorly.”
“How much can you do with it?” asked a curious Draco.
I’ve only come out as gay to Harry and to mother (this morning). Pansy Parkinson figured it out two-years ago, but I never confirmed it with her. Mother seems to be supportive. I’m not ready to confess my love to Harry, so the following note to Harry is all theoretical.
Harry smiled and said, “Let’s just say that love makes strange bedfellows. You’re down. I’m down. Maybe we can pick each other up. I don’t know. I’m nervous because I’m so worried that this won’t work out. I need it to work out. I’m willing to give it everything I’ve got; I’ll have you know.” Harry tapped Draco’s nose with his index finger.
That day when the willows doth sway,
“We could ask the same thing!” exclaimed Ron.
“Can we take this… relationship… slow? I don’t know if I’m in the proper mental state to rush headlong into…”
Okay… I want to find Harry. I have tried everything to find him. I even sent an owl to Weasleyville. He’s not there. Yikes! I want him. I am almost sure of that now. Wow. Big step… Am I going too fast….? Gotta see what he is up to. I think I love him. Need to talk to him. Got to…. Big decision… I think it is for me (the decision to live as a poof). Is it a decision? I’m not entirely convinced. I think I just AM. Fuck! Why isn’t anything easy for me???
“Yeah,” said Harry. “And some secrets are best left between a couple... unless Kreacher breaks in and comments on Ron’s bum.”
* * *
Bloody hell! I finally found Harry. Mother suggested that I try the old Black estate in London. I sent the eagle-owl. I transformed a silver statue of a dragon into a harness the owl could wear. If he couldn’t get my message through that would be fine. If someone was intercepting Harry’s owls, Harry might see the dragon emblem and it will remind him of me, Draco, the dragon. I sent my calling card. I couldn’t risk any details that might be seen by the press or other unfriendly eyes.

. Some people might, but it was not pleasurable. I need you to understand this.”
“Oh!” gasped Draco. “Nothing rough.”
“Sex should be between two consenting adults trying to please each other, at a minimum. Making love to a person requires an intense attraction, the sharing of feelings and emotions, and tenderness. So, in my mind, I have not had sex. No intercourse. No blowjobs. No mutual masturbation. Nothing. Does that make sense?” Draco was now shaking and crying.
is when the whip came out.
Lots of things on my mind. Who am I? I’m not the Draco that everyone thinks I am. I’ve always put up the façade of confidence so that others would not be able to peer in and see my weaknesses or emotions. THAT is the life of a Malfoy. We don’t make mistakes. We blame others for our mistakes. Well… fuck that! No more.
“A box of fudge for you,” said Draco.
Draco giggled. “Silly Harry.” Draco paused. “We don’t know each other really, do we?”
“Ooohhhh… Sounds like my bent ex-boyfriend has got a catch!” exclaimed Ginny, entering the kitchen.
“I’d like that,” said Draco. “Can you promise me one thing?”
“No!” shouted George and Pansy at Harry.
The old windbag shuffled into the room, bowed, and asked, “Yes, Mister Draco?”
Harry rolled over to face Draco and asked, “Luna?” Draco nodded. Harry asked, “Do you mind if we take a few days off from talking about the... unpleasant things? It’s a lot. I need time to process all of this.”
Okay… now the hard part. What to do…. I wish Harry would contact me. I need to talk to someone about this… He is the only one available. I need to talk. I am literally going crazy thinking about this. I am horny 24 x 7 and cannot think of anything else. HELP!!! Am I gay… (ughhh… that word… yeah… don’t like it yet). Do I like girls??? Not as much as boys. Has been that way for a long time. I guess I have been attracted to guys for quite a while… since about second year? Who knows? I just have this overwhelming attraction to the same sex for a while. What should I do? Only Harry knows (well, now mother). Last Tuesday was special. That hour of pleasure is truly what I want… I think… Help! I need help. I feel like I need to tell someone my own age. I need to talk to someone. Not ready to talk to Lucius, although I can’t because he’s in Azkaban. Lucius is a goddam bigot. I think I truly hate him. He just pisses me off so… He does everything to make me mad. That pisses me off. Oh well… just more built-up stuff in my head. I need it shrunk at a head shrinker. Do we have magical psychologists? I want a meaningful relationship. Maybe with Harry. Maybe with someone else. Where do I go? What do I do? How do I ward off the ridicule? How do I let the world know that I am… yeah… that. HOW??? WHY??? HELP!!!!!!!
“Ginny, have you told your mum?” asked Harry.
“Dears, it’s one thing for two people to love each other. It’s another to be able to live with them,” said Molly.
* * *
Are lower than you think.
Is it something inside?
“Must be the new clothes that actually fit.” Changing topics, Harry said, “It sounds like your monthly visitor has passed, no?”
“I’m not!”
“But seriously,” Harry paused. “You probably don’t know what happened that night… at least between the time when Cedric was killed and when the Death Eaters arrived. There are only about half a dozen people still alive that know about it… if that. Yes, it took some of my blood to resurrect Moldy Voldy. I don’t wish to talk about that now. What do you know about my life before Hogwarts?”
“Mother found and broke into my sketchbooks,” said Draco. “They are full of pencil and charcoal drawings of the incredibly sexy man with the lightening scar… my… fancy. Look, please. They’re on the table.”
“I always skip it.” Harry read the short paragraph about Draco and paused. “Oh!”
Looming and large,
I apologize for my incredibly poor treatment of Granger, the Weasley horde, and you. I’ve done a lot of reflection since being disinherited over Christmas holidays. I ask that you find it in your heart to be my friend.

Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and Lucius Malfoy (Grantors), for and in consideration of: One Galleon, release and quitclaim to the Grantee:
“Harry, really!?” scolded Hermione, as if he should know better than to ask. “Everyone’s fine with you being gay. It didn’t shock anyone that you’ve fallen for Draco. I mean, come on! Ron shook Draco’s hand.”
“Where’s Ginny?” asked Harry. He blushed, “Oh… with Luna.”
call it the fucking
“Look who’s talking!” exclaimed Harry with a grin.
Ginny said, “That’s...”
Harry was back in a few minutes with a stout pot of tea and several biscuits. He sat the tray down on the table in front of the sofa, rattling the teacups as he sat it down. “C’mere, Harry. I’ll pour out. Two sugars and cream?” asked Draco. Harry nodded. He watched Draco with his thin, pale hands, gently pour out tea for the pair of them. Harry thought he noticed a slight tremor to Draco’s hand.
“I appreciate your kind words, but that’s not how Purebloods see it,” said Draco. “I was more than aware of what could happen to me. I just thought that my mother might be more understanding.”
“I know you can’t... but there is something else we can do. It might not be as pleasurable, but I hope it makes you happy.”
“It’s magic!” exclaimed Draco.
“First thing in the morning, we’ll go to Tesco and get our… personal items. I need a trim,” said Harry.
Draco and Harry both turned to him and said, “No!”
“Mmmhmm...”
“I came to Hogwarts with a scar, a flap, covering a significant portion of my anus. Going to the bathroom was an excruciating experience. On my second day, the skin tore, as it was wont to do. I went to Madame Pomphrey, and she fixed what she could. I later learned that she told McGonagall and Dumbledore. Minerva could do nothing, unfortunately. Albus could. He didn’t. End of story.”
“So—”
“You’ve never had to worry about money before, have you?” asked Harry. Draco shook his head.
“This is like a French farse,” said Draco.
“I’m happy too,” said Draco. “Whatever we have here is eclipsing the pain I should be feeling right now. I can’t say that I’m… fixed…? But I’m doing a lot better. There will be struggles, I’m sure.”
Grantors do hereby convey, release, and quitclaim all the Grantor’s rights, title, responsibilities, and interest and to the above-described claims of the Grantee.
“So, my loving uncle came up to shove a broomstick up my arse. I have since found out that scars get much worse under certain scenarios. One, repeated injury to one location. Two, untreated open wounds. Three, infection. Four, persistent infection. Five, untreated infection. Six, slow healing wounds.

“Yes, Master Harry,” said Kreacher. “Kreacher understands. He has kept a similar secret before.”

“I bet he has!” smirked Ginny. “Harry, you’re looking good too. I’m glad that Kreacher didn’t interrupt
joke again,” complained Draco. “Why are we still whispering? They’re all out there, you know.”
“Yes!” both said.
“You knew I was just on the other side of the wall,” stated Harry. “The whole bloody Wizarding world knows. Did you do this on purpose? I mean, failing to put up silencing charms, the loud moans, and screams… in the room that just

Rita Skeeter (Diagon Alley, London). One Harry Potter was seen sneaking out of a mysterious man’s room next to his at the Leaky Cauldron. At two in the morning, Potter left the room and ran back to his own. We can only guess what the two poofs were up to. Apparently, our Savior likes to take it from strangers at the Leaky. All we’ve been able to determine is that the person in the other room is in fact a man. He came to the Leaky earlier in the day wearing a thick black hooded cloak. The name in the register was the name of a deceased Death Eater. We will not rest until we find the truth!
I think I finally came to reason that I could only get off on pics of boys (or guys, if you prefer). It took me a while to come to that conclusion… about three years. Even then, I kept telling myself that I wasn’t gay. (I had no logic facility.) All throughout Hogwarts, people (mostly my own house mates) called my gay when I didn’t even know if I was myself. I guess you could say that I knew, but I couldn’t state the logical conclusion… even in my own mind.
“Who gives a damn!?” exclaimed George. “Yeah, we’re Purebloods, except you and Hermione, but we hardly
too soon. You’ve had enough to worry about with taking me in and saving the world.”
“Moldy already had several horcruxes,” said Harry. “In the end, he had seven. His diary that Ginny and I discovered in my second year, Ravenclaw’s lost diadem, Hufflepuff’s cup, Slytherin’s locket, his snake, his grandfather’s ring, and me.
Again, Ron rolled his eyes, started straight into Harry’s, and said, “Harry, mate… I think it’s time for you to just come out of the closet. I mean c’mon, you’ve been queer for Draco for
Being gay doesn’t mean we are any different from other people. The “straights” must get that through their heads. I just want to live in a world in which it doesn’t matter who you wanna be with. We should all just be able to be cool boys without people viewing us as “freaks.”
“Wa da fuck?” mumbled Harry.
“Yet you did.”
Molly nodded. “Do you trust him?”
“Not on your life. I’ve already seen an eyeful.”
“Bullshit!”
“Let’s just say that she was a little shocked,” said Ginny. “I mean, Harry, you aren’t exactly the most…
Harry nodded. “Hermione! How are you and Ron
“Much of the pottery of the period portrays this act of intercrural sex with the elder male standing facing the teen. He would then thrust his penis between the younger man’s thighs. It was the beautiful act of intimacy. I modified it because your prick juts out straight and might make it difficult from the front. Did you like it?”
“Lily had friends that were not very nice to her friend Severus. She often rebuked them for their taunting and jeering of her weird friend, but his love went unrequited. Eventually, they grew up at this special magical school and Lily fell in love with one of Severus’s sworn enemies, messy-haired James. Severus hated James and was jealous of his affectations towards Lily.
Ron turned to her and said, “Look who’s talking! You didn’t come home last night and
Ginny nodded, “I told her the same day you did.”
“Kreacher is talking about the ginger one’s amply furry bottom.”
“You sound depressed, mate!” exclaimed a cheery Ron upon entering the kitchen.
Molly pulled Harry into her arms and hugged the stuffing out of him. She kissed Harry on the cheek. “You’re family, love. You and your boyfriend will always be welcome here.”
: even the word itself seemed special, more splendiferous than others. His mate was supposed to comfort him, to allow themself to be cherished and coddled. His mate was supposed to love him above all else. As his birthday approached, a shred of hope dwelled in Draco’s chest. He would come of age, he would find his mate, and his life would be worth living again.
For some reason, Harry hadn’t expected Hermione to ask that. “What? Er, I s’pose I did. It was definitely nicer than other kisses I’ve had, but it all happened so fast.”
“So be it.” Draco reluctantly lifted his hand, and Potter grabbed it in his own. They shook and Draco felt the ancient magic swirl about their combined grasp. The boon had been granted.
At least Ron was as reluctant as Harry. Neither of them had fond memories of the Yule Ball in fourth year, and neither of them were looking forward to this one. They hung together at the back of the crowd of eighth years until McGonagall entered and ushered everyone forward. The long house tables had been stacked against one wall, so the room felt even more vast and echoing than usual.
Draco dragged his tray down the line, selecting a chicken caesar salad and water. “Yes. My mother and I are having our last dinner together this evening. Granger invited me to lunch tomorrow, but after that, I’ll leave.” He picked up a chocolate cookie and handed Harry an extra large serving of treacle tart.
“Oh my darling,” Narcissa pulled back far enough to look him over. “I’ve only ever wanted for you to be happy. And if Astoria can give you that, I will do everything in my power to make that happen. And if New York is where your heart lies, then I will be just as content.”
“Sweet Merlin, is he flirting?” Neville asked, craning his neck around Harry to see.
And Harry surged down, desperate suddenly. Where he had meant to tease Draco, to bring him to the edge over and over and over, to extract promises and declarations by any means necessary, now he needed. He needed Draco underneath him, around him, inside him, needed to press himself closer, so close that they were one.
Harry slammed the door shut again, hard enough the frame rattled when it hit, and then he collapsed against the back of it, face buried in his hands because what he wanted and what he was supposed to want weren’t the same.
“For Christsake.” Draco dragged his hands through his hair and thought of Harry, still sleeping on his bed, the way it had felt to wake up next to another warm body. “I don’t need this.” He turned to Andromeda. “I’m going back to the flat.”
“Oh God,” Draco buried his face in his hands. Why couldn’t he just stop! Why did he have to keep asking, why did he think Draco had any answers about Harry’s behavior! Why couldn’t Harry just leave well enough alone!
Since the last statement worked, Harry tried again, “And Atkinson is your boss.”
Draco arrived at the first club on the list, paid his cover, and walked inside. It smelled like sweat and alcohol, like comfort and acceptance. And with each step inside, Draco was able to shed a little of his discomfort and unhappiness. He left his thoughts of Astoria and the future at the door and made his way to the bar, dropping concerns about Malfoy Manor, his mother, and the Malfoy reputation as he went.
It meant that Sawyer, Draco, Alice, Joe, Clarence, and Thomas were all in violation that evening at the club. It meant that they were all in violation when they were in the flat. It meant that Packs couldn’t be together.
He heard Malfoy stand up, gather the clothes and walk to the door. “You know,” he started, “I wouldn’t mind--It would be okay, if you--you wanted--with me--”
“So what if he was?” Malfoy scowled. “It’s my business who I go home with at the end of the night. Not yours.”
“No.” Teddy replied.
“We’ll apparate,” Harry said as they approached the front door.
He sighed loudly in the empty room, suddenly overwhelmed with the idea of not finding Draco ever while Harry sat in the room that almost literally embodied Draco.
it’s on sale?”
“Christ those must be some big bones. How big does a Peluda get?” One auror complained as he ducked out of the way.
It was a long hour that required a lot of backtracking from that evening to the night at the University to the War. And by the time they had covered the entire thing, which included a brief interlude to discuss things Draco would have rather stabbed out his eyes than discuss, Draco was completely worn out. His head dropped to the side a bit as he said, for the third time, “Tilly and I are
Draco frowned harder at the pun, intentional or otherwise. “Well, I’m afraid there are no dragons in this lab for you.”
“You idiot.” Draco leaned down and feathered kisses all over his face. “That stupid vow.”
“Harry James Potter!” Ginny shouted. “It is important to have fun.”
“Don’t make light of this.”
“Yeah, I can show you how to wash dishes.” Harry nodded. They carried everything into the kitchen, and Harry scrounged up some dish soap he’d bought before he’d realize he could just magic away the mess. And together they washed the dishes while a man talked about breeding foxes in Russia.
The same blond girl sat behind the counter when Harry arrived. At the sound of the door, she looked up from her magazine and scowled, “What?”
Draco sniffed and rubbed snot off his face. “He tore a hole in me, threw my magic down to the bottom. But magic, magic isn’t like that. It’s bigger. It’s like that show we watched, with the volcanos. There’s this huge mass of magic, the core and it simmers and it bubbles up in people, in magical places, in thunderstorms. Most people can’t find it, their magic bubbles up at a steady pace, fills the tunnel so no one can get to the heart of it.”
It was a longer ride home then Harry had been expecting.
Draco sat at the table quietly all through breakfast, eating only absently and mostly listening for the floo. It wasn’t until Andromeda reached in front of him for his plate that he realized breakfast was over and Teddy had disappeared into the parlour for his shoes.
Malfoy laughed, “Is that why I’m always on the floor in the morning?”
“An ID on the latest one, a Muggle called Sawyer Green.”
Dean stilled. “I didn’t lie.”
“He must suck cock like it’s water.” Ron scowled at his retreating back, and Harry saw the slight falter in Draco’s steps.
Harry curled in on himself a little more.
Jude gave Draco the tickets on Thursday in front of Tilly, and Draco went a bit pale at the sight of the yellowed parchment. He was trying to make out the next schedule, and only looked up briefly from the screen. “Thanks.”
Hermione nodded, “Have you a list of the necessary ingredients?”
Harry looked at Draco’s trousers and his earrings and remembered all the things that had come out of Draco’s mouth last night. And then of things that had come in it. “I doubt that.”
“All glitter and gold. Swirling and dancing like snowflakes.” His voice was soft, not really talking to Harry, almost as if he wasn’t speaking at all. His hands moved through the air as if he were trying to catch falling snow only to have it melt in his hands. Draco stepped lightly through the mess, eyes bright and hands always moving--touching wafting through the air, caressing. Finally he tore his gaze away from the mess to Harry. His face was relaxed and sort of joyous, the way he’d looked with Harry fully seated inside him, pleased and sort of hungry but not in a hurry. “Do you want to see what I see?”
Florence flicked another page of her magazine.
Harry had to turn away and refuse to think about why he couldn’t be angry.
“Of course you do. But first, food. Now march!” She gave him a gentle push towards the table, and then Teddy was running again. He jumped onto his chair and reached for his milk.
Malfoy sighed and closed his eyes for a long moment. “There are things I can say and things I can’t, not just because of the tea. I listened to your review.”
“And those would be?” Tilly glared, somehow certain she wasn’t going to like whatever answer Draco had for her.
Malfoy visibly blanched.
“You could come, if you wanted,” Harry said hesitantly
“Alright then. I should be back in time for dinner.”
“Then they’ll be punished too, for what they did?”
He checked the time, there was still an hour before he and Ginny were supposed to have dinner. Plenty of time to get started.
“She wanted to make sure you didn’t spend all weekend working or alone, since she has that training thing in Scotland.”
The entire fight lasted less than 8 minutes, ending when Sarah took three stunners to the torso, and hitting a suddenly still floor with a dull thud.
And Harry nodded, lips pressed into a thin line. “Yeah, it’s important to do fun things.”
Val chuckled, threw an arm over his shoulders, “Oh to be young and dumb. Come on, lover boy. I know a Potioneer who opens up his shop at seven. We can stop by after we’re done with the patrol, see if he knows anyone brewing illegally. Nothing takes the mind off a wayward lover like a murder.” She laughed again, but it was warm and gentle and not at all mocking, and Harry let her steer him down the street.
He popped into the parlor and pecked Andromeda on the cheek. “I’ll apparate until we get it sorted.”
Roxi huffed a tired laugh. “Depends on how many of us there are scouring the containers. If we’re lucky, probably next week.”
“You don’t like it when people get between you and your research.” Harry pointed out. “And you aren’t insanely rude all the time.”
“What is this?!” he shouted, more horrified than angry.
So of course, it all went to shit the first Friday in September, Tilly’s birthday.
She read over her memos while Draco wrote out his ingredients. It took ten minutes, but then they were stepping out into the hall. Draco clasped one wrist tightly in the other hand behind his back and squeezed hard, the pain cutting through his anxiety. Which was growing as they approached the destroyed lab. Granger left him at the open door.
“If you need anything else, catch any other leads, update me on the firewatch. Now get out.” He picked parchment up off his desk and began reading it over.
“You don’t know that,” she said just as angrily, just as loudly, not backing down a bit. “He spent his whole life hating halfbreeds. He did terrible things during the war, you don’t know that he isn’t doing it now.”
“It is your lack of understanding that prevents you from communicating with him. Furthermore, it is not intelligence that prevents many of us from participating in the magical community, but rather, a lack of magic. I myself am completely unable to set foot in your Ministry on my own.”
“I’m glad he found you.” Ajax stared at Harry until Harry stared back. “He needed an Alpha, and he couldn’t respect my authority.”
“He was quite funny,” Goyle added, staunchly loyal.
Harry tugged Val’s arm, it was too loud to hear each other, and they both made their way to the bar. It was hot, and the press of bodies made it difficult, but they did force themselves into the small openings and through the crowd. It was pure luck that a small space was open right in front of Malfoy at the bar, and Harry stepped into it quickly.
“You’re ambitious.” Draco replied. “And you want an equally ambitious husband.”
People were milling around, some with wine or beer, some with tumblers of firewhiskey. Harry kissed Ginny’s temple and then moved on to say hello to Neville and Hannah. They talked about their house hunt for a little while, and Harry nodded and smiled at all the right moments. And then Ginny arrived back at his side, dragging him over to the table for his own glass of firewhiskey. Harry watched the burnt orange liquid pool in the glass before giving the drink a sniff for the cinnamon. It tasted like smoke and burning, and nothing at all like the cocktail he sort of wished he held, but the smoke flavor lingered in his mouth, and that was good.
*CAN’T DM
“If you are interested in Blood Magic, you should read In the Age of Death and Magic.” Dr. Connor crouched down at another shelf, running his hands across the spines in search of the book.
Around the third cover, Draco leaned over to whisper in Neil’s ear. “Hey, where’s the loo?”
“I can’t.” Harry closed his eyes.
“I don’t think--” Harry started too softly and too slowly.
“Draco said to expect him as well.”
“Nonsense.” She held her hand to test the heat before pouring the eggs to scramble.
“I--uh--I just wanted to use a computer.” Draco stuttered and waved his hands innocently.
Silvia pulled her wrap more tightly around herself, but looked Savage dead in the eye. “I take a sleeping potion most nights, girl. I didn’t hear anything. Like as not, the neighbors did, but good luck getting them to talk to you.”
Draco put on his wicked grin. “You got a pick-up line or anything?”
Draco turned and smiled. “Well, the speeches were interesting if not all very well done.”
Harry looked over at Atkinson while she scribbled down the addresses, but Atkinson's face remained utterly impassive. When Pansy handed the parchment back, they thanked her for her time and left. Harry looked over the list in the hallway, considering the situation. He sincerely doubted that anyone else had heard from Malfoy, due mostly to the fact that Malfoy was still in his flat in London, but also because of the way Pansy had spoken.
Later, Harry found them in the front parlour, curled together on the sofa and surrounded by books, crayons, and lots of paper. Malfoy was pointing to something on one of the drawings, speaking softly in his ear, head tilted. They both looked up at the sound of Harry’s steps.
Ron blew out a loud breath. “Yeah, this way, in Diagon.”
“The hell?!” He tried to push Malfoy away, but for a man more bone than muscle, who stumbled clumsily around, Malfoy held on tight.
Thompson opened the door, finally, and Harry jumped up to take the tote. There was no telling what Thompson would do with it or how James would react, and Harry didn’t want any repeat unpleasantness. He took the tote and gently set it on the table.
Malfoy took his tea black, and he drank it standing up by the door to the back garden. He was dressed in the same clothes as yesterday, but they looked less wrinkled if not quite fresh. It was weird to see him drink the tea too. In Hogwarts, he had eaten leisurely, as if it were something to be enjoyed and savored. But here, he drank the entire mug in just a few long pulls, as if he were too hungry to wait. Harry looked away then; he didn’t want to feel any sympathy for Malfoy. He wanted to go back to not thinking about him at all.
And Draco felt like he could crawl inside of Harry, or that perhaps he could take all of Harry inside of himself and the two of them could be warm and safe and away from all the horrible things in the world.
“Sleep well.” She pressed a kiss to his temple, and Harry took a deep, calming breath.
“Yes. Her Pack has territory alongside ours. She was a good kid, too good for that.” He reached out and touched her snout before pressing their foreheads together.
“I’ll do it,” Harry offered.
It was idyllic and lovely and practically perfect in every way.
“Good.” Hermione threw a bit of floo powder in the flame and was gone.
“I didn’t know you had a boyfriend,” Maisie said cautiously. Which might have meant she didn’t know he was gay, but Harry didn’t care.
Weasley picked up the blue journal and skimmed through the first few entries. “These are all about Harry?” he asked incredulously.
“I am not proposing,” Harry repeated, quieter this time.
“But Harry is going to read this one.” Teddy patted the bed again. “It’s important.”
“Because I have,” she said calmly.
He meandered across the room to Harry’s desk, and leaned in what Harry could only assume was supposed to be a seductive pose against his desk. “What. Do. You. Want.” Harry scowled, even less in the mood to talk than when he had arrived.
“There seems to be a lot of steeping and distilling in your process.” Granger replied. “Wouldn’t it be simpler to make a paste that can dry?”
Maybe he was supposed to ask today? He had that whole meal set up at the Sleeping Noggin? Wouldn’t that be a romantic gesture? To ask her in front of her family after her very first professional game. And she’d scored the winning goal. That was the kind of day people tried to arrange for a proposal, and it had just been handed to Harry.
“Eleven,” Harry replied morosely.
“Well, you’ll have to bring him to the Burrow. Mum will go over the moon.” Ron grinned.
“We do too.” A woman said.
“Hmm,” Draco said darkly. “I don’t want to talk about it. Let’s talk about your queueing problem instead. Was it an American?”
“Oh god!” Draco wrestled a shirt over his head. “I’m calling Jude. Don’t touch anything else until we get there!” He jabbed the phone to ring off, and then jabbed it harder to ring Jude.
She turned back to him. “Draco. What happened?”
And, as it did every single time, Harry’s mind immediately turned to the Port, which was not an appropriate lunch location both because of the staff and lack of entrees. “Um, Thai?”
Draco crossed the floor and kissed his mother on the cheek. “Unremarkable, Mother. How are you?”
“But look at the cuffs!”
When Ron, Ginny, and several Aurors arrived on the scene, Harry was pressing his lips firmly to Draco’s and he didn’t stop at the noises of their audience. Dean slipped his hand into Ginny’s, and Ron stared in something like horror and something like relief. Draco pressed himself a little closer, and Harry tipped his chin down to deepen the kiss.
A different kind of rolling started in Harry’s stomach, no less sickening than before. He had failed another person. Another innocent had died because he hadn’t gotten them all yet. Instead of going back to Grimmauld Place or the Burrow as was Harry's usual habit on Saturdays, Harry went into the office. Surely a child that young would have a parent who had filed a missing person report. It would only be a matter of looking through the most recent right? Surely an anxious parent would have reported their child missing right away. Although, perhaps Harry should be more thorough and sort through perhaps the last several months of reports, to see if there were any others that matched Greyback’s type.
Tilly could hear rather a lot of rustling as Draco pulled on his pants and trousers, and she counted, slowly, as she breathed. Her hands didn’t shake as she wiped up the water, as she refilled the coffee maker, as she dumped in the disgusting but still caffeinated grounds into the filter.
“I want you to catch the son of a bitch that did that to Sawyer. And if I can help I will.”
Draco swished his tail as if to say “fuck you” and leapt up on the bed. He turned three circles and then curled up in the same place he had been sitting when Harry arrived.
Draco smacked his hands away. “Like you?” He sneered and nodded towards the rest of the Pack.
Vale kept Faye tucked carefully against him and steered her across the room to the doors at the other end.
And they’d left the chair at the head of the table empty, and Harry had to blink rapidly for a moment. Because that was a sign of respect, a sign he most certainly would not have recognized before. “Right.” He took the seat.
“It’s going to be fine,” he said, mostly into her curly hair, and she snuffled against him. “I’ll sort out the closet tomorrow, and it’ll be great. Yeah?”
Harry nodded again. “Yeah. I should probably head out.”
And murmurs went through the Wizengamot as well as the visitor section. “How are there so many unknown witches and wizards who have been infected with Lycanthropy?”
Malfoy flopped onto the sofa. “It’s unspeakable for a reason. I can’t tell you about that.” But he wasn’t sneering, and he wasn’t muttering.
There were a few things that Harry had learned over the last few months, while he and Draco had been doing this strange long distance thing where they were both perpetually traveling to see the other. The first was that Draco was utterly textbook when it came to his anxiety and cleaning, and the second was that he would never admit it but talking helped.
Draco stumbled to standing, and the crowd around them backed up. He sneered at them too, but she propelled him forward, stumbling and tripping over his own feet towards the door. He nearly fell when his foot caught on the threshold, and only Potter’s hand, snagged on his arm prevented him from splashing in a dirty puddle. He was oddly grateful for the rescue.
So Harry closed his eyes and apparated quickly to Harrowby Street. He knocked loudly on the flat door, and then waited for a full minute before knocking just as loudly a second time.
“Shit.” She sighed loudly into the phone. “Where’s he now?”
“Oh? We always just cast a few spells.” Harry  began sorting his bag.
“If you can get him to stop eating it, I will be impressed,” Aunt Andromeda said over the rim of her cup. “He’s been doing that since he had first discovered grass.”
Draco stepped up to the sink, washed his hands, and saw the paper towels flutter in a breeze he couldn’t feel. Nothing else in the room looked off. “Hello?” he called hesitantly and the lights flickered before going out. Like accidental magic.
“I can do laundry while you go to the supermarket,” Malfoy said, and Harry took that as an agreement.
“Why did Sawyer have it?”
Life was just not fair, he thought as he curled onto his left side. He had one last thought to hope he didn’t sick-up all over the bed again, and then he fell asleep until it was time to see Teddy.
“I am difficult to forget.” Oliver refused to take the insult.
And he was alone in the room.
“What the fuck is this?” Harry demanded, going straight from disbelief to rage.
Draco shook his head fiercely; once had been more than enough.
“Considering I run the largest Pack in London,” she looked directly at Head Sorceress Malhotra as she said, “at twenty-two members, I think I might be able to answer some of your questions.”
He would have liked to blame Roxi, but the truth was Draco held family just as highly as Roxi did. She just had a far less complicated relationship with hers. And she had rather helpfully pointed out that this was an opportunity for him to reconcile with his mother. The discussion with his therapist had helped clarify those thoughts, but she had expressed some concern about Draco’s resources in the area. A lack of friends, a lack of safe space, only the promise of work as a coping mechanism, and really a rather poor one at that.
