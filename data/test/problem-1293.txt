Potter flushes, his cheeks darkening to a deep red brown that Draco finds fascinating. “Merlin, that’s not what I meant.”
Before they leave the house, Draco decides to ask a question that has been niggling at him. He turns to the house-elf. “Gatty, who pays for the upkeep of this house if you have no master?”
Draco snorts. His new assignment is about some disappearances - normally disappearances were right up Draco’s alley - but the missing persons were werewolves. Werewolves were still persona non grata in most circles, which is why Hermione is having some issues getting support for her bill that would grant werewolves protection and access to potions that help their condition. These kinds of cases still fall in his lap with exhausting frequency. The cases no one else wants or the ones that seem impossible to solve. Draco accepts them all, does his bloody job, and does it well.
Draco takes the direct floo from the Ministry to Mungo’s and rushes to the fifth floor. He’s directed to the correct room by a solemn faced wizard behind a massive desk right off the lift. Draco walks as quickly as decorum allows and almost runs into the healer, a thin, tight-lipped woman.
He can hear Harry chuckling. Draco lays in bed and listens to the domestic noise of having Harry in his space, making tea like he belongs here, and Draco melts. It’s too early to tell Harry, but Draco is well on his way to being hopelessly in love, has been for some time.
Since the war, the Auror department has grown and Robards instituted a new policy where they switch partners every 6 months or are assigned to different cases and partners depending on what skills a particular case needs. It means that Draco has worked with most of the Aurors on the floor and most of them only grudgingly respect him, including Potter, though Draco suspects Potter and Weasley consider him something of a friend. The conversation with Gatty comes back to mind and Draco warms.
Potter smiles at him, sly and full of good humor, and Draco’s stomach swoops down at having that look leveled directly at him. “I went first last time and paid for it. I think it’s your turn.”
“Didn’t want to travel,” Draco grits out through clenched teeth. He opens one eye and looks at Harry. “I knew you’d take care of me.”
The skin on Draco’s chest feels stretched too thin and it throbs. “No, I'm not bloody well all right. I think the tea burned me.”
Harry chuckles and Draco is close enough to Harry that he can feel it rumble over his chest. The sound is so much better up close.
“We should clean the blood off you. You’ll feel better.” Now that he has fixed Draco’s wounds, the reality of their situation is beginning to sink in. Harry has to push down the raw need that tightens his body. This is not the time to act on his very wayward feelings for his partner. He does not think any overtures in that direction will be welcomed, especially today when Draco had been harmed because Harry attacked him so long ago.
Draco opens his eyes, the ice grey of them dulled with pain. “I didn’t want you to worry and I didn’t think it was so bad, but it opened one of my scars.” Draco huffs out a breath. “I can’t see it well enough to heal it.”
Potter chuckles and the sound dances over Draco. “What and miss the opportunity to ruffle your feathers?” Potter laughs some more and Draco rolls his eyes at the other man, but of course he’s not really bothered. He adores Potter’s laugh.
Draco nods and puts down his tea. “There have been some werewolves disappearing from the London area. I believe it is an underground organization that has some larger plan in mind. Auror Potter said you had some information that may be helpful to me.”
Harry blushes, that beautiful darkening of Harry’s skin that Draco is becoming addicted to. Harry is still naked so he can see how the blush travels down Harry’s cheeks and neck and across the top of his chest. “I pay attention to you.”
The other Aurors start trickling onto the floor, but Draco’s been at his desk for an hour already, meticulously finishing the paperwork on the case he closed last week. Draco likes the preciseness of paperwork and he can’t help the surge of pride he feels every time he turns in perfectly thorough reports on a closed case. The only other person in the department with a closure rate that rivals his is Potter, but he’s seen Potter’s paperwork. It’s abysmal.
Draco collapses heavily onto one of the benches along the wall, cutting off the swift intake of breath the pain along his side causes.
Potter looks up and his dark brows drop down. “I say, Malfoy, you look a little pale. Are you sure you don’t want me to take a look at…”
Draco turns his back to the clerk to face Potter and rolls his eyes. Potter’s smile hitches up, morphing into something real as he winks at Draco, and Draco has to suppress the chuckle that bubbles up. He follows in Potter’s wake as the other man opens a closed door on the wall behind the desk. The door leads to a tiny closet, barely big enough for two people. As soon as the door closes, they are enveloped in darkness. Potter is chest to chest with Draco, and Draco’s entire front flares to life at the contact. Potter reaches over their heads to pull the chain attached to the single light bulb in the closet and there is a whooshing noise as they are pulled into the closet in the Auror offices.
A quick swish of his wrist and everything is back where it belongs. Draco sits at his desk and reads through his precise notes about the case. There must be something he has missed.
Draco knows it would be easier just to stupefy her and move on, but they need to know if she is working alone. If she has accomplices, this job will be more complicated.
Draco slams his fist on the desk and snatches his wand from its holster to cast a healing charm over his chest. The skin loses its angry red coloring and lightens to a bright pink. Draco leans over and swipes up the jar of salve and screws open the lid. The smell of lavender fills his nose and calms his racing heart. Draco gathers up his composure and puts it back on like armor. By the time he is rebuttoning his vest, his hands are steady and his heart slow.
Harry’s hair is a mess and a wicked grin is spreading over his face as he stalks up to Draco. When Harry is close to him, he reaches out and unbuttons the top button of Draco’s vest. The ghost of Harry’s fingers as they move down his chest already has Draco trembling. He’s not sure he'll survive by the time Harry gets his hands on his bare skin.
The curse didn’t just open up one of his old Sectumsempra scars, it’s split the skin along the scar line. The wound isn’t bleeding anymore, but it burns and the scar tissue is raw and angry. A bruise is creeping along his side and Draco leans against the wall to catch his breath. He’s had worse injuries—his job is dangerous—but these scars hold so much memory and pain that the weight of them seems to be pressing into him more than the pain of the curse that caught him this morning.
Draco makes a list of everyone in the department who could remotely be interested in him. Names that are added to the list are mostly there because of age. He’s dated men and women over the years so gender doesn’t shorten his list, unfortunately. In the end, the list is so long as to be unusable. By the end of the evening, he isn’t any closer to an answer, and he crawls into bed, irritable and frustrated.
The smile on the clerk falters, but they look down at a slip of paper by the register. “Rueben with a cider. Mr. Draco Malfoy. Long blonde hair and probably not smiling.” They look up, brown eyes shining with mirth. “You’re the right chap, right?”
Draco leans forward, slowly like he’s giving Harry time to change his mind, which really is laughable, and Harry closes the gap, moving faster than Draco. The press of their lips is chaste, and Harry pulls back enough to see Draco’s face, eyes wide and searching, before Harry palms the back of Draco’s head and drags him back down for another kiss.
Harry begins the knitting spell. Draco’s body tenses and he sucks in a breath, fingers clutching painfully to Harry. Harry is careful, knows that a badly knitted wound can be worse than having it fixed at all.
The next morning they go back to collect the surveillance recordings. Harry stays in Draco’s office as they listen to the recordings and read the print outs. At the end of the day, they have enough evidence and some names. Draco keeps stealing glances at Harry, and every time Harry is looking at him. They end up sitting next to each other, heads bent together, working and reaching out every few minutes to touch each other. Draco knows he should be concentrating on the work, but Harry’s hand is on his thigh and all Draco can think about is how Harry’s mouth was in that exact same spot hours ago.
“Nothing upstairs except some potion making things. We’ll need a cleanup crew after we leave to make sure nothing is dangerous.”
Draco’s hand moves from around Potter’s waist and cups his arse, grinding their bodies together. The movement drags a gasp from Potter as their hard, trouser covered cocks rub together with enough friction to be maddening.
The noises Draco is making go straight to Harry’s own aching cock. If he lasts through this, it will be a miracle. Harry moves with strong, slow strokes, adding his hand to his mouth to give Draco more pressure. Draco squirms beneath him and lifts one leg so that his heel is resting on the tiled bench. It gives Draco more leverage to thrust up into Harry’s mouth. Harry smiles around the cock in his mouth and picks up the pace, knowing neither one of them is going to last much longer.
The first thing Draco does is try to place a tracing spell on the parchment. The wards covering the paper pop in his hand, but reveal nothing. Whoever sent this is powerful, which of course considering they’re an Auror, Draco shouldn’t be surprised. It does make him more determined to find an answer.
“No, it bloody well isn’t. Fuck. If you see Potter, give him this and tell him I went to Mungo’s.” Draco shoves the paper into Weasley’s hand and is back out the door.
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous.” Draco puts his hands over Harry’s knees and slides up his legs with firm pressure. When his face is right over Harry’s cock, he takes the head in his mouth and enjoys the salty taste of Harry before he looks up and says, “I hope you know that after this, I’m never letting you go either. I have a lot of things I’d like to do with you and not all of them are dirty. I like quiet Saturday mornings with tea and books.”
Draco pulls back. “I have some ideas, some ways we could fill the time, if you will come home with me.”
Potter takes a step forward as the witch turns and steps back, raising her wand. She smiles, wide and with menace. “It’s either a very slow day at the Ministry or they must really think I’m something to send the Saviour and the Traitor after me. I must admit, I’m a bit flattered.”
Draco smirks and stands, hauling Harry to his feet. “I do, actually.” Draco grabs the waist of Harry’s trousers and pulls them down. Harry steps out of his trousers, keeping his eyes on Draco. Harry can’t resist pulling Draco to him, their naked bodies flush and pressing into each other greedily. Harry licks into Draco’s mouth.
Draco pulls out his wand and looks over his shoulder. Everyone is going about their business and no one is looking his way. He takes cautious steps up to his desk and casts silent charms to detect poison or magic. They all come up negative.
Harry kisses him this time, and soon enough Harry is straddling Draco and their tea is cold by the time they leave the bed again.
Draco laughs, warm and gentle. “You look like I’m going to say no. Of course I’ll go on a date with you. I’m glad you finally asked.”
Potter nods and pushes himself from the door. “I just need to grab my robe. I’ll meet you by the door.”
Against the wall, there’s someone tied on the floor, a Muggle by the look of her clothes. Standing with her back to them is a tall, lanky witch, clad in robes that have seen better days.
Harry winks at Draco, something warm and hopeful unfurling in his chest. “That doesn’t sound all that bad.” Harry reaches behind Draco and turns the water back on. “I meant what I said earlier. You deserve to be happy, Draco.”
Potter is there, slightly rumpled after a long day of work, though Draco has noticed Potter always looks like he could use a good ironing no matter the time of day. If the man would just get a house-elf like a civilized person, his clothes wouldn’t always be so wrinkled. Potter’s sleeves are rolled up, exposing muscular forearms and he has those blasted suspenders on again.
There’s truth in that. Draco has wanted Harry for so long, longer than he even had a good understanding of his own sexuality. Harry has always been a force of nature in his life, which is why he often reacted so very badly to Harry when they were young.
They Apparate outside the Ministry and, from the looks of the landmarks, end up in a neighborhood on the outskirts of London. Draco follows Potter to a nondescript cottage with wooden beams and a stone face. The garden in the front is untidy with a riot of blooms and fat bumblebees buzzing in the late morning sun. Potter lifts the iron knocker and knocks three times, pauses then knocks a fourth time.
“You know it’s illegal to practice magic on Muggles.” Potter is using his calm voice, the one he tempers to sound as unthreatening as possible, the kind of voice you use on crying children.
The clerk hands over the paperwork and the wizard takes the unconscious and levitating witch into custody.
Blue hair shakes their head. “Sorry, mate. Morning manager left already and she said the person asked to not be described to you. Said you’d know who it was and that was all we were allowed to say.”
This one is the opposite of the first. Harry presses into the seam of Draco’s mouth, tasting him and sucking in Draco’s bottom lip. Draco makes a noise in the back of his throat that undoes Harry, and Harry wraps his free hand around Draco’s thigh, sliding his hand up firmly. Draco’s hands are all over Harry, leaving burning and desire in their wake. Harry trails open mouthed kisses over Draco’s neck and Draco tips his head to give Harry more access.
Harry opens his eyes, meets the warm grey eyes boring holes into him, and traces his fingers over the scars on Draco’s stomach. “For these. For everything.”
“We need to ask you some questions,” Draco asserts, ignoring the witch’s use of the nicknames he hates so much.
The smell of lavender and citrus fills the humid space as Harry rubs the shampoo between his hands, then he reaches out to Draco’s scalp. Harry massages Draco’s head, and Draco leans into his touch. When Harry gets down to Draco’s neck, he massages the muscles there and a moan escapes Draco that goes straight to Harry’s cock. He had done so well, up until this point, trying to keep a level of separation between his desires and what he was doing, but the noises Draco is making cleave through Harry.
Draco doesn’t encourage that kind of gentle devotion in others. He receives his fair share of hate mail, though it’s more infrequent these days, but he’s never had anyone get to know his likes and quirks. Even his own mother doesn’t know what kind of tea and pies he likes best or where he purchases them.
“Auror Potter is too kind to a lowly house-elf, such as myself.” Gatty passes Draco a plate with three ginger biscuits. “Now, Auror Malfoy. There are some questions Gatty can help with?”
charm and sees that it’s already past noon. As if in protest, his stomach growls at him. Lunch first, then he can continue to explore this new lead.
Draco’s face heats and he drains the last bit of his pint. The words are too close to the truth and he’s embarrassed. Potter is watching the exchange, silent, and an unwanted desire for Potter to be jealous, of all things, rears its ugly head. Draco crushes the need he feels and stands.
Potter has on a cream colored dress shirt that sets off the warm tones in his skin and red and yellow suspenders. The suspenders really are garish, ridiculous Gryffindor nonsense, but the way they lay on Potter’s chest still makes Draco notice more than he should. He should not be noticing Potter at all. But he does, Merlin help him.
After staring blankly for an hour at the interview he conducted with Marjorie before she was killed, Draco gets up, stretches, and goes to make tea. He’s not paying attention as he carries it back to his desk and runs straight into Potter. The tea manages to miss Potter completely and spills all down the front of Draco’s shirt and vest. He hisses in pain as the hot liquid seeps through his clothes and scalds his skin.
Draco and Potter rise to leave. Gatty pushes a bundle into Potter’s hand. “Some biscuits for the road.”
In the morning, when he walks into his office, there’s a bag of chocolate Milky Buttons and a simple note written with a quick quill.
Draco moves away, irritated that he still feels the imprint from Potter’s fingers when he does so. “Salazar, Potter, did you expect me to be something else?”
Potter nods, seemingly unaffected by Draco’s touch even though Draco feels like his entire hand and arm are being licked by Friendfyre. “Pints tonight?”
Draco frowns at the note. He didn’t order food. Draco sends an affirmative reply and waits for the runner with a blooming curiosity. The runner comes along three minutes later, pink cheeked and young.
Every Thursday, Draco goes to a muggle deli about a mile from the Ministry. He always walks. It gives him a chance to clear his mind and mull over whatever he’s working on that day. He Apparates to a safe place and starts walking. The sun is warm on his skin and Draco lets the warmth loosen him. He can feel the tension leaving him with each step. By the time he goes through the doors of Honey & Hops, a deli that serves ciders and ales by the pint with their sandwiches and small plates, he’s almost lost the tightness from being around Potter.
Granger’s eyes are glittering. “This will also give us some sympathy and evidence for me to push through the legislation. Excellent work.”
Harry just laughs at him and pulls him toward the closed door off the main living space. “I assume this is your bedroom.”
Draco takes care of the arrangements for Margorie’s remains. She’s to be cremated and sent to Draco, who thinks he can spread them on the grounds at Malfoy Manor. It has some pretty parks that would be a nice resting place for a forgotten woman. When his business at Mungo’s is finished, Draco goes back to the Ministry and sits at his desk.
Harry comes back with two tea cups and saucers with a pizzelle next to Draco’s saucer. He hands one cup to Draco and Draco takes a sip. It has the perfect amount of milk and just a touch of sugar, exactly how Draco likes it.
Draco explores all the leads he has with his case and on Thursday he’s pacing his office in the morning trying to decide who he can interview for information he may have missed. He sees Potter approaching his office and slows his feet, grabbing the back of his chair.
Potter is already halfway across the maze of desks and offices, and Draco forces his feet to move in the same direction, keeping his breathing even and deep. Potter is standing behind his desk in the small office they share when Draco pauses in the doorway. He places a hand on the door frame and breathes past the pain.
Harry’s pupils are wide and his voice scratches out of his throat. “Yes, please, Draco. I want your mouth on me.”
Gatty looks to Potter, who nods encouragingly at him again. “Yes, sir. Margot told Gatty she had escaped from some people holding her and knew the people that had captured her and was afraid they would find her here.”
Harry closes the space between them and places a short kiss on Draco’s cheek. Draco is really going to have to talk to Harry about kissing him at work, but not today.
Potter is beside him, a blush darkening his already brown skin. “Sorry, Malfoy. I was thinking about the new case you got assigned yesterday. Hermione wants to talk to you about it. She thinks it might be related to the legislation she’s working on. Told me to tell you to swing by later today to talk to her.”
Ginny winks at him and grabs the drinks. Draco takes what glasses are left and they settle down to an evening of drinking. Draco doesn’t talk much, he never does, unless he has something especially witty to say. Eventually the evening winds down until it’s just Granger, Weasley, Potter and himself.
Draco explains about the tea, the meat pie, and about his lunch being paid for. Ron looks intrigued, Potter is looking everywhere but at Draco, and Granger’s face is soft.
Another clerk calls his name, he gets up to grab his lunch, and returns to his table. He eats his sandwich, it’s as delicious as always, and thinks about who would be so kind to him.
Harry slaps him on the ass. “You have your serious face on. I hope you’re not talking yourself out of this.”
When they were first paired together, Harry had been hesitant, resentful on the worst days, but over the last two years, Harry had come to respect Malfoy. He is a talented wizard whose quick thinking has saved Harry on more than one occasion. Like today. Malfoy took the curse that was meant for Harry without hesitation. The worry for Malfoy pushes at him again, and Harry hurries to finish so he can go check on his partner.
Draco puts his hands on his hips and feels eyes on his neck. He turns and Potter is there, watching him. Draco can feel a flush stain his cheeks and he wonders how much of the  conversation Potter overheard.
Draco steps into the water and lets the heat of it wash away everything. He tries to empty his mind of all the dark thoughts and places both palms on the cool tiles of the shower. The pain in his side is still there, but the contact with the tile keeps him from shaking. Draco stands there, breathing evenly and wishing for things he’ll never have.
Draco takes another sip and eyes Harry, who is watching him a little intently. “How do you know how I take my tea?”
Draco is saved from making a sarcastic remark in Potter’s direction by the re-entry of Gatty, carrying a large tray of tea things. The house-elf pours the tea and hands a cup to each of them before serving himself.
Draco’s eyes are sore from reading when he finally leaves. Wrapping himself in his crimson cloak, he leaves the Ministry and makes his way home to his flat. On his threshold, the sound of wings reaches his ears and he turns to find a brown owl blinking at him, holding out its leg. Draco takes the letter and goes inside.
It’s rather foolish, he admits to himself, that there is one person he wishes would be interested in him enough to make these kinds of gestures and overtures. One person whom he would welcome as a romantic partner, one person who fills Draco with need and want that is tangible. It’s been years since Draco has admitted that there is one weakness to which he has never found the cure. Draco’s desire that his admirer be a man with bright green eyes and a scar on his forehead will not make it so.
He flips over the paper and examines it. There’s a watermark he recognizes because he uses this paper everyday. It is Ministry paper, from the Auror Office to be exact. The writer of this letter is surely the same person who has been gifting him things for the past two weeks, and now Draco finally has something to go on.
Draco is sitting on the bench to the right of the water’s spray, naked and gleaming, so much better than anything Harry could have imagined, but Malfoy’s posture is wrong.  There are long jagged scars that run in white lines over Malfoy’s torso, scars that Harry knows he caused all those years ago. The sight of them makes Harry sick. Malfoy is pale and gasping on the bench, a red line runs down the length of one of the larger ropey scars on his side. Malfoy makes a small sound of distress.
There’s a line of dried blood on Draco’s thigh where the wound had dripped down, and Harry moves his hand down, small circles cleaning and hands gentle. Harry is dangerously close to parts of Draco that he has only fantasized about, and he lets his eyes slide sideways. It’s a mistake. Draco is half hard and Harry sucks in a breath and shuts his own eyes.
Draco unbuttons his trousers and divests himself of the rest of his clothes with deliberation because Harry’s eyes are glittering with greed and want as they follow his every move. Draco stalks back to the bed and crawls over Harry until he can cover him again, bracing himself on his arms. Draco kisses Harry, and Harry’s hands are everywhere, running over Draco, leaving a path of fire in their wake. Every time their cocks slide together, Draco stops breathing. By the time Draco breaks the kiss, they’re both shaking with need.
Harry slows his descent as his lips touch the top of the first scar that patterns Draco’s chest, a scar he caused. Harry’s heart constricts.
Draco is relieved at the easier assignment. They’d just returned from a month-long overseas operation that involved multiple teams, and Draco is glad to be back to working with just the two of them, as if they really are friends. When they work alone he doesn’t have to contend with the sideways glances and snide remarks from other teams that make Potter’s expression go stiff and make Draco’s insides like stone.
It doesn’t occur to Harry to wonder how Draco knows he has a question on the tip of his tongue. They’ve spent too much time together. They know each other so well that these past two years have increasingly been torture.
Potter starts laughing next to him and Weasley snorts. Draco’s mouth turns up and everything loosens in his chest with the realization that this group of people somehow are his friends or something like it. He swallows down emotions along with the last of his pint.
Draco intends for the kiss to be soft, a question of what could come next, but Potter’s hand slides around his neck and threads through his hair. Potter gets a fistful of the long strands and pulls gently. The tug of it goes straight to Draco’s cock and he groans. The moment his mouth opens Potter plunges in, and from there nothing is gentle about the kiss. It’s filthy, open mouths and years of hidden fantasies that Draco has never let see the light of day.
Potter’s hand shakes as he reaches for the offered bag and Draco notices, though Potter tries to cover it up with a surprised smile that’s a bit too wide, even for him. “I used to steal these from my cousin when we were young. He started counting them though when he suspected so I haven’t had one in ages.”
On the paper, there is an address that Draco knows is a Muggle PO Box at a local mail center. “Thank you, Gatty. This is extremely helpful.”
In hindsight, Draco should have expected it, should have been better prepared. Potter takes a step closer to the woman slumped against the wall. Draco moves closer to the witch. Potter shifts his eyes for a second, and that is when she strikes. Draco sees her intent and her intake of breath and he surges forward, praying he’s not too late.
Draco huffs out a breath. “Of all the ways I imagined this, I never thought to have you kneeling in front of me in the shower and me with my mouth running.” Draco looks down at Harry’s undone trousers. “Looks like we both could use a bit of a wash now. Stand up and take off your trousers.”
Gatty’s face falls and his ears droop. “Margot left yesterday. Gatty tried to keep her, but she was scared. She did leave Gatty a way to contact her though.” Gatty slips a piece of paper across the low table to Draco.
In the end, that’s what rips through Harry like fire, the way Draco says his name, part plea, part prayer, and Harry is only too happy to provide relief and answers. Harry braces both of his hands on Draco’s thighs and sucks down Draco’s cock until it bumps against the back of Harry’s throat. Draco hisses and threads a hand through Harry’s hair, yanking it as Harry pulls his head back, sucking in, before plunging back down.
Draco figures that these three did figure out how to defeat Voldemort. They might be able to help him with his personal mystery.
Draco immediately scoffs at himself. If his seventh year self could see him now, he’d be both elated and ashamed at how little Draco has done with his social life. Outside of his Thursday nights at the pub, he doesn’t go out much, hasn’t dated, and spends most of his time alone.
The shower room is steamy and damp. The doors to all the shower rooms are open except for the last one. The showers were made so that you could close up each individual shower, run the water on hot and have a sauna instead of a shower if needed.
Potter’s eyes are wide when they meet his. He licks his lips, his eyes darting down to Draco’s lips before darting back up. “I’ll always come when you ask me to.”
Draco grabs Harry’s hand and Apparates them straight into his flat. He has a brief flare of fear he left something out or that his space would be untidy even though Draco knows everything is in the place it belongs. He tries to drop Harry’s hand to take a step and look around to make sure, but Harry squeezes his hand and pulls him closer.
The shop smells of old paper and dust and Draco can’t help but inhale the scent. It reminds him of long nights spent in the library at Hogwarts and, later, of long nights in the library at the Ministry, doing research with Potter as they prepared for an assignment or worked out a mystery. Potter’s eyes always look especially nice in the candlelight, poring over a book and Draco has to shake the memory out of his head. Now is not the time for daydreaming. That will get them both killed.
One room has an old mattress with a pile of dirty clothes in the corner. The other room is filled with paper, a cauldron, and potions ingredients. Finding nothing, Draco goes downstairs. The Muggle is gone and Potter is kneeling by the witch, binding her for transport.
“I want to wrap my mouth around you and suck you until you come. Can I do that?” Harry is breathless by the time he gets to the end of his question.
Draco can smell the meat pie in the bag before he opens it. It’s from the bakery near his flat - he recognizes the paper bag because he gets this meal on the days he works late and doesn’t have time to cook when he gets home. Draco doesn’t know who would know his habits enough to send this to him, but it must be a coincidence. There isn’t anyone who would take the time to know Draco well enough or care about him enough to make sure he ate. The truth of that stings more than it should, but it’s a reality Draco has lived with for a long time now.
Draco runs his fingers over the scars and presses into the one that is now open, letting the intensity of the pain ground him. Draco can still see Potter's face when he gave him these scars, still see the heat of the anger and hate on Potter’s face. Draco knows he deserves every one of these scars. They are a reminder of mistakes he’s made—mistakes that he should never be allowed to forget lest he make them again or start to think he deserves anything more than what his life holds. He’s thankful for the tentative friendship with Potter, for the occasional visits he spends with his mother, and for his empty, lonely flat.
The showers on the Auror level are large and sparkling with grey and white tile. Off the main room there’s a sauna, showers, and soaking tubs. Draco heads to the showers and goes into the one on the far end. The door is mostly opaque glass and leads into a small room where Draco pulls off his cloak, hissing as the movements stretch the place where the curse hit him. He unbuttons his vest and it peels away, revealing a patch of sticky blood on his nice shirt. Draco removes the ruined shirt, then reaches over to start the shower before inspecting the damage on his side.
“Do you have a description of the werewolf?” Draco asks, pulling a small notebook and Muggle pen from his vest pocket.
Draco runs a hand over his hair, smoothing it back from his face. He knows he’s vain about his hair. He keeps it long, like his father did, but his hair has a slight wave like his mother’s and he sees Potter follow his movements with his eyes. He absolutely does not do an internal preen at his hair being noticed.
Potter plops down in a wingback chair. He manages to look comfortable and on alert at the same time. It’s a skill that Potter uses often. Draco has no idea how he does it.
“That’s what partners are for.” Draco doesn’t know what hurts worse, the loss of contact with Potter or the burning in his side. He breathes through the pain of both and schools his facial features.
As soon as Harry is done, Draco straightens up on his knees and uses his wet hand on himself. Harry places his hand over Draco’s and it only takes a couple twists and Draco loses control. Draco moans Harry’s name as his orgasm rips through him and ropes of come paint Harry’s torso. Draco's chest is heaving like he just chased down a suspect and he sees that Harry has fared no better. Harry’s cheeks are deep reddish brown and he looks thoroughly debauched.
Two hours later, Draco is still standing in the same spot, staring at the same papers, when a message comes flying into his office. He snatches it out of the air and unfolds the crane.
Draco crosses his arms across his chest. This is starting to be more than a coincidence. “Someone paid for my order?”
“Yes, of course. I need to follow up on this.” Draco stops Potter from leaving with a hand on his arm. Draco can feel Potter’s muscles tense under his touch and a curl of
“It’s been lovely, as always. Granger, Weasley, Potter.” Draco inclines his head to each of them and leaves without glancing behind him.
The wound isn’t bleeding much, a small drip on the tiles below Draco’s side, but the reopened scar is rough and there is already bruising along the edges. Harry knows that some curses cause damage deep in the tissue and, from the pain Draco is in, Harry thinks this curse is still slicing it’s way, slowly. It will keep doing so until the wound is closed. Harry lifts Draco’s arm with his left hand, fingers threading through Draco’s.
“Petite witch, black hair in a single braid down her back, pale skin, and a tattoo of a bird on her throat. The woman said her name was Margot.”
“Salazar, Harry, your mouth.” Draco licks his lips and smiles at Harry as he slides his mouth slowly over Harry’s straining cock.
Draco doesn’t answer Harry right away. He shifts so he can unbutton and unzip Harry’s trousers. Draco pulls Harry’s trousers and pants down at the same time, revealing Harry’s twitching cock, it’s end glistening with precome. Draco runs a hand over himself and his mouth waters at the sight.
The war is seven years gone and he’s developed a friendship of sorts with Potter, if you define friendship as someone you occasionally share sarcastic barbs with over a pint. Draco is loath to admit that he enjoys his weekly trips to the pub down the street from the Ministry with the Golden Trio and whoever else shows up. Other people always show up when those three are together. They’re like magnets because people find them relatable - something Draco’s been told he lacks. Underneath his relationship with Potter, Weasley, and Granger is an underlying tension because Draco still has something to prove. Some days he thinks he’s going to spend his entire life spackling over the mistakes of his youth and the sins of his family.
Draco glares at all of them. “As I was saying. We solved the case. A group of wix opposed to your legislation have been kidnapping werewolves, some to sell out of the country and some they drug then let loose in populated areas to cause damage.”
Draco sighs and Harry gulps past years of longing and rinses the soap out of Draco’s hair. There is a washcloth sitting next to Draco and Harry picks it up next.
The clerk, a young witch with short black hair, makes some notes on the papers in front of her and touches her wand to a bowl on her desk. A paper bird flaps up from the bowl and flies through the hallway behind her.
Potter steps out of the closet and Draco takes a breath before following him. The pain in his side is acute at this point and there is a pinching every time he draws in a breath. Draco refuses to crumble. He learned long ago that showing weakness brought nothing but more pain and sorrow, and he wants so much to not show failure to Potter. He’s worked too hard to get to where he is with Potter. He thinks they might be something like friends, and there are few people whose opinion Draco really cares about—he admits that Potter is one of them.
Potter nods and goes to untie the Muggle and alter her memory a bit. Draco goes up the stairs, making an effort to walk normally until he gets to the top of the stairs. He presses a hand to his side, and the pain causes black spots to swirl in his vision. He draws in a breath and waves his wand in a simple healing spell. The bleeding slows to a gentle seeping, but the pain is still there, deep and sharp. Normally, the rending curse would have done a small amount of damage, but Draco can feel one of his old Sectumsempra scars open and aching. He doesn’t want to take the time to fix himself up here, doesn’t want Potter to know what that cost him. Draco takes one more breath, gathering his energy, and walks through the two rooms that are above the bookshop.
Potter opens the memo and raises his eyebrows a bit before handing it over to Draco. Draco scans the paper, pulling the details he needs and rolls them around his head. There’s a suspected dark wizard holed up in a bookstore in Bath, causing some problems for the Muggles in the area near the shop. It’s not a high risk mission and something they should be able to take care of before the end of the day.
Harry opens the door slowly—giving Malfoy the chance to do what, Harry doesn’t know—and what he sees shifts the floor under his feet.
Potter puts a hand on his hip and leans into Draco’s space, and Draco forgets what they’re discussing. “I meant that you’re always so aloof and put together. Some witnesses and resources find you intimidating.”
Gatty rises to his full height. “Gatty receives some money from the Ministry and there are some donors. We get by.”
“Prisoner for questioning in case number 36475,” Potter tells the clerk. “We’ll need to send a cleanup crew to the address in the file.”
Draco takes a step closer to Potter, unable to resist doing so, loving the way Potter’s blush deepens further. “What did you mean?”
Keeping the arm in place that’s holding them together, Draco uses his free hand to remove Potter’s glasses and cup the other man’s face. “Harry.”
Draco glares at Harry and pulls down on the edges of his vest. “Yes, well, Harry and I realized we have some mutual feelings for each other and also we solved the case.”
When the lift opens onto the Auror floor, Weasley spots him and comes running, which is never a good sign.
Potter nods and pulls out his wand, all business. Something like regret at how easy Potter falls into business with him pinches his chest. Draco focuses on the building in front of him.
The only soap in the shower is the shampoo, so Harry spreads more of that on the washcloth, then kneels again between Draco’s feet. Harry rubs small, light circles over Draco’s skin, careful of the bruising around the injury. Draco shifts and opens his eyes, watching Harry with something in his gaze that burns through Harry like a storm. Harry feels like every inch of skin he cleans on Draco’s torso is unraveling his self control, pulling on threads Harry thought long tangled and out of sight.
Harry slides Draco's vest off and then walks away, folding the garment, before laying it on the lounge chair in the corner of Draco’s room. Harry starts in on the buttons of Draco’s shirt and Draco comes to life, putting his fingers under Harry’s suspenders and pushing them off Harry’s shoulders. Draco allows himself to run his palms over Harry’s shoulders, pressing his thumbs along Harry’s clavicles as he does so. Harry leans into the touch and Draco can’t help but close the space between them so he can rub his aching cock into Harry’s.
Potter leans a shoulder into the doorframe of Draco’s office. “While I was talking to an informant in my case, they let slip something I thought might help you with your missing werewolf.”
Gatty turns to Potter and Potter nods at him. “Gatty trusts Auror Potter. Auror Potter helped Gatty and some under Gatty's care many, many times and said Gatty should tell you what Gatty knows.” The house-elf clears his throat. “Two weeks ago, a werewolf came here looking for shelter. Gatty has a special room for them, if they need it on the full moon, and it was open so Gatty let her stay. Gatty's never had any trouble, you see, and doors aren't locked or nothing like that. People are wandering in at all hours of the night and day, but this is a safe place.”
Harry’s smile is gentle as he cups Draco’s face. “I’ll go make us some tea.” Draco starts to get up off the bed, but Harry pushes him back down with a hand on his shoulder. “No, you stay. I’ll go.”
Draco deflates a little. He’s not sure what he expected - for Potter to confess, maybe - but Draco is seized with irritation. If Potter admired him, if he felt flames every time Draco was near the same way that Draco did when Potter was anywhere close to him why wouldn’t he admit it? Draco tears his eyes from Potter, who is no longer looking at him, and Draco straightens his spine.
Potter’s eyes dart to him and he sits carefully beside Draco. “Are you all right, mate? That curse looked nasty.”
“Seems clear,” Potter’s voice is low and reaches Draco’s ears as he pushes into the front room of the shop.
Draco’s spine straightens further. “Now look here, Potter. That’s not what I meant. You could’ve just told me all of that in the first place.”
Draco shifts so he can wrap his fingers around Harry’s hard length. Draco rubs his thumb over the leaking hole and Harry’s hips give an involuntary jerk. “Eventually, I’d like to do more, but I’d really like to suck you off, if that’s ok.”
Draco allows himself to smile at Potter. “The idiots across the way who think they’re involved in actual criminal activities haven’t bothered to put up a significant ward or charm to protect them except a muggle camera in the front of the building and a ward that will alert them when someone comes through the front door.”
Harry’s hand shakes a little as he removes his shirt and glasses but it’s steady when he reaches over Draco’s head and turns the shower back on. “I’m going to wash your hair first.”
Padma and Ginny show up a short time later, hand in hand and laughing at a shared joke. Over these nights of drinking, Draco has become closer to Ginny and then Padma after the two started dating. Draco smiles as they approach the table.
Draco gives the house-elf a slight bow. “Thank you. If Margot contacts you, please let me know.” Draco puts his card into Gatty’s hand. “And if there is any way I can be of assistance to you, please let me know.”
Draco’s hand moves from Harry’s shoulder, slides over his neck, and cups Harry’s face. Draco runs a thumb over Harry’s cheekbone, and Harry leans into the touch like a starved man because he is, has been for years. There is no way, after all this time, that Harry could ever resist the gravitational pull of the man in front of him.
“I have a haughtiness that can be off-putting?” Draco’s lips curl up as Potter becomes more uncomfortable. He’s not actually upset by Potter’s words - the man is correct - but Draco is relishing the way he is making Potter fidget.
Draco turns the corner on the way to his office and runs straight into Potter, whose head was down and whose hands are full of papers. Potter is startled into dropping his papers, and Draco absolutely does not notice how solid Potter’s chest feels as he bumps into the other man or how broad his shoulders look in the dress shirt and suspenders he has on today. Draco has tried not to notice the days Potter wears suspenders because they show off every inch of the man Potter has become. Draco fails miserably at not noticing.
It’s more than he deserves. The inside of the house is bright, natural light from the windows bounce off light colored walls. Gatty leads them into the sitting room on the left and waves a hand at the chairs.
“Turn around slowly. This doesn’t have to get messy.” Potter’s wand is pointed at the witch with a steady hand.
Harry raises his eyebrows at Draco. “So you think because I have a soft spot for you, you can order me about.”
When Draco is putting the last of their notes together to send to Robards so a team can be assembled, Granger shows up in the doorway of his office.
Harry clears his throat. “I, uh, know you like meat pies when you work late and I know you have a penchant for Rueben’s on Thursdays.” Harry’s eyes sweep down at the end.
Draco’s hand goes to his shoulder, his grip is firm, and the heat of his hand pushes Harry to the breaking point.
Draco huffs and goes to find a small table. There’s one in the far back corner and he mulls this newest act of kindness with an open mind. He could dismiss the other things as anomalies, but this is happening too often to be random. Someone knows how he takes his tea, what biscuits he likes best with tea, which meat pastry is his favorite and which place makes them, and what his exact order is at Honey & Hops. Someone is either stalking him in the nicest way possible or he has a secret admirer.
“Please sit down and be comfortable. Gatty will bring in some tea.” Gatty disappears into the house.
As if that is a catalyst, Harry yanks Draco’s shirt out of his trousers and Draco runs his hand into Harry’s hair and presses their mouths together. Harry moans against Draco’s mouth and Draco’s tongue plunges into Harry, using his other hand to keep their waists together. Harry manages to pull off Draco’s shirt, but this article of clothing is tossed onto the floor. Draco doesn’t care in the slightest because his exposed nipples are now rubbing against the slight sprinkling of hair on Harry’s chest. Draco doesn’t remember getting Harry’s shirt open but it is and Draco can’t get enough of Harry’s warm skin beneath his palms.
“Salazer, Potter watch where you’re going.” Draco kneels down and starts picking up the papers littering the floor.
Potter sweeps up the witch’s wand and is beside Draco in two long legged strides. Draco hisses between his teeth as the pain digs into him. “I’ll be fine. Let’s get this cleaned up. You take care of the Muggle and I’ll check upstairs.”
Potter moves and stands beside Draco at the window. His Auror cloak brushes against Draco’s legs and, though it’s impossible, Draco feels warmth from the touch. He swallows.
Harry whispers the spell, waving his wand down the length of the wound. Draco’s fingers tighten on Harry’s hand, but the other man holds still. Sweat, both from the heat of the enclosed room and from being this close to something Harry has only imagined, breaks out over Harry’s forehead.
Draco presses his thumb and finger into Harry’s chin and makes Harry lift his face. “None of that now.”
“I completed the preliminary interviews today and I went to see Granger to keep her updated. Thanks for that help. She had some information that was enlightening. Now, I’m trying to find where all the pieces fit.” Draco leans his hip against his desk and meets Potter’s gaze.
“The deceased?” Infuriated that his only lead is gone and his day has gone from irritating to infuriating and he hasn’t even had more than one cup of tea yet, Draco kicks at the waste bin nearest to him.
“Merlin, I’m sorry. Malfoy are you all right?” Harry waves his wand and dries the tea and cleans Draco’s robes.
Potter’s green eyes blink slowly at him. “Well, don’t stay too late, Malfoy. You need your beauty sleep.”
Draco lets go of the chair and straightens up. “Wonderful. I have reached a lull and was looking for a new avenue. You have excellent timing.”
Draco puts one hand on his wand tucked inside his fitted Auror’s cloak and reaches out with the other hand to open the door slowly, knowing Potter’s wand is out and he’s checking to see if the shop is warded.
Potter is sitting in their small office in the Ministry building when the memo flies through the door, zooming over Draco’s head as he places a cup of tea in front of Potter and eases himself into his own chair, his own tea cupped between his palms. Potter snatches the memo out of the air, his dark fingers quick and delicate enough to catch it without damaging it. Potter is careful with how he touches things, intentional with his gentleness or pressure when it’s needed. It was one of the first things Draco noticed about him after being paired during training. His next revelation was that Potter almost never touched Draco, as if touching him would burn him. Draco tries not to dwell on that truth and pushes the reminder away that for all the respect and almost friendship, Harry would choose to let him loose if he could.
He’s no better than Potter. He’s been keeping a secret and he’s been refusing to admit it as well. Someone out in the world cares enough about Draco to send him pies and candy, to pay for his lunch, and to write him letters that brighten his day. If one person could feel those things for him, perhaps Potter could as well.
Draco huffs but there’s a smile playing with his lips as he says, “If I was to be honest, your ability to create chaos in every space you inhabit is irritating in the extreme.”
“Oh yes, please. Your gingersnaps are the best.” Harry’s smile brightens as Gatty blushes with the praise.
Draco is a little lightheaded at Potter telling anyone else about him and putting him into the category of
Potter’s smile breaks over his face and Draco’s heart shifts a little, something he pointedly ignores. “Brilliant. See you then.”
Harry is beside the other man and on his knees without realizing he’s moved. “Malfoy,” Harry cups the side of Draco’s face. “Draco, why didn’t you tell me?”
Harry runs his hand down Draco’s arm. “I’m going to heal this and then you and I are going to have a nice long chat about keeping things like this from your partner.” Draco nods, pain filled eyes tracking Harry’s movements. Harry reaches behind Draco and turns off the shower.
Harry signs the report by habit, barely paying attention to what he’s doing, the need to see Malfoy creeping in, like a wave lapping at shore, slow and eroding. He smiles a little at the presence of his concern. A few years ago he would have avoided Malfoy at all costs. Harry spoke up at Malfoy’s trial because it had been the right thing to do and Malfoy deserved a chance to make different choices. They’d all been kids in an adult’s war, used in various ways by the people around them, even those that loved them. All of them deserved a chance to break free from that and find what new beginning they could after the war. Even Malfoy. Especially Malfoy.
“I know no one else wanted the case and that’s why it’s mine.” Draco doesn’t hide the derision in voice.
Draco nods, his eyes tracking Harry’s every move, and Harry feels them like weights are pressing into his chest. Harry pulls the shower head out of the holder and sprays Draco with the water, careful to keep as much of it out of his face as possible. Harry runs his fingers over Draco’s hair to make sure that the water has dampened everywhere. The shower head goes back into the holder and Harry reaches for the shampoo.
“I’m about out too, Gin.” Weasley shakes his glass at his sister. She sticks her tongue out at her brother, but Draco knows she’ll bring him back a pint of the brown ale he prefers.
Potter steps up close to Draco and peers into the room with the still figure on the bed, covered with a sheet. “Sorry, Malfoy. I know that was your only lead.”
Draco sits down on the edge of the settee with a horrid floral pattern next to Potter’s chair. “Who are we here to see?”
Potter claps Draco on the shoulder and Draco does his best not to wince. “Let’s get the paperwork out of the way and get out of here.”
Draco marshalls his courage and closes the heated space between them. He slides his hand into Potter’s robe and along his hip. “I’d like to kiss you.”
“You don’t look fine.” Potter pauses and looks at Draco. “I’ll take care of the paperwork. You go down to the showers. The steam and heat might help where you got hit.”
Draco takes the message Weasley hands him, his stomach already dropping with dread. The note is from Gatty. The witness, a young female werewolf, was attacked last night and is at St. Mungo’s.
Draco and Potter walk to the end of the garden path and Draco is stopped with Potter's hand on his arm. “Thank you for being kind to Gatty.”
Monday dawns cloudy. The moment Draco leaves his flat, the skies open up their maw and let forth a torrent of rain. With a curse, Malfoy Apparates to somewhere closer to the Ministry. He dries himself with a quick charm once he’s inside, but his hair, which was perfectly brushed before, is less tidy than he likes. With a sigh, Draco pulls it back into an untidy bun.
Three knocks, then a fourth sound on the door before Potter slips into the room just in time to hear the very uncivilized noise Draco made.
Potter smiles that charming smile he has that Draco knows is mostly show. “Of course. Paperwork is of the utmost importance.”
“Fuck, Malfoy, don’t get all rigid on me.” Potter runs a hand through his hair, making the curls stand up every which way. “Sometimes you have a haughtiness about you that can be off-putting, but I can tell you tried to be more relaxed with him is all.”
Harry takes Draco’s cock in his hand and gives the other man a gentle squeeze. Draco does twitch then, a sigh escaping from between his lips.
Ginny rolls her eyes at Draco. “It’s a good thing you’re pretty because when it comes to people, you’re a bit thick.”
Draco breaks the kiss and smiles at Harry. “You keep doing that, and we’ll never get out of this shower.”
Draco watches Harry’s arse as he walks away from him. Harry doesn’t bother to put his pants back on and he throws a wink over his shoulder at Draco as he walks out of the room.
Draco eases into his chair and tentatively raises the cup to take a sip. The blend of tea is not his usual. It’s a little smokier than he generally prefers his tea, but it’s just the way he likes it, and he takes another sip. Sitting next to the saucer is a bag that Draco recognizes. It’s from his favorite bakery and contains six of his favorite treats, delicate Pizzelles. Draco takes one out and bites into it. He closes his eyes and sighs as he chews, butter and anise bursting over his tongue. Today is starting off to be a good one.
Draco takes a step that takes him directly into Potter’s personal space. “Thank you for coming when I asked for you.” His voice sounds breathless, even to his own ears.
“Leave off, Ron.” She reaches across the table and places a hand on his arm. “Is it so hard to believe that someone would do something nice for you?”
Harry picks up the narrative and Draco can’t help but follow the movement of Harry’s lips. He doesn’t even have to hide what he’s doing and that knowledge alone is thrilling. “They’re moving the ones they have tonight at midnight. If we take a team at 11, we should be able to capture all of them.”
Harry concentrates on what he is doing. It takes longer than he wants, but when he’s done, the Sectumsempra scar is closed, angry red and bruised, along Draco’s side. Harry’s knees are protesting from being on the hard tile for so long and the dampness has seeped through his trousers, but he can't bring himself to move yet.
“I was about to get started with the surveillance charms. I was hoping you’d get here in time to place some wards with trackers over the exits of the building while I want to affix the audio spells.”
“I got your message, Harry.” She looks between the two of them and her smile widens. “I’m glad to see that you two have talked through some things.”
The bookshop is on the corner of the main thoroughfare in Bath. The front of the shop is filled with small, black paned windows that fill the front of the building. Through the windows, Draco can see old books in piles, a mixture of old tattered covers of cloth, faded paper, and new hardbacks in glossy and matte. It’s the kind of place you could get lost in for an afternoon, discovering hidden treasures and stories to take home.
“Point taken. It’s lovely to see you Luna. Good evening, everyone else,” he says to the table at large. Draco tries and fails to ignore the tingling on his side next to Potter.
Draco casts some seeking spells, looking for wards that might ping if they start putting up surveillance spells in the building across the street. Draco snorts in disbelief. There’s nothing protecting the building.
Draco holds up his hand to redirect their focus back to him. “Wait. Is the person who took the payment still here?”
“We just came here to talk,” Draco adds even though he knows they’ll be taking her in for kidnapping. Better to keep things calm.
Draco escapes, grateful that Potter is taking over the tedium of paperwork. Draco doesn’t hate the minutiae of filling out reports, but he doesn’t think he could concentrate on it at the moment. He limps down to the showers, his side a bloom of fire.
The reality that this poor woman died alone with few to mourn her punches him the sternum. “Her name was Margorie. She went by Margot and she had no one.” Draco takes one of his personal cards from his vest pocket. “Please send all her bills and details to me. I’ll take care of her body once it’s released.”
It took two years after being paired together as new Aurors, but Harry and Draco have come to an understanding in their partnership. The Ministry thought it a brilliant idea to pair the Saviour of the Wizarding World with the son of one of the families that was almost its downfall. After countless missions, they now cover each other’s backs, share a mutual respect for each other’s abilities, and are reluctant friends. If Draco sometimes lays alone at night, hands skimming down his body imagining they were Harry’s, that is between him and the walls of his flat.
