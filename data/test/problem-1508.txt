"Are you serious?  Hell yeah, I wanna go!  How many chances do you get to be there for a dragon nesting?  Can I stay ‘till it hatches?  I need to talk to Lakemore about time off, but I'm sure there'll be no problem for something of this rarity.  Merlin, I can't believe my luck!"
Agent Savage glanced over at his partner, who refused to meet his eyes.  He looked back up at Harry and Remus, "Perhaps that is true, but we still need to conduct the interview, one that hasn't been conducted by one of your friend,” he said to Remus.  “You are due anyway."
"Deadbones, hard to starboard.  Fast, before she hits the open sea!"  Luna Lovegood relays Harry's order that stirs the crew, their anticipation frothed into yawning want as Harry's wand juts towards the darkening horizon and the small merchant ship flying the flag of the Dark Mark.  Like a black cloud, his hair churns in the wind; his right eye is hidden by a black, triangular patch, his other is locked onto the ship, the dip of its sails, the rise and fall of the sea.  Terry Boot spins the wheel with quick hands; the creaking of the wooden vessel a cry for blood to the crew of the
It really wasn't a pit—it was actually quite comfortable compared to the Death Eater compound—it was just Potter that made it unbearable.  Potter's fawning.  Potter's willingness to let the past fall to the past.  To give up old grudges.  Idiot.
After several moments to compose himself, Draco climbed off Harry, sitting back on his heals to examine the man sprawled on the floor.  He wiped at his lip, shocked at the blood that came away on the back of his hand.  "Get up.  On your knees, Harry," he ordered, and Harry rose to his knees, head hanging forward, shoulders slouched in defeat.
"You're heavy," he groaned, but didn't move to push Tufts off.  It was odd how here he was, in a foreign country, in a shabby hotel room with Potter lying on top of him.  Just that thought,
He realized he was on the floor and strong arms were gripping him around the shoulders.  A slight rocking motion and soft murmuring lured him out of his frantic state, and he looked down at his legs and arms.  There were charred holes in his clothing, but when he looked at his hands, where only moments before flesh had been melting off the bone, they were whole.
Pulling himself up to his full height, he walked with purpose towards the entrance of the club.  He pulled open the door, immediately accosted by deafening music and blinding, flashing lights.  It forced him into a battle-ready mode, senses tuned, eyes quick and encompassing, magic tingling.  He scanned the few people at the bar and, recognizing no one, walked up to the barmaid.  She had long brown hair and wore a mix of trendy Muggle clothing and wizarding wear.
Draco can't help it.  He steps forward, as shocked as Pansy, and asks, "But, then what do you do with everyone you capture?  You can't keep them in that cave."  He points his finger some random direction.  The papers, the Ministry… Draco's father!  They all say that the Order of the Phoenix, the
"We bring Draco over."  How would Draco take it?  That Harry and Severus had gotten so close, so close without him.  It somehow seemed so unbalanced.  They'd talked about it, but Harry still harbored concern.
"I'm fine.  Thanks, though," Harry said, delighted that Snape asked and also surprised that his own lack of participation didn't make him feel left out.  Snape cleaned them up, then tucked himself away as Harry squirmed closer to his right side and Draco crawled up on the couch to his other.  They sat together, watching the fire crackle and pop, listening to their combined breaths, combined beats of their hearts.
Draco wondered and began categorizing potential cures so he could get the truth out of the wretch even as he pulled vegetables out of the fridge and began to prepare dinner.
And that was how Draco found himself with a broken Harry Potter in his secluded house in the highlands.
, who'd followed him all sixth year, saved his life in that last.  He'd always resented the prat for that.  He was Draco's prime adversary and he'd saved his life.  He owed Potter and they both knew it.
Eventually, every piece of paper, parchment, scroll and document encrypted with Equacrology that had been found within Hermione's apartment, had been decoded and lay in piles surrounding the three men in a filing system possibly more difficult to understand than Hermione's encryption code itself.
Stalking down the hallways—as always smooth and nondescript—he immediately ran across a T in the tunnels that he didn't recognize. He realised with resigned horror that he was lost.
He'd been obsessed with Harry for years, since that first story his father had told him about the Boy Who Lived.  He'd daydream about meeting Harry Potter.  They'd be best friends on sight and rule Hogwarts together.  Even after Harry spurned him sixteen years ago, he still dreamed of 'what if's and 'if only's.  Even after that.
"Well, Potter. Care to tell me what you can?" He let his eyes graze over the surrounding patrons of the restaurant.
"Well dear, let's go," her mother said urgently and rushed them out of Draco's office.  "Talk to you soon, Mr. Malfoy," she said over her shoulder, child in one arm, cat by her side.
Harry nodded, completely awed at the length Draco was going to help him. "But… Draco. We can't keep this up. I mean, look at you. And I have to say I don't feel all that fabulous myself."
Harry watched in awe.  He watched Draco smile and lean up against Snape, kissing the man.  He could see the dance of their tongues, and he looked down at the shape of Snape's erection as it remained, untouched, in his trousers.
"Yeah, I'm here," Draco said, his voice warm. A cool cloth settled on his forehead. It felt like heaven. "Here, take your potion."
He waited, tensed for the moment when they would begin to crawl all over him, biting and rending his flesh, but that moment never came.  Instead the rats did something completely astounding, something so odd that Harry wasn't exactly sure what he was seeing.
Before too long, he stood below a run-down building five stories high with flaking plaster covering the front façade. Its layers of grime enticed a pained groan from Draco.
Ah, in for a penny… Greg was in for a shock.  "My contact, the one Severus and I were talking with in the Order; that was Hermione Granger."
"Would you stop that!"  Harry began to beg.  "It's creepy.  I don't want to be turned on by a snake."  He encircled his hands around his upper thigh, giving up on trying to push the snake out of his trousers and now just trying to block his progress; he was as wily as a Knockturn whore on Elf Spice.
Draco's eyebrows rose.  “And how would you know that?  I didn't think you could speak to snakes anymore?”  Was what the Dark Lord had done to Harry affecting him here?  Draco took a step forward and examined Harry's eyes, seeking the soul within, but they were quickly rolled upward in exasperation.
Draco knew this was a wise choice, but he enjoyed listening to the pile of clues and facts that fit into some grander scheme, enjoyed spending time with someone who didn't think of him as a boss or someone to suck up to. Didn't think of him as a Death Eater. He enjoyed being with Harry. Damn, he was drunk.
"Thank Merlin you have Granger and Lupin to plan the attacks on Voldemort.  If it were up to you, we would all be sacrificed unnecessarily for minimal gain."  Harry watched as Draco moved his knight to take his bishop.  Damn.  He hadn't seen that.  It hadn't even been a purposeful sacrifice like he'd alluded to when Draco took his last rook.  He was really pants at chess.
Soon after, Harry passed out, totally drained from the ordeal and lack of food, and Draco began searching for Charlie again.  He had to be down here somewhere.  But he was torn; torn between searching as himself or searching as his horde.  The horde would move more quickly and overwhelmingly expand his search area, but he was already hungry and didn't know if he could stand transforming again.  Plus, he had no idea what other tricks he would have to pull from of his blood heritage to get them out of there alive.
He forced his magic into every barrier and wall within the man's mind and tore them town, thrashing about in the process. The psychic debris began to bury them both.
The hallways remained busier than usual as Harry mindlessly walked the familiar pathway to the Floo Centre of the hospital.  He didn't notice Mediwitch Periwinkle until she finally spoke to him, which was either a testament to her quiet walk or to Harry's distraction.
"Yes, you did.  Now… shall we?" Severus purred as he held out his hand, and Harry nodded dumbly as his insides dissolved into goo.
save them.  We have to!"  Harry cried out his anguish, screamed out the pain threatening to implode his heart.
Draco looked Harry up and down, a slow, methodic survey, and Harry felt his body react in all sorts of interesting ways, thankful for his layer of fur because he was certain he was experiencing an all over blush.
"Yeah."  It was the only word his addled brain could formulate.  Hand in hand the two men jogged to Draco's room, the same room they'd been sharing for months now.  They passed through the door, shedding clothing as they kissed and touched and drowned themselves in each other.  With a bounce they landed on the bed and Draco felt like laughing, giggling at his good fortune.
Nothing was working.  The sizzle rang in his ears and he could smell the sweet scent of teriyaki pork on the air.  The potion burned into the back of his hand, the meat of his palm, eating away at his meat.  His breath came in shallow sips and all he could focus on was the burning, the fucking burning, and then there was a cold flash all around him and the agony ceased.
Harry grunted at the enticing smell of perogies slathered in butter and onions.  They had to have come from the Pirozhki House, a few blocks off the wizarding section of London which stood right next to a great Thai place.  Both establishments could unknowingly attribute most of their yearly income to the younger generation of wizards and witches.
The bell rang and Remus glanced up from a large burlap bag over-stuffed with dragon egg shell shards he was reorganizing into smaller packages.
How could they do this?  How could they tie him here to suffocate, to drown?  Bubbles bead up along the hairs of his arms, gather along the surface of the ship, one or two escape, ascending with casual ease.  Shifting left, then right, he strains against the charmed ropes, his lungs seizing.
Snape had cocked an eyebrow at him, but unlike the past, he'd done what Harry suggested.  At the result he'd said, "Quite passable, Harry," and Harry'd grinned for a good five minutes at the praise.
It was beyond Harry how Draco knew how to get them out of the endless dunes.  Maybe it was something to do with his special brand of crazy.  Maybe Lucius the doll had whispered the answer.  Maybe Draco had special knowledge from his Young Death Eater days.  Harry didn't care; Draco had saved him.
He shrugged.  "I'll make it," he offered, walking towards the kitchen.  He opened the cupboard and saw that it was stuffed with food: dried, fresh and preserved.  "But… There's a full larder here."
The cat jumped onto the bed and lay across Draco's stomach, his ears half back, a sign he was unsure.
The teenagers laughed while dressing, and Snape would eye the love bites with a certain sense of amusement.  They all sat for lunch together, just like breakfast and dinner, and dug into their quiche, which was the culinary delight of the day: Snape really was a skilled cook.
He and Severus had developed a new ritual to weaken the Dark Lord using his stolen blood. The Order had their own strategy to aid in ultimately ending Voldemort's twisted existence as well. The plans were delicate, but he knew they could pull it all off, assuming nobody blundered. He wasn't normally bent to such optimism, but he didn't have anything else to hope for.
"Do you know anything about an artefact that curses people, the effect being drainage of their magical energy? Perhaps something South American?"
"Hmm, thanks.  Hits the spot."  And then, just like that, Draco smiled.  Sometimes Draco's smiles were so intense they just seemed to knock the wind right out of Harry, like he was caught by a
Harry rolled over and looked at them.  "I know that the Fae did something to us."  He eyed Draco and Severus, waiting for their response.
"  A rumble consumes the sounds of battle as the main sail slips from its gaff, thundering as the weight of it pulls down rigging and the sail's supports.  Flames rise over the side railings and the ship groans as they eat away at its flank.
"Sirius, we'll help Remus. Stop the Staff! Please!" Harry wanted to run to him, to stand by him, but he knew that he'd never escape that deadly hold. The Staff wanted Harry and Harry's own fear of that kept him away, fear of losing himself, fear of what the Staff would accomplish if Harry was its slave. Draco was on his knees, slick with silver but no longer wiping at it, instead sucking the substance off Remus with his wand.
Harry almost chuckled when Kingsley told him that, and he promised his old friend he would do his best to be
McGonagall pursed her lips, then dropped her shoulders.  "Does anyone have a theory?  It will do us no good if everyone keeps their pet projects to themselves.  Hermione, release your left hand, now.  It's making an awful racket."
He stood and then slumped into a blue velvet chair next to the Floo.  The green flames had faded and now they crackled a merry orange.  Merlin, did those two drain the will to live right out of him.
And as he sat under the bright afternoon sun, only a light jacket he'd Transfigured with Snape's wand to ward against the brief but chilled wind, munching on a chicken breast and fresh carrots, he realized he felt content.
Harry looked down at his shoes, dirty and scuffed from the dusty ground beneath the bench. "Oh, so maybe he's seeking new lackeys to keep his ego inflated?" Harry mock joked.
One empty seat remained, and on the table before that vacant spot sat a shot glass, waiting for some delicious liquor to fill it.  Draco squeezed through the small space between the wall and the chairs and sat down at this seat between Harry and Ron.  Harry and Draco always sat in the far corner by the overgrown cactus, mainly because Ginny had some inexplicable cactus fear, and Draco was one of the few people who Harry didn't get into a drinking contest with.
ad.  The paper was nothing fancy, either.  Something straight from Tescos.  Same with the glue.  And the damned thing had no fingerprints, no DNA, no magical signature, either.  It had been a dead end.
And then chain lightning began to dance in the multicoloured cloud of magic that had built up above the scene of destruction.
"Nothing sounds good," he explained and then released his grip on Harry's arm and placed his hands folded in his lap.
Draco nodded sagely.  It must be that days alone in the desolated place had caused his poor sidekick to go a bit batty.  Not that Draco blamed him; he wouldn't like to be alone like that either.  He wouldn't like having nobody to talk to, nobody to be his friend.
He found himself outside of St. James Park, one he visited often. Stumbling on weary legs he wandered in and found a bench under a large evergreen tree, a fir he thought. It smelled clean and fresh. Everything smelled better out here. He sat, pulling his collar up around his chin, and quickly dozed off.
"Well, we've gotten most of it figured out, but not totally.  I'm having problems with one part of it: tricking the current Mark into accepting my signature rather than the original one it was made from.  Everything else is all ready to go."
It was a mystery, and a Hero always faced each mystery full force, so Draco reached out, twisted the handle and was swooped away to some very dark, very bleak, very lonely landscape.
Harry stopped moving.  Slowly, he let his mind wander through the sensations over his body.  His feet were numb; they must have slipped out from under his cloak.  His left leg was wrapped up in something, his cloak maybe… is that why he was cold?  And… oh Merlin.  Something was moving across his cock.  Just the right pressure, just the right pace, and he knew it had been going on for some time because just then it was all too much, and Harry threw back his head and let the slow boil of his orgasm surge through his body like waves crashing against the ocean shore.
It was too much for him, and he fell to the ground with Draco, the cloak slipping over his bare shoulder.  He began to cry.
Harry wanted to slump into Draco's arms, let the other man hold him, warm his dead flesh to some semblance of living, but it all felt too rushed.  So much had happened in this dark night, the moon their only witness.  When he'd risen at dusk, he had no idea he'd awoken into this brave, new world.
The response was immediate.  A large tawny owl fluttered to his window and held out its leg, eagerly looking about for a treat.  Draco placed two large owl biscuits in the tray and the owl hooted in delight.
After a full night attempting to categorize the piles of parchment and paper, filing, organizing, and attempting to decipher Hermione's shorthand—neither an easy nor enjoyable task—Harry knew he could not tackle this project without help.  He had jumped into the job with such enthusiasm, finding a worthy hole to dump his vast energy into, positively sure there would be something immediately helpful and gratifying to be discovered in Hermione's notes, but his hope and energy were wasted, again.
"Fine," he called out to the man's back.  "I get it.  I don’t give up easily.  I'll just keep coming by… Everyday!"  The bartender continued talking to another customer.  "'Cause she's worth it."  A satisfied smirk danced upon Draco's lips as the bartender turned towards him and watched him walk out.
Mrs. Malfoy opened her mouth to say something, closed it, and then finally let out a deep sigh.  "I know, my Draco."  Then she chuckled.  "You know, it was what everybody did when you were a baby.  The high born children were all raised by elves."  She sipped her tea again, not looking at either of the men as she savored the flavor of the fragrant drink.  "Not to say there is anything wrong with elf-raising, but I would always sneak into your room in the dead of night and watch you breathe.  You were so delicate, such a wisp of a boy, all perfect and pink with just a whisper of stark white hair."  She smiled as she stared off into the distance, eyes unfocused on the past.
"What!  I'm not yours.  You already have someone.  What about your wife?!  Ginny?"  Reason did not stop Tufts; he had Draco backed up against the door, the cold wood chilling his shoulder blades even as the smoldering feelings heated his core.
Remus ruminated on that and realised he would have done the same thing for any of his friends. "Well, he seems like he's being a decent bloke."
There were only three known to have been created, because to be honest there were easier ways to deal with pernicious ghosts.  None of the knives were readily available, so Hermione and Professor Slughorn had to create one from scratch.  They even pulled in Bill, Ron's older brother, to help with some of the finer charms and curses.
"Okay, you little shit.  You're going to tell us how to get out of the Land of Crazy, so we can get home to our lives."  Draco stood, and the other two men followed.  Snape hung Harry's cloak from his shoulders, letting it hand open.  Harry focused on the sprite.
After rolling his sleeves up, Draco leaned over his desk to scribble a note about the spell's design, right next to an annual Healer's appointment and a phone number to a Chinese restaurant in the margin of his desk calendar.  The calendar's maple trees swayed in a gentle breeze as Draco wrote.
Moments, like memories, are fleeting. Draco knew this. And as he stared into those vibrant green eyes, alive and sparked with wonder, he wished he could somehow capture this remarkable moment that passed between them.
Mere seconds slipped by and he was down on all fours, the world around him exposed in a relief of sights, smells and sounds, the lack of which made him feel blind and stupid as a human.  He took a prolonged sniff of the air, inhaling the acrid scents from the car's engine and the spell-fire that had suffused the area only moments before.  His hearing honed into the cacophony of life around him, fanning out in a half circle away from the car.  Car horns, a cat yowling, a rat skittering through the sewer grate.  A groan nearby.
The bell rang again and the bright light of the early afternoon shimmered on the glass door as it opened, letting in Hermione and Ron.
He smiled at Lily.  Potterette gasped, but he chose to ignore it.  "Hey Lily," he said to the little girl.  She grew quiet and looked over at him.  "Your daddy is going to miss you so much.  He tells me how much he's going to miss you and that he wants to stay.  But he also wants to hold you in his arms, and he can't do that right now.  He can't hold you and heal you and take care of you as Tufts."  She sniffed at him.  Tufts licked his hand, and then rubbed his entire body along his daughter's hip.
"Yeah."  Harry grins.  "I know."  With nothing else said, he rejoins the fight, leaving Luna to help Pansy to her feet.
To his right, Sirius stepped forward, quickly catching up to the two men. Remus followed, watching the crackling image of Sirius as it reached forward and gripped the staff.
Above the register hung two large portraits. One of them of Harry, Hermione and Ron, designed from a photograph of them straight out of Hogwarts after Voldemort had been destroyed. Remus could see the tired look in each of their eyes even as they smiled in relief for the camera. It was a moment when each of them knew they would survive the world, where they accepted that they were heroes and realized they each had a future.
He looked up at Potter's face and felt sorry for the poor sod.  "It's amazing, really."  He kept his smile modest as he fingered the material, because he knew even the bumbling fool that was Potter would notice if he seemed too impressed.  "Soft indeed.  How do you make it?  Do you just do the charms, or do you knit the sweaters, too?"  What a poof… knitting sweaters.
"Harry, hell… I told you I wouldn't.” Draco held back his urge to hug this man. “Actually, you came out and talked to me, so it wasn't me invading, but more like you sending a welcome committee. Anyway, let's get going. See if this things works."
He hated that Draco was crying.  He gathered him up in his arms and held him and no worry of anything, embarrassment, pride, Snape walking in on them, would have stopped him.
Draco pushed himself up and looked Harry over.  He wore a dark blue, button-down shirt and nice pair of black trousers.  He looked very… professional.  Draco stood and went to the closet, rifling through the clothing hanging there in a system designed by lottery.  With a happy 'ah', he pulled out a dark green shirt with thin, black slashes patterned over it.  "Wear this one."
The snake's long tongue tickled the air as it slid towards the necklace.  Then it hissed, a long series of sibilant sounds, and Harry's jaw dropped.  Draco grew annoyed with the realization that he was missing something.
"Patricia, certainly you must know my aid is worth far more than one dinner. And certainly worth more than what this man could offer." Draco's voice hitched, just a hint of a hitch, but it was there nonetheless. Was Draco nervous? Harry knew he must have heard wrong.
Halfway through the chorus' next breath, Potter snatched up Draco's wrist and tore him from the church's chill and light.  Behind, the chorus surged, an impressive mob of white linens and disturbing yearning.  The candles flared but offered no warmth.  Each note seduced Draco into remembering emotions long put aside: hope, happiness, belonging.
There was a long pause this time, and Remus feared that he might have made the door unhappy. He lifted his left hand and began stroking the door, reminding it of his presence.
The two men thrashed, Greyback's long, yellowed nails scraping new scars across Remus' skin and his teeth sinking into Remus' bony shoulder seizing the nerves in his left arm. Time raced, became something abstract and formless as the impending ritual weighed heavy on his distracted mind. With a knee to the other man's groin, Remus bought himself time to pull his blade from its sheath strapped to his thigh—six inch long tempered steel bought from Cabela's Online.
Harry looked over at him, a confused look on his face as if he were trying to puzzle something out. "He promised," was all he said.
And now it was flavour.  Teddy continued to watch as Harry finished with the nuts and sipped his glass of lemon water, his eyes going wide at the sharply sweet flavour.  "So fresh!" Harry declared and took another long swallow.
Purrs emanated from the cat's chest.  Draco, studying animals and Animagi for years, knew that cats not only purred when happy, but also when frightened or unsure.  He rubbed at the cat's neck and then pulled his hand away.
"Shit," he cried out, angry and desperate. Remus and Draco glanced at him. With robotic stiffness to his movements, Harry gestured towards the cage. Sirius was already on the move.
"Harry. You're being an idiot. Listen, Remus can find us on his own. We can leave signs that he can follow once he calms his crazy, wolfy head and comes to his senses. Let's go." He regrettably dropped Harry's hand, grown warm in his own, and stepped through the doorway.
And then… everything faded away. All care, all concern, all thought just evaporated into the air, leaving behind nothing but a drive to be nearer to the pedestal, taking precedence over all other desires.
"Hermione!  That is not the reason we are paying five galleons a minute to talk to Harry right now.  We are trying to remind him how stupid it is that he chased Draco bloody Malfoy to the States.  What is it with you two anyway?  You hated each other all through school and now you're what… best friends?"
"Harry, can we talk?"  Clicking the door closed behind him, Draco walked into the room, halting before Harry's desk.  Two stacks of papers sat on the surface as well as a jar of ink and tin of quills.  It was all very neat.  Draco could see the back of one silver framed photo propped up but couldn't see who was in it.  He wondered to himself if it was Harry's dead parents or a reminisce of the Golden Trio.  He knew so little about Harry.
He about cried as he gathered his things to leave.  He found his skirt over in a corner and somehow his other clothing had migrated to a nearby table, neatly folded.  Every time he crossed the room he caught sight of Draco, contentedly sleeping.  This was something Harry wanted and knew he could never have.  Draco wanted Lily, not Harry and Harry couldn’t be what Draco wanted without his veil of Lily.
Then an image of Draco's forearm flashed across his mind and Draco noticed Tufts glaring at his faded Dark Mark.  He'd long ago stopped letting the brand bother him, but still he rarely showed it in public.  Obviously, he hadn't considered Potter in the shape of Tufts public enough and had let his guard down.
"Not much, sir. What I know is that every other scholar I tried to talk to blew me off. I know that people have been killed over this. I also know that someone has set up a kind of area spell over some of our communities in London. I'm rather sure this is tied into the curse because most of the people of that area have been affected by it." Harry didn’t want to tell this man that he thought the Ministry building was compromised, but he knew he needed to tell him as much as possible.
Harry dropped to the grass before Draco.  "We will still try.  We will get back to you.  Keep trying.  Keep trying, Draco.  We will be with you again.  We will!
"Teddy?" she called him, and he reluctantly turned from watching Harry and looked over at her.  "Did you know he had been institutionalized?"  He shook his head.  He hadn't known anything.  He'd just known Harry'd left after… well after, and he'd assumed he hadn't wanted to rejoin wizarding society.  Harry had always told Teddy in those years when he was in his care, that he never felt quite right after that whole Voldemort incident, but Teddy'd never understood.  He was a toddler, how could he have?
He twisted at the waist and laughed at the two, staring at him on confusion.  "I'm going for a dip!"
With a dual nod they smiled. Remus understood that he needed to take these shining moments when the universe offered them up, and he refused to turn away from gifts waiting at his feet.
Snape stalked up and plucked it from his fingers.  "None of that."  He stowed the wand away in a box that he placed on the mantle.  "We might have need of it, eventually."
Snape turned towards the table and pulled a dried lily onto a cutting board and sliced down the center of the long stem, the sound carving away into the heavy silence.
"What do you say, Remus?" he asked. Somewhere along the line, Remus ended up running the 'business' side of the business, though Draco did enjoy helping with the finances when he wasn't buried under his club's paperwork.
"Well, yes," Lucius said with a nod.  "It is certainly fair to those who use it and a very practical reason to spur on any kind of retaliation, but I wouldn't quite call it noble."
"Well, like now…" the other wizard trudged on, a fevered blush racing down his face, past the collar of his shirt. "We're having dinner now and it's nice. Right?"
like it would work; it was all cleanly mapped out on parchment.  However, it wouldn't succeed.  There was a gap, a break in the logic that both he and Hermione had caught, yet couldn't bridge.
Tufts stalked beside him, a ghostly shimmer around him that only Draco could see.  When in this mood, wearing the guise of hunter, nothing ever appeared spontaneous in Potter's movements; everything was always so calculated, deliberate.  There was no wasted motion in any action he performed.  But even as he initiated his actions with such refined elegance, Draco couldn't deny there always appeared to be some inexplicable delight taken in his every movement, like he found joy in the simple act of walking or sitting and like so many of the little quirks he'd recently learned about him, it was entirely endearing.
"Hello, Draco," came the airy voice from the back of the shop.  A few moments later Luna Lovegood, resplendent in a canary yellow dress with a feathered hat, emerged from the rows and rows of boxes organized on shelves. The shop looked the same to Draco as it had twenty-five years ago when he'd come to get his very first wand.  The only difference was that dust was no longer layered inches thick over every horizontal surface; in fact, the shop was sparkling clean.  "What can I do for you today?" Lovegood asked with a peculiar smile.
"Did you hear?" a woman asked her friend as they chattered amiably at a table next to his.  Harry tried to tune out the constantly chattering Yanks, always talking, always making noise.
It was the oddest feeling to have one consciousness harbored within a multitude of separate beings.  It wasn't anything he could actually explain to anyone.  To see out of scores of eyes, to smell from all directions, to filter out the static of his rat-like wishes and focus on those desires that came from Draco Malfoy.  It went far beyond simple, physical clarification; it was something that stemmed from the soul.
it, and the secret was in them.  He had organized and reorganized the little booklets of secrets, trying to find the pattern the Mastermind had used.  Certainly within them was the method of the Villain's destruction.  His plan.  But he'd been working all day, even had to bathe CatBoy because of that odd musk he had, and he was just so exhausted.
"Umm, hello," she said with a soft voice.  Almost too soft, and as Draco watched her swallow with what appeared to be nervousness, he noticed it. The Adam's apple, and then he looked at her arms, the breadth of her shoulders.  This wasn't a woman, but a man in drag.  Draco couldn't believe his luck and blessed The Moon and Mars.
A large painting, an original swirled with thin ropes of paint, hung over the fireplace.  A sailing ship of the 1800s fought the wind and sea in an account recorded only in deep strokes and the highlights of the frothy swell of the ocean.  A wave half the height of the ship's mast was held frozen before it crashed over that flimsy construction of wood, and something about it touched Draco—the storm, or maybe the impending slam of the water that pledged either release or destruction.
It opened with a quiet click.  The music grew louder through the open door.  "Deeply sleep… Deeply sleep…"
“You gave him water you spat in?” Laura Madley asks as she sets a platter full of carved chicken onto the dining table between the other dishes of food.  Millicent spears a chunk with her fork and dumps it on her plate next to some discolored peas from a tin and two boiled eggs.
Slowly, he rose to his feet, rubbing at his back where he knew a bruise would be developing in no time.  He spelled the water colder, much colder, and stepped in again.  Goosebumps flared up all over his skin, but his shoulder didn't protest, and slowly he increased the heat to make every part of his body happy.
"No," he said carefully.  "I saw the pasture."  His shoulders rolled in an apologetic shrug.  "Sorry?"  He didn't want Draco to bore of him and walk away.
"Wha—" His attempt to speak became nothing but pitiful squeaking through his dry, raw throat.  Malfoy, facing the corner, turned in slow motion towards him.  His blond hair was the color of sludge and fell across his face in stringy lengths that failed to hide the bruises forming over his left eye and bridge of his nose.
"Of course.  But I'm sure he can handle himself," Lupin said with a small smile.  Ah, sodding Gryffindors.  Always ready to buck up against any sign of hopelessness.  Ever buoyant were Gryffindors.  Such simple creatures.
While Harry was examining Snape, his eyes and the long scar coming up his chest, Draco had been busy with his trousers, which were now resting at his ankles, his long erection packed within the cotton of his pants.  He looked nervous, anticipatory, excited.
"Oh, well…" Draco usually used alcohol to relax himself and his partner.  Going into this sober would be an entirely new experience.  He redirected himself from the bar to the man standing there.  The man dressed in three-inch heals with ruby red lips.  Just looking at those lips stirred something within him.
"Yes, Harry.  To kill Voldemort, Severus and Draco will die, too.  Through the Dark Mark, a portion of Voldemort's essence is within them and the potion will seek that out as well, destroying them as it destroys Voldemort."
Just as the petals had fallen earlier, silence settled between them.  Frustrated, Harry huffed.  Then he sighed.  He shifted in his chair and waited as Draco sat, casually resting one elbow on the arm of the chair.
And the whispers… haunting, terrible in their ceaseless symphony, beyond comprehension but captivating in their insistency.
Hermione reached out to Remus and Harry with her hands. "I'm really, really sorry that he's gone again." Remus nodded. Harry remembered his godfather's bright eyes and cocky attitude.
Draco giggled, his eyes popping open, staring at Harry with such adoration Harry wondered if this was love.  "Harder," he said breathlessly.  "You're tickling."
the lake, let his body sink below the surface and have the water fill in the canals of his ears and forget that the world out there still existed; that other worlds were hiding behind some veil that held promises.  No more desire.  No more demands.  Just him and the water and whoever it is that he was supposed to be before this whole banishment uprooted his recognizable life.
They almost tumbled in their landing, but Draco was graceful on his feet and collected himself with ease.  He raced into his library, startled Severus in his portrait and began rifling through books.  Tufts padded softly in behind him.
Harry stopped talking and peered at Ron's face in the green flames.  "Why are you telling me?  Go tell Draco."
"How did you…?"  He turned to Draco before he finished his sentence, a look of shock and something completely unfamiliar on his face, so Draco felt caught up, his words stolen away like precious jewels.  He watched as, in his shock, CatBoy leaned forward and pressed his lips to Draco's.  It was brief, but sublime, and again, Draco's words were secreted away by some thief, and the thief stood directly before him.
A heavy stillness holds court between them: lack of words, lack of actions.  Draco wonders how he will ever get off this ship, away from these people who have no earthly idea of the price of their peace.  Peace cannot be gained by violence.  All it gains are broken hearts and lost limbs… lost years.
Harry reached out, no longer appeased with watching, and brushed Snape's hair with his fingers, then ran the tips along his skin.  With his other hand he pressed lightly against the back of Draco's head as it rose and fell.  And in this gentle touch, he felt a part of it.
"Yes. And thanks." Harry swallowed. Maybe this was a bad idea. "But I've stumbled on some other information and I want another opinion on what it might mean." There, that didn't sound like he was completely incompetent.
Harry stood and gestured for Draco to follow him. They left the small flat and took the stairs up, a direction Draco hadn't explored before, and eventually came out on the top of the building's tiled roof. The tiles were slippery, but they slowly made their way onto the surface and sat. Harry leaned back, cradling his head with his arms and just stared into space. Draco settled next to him.
"Can't.  Being taken in by two Aurors due to lack of review."  Remus tried to keep his tone steady, but even he recognized the hint of panic to it.  Those interview cells were horrors he never wanted to return to again.  Torture chambers really, with their silver-plated doors and walls and windowless suffocation.  He hadn't had to be interviewed in one of those since Harry's final year in Hogwarts and he knew he just couldn't go back there.  Not now.  It was enough to make even the sanest werewolf chew through his arm in anxiety.
"I want to do the spell now," Harry said, annoyed.  "I want to find this bastard now, before he's all prepared for us."  He wasn't about to stand by any longer.   If he had a way to teach this guy, and the world, a lesson—Harry Potter would not to be
Sirius leaned forward, slowly, inch by inch, and Remus stopped his laugh, the echo fading into silence. An anticipatory weight filled the air, and Remus waited, holding completely still as Sirius closed the distance between the two.
And other things. He now had an arsenal of abilities available to him at the whim of the orb. The orb giveth.
"Shut up!  It's that fucking weed.  I made the potion and Harry's having a bad reaction.  Get over here!"  He ran to his room to grab some trousers, and was buttoning them as Pansy emerged from the Floo.
Draco had only drunk from a very few people and he never felt the way his father looked when his mother was in his arms.
"Look at me," he said in mock surprise, "kneeling before you.  How'd I get here, Draco?  Is there something you'd like to request?"  Potter rose up to his knees and reached for Draco, who took a step to the side, a fierce bubble of horror inflating in his chest.
.  Stained glass saints writhed in pious ecstasy.  A chill settled in his bones.  A somnolent song rose and fell in a hypnotic cadence, filling the air with emotions that irritated him.
The place stank of Dark magic and rotten food.  His skin prickled as he passed through the entrance and he recognized alarm spells going off at his intrusion.  With quick spellwork he halted the alarms and removed other unsavory curses that he'd almost triggered.  Luckily his time with the Dark Lord wasn't all for naught.
Everyone is there; well not everyone, but a lot of the old gang.  A lot of the DA.  Luna thinks back on those days with a smile.  Before joining up with Harry, those were the best days of her life.  It was the first time she'd ever had friends.
As the sun rose, lightening the room in tiny measures, Harry watched him until Severus finally asked, "Do you plan on staring at me all morning?"
A long string of curses and prayers erupted from him as he pushed his cock harderfastermore into Draco's hand one final time, arching his back like a bow strung taut.
"Oh yes, the Boy Savior can finally wave his arm about like a beauty queen.  We are all saved now," Draco drawled.  Remus stared over at Draco and then back at Harry.  Harry stood for a moment and then laughed, a full-bodied, hearty laugh, and Draco smiled in return.
The three men laughed. The hand reluctantly pulled away, sliding down his arm a few inches, leaving it bereft of touch.
"Right," Ron drawled, lost in thought. "Well, I think I'll give Underhill some special project to work on, and then the rest of the team and I can bust this guy."
"Please, follow me. I know everyone is eager to meet you. We've brought all of our Masters in for this ritual, and of course Marissa Apis and Hart Wolfwood are here as well." She stopped in mid-speech and whirled around to face them; her dress floated in the current. "Though, I must warn you, Wolfwood has a bit of a harsh demeanour."
In the centre of the wasteland was a green blob.  It didn’t move—nothing in the area moved—and Draco fell to a squat and surveyed the devastation.  Unsure if it was safe to move in, he waited.  After an hour passed, he stood and began walking towards the green figure, huddled in fright, pulled tight like a tortoise protecting its vulnerable spots.  It took him about twenty minutes to scramble down the hill and over the rough terrain of melted sand.  He would pass the charred remains of gulls and small mammals and he thanked Merlin that nobody else has been out on this beach today.
Harry shook his head frantically when Snape suggested freedom was a desired choice.  "No, I'm happy here.  I don't want to be out there."  He reached for his glass with a shaking hand, concentrating to steady it.  He lifted the glass for a drink; it no longer shook.  "I just wonder… How are Ron and Hermione?  Hagrid?  All of our friends?"
pay."  He turned away from his nemesis, a mix of panic and protective anger battling within him.  His eyes searched out the prone form, and there she was.  His best friend, lying haphazardly in the filthy alley, glassy eyed with no evidence of physical injury.  Her skirt rested slightly askew and her hair was a wild bush, so unlike her new, tidy style.  She looked feral.
Draco looked away. "Okay, I'm just going to say it; I've been thinking over this for a while, but I'm just going to say it." The fingers flexed. "Harry… I'm afraid something inside of you is going to snap someday and you're going to kill someone, someone you don't necessarily want to go to Azkaban for killing." Draco took a deep breath and looked up at Harry, his hands now gripping each other tight.
As Plincher and Weasley continued to search for an exit, they heard a large explosion. The Agents followed in the most direct route they could find through the passageways (see Appendix A for facility map).
Then he stood and began a sixth iteration of the Storcher's Mending Potion.  That last one certainly wasn't viable.
"None of that."  Draco retreated, holding his hands before him, keeping horny-as-a-goat Potter at bay.
"Mrs. Potter.  How can I help you?" he asked, his tone professional with just a touch of indifference.  This cat was Harry Potter, who had everything Draco wanted but didn't have.  This was Potter, fucking
Harry felt increasingly uncomfortable during the mediwitch's outburst. It read like a bad sequel following the Ministry's actions upon the return of Voldemort.
"What?  What is it?" Draco demanded, standing there showing no indication that he was going to dress or move.  His pale, naked body caught Harry's attention, and he dropped his own armful of clothing in favor of an armful of Draco.
How could he not have known?  He knew about Harry's birthmark on the bottom of his foot, that his favorite ice cream was cookies and cream, that he was scared of driving, and that after Christmas every year at the Burrow he came home depressed.  Draco
Remus decided he had to see this with his own eyes, plus he didn't feel like dripping in the Floo anymore. "Harry," he finally called out.
With a deep breath Harry opened his mouth… then closed it.  He realized how petulant he was acting and knew he couldn't tell them the truth.  "I'm lonely," just wouldn't cut it.  "You took Draco away from me," sounded even worse.  "My cock has died; I carry around dead flesh," would only mortify him.
"Well, Potter, I could decipher them all if I had the key.  Apparently you don't seem to have a clue about that, so these are the ones where I actually remember what the key was."
Tucking some of the more promising notes into his robes, he Flooed to Blumgeower Books to meet with Remus.
"Great!" Harry turned and beamed a bright smile his way. Remus couldn't help but return it. "Malfoy will be coming back this evening. I want to show you what we found out so far. After you've finished, of course. And you might want to take a shower." Harry laughed good-naturedly, pinching his nose. Remus couldn't agree more.
"We must leave. We mean nothing to your master. Just tell us where he is and we will get the key from him and leave you and your master alone."
She escorted them through the open room introducing them to everybody and anybody and each witch and wizard was eager to shake their hands; apparently English wizards were a rarity in the Yukon.
The giant clock loomed overhead, marking the passage of time his body no longer felt.  The streets were empty.  He swallowed, his throat dry and thirsty.
It was the third day of their surveillance and Draco groaned at the idea of sitting on the roof again, doing nothing.
) and all of it from lush, pliant lips.  Shock, and pure amazement, shivered from his body into Harry's, and then shivered right back into his.  He felt hot, though the man he kissed was so maddeningly cold.  Sometimes, he couldn't breathe.
Taking his last bite, he smiled while he chewed.  "Yes," Draco said once he'd swallowed, finding himself grinning under Harry's intense attention, "I am fairly fabulous."
Tiny sparkles, like the spray of the ocean surf, reflected in the deep purple of the coming night.  Harry loved it up here, sprawled out, alone and quiet on his building's roof, set on the edge of the city.  On some evenings when the air swelled a little thicker or perhaps the Muggle electricity grew a tad dim, the lights from the city seemed faint, almost muted, and the stars stood out in vibrant contrast against the expanse of the universe.
"I'm back, boys.  Aren't you happy?"  The words sent a shiver down Harry's spine.  Sitting, directly facing the door, he looked over at Draco, who had resumed his beaten position hiding in the corner.
Harry's eyes grew wide, and he swallowed down his tears.  "You mean it?"  He sounded so hopeful and sad that Draco drew him close again and clutched him tight.
Harry's stiff posture relaxed as some tension eased out of his shoulders.  Remus suddenly felt hopeful.  "Do you have to drag him away from his job for it?  Remus isn't going to run, and he loves this job, it would be very unfortunate if he was fired due to a little excitement about an interview.  Perhaps you could do it here, and I could watch the store.  Is that unreasonable?"
"What's happened?" he asked, his voice sounding like it came from outside of him.  "What spell did you cast?"
The far door clicked open and the two prisoners split apart, moving to their respective corners.  Harry didn't know who it was, so he kept his head down, his back to the cage door.  Greyback had just had Draco; a direct return would be an aberration to the man's behavior.
As the overpowering scent from the dragon faded with distance, Draco became certain he caught another scent.  Still of blood, but of the human variety and he rushed forward, over broken stones and rubble piles to find the twisted body of Charlie Weasley.
A few times the men had to get down on hands and knees to shimmy through the short passages, pushing the slowly cracking egg before them and hovering Charlie's prone body behind.  The light of day beckoned them, entreating them to come and celebrate life, so easily lost.  They finally escaped the tunnel and walked a few more paces until they reached the edge of a steep cliff, open to the vast river valley below.  They stood on the precipice, Draco holding onto Harry, and the two men watched as the sky lightened with the day.
Abbott groaned. She hated the night jobs but she never skirted her duty. Ron assumed it was because she was trying to prove herself, being the newest member, and he also knew she wouldn't let Underhill skip out, either.
"Who is Riley working for?" Harry burrowed deeper, heedless of the Swiss cheese effect his fury left behind.
In the center of the room was the spinning wheel.  It was ancient with the lacquer rubbed off after generations of hands had worked wool through it.  There was a cushion on the wooden seat and a basket with red dyed wool by the side.
But he ignored the bone dust and the soft "Harry" that called him from behind and thought only of that aura, that energy of magic that pulsed and pulled at him, like the hungry tentacles of a great, evil fiend.
Draco looked up at Tyrone standing in his office entrance, hoping with all his heart he wasn't bearing anymore news of bodies in his alley or ex-Aurors on his doorstep.  The look on his bouncer's face made him uneasily aware of an avidity to lock himself away from the world for the unforeseen future.
"Damn it, Richard.  I'm not quitting my job just because you don't get a hot meal every night at six!  I can't…"
He'd slept on the couch, and it was not the most comfortable of furniture.  He couldn't define exactly what he was feeling, but he didn't want to be near Severus right now.  He'd thought they were going home.  Once they had mastered their magic, they would cast this spell Severus had discovered and they would go home.
It was a pile of sad lessons that Draco had learned after school.  He would not ever please his father.  He would not ever become an Auror due to past allegiances branded with cursed ink into his arm.  He would never live a life of love, having been forced into a loveless marriage, of which he'd eventually escaped, and he would never, ever learn how to become an Animagus.
," Harry cried out.  The dam had broken—completely crumbled stone by stone under the onslaught of Severus' magic and wicked, wicked teeth, and Harry could do nothing else but
Hell, indeed. The two men stood in a cavernous room, ceiling arching high in sweeping ribs like those of St. Paul's in London. The room ran long and thin, reminding Harry even more of the great cathedral. The skeletal remains of a host of beings coated the floor, so many that the two could not pass without stepping on them. Harry scanned the room and saw only one exit on the far side. At the narrow end stood a stone pedestal with a strong aura bombarding Harry in a very uncomfortable way.
Harry snorted.  He'd never used that as an excuse before, and he wasn't about to convince himself that it meant anything now.  He just wanted to get along, do his job caring for the animals at the shop.
Tufts finally brought them to a closed door, its golden handle glimmering in the fluorescence of an overhead light.  It seemed to taunt him.  He didn't want to turn that handle; he was taken back to that second floor room in Samokov.
"Oh, yeah," Harry said after he swallowed. "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start. I've got so much going through my head… But how about some privacy first." Draco watched as the other wizard laid down his fork and knife, sat back in his chair and closed his eyes.
Harry lay on the rough roof, staring into the cloudless, night sky. It had warmed over the last few days; the air was stagnant, still, just like his thoughts which mulled over only one topic.
A jolt to his heart made Draco worry about a cardiac arrest.  Tufts went limp and fell to the ground.
"Huh?" Harry asked, leaning against the counter.  Had he really been that out of the loop?  Well, there was that whole Dark Lord thing to deal with; it did account for a few missed parties and coming of age milestones.
The vase smashed against the wall, right where Draco's head would have been had he not had the sense to duck.  Little shards of ceramic crunched under his feet as he scuttled out of the line of direct fire.
"Well, I have to take what I can and turn it into something spectacular for you," Harry said to Draco with that innocent tilt to his head.
Draco hadn't done much traveling and certainly had no experience tracking people down, and perhaps this wasn't even part of his duty to cure Potter, but the tiny thrill that blossomed in his chest couldn't, wouldn't, be smothered.
Draco squinted at him, then checked the goblin's magical signature.  Harry was right, this self-righteous creature certainly was the one who'd been lurking behind Harry's shop.  With a nod, Draco said, "I also charge you with stealing the item behind this door, and blackmailing this wizard," he gestured to Harry, "for the return of the item."  Draco relaxed his shoulders, glaring at the goblin thief.  "Really," he said with feigned disappointment, "you stole the man's pet to get him to steal the Sword of Gryffindor?"
"Pansy."  This time it's Harry who speaks.  "If you insist on attacking people on my ship, we will remove your wand."  Pansy faces the two pirates, a casual glance at Harry and then her gaze halts on Luna.
The Hero balanced on the edge of the GE Building, his glowing red eyes scanning the people tiny as ants as they scuttled around on the ground 60 floors below, busy and absorbed in their own New York City lives.
The man Harry had tripped to the ground rolled over on top of him pressing his wand against Harry's temple.  Scrambling, Harry grabbed a rock from the dirt and with all his might he shifted his weight and slammed the fist-sized stone into the side of the man's head.  Shock and adrenalin warred within him as the man fell on top of him like a bolt of cloth.
July, the balmiest, hottest July where even the thought of moving broke a sweat out on your brow.  He'd been young, but the details of that day, details he'd so painstakingly filed away, like any trauma, slowly emerged from the basement of his memories.
"Yeah, usually shows up around 10 p.m.  You got about forty-five minutes of peace if you wanna avoid him."  He wiped off the bar surface before Harry and set the drink down on a coaster for a local ale.  "Enjoy," he said, and he turned away to help another customer demanding a rum and coke.
"So," Draco said to Remus, though he surveyed the group, who seemed quite happy to be chatting amongst themselves on this astounding display of power. "You can still manifest the … wolf? It helped fight the Staff's power?"
Casting a lubrication spell, Draco coated his fingers and Lily's hole, taking his time as he massaged the tight circle of muscles even more than his tongue had.
He sighed at the empty room.  Shite.  He would just have to let Harry take the lead on this.  But the thought of Harry with some bloke named Michael infuriated the fuck out of him.  One thing was sure; he would not let that continue.
Harry cleared his throat, a low noise that seemed to rumble from the base of his chest. Remus glanced over at him and saw a shared look between the two younger men. Then Harry looked over his shoulder at Remus, who nodded his own readiness. They stepped forward.
Well, apparently Luna Lovegood is his First Mate…. If that isn't a red, flashing alarm, Draco doesn't know what is.
Remus shrugged. "Not quite sure. But when you're ready, he can bring them forth, right Sirius?" Sirius nodded, his form shifting with flashes of contrasting black and white.
Popicon arrived later that evening with a satchel full of potions and scrolls and little instruments that could have made friends with those odd whirligigs in Dumbledore's office. He and Apis huddled together discussing an aged parchment. On it were lines upon lines of ancient words that crackled with power. Wolfwood organized a workbench and then poured himself a glass of whiskey. Finally, at close to midnight, after most of the witches and wizards departed for their homes for the evening, a handful of people sat together and discussed the upcoming ritual.
Remus stared hard at Kingsley.  Harry realised even tried and true Remus had his limits.  "Yeah, Kingsley, don't worry."  He mirrored Harry's own hollow words.
Harry had said the gentle touch of heaven could be found at sea; Draco can see only death in the chilling waves, the Kingdom that swallows down promise as an afterthought and then slackens to smooth glass in the next shift of light.  Mercurial.
"I won't, Draco.  I won't ever."  With a steady grip he rubbed Draco, continuously, endlessly and as Draco clutched onto him, his body undulating with each stroke and pull, as he cried out Harry's name over and over as his fluids pumped out of his body, Harry was happy.
Draco's heart grew tight at this surrender.  This isn't what he wanted.  He didn't want Harry defeated, he wanted him willing and totally his.
"Yes, Mr. Lupin, have a nice day.  I am sure we will be seeing each other in the future."  His cruel smirk left Remus with a welt of worry and a sigh of relief as he walked out the door.
"Ron," Harry tried again. "What do you want to do now? Do you want to set a trap for every member of the team? Maybe we should take a little break. You can come down to Costa Rica with me for a day while we think about what to do."
Harry's jaw clenched and his nostrils flared, as if coping with his own unexpected desires.  Draco could read it all there, plain as the note demanding the Founder's artefact.
"It's good to acknowledge these things about oneself.  Come on, Harry.  Hermione and Ron will have an aneurysm if I don't get you to the bar soon.  Who knows what dastardly things the sly Slytherin is doing with the oh, so innocent Gryffindor."
"Well, sir, do you mind if we look around on your own?" Harry asked, donning his "All Around Good Guy" guise, and duped, the man agreed.
Harry couldn’t look away from the image before him. His gaze roamed up and down the slender figure and finally met Draco's face. His pale complexion glowed rosy with embarrassment, but he returned the stare with ease, head tilted slightly to one side. Harry couldn’t stop gawking and soon became aware of a heat burning his veins, quickly heading south.
"So soft.  Like the moss.  Soft and fine."  Harry drew his fingers from the top of Draco's head to the edge of his jaw, feeling his hair, caressing him.
"I need to know about the code."  Harry leaned over the desk, edging closer to Malfoy, scanning for the tiniest hint in the stony man’s features.
"The Horcrux released an impressive amount of magical energy, more so than the others….  I couldn't let the knife go until I was sure it was destroyed."  Pain wracked her voice.  "I suppose I should be happy the rest of me didn't suffer the same fate."
After only a brief moment, he returned those eyes to Harry and smiled.  Then with relief, Draco leaned forward and kissed him.
Lily released a licentious groan, the kind that drove away things like thought and restraint.  "Oh Merlin.  Draco, please.  In me, please, fuck me, make me yours, please."  The incoherent stream of words raced from his lips.
Harry smiled up at him, trying to calm himself as well as Draco.  "Yes, Draco.  I want to do this."  He nodded his head and then let it fall back, exposing his throat.
kind of control aspect to the Mark in there.  But part of me wanted it so bad; it ruled me as it wanted to rule you.  So yeah… I kinda have power over both of you.  Especially you, Draco, because honestly, I've got no attraction to Snape.  No offense, sir," he said to Severus.
"Yeah, I know."  Then Harry sobered up and asked the question Draco dreaded answering.  "What happened?  To Christine?"
He didn't want to dwell on that and without proof it was mindless worry.  He loved both Draco and Severus; maybe if Draco had someone new, he could continue to love his castaways as well, if only for one day.
Though Draco would never admit it, he'd often imagined kissing Harry and what that experience would be.  He hadn't imagined anything this tender, this full of love.  He'd imagined passion and desperation; he'd imagined clumsy fumblings as well as talented, well-earned skills.  But he'd never imagined this moment as Harry's strong arms held him tight, like he was some cherished prize that the other wizard wanted to keep safe.  It was heaven and hell and something Draco had never hoped to experience before.  It was the stuff of dreams and he never imagined he'd dream of lions.
"Uncle Harry?" Teddy asked tentatively.  "Harry?"  His heart beat faster at Harry's lack of response.  He jumped up from his chair and reached out to shake Harry from his stupor, maybe even slap him, but Luna was suddenly by his side, and she halted Teddy's extended arm.
However, even if he couldn't stand being kept in the dark, he knew he couldn't totally alienate his friend and ex-boss.  He still needed to attempt to get whatever information he could from the man.
Meyers had urged Ron to call for the return of Underhill and Abbott. Ron stressed that the 'tip' about this warehouse might be a trick to lure them away from Dzibilchaltun or that an exchange still might be in progress and Ron didn't want to miss any possibility to capture the Dark Artefact peddler. Meyers eventually dropped her argument and prepared for the raid, excitement evaporating the caution she felt at being short staffed.
"Yes, thank you. I don't want to get lost again." This small admittance slipped out of his lips undirected and he hated that it had.
Wolfwood donned a thick glove and reached out to Sirius. Sirius held out his hand, then pinching his fingers together, he turned his hand towards himself and then pushed it into his chest. Draco squashed a sharp gag reflex as Sirius' chest's surface tension gave and his hand sunk in through clothing, skin and flesh. He heard a soft gasp over his shoulder. With a flash of light, Sirius pulled out his hand, his ethereal fingers gripped tight around the staff.
They stood together, watching the rainbow until it faded with the sprinkles.  They were both damp, though Snape's wool kept him mostly dry.  The water weight actually tamed Harry's hair.
Harry'd let Draco bathe first and while his old classmate was in the bathroom, Harry'd remained wrapped up in Snape's robe, suddenly suffocating in the humiliation of all that had happened to him.  He now understood Draco's words as they were being sprung free.
"Why are you looking at Potter, Draco?" Snape asked.  Though his voice had that harsh rasp—from severed vocal cords from Nagini's bite Harry'd assumed—it still held power and Harry knew he would be hard pressed to refuse Snape an answer.
"Yes, sir. I will do as you command." The Auror's eyes shifted away after he assured his allegiance, eyeing the weak glow of the moon behind the thick clouds.
," he moaned, keeping still.  He loved having Severus inside him and was anxious for more.  "Please, another.  Fuck me with your fingers."
Shocked, Draco stood dumb when Harry's lips touched his and caressed them.  It lasted only a moment, but in that moment, slight as it was, some notion of Draco's, some previously practical outlook became bent and senseless, and he wanted those lips back on his.
The car zipped along the A303, onto the M3 and then stuttered to a stop.  Harry and Draco stared at it.  Draco nudged it with his wand, sparking the little car with magic.  It rolled backwards, then zoomed forward again, across other maps without so much as a hiccup, until its wheels touched the road map of inner London.  Then it twirled around the edge of the map, centring on something.  Harry looked over at Draco, a little sceptical about the whole thing.
pot with his energy, causing it to act as a soul collector for the parts of Voldemort he would push out of the two Slytherins.
Hermione had picked them out for him.  It wasn’t that he was clueless about fashion or didn’t know how to look good; he just knew she had a knack for finding just the right colour and cut to really suit him and for any of these formal galas, he always wore something of her choosing.
Harry's eyes narrowed to slits as he examined the snake.  “So you say,” he mused, then apparently he realized the snake still breathed, and his shoulders relaxed and he looked up at Draco, his greens eyes sparkling with relief.  “I'm so glad.”  With a tilt of his head, Harry smiled, and all the breath suddenly left Draco's lungs.
"But, sir!" Draco exclaimed in shock, his gaze reverent on the wand.  Harry, never in a million years, could ever imagine Snape handing over his wand to anybody.
"Why are you talking about me like that, Draco?" Severus asked, sounding almost hurt.  The fact that Severus' painting was poorly executed was known between them both, but never discussed.
He sprinted down halls and up stairways, looking into every room he came to.  He found the young man in the library, looking out the stained-glass window into the quiet morning, his eyes dull.
Potter was swift, flying down the darkened alley, having forsaken the well-lit streets five blocks ago.  Draco refused to lose him.
"Harry, you can't do that to me." Remus wasn't about to let Harry's worries gnaw at his friend's conscience.
And then there was that surreal event at the Ministry Ball.  What did that mean?  He had mulled over the odd feeling of
The entire team finally gathered and after a brief discussion, they slowly continued down the tunnel. The song, now loud enough to eat up all other sound, was the only characteristic of the place. Eventually the tunnel opened up into a large, square room, with doors on every wall and a large, gilded cage in the centre. Within the cage perched a large, dumpy looking bird. It had a huge beak, like a dodo, with the posture of a vulture, sparsely covered in brilliant blue feathers.
Harry stood heavy on his left leg, wand held limply at his side, eyes glued on the fallen form. A moment passed. And then another. And finally Harry drew in a shocked breath, a wave of tension shuddering through his body as he fell to his knees, wand silently dropping to the churned ground under his feet.
"Well, people had seen some bloke with this crystal ball and some said there was a light or something from it that zapped folks. A guy with a crew cut had the ball, not someone anyone knew, not one of the Dark Lord's men. No one would talk to him though, I mean, ya can't trust someone with such Muggle tastes."
Draco knocked a jar of muck over and watched as it slid across the marble counter, the brown dripping to the floor.
"Oh, but yes so darkwizardman.  You've kept your own desires packed away trying to be what others want.  You'd forgotten to think for yourself.  Now, you will."
With a deep breath, Draco pulled out his own parchment and thought about what he wanted to say.  Yes, of course he would meet.  Should he keep it that simple?  What if Weasley's promise to not press about his information was false?  They couldn't charge him for past crimes, however he didn't wish to press it.  He'd worked with the Aurors for so long he hadn't considered them a threat until now.  He'd opened his vaults, withdrew secret information purposefully forgotten and covered in dust, for Potter.
.  There has to be more to this ritual you talked about.  A book, or a scroll or some moldy ancient text has to have some new information.  We
He would have gone alone, abandoned Ron and Hermione like he had Ginny, but they would not be cast off, eager to confront this onerous ordeal by his side.  Ginny was invaluable help though, assisting with classwork and preparations for tests, working with the teachers to have study guides ready for them, learning the skills so she could eventually pass on those lessons.  There was no surprise when she graduated top student in her final year.
"I wouldn't turn away potato soup.  And fresh bread," Snape added, looking past Harry, a thoughtful expression settled on his lips.  Harry shook his head.  He needed to stop staring at those lips.
Young Harry nodded. "I know. I struggled but I couldn't stop it." A scared frown replaced the previous smile.
"That damned bird," Draco yelled over the song, holding his head with his hands, the grip on his wand slack. Then he raised his head with shoulders squared and stalked over to the cage. Wand lifted, he spoke incantation after incantation, casting a siege of spells. Nothing seemed to happen.
tell you about it, last week, and you said you were fine with me going," he shouted across the room.
The team moved into the building following Harry's painstaking disassembly. Harry's senses strained to feel for any magic, to hear any noise. His enhancement cantrips hummed about him, a sense of magic washing over the other wizards and witches nearby.
"No, I mean… No.  I just didn't feel like it.  I was tired from work, and I just wanted to relax."  He flinched at the defeated tone of his words and almost flinched again as he noticed Hermione registering his first flinch.  She didn't need any more fodder for her ever-needling interrogation.
"Sorry," he muttered.  "Want my robe?"  He pulled off his tattered and stained outer robe and handed it to Draco, who took it gratefully.
"Yeah, okay.  Bye," he said to her back as she Flooed to her office.  With his own sigh, he grabbed some Powder and called out his own address: "Assistant Minister's Office."
With Harry's content expression, Draco struggled to steady those hidden desires he'd long kept in check.  Their empty glasses sat forgotten on the table.  Harry took up Draco's hand and led him from the manor to the outside grounds.  The air was crisp, Harry's fingers frigid.
"Yes.  There are many who are still searching for you.  The Ministry and Order are winning, but it is still too dangerous to allow you the freedom I'm sure you yearn for."
Draco reached for the staff, ready to wrap the cursed thing up again, when he felt the edges of that twisted magic touch him.
"I'm not going to tell him that!" Draco said, exasperated.  They were all working against him.  Even Severus had abandoned him on this battlefront.
Duncan harrumphed and sat back in his chair. A few people watched them cautiously from the bar and from a long line of tables to the left where figures sat shadowed in secrets and lies. Remus almost missed this.
The temperature was warmer here and Draco noticed a shift to the air, like a miniscule wind had sneaked through the cracks down the length of this tube within the earth.  Wind, warm wind!  It had to be from the outside.
He'd been enjoying living as a snake.  He found the lifestyle to be beneficial to his temperament and he also took alarming pleasure lying in wait and smothering his prey, his actions surreptitious until it was too late, and then slipping into a digestive lethargy in the warm rays of the sun.
It tasted so… clean.  So unadorned and pure, like the food was broken down to its base element, not overly processed or embellished.  Harry smiled.
Draco brushed his hair out of his face once more and lifted his chin.  “Would you quit talking with that snake, Harry?  And to think, you make the poorly postulated assumption that I'm the mad one.”
"So, Harry.  You want me to talk to this snake that you believe to be Severus, and cajole the poor beast into taking human form, just for your amusement."  Draco took another bite and chewed.
He brushed his teeth and showered in record time and then entered the main room of the cabin.  Severus was sitting at the table staring into a mug that looked full and tepid.  His hair hung limp, framing his face as his gaze swam in the dark tea.  He looked lost; he looked like he was searching for something.  A forlorn crow seeking answers in a sea of questions.
"Can't, I've got to finish the third quarter report on the Department of Mysteries redevelopment."  He turned from the bird and stepped up to his Floo.
"Indeed Minerva, I do have a few theories."  He tugged the poltergeist on the end of its leash as it tried to surreptitiously float away.  "However, they are all undeveloped at this time, and I do not see the benefit of tossing half cooked ideas into a pit of dunderheads."  Then he paused, and inclined his head to his superior.  "Your company excluded, of course."
"Hmm, I'm sure," Draco drawled quietly.  Harry's fur shivered.  He loved it when the other man whispered.  It sent jolts right to his shiver receptors.  "How is your own research going?"
"Open up!" Remus yelled, though the voice sounded far away.  He could tell Remus was yelling by the tone and urgency, not by the volume.  "My God, are you okay?  Anyone?  Let me in!"  The banging and screaming continued, but Severus couldn't move.  He was so tired.
"Well, I'm still connected to you. That could be it. And it's somewhat tiring, so…" he moved his hand in a continuous circling gesture, urging them onward.
Ron looked like he was about to cry. "Can't you think of anything else, something you might have forgotten earlier? We can't leave her like this! Dark Relic from Aztec origins that siphons off magical energy. How popular is that?"
The door creaked open.  A man wailed aloud and footprints echoed off the walls as he ran towards the three prone bodies.
They had wanted him to be the Minister of Magic, but he had refused the position.  Three times.  After Harry had used his power to oust Scrimgeour—angering many people—Kingsley Shacklebolt was offered the position along with Harry.  Harry eagerly stepped aside, soothing some officials' ire who were under the impression that Harry pushed for Scrimgeour's dismissal so that he could attain the position himself.  Nobody seemed to accept that Harry never wanted to be Minster and never would.
"Did you just call me a woman?"  Harry stood next to the Floo, a solid-looking clock in one hand, the other hand resting on his hip, eyes glowing with fevered emotion.
Severus was gazing up at the ceiling and only a thin sheet covered them.  A beast howled into the night, the sound lonely in the darkness.  "Harry… This spell I discovered, it won't send us home."
a house-elf—would make them a lunch and together they would sit and eat sandwiches or baked goods.  Their food stores were growing threateningly low and Snape's curses grew more frequent about the lack of some vital ingredient.  They finished the last of the potatoes only two days ago and the carrots were next.
His morning stiffy brushed against the sheets, sparking intensely along its length.  His need to pee and the scent of coffee urged him up with bull-headed determination.
He hadn't slept much the previous day.  He kept remembering Draco's laugh, his scent that still lingered on his clothes, but mostly, he remembered his touch, those kisses.
A little boy swaddled in red tottered across the street.  Harry swallowed a half-sob.  Last Christmas he and Teddy had built snowwizards.  Back when he could feel the sun, the cold.
And the blood.  Draco tried not to focus on it because he hungered after his previous exertion, but the puddle pooled around Harry's ruined leg let him know that help could not be had soon enough.
"Oh Remus.  I could really care less if you and Snape shagged all last night like nifflers.  In fact, good for you.  At least one of us got some action.  That's not why we're having this little talk.  I heard you talking about a potion and that it could kill Voldemort.  And something about an Exchange Ritual.”  He couldn’t yet kill Voldemort on his own, but if they had something that could work!  “What is that about?  Would you please just drop the secrets and tell me?!"  Harry stood abruptly, slamming his hand down hard onto the surface of the table.  The teacup clattered as the table rattled under the abuse.
He rolled his head over and stared at his ruined shoulder.  He ran a finger over the gnarled tissue.  Even with magic, such wounds would never heal completely.  Not with a catalyst that crackled and burned and was fueled by magic.  He counted himself lucky that the curse light hadn't hit his head… or Draco.  Really, it could have been so much worse.
Ron seemed to puff his chest and grow a few sizes as they walked from the Floo into the menagerie of baby paraphernalia.  His huge grin at Harry threatened to eat his entire face.
"I'll take Rowle next," Draco offered and Harry nodded to his feet.  He didn't want to give up Rowle in exchange for Greyback and then he hated himself for feeling like he wanted any of it.  He didn't.
Severus studied him like a bubbling brew, eyebrows knit together in contemplation.  "Excellent career," Severus began, "expert in your field, beloved father, name cleared of past mistakes…"  He sneered when Draco didn't say anything.  "So, you wish you were Potter?" he said in a scathing tone.
"Come on, Pansy."  Harry's eyes have grown serious as he studies Pansy, and Luna wishes she could smile better.  The curse has moved from her bones to her muscles and she struggles to suck in a breath.  But her Captain has turned serious; he is going to recruit Pansy, save her from her lineage, from the Dark Lord.
Lily wasn't wearing a stitch under his skirt.  Draco chuckled and licked at his skin.  Gripping one cheek in each hand, Draco massaged Lily's arse and then finally trailed a finger along his tailbone and dipped it down between that inviting cleft.  Lily wriggled and moaned.  Sounds, formless and primal, filled the room.
With a smooth wand motion, Draco cast a reflection charm on the edge of the doorframe. He had to see what had taken over Harry and caused Remus to scream like that. In that small, shiny surface he saw a ghost… no, not a ghost. A shade perhaps? He wasn't certain exactly what it was, but it looked exactly like his cousin. Exactly like Sirius Black.
Draco turned away and shyly got dressed, sure he could feel Potter's beady cat eyes on his backside the entire time.  But when he turned around, fully clothed, Tufts was turned away, lying down facing the far corner.
Harry looked back over to Draco. "I could take you to dinner if you want…" Draco still looked annoyed. "Okay, listen,” he leaned in close so the club sounds would cover the conversation, “I've pulled from Hermione's decrypted notes the stuff that looks to be pertinent to her research on Bulstrode's curse. I also got a pile of research from someone else, all medical stuff. I don't know how to read it. And now…" he wasn't sure what he should reveal to Draco, but he figured he might as well go for broke and tell him everything. "Now, I think Kingsley is under some sort of Imperius, but he gave me a hint. Mexico. Normally I would just go to Hermione… but… You're the next smartest person I know." He hated admitting that.
After she left, Draco went out to look for Harry.  He was sitting on a boulder staring up into the sun at full noon.  He walked up and waved his hand before Harry's eyes.
"Crookshanks?" Hermione said in wonder. "Oh, that must have been the purring! What a good kitty. Please, Harry. Please come back. Shut Scrimgeour down and get me the hell out of here," she said in such a firm tone that Harry dreaded her wrath if he should fail. Of course, he wouldn’t.
Harry immediately jumped away from Aiden as he looked over to those piercing, gray eyes.  The usual cool façade burned away by an inner fire that sent an unexpected spark down Harry's spine.
Dog Man chuckled, it was low and intimate and something about it brought warmth to Potter's cheeks as he squatted down to pet Romeo and Peking.  "How you doing, boys?" Potter said, scratching each dog across its shoulders and neck.
"Have you found Harry yet?" Weasley asked.  The idiot tried desperately to hold onto Draco's eyes and eventually looked away.  Draco snorted, amused at his discomfort.  So, Weasley had lost CatBoy, too.
"We only did what we had to do, sir," Harry offered in his most official tone. "What anyone would have done." Draco watched as Harry adorned himself in the mantles of the Boy Who Lived and Auror. His smiling, light-hearted Harry seemed to have jumped ship.
"You're awake!" he said happily.  His words boomed in the cavern, louder than the bang of sparklefire on the New Year.
It was the only thing he could think of, and he blushed just thinking about it, but he knew water was imperative at this point. He’d searched for any kind of container or canteen and had come up empty.  So fidgeting with uncharacteristic shyness, Draco leaned over Harry, ready to press his lips to those of the man who held is heart, and paused to examine his face.
Harry couldn't believe it.  Here he was, watching Draco reach out and run his finger along the bulging vein of Snape's cock, watching Snape watch Draco, his eyes so intent, demanding yet silent.  Draco's tongue darted out and licked at his lips, seeming to wet them in anticipation and then he looked up into Snape's eyes, a kind of reverent prayer before he tilted his head and leaned over his lap.
Draco pounced and began kissing him silly.  Action Number 32 on how to make Draco smile: Giving him what he wants.
"Shall we?" Draco asked, and Harry nodded.  Harry lifted his wand, and performed a complicated series of twists and loops over each map—a charm to reflect a real world magical mixture onto the map.  The spell wasn't difficult, but time consuming because he and Draco had to perform it twenty-six times, one for each map.  The Knockturn Alley map proved tricky, the Charm refusing to stick to the flaking surface of timeworn parchment and faded ink.
He'd visited wizarding communities across Europe, Asia, and North America, learning of their cultures and their magic.  He discovered while every community held pure-blood pride, none of them held such disdain for the Muggle-borns that Voldemort had preached.
"Hello Miss Apis, I'm Harry Potter, this is Draco Malfoy and Remus Lupin," Harry introduced them all. Apis nodded to each one.
"I prefer fucking men," he ground out through his lust, dragging his fingers into the soft flesh, leaving red lines in their wake.  He didn't want breasts and a pussy; he wanted a firm cock and a tight arse and a willing lover.
In a single file row, the three men walked back to their clearing and discovered it full of tiny people with wings.  They ranged from the size of butterflies to fairies almost a foot in height.  Reds, yellows, blacks and golds, each color sparkled and the air filled with the buzz of constantly beating wings.
"Tea?"  The inquiry startled Draco out of whatever maudlin fairy land he'd been touring and he looked at the cup full of tea with cream, just the way he liked it, and that stupid look plastered on Potter's face.  Draco sighed and took the tea, too tired to sneer and appear annoyed.  It didn’t matter anymore.  He would resign himself to living a loveless, virginal life and die a fitting, yet hopefully heroic, death.  Alone.  In a bloody, gory mess.
"And then there's you," Lupin pointed at Draco.  "The poster child for the resistance.  Wow.  This is fabulous!"  Then he turned shy and stuffed his hands into the pockets of his jeans.  "It's good to finally meet you," he murmured.
Draco had looked scandalized, but eventually he did leave.  Harry told him he'd be waiting for him when he returned, but he couldn’t stay in that building.  He needed to think, and the cool air cleared his head.
Lily laughed, rolling his eyes.  "Oh, come now.  I'm sure you can come up with something better than that."
Remus sat at the long table with Sirius sitting next to him. Sirius laughing and talking and eating food and completely, entirely corporeal.
"Harry's biggest imperative after school was to stop the bad guys and have a family.  I was more a means to an end."  She looked wryly down at Potter, who sneezed.  "But that's okay.  He admitted after our sex life hit the rocks that he discovered he was attracted to men, always had been, but that he'd been lying to himself for years.  I do love him, but…" then she looked over at Thomas and gripped his hand.  Thomas looked like he wanted to fade into the carpet, "when Harry realized his true attraction," here she looked pointedly at Draco, "I was free to pursue other avenues as well."
Remus felt like utter shite.  Every bone, every sinew and muscle in his body ached from being ripped apart and rebuilt twice in one night.  His body couldn't take this anymore.  He didn't know how long he was going to last.  Each transformation became harder and harder to shake off, the wolf holding more and more control even after the moon's light faded away.  Did werewolves eventually become frozen in their canine form?  He hadn't uncovered such a horror in any of his research, but most werewolves didn't live that long either.  Not allowing himself to dwell too much on the loss, he couldn’t stop his mind from remembering how easy things had been with the Wolfsbane Potion.  But the only man who could brew it was dead, so it was a wasted effort to even think about such things.
Two plates were slipped into the cage piled with moldy bread and rotting meat.  Harry looked at Malfoy, who sniffed in feigned disdain, but ate his anyway.
Harry looks at him, then waves his arm about.  A passing Muggle ignores them, but Draco can feel the charm settle over his skin like a comfortable shirt, worn and soft.  It
"This place is pretty good, been here twice now." Harry laughed and ran his fingers through his hair, a movement Draco now recognized as one of uncertainty. Draco watched the man and wondered what exactly it was that made the Hero of the Wizarding World nervous. It certainly couldn’t be him. This same man who only months before had thrown him against an alley wall and threatened him with his significant political and magical power. Could it be that Harry, this beautiful pinnacle of confidence, was nervous because he was interested? Fate had never been so kind to Draco before… and Draco didn't really believe in miracles.
"Well, he's waiting, I better go."  She twirled around and continued down the steps, her hair bobbing with each bounce in an overly eager way.
Harry ducked his head to catch it and then gobbled up the nut.  "Hmm.  Good aim.  So, umm. Ron.  How's Ginny?" Harry asked as he focused on aiming another nut.
"I saw him," pipes up Billy, one of Millie's powder boys just signed on a few months back.  "He was at Jenny's."
"What?!" he said, alarmed, pushing himself up with his one good arm.  Three days.  Snape and Draco would be leaving today.  He missed out an all of that Draco time.  Damn it.  He huffed to himself and then gave up sitting in favor of slumping back into the cushy pillows.
Harry pulled himself back from those unwanted memories to focus on the task at hand.  He scanned the miles of books neatly categorized away within Hermione’s flat and moaned at the daunting task.  "How do we know which book?"
spell and discovered it was 5:15 am. With the one hour time zone difference they had less than forty five minutes to get presentable, Apparate to San Jose and find Mr. Popicon's office. "He's not joking, Draco. You have twenty minutes."
Draco stood in the centre of a dimly lit room, the air dank and chilly, smelling of old leather and wet stone. Piled high in bookcases and curio stands, on tables and racks lining the walls, existed perhaps Britain's largest Dark Artefact collection, hidden in the basement of Rain.
He was tired of thinking the way people expected him to.  He'd quit the Auror program once he realised that it wasn't for him.  He didn't want to fight anymore.  He wanted to live.
Remus nodded, smirking. "Okay. We'll set up a place for you tonight, Draco. Want me to take your bag?" Remus asked.
"Stupid… Gah!"  Draco dove under his desk, peeking out as the flowers held a position about a foot over the desktop.
So, behind Lord Voldemort's lines, wrapped tight in his father's iron fist, Draco finally started to view the world with his own set of scales and realised not only were they deficient on common sense, but also sanity.  The purebloods, feeling abandoned by the wizarding world, were blindly following this half-blood, insane megalomaniac to their own destruction.
"Well, that's a right bugger," Harry said.  Then, turning to Draco, he asked, "So, are you going to tell me about the focus?"
"Nothing, just tired."  And he was.  He didn't sleep much last night, with Draco covering him like a blanket.  Covering him, but no kisses, no touching.  Did he do something wrong?  Was he getting kisses from Snape?  He looked over at the man, then sighed heavily and managed a smile for Draco.  "Sorry, I'll keep out of your way today so I don't bother you."  Maybe they wanted more time for kisses.
Draco looked at Tufts, then thought of that room full of the dead.  "Sure, but we're going to scout a bit."
Harry draws a little blue x on the map and looks up at Terry.  "Malfoy's always said this…"  He lets the sentence die, his arched eyebrows begging for an explanation for Terry's off kilter emotional eruption.
"Yes, it was rather unpleasant."  Severus' breath puffed against Harry's unruly hair.  "I had expected something… I knew the possibilities that the Dark Lord would kill me.  He trusted no one.  I had been building a tolerance to Nagini's venom for months."
But the shock didn't last long, and Draco quickly veiled his features, looking up condescendingly at Harry as he tried to step away from the persistent feline.
They stood there, moments ticking by in the silence of Harry's flat.  Slowly, as if against the pull of gravity's tightest hold, Harry lifted his arm and held out the note.
"Can you come with us, Mr. Lupin?" another asked.  This Auror had a pointed nose and a thick head of light brown hair.  But perhaps the most noticeable feature was a cruel twist to his lips.  "Your presence is requested by the Werewolf Registry."
How long had he laid here?  He'd been out for a while; he could tell by the stiffness in his muscles.  The room was black and the only thing he could hear was a far away pounding, rhythmic, but not steady.  What was that?  He concentrated on the sound, and as he did so, he could hear something else: the faint calls of Remus.
"Merlin, Severus.  Are you trying to kill me?" Draco finally said.  Now that his mouth was working, Draco's eyes were screwed shut, like a little boy who thought that if he couldn’t see the monster under the bed, it really wasn't there.  Harry watched, his erection racing to fullness once more, as Snape touched his tongue to Draco's chin, and slowly licked the man up along the side of his face.
Remus recognized this voice, rough and brutish. He couldn't leave Nymphadora out there to this animal's handiwork.
"We need to finish this spell. Whoever is next to lead, do it now!" His words held power and command. "Protect Wolfwood!" he cried when Wolfwood had begun the spell of power. Everyone jumped to action. Remus understood; he launched himself at the nearest intruder.
"No, you haven't." It almost sounded like an accusation as the older man stood, brushing the soot off his worn, damp robes.
They stopped in the middle of the lane and Harry turned towards her.  A bird chirped overhead as it fly by and Harry wondered how he could put what he felt into words.  "Hermione," he began, "every night."  His face erupted into a thousand shades of pink.  "I can't help but think of him."  He stopped to swallow.  "And I'm not talking about sex… though sometimes…"  The blush deepened and they stood together for a while in silence.  Harry felt so much, it churned inside of him to be released.  "I can't help but think of him.  He's in my dreams, Hermione, and my hopes, wishes… desires."  It was odd, but as he continued to speak, his embarrassment at telling Hermione all of this seemed to disappear.  He actually felt relief.
"Yep, but I know you'll want to know this. Can you get to a club in London called Rain as soon as possible?"
The moment Harry Apparated into Hermione’s flat he knew something was off, wrong.  Someone was there.  Sure as Ron had freckles someone had broken into Hermione’s quarters, past her wards, past
He continued his upward trek until he reached the landing and saw a long hallway with four rooms, two on either side.  All of the doors were closed, but something about the first one to his left sent shivers down his spine.  He didn't want to go there; he didn't want to look.
He'd always thought Harry had been a bit on the cute side back in school, but after the Gryffindor had grown out of his gangly stage and told the world and their expectations to piss off, he'd changed.  He wasn't exactly Draco's type, being straight and all, but he now had confidence and a cheeky wit when he tried.  After his rollercoaster ride of love and heartbreak with Ginny Weasley that everyone and their fifth cousin knew about, thanks to
"Song," the fairy interjected.  "She likes songs."  He eyed the three men, his gaze flashing from one to the next.
"Draco, calm down."  Severus had heard this rant before and internally reprimanded himself for goading Draco with Potter's unrequited crush.  "You do not have to come if you don't wish to."
He stood and stretched his spine; a quick report of popping broke the silence of the damp cell. He laughed he felt so good. Even though the Wolfsbane tasted foul, he would drink a gallon of it for this kind of effect.
Snape's dark eyes drilled into Harry, but Harry simply stared back.  Snape rarely made him squirm anymore.
It was a long, drawn out moment before Harry nodded his head, his hair swaying with the movement. Finally, he sat up, a mix of shy delight and anxiety fighting for control of his features. "I know… and I do, too. Care," Harry amended.
Luna introduces Pansy to everyone as if they'd never met.  And that is kind of true, because this Pansy is
They walked through the door of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place together at seven p.m. on April 30th.  From what Severus had told Draco, they had approximately twenty-four hours to live, with a half hour margin of error.  They knew that Voldemort had his major coup planned for eleven p.m. on May 1st and the wizard had to die before his machinations were set in motion.  This had to end for good, right here.
"Okay, Harry. I need you to listen to what I have to say. This is very important." The boy nodded, eyes plastered on Draco, ready to absorb his instruction. "There is something that wants to force you to do something you don't want to."
pot from the overflowing piles of junk in the Room of Requirement where Harry had hid the Half-Blood Prince's Potions text.  It was used to manipulate souls, but with a few modifications it would now capture those soul fragments.  The hardest part lay next.  They had to trick the Mark into accepting Harry's signature instead of Voldemort's.  This was that bridge they were looking for.  A way for Harry to connect with them and send his own magic over.
"Merlin, Harry.  Don't be a modest idiot.  I think you have a knack, but I'm sure more practice wouldn't hurt."  Harry looked back up at Draco and beamed at him.
"Soft, yeah?" Potter said eagerly.  "It took me a long time to mimic the cashmere texture from sheep wool, but after some serious experimentation with Transfiguration and Charm spells, I came up with this.  Nice."  He didn't end it as a question, though Draco felt the man was seeking some sort of acknowledgment, praise even, and wasn't that a kick in the pants—Harry Potter seeking praise from a wartime enemy.
Everybody had a part and every part was important. Ron and Hermione bolted from their spot in the trees and joined in with other Order members and recent graduates from Hogwarts including Ginny, Hannah and Neville. Seamus, Blaise and so many more were already on the battlefield, fighting to create distraction, fighting for their lives.
The waiter arrived with the bill and a queer look at the two men. Harry just smiled brightly at the man who quickly smiled back as he walked away. To Draco, Harry said, "Sometimes they seem shocked to realise I was there the entire time when I conceal myself in a public place." Then he noticed the bill. "Hell Draco… this definitely makes us even." And with another broad smile, this time directed at Draco, he dropped a rather impressive pile of Galleons on the table.
As Bledsoe dragged Harry out of the office, who continued to demand information about the code, Draco called out.  "You have no power here, Potter.  I have broken no laws.  You are no longer an Auror.  You seemed to have quit, or perhaps you have already forgotten.  I suggest you ask nicely if you require something of a personal nature."
Potter shot up from horizontal to a fully upright, sitting position in an instant, his eyes owlishly looking around in alarm.
"Fine, Granger.  We're close to the discovery of the method of our situation," he said, staring hard at Hermione.  Harry glanced from one to the other, Draco's hard gaze to Hermione's overly friendly one.
"Draco!  Bout time you got here."  He was caught off guard by the full embrace of a woman and her very bushy hair.
"Draco, we need to hurry," he groaned out, desperately attempting to occlude his mind, cut off any pathway that the orb might be forging to control him. It tickled his brain and dug in, with claws, with teeth, with barbed hooks. Harry felt each cut, each pierce. "Draco!" As panic snuffed all sense, the air zinged with magical energy. Small items rose into the air, candle chandeliers began to sway in a non-existent breeze.
The entire team was shocked to find the 'few trusted men' to be none other than Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy and Remus Lupin. The members of the team grinned at the news, certain they wouldn't fail in this mission and pitied Underhill and Abbott who were stuck in a boring surveillance job.
"The fight, the contest, the argument.  We've been rivals for so long… and then he started following me around like a damned puppy.  Like a lackey.  What a put off.  I missed the fight. I didn't want a fan club… well, not in a lover.  I wanted someone… " Draco's words faded into the quiet night.
Draco pointedly ogled Harry's crotch again.  "Well, still.  No sense letting that go to waste."  He took a step closer.  Harry stood rooted to the spot.  Soon, they were chest to chest, and Draco gently pulled away Harry's shielding hands.
He looked over at Harry, who seemed somehow shy and small, nothing like the god he had appeared to be during the ritual.
Remus knew those voices. Recognized them well. So well, he could not find the presence of mind to truly put the two together into what he would consider friendly banter.
"So, Darren.  Anymore sheep missing?"  As subject changes went, that one could have had more elegance.
Harry glanced at Draco and then returned his gaze to the church, frowning at the odd magical tempest. They continued to stand there as a grey cat crossed the street and slid underneath a white-washed rail fence.
"Alright Lupin? Ya been missing for a while." Duncan pronounced things with a long drawl. His frame looked exceptionally thin and his face painfully gaunt. Everything about the man was stretched.
"Rooftop?" Draco suggested and Tufts nodded once and got to his feet, padding down the street.  Draco followed after.
He'd thought it the most erotic thing in the world, until he saw a man do it on the Muggle television and then Draco knew,
Then, as Harry told them about his conversation with High Priestess Apis, the affection was constantly reinforced by casual brushes and accidental touches. One man would lay a hand on the counter and the other would reach for the sugar, gently running his wrist along the knuckles of the other. Or one of them would reach for a parchment and lean his shoulder against the other's. All casual, all easily written away as touches by close friends, thoughtless actions with no hidden meaning.
He pulled Lily even closer to him, pressing his groin to Lily's hip and felt an answering erection firm against his own thigh.  Tearing his lips away, Draco leaned forward to taste Lily's smooth cheek, dropping kisses down his jaw, along his throat.
It was a bang, or a slam, maybe it was a crack—of the exact species of sound, he wasn't quite certain—but it'd echoed off to his left, and so he'd ran and ran and called out, but distinct landmarks were as extinct as other people and all that surrounded him were endless dunes so desperate to fulfill their own hunger, they swallowed whole his footprints.
A flinch wracks his body, and he drops to the deck—the sound echoes in Luna's ears.  Pansy laughs; it's shrill and theatrical.  Luna closes her eyes and waits, unable to move, unable to speak; she can only hum softly through parted lips.
"Fuck.  Fuck… Shite," Harry cried and then squeezed his eyes tight.  He clutched at Draco's hand, gripping it so hard the minute bones groaned and scraped against each other.
as he did so.  His heavy lidded eyes tracked Harry as he moved around the kitchen, causing a shiver of delight to race across his skin.  Finally, he looked into that dark gaze and his cock filled at what he saw.
With a roll of the eyes Remus took a step into the room and was rewarded by an instant haze of pain and confusion.
Terry squints at Draco.  He feels like a specimen floating about in a jar of alaxial fluid, ready for the cauldron.  He's sure that Terry will be the first to arrive with fork and knife in hand on feasting day.
Finally, after Stephen finished his second drink—Lily was still sipping on that first whisky sour—another man approached him, and with an odd look at Lily, leaned close and whispered something in Stephen's ear.
Lupin smiled.  "Just wondering what planet you were currently on.  Severus and I will be retiring to the laboratory to review his theory and plan out the first step to the potion.  So, please entertain Draco if you wouldn't mind."
"Oh, I have a meeting until seven."  She gave him one of those 'I'm sorry, but I really want my way' grins and his shoulders sagged.  Then something bumped his leg and he looked down at the lynx, leaning against Draco as he looked up at his wife.
With a haughty toss of his fringe, Draco turned and faced Harry.  "Not so much.  So, now what was it that was so urgent you had to meet with me today, Harry?"
"Do shut up, all of you."  Everyone grew silent and looked at Snape.  Peeves blinked at them all.  "You have shown up at an inopportune time, Draco.  Please return to the common room and leave me be."  He turned his back on them and began organizing a cauldron and some glass vials.  The glass rattled against each other as the blind man poured one into the other, brushed his hand across the hard surface of the table, moved a bunch of dried lilies from one side of the cauldron to the other.
A glance to his left showed no Harry sleeping next to him, and the warmth that had seeped through his limbs became a little less intense.  But there still remained the pillow dent and the scent of Harry wrapped all around him.  He liked this.  He could get used to this.
Harry could feel Severus' tongue slide along his penis, which rested soft and unmoving against his course curls.  The ache soon turned to discomfort; he felt like his body had expanded to fill his borders but with no more slack left.
and I go way back.  We went to boarding school together in Scotland, and you know how close boys can get in boarding school."  He leered at the man and cheered inside when he finally looked away.  He wouldn't lose to this
"Ginny," he restarted as he watched Harry and his daughter, "I think I might have a lead, but there isn't much I can do for him, right now."
," Severus groaned, and Harry's ego swelled with excitement.  Then with youthful eagerness, before Severus called him a tease, he opened his mouth wide and swallowed him down in one gulp.
"Harry!" Draco called, pulling his attention to the threat, and Harry lifted his wand and without any thought cast out: "
"So did we."  Harry’s bright eyes darted up to Kingsley’s dark ones.  "Was there anything specific you wanted to know?"
Grunting and whimpering and, as his fog cleared, words of "Open up for me" and "Fucking tight, so tight" and "Take it all, little slut" and Harry longed to retreat again.  This couldn't be happening.
It had started off like a fairytale: Harry had swooped down like a dark angel on his Firebolt, saving Draco from the flames in the Room of Requirement, just like a knight on his trusty steed.  Even though they weren't friends, true enemies honestly, Harry'd saved him from an unwelcome, scorching death.  After that, something tweaked within Draco that never seemed to right itself again.  It moved from an unwanted gut twitch anytime Harry was near, to moments of blushes and mind blanks, to Draco finally acknowledging that there had always been something alive and strong and fiery between them.  Whether it was hate or love… there could never be placid disinterest.
"Yeah, I know. Maybe she and Ron will end up getting a place together and I can sublet." He hadn't really thought about what he was going to do when Hermione got better. That was the goal and the goal was attained and there wasn't anything else on the horizon. He didn't have a job; he hated his own place…
"Well, Ron and I thought of some of the things you might need and well," she smiled sheepishly, "I'm afraid we went a little overboard."
“I can talk to him, and—” Harry pointed at the locket and brilliant stone, bright as a miniature star, resting among the acorns and pine cones, "—I think that makes it fairly obvious.”
"Gibbibuck, step away," the goblin with the torn ear said before Draco could open his mouth, tugging a key ring off his leather belt.
But this time his friend wasn’t holding his usual glass of firewhiskey.  He had a mug of hot butterbeer instead.
On the fifth day after the massive eruption of what some assumed had been merged Muggle nuclear power and wizarding magic, the morning was full of fog and crows.  At least they looked like crows.  If he squinted, Harry could distinguish a bit of a mousy look to the third one from the left.  Their mournful cries echoed like hollow trumpets, an eerie infiltration into the thick mist that Harry knew would burn off by ten that morning.  Just like every day since the maelstrom.  Then the sun would burn bright, cooking everything pinned under its unrelenting rays.  And as it slipped beyond the horizon the deadly cold set in.  It was then that Harry was grateful for his layer of fur.
Harry watched him, letting Snape file through his gamut of magic.  "While you do make a pretty picture all trussed up, I bet you have a nasty neck kink," Harry said to Draco.
Facing the wall of knowledge, he lifted his wand and performed a few swift slashes before himself.  "Books containing spells on communication between a human wizard and another wizard in Animagus form."  Three books came floating off the shelves towards him.
He stood and stared up at the sky.  There were no stars; the moon was too bright, hanging there like a fat balloon.  In the distance Draco could hear the far away echo of a song and laughter, and realized the Fae must be reveling.  At least someone was happy.
Remus grabbed Duncan's arm and kept hold as the man tried to pull away. "You've all been cursed, Duncan. I think Bulstrode was one of the first."
Twenty minutes of Harry sticking to his side, doing exactly what Draco said and not talking to anyone put Draco into an inappropriately reckless mood.
Ron grinned, showing a nice row of white teeth. "That would be great, Harry. I would appreciate you getting off your lazy arse and helping. All unofficial of course…" he winked.
"Potter?" Plincher asked, stepping in front of him. "What happened here?" The Auror glanced around at the piles of debris and then the body of Kogelmann. He returned his gaze to Harry, obviously expecting some detailed report on how the room had met its end.
"Two burgers and chips," she repeated, watching Harry out of the corner of her eye as she scribbled on her little notepad.  "Should I wait for the rest of your party?" she asked, tapping the pen against the paper.
From his vantage point in the entrance to his private room—now he finally realizes what a treat that is—he can see the Captain's quarters, the large table piled with maps, and little sea-faring doohickeys of which he has no idea of their function.  He can hear the low mutters of Harry, Luna and Terry as they plan their next trip, either to rescue some hapless wizarding folk standing up against the Ministry or perhaps to attack an incoming merchant vessel.  If he bends his head just right, one eye peeking around the edge of his doorjamb, he can see into the room.
"What!" Harry sputtered. "What do you mean by that?" He looked over at Remus with clear eyes, not letting their conversation hamper his surveillance, but certainly invested in the line the conversation was heading.
"Someone gathered 'em. Someone who made promises." Duncan cleared his throat. "Promises that were sweet but turned sour when broke."
"He's been collecting things," Draco said and at those words Harry dropped his book and leaped from the couch.
"Mr. Potter.  Thank you for the toast," Rufus Scrimgeour said pleasantly, but Harry stiffened anyway.  The Minister always put him on edge, ever since he cornered him at the Weasley’s during Christmas of his sixth year at Hogwarts.
He unleashed his fury, invigorated by an unstable psyche, and the death tolls skyrocketed in response to the Trio's actions.  More than ever they acknowledged the need to move quickly or more of their friends might end up dead, not to mention countless innocents.
out of time.  What would you do with your last few hours?  How would you spend these moments which are only yours?  How will we spend this time?"
Draco couldn't help but be a bit amused as CatBoy bounded over the sand to tackle him, though his amusement was cut short when the action caused sand to infiltrate all the wrong places.  The place lacked imagination and the constant chimes and bangs of all timbre of bells were fast driving him to distraction.
"I thought you would've figured that out on your own," he chuckled stiffly, a dry sound that held little amusement.
"I'm here," he said, brushing his fingertips along Harry's clammy skin.  Pansy was mumbling to herself, but Draco tuned her out in favour of giving Harry his entire attention.
They'd played with lube and fingers before, and Harry'd grown to know the exact tilt of his hips to help Severus hit his prostate every time.  As one finger circled his tight hole he squirmed and received a sharp slap to his rump.  "No wiggling.  You know the rules."  Harry did know the rules and his cock leaked at the forcefulness of Severus' voice.  He almost wriggled again, but then the finger slid in, slow and slick and inch by inch Harry was impaled by it.  "
Resting his chin on his hand, he stared out the window and watched the sun appear through a thin layer of clouds and the birds fly past in transient flocks.
book that listed them.  Only he and I could read it.  It involves the solution, or potential solution, to the equation in the corner.  Initially I worked a few out on my own, but then after Severus figured out I cracked the code and hadn't taken it to Voldemort, he brought me in.  So I would assume Hermione's key is somewhere around here, hidden in plain view.  The key connects the equation to the actual spell that translates the code."
He shrugs.  "You just deal.  I figure, someday I'll kill his sorry arse and be done with it."  He grins wide.  "It will all be history."
Severus rolled over and looked at him.  Side by side they were in bed, as they had been forever—since Draco had been taken from them.  They hadn't done anything but share a few kisses, maybe hug each other on their bad days.  Severus hadn't asked; Harry hadn't offered.
"I just hope the Dark Mark doesn't change into something revolting, like Gryffindor red," Snape said.  "Now shoo, Draco.  Go bathe."  Draco turned and skipped out of the kitchen, obviously excited at the prospect of meeting his mid twenties.
Draco squatted next to Harry, griping his hand as the man panted against the pain, eyes rolling back to show only white.
When Snape returned it was to two boys yelling "Surprise!" quick hugs from each of them and a lopsided lemon concoction.  He scowled delightedly, and ate the cake.
"Well, maybe he just wants to help out." At Remus' sceptical look, Harry scrambled for another excuse. "You said he wanted friends. And there is that vow he made me swear."
Then out of nowhere, like a man-sized Monkey, swings Harry, her Captain, from a stretch of rope that lengthens and lengthens until he's spot on behind Pansy, feet held out in some dashing display of acrobatics.  Pansy whirls on him, slapping a curse across his chest that etches across his pectoral muscle.
Despite all the potions and charms of Draco's vast armoury of potential cures, Harry's curse slipped through his scrutiny, elusive in its complexity, and Draco began to put more and more stock into Longbottom's weed.  Four days earlier he and Harry had prepared the pot, cracked a runespoor egg into the dirt and mixed it in along with mandrake root shavings and plopped the seed into the soil.
"Luna is indefatigable in the fight, Draco.  If you trust me, then trust Luna.  She is a bit batty, but you don't become the apprentice to the premier wand maker in Britain if you can't work out a problem or two."
"Well, Mr. Boot," Draco says, deceptively polite.  "That's excellent: you and I seem to see eye to eye.  That being cleared up, why not take off these bindings and drop me off at the nearest port."  Draco smiles up at Terry, blinking coyly.  Terry pulls away.  Draco's gut hardens.  He considers exercising his charms on either of the witches, but doesn't have the stomach to even pretend to be interested in a woman.  And he doubts Luna Lovegood would even notice.
The word brought with it a flash of Tufts racing across the street and being stuck by such shocking sensation, that Draco dropped to his knees, overwhelmed and unprepared by the impression.  His world turned arse over kettle as Tufts tumbled across the street and then blackness snuck in like insidious fog, removing sight and sound and consciousness.
Hot damn, it'd been a long day. Bernard Underhill knew just how important his whole mission was, but it didn't mean he wasn't frustrated at still being down in Mexico. Home called to him just as it did to every other member of his team. He stifled a yawn as he stumbled his way to his rented room down a small, quiet street. It was more of an alley really and it reminded him of some of the more cramped areas of Knockturn Alley, though lacking the bustle of people skulking in the shadows that the infamous wizarding sector had. This place always stood deserted.
Remus looked up at the painting, really studied it and saw within the artwork a grid and a series of ancient runes imbedded in the images.
He'd never been this close to a penis before, an erection, a cock, a prick, and as his mind ran through all the names for it, he almost giggled.
Now, he laid freezing under twin tombstones, one labeled "Naughty" in cursive script, the other "Nice" in block lettering.  Both grave inhabitants had died the same day.  He sappily hoped they'd died together.
The clatter of cups on saucers came from the kitchen and Draco stepped away.  In two strides he circled the edge of the couch to sit, only just planting his butt as Potter walked in with a little tray and two cups.  It was so domestic; Draco barely had the frame of mind to slip on a suitably professional smile.
"Oh, well the older boys know everything.  Lily, she thinks of Dean as a kind of uncle that's around all the time.  When she gets older, we'll tell her.  Harry and I are just better friends, even if it weren't for the gay thing," she finished with a laugh and tossed her hair over her shoulder in a distracted kind of way.  She was watching her daughter, her look full of fierce pride and love.
But he didn't know Draco worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department, he didn't know Draco and his parents had been rejected by the wizarding world, he didn't bloody well know much because Harry Potter had disappeared a year after he'd defeated Voldemort.
Harry gulped his tea and shrugged.  "But you've given me hope, and I thank you for that.  Now, shall we study this spell you found?"
"You want to know the truth, Harry?"  Draco's voice was low, guttural and Harry blushed that the sound went straight to his cock.  What was he thinking?  Getting hard right now with Draco looming and radiating threat?  "The truth?  The truth is pumping through your veins.  I can practically taste it in the air from the wound's you've received.  The fact is that I want to sink my teeth into your throat and guzzle you down, taste your power, your blood, you.  That's the fucking truth.  I'm barely holding back, I've overtaxed myself saving your sorry arse, so please… kindly… Quit Provoking the Hungry Vampire!"  Draco thrust Harry away from him and stumbled away, crumpling to the floor.
Harry struggled to open his eyes and found them gummy and burning with fatigue.  "Remus?" he replied.  "What happened?"  He remembered the Quaffle monster, but certainly something he'd Transfigured couldn't have screwed him up this badly.
Draco took a deep breath.  Was he ready to give up?  He looked back over at Tufts, at Harry Potter, and knew this man would protect him, and he also knew he had to cure him soon.
"Well, I guess that will do," Draco said, in an almost friendly tone, at least a tone that didn't suggest Harry was something Draco found on the bottom of his shoe.  Harry’s jaw dropped open, a furrow of concern burrowing between his eyes.
"Uhh… Well… Oh, never mind." Harry picked at the straw in his glass of Coke, fraying the end. They had been sitting in the park for about an hour now, waiting for the exchange Ron had been tipped on. None of Ron's Auror team knew of their presence on this strictly intelligence gathering mission.
Draco can't understand him, and as he shakes his head in disbelief Harry's smile softens, the light in his gaze grows warm as it brushes across Draco's face.
"Yeah, you just set me for a loop there, Potter.  A little warning next time, if you wouldn’t mind."  He got to his feet to toss himself into his chair with a heavy sigh.  "What happened after?"
Harry only grunted in reply, too tired to toss back any kind of response, let alone something properly scathing.  He grabbed for the napkin and wiped at his mouth, mainly to humor Draco.  Normally he wouldn't be arsed with table manners while devouring take-out in the back room of Lakemore, but the bloke had brought him dinner, or was this breakfast?
"You don't think it can?" he asked in alarm.  He'd put the last five years of his life into establishing an honest and stable form of government for the wizarding world.  He had lost his childhood to abuse, his adolescence to Voldemort, and then the prime of his life to the ungrateful masses surrounding him.  Sacrifice played a major supporting role in his life; he didn't want that sacrifice to be for naught.
There were piles of books and baby toys, blankets and those little one piece suits that always seemed so silly to Draco.  He felt his eyes might go blind at the overwhelming Muggleness in the room.  At any rate, the sight of the baby things seemed to calm Harry down as they descended upon Hermione and Ron's home, so Draco swallowed down is invective and plastered on a fake smile.
Snape drew out his wand.  Harry watched avidly as he placed the tip of his wand on the top of Draco's head and dragged it down along his spine all the way to his protruding tail bone.  Then he tapped.
"Wait one moment," Draco said, holding up a single finger.  He left the conference room, his stride long and jaunty, and returned with something held tight in his hand.  He held his fist palm up and slowly uncurled each finger.  Sitting there, dandy as could be, was a little metal racecar.
Severus was such a restrained man that Harry'd only seen him out of control but a few times.  Once was during his flight from Hogwarts, yelling at Harry, telling him he wasn't a coward, that he was, in fact, the Half-Blood Prince.  Another was when Draco caressed him all over, tasted him, drank him down.  Harry vowed he would make Severus lose control like that again.
Something inside of Remus snapped. Suddenly, he stood, pushing away at the thing, gaining his feet to face this demon with the face of an angel. "NO!" he screamed.
"But Draco can't understand you," Harry said, a bit lamely.  He tried to think of another more convincing reason, but then Snape interrupted his thoughts.
"Is that what trapped you as a snake?" Harry asked, striving to keep his wandering gaze off Draco by watching the shifting of light on the snake's scales, yet trying to not shiver every time that stupid snake hissed.  He felt ready to burst apart.
, Harry thought.  That magic.  That connection.  He'd felt it last night when they were together, when Draco was in his arms and they'd
Harry paused, then thought, "screw it," and wrapped his arms around Draco; a small, female gasp came from behind.  "But you saved me, remember?  You
"What?  Really?!  Oh my God!  Of course, we would!"  Hermione squealed as she jumped to her feet; then she ran up to Harry and enveloped him in a girly hug.  Harry jumped about with her, a tad awkwardly, as they chanted, "Baby, baby, baby," together.  The slap of Ron's huge hand on Draco's shoulder practically knocked him over, drawing his attention away from the dancing duo.
Harry had to sit between Hermione and her annoying left hand, and McGonagall, who seemed to be the only two…three people he didn't cause to sneeze.  As he sat, adjusting his tail to slip through the ribs of the chair, Harry sneezed, apparently trying to make up for the lack from Hermione and McGonagall, Hogwarts' plaid wonder. Ginny waved a hanky at him from across the room.  Harry dismissed it with a shake of his head and forced smile.
Remus turned, his back to the shrine to watch the woman disappear around a curve in the park's path. He wasn't completely paying attention though, his mind on something Harry had said. He and Sirius? But Sirius was his friend, plus he didn't like men that way. But it did cause him to wonder at some of the things Sirius had done while he still lived, some of the things he said, those looks. Did Sirius…? No, now was not the time for that.
"Listen guys, I need to go."  Harry turned, pretending to talk to someone over his shoulder.  "Someone else needs the Floo."
The old geezer wheezes out a strangled noise that might have been laughter.  "'taint no needing to be so formal, boy."
"A little.  I can't get it.  It's never worked for me."  He couldn't do it.  He tried.  This place was dead to him… a hollowed husk.
"Yeah, thanks!" Draco said and turned away, letting his face fall into a comfortable, haughty sneer.
"I am sure you could, with time. Time you're not skiving off for. Come over here and decipher these." There was a rustle of paper.
woman, and while he'd never been with a man before, in any capacity, he wasn't completely clueless.  He knew that eventually they would be naked—well, all of them naked, versus just Snape—and he found it entertaining to let them think he was utterly innocent in the ways of gay sex.  He couldn’t wait for Draco to try to explain exactly what the lube was for.
Luna nods, unable to encompass the joy that threatens to set her afloat.  "You know, Harry.  Doing this magic, in the middle of battle.  We'll, you're a bit of a drama queen."
Potter looked as pale as those specters haunting that church.  A severity overtook the man, his gaze waylaid by some unseen menace at the entrance.  Draco eyed the closed door, then Potter again.  Draco cataloged everything he knew about Potter's recent activities, his removal from society, his forays into Dark London, the sickly cast to his skin.
"Yes, Harry.  But we do not have to leave now."  Harry nodded at Snape's reassurance, but then both men were startled by the cracking sound of Apparition echoing from inside the forest.
emotions.  They felt alien, something he knew wasn't his, wasn't coming from him, but he recognized most of them and understood Potter better because of them.  The man… the cat was worried.  He no longer thought in complete sentences after only a few weeks of constant transformation.
"Me, too."  A pregnant pause filled the air, and Harry jumped as a hand landed on his shoulder.  "Harry?" Draco's questioning tone probed him to look up, and he gave into it.
… my talented Harry," Severus mumbled as Harry slid his mouth up and down his shaft.  He was inelegant in his enthusiasm, but Severus apparently judged him adequate by urging and cursing and promising the world.
Potter's eyes opened, slowly at first, but then they bulged in understanding that he was human and promptly his body morphed into that of Tufts.  Draco watched as his form shrunk to more than a half his normal size, fur sprouted over his entire body and his features distorted and flexed into those of the lynx.
Nights when he tucked Harry in after a generally trying day at the clinic, Draco would sit in his room and watch Harry as the dim glow of the moon lit his face and the shadows played games of age and youth during its passage across the evening sky.
Harry drew his finger down the edge of the leaf and nodded.  “The one you want to know.  The one I want to tell you, but…”  He drew out the word, paused in his petting.  Draco waited, ready.  This could be the breakthrough.
She smiled sweetly at him and said in a calm voice that seemed to be delivered directly into the bones of his inner ear, "I am sorry, I don’t keep track of Mr. Malfoy.  You will have to speak with Mr. Bledsoe."  She nodded to a man Harry recognized, coming down the translucent stairs.
They stood together, shoulder to shoulder leaning against the concrete wall of the bus station. Draco could feel Harry breathing next to him and was keenly aware whenever the other man shifted. He felt a tingling, almost a spark of magic between them, and he found it quite a chore to keep his mind on task. All he wanted was to lean into that touch, have it envelop him. For twenty minutes he experienced this exquisite affliction before someone approached locker 27 drawing both men away from the wall, away from each other's touch.
The two Aurors were switching off, one asking one question, the other asking the next.  Three other Aurors, noticeably younger than the speaking two, watched in awe, eyeing Remus with sick fascination.
Draco watched as Harry bolted into the room and saw something that seemed to suck out every gram of energy from the man. At once, Draco skidded to a halt just outside. There was no way he would charge in there like the cavalry. Draco was not the cavalry type; he was the crafty backup type.
He'd been perched away from the others on his favorite rock facing the lake.  Some mallards were puddling, tail ends turned up as they stirred up a feast.  Behind him, he heard Draco chuckle.  He turned and looked over at his two companions.  They were leaning close, faces turned towards each other discussing something.  Once in a while Draco would throw his head back and laugh and even Snape's perpetual scowl lightened; he looked like a man at peace.
His shoulders shook and his lungs spasmed as he wailed into the silent night, salty tears mingling with the cleansing rain as he faded into the exhausted darkness.
"I think," Severus continued, examining the empty space above him, "that you might find something about him in my notes."
All the breath Harry had gathered within his chest, hoarding it for the anticipated whoop of support, whooshed out in a display of hunched shoulders and a drop of his chin.
"Stand back, I'll come through."  And just like that he twirled through to Harry's flat, taking on the semblance of night in his deep blue dressing gown, hair not quite perfect, but that was fine because spread out at his feet was another opportunity to help someone.  And more than just someone, but Harry.
And then Harry flicks his wand, jutting it out like a fiery brand.  The Dark Lord swipes his through the air.  The blue and green meet in the air, intermingling into colors as vibrant as those of nebulas and newborn stars.  Then they separate once more and Draco reaches out, ready to push Harry because he's just not moving quickly enough.  Just not quickly…
When he finally came to, even with the pounding of a 10 tonne sledgehammer attacking his temples and warm liquid trickling down his face into his eyes, he felt lighter.  He almost laughed he felt so free.
"Good morning, you miscreants.  Sleep well?"  Snape wore his usual sneer.  Instinctively Harry still bristled, but it was only in reflex.  This was just Snape, he was always snarky.
Remus sighed.  While the Aurors hadn't bothered him much in recent years, some would come in to poke sticks at the tame werewolf from time to time.  Harry and Tonks often spoke for him and his lack of trouble making seemed to waive these little social visits, but Tonks had been gone for years and now Harry could offer no more help, either.
He looked out through the stained-glass window into the bright light of the afternoon.  The colored glass pieces depicted a scene of a rising sun over red fields of poppies.  It was a fragile image of hope and dawning promise.
"Harry, you weren't thinking clearly.  Here, look at this.  I found reference to a form of exchange ritual, and I've reworked some of it to fit what we want to do with the Dark Marks.  Look it over, I'm taking a nap."  Hermione handed Harry a long scroll, all unwound and creased in regular intervals, scattered with meters of notes and formulae in Hermione's frantic yet neat writing.  She wobbled over to her cot and seemed asleep before she'd fully landed on it with a 'thud'.
Potter tore his eyes away—how long had he been staring?—and for a brief instant his hand hovered for his hair, but instead he propped his elbow on the table and rested his chin on his fist, and lost himself fumbling for some plausible excuse.  Draco waited and hoped it was good, because if Draco had had to face down his accusers, shouldn't Potter have to face down the love and adoration of the mindless masses?
, Draco thought as Potter choked on his laughter and hid his face in the crook of his arm where he'd slammed it against the table.
"The Confundus Charm, Bone Cruncher Curse, extensive Cruciatus and Legilimency.  Also he'd been under Confutimago and Scindomago variants, to name a few.  Those are the major curses that his body and magic show signs of being subjected to.  But it isn't just that Harry," Pansy cocked an eyebrow and Draco continued on, "is under the after-effects of all of these curses combined, there are also other curses, more recent, that I've never seen before.  I have a lot more research to do.  A lot more."
"Oh, and Draco," he said, almost as an after thought.  "I would like to talk to you tomorrow, if you have the time.  Early.  Will that do?"
"Clothing.  Off," Potter demanded and Draco stood to drop his clothes so fast he thought he'd torn the sleeve of his shirt.  Potter lay naked on the bed, long and lanky, broad across the chest, and covered in a history of scars that probably matched his own.  He was gorgeous, and he now understood every single thing those girls in the common room had said.  Dark and angsty and full of promise.
"I'm scared that I won't know what to do.  I'm scared that what if I die, or you die, and the grub is left alone.  An orphan.  I'm scared that I'll be a totally useless dad, or mom, or what-ever-the-hell I'm supposed to be.  I'm just too damned scared that I'll muck this whole thing up," he sniffed.  "I realize I have no idea what I'm doing."
"Technically," Ron explained, "I am still ‘on duty’."  With an apologetic look, he continued, "I tried to get out of coming after I found out they weren’t actually giving me leave, but they insisted I show up.  And I know Dad would have wanted me to."
Then, one dragonfly separated from the flock, buzzing a tight cadence, and Harry noticed it wasn't an insect at all, but a very small fairy with long antennae and a skinny body.  The men watched it fly, weaving between them.  With lightening reflexes, Draco shot his hand out and snagged the fairy from out of the air.
A tingle of magic zapped through the air as if the entire room was cast in a halo of static electricity.  All of the hairs on Harry's arms lifted, his mop of a hairstyle frizzing to new heights as his anger stoked and his gaze bore into Draco, trying to read his soul.  But to Harry's perception it looked like Draco meant no wickedness.  Mischievousness sure, but he got the feeling that maybe this time, Draco was playing fair.  Well as fair as he could.
"Just now," Harry said, dragged out of the gloom he seemed to consistently find himself in.  "Ron, I can feel Hermione.  She's stronger; I can sense her more now."
The two sat there grinning like fools.  Harry couldn't believe they'd solved it.  Well, at least had a direction to go.  Suddenly the air shifted and the strength of Draco's smile softened.
it."  Severus whispered against the side of Harry's head, the soft breath circling around his outer ear sending a shiver down his back.  A tingle numbed his hand, and he could feel Severus forcing his magic into him… Harry shivered again; his groin flashed hot even with the cooling charm.  "Feel it.  Now look for your own.  Feel your magic and focus it to the wand."
"It can flush out mind control on people.  It is the stamen of the plant, so you have to care for it until it blooms," Neville explained.  "Technically it is an
"Why don't you use any spells?" Harry asked, trying to add steel to his voice, but it cracked nonetheless.
Harry shrugged, staring at the grease congealing on the thin slices of pepperoni resting on the mozzarella cheese.  He'd been studying it in silence for approximately five minutes, perhaps searching for the truth to the universe.
Shyly, Harry entwined his fingers with Snape's, his heart flipping for altogether other reasons, and together they stepped away from the safety of the solid blue walls.
The entire room sat as quiet as winter's first morning while new ideas popped into overtaxed brains.
First, he had to figure out what the Mastermind's goal was.  Why curse Hogwarts and Hogsmeade with odd mutations?  Were they all test subjects and this wicked ringleader would then turn his evil mutation ray on the world?  Maybe the Mastermind had hatred for all wizardkind, wanted revenge, the most noble of reasons!
It wasn't that he was thinking about Draco.  He was just horny, that was all.  It wasn't about Draco at all.
Wolfwood scowled at the group. "So, you have all of the portions of the Staff other than the orb," he began in a gruff tone as Apis shook her head in amused resignation at him. "And of that you know of its whereabouts. Why didn't you bring it as well?" Wolfwood asked but didn’t wait for any of them to answer. "As for that, where are the staff and the feather; we should put them under containment immediately."
Draco pulled out a chair, studying the small table where two plates were set out, a pitcher of pumpkin juice, coffee, toast, eggs, beans and rashers.  "You cook?"  Not only did it smell divine, it looked good.  The toast to a perfect golden brown, the rashers not too crispy.
"Kogelmann?" The name was spat out of Harry's mouth like he'd just taken a drink of something foul and it burned at this tongue like acid. This was the Dark Artefact peddler; this was the man who turned Auror against Auror, who carelessly caused the deaths of people for profit.
Harry searched inside himself and found more than a small desire to dash away Malfoy's pained expression.  Maybe it would be a smart word, a smile, or a kiss to the nose.  The combination of lips and Malfoy burned inside Harry, almost like the memory of Malfoy's flavor on his tongue.  Harry'd been alone for so long, these few hours with Malfoy had torn his old world down to the foundation and he found the new one not at all familiar.
Draco blinked.  Sharp words, somewhat jumbled and not entirely coherent, were popping into his mind and then quickly popped away.  He had to be quick to catch the wily things before he missed them entirely.  He would need a little practice.
"Malfoy."  Harry flumped forward, his hands braced on his knees as he caught his breath, his tail making lazy passes through the air.  He hadn't been so happy to see anyone in ages.  "Where is everyone," he asked once he'd caught his breath.  He shot Draco little glances, and the curious arch to Draco's eyebrows teased a smile to Harry's lips.
"Here, I'll make do with one fork," Pansy says, placing Harry's fork along the side of his plate and then patting it like an old pal.
"What happened?" Harry said, his voice rough and bleary.  Draco helped him to sit up, and Harry looked down at his elbow and began rubbing it, his face going stern.
"So… Harry. In the face of confessions… I have something I want to tell to you." Remus felt it was time to let his friend in on his dreams. One dream is fine. Two dreams can be written off as coincidence. But recurring dreams of the same nature telling him to go to Mexico… Well that could be a whole different bag of worms. Harry had experience with visions, and Remus was beginning to get an inkling that these were more than his simple subconscious working out the events in his life.
It was his birthday and Severus had returned to him and he came with news of the outside world and a way to get to Draco.
Hermione's eyes grew in shock, but it was the immediate drop of Ron's shoulders and spontaneous grin that really surprised Draco.
Ida Hathaway laughed and then winked at him.  Merlin, he hated it when she did that.  "I've spelled them to keep their scent to themselves until your classes are finished for the day, Mr. Malfoy.  They shouldn’t even be a bother."
"Hey guys! Got lunch." Ron walked in with a huge shit-eating grin and bags of take-out. He threw the bags at Remus, Draco and then Harry and sat down on the edge of Hermione's bed and attacked her with his lips. He kissed her mouth, nibbled her ears and nuzzled her neck, all enticing happy giggles from his fiancé.
Then the smile immediately dropped.  "He has a theory.  I'm on my way to catch the madman behind all of this."
"Guys," he said, his voice shaking and deep. The growl could not be hidden. "Help, please." Panic and fear and
He'd lost perhaps even more than Draco, who never had anyone to love except for his beautiful mother, twisted with desire for power. But on a few occasions he had seen Nymphadora Tonks with the mangy man and they had been happy. But his cousin was gone….
Draco's attention is drawn to Harry's one eye.  Something in it sparkles, like that damned fool Dumbledore's.  The man he couldn't kill.  The man who'd pried Draco's eyes open with his own death.
"We need to finish this spell. Whoever is next to lead, do it now!" he ordered. Already, Wolfwood had begun to chant, causing the fading purple glow to shine again.
"For running out on all of us!  You bastard.  We're here trying to add some sanity to your father's government, and you just run off to Merlin knows where and hide for the last… what fifteen years?"
A tentative hand touched Harry's shoulder, and then awkwardly began rubbing his back.  "Don't give up, Harry.  Please… I'd thought about dying so many times, then you were brought here and I realized I'm not alone.  Don't give up… I don't think I could do it alone."  His words were quiet in his confession, small and so very fragile.
"Potter, would you stop that."  The sneer.  The derision.  It was back.  But it was forced.  There was a moment of stillness where only the tick of the clock and the thick thudding of blood in his ears cut through it.  Still, Harry pulled back.
"Yeah… What's fucking going on? It was like a succession bomb of curses went off and then," Draco looked down at his arm, "my Mark… where my Mark was… i-it burned. Like it'd never burned before." He looked terribly sad. "And then Harry, something's wrong with him. Something is wrong with Harry." Draco looked up at Remus like he hoped the man had some answer and some way to fix the world's inherent woes.
you, I would have kept you?"  With two long strides Harry was on the other side of the desk, yelling in Draco's face.  They were chest to chest, and Draco realized that this body was the body he dreamed of at night, this voice was the one that moaned out his name.
"Well, Tufts.  Do you need a kitty box or are you toilet trained?" he asked with a smirk.  Tufts snarled silently at him and gave his paw two licks.
"Where are you?" he growled, unsure if he was really hearing Sirius or if it was some insane trick of his mind, that he was going crazy as some werewolves eventually did.
"So then, when we leave here…"  Harry grew silent, then looked down at his hands where he tugged on a blade of grass.
After he'd completed his list, he grabbed his coat and went to the Floo, only to be stopped by his houseguest.  Harry was sitting in the chair in the entrance room, chewing on his index finger's nail, his eyes wide and seemingly capable of ingesting every little detail.
"Oh, some form of influenza we think.  Over the last few days we've had quite a few people complaining about lack of energy and unstable magical levels.  We're still looking into it," she said as she busied herself with Hermione's diagnostics.
"I suggest you leave, before the police are brought in to take out the unwanted trash of this dubious establishment," Draco said, his voice full of command, and Harry found himself inching towards him.  Almost on their own accord, his hands rested on Draco's shoulders and Harry relaxed his head against that sturdy back.
that Harry has even less experience than he does, and he sums up all the reasons that that could be—war, the Dark Lord, fame Draco now knows Harry has never wanted—and hopes that however much trust Harry surrenders to him, Draco doesn't fuck this up.
He was mistaken.  Harry was not quietly waiting.  He wasn't waiting at all and after a brief inquiry of the man behind the counter, Harry'd left some twenty minutes ago.
He seriously considered going home when he suddenly heard his name emerge from the cacophony of bartering from down the street.
He thought about which mask to slip on, which line of small talk to ply Potter with and realized he simply didn't care.  With a shrug he said, "It's cold and smells like sheep shit."
Draco stared intently at Lucius, and nodded at every word.  He trusted Lucius with everything… well, almost everything.  The man's grudge against CatBoy was becoming quite… trying.  He was Draco's sidekick now, and Lucius had to accept that.  Draco had an inkling that his companion was jealous, that maybe
Someone walking close behind bumped into him as he lost his stride.  "Sorry," the woman apologized as she brushed past him.
Mimicking a modern Muggle shopping complex, Shepfield rose four stories high and shimmered inside like the Hope Diamond.  All glass and chrome, Harry found it a bit too sterile, but the job, he loved.  From the outside, it looked like an abandoned warehouse, a splatter of graffiti charmed as an anti-Muggle ward.
"I want to do a stakeout in Darren's field and see if we can find out how his sheep are going missing."  The way he rushed out the words, Draco bet he'd been reciting it over and over in his head over the last five minutes.
Harry stripped down and started the water flowing.  The showers in Grimmauld Place were quite fancy, but sometimes the temperature was a bit temperamental.  He tested the water with his palm and after some minor adjustments, stepped into the water.
"Granger, where is CatBoy?"  The woman jumped from her place at the table and stuffed her hands in her pockets.  Her behavior had turned nervous and ferrety.  Draco didn't trust her.  She obviously had something to hide.  Maybe the personality of her left hand was taking over, forcing her to do unspeakable things that only the side of
The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department (MMAD) is aware of illegally enchanted wool sweaters being manufactured and distributed to the Muggle public in County Cork, Ireland.
"But you are powerful, we can all tell. You and your friends. You're all… mighty or something," said the youth with a cocksure grin. Something about him reminded him of a younger Sirius, and so he looked at his godfather for comparison. Sirius only watched Harry with eyebrows raised.
A bark of laughter erupted from the man and he shook his head, his long hair swaying in a mesmerizing way.  "I made one very important choice in my life, Draco, and following that catastrophic mistake, all other choices had been taken from me.  Now, I am bound to no master."  He leaned back on his elbows, and Draco missed his warmth.  "And I quite like it."
