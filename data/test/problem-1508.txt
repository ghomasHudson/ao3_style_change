These thoughts rattling around in his mind made it very difficult to concentrate on producing a Patronus. Draco and Harry were running out of time—they were supposed to start teaching the rest of the class in the month of December, giving them about three weeks to prepare. Draco was very confident in Harry’s Occlumency abilities, although he realized a little too late that it may be difficult to give a demonstration on something happening inside someone’s head. Then he remembered the Triwizard Tournament. If they could stare at a lake and a cloudy hedge maze for an hour, the students could certainly sit through a lesson on Occlumency.
“No, you would still remember they happened. You just wouldn’t have any emotion to them, and the details would be less clear. I didn’t want that to happen to me. The memories I have of you as a child are some of my happiest, and I would be devastated if I even lost a little clarity on what happened. So I just talked to myself the entire time I was in Azkaban. I recited stories that I knew from when I was a little kid, I gossiped to myself about the other families, and did other things to distract myself. I didn’t want to think of anything positive once. It’s just good to have someone to talk to now.”
Draco scoffed. “The day that you go to Hogwarts and anyone can relax is the day that Kneazles will take to the skies.”
“Is your family having the ball this year, Daph?” Draco was always uncomfortable with silence, so he was often the first to break it.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded and smiled. “She’s home now, they let her go.”
Harry exhaled through his nose. “It must have been hard, to have been disliked on both sides,” he said quietly, extending a hand across the table.
Potter looked confused. Draco also wasn’t sure what was happening.
“No Malfoy, we have to go to the Hospital Wing. You lost a lot of blood. You’ll be just fine, but you need the right potion—“
“How do you feel, mate?” Greg asked.
The Auror grabbed his wrist, and Draco felt the nauseating sensation that he recognized as side-along Apparation. As soon as he landed in some sort of an office, he ran to vomit in the nearest wastebin. Taking a blow to the head and then feeling like you’re being suffocated in a narrow tube will do that, apparently. The Auror who apparated Draco sighed and steered him to the nearest chair.
Draco knew this was a simple puzzle, but for some reason his brain wasn’t cooperating. What did the “X”s mean?
Harry took out his wand. “What’s the problem? Is it your attackers?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. “Mother, I already told you—“
I’m going home for Thanksgiving break tomorrow, so I imagine I’ll either have a lot of chapters published this week or very few. Either way, I can guarantee a new one by Wednesday! As always, let me know what you think. Love you guys!
ago, we were barely—oh Merlin,” Draco said again, at a loss for words. Malfoys never lost their composure in such situations. What else had Draco confessed to people without his knowing?
“Draco, you have anxiety problems. They don’t just go away that easily, unfortunately. Just because you’ve had a good stretch doesn’t mean you won’t still have bad periods time and again. And when you have a bad time, it doesn’t mean you haven’t made any progress.”
“W—what?” Draco looked to Harry for guidance.
“Before you go,” Professor McGonagall handed him a sheet of paper. “Your lawyer dropped by, but I told him to come back at the same time tomorrow. He left you this form, though. If you want to visit your parents in Azkaban soon, you should give him this application when he comes. The sooner it is submitted, the better. He’ll be here at four in the afternoon.”
“Because of the new wards,” Hermione said. “They can detect any invisibility spells, and they say they can see through all invisibility cloaks,” she stole a glance at Harry. Draco wasn’t sure if the others knew that he had one. “I’m not sure how true that is, but if it is true and Draco is caught trying to sneak into the Ministry blatantly using invisibility, it won’t end well for him.”
“No I did not. You must be touched in the head.” Draco’s face was growing redder and redder.
Draco had come to terms with that and was almost looking forward to it. The Malfoys sat in the parlor, waiting to be taken away by the Ministry. Instead, the lawyers said that a certain someone convinced Kingsley Shacklebolt to hold a trial before their imprisonment. Until that time they were to be on house arrest. Because they did not commit as high crimes as other Death Eaters (their biggest offense was housing the Dark Lord), their trial was scheduled in a month’s time at the beginning of July. This was already bad news to Draco, who had finally come to terms with his death after facing it for nearly two years, but finding out Potter was cooperating the Minister on his behalf nearly sent him over the edge.
“There’s no need for that at the moment. You are not under arrested, you are merely being held until we determine what to do next. The Healer will come by to examine you soon.” Draco stammered, but Yarney shut the door.
Everyone looked at Draco, expecting him to speak. His mouth felt dry. “I’m here because the Minister is making me. I didn’t want to come back to this ridiculous school. And I’m not going to your stupid group either.”
“No, I mean...I’m sorry that I knew you weren’t lying and I didn’t say anything about it. I made things worse for you and that was wrong. I’m really, really sorry.”
The couple sat on the steps, trying to stave away the cold by keeping close, and looked at the stars. Draco began to calm down, and Harry asked gentle questions to extract the past few hours from Draco as though it were venom tearing away his body. By the time it was too cold to bear, Draco felt lighter.
welcome?” He pointed at the Slytherin table with malice in his eyes.
“Draco, why did you do this?” Draco turned his head to see Potter, his hair pressed to his forehead from sweat, glaring at him.
Draco went back to Hogwarts and immediately sent the application back to Mr. Burke, with only his mother’s name on it.
“I’m not sure there’s any comfort from this.”
“Isn’t that...Theo’s owl?” Greg said quietly, as though he was afraid to even say Theodore Nott’s name too loudly. It had been published in the
He finally was released from the spell. “I told you, Weasley, I can’t perform magic,” he snarled, trying to hide his fear. Hopefully this was just a stupid prank and not something more malicious.
“Ginny told me that he tortured first years. Is that true?”
What do you think is going to happen? What do you want to see in the next installment? Love you guys!
“Constant reminder that there’s no way a bloke like you would even be friends with me, let alone date me.” Draco hiccuped.
Harry raised his eyebrows and grinned in a good morning to Draco, while George and Arthur gave him a polite nod before continuing with their conversation. This was just fine with Draco; in fact it was somewhat of a relief not to have to make conversation.
“Harry, I—I think I have to tell my parents about us. Wait, no. I know I have to tell my parents about us.”
“Potter...he asked if any of our friends should come. He definitely does not think it’s a date.” Surprisingly, Draco’s friends looked disappointed when he said this.
Draco and Harry manage to sneak in to watch Narcissa Malfoy’s trial
Daphne grabbed Blaise’s arm and steered him into the nearest empty classroom. Draco and Greg followed. She shoved Blaise into a seat and slammed the door. “Alright,” she said much more gently than she treated the classroom furniture. “What’s the matter?”
, Draco realized. This was going to be a difficult year.
“Draco Malfoy. Who on this bench has died before?” Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. “I’m serious! I’ve died. And when I was standing in the Forbidden Forest, waiting for it to happen, it comforted me to know that overall I didn’t have many regrets. Now if you don’t want to date me because you’re worried about you, that’s okay. But I’m a full grown man and I’ve been through the ringer more times than most people have in their entire lives. So if you don’t want to date me because you’re worried about me, that’s ridiculous and impractical. And while you are certainly ridiculous—“ this earned a laugh out of Draco “—you’re not impractical.”
“No, it wasn’t,” Gregory Goyle stood up and sat next to Draco. “You’re an actual human being, I don’t know if you know that, but you are. I saw you wither away these past two years on the inside but become even more of a prick on the outside to compensate. It’s nice to know that you actually have a heart.”
“I get that’s frustrating, but what does that have to do with you?”
“Oh yeah, she made all of us do that too. It’s a good thing, though, in the end.”
“I wanted to thank you.” Luna spoke in the same even tone as though Draco had just not heard what she said rather than was baffled by it. “You treated me well when I was in your home. I appreciate that. Things would probably have been better for you if you acted like the others.”
“For the better part of the last year of his life, yeah.” Then Harry looked quizzical. “How do you know it’s on Grimmauld Place?”
Draco kept this in mind as he prepared for his next Mind Healer appointment the following Monday, the application still taunting him on his desk. Draco sat down in Christine’s office with a sigh.
The rest of that evening passed in a blink of an eye. Draco and Harry actually fell asleep on the couch together, after planting kisses on each other for the better part of an hour. Draco felt like he could be fully himself in front of Harry. Very few people saw the real him, saw the real way he wanted to act. His friends nowadays did, but earlier friends like Pansy and Vincent only saw the Draco who made up for his terror with arrogance. Draco had explained this to Harry, and he seemed to completely understand.
A high pitched whistle startled them both from their snogging. Draco remembering the kettle on the stove and pulled back from the kiss to swing his legs off Harry’s so he could stand. “Tea?”
"Yes, although I don't know how I'm going to spend it yet. Obviously haven't had a chance to talk with the kids."
Stopping a few inches from him, Draco said, “You know, I never thought I’d be saying this, but Granger was right. You really are totally clueless, aren’t you?”
He watched as Harry Adam's apple moved. He took a step closer, teasing. Now he could see the small beads of sweat forming on Harry's face. He wanted to lean in and lick the sweat from Harry's jaw, before the droplets rolled down his neck and vanished underneath his black shirt. Harry did not say a word, just watched Draco.
"That is true, but not like this."
“That bad?” Draco sidled over and sat on the small section of couch Harry had left available to him then maneuvered his legs to lay across Harry’s splayed legs, resting back on the couch’s arm.
“You can’t be serious?” Draco said angrily.
Harry took a large swig of wine this time. “One,” he answered as he set his glass back on the table. “But only because I caught her under it. Wasn't long after that we decided to go our separate ways.”
In a sleek black woollen coat, wool-lined leather gloves and a long silver scarf wrapped around his neck, Draco waited on the corner of Golden Square for Potter to show up. It was five minutes past noon and Draco wondered if he had been a bit too presumptuous about ordering the saviour of the wizarding world to help him make his department's Christmas celebration safe for Muggles to attend.
Harry had been gone three weeks and Draco still hadn’t received any word from him or the Auror Office. Hermione tried again to reassure him that it wasn’t unusual for Harry or other Aurors to maintain a radio silence while on a dangerous or secret mission, but her seeming lack of worry over Harry was becoming so suspicious in itself that he’d stopped listening.
Panting softly from the effort, Draco leaned on Harry’s back, listening to Harry catching his breath as well.
“Whatever, Malfoy,” Potter conceded. “What do you want?”
“Hi Professor. Err, I was actually hoping to speak to Professor Snape," Harry said, adding, "If you don’t mind?”
“Sure, Draco. That’s sound good. I’ll meet you outside then.” It wasn’t the first time they’d used each other’s first names, but it wasn’t very often that they did. Their dinner the week before had been very relaxed and, although Harry wasn’t sure he was ready to let his guard down yet, he was beginning to entertain the thought that Draco might be ready to move on.
“Nothing else from Harry, no.” Ron dodged.
Harry sighed. “We’ve been here nine hours. According to our sources, she was supposed to receive another shipment of ingredients this morning and all the evidence so far has been linked to this location.”
“Evening.”
Harry lowered his mug and his face held a begrudging smirk. “Madam Malkin’s still not back from her holiday then?”
“That will only be possible once I’ve finished,” Draco stated.
When Draco walked back into the lounge room with their mugs refilled, he found Harry with his head tilted back on the armrest, eyes closed. The expression on his face told Draco he was in deep thought. Setting the mugs down on the side table, he moved behind Harry’s head, placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders and began to massage them through his robes. Harry opened his eyes and looked quizzically up at Draco. “What are you doing?”
"Looks like good old Lucius will be in Azkaban before the end of the year," Ron chimed.
"Lucius knew what he was getting himself into," Ron said.
The curtain around the triage bed rustled and Draco Malfoy appeared in the gap. "Thought they were your dulcet tones, Potter. What's he complaining about, Louise?"
While they were cleaning up, Draco’s wand began to spin wildly in his hand.
Draco’s joking and flirting played on Harry’s mind throughout lunch as they sat at their own house tables. Harry watched Draco laughing away with Blaise and noticed the group they had met in the corridor looking between him and Draco. Harry couldn't take it anymore. He had to know if Draco returned his feelings.
“Sure, why not. I’ve got tomorrow off, how about then?”
“I thought we had limited time,” Potter answered. “So, I thought Apparating to the next point would save us some time and I can fill you in later. Oh, and it might be best to let me do the talking at the next pub, too.”
Harry rolled his eyes then waved his wand to finish righting his clothes and correcting Draco’s before casting disillusionment charms over them both. Next, Draco felt Harry clamped a hand around his bicep and disapparated them without warning.
“But mine isn't... even… green. It's brown.” Harry heard Eoin say between sobs. He recognised the boy from his Defense Against the Dark Arts class; a timid Ravenclaw with muggle parents and a fear of disappointing both them and his house.
table.”
Dumbledore’s portrait gave a knowing “Mmm,” and sported a large smile, which made Snape’s portrait roll his eyes and shake his head. McGonagall didn’t pay them any attention. “Harry, surely you know that information is confidential. Do you have an issue with Draco teaching Potions?”
“Yes,
His eyes travelled up and down the body before him as he tried to decide what his next move should be. Finally, he lowered his gaze towards Harry’s exposed belly and proceeded to place soft kisses on it. He snaked his right arm behind his lover’s back and used it to pull him closer as he intensified the kisses with gentle sucking and small licks at the tantalising skin.
Three weeks later.
“I took the day off.”
"What?"
Several minutes later, Draco finally saw the witch that had been talking to Avalon leave. He rose and approached her desk again.
“Oh. I see. Not at all,” said McGonagall, although Harry got the distinct impression she felt a bit dejected.
Three weeks later.
"Draco… I'm not going to lie and say your father didn't deserve his sentence. But you know that's not what this is about. I've seen the way you’ve been looking at me. You keep flirting with me to give people more things to spread rumours about. It’s making me think you really do have feelings for me and I can’t ignore mine any longer."
“Mr. Potter! So good to see you. You never got back to me about that biography—“
The stall wasn’t large, but Draco reached a trembling hand up to unlock the door, letting Harry inside. He was sure that he looked a mess and certainly didn’t smell great after the bout of vomiting, but Harry pressed close to him anyway. Draco leaned back and closed his eyes as Harry gently placed a cool towel on his forehead. Harry rested his hand on the top of Draco’s head and slowly stroked his hair.
“What did you say?” It seemed that now Lucius wanted to be a parent. However, where four years ago he would have made Draco apologize for his insolence, at least now he was sheepish enough to let it slide. “Come sit with your Mother and I so we can have breakfast as a family before you have to leave.”
Finally, the man looked up from his scribbling. He wore a blank expression.
“Eh, I’m not that hungry—“
Granger opened the box with the Quaffles and the Snitch. She held the glittering object up high as it excitedly danced in her hands. Everyone else mounted their brooms, wearing old uniforms with jackets to combat the autumn winds. “And—play!” Granger released the Snitch and everyone took off. Draco was a little wobbly and worked to balance himself, meaning that Potter was able to get a head start on the Snitch. Draco zoomed after him, quiet and focused. A younger version of himself may be trying to come up with the best insults to hurl at Potter to distract him—
Draco scoffed. “Actually, why are you here at all? I would have thought you’d be Head Auror right out of the gate.”
“Excuse me! Excuse me, so sorry. I’m really late for the Malfoy trial, it started ten minutes ago—“ A reporter barreled past the group of students, not even noticing the Boy Who Lived.
Draco had two choices. He could either lie to his parents about his true feelings, as he always did, or he could finally take a stand. What could they possibly do? He was a full grown adult now, and in much better standing than either of them. “Actually, yes. Harry Potter and I are in a relationship.”
“Listen, Malfoy, whatever you’re trying to play at, we’re going to figure it out sooner or later,” Zacharias Smith piped up from the back. Most other people nodded.
“Because blood loss is a serious thing Mr. Malfoy, and you didn’t take any potions for it! I will not have any students dying under my watch.” She jotted down a note for Madame Pomfrey and handed it to him. Draco took this as a cue to leave and stood up.
Draco climbed into bed and sat down propped up, pulling the covers over him and focusing on the moonlight. Tonight would be the hardest night since Draco had nothing to do to keep his mind occupied. In fact, as the seconds ticked by, Draco became more and more anxious. He had to both stay awake and somehow not think about anything that could trigger another whatever-that-was like he had on the train.
Draco was left standing alone and feeling horrified. Did he do something wrong? Did he ruin one of the only things that he lived for? Maybe he was overthinking things, maybe the elusive figure in Potter’s altered consciousness wasn’t him. That had to be it—Draco was thinking too much about himself again. He decided to consult his friends at lunch.
“No, I know who it is.” Draco opened the letter.
Harry looked at him. “I know you’re not the same. You’re still a rude prick, but...you’re not like how you were on the train sixth year.”
Harry looked at Draco for a second. “You really don’t know? You don’t know why I’m mad.” The last part was more of a statement than a question. Harry sighed. “Come with me.”
Putting his wand back into his pocket, he grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them to the stone wall beside his head. He gave Harry’s mouth a quick passionate kiss, before moving back down to his neck with Harry leaning his head back against the wall to give him better access.
“Oh, err, sorry. Christmas cheer getting to me, I guess.” Ron cleared his throat. “Officially, I haven’t had any communication from Harry.”
“At least once a month,” Draco recalled.
When Harry arrived home that night, he barely acknowledged Draco. Instead heading straight for the bedroom directly from the fireplace. Draco did a double take. His mouth opened to greet Harry as he came in, hopefully with a kiss or two, now hung wide with surprise at being completely ignored and walked past.  He steeled himself and followed Harry up the stairs. Reaching their bedroom, he found Harry had already accio’d a suitcase onto the bed and was directing clothes into it with his wand.
He couldn’t argue with that. He took a sip of his punch and scanned the room. He looked at the clock. Nearly nine. Only three hours before the new year began. “Isn’t it time for your speech?” he asked Hermione. She looked at the clock too. “So it is. Excuse me, Harry.” She left towards the podium that was set up at the far end of the room.
“Since when?”
Harry and Ron had been seen by Muggles duelling with one of the last elusive Death Eaters throughout the city streets of Manchester. Fortunately for them, it had been on a night when one of the Muggle football matches was being played at the local ground and he was able to pass it off as some nutters playing with flares.
"Yes, finally." Harry watched his forearm healing. "It's taken nearly a year, but he's finally in custody. I made sure Kingsley took him in."
“I still don’t
“Is that so?”
He sighed. “I know. I’m sorry. I'll try to remember better for next time. Though, I still think it would have been nice to know before McGonagall made the announcement.”
A week later Harry found himself back on a triage bed. This time with a couple of fractured and bruised ribs. As he lay there, he could hear footsteps getting closer to the privacy curtain. Squinting in their direction, he made out black boots as they appeared beneath the curtain before it was pushed aside for a tall blonde figure to slip through.
As a Christmas present to his seventh year students, Harry dismissed them ten minutes early from their last class before the Christmas break. This also allowed him ample time to head down to the dungeons to catch Draco during the small break between the end of  class and the beginning of the end of term feast.
Santa Claus is coming town.
“So far, so good. But we still need to see about the food and the options for decorations. We can’t have the room looking this plain. And then there is the matter of the entertainment,” Draco was glad to be able to talk about something he knew. “A band might be too much for this small space. Gramophone perhaps?” Why Potter was laughing? There was nothing funny about what he had said.
I hope you are well. I would appreciate it if you could meet me for lunch tomorrow.
“What?” Harry took the seat opposite Draco, although he immediately felt uncomfortable with his back to the window.
Draco retrieved his wand from inside the decorations bag and pointed it at the door. He cast both a locking and a silencing charm. No sooner had he turned his back on the door, poised to start enchanting the decorations, when he heard the creak for the doorknob turning and the door moving on its hinges.
“I should not tell you things more often,” Harry whispered into Draco’s neck and punctuated it with a kiss.
Harry downed the antidote in one then exclaimed, "It wasn't just one, it was a whole bloody swarm." He took a few breaths before continuing. "We were raiding an abandoned house we thought a few suspects were hiding in. Turns out the Doxys had made a nest of the front room and didn't appreciate the intrusion."
Was it because of what he did? Could they start to build their friendship again? Harry would happily settle for being friends, knowing it was highly unlikely Draco would ever want anything more.
“Yes, please.”
Draco knew he had won this round. “Meet me outside Golden Square tomorrow at noon.” He turned to leave when Potter found his voice again.
“So what’s your problem?” Draco asked. “If we can plan out what we need for the celebration tonight, we will have less to do during the week.”
“Draco.” It was a gentle warning.
It didn’t take long for Draco to find out that she had, in fact, meant
One of the Slytherins lightly shoved another and said, “See, I told you.” It took a bit longer for Harry to compose himself enough to turn and catch up to Draco.
“Got any better ideas other than to stand out here in the open? Between the walls we’ll at least have enough cover to remove our disillusionment charms. I don’t know about you, but being under one for too long can be unsettling.”
“Nice to see you too, Potter.” Malfoy smiled broadly, ignoring Potter’s question. “Obviously whatever you were in the middle of wasn’t
Harry automatically went to shrug and immediately regretted the action, cursing under his breath. Draco gave a small laugh. "Glad you think it's funny. Do you mind doing your job now?"
"Draco," Harry said softly, which had the desired effect of making Draco look up at him. "I'd love to have dinner with you and the boys."
“Do you think they’re on a date?”
“Wait a minute.” All the absurd scenarios Draco had played out in his head the previous day were suddenly becoming very plausible. “You didn't deliberately chase known Death Eaters into Muggle areas on the off-chance I was sent to the scene, have you?”
“How long will you be gone?”
“It’s not even five,” Harry said and the confident, arrogant Potter was back.
After Potions, Harry followed Draco towards the Slytherin Common Room and pulled him into a side corridor before they reached the entrance.
“Potter, are you blushing?”
“Same reason your weasel of a boyfriend and Potter keep blundering around for all the Muggle world to see. To make more work for me. You know, your boyfriend and Potter have a lot to answer for. I don’t know how many times I’ve had to cover their arses in the past year. It’s a good thing Muggles are so willing to believe whatever story we make up.”
“If he gets back in time, yes.”
Harry went through several more songs and Draco listened as patiently as he could. But it didn't take long and he removed one of the the buds and finished eating his own meal. This didn't seem to deter Harry from skipping through what seemed liked hundreds of songs stored on the small Muggle device.
“How about tomorrow? I'll meet you in the Great Hall for lunch and we can talk about the issues you've been having before we go down and do some practical things.”
“For what?”
“I want to testify at the Malfoy’s trial. I know it will help Draco escape an Azkaban sentence at the very least and may even help his mother too, but it comes with a catch.”
"Think you're funny, do you Malfoy?" Draco didn't seem to hear Harry as he started to point his wand at Harry's leg. "What are you doing?"
“I keep telling you I can’t discuss these things with you, even if you weren’t an ex-Death Eater.” Harry said a little shortly.
What was that supposed to mean?
“No, it doesn’t,” Harry said firmly. He lifted his head off the couch to offer Draco his green eyes and his expression was tired and pleading. “Now, will you please drop it already?”
It was five to six o’clock when one of the staff members approached Draco. “Excuse me, sir. We have finished setting the tables. Do you require any assistance with the tree?”
Harry unwrapped it to reveal a long infinity scarf that had tones of red, green, a golden yellow and a silver grey all artfully mixed together.
“Glad you approve.”
"Yes, but he's with another patient. This won't take a minute, Mr. Potter."
Hermione looked up from the parchment she’d been perusing. “Not since Sunday. I heard you had a date Saturday.”
Their meals arrived, and Draco had a moment to think of a suitable response. “Ah...sorry you and Ginny didn't work out.”
“I do have feelings for you,” Draco admitted and quickly added, “but it would never work.”
Ron looked up at McGonagall on the teacher's table and then across to Draco. "He's still a stuck-up git."
“Was it really that surprising McGonagall asked me?” Draco managed to sound both hurt and curious at the same time.
Draco's direct bedside manner didn't leave much room for small talk. It seemed like their required interaction was over and Harry couldn't think of any way to prolong it before Draco was saying, "And try to limit your field work for the next couple of weeks while the bruising settles."
He listened to Harry and Amelia while studying the list of food. The menu wasn’t all that different from what he’d had for Christmas dinners at Malfoy Manor throughout his childhood.
In the few days that had passed since Malfoy had entered the tea house with another wizard, Harry couldn't get the way the blonde had kept looking at him off out of his mind. He had found out who the wizard had been at least; Charles Stapleton, one of the talent scouts for England’s Quidditch team.
“Comfortable, Malfoy?” he heard Granger ask, announcing her presence in his office. For someone who berated others about manners, she had a bad habit of walking in without knocking. “Hobson asked me to pass on your latest assignment,” she said as she handed him a scroll of parchment.
Draco sighed heavily with disappointment. He meant for the sigh to sound put-on but some part of him actually did feel sad about Harry's refusal. “I suppose we won't have any Christmas music then.”
“See,” said Ron, clearly continuing a conversation neither Draco nor Harry had heard. “I told you Harry was already here. I know his spells when I feel them.”
“Show-off,” Draco said under his breath and flicked through the pieces of paper. It seemed all the things he had written on the parchment were still intact.
“I thought we were past hiding things from each other too.” The words came out of Harry’s mouth before he even knew he was speaking them aloud. Malfoy had always been able to push his buttons like that, but Harry wasn't sure he was aiming to this time around. “I mean--”
Draco's eyes looked shocked, but the rest of his face was schooled into nonchalant. He gave a couple of slow blinks as he seemed to study Harry. Then he finally looked away and almost whispered, "You’re right."
When they were both out on the street again, Potter turned to him and asked, “Where to next?”
“Nothing of the sort. I just think we need a bit more cover from the growing number of eyes around.”
Draco felt the replying shrug and could picture the smug look he was certain was on Harry’s face. He liked that look on Harry, but usually not when it was directed at him. “I will get you to tell me what has all your muscles in knots,” Draco said and bit Harry’s earlobe softly before traced kisses down the line he had licked seconds before, drawing a sound from deep in Harry’s throat.
As he walked with Hermione and Ron to Charms, Harry started to think about all the things he’d witnessed that he could use at Draco's trial. While Professor Flickwick lectured about the history and uses of the next charm they needed to learn, Harry made himself busy scribbling a list.
“Then why are you packing the largest suitcase?” Draco asked.
“What?” came Harry’s whispered reply.
“This is the Muggle world, Potter,” Draco said quietly. “I’m sure I don’t need to remind you that we don’t want to attract too much attention. Unlike you, I know when to be discreet and when it is appropriate to be extravagant, which is no doubt what you were expecting.” Draco gave Potter a short smile. He knew he was right about Potter’s expectations. They reached a corner and he turned his attention to the street signs.
It had been a long time since Draco had contemplated a romantic relationship with anyone. But him and Potter? Why would people believe they were a couple? Especially anyone who knew their history. Unless Granger knew more than she was letting on. Had Potter really told her it was a date? Did Potter want to go on a date him?
“I cannot deny that.”
“Let me guess. It will be at the expense of Lucius.”
, as such. I assume you were planning to go with him?”
“And unofficially?” Draco pressed.
Draco wasn't sure what he was supposed to be ready for, but he nodded his confirmation.
"Okay, okay," Draco said pulling out his wand. "I thought you must like my bedside manner or something since you keep requesting me as your Healer."
"You didn't sound particularly confident. Is Healer Malfoy around?"
“It was only on the cheek, but I see your point. She probably forgot we were still in public and was just excited you’d agreed to move in with me. She knew how much it meant to me.” Harry smiled fondly at the memory.
“Why? What difference would it have made when you found out?”
"Maybe you should ask Draco on your next date," Hermione teased.
“Wha-... what?” Draco felt as if his eyebrows were at the top of his forehead and his eyeballs almost out of their sockets.
“Any ideas who that wizard he’s sitting with is?”
You better watch out
...maybe he’ll be all my own in a big red bow.
After two hours of Harry giving his testimony, the trial was adjourned for the night to continue the following morning.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” Harry asked, annoyance clear in his voice. He gestured in the direction where the other Aurors had departed. “We were in the middle of something.”
“What position? Seeker, like you were for Slytherin?” Harry asked, obviously ignoring Draco’s snide remark.
“It’s nothing to do with my family, is it?” Draco couldn’t help himself. It wouldn’t be the first time Harry had investigated something connected to the Malfoy name.
“What? And spoil the fun of seeing your surprised and annoyed face?” Draco said, with his usual smirk. He knew it drove Harry nuts. As expected, he received a scowl before Harry started pacing again.
Harry sighed. “What do you want, Draco?”
Walking through the Auror Office, Draco hadn’t imagined the red head would be that hard to find. Only one of them was an Auror after all. “What are you doing here, Malfoy?” asked someone from behind him. Draco turned around to see the ginger hair he’d been looking for.
“Okay. And if I can't find anyone…” Harry paused and took a deep breath as if working up the courage to say the next words. “If I can't find anyone, I'll do it for you.”
He received a half laugh, half moan in response to his actions. “Thought you could use the positive encouragement since you’re not going to get any answers out of me.”
“Sorry… Minerva. Habit.”
"He should let you clean his leg now," Draco said to Lousie as Harry stared at his completely healed, yet still a bit bloody, leg. When he looked up, all he saw was Draco's blonde ponytail disappearing through the curtains.
"It works better if we remove the pieces of gravel first, Mr. Potter." She tried to coerce him to straighten his leg again so she could continue. He hugged his leg and examined the wound himself. He'd never studied healing spells in great detail, but he was sure that Madam Pomfrey could have handled the extensive graze up the side of his leg and knee in a few seconds flat.
“Expected something to happen sooner?”
“Positively uneventful compared to yours,” Draco said, deflecting Harry’s attempt at changing the subject.
Couples holding hands, places to go
“Positive that I’ve had no signs from my wand,” Draco answered then added under his breath, “At least, not the wand you’re referring to.” Why did Harry have to look so sexy while they were on duty?
“What do you mean?”
The morning of Christmas Eve came and went without any news of Harry from the Ministry. Draco was debating with himself about whether to go to Harry or not. Maybe he should owl Ron directly for news? No, that would take too long. And what if an owl was already on its way to him?
Being that close, he couldn’t help but breathe in Draco’s scent. Definitely intoxicating. He started to straighten back up when he felt Draco lean into him and whisper a reply. “You’re welcome.” Then a warm hand was on his chin turning his head and before his knew what was happening, Draco was kissing him. His lips were soft and sweet and gone before Harry wanted the kiss to stop. He opened his eyes (though he couldn’t remember closing them) and saw shining grey ones looking back at him.
“Yeah, you’re right. Maybe I’m just being paranoid.”
Harry’s frown turned into a smile. “Better make it extra strong.”
“Website?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised.
"Did you catch him this time, at least?" Draco asked as he held Harry's forearm in his hand while pointing his wand and repeating a spell to knit the skin back together after it had been slashed wide open. Ron had done his best to close the wound at the scene before apparating them to St Mungo's.
Draco looked at his watch. Quarter past twelve. Potter was coming. He started to walk towards the closest pub on his list and wondered why he felt so disappointed at Potter’s no-show. Their interactions didn’t hold any hostility these days but they weren’t exactly friends. Just amicable.
“Thank you, though there isn't that much and I expect other help to arrive shortly,” Draco replied.
“So, how many people have you snogged under the mistletoe?” The question was out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop it.
Potter’s smile grew before he closed the door and drew his wand. A few whispered incantations later and he was back facing Draco.
Watching Potter remove his coat and accessories before sitting across from him at a table in the corner of the first pub they had visited, it occurred to Draco this was possibly the longest amount of time he had spent alone with Potter voluntarily. He was surprised to find he hadn’t loathed company for the most part, especially when he thought back on their relationship, or rather the lack of one, only a few years ago. Harry knew more about Muggles and it did get up Draco's nose, since it was now a part of his job, but he could live with it.
“I’m sure he will be doing his best to get back for it then.”
She shook his hand and introduced herself as the pub’s manager, Amelia, before casting her eyes in Draco’s direction.
“Umm, I beg your pardon,” Amelia said. She looked confused. What was she confused about? She was the one talking nonsense and he’d answered her question, hadn’t he?
“I know you, Harry.”
“I’ll do my best.”
Harry knew he still had to try and help Draco, even if it meant having to sacrifice Lucius. Harry couldn’t see any way the Wizenagot would let Lucius walk free after all the things he had done, but he needed some advice on the best way to handle the situation to cause as little backlash as possible. There was only one person he could think to ask who was a chance of helping, so he made his way to McGonagall’s office that afternoon.
“You’re pathetic, Potter,” he said, moving so his mouth was inches from Harry's.
“What do you think?” Harry spoke first.
Harry unfolded the scarf, tossed it so one end looped over Draco’s head and pulled him in for a snog. If this was how Harry was going to thank him, Draco made a mental note to be more thoughtful with his gifts from now on.
Harry grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled the offending hand away from his crotch. Draco smirked before stepping back to start casting protective spells around them so they wouldn’t be discovered.
“What? With you?” Harry asked.
When Draco thought Harry was loose enough, he spelled more lube onto his throbbing erections and gradually pushed his way inside until he was fully seated. He knew Harry was ready for him to move when his hips nudged back into his own and heard Harry’s whispered, “Please, Draco.”
"I can assure you I'll have your legs back to normal in no time." The healer handed Harry a glass containing a blue potion. "Drink this. It will make your limbs numb. I can give you a Sleeping Draught as well, if you like?"
Hermione showed him her parchment and Harry saw 'dark spell residue check up' on the list.
"Are you enjoying seeing me in pain?"
Draco scowled and cursed Harry’s use of quick wit against him. Even in his most vulnerable state, his lover hardly skipped a beat. It was moments like these that made Draco want to looking into those brilliant green eyes while making love and ensure the dark haired man knew just how special he was, even without being the wizarding world’s saviour.
Harry wondered if Draco had done it deliberately to annoy him. Surely he'd seen them sitting here.
Two months later
“Okay then,” Draco said and stood up. “Off you go and enjoy tonight's feast.”
It wasn’t long before they were at Harry’s usual table with Ron seated to the side, half facing the door.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” There was no malice in the words like there used to be. Instead, Harry seemed embarrassed and almost playful.
He gazed down to see Harry was wearing his favourite dark blue jeans, which were tight enough for Draco to see the small bulge growing in the front.
have something to do with my family?”
"Right."
“Hello Draco,” Hermione greeted.
Was he really that easy to read? It had been a nice lunch and surprisingly less awkward than Harry had anticipated. Most of the conversation had revolved around Harry being injury prone and their children.
“That would be great,” Potter said smiling stupidly at the woman.
Draco still wasn't looking at him.
Harry Potter. Draco’s stomach felt like it did a backflip when Harry walked into the fitting room. He fought the urge to put his arms down before Madam Malkin walked in behind him and said he could.
“What were we supposedly doing today?” he asked as he pulled out the chair next to Harry and sat down to wait for Kreacher to serve them breakfast.
Less than a week later.
“I want to cross a few off the list.” Potter proceeded to walk down to the street, looking for a quiet alley. Draco followed and listened to Harry's reasoning on why the pubs weren’t suitable. It seemed to Draco that the war had affected Harry more than he let on as he was more familiar with the pubs than Draco would have ordinarily believed him to be. By the time he was finished, there were only three other pubs Potter deemed appropriate for both wizard and Muggle attendees.
him? And give him a genuine smile? It may have just been his imagination but there seemed to be more to the ‘thank you’ than Draco was letting on. But what?
In Transfigurations, Harry struggled to concentrate on the task of transforming a robin into a mop. Each time he tried, the robin ended up as a sleek black handled broom with white bristles.
“Not a problem. Just feel free to let me or my staff know if you require any other assistance.” She left Draco in the room with the staff.
“Lucius Malfoy, we sentence you to ten years in Azkaban, with a review of your case to be held after five.”
that predictable,” Draco scoffed.
Harry visibly took a breath before answering. “No.”
“Err, no,” replied Harry. “I guess I just wasn’t expecting to be going somewhere so…”
“But... Since when…?”
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” said Harry as a small green box with a silver ribbon tied around it floated in the air towards them. Draco took a worried sidelong glance at Harry who motioned for Draco to take it when it was close enough. Surely it was too soon for proposals, wasn’t it? “Go on. Open it,” Harry said calmly.
“If you want any information, you will need to fill out the form.”
"How were these sustained?" asked the healer.
The Ministry's end of year parties were always fairly rowdy. Harry was dancing with Hermione, glad the year was finally over. “I think you have an admirer, Harry,” Hermione shouted into his ear over the loud music.
“Hello Granger. Where are we going?”
Draco straightened himself and concentrated on the muscles in Harry’s shoulders and neck, working his fingers into all the tight spots. Harry’s nearly inaudible moans encouraging Draco to explore the muscles further down Harry’s back and the pressure he exerted through his fingers urged Harry to lean forward; his murmuring growing louder. Draco lifted Harry's heavy cloak so he could knead the muscles throughout his partner’s back more effectively and he was sure he heard Harry whispering “yes” more than once as he did.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing only a few feet behind him. “Now, was there anything else I’ve missed or that you think I should be doing? Perhaps placing myself beneath the tree with a big red bow around my neck?” Draco teased. He remembered the first Christmas song Harry had played for him.
“You forgot the star on top of the tree,” Harry said from the opposite corner where he set up a computer. Draco looked to the tree and saw Potter was correct. How could he have forgotten the star?
Harry wondered if the meeting had had anything to do with the conversation Ron had reminded him of from the charity event. Corrupting the team selectors to get one up on him was something Harry wouldn’t put passed Malfoy.
“Then go home and figure out a Christmas present for Harry.”
“Hmm, my dad didn’t mention it.”
Harry turned back to face the front of the room where Draco was still standing. “I wasn't spying on anyone,” he exclaimed as he walked further in. “I just entered the room thinking all the students had gone and stayed back when I realised they hadn't.” Harry finished standing a few feet from Draco.
“I did not bring you here to watch me ‘show off,” Draco retorted. “You’re here as back-up.”
Draco was spared having to explain himself as the doors shut closed and the elevator shot up the shaft. As soon as the redhead was out of sight, Malfoy strode down the corridor and into the Auror Office. He immediately spotted Potter sitting atop his desk giving orders to three other Aurors. He looked up as Draco moved purposefully towards the group.
“It’s the one I was using to communicate with Ron and Hermione,” Harry explained.
“Why are you massaging my shoulders?” Harry asked.
“Of course. Just you and me. And we'll make sure you're just as good as everyone else, if not better.”
"Of course it is. They all have the Dark Mark, don't they?"
“Well, you’re in luck. You have to stay here for observation until midday.”
This time it was Ron who looked down at the table, a hint of guilt in his expression.
“So you keep saying.” She peered at him through her spectacles, making him feel rather uncomfortable. “How can I help you, Harry?”
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked.
“Of course you do. You could let Ron apply.”
He fiddled with the parchment in his pocket. It listed all the pubs around Muggle London he had picked out as potential locations to hold the celebration. He figured a pub would ensure there was plenty of alcohol to blame for any magic slip-ups by the wizards and witches.
“That’s next Friday, isn’t it?” said the bartender as he flipped forward a few pages in the book.
"He won't let me clean the deeper areas of his grazed shin before I close it."
One month later.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“I did overhear someone this morning discussing the case Harry is working on.”
Underneath my Christmas tree
Draco refused to believe that no one had received any indication that the saviour of the wizarding world was still alive and well. Three weeks of nothing’s surely deserved at least some panic, if not a rescue mission. And since there was nothing of the sort being organised, someone was keeping information from Draco.
"You have some nerve, Potter. You know that?"
Draco wasn't sure if Harry was being serious or sarcastic. It didn't really matter though. He had asked Potter to help him with an assignment, not on a dinner date.
He's making a list
“Do you think they’ll ever be friends?” Scorpius asked, wishfully.
Draco’s heart was pounding. Part of him wanted to say
Harry was only half paying attention to Ron’s story while he watched Draco lead his guest to a table close by. His guest sat with his back to them and Draco sat facing the man and, in turn, facing Harry.
Harry quickly turned back to face the mirror but Draco could make out the slight flush in his cheeks.
...He's all I want, just for me
"They must not expect it to take long if they are setting a date so close before Christmas," Hermione commented.
And so the conversation went forth very amicably. Soon, Draco and Ron were ribbing on each other for various fights and arguments they had in their school years. Harry joined in, and the three were laughing until the sun began to set.
somehow and figured out that Draco had been spending a lot of time with Harry?
Greg smiled at him. “Of course it is, mate. A friend of yours is a friend of ours.” Blaise scoffed, and Daphne glared at him.
“I’ll be in my quarters grading papers should you need me,” Professor McGonagall said, and took her leave through the back door.
Draco walked through his memories, wondering what he could share with everyone that would show them he didn’t have the best year either, that would demonstrate that he had been on the receiving end of the Dark Lord’s wrath, too. The only one he could think of was...but he couldn’t handle that.
Draco was fearful and mortified. Did Ginny think that he had told Harry everything? That he had made Harry talk to her on his behalf? “How did you know? How did you know where I was, and that Weasley was involved?”
” in one notebook. He gasped as he saw it appear on the other notebook.
Finally his mind gave him a rest. He was aware of Harry stripping him down to his underwear and then dressing him in blankets instead, and he was aware that they were in Hagrid’s cabin. He even had the decency to be a little embarrassed that they were in the home of the professor he tried so desperately to get fired. But everything else felt twinkly, and he calmed down as his emotions melted into mush.
Finally they reached a private room which was under a magical lock.
“I guess it’s just more complicated than that.” Harry offered Draco a tight smile, signaling to Draco that the conversation was over.
“Are you kidding me? If you talk to Kingsley, that’s when it’ll get worse. Especially with my parents’ retrial coming up. Trust me, it’s fine.”
Draco wasn’t hungry but knew he couldn’t miss the first family dinner since he had been home. He pulled out Narcissa’s chair for her while Lucius sat down unsteadily. Draco took a better look at his father. He certainly seemed much improved since his hospital stay, but kept the same manic look in his eyes that Draco hated when he first got out of Azkaban one and a half years ago. Lucius made no move to cut his steak, but made searing eye contact with Draco. Draco swallowed and glanced at his plate.
As the two walked back to their room, not quite hand-in-hand but fingers touching along the way,  Draco knew two things for sure. Number one: he never wanted Harry to be mad at him again. Number two: the fact that Harry cared enough to be mad at him was one of the best feelings in the world.
Granger gave him a sly smile as she stirred her tea. “You know, not too long ago, you were the one giving negative quotes about Potter to the
His stomach fell as he pictured his mother’s face. Narcissa would think he abandoned her—how would she go on? She told him many times in his summer illness that he was the most important thing in her life. Eyes filling with tears, Draco made an attempt to stand. The least he could do would be to die privately in his room. He also wanted to scribble a quick note that he did not kill himself and that he loved his mother very much.
Draco found the hallways blissfully empty as he walked down to the Potions classroom. He had been fighting a certain feeling for the past few days, but as he thought about the subject, he was again reminded that he missed Professor Snape dearly. Most of the teachers at Hogwarts had found the Malfoys and other pureblood families unfavorable, so it was incredibly nice for Draco to feel wanted. He often lingered after class, talking to Snape about various things, opening up to him about his worries and fears.
“Well, you aren’t wrong in the wizarding world, I suppose. And frankly I’m sick of it. I don’t want people to hate me either. I want something in between, where I can just—exist. Sort of how you treat me now, you know? You aren’t insulting me every second but you don’t go around claiming I saved the world all the time. It’s refreshing. So thank you, for that.”
Draco stared at his name in Theo’s handwriting and sighed. His friends made good points. But he and Theo had always been friendly—what if he was in trouble? Also, Draco knew that Theo was aware Draco was up to something sixth year, and Theo never said anything. Didn’t Draco owe the same to him? Maybe he was in a hard spot with his parents just like Draco had been.
"Okay," Harry sighed. "I took Malfoy out to lunch to thank him for healing me over the last few months."
“So what do I do?”
“What can I get for ya?”
lock on the door?”
“Of course. I look forward to hearing from you.” Amelia lead them out of the room and back down the stairs. Potter gave a slight bow towards her and waved at the barman before he turned towards the exit without another word. Since when had Potter learned manners, let alone was using them? Harry was almost out the door before Draco gathered himself enough to bow and wave, too.
Draco felt Harry’s arm relax before he heard the resigned sigh, then felt Harry start to turn around and face the direction Draco wanted to head. Draco loosened his grip of Harry’s arm, but kept his hand raised, feeling across Harry’s muscular back before grabbing hold of the opposite arm.
“There is more than one Harry in this department, Mr Malfoy,” Avalon stated, her face deadpan.
Christmas morning, Draco woke up to kisses on his shoulder, Harry’s bare chest against his back and an arm around his chest. He turned around to give Harry a soft kiss. “Merry Christmas, Harry.”
It opened to reveal Ron and Hermione, wearing in a black suit and a red cocktail dress respectively.
“I was looking for you actually, Weasley.”
“Potter in the office?” Draco asked nonchalantly.
“I believe it is called a pub,” Draco answered, a smug tone to his voice. There was no shortage of pubs around London. Surely one of them would have a private space available for the Friday ahead.
Draco eyed it suspiciously before taking it from her and unrolling it to read his boss’s scrappy handwriting.
“I’m sorry Mr Malfoy,” Avalon said, maintaining her calm. “I assure you we will inform you when Mr Potter has made contact.”
When the class ended, Draco didn’t linger. Harry started to go after him but was stopped by Hermione holding his robes. “Maybe you should give him some time to process the news. It can’t be easy for him knowing his family’s history and his name will be dragged through the mud again, especially when he is trying to put it all behind him. And all before Christmas too.”
“Alright. Let me look that up for you.” The bartender went to retrieve a large book from next to a weird looking cash register and brought it back to them. “What date were you looking at?”
“You were saying, Mr Potter?” Snape said.
Harry knew he would never truly understand Draco’s past and most of the time he wasn’t keen on delving into it, but he knew a lot of the negative things would be brought up in the trial. He wondered if that might undo the small friendship he had began to build with Draco and his small hope for more.
“No--” He was going to add a ‘but’, however McGonagall cut him off.
“Hate to say you are wrong. I know as much as you,” Hermione said pointedly.
Draco turned to find Potter standing in the doorway. He was dressed in a grey suit, which Draco was sure had been tailored, featuring a black shirt with a deep-red tie. He briefly wondered if Potter had dressed himself or whether he’d had someone else pick out the ensemble.It made him look more handsome than Draco would have thought possible.
“What’s so different about it that you can’t tell me?”
“What? No. Why would you think that?”
"Err… nothing."
“You’re welcome.” Draco gave him a smirk back.
"I...err...saw the article in the Prophet this morning."
“Good. The potion has kicked in. Think you could get out of bed?”
stories.  Organising this Christmas party for them was a chance to strengthen those relationships and at the same time impress his boss. Maybe he would even get more field work out of it.
“You’d better.” He replied coldly, before turning on his heel and storming out.
“Mmm.”
Draco moved his hand over Harry’s growing bulge. “Might need to remind yourself while you’re at it.”
Draco shrugged. “I don't know, Potter. I didn’t hear much wrong with that song.”
“Not the faintest. Though I didn’t get that good a look at him.”
As he arrived outside Draco’s classroom, a line of first year Ravenclaws and Slytherins streamed out of the door. Most walked past without even sparing him a glance, some started whispering to each other and a couple of girls waved at him then giggled when he waved back.
They didn't speak much once Draco had successfully booked the room for the party. They both sipped at their wine and Draco concentrated on the papers in front of him with all his party plans. He looked over the notes regarding decorations and a few names of songs Harry had played that he’d rather liked. He wrote more things on his to-do list and worked out a schedule for the rest of the week.
They looked into each other's eyes and for a moment all was quiet. Then the doorknob creaked, loudly. Draco's attention snapped to the door. He could see the knob slowly turning.
When class ended, Harry shoved his books and the list into his bag with enough time to follow Draco out the door. "Hey Malfoy...err, Draco?" Harry said from behind the blonde.
Harry watched as the tea sommelier finished making Draco’s tea and without thinking, he got up and went to the counter. “Excuse me, would you mind if I served this to the man at the window for you?”
“What I should have done weeks ago. Finding out what our friendship really means to you. You’ve been egging all the idiots and rumours on for months, do you really think I am just going to keep putting up with it?”
“Do you think Malkin did know when the owls would be sent and deliberately planned to be away?”
“Got a pen or a quill?” Harry asked after a few seconds.
They spent the next hour going over all the events Harry had listed during class and evaluating their worth as evidence. It was agreed that the strongest evidence Harry could give was when Draco saved his life by lying to his Father about not knowing if it was truly Harry under the welts from the stinging jinx when he had been captured by the snatchers and taken to Malfoy Manor.
“Anything else noteworthy?” Draco asked as he dug into his breakfast.
“Ready?” Harry asked.
"Albus is coming over to our place tomorrow. Did you want to join us?" Draco asked, eyes focused on Harry's forearm, like it wasn't a big deal. Harry must have hesitated a bit too long because Draco continued. "You don't have to. I just thought it might be nice for you to see how they interact. I swear they remind me of you and Ron sometimes. Makes me wonder what life would have been like if you had accepted my offer of friendship back at Hogwarts."
The look, more than the words, told Draco not to push the matter and that he was unlikely to be able to pry any information from Harry’s lips. But it didn't prohibit him from trying. “That doesn’t usually stop you.”
“Isn’t there someone else that can go?”
“Would you prefer it if I left the room?”
Potter was dressed in similar attire to Draco’s; long black coat, dark denim jeans, dark grey woolen gloves and a burgundy scarf with a matching beanie covering his usual mess of black hair.
“Surely there is someone else who would be able to use a computer,” Harry said.
It felt like deja vu to Harry as well. He was standing in front of Draco with hives covering his face and much of his body. He’d been hit with a hive jinx chasing the same dark wizard that had hit him with the jelly leg jinx and burned his legs.
Harry gave a wave with his red-gloved hand then walked away from him. Draco walked in the opposite direction until he found an alley he could Disapparate from.
pathetic.”
“Lead the way,” Harry said, voice still whisper quiet.
“The fish,” Harry replied.
“Seriously?” Harry didn't look particularly pleased with the idea, but Draco knew that would change soon enough.
“Hmmm, definitely doesn’t.” Draco was a little shocked they were agreeing on something. He looked back down at the parchment. “What’s today’s date?”
“I haven’t received any correspondence regarding Harry like I requested and I want to know what’s going on,” Draco demanded.
Who's naughty or nice
“Come now, Potter. Not everything is about money.”
“Oh wait.” Harry retrieved a wad of Muggle money from his coat pocket. He counted some out and handed it to Draco. “Give them this when they ask for the deposit.”
“Oh, right.”
A month went by and they returned to doing homework in the library together. As it got closer to exams, Hermione started to join them for extra study and dragged Ron along with her.
“Yeah, I guess you have a point there.”
“Apparently,” Harry shrugged.
“Don’t you think Draco knows that? Lucius is still his father though.”
It wasn’t until their third year, when the hormones really started to kick in, that Draco had to fight his body for control when Harry was around. The Dark Lord’s rise the following year had definitely put a dampener on his attraction though.
Harry noted Draco was doing a little better than he was with the task at hand, although the colours of Draco's mop were a bit off compared to the one the Professor had demonstrated. The handle of Draco’s mop was a pale wood and the mop head was jet black, while the Professor’s example was warm brown. It would seem he was on Draco's mind too.
“All done,” Draco said. “So, where are we going to dinner?”
“Ron doesn’t really understand it either. Hermione knows why and she tries not to push.” Harry sighed again and rested his head on Draco’s left shoulder. “She said I was the highest qualified Auror capable of doing the job.”
“Honestly Malfoy, why would I do that?”
"I'm not sure it's that clear cut," Harry said, eyes scanning the Slytherin table on the other side of the room, trying to find Draco to see if he had received the news yet.
“You’re welcome, Mr Potter. I just ask that you inform me when you’re finished.” She picked up the parchment she’d been reading from and made her way out the door.
“Good, let’s go.” Harry stood and took a step towards Ron as he got to his feet too. “See if you can get a good look at the guy with Malfoy on the way out too,” Harry whispered. “I want to try and use our memories to see if we can get an ID on him.”
His owl returned the following morning with Hermione’s response.
It took a few different gestures and incantations but it wasn't long before his legs went limp. Harry proceeded to lay back on the bed, suddenly exhausted after a couple of hours of wobbling legs. "Thank Merlin," he exclaimed.
Harry looked over to Draco’s table and saw the blonde peeking over the other wizard’s shoulder at him again. Harry was sure it helped that the other man was a few inches shorter than Draco. A smirk developed on Draco’s face then he ducked his head back behind the short wizard.
are not going anywhere.” Harry said.
While walking from Charms to Potions on the second afternoon back, Harry was quick to put a stop to the chants of ‘Death Eater’ as Draco passed by some third years. Ron even backed him up, though Harry suspected he did so under Hermione’s orders.
Draco waited for her to continue, but she didn’t. “With Harry?” he asked.
the Leaky Caldron, as opposed to in it as they usually might.
“Done. You may continue decorating.”
They turned left twice before they reached the first pub on Draco’s list. He pushed open the door and made his way to the bar. Harry followed his lead. Draco caught the bartender’s attention and removed his gloves and scarf while they waited for the bartender to make his way over.
Amelia let Draco and Harry walk into the room first. It was certainly large enough to comfortably hold the fifty or so people who would be attending the party. There were chairs and tables stacked all along the right wall and an undecorated Christmas tree stood in the far left corner. The floor was covered with a dark grey carpet and the walls were painted an off-white with a dark wooden skirting.
Draco didn’t think he had done that badly, but Potter had a point about their limited time.  He pulled out the parchment from his pocket and held it in front of Potter.
“What? From St Mungo’s kitchens? I don’t think so.”
Harry took the glass and drank the blue liquid. "That should do."
“Look, if you don’t want to, it’s fine. I just thought it would be nice--”
“I cherish the dull moments when I can get them.”
Draco remembered Harry’s present in his pocket from the previous night. He grabbed his wand from the bedside table and summoned it from the pile of clothes at the foot of their bed. He restored it to its regular size and handed the purple parcel to Harry.
“Well…” Harry said, still not looking at him. “I can't say I would object.”
“Stop exaggerating, Malfoy. It hasn’t been that many.”
The healer showed Harry to the waiting area and told him she would send Draco his way as soon as his break started. He only had to wait forty-five minutes before Draco appeared in the waiting room.
“No, no. I meant… I’ll shout you lunch?” Draco just raised his eyebrow at Harry. “It’s the least I can do given how much time you’ve spent healing me in the last few months.” Harry hoped it was a good enough cover and maybe Draco might just decline and they could forget it even happened.
“Draco.” There was the second warning not to push it.
"What were you doing to piss off a Doxy so much that it bit you?" Draco half laughed as he handed Harry a glass containing the antidote to Doxy venom.
Draco stared at the buds in Harry's hand, then into Harry's face and back to the buds. “You'll need to get used to hearing them. You'll hear them at the party anyway.”
Draco thought back to breakfast. “This doesn’t have anything to do with whatever you found interesting in the Prophet this morning, does it?”
Cradling mugs of strong tea, they found their way back onto the couch. This time, both men were sitting facing each other, backs against the armrests and legs stretched out and intertwined. Draco sipped his tea.
assignment and she wasn't going to help me with it.”
“Like you need a free lunch, Potter,” Draco scoffed.
“Doesn’t mean it gets brought here straight way. There is a reason this is a stakeout and not a straightforward raid.”
“...Thanks once again for a wonderful year and I look forward to the one to come. Now please enjoy a taste for the fireworks that will help us bring in the New Year.”
“And I doubt you have any prior engagements. Did I mention we only have a week? Be thankful it’s not dawn.” Draco walked out of the Auror Office before Potter could protest any more.
