"Thank you, Harry." Draco gave him a quick kiss that made him grin from ear to ear.
"Okay, do you want to meet us at Smithy's in about 30 minutes? Do you know where Smithy's is?"
"You can have a seat." Draco gestured to the bar stool while he went to the cupboard and grabbed some glasses then pulled the wine off the wine rack. He poured it the gave Harry a glass.
Draco gave harry a shove and then they cleaned up breakfast and got ready. Soon they were out the door heading to the arcade.
"So why did I need a tux?" Draco asked as he sat down at the other end of the couch harry was sitting on.
The 3 death eaters still standing walked towards him and surrounded him.
"You have no idea how happy you just made me. How's 3 o'clock tomorrow?"
"Guess you really can't die." There was no malice in his voice, but his word cut into me, as I remembered how badly I didn't want to wake up. My chest tightened, and I fell back onto my bed and curled into the fetal position. Tears were pouring from my face again and I couldn't breathe, but then I felt warmth surround me. Strong arms were pulling me tight against a firm chest, close enough I could feel his heart beat, and for the first time in months I felt comfortable. I was still suffocating but I could feel air being pull into my lungs one tiny breath at a time.
"Draco can I asked you something? You don't have to answer if it makes you uncomfortable."
"Such a nice way to say good morning." I smiled into the nape of his neck and could feel him smiling against my head.
After a little bit of a longer break the tingling started again and Draco was now using his tongue and fondling his balls.
"Well after my father went to Azkaban, all our money was locked away and I didn't want to live on mother's money since she didn't have as much as father, so I needed a job. I decided to do what I was good at and I make very good money for it." Draco smiled.
"Nothing. Its just... you make me so happy." Draco whispered against Harry's head.
"M-Malfoy?" Harry asked. The man stood and removed his mask to reveal it was, indeed, Draco Malfoy.
Draco's POV
"If I was just 30 minutes earlier..." I sobbed. Ron shushed me and pulled me close to him.
Draco fell to his knees and cried. He didn't understand why Harry had to be taken away from him just when they'd connected. He cried for about 10 minutes then he pulled himself together, got dressed, and headed to St. Mungo's.
"Good morning." Draco smiled. He was so happy to be waking up in Harry's arms.
"Harry, bloody, Potter?" The man Infront of him said, "You've got to be joking? Harry, bloody, Potter is shagging my husband!?"
Once I could feel him against my hips I stop and waited for him to adjust to my size.
"What's so funny?" Draco smiled.
"Oh? What is it?" Draco took a sip of wine.
"Same for me." Draco smiled as he plated the bacon and eggs. He sat the plates down on the table and they began to eat.
"How in Merlin’s beard did you get here?!" Harry exclaimed calmly so he wouldn't scare the cat the was now purring in his arms.
Harry followed him in unable to take his eyes off Draco's naked torso. "I just got to say, I find you so attractive right now."
"Aunt Andromeda and Teddy." I felt my stomach turn.
"Tonight, I'm going to test your endurance. Your job is to not orgasm unless told you can. Any questions?" Draco asked.
"Draco, I love you, with all my heart. You and Scorpius and Teddy, you're my family, and I’m going to protect each one of you." Harry said as he wiped Draco's tears away.
"H-harry if you k-keep this up, I'm not going to be able to stop myself." I pulled him in for another searing kiss pushing myself hard against him, just to make him moan.
When Harry woke up Draco wasn’t in bed with him. He heard the shower running so he laid back and waited for his lover to emerge.
"He's one of our highest paying customers and you'll only spend twelve hours with him." Miguel continued to talk. "Oh, and Draco, Dress high class muggle. I'll text you the address." as he hung up and owl flew in through dracos open window and dropped a small packet of papers. He picked it up and read through it. It was mostly things like not telling anyone including friends, family, and especially the press who he was with, so he signed them then went to take a shower.
"Really?!" Harry's smiles grew even more.
Harry pulled his fingers out, popped Draco's member out of his mouth, pulled off his boxers and lubes up his cock as quickly as he could.
Somehow, I knew immediately who she was talking about and I felt the air leave my lungs, "How?" I asked after inhaling deeply. She looked as if she was fighting not to break down again, so Pansy started rubbing little circles on her back.
"Well remember how you asked me who that man was?"
Draco sat back with a smirk on his face admiring the look on Harry's face.
"Mm you missed." Draco said as he stole a kiss from Harry.
"It's already an hour past your bedtime. Get going mister." Draco said pointing up the stairs.
Draco made it a point to look Harry in the eye and took his hand, "Yes it does."
I felt hands on my shoulders and opened my eyes one last time. I could see a blurry vision of Hermione's face. She was yelling something, but I couldn't hear a thing. I could feel a blissful smile on my face as I whispered, "You're early." And finally slipped into a beautiful unconsciousness.
The waitress brought Harry his food and he tucked in.
"We'll start with spanking, and if I think you deserve something more, I will tell you first." Draco said. "Any other questions?"
"Who said I didn't want to do this? This has been one of my biggest fantasies since school." Draco whispered in Harry's ear. Harry could feel his breath on his neck and he was amazed at how hard he already was. "Do you want this?" Draco asked.
"So, when you said I was cute you meant that?" Draco was fully red now.
"It's okay. It's all over now." Harry smiled and patted Draco's hands. "So, did you date anyone before this?"
"When your crush follows your page. #weseeyou"
"Yes master." Harry said as he turned and bent down so Draco could have a good view of his arse. Draco had to bite his lip to keep from doing anything to rash. Luckily Harry was turned around so he couldn't see it.
"I guess, but I’m going to be awfully sad about it." Harry sighed and pretended to be sad. Draco giggled and gave him a shove which made Harry laugh.
"You have to get up!" He continued to yell.
"Draco, of course you deserved to live. You didn't want any of the life forced upon you. You didn't choose any of it, and when you were able to choose you chose to help people. You are a great man, Draco, and I could never regret saving your life." He cupped Draco's face and held it, so their eyes would meet. They were so blue right now and they seemed to beckon him. Without another thought he closed the distance and placed his lips gently on Draco's. He felt Draco's breath hitch and his eye lashes flutter close as he kissed back. It was probably the gentlest, yet passionate kiss either of them had shared, and when they pulled away, they were both incredibly out of breath with hearts pounding so hard they might burst out of their chests.
"I'll need his wand back as well. I assume you have it." Harry said calmly. Miguel slowly reached into a drawer, pulled out the wand and handed it to Harry.
They apparated home and immediately Draco fell to his knees crying. "How could this happen? Is this the world getting back at me for everything I've done?" He sobbed.
"Harry!" Teddy yelled as he came through the fire place. Andromeda followed with a scowl on her face.
"That sounds like so much fun! What’s laser tag." Draco laughed.
I'm sorry I didn't wake you up when I left. I'm not good at saying goodbye. I already can't wait to see you again. I'll just come straight here when I get home late on Tuesday. I hope you'll wait up for me. If not that's okay. I'll also call you whenever I get the chance. There's just one thing I need to say to you, Draco. I love you with all my heart, and I always will. I wish I could have said it in person, but like I said I'm bad at goodbyes.
"Hey all I said is I liked his ass. don't take it that far, but get this! He tells his son stories about me and he called me by my first name. Not just that I made him blush! Maybe he's gay for me." Harry laughed.
Draco rolled his eyes and went to walk away.
Harry laid down on the bed watching Draco's every movement. Draco got up out of his chair and started undoing the rest of the buttons on his shirt. He slid it off then looped his fingers in his trousers and pants and slipped them off as well. Harry couldn't remove his eyes from Draco's naked form. He was so tall and lean that it made Harry's mouth water and his cock twitch. Draco approached the bed and flicked his wand. Harry was flipped over, the restraints magically wrapped themselves around his wrists and ankles, and the wedge was placed under his hips, so his ass was in the air. Draco whispered another spell and a silver band appeared tightly around Harry's cock.
There was still one visitor I had been expecting, but he was taking his time, which was okay, because I knew it would be as hard for him as it would be for harry. The day the visit came was unexpected. Harry was relaxing in his room and I was preparing dinner, when there was a quiet knock on the door. I opened it revealing the tall slender red headed boy.
"So, don't stop." I said against his lips.
Before he could say another word, I flipped us over again and discarded my shirt. His eyes were watching my every move hungrily. He ran his hand up my torso "merlin, You're so beautiful." His fingers wrapped in my hair and he pulled me down to his lips again as I undid the buttons on his silk shirt. Once I had slipped it off, I let my lips draw a line down his jaw and neck till I reached his chest. My eyes finally caught a glimpse of the scars I had caused, and I looked up at him in silent apology. He gently raked a hand through my hair.
"Ginny, I'm so sorry. I kind of hired him." Harry said quietly.
"You're in the hospital, love." Harry replied.
"I love you, Draco. And I'm willing to take that risk." Harry tilted Draco’s face and kissed his lips.
"I'm going to cum!" Draco shouted. Harry stopped him and pulled him out of his mouth but didn't stop working him hard with his hands. "Oh, my fuck! Harry if you don't stop, I'm going to cum all over your face!" Draco gripped the sheets tight. He found the thought of covering Harry's face sexy but wasn't sure if that's what Harry wanted so he tried to stop himself.
warning- smut
"That's perfect, so you guys are going out then?" Pansy asked.
"No, it’s because you broke my sons jaw and nearly killed me!" Draco whispered angrily.
A gentle tap on my bedroom door brought my attention away from my book. I smiled expecting Draco, "Coooooome in." I said in a sing-song voice. My smile vanished as face that haunted some of my worst nightmares came in. "G-George?" I said sitting up in bed.
After about 20 minutes Draco finally calmed down, did his paperwork, and went home. He then called his mother and asked her if Scorpius could spend the night. He needed some alone time with Harry.  She agreed of course.
"What can I say? I have a way with words." Harry laughed.
"Well that’s one way to get you to touch my butt." Harry laughed as he stirred the pots on the stove.
"I told you I'd come back to you." Harry said kissing Draco's head.
A large man walked into the room and began to undress. He wasn't very built but not fat either. His body was covered in scars and Draco could smell the booze on him from across the room.
"What are we?" He blinked a couple of time and sat his book down. I sat up, so I could see his face better.
"Why?" Harry laughed shaking his head as he finished getting undressed.
"You can't die. You promised you'd come back to me." He whispered. A nurse walked in and started checking his vitals.
"I love you too, Draco. With all my heart." Harry squeezed Draco tightly, not wanting to let him go.
"Are you sure you want this, baby?" He asked teasing Draco's hole with the tip of his dick.
"Draco it's two in the morning." Pansy answered drowsily.
"Yeah, hey Potter." Draco said rubbing the back of his neck.
"Yeah." Harry blushed and chuckled.
"What did you do to my cock, master?" Harry asked.
"And what if I did?" Harry said trying to flirt back.
"No, no I like when you call me Harry. does that mean I can call you Draco?" Harry asked as they both sat down in the booth Scorpius had picked.
"Yeah, trust me, we are far better on our own then with him." Draco gave Harry a sad smile.
"I grabbed my stuff, so if you want me to stay again I can." He said wrapping his arms around Draco's waist.
"What was that?" The bartender asked. Draco continued to press the butting making it difficult for Harry to think.
Draco buried his face into Harry's chest and began to hyperventilate. "Shh, Draco, you can stop if you need to."
Draco looked down with a sad expression that made Harry's smile fade.
Draco came up behind and put his hands in Harry’s back pockets while his kissed his neck and whispered in his ear, "If you wanted me too you just had to ask." Harry Moaned and pushed against him to feel as much as he could of Draco’s body.
"Yes, baby?"
"I can't think of anything that would make me happier." Harry smiled.
"Harry! Wake up! I'm here!" I yelled as I shook him. He awoke startled and I was flung hard against the wall by his magic. I shook my head trying to shake away my dizziness and focus on harry. I refused to black out even though I could feel a small trickle of blood down the back of my neck.
"Oh god yeah! Keep doing that!" Draco moaned. His thrusts started getting sloppier. "Harry, I'm going to cum! Cum with me!" He screamed as he unloaded into Harry and Harry did the same all over the two of them.
"Ok!" Both Scorpius and Teddy exclaimed, as Scorpius led Teddy out back.
"Nothing, your just such a dirty boy." I said before pulling him in for a deep kiss letting our tongues dance again while I slicked up my cock and pressed its head against his entrance.
"Fiiiiine, but is going to be the best damn dessert you ever had." Draco said as harry turned around and wrapped his arms around his neck.
"How'd you get away?" Harry asked.
"Hi Draco. What to come in?" Harry asked moving to the side. Draco nodded and walked in.
"I can do that." Harry smiled without thinking about it.
"He doesn't see that as enough. All he sees is the fact you were almost part of the blood shed and directly by his hand. He also regrets not reaching out to you. He thinks he could have done so much more to save you from the torment you endured, if he hadn't been so intent on being your mortal enemy."
"Good I want to see you cum all over us." Harry whispered in his ear as he pounded harder.
"Harry?!" As soon as he spoke the door closed in his face but quickly reopened as a hand pulled him inside.
"If he wants to."
"Is it true you killed a basswisk?" an excited Scorpius.
"You are making this so difficult you know?" He smiled as they got into bed and Draco curled up in his arms.
"Yeah."
"I said no!" Draco said loud enough to make a couple nurses look over.
"Harry!" Scorpius yelled as Harry came through the fireplace first. Draco smiled up from his book, but Harry notice his eyes seemed off. Scorpius got up to give Harry a hug but stopped when he saw Teddy come through the fireplace too. "Who's this Harry?"
Unexpectedly to Harry, Draco moved and straddled his lap. He was too afraid to scare Draco off so he kept his hands on Draco's sides. Draco ever so slightly tightened his grip on Harry's which caused Harry to moan. Harry's moan made Draco lose control for a minute. Their kiss morphed from sweet to something more sexual and hungrier. Draco's tongue managed to find its way into Harry's mouth and Harry let him have dominance. Harry's hand slid its way down to Draco's arse and pulled him in closer so almost every part of them were touching.
"Hey they said everyone who's anyone will be here! I'll know. I've been staring at that ass for years!" Hermione just shook her head, "It'll be like Cinder-fucking-Ella, but with an ass." Ron and Hermione broke out in a laughing fit.
Harry turned around and wrapped his arms around Draco, "Oh, I'm sexy now, am I? Since when." Harry laughed.
"Hi baby." He said.
they began to throb and pulsate, so he touched them again. It felt so good to touch them, but it wasn't enough. he needed more. He started thinking of harry again. How good his new tentacles would feel against his skin, in his mouth, or in that tight little ass. He couldn't take it anymore, so he quickly got undressed and snuck into Harry's room
"Have a good night... Draco." Harry winked. Draco just shook his head again and left. Harry stared at his ass as he did. when he was far enough away that you couldn't tell who he was, Hermione and Ron showed up.
"Its ok love."
"I guess it's because you're so sexy." Draco joked even though there was quite a bit of truth in that statement.
"I'm not entirely sure. I blacked out for a moment then I remember apparating both scorp and myself to the manor. Mother helped fix us up. Father was furious, I’m surprised Ommin is still alive." He began to sob again, "I don't understand how he got out."
"I couldn't have done it without my angel." I said pecking his lips.
"Harry, please, relax. Breathe, please." He said stroking my back, "I'm not going to let them." My eyes grew wide. "I've managed to call in some favors and make it, so you can come stay with me, until I'm sure you're better." I blinked trying to take in the information. I had a horrible realization.
"I'll see you next Saturday." Harry said after Draco pulled away.
Tears swelled in Harry's eyes, "me too, Draco."
"Well that's one way to meet up." Harry said as he stood and held out his hand to help Draco up.
"What are my punishments?" Harry asked.
Draco froze and turned around; his eyes widen in shock. Harry saw him mouth the word "Potter?" Before turning and running to the bathroom.
Once there he immediately slipped his shoes off and crawled under the covers, curling up completely under the duvet.
"He found me at work, today." Draco cried. Harry was furious but he did his best to hide it so he wouldn't scare Draco. He took Draco into his arms and stroked his hair.
"Don't fucking lie to me! I know that was Draco!" Ginny yelled. Harry was shocked and just sat there with his mouth open.
"It's been hard, but we're making do." Draco replied vaguely.
Hermione,
"Yes, master." Draco walked over to the dresser and opened the drawer. Harry couldn't tell what he pulled out but it was a few things. He walked back to where Harry was bent over the bed.
He gazed at Harry's sleeping form in the moonlight. He was so beautiful, Draco Had to have him. He slowly and carefully slipping into bed behind him trying hard not to touch him fully just yet. He started kissing and sucking Harry's neck.
"Well I like Harry! He's cool!" Scorp said.
For my big boy. I'll always miss you griffin. You meant the world to me. I love you so much and I always will. RIP my big boy.
"Griffin! You pain in the ass. What were you thinking? I was scared shitless!" Draco said as he rushed over and scooped the fat cat up. Griffin nudged his cheek. "Thank you so much for messaging me. I was so scared that I lost him for good."
"Well his father was very tough on us when he was young, so he never got the love he deserved growing up. It's my biggest regret. Then there was his late wife, that was an arranged marriage, so I don’t think they ever truly loved each other. And, of course, there was his ex-husband. He...well Draco should tell you about that when he's ready." Her face went from smiling to sad quickly. Harry was curious but he decided it was something he should bring up when Draco seemed comfortable with it. "Anyways his address is 454 Hillshire Ave. Good luck! I hope he agrees." She said perking up a bit.
Draco returned right away "what!?"
"Harry?!" Draco cried as he took Harry into his arms.
"Are you sure you're ok?" Draco asked with soft eyes and a dash of a smile.
They messed around at the arcade almost all day. Harry taught Draco how to play laser tag which he turned out to be excellent at, he also won Draco a green stuffed snake. Soon they had played every game and were ready for dinner.
"Draco would you be my boyfriend?" Harry smiled.
A tear almost left Harry's eye, "Thank you, Draco."
Harry and he two fellow Aurors had just followed a couple of the death eaters they were after to an abandoned mansion. Not thinking about there being more death eaters inside Harry told his two companions to go around back while he pinned them down in the front. Harry had made a mistake.
"That sounds lovely." Draco said as he yawned and fell asleep in Harry's arms. Harry kissed his forehead then picked him up and carried him to his room.
"I'm glad you did." Harry squeezed Draco's hand and Draco smiled.
"That's fucked up."
"I Don't deserve you!" Draco cried and fell into Harrys arms.
"I like Harry, I wish he was my daddy too." Scorpius said as he drifted off to sleep.
"I'll be f... sssss" Harry hissed as he stood and nearly fell to the floor. He didn't realize how sore he was.
"Me too." I said before kissing him passionately. I trailed my hand down his side and cupped his perfect arse through the thin silk of his pajamas, and he let out a moan. I took the opportunity to flick my tongue inside his mouth and he met me half way. Our tongues seem to dance together elegantly, and I could feel myself twitch in my pants.
" Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?" Harry asked. Draco just nodded again. So, Harry sat on the edge of the bed and gently stroked Draco's back until he fell asleep. Then he flooed back to his house.
When the time came to leave, he told Ginny he was going out with some coworkers and apparated to a wizard pub, where he cast a glamour that changed his face shape, hid his scar, and made his hair reddish brown. Then he apparated to the night club.
"Extra forms?"
"Please master." Harry sobbed.
Draco sat in his high back chair wearing black slacks and a white button up with the top bottoms undone.
"How so?" harry asked.
"I really wanted to talk to you." Harry smiles a little more normally when he saw Draco had a little bit of a smile on his face.
"With all my heart." I said pushing my forehead against his and meeting his gaze, so he could see I really did mean every word I said. He pulled me in for another kiss. This one slower and more loving.
Harry and Draco have a talk and Draco agrees to give Harry a try.
"Couldn't help it. That ass has me enchanted." Harry said being very straight forward.
"You said you'd come back to me." Draco said.
God there was something about his laugh that made my heart pound in my chest. I picked my head up and stared at his face still chuckling with a big, amazing, toothy grin. I couldn't control my actions anymore and brought my hand up to stroke his cheek. I watched as his smile faded, a very brief look of surprise washed over him before he let out a loud exhale, which I could have sworn I head a faint moan, as he melted into my hand.
After fighting over the bill with Harry won and paid for it, they apparated to Harry and Ginny's flat. Draco had his arm around Harry the whole time holding, holding him up.
"Potter, what have you done?" He said, shock filling his monotone voice.
"Oh... fuck... Harry... so good!" Draco yelled in pleasure barley able to put words together.
Draco got super close and with a serious look in his eye that Harry found insanely sexy, so much so that he was hard again, Draco whispered, "Dear, after the orgasm you just gave me my stomach couldn't handle any food."
Harry was just as confused. He found himself strangely attracted to the tall blond. He had never been attracted to a man before, but Draco intrigued him more than anybody.
"I can't wait!" Draco said kissing his knuckles. Harry smiled, "Bye, Harry."
That smile killed harry inside. Knowing how bad this poor man in front of him must have felt after everything, made his heart break. He never deserved that. He couldn't choose his family. He hadn't realized his hand had moved from its position, and was now stroking Draco's cheek, till he felt Draco melt into his touch.
Draco was having a pretty good day at work till close to the end of his shift. He was walking down the halls of St. Mungo's getting ready to file his paperwork for the day when he heard a familiar voice come for the nurse's station.
"Oh, gods Harry give me more!" Draco whined. Harry inserted another finger and began scissoring them, stretching Draco's hole.
"Draco, I have an important client for you." Miguel's thick Spanish accent spoke.
"I am being quiet. It’s your loudmouth that's going to get us in trouble." Harry said as they rounded the corner, Draco taking the lead. As they came into a large room Draco heard something on their tail and instinctively pushed harry behind him taking an unfamiliar spell to the chest. Harry fired away knocking the assailant into an unsteady wall. He then picked Draco up and apparated to St. Mungo’s.
"Of course, love. Do you want me to sleep on the couch?" He kissed Draco's head.
That late afternoon Harry was pacing in his living room. He really wanted to ask Draco out, but he didn't know how. Heck, he didn't even know how to reach him. Then he had an idea. Possibly a bad idea, but an idea, nonetheless.
"Please never call me that again."
"You're so sexy." Harry whispered as he crawled on top of Draco and started kissing and biting his neck.
"Well I was thinking of taking you to dinner, but I kind of don't want you to get dressed up. So, what if I go get some groceries and I cook you something?" Harry suggested.
"I'm afraid that's up to him." She said sadly.
"Really?" Draco asked as he wrapped his fingers in Harry's hair.
"I know! I've never lusted after anyone before, but you have me on my knees." Harry said.
"Who?"
I spent the next three hours playing with teddy while Draco and Andromeda caught up. I was happy to see he now had blood relatives he could trust, but that didn't make me near as happy as realizing just how much Teddy loved me. I never realized how much he looked up to me. I was his only father figure, and that awoke a sense of purpose in me.
Draco turned and set his glass down, "So you've come to me for what exactly, experimentation?"
"I think Harry loves you!" Scorpius said excitedly.
"I've never made love to anyone."  Draco said placing his forehead against Harry's.
"Yeah... I’ve made a decision."
"Wow he likes you. He usually takes a while to warm up to people." Draco said patting griffins head.
"Are you sure you're ready to walk you look pretty worn out and you might be sore?" Draco was concerned.
Draco smiled "Shut up and kiss me, you git."
"Harry's back in my life."
"Look, I'm leaving in two days to go on a dangerous mission and I just can’t think straight knowing we might be missing our chance to be together. Seeing you again has stirred up so many emotions I haven't felt in so long. I care about you so much Draco, and I have for such a long time. I want you in my life. Please take me on." Harry blurted out. Draco stood in silence, not sure what to say. His heart was pounding so fast and he couldn't think. He wanted so badly to say yes but he couldn't break his promise. Could he?
Draco paced back and forth in his room for a while trying to decide what to say. When he thought he'd thought it through enough he finally dialed Harry's number.
Draco lay in bed trying to sort out his thoughts and emotions. Did he love Harry? Had he ever felt love before? His parents never showed him love. It was weak. His wife never loved him. They were force to be together. But this kiss he shared with Harry wasn’t like anything he had ever felt before. It was pure, and he could feel all the emotion Harry had put into it.
"Fuck, Harry! That was amazing! If I didn't have to pay bills, I wouldn't make you pay." Draco said nuzzling Harry's hair.
"Draco?! I'm so happy you did! I haven't stopped thinking about you since Saturday! You're even in my damn dreams!" Harry blushed realizing he may have over shared.
"He would have." Draco felt himself start to cry but he fought it the best he could.
"A-are you sure?" He moaned as I continued to ever so slightly pump my hips.
He slicked up his fingers and gently pressed into Harry's tight hole. He slowly inserted it making Harry groan.
Draco had never been hit on like that. He was taken back.
"Mm I do so hope so!" Harry kissed Draco's cheek.
"Is there a way I can reach him?" Harry asked trying to get more information.
"I'm going to cum!" Harry yelled.
"I think I heard something about that through the grape vine. I think I also heard you came out as gay. Is that true too?" Draco blushed again.
Draco let Harry in and helped him get set up to make dinner.
"My friend just lost their cat." Harry said wiping away the tear.
They left the office with Miguel walking in front of Harry who had his wand stabbing into Miguel’s back so no one would see.
"I want you too." Draco moaned throwing his head back so Harry could nibble at his throat. He slowly slid Harry's shirt off before slipping out of his own as well. They pushed they're naked torsos together and moaned.
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco slowly so he had time to refuse if he wanted. He pulled Draco close then grabbed Draco's ass and pushed their pelvises together so Draco could feel his erection.
"Uh yeah. Look we don't have to do this. I know you probably don't want to." Harry said as he turned to leave. Draco grabbed his arm and swung him around. With one hand lightly on Harry's throat and the other wrapped around his wrist Draco pinned him to the wall.
"Yep, it's probably the only rumor she's spread that's actually true." harry shrugged his shoulders.
Harry
"Yes master. All yours!" Harry moaned and arched his back.
Everything was starting to crush me again. The weight on my shoulders was heavier now than it ever had been. Even though I was raised with that weight, raised to be a war machine, it felt so much heavier now with every lost soul bearing down on me. I'm suffocating in it.
"Bye, Harry." He said, and I followed him out of my room. As he was leaving, he turned to Draco. "You better take care good care of him." He said with a wink and Draco let out a breathy laugh.
"Harry? It's Draco." Draco smiled. He loved sleepy Harry's voice.
"He's at the manor. Mother is watching him for the night. I wanted some alone time with you."
"Take him down stairs." Miguel said to his thugs. They grabbed Draco and drug him out of the room and down a flight of stairs where he was thrown into a small cell. The cell was dark and contained only a small bench and a bucket.
Draco stepped out of the shower, dried off, and put on the spandex shorts. He couldn't stop shaking as he sat on the bed. He had heard rumors of other men that tried to quit and ended up disappearing. He was scared but most of all he was worried he'd never see Harry again.
A short woman with black hair pulled into a pony tail finally walked in "Draco Malfoy?" She asked kind of loud.
"Angel?" He smiled and hummed in response.
Soon the headmistress decided she wasn't going to wait much longer and started to make the announcements and begin the sorting. It wasn't until the last first year had been seated that the doors of the hall were flung open to reveal a broad shouldered, raven-haired man with eyes so green they caught Draco's attention from the opposites side of the room. His stomach began to fill with butterflies, and he felt his breath catch in his throat, as the Man made his way to the Professor's' table
Within second, they were both shaking though their orgasms. Harry collapsed to the bed and whispered a quick cleaning spell.
"I don't think I've ever been kissed that good."
"You mean it?"
"Uh? Friday, I believe." I laughed not knowing what he was talking about.
"You're amazing." Harry whispered as he gave Draco a squeeze.
"Draco, we need to talk." Her voice was hoarse and squeaked a little bit, and I was shocked at the use of my first name.
Harry's eyes widened at him and a goofy smile grew on his face, "what?" Draco asked.
Once there he locked the door then slid to the floor where he wept for a while. He was proud of himself for standing his ground but he was scared Ommin would retaliate. "what if he catches me alone?" He thought to himself.
"I'll take you!" Draco laughed as he caught Harry.
"Fuck yes, I do." Harry said as he took a seat on the couch next to Draco. "So, are you single?"
"Such a nice way to say good morning." I said inhaling his sent.
"There that pompous Malfoy I've missed so much." Harry chuckled.
"Well, it has been awhile." Draco half smiled, "If you saw who I was under this mask you wouldn't find me so sexy. Not many do."
"Mmhmm" Draco hummed I return and curled up into my arms.
"I-I want to see you. All of you. I-I've waited so long..." I push my finger against his lips and gave him a sly smile as I stood from the bed. His eyes widened as I slowly, agonizingly slowly, pulled began to finish undressing. I let my boxes catch on the tip of my cock as I pulled them down and watched as Draco licked his lips.
"I-I love you too. Harry." Harry's eyes met Draco's as he felt his heart flutter. He pushed his lips passionately against Draco's and began to move inside him.
Before leaving work that night he grabbed the files he needed and went home to start studying. He tried his hardest to focus on the information, but his mind was too preoccupied on blond hair and blue eyes. He would do anything to just touch him right now. Finally, he became overwhelmed by the thought, so he grabbed his coat and headed to the bar Hoping Draco would be there.
"You tell stories about me?" Harry laughed.
"H-harry...I... I... think I need a little time to think things over." He gave harry one last sad look and disappeared into the castle.
When I'm not seeing their faces on the streets I'm seeing them in my dreams. Reliving their deaths one after another; Sirius falling into the vale, Dobby pierced by the dagger, Bellatrix's laugh as she murders Tonks, Dolohov taking Remus down without a care, watching the Weasley's cry over Fred's lifeless body, Cedric lying limp in the graveyard, Snape holding his bleeding throat with tears on his cold cheeks. All of them, even the deaths I didn't see, were in perfect view like some terrible film put on display for me every night. Not even drugs helped.
"Ah Mr. Potter, what brings you to my humble abode?" Miguel asks.
Harry's heart broke. He scooped both the child and Draco up into his arms and held them tightly.
"Ooh, The Master huh?" She asked.
"Oh, you heard that?" Draco laughed.
He was waiting for a text describing his next assignment when his phone started ringing. His boss usually never called unless it was something big.
I rolled the parchment up and placed it beside me on the table, then picked up the sleeping pills. I didn't deserve such an easy way out. I'm sure I'll pass out before I feel anything, but it was all I could think of now. They were right here after all. I shook all the pills out into my hand, there had to be at least 60.
"That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me, thank you, Harry." Draco smiled in return.
"Deal, why did you hire a male escort? I thought you were straight and married." Draco asked
"I shouldn't be here." My head kept saying over and over. "It's not fair. So many lives were lost all for 'my cause'. Leaving behind children, parents, loved ones all while I have nothing."
"I'm really not sure. I guess I kind of believe that this is the love I deserve after all I've done." Harry suddenly found the table very interesting.
"Not yet! Take it Harry! Take it like the little slut you are! My little slut!" Draco shouted as he pounded Harry as hard as he could. Hitting his prostate with ever thrust.
"Yes master!" Harry screamed in pleasure.
"harry who is he? Is he an angel?" Teddy whispered in my ear. I watched a Draco choked back his laughter which Andromeda couldn't do.
Draco nodded his head and Harry kissed his forehead.
"Yes, but what's an arcade?" Draco said looking confused.
"Oh potter, there's just so much you don't know about me." I gave him a wink on my way out of the room and giggled as his face went as red as a cherry. "Just so beautiful." I said to myself but loud enough he could hear.
"It's ok." He whispered. I closed my eyes and exhaled, my breath feathered against his skin cause tiny goose bumps to appear. I lean down and kissed his beautifully scared skin. I trailed kissed and licks all the way down it. His breath getting hard with each movement, until I reached them hymn of his pants. I looped my fingers inside and his hips bucked just slightly. I locked up waiting for approval.
It was one of the newest pictures of Griffin and it read; "Guys I really need your help! Griffin got out yesterday and he's nowhere to be found. I'm so afraid for him. He's never been outside his yard and his previous owners had him declawed. If you've seen him please contact me. I can't lose him forever. I love him so much."
"That's Mr. Coventry-Malfoy to you!" Ommin spat. "Where's my husband? I need to see him this instant!"
He pushed they're torsos together and marveled in the way Draco's skin felt against his. He then slowly slid his hand down Draco's side making him shiver then slipped it into Draco's trousers outside his boxers. He cupped Draco's cock and Draco threw his head back and pushed against his hand.
Harry let a tear slide down his cheek before darkness swallowed him.
The next morning Harry awoke to the smell of bacon and coffee. He got out of bed and looked down the hall to the kitchen to see Draco with his back turned, wearing nothing but lounge pants, and cooking at the stove. Harry sneaked into the kitchen and wrapped his arms around him laying his head on Draco's back. He felt Draco's breath hitch at the skin on skin contact.
Harry laughed, "no come in, I'm making us pasta." Harry smiled proudly and lead Draco inside to the kitchen where he had all sorts of pot and pans simmering on the stove. Draco cocked his head to get a better look and Harry’s ass.
He started to cry, just as Miguel walked into the room.
"Yes."
"Come in before you freeze." Harry took his hand and lead him inside. "What's wrong Dray?"
He followed the directions the woman had given him and soon he was standing in front of room 202. He took a moment to compose himself before timidly knocking.
Draco added another finger and started moving them faster, repeatedly hitting Harry's sensitive spot. Harry screamed in pleasure.
"No! Keep going! You feel so good!" Draco yelled as he moved back making Harry push in faster till he was completely inside. Draco had never felt so full. "Oh my god Harry! Fuck me!"
Harry followed not long after that, filling Draco with his seed.  They both collapsed on to the bed, panting.
"So, fucking sexy!" Harry whispered.
"You know I could just sleep on the couch tonight and we can do this tomorrow." Draco called.
"We've done all we can to help him, so we can't blame ourselves, but maybe it's not us he needs. Maybe we're not trying the right things." Ron sounded wiser than ever, for once. We went back to sitting in silence while I thought.
"Nice to meet you too!"
Draco exploded into Harry's hand and his tightening asshole made Harry paint his insides with cum.
"Y-your right. All this time, I'd been thinking about myself. I never stopped to realize how much that little boy needs me." I wrapped him in my arms and wiped away his tears.
"Mm good boy. I want you to ride me." Draco whispered. He added another finger and fucked Harry till he was satisfied.
"Draco please come here baby." Harry said quietly," none of this is your fault baby. You were raped repeatedly. You didn't agree to any of this." Draco curled up into Harry’s arms and bawled into his shoulder.
Without another word Harry crawled into bed next to Draco and wrapped him in his arms.
"Yes, sorry to call you so late, but I needed a favor." Harry said.
"I've been wondering the same thing." I straddled his hips and felt his breath hitch a little.
"This is Mr. Potter. I’d like to schedule my regular." Harry said as coolly as he could muster. Something in his stomach wasn't sitting right.
"Sweetheart? How do you think Lupin and Tonks would feel if you, the person they trusted to watch after they only child, left him?" I spoke softly and gently as not to hurt him. He looked up at me with tears starting to spill down his cheeks.
"I'd love some!" Harry followed Draco out of the office, down the hall, and into a fairly big kitchen.
They walked the block to Emily's Diner.
"Now I want you to pick up your clothes, fold them, and place them on the dresser." Draco liked keeping his room tidy but he also hoped this would give him a moment to compose himself. He was wrong.
This is probably going to be a tear jerker.
A few minutes later he got a response "yeah but this way you make money for it ;)"
"I... can't." Draco looked down at his glass. Too scared to look Harry in the eyes. "I'm sorry Harry."
"On your knees in front of me." Draco ordered.
"No, thank you, Draco." Draco smiled in return.
"Yeah that's what they were... they're gone now. Wait was it a good dream."
"Oh I'm... Malfoy?" He said as he looked up to meet the gaze of the blond hair, blue eyed man. He was absolutely stunned to see the man he had been crushing on for years.
"Yes master." Harry said. He did as he was told. He felt Draco walk up behind him and grab his ass. He rubbed soothing circles for a minute before dropping to his knees. Harry felt a cleaning spell and his cheeks being spread apart, then something warm and wet touch his hole. He dropped his head and let out a loud moan when he realized Draco was eating his ass.
"Woooooooow!" Scorpius went back to his dad, "Daddy can Harry come with us to get ice cream?"
"It's ok. I can talk about it. I'm over it now. I dated Blaise Zambini for a while. A long while actually. Then I found out he had been cheating on me throughout our whole relationship."
"Miguel, I’m here to tell you I'm leaving the company. I refuse to take anymore clients."
"Shh, it’ll be okay. I'm going to figure that out and keep you safe." He cupped Draco's cheek and tilted his face so he could look into his eyes, "Draco I need you to know something and I don't want you to just say it back to me."
"Yes, master." Harry said as he slowly undid his belt and slid it off.
"You don't look fine; you look kind of drunk. Are you sure everything is ok?" Harry picked up the bottle of wine that was sitting next to Draco, "Was this full?" He shook it a little and notice Draco flinched.
"Look if you're going to ridicule me, I’m just going to leave." Draco finally said as he turned to leave, but a hand grabbed his arm.
Draco added another finger. "Beg for it."
"Daddy, do you love Harry?" Scorpius asked when they got in the car.
"Do you have any questions?" Draco whispered against Harry's ear as he leaned down.
Draco POV
Harry types back "well that's kind of what I'm messaging you about."
"Okay, Harry." Draco said finally steadying his breathing.
The doctor called them back an drew his blood and ran a few other tests. Now they just sat there waiting for the results.in Harry could feel Draco shaking so he wrapped his arms around him and kissed his forehead.
"Good boy." Draco smirked. He waved his wand and the bonds released. He sat in his chair again. "Come here Potter." Draco ordered. Harry obeyed and stood before him. "On your knees in front of me." Harry got down on his knees. "You're going to suck my cock." Harry looked nervous. "What's the matter potter? Never sucked a cock before?"
"interesting, not what I expected you would do after school. Are you married?" Harry asked praying to the Gods the answer would be no.
"Okay and what kind of play are you looking for?"
"Of course, I am! I want to be a father someday, maybe I'll get to be a step-father." Draco giggled as they sat down on the couch.
Harry began thrusting in and out, slowly at first but gradually picking up speed. Soon he was pounding into Draco, making him grip the bed sheets. Soon he found Draco's prostate and continuously hit it until Draco was screaming in pleasure.
"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you at work, but I really needed to talk to you."
"Mm, Harry I need more." Draco whispered. Once out of the tub He pulled Draco in for a deep kiss, and walked them into Draco's bedroom. When they reached the bed, he laid Draco down and took a minute to admire his naked form.
He was now sitting by Harry's bed reading out loud to him and holding his hand. Hermione had just left and Draco was taking advantage of the alone time with Harry. He knew it wasn't much but he felt like Harry could hear him, so reading to him made home feel closer. He was so enveloped in the book he hadn't noticed Harry starting to stir.
He found Harry’s prostate and began to pulsate harder against it.
It didn't take him long to get everything for chicken Parmesan, and soon he was knocking on Draco's door again.
Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s cock and whispered a spell Harry had never heard of. A blue light came out of Draco's wand and as soon as it hit a tingling sensation spread along Harry’s shaft to the head of his cock and made Harry arch his back in pleasure. He became a writhing mess on the sheets and after only a few minutes of this he finally shouted, "Draco, I’m going to cum!" Draco stop abruptly.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he did as he was told.
"What do you mean?" Draco said as he took Harry's hand. He could feel himself start to shake at the contact of Harry's skin.
"Surprised?" Draco asked.
"Draco," he whispered. Draco looked up at him afraid for what Harry would say next. "I would never hurt you or Scorpius. You know me. I'm not like that."
"I like when you put me on my knees." Ginny had heard enough so she slammed the front door alerting Harry that she was home. "Damn I got to go. Ginny’s home. I'll see you Saturday. Goodbye Draco." Harry whispered.
Draco started kissing and biting his neck while thrusting his hips forward making Harry a moaning mess.
"I want to be in your sexy mouth." Draco moaned as he looked Harry in the eye.
"Okay love, but I have to be honest something might poke you." He laughed. Draco rolled his eyes but laughed as well.
"Sorry I'm just... Surprised." Harry said pausing to find the right word. Now that Draco was looking back at him his mind was having a hard time organizing his thoughts.
"Oh, I'm sorry." Harry felt horrible for how Happy he was at this answer.
"Yes." I said picking out some clothes for him. Something about doing these little things for him filled me with joy.
"M-Malfoy?" I said. Shocked to see him sitting beside me.
"I think you've earned a reward." Draco smiled and stood from the bed. He slowly and smoothly slipped out of his clothes. Harry licked his lips as Draco removed his boxers revealing his cock. Harry was fully hard again.
"T-thank you." Draco closed his eyes tightly then realizing he wouldn't be able to do this without crying he got up and left without another word.
"Let's go dance!" Hermione exclaimed.
"That's so cool!" Scorpius shouted.
Fluffy Smut
"Harry Potter!? The man from duh stories?!" Draco blushed hard. he didn't want harry to know he talked about him so much.
"Promise me you'll do what makes you happy?" Draco asked.
After walking down one of the halls quite a ways, they came to a set of double doors. The bouncer opened them and Harry stepped inside. Miguel was sitting at a large wooden desk with two gold angel statues behind him. The room was decorated in gold and red with heavy red with gold trim curtains and a red and gold sofa.
"Well after he awakes from his coma, they plan on emitting him into the hospital for a while, probably a long while. We think it would be better if he was with you though." I gave her a puzzled look, "We know you can pull a few strings and get him sent to stay with you. I mean you are one of their top healers."
"Fuck!" Draco said as he grabbed a handful of Harry's hair.
"I needed to talk to you, and I asked your mother. Is Scorpius in bed?" Harry looked even more sheepish.
"My name sounds so good when you say it like that." Harry whispered. He licked the shell of Draco's ear and pulled his legs tighter around him. He then leaned over and grabbed something from the nightstand and went back to kissing Draco. Soon Draco felt a wet finger circling his entrance and let out a loud throaty grown as Harry pushed inside him. It was uncomfortable at first, but he soon found himself wanting more, which Harry gave him in the form of another finger.
"Harry I'm going to cum!" Draco yelled.
"You want it so bad, don't you my little slut?" Draco asked.
"Please master can I have your cock! I need you inside of me!" Harry begged.
"Is something wrong?" Draco asked sadly as he sat up.
"Mm, what are you doing love?" Harry asked.
Draco felt Harry's member hit that sensitive spot inside him and he let out a sharp cry as he arched his back in pleasure.
"Does this mean you and Harry are boyfriends!?" Scorpius asked as he sat in his seat.
"Do I get one too?" Ted chimed in.
"What. The. Fuck. Harry! I'm going to the fucking burrow. Fuck you Harry!" She grabbed her bag and slammed the doors behind her.
"Do you have any questions?" Draco asked.
"I always do after care afterward, to make sure you are okay." Draco said making a point to make sure Harry understood.
Draco's face reddened, and he tried to turn away so harry wouldn't see it, but it was too late.
"I'm very sorry to tell you this, but you HIV positive." The doctor said.
"It a place you go to play games and earn prizes. I think this one also has laser tag."
"D-Draco..." She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing, "He... he nearly died again."
Harry was internally freaking out, but he nodded his agreement and went to Draco's bed side. He put his hand on Draco's arm and in that instance his eyes started to flutter open.
"I haven't been happy for quite a while. You don't even make me cum anymore. I'm sorry Ginny. You just can't satisfy me anymore." Harry realized how harsh he sounded after the words left him.
"Me too! Oh fuck!" Harry said reaching in front of him and stroking Draco's cock in time with his thrusts.
"Yes master." Harry said now looking into Draco's eyes.
Harry moaned and gripped the sheet as Draco pulled his trousers and boxers down just enough to show his ass.
He chuckled again. "I wasn't saying it was a bad thing. In all honestly I'd be perfectly happy waking up with pins and needles shooting through my hand as long as your perfect head it the cause."
"Does that answer your question?" Harry whispered in Draco's ear and bit the lobe. Draco let out a loud moan which went straight to Harry's cock. Harry spun them around and pushed Draco against the wall. He looked Draco in the eye searching for approval which Draco gave in the form of a nod.
"It highly unlikely he'll show up. he has a kid and you have to know the right people, people that hate death eaters, but if he does how will you tell it's him." Hermione asked.
" That makes sense you're very straight forward." Draco Laughed. "I'm guessing you were a Gryffindor?"
"Oh, I mean it, with every bit of my being." He sealed it with a deep, slow kiss.
"Sorry I missed you." Harry said gasping for air with his forehead against Draco's.
"The one you set free!?" Scorpius interrupted.
Draco took out a dragon-hide notebook and wrote down the appointment. "It's a date."  He winked, "I have to head to my next appointment. Will you be ok getting home or do you need me to take you?"
"Draco, I can't hold out much longer." Harry whispered.
"This is Harry Potter. Potter this is my son, Scorpius." Draco said.
"Oh, he should be in his office... Oh wait he's right over there!" He heard one of the nurses say.
"No, we don't. There's nothing to say." Draco replied.
"Oh sorry, I was just thinking about how nice it was for you to cook for me and how I could return the favor." Draco replied as he hopped off the counter and got some plates down from the cupboard.
"Well right now I'm going to take care of you." Harry said as he waves his wand and the bruise magically disappeared. "Now I’m going to go pick up dinner. You go relax, and I'll be back soon."
"I'll take you to him!" Miguel squeaked.
"Harry just try it. I want you to be able to see photos of the kids." Hermione begged. Her and Ron were just getting ready to leave after dinner. "What's so good about Instagram? You can show me pictures through Facebook." Harry said rolling his eyes. "Facebook to crowded with negativity. Instagram is much easier to use for browsing videos and pictures. Please, just get it. You'll like it I promise." She said as she put on her scarf. "Fine, I'll think about it." He gave her a hug and they finished saying their goodbyes then he was left in his quiet empty flat. He laid in bed, browsing YouTube for a while, watching random music videos he'd seen a million times. He started to get bored though, so he decided to give in and check out Instagram. He signed in and immediately found Hermione and Ron's pages. Hermione's was filled with pictures of the kids and random old picture of authors she liked and Ron's was mostly goofy selfies and cars he thought were cool since he couldn't post stuff about quidditch, being a muggle app. Harry continued scrolling for an hour, finding friend and other pages to follow. He was watching a video from Good Mythical Morning's page when something caught his eye. In the friends you may know section was a picture of a sexy blond with beautiful grey eyes, shirtless and holding a giant gold colored tabby cat. He stared at the guy for a while think about how familiar his face was and how sexy he looked. He nearly dropped his phone when he read the name of the page, Draco_Griffin. How did he not recognize his rival?! Worse, how could he find him so damn sexy!? He gathered himself and clicked on the page. There were a few selfies that Harry would be ashamed to admit turned him on a little bit most of the pictures and videos were of this big gold cat. He found the one that was the profile picture and read the text. "I may be sexy, but no one can resist griffin’s sexiness. #lovemyboy." Harry laughed at griffin’s chunkiness, and kept scrolling.
"Oh? What do you do?" Harry took another sip of his wine.
"Yes?" Draco said as he opened the door.
"Surprisingly great. Thank you for staying, love." This was the first time Draco called Harry any sort of pet name and it sent him over the moon.
"Sorry, I really don't have a way with words." Harry said shaking his head.
"Yes, master."
"Maybe a little, but I really just don’t want to let you go tonight." Draco laid his head on Harry's shoulder.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" Harry yelled.
It was almost 4:30 when his phone went off with the text from Miguel. it read "7 o' clock. 12 Grimmauld Place.
"Potter you're awake." A quiet face shook me from my cry's and I sat up trying to find the source.
"Well not exactly." Draco said sadly.
"Male dom or Dominatrix?" Zachary continued to question.
Harry smiled and slowly started moving his hips. Draco started slamming back making Harry fuck him harder and harder. Harry finally gripped his hip in one hand and his shoulder in the other and started pounding him hard.
Harry waited by the window in Draco's room for the nurses to tell him what was wrong. He was really starting to care for the git, even before he took a spell for him. He hoped that meant Draco cared about him too.
Draco was stunned. The way Harry had said his name and the feeling of his warm breath on his neck sent something through his body he never expected, and he could feel his trousers growing tight. He just kept blinking, trying to figure out what he was feeling, so he could shake it away. He decided it would be best if he just made his way back to his room.
"Would you like to try it again without the tentacle part?" Draco laughed.
"Harry!" Draco said surprised. He was sitting in his office doing some sort of writing.
"Now come on. let’s go get dinner. I'm starving!" They then left for the restaurant.
"May we see him?" Ron asked.
"I'm sorry Harry." Draco let himself feel safe for a minute.
"I want you so bad." Harry said rubbing his hard dick against Draco's.
Draco laughed, "No, you're different."
"Can we go to bed?" Draco asked.
"I don't have to get in you know?" Harry whispered in Draco's ear.
"Roll onto your stomach." Draco said as he accioed something Harry didn't quite hear. He did as he was told without saying a word because he was exhausted. He felt a quick cleaning spell the something cool and soothing being tuned onto the stinging flesh of his butt. Draco then laid down next to Harry and pulled him to his chest again.
Harry looked over to see Draco smiling, "I love seeing you smile."
He didn't get any sleep that night. He laid in bed tossing and turning thinking about all the what-ifs. He reread the note over and over again, hoping he'd get a call. He finally gave up on sleep and started cleaning his flat hoping that would get his mind of it. That didn't work so he tried watching TV, then exercising, then reading, but nothing worked.
"Fuck!" He whisper-yelled. He got up and went to the bathroom looking at the clock as he passed it. "6:30" it read. He looked at the empty bed and figured Ginny must have left early to get a little bit of practice in before the team met up. She usually did that when she was angry.
He grabbed a hand full of floo powder, stuck his head in the fireplace and yelled Malfoy Manor. Soon he was seeing a living room with Narcissa And Lucius Malfoy sitting on two chair both looking up from their books.
Then his eyes fluttered open and there was Draco. He had made it. He had survived death again. This time with help from the man he loved. He watched Draco read to him for a few minutes. Admiring the glow to his skin and hair.
"Did that go well?" He asked. I turned and wrapped my arms tightly around his neck.
"Shall we move this to the living room? This is the first time I've met my aunt and cousin." Draco laughed as he led Andromeda to the living room. I began to follow with Teddy still on my hip.
Harry smiled and grabbed his candy bowl. "Well aren't you super..." Harry looked up and saw the little boy's father "Cute."
"Draco? C-could you stay?" I nodded and after removing my shoes crawled into bed next to him. To my surprise he curled up next to me wrapping my arm around him and fell asleep. I soon followed nuzzling my face into his perfect jet-black hair.
"Yes sir." Draco giggled.
"So, tell me why you're following me." The blond said. By his voice alone Harry could tell it was Draco.
Teddy face changed to one of focus as his hair went from turquoise to red then to violet then to platinum blond like Scorpius's and Draco's.
"Uh hi Harry." Harry had never seen Draco look so disheveled and unlike Draco. His hair was a mess he was wear muggle jeans and a t-shirt and he spoke so quiet.
Harry lifted Draco’s face so he could look I'm in the eye. "Everything's going to be alright, my love. We'll get through this."
"No, no, no, no, no." I repeated, "I'm not supposed to be here."
" I'm sorry sir that escort has been demoted." Miguel said as a cruel smile curled on his face.
"Come in." Draco's voice made Harry's cock raise immediately. Harry opened the door and stepped inside, closing it behind him.
"Draco, you’re ready. You're back on your feet and the Blaise thing was years ago. Things with Harry will be completely different. I don't think Harry's the cheating type like Blaise was. Besides, if he has wanted you like you wanted him for as long as he says, he's going to do everything he can to keep you." Pansy said comfortingly.
"It's not fair that you've cum twice and I haven't even been touched." He gently grabbed Harry's face, " suck." He ordered.
"You want my cock?" Draco asked. Harry's cock ached and was dripping pre-cum.
"No, it's just... well it's hard to explain. Goodbye Harry." Draco said as he took his son’s hand.
He pushed his chest against Harry’s back and whispered in his ear, "I'm taking you." He felt Harry shake and moan, so he flipped him over and crawled between his legs.  He spelled Harry completely naked. It felt so good being on top of him he almost just dove in, but he wanted to savor the moment. He left wet open-mouthed kisses all the way up his chest.
without saying a word Draco intertwined his fingers in Harry's hair, leaned up, and kissed him slowly so he could savor every second of it. Harry kissed back just as slowly and pulled Draco as close as he could get. Draco became impatient of the space and crawled into Harry's lap. Harry fought a moan but it managed to escape. This cause a chain reaction. Draco moaned at Harry's moan which turned Harry on immensely, so harry pulled Draco closer to him making them both moan again.
"Uh, no master." Harry looked away.
The morning light that was streaming in from the bedroom window flooded into my eyelids and I began to stir. I clenched and unclenched my fist trying to figure out why it hurt. I opened my eyes and was becoming aware of the warm puffs of air fluttering through my hair, and the familiar, strong arm under my head.
"It's where I take care of you and make sure you are comfortable with the events that just occurred. I also use this time to soothe any pain I may have caused you physically and emotionally. In short it's a way for me to make sure you're okay." Draco said.
"Why is that?" Draco looked confused.
"I have another assignment in a few hours." Draco replied with a sad smile. Harry stood from the bed and wrapped Draco in his arms.
"Thank you, Griffin. You were the best cat anyone could ever wish for."  Harry gave him a few more pets as the doctor administered the drug and griffin crossed the rainbow bridge.
"Hiya, pup!" Harry exclaimed as he took Teddy into his arms and gave him a squeeze. Andromeda handed him Teddy's bag then left through the fire place without a word. Harry shook his head. Before she found out he was gay she used to adore him. He didn't understand why her sister, Narcissa, was okay with it, but she wasn't.
I began to shake him trying my hardest to break him out of it.
Draco was too distraught to fight "Move out of my way Weasley! I'm here for Harry!"  He said trying to get past Ron. He could she Hermione coming out to break them up.
"Draco Malfoy?" The healer asked as she entered the room.
"Fuck" Harry whispered loudly into Draco's ear. Harry kept his hands back so he wouldn't touch Draco.
Harry pulled away for a second and wiped Draco's tears away. "I will believe you." He said deeply looking into Draco's eyes. Draco fell back into his arms.
"I'm going to. I promise." Harry replied. He kissed Draco passionately, but Draco disappeared and darkness took over again. Hello led around him and could see a white light in the distance. When he listened closely, he could hear Draco's voice coming from it. He thought that couldn't be death, so he followed it.
"Well I think that's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard." Draco said stopping just for a minute before returning to what he was doing. Harry's hips started to buck and roll trying to find friction.
Harry stood from the bar stool and leaned over the counter. Cupping Draco's face he wiped his tears away with his thumbs. "Hey, I forgave you years ago. You're a different person, a better person. I can see it and you’re absolutely stunning." Harry whispered the last part and Draco gave him a sad smile.
Draco attacked Harry's neck making it super hard for him to unlock the door. Once inside Harry pulled him into another deep kiss as they kicked of their shoes, took off their jackets and masks and walked to the bedroom, bouncing of the hallway walls as they went.
"Come on, Draco, it was an accident." Ommin said.
"Stay." Draco ordered.
I pulled out of him and collapsed to the bed.
"Uh, yeah." Harry said scratching the back of his neck.
Harry gently bit Draco's lip making him moan. He took the opportunity to snake his tongue into Draco's mouth, which made Draco moan more. They fought for dominance, but Harry won.
"Oh yeah been stalking my posts?" Draco laughed and Harry couldn't tell if he meant that to sound so flirtatious.
Draco took out his wand, whispered a spell, and ropes rose from the corners of the four-post bed wrapping themselves around Harry's wrists and ankles. Harry let out a moan as the ropes tightened and spread his arms and leg apart.
"Harry Potter, will you be my boyfriend?" He whispered then gently began sucking on my ear lobe.
I began to scream. It was all I could do. I was screaming and pulling my hair as I fell to the ground and crawled to hi side.
"No, dear, I’m not laughing. Please stay come in and talk for a while. You don't have to stay the whole night but please give me that." He sounded so sincere and Draco did find that pout irresistibly adorable. Draco nodded and harry took his hand and led him to a cozy little living room, then accioed something. "I know you don't care much for muggle clothing, but I don't think you want to wear that tux all night." he handed him a t shirt and jeans and a pair of house shoes. "There's a bathroom over there."
We talked a little while longer then they left after checking to make sure harry was okay. He was still fast asleep.  I let my head fall against the back of my arm chair for a moment as I ran through a list of everything that I needed to do, but my thoughts were soon interrupted by muffled screaming. I jumped from my chair and ran to Harry's room.
"I've never felt anything like that." Harry responded.
"I didn't know you could cook. That sounds great. Can I at least put a shirt on though?" Draco begged.
"You're surprisingly a sexy dancer!" Draco yelled over the music.

He grabbed Draco by the hair and shoved his cock down his throat making Draco gag. He then proceeded to face fuck Draco till tears were streaming down his face and his throat was raw. When the man felt satisfied, he led Draco by his hair to the bed and forced him to bend over. He then ripped the spandex short off, lined his cock up to Draco’s hole and shoved it in all at once. Draco screamed loudly as pain shot through his body.
"Just trying to get me naked, now are you?" Harry laughed.
"Gods, yes!" Harry moaned.
Harry almost spat out his water. He dabbed his chin with a napkin. "You're joking right?"
"Hello, pet." He smirked as he took a sip of his fire whiskey.
Harry let out a quiet, suppressed moan. "Please master, don't make me cum." Harry pleaded.
"I... uh...it just..." I put my finger against his lips.
"Yes, you should and no you shouldn't. I mean, fuck, call him tonight. You don't seem to have a problem waking people up at this hour." Pansy sassed.
"Are you a first-time customer, Sir?" Zachary asked.
"Now what is it Harry?" Narcissa gave him a friendly smile.
After Hermione found out she forced me to see both a wizard mind healer and a muggle psychiatrist, but all the sleeping pills, dreamless sleep potions, and healing spells in the world couldn't help me. Maybe I didn't deserve help. I deserve to relive the memories every night. Cursed by their spirits for the rest of my life. On second thought maybe, I don't deserve life.
It had been a week since Harry ended up in the hospital, and Draco spent every moment he could there. When he wasn't working or sleeping, he was with Harry.  He spent more time there than Hermione and Ron, whom he was slowly becoming friends with. Well, Hermione at least.
"Potter?" The tall blond man asked.
"I-I promise, D-Draco, I will try." He whispered. We stayed wrapped in each other's arms on the floor of the bathroom for what felt like hours, but it was only mere minutes, before I finally picked him up, Gods he was so light, and sat him on the counter.
Harry was shocked but nodded his head. Draco generally wrapped his fingers in Harry unruly hair and moved in slowly, placing his lips against Harry and kissing him slowly. Harry melted into the kiss. They're lips fit together magically, and Draco tasted like vanilla coffee. He felt Draco's tongue swipe against his bottom lip so he ever so slightly opened his mouth. Allowing Draco to enter and explore every inch of him. He let out and quiet moan and Draco gripped his hair a little tighter. A few minutes later they pulled away, lip swollen and out of breath.
Two weeks past and it was finally time for Harry to go to court again. He was not looking forward to it. He hoped this time they'd actually settle something instead of just push the date again.
Draco leaned forward and kissed him, so Harry pulled him closer. Soon Draco was on Harry's lap and Harry was grabbing his hips.
"Just the ministry. Nothing important." Harry lied.
Harry had had enough. Everything was crushing him; His work load for the Aurors, His friends, and especially Andromeda not letting him see his godson because he came out as gay. He walked down the muggle city streets looking for the nearest pub. he finally found one called The Witches Brew. He thought that was amusing. The pub was pretty empty, so he walked in and sat down at the bar. He noticed the bartender with long platinum blond hair, turned away from him placing some glasses on the shelves.
"Who that, daddy?" Harry heard a little voice say. he looked down to see a five-year-old version of Malfoy clutching onto Draco's pant leg.
"Not really." Harry said as he scratched the back of his neck.
"So, what were you working on?" Harry asked.
"Please come home with me? The lack of you not being naked is driving me fucking crazy!" Harry begged.
"Are you sure you're ok to go dear?" Once again Harry smiled at Draco's words.
They pulled apart but continued to hug.
"I'll take...holy fuck." Harry said under his breath as the toy vibrated against his prostate.
"Suicide." She managed to choke out as she screwed her eyes tight trying to hold in her tears.
"Yeah." Harry scratches the back of his neck, "Griffins just so damn sexy!" They both laughed. Harry took in a deep breath and gathered the courage for what he wanted to ask next. "Do you want to sit and catch up for a bit?" He asked his heart about to leap out of his chest.
"Let's go get a drink." Draco smirked.
"Was that Draco Malfoy?!" She said as soon as he walked into the living room.
With one hand and while still moving his hips Harry started unbuttoning Draco's shirt. Once done he sat up bringing Draco with him and slipped it off. Without skipping a beat Draco grabbed Harry's shirt and ripped it off. Buttons flying everywhere.
"You're into Malfoy?" Hermione asked.
Harry chuckled, "Mmhmm, my friend Ron and I couldn’t get onto platform 9 3/4 because your grandfather's house elf at the time, Dobby..."
"Daddy, what are we having for dinner?" Scorpius asked looking up from his coloring book.
Draco looked up at him with pleading eyes and pulled him in for another searing kiss, as he helped Harry out of his sweatpants and boxers. Soon, he could feel Harry's bare erection pushed against his and he began to buck his hips trying to create friction.
Harry wrapped him in his arms and kissed his head. "Draco, I promise, with me around that'll never happen to you again. I care too much to ever hurt you." Draco just nodded. Harry lifted his chin so he could look him in the eye.  "How about we just do this slow. Let me earn your trust. I won't do anything you don't want to do, just please let me take care of you?"
"I placed a cock ring around it so you can’t cum whenever you want to. If you want to cum you ask me and I’ll decide if you've earned it." Draco whispered.
"This is crazy!" Harry said staring in disbelief. He picked up his phone and started a message to Draco. He didn't know how to start this conversation. It had been so long since they talked it felt weird. So, he went with "Hey Draco."
"You forgive me?" Draco choked.
not long after he heard the fireplace roar, "Harry is that you?" He yelled from the bathroom.
Draco pulled Harry close and whispered in his ear. "How about next Saturday you book me for the whole night?"
"Bye, dear."  Draco also smiled.
Harry slowly push inside of Draco until he was all the way inside of him.
Harry gave him his address and took Griffin out into the living room to wait. It was my long till there was a knock on the door. Harry's heart began to race as he opened the door.
"Since this is your first experience we'll start with a little game. I'll give you orders and every-time I feel satisfied with their completion I will take off an article of clothing and/or touch you."
"Harry Potter?" Narcissa said before Lucius had the chance to speak. Her voice was soft but surprised.
Reaching up, harry pushed his fingers into Draco’s mouth and he sucked the greedily till they were wet enough for harry to slowly slide them into Draco’s tight hole one at a time. Draco moaned louder with each one.
"Visitors!?" I sat up as his words finally hit me.
"Please Draco, let me explain myself. I'm a different man now. I need you." Ommin begged, but Draco could see he wasn't being sincere.
"That'll be perfect!" Harry exclaimed.
"Merlin, I love you!" I said kissing his head.
"I can't wait till I can ride a broom! Daddy are we going to go to the park next like we always do?"  Scorpius had finished his ice cream getting most of it on his face.
"Oh, I see. That kind of dream." Draco laughed in return.
"Good luck today, baby. I hope it goes well." Draco said as he kissed him goodbye.
"Begging just turns me on more." The man yelled as he flipped Draco over and wrapped his hand around Draco’s throat. "Com'on beg for me to stop!"
The healer nodded and led us to Harry's room. I'd never seen him so helpless. I sat beside him and held his hand. "Gods, if only you understood how many people still love you, how many people need you in their life. I don't care if I sound selfish. You're needed harry potter. I wish I knew what you needed, though. I wish I knew what I could say to make you realize you have a place here, that your forgiven and you were never blamed." I whispered into his ear. Suddenly I was struck with a thought. I sat up abruptly "Maybe you just need to hear it from the right person. Stay with him, I need to make a call." I ordered Ron as I rushed out of the room scrolling through my phone in search of the right number. I hit send and it rang twice before the other person picked up.
"I'm glad you like it, it's my favorite restaurant!" Draco took Harry's hand and they both smiled.
Yours always,
"It’s okay, sweetheart. You have another shot, and I will be right her to help you." I stroked his hair and felt him relax. "Now you go hope in the shower and get dressed and I'll make us some breakfast."
Harry left the ministry fuming. It had been the 6th court date he had had with Andromeda, and, again, her lawyer managed to push the date so he'd have to continue only seeing his godson, Teddy, every other weekend. He was tired of it. He would do anything to get custody over him, but ever since he came out as gay Andromeda was doing everything, she could to keep Teddy from him. She had even started spreading viscous rumors about him, making him look like a bad guy. luckily many of his friends and people that followed him during the war didn't believe them.
"There’s nothing to forgive you for, you’ve done nothing wrong. I'm sorry I couldn't get to you faster." A tear slipped down Harry's cheek as he kissed Draco’s forehead. He wrapped Draco in his trench coat and picked him up bridal style. As he walked out the door, he kicked Miguel hard in the head, breaking his nose. He wished he could do more.
"No actually I had a question for you." Harry said.
Draco pressed his clothed, hard cock against Harry's bare ass, teasing him. With a hand still on his throat he whispered in Harry's ear again, "what did you learn? What do you call me?"
"I did! We got stuck in the Whomping Willow!" Harry said excitedly.
"Sure. Sounds like fun." Draco said, "Herbs can wait till tomorrow."
"What?" Draco smiled.
"I don't want to make you blush if I’m not there to see it." Harry said laughing.
"I'm glad you're doing something you enjoy." Harry laughed.
"What!? In the Whomping Willow, and you lived!?" Scorpius exclaimed.
"Harry I'm so sorry! I'm such a slut! Please don’t look at me." He cried.
"What is aftercare?" Harry asked.
"Okay, you'll be in room 202 with The Master on Saturday at 9 o'clock." Zachary repeated.
He felt Harry's arms wrap around him and pull him in tight, "Draco, you saved mine in return, don't you remember?"
"What I wouldn't do to make you mine for real." Draco said sadly as he pulled Harry tighter.
Immediately after drinking the potion Harry felt like he hadn't come at all.
He chuckled, "And I love you." He smiled up at me and pulled me in for a sweet and loving kiss.
"Good. You?" The guy asked.
"I-I-I-b-but I was so mean to you." Draco had tears welling up in his eyes at the thought of Harry caring about him no matter what insult he threw at him.
Harry POV
"You had a story for me?" Draco asked finally trying to look Harry in the eye.
"Sure! Would you like me to get you some water and put you to bed again?" Harry said brushing Draco's hair out of his face. Draco nodded again. Harry went to the kitchen, found the glasses then brought Draco the water. After he drank the whole thing, Harry took his hand and led him to his bedroom where he transformed his clothes and tucked him into bed, leaving a kiss on his forehead.
"Remember, don't cum until I tell you to." Draco reminded.
As I read it I couldn't fight my tears any more and one slipped down my cheek. "How could he feel this? How could he be so hurt?" Was all I could think. I looked back to Hermione who was finally pulling herself back together enough to speak.
"H-harry?" Draco asked.
Warning: Smut
"Uh I guess we're friends now." Harry knew now she must have seen how affectionate Draco was towards him and began to worry.
"Of course! How's Next Saturday at 9 pm?"
"I love you too." He whispered. "Now get up! I have a surprise." He said throwing the covers off us. I watched his perfect arse as he walked to our bathroom to get ready.
"It's ok I had it coming." Draco said. Entering the room, he finally saw just how bad Harry was. His face was black and blue and there were scars from all the cuts the healers had healed.
"W-what happened with the job?" Draco was shocked to hear himself stuttering and quickly looked down at the table.
"Got to go?" Harry asked from the bed.
"Yes... well sort of. She overheard us talking." Harry wiped a tear from his eye. "I feel like such an asshole."
All while Draco was screaming on the inside, "IS HARRY POTTER ASKING ME ON A DATE?!?!" He shook his head and calmed down. "This couldn't be a date after all. Harry's not even gay. I don't even know if I am."
"Yes, I did! I think it'll help you to see me in a different light." Harry said getting up and sitting on the couch.  "Would you like me to hold you?"
"You look lost, honey. Can I help you?" She yelled over the music.
Harry felt a tingling on his cock that slowly got stronger and stronger till he was gripping the sheets.
"I wish I would have come to you sooner. Harry if we would have lost you, I don't know what I would have done. It would be like losing two brothers." He brushed a tear from his eye before it could fall. "Harry, your family, you always have been, and you always will be. There is so many people in this world that love you, and not just because you're the chosen one. Me, mum, dad, Ron, Hermione, and even Fred love you because you're Harry, Our brother and son." He looked up and smiled at me and I returned it even though tears were now streaming down my face. 'Our odd looking, raven haired, green eyed brother, but you eh I guess you still fit in." He chuckled and put me in a head lock as he ruffled my hair, and we both laughed.
"I'm having a pretty rough time to be honest. I'm in a custody battle with Andromeda over my godson, Teddy." Harry placed his hands in his pockets and kicked a rock in front of him.
"I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright?" Harry wanted to reach out and hug Draco but he didn't.
"B-but he saved my life." I was shocked at my stutter.
Draco accioed a potion and took Harry's blind gold off.
"Is it too much?" Harry asked when he was fully inserted.
Just when Draco thought the man was going to crush his throat the man shouted "Oh yeah! I'm gunna fucking cum!" And he shot his load deep in Draco’s ass. It burned badly and Draco felt his body weakening more and more till his vision blurred then he blacked out.
"Still so slow, Potter." Draco laughed, "You are my biggest crush too."
Harry hadn't even notice who he had sat next to until, "Also this year, we have a new Matron. Draco Malfoy." McGonagall spoke and Harry froze in his seat as he felt the person next to him shake their head and sand up to acknowledge the crowd.
"Tell me what you want, baby." Harry said seductively as he rubbed Draco through his boxers.
"No master." Harry said as he stared up at Draco.
"Oh fuck!" He screamed arching his head backwards. "I'm going too..." the machine cut off again.
Harry slipped out of his shoes then removed his socks. After that he started on his trousers. Draco leaned forward in his chair placing his drink on the table and steepling his fingers. Harry continued to meet his gaze which seemed hungry and lustful. It was starting to drive him crazy. He wanted to be touched again so badly.
"Yes, master." Harry moved from the bed and got on his knees in front of Draco.
"Are you okay, beautiful." I blushed at the pet name, and just nodded.
"I-I'm sorry m-master." Harry stuttered.
"I can't." Draco whispered.
"So, do you." Draco moaned. He began to move in and out slowly picking up speed. Soon they were both shaking through they're orgasms and Harry woke up with a mess in his pants.
"Shh I won't let that happen. I'm here to protect you and Scorpius. It could also just be a rumor. I'll find out for sure from the ministry when I go into work on Monday. What's his name?"
"Come on Ron let leave them alone." She said calmly as she guided Ron to the waiting room. "I'm sorry Draco."
"I'd thought I lost you!" Draco sobbed.
"Is he single?" Harry winked.
"I'd pay anyways. You're so much better at this than I am." Harry chuckled barely able to move his lips.
Draco started to cry, "Yeah, I'll be there as fast as I can." He said trying to hide the quiver in his voice.
"Why are you scared Draco?" Harry asked still holding Draco.
"Yes master! Please!" Harry begged.
"Harry, I need to feel all of you! Please fuck me!" Draco moaned.
"I'd like that a lot." Harry took Draco's hand.
"To start, stand up and remove your clothes, slowly." Draco ordered.
"Well, he asked me out but I said no."
"You're taking me to Draco and I'm taking him from this place." Harry growled from behind Miguel. Miguel held his hand up in surrender.
"What post?" Draco smirked.
"Oh yeah? What makes you think that?" Draco blushed again.
"Ugh, Fine. I got us both an appointment to get matching tattoos." I pulled the drawing out of my pocket and handed them to harry. He gasped.
Draco started to panic but sobered up when he heard a small voice say, "Ommin's free?" He looked up to see Scorpius, fear stricken and in tears at the top of the stairs. He opened his arms and Scorpius ran into them. "Daddy, no! You said he couldn't get us again!" Cried the five-year-old.
"Hi, umm, I'm looking to book a Dominatrix?" Harry said quietly.
"Damn, you're so sexy!" Harry exclaimed. Draco giggled and Harry could see a little bit of blush under neither his white mask. "You respond like no one calls you that."
"Yes, it's me, love. I'm here, he's gone." He wrapped both of them in his arms. "Everything is going to be okay."
It gripped me a threw me into a bright room. My eye lid fluttered open, and I threw my head back and sobbed.
"Well I was coming to ask if you'd like to join me at the Three Broom Sticks for a butterbeer. Are you busy?" Harry gave Draco his best smile and a small wink.
Harry got down on one knee so he could be eye level with the small child, "Yes I did, with a great big sword."
"The underground, Miguel speaking." Miguel answered.
"I love you." Draco pushed his forehead against Harry's.
This time Pansy answered, "Draco we know you've always loved him." I couldn't find a reply to this.
"Now we should get up, we have guests coming at noon and you, my dear, need a shower and some food." He smiled and got out of bed. leaving me missing the feeling of his warm body.
When Harry flooed over he saw Draco with his head in his hands sitting alone in the living room.
"Leave this property before I hex you into oblivion!" Harry shouted, his hand getting ready to grab his wand.
"Hi, Harry?"
"Yeah. Before I had no problem with missions like this, but now I have something to come back to and I don’t want you to go away." Harry was fighting back tears at the thought of never seeing Draco again.
"This is Harry Potter, Scorp." Draco replied.
"Master, please, can I cum!" Harry’s legs were quivering and his hands were gripping the sheets.
He continued to follow Draco's posted for the next week. Draco posted every day, and every time he did Harry got butterflies. He loved looking and Griffin’s beautiful green eyes but he really got excited when Draco posted a selfie. Which wasn't near as often as post he made about griffin.
"Ah well, in that case I’ll set you up with The Master as we call him. He does everything except excrement play, and he's really knows how to work a beginner. He'll have you coming back for more!" Zachary exclaimed.
"Do you really find me that sexy?" Draco asked.
"Oh...my...Harry...more." He moaned, and I obeyed thrusting in another finger and waiting for him to adjust before making a slow scissoring motion. I sucked him as gently as I could, giving him just enough friction to merely tease him.
"Sounds perfect!" Harry replied.
The next morning Draco awoke alone in his bed. He sat up wondering if it all had been a dream, but then he saw the note on the dresser. He picked it up and read it;
"Morning." I whispered.
"Ok there are a lot of questions I'll let you ask one then I’ll ask one and so on. Deal?" Harry said.
I lifted my hips just slightly pressing my hardness against Draco's, and he let out a sharp whine in need as he pulled away from my mouth.
"S-stop." Draco choked. The man moaned and plowed him harder squeezing Draco’s neck more and more to the point that Draco couldn't breathe at all. He started clawing at the man’s hands, but the man just laughed and strengthened his grip.
Draco's tongue lapped in and out of Harry's tight whole making him squirm and moan. Then as soon as it started it stopped. He gripped the sheets as he felt Draco sink his teeth into His ass cheek.
After about thirty minutes of cuddles the two finally stood and started getting dressed. Draco had to help Harry stand on his shaking legs to get his trousers and pants on.
"Oh gods, Dray, I love you." Harry moaned as he felt Draco around him.
"Aunt Andromeda and Teddy." I watched his eyes widen and I could visibly see the fear rise on his face.
"I know that, but why are you working in a place like this? Shouldn't you be able to live off you family's money?" Harry said after rolling his eyes.
"I thought I'd lost you!" Draco sobbed.
Harry sat next to Draco's bed holding his hand while he slept. They had been there for a couple hours and were now waiting for the healer.
"For what? You don't need to be sorry you did nothing wrong." Harry soothed.
He sighed and took his clothes off so he could step into the shower. The warm water felt good on his sore body. He really liked that he could still feel Draco on him though. He started to get hard thinking about it again. He felt young again with all these feelings and lust swarming inside of him. He grabbed his cock and started reimagining the night before again. It didn't take him long to cum again.
Warning: Violent rape scene.
"But I'm not a mind healer?" I said confused.
"f-fuck, Draco, you feel so good."
"I'd love to." They moved to the dance floor and began moving to the beat.
Draco's eyes widened a little as a bit of realization hit him. This he did not know.
"Wh..." Harry began to say but remembered, "Yes, master."
They arrived from the hospital a few hours after Draco awoke, and now harry was hard at work getting the guest room, that he had used as a storage, ready. He had forced Draco to relax on the couch.
"Tell me you love my cock." Draco whispered.
"Draco!?" Harry said excitedly, "I was just dreaming about you."
"Surgery!?" Draco’s eyes went wide.
"Yeah, da." He said as he came bounding out of his room. We adopted him after we married.
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding and slammed the door. He put up new wards, the strongest he could think of, and went upstairs to comfort Draco and Scorpius.
"I'm a healer." Draco said as he put his drink down on the table beside him.
"Thank you, sweetheart." Harry said smiling through the hug.
"I don't think Harry would want to do that, buddy." Draco said his blush turning more red.
He got up from his chair, sat his book down and took a seat beside me on the sofa. "Harry I can see right through you. I promise everything will be okay. If I notice any change in your behavior or see that you need an out, I will help you. Can you promise me you'll try though?" He had his arms wrapped around me and was staring into my eyes as if he was attempting to see my soul.
"Well not entirely." Draco winked. Harry blushed a little he never thought Draco would flirt with him. "I also know you a lot more than my other clients and I wanted to catch up."
"I'm s-sorry m..." Before harry could say another word his bindings were loosened and he was being flipped onto his stomach. a velvet cushion was placed under his stomach and then the bindings were tightened again. He felt leather straps tighten around his knees and connect to his elbows keeping him in position.
he got home and went to the kitchen to get a glass of wine, hoping it would help him relax. Then he remembered he drank the last bottle the night before. he let out a loud sigh, and decided it was time to go to the store anyways. He grabbed his keys and left for the muggle super market.
"They're going to put me in the crazy bin!?" I began to hyperventilate.
"Well play your cards right and maybe someday you will be." Draco smiled and winked. It was the first time Harry had seen anything like that old snarky side of Draco since they met in the store and it made his heart soar. He was beginning to worry Draco would never open up to him, but this gave him hope. They went to the living room and sat down. Draco curled up in Harry's arms on the couch.
"Harry, once you feel up to it would you like to start taking him on the weekend maybe even for the summers?" Andromeda asked me.
"He's still alive?" One of them said.
"Only to you, baby." The pet name made Draco smile. Draco sat on the counter and watched Harry cook. He had never had a lover cook for him before. Then again, the only other lover he had outside of school was Blaise, and he was an asshole. He was always the giver and Blaise were always the taker. There was no balance. He started to think of all the things he wanted to do for Harry, and how Harry would be worth giving everything to. He was so deep in thought he didn't notice Harry was almost done cooking.
"Oh my god!" Harry yelled. Draco's balls slapped against his ass as he rode Draco's every thrust. "Oh master!"
Harry thought for a minute, "Male." He finally decided.
"Yes, master."
Draco sat up so he could see Harry's face, "Harry I would love that, more than anything."
Draco brushes his lips against Harry's ear "Do you like that?"
Not sure what to say, He paced outside for about 10 minutes. He decided to just wing it.
"Keep going." Draco scolded. Harry continued to suck. Taking almost half of Draco's cock into his mouth and fighting the urge to gag. Draco couldn't take his eyes off him; Lips red and tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. "Look up at me." Harry's green eyes met Draco's as he continued to suck. Harry let out a moan the vibrated through Draco's cock that made him lose control. He intertwined his fingers in Harry's hair and began thrusting in and out of Harry's mouth. Harry gripped Draco's thighs and moaned. "Mm, good boy. Take it all." once Draco was close to his orgasm he pulled out and Harry started coughing and spluttering. Draco relaxed in his chair and focused on not cumming. Once he was calm again and Harry had composed himself, he took Harry's face in his hand and said, "You've earned a reward. You took that so well. Lay down on the bed."
"Hello?" The voice on the other line asked.
He reached around and gripped Draco's ass which caused Draco to move forward. They're hard cocks brushed against each other. Harry wasn't expecting that so he through his head back and let out a loud moan.
Ommin threw up his hands in surrendered and backed off the porch. "You tell them I will be seeing them. That's a promise." Then he apparated away.
"That little bit or the old Malfoy always manages to find a way to slip out." Hermione said jokingly. I chuckled.
"You're right, thank you Pansy. I guess I should call him." Draco said taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out. "I shouldn't let him go again."
I heard him chuckle, "I'm far from an angel, Harry." I cringed realizing I had just spoke my thoughts but was quickly pulled from it when I heard his voice whisper my name. It was so familiar but, in the way, that I had realized I'd never heard his voice speak it before. I blinked and rubbed my eyes and finally sharp features and blue eyes filled my vision.
That night they hadn't done anything more than snog, but it had definitely been the best Draco had ever had. It had been a week since that night and they had called each other whenever they had the chance.
"Bye Harry!" Scorpius exclaimed.
They both collapsed to the bed. Harry on top of Draco.
"Hey Harry! You ready to go, mate?" Ron asked.
"Oh, that's great!" Narcissa exclaimed. Harry was surprised. "You two would be so good for each other! He needs someone like you in his life. He's had such a bad experience with love."
"Fuck! You feel so good, baby!" Harry moaned.
"Since when do you call him Draco?!" Ginny said shocked.
"I'm an Auror." Harry said proudly.
"b-but I... it's just so hard to look at him." He looked down at the bed.
"Make eye contact with me so I know you understand." Draco ordered.
"D-dray?" He said as he wiped the tears away with his thumbs. "What's wrong? What did you mean back there?"
"Are you feeling ok?" Harry asked.
Sunday, Harry said goodbye to Teddy, and Monday morning arrived fast. Harry did his digging like he said he would, and he didn't like the outcome.  Ommin Coventry had been released from Azkaban. Not only that but he had managed to slip through the cracks of the ministry. No one knew of his whereabouts. Harry didn't know how to tell Draco.
"I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you." Draco said quietly, "You saved my life... twice."
"You just feel so... right." Draco sighed and fully relaxed against Harry.
" If you really mean it, I'll do it."
"Can sleep with us?" Draco asked again. Harry nodded and picked Scorpius's limp body up. He led Draco to the room and laid the little boy between them. then he transfigured both their clothes and wrapped his arms around both Scorpius and Draco. He watched over both of them for a few hours before he, himself, fell asleep.
Harry chases him and got a stall door slammed in his face. He made sure no one was in the bathroom then locked the door. "Draco come out."
"Gods, you are an angel." I whispered as it felt like my face was gravitating to his. He opened his eyes at the feeling of my breath against his lips, only to have them flutter shut as I closed the distance. His lips against mine were the most amazing thing I have ever felt. The way they moved the way they tasted, the way his hand found its way into my hair pulling me in deeper, all of it was perfect. We pulled apart panting hard, from the passion.
"Even mid yawn he's sexier than me! #onesexykitty"
"Shhhhhh he hasn't slept in days." Harry whispered.
Tears were now pouring down Draco’s cheeks as he let out scream after scream. It felt as though he was being torn apart. He looked down at the rug as the man pounded into him. He could see blood starting to trickle down his leg. It made him feel light headed.
Draco's POV
"How bad is it healer?" Harry asked.
I gulped, "I promise."
"My sweet boy. I don't know what I'd do without you! #griffinisthe cutest"
Harry finds out who his escort is.
The minute the door slammed behind them Draco fell apart falling into Harry's arms.
Harry
"What do you need Draco?" Harry's voice was husky and deep now and it nearly pushed Draco over the edge.
"Draco," Harry cupped his cheek and tilted his head so he was looking into his eyes, "I'd do anything for you." They stared at each other for a few second, Harry wanted to kiss him so badly, but he thought it wasn't the right time. Draco was secretly hoping the same thing, but was too afraid to make the first move. Plus, Scorpius was crying in Draco's lap holding on to both him and Harry.
"It's Harry, He was attacked and he won't stop asking for you." Draco could tell she's been crying. "Draco can you come to St. Mungo's. I don't know if he's going to make it this time."
"So much trouble! Professor Snape was furious! We had been seen by 7 muggles and down damage to a tree that had been on the grounds, 'since before we were born!'" Both Harry and Draco laughed at Harry's poor imitation of Snape.
"That was everything I wanted and more." Draco panted with his head against Harry's.
"Yes, master." Harry said as he did as he was told. As he took off his sticky boxers his cock was dripping with cum. Draco smirked and walked towards him. With two fingers he swiped up some of Harry's cum.
"Mm Good morning, sexy."
"Yes master." Harry said and he straddled Draco. Draco lined up his cock and Harry slowly sat down on it. Draco threw his head back as Harry bottomed out.
"I told you I'd come back to you." Harry kisses Draco's head. He was so happy to be holding his man again.
"Thank you again."
"Me too." Draco pumped a few more times before both him and Harry were rolling in ecstasy. They both shook in each other's arms, kissing tenderly, for what felt like an eternity.
"I love Tacos!" Scorpius took a bag from Harry and took it to the kitchen.
Draco couldn't help but think how weird it was to not see the whole golden trio together. His stomach turned a little as he wondered where Potter might be at this moment. He knew he had become an Auror, but he had only seen him once after the war. At his trials to be exact, where Potter had helped him plead not guilty. After, they never spoke again, and Draco secretly regretted it. He really wanted to apologize and thank the boy... well the man, now.
"You asked my mother!?" Draco exclaimed, shocked that Harry would go that far just to talk to him.
"No, master." Harry said as he stood and slowly started unbuttoning his shirt. He started staring at the floor again.
"I love you daddy." My stomach did another flip as I heard his sleepy voice, but this was a good flip. I hugged him back.
They both said their good nights and got ready for bed. As Draco lay in the dark and quiet room, he couldn't get his mind of Harry’s body. He tried to imagine what he'd look like naked. Then he felt something stir in his pant. He reached down to adjust but something felt off.  It felt more sensitive and... bigger. He couldn't stop touching himself. He slipped his hand in his pants and jumped at what he felt. He cast a Lumos and looked at what was now three engorged tentacles.
Harry adjusted his suit as he got ready for the Halloween masquerade ball. Ron and Hermione would be there any minute to pick him up. He was just trying on his red and black devils mask when there was a knock on the door. He took it off and hurried to answer it.
They stayed up talking for a little while till Draco started to yawn, then Harry suggested they go to bed. Harry was nervous but he stripped down to his boxers, then he noticed Draco had done the same.
"Harry..." I said sitting beside him and gripping his hand, "He's you godson, you made an unspoken promise to him, and he need you more than anybody."
Draco turned around and laid his head on Harry's chest. He thought for a moment about how safe he felt. He had never felt this way before. "It’s okay. I'll tell you." Draco whispered.
"Draco."
"You could have just asked for a date you got." He sent it.
"I'm certain Ginny and I are done and I want you more than anything." Harry stroked Draco's cheek. Draco sat up slowly.
He just watched with sad eyes as I waved my wand and repaired the mirror then set to work fixing his hand. After I was finished, and he was all patched up and blood free he final said something.
"Harry!?" Draco exclaimed. Harry turned around. "Will I see you again?"
"Suck." I whispered as I presented my fingers. He greedily took them into his mouth coating them with saliva. I followed my trail back down to his leaking cock and gently like the tip, savoring his pre-come and enjoying the magnificent squeal he expelled from his lips. I circled his entrance with my slicked fingers as my tongue continues to swirl around his tip, leaving him a writhing mess on the sheets.
"I hope you'll tell her soon. Goodbye Harry." Draco said and they hung up.
"You're beautiful, Draco." He said as Draco moaned. Draco cupped Harry’s face and kissed him deeply. He slid his hands inside Harry’s shirt and harry removed it breaking the kiss for only a moment. Harry cupped Draco's ass and stood up wrapping Draco's legs around his waist. The continued to kiss deeply as he carried Draco to his bedroom.
"Fuck Harry!" Draco cursed as he felt his chest flutter at Harry's laugh.
The nodded and went through the back door. 15 minutes later he emerged again with another bouncer.
"Not quite your shoes untied." Harry said then bopped Teddy's nose when he went to look. "Made you look!" They both laughed.
"Yes, master. if you do or say anything uncomfortable or too painful, I can say the safe word which is snitch." Harry repeated.
"Oh fuck, you're so tight!" Harry moaned.
"Yes." He said opening my dresser and pulling out some clothes for me.
"Y-yes master." Harry stuttered, but moved his head so he could look Draco in the eye.
"Well I kind of can't tell you that, he will, but first I've sent over some extra confidentiality forms. you have to read through them sign and give them to him when you meet up."
"Come with me, baby." Harry whispered as they both fell over the edge. Their bodies shaking as they rode out the high of their orgasm.
Harry, who heard this from the hall way, smiled, and Draco’s heart fluttered, as he closed the door. He looked at Harry who still had a huge grin on his face.
The all placed their order, Draco getting vanilla, Harry getting rocky road, and Scorpius getting bubblegum.
Throughout dinner they talked about all sorts of stuff; the war, Draco's parents, Ron and Hermione, and they just got on the subject of the Dursleys when they started cleaning up.
"Please." Harry moaned and Draco attacked his lips passionately. they both wallowed in the taste of each other and soon Draco needed more contact, so he reached down and grabbed Harry's member. Harry opened his mouth to moan and Draco took the opportunity to insert his tongue. He won dominance and explored ever bit of Harry's mouth.
"I know Harry. I believe I love you too." Draco smiled as Harry kissed the tip of his nose, and they drifted off to sleep in each other's arms.
"I'll be fine, Draco. Just a few more minutes of this then we can go." Harry relaxed his head and snuggled closer to Draco's chest. Draco smiled and wrapped his arms tighter.
"Draco, are these the drawings I was watching you do all week last week?" I nodded. "Awe, angel, I love Them. You're getting the lion, right?"
"Right. I'm terribly sorry." She whispered. "I'm healer Fran. We finally got the test results back."
"You can have me." Harry whispered in his ear as he nibbled the lobe. he stared to grind causing as minimal fiction as possible, just enough to tease. Draco tilted his head back and clawed at Harry's back.
They sat and talked for an hour about what they did after the war. They didn't bring up any of the sad part just kept the mood light and relaxed and it felt good. They were so happy that they could laugh together now.
"Please be mine, baby." Harry moaned.
"The bath. Come up and bring a glass, I have wine!"
"I don't know just something about you being relaxed and natural really turns me on." Harry chuckled. Draco blushed. "Finally, I get to see you blush! Gods, you're so cute, and I am so lucky!"
"I can't wait to see you."  Harry whispered.
He turned and saw Ommin walking towards him with a smirk on his face. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears and he thought he was going to be sick.
"Hmm well I know of this really cool arcade not too far from here. Do you like video games?"
"Of course, you can!" Harry replied.
Draco smiled.
"True, true. So, what do you do?" Harry asked.
"Harry of course you do. You told her, didn't you?"
"I promise."  Harry whispered. "Draco, why are you a dom?"
"Thank you so much Draco." She said into my lapel. I just returned the hug and nodded my appreciation.
"I need to feel more of you." Harry said as he started undoing Draco's pants. They both took each other's pants off and began grinding on each through their boxers.
"Wow! That's amazing!" Scorpius was jumping up and down now. "Do you want to go play a game with me?!"
Draco slipped a blindfold over Harry's eyes, then told him to lay on the bed.
"Let’s get you to a hospital love." And he apparated away.
"Why do you need me?"
"M-master." Harry replied. Draco let go and sat down in his chair taking another sip of his whiskey.
"I missed you too." Draco said as he gave harry another kiss, "are we just going to snog in the entryway tonight?"
"Say my name. I'm not your master right now, I'm your equal." Draco whispered in Harry's ear.
"Yes, master." Harry said.
"You can't blame yourself, and we can't blame him." I tried my best to understand his words, but even for someone as smart as me. I looked at him confused.
"Why?"  Draco asked trying to avoid the questions that he knew Harry had on his mind.
"And I love you... so" He smiled.
"I know, but imagine how amazing it’s going to be when we get there."
I wanted to write this because this has been something that's been on my mind for awhile. It was inspired by two of my favorite songs, One More Light and Heavy, Both by Linkin park. I just wanted you guys to know, and for all of you out there that need to hear this there is always a reason to keep fighting, and there will always be help to those who need it.
Draco and Harry dated for 2 years before Draco had Griffin give him a ring asking to marry him. The married a year later and moved into a big house. A year after that Teddy moved in and they adopted Scorpius.
"D-Draco, you're going to make me come."
"Nope. Won't even let me talk to him." Harry replied
"Please harry stop teasing me." He begged. Harry quickly finished removing both his and Draco’s clothes then got on his knees in front of Draco. He started stroking Draco’s length till he was a writhing moaning mess, then he slowly popped just the tip into his mouth. Draco gave a sharp inhale as harry slowly took him into his throat inch by inch, then began bobbing his head faster and faster.
"Well Draco, that’s sad to hear, but you see that’s not going to happen. You see, I own you, and I'll do what I will with you and your body."
Draco hadn't even noticed he was staring back. "Yeah, yeah just feeling tired again."
"H-harry please move." He moaned. I began with a slow pace, feeling his warmth squeeze me tightly.
"All yours." Harry kissed Draco's lips again.
They went down stairs and sat at the bar.
"Can you tell me why? Do you not like me?" Harry was hurting.
I held him tighter, "Please, Harry, y-you have to forgive yourself, for that day. Y-you didn't mean to do it, a-and I-I can't lose you." I buried my tear-soaked face into his soft hair.
"Awe Draco, love, there you are." Ommin said. His voice was sickeningly sweet.
Harry licked a stripe up Draco’s hard length and Draco generally fisted his hair.
"Thank you!" Harry smiled but bit his lip as Draco turned around. He couldn't take his eyes off Draco's ass. "Fuck! I love your ass!"
"What the fuck does that mean? Hired him to do what?" She questioned.
I pressed my face into his shoulder and he pulled me tighter to his chest as I continued to sob. I cried for what seem like an hour before I remembered who was holding me and memories flooded into my brain. I could feel the scar I made on his chest all those years ago. I had almost murdered this man.  I pulled away from him and could have sworn I saw hurt him his eyes.
"Merlin, you make me the happiest man on earth." He whispered again. I cupped his face and pulled him to meet his gaze.
"No! No, I want to more than anything in this world. That's my biggest dream. It's just... I promised myself I wouldn't date for a while. Till I’m comfortable on my feet."
He watched as Draco bit his lip and his eyes seemed to be slightly sad. "Well After everything that happened, I started to hate myself, and I decided the only way to redeem myself was to heal people." He felt Harry Squeeze his hand, "It really has helped. I love my job. Getting to watch as I bring someone from the brink of death, it makes me feel... useful." He gave Harry a sad smile.
All this time Harry believed Griffin knew what he was doing all those years ago when he brought them together.
Harry's smile grew as he wrapped his arm through Draco's, nearly laughing at the surprised expression on the blond's face, and they headed to Hogsmeade.
"Okay." Harry smiled. Draco wasn't expecting that. "So, the story starts with and orphaned baby boy left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle. He was neglected till he was old enough to clean and cook. They forced him to live in a cupboard under the stairs for years, and there was always a surplus of abuse. Both mental and physical. His aunt would call him stupid or freak. His uncle would beat him senseless, until he was bloody and bruised sometimes. When he was finally able to go to Hogwarts, it became his only home, but after every summer he'd come back malnourished, bruised, and so depressed he sometimes wished Voldemort would just find him and finish the job."
"No! Please don't stop. I need you." He cried as his head fell back. "Gods, Harry, you're so big."
"He is a bit on the expensive side though, 500 an hour or 3500 for a night, which is 8 hours."
I was laying on Draco's bed watching him as he read and idly ran a hand through my hair.
"You're my pet now and you'll do as I say!" Miguel yelled. "Now stay and do whatever the client asks" he released Draco's hair and walked out the door. As he did Draco heard him say " he's all yours. Have fun."
Draco scooted a chair closer to the side of the bed, took Harry's hand and placed it to his lips.
Harry made a metal note of the pronoun Draco used, but was more curious as to why Draco thought he was better off alone. He decided to leave it before he pushed Draco too far.
"D-Draco, your head?" I carded my hand through my hair feeling the puncture wound on my scalp. There must have been a nail in the wall. "c-can I help you?" I nodded, and he turned me around, so he could clean me up and fix the wound.
"Yeah let me just go grab my mask." Harry said as he went back into his flat to grab it. They then apparated to the party.
Harry downed his whiskey in one shot, "Can I have another?" Draco rolled his eyes and poured him another.
"Don't walk away from me!" Ommin whisper yelled and grabbed Draco's arm hard enough to leave a bruise. Draco wanted to scream and run, but he gathered his courage and looked Ommin in the eye, "What, are you going to do, hit me, in front of all my coworkers?" then he ripped his arm away and walked to his office.
"I know, love. I just wish I would have thought about that before it happened." Harry brushed Draco's tears away, "Let me heal your arm for you." He sat Draco down and took out his wand.
"I should probably go." Draco was refusing to look at Harry, "Scorpius it's time to go." He shouted.
"Baby, Baby, baby! I need you to stop." Harry said.
"I remember now. You saved me." Draco tightened his grip on Harry. "Thank you."
"You shouldn't say that." I heard Hermione's voice say in my head. If she were here right now she'd tell me I have her and Ron, the Weasleys, and little Teddy. I didn't deserve them though. I could barely look at the Weasleys anymore, especially George. I took so much from them. As for Ron and Hermione It was my fault they had to grow up so fast. They never had a childhood because of me. I forced them to risk their lives every time they came back to Hogwarts, all because they were my closest friends.
"Anything love." Draco snuggled into Harry's chest and Harry wrapped his arm around him.
My dearest love,
"Oh god! Master!" He yelled. "Please let me cum!"
"Oh fuck! Please give it to me, Harry! I can take it!" Draco begged putting his ass in the perfect position.
"Let's go grab a drink!" Harry yelled over the music. They walked over to the bar and ordered their drinks. "You'll never guess who I saw before you showed up."
"Me too. Oh, fuck Harry!" Draco screamed as he followed, and all his tentacles released on and inside harry.
"I love you too, Harry." Draco said as he was trying not to cum.
"That's me." Draco said quietly.
"What the hell’s going on between you too?! I saw him kiss your fucking hand and now you're talking about him cumming inside of you and putting you on your knees? What the fuck Harry?!"  Ginny threw her duffel bag to the floor with a loud thud.
"He's not your husband anymore!" Harry finally lost a little bit of his temper, "And you're never going to see him again."
"Not as lucky as me." They smiled at each other. "So, what do you want to do?"
He sat on the tiled floor, broken mirror littering the floor, and bloody hand grasping a shard of glass as he pressed it to his wrist. I wrapped my hand around his fighting to take the shard away, but for how frail he was he was very strong.
"Thank you, Draco." Ron whispered. He looked a little defeated and I know my face showed my surprise.
"So, she won't let you see him at all?" Draco asked.
"With all my being, I've been crushing on you since we were in school." Harry gave Draco a small smile. Draco looked extremely happy, before a wave of sadness washed over his face.
He brought the paddle Down with a thwack. "One." Again, with another thwack, "two." Harry moaned again. Thwack! "Three!" Draco said. He sat the paddle down and stood Harry up by grabbing his throat and the back of his shirt.
"Haaaarry!" I saw the little 5-year-old push Draco out of the way and run full force in my direction. I couldn't control the smile on my face when I saw how happy he was to see me and crotched down taking him into my arms and lifting him off the floor.
"Can we go now!?" Teddy begged.
"It just suits you. You make a very good dom." Harry winked. "I wish I knew what you wanted to do to me back at Hogwarts."
"Well... Tadaaa!!! It's all yours!" Harry exclaimed, admiring his work while Draco admired his ass.
"I just got tired, I guess. One can only take so much violence for one lifetime, and I really do love teaching." Harry replied shaking his head to sort out his mind. "Why did you decide to become a healer?'
Draco blushed but put his face in his hand to hide it, "Yes." He sighed. He didn't want Harry to know he talked about him.
"Yes, Master?" Harry said quizzically.
"Excuse me, I'm looking for Healer Malfoy?" it said. Draco froze in fear.
"Why didn't you tell anyone." Draco laid his head on Harry’s chest.
"Thank you, Draco." I whispered into his shoulder. He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me in closer.
Draco shook his head and placed his hand on his son's shoulder. "Come on, bud. Lets let Harry enjoy the rest of his night."
"For your information, I've always cared, and I care even more now that he's my boyfriend!" Ron's jaw hit the floor and he was left speechless. Hermione was equally shocked but hid it well.
Trigger warning: Suicide attempt and blood
"I'd love to!" Harry ruffled Scorpius's hair.
Hungrily Harry attacked Draco's lips. Kissing him with so much lust it took Draco's breath away. Harry sucked Draco's lip into his mouth and lightly bit it making Draco whimper in pleasure. He took the opportunity to insert his tongue and taste every inch of Draco's mouth. Draco was loving every bit of it. Not many people dominated him like this, and it felt so good.
"Please don’t make me share you. Please quit your job."
"Yes, Draco?"
"I would love that, but what will I sleep in?" Harry chuckled.
"I'm fine. Food will help." Harry said stroking Draco's shoulder.
"I was just dreaming about you." He said. He almost laughed when Draco jumped but it hurt too much to move. His heart broke when he saw tears well up in Draco's eyes.
"And what did you call me?" Harry could hear Draco rummaging through a drawer as he spoke but no matter how he turned his head he couldn't see him.
"No, Draco, thank you. I-I didn't realize how much I needed you till now. Thank you for doing this, all of this." I couldn't stop myself from wrapping him in a tight hug and pressing my lips to his head as I whispered, "Of course harry, I would do anything for you, just please let me help you not to hurt anymore." I pulled my head away to gaze into his eyes. There was the faintest hint of a sparkle and it made my heart quiver. He nodded, and I took him back to bed.
"H-harry?" He felt a strange sensation in his chest at the sound of his name in Draco's voice. Draco grabbed his hand. "Where am I?"
"Holy fuck! That was so good!" Harry said nuzzling Draco's ear.
Murmurs and claps filled the hall as Harry pulled out his seat and sat down, lightly brushing Draco's Arm as he did so, sending tingles through Draco's body. He was staring at Harry with big eyes and as much as he tried, he couldn't pull away.
"The tree hit us hard enough that the car fell out of the tree, and Ron punched the accelerator, just before the tree wound up and tried to smash us with all its force! The car must have been angry with us because it ejected us and all our luggage out onto the grass then sped off into the forest." Harry laughed.
"Hello, this is Draco?" he answered.
"What?" Harry smiled against the top of Draco's head.
"Please come out. I thought you knew it was me." Harry put his head against the stall door.
"You're usually cumming deep inside me." Harry said huskily.
it was only a few hours till 4 so Draco did his hair and got dress in a baby blue T-shirt and some dark denim jeans. He decided to leave the house early knowing harry wouldn't mind, and Soon he was standing in front of 12 Grimmauld Place. He approached the front door, but before he could knock, he was pulled inside, pushed up against the way and kissed passionately.
"Thank you! It changes color! Want to see?" Teddy grinned excited to show someone what he could do.
"Of course." She left the room leaving Draco alone with Harry.
"How about Red's?" Draco said.
"Yes, you do. I want you to." Draco shivered and moved forward so Harry could get in behind him.
"What if I did?" Harry smiled. "What if I knew who you were and still liked you anyways?"
The doctor gave him a prescription and told him to check back in a couple weeks.
"Harry, I was so scared. Granma said I might not be able to see you for a long time." He pulled away and I looked at his sweet face, tears welling in his eyes. How could I do that to this sweet little boy? I asked myself. I forced the thoughts away and gave him my best smile.
"Yes, master. What are we going to do first?" Draco smirked at this question as he thought of all the things, he'd love to do to Harry.
The next morning Harry got up early and made breakfast he was just plating the food when Draco came down and wrapped his long arms around him from behind. The random display of affection made Harry's heart do a flip.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed excited to see him.
"I know, I know!" Harry laughed, "There's no way you're anything but Slytherin!" Harry exclaimed. It was the first time Harry had heard Draco genuinely laugh, and it felt great knowing that he was the cause.
"No! No, actually..." Harry paused.
"What's a matter Potter, too embarrassed to show me the goods." Draco mocked.
"May I speak to you alone, Narcissa?" Harry asked.
The next morning Harry awoke to Draco stirring. "Good morning, sweetheart." He said as he wiped dried tears from Draco's cheek. Scorpius was still fast asleep between them.
"Yeah, you just seem so different, and I can't quite put my finger on the reason why." The way Harry said this sent a shock through Draco's body and he let the smile on his face grow.
"Harry... I know you feel... responsible...for... Fred's..." He looked at his hands not able to finish his sentence, "But it wasn't your fault. He was fighting for a cause he believed in, a cause all of us believe in."
"You're not going to eat?" Harry asked with a concerned riddled expression.
"Hmm, You just called me Harry." Harry laughed as he stood up.
"I would like that very much." Harry said.
"Shhh shh baby. Its ok. I'm here, you're safe my love." Harry whispered as he wrapped his arms around Draco and stroked his hair.
"Good boy. Any more questions?"
"I'll stay, baby." Harry whispers.
It would be so easy. Its just a swallow away and Hermione will be here in a couple hours for my appointment, so she'll find my body. Tears started to poor from my eyes as I thought about her reaction. Merlin, could I do that to her. I have to do this. The thought took my breath away. I've decided, but she at least deserves an explanation. I pulled out a piece of parchment and started to write in my best penmanship. I wanted it to be clear, or maybe I was just trying to waist time.
Draco went pale and his eyes got wide as he realized he wasn’t the only one with a crush, "R-really?" He stuttered.
"I did but then I ran into Draco, and we got talking..."  Harry said but he was interrupted.
"Give it to me Harry!" Draco ordered. Harry slowly started slipping into Draco's hole. "Fuck, fuck,fuck, fuck. You're so big!" Draco moaned.
"I feel the same way." Harry nuzzled Draco's hair.
"You're so tight." Draco said as he began moving in and out. He curled his finger and found Harry's prostate. Harry pulled on his restraints and moaned loudly as he pushed against Draco's finger. "Mm yes you’re such a horny little slut. Do you want more potter?"
Harry put the food under a preservation charm and went upstairs with a wine glass. he entered the bathroom and had to stop for a moment. Draco look so sexy sitting naked in a claw-foot tub full of bubbles with his hair disheveled, his legs thrown over the side, and a glass of wine in his hand.
They walked down multiple hallways until they came to a door which Miguel unlocked with a skeleton key. The site before Harry sent a rage though out his body.
Harry smiled, "Gods, I hope so. I'd rather die than never see your perfect face ever again." with that he left leaving Draco smiling.
Draco couldn't hold out anymore. He waved his wand releasing the cock ring and both Harry and him road out their orgasms.
Draco began to cry. Harry wrapped his arms around him tighter and Draco laid his head on Harry's shoulder and wept.
"I love you too daddy.'' Scorpius snuggled into his bed as Draco began to leave the room turning off the lights behind him. "Daddy?" Scorp said before he closed the door."
I was completely at a lost for word. I had no idea he felt that way. I always though he felt the opposite.
"To be my dom. We had sex last night." Harry looked at the floor. He didn't want to see the tears that were starting to flow from Ginny's eyes.
"Miguel, I'm done! You don’t own me and I'm leaving!" Draco shouted.
"No." Draco said standing there with his head down.
"Ok I’ll get the groceries and be here around 5?"
Draco nearly spat out his drink, "Not even close!"
"okay, okay." They both flooed over.
I watched the clock tick. They would be here in 30 minutes, and I'd be lying if I said I was excited. I wanted to throw up but gulped down my nerves not wanting to waist the amazing breakfast Draco had made.
"The tentacle part was a but weird but..." Harry pushed Draco to the bed and kissed him, "it was an amazing dream." He smiled.
Draco let out a deep sigh and slid the glass over to Harry, "I was disowned by my family."
Draco le out a sharp cry as I finally found his sensitive spot and I began to repeatedly pound into it. I felt heat pooling in my stomach as my orgasm began to pool.
"Dear gods, the things you do to me." He whispered against my skin and he began to bite and suck a sensitive spot on my skin, surely leaving his mark.
"Bacon and eggs. There's coffee too, if you want some." Draco said turning around and wrapping his arms around Harry. He leaned down and kissed Harry gently. "How'd you sleep."
"You can take it." Draco removed his fingers and lined up his cock. He slid it in harder than he wanted to, making Harry arch his back and scream. He gripped Harry's throat lightly and made him bend backwards a bit so he could whisper in his ear. "Are you okay?" He asked.
"Maybe. I'm not going to say." Harry winked.
"You're just so fucking sexy!" Harry exclaimed. He walked over and poured himself a glass of wine, topping off Draco's as well.
Draco scoffed and turned to leave but Miguel snapped his fingers and two very large men blocked his way and took his wand.
"Well, if you must know," Draco looked down at his feet, "I came out as gay, and Father is against that so I was kicked out onto the streets, and I couldn't get work in the wizarding world thanks to the... you know. So, I got this job. Could be worse, I guess. at least it pays the bills." Draco laughed again when he looked up and saw Harry’s shocked face. "What? don't tell me you hate gays too?" He rolled his eyes.
"Y-yes master." Harry stuttered.
"Uh, I was thinking like a model, or a movie star." Harry hoped that was a good enough save.
Draco pauses for a minute. He wasn't sure if he loved Harry. He had obsessed over him all through school, but he wasn't sure if the feelings he had for him were love. Then again, he didn't think he had ever felt love. Maybe a little from his mother, not romantic love.
"Perfect. can we surprise Scorp?" Draco yawned.
"Yay!" Scorpius exclaimed. Draco hid another small smile, but harry noticed it.
Harry's POV
"you've killed him." He said standing up from his position.
"The underground, this is Zachary speaking. How may I help you?" Said the voice on the other side.
"I'll have fire whiskey on the rocks." Draco ordered, "Harry?" As Harry went to speak Draco reached into his pocket and pushed a button.
Scorpius looked to Harry to save him, "listen to your father. We can play more some other time."
"w-what are you doing here?"
"One more finger. I don't want to hurt you." Harry slid his fingers back into Draco's hole adding the last one and scissoring him open. When he was satisfied, he grabbed some extra lube and slicked up his cock.
Three days passed since I went and saw him in the hospital, and it was finally the day he was to be released. Hermione and Ron were picking him up while I made a few final preparations to my guest room. Removing anything that might be used to cause harm to himself and making sure he would have anything he might need.
"Oh, and I supposed you automatically volunteered, Mr. must save everyone." He noticed Harry's hurt expression.
He was just getting ready to take a shower when his phone rang, but he didn't recognize this number.
"Thank you!" Harry said.
"That's ok, you're cute." Draco smiled.
Harry felt something being wrapped around his cock.
"Why!? Since when do you care?!" Ron said still yelling.
"Now lay on the bed." Draco ordered as soon as Harry was finished putting away his clothes.
"Do you know what day it is?" He said kissing my forehead.
"No, thank you." Draco replied, "is he going to make it?"
"What is it, dear?" Draco asked pouring the wine. Harry smiled at the pet name.
"Just a minute." came a very familiar voice. Draco stood there with wide eyes hoping he hadn't heard it and thinking about running. He'd be fired for sure, though so he stayed and waited for what felt like forever but was merely a few seconds. Soon the door opened revealing exactly what he feared but more cut and handsome also dressed in a well-fitting tux that show the beautiful curvature of hid fit body he now wore a short well-kept beard and contacts, but his dark messy hair and emerald green eyes still remained the same.
"It's my ex! Pansy called me today and told me she heard he was out of jail." Draco was shaking. "I'm so scared, Harry? If he's out he's going to come after Scorpius and me."
"Hi, sweety." Harry said as he kissed his shoulder.
He opened his front door and walked in with griffin still in his arms. He went to his bedroom and placed the chunky cat on his bed where griffin started kneeling his blanket.
Harry's mind continued to think all through his work as an Auror, but it was interrupted by his boss strolling into his office towards the end of the day.
Ginny and him didn't talk for three days. It wasn't till Harry got a random phone call after work. Ginny had just got home and Harry hadn't heard her come in.
It's just too heavy. Please make sure He's taken care of... since I couldn't. Hermione, I'm so sorry the guilt is eating me away. I don't want to see their faces every time I close my eyes. This is what I deserve.
I was just finishing up by placing the last of his clothes in the dresser when there was a knock on the door. I opened it revealing a smiling Hermione, a skeptical looking Ron and an incredibly frail looking Harry. Never have I been so thrilled and yet so heartbroken in my life. I was over the moon knowing the man I had been in love with for years would be under my roof where I could protect him, but the sight of him before me now completely shattered my heart.
Harry pushed Draco onto the bed and climbed on top of him. He leaned close to Draco's ear and whispered, "I'm going to savor this." Draco moaned as Harry started moving his hips rubbing their cocks together through their trousers. Draco threw his head back and bit his lip.
"Yes." I replied in a loud whisper as well, not letting my eyes leave Draco's face. He smiled, and I giggled as it was the first time, I had ever seen him blush. It was by far the most gorgeous thing I had ever seen.
I love all of you, always.
"I want to be with you. I'm done being alone and I want to take you on." Draco couldn't stop smiling. There was just silence for quite a while. "Harry?" Draco asked.
"Hmm, didn't expect that." Harry ran a hand through his hair.
It took a minute but Draco calmed down and finished his story. "I didn't even have time to reach Scorpius who was screaming in pain on the floor. He was back on top of me choking the life out of me, while my son watched."
If this had happened years ago, I would have panicked, but instead and smile crept across my face and I rolled over pressing my face to the firm chest beside me. I felt Draco begin to stir.
"He was hit by an unknown curse. It's making it hard for us to heal him completely. He has multiple broken ribs, lacerations, bruising, and trauma to the brain and several of his other organs. The doctors are doing everything they can to help him. He's been in a coma since we found him." The nurse said a kindly as she could. "Can I get you anything?"
"H-has Hermione and Ron given up on me?" I asked panic increasing inside me again. What had I done to them? No! How could I do this to them?!
"F-fuck." He gasped.
Draco took his seat at the Professors' table. It had been 13 years since the war and, while he enjoyed being a healer at St. Mungo's, he was thrilled to get Headmaster McGonagall's letter asking him to train under Madam Pomphrey and become Hogwarts’s new Matron.
"No Problem! Have a great day!" then the both hung up.
Draco turned so he was on his knees with his hands on the tub behind Harry, so he could look into Harry's eyes. Harry looked surprised, as he moved his hands to Draco's waist.
Hermione calls the only person she thinks can save Harry, Draco.
"I love you so much, Harry." Draco said as he kissed Harry's nose
"I didn't think so." Harry lifted Draco's face gently.
The minute Harry sat down, a cushion away from Draco, Griffin got up and moved to Harry's lap where he curled up and stared at Draco.
"Harry, no!" Ron yelled.
Harry's POV
"I promise, Scorpius, He's not going to get anywhere near you or your father. I'm going to protect you both." Harry held onto both of them and let them cry until Scorpius fell asleep in his arms. "Let's get you both to bed." He whispered.
"I know but I didn't think he was capable of it either until we were married." Draco was crying so hard he could barely breath.
"Guess I'll have to show you." Draco smirked.
"Draco, I’m so sorry. I promised I'd protect you and he still found a way to hurt you. I'm so sorry." Tears were starting to well up in his eyes too. "Tomorrow, I'll go talk to St. Mungo's security and see if they can keep him out of the building. I'm so sorry, love."
Dinner was perfect. They had some wine and talked about everything they could think of. On the way home Harry told Draco about Teddy, and how he was in a custody battle with Andromeda over him.
"Oh my god!" Draco whispered. He was slowly getting hard again already.
"So why don't you?" Harry asked.
"Draco, I need it, please!" Harry cried. Draco started to push in just the tip. Just enough to tease and prepare harry. He began working in more and more till harry was a moaning mess. It felt amazing to have something so tight around him. The tentacle was so sensitive, and he discovered he didn’t need to pump, he could just force blood through it and make it pulsate in a way let left both men grunting and moan and clawing at each other.
Harry had never been happier.
Draco sat down on the couch, Harry handed him his glass of wine and sat down next to him. Draco took a big gulp then curled up under Harry's arm.
It felt like Harry's heart had exploded. he couldn't breathe for a second. "Draco, you’ve made me the happiest man in the universe. I love you too." He brushed Draco's cheek, and Draco brought their lips together. It was a slow but passionate kiss that left them both gasping for air. Draco moved Harry's legs so he could straddle Harry's thighs. Harry felt Draco's erection bush his leg and it turned him on even more. Draco started kissing and biting Harry's ear, making Harry moan.
"No, master." Harry replied.
"I'd like that very much, and I just so happen to have the next two days off. I can spend the whole time with you if you'd like." Draco said.
"An Auror is going to hex an innocent man?" Ommin chortled.
"A surprise?! Daddy, you never do surprises!" Scorpius exclaimed. Just the fireplace roared, turning bright green, and out stepped Harry carry several grocery bags full of food. "Harry?! What are you doing here?!"
"Ye....ssssss." He hit the button before Harry could finish his sentence.
"Y-yes." He moaned once he felt me against him. I began to push inside him, and he screwed his eyes shut and bit his lips.
"So, what are we going to do this weekend, Harry!?" Teddy was jumping up and down.
"I love how you feel against me." Harry whispered.
Harry was really netbooks now. "Well... I kind of wanted to see if he'd go on a date with me." He said rubbing the back of his neck and looking away.
"D-Draco, I'm s-so s-sorry." He said between sobs. "I don't know w-what h-happened."
Harry slowly sucked the tip into his cheek while using his tongue on the underside of Draco's cock.
He laid there panting trying to keep himself from spilling over.
"Why do you have to be so irresistible?" Draco asked letting his dominance slip just a little. Before Harry could say anything, he felt something being inserted into his ass. He moaned as it pressed against his prostate perfectly. Draco stood and pulled up Harry's pants.
"H-harry..." Draco tried to say "P-please... I-I need..."
"if I do or say anything uncomfortable or too painful you can say the safe word. The safe word is snitch. Repeat that to me."
"Who was that?" Ginny glared as she walked into the bedroom.
"What!? Why!? You've been after him since we were kids! Why the hell would you say no!?" Pansy screeched.
"P-please harry." He begged. I continued and let my erection spring up out of my now discarded boxers. Draco stood from the bed and in a swift motion pulled me against him capturing my lip.
"Because you're with someone, and I don't know if you'd want me." Draco said sadly.
"Harry, I don't know if I love you, I’ll say it when I'm sure, but I know I have strong feelings for you."
"You're so tight." I said as I bit his shoulder. I took every ounce of control I had not to start thrusting.
"Harry?" I said gently, and I touched his shoulder. He continued to stare at his shoes. "Would you like me to show you to your room, so you can rest?" He silently ponders for a moment before nodding and I led him to the guest room leaving Ron and Hermione in the kitchen.
Harry pulled him in close and whispered into his ear "Dray, I'd love to show you." Draco let out a shaky breath as Harry's lips ghosted over his ear and down his jaw before they were pressed passionately to his. Harry pushed him against the wall off the entry way and slid his hand down Draco's sides, making him moan against his lips. He took the opportunity to slip his tongue inside and explore his mouth. Draco's long slender fingers began to twirl in Harry's hair driving him crazy.
He was scared to ask, but he wanted to know how someone could make Draco Malfoy afraid of his own shadow.  "What did he do to you, love?"
"Well I was wondering if you'd go on a date with me?" Harry asked finally finding his Gryffindor courage.
"How so?" Harry kind of understood what she meant but he wasn't sure he was right.
"Suck." He ordered as he presented his fingers. Harry felt his cock start to twitch as he took Draco's cum drenched fingers into his mouth and tasted himself.
Harry started to slowly go deeper and deeper till Draco's cock hit the back of his throat. He quickly took It out of his mouth and coughed.
"H-harry..." He moaned.
"Yes please, I feel so much safer when you are around." Draco snuggled against harry chest and Harry squeezed him tightly.
"No, actually I was told I'd be best for the job by the nurses." Harry spoke calmly and now Draco felt bad for his sharp tongue.
Draco kissed Scorpius's forehead, "Goodnight, I love you."
"Do you need me to come be with him while you're at work?" Hermione asked watching as Ron changed his mind and, also, helped himself to some coffee.
"Yep," Harry nodded, "Well he made it so me and Ron couldn't get onto the platform, so we stole Ron's dad's enchanted car! At one point we almost got hit by the Hogwarts express. When we made it to Hogwarts, we crashed into the Whomping willow. Ron was so scared he broke his wand! So, there we are sitting on top the Whomping willow, without a clue as the what tree we just landed in, and it starts pounding on us from every angle!" Harry was getting animated now. Draco loved seeing this side of Harry and couldn't stop himself from smiling and watching his every move.
That night Draco couldn't sleep again so he grabbed his phone and called pansy.
Harry sat down next to Draco and took his hand, "Draco, Ommin, He is free. He somehow managed to slip through the cracks in the ministry."
"ah, ah, ah, my turn, mister." Harry tsked with a wink. "Why are you an escort."
Draco scooted close to him and cupped his face so he could look at the dazzling emeralds, "Harry I wish you would have told me." He slowly and gently brought their lips together. it was a slow sweet kissed that still brought out all they had held back for so many years. Draco’s finger wound themselves into Harry’s hair and Harry's arm wrapped around Draco's waits bringing them in closer till they were laying on the couch.
"How so?" Harry closed his eyes and marveled in the way Draco's skin felt against his.
"Really?" Harry wouldn't admit that made him a little happy, "How do you know?"
"Well... You could just sleep in you boxers. I promise I won’t do anything." Draco winked.
"Yeah you've been my biggest crush since the day I laid eyes on you." Harry took another swig of his whiskey and refused to look up.
"Good boy." Draco couldn't remove his gazed from Harry's body.
"Oh honey, you've just had your first taste." Draco took a sip of his coffee.
"Harry?" He heard Draco whisper.
He started to slice into his skin even with my hand fighting to keep him from doing it.
"Pants too, Potter." Draco ordered.
"I thought you were going out with coworkers?" Ginny grilled.
"You did so good. You were amazing." Draco whispered in his ear.
"I need you Harry. Please wake up." Draco started to cry again.
I blushed a deep crimson, "Draco, why do you say things like that?" I asked still hiding my face in his shirt. He cupped my cheek and tilted my head, so I'd look at him.
"Who?"
"Damn that's an amazing ass." He thought to himself. "Excuse me, can I get some whiskey?" He asked politely. He was shocked when the bar tender dropped the glass he was holding and froze for a minute. Harry's eyes went wide as the bar tender turned around and he was met with the piercing grey eyes he'd dreamt about for years.
"Say I'm beautiful, or perfect? I'm far from, and even I was why do you care." He could notice the tears forming in the corners of my eyes, so he began to stroke my hair.
Harry thought he could feel his heart breaking. He was sure Draco had felt everything he had, but Maybe he had been wrong. He was so confused. He decided to sleep on it.
"Visitors!?" he said sitting up quickly in bed.
After Harry regained his composure, he felt the tingling sensation again.
"You just called me 'Harry'" Harry said still smiling. Draco's cheeks turned pink again. "I love making you blush, its cute."
After Harry left Draco decided he wanted a bath, so he went upstairs and magically filled the tub. Complete with color changing bubbles. Then he poured himself a glass of wine and got in.
"I would love to." I said as I held teddys sleepy body. I went to hand him to her, but he gripped my neck.
"Yes, master." Harry said as his eyes met Draco's. He finally reached the last button on his shirt and slowly slid it off.
"Sorry I was too excited." Harry laughed.
"Merlin Draco, You're so beautiful." He said as he eyed every inch of Draco's now naked body.
"No, I do like you. I've liked you since I first saw you. It's just..."tears began to well up in Draco's eyes. "I'm scared."
I looked down trying to hide the tears forming in my eyes.
"Yes." Draco rolled his eyes and laughed.
Harry apparated to the club and walked through it like he owned the place. He was so confident and excited. He reached room 202 and knocked on the door.
"I told you it would be hotter if we waited till this moment." Draco giggled. "Fuck Harry." He moaned as Harry found his sweet spot.
"Yes, master." Harry said wishing he hadn't teased Draco so he could be touched.
Harry laughed, "That didn't exactly work out all that great." He put his hand on Draco's without realizing it.
"What?! There's no way?!"
"Can you tell me how I might reach Draco? I need to ask him something." Harry requested.
"Oh... uh sorry Dray." Harry reluctantly rolled off the skinny blonde. He couldn't help but love how he felt beneath him and had to throw his robe over the crotch of his pants. Draco didn't notice because he was busy doing the same.
"I missed you." He whispered.
Draco kissed Harry's head and picked griffin up. "I can't wait. See you tomorrow, Harry."
"Of course... Daddy." He laughed again, and I let out a growl in mock frustration, only to start laughing with him.
Draco took a breath and found his strength.
Draco's POV
"You sit that fine ass down. I'm making you dinner, remember?" Harry ordered.
"I wouldn't have asked you to sit down if I wasn't." Draco took a sip of his drink.
"F-fuck!" He said as he laid his head against the pillow.
He cast a quick tempus charm and realized it was 3 in the morning, he had been tossing and turning for 5 hours. He couldn't take it anymore, so he got up and threw on some lounge pants, then left his room.
"But who was the guy?"
Harry knelt Infront of him and place Draco’s face in his hands so he could look onto his eyes. " You did nothing to deserve this my love. This is all they're fault."
"Y-yes master." Harry stuttered.
The day went by rather slow and soon he had to go to work. All throughout work he waited for Harry to call. Constantly checking his phone every chance, he got, but it never rang. By the time he got home he was a nervous wreck. Every bad thought he could think of ran through his head. he tried to go to bed, telling himself that Harry would call tomorrow.
"Will you stay tonight?" Draco asked, looking up at him with pleading eyes.
The next day Harry couldn't wait any longer so he showed up nearly an hour early. He knocked on the door and was surprised when a shirtless, messy haired Draco answered the door.
"And what type do you think I look like." Draco said side eyeing Harry.
"You may only speak when spoken to. If you have questions save them for when I ask for them, and I will ask for them." Draco took another sip of his whiskey.
Draco dreaded for 8'o'clock to roll around. A part of him wanted to see Harry, almost craved it, but the other part of him was so scared to let somebody in. He didn't want Harry to see his weak side like he had the night before. He was now sitting in the living room, bracing himself for Harry arrival and drinking his third cup of wine.
With a yell Draco came all over his and Harry's stomach. "Please cum inside me baby!"
I was standing over his body. His angelic white skin now covered in blood. He wasn't breathing, and soon Snape was pushing me away and kneeling by his side.
"Who's this daddy?" The little boy asked.
"That was so much better than I've ever dreamed." Harry said still out of breath.
I took him in my hand as I began licking circles on his hip giving a little nip every now and then.
"As ready as ever I suppose." He got up and I stood a few feet down the hall as he opened the door.
"Well we tracked down a couple of death eater that are still very loyal to you know who. They’re not going to come easy, and they're known for being dangerous. You'll be risking your life on this one." His boss said.
"Well..." Hermione tried to say but looked like she was having a hard time finding the question. Pansy placed a hand on her knee and proceeded to speak for her.
"Morning." I whispered.
"Come on guys! The tacos won't make themselves!" They heard Scorpius yell from the kitchen.
"Harry, I need you now!" Draco moaned loudly.
"Yes?" Harry said as he looked deep into Draco's eye. He could see tears starting to form in the corners and he was shocked.
"Do it baby! Cum all over my face!" That tipped Draco over the edge and he came splattering warmth all over Harry's face. Draco went to say that was hot but before he could Harry did a verbal cleaning spell on his face and flipped Draco over. Before He could comprehend what was happening, he felt his cheeks being spread and something warm and wet teasing his hole.
"H-Harry, I've never felt anything like this. In my life there's been nothing but heartache and pain, and I don't know if I can face it again. My life has been so lonely. I don't know what this feeling is, but I want to know. I want to know what love is, and I want you to show me." He finally let his eyes meet Harry's. They seemed sad but there was something more there. Something he hoped Harry would help him to understand.
"H-harry... Oh Gods!"
"Yes, master."  Harry said. Draco raised his wand and the ropes wrapped themselves around Harry's arms and legs locking him in place. He felt Draco's hands move along his back and down to his ass. He felt Draco grab the vibrator and slowly pull it out. He moaned as he did.
"Not anymore!"
"Draco this is Granger." his stomach did a flip. If Granger was calling something must have happened to Harry.
"Oh." Harry said and they sat in silence for a few moments. "I should get going. I have an early morning tomorrow." Harry got up and started to leave.
Today Harry was taking Draco to the hospital again to test for any std's. Draco was incredibly nervous. He couldn't stop fidgeting the whole way there.
