“Oh, stop it, you idiot,” Draco chided fondly, but made no attempt to move Harry and looked incredibly smug as he craned around him to look at everyone else. “Well, you all look
an arsehole,” Harry hissed as his cock responded eagerly to Draco’s tongue and Draco chuckled, pulling back with a glint in his eye.
“Why, don’t you like them?” Draco pouted, staring down at his own shimmer-dusted chest before looking back at Harry with feigned sadness, kohl-lined eyes sparkling with mirth.
thinking about the amount of time I spent in my youth with your tongue in my mouth. And speak for yourself, my gay heart is fucking
” Draco gushed, beaming as he glanced back through the wards. “I’ve never felt so...Merlin, I don’t even know. Exhilarated? Happy? I didn’t expect it to be like this at all- why the fuck didn’t you bring me sooner?”
It was Harry’s turn to throw a bottle of juice at him, scoffing when he caught it without even looking.
,” Pansy drawled, the sting of her words softened by her flushed cheeks and happy smile as she flopped down onto the grass beside them.
. But after eight years, I’d expect you to have known that before you asked me. You know I like to take charge.”
,” Pansy groaned, prizing their faces apart with her hands, “but can you please stop devouring each other before I get so insanely turned on I join you or, Heaven forbid, start shagging Blaise?”
He’d done many terrifying things during his lifetime- faced an army of giant spiders, killed a bloody big snake under a school bathroom,
“We don’t have room for a big one,” Draco said with a scoff, but Harry could tell his defences were beginning to crumble.
He snapped his own eyes from Draco’s to where his fingers were leaving purple bruises on his skin, and then back again.
The steady, sultry music rose to a crescendo, where it broke, as did Harry’s restraint. Releasing a hand from Draco's waist, he slid it into his hair, tugging his head far enough back so that he could smash their lips together. Harry heard Draco groan as he thrust his tongue inelegantly between his plump, glossy lips, and Draco surged against him, kissing back with just as much force. In retaliation, he bit down, feeling Draco’s bottom lip crunch under his teeth.
- Draco was coming to Pride, and not just ‘in spirit’ like usual; he’d confirmed (somewhat begrudgingly) the night before that he ‘
He knew Draco had waited his whole life for this, had been preparing for his wedding since before he could walk, had given up all hope of it ever happening after the war because he didn’t think anyone would- or could- ever love him enough.
Thrusting lightly- to Draco’s contentment, if the happy little hum was anything to go by- he gripped the sink behind Draco’s head, orgasm building rapidly. His arms shook from the self-control it was taking not to slam his hips forward, to fuck Draco’s mouth like he so desperately wanted to; instead he continued to roll his hips gently, watching, wide-eyed and slightly dizzy, as his cock disappeared in-between Draco’s reddened lips.
‘You said you didn’t know what to wear, and I bought them with you in mind, obviously, so it seemed like a good idea...you don’t
As if summoned by his maudlin thoughts, Ron- a very hairy, very wolf-like Ron- appeared, sausage roll in one hand, cocktail glass in the other. This, he offered to Harry, who took it readily.
with arousal, and the overwhelming impulse to yank his trousers down and have one off in the middle of the kitchen was so strong he had to shut his eyes, taking deep breaths to calm his racing heart.
“You remember what happened the last time you said that, right?” Harry chuckled, hooking a finger into the waistband on Draco’s shorts.
I love it when you get like this, but maybe not when we're on a tight schedule, ok? Save it for later.”
She smiled, squeezing him back. “Thank you for letting us come,” she said softly, and he rolled his eyes.
His chest heaved, mirroring Harry’s own, seemingly unbothered by their half nakedness- his cock jutted out proudly, which, despite his confusion, Harry still wanted to drop to his knees and swallow down to the root.
“Harry, Ron’s got the backpack if you need to take anything,” Hermione said, interrupting him as he subtly attempted to adjust himself in his jeans, “and I’ve packed a first aid kit in mine…is there anything else we need? Has everyone got water? Oh God, I hope we’ve got enough food, maybe I should have-“
Harry hummed in agreement, looking for Draco and panicking slightly when he couldn’t find him. “You think I don’t know that?”
And not only had Draco entered he room in hot pants, gliding down the stairs and through the open door like a fucking supermodel- because of
sorry” he chuckled, giving Draco another- very brief- kiss, which he reciprocated without complaint. “Are you feeling ok?”
were snogging in the Gryffinodor common room, the two weirdo blondes across the castle would be the ones to eventually capture our little gay hearts.”
“Fuck, Draco, I can’t—” voice breaking, Harry released the grip he had on Draco’s chest to wrap a hand around his neck, forcing his head up so that their eyes remained connected in the mirror, splaying his fingers across Draco’s slender throat to hold him in place.
And then this morning...well, Harry couldn't deny that his excitement had made him a little more enthusiastic than usual, but that could only be expected from a man finally getting his way after seven years of failed attempts.
Signalling to Hermione that the wards were all sorted, Harry flopped onto the bench they’d found on a small patch of greenery to the left of the parade, taking a swig of water and trying to find Draco in the crowd.
Harry hummed in agreement and Draco smiled again- wide and bright and so, so perfect that a part of Harry wished he wouldn’t so he could remember how to breathe.
“You sure know the way to a man’s heart, Harry,” she sighed wistfully, her hand pressed dramatically to her chest.
He felt dizzy, harder than he had ever been in his life, and Draco knew, if the smirk Harry caught a glimpse of when he tossed his head back onto Harry’s shoulder was anything to go by.
Draco spun them to an abrupt stop, sliding his arms around Harry’s neck, drawing them close together. Sliding a long, heeled leg between Harry’s, he began to undulate slowly in time to the music, light fingers playing with the hair at Harry’s nape.
. His near-tirade was thwarted with a pointed look from Hermione, who’d settled a placating hand on his arm and appeared to be reading from an invisible textbook.
He grabbed Harry by the upper arm, yanking him away from the mantle and towards the middle of the room, not glancing back as Harry tripped over his own feet in his haste to follow, or giving him the opportunity to refuse. Not that he was planning on it anyway, because his cock practically sung with excitement at their proximity, Draco’s grip on his arm soothing his prickling skin. At that moment he knew, without a doubt, that he would do anything Draco wanted him to.
“I’ve been trying to get your attention for half a century, what’s been up with you today? You keep drifting off.’
He stepped back, summoning his wand and handing it to Harry, who stuffed it into his back pocket with his own. He slipped his hand into Draco’s, squeezing lightly before disapparating them both with a loud crack.
After patting Harry on the shoulder, she led Ginny away, leaving him to round on his baffled- but somehow still smug- boyfriend.
“Oh, does it now?” Draco laughed, voice catching slightly as Harry began to massage his arse, ninety-nine percent sure their friends were no longer watching and not really caring if they were. “Well, if you don’t stop, we’ll both end up
Harry grinned, looking over at Draco. He and Luna seemed to be shouting at Seamus and Dean, who were stumbling over each other's feet in what Harry assumed to be a dance.
“What was the first?” He laughed, not bothered in the slightest as he looked between the two of them.
Thick cobwebs had been draped over every bookshelf, small tables laden with flickering pumpkins, the ceiling swirling with dark, enchanted storm clouds. Red candles cast a low, warm glow over the room and its occupants, who swarmed in front of him, a colourful sea of unidentifiable people. The air buzzed with sound; guests were drinking, laughing, dancing (although that was just one woman, her leaf-tangled blonde hair sweeping the floor as she spun), their identities obscured by scarily realistic, magically enhanced costumes.
“Do you…do you think he’ll say yes?” He asked hesitantly after a moment, pulling his eyes from Draco when Ron scoffed. He was looking at Harry as if he’d lost his last brain cell, rolling his eyes with exasperation when Harry said nothing.
Chuckling to himself, he pressed a light kiss to Harry’s lips. “Come on then, Potter, let’s not be late."
“The spell! Whatever spell, or curse, you’ve put on me, to make me- to make me feel like this, to make me
.” He punctuated his words with a hard press against Draco’s prostate, earning a sharp cry from him. Harry leant forward, bracing himself against the sink, his other arm pumping so quickly Draco’s arse began to lift.
“I do, I promise, God, of course I promise. I can’t live without you, not again, not ever- fuck, Draco, it was so hard, I didn’t think it was possible to miss someone so much, to wake up and fall asleep every day aching with it and—”
,’ he shouted, making Draco jump slightly, pushing his hair back from his face and gesturing wildly, “because otherwise this doesn’t make sense. I was fine, Draco, I
“Yeah, he’s just getting ready,” Harry replied, standing and running a hand through his hair. “At least I
Ron huffed a small, derisive laugh, not looking at Harry as he valiantly tried to swallow the lump in his throat.
“Not happening again, my dear,” Blaise called and Pansy winked at him over Draco’s shoulder, making a crude gesture with her hands.
“Oh, shut up, you jealous bint, just because you can’t decide who’s bits you want to settle down with.”
“Hello, love,’ she greeted, kissing him on the cheek, her large Georgian-style wig wobbling precariously. “I think you look very handsome. Not at
Draco reached out a hand, fingertips brushing Harry's cheek shakily before coming to rest against his lips, their eyes locking.
“Are you ok?” Harry shouted over his shoulder, looking around when Draco didn’t reply. He seemed transfixed, unaware that Harry was watching him, eyes wide and astonished as he took in their surroundings. His hand was limp in Harry’s, barely holding onto his fingers as he twisted around to follow the parade moving down the centre of the street, stumbling in his attempt to see absolutely everything at once.
“Whoa, whoa, hey!” Harry laughed as Draco flung his arms around Harry’s neck, kissing him so hard he felt his glasses crunch against his nose. He pushed his hips against Harry’s until he got the hint and slid both hands under Draco’s arse, hoisting him up into the air; he wrapped his bare legs around Harry’s waist, lips soft but insistent as they slid against Harry’s, making a small noise of contentment. He tasted sweet, like candyfloss and pumpkin juice and Harry couldn't help but groan softly, palms squeezing Draco’s arse.
She cackled- fitting, really- and adjusted the pointy black hat on her head. “Oh, isn’t it funny! Why the hell do Muggles think we wear these? I was going to do the nose too- you know, all long and warty- but Luna said it reminded her too much of Snape.”
He’d looked even more pleased when- half an hour later- he’d been fucked so thoroughly against the bedroom wall (in celebration, obviously) that Harry had carried him to bed to prevent him from collapsing, despite it being less than three meters across the room.
"Gee, thanks love," he chuckled, and before Harry could say anything he was tackled from behind, stumbling forward as Ginny grabbed him round the neck and roughly messed up his hair with her spare hand.
He broke the kiss, gazing at Harry slightly dazed, before glancing down. “Oh. Your hero cock didn’t come.”
Checking no one but Ron was watching, he summoned the tiny black box from his pocket, enlarging it so that it sat neatly in his palm. He gently prized it open, heart clenching when the three round diamonds sparkled up at him. He tilted the box slightly so that the three smaller alexandrite gemstones he’d had set underneath shone through, creating an effect so beautiful Harry was sure the Muggle jeweller had used a tiny bit of magic.
“The more you think about it, the more you’ll psych yourself out. This is the perfect opportunity to do it- the sun's out, we’re here, Draco’s in a brilliant mood...go
‘You’re awful. I don’t know why I talk to you,” Harry grumbled, but his eyes were automatically drawn to Draco’s arse and, much to his own embarrassment, he began to mentally undress him on the spot.
, then- I would never cast anything on you, you know that, not to this extent anyway. Not only would that be a complete breach of your trust, of your privacy, Merlin, of your
Luna smiled at him in a way that suggested she thought he was being incredibly slow, playing with Ginny’s hand on her shoulder. “We were accessing our magical cores, Harry, the most natural, primitive aspect of our beings. Surely you understand that materialistic items such as clothing would have hindered the process…I didn’t realise you had such a problem with nudity.“
His chest heaved, mind whirling, unsure of his next move now that they were alone; could feel the spell mingling uncomfortably with the blood pumping through his veins.
A heartbeat, two, and then something unspoken passed between them. Harry stumbled forward into Draco’s arms, which held him tight as a single tear rolled down his cheek, more threatening to overspill, everything he’d refused to feel for the last few months crashing down on him like a ton of bricks.
Ron’s eyes widened for a second, and then he scowled. “I’d forgotten about that. If you weren’t pregnant with
, like millions upon millions of tiny needles were puncturing his heart, a large fist crushing his lungs, making it near impossible to breathe. His hand dropped from Draco’s throat to his shoulder, desperate to hold onto him because fuck, he never wanted to let him go.
is, I don’t need a banner to show the world how I feel about you, and vice versa.” He sighed, looking apologetic as Harry’s brow furrowed. “I think it’s wonderful, Harry- I do, truly- and I’m glad you enjoy it so much, but it’s just not for me.”
Draco’s head snapped up as he came, Harry covering his lips with his own to muffle his shouts, hips bucking wildly as he painted their shirts with streaks of white liquid, staining the light material.
liked, rather- and he twirled the silver pendant with one hand, chatting animatedly to Pansy, his head thrown back on a laugh every thirty seconds.
his answer was, and Harry almost couldn't blame him. It really was breathtaking, the alexandrite's effect subtle- which strangely made it feel all the more special- yet beautiful, and Harry snapped the lid shut before he started sobbing like a fool over the damn thing.
“Checking out Draco’s arse again, Harry?” Ginny asked, appearing from nowhere to clap him on the back. “I’m not surprised, it looks-“
“I know, gorgeous. Maybe next time don’t kiss me like your life is depending on it when we’re surrounded by so many people?”
He heard someone gasp as he opened the ring box but couldn’t take his eyes from Draco, who was still stood happily watching the parade and oblivious to the commotion happening all around him.
” Draco cried breathlesly a few seconds later, “Harry, what the fuck, we’re engaged! To be married!”
Draco took an overly long sip of his smoking cocktail, eyes never leaving Harry’s, before placing it down on the mantle behind him, tongue tracing his top lip. To Harry’s horror, his traitorous eyes tracked the movement, and Draco’s lips quirked.
rare- so no I did not spell them white. They are white. You can’t cast spells on clothes this expensive. Well, you probably would- but you shouldn’t.” He sighed dramatically, twisting in Harry’s arms so they were facing each other once again, before leaning in close, soft, pink lips just mere centimetres from Harry’s.
Draco looked at him for a second longer before kissing him again, standing and picking his mug up off the table.
“We were teaching those two how to do a proper quickstep,” Draco said, nodding at Seamus and Dean, who- despite Harry’s limited dance knowledge- did not look like they were doing a proper quickstep at all. They were swaying on the spot, Dean’s hands in Seamus’ back pockets as they murmured quietly to one another, exchanging soft kisses that made Harry feel like an intruder. “Or at least trying to,” he added with a chuckle, looking back at Harry. “You two have been having fun?”
“Well it is basically the same every single year,” Harry justifies, “and by now everyone has grown tired of the fact that ‘Harry Potter the Savior’ is teaching their class, so I don’t even have to deal with the weird staring and the repetitive questions about my life.”
“Well, we could always go out and play if you want,” Draco offered, and he received a sweet smile from Harry.
“We will be starting this year off with some practical learning,” Harry says, gesturing to the cabinet that was standing at the front of the class, “Can anybody tell me what this is?”
The Great Hall erupts into applause and is soon taken over by the chatter of friends catching up and people eating.
“We have the quidditch game at the end of the week, maybe we could get our jerseys changed to Malfoy-Potter,” Scorpius offers.
“Well, it makes sense, you two have been doing this for almost 9 years, it makes sense that at this point you wouldn’t need much thought to do it,” Draco realizes another similarity between his husband and his kids, “like how your Dad can do his magic without even moving.”
And with that Albus stood up and left, he had eaten enough and as much as he was fine with people knowing, he likes making his friends wait to hear the truth.
“Well, you will each have 2, one with each of your father’s,” McGonagall says, “if anyone knows how to straighten you boys out it is them.”
“Well, have you ever stolen my favourite jumper?” He watched as Scorpius slowly put his finger down.
The gossip about the Slytherin and Gryffindor heads of house was also taking over many groups around the Hall, maybe because it was Harry Potter, but this seemed to spread faster than most other gossip the school had.
In the library, there are Rose, Scorpius, and Albus sitting in silence writing their essays before dinner when Rose spoke up.
“You guys have everything?” Draco checks, receiving nods from both boys, “This year I am not doing 20 trips back here because one of you forgot something.”
“I would like that,” the two are almost to the castle when they hear the crowd coming up behind them and some students run past them, “Can we leave the feast early?”
“I was planning on it, since we don’t have homework today, I was going to sleep early,” Zach says, putting on his own pajamas and heading towards the bathroom to finish getting ready.
“Right,” Scorpius suddenly remembers his promise to Rose, waving and running out the door and ran to the library with Albus trailing along right behind.
“Okay,” Draco says, turning on his heel to face his sons, “today you will be learning the art of occlumency.”
“Yeah, mine was good as well,” Albus says, thinking over the 6 months for something to tell, “My grandma taught me how to knit, it was really cool.”
“I would be fine if they did know,” Albus says, “But I was scared that I was going to be the reason that our secret would be shared.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry says, but his tone is way too fond for the words to stick, he then turns back to the field as Slytherin scores again, making them tied.
“They are currently reading up about dementors, then I am teaching them about Patronus’,” Harry explains when an idea hits him, “would you like to join the class, so that way I can have another example.”
“Hey, I was just pronounced virus-free, so now here I am,” He says as he fills his plate with chicken and potatoes.
“Professor Malfoy? Would you care to demonstrate?” Harry asks with a soft tone that most people don’t hear.
Albus realized his mistake, the grandma that Zachary knew of, Lily, was in fact dead, but it was Narcissa who had taught him, he just hoped he would be able to save this when he had been saved by Vincent Goyle sitting down beside Zach.
All three raised to the air and Harry released the snitch, which immediately flew off quickly around the arena. It only took about 5 minutes for Scorpius to catch up to the snitch and catch it, leaving the crowd cheering, half because of the win, and the other half because they could finally go inside to the warmth of the castle.
“This is further into the school year than I expected,” Minerva says as the boys walk into the room, “skipping class and stealing from a teacher, wow you really outdid yourself this time.”
“Well, we can think about that some other day,” Zach says, “Tonight we were thinking of playing some muggle party games, wanna join?”
Harry Potter, the savior of the wizarding world, and Draco Malfoy, youngest Death Eater ever, weren't exactly two random teachers, they were two sides of the same war, known school enemies, basically the template for Slytherin versus Gryffindor rivalries.
“Fraternal twins,” Scorpius reminded him, “Also if we looked identical the world would have known when we were born.”
Draco Malfoy was leaning against his desk at the front of the class on Monday, his white shirt sleeves rolled up exposing the faded dark mark, the mark surrounded with muggle tattoos of narcissus flowers and lilies. He was explaining something to do with the lesson, I have no clue what I'm just the author I wasn’t paying attention to his class, and he could clearly see the weird looks coming from the class, probably all wanting to ask about Harry, or the Dark Mark, or the shining silver ring on his finger, but he brushed it off and continues his lesson.
Harry looks up from his tea to the clock as it reads 10:07, “Okay, we should be leaving within the next 15 minutes, so make sure you have everything you need packed.”
“Malfoy, Potter,” Zachary Zabini says as he moves over to be sitting across from the brothers, not that Zabini knows they are, “how was your lockdown, it feels like I haven’t talked to you two in so long.”
“So, what do you say we uh,” Harry trails off and pulls the hem of Draco’s shirt slightly up, pulling him into a passionate kiss.
The lesson continues, and Harry teaches them all about the charm and how to make one. A few students can make a shield form Patronus by the end of the class and the others had some small wisps of blue and white come out of their wand. Eventually, Draco must get back to his own classroom before his next class, so he leaves and as soon as he is out the door one student speaks without raising their hand, “Mr. Potter, isn’t your Patronus also a stag?”
“Of course,” Draco stood up and held his hands out for Harry to pull himself up, but in their sleepy state, harry almost made them fall over when he collapsed into Draco’s chest, “You okay to walk inside?”
“Well as strange as this all is, be prepared to be referred to as ‘Pottah’ from now on Scorp,” Zachary says, “Dad may not have told me everything, but he did talk about how weirdly obsessed you Father was with ‘Saint Pottah’.”
That conversation had happened almost 20 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. Draco had started as the new Potions Master and had quickly become Head of Slytherin house. And Harry had started as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and had figured out a counter curse for the curse Dumbledore had placed for the position to be filled by someone new each year, so he had now celebrated his 15th year teaching in that position and was also Head of House. The two had also gotten married around 2004 and had 2 beautiful children in 2006, Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, legally they were both Malfoy-Potter, but ever since they were born, in the eyes of the wizarding world, they were a Malfoy and a Potter. Both had arrived at Hogwarts for the first time in 2017 and were now going into their 4th year, and what a year it was going to be.
The crowd is full of confused murmurs and the players fly back down to the ground, “Wait does that mean that Gryffindor won?” can be heard faintly over the magically amplified speakers.
“Well, it’s not like I could just show up in your class to just say hi,” Draco crosses the room, sits on the bed, and pulls Harry into his chest.
Soon the two brothers are walking through crowds of wizards and muggles pushing their trolleys towards Platform 9¾, they arrive on the platform with 6 minutes to spare and find a compartment with Rose Weasley and her brother Hugo, both of the children of Ron and Hermione, Harry’s best friends.
“Cool, this should be interesting,” a devilish smile covering his face, this made Albus uncomfortable, “I know that your dear old dad has concealed who your mother is, so would you care to share?”
“Well, when I last faced one in school it had turned into a dementor, but my greatest fear is fear itself. So, my boggart has always changed based on what my current fears are,” there is a certain sadness in his eyes as he says these words, as the last time he had stepped in front of a boggart, it had shown him the most horrifying image. His two sons and husband lying on the floor helpless, dead.
Draco had taught them 2 other potions as well as started their unit on love potions, it was never his favourite unit to teach, but he had to teach it so he made sure to cover anything that they could ever want to know, so he would never have to teach it again. That unit always brought along the question of ‘so what do you smell in the amortentia?’ and of course if anyone knew anything about Harry Potter you would know that Draco had just described him.
“What exactly do you think went wrong?” Draco asks as he crosses the room to check the potion, which was bubbling a muddy green colour, meaning that it was almost correct.
Draco followed his husband and caught up to him just outside the quidditch pitch, “Hey,” his voice was soft and comforting as loud noises often reminded them of less fun memories, “how are you feeling?”
“I love you too,” Harry shifts his head to be resting in the crook of Draco’s neck and presses a soft kiss there.
Harry leads his husband to a chair near the front of the room to wait until the students put away their books.
“Good for you,” Scorpius says, ‘thank Salazar for that timing, that could have been really bad,’ he thinks.
“True,” Draco says, moving closer to Harry, “When I first cast it, it took the form of an albino peacock, like the ones that lived near the manor when I grew up,” Draco says, reminiscing before his face falls serious again, “then for a while I wasn’t able to cast one. But when I was able to make one again, it was different.”
Harry nods, stands, and reaches out the hand that is empty, for Draco to take. Once they are both standing, they rush down the stairs to go meet the players who are standing in a circle with the red and green robes on either side. The kids are looking on expectantly as they move into where Madame Hooch was just standing.
No one complains and every member of the teams leave the circle and stand along the side of the pitch with Madame Hooch, except for Scorpius and Roxanne.
‘Well that was interesting,’ Albus thinks as he walks side by side with his brother to the table covered in green.
After an hour, all the students had been tested, and the first years had been sorted, which meant it was time for the feast and McGonagall to welcome everyone to Hogwarts.
Could the boy’s true parents be revealed? Has Harry Potter fallen into the trap of the once evil Malfoy? Were the boys raised with by this unconventional family? All questions that will be answered in due time.
Such as Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, they weren't students, but teachers. They had both returned to the school over a decade ago, after deciding that being an Auror wasn’t the career for either of them, they had seen their fair share of dark wizards for a lifetime. Over the years since the war, they had been able to overcome their differences and form their relationship as it stands today, husbands. They kept the nature of their relationship away from the press, as they were very happy with their little bubble of secrecy. Obviously, their friends and families knew, well, Lucius didn’t know, he was rotting in the cells of Azkaban for life, but aside from that, no one knew.
the lengthy split up her thigh, but because her pale, freckled skin had been charmed a shockingly lurid green.
Draco’s hands moved up and over Harry’s shoulders to bury in his hair, and fuck if that didn’t feel divine, and
“What? Oh, the shorts. I mean, yeah, can you blame me?” Harry snorted, grinning at the look Ron gave him as he took a swig of his own water.
Harry assumed he’d come as a ghost, although the notion was far fetched; no bedsheet in sight, only a pair of skin-tight white leather trousers, a shirt, unbuttoned and almost transparent tucked into them, and as if the trousers didn’t draw enough attention to his arse, a pair of six-inch heels. His hair was tousled in the messy way Harry liked-
Harry chuckled, watching Dean join Luna as he congratulated Draco. “I’m happy for you, Gin, truly- not everyone gets to experience the joys of tribadism,” he insisted solemnly and Ginny laughed, bumping him with her shoulder.
The crowd was noisy as it surged against them and Harry clutched Draco’s hand tighter, following Luna through the throngs of people as Ginny piggybacked her down the street.
Shovelling a handful of crisps into his mouth and feeling considerably sorry for himself, he looked up, and to his surprise locked eyes with Draco, who was now stood alone and staring right at him.
Draco smiled, and Harry had only a second to revel in the sparkle that had returned to his eyes before Draco crushed their lips together, hand fisted tightly in Harry’s t-shirt.
as he was, and was no doubt off to ask Hermione for advice, or worse, send her over for a heart-to-heart. Harry loved his friends, he really did, but there was a time and a place for crying into a bottle of Odgen’s, and tonight was not it.
They broke apart, breathless, and as Harry went to speak Draco stopped him, placing three fingers against his lips once more.
“- Bisexual, yeah. Although I’ve not been near a woman for nearly a decade, so I’m definitely out of practice.”
“Fine. After. I know what you’re like, and I’m not letting you sneak out of this one if I’m spending half my fortune on you.”
Ron laughed, knocking him lightly with his shoulder. “Mate, you can do whatever you like to him, and vice versa. I just don’t enjoy the visual of you getting your cock out, no matter who you’re doing it with. It’s all you, has absolutely nothing to do with Draco- if anything, I’m happy for you.”
“Yeah, I know,” he said, dropping a brief kiss to the top of her head. “I think we did fucking fantastic. It’s crazy, really, isn’t it?”
Harry’s jaw crashed promptly into the floor along with his last remaining shred of dignity as his cock swelled in his too-tight jeans, an embarrassing gurgle bubbling in his throat as Pansy started squealing with glee behind him. After staring at Draco with a strange sort of astonishment for what felt like an eternity, mind blank except for the alarm bells screeching in his brain- although that might have been Pansy- Harry all but launched across the room, tripping over his feet in his haste to cover him up.
strange, aren’t they? The only green witch I’ve ever met was Gwen, and that’s because she ate a dodgy sausage sandwich ten minutes before a game, and there was
If Ron doubted his sincerity, he didn’t comment, instead picking up a large bowl of crisps. “Yeah, okay, sure… look, have some food, and just avoid him, ok? I’m going to check on Hermione, but you wait here, I’ll just be a minute.” Shoving the bowl into Harry’s hands and giving him a small smile, Ron grabbed his plate and strode away, edging around people back towards his wife.
Harry laughed, whether from relief or joy he didn’t know, eyes blurry as he tried to keep his own hand steady and not drop the ring down the drain. He slid it perfectly onto Draco’s finger, throat burning at the small choked sound Draco made, unable to tear his eyes away from Draco’s hand. As soon as it was on, Draco broke out of his grasp and flung his arms around Harry’s neck, laughing and crying and clutching at Harry so tightly he felt like his whole entire world had been reduced to just the two of them. The urge to start shouting with glee at the top of his lungs was so overwhelming that all he could do was pull back and kiss Draco, ignoring the cheers and whistles from their friends, his lips salty with tears he wasn’t sure were Draco’s or his own.
“You look like you’ve been bitten by a rather vicious Doxy, but it's quite alright- he does look rather lovely. I think I'd blush too, if Ginny was dressed like that."
Harry began to choke on his drink, spluttering embarrassingly, ready to explain that dentists wear lab coats, not suits, and that he
He felt, more than heard, Draco’s startled gasp, which tore him out of the mortifying burst of desire; stumbling back, he wiped a hand across his lips, tasting blood. Body thrumming with arousal but trembling with anger, he grasped Draco’s wrist and began to drag him across the room. Draco, thankfully, was silent, stumbling along behind Harry as he pulled him through the tight circle of people- all eyes awkwardly diverted- and down the hallway until they reached the bathroom, unceremoniously shoving him through the door and knocking the light on before slamming it shut behind them.
“Christ, Ron,” he laughed weakly, downing his water and crumpling the empty plastic bottle in a desperate attempt to focus on something other than the overwhelming urge to cry, “some warning before you start waxing poetry about my love life?”
“So, ‘ow are you doin’ then?” Ron asked, still chewing, eyes filled with concern. Swallowing his food down with a swig of Butterbeer, he leant forward, beckoning Harry closer with a claw and lowering his voice. “You know, with Malfoy? He’s here somewhere, he arrived with Parkinson about half an hour ago.”
“Hello everyone,” McGonagall started, “as all of you are quite aware, there are fewer of you in the Hall today, as some of your classmates are still awaiting treatment. As of right now, we should be able to rid the school of the virus by the end of the week, thanks to Professor Malfoy for creating the potion that will be curing your peers.”
It was around 9pm when they had made it outside and were now sitting in comfortable silence looking up at the moon with warming charms keeping them from shivering. They just lay there, thinking, a few small conversations, and just enjoying each other’s company.
“Oh, but it was. I counted,” Draco retorted, receiving yet another chuckle from Scorpius and an exasperated look of defeat on Albus’ face.
The stands are quiet for a bit before the announcer calls, “For the first time in over 20 years, Harry Potter has caught the snitch!”
“Exactly,” Draco says, “I guess by teaching you legilimency you naturally developed a level of occlumency. Though that does not make you masters yet, you can hide thoughts from someone who isn't looking for them, but if someone ever goes looking for a way inside your head, they will try to find anything and everything left in your head. Every memory you have will become a weapon against you if you don’t learn to shield them away.”
He walks to their dorm to find their dormmates asleep, so he goes to his nightstand and goes into the drawer, and grabs the silky cloak. He then returns to the common room and finds his brother pacing, waiting, “Let’s go.”
The four of them eat their breakfast, and it honestly couldn’t be a more perfect scene, two men with white-blonde hair and the other two with black messy locks, and while Albus shares most of Harry’s general physique, he has the steely grey eyes of his other father, and Scorpius shares the emerald green eyes that Harry has been told countless times were ‘his mother’s eyes’. All four sat in their muggle clothing, as they weren't going to change into robes until they were at Hogwarts, with shades of blue, green, and grey covering every inch of the fabric.
The full moon reminds him of Remus Lupin, and Hallowe’en, the day his parents died, his godfather was sent to Azkaban, and Peter Pettigrew got away. Draco realized exactly what this meant but waited to see if Harry wanted to talk about it, alas he didn’t. Draco squeezed Harry’s hand and they walked into the castle. Past groups of chatting students and a few students staring at their intertwined hands, but they didn’t mind, they were used to random stares.
“I just came to see how you were doing, as I don’t have a class this block and I was bored,” Draco explains, “so, what are you teaching?”
“Best be off to the library,” Albus says waving to his dad, “McGonagall is having us write 3 pages for transfiguration.”
“I like that idea,” Draco says between kisses, before pushing Harry back onto the bed and climbing on top of him.
“Hey, it's not my fault it looks better on me,” Scorpius replies, grabbing the jumper out of his trunk, this earns him a punch on the arm as Albus takes back his sweater.
“Scorp, did you take my grey jumper?” Albus complains as he searches through his trunk, “I can’t find it.”
A few students laughed at this, then Harry says, “Okay, everyone stand up, we will now learn the spell.”
“Well at least it finally explains how you ended up with bright green eyes when no Malfoy has ever had green eyes,” Zach points to Scorpius’ eyes, “And did Draco choose ‘Severus’ as your middle name,” now pointing to Albus, “after his godfather.”
“Okay, I know you two have played a seekers game before,” Harry says, Harry and Draco, along with many others of their chosen family had taught their kids how to fly from a young age, “So I expect you to be able to pull this off with no problems.”
She had an amused smirk on her face, “I will be giving you detention, and I am taking 15 points each from Slytherin.”
“She has always loved assigning homework on the weekends,” Harry waves after his kids, and turns to go up to his office and through to his and Draco’s shared room where his husband is supposed to meet him after the detention.
“I certainly doubt it,” Draco chuckles, “remember how we were in school, or even last year, not a month went by without one of them getting down to the Headmistress’ office.”
“Wait, one thing,” Zach starts then gestures between him and Vincent, “Our parents were close with Malfoy, so why didn’t they know?”
Harry walks through the ground floor of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, making sure the house is clean enough so they can leave it for who knows how long. Kreature is in the kitchen making breakfast, and there are footsteps walking around above Harry's head.
The brothers realized more faces were now listening in on the story, Albus continues, “Well when they got together it was so soon after the war so they decided that for their own privacy and to keep it out of the papers,” He gestures down at the newspaper now abandoned on the table.
“Yeah, it was the first fear I thought of when I stepped in front of the boggart,” Harry says, flicking his hand and watching as the desks and chairs go back to their correct spot.
It had been over a week, and Harry was teaching a class when he hears the door open and a voice call in.
“You're just salty that you are the only Gryffindor in this house,” Draco teased back, standing up, “Come on, we should probably eat before going to Hogwarts.”
‘Our parents,’ his tone clipped, ‘I know the reason that they kept this a secret was so the whole wizarding world didn’t invade our lives, but it feels weird acting like dad is just my teacher.’
“Okay fine, I’m sorry, just don’t get Dad,” Scorpius says, and he hears footsteps outside the door, their other roommates must be back from dinner.
“Welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts, 4th years,” Harry addresses the class, “As you are all aware from previous years, I don’t play favourites,” he shoots a glance at Albus and Scorpius who were sitting a few rows back, “I believe in hard work and honesty, so if you try hard in this class, you will succeed. Am I understood?”
Albus had an idea, “Well, maybe sometime we should play truth or dare with the others, so you can ask us.”
“Well, this is technically detention, but it is actually a lesson,” Hary says looking over to the desks on one half of the room and snaps his fingers to make them move on their own, “you said you wanted to learn how to do that, so I am here to teach you.”
“Oh, kind of like how Al and I can like have conversations in our minds,” Scorpius notices, “Like we can only read the thoughts that were meant for the other.”
“Impossible,” Draco leaned over to press a sweet kiss to Harry’s lips, it felt slightly strange to kiss in such an open place, but who cares.
“How much you wanna bet that tomorrow the Daily Prophet will have done some fake-ass article about our relationship,” Draco says, taking off his robes.
“Sure, well, ‘Mr. Potter’ is also my dad,” everyone’s jaws hit the floor, no one spoke up so Scorpius continues, “Our dads kept it mostly secret so it wouldn’t become this big deal.”
Finally, when they arrive at Hogwarts, the students are immediately taken into classrooms to give them the test for the virus, those infected were asked to stay behind while the others were taken into the Great Hall to wait for the feast to start.
“You know Dad’s old map?” Albus turns to his brother, “According to Ron and Hermione, he used to use it to follow Father around.”
Harry and Draco disappearated and arrived at Hogwarts to receive a briefing on all new rules and protocols regarding the virus. While Scorpius and Albus were left to make their way to the platform before 11.
Harry presses a kiss into Draco’s now messy blonde locks, he soon feels Draco’s breath even out on top of him, and he lets himself drift off to sleep.
“Scorpius Malfoy-Potter seems to have spotted the snitch,” the announcer calls, the stands turn to watch the seeker, but just about every person in the stands is shocked by the announcement of the double last name.
“Please don’t tell me that you can actually read each other’s minds,” Rose says as they walk by Ms. Pince, the librarian.
“I have so many questions,” Vincent says, and a few murmurs of agreement came from the people surrounding them.
The team goes back to their pre-game routines, tying their shoes, checking their brooms, and talking amongst themselves.
“I am sure you are all wondering why I have called you here today,” McGonagall says as everyone is seated, “Well, I am pleased to announce that the castle is officially free of all of that nasty virus, which means you are all safe.”
Clearly, this is something that every other student wanted to ask, as they were all looking at him expectantly.
“Hey, something happened last night,” Albus starts, seeing the fiery grey eyes watching him, obviously Draco was feeling extra protective.
Harry turns to McGonagall as he still has the snitch in his hand, “First of all, I have no idea how I caught that, second off, I think I know what to do.”
In their other classes, Albus and Scorpius were trying their hardest, though that kind of failed when they got bored of Astronomy and decided that it was more useful to silently plan ways to get out of it. Once they stole Harry’s invisibility cloak and just walked right out, this only worked until Harry had caught them sneaking past his classroom, well it was a record for how long it was before they got in trouble, 5 weeks, nice.
The two boys across the table look bewildered and confused before Zach finds his words, “What aren't we ready it hear?”
Harry Potter, the hero wizard responsible for freeing our world of Lord Voldemort, was seen yesterday being exceedingly comfortable beside the once Death Eater, Draco Malfoy. They were seen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where both men work, during a quidditch game, where Mr. Potter caught the golden snitch for the first time in 20 years. Also seen at the Hogwarts quidditch game that took place yesterday, was their sons, Albus Severus and Scorpius Hyperion, proudly wearing new jerseys which dawn the name ‘Malfoy-Potter’. The two men were also seen yesterday wearing wedding bands and holding hands around Hogwarts grounds.
“Scorpius put on your mask,” Albus pulls a muggle fabric mask out of his pocket and puts it on, as they are required in most places to stop the spread of this virus.
“It really is,” Zabini says matching Goyle’s tone, “Possibly one of the most Gryffindor-ish Gryffindors ever.”
“Sure, but may I ask why?” Draco asks, he knows that Harry would have a good reason that he wants company, as he usually sat alone on Halloween.
“Well, a boggart changes form to whatever is the person’s greatest fear, so no one actually knows what they look like,” Scorpius explains, earning him a nod from Harry.
“Precisely Scorp,” Draco says, “Occlumency is being able to block people from entering your mind, it is kind of the opposite of Legilimency.”
The hour is spent with them practicing different spells on many of the items in Harry’s classroom. By the end Scorpius and Albus have been able to levitate many objects and keep them there for a while, Scorpius was able to transfigure a book into a chair, the chair only had 3 legs, but still, and Albus was able to cast Accio, bringing his bag to him at the end of the lesson.
“The Slytherin’s played truth or dare, and they asked Albus about his mom,” Both of their dads looked a mix of enraged and humored.
“But then they became more,” Albus seamlessly continued, “Apparently, they had both had the biggest crushes on each other for years, then once they got over their dumb rivalry, they figured out their relationship.”
“So, the possibilities of you two becoming step-brothers are now more and more possible,” Vincent teases, the boys just share a look, kind of suggesting that he couldn’t be further from figuring out the truth.
“Students, please continue working,” He moves towards the door where Draco was standing and feels a few eyes follow him, “to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Both Albus and Scorpius run upstairs to check on their trunks and that leaves Harry and Draco in the kitchen. With a flick of Harry's wrist, the plates go flying to the sink and start washing themselves, when Draco had first learned how little Harry needed spells or even his wand, he had kept saying how uncommon that was to be that in control of your powers, but by now it was just normal.
Soon each one grabbed their bags and filed out of the room, leaving the Malfoy-Potters in the DADA room.
“I just know that Scorpius basically already won that bet of theirs,” says Rose, “based on how people are reacting to the Patronus thing, I wouldn’t be surprised if The Prophet did some story on this.”
“How far have you gotten?” She asks, looking up from her parchment for the first time in almost an hour.
‘I mean I don’t know, it is still October, so you still have time to win the bet,’ Albus reminds him, it had always felt normal to be able to communicate without talking.
“Well that is simple, right now it is the day my sons were born,” Draco responds, knowing that he said ‘sons’ plural. But whatever, they aren’t hiding anymore.
“Okay, as you read in the book, the dementors can easily be defeated by a Patronus, which is made from pure happiness, and created when thinking of the happiest memory that someone has,” Harry tells the class after everyone puts away their books.
It had been almost 2 weeks since the term started, now all the classes were settled, and everyone had gotten used to seeing people again and having stuff to do.
“Well, as this potion seems to only have one flaw, possibly the stirring process, you will still be getting high marks on this assignment,” Draco confirms.
The Slytherin common room only ever felt lively when people decide to play games, on every other day it was damp and gloomy. So today when there is a group of many students gathered in a circle sprawled across various furniture was one of those days it felt fun. They had played a few rounds of never have I ever, and some of the younger students had decided it was too late to be up on a school night, now the game was coming to an end when Scorpius whined, “Hey, that’s targeting.”
“See you guys in the morning,” Albus’ voice flat, walked out of the room without saying anything else.
The Gryffindor Seeker, Roxxane Weasley, has also caught sight of the snitch and is now flying directly behind Scorpius. Scorpius reaches forward to try to grab the snitch, but it zooms up just out of his reach. Both seekers fly up and just before Roxxane could grab it, the snitch goes impossibly faster, making a dart to the stands where the teachers are sat.
“I mean it is a very protective talent,” Draco’s face falling serious, “To spare you the details, I learned this skill while Voldemort was staying at the manor, and it helped me to sleep at night.”
Harry reached for Draco’s hand and intertwined their fingers, feeling the ring that now sat proudly on his finger, “I would just say 'good’, but you would that is a lie,” Harry let out a small chuckle and resumes walking back to the castle.
By a month into DADA Harry had covered werewolves, Animagi, and some of the worst curses. The essay that he made them write about Werewolves and Animagi had been very similar to the one Snape had assigned his 3rd year. And with his discussion about curses, he had received many questions about the war, and it brought back many memories that he had tried to repress.
“Well, have fun not hiding anymore,” Harry says, “I believe you two should be off to the library to meet with Rose.”
Harry just brings his hand to the chain around his neck, slips it off, and places the ring on his left ring finger.
Draco scoffed, “Well, we can read those lies Rita Skeeter tells about us in the morning,” Draco has also gotten changed, and is sitting on the bed, “But for now, come to bed.”
The Hall yet again was filled with clapping from everyone before McGonagall had dismissed everyone to enjoy their Saturday.
“Well that is a relief,” Hugo chimes in, “It has been really weird not seeing my friends for the last 6 months. So maybe we can go back to as normal as possible for a while.”
Draco is aligning the cauldrons at the front of the room when most of the students file in, it is just the 4th year Slytherins for potions this block. A few greetings were said while the students filed into their desks, and soon it was time for class to begin.
Now at the end of the week, it is Hallowe’en, and the Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match today. The school is buzzing, and Albus and Scorpius are sitting in the locker room with a sort of nervous energy. Today they were going out as brothers, with the same last name written across their backs.
“Dray,” Harry turns to his other side, “do you remember those seekers games that we played in our eighth year?”
After a few nods from the class, he continues, “Okay now onto the lesson for the day, open your books to page 174, and read through to 176. After that, I will have put the recipe for a potion on the board, and you will each carry out said potion.”
“We will explain later, but for now we have essays to finish,” says the blonde as he takes his essay out and places it on the table.
“Nuh-uh, it’s the rules,” Albus watches as Scorpius begrudgingly stood up and walked to the window to lick it, casting a quick cleaning charm and completing the dare.
“Well, everyone who came back for eighth year after the war knew,” Scorpius says, “Something about truth or dare, and apparently if anyone actually paid attention that year, they could have figured it out.”
But now everyone had been called to the Great Hall for an announcement by McGonagall, so students and teachers were now rushing to hear what the Headmistress had to say. They all sat down at their respective tables and waited as everyone filed into the room.
They both get under the cloak and move up the stairs to the wall and exit the common room. Walking down the hall towards their father’s potions classroom, they knew about the passage to their dads’ room through both Harry and Draco’s offices. Walking through the vacant classroom Albus pulls off the cloak and Scorpius opens the door to the office.
“Actually,” Albus looked over to his brother, “no. That was all Dad, something about him being one of the bravest men he ever knew.”
“Oh, right,” Scorpius says, pulling his own mask out of one of the pockets of his coat before slipping it on.
“Well, I am less disappointed that you broke the rules than I am that you got caught,” Harry explains, grabbing his wand out of his pocket, “It would be super hypocritical if I expected you to follow the rules that I myself break.”
“But, your last names,” Vincent says trying to collect his thoughts, “why do you have different last names?”
“Good morning Scorpius,” Harry says with a tired smile, meeting his son at the bottom of the stairs, “Kreature is making breakfast, then we should be off to school.”
More students come to join their classmates in the Great Hall as they are pronounced healthy, and soon dessert is brought out, and Draco makes sure to give Harry his treacle tart.
“How did you know?” Draco asked, knowing full well that if McGonagall had made this kind of bet, she would have some real reason to back up her side.
“Oh, right,” Scorpius says grabbing his bag, grabbing Albus’s arm, and rushing out of the classroom.
Whispers erupted around the classroom, and Draco spoke again, “I can tell I am not going to get your attention back on potions for a while, so is there anything else you wanted to ask?”
The entire trip is filled with stories from what everyone had been up to for the past months, with a few stories retold from their parents of their adventures, not only as teenagers but also from when they were Aurors.
“Very good, now can anyone tell me what a boggart looks like?” Harry says with a smile, a few hands raise, “Scorpius, go.”
“Okay so as you know we are twins, but the story starts way before we were born,” Scorpius starts the story, “well our parents, as you know, were school rivals but then after the war they apologized and became friends.”
“Potter!” Harry recognizes that voice, but why was he walking in on the DADA class? The students must have wondered the same thing and they turned to look at Professor Malfoy.
Soon all four are in bed and Scorpius says, “Goodnight.” he hears murmurs of the same before closing his eyes and letting himself fall asleep.
Possibly their favourite reaction to their relationship was McGonagall, they had told her over tea in 2001, they weren’t working at the school yet, but they had made it a habit to check in on the school every so often.
His students were almost bursting with how wholesome Draco looked talking about the love of his life. When Harry had a similar conversation in his class the students just basked in the adorable energy coming off the man. There were sure to be more articles soon, but whatever.
“That is precisely what they do,” Harry says, “a boggart can be whatever you are afraid of, that is what makes them so powerful, it also makes them very dangerous. But the one thing that can stop a boggart is laughter, so there is the spell ‘Riddikulus’ that can make whatever the boggart had turned into, funny.”
“As I expected,” Draco says moving over to the wardrobe, pulling out a dark grey jumper and changes into it, “I still have to figure out what I am going to have them do for their detention with me.”
“Hi,” Harry replied, stepping close enough that he could smell Draco’s coconut shampoo, gently brushing a knuckle across his glittery cheekbone. “You look...fuck. Breathtaking. More than.”
The urge to walk over and fuck Draco silly in public was too, especially since they were no longer together and surrounded by most, if not all, of the people he knew (including Arthur and Molly, two people he could live without ever seeing his naked arse).
Draco’s eyes met his then, wide and searching, before seemingly coming to a decision. “I didn’t particularly want to leave either, but I had no other choice.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco continued. “If this is to work again, Harry, something has to change. It has to be better. I can’t- I’m not living like that again, always feeling like second best—”
He kissed Harry again, sucking on his tongue as he tried valiantly to press himself closer, legs impossibly tight. Harry laughed into the kiss as he heard Ron groan and could feel something bouncing off the back of his head.
Ten minutes later, Harry made his way out of the guest loo, towelling his hair dry as he headed back up to their bedroom. When he got there, the ensuite door was open but the room was empty, so he quickly tugged on the jeans Draco had left out for him before rummaging around in the bottom of their wardrobe, searching for his most prized possession.
“Hmm. I have a pretty good idea," Draco said with a smug smile, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Well, I thought you’d be
He cut off, cursing loudly as Draco pulled his foreskin back, sucking the head of Harry’s cock into his mouth before pulling off with a pop. Refusal died on Harry’s tongue as Draco dipped his own into the slit, flicking at it with tight little movements, eyes raising until they met Harry’s. Wrapping his lips around the swollen glans, he began to slide down, excruciatingly slow, until his nose touched the dark curls at Harry’s groin.
“Harder,” Draco choked out, knuckles white where he was gripping the curve of the sink, eyes on Harry's as they moved together. “Please, I need you to fuck me harder—oh
Set underneath the diamonds, the two colours shone through depending on how the ring was angled, something the jeweller had told him was 'ingenious'.
“Stop looking at me like that, you’re making me want to kiss you again, and I think we need to give these poor sods a break.”
“We’ve been together for four years, Harry. We’ve shared a house for two. My mother isn't completely virtuous.”
Draco moaned as he slid back up, tongue swirling with practised ease, and Harry’s knees nearly buckled, an embarrassingly needy sound escaping from his throat before he could stop it. God, he didn't even care- he’d missed Draco’s blowjobs almost as much as he’d missed Draco himself.
Spotting Draco wasn’t too difficult, and not just because of his bright blonde hair or glittery arse (he'd gotten rid of the wings half an hour after they'd arrived, to Hermione's relief)- Harry had spent the last seventeen years searching for him in a crowd, and it was ten times easier now that Harry was a trained auror and head over fucking heels in love with him. Draco would draw his eye no matter how many witches, wizards or drag queens stood in between them, and his gaze narrowed in on Draco easily, chatting to said drag queens with Blaise just outside of the wards they’d set up.
