“Soon, yeah? We just have to wait for the Healer, okay?” Harry stated. They were just starting in on a debate what to have for dinner, when Healer Lindsay came back, holding a tray of coffee cups in hand, looking a bit sheepish when he spotted Ron and Hermione standing next to the bed as well.
“Don’t call me that.” He snaps at her, and she rolls her eyes as she steps through, forcing him back inside.
“We’ll best be off, then” he said to them, and gently got Teddy in a vaguely upright position, leaning against him, before stroking his face and nudging him to wake up a little. After stumbling with Teddy to a nearby apparition point, Harry apparated to the little alley next to Grimmauld Place. He’d gotten rather adept at soft landings, even if he still hated feeling the compressed-lung,eyes-popping feeling of apparition. Teddy still stumbled a little, but looked relaxed and dopey-eyed as Harry led them to the square, and up to Grimmauld Place.
Later, lying in his bed, the picture of Potter, white as a sheet and worried looking came to mind. Parenting seemed to come with a lot of that. Worry.
Entering Hermione’s office, he found her being served tea by Jasmin before they all took seats. He quickly looked her over, and though she looked good, he could see that she was worried. Her curly hair wasn’t as well conditioned, and she had small lines of strain next to her mouth, as if she had clenched her jaw a lot. Hmm. Better ask about it, then. But later, after Jasmin had left. “Let’s start”, he prompted, and let Jasmin take the lead.
Mr. Picklewilly had passed away seven years prior, but “dear old Dick” was still a regular topic of many a conversation with Mrs. Picklewilly. While always good to listen to for the latest gossip on Diagon –she was close friends with Mrs. McCarthy from ‘Eye of Newt Apothecary’ on the other end of Diagon Alley, who always had the freshest gossip, and they subsequently always knew the goings on of most of Diagon-, when she got to talking about her no-good daughter in law, or worse, “that sad business with your latest beau”, he couldn’t wait to get back in Neville’s shop.
“Ahem. I intended the strawberry cream thing for him, actually. It seemed more… age appropriate?” he cocked his head slightly. “
"Because, Potter, these geraniums will tell Desiderius he’s been stupid, the meadowsweet will point out his uselessness, and the carnations will convey to him that he has utterly disappointed me.” He explained gleefully. “Purple too, is the colour of hopelessness and disappointment. It will also convey that I expect better of him in the future. He’ll appreciate that’’.
“How long have they been here?” He asked, speaking up so Neville could hear him, feeling already tired. His stomach was grumbling unhappily, having forgone breakfast.
Goods in hand, he decided he might as well pick up his order from Spectral Sprouts, see if Potter was there too. It had been a few days since his unfortunate but necessary confession, and he hoped Potter had stewed in his awful response. Loathe to admit it, Draco had. He still cringed inwardly, hearing that surprised laugh. But he had to put those feelings aside and really get on with it, else Potter wasn’t ever going to the Function, with
And so the article went. Draco swallows audibly, and looks up at Lawrence, who is clenching his fists.
“That kid really has got his priorities straight, Har”, Ron joked at him, and Harry barked another laugh. Teddy loved his sweets just as much as Harry, and while it couldn’t be genetics, there was a family connection there. Harry remembered Remus always carrying chocolate, and it wasn’t like dementor attacks had always been imminent.
“Time for your potion, Ted”. Draco tries not to shudder at the utmost gentle tone in Potters voice. Teddy buries his face in Potters chest, looking reluctant but resigned. Potter strokes his head again, and gets up to get the blue bottle he had directed Draco to last time. Draco meanwhile starts cleanup, leaving Teddy be.
“How is Teddy? It’s been hours!” she exclaimed, both embracing Harry and then taking a seat around Teddy’s bed.
“Well, he hasn’t accepted yet, but then, we haven’t wanted to push the issue, ever since Marcus-” she again halted abruptly. The mood shifted, again back to the seriousness it had before.
“Of course. He’s your family, you want to make amends. It would only make sense, wouldn’t it?”. Draco grinned slyly at her.
“You know mrs. Picklewilly?”. He was nearly done binding the flowers together, but this little line of conversation was too interesting to let go of.
“Let’s get you to bed, sweetheart” and ever so gently, he guides Teddy up the stairs, leaving Draco in the kitchen with the dishes. He looks around debating whether he could get away with more cleaning charms than last time, and decides
?”. He had opened the Tupperware box with leftover chicken stew, sniffing it appreciatively. Harry gave him a tired smile.
Ron sat next to her, looking abashed but pleased, the tips of his ears red, a goofy smile on his face. It was a rare Saturday that they had brunch out, and they were at a sunladen park in London.
having issues? Like you wouldn’t prefer to do it all by yourself and never leave the office again” he teased. It was still a bit new, teasing Granger. But they were improving.
without him. He hadn’t told Granger about his plans yet; she’d disapprove, would undoubtedly say that “If Harry had an interest in politics, he would’ve done something already”, and “not to force him, especially not
“What, then?”. Malfoy took the bouquet, and Harry rung up the number. Malfoy paid, looking Harry straight in the eye. His blush was gone, and he looked rather pleased with himself.
“It’s fine! I’ll lock up. Go!” he waves him away, and less than a blink later, Potter’s through the floo.
“Slow down, Granger” he interrupted her, and grasped her hand to squeeze it in comfort. She took a deep breath, gave a weak smile. “Sorry, I know I can ramble on”.
“I can promise you, it wouldn’t harm you, Mr. Potter, or your department in any sense. That is, if you keep your wits about you, and an eye on that hopeless Mr. Potter”. He snorted, growing more comfortable with her. He decided he liked her; she reminded him of Pansy, if with less fashion-sense, and a lot more wrinkles.
“Cinnamon rolls and a sort of strawberry and cream mountain.” He said, raising his voice a little. Potter’s eyes widened a little, and he could see that his jumper was being pulled at from behind.
Neville’s shop was a small little shop at the east end of Diagon, and the smell inside was just incredible. As soon as you stepped inside you were enveloped in the scent of a wide array of flowers, herbs, and ozone. While not all that light inside the shop itself, it had a wonderful little greenhouse in the back where it was always sunny and warm. Harry took his tea breaks there. That was another perk of working in Neville’s shop; all the different tea brews he could sample, all of which were sold in the shop themselves.
He’d had Auror raids gone wrong and been laid up in Mungo’s, so insomnia and a little malnourishment were nothing to worry about. And he wasn’t
a little, and then activated a repelling charm. The reporter –a short, portly man with a staunch red mustache and a bushy frown in green tartan robes, was unable to proceed into the shop. He opened his mouth in protest, but his splutter was lost; he was pulled back into the
Lawrence was a veritable blackmail-niffler. Born a Squib, he never received magical education at Hogwarts, although Draco was sure he would have been an excellent Slytherin. Clever, with a wicked sense of humour, Lawrence was what the muggles called a “private detective” –while still at uni, studying something called “Database Administration”, whatever that may be. Legal reform had made it easier for Squibs to navigate in the magical world, although they were still a marginalized and often discriminated against minority. Something he hoped to change, in due time. He'd love to see what Lawrence was capable off given proper education in the Wizarding world.
“Marcus liked it clean shaven”, he muttered curtly, before turning around to the toaster. He felt slightly ashamed. Personally, his black beard grew in fast and to keep it smooth demanded at least two shaves a day. The benefits –Harry blushed some more thinking on
Their tea is nearly cold at this point, and Hermione starts nibbling on some cucumber sticks she takes out of a plastic container. They tick off a few more items on their list –Hermione will go for the form fitting dress robes, after all-, and they make a plan on how to ply some more neutral Wizengamot members –Draco has already a list of flowers and little attentions planned-, and Hermione brings up the last syllabus modification.
Irritated already, he came out from behind the counter, and head to the flowers, again. “Alright, keep your hair on.”
to do with how he felt about Potter. He didn’t feel anything about Potter! Nor with how he was envious of that shiny sheet of hair Edgecombe was sporting. Who even had hair like that? He was sure it was a hair potion. Maybe he should consider switching brands-
“Teddy” he mutters, and he turns to the stairs, leaving Malfoy in the hallway. He finds Teddy sitting on the top step, leaning against the dark wooden bannister, looking mutinous. He finds the Pepper-up, and gives Teddy a small dose, before they both go downstairs.
“Hm, no. She rather likes being her own woman, you see. She’s made a name for herself, after Lucius was locked away”. Harry nods. Narcissa was associated with many charities, and known for not being afraid to get her hands stuck in as well. Good for her, he’d thought, when he heard that she had opened the manor after the war to act as interim foster-home. ‘after extensive renovation, of course’, she had assured the press in an inverview. He briefly wondered about Malfoy.
After the potion, Potter comes to stand next to him at the sink. Teddy has his face propped on his arms, eyes falling closed. “Thanks for dinner, Malfoy” he says quietly. Draco looks at him. “You’re welcome, Potter” he answers. They work in tandem, cleaning, and the air turns a bit expectant. It shouldn’t be so easy, Draco washing up the Muggle way, Potter drying and putting away dishes. So perfectly coordinated. Then, a small thump alerts them to Teddy’s having fallen asleep right at the table. Potter shoots Draco a wry smile, and quicky turns to Teddy.
Draco nodded towards Teddy, then gave Potter a pointed look. Potter looked angrily at his strawberry and cream pastry and started poking at it. Draco took the cue and took a large bite of his own.
“Alright then”, Harry replied, picking them up and doing his best to bind them together into a nice looking bouquet. He was silently grateful that Neville had insisted on giving him a flower-binding course last Saturday afternoon because he “wouldn’t see his delicate blooms mishandled in his typically Harry-way”. Harry had rolled his eyes at that, but was relieved when the bouquet seemed to turn out well.
Later that night, after Harry’s tucked Teddy into bed –he hasn’t mentioned the drawings at all- he sits down at the kitchen table, on which are the remains of the last pre-cooked ‘Malfoy-meal’ they had. Excellent, as always. He wondered if it meant that Malfoy would come by to cook tomorrow. He wasn’t sure how to feel about it now, having met Lawrence. Having discussed how he might have been just like Malfoy, had he been raised differently. It made him a little uneasy, and he rubbed his chest again.
“Not in the slightest. Are those Kneazles on broomsticks?” he leaned closer to the boy, inspecting the bizarre print on the green fabric.
She had too much manners for that, and, though loathe to admit it, too much humanity. She was part of the Wizarding War Orphan Foundation’s board, organizing fundraising events. She knew how much the war had cost, quite literally, and had sided with a cause she could actually empathize with; children.
“You’re so bloody weird, you know?” he grunts. Malfoy, much to his surprise, looks rather delighted.
“Your Ministry doesn’t do any privacy regulation stuff?” Lawrence inquired. Draco raised his eyebrows questioningly. “It’s all over the news on our end. Good business for me, you know” he grinned. Lawrence still said
He felt bad. He knew how hard it was, coming out to anyone, let alone your arch-nemesis turned… flower deliverer? While Harry was still scrambling to figure out a save, Malfoy grit out “Well, It’s been grand, Potter. Goodbye”.
In his eyes had been everything that Harry had wanted to use as a counter argument. How Malfoy had bullied Hermione, called her a Mudblood. How he had tried to get Buckbeak killed. Hagrid fired from his job. How he had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Attempted Dumbledore’s murder. How
woman, do you ever rest? I can check in on it, you just go.” Hermione shoots him a grateful smile, as she swings her robe over her chair, and pops loose the bottom button on her jacket.
was a sore point for Marcus too. While he was in favour of most of Hermione’s educational reforms with regard to Wizarding Studies and Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, he didn’t want to flaunt these ‘alliances’ all too publicly. Instead, he “wanted to remain open-minded and apolitical”, as was “the most appropriate for any member of the DMLE to be, isn’t it, Harry?”. And Harry thought he had to agree, since they were upholders of the law, not the makers of it. Although it didn’t sit right with him, sometimes, when he thought about it too much. Hermione had certainly looked disapprovingly whenever Harry had attempted repeat any of those sentiments.
“Of course.” Draco stepped forward, took Teddy by his shoulders, and with Potter –stumbling, panicked Potter, carried him upstairs. Teddy’s bedroom was a messy marvel, a riot of colours, drawings, and clothes. They gently put Teddy’s limp form on his bed, and Potter covered him with a few blankets. He then proceeded to do a monitoring charm like healers used –rare, but Draco supposed it must’ve been part of his Auror training, frowned at it, and sighed.
“Look, Draco, like I said, I understand that this has been difficult for you. Hell, it was difficult enough for me, and I didn’t have that element of culture crash, you know, or, not much, anyway. Just, being alone so much all the time was hard enough. Still is, though it’s better. I remember the stage you’re at, though, and it sucked a lot, being so isolated.”
Then, apparently, the family would just have to wait for the patient to make their way back to the world in a five to seven years’ time. This approach normally had a survival rate at about 50%, but in Mr. Malfoy’s case, the letter helpfully informed, that estimate would have to be considered rather lower because the illness had progressed this far before it was discovered. Thankfully a nurse who had already succeeded with such a patient had been found for him, which could be assumed to make his chances a bit better, but of course it was impossible to know for sure how much that would affect the outcome. Cheering, he thought, bleakly. On the other hand, he was clearly over the worst, and Mary was nothing but optimistic, so he could probably assume his chances were back up to the normal fifty percent, at least.
And then there were other things to do. Careful stretching exercises. Learning to eat again, first porridge, and then other soft things. There was sitting up straight, not semi-reclined, but still supported. There was rest, eternal, annoying hours of rest. One day soon, though, Mary promised, he would be able to sit in one of the two chairs. He was excited for it, the thought of moving there, and sitting there, feeling his body supported by something that wasn’t this bed. The thought of progress kept him going.
And then it struck Draco that this, this would be the way of things forever. He was going to come home, in a few years, yes, but he would be a different man after what had happened to him, and no one was going to be able to understand it, try as they might. His mother would try, so hard. His wife, when he found one, would try too. And they would try to get his children to understand, or else it would be a dark secret, or worse, an exciting story. “Tell us about when you lived with the muggles, father!” It all felt utterly insupportable.
“Sorry, tart is used a bit more positively in my circles than in general, umh. Anyway, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with liking a lot of music. It’s very unprejudiced, actually, which I appreciate.”
There was, apparently, in town, a club for gay men, where they could meet, and presumably form connections. It was, puzzlingly, called O’hoi Sailor. Kenny went there sometimes, he said, though of course he hadn’t been as much when he was in a committed relationship. Harry went there too.
This story is own voices, so please note that while a lot of Draco’s illness may seem extreme or even a little silly or exaggerated at times, I have lived more of it than not.
“Oh, you startled me, I was in music land. You look more rested, good. Okay, so, I have an idea, and I think… shit, sorry. Do you want some tea or something first?”
“No, you…” He did not want Harry to leave. Harry seemed determined to help, but the thing was, he might disappear, right? Mary had disappeared. And Draco wasn’t well enough for this to happen. He blinked at Harry, brain slowly catching up. “It’s okay, please stay. And yes, I think I do need a nap. Umh.” He wasn’t in a good place, that was for sure. His thoughts seemed to be swimming in and out of focus. He hadn’t felt like this for quite some time, and he didn’t care for it – in fact, the tiny reminder of how bad it could be, how bad it HAD been, felt like more than he could stand.
“I know it’s just eight, but do you want to go to bed?” Kenny asked. “I think this day has taken a lot out of you. I tried to keep my questioning minimal, but you know how it is, there’s a lot to go through in the beginning.”
After lunch Draco napped in bed, while Kenny tried to figure out the papers that documented his recovery this far. Draco didn’t use any daily medication anymore, so that part was easy. He only took two vitamin pills in the morning, vitamin B and D, and they were on the kitchen counter, so that had been easy to figure out. But Kenny needed other things from the notes of Mary that might be important.
The door opened, and he could hear them enter, the light step of his mother, the heavier ones of the healer. The one who might be able to figure it all out, but maybe not, there had been other healers before, and hope in them. The footsteps hurt his head, though he could tell they were trying to be quiet. He could hear them take a seat in the chairs near his bed, hear the stranger adjust his feet.
“Oh, wait, so you two are not exes?” Kenny said. “I’m sorry, I just kind of assumed you were school sweethearts or something.”
“And neither were your teachers, probably,” Kenny answered dryly. “That’s not just your posh school, you know, that’s the entire school system. It’s basically all ‘the nazis were evil, they tried to take over the world,’, not ‘the nazis were evil, let’s analyse how that evil worked and what evil is’. I mean, then they would have to look at our own colonial past, wouldn’t they, or at least make some obvious parallels. They never say shit about how we tried to take over the world too, pretty much managed it, even, and how evil was used to do that.”
“Oh, okay, so three rather large gift baskets, then,” she said. Harry made a choking sound, and when Draco looked at him, Harry was stuffing the arm of his sweater into his mouth to keep from laughing out loud.
“You should ask Harry, not me. I mean, he’s one of the ones you’ve wronged, and if I got the story right that’s not just on a group level either. Oh, fuck this shit. I’m getting too upset. You two should talk it out, because I keep wanting to run this entire fucking thing when it’s not actually about me. I’ll get us all some pizza, and you two can talk for a bit. Sound good?”
This conversation is also why this chapter took so long to write. The next three or four chapters are basically finished, but this one was difficult af. I wish it was better, but it is what it is.
His mother called him just three days later, when he was having lunch on the veranda in the crisp October air, a woolen blanket over his legs, and the apology list he was working to the side of the table, safe from any accidents of broccoli soup. He struggled inside and let himself fall onto the sofa before answering.
The next two chapters will be speed running through the first two years of recovery, with a heavy sprinkling of discovering muggle culture. And then, to the meat of the story.
Later they heated the soup Kenny had left them in the microwave. Draco looked for the tiny waves heating his food as he saw it through the glass door, spinning slowly, but they were apparently invisible – or Harry had misunderstood the entire thing, perhaps. Draco heated both bowls of soup under Harry’s supervision, and once he figured out it didn’t need to boil, like the water had, it went quite well. It was certainly a perfectly good soup, a milky soup with bits of cauliflower floating around in it.
Harry went on. In the period of maximal suspicion, homosexuality had been forbidden among muggles in most countries – though actually, come to think, it had been forbidden in Britain before that, for hundreds of years, fuck, this story wasn’t as tidy as I thought, sorry, Draco, anyway, and remained so until not that long ago, really, don’t look so horrified, it’s still, like forty years since it has been actually illegal.
He had been woken up by Kenny singing “happy birthday to you” very loudly. He explained, after, that this was a tradition from his family, and that he hoped Draco didn’t mind that he brought that here for him. After the initial confusion, Draco did not mind at all – it felt lovely, and he imagined being a little boy growing up with this tradition would feel very exciting.
“I know I brought it up, and I’m sorry, but I don’t want to talk about it anymore. How about, um. Let’s… make more tea.”
He read through most of the book from Mary’s bookshelf in her room, which held a lot of “nice romances”, as well as Audre Lorde and James Baldwin, whom he loved as much for the language as for their analyses of power. Power, as it turned out, looked very different from up and from down. He hadn’t known that, and he was stunned by the implication that it was often perfectly invisible from the top of any given relationship, even as it affected everything. Seeing it described from below was extremely enlightening, and him and Mary had many conversations about it, once she would open up about the subject.
He had Kenny, through pure dumb luck, because Harry had happened to walk in behind Mohammed that day. He would be fine, he felt certain about that. But he felt a lot less certain that Mary would be fine, and the nagging worry followed him into his nap.
Even thinking about it hurt, but the song helped, howled grief where he couldn’t. There were a lot of songs about war. He knew, of course, that muggles had wars too – they had been taught that the Grindelwald war had sparked a massive muggle war as well, but here it was in front of him: Bob Dylan’s anger in Masters of War was fierce and just in a way that said a war was clearly going on as it was written. Redbone sang about how everyone was wounded at something called Wounded Knee, “you and me”. Iron Maiden had so many songs about the horrors of war that he just about lost count.
And that’s when Draco broke, a torrent of tears, a weird roar of grief coming from his throat, more felt than heard, except from somewhere very far away. Harry’s hand was on his back, but that felt far away too. Forgiveness had happened to him while he wasn’t aware. Forgiveness wasn’t just a hypothetical about what he deserved, it was a fact, there whether he felt he deserved it or not.
“It’s not,” Kenny agreed. “I don’t know what you did, exactly, and I’m not sure I want to, honestly, but you need to make amends, if that is even possible. I can’t believe Harry is helping you!”
“A selection sounds good. So you... call a pizza place and ask them to make the pizza and bring it to your flat, right?” Harry looked happy about that.
But he couldn’t have explained that to Mary even if he had been able to speak, so just like he pretended to understand about the electrodes and wheelchair and elevator and what-not, he didn’t explain to her about the beard. He would have to keep the statute of secrecy, and Mary was a muggle. It was as simple as that, really. He couldn’t ask too many questions, even later, or betray his ignorance, or he would be discovered, and quite possibly burned at the stake.
“Reading,” Draco insisted, when they talked about what he wanted. “I mean, reading heavier things, like history.”
“I already knew I detested what he did, and what he made me do, too, I have known that for years. He raised me with the belief that what one did to lesser people didn’t matter, you know, that kind of thing. Ugly beliefs that I’m really glad to have shed, but that I shouldn’t have had to shed in the first place. They shouldn’t have been there! What right did he have to raise me to think of other people as worthless? As things that needed removing, not as people? It’s… he had no right.”
“I’ve seen them, I think. Look, I can call the flower people and ask them if they also know how to go about getting chocolate delivered?”
Draco couldn’t quite believe how his voice came out. He hadn’t known he was this angry. He had rejected his father’s actions and values long ago, but that rejection had been done quietly, without a word to anyone, and he had thought he had done it in a reasonable and measured way. His voice told a different story.
And unlike Mohammed, Draco could not hold it together until the ambulance people had left, he just let out a howl, and then clamped down on it, embarrassed.
“That actually makes sense, you know. I’ve never heard anyone but the Ravenclaws saying he needs to go, well, of course Hermione, but you know. And to be honest, I figured it was just because they were all swots who were hot for more schoolwork. But Draco, your soup is getting cold, you should finish it before solving more of the world’s problems.”
“You are right, she would not have taken that well. And you’re right that it’s true. I have few qualms about lying when something is as important as protecting the statute, really, but it gets in the way of relationships, and I don’t like that at all. Oh, by the way, I recently learned muggles are very unlikely to burn witches at the stake these days.”
“Yeah, I guess. I mean, nazis, really, but the thing is, I don’t get how you can just move away from that and be, you know, so cool with it? As if it doesn’t matter anymore because you’ve changed your mind a bit and realised the people you wanted dead were actual people all along, you know? You just move on now. You just get to move on. That’s not right, somehow, sorry.”
He wanted inclusion, he decided, and potentially he was vain enough to also want to be desired. That was only natural after all this illness. Nevermind, he would meet men, later, when the time was right. And in the meantime, he would make sure Kenny knew for sure he wasn’t straight, so it looked less strange when he inevitably had to make sure Harry knew. Unless Hermione would do it for him. That seemed likely, somehow, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on why.
No one really understood here, no one really could. It was an enormous relief to have Harry now, who understood quite a bit of both the muggle and the wizarding world, but actual understanding of his whole situation would be impossible. Harry had not grown up a wizard, the muggles had never been alien to him the way they had been to Draco when he came here. And he had never gotten much sicker than Draco was now. That part of the experience was not shared. Harry had not been as isolated, he had been able to call his friends the whole time, even if he could not see them.
“Well, I am trying to learn about muggle history, because… I can feel the edges of it, right, in things I read and the lyrics of songs, and I just want to understand it, I need to. There has been muggle wars too, and I keep seeing it refered to, and trying to understand it without the context is hard. And, and, and I just had at one point this realisation that there is a whole parallel history that I know nothing about… I want to learn.”
“Huh. Well, let me know if you want to learn a bit, when you get better. It’s good to know at least a little bit of cooking.”
His father was a lot less logical than his mother was – his hope wasn’t informed by things like what are the odds, or what is the healer’s professional opinion. No, Lucius was all feelings, and propriety, and a strong, intuitive understanding of power dynamics. He never would have sent Draco here – people might think it improper, it would weaken the family’s position, and so Lucius would not even have entertained the thought that it might help, the very concept would become too absurd to consider based on the things Lucius did consider, instinctively. Narcissa, though, had trusted knowledge, and given Draco a chance to recover.
“Vincent…” he started with a croak, but his voice gave out again. At least he was calmer. He felt himself being deftly manouvered back on down the pillow. “It’s okay,” Kenny whispered, “you can go back to sleep.” And somehow, he did.
This was when Mary brought him the folder. He couldn’t have said what it was about the smell of it, exactly, but it smelled right somehow, it smelled of home. It must be what the Healer said he would leave him – “everything he needed to know,” he vaguely recalled the man saying. Well, that was still an enticing promise, even after nearly a year awake – after all this time he still needed to know a whole lot. He hoped there would be some sort of guide to living with muggles without breaking the statute of secrecy. That was still his main challenge – what could he say, what would mark him as an outsider, a wizard? .
“Alrighty. Do you want to do the bedtime stuff, brushing teeth and all, or do you want to skip it for today?”
“MOTHER, you say I am not allowed to shout at guests, not even EVER, not even Frieda when she PINCHED me, and now YOU are doing it”
Harry called the hospital, who would give them no information about Mary because Draco and Harry weren’t Mary’s next of kin. Harry left a voice message on Vicky’s telephone instead. And then they rested, Draco in his bed, Harry on the sofa, with a pillow from Kenny’s bed.
Why hadn’t he told Kenny, though? Draco knew today was the first of June, vaguely, but still. The closeness to his birthday hadn’t really registered.
“Oi, I was just doing your paperwork, and it turns out it’s your birthday this Saturday!” Kenny sounded both excited and accusing. “Why didn’t you say? We want to celebrate you, you know! Oh, and if you don’t, it’s okay to say, obviously, I didn’t mean to be pushy or anything.”
“No, muggle technology has moved on quite a bit since castles. As have ours, come to think, but I suppose we just magically reinforced whatever buildings we have.”
“And there he was, Harry Potter,” Draco said, wildly. “And I was all ‘why is he helping me, why is he being so nice to me?’, but also I was too shocked by everything to even properly notice. It was strange, very strange.”
Apparently that was it, because she gently patted his hand and moved out of his line of sight. He closed his eyes, exasperated. He wanted to protest that a few sentences didn’t cover everything he wanted to know and there was nothing wrong with his thinking just because his body was weak, but of course there was, he could feel it. Just like he had when he had fallen ill.
“I am sorry, I just realised that Binns was the only history teacher you had access to. Most of the muggleborns, really. And that leaves some really big holes in your education. If Binns is still there, he needs to go,” Draco decided, in a rare rush of channeling his father on a political mission. Although if Lucius had seen the implications of this, he would have fought on the rest of the school board to keep Binns, of course. He might have without seeing the implications too, come to think. Harry was looking strangely at Draco now, so he explained in a rush:
As it turned out, Mary had had a stroke, which Draco actually knew about – one of those had killed his grandfather Abraxas, who had died tragically early at 82. Even with the war, most people had at least one living grandparent, but Draco had none. His main association with strokes was ‘deadly’, so it did not exactly feel like good news. “She’ll be fine?” he kept asking Harry, who waved him off while listening to Vicky.
They always had been allies, and always would be. And yet when he had been sick for a bit over a year, detoriating further and further, her parents had broken off their engagement, and married her off to Marcus Flint instead. Flint didn’t feel comfortable with Pansy visiting Draco anymore – her school sweetheart and ex fiance, after all, surely they understood that wasn’t really proper, right, especially after that fit Pansy had thrown about their engagement being broken off? He would accept them sending each other letters, though. That would have to do. After a few more months Draco couldn’t write those anymore either. And now that he was getting better again he would not be able to send any letters to anybody, because muggles didn’t have owls.
He was already up at the end of that, patting the back of his pants to check for his wallet, which always struck Draco as such an odd gesture for someone whose wallet was actually chained to his pants. Draco looked at Harry, and Harry was looking angry, but he was also nodding.
The next time he woke up he could feel someone in the room with him. He didn’t want to open his eyes quite yet, didn’t want to show that he had moved into being awake now, but somehow he must have given it away, because someone made a humming sound and there was a shuffle and then a few footsteps, and then a cool hand on his forehead.
“And YOU can kindly shut your mouth, Granger, I do not need your input. How dare you! You come into my house and insult my husband, and you –”
“Well, I haven’t been to regular school since I was ten, have I? I went to Hogwarts instead, didn’t I? So I got two halves of an education, and they don’t fucking fit all that well, to be honest.” He sounded quite upset, actually. Draco hadn’t realised that either.
“Okay, so. Your carer situation. It’s not good – you really need to find someone to do some things for you, and fast, or you will lose a lot of progress, even if you could handle things yourself, which I’m not sure you can. I don’t know exactly how much help you need each day or week or whatever, but you said your nurse does basically everything and still has more free time than she used to, so probably it’s less than full-time, yes?”
Harry gave Kenny the finger, then looked around to check Mary wasn’t looking their way. Draco had heard them argue about this before, and knew he would enjoy both of their selections. They were both excellent people to talk music with – separately. Any conversation about music that involved them both seemed to end up in a skirmish over the boundaries of punk.
We, he said. Harry still included himself in the muggles. Draco hadn’t realised that before now. Still, that was a terrible argument.
Draco was good at convincing people, and it felt both annoying and strangely good to run his words into the human wall that was Harry right now. Annoying because he knew he was right, there had to be a better solution, and this was undignified, and how on earth couldn’t Harry see that? Good because… he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. It felt safer, somehow, to argue out something with someone who didn’t seem affected by Draco’s passions, but at the same time, wasn’t that part of the annoying thing too, how unaffected Harry seemed by the whole thing?
“Don’t be sorry, he deserved it. He never thought his shit would catch up with him. He thought consequences were for other people. Lesser people.”
“I’m glad you let her. These phones are terrible to figure out on ones own, it’s hard enough with help, really. My mother had been taught, and she still had a bear of a time until Tippy stepped in. You seem to be doing a bit better than her.”
There was “Tracy Davis, a crow animagi, can you believe?!” and “Yes, Daphne and Theo seem really happy together, and now she’s pregnant again, as a matter of fact we’re having them over for dinner next Thursday, I really must remember to dealcoholise some of the good wine, it’s better when it’s done a few days in advance, you know.” and “Oh, and Astoria Greengrass is getting married to Fitz Flitwick, you know, Ravenclaw, a year over us, nephew of our teacher, not the side with the goblin ancestry, obviously. An excellent match, everyone says so.” And “Greg was here just last week, he is Sabine’s godfather, you know. He really seems to be doing much better. He says seeing a mind healer is very helpful.”
Draco frowned. He had nice and comfortable enough clothes – the ones he actually used, which were night clothes with a dressing gown, and a set of proper clothes, for when the time came to go out. He missed his wand, but he had as many remote controls in his life as he thought he was likely to have any use for. But…
“Oh, this and that. Gardening, quite a bit of reading, visitors for tea, that sort of thing. A spot of politics, now and then…”
“I’m okay. It is my first trip outside for a lot of years, and I am just… very happy.” He smiled at the child, who smiled back, not seeming to mind at all that she was constrained with straps. She had a pink toy in a soft-looking material, and its ear bore evidence of many hours of chewing.
Draco just shook his head. Surely he could get into bed himself. He rolled away into his room, struggled into bed, and found the pill. Only one of them at a time was kept by his bed, “for independence”, Mary said. He could have one whenever he felt the need to calm down, but that shouldn’t be very often, she had said. He took it now, with some water, the glass feeling heavier in his hand, harder to hold on to than it had in a long time. He grasped it with both hands as he drank.
“No, stop that, there will be time enough for all that later. Look, I promised Ron I would have a weeknight without meetings every week, and he’s basically jealous as a dragon about my time on those days off, so let’s just get to it. So. Your mother needs a telephone.”
“They what! Oh, those barbarians. I will get on that, I promise. I will find a way to get a phone to her, don’t worry, Draco. I will do whatever I have to, you hear me? We’ll fix this. Okay, I really need to go now. You will be able to talk to your mother soon, Draco, and to Pansy as well.”
“I’m so glad to think about you outside! Oh, to see you waste away in that bed – but that’s all over now. What is it like there, are there any gardens, any nature at all, or is it just houses and pavement?”
“Normally at the dining table, but maybe the kitchen table with a nice table cloth on it? It’s not that tall, I think I can probably sit there for half an hour or so.”
Getting muggle gay history explained is not going to be tidy no matter what, but it needs doing. Also, please remember that this convo takes place in 2004, not 2021. The mass AIDS losses in the gay community are still fresh, and the danger isn’t quite over either. Basically, this is a generation ago, and that matters. Harry and Draco are the youngest gen x, or the oldest millennials, depending on how you count it.
Kenny turned out to be a tall man their age, with an impressive bright red mohawk, a studded leather jacket, and a big nose ring that failed to make him look bovine. Draco had only seen punks in Rolling Stone Magazine, and he was pleased to meet one in real life, but he held back all his questions about punk music and culture for now.
Draco and Pansy had amended their vow at nine – they would not have sex when they married, because eww, and besides, they could just magic the stuff directly where it needed to go, anyway, and weren’t they lucky to have someone who also understood just how gross the whole sex thing was and didn’t want to, ugh,
“Oh, no. Oh my God. Harry thought Draco was pining for you. We had this long talk about it, actually, and… Romantically pining, I mean. And Harry, Harry still thinks… wait, is that phone still on? Hello? Hello!? Draco?”
“And to show that they have a large area of acceptable music, they still need to have something to mark the boundaries, something to exclude. What would happen if someone said they liked everything? I am willing to bet it would seem like they had no taste at all. Liking everything would send a message of no discernment. But somehow finding a way of marking the boundaries negates that.” He knew how that worked, the necessity of excluding something to place something else as acceptable. He’d thought about it a lot since coming to the muggle world. Kenny looked flabbergasted, though.
Draco knew he had slept, but he didn’t feel rested. He knew he had tried to call a house elf, and failed, for the first time in his life, and none had come to check on him either. They usually would, once an hour. And he could hear the healer again, entering. He could not hear his mother. The healer shuffled into a chair.
“No, it’s not adopting muggle fashion as such, not at all, Draco, it’s just one statement piece, carefully balanced with proper attire, of course. Your mother had done her hair up with a scroungie of green velvet matching her robes when I saw her at Gringotts a few weeks ago, for instance, and it looked lovely, but of course still very proper, and that’s the key, really. I have a muggle purse – doubly muggle, because it’s shiny, made of one of their unnatural materials, you know. That is a bold move, but you know me, I can pull it off. And speaking of bold, Hermione wears her hair in little braids with beads at the bottom. VERY muggle. And sometimes she wears jeans as well, which is a bit much, but obviously she looks lovely, and she is born muggle, after all, so she gets away with it.”
But Harry just shrugged off Draco’s rant. Surely if Kenny, who was both a competent nurse and a devoted and loving grandson, could think this was the best solution, not just for his grandmother, but for people in this situation in general, then they should trust his judgment. And that was that. Harry was immovable.
“Not letting you have pizza for lunch, you’re as bad as Harry,” Kenny grumbled, but he did go back to bed and stayed there for a while. Draco thought he might want to buy headphones like Harry had – that way he could have listened to music while Kenny slept. Surely this wasn’t the first time he would be up when Kenny was sleeping after work. Yes, he wanted headphones. He would have to ask Harry about it.
“They are. And it feels like I understand that whole thing people were saying about Leonard Cohen – that his music is influenced by country music. No, this is actually something. Can I borrow it to copy?”
“Well, the wizard chooses the house. Maybe he wanted to be brave more than anything, and then later failed at it. Utterly. I mean, he is a disgusting man, but that does not necessarily mean he always was like that.”
Then they sat down on the balcony with their mugs of tea, and Draco tried to pump Harry for all the information about muggle technology he had been longing to know, only to find that Harry was quite useless as a source of information. The microwave was short for microwave oven, he said, which meant it was an oven except it used microwaves to heat the food, not regular heat, Harry supposed. He absolutely could not explain what those microwaves were, though, so that wasn’t very helpful at all.
“I’m sorry too,” Draco said. “I have been learning, and I really think that’s a good thing, but I didn’t realise how much I needed to move beyond that. It’s like you said, I thought it was enough, or, I didn’t think, I just assumed, I guess. And I should have let you know, I just… didn’t realize. But it’s your business too. Not as much as Harry’s, but still. I’m really sorry I got to know you under false pretenses. I hope you know that wasn’t on purpose.”
“I’m not… cool with it,” was all he could say. “I’ve been learning, while sick. It’s not enough, though, I know that.”
“I have apologised to you, but I have not apologised to Hermione. I will need to do that once I come back to the wizarding world. And I owe apologies to many other people too. I know it’s not the only thing I have to do, but it’s somewhere to start that feels right. What do you think?”
“Sure, I will put on some Dolly Parton. She is good washing-up music, I imagine. And after that you’re getting Mary Gauthier. She is excellent, but probably the worst possible washing-up music. Except Leonard Cohen, perhaps.” Draco had never done any dishes in his life, of course, but it seemed like having catchy music would go with it, and Parton apparently had a broad appeal – which of course some people minded, too. She would do.
“...you’ve been isolated from your family this entire time?” Harry finished. “You don’t know how they are, they don’t know how you’re doing? You haven’t been able to talk to anyone for years? Nothing?”
“But then I came here. I had been so sick, and Mary was looking for things to bring me some joy as I was stuck in bed that also wouldn’t exhaust me, and she asked if I liked classical music. And I didn’t want to say I didn’t know one type of music from the other, so I just said yes.”
Someone shook him awake, but somehow Draco was still in the dream, losing Vincent, again and again, smoke filling his lungs, filling them forever. The someone got him up into a sitting position, but Draco still did not feel like he could breathe, he just sat there, rigid, gasping, trying to hold on to the real world, trying to get the dream to leave his body.
“No, once we found a place, Ron took me shopping for new clothes, and then I was exhausted and he went shopping for some other things I might need, without me. He had only ever been to muggle shops to browse, never to find specific things, well, except for the supermarket, and he’d never gone alone before, so that was a bit of a challenge for him. He really did it, though. I wish I had the energy to be with him in the electronics store, he was still ecstatic about it when he came back. Seeing that would be fantastic.”
His mother shouting that she would not leave her son die among muggles, and a darker voice answering, something he could not hear, but it sounded firm, brutal. His mother crying – oh, he was dying, then, after all. The healer had tried, with the arm poking method, which had indeed been unpleasant, and it had failed, and now he was dying. Nothing else could possibly push his mother over the edge like this. And she said leave him to die. And dying among muggles. Why among muggles? He tried to stay awake, then, to say goodbye, but he slipped under anyway. He...
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. “Yeah, they did. And that’s not okay, and I’m not okay, and… But I am an adult now, and I get to choose how to deal with this. And you get to as well. And Kenny gets to decide how he deals with this information too. And I’m sorry, Kenny, I should have probably told you, I didn’t mean to hold it back, I seriously just didn’t think of it, but I see that I maybe should have.”
“Do you have a pill you take when you’ve done a bit much? Because if you do, then you should probably take one now. Oh, good, you do. Do you have access to it, or do I need to hunt down the medicine cabinet? Good, then. Need any help?”
He didn’t know if Harry felt convinced by his logic or amused by him somehow – a quiet smile as he flipped through the thin, yellow pages had Draco suspect the last of them.
“They come out and bounce around in there instead of the heat, I think,” Harry tried. “Going through the food, heating it up?”
Then, while married, the wizard would either have loose connections on the side, though how that would be accomplished outside of school, Draco didn’t really know, or he would find a steady boyfriend, who mostly would not live with him, though there were exceptions to that, too. It hadn’t occurred to Draco that this was something to be questioned, as it seemed to work out, but… things were different in the muggle world.
“I did, and I thoroughly wish I did not. Though I suppose it was instructive. He was one of the people who really made me aware of all the hypocrisy going around there.”
“I don’t understand, though,” Harry said, “Why your nurse would buy something this posh. Why you would, oh, that makes perfect sense, especially after the chocolate, but why would she not shop around for a bit, find something a little more reasonably priced?”
“Hermione, Draco is as homosexual as the day is long. We wouldn’t even have had sex for baby reasons, there are other ways to go about that. And we were best friends, just the very thought of kissing him on the mouth feels rather incestous to me, frankly. No offense to you and your husband, obviously that is different.”
“Draco? Is this working? Can you hear me through the… phone?” she asked. Her voice was just as he remembered it, and yet somehow richer, even through the telephone. Tears filled his eyes. He was crying a lot lately, he thought. Mary would probably say it was good for him.
“Yes! He even adds more magic sometimes. I mean, the charm needs renewing once a month or so, but it’s really not a big deal. Hermione customised the spell a bit so it’s more flexible and lasts for about a year if it’s cast on fairly small things, and, well, for a mobile phone you will also need an adapted stasis spell on the SIM card, but that’s not very hard either, and you only have to do it once. Lots of people have phones now, Draco, don’t be such a pureblood snot. Wait, you...”
“Ignore Harry’s mix, though, it’s just got a lot of pop that think it’s punk,” Kenny said. “But I guess it’s the thought that counts.”
“Alright, very good. Now I know what to do for you. I will be frank with you: It will be extremely unpleasant, but it does give you a fair chance of survival, a fair chance indeed! I will leave you a folder of information for you to peruse when you feel up to reading, but that will be some time off yet. The recovery will take time. You will have a nurse to take care of you. Just listen to her, she will know what to do. Let me say that again, you are to listen to her and follow her instructions, that is extremely important. And don’t break the statute of secrecy, that’s very important too, obviously. Best of luck, Draco!”
Kenny was good at cooking. His grandma had taught him, Harry said. She was now in a home, with dementia. Then he had to explain to a horrified Draco what he meant with ‘a home’, and as much respect as Draco had learned to have for muggle culture, this one he just couldn’t stomach. No, he didn’t buy it – it could hardly be impossible to care for their elders in a better way, could it, even if they didn’t have the guarding spells and tracking spells that one had to use on small children and sometimes elderly people whose mind was going? Surely their last years should be spent in their home. And don’t get him started on ‘a home’, who in their right mind would call…
He missed his mother, too, fiercely, and worried for her. He was glad she had sent him here. “To die among muggles,” she had said, but clearly she had also understood that there was hope of survival and recovery, or she simply wouldn’t have done it. He was glad she had made that decision for him, and felt chilled when he realised there was no way that would have been possible if his father hadn’t been in Azkaban.
“Umh. So, flowers are a traditional thank-you-gift too, but I don’t think any of us are flower guys, really. Whisky? No, Mo doesn’t really do booze, I think, just beer? Chocolate, maybe? But Draco, you don’t need to get me anything, and I really don’t think anyone would expect any –”
He tried to breathe, tried to focus. Breathe. Breathe. Did Mary breathe? He had no idea. He didn’t have his wand to check, of course. He couldn’t see any breathing, but that didn’t necessarily mean it wasn’t there. He didn’t dare to get down on the floor with her to find out, because getting back up would probably be beyond him if he did, and then how would he find help?
He shook the morose thought off as well as he could and walked over to the sofa. The living room was lit only by the moon, looking so different than it used to. He picked up an old copy of Rolling Stone that he had read every little piece of already, and lit a small reading lamp on the side of the sofa. He read what Bruce Dickinson had to say in the big interview, trying to make his thoughts go there instead. But the thought was lodged there, stubbornly insistent. He could not quite distract himself from it. He had gone through something no one else could ever understand. He would need to find a way to live with that.
“Marrying your best friend. I feel like that, I really do.” The smile in Hermione’s voice reached all the way to Hastings.
Draco drove his own chair over the threshold with the joystick, slowly in case of any bumps, but the floor aligned nicely with the street. Mary had said she had picked this building in part because it would be so easy to get out – he would not have to deal with ramps, which she had assured him was such a bother, though of course very helpful when needed. Oh, Mary should see him now.
Granted, there had still been the little matter of Voldemort living in his house. His mother had accepted that too, to some degree. He didn’t know if she had any real way to resist it, but he found he was angry with her too.
“Well, lots of things, I suppose. But I did read quite a lot of science fiction this winter. It’s very educational.”
The next year was tolerably nice. Hard too, of course, but what Mary had promised him held true: Everything did feel less bad with time, as long as he didn’t try to do too much, too fast. He made great progress, though: He had started getting out of bed and into one of the comfortable chairs in his room, and in the months after that he was learning to use the restroom, which thankfully worked similarly to wizarding ones. Then getting from his bed to the restroom by himself, supported by a walker, which was basically a support frame on, indeed, wheels. When he had mastered that consistently, he could finally getting rid of the waste tubes and bags and all, and wasn’t that a glorious day! Unhooked from all muggle tubes at last – wonderful!
Harry must have seen that he had lost Draco to somewhere dark, and charged on, dragging him out of there.
“What my mother did was despicable, and it was just luck that let a good marriage grow from it. I have told her so often enough, but she can’t see it. A good thing that I don’t have sisters, that’s what I tell her, because if she had two daughters to marry off, chances are the other one would not end so well. But she has no power over me now. And the children have godparents that are ready to take them if anything should happen to me and Marcus. She will never get to make decisions for them.”
“Well, I wasn’t about to let him know that, was I? How stupid do you think I am, Granger? So now you’ve moved on to insulting me instead of my husband, is that it? Well, if we’re done being polite, not that you ever were, you can take your phone, and stick –”
Draco thought perhaps his brain must be addled by too long among muggles – he hadn’t even thought about how the situation could be construed that way for someone who hadn’t been party to his and Harry’s conversation. He groaned.
“No, I. I am sorry. I am not really hungry yet, but we can look at the microwave if you want.” Draco wanted the last word in this strange dance of apologies, and he had it now, he was fairly certain, by squeezing in one last apology. Harry caved.
“Well, shit. So you’re not well enough to go out yet. That’s all the more reason to fix you up with a carer of some sort, then. I have a thought, but seriously, you look exhausted. Do you… umh, need a nap? I can just sit here and wait. Or if you’re not comfortable sleeping knowing I’m in your apartment, I could go to that café just outside, have a coffee or something, and come back later. It’s no trouble.”
“You’re not anymore, though,” Harry broke in, strangely insistent. “I know you don’t agree with that shit anymore, not even a little. I know how much you care about Mary. And you’re friends with me. You apologised to me! You’re just not like that anymore. You don’t view… other people as less.”
Draco had thought about this. Mary hadn’t seemed to react to his parents being strict about music, but Kenny seemed both confused and upset. Draco considered lying, amending what he had said, saying he was only allowed classical music – that’s what he had let Mary think, after all, when she assumed it – but he wanted to share the whole story of discovering music, too. Surely that was possible.
“Yeah, my sister has a good CD burner, so if I can borrow some CDs from you, then she can copy them for me. I can play them on my disc-man. It won’t harm your CDs, and I’ll be careful. I know how much you care about your music collection.”
“Fuck if I know. Do what feels right, just do something, don’t stop growing, but figure it out yourself. I mean, it should be your job, finding out, shouldn’t it. Hell, I bloody well don’t owe you figuring it out for you.”
He talked to Pansy at length later that night, not letting on that he had been present to her surprising array into friendship with Hermione. Pansy had plenty to say about what people had been up to.
“Yes,” he said. It came out a croak. He tried again. “Yes. I was.” He wanted to defend himself, but there wasn’t a defense, was it? There just wasn’t.
As he was able to talk more, he found himself missing Pansy intensely. He missed her input, and the feeling of it being them against the world. It had always been the two of them, ever since their solemn vow at five that they would marry each other. The adults had been delighted, and confirmed the engagement, instead of discourage them, which Draco only later realised they hadn’t had to do.
His mother’s sharp intake of breath. Not the kind of thing you asked, normally. Even a healer wouldn’t.
“Yes, they are. Very lucky that they showed up. And Mohammed knew first aid, did they tell you? The ambulance people said what he did really improved your chances of making it, and here you are.”
Happily, after a little while of that, sucking food through a straw was the next step. First he was given something called nutritional drinks, which were utterly foul-tasting, and then pureed soups and pureed fruit drinks, which were a lot better. Not his idea of food, for the most part, but still, even the strange fruit-and-spinach drink Mary served him was better than the nutritional drinks had been. For a few weeks he had worried that all muggle foods would taste as bad as those drinks did. He had tried to think of how to ask Mary about that without exposing himself as non-muggle, but he couldn’t think of a way. The relief when he realised proper food would probably be available later was more intense than it had any right to be.
That was strange to Draco, because Harry looked perfectly well. He looked completely healthy, and Draco had thought about how much he wanted to be that healthy, ever since he first saw Harry again. And he still wanted that, of course. But apparently there was still quite a lot of managing, and not overdoing things, at Harry’s level. And apparently Harry had a pattern of overdoing things. Which, Draco tactfully refrained from pointing out, Harry has always had.
Speaking of which, he would have to keep these papers locked up somehow, they were dangerous if muggles got their hands on them. Did muggles have lockboxes? Of course, Mary had had every opportunity to read this for a year, and if she hadn’t by now, she probably wouldn’t either. But there were other muggles. A cleaning woman who came by on Wednesdays. Mary’s sister, who sometimes brought groceries. No, he needed to find a lockbox of some sort.
“No, we did not know what was wrong with me. My mother tried to figure it out – there was an entire parade of healers. She only found the right healer just in time, really. It wasn’t like that for you?”
But mostly it felt like slipping away, falling backwards into nothingness. It felt like time happened and didn’t happen, a whole lot of both, of greyness that was both time and space. It lasted forever, until it didn’t.
“Magic as a technology, now that is a very interesting thought.” Of course his mother caught that, he thought fondly.
A fair chance. Statute of secrecy. Why on earth. This didn’t make any sense. But maybe if he could only… but he couldn’t only. Thinking was beyond him again. And then he slept.
“Yes, and it has changed me, but at the same time, that doesn’t mean that is enough either, like you said.”
“Then something else! Potions! People that aren’t potions masters use potions all the time. I’m absolutely sure you must have taken potions you don’t know how to brew. I know I have. I have even taken potions Hermione doesn’t know how to brew!”
After lunch Kenny went out to buy things at some store where apparently they had a big variety of electronic stuff. He came back with a microwave, and said they’d be sending not just the mini fridge they’d agreed on, but also a big chest freezer. Draco didn’t know what a chest freezer was, but presumably there were no plans to freeze his chest, so he supposed it was best not to get in the way of Kenny doing what he thought best.
“I don’t know. But before that, as long as you married and didn’t make a fuss, apparently a discreet relationship on the side was quite acceptable for much of history. And if it wasn’t, it was because fidelity was important, not because of homosexuality, you know?”
“Not false pretenses, really” Kenny answered, long after the natural time to answer had gone by. “You’re still you, aren’t you? I’m just having some trouble reconciling the you I know with Harry’s stories. Not that he’s telling those anymore, or have since we’ve known you, really.”
“Of course it’s not that simple. I’m not saying everyone should pretend it didn’t happen, that would be really wrong too. I’m just saying, there needs to be a way out of whatever shitty position, really, otherwise people will just stay there more than they need to, you know, when they would have left it otherwise?”
Okay, the thing indeed looked like a telephone, like he thought, and he’d seen pictures of those, and of people using them, too – lift it up to your ear and mouth and then push buttons, right? “Reception, press 0 and wait” said a little shiny text on the side of the thing. He did. For a long, terrible while, nothing happened, and then he heard a shouted “hello” very, very far away. He shouted back across the enormous distance: “Hello, hello, HELP, PLEASE HELP!” His voice was so broken, so fearful – and the voice far, far away said something, but he couldn’t hear what. “This is Draco Malfoy”, he shouted, “please help, please come to my flat and help, right away!”, hoping he was talking loudly enough to be heard by the other person. How odd, the way his voice came out, all squeaky, childlike. He couldn’t remember that happening before, back when things were worse.
“I think that’s a great idea, but I don’t see why you want to wait until you come back. I mean, doing it in person would be best in one way, I guess, but that will also take years, and how is that worth it? You can have her number, and then just call her. And I think you should.”
Mary also pointed out that in principle he had a lot of power over her as her employer, but that in practice he did not use it. Still, knowing it was there of course affected everything – for her. She was also on her hand very aware of her power over him as a nurse to her patient. There was a lot of power in knowledge, especially the state-sanctioned knowledge of a formal education, she said, which made sense. She talked about how nursing school also taught students not to use that power, mostly, but that it was hard to listen sometimes. Simply abstaining wasn’t possible, as sometimes you needed what she called soft paternalism – sometimes you actually needed to tell the patient what was best for them and steer them in a certain direction. Doing it when necessary and not doing it when it wasn’t was the most difficult part of her job, she said, and she had been in nursing for almost thirty years.
The receptionist, not Mohammed this time, but a petite blonde named Tina, waved at them and told them good luck. The door swished open on its own accord as he neared it. He had gotten close enough for that to happen last time, too, and he had nearly jumped out of his chair in alarm. This time he knew what to expect, though.
“Thank God, because I have done everything I can, and to be honest, I don’t know if she’ll make it, but what the fuck do I know anyway, I’m not a doctor. We just need to hold it together until they’ve left, and then I’ll scream for a bit. Shit.” He nodded decisively. “Such a lovely woman, too. This must have been terrible for you, mr. Malfoy, finding her like this.”
He got through four or five books a week. Some were gotten from the library, but most of them he bought. Mary would order them for him at the bookstore. Handily, most books had a list of names of other books by the same author, or similar books by the same publisher, so he didn’t seem to run out very often.
Harry kept coming over every Tuesday. If Kenny was there, he would join them in conversation between doing other things around the house. Harry and Kenny were friends, of course, but clearly Kenny also understood that Draco and Harry wanted time to talk about their own things too. Draco sometimes wondered what Kenny imagined those things to be – certainly not a magical world they both secretly belonged to, a parallel society that Kenny knew nothing about. Draco and Harry would sit on the veranda, or in the outer living room, and talk about the similarities and differences between muggle and wizarding culture.
“If it helps, this will make me a lot more comfortable with the entire situation, which I need to be in order to ask for help. So please stop protesting and help me find the number for someone who sells good chocolate. And then, having bought you chocolate, I will hopefully feel up to asking for help figuring out muggle money things so I can pay you back the money you’ve spent on me this far, too, and paying Kenny for his work, too. So you see, we very much need to order this chocolate”
“Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy, and I would like to order three gifts of chocolates to be delivered to my home.”
It had started out over two years ago with just small things. Dizzy spells that almost sent him off his broom until his mother asked him to please don’t fly until they had figured it out. Tiredness, soreness everywhere. Sicking up everywhere if he tried to apparate or floo. And then he had just remained at home, trying to take walks in the garden, and frequently failing, getting the occasional visitor, reading books and writing letters. He had deteriorated further, until he couldn’t reach beyond his room, and letters were beyond him, but he stayed in first his chair and then his bed, propped up on pillows, rereading children’s books he had loved as a child, because that was all he could focus on, and it was something. He had been miserable enough about it at the time, but he missed it now – the sitting up, the books, the light from the window. The trays of food, already cut up, easy to eat. The elves magicked the food right into his stomach now.
“But I read this book last year,” Draco said this Tuesday, too, “this muggle book – ” Harry laughed, fondly, as if he was saying that of course you did, Draco, of course you did, but also, probably, because by now it was expected, a small joke between them. Draco forged ahead. “And it’s from the early 1800s, and it really seems marriage customs were a lot more similar to wizarding ones than today’s muggle marriage customs are.”
“Thanks on behalf of my house, I guess. But just think about how Neville is in Gryffindor, and it may make more sense how Kenny would be in Hufflepuff.”
Kenny had made tea, and a huge cream cake with strawberries. It was excellent. Draco spent most of the time talking to Mary – every word out her mouth took extra long, because something had happened to her facial muscles. “Stroke,” she said, looking quite put out. “Mess up. Everything!” And then, “Glad you. Are. Safe. Dra-a-aco!”
“Faster is probably better. I don’t know much about phones, anyway, I just chose the same type Harry uses, the Nokia 3310, so it would be easy to learn, you know.”
“No wait, and the thing is, even if muggles HAD been doing worse, that would not have proven anything, you know? Because of course someone with more experience will be better at something in general. Like, a third year will be better at most spells than a first year. You are better at muggle technology than I am. It’s the same thing, and I chose not to see that.”
“What,” Harry said. “You look like you’ve just seen a ghost. Which is a muggle expression, because muggles don’t, you know. It wasn’t a joke because Binns is one, gah, I mean, it could have been, but it wasn’t. What I mean to say is, what’s going on?”
He still rested a lot, about five hours of every day went to some form of rest, but he felt so much stronger than he had, even while resting. It got even more boring, though, it always felt like he had energy to use that he couldn’t. This, Mary said, was often the tricky part for many people. The more he rested, the more of his non-resting time he could use to improve, to use his body. The rest supported all that. She wasn’t just talking about the stretching exercises and using the walker, but also things like leaning forward over the puzzle, leaning backwards in the sun on the veranda, stretching a hand out for his cup of tea. All of that was supported by the rest, she assured him. Just the right balance between activity and rest was the way, as it had been all this time, just that now that activity was more normal. He craved normalcy so much – so he rested.
“Oh, I know, nobody has believed that sort of thing for years, Draco.” He felt a little put out at that.
“And yours!” She didn’t sound entirely happy, though. “Granger is here, teaching me to use the phone. She just showed up, but I let her do whatever she wants, apparently, because she offered me the opportunity to talk to you, and obviously, talking to you was important to me.” That sounded addressed as much to Hermione as to him, but it raised some questions. Do whatever she wanted? What was that supposed to mean? What was Hermione doing? Clearly something Pansy disliked.
Muggle music was varied and lovely. He enjoyed most of it, both the process of exploration and the ones who found their way into regular rotation. He would lay flat with his eyes closed, listening to a whole record at a time. He would read the booklet first – not the lyrics, that was for later, for records he especially enjoyed, but the name of the songs, the names of the people who had written the lyrics, the music, who played which instruments. Usually he would do a new unheard record after his morning rest (listening to music was, apparently, to be considered a light activity at his current functioning level, but for some reason Mary still didn’t count classical music).
They started with class and race and gender, as that was where their differences were. All of these were stacked in Draco’s favor, and he realised it was true that they had been largely invisible to him as mechanisms of power, even as they had been visible as differences, differences that meant something, and as weaknesses his father would teach him to look for when he needed, and exploit.
Most muggle music, it turned out, did have lyrics, just like wizarding music did. It was only the classical that didn’t, and the occasional record or track. But the music itself still played a much greater role than he was used to. Much of it was far better, which was infuriating, because wizarding musicians had magic and could have applied that properly to make even better music. They hadn’t, though, or at least not as far as Draco knew. They had just used magic to make background noise, in support of singing, which was for the most part not very good either. It annoyed him, but he still wasn’t about to miss out on exploring, because music was rapidly becoming his main joy in life.
“Yeah, those are ugly things. But enough of kids grow up with hate and disgust of other groups in some form or another, and not enough of them shed it. I’m glad you did, man, really glad. Good for you, good for the world.”
“Will do.” Harry smiled into his phone as he tapped furiously. “Okay, that’s that. And you don’t need to do your apology thing, Hermione knows that was your intention in the first place and that you’re not doing it just to get her help, so that’s okay.”
“So apparently your carer is still unconscious, but likely to wake up soon. They hadn’t told her sister much more than that. You’re not thinking of going to the hospital, are you? You look knackered, to be honest, and you probably can’t do much good there, so I don’t think you should, if you want my opinion at all.”
Harry winced. Ah, yes, it made sense now, that Harry was trying to get them off the topic of nemeses. Enemies were perhaps a better word. Clearly Kenny had heard about him, a collection of stories he was only now connecting to Draco. Draco had stepped in it, and no mistake. He nodded stiffly.
“So, well. Thank you for being here. And I hope you will come over after I don’t need your help, too. For, well, for tea. And conversation.”
It was, Draco thought as he drifted off, a very nice day this far, all in all. He was worried for Mary, though. Harry had received a text message from Vicky on Friday – “Please tell Drayco she will probably live”– which had been reassuring when he had assumed more messages would be forthcoming, but now, when no more messages had come, was quite the opposite. At the same time he didn’t want to disturb Vicky when it wasn’t necessary. Draco’s own situation was fine, after all, except for the worry gnawing in his stomach. He was fine.
“Your mother could probably do all that, given enough time, if it was for you, but I don’t think we need to take it quite that far. Look, I’m texting Hermione right now, and you can go find your phone. Right now, Draco. Go, go, go.”
The slight update of that amendment had come at fifteen, after months of Draco pining after Sebastian Rosier, because having a thing for boys didn’t excuse him from marrying a woman and producing heirs. Pansy would be free to pursue her pleasure elsewhere as soon as the heir thing was done with, of course.
If Lucius had suggested that this getting marked business was a big decision and the best thing would be to wait until after Hogwarts, Draco would have listened to that, he felt fairly sure. He could have been neutral. There had been plenty of shades of neutral in Slytherin, and in Ravenclaw too. He could have had that, to some degree. He could have joined the passive sympathy for the cause of Daphne and Theodore, if not the studied neutrality of Blaise.
Draco experienced the outside for the first time in years about early in June. He was in his wheelchair, and he had done a test run down to the reception the week before with Kenny. Still, it was all new: The elevator ride felt exciting this time too, and very much like science fiction – a silvery, square capsule moving through an invisible shaft to get him to his destination, yes, but also the hissing sound, the feeling of utter newness of experience. He was already a bit high on it when he reached the ground floor and rolled into the reception.
Then he wove carefully between the people, who gave him space for the most part, and placed himself by the fence that protected pedestrians from the sharp fall down to the beach. He closed his eyes and let the sun warm his face. He had done that before, of course, many times, but that had been on his balcony. The sounds of the sea was nearer here too, six floors down and quite a bit closer than he was used to. This spot wasn’t far from his building at all, but it was a different world, one he had been looking down at for the last year and a half or so. It was familiar for that reason, but still strange and alien up close. And now he was here. Tears of gratitude over every single thing – the sun, the waves, the beach, the people, the life force of it all, rolled down his cheeks.
There was another piece of information that greatly disturbed him: After about two months awake, he was able to lick his lips, and realised that he had grown a beard. Presumably muggles had some odd ideas about beards, as Mary had thought it was perfectly acceptable to just let him, Draco Malfoy, 23 years old, grow one – to save him the friction from shaving, apparently. She understood now that he was distressed, she said, and promised to get rid of it as soon as possible.
He was hooked up to quite a lot of muggle devices: A permanent needle in his arm fed him some liquids and perhaps food, that part was unclear, while tubes took care of waste. There was also something called electrodes, mostly on his chest and neck, but they were removed after a few days. There was something around his arm that sometimes made a wooshing noise before clenching his arm hard and gradually releasing it, and a soft clamp on his finger, apparently the muggle version of some diagnostic spells. A clever workaround, to be sure, but it certainly showed how exhausting muggle life was. And here he was, among muggles for the next several years.
He just lay for a while, quietly enjoying the feeling of possible, before he even took advantage of it, before real thoughts started forming. They had taken him away, hadn’t they. Away. To die among muggles, his mother had said, after the healer tried to save him. Except he was alive. He had a chance to live, the healer had been very insistent on that point. So perhaps he hadn’t failed. That was it, then, that must have been it, yes. So. The healer had figured it out, he’d told Draco. And now he was among the muggles, that must be why everything smelled wrong. Why would they send him to muggles? Muggle medicine better? No, his mother would not have believed that, even if the healer somehow did. So. Because of the rare disease, that’s why. Because... it was a muggle disease? That only the muggles knew how to cure?
Draco nodded, but didn’t say the next thing on his mind: That then Lucius had volunteered him as a soldier for the cause. Shown him the pride that he would have in him if he did, and how disappointed he would be if Draco didn’t, and how much it would cost them politically if not. Of course Draco was swayed.
So, that was a chapter. Balancing these three points of views is tricky, especially in an explosive conversation like this. I don't think i could have done it without Harry's temper.
“But it’s not like that! Everyone in the magical world is not surrounded by animagi or using the animagi spells or being animagi all the time without understanding even the basics about how it works! That’s why we have the animagus register. Your analogy doesn’t work!”
He had been improving steadily at the time. Perhaps the relief he had felt over that had covered up some of the horror. But now he thought back at it, the horror felt fresh, not covered up with that relief, that hope. Well, not fresh. Fetid, rotten. He had been scared, too, but even the fear had been pushed aside.
“He’s a PUNK,” Draco half-whispered back, in spite of at least half agreeing with Harry’s assesment. “Punks would automatically be sorted into Gryffindor, I’m pretty certain.”
Draco nodded, and Harry pushed the number buttons as Draco watched, and put the phone to Draco’s ear. Draco held it the way he had seen Harry do it. He wanted to do this part himself, too, the numerals. It didn’t seem very difficult. The book of phone numbers had made him feel very confident that this phone thing was something achievable. He wanted his own telephone, he wanted the power to order whatever he needed. In fact, he felt that if he could only master the phone and the muggle money, he could have a lot of independence, even though he still needed the help of another human to get through life for a while more. A few other humans, he amended.
Draco must had looked a bit worried at the last, because Harry said “he’s just hot air, you’ll get used to it. He’s a total Hufflepuff, I promise.”
The muggle was wearing pastel pink, but the similarity with his old teacher stopped there, thankfully. She was perhaps his mother’s age, though of course it was hard to tell with muggles because of their shorter natural lifespan. Her dark eyes looked kind behind brown, framed glasses, and her skin and hair were brown, too. “Oh, wonderful, you are awake! I am Mary, your nurse. Don’t try to speak yet, or move at all. You won’t succeed, and you will make yourself very sick by trying. You are still very ill, but you are getting better slowly, and you will probably keep getting better and reach a full recovery, or close enough. I will give you information little by little, day by day, because you’re still very weak, and too much information at once can be confusing. But you can trust that I will give it all.”
The thought of skipping oral hygiene was absurd, but so was trying to work this man into the steady routine he and Mary had for this sort of thing. Somehow either option seemed perfectly impossible, and he found himself just staring back at Kenny, wide-eyed.
Kenny had double day shifts both Saturday and Sunday, and after that he had a “more sane” schedule. Taking it easy on Monday was probably best, though, getting some rest in, with luck a few hours of work here would be enough that day, Kenny said. The lasagna in the oven had a brother already in the fridge that they would eat that day, so Kenny wouldn’t have to cook. They would attempt a partly assisted shower if Draco was feeling up for it, though. He really wanted one, he normally had one on Friday, but showering was definitely a heavy activity, so it really shouldn’t be attempted until Monday. Tuesday, arrival of the freezer and small fridge, and then grocery shopping and batch cooking, and maybe a chat to see how things are working out for us both so far, yeah? Wednesday, well, hopefully a calm day and then the evening shift.”
“They married her off to Marcus Flint,” Draco croaked. “When I was sick, when I wasn’t getting better.” How did that pain always feel so fresh?
“Thanks!” Kenny beamed. “Learned from my grandma, at first, and then from cookbooks and stuff. It’s a satisfying thing, really. Do you cook? Before you got sick, I mean?”
The other man looked mollified, in spite of the clumsily delivered apology, offering a sad smile in return. Sometimes Draco wished he was able to deliver every line with a punch, like his father was. Well, Lucius never would have apologised for something like this in the first place, so that was neither here nor there, and a punch of any sort would be unlikely to help the situation, come to think of it. What would his mother do, though? Just be graceful about it all, he supposed. Allow mistakes. Be discerning about what to share and who to share with, but when she did decide to share openly, fully – she would open her entire heart to the conversation, both in speaking and in listening. That was who he wanted to emulate – and who he had been learning to emulate, a little. He hoped. He needed to ask her about that.
“Well, I suppose I didn’t have much in the way of knowledge, to start with. Not about genre, for instance – what makes something rock-and-roll? What makes something the kind of rock-and-roll that can almost be considered proto-punk? I had no idea, and I still only know what I see written about it, and what it says on the cover or in the booklet. Which generally does not include genre, for some reason. So the best was interviews, because then I could see more of what the artist themself thought about their work. And now I am starting to get a grasp on genre, but that is only from listening to a lot of music and comparing that to what I see written about it. What I do find covered, I mean, most of my CDs I have never seen any proper coverage of.”
“And with that voice, now I can too. Your Dumbledore impression is even better than Daphne’s, I am impressed.”
“Nah, not on you. But Draco, I find this is all hard to deal with. I don’t know how I can… I mean, it changes the way I see you, you know. I hate people like you. Sorry, but it’s true, I do.”
She could have taken Draco and fled, surely. Oh, he would have resisted that, and probably put both of their lives in danger in the process, but Narcissa was a smart woman. Surely she could have potioned him into obedience or unconsciousness. She could have stolen the ancient Malfoy portkey collection, so they wouldn’t know which one she had used, and then apparated from there. The apparation traces would be gone by the time they figured out where they had gone unless their luck was very bad. And then they could have lived out the rest of it somewhere. A sleepy greek village, or a big muggle city somewhere. There were certainly enough of them.
“My shit is mine to work with,” Kenny said gruffly, decapitating a carrot, “and as Harry has been telling me, I have a job to do there, so fuck me, I guess. And your shit is yours to work on, and I won’t, well. Try to tell you what to do. I’m sorry I did, earlier, I shouldn’t have. And I know you had distanced yourself from that shit, and that you were upset about being taken in by it. Fuck, you told me as much already, I just assumed it was more, like, garden variety bigotry, I guess. So I’m actually really sorry about ignoring that, too.” He still looked thunderous, though.
“Okay, yeah, I thought you might. At least you’re not hyper, that’s a much worse sign. Hey, Draco, please let me know if I explain to you stuff you already know, yeah? So. This means you will need to do some extra rest for a few days. Which may be fairly hard as there will also be some demands on you, like some changes in your routine because we don’t know each other that well yet, and because I’m not here all the time like Mary is.”
“Alright, blood pressure will have to wait, pulse at 87, oxygen at 97, hmmm” the someone said, a woman. A muggle, he reminded himself, presumably, anyway. He knew the words, pulse, oxygen, but that didn’t mean anything out of context. The numbers were all nonsense, of course. He heard a click. “Draco, can you hear me?” He felt his eyelids twitch as if commanded somehow, so he opened his eyes.
He didn’t answer. Clearly he wasn’t meant to have overheard that, any of that. He pretended to be made of stone until he heard the little click that signaled the end of the phone call. He was still a bit new to phones, and she knew that, so surely Hermione would just think that he had forgot to push the button to hang up. He had just learned he should last month, so that was plausible enough.
“You were screaming,” Kenny said, pushing a glass of water to Draco’s lips while supporting his neck. Draco sipped, throat feeling sore, as if the smoke still reached him through all these years.
He had tried to have another ice cream at the café table, but that had turned out to be way too much – people making noises, people bumping into his chair, jolting him. They had to give up and retreat to the fence where they had the first ice cream. Kenny suggested they tried again on a greyer day, or off the season, but those weren’t the best days for ice cream, so it wasn’t as tempting.
“Want to go back in? We can, you know. This is still a huge success, having been outside among people for the first time in years.”
“Well, my mother says that it is very important to please our past selves, especially the child past selves. I hope your past self will be happy with the chocolate.”
“Oh. Good. I. Yes. Tell her to tell my mother I love her, too, please. I mean, obviously she knows, but. Still.” His mother would be very surprised to have a missive from Hermione Granger, of course, but not, he thought, displeased, not at all, especially given the content of the message.
“She did, and thank you for that, I appreciate it a lot. I have enjoyed that view a lot, especially before I could go outside. I only started outside excursions this summer, you see, and it’s still only once a week.”
Something was stuffed in his ears. Something pierced his arm. Something was over his eyes. No, he wanted to say, no, I’m not dead yet, no! You’ve misunderstood! Need to say goodbye! To mother, my mother, goodbye.
“Pansy,” he croaked. “And Greg too, but oh, Pansy. My mother will certainly owl her, though, to let her know I’m okay.”
“And how is it that ‘most people’ have decided not to dislike these two genres specifically? That sounds like being prejudiced to me. And believe me, I have been prejudiced about a lot of things in my life.”
Eating breakfast at the long table in the dining room, him seated at head of the table, watching the table stretch out in front of him, and his parents to each side. Scratch that, scratch that, never quite like that again, even after he returned home it would not be quite like that. But perhaps the food…
“Oh. Alright, we can… talk when you’re ready. If you want to. Some other time. I really did not mean to, either, we were suddenly… just in the middle of it.”
“Oh, fuck off, Ken, I get to decide myself who I help!” Harry exploded. “This shit happened to me, I am the one who experienced it, and will I decide exactly how to deal with that myself, thankyouverymuch! And I’m not making excuses for him either, okay? What Draco did was shit, he was a cruel little shit, yeah? And yes, he followed a guy that made my life hell on earth, and who wanted to make a lot more people’s lives hell, and of course I’m pissed about that, but I get to decide what to do with that! And I say it matters more what he does as an adult than what he did when he was just a snotty little kid! He was brought up to this shit, get it? He was pushed full of this propaganda ever since he was a child! Fuck, he was still a child! A FUCKING CHILD!”
“Splendid, we have eight more questions. Have you ever have some sort of backlash from your wand that felt like it reached your heart?”
“Sleep until lunch,” Draco insisted. “And if you need more sleep than that, just stay in bed. I’ll just have some biscuits. Oh, or I can order pizza. Harry taught me how to order things. Anyway, I will be fine until tonight, and you already made dinner for then. You can sleep.”
"True enough, that's power too. But Draco, are you feeling okay? You look a bit pale, maybe you should lay down for a bit? We can always talk more about this another time."
“You lucky bastard.” It was a good thing Draco read a lot. Calling each other bastard in a friendly way was something he knew about from books. He somehow never thought he would experience it himself, though, in the wild, as it were. Well, as long as no one implied his mother was a bitch. He took a little time to collect himself – it wouldn’t do to break into excited laughter.
“Oh, Linda at the Disk-overy? She’s great. Even has a bit of a punk selection. I don’t know how she keeps afloat in this shitty little town, but afloat she is. She does a bit of mail order on the side, to shitty towns that don’t have their own record store, or just have a bad one, so that probably helps.”
“I can’t say I know, exactly, but I suppose she was in a bit of a hurry. I know she mentioned needing to find something that was empty already and without lots of things that could get in the way of getting it immediately. That must have made the selection smaller. And I expect my mother had additional instructions about the place. I assume the lovely view is her influence.”
“Ugh, my Aunt Petunia loved that Jane Austen shit.” Harry’s face turned ugly for a moment. “The BBC-series, I mean, she probably wouldn’t have read the books. And I know the things she likes aren’t bad just for her liking them, but it just massively pisses me off. Sorry, not your problem.”
