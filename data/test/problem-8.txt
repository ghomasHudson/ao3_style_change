“It’s hard, though,” Harry said quietly, “To just move on.”
“It’s where you come to mope,” he explained, when it became evident that Harry wouldn’t say anything, “Which is a habit you should kick, I reckon. Stresses ‘Mione out.”
He wasn’t sure how she’d feel about having to see her ex-boyfriend loitering about the school during a year she undoubtedly imagined without him.
“So I reckon the only thing we can do is live,” Ron said, and then laughed, “Blimey, I sound like that bloke on mum’s radio show. It’s true though, innit? We can’t change what happened. We can just work with what we have now.”
The unnatural sense of wrongness clung to him like a stench he couldn’t shake off. At first, he thought it was just the oddness of the whole thing- returning to Hogwarts after everything that had happened there just a few months ago was certainly
He had lost track of how many times he had woken up with a scream in his throat, tears on his face, before he decided on giving up on sleep at all.
“What?” He demanded.
Harry shrugged. “Me too.”
“Wow,” breathed Neville, stopping at the first glossy wooden door to the right, which had his name, “
“Harry, did you know about this?” Ron demanded, shaking him out of his reverie. Ron was glaring at him as though Harry had personally invited Malfoy to return to Hogwarts.
“But,” she continued, and Ron exchanged a fond smile with Harry, “It is sentient, of course. All old, magical buildings are, especially one as enriched- with magic

Ron’s expression grew serious.
he really want to be an Auror, spending the rest of his days chasing down evil? Or was that just the only thing he knew how to do?
“‘In light of the unfortunate events of the past year’-” she began reading, (“That’s one way to put it,” snorted Ron), “All of last year’s seventh-year students are invited back to Hogwarts to retake their school year and sit their NEWT Examinations!’ Oh, this is brilliant!”
Everyone looked at her blankly, and she softened her expression by a fraction, allowing the barest hint of a smile to grace her features.
The worst part, Harry found himself thinking, was that everyone else seemed to have learnt how to move on, at least a little bit. It was true that there were incidents nearly everyday- sudden memories, floods of tears, panic attacks- among the students, especially those who had stayed back to fight, but for the most part, everyone was relearning, readjusting.
“Hermione’s got a point, you know,” added Ginny, “You could take some time off, Merlin knows you deserve it.”
The owner of said name strode down the passage at just that moment, and there was a brief moment where they just stared at each other, grey eyes meeting green.
He looked rather ghastly, to put it politely; thinner than ever, so pale that he wouldn’t have looked out of place standing among the latest lineup of “Europe’s Hottest Vampires” in Mrs. Weasley’s copy of Witch Weekly. He was, as always, impeccably groomed, hair slicked back, black robes perfectly tailored, even though they hung off his gaunt frame.
“Look like owls,” yawned Ginny, “Probably more fan mail for Harry.” She cast him a sly look, and Harry chucked a piece of grass at her.
“Are you really?” Hermione asked, perking up, “Oh Harry, you haven’t been flying in ages, it’ll do you so much good!”
Hermione gaped at him in outrage, as there was general, reluctant laughter.
Malfoy looked at him, startled. For a moment, Harry just stared at him, caught up in the way the flames reflected gold onto his pale hair, setting the edges of his frame on fire; the way his eyes glowed in the light. He looked strangely ethereal.

“I think it knows,” he told Hermione one evening, “That it was ruined in the battle because of me.”
Climbing up the grassy slopes to the castle, warm in the sunlight, with nothing but the chatter of his best friend and the occasional birdcall for company, Harry felt a little bit better. Maybe things would be alright, after all. Maybe all he needed was time.
I promise, Harry will (eventually) take his vacation as promised, okay! We gotta have that good buildup first.
“Not really, mate,” he continued, “And I don’t reckon you’d want to forget, anyway. Not after all of it. It had to have been worth something, yeah? And it’s bollocks, isn’t it? That we did all the right things, and we won, and it’s still awful.”
“Anyway,” continued Ginny, undeterred, “Harry, have you slept at all since you got here? You look worse than our ghoul.”

given him a home, no matter how much they hadn’t wanted to.
“I know,” Harry muttered, poking the bug gently. It fluttered and shifted from green to a pale blue.
“Harry,” said Ginny, coming to sit down with him at breakfast about two weeks after they’d arrived, “You look terrible.”
“Yeah, as long as we don’t murder each other by daybreak,” muttered Harry, although he knew that the very last thing he wanted was confrontation, “Come on, then. We’d better follow her.”
“You don’t have to go, you know,” Ginny said, gesturing at his letter, “It isn’t compulsory. You can even take your NEWTs at the beginning of the year after self-study, if you want to. It says it right there.”

There was a moment where both of them gazed at each other with disturbingly familiar soppy expressions, and Harry was quietly planning his exit from the scene before he saw anything he didn’t want to, when they were interrupted by an exclamation from Padma.
“I don’t think this is working anymore,” she had said gently, so very gently, and Harry had agreed, as much as it tore at the ache in his heart, and she kissed him one last time, and he let himself cry after she went back indoors. A quiet, clean break.

Eventually, everyone dispersed from the common room, shoving unceremoniously into a wide passage to the left.
That night, for once, he didn’t relive a nightmare from his past. He dreamt instead of magnificent white wings and blind eyes.
Not so, of course, because when had he ever had a few months (just a few!) of pure contentment and peace? Never, that’s when. The summer directly after the war passed by in a haze of heat and grief and endless funerals, reparations and press conferences and nightmares that left him screaming, heart pounding as though he had just been chased through a cold, dark forest by Death Eaters.
Ron hadn’t been nearly as furious as Harry had expected him to be. He had grown up, since the war; had become quieter, more introspective, and displayed flashes of intuition that surprised everyone, himself most of all.

“That’s because he was in France with his mother,” murmured Hermione from Ron’s other side, squeezing his arm gently, “I’m proud of you.”
“Oi,” said Ron, and Harry cringed internally, anticipating a fight before they had spent five minutes together. He mentally catalogued the possible hexes Ron might use, and wondered if disarming Voldemort had made him any extra good at Expelliarmus.
“I would also like every one of you know that you have all been invited back by me personally. Every student among you deserves to be back, to have a chance to finish your education.”
“He’s a bloody coward, Harry!”
Hermione had stopped talking by now, and was regarding him with a familiar expression of mixed concern and understanding.

Seamus whooped unnecessarily and enthusiastically.
Two days before his birthday, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were sprawled out under the shade of the beech in the garden, trying their best not to succumb to the heat that had taken over that summer.
“Harry,” she began, “She’s right, you know? Have you gone to see Pomfrey about the Dreamless Sleep?”
“You could do that with magic, you know,” Malfoy said, nodding at the kettle, “And I’m not surprised, by the way. That you’re getting that a lot. It’s because you look worse than my grandfather does, and he’s dead in a tomb.”
“Merlin, Potter,” he managed, after a short, awkward pause, “You look terrible.”
The lyrics at the beginning of the chapter were taken from Simon and Garfunkel's 'The Sound of Silence'.
“Oh, this was a wonderful idea,” Hermione sighed happily, watching the Hogwarts Express puff out steam contentedly, “One final year at Hogwarts without anyone trying to murder Harry will make for quite a pleasant change, I have to say.”
Harry spluttered in outrage for a moment, even though he knew this was perfectly true. However…
The days went by in a haze of classes that Harry barely attended, nights that he rarely spent in his room, taking instead to wandering the corridors, carefully avoiding the spots he knew would hurt. Fred’s corridor, the seventh floor, Dumbledore’s (now McGonagall’s, he reminded himself) office.
Hermione, of course, had far more to say about it- “Oh, Harry!”, being the first. And then she immediately proceeded to discuss their bedroom habits, which was distinctly worse, making Harry wish he had never told her at all.
Malfoy nodded carefully, like he understood this, somehow, and turned back to the fire.
“I know they aren’t,” Ron said softly, and Harry snapped his head up to look at him, “You’re basically a Weasley anyway. Dye your hair red and I’d reckon you’d fit right in.”
Hermione didn’t say anything, just let him rest his head on her shoulder, and she ran her fingers through his hair gently. They watched the sunset from the porch of The Burrow in silence, as the world glowed golden and orange and purple, before finally settling into gentle dusk.

“What?” Parvati and Padma called at the same time, and there was a mild stampede as everyone tried to find their rooms first.
“Seriously, Claude?” Draco huffed, glaring over his shoulder at the still sleeping couple who had responded to his movement by wrapping themselves tightly together. How Javier didn’t get woken up by his lovers constant moving Draco didn’t know. “I’m going back to sleep…”

Lucius had pointed out, however, that just because he hadn’t murdered anyone didn’t mean that he was innocent; Karkaroff had been a planner, apparently, and had been the one to organise several kidnappings and executions even if others were the ones to do the deed.

His shoes, of course, were black and every article of clothing which made up his uniform had the schools coat of arms embroidered on it somewhere or other; for their blazers it was located on the left breast pocket, for their shirts (or blouses in the girls case) it was in the same sort of location on the smooth fabric, for their trousers or skirts it was actually located on the belt buckle which came with them and on their robes it was also high on the left breast but hidden from view underneath the stylish cape which barely grazed their elbows.

One by one the Slytherin’s tapped their badges, shifting them to the second message even as their cruel laughter echoed off of the stone walls surrounding them. Harry growled, his hands clenching into fists at his sides as the rest of his fellow Gryffindor’s arrived and took in the scene. Most of them shifted angrily but a couple, Ron included, merely smirked at him.
A knock preceded his door opening by mere seconds just as he was tying his shoes laces, admitting his three best friends into the room. They too had changed into fresh uniforms and Ramona had secured her hair into an elegant twist rather than leave it in the two braids she had been sporting all day, braids which made her look years younger than she truly was.

Within seconds of him holding his finger to his lips the voice of their sworn enemy filtered through the crack in the door, the Slytherin’s having chosen the compartment next to theirs to take over by literally dragging the poor souls already sat inside it out by their collars.

Throughout their school lives pupils at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic slept not in crowded dormitories like most boarding schools but in reasonably large rooms with no more than three pupils per room. Each year the Head Boy and Head Girl were the only students given a private room of their own, complete with en suite bathroom, in their relevant house building. House Prefects, such as his friends, received no special treatment regarding their bedrooms although there was a Prefects bathroom in each of the three grand buildings.
“I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in mid-winter?”

“Hola,” the figure to his left greeted him equally as warmly. “
His immediate instinct was to get angry but Claude’s words were still lingering in the back of his mind and so, with a deep sigh, he forced his anger to recede and offered Fleur a smirk.
It was another mad dash at the other end of the short journey, the four of them sprinting up the stone steps in order to get inside the grand building which served as their school without getting too wet in the torrential downpour. Unfortunately a run in with the schools most mischievous poltergeist left Ron completely soaked from head to toe anyway, Peeves delighting in causing chaos as he dropped enormous water balloons down on top of them.

As was their habit the four friends were curled up together on his bed, Javier and Claude exchanging lazy kisses as they completed their required reading for their next Transfiguration class while Ramona lay with her legs tangled with Draco's as she worked on her Potions essay. “It's not as though it's very complicated; all you have to do is turn the parchment as you write so as to follow the circular shape. Even you could have managed such a feat, Claude…”

If he were being completely honest Draco had no idea what sort of a career he wanted to pursue following the culmination of his education. His skills on the Quidditch Pitch were such that, should he feel inclined to, he could almost certainly guarantee a successful career on a professional team. However it had also been suggested by his instructors that he should consider becoming a Potions Master/Instructor due to his
Did he really want to compete in the Triwizard Tournament?
The Triwizard Tournament was all anyone could talk about on the way back to their dormitories, packs of excited, frustrated, disappointed or just plain angry students hurrying along the corridors or up and down the changeable staircases. Unsurprisingly the twins were still determined to enter despite being underage and Ron was wholeheartedly encouraging them, his eyes glazed over with the thought of the prize money.

Draco felt the bottom drop out of his stomach as he, along with everyone else in the room, turned to stare at Professor Moody in shock following the sour faced man’s statement.

Neville’s reaction had been pushed to the back of his mind as the class had continued with a demonstration of the killing curse; the curse which had robbed him of his parents. It had only been afterwards, when Professor Moody had sought out the still affected Neville, that he had realised why his friend had been so upset; the

Well, apart from that time when some of them believed Harry was the heir of Slytherin but to be honest they could be excused for thinking that as the evidence against him had been pretty damning for a while. But unlike everyone else the Hufflepuff's had at least apologised to him for believing the rumours, even Justin Finch-Fletchly who had been on the receiving end of the infamous snake incident. And they had a

Unfortunately his redheaded friends exasperated question was answered by the trains whistle offering up three sharp blasts, prompting parents up and down the station to begin saying their final goodbyes and ensuring the students boarded safely. Mrs Weasley was no exception, immediately stepping forwards and chivvying them towards the train doors.
An excited rumble of students announcing to their friends that they were going to put their names in filled the air for a long moment, Fred and George sharing a blatant high-five where they sat further along the Gryffindor table. Even the Slytherin's, normally so cool and composed, had been caught up in the excitement and were whispering back and forth. At the Ravenclaw table it was obvious that students were trying to justify why they would make the best Hogwarts Champion, using logic and facts, whilst Hufflepuff was rapidly descending into a mess of giggles and nudging as they put each other's names forward.
A good third of the room’s occupants visibly swooned as a storm of applause and cheering swept through the Great Hall. They watched as Viktor Krum, his normally apathetic expression replaced with a confident smile, rose from his seat at the Slytherin table amidst his friends congratulations and made his way up towards Dumbledore. Nodding to all three of the Headteachers he followed the instruction the Hogwarts Headmaster had given, turning right and walking along the staff table before disappearing through the open door.

“Auror?” Dean Thomas, one of the few students in Harry's year and house who had been raised in an entirely muggle household like he had enquired, obviously as clueless about the title as Harry himself was. There was some debate about whether or not Dean’s father, who had died when he was young, had been a wizard but nothing had ever been confirmed. The boy in question was more than happy to consider himself a muggleborn like Hermione, supporting his favourite football team vigorously and regularly becoming completely obsessed with muggle television shows and movies when he went home for the holidays.

This, combined with the ever rising level of stress he was experiencing, left him even more distracted than usual, particularly during lessons which he found a challenge at the best of times. As time went on, however, he began to struggle in the lessons he usually did well in.
Glancing at himself in the mirror he mussed up his medium length platinum blond hair with his fingers, grateful that he had given up wearing it slicked back over the summer, getting it to hang artfully around his face before reaching into his wardrobe for the only part of his uniform he genuinely loathed; his beret. Draco was not now nor had he ever been a hat person and so being forced to wear the light blue “
Gabrielle DeLacour had been graced with the same delicate looks that Draco himself had inherited from his mother; milky white skin, big blue eyes in her case and waist length platinum blonde hair which was gathered into a long braid and draped over one shoulder.
Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into rather ugly tears, their caterwauling reminding Harry his Aunt Petunia when she pretended to be upset about something in order to convince her husband to see things her way, and were sobbing with their heads on their arms. One of the boys was shaking his head in such a way that it was obvious he had no idea he was performing such an obvious display of disapproval whilst another had slammed his clenched fist down onto the tabletop with enough for to make the poor Ravenclaw girl sitting to his left jump almost out of her seat. Finally there was one particular girl, sitting with the two crying their eyes out, who had the expression of someone who’d inadvertently swallowed a particularly sharp piece of lemon and couldn’t spit it out.

Professor Snape was a nightmare at the best of times but since his name had been drawn from the cup it had become even worse, as though the foul-tempered Potions Master had decided that his purpose in life was no longer to teach but to make Harry’s life miserable.

It wasn’t going to be a pleasant meeting.

A deep sigh escaped him, the parchment fluttering dangerously beneath his hand, before he decided that his only option was to explain things as simply and as quickly as he could.
Only Purebloods and Muggleborns who had actually bothered to read all of ‘
As far as Draco was aware Nina Rivera was one of the few girls Ramona was actually close with, their Spanish heritage uniting the girls even though they came from different opposite sides of the country; Javier and Ramona coming from Badajoz, a city located closed to the Portuguese border while Nina had spent her formative years in Madrid before moving to Barcelona when her parents had divorced. Ramona wasn't as close with Adelaide Michaud, the smartest girl in their year who had a habit of knocking Draco off the top spot, but she was friendly with the quiet girl as she had been Nina’s closest friend since their first year.
Dumbledore seemed to lose track of himself for a moment, behave like the forgetful old man he appeared to be and going on about an excellent joke he'd heard regarding a troll, a hag and a leprechaun walking into a bar.

Thankfully the muggle in question had taken her in and they’d been married in a small muggle ceremony a couple of months before they’d been blessed with a daughter.
Unbuttoning his blazer he hung it over the back of his chair rather than put it away in his wardrobe and pulled out his silk robes, slipping them on over the top of his shirt and trousers. The robes were fitted to his waist, secured by exactly twenty-eight minuscule buttons covered in the same light blue silk as the robes, where it then flared out to allow ease of movement. As with the girls robes they stopped just past his knees, leaving the bottom of his trousers and his smart black shoes clearly on display, but unlike the girls robes the cuffs of the sleeves weren't quite so tightly fitted. After fixing the layered collars of his robes so that the sharp points hung as they were intended to he smoothed out the mini-cape and carefully transferred his ‘
Claude grumbled softly, annoyed that he wouldn't be able to play matchmaker with his single friend…until he remembered that Ramona was as footloose and fancy free as Draco.
“Tomorrow night, on Halloween, the Goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools,” Dumbledore continued with his rather lengthy explanation. “The Goblet will be placed in the Entrance Hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to those wishing to compete. To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the Entrance Hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross the line.”
“…how many houses do they have at Durmstrang?”
“Vell perhaps it should!” Madame Maxime snapped at Bagman who had the good sense to back down from the Giantess. “Zere is the honour of our schools at stake! ‘
“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr Crouch and Mr Bagman and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge,” Dumbledore continued, smiling at the squib as the casket was placed on the raised platform beside where he was standing. A sheen of sweat glistened on the squibs forehead for a moment before it was wiped away with a rag. “Thank you, Mr Filch.”
“Maybe we'll even find you a boyfriend at Hogwarts, Draco,” Claude piped up after a moment, barely lifting his head from his own boyfriend’s chest. “You need to get over…”
“What are you doing?”
Stepping into the main entrance hall of the unfamiliar school Draco felt as though he’d been transported back in time and

“You should get some sleep, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up early for a photo call…”
, Harry?”
He was just coming down off his high when the bathroom door opened with a thud and Seamus stumbled in, rubbing at his eyes sleepily, as he made his way across the room to the urinal where he proceeded to empty his bladder without ever noticing Harry. Much to Harry's disgust his friend didn't wash his hands before stumbling back out of the bathroom.

He’d received a letter from his mother almost a week ago and had yet to reply.
A boy, aged somewhere between thirteen and fifteen, with piercing green eyes partially hidden behind a rather unattractive pair of wire rimmed spectacles. He was handsome, there was no denying that, although something needed to be done about his messy hair.
Of the twenty-seven students who had put their names up for consideration only sixteen had been selected by Madame Maxime to represent
Dieter had been just a fraction taller than Draco and had had a habit of crowding him in when they were together, be it in a bed or in a shower stall, so it wasn’t surprising that he quickly found himself wedged into the corner of the stall, the tiles surprisingly cool on his skin. As his hands moved, one working to bring himself to completion whilst the other stroked across the curve of his thigh, the plane of his stomach, his pectorals, all the places that Dieter had liked to touch and fondle when they’d been together, his mind effortlessly pictured his ex-boyfriend standing before him, his trademark smile on his handsome face.
He could be such a prat sometimes, Harry thought to himself angrily, as he glared at Fleur.

fitted but definitely weren't excessively loose around his long legs and a pair of black Italian leather shoes. As far as colours went each article of clothing he wore on a daily basis was a different shade of blue; light blue, sky blue, powder blue, pastel blue with the darkest part of the entire outfit being his tie and the piping around the various edges of his blazer which were both a royal blue.
“Actually, I can,” she countered primly, setting aside the spoon she had been using to eat her own breakfast of muggle coco-pops and retrieving a heavy tome from her school bag. “It just so happens that I was curious about Fleur’s relatives and decided to check out a book about ‘
“Why not?” Draco responded with a shrug. “It's just a name.”
“Perhaps another time…” he mumbled, offering the deputy headmistress an apologetic smile before focusing on the students gazing up at him once more. “Where was I? Ah, yes, the Triwizard Tournament…well, some of you might not know what this Tournament involves so I hope those of you who
“Is that a…” she gasped, obviously shocked. “Is that a
“Yeah, really amazing,” Harry sighed heavily. “What do they want photos for, Colin?”
“Narcissa, darling, what a pleasant surprise,” her mother murmured, placing her cocktail glass down on the coffee table before rising to her feet as swiftly as he restrictive corset would allow. She, like all the fashionable women of her generation, was still content to dress as though it was still the 1800’s. “What brings you home so unexpectedly?”
“Oh, if it couldn’t be me, at least it’s a
Dinner was a tense affair, everyone anxious about the ceremony that was too follow, and Draco wasn’t the only one left with little to no appetite. Javier hardly ate any of his main meal but polished off his desert in record time whilst Claude was the opposite, skipping the sweet treat entirely. Of their group only Ramona seemed in fine appetite, even going so far as to help herself to Draco’s leftover desert after he’d picked out the bits that he fancied.
Draco smirked to himself, holding back his chuckles so as to keep the attention away from him for the moment. Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad spending a year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his evil little cousins, so long as he had his friends with him.
she responded, smiling as innocently as she possibly could. None of them were fooled in the slightest; they’d seen that smile too often.
“No,” Fleur responded sharply, her voice carrying above the amused titters of the Hogwarts students gathering around them watching the scene taking place with undisguised interest. “Although, obviously, you can't be all that important or else you would know that I am…”
She’d returned home feeling broodier than she ever had in her life.

Ron stumbled into breakfast at the last second looking more asleep than awake and proceeded to inhale more food than he probably should in the few minutes he had before they needed to leave for their first lesson of the day which, after a quick check of their schedules, turned out to be
“Enter!”
He took his seat, helped himself to some food and tried to ignore the way everyone was staring at him, most of his fellow students not even bothering to be discreet about it, tried to ignore the way Ron turned his back on him where he was sat with Seamus and Dean, both of whom offered Harry an apologetic smile before carrying on their conversation.
A simple tap to the top of the badge caused the ink to shift colour, becoming a deep green on a sickly green background as a picture of Harry’s own face appeared above the words,
It would appear, Draco thought to himself as he obediently followed Madame Maxime out of the room, that his friend would be out of luck if she was at all serious about the interest she had expressed regarding Viktor Krum as his eyes had already been drawn elsewhere.
Harry had never felt more betrayed in his entire life than he did in that moment, and given his less-than-stellar upbringing that was saying something. His so-called best friend was siding with the rumour mill over him, the boy he’d known since they’d met on the train?
It had been frightening the first time he'd orgasmed, a word he had only learned during the “talk” much to his embarrassment, but by the second and third time he could understand why people always seemed to make such a big deal about it. It felt amazing, like flying…
“…are you trying to tell us you're gay, mate?”
“I just thought that a good sharp shock –”
There was just something rather endearing about her that screamed muggle upbringing.
Harry noticed that no one had, as of yet, asked him if he actually wanted to compete.
“It is Uranus, my dear.”
Desiree had obviously spent more time on her hair, pinned in an artful bun high up on the back of her head than on her dress, the lacing not quite as tight or as perfect as Odette’s.
“Draco,” Madame Maxime called out, drawing his attention away from the excited official. “It is time for us to return to the carriage. Your classmates will wish to congratulate you.”
Even as he smiled down at the now bouncing boy he couldn't help but share a slightly terrified look with Hermione. Colin he could handle, in small doses, but
“Is that a threat?” Moody roared, shaking Fleur like she was a rag doll. “Is that a threat?”

This pretty much set the tone for the next few days.
…” Ramona cursed under her breath. “Then how can you properly prepare for what will undoubtedly be a dangerous task without giving you anything to begin with?”
In the end the meal which had been so long in coming passed by far too quickly with only one incident happening to disrupt them in their endeavour to fill their stomachs, that being when Nearly Headless Nick had brought up the fact that Hogwarts was home to the largest number of House Elves dwelling in Britain. Hermione had been utterly horrified, refusing to touch another bit of the delicious meal in a show of disgust for the careless treatment of the House Elves rights. She wouldn't listen to Ron or their house ghost when both of them tried to reassure her that most House Elves were more than happy with the way they lived, that the House Elves at Hogwarts were some of the best rested in Britain if not the world.
“Can I have a look at Uranus, too, Lavender?”
Harry nodded stilted lay in response to Ron's soft question.
“I'm not sharing with Fabian,” Javier reassured his boyfriend with a fond roll of his eyes, pausing to throw a handful of sweets into his mouth, grimacing at the taste the mixture of unusual flavours had created. “I'm sharing with Jan, Jan Boerefijn not Jan Mattheson.”
Shortly thereafter the clapping and chatting died down, everyone’s attention returning to Goblet of Fire as its flames once again turned red. Draco felt his breath seize in his chest as a slightly charred circular piece of blue parchment was thrown up into the air by the flames.
“Um…I suppose so?” Draco responded. “Not really my type though…”
Draco watched, as fascinated as the rest of them, as Dumbledore drew his wand from within his robes, twirling it around his fingers for a long moment before tapping three times of the top of the casket. Nothing happened for a long moment and then the wood and metal just seemed to melt away, dissolving into thin air to reveal the item hidden inside.
“There's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all of the magic schools,” Hermione answered, her voice much gentler now that she was addressing Harry. “Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts to that no one can steal their secrets.”

Around them students began to shift, hurriedly finishing off their meals before the bell rung out ordering them back to their lessons, and Harry didn’t want to risk being late to Potions.
“Ramona…”
Blowing on the ink to dry it he carefully folded the sheet in half and then in half again so that it would fit into one of the envelopes he’s brought with him. Sealing it shut with a droplet of wax, pressing his signet ring into it as his father had taught him to, he quickly scribbled his home address on the front of the envelope and moved across to the cage hanging from a delicate chain in the corner of his room. Auctus, his owl, hopped obediently onto his left arm when he opened the cage, taking the letter carefully with his sharp beak.

“Bravo, Viktor!” Professor Karkaroff boomed unpleasantly. “Knew you had it in you!”
“Seriously?” she grumbled, reaching out to flick the back of his neck. He flinched away from her, his hand shooting across to jab a finger into her side in retaliation which caused her to let out a sharp yelp. Ramona was very ticklish. “

swung open once more, this time admitting the unmistakable figure of Viktor Krum. He was followed closely by his own Headmaster, the notoriously Dark Wizard Igor Karkaroff, and one of his fellow Durmstrang students, a serious young man called Ivan Poliakoff who had the unfortunate “claim to fame” of being Karkaroff’s favourite nephew. This had, sadly, resulted in him being sent to live with the Dark Wizard after the sudden death of his mother when he was only a young child. His father had died
Javier slipped away from the other three so as to open the ornate carriage door for their Headmistress, smiling up at the giantess as she nodded her thanks before entering. He then proceeded to hold the door open for his sister, his lover and his best friend before following them inside and closing it firmly behind him. When he turned around to face the room he found all his fellow

students so easily, the other being his platinum blonde hair, of course, as the older strident had opted to have what appeared to be marmalade on toast for breakfast as opposite did to the pastries and churros his friends had chosen. As Harry watched a large drop of marmalade dropped onto Draco’s chin as he took a bite, prompting him to chuckle as he hurriedly brought his napkin up to catch the droplet before it could touch his uniform.
Offering the younger student a parting nod Cedric turned and disappeared through a door to the right of the grand marble staircase, rapidly descending down the stone steps which had been concealed behind it and before the door could swing shut completely Harry heard him let out a joyful whoop, announcing his presence to his housemates who began to cheer.
The silence continued as Harry walked along the teachers table, none of them saying a word to him, not even Hagrid who was usually so friendly with him, and he disappeared through the door. He found himself not in an antechamber a he’d expected but at the top of a thin winding staircase and so, as the others must have done, he followed it down until he finally reached the bottom and stepped out into what appeared to be the trophy room; there were trophies on every available surface leaving only a couple of spots on the walls available for a few portraits of wizards and witches who looked to be former Headteachers of the school.
“Hey!” Javier protested as he pulled away from his boyfriend, pushing himself up onto his elbow so that he could glare good-naturedly at his friend. “We didn't agree to any
“It is possible,” Dumbledore conceded, his eyes never leaving Harry’s. “Of course.”
Harry wasn't the only one to twist around in his seat, getting himself into a more comfortable position as he prepared to listen to what would undoubtedly be an unfortunately long winded explanation of the tournament. Long winded but necessary.
Ramona frowned,
“You see this?”
It wasn’t a deliberate move, he quickly figured out even in his sleep-befuddled state, just a case of Claude moving in his sleep as he was known to do. Thankfully his elbow had missed Draco’s nose, striking his cheekbone instead, and the creams he used in his morning routine would soothe the worst of the bruising before it could even begin to appear on his pale skin.
Madame Maxime scoffed loudly,
“I fell in the lake!”
That was what his parents had told him growing up when they would share stories of their past so that he could understand the decisions they had made and learn from their mistakes. Several students spluttered, trying to come up with an answer, but no one spoke.
Professor Binns continued, the historical inflections and spelling making it even more challenging for the students to focus on what was being said. His monotonous voice was a sedative at the best of times.
Harry, already struggling to stay awake, couldn't help but agree with his friend.
All three of them looked across at him expectantly then.
Ron and Hermione had been forced into a similar position as Harry and Ginny and seemed equally as embarrassed about it, springing apart and eagerly hurrying along the corridor. Poor Ginny was left standing alone for a long moment as Harry hurried after his friends before the infatuated third year let out a deep sigh and set off to find her own friends.
“Oh, look, everyone; it’s the
“Congratulations, Draco,” Lara murmured, following Jan’s example and crossing to give the platinum blond a tight hug whilst pressing a light kiss to his cheek. “You shall be wonderful.”
“Convenient?” Karkaroff repeated. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
“Well…” Dumbledore sighed as Harry came to stand directly in front of the headmaster, his face devoid of his usual smile. In fact, Harry thought he looked pained. “Through the door.”
They’d agonised about where to go for their new start and had eventually decided to purchase a comfortable house in the magical village of

None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.) As the story progresses this will happen less and less but in this first chapter, particularly in the very first section where the “scene is being set”, I struggled not to include some aspects. Just wanted to warn you.
“Yes,” Hermione answered, flicking through the pages of her book far too quickly to actually be reading them. She was probably looking for her place, he realised, remembering the fact that she didn't like to use bookmarks in case they damaged the pages and that she considered dog-earring pages to be a crime. “And it's got a horrible reputation.

“What do you know about the Malfoy family? Are they really related to the DeLacour’s?”
“I feel sick…” Claude murmured, clearly distressed. “Ugh. Can’t they hurry this up?”
Ron clenched his fists at his sides, glaring across at Fleur as she showed off the picture.
Harry couldn’t help but let out a dejected sigh.
Thierry’s voice came from immediately behind him and Draco had no sooner stepped to the side when the other boy hurried past, his expression pained as he dove into a cubicle.
“I couldn’t have faced them knowing that Draco was unprotected,” she admitted softly, thinking of how her older sister had always been a fraction

Getting to his feet was difficult, his body feeling equally as numb as his brain, and his foot caught the hem of his robes which caused him to stumble as he set off along the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. His fellow students gazed up at him, slack jawed, as he passed them by although as more time passed by some of them recovered their senses enough to adopt looks of pure envy and in some cases disgust and annoyance.

Odette and Desiree sprung into action, making their way along the centre aisle between long student’s tables in a series of elegant twirls and flourishes. A murmur of surprise spread through the gathered students, most of them obviously over-awed by the display.

As soon as he’d opened the simple window his eagle owl was gone, the back draft caused by his powerful wings ruffling Draco’s hair even more than the breeze from outside had done.

Sleep evaded him more often than not as the week dragged by, far too many hours spent gazing up at the canopy over his bed rather than getting the rest he so desperately needed.
It was relatively easy to avoid everyone for the rest of the day, it being a Sunday so only a few voluntary clubs were running, none of which he belonged to, but come the following morning he could no longer avoid the hordes of people who wanted nothing more than to stare at him. Those who believed that he’d been entered against his will, such as Hermione, were clearly in the minority as almost everyone stopped him to ask him how he’d done it.
It was such a Hermione thing to say that Harry couldn't hold back his own peel of laughter.
Just at that moment Draco came thudding back down the stairs, sprinting into the room with his favourite stuffed animal clutched in his arms. Due to his name most of Draco’s toys were dragons but none of these had ranked as his all-time favourite. No, the toy that was dragged around by him almost constantly was a fluffy light brown rabbit with long ears.
No, not in the slightest.
Offering their friend’s one final wave the family apparated to the international apparation point, Severus apparating back to Hogsmeade village at the same moment. It was understandably busy at the international apparation point with people arriving and departing for both business and pleasure, sometimes families like the Malfoys, sometimes individual men and women dressed in their smartest robes. They checked in at the registration desk, Lucius handing over the parchment granting them their departure slot, and then made their way to the queue for the
He unfolded it slowly and held it out in front of him, staring at the name written upon it.
“Bloody hell…” Ron breathed out deeply in shock as the ceiling calmed down above them, the caster of the powerful spell slowly limping his way across to Professor Dumbledore. He was unlike anyone Harry had ever seen before; every inch of exposed skin seemed to be covered with a horrific patchwork of scars and one of his eyes seemed to be artificial, held into the socket by an old collection of leather straps and buckles. “It's Made-Eye Moody.”
“…huh…” he muttered as he finally turned off the water, stepping out to grab his towel. Patting himself dry quickly he secured the rectangle of cloth around his waist, collected his shower things and headed back to his private bedroom. “…well that was…unexpected…”
Did they honestly think that he wanted this? He was
“Yeah,” Harry murmured, reminded of his manners by his muggleborn friend as he held Ginny steady in front of him as the girl wobbled. “Thanks for everything, Mrs Weasley.”
“Careful, Claude,” Draco snorted softly. “Your teenage jealousy is showing again…”
“Please, sir,” Colin gasped out. “He’s got to take his things with him. All the champions…”
“He might've mentioned it…”
Harry and Hermione didn’t need to be told twice, grabbing Ron and dragging him inside.
“M-Mummy, what happened to you?”
Whether or not they believed him seemed to have no bearing on how each of the four houses treated him, however; his fellow Gryffindor’s were overjoyed to have their own champion, particularly one with his unusual reputation, and kept on congratulating him.

Narcissa agreed readily, thanking the healer before Lucius escorted her out.

Harry thought that, more than anything, Professor McGonagall sounded scandalised.
“It’s ok, you know? You can tell me the truth. If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie. It’s not like you got into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, Violet, she’s already told us all that they’re letting you enter.”
As he watched a picture of Cedric Diggory’s handsome face appeared in the centre of the badges only to disappear in a swirl of deep red ink which then proceeded to form the words,
“Only my friend Hermione,” Harry answered, pulling the crusts off of his cheese and ham sandwich before taking a bite out of the softer centre. “But she had to go to the library.”
“So she thinks Durmstrang would have suited her, does she?” she huffed angrily as she returned to her seat, producing a worryingly thick book seemingly from nowhere and opening it on her lap. “I wish she

Reaching out he encouraged Claude to snuggle into his side, wrapping his arm around the Frenchman so as to effectively pin him in place. Claude sighed happily, rubbing his cheek against the soft fabric of his boyfriend’s pyjama top whilst tucking his leg between Javier’s.
“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well that you did not make a mistake!” McGonagall snapped, her hands coming to rest gently on Harry’s trembling shoulders. It was comforting, to know that she would stand by him always. “Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!”
“Careful, Desiree, or you face stick that way.”

“May I introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,” Dumbledore announced as the man in question limped over to the empty seat left for him. “Professor Moody.”

“No more hitting people in your sleep,” Javier ordered, his lips brushing against Claude’s forehead. “We don’t want our Champion going to breakfast with a black eye now do we?”
He had been captivated by the Ravenclaw Seeker, the only girl on their team, since the first match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw the year before. Just seeing her pretty face and stunning smile made his stomach feel funny, like there was a giant butterfly trapped inside it. The thought of seeing her again had been one of the things get him through his time with the Dursley's before he had been spirited away to attend the World Cup with the Weasley's.

“Alastair Moody?” Hermione gasped, her eyes going wide. “The Auror?”
“Look, it’s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is,” Hermione had explained her reasoning earlier when Harry had expressed his disbelief regarding her assessment of Ron’s behaviour. “I know it’s not your fault. I know you don’t ask for it but, well, you know.”
“Miss Narcissa,” the creature murmured whilst performing a deep bow. The dirty pillow case it wore slipped to reveal the creatures grotesquely scarred back. It had always amused her sisters, Bellatrix and Apolline, to torment the poor creatures whenever they could or to order them to punish themselves for no real reason. “May Narbey be of assistance?”

Draco snorted unattractively.
“It most certainly is not!” the unfamiliar witch gasped sharply. “I saw it with my own eyes!”
Draco found himself studying the faces of the many students in that particular table, searching out two in particular, as his mind supplied him with the information his parents had given about their former house; founded by the somewhat infamous wizard Salazar Slytherin the house tended to be composed mostly of Pureblood students, due to its founder's mistrust of Muggleborns, and as such the house was traditionally home to students who exhibit such traits as cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. It was said that most

His words, both his agreement to put his name down and his statement about the “unwelcome touching” quickly reduced the four of them to a mess of giggles, chuckles and outright laughter as they rearranged themselves into a slightly more relaxed snuggle fest.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the European schools of wizardry – Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the Tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent was of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities – until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the Tournament was discontinued.”

“Moody, old man,” Bagman stuttered, his expression green. “What a thing to say!”

you wouldn’t go about it like that, Harry!” Hermione said in exasperation, “It’s just that she said it’s like you weren’t even interested- for god’s sake, Harry, you wouldn’t even share a bed with her at night!”
“You going, then?” Harry asked Ron, who shrugged vaguely.
“Well, she
“This is the eighth years’ table,” Harry reminded her, choosing to ignore the second part, “And don’t you have Quidditch practice right now?”
“I don’t know either,” she said, reaching out to pet Harry’s hair, “I’m sorry, Harry.”
“Like what?” Ron asked with uncharacteristic gentleness.
“Bit of an understatement, don’t you think?” Seamus whispered loudly, nudging Dean in the ribs. McGonagall glared at him and he quailed very rapidly.
” She was in a corner, running her hands along rows and rows of beautiful, gilt-edged books placed in shelves inlaid in the walls.
As Harry drank his tea (could have done with a dash of lemon), gazing into the fire, he felt the last vestiges of the horror that had gripped him not ten minutes ago fade. The grief he couldn’t shake, but he’d carried that around a long, long time. Shadowy brown and orange, it was almost a friend.
“There’s only so much you can take before you get addicted to it,” she had told him, a horribly sympathetic look in her eye, “Have you considered a Mind Healer, Mr. Potter?”
“Don’t know if you’ve noticed, Potter,” he said with a sneer, “But I’ve been practising that for a long time now.”
at him, the moment passing as fast as it came.
“That’s dragon
“I went to see her,” he said sullenly, prodding at his toast without looking Hermione in the eye.
Harry turned instinctively to McGonagall, and caught her suppressing a self-satisfied smile. She caught his eye and before he could so much as open his mouth, she
Harry hadn’t seen him since the Malfoys’ trial towards the end of May, where he had spoken up for both Draco and his mother, carefully leaving Lucius out of his testimony. The man deserved to rot in Azkaban for life, which was exactly the sentence he received.
“You think?” Harry asked, with an eyebrow raised, and then pulled himself off the ground before any more discussion could take place, “Alright, come on then. What’ve we got now, Charms?”
“Is it like this for you, too?” Harry blurted out, suddenly desperate to find some indication that he wasn’t the only one, that he wasn’t losing his mind entirely.
“Maybe, but he doesn’t deserve Azkaban!”
Ron!” Hermione snapped, “And yes, it is.”
Harry didn’t think he imagined the way she looked between the remaining Slytherins- Malfoy, Goyle, Zabini, Parkinson and Nott- and the shamefaced but defiant Gryffindors- himself, Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus and Parvati.
“I prefer to do it by hand,” Harry said quietly, because for some reason, one that he didn’t want to examine too closely, he didn’t want to stop talking to Malfoy just yet.
She continued chattering on delightedly, but Harry barely heard her, staring at the letter in his hands. Going back to Hogwarts had never once occurred to him; not even a week after the final battle, Kingsley had offered he, Ron, and Hermione a guaranteed spot among the Aurors, the Dark wizard hunters of the Ministry, no NEWT qualifications required.
“I think it’s a good idea,” she said, but even she sounded a bit dubious.
“They’re not mine,” Harry said automatically, trying to ignore the cold feeling that settled in him at Ron’s words. It was strange, he had never paid too much attention to how the Dursleys treated him after he joined Hogwarts, although he did know, in theory, that it was awful. But now, after all of it, now that he had time to think…
Malfoy got up suddenly, flashing what was clearly meant to be a condescending look at Harry.
It was Malfoy, because of course it was. Fate apparently had it written down in a little notebook that Malfoy simply had to be present to witness every horrible, vulnerable moment in Harry’s life, otherwise it simply wouldn’t be complete.
And now, Hogwarts. The very thought of returning to that place, that haven turned battlefield, containing some of his very best and worst memories, sent a shudder of some unnameable feeling through him.
“That was a weak one,” Harry told him, and Malfoy grimaced in concession, “And no, I don’t make it a habit of attending fan club meetings, especially ones at half-two. Couldn’t sleep.”
had once lain, as though nothing had changed, was incomprehensible.
“We are- were on the ground floor!” He said incredulously, gesturing outside, “How is the view like
“And her hair was singed, I remember,” Hermione sighed, looking appropriately contrite, “I’m sorry, Harry. Do you really think you wouldn’t have worked out?”
The summer of 1998 was, by far, the worst summer of Harry’s life; and this was saying something, considering that he had lived through entire summers in a cupboard. Harry himself thought that this was distinctly unfair- he had finally defeated Voldemort, peace had been restored to the (wizarding) world, the apple orchard by The Burrow was flourishing like it never had before- all in all, quite an idyllic situation.
The castle no longer held the wonder and joy it had for him even in his worst years, even after Cedric and Sirius and all of it. The final battle had changed that, apparently irrevocably.
Harry, having had many years of practice listening to the bickering of his two best friends, tuned them out successfully, and stared at Malfoy, who was, in fact, standing on the platform a little way off.
“We just weren’t- wait, Ginny told you
“I expect friendship, but if that’s too much to ask, then, at the very least, civility,” McGonagall continued, “And in the spirit of inter-house cooperation-” here, she paused, with a- there was no other word for it- mischievous glint in her eye, “I have decided that all of you will not be boarding with your respective Houses, but will instead have your own dormitory. In fact, as of today, you will not belong to any house at all. You are all Eighth Years, and nothing else.”
“I was raised by Muggles, you know,” he said, and poured himself a cup, “Fancy one?”
“Like- like everything’s wrong, all the time,” Harry kicked at the water in frustration, sending a rainbow arc of droplets into the air, unable to articulate just how he felt, and yet no longer able to hold it all in, “Everywhere I go, Ron, it’s always- I always
He wasn’t the only one, though. A quick glance around at his fellow students told him that not everyone was thrilled to return to the castle-turned-battlefield where so many of their own had lost their lives. Hermione was gripping Ron’s hand so tightly that it looked like it had lost all circulation. With a feeling of cold misery, Harry caught sight of little Dennis Creevey- not so little anymore- at the far end of the Gryffindor table, looking lost and a little bewildered, as though he wasn’t quite sure what he was doing there without his brother.
“I understand that there have been differences between you,” she said sternly, and Ron snorted.
Harry’s speaking at the trial had been the cause of an enormous, blazing row between him and Ron, resulting in several terribly awkward days at The Burrow. Hermione had taken Harry’s side and Ginny had taken Ron’s, and several screaming matches later, they had reached an unspoken agreement to never mention it again, although it was clear that Ron couldn’t understand it.
“Do you know what helps? With the dreams?” Harry asked, and Malfoy shook his head. “Not sleeping,” Harry said with a grin, and was rewarded with a slow, involuntary curve of Malfoy’s lips, before the other boy seemed to come to himself, replacing it with a hasty scowl instead.
Hello! I loved writing this chapter, even if nothing particularly plotty happens in it.
“It’s not as though the both of you- um, you know, spent a lot of-”, she took a moment here to blush heavily, and Harry, with a feeling of impending doom, realised what she was trying to say,
“Ginny
Malfoy didn’t say anything, and Harry found himself walking towards him, settling himself on the opposite armchair. There was a strangely comfortable silence for a few moments, unbroken save for the crackling of the fire. Or at least, it was silent until Malfoy opened his
mouth again.
“Of course you don’t have to,” she said, and took a deep breath. Harry braced himself for the “But…” that was coming.
“Tell you what, Granger,” said someone, and Harry turned to see Zabini lounging about on a sofa as though he had lived there his whole life, “How about you leave the difficult questions to the Ravenclaws, and return to dragon taming, or whatever it is you Gryffindors do in your free time.”
The dragon, Harry realised, as he took a sharp dive and then pulled out. The dragon they had set free from Gringotts and escaped on. That had been his last flight in the open, fresh air. If he shut his eyes, he could almost see the hills and fells below, Ron and Hermione on either side of him, the wings beating steadily.
But Malfoy was already gone, sweeping out of the door and down the passage, leaving Harry staring after him, wondering if any of it had been quite real.
“Malfoy looks right shit, doesn’t he?” Ginny murmured conversationally.
Harry, Ron, and Ginny exchanged exasperated glances laced with fond amusement.
“Spell damage,” Hermione said softly, following Harry’s gaze to the far wall, the one behind the teachers’ table, “Some of it can’t be fully healed, I read about it in ‘
The castle was oppressive in a way it had never been before. The corridors seemed narrower, the stone cold and unforgiving.
Harry opened his eyes, too exhausted to even jump at the sudden voice. Ron sat next him, stretching his long legs, casting his bag to the side carelessly.
“Malfoy,” Harry said at last, nodding at him, trying to remember if Malfoy’s eyes had always been that intense.
“What, a Muggle?” Asked Malfoy, seemingly unable to help himself, and then promptly looked like he regretted it. To Harry’s horror, he found himself laughing at something Malfoy said for the
, her expression clearly said, and Harry grinned back.
Harry walked all the way down the passage without finding his name, wondering if McGonagall expected him to sleep in the common room as some sort of bizarre display of inter-house cooperation.
Harry felt a strange pang for the creature, wondering where it went, whether it was still alive. Something old and fierce, something reminding him of birthdays and beautiful snow-white owls unfurled in him, making him hope desperately that it
“First of all,” she said, “I would like to make it clear that
about it opened up a strange pit in his chest, an unnameable something rising in him, and Harry shook his head to clear the thought.
“Looks a bit like a corpse, if I’m being honest,” Seamus interjected, seating himself beside Ginny, “You know, or a zombie, those Muggle things.”
“The tea. I like to do it myself.”
, to you!” Ron finished, and Harry turned to him, hardly believing his ears. Zabini stared for a moment before grinning broadly, lighting up his handsome features.
Harry, for his part, felt little more than pity for the boy, whatever his old feelings towards him may have been. The war had changed a lot; it seemed so utterly futile to carry out old schoolboy grudges.
I was saying,” she continued, “I understand that you have had your differences. Regardless of what they may be, I will
Ron!”
“Talking to yourself, Potter?”
Hermione had politely declined it at once, earnestly telling Kingsley of her plans to study Magical Law, hoping to introduce some much-needed reforms in the Ministry, especially with regard to the treatment of so-called ‘lesser creatures’. Harry, thinking of Dobby and Remus, supported this in entirety. He knew she’d be brilliant at it, as she was at everything she set her mind to.
Ron grinned sheepishly, “Hermione’s rubbing off on me, I think,” he said, but looked pleased about it all the same.
“Nothing,” he mumbled, and got up abruptly from the table, “Nothing, you have a good breakfast.”
“Then we won’t talk about it any longer,” Hermione said, much to his relief, and linked her arm with his, “Besides that, how have things been?”
The returning Eighth Years were given their own separate dormitory and a long lecture from McGonagall.
“Saviour Potter, too good to make tea by magic?” He said, but like before, there was no malice in it, so Harry simply shrugged.

Harry turned from the kettle, laughing despite himself.
“Anyway,” Ron continued with dogged determination that Harry was really quite in awe of, “The point is, I know you hate it here right now. I reckon you’d hate it
Flying
“Wonderful,” she said briskly, “And now for the Sorting!”
A dull sense of resignation settled over him as he gazed over the brilliant, sparkling surface. Time went on and on, but he, Harry, would be trapped in his worst moments forever. No escape in sleep, none in wakefulness either, it seemed. It would have been easy, so easy to have stayed in the hazy white limbo of King’s Cross.
“Thanks, Gin,” snorted Harry, neglecting to mention that she was right.
That was a thought for another day, he told himself resolutely, and besides, it wasn’t as though they were the worst thing that had happened to him. Far from it. And they
“I dream too,” Malfoy offered hesitantly, and Harry felt something disturbingly close to warmth spread through him at the admission.
“But, Harry, do you
Before she could reply with an inevitably reprimanding-but-gentle tone, there was a slight disturbance in the shape of Malfoy slumping into the seat at the end of the table. He looked, if possible, worse than Harry did.

“Yes,” Malfoy said slowly, and then deliberately looked back into the flames, a clear sign that the conversation was over.
The Eighth Years’ dormitory was

“I dunno, I’ve noticed something too. It isn’t quite- home anymore.”
“She’s barking,” said Ron incredulously, and Hermione jabbed him sharply.

Long after he returned to Hogwarts, relishing the cold that had seeped into his very being, the dragon stayed in the background of his thoughts.
Harry had considered it on exactly one occasion, and then immediately disregarded it as well. He did not mention this to Madam Pomfrey.
“The one who died of Dragonpox?” He asked, and then immediately wished he could die on the spot, when Malfoy looked slightly alarmed. Harry didn’t blame him. He, too, was alarmed that he remembered this.
Harry flushed, embarrassed at being caught, and he felt sure Malfoy knew it.
“He tried to kill Dumbledore, Harry!” Ron had reminded him furiously, as though Harry had forgotten the scene at the Astronomy Tower.
?” Ron demanded loudly, lugging his trunk behind him, joining Harry, Hermione on the platform. Ginny had left them as soon as they arrived, rushing off to link arms with Luna, who was looking particularly bizarre in what appeared to be a purple cowboy’s hat.
“Take your time,” Ron advised, earning himself a smack to the arm, “Oi!”
say that- oh, Harry, she said that you never seemed to want to have sex with her, alright?”
In the haze of the afternoon sunshine, everything seemed like it would be alright, really.
“I don’t know,” he said honestly, “I hadn’t really thought about my future, to be honest. I was a bit occupied with the whole- you know.” He waved his hand about vaguely in an attempt to represent Voldemort and prophecies and battles and trying not to die, all in one gesture.
The September days at Hogwarts were as honey golden as Harry remembered them to be, light dripping off every wall, torchlights flickering, warm and familiar, at nights. Meals were delicious, reminding him of his starved, eleven year old self, knowing the comforts of good, plenty food for the first time in his life. By all accounts, he should have been happy- he was at
“Eighth year,” said Hermione excitedly, brandishing her letter about. Harry, who had only just opened his, stared at her.
“Magic,” she said superbly, before spinning on her heel and striding out of the room.
She rolled her eyes.
“Thought I’d find you here.”
As Harry trailed down the corridor, each sconce along the walls lighting up obligingly for him, he felt his breathing slow, his heartbeat gradually return to normal. The fear and blind panic was being replaced by anger and frustration and horrible, aching grief.
Harry woke up with a strangled gasp, wand in hand. His room lit up automatically, bathed in soft golden light, but Harry barely noticed. He could hardly breathe for the tears that were coming, that would not stop coming.
“Thanks,” muttered Harry, putting the kettle on, “Been hearing that a lot lately, funnily enough.”
“Well, unless he’s planning on joining the staff as its newest member, we can safely assume he’s coming back for his eighth year, don’t you think?”
, was the first thought that came to Harry’s mind, as he entered the enormous common room with everyone else. To start with, it wasn’t overwhelmingly one colour- the way the Gryffindor room had been red and warm, or how the Slytherin room, Harry recalled wryly, had been green and stiff.
“I don’t think you can forget,” he said quietly. Harry turned to look at him, finding Ron twisting the grass under his fingers.
Harry looked at the harsh scorch marks adorning the wall, faded, perhaps, but visible, nonetheless. He swallowed, turning away.
She cleared her throat loudly and all the remaining students whipped around to look at her.
Harry shuddered, remembering a charmed portrait of him that a particularly enthusiastic wizard had sent him, which yelled “VICTORY TO WIZARDKIND” and “DOWN WITH EVIL” at regular intervals. An ordinary silencing spell didn’t work on it, so they eventually had to drown it, although Ron claimed he could still hear it, some nights.
“Nope,” said Ginny, popping the ‘p’, pulling a plate of bacon towards her, “Ravenclaw’s got it all booked for today. Fought with Hooch about it and everything, but she didn’t budge, old bint.”
Harry lost interest in the sorting rapidly; the enormous hall looked as though a war had never taken place, as though the bodies of the dead hadn’t lain there mere months ago, but if he looked more carefully, there were signs.
A few conversations. A memory.
He pushed his broom further and further, soaring far above the grounds and the forest until all of it became a hazy blur of colours. He tried to remember the last time he was on a broom, and then immediately cut off that train of thought when he realised it was in the Room of Requirement, fire licking around his ankles, Malfoy clinging to him so tightly that it hurt.
Everyone except Harry, that was.
Malfoy looked up at him and opened his mouth, presumably to make a half-heartedly nasty retort, but he snapped it shut at once.
“It’s been…” Harry tried to think of the appropriate words for the past two and a half months, but came up short, “It’s been a lot,” he said finally, thinking of all the speeches he had given, all the funerals he had attended because he couldn’t help but feel responsible, all the blurred faces of grieving family, and the reporters who wouldn’t leave him alone, and the ghosts that haunted his dreams and waking hours too.
“What would?” Hermione asked.
“Yeah, I reckon that’s the bit that’s hardest for me to get over too,” he retorted, earning a sharp stab of the elbow from Ron, “
be nice to have some time to relax, if you get my drift.”
Harry had, in fact, gone to ask, or more accurately, beg, for Dreamless Sleep, but Madam Pomfrey had kindly but firmly told him that she simply couldn’t hand it out.
“Figured we all ought to grow up a bit,” he muttered, “And ‘sides, I don’t remember Zabini being a Death Eater.”
It was a soft, lavender evening when Ginny broke up with him. He had seen it coming for weeks, of course. They didn’t quite know how to talk to each other anymore; when Ginny wanted to talk about what happened in the past year, Harry wanted to turn tail and run and run and run until her and her fiery hair were nothing but a speck in the distance. When Harry wanted to talk about
“Who said anything about moving on?” Ron said incredulously, “Mate, I don’t think anyone’s going to be moving on for a long time. I know
Harry laughed, not telling him how touched he really was by that statement.
He looked at his letter, not really reading the words of it, all sorts of conflicting emotions swirling around within him, all fighting for the surface. The raw terror at the idea was overwhelming- to return to the site of the final battle, to enter the Great Hall where the bodies of so many people he loved had once lain, where

What happened next was something that would live on in infamy within the halls of Hogwarts for countless years to come; a loud bang, followed by the panicked screams of several people as something painfully hot grazed along the side of his face. Fumbling for his wand, tucked securely in his robes, he had only just managed to get hold of it when a second loud bang was heard by all and a booming voice penetrated the shocked screams,
“Potter?” Cedric frowned when he realised who had joined them, stepping slightly away from the fireplace as he turned to face the younger boy. Krum’s frown was even more prominent as he too turned to face the newest arrival. Draco, on the other hand, kept his face almost completely expressionless with only a hint of a frown. “Is something wrong?”
after all even if it had meant being alone for their final year of school. His stomach suddenly felt like it was full of lead, clenching unpleasantly at the very thought that his name could be the one to be chosen, his skin becoming clammy as he imagine the amount of attention he would receive. But it was too late to do anything about it now; his name had been entered into the

“Yeah, that’s right,” Harry confirmed, cheeks flushing as his gaze finally dropped away from the handsome smile, focusing instead on the crest embroidered onto the left breast of the boy’s blazer and the pin badge that was resting at a somewhat jaunty angle above it. As far as the crest went it was pretty simple, two crossed golden wands on a powder blue field, each emitting three golden stars. It was a pin badge that puzzled him. “…is that a butterfly?”
“It’s disgusting,” Javier announced passionately, all but throwing the rest of his sandwich back onto his plate before grabbing a glass of water and taking three large gulps. “What could possibly possess anyone to willingly eat such a foul thing? Ugh! I can still taste it…”

Before they could get to work a knock sounded, coming from the other side of the door.

It was because of the school song that Draco was finally able to locate his elder cousin due to the fact that she was one of the few students, even amongst the Slytherin’s, who wasn’t singing. Fleur DeLacour, just like her younger sister, had inherited the delicate looks that were common place within the Black family. Her hair, an even brighter shade of platinum blonde than either Draco’s or her sisters, was cut into a bob and styled into messy waves.
Harry winced as Professor Snape’s expression turned positively thunderous as he looked over the parchment, reading the words scratched onto it before checking the signature.
Ramona grunted softly in agreement before letting out a deep sigh, slapping her hands against her thighs as she rolled off of the bed in such a way that she could spring to her feet.
