?” He asked, and his voice was so fucking gravelly, two octaves deeper than his usual pitch. It sent a grating murmur down Harry’s spine, and he squirmed happily. The hurt evaporated. He licked his lips slowly, watched Malfoy’s eyes trace the movement. He grinned.
He’d set his wand down, trying to hold onto the contentment fast dissipating in his stomach, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling on the edge of his happiness, the one that made warning bells start flashing in his head. The one that told him this wasn’t enough anymore. After all, when Draco had started this shit, he’d been lonely as fuck, and desperate. He’d had no expectations. Seeing the response had been like giving a starving person food. But after a while… the person’s appetite is bound to increase. He tried not to think about the fact that maybe this wasn’t sating his newfound desire for… something, god, whatever the hell this was.
Like, what in Salazar’s evil fucking name is a Segway? Why would anyone voluntarily put themselves on a contraption that has wheels and speeds along at a breakneck pace but
As Draco reclaimed his seat beside Pansy, he felt his head start to clog with rising questions, a low- grade panic buzzing in him. Panic, and maybe something else that he chose to ignore.
and faced Draco. His hands- Draco refused to look too closely at them- gripped the armrests firmly, fingers splayed and white- knuckled. His legs were spread wide and his pelvis canted forward almost suggestively, though he knew it was not on purpose, just for balance.
Draco grinned. “Ohhhh, I get it. I’m your everything.” He furrowed his brow, looking mock- concerned. “Pansy, you
It was ridiculous, really. In all Draco’s years at Hogwarts he’d been distracted – obsessed – by Potter. But he’d never gotten to know him, had he? They’d never spoken softly, cross- legged on each other’s four posters at three in the morning like him and Pansy, never joked over breakfast and Vanished each other’s favourite juice. They’d never hugged fierce and hot on platform nine and three- quarters, an icy holiday in the Manor looming over Draco like a Dementor. But somehow, over the years, the corrosive anger between the two boys - the malice and taunts and fights - had led Draco to have a bizarrely deep understanding of Harry Potter, one that provided him a comprehensive, sensitive knowledge of all his weaknesses and fears and darkness. And somewhere along the way… Draco had begun to notice his beauty, all flushed cheeks and bright eyes and quick sarcasm. The way his robes were tight across his chest and hit perfectly on his ankles, fluttering up to expose deliciously delicate arches and tendons. How he was shorter, significantly so, than Draco; that if they stood chest- to chest, Potter could hook his chin over Draco’s shoulder and Draco could maybe dip his head and drink in the scent of Potter’s hair, arms fitting round each other as they pressed so tight they wondered if they could ever let go. Yes, in a perverse way, Draco knew Harry Potter better than he knew anyone else.
“Oh, it’s weird as fuck,” Blaise said with a contented groan, stretching his arms languidly above his head. “But it would be weirder not to get dessert.”
Draco looked up at the students surrounding him, and just behind them, to where Professor Slughorn was just tucking his wand back in the breast pocket of his waistcoat.
Malfoy spun them suddenly, hands sure and firm on Harry’s lower back in a way that made Harry’s eyes fly open in shock and arousal. Malfoy crowded him back against the countertop, pressing their hips together hard so that Harry was completely trapped, his hands coming up to grip Malfoy’s biceps.
“Got it down to a science, have you, Potter? Tell me… how long did it take you to get him whipped? Not long, I imagine… all the boys are just
The cords and tendons beneath him tensed, Malfoy’s chest buttressing with a shocked inhale, and he was utterly still underneath Harry. Stiff, even. Harry was just starting to panic, breath coming faster and humiliatedly into Malfoy’s bare skin, when Malfoy’s arms came up around him, holding him to his chest.
made him inordinately jumpy, like he wouldn’t live up to the expectation, and maybe he’d be a disappointment, and—
“Fuck off, Blasius. No, I sort of…” she trailed off again, and Draco resisted the urge to throttle her.
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Potter grinned disbelievingly, a laugh huffing out as though unbidden. He raised his eyes to the ceiling “Why’re you here, Malfoy?”
“Hey,” she whispered, “it’s alright. There’ll be Muggle Repelling charms plastered all over this joint. Didn’t you see? There were wizards with Disillusionment Charms on them at the top of the staircase. They’ll turn anyone away with a quick
Harry looked up from where his eyes had been fixed on the loveseat arm to see Ginny grinning at him, Hermione snickering, and Ron staring at him in abject horror.
The woman looked up, eyes bright and birdlike. “I believe the bar stocks Hayman’s, Bombay Sapphire, Plymouth, Tanqueray Dry, Hendricks—”
“Malfoy, Malfoy,” Potter was murmuring it, curling into his shoulder, and then his lips were at Draco’s collarbone. He wanted to go slack, let his hands push into Potter’s luscious hair, maybe pull—but they were in public, damn it, and Draco let out a growl that rumbled from his chest to vibrate through the dark- haired boy’s body.
“Yeah,” Hermione opined from the armchair. “Ginny’s right. There’s a time and place for gel, don’t get me wrong, but your hair looks… nice, or, y’know, attractive when it’s a little messier, Harry.” She gave him an earnest look.
The footsteps loudened substantially, shoes striking the stone dully and ringing out in the empty passageway. With a shock of horror, Draco realised he was staring hard at the bend in the corridor, waiting for Potter to round it. He looked down hastily, struck up the pose of examining his fingernails just in time for him to see through his fringe a dark robe- hem, and then a foot, at the end of the corridor. He faked looking up at the sound of steps, offered Potter a small nod as he came closer. It was painfully awkward, waiting for him to come close enough to greet him. He tried not to make eye contact, gaze flitting uselessly over the walls and coming to rest on the tapestry across him. He looked politely at it until Potter was close enough, never looking away, and then turned to face him.
He was desperate not to let his vulnerability show. God. What if Malfoy said he didn’t want it? What if he said he’d never liked Harry before? What if he—
“Liar,” Harry said. Ginny grinned sheepishly. “This is the moment you realised you were gay. You remember everything; I should know, I
The smirk faded off the Hufflepuff’s face as he took in the look in Draco’s eyes. Little shit had forgotten that he was messing with an eighth- year. For one heady second, Draco imagined shoving the idiot’s face into his plateful of mashed potato. But he was itchingly aware, even then, of eyes on him. It went against every grain of his pride to take his hand off the smooth handle of his wand, give the Hufflepuff one last furious stare, and turn. And it would’ve been fine, he would’ve moved on, but then from where he turned around a jeer arose, undoubtedly from the same arrogant worm. Draco whirled, hand flying back to his wand and whipping it out. Before the sneer could even die from the boy’s lips, the kid screamed in shock. He slid to the floor, writhing oddly. The entire Hall erupted in yells. Draco was faintly aware of the teachers rising to their feet from their table. Draco didn’t even know what he’d done to the boy. Horror pooled in his stomach. Had he inadvertently used the Cruciatus on him? A vision flashed before his eyes; smooth, pale skin, slits for nostrils, red eyes like fire. A wand that twirled and jabbed and a high shrill voice laughing, laughing, as Draco twitched in agony on the ground. Draco ran to the Hufflepuff table. A small fair- haired girl who had been sitting beside the boy shrank away from him, pointing down to where the third- year was writhing.
************************************************************************************************************************************************
Obvious, obvious, obvious. Obviously, stupid Draco Malfoy would somehow carry with him the entirely impossible idea that Potter would be behind this whole Muggle song extravaganza.
“There’s got to be some sort of Disillusionment Charm on it!” Hermione yelled from upstairs. “It’s bloody impossible to find.”
“Maybe a little,” he finished lowly, still fucking staring, and Harry walked towards him, tipping the other man’s chin up.
he reminded himself, but couldn’t suppress a smirk. Malfoy, misinterpreting it, openly eyed Harry’s legs. He silently sent a quick prayer of thanks to Ginny for her charm work.
A sleepless night, drunken encounter and deathly boring class drive Draco to the conclusion of what to do next.
The hallway sharpened a little around him, and the black flowers revealed themselves as students, black robes fluttering behind them as they whisked to lessons. Draco stumbled, grinned foolishly, and shouldered his bag. He’d just had a free period, and had spent it swigging from the secret stash of Firewhisky in the eighth- year Slytherin dorms. He’d just about reached a pleasant state of detachment from the world, where he was aware of the things around him but couldn’t find it in himself to care particularly about any of those things.
****************************************************************************************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
In the bathroom, Draco stared into the mirror at the single blond strand hanging just over his forehead. He couldn’t decide if it was aristocratic or pretentious, and it was important to get a good balan—
The light-headedness was leeched out of his bones, leaving him tired and blue, veritably navy blue. He inclined his head towards Zabini.
“Come on, you fat git! Go round, it’s only a measly few metres. I’ll even open the bloody front door if you don’t want the living room window. Just—”
Hesitantly, as though trying not to frighten a startled animal, Blaise leant forward. “So, how did- how did she get finals tickets this early? Ginny, that is. Even for someone in the industry, you’ve got to be, like, on the team to get them so fast.” The words ‘finals tickets’ were spoken in a reverent tone, as though they were something holy.
It was one of those bizarre confluences of his two worlds, the ones that used to happen when they were in school and Dumbledore would pay a visit to Privet Drive, or the time Uncle Vernon had a shouting fit about Dementors. Now Harry was an adult, he’d assumed his worlds would mingle effortlessly, Muggles going about their business in London as he strode about across the street behind the invisible distinction of the wizarding world.
Malfoy gasped above him, and Harry felt warm breath on his hair, Malfoy’s hands sliding down his back to grope him through his jeans, and
“Yeah,” Ginny nodded. “He said it was great at really organic healing, and I should go there because it was like a little holiday, and it was at this nice resort place as well.”
Harry bit his lip, nosed forward slightly, and with an exhale of something like surrender, he pressed his face into the crook of Malfoy’s neck, breathing into it softly. His hand loosened on Malfoy’s cheekbone, sliding down to grip at his black shirt.
“You can’t seriously be denying how… we were that year,” Potter said, gesturing between them. Draco panicked, as he always did when it came to a case of gay accusation.
Did that sound too self- pitying? Maybe it just seemed like that because, though it was meant to be a joke, Draco meant what he was saying a little more than he wanted Pansy to know. Still, there was no way she could know how lonely he’d been. But he didn’t want her to feel sorry for him.  Just in case…
“I don’t think it’s the charm, Pans,” Draco interjected. “Salazar knows that wears thin quick enough. I reckon it’d be more helpful to hit him with a Stinging Hex, warp up his pretty face.”
Blaise mmphed indignantly. “’Scuse me? I’ll have you know my eating habits have often been described as—" he swallowed thickly, “— erotically deliberate and affecting.” He dropped his spoon reluctantly to dab at a corner of his lips with his napkin.
Draco shoved him so hard he fell onto the floor. Blaise lay there, curled up and rubbing his head like an adorable cat in his soft jogging bottoms and gaping flannel, and Pansy tackled him in a hug. They wrestled playfully, Pansy’s dark hair getting in Blaise’s mouth, Blaise’s dimples catching in her sharp little teeth.
Ron swallowed, swiping at his eyes clumsily with the back of his hand. When he spoke his voice was rough.
Seconds were ticking by, and Potter’s lashes were still feathering down. Draco couldn’t see his eyes, and his hand was still splayed tightly over his forearm, both of their wrists tense.
“So, if that’s alright with you then… oh, well, is it?” He asked, realising with a sinking feeling of horror that they’d never actually agreed to anything.
“That will be why, then.” Anybody else would have laughed awkwardly, but Malfoy just stared out of the window, grey eyes intense.
Potter lifted a shoulder, as if to say ‘sure’, advancing slightly in the study to where two cushy armchairs were sitting before a fire. On the second level was the enormous Headmistress’ desk, which was currently vacant.
Malfoy’s eyes were squeezed shut, his breaths harsh and deep. As his eyes fluttered open, he stared at Harry, mouth still slightly open, eyes thick.
Potter’s eyes fluttered for a second as they stared at one another, the crackle of the fire the only sound in the room. His breath was cool on Draco’s lips, his hair soft against his eyelids, and the aching in his cock banked, somewhat, to a low grade hum. He wanted, more than anything, to lick into Potter’s mouth, feel him open up and
And he probably didn’t, Harry realised. He and Bellatrix had visited Grimmauld Place the summer after fifth year; when he, Hermione and Ron had been living here, Kreacher had completely cleaned the place up.
And then? He was going to find out who the fucking mysterious writer was. Anonymity was all very well, but Draco had had his fill of it.
They must have been staring, lips parted, for a decent few seconds before Draco cleared his throat and looked away. It felt like a punch to the stomach, a sudden loss like he’d been losing himself somewhere warm and sweet and sensual, and he’d been jerked out into the cold.
Finnigan broke in with an angry, “hey!” which Draco completely ignored, “— looking like I’ve just gone a round with a pissed- off Skrewt, and my trousers basically down around my
Malfoy shook his head, the smirk disappearing off his lips. The look in his eyes was incredibly intense, sombre, as he stared at Harry, his exposed chest, his hair, his mouth…
Potter sat up, mirroring his posture, and he looked incensed now, fully awake. The lazy ease in the curve of his spine had vanished; he glared at Draco with that expression Draco had always hated and loved in equal measure, the burning one that meant he was about to defend his house and his school. Because he was just that fatally good, he’d never think to actually defend
He exhaled deeply, closing his eyes for a second. “Mmm-kay.” He allowed himself to be led over to their table, in a far corner of the restaurant near one of the arched, wood- panelled windows. They were underground, but the glass had been charmed to show shifting scenes of Japanese mountain scenery, grassy rocks and still, shimmering lakes lying like secrets between high, pure white valley walls. Pansy and Blaise settled themselves on either side of him, and the woman seating them smiled at them through slickly red lips.
The second- year in Draco wanted to hide in a cranny behind a suit of armour and jump out at the other boy.
“Alright, I stand corrected. I do know what it is you think I’ve done, but I can categorically say that I haven’t done it. I haven’t been in contact with the Ministry since…” Draco paused. “Since my father…”
If he listened carefully- Draco turned the shower off and stuck his ear close to the stall door- yes, they were gone. There was no sound of damp feet, no voices echoing against the hollow wooden walls of the Quidditch changing rooms. He opened the stall door and wrapped a towel, hanging from a nearby rack, around his waist. Draco cast a quick Tempus- it was nearly six. He was late for dinner. Cursing under his breath the amount of time his teammates took to get dressed, Draco pulled on his school uniform at top speed, combing his fingers through his wet hair. There was no time to gel it. Staring despondently at himself in the mirror, Draco’s inner Narcissa winced at the sight of his rumpled shirt. Even worse, still damp from the shower, he started to sweat from the starchy cotton against his skin. Draco pushed his shirtsleeves up, threw his tie on- thank Salazar Lucius had drilled him in the art of tying  an excellent half- Windsor; his fingers fairly flew as he knotted the green and silver material- and ran out of the door with his Quidditch bag, stuffed full of gear, banging against his leg.
“I rather think it’s impolite to interrupt when somebody’s offering to blow you,” Malfoy said, and that was enough to make Harry grin.
Potter gasped into his shirt, hand coming up to fist desperately in the dark material as they walked slowly towards the door. Hot breaths panted helplessly into Draco’s shirt. Draco could sense Muggle eyes on them- he tensed, and then melted soothingly as he felt Potter stiffen in reaction. God, his entire body was attuned to this boy gasping in his arms, clinging and glossy- eyed. He wanted to
He felt something wet on his cheeks and Draco realised he was crying, eyes streaming with the strength of the mist their Draught was giving off. Through a haze of tears, he saw Granger helping Weasley up from the floor, and the other students standing around, shocked- looking and frozen. Draco heaved suddenly, stomach convulsing on itself, and his airways felt tight, as though they were closing in. The thick dew of tears blurring his eyesight worsened, and he hacked, arms kept firmly behind his back by whoever was holding him. He had just started to gasp for air as a voice said,
Chatter crackled like static in Draco’s ears, his nerves stabbing at the sound until his fingers jittered anxiously on the table, drumming to a silent rhythm. The various bronze platters piled high in front of him were almost untouched; Blaise, opposite him, was tucking in heartily, but he and Pansy sat chewing their lips, eyes restless.
“To be fair,” Hermione said reasonably, settling herself in the large armchair in the corner of Harry’s room, “The Burrow didn’t even have ensuites before Ron added them. So it’s not as if you would have had it if we hadn’t renovated a bit.”
Theo looked down at himself, and the lurid blush, and his eyes flickered upwards for a second, as though he were rolling his eyes. But then his gaze returned to Draco, and he nodded quickly, Adam’s Apple bobbing so furiously it looked uncomfortable. He opened his mouth, took a breath in, shut it again, and then said hastily, “I think I’ll just wait outside.”
Ron gave him a pitying look from three floors up. “We may be two floors down, but the walls are pretty thin, mate. Either you use it or you get off on some serious pain.”
“That’s fine. He was old, and I think he was glad to go. He was happy when we were living here, but none of us stayed, obviously, and he got lonely—”
“Well,” Blaise said slowly, and Pansy gasped audibly, eyes lighting with interest. She put her spoon down and sat forward. Draco slitted his eyes at her.
Malfoy was coming out the other side, making to lean into the passenger window, his fingers thumbing through his wallet. Harry saw the greenish- silvery slide of Muggle money through his fingers and froze, strangely arrested by the sight of Draco Malfoy counting out five- pound notes for this cabbie.
So, I'm posting this maybe an hour before I go back to school for the first time in months? And to be honest, I don't know what my posting schedule's gonna be like from here on out. But I'm gonna finish this, promise. Please tell me what you guys thought, liked or didn't like! Reading your comments is probably my favourite earthly thing.
, fuck! But you pay the stupid fat thing, Pansy.” And he flung his wallet on the table, standing up and stalking over to the window with his arms crossed.
Pansy looked amazed at how he was withstanding the plea of such a loveable animal. But Draco was different. Draco was strong, hard, unyielding. Cold as ice. Draco wouldn’t-
So green. Draco had always thought they were the brightest, most alive eyes he’d ever seen. He could read them like a book, he thought, and it wasn’t a boast. It was just fact. He’d see so many of Potter’s emotions just play out in his eyes, shifting and mercurial and bloody mesmerising. A green the equal of which he’d probably never seen in his life. And, God, had he tried.
. He wanted the press of his pink lips, and his warm scent, and to trace butterfly kisses on the fine skin of his eyelids. He wanted, he wanted, he wanted, and desire weighted him, rendering him altogether too pliable and needy. Draco swayed forward an inch, mouth parting, his eyes sliding half- lidded. He was already so close, and Potter’s lips were so inviting, and as he closed the gap all there was was one more measly centimetre, their breaths mingling, lips grazing—
Weasley’s jaw worked, and he picked his textbook up defiantly, eyes skimming the page to find the instructions he’d misread. Draco knew which bit it was, too, but stood silently as the other boy fumed and tried to re- find the passage. He watched wearily as Weasley’s eyes finally widened in humiliation, and then looked up at Draco, narrowing in embarrassed anger.
“I’ll have you know, Potter, that many people would pay good money for a decent picture of my lovely arse perched over the lavatory.”
A spike of anger, something hopeless, pierced him for a second. He clenched his jaw irrationally, for no reason that was explainable, except, just—
Harry came up for a breath, tongue flickering over the mark he’d made, and looked up at Malfoy. The sight of him made his breath catch. Malfoy’s head was thrown back, eyes shuttered closed, the strong line of his throat completely exposed, disappearing down into his shirt that Harry wanted all of sudden to be off. He released his grip on Malfoy’s shoulders, fingers sliding down nimbly to unhook Malfoy’s buttons, and then Malfoy’s head was flying forward, eyes open and dark and watching Harry with a hunger that made him flush and bite his lip, focusing on the buttons with concerted effort.
Draco held his breath for a second, terrified of what she might have seen, brain running crazily over how he must have looked just then, earwigging shamelessly. Worse still- had he looked obviously invested in the conversation? In what Potter had to say about Finnigan?
Theo glared at him emotionally, looking strung out, and Draco could feel the superficiality of his grip – it was barely even there; his speed was the factor that had sent the both of them hurtling into the wall. Theo’s wrists, pinning him down, were delicate and trembling, not bruising him or even pinching at him. But the things that arrested Draco were Nott’s eyes. Mossy green and brown- lashed, they were wet and shining with a thick sheen of tears. Draco froze, utterly confounded and past his wits end with the madness of the day.
The showers were’t steamy today- Ravenclaw had had their practice early in the morning and he’d had lessons all day. The only traces of the team were damp spots on the wooden benches where the players had sat, undoubtedly drenched from the rain that had been pouring all morning. There was still a Hufflepuff scarf hanging from one of the pegs above the benches from their last practice- all the houses used the one changing facility  now, since the other three had been burned down in sixth year by Draco’s beloved Auntie Bella. They had yet to be resurrected, for some reason, so all four houses used this one for their practices.  Draco had no idea how they were going to cope in Quidditch season when there were matches on, and two opposing teams would need to be crammed into the same quarters.
Harry stepped forward, anger flushing his cheeks. “I was just trying to be polite, Malfoy. Jesus. I don’t have to fucking make tea if you don’t want it, you just looked—”
“I said,” Malfoy cut through his thought, and his voice was roughened, lowered with a tone that Harry didn’t know, didn’t recognise, but that something in his cock absolutely loved. His stomach clenched as Malfoy went on.
In any case, Flitwick seemed appeased. “Right. Well, if you feel at all dizzy or short of breath, don’t wait around to ask- go straight to the Hospital Wing. However, I think you’ll be fine now.”
Zabini, beside him, looked spooked. He half- turned to Draco and put his hand on his arm, warm profile outlined by the bright white of the walls.  “Malfoy… you know, maybe we should come back…”
In an attempt to wean himself off the addictive- and he was fairly sure, illegal- act of graffiti, Draco had gone into the shower stall to the right of his usual one. Remington, the oblivious wretch, had slid into the stall with the lyrics on the wall, and so Draco had stewed quietly, gritting his teeth the entire shower long, unable to relax under the hot spray of water. He’d listened obsessively to Remington in his stall, enduring the wavering bursts of impromptu song that slid in like demons under the door. And then, like the lost cause he was, he had waited for Remington to get out, listening for the wet slap of feet against tiles to fade away, and Draco had scrambled into his rightful stall, cricking his neck in his haste to turn to the wall with the writing on it. The rush of pure adrenaline at the sight of the new lines, the purr of a hope fulfilled had been good. But the scratching of his own replying words, burned a deep, irrefutable black, had given him a thick feeling of satisfaction in his belly that was even better. The other person had gotten to- what, somewhere in the second verse?
Draco did, at least, have Quidditch, where the team respected the fact that they needed him enough to let him alone. He was captain, so they couldn’t have kicked him out of the team themselves, but they were when all was said and done Slytherins. If they wanted him off the team, there were several ways to push him towards quitting. But they had decided, instead, just to be politely frosty. It was really the best he could hope for, Draco reflected. However, he still liked to stay in the changing room showers until they were all gone. Walking out in a towel- the most hated person in school, completely vulnerable- might have been just too much temptation for the team to resist. And Draco would have hated to be expelled for breaking a few arms.
Draco looked down and followed the other boy, determinedly ignoring the way his nerves were lighting themselves on fire one by one.
“Then again, I don’t think he’d be very obliging. You see, I reckon he has a bit of a crush on me.” He lowered his voice to a whisper, feeling the corners of his mouth tug up in a smile. “Don’t tell anybody, though. I think it’s quite sweet.”
“That’s alright, m’boy, it’s your partner you ought to apologise to. Look! Mr. Potter had to hold him back. Are your wrists alright, Mr. Malfoy? No chafing?”
Draco stood looking after him, hands loosely at his sides, lips still parted as though to spill his secrets into whoever would have them. He was utterly unguarded.
Harry raked a hand through his already rumpled hair. “Hermione,” he said, closing his eyes. “Please, please help me. I’m leaving in twenty minutes.”
“Please,” he said, still smirking. He removed his hand slowly, and Draco stood stiffly by his side, trying to remember how to breathe normally. “I wouldn’t screw us over like that, Malfoy. McGonagall gave us the password for emergencies. And she must be out now. We can wait here for her.”
to do that, exactly, but there was the spark of anger that he knew was definitely his, oh yes, and then there was something else just… building on that, creating a ball of fury in his chest like he’d never known before.
Granger turned to look back at her boyfriend- Draco gagged mentally- whereupon Weasley straightened, forced a smile, and nodded at her nonchalantly. She beamed back, and turned obliviously back towards the unfortunate Bookly, who was completely unaware that his chances of being hit by a Conjunctivitis Curse in the immediate future were rising exponentially every second. Draco watched first amusedly, and then wearily as Weasley shifted right, then left, and, looking desperately around for someone upon whom to relieve his feelings, landed his gaze on Malfoy. His jealous expression shifted to one of ugly vindication, and Draco knew he was about to bear the brunt of Weasley’s slights. Not for the first time, he cursed the fact that Granger, who had seemed like a hopeless case in first year with her buckteeth and bushy hair, had discovered how to skilfully- he had to admit- make use of her feminine wiles. Most of the boys had fucking crushes on her now.
But the most worrying time of all was at precisely eleven fifty- seven at night, in the Slytherin boys dormitories, as Draco, enveloped in a Silencing Charm, came all over his sheets and chest with a mute gasp, visions of red lips and soft hips and bashful, laughing green eyes driving him over the edge until he lay spent and gasping.
The gargoyle rumbled, stone groaning as it slid to the side, rotating to reveal a staircase. Both boys ascended as the gargoyle started to groan once more, spinning slowly to propel them up the stairwell, and depositing them gently at the entrance to McGonagall’s office.
Draco had grabbed his wand, wood slick under his scrabbling fingers, and looped an eager cursive reply, lyrics flowing out of him as easy as breathing, like just turning a tap on and allowing words to stream out.
- the inimitable routine of school life, was something they’d never take for granted again. Not now that the walls had been torn down, leaving them naked and exposed to the cruel Real World. Not now that their defences had only just begun to creep back up again, to reform. Draco hated them, just a little, for their weakness. He narrowed his eyes and pretended not to feel anything.
And then, as if from the depths of his subconscious, summoned from the very last dregs of his schoolboy self, came—
“You’ve lost your wits since we were kids, Malfoy,” Potter smirked, smile stretching to become fully fledged and beautiful. Draco watched it blossom and felt like screaming.
Malfoy staggered back, eyes wild and desperate, confused. He looked ludicrously hot, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to tease, to draw it out. He grasped Malfoy by the arms, and spun them again so their positions were reversed, Malfoy with his back to the hard stone of the counter, and Harry before him. Malfoy’s breaths were shuddery, his brow furrowed.
By the way, I'm working on a oneshot at the moment so the next update might take quite a bit longer than usual
Harry shuddered at the sound, gripping Malfoy tighter, and their rutting was shorter, tighter, more frantic now. Harry could feel himself seizing up, spasms of pleasure making him jerk, and their rhythm was spangled with desperate gasps and uncontrollable twitches.
Ginny and Harry were sitting so close, heads rested inches away from each other, but the space between them might as well have screamed ‘platonic’. For a split second, Harry imagined a future where Ginny and Harry had stayed together, had kids, and been the perfect piece to slot into the jigsaw puzzle that was their story. But then the image was gone, and Ginny’s soft voice continued.
Firstly, he’d need to know which player went in which shower, which was impossible unless he saw it for himself, and he’d need to check the wall  after each player went in. But for that, he’d need to be in the changing rooms at the same time as Gryffindor, which was honestly impossible. Practices didn’t mix. It gave other houses an opportunity to spy on each other, and promoted dirty tricks in the locker room. Back when houses sometimes did split practices and were on the pitch training at the same time, several of the best players got jinxed in the showers by the other team training, or hexed in front of the mirrors. It was a minefield for poor sportsmanship.
“I trust you will make an effort to keep your temper in check in future?” Draco nodded. Face restored to its usual frown, Professor McGonagall swept back up to the staff table, leaving Draco standing, wand dangling uselessly by his side.
It was bad enough he was this tired, but he was damn hungry, too, and there was no way he could eat a bite before Potter came in and they could enact the first step of the Plan. Draco’s Plan.
“But I have always thought that perhaps it is easier for Gryffindor and Slytherin to be so,” She continued. “At odds. After all, people such as the both of you as
“Please. You should be thanking these jeans,” Harry replied archly. “I saw how you were staring at them. Or, rather, what’s under them.”
Draco swallowed, and it was already to late to acknowledge it. He just hoped he could pull off the suave walk- away, no- looking- back kind of thing.
. Just. Take me… let’s go… please.” He looked utterly bewildered, voice breaking into a soft whine, and that part of Draco that lay still, had lain still for a long, long time, broke forwards with seamless decisiveness.
“I won’t tell anyone, Zabini,” Draco said quietly, and he meant it. “I can keep a secret.” He shot his left forearm, imprinted with the Dark Mark, an amused glance. “Obviously.”
********************************************************************************************************************************************
His pale eyes were fixed on Potter, and Draco hated the expression in them. He looked like he was just about restraining himself from holding Harry away from Draco, stroking his hair back and hiding him from the room. It was possessive, was what it was. Fuck, Draco despised it. He wanted to slap the look off the Irish boy’s face, wanted to jinx him until he got it into his thick skull that Potter didn’t belong to him, he couldn’t. Ever. Because obviously he belonged to—
Draco tried hard not to blush, thoughts crashing back to a series of very vivid images of Potter holding his wrists with… other intent.
He’d been sitting alone for at least twenty minutes, and the restaurant had long since settled back into its usual elegant rhythms of music and conversation. But Harry was too embarrassed to do what he really wanted to, which was inquire as to where the toilet was, and then pay the bill and get out. He looked up desperately as a waiter glided by on quick, light feet, and then down again with a frustrated grimace.
“Stop sulking,” Draco gritted, irritation filing his voice sharp. “And help me find the Kneazle saliva, would you?”
He could imagine Pansy’s face right about now; disapproving as hell, mouth pursed and eyes flat. “Please tell me you didn’t, Draco,” she’d say acidly. He grinned.
Potter turned his head suddenly too, so they were eye- to- eye. His breath ghosted over Draco’s cheek, warm and soft. From this close, Draco could see the tangle of his lashes pressing into his glasses, the slight flush at the top of his cheekbones.
Zabini rolled his eyes furiously, so hard Draco honestly thought they might just stay stuck up there, pupils swooping up into his beautifully sculpted brows.
Draco snarled at a flash of billowing black robe in his left periphery, snatching Weasley’s wrist before he could empty a measure of ground Rottskunk nails into the creamy surface of their potion.
By the time Harry had his fingers on the wood of the door he was ready to cry. He longed for nothing more than to be on his Firebolt, hundreds of metres high, hovering in the balmy summer evening air, distanced from every other human being on the planet. Free and light, confident in his every movement. Not here in this hell that seemed spiked and maliciously armed against him, trapped in his body that quaked and froze and sent shots of pure fear dissolving through his bloodstream at its own whim. He opened the latch with clumsy fingers, going through the gate and shutting it behind him. The barman didn’t give him a second glance; he breathed a sigh of relief.
He gave her a polite nod, felt her disbelief reverberate through his head like a buzzing shock. Tried to ignore it.
Spiky, written in a scrawling hand, a slightly off- kilter line of script just below Draco’s own cursive.
“We love your new girlfriend. We love her so much we’re willing to date her, and we’re both gay,” Draco joked. His smile faded when he saw the snarl cut into Pansy’s fairy- like countenance.
“But it is what it is. That’s what happened earlier this week. I freaked out, and passed out, and my breathing was messed up so my muscles went into a sort of spasm. But it’s not the bandages, okay?” Potter said fiercely, raising his head. His green eyes were bright with vulnerable tears, and maybe shame too. “…those cuts were a mistake. I’m not as weak as that.” He shook his head vehemently, dark hair flopping over his face.
To Draco’s amazement, Zabini got up from where he was sitting on the desk with a minimum of bitterness, long trousered legs neatly uncrossing at the ankles. With a conciliatory look at Potter, Zabini drew his slim wand from his robes and flicked it over himself.
“No harm done, Mr Malfoy,” Slughorn said jovially, lowering his glasses in mock- disapproval. “Luckily for Mr. Weasley here—” Draco cast a glance at the ginger and had to repress a snort at his thunderous expression “—Mr. Potter intervened in time. Just the effect of a particularly strong Wistful Draught, I think; this does tend to happen, if a mishap occurs and particularly sharp frustration is felt. The potion’s mist can be highly potent, if emotions rise a little too high. Indeed, students do usually have a bit more trouble than usual concentrating when they make this.” Slughorn chuckled. “Too busy daydreaming.”
The yellow eyes looked back at him beseechingly, and the fat on the owl’s back jiggled as it refolded its wings. It was a tiny bit adorable.
“Don’t say that,” Potter said angrily. “She… she vouched for you, when you needed it, and Godric knows she’s seen the worst of me. Don’t- don’t make out like everything’s so against you. That isn’t what this is.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. Was that- he blinked. It seemed to defy even Longbottom’s usual level of magical bumbling. But yes- instead of two largeish, slightly pigeon- toed feet sticking out from beneath Longbottom’s robes, there sat, like a great mushroom, what could only be described as a voluminous flipper. Longbottom attempted to stand independently, but his flipper curled unsteadily on the floor, one webbed edge teetering as though weighing up its decision, and then he crashed back into Potter, cheeks pressing together in breathless, thoughtless schoolboy familiarity. Potter’s green eyes were bright behind his glasses, hair untidily rumpled and unapologetically black, so very black that it made his already fair skin seem like snow. He was all clear lines and colours and tangled eyelashes pressing into the lenses of his glasses, one long- fingered hand splayed over the small of Longbottom’s fucking undeserving back, and-
Draco resisted the urge to stand up straighter like a schoolboy and call her Professor. “Fascinating. He’s a wonderful author.”
He flushed hard, wanted to look at Potter again, but they were turning, and all he caught was a glimpse of Potter smiling after them, looking as though he’d found something unexpectedly pleasant.
Weasley gestured miserably to the patch of dingy dungeon floor just hidden by the corner of their work bench, and Draco went, breath coming sluggishly and blood pumping.
He grinned idiotically at Potter for at least twenty seconds before Potter’s own smile softened to a smirk, and he leaned against the wall beside Draco, dropping his bag unceremoniously by his feet. Draco tried desperately not to get too worked up about the fact that their shoulders were only centimetres away, instead focusing on a speck of ink on Potter’s collar.
“WAIT!” Draco grabbed his arm senselessly, gaze trained on Potter’s. The other man’s vivid eyes went wide, mouth dropping open slightly. His eyes went instinctively to where Draco’s hand was encircling his forearm, fingers spread wide over the pale, lean expanse of his forearm.
Draco resisted the urge to hide from Granger’s venomous gaze behind Potter, who he could hear groaning quietly behind him.
Draco glanced up, eyelids heavy, to see Potter tucking his wand back into the slack waistband of his trousers. Several lewd things came to mind, but he brushed them off, instead opting to duck his head, staring resolutely at his shoes. Now that his head was completely clear, Draco realised just how drunk he’d been. Silence yawned like a fat, awkward cavern.
********************************************************************************************************************************
Finnigan looked like he wanted to reply, but then Potter lunged, completely out of the blue, and Finnigan was holding him back, and
He glanced around at the Gryffindor team, most of whom were sitting near him. Draco looked, too. Demelza Robins looked like she was game. Alicia Spinnet, too. Jimmy Peakes wasn’t there, Ritchie Coote was so young he was practically irrelevant…
Lavender Brown, a simpering smile fixed upon her silly face, smiled back at Potter from near the front of the classroom, and sent a paper aeroplane fluttering towards him, scribbled over with a stupid little note in her feminine cursive. Potter unfolded the thing and read the message quickly, green eyes alive with humour, and he sent Brown this bright, secret grin as though they were in on a big hushed up piece of news.
“So, Ginny, how come you’re here, and not at your flat?” Hermione asked, knitting needles flashing deftly before her. She was sitting opposite Ginny, much to Ron’s delight, and poor Ginny was being forced to slowly eat away at the brimming bowlful of oatmeal sitting in front of her. It was even thicker now, having been left on the stove to congeal since that morning.
But he was stressed, and there was no getting around that fact. His palms were slick with sweat, nails making crescent moons on their skin. His hair was stuck irritatingly to the back of his neck, and he was itching to move it, but he just
“Did you engage in a duel with anyone today, Mr Malfoy?” Flitwick looked uncharacteristically stern, small hands steepled to his furrowed brow.
Ron’s brows pulled together for a second, and his eyes flicked over Ginny’s face, as though searching for something.
Kreacher… Harry thought sadly, but didn’t have time to linger past the memory of his excellent French onion soup before Malfoy spoke, his voice cautious.
Within five minutes, a gleaming silver tray was floating towards them, laden with their drinks and the various bottles. A bucket of ice cubes floated off the platter and placed itself importantly in the centre of the table as they reached for their drinks.
Harry turned, shoulders back, refusing to appear anything but completely ordinary, and brushed past a short wizard pushing open the door. The sudden proximity of the other man made him flinch inadvertently backwards into the door, which hit him hard on the arse as it swung closed. He yelped, catching a glimpse of the wizard’s alarmed expression through the gap in the door before it slammed, and he turned sheepishly round to face the whole bathroom.
He swallowed, and some dim part of his brain that was still functioning noted that Potter mirrored the action, the outline of his Adam’s Apple bobbing slightly as he ducked his dark head further.
Even now, Draco thought half- amusedly, fortified by a large breakfast, he found it difficult to resist the pull. His mouth watered slightly, and he swallowed hard, determined to think of something else. It would be completely mortifying if Potter arrived and he was drooling onto the stone flags.
McGonagall watched them mount the gargoyle’s staircase, and as she nodded from behind her desk, the stone rumbled and began to turn slowly again, rotating until it deposited them on the corridor below where they had begun, and McGonagall had vanished from sight.
Blaise shoved him lightly, and they started to playfight, jostling each other until Draco wobbled on his chair, legs screeching as he leant too far back. He grabbed the table for support, accidentally dragging it over the smooth wooden floors so it screeched loudly. The fluting music of the restaurant died down, and nearly everyone turned to face him, eyes questioning and brows raised as if to say, ‘
This woman was unfortunately unaware of that fact, and she nodded, flustered, lips pursed in concentration, eyelashes flickering as she stole subtle glances at Blaise, who was now examining his perfect fingernails with elegant disinterest.
It was a shock when Potter grinned outright, completely throwing Draco’s ‘be bored and cool’ plan off kilter. Instead of greeting him with a lazy ‘hey’, he found himself grinning helplessly back, unable to resist the liquid tug of that smile. It brightened Potter’s entire face, and his eyes really, really didn’t need it. With that sort of expression, they were basically supernovas.
Intoxicated as he was, even Draco could tell what he’d stumbled into. He gaped up at them, a hard lump of something sticking in his throat that he could not seem to speak around. He did not look at Potter. His pulse thrummed frantically in his ears, and one thought was slamming itself repeatedly into the walls of his brain.
But he hadn’t said anything. And she’d gone, whisked away in a little whirlwind of grief and fear and, he now recognised, selfishness.
to use Alohomora. Everything should work by itself, without me needing to break out OWL- level spells, and it doesn’t, and I will not fucking just sit down and accept sub- standardness in my house.”
Wow, it's been so long since I updated this fic. Honestly, I've been working so hard at the other fic and school and exams, I've hardly had any time. But I've managed to write- scrambled up in the dark watches of the night- some semblance of a chapter? It's nothing huge, not much action. But just some continuance, to keep the juices flowing. I must say, it felt so lovely to come back and work on this.
“I’m just saying,” Blaise shrugged. “Kind of hypocritical for you to give her shit about dating the Weaslette when you were gagging for Potter’s golden—”
A wave of tenderness enveloped Draco, the like of which he’d never felt before. He wanted, more fiercely than he’d ever experienced, to stroke back the feathered chaos of Potter’s dark, silken hair, to curl up next to him and fit their bodies together, breathe softly over the gold- stained expanse of his cheek.
It was ginger at best, tentative, but Harry pushed past it. Malfoy had probably never considered house- elves equals in his life. This was something, surely.
Draco woke early, restless, head thick and dizzied from lack of sleep. He stretched on the couch, groaning, and stood gingerly, hugging himself, before making his way over to the dark wooden drinks cabinet standing over by the west wall. Clumsily, he made himself a cup of milky Earl Grey, and sat cross- legged on the window seat to eke out the hours until breakfast, as the dawning sun sent warm, newborn rays stroking down through the water, caressing Draco’s face and staining the lake a becoming gold-green.
, was the shrill refrain of his subconscious, shrieking a little hysterically over a bass rumble Draco could identify as,
“Fine!” He said nervously. “Just go on.”He pressed his lips so tightly together Harry feared they might be severed from his face altogether.
Now, Draco didn’t want to seem fixated on one bloody annoying Saviour, so he thought it important to note that the Patil twins were also doing a fair bit to irritate him. They kept giggling, high, shrill shrieks echoing forwards and piercing Draco’s ears down to the very tissue of his brain. His peace of mind was so severely perturbed by the time they decided to shut up and work that he had to keep reading sentences over and over as their meaning steadily diminished, until he had no idea what he was learning about.
it that, Ron. Honestly, one second you’re a child, and the next second you’re a bloody grandpa.” She pressed her nose deeper into the plush cushions of the seat and huffed.
Slytherin was for bad wizards! Of fucking course he was going to pick not to go there—but the parents of these kids are in Slytherin! It’s their family tradition, and you can’t expect them to go against that at fucking age eleven—"
“…oh,” was all Draco said, carefully neutral. To tell the truth, he would have screamed ‘ha- ha- ha’ in Zabini’s face, but he was far too interested in finding out about his relationship with Potter to break this new bond.
There was silence from opposite him, but not the oppressive kind. It was thoughtful, more like, but weighted all the same.
“Well, he didn’t, did he?” Weasley replied, and it silenced the dark haired boy for a moment. Draco was fascinated, hands slackening on the leather of his satchel as he leant in. A voice in the back of his mind screamed that he was being painfully obvious. But the worry was silenced by Potter’s murmur, so low Draco had to strain in order to hear.
Fucking  clearly, that was Potter’s voice. Potter, pressed up against him in Potions, holding his wrists tight and breathing hotly over his neck and mocking him—
He wanted to hide in Potter, slide onto his lap and press open- mouthed kisses on the soft skin of his shoulder, his neck. Slide his glasses off and tangle their fingers together, fall asleep in the crook of his arm, breathing in his scent, his hair.
Potter stepped in, nose to nose with Draco, lips deliberately shaping their next words, so precise and thoughtlessly mesmerising that Draco found himself watching their movement, and it was due to this that when he actually started to  pay attention to what Potter was saying, he had a hugely delayed reaction to it.
The pale first light of the new morning filtered down through the blackish water of the lake, streaming in dappled droves through the glass windows of the Slytherin dorms. The air was fusty with dust mites, and the heavy coverlets had been shucked, consciously or not, by most boys to tangle around their pyjama- clad legs. The sound of gentle breathing slid around Draco, insinuating itself in the space between his ears, already crammed full of the vivid memory of Potter leaning close, thick hair-
“Wha-?” Draco said sleepily. He opened his eyes a half- inch, brain processing everything that had just been said, and then his eyes flew open with a jolt, and he sat up immediately. There was a yelp just to his right, as though somebody had sprang away from his bed quickly.
,” he said, and Potter’s neck snapped up so he was staring at Malfoy, eyes wild and confused. For once, Draco couldn’t read them
“Okay, fine,” Ginny said, rolling her eyes, and she visibly sobered, concentrating past the Firewhisky buzz, narrowing her eyes and raising one brow slightly in a quizzical, lightly sarcastic way.  Her mouth quirked up in a half- smile, and Harr could imagine her exactly at age fifteen, icy and fine- boned, hot disdain evident in every clean swoop of her face.
He was trapped, he knew, but he fought anyway, because nobody would fucking say he just stood there and longed to wreck Potter and be wrecked in turn. At the very least, they’d add that he struggled. A bit.
Zabini saw the realisation dawn on his face, and before Draco could blush or move or stammer out a reply, he cut him off.
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************
The Great Hall buzzed with students, hands reaching for chicken legs, great tureens of peas and ladlefuls of soup. Draco passed like a shadow between the rows of people, weaving his way towards a far corner of the Slytherin table. Nobody looked up as he passed, head down. It was a good thing too, he thought musingly, because he was really not in the mood for anyone to comment on the state of his hair. Draco made an effort to keep his shoulders away from his ears- he didn’t mind being alone, but actively projecting the image of awkward ex- Death Eater was a bridge too far. Just because people thought he was something didn’t mean he had to act the part. So Draco shoved his hands in his trouser pockets and put his shoulders back, now doing what could only be described as an unattractively arrogant swagger down the length of the Great Hall, passing between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. He winced inside. There was playing for unconcerned, and then there was this. And, yes- people were actually starting to look at him- scornful, disgusted looks that made him grit his teeth and pretend his skin was as thick as his mother’s.
Her tone was unsure, but the woman nodded professionally, gathering three menus in her slim arms with a practiced snap and leading them ahead to a set of stairs. “Just this way, please. Silver guests are seated downstairs.”
Harry stared at him. “What, my jeans? What’s wrong with my bloody jeans? They’re black, non- ripped; they’re about as inoffensive as jeans get!”
The churning in his stomach refused to abate even slightly, and Draco felt more than queasy now - much as he hated to admit it, he had to lean against the wall of the changing rooms as he crossed the threshold, dizziness amplified by the shower- steamy air, thick with the scent of soap and young, male sweat.
Draco’s jaw clenched. He couldn’t let that happen. He needed this person, whoever it was, to get him past Potter and this ridiculous… infatuation that could never lead anywhere.
Stepping back to admire his work, Draco smiled to himself. Small joys like defacing school property- it was nice to feel like a schoolboy again. If Draco concentrated hard enough, he could feel Pansy’s sharp elbow against his ribs, jabbing him-
“Your own fault for wearing tights out, Potter,” he said snottily. Harry wasn’t even slightly fooled.
“That’s not my fault!” Potter exclaimed, and looked up slightly in nervousness, checking to see if anyone had heard. Draco looked away quickly, and busied himself with his bag.
“You can’t tell anybody, Draco.” His voice was small, impossibly so, and Draco had to wonder if this was really the Boy who Lived.
Ginny trailed off, and looked at Ron pointedly. “If you think you can handle this, fine. But on your head may it rest. Consider this a warning. I will be talking about my teenage self fancying someone.”
Harry came down the stairs two at a time, ducking into the living room to see Ginny, covered in soot and a mulchy mixture of mud and leaves, standing crossly before the fireplace. He raised his eyebrows.
Harry grinned into the large mug of hot chocolate he was slurping. “Why would anyone want a pap shot of that?” He mock- trembled. “Traumatic sight.”
“Don’t use that toilet,” she said weakly. “I’d like to take this opportunity to officially name it my morning sickness toilet.”
Harry swallowed, heart rabbiting in his chest. He would’ve thought giving head should’ve been the thing to make him nervous, but Malfoy kneeling there, looking like a fucking wet dream-
, he urged himself desperately. But there was a blank space behind his mouth, no words to string out and fill the silence with.
Harry grinned. He caught the blazer as it cleared the last few steps, shrugged it on over the silky shirt, and gave Ron the two fingered salute as he headed for the Floo.
“Pansy Parkinson, you had better tell us right this minute. You cannot be telling me you have dragged us along this godforsaken mud path of a plotline with you only to leave us stranded in a dung- filled ditch. Come on. Give us the good bit,” Draco demanded.
“I turned around to the Slytherin table, and there was this cluster of girls in your year, sniggering together and kind of looking at me? Immediately, I knew they were, like, making fun because I was alone. I don’t reckon you ever had this, Hermione, because you were always with these two—”
Harry swore. “Right, off with the shirt.” He started trying to unbutton the unfortunate garment frantically before giving up, tearing it wholly off, and making his hair even more of a desperate situation than before.
Ron squeezed his eyes shut, already pale face going an alarming shade of snow- white. “Merlin’s saggy balls—”
Weasley, who was at least two inches taller than him, stepped back and ran a hand through his thick ginger hair.
“Come on, Ginny, tell us!” Harry said excitably, bouncing on the arm of his chair. Ginny looked up and gave him a deeply affectionate look, badly masked with a thin veil of irritation.
He sped past the others, landing quickly and nearly stumbling, but catching himself before the lot of them could snigger. Draco took his broom in hand and jogged to the changing rooms, opening the door with forced restraint, and trying not to rip his clothes off until the team had dispersed from the usual traffic jam at the doorway.
The three of them began to move towards the square, their breaths evening out as they adjusted to the abundance of oxygen. The cobbles were vaguely round under the stiff soles of Draco’s smart shoes, and as they stepped onto the pavement of one of Mayfair’s most expensive squares he wobbled, tipping slightly into Blaise, who stood stoically like a stunningly handsome post until Draco regained his balance. With a grateful pat on the shoulder they ducked across the street, weaving in between the traffic jam of highly- polished cars in an attempt to catch up to Pansy, who had set an extremely brisk pace. Her dark red dress gleamed in the pale light, and fluttered around her ankles slightly as she reached the other side of the road and continued across the heart of the square without once looking back to check on the other two. Draco and Blaise exchanged amused glances and continued to plunge in and out of the tiny gaps between bumpers and tyres, turning this way and that to avoid streaking their suits with grease.
Unsurprisingly, Draco immediately felt horribly drunk, legs weak and head so light he felt as though he were floating.
He looked up, tucking the paper back into his pocket, and cleared his throat, stepping right up the the gargoyle. His voice, when he spoke, was clear and strong.
It had started after the War, really. It wasn’t one of those gradual things, textbook medical issues that sprouted and grew over time. Exactly a week after Harry had defeated Lord Voldemort, he’d woken up in a cold sweat in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place, where they’d all been living while Ron and Hermione paid for the Burrow’s renovation. They’d been going out for lunch that day. It had been strange anyway, that feeling of freedom. The previous few days had been like something out of a dream. The absence of Voldemort had been surreal, and he’d thought that he was going to wake up any moment and find himself on the marble in Malfoy Manor, or lying tangled on the ground, thick with mulch and leaves, in the Forbidden Forest. It had been odd anyway. But that lunch… had been nightmarish. Harry remembered with a shudder how, when their waitress had approached- she must have been only seventeen, their age, with a bouncy ponytail of curling blonde hair and a shy smile- his heart had burst to thundering life, filling his veins with electricity and freezing him in place. He’d wanted to spring up and run away, screaming, but as she approached, coming closer and closer to their table, it was as though there was a great pressure bearing down on him, keeping him pinned in place. The cogs in his brain ground to a halt, and he was left pounding on the walls of his subconscious. The innate ‘Harry’ that he knew had vanished through his fingers like he never existed at all. He’d sat, ashen- faced, trembling, while the waitress asked for their orders. He hadn’t been able to utter a word. Hermione had asked for five more minutes, and she’d bent her head towards him, looking concerned. The sight of her familiar, soft brown eyes, combined with the sheer relief of the blonde ponytail retreating behind the bar, had loosened the vice- tight grip on Harry’s chest. He’d taken a shaky breath in, swallowed, and asked if they could ‘go home.’
There was a gasp from Potter, a sort of inhaled, snatched- off whine, and then, with a force that seemed to almost topple him, he pulled himself off Draco, straightening minutely within the tight circle of his arm.
won’t turn, well, it did, but the handle didn’t, so it’s they key’s fault, I know it, and now it’s fucking broken, and the mail’s just sitting in the bloody garden getting grassy and stinking of
“Because there’s a fucking right answer and a wrong answer, Ginny! Or, more specifically, there’s three right answers and one wrong answer!” Ron’s voice was obtrusively loud, shredding their soft friendly afternoon into ribbons, and Harry realised they were suddenly witnessing an argument.
him, and then mouth at his love handles while he lay whimpering in the aftermath. His fingers plied the soft flesh of Potter’s hip, and the boy moaned outright, and Draco felt a great pulse of blood rush inevitably to his cock, and then- sweet Salazar- his left hand came away from where it had somehow tangled in Potter’s hair. He opened the door wide. In a tangle of limbs and breath and stormily conceived desire, they stumbled through it, out of the restaurant, and into the cool ambiance of London at night.
“I have no idea what you’re referring to,” he said haughtily, lifting his chin. His heart hammered beneath his shirt, and he wished he could loosen his collar.
The other boy’s smile grew, and he spun to lean his back flat against the wall, lacing his hands behind his head with a lazy easiness that made Draco’s stomach flip.
The other man’s eyes squeezed shut for a half- second. “She inherited it automatically. Before you and Dumbledore removed her from the magical equation.”
“Okay.” Pansy tucked a piece of hair behind her ear, silky strands snagging slightly on her roughly- filed nails. She took a shallow breath, and started.
“Seems right, don’t you think, given you’ve hoovered up three- quarters of the meal?” Draco smirked. His fingers were restless, sliding over his expensive Muggle watch, toying with the tablecloth, smoothing over his suit trousers.
And then Granger left, leaving Draco slightly short of breath, confused and intrigued and altogether late for his next lesson.
Ron paled, and appeared to steel himself, drawing himself up from his seat on the arm of Hermione’s chair.
“We talked!” Pansy said defensively. “She complimented my bag. And when I bought my new wand- remember, Blaise, how I broke the old one—”
“I told him,” Potter resumed, in a harried tone, “if he wanted to mess around, he couldn’t tell anyone.”
A plume of smoke curled out from the doorway as the corridor was revealed, thin and tapering. The portraits lining the walls went on for so long that the painted faces became indistinct. A ripple of murmurs spread along the paintings; some of the inhabitants who had been snoozing awoke with a jerk to glare at Harry and Malfoy, muttering to their neighbours.
The woman turned to Draco, face downturned as she scribbled Pansy’s order onto the pad of creamy paper she was holding.
Professor Flitwick flicked his wand, gathering the books into a pile once more, and set them to distributing themselves around the class. Draco winced as a textbook landed with a heavy thump on the wood of his desk. He looked up to see Zabini still glowering at him, newspaper in hand. Draco glared right back, until Zabini stalked to the back of the classroom, throwing himself into an unoccupied chair with an irritating amount of grace.
He turned a little sterner suddenly, and everybody stood straighter. “However, it can be rather dangerous when partners fall out, and their anger is strong enough for the potion to exacerbate to violent levels. You did drop the Kneazle saliva, did you not, Mr Weasley?”
But he was already pulling out a piece of parchment from the bureau that stood at the end of the dormitory, picking up a spare quill and pulling the ink pot towards him. The irresistible charm of pouring out one’s mind had him spellbound- before he knew it there were cursive words spilling out onto the parchment like thread from a spool.
, by any chance? Because, if so, you know you can call it that, right? We’re all of age here.” He smirked in Blaise’s direction. “We’ve all done some questionable things in the name of hanky- panky.”
Fingers on his buckle, but Harry didn’t pause as he mirrored Malfoy’s actions, both of them unzipping the other, breaths huffing into each others mouths as they kissed fiercely, hotly. They stepped out of their trousers, breaking away from one another, and Harry’s struggle with the skinnies made Malfoy snort. Harry flipped him an entirely unconvincing middle finger, but Malfoy’s red lips were irrepressibly happy, smug, bitten raw. Harry was not charmed.
More to stop himself thinking than anything, Draco ducked back under the shower spray, scrubbing his hands through his hair and massaging his scalp roughly. But his eyes opened as though controlled by a wilful spirit, and snatched another glance at the inscription. Though his pupils stung, hazed with water, he couldn’t tear his gaze away.
Hope everyone likes this one- it's not too action- filled, but it's a build up I guess. I don't know. There's so much emotion I can't really tell what it is to be honest. Draco likes his secrets and I'm not the invasive type.
“Alriiiight,” Harry groaned, propping his head on his hand. “But you cannot laugh. Merlin, I can’t believe I’m telling you this. Fucking Firewhisky making me just say everything.”
Immediately, his face looked severe and bony, cheekbones too sharp, ears noticeably prominent. Draco pulled the strand out again, and took a breath. At first glance, it was great- now he was wondering with relief how he could have doubted—
Draco was mortally offended. He’d never been called an oaf in his life. Oaf was the sort of his he used to call Hagrid. It implied clumsiness, dirtiness, vulgarity. Draco was, he knew for a fact, none of these things.
, Malfoy, for fuck’s sake,” Zabini said, gaze raking over the airy classroom. He was clearly looking for something. Draco stared at him for a long moment, before stepping in front of him and waving his arms obnoxiously, bag clunking against his thigh.
would be a formidable thing indeed. Volatile, yes.” Her gaze raked over Potter’s tie, the mussed fall of Draco’s hair. “Explosive, yes.” Her eyes came to rest on both of their faces, tilted slightly downwards in awkward deference, embarrassment.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************
“We’ll ask McGonagall for permission at lunch. Meet me in the corridor outside her office at twelve- forty!”
The sheer- shirted guy had flicked his hair about eight times by the time Pansy was midway through ordering their meals, and Blaise’s tall bottle of Ogden’s was running extremely low.
His throat felt completely ruined, fucked raw, but he didn’t want to move an inch, even as Malfoy was coming down his throat, shuddering and threading his hands through Harry’s hair. When he gentled, slumping back against the counter, Harry finally pulled off, jaw throbbing.
Harry felt drugged, kind of, swimming in this haze. His breath kept catching and he was faintly aware that he was mewling, little wounded whines muffled in the black fabric he was pressing his face into. The only clear, real thing was the person attached to that shirt, the person who was filling his nose with pines and smoke and cold, clean cologne.
he tried, waving his wand over himself. Quickly, Potter withdrew his wand from his robe pocket- cheeks still a pale pink- and cast,
He stood, slowly, and proffered a hand. Like this, he was almost as tall as Draco, stretched to his full height, shoulders back and proud. The Gryffindors sitting beside him rose to flank him, too, an odd solemnity to their faces. And, Draco had to admit, this had to be a momentous first. Slytherin and Gryffindor, voluntarily doing something together. A
Zabini gave him a faux- wounded look, and it was shockingly comfortable, the two of them. “Well, be that as it may, he’d faced a lot worse, and he sussed out that I was cagey about anyone in the wizarding world finding out. So after the third session, he approached me, and we talked, and he reassured me he wouldn’t tell anyone unless I wanted them to know. And we sort of… got close, after that. Met up a lot, talked a lot. But when I got better, more secure in the new world and at dealing with shit at home… Harry had difficulty. He’s been okay so far this year, but at the beginning of this week I knew he’d had a bad relapse when I couldn’t find him anywhere. I found out from Dean Thomas he was in here.”
“And, you know, it wouldn’t be anything official, just… well, I don’t know the word. I don’t think anyone’ll have an issue with it. Just off the books, right. But still scored. We don’t need a, like, commentator or anything. As long as it’s match conditions. We’ll have to share a, a changing room, of course,” he said, and swallowed.
A discovery in the Quidditch showers and an unburdening of one blond Slytherin's troubles by the magic powers of quill and ink.
A little melody, rendered rough and low in the boyish timbre of his voice, but in his head each note was shrill and high. He knew the song by heart- a Muggle song. He’d heard it sometime after his father’s funeral. Lucius had just died, weak from Azkaban and the inevitable fall of Voldemort, and Narcissa had fled mere days before to somewhere in the South of France. She’d tried to make Draco come with her, but he’d been determined- just to spite her, she’d said angrily- to stay for eighth- year. He could still recall, Draco thought bitterly, the sight of her pale face, a little decorous tear gleaming on her cheek, as she Apparated away from him.
Draco gritted his teeth. Something about seeing Potter lying vulnerable and alone made him snappish and brittle. It unsettled him, and he didn’t like it.
Pansy flicked an amused look towards Blaise, who was already schooling his mouth into something like gravity.
Blaise shrugged languidly. He was very rarely affected by alcohol; the only way anyone would know he had drunk anything at all was by the glitter in his eyes, which were a little glossier than usual.
Harry slipped the third button out of place, and adjusted the shirt so it hung low, but not obscenely low, over his chest. He stood before the mirror, grabbing his pot of gel and dipping a careful finger into it. Ginny grabbed his wrist before he could do anything.
A pause. And then Malfoy nodded slowly, jerkily. The rabbiting of Harry’s heart allayed slightly. He stepped up to the doorway, muttering an ‘
Finnigan’s trousers were loose around his hips, evidently hastily pulled up, and his hair was a mess, as though there had been hands carded through it quite roughly, running against the direction of the gel that had been stroked into it. His greyish- blue eyes were sheepish, and there was a firm glint in them that was… a little challenging. Or were they even-
“We’ll do it. As long as it’s casual.” He looked Draco in the eye. “No dirty tricks, mind games, trying to injure us. A practice game, that’s all. Nothing else. Deal?”
“Stop being a child,” Zabini hissed, knocking his arms down and turning away. He’d evidently not found what he was looking for, as his eyes were anxious and his voice thin when he spoke.
“Ah, Draco,” Blaise said, clutching at his heart. There was still a smudge of chocolate mousse at the side of his mouth. “You are so cold to me now. So cruel. I remember a time when you used to look at me with soft grey eyes, so trusting over your green Slytherin tie. I remember how you used to blush when we made eye contact. I remember thinking how, for a virgin, you were surprisingly
Potter’s voice became harder, sharpened by something that mingled defensiveness and urgency. “These weren’t from this week.” He gestured to his wrists for the first time, a careful slide of fingers over the bandages, and Draco winced, unable to meet the other boy’s eyes. Blaise, beside him, was still.
But Draco’s blood was up, suddenly, and he was close to Potter, so close that he fancied he was swallowing down the warm puffs of breath Potter was exhaling, feeding Potter his own air as well.
Pansy clutched reassuringly at his hand again, and he knew she was silently telling him to calm down. They were both waiting, waiting for a certain dark head to duck into the Hall and sit at the Gryffindor table.
Ron leapt onto the remark like a fly onto rotting meat. “So,” he began eagerly, “so, d’you want some of my oatmeal? I mean,” his ears flushed a light shade of pink, as they always did when he was searching for an idea. Harry saw it strike him, and his face became the epitome of husbandly concern.
“D’you think he knows we’re here? He probably does.” Draco gave a piteous moan. “Oh Salazar, he’s probably
“Up, baby, up. We’re going, we’re going,” he murmured, bending to whisper into Harry’s ear. His hands grazed suddenly over his shoulders, and then with a finality that slammed into Draco like a fist he was curling his hands round Potter’s broad shoulders, helping him up, leading him from his chair.
Draco flinched, realising he’d been staring for at least twenty seconds, and straightened, finally staring Potter determinedly in the eye. To his surprise, he was met with not aggression or annoyance, but humiliation. Hot embarrassment was thick in Potter’s gaze, and Draco frowned, feeling like he’d suddenly missed a step. He was filled with the urge to smooth that expression away, tilt those lips up and make his green eyes sparkle.
Hope you liked it! Not much going on, I know, but I swear after I finish the other fic - it's one of those all-consuming ones - I'll be right back on this. Please comment and tell me what you thought! Lots of love.
He looked between the other two boys, completely failing at nonchalance when he drawled, “So… you two been getting cosy over the summer? Don’t want to upset your boyfriend, Zabini?”
Would it always be like this? Potter filling up every cranny of his mind, arousing him and maddening him, utterly unreachable… forever?
Draco smirked. “Well, don’t give away my secret. The team’s pretty set on becoming best buddies with you guys.”
He realised he should probably say something, His mouth felt curiously dry as he opened it; he licked his lips and took a breath. “I- I won’t.”
His bladder twinged, and Harry’s nails bit further into the skin of his palms, which was used to it by now. He took a deep breath, releasing the clenching of his fists with some effort, and looked up, assuming a thin veneer of confidence and likeability.
. You guys might not even be compatible. And then,” Pansy’s fingers came up to grip his chin. “You. Move. On.”
One of Potter’s dark eyebrows flicked up so exquisitely delicately that Draco was painfully reminded of how gay Potter was. He remembered reading about it the year after the war. The Prophet had had a field day with it. God, would everything about this boy always make him feel so fucking twisted up in knots? There was a squirming, tight ball of genuine pain in the pit of his stomach. He was so bloody confused.
Pansy and Draco looked at each other for a second, nodded, and then pounced on him with elbows readied. It was a testament to how many times they had walked down that corridor that none of them bashed into the walls on their way out of the flat. However, entangled in a painful wrestling bundle, they did almost knock over an old lady coming up the stairs.
Granger was staring at him from across the classroom, one hand resting on the strap of her bag, the other drumming thoughtfully - and probably unconsciously - on her lower lip.
It felt fucking unbelievable. Harry was groaning, burying his face in Malfoy’s shoulder as the other man moved, and their skin was slippery with the sweat of it, dewing over and sliding as they grew hotter. Harry’s head was scrambled, and he was completely hard, his cock straining and jolts of pure pleasure straining up his spine as they rutted together. Harry could barely move except to meet Malfoy thrust for thrust, and he bit down on Malfoy’s pec in a gasp, ecstasy flashing through him, a honey- thick warmth flooding him, and he couldn’t do anything but chase the pleasure.
Malfoy bent his head closer so their lips were almost touching, breath ghosting across Harry’s lips as he felt his eyelids slide down in bliss, mouth parting unconsciously…
He glanced down at the boy in his arms, smirking hard, and reached his hand just a little further around his waist, pulling him in impossibly tight. Harry did not say a word. Draco pressed a hot breath into his hair, shifting as his fingers reached around, around—
“What d’you take me for, an idiot?” Pansy asked acidly, nose firmly stuck in the air. “’Course she didn’t.”
And Potter – damn him, Potter smirked, biting his delicious bottom lip until it was flushed and bright against his pale skin.
“Nah,” Harry agreed. “I only knew one thing about myself, n’ that was what I had to do about our good friend Tom Marvolo Riddle when I was old enough.”
“No! Remember that time at Theo Nott’s party last year when I drank a shit ton of vodka and was fine?”
Ron set the shimmery stuff down carefully on Harry’s bed, sprawling over it and giving Harry a gleeful look. “What about that shimmery silver crop top Neville got you for your birthday?” He snorted. “Honestly, you’d think you were a rent boy, the stuff he buys you.”
It was, however, futile. While Professor Mancie had her curly head down, writing something on a student’s work, Draco felt something light hit the back of his head. He turned; a hastily scrunched paper ball lay on the floor behind his chair. He looked up, and there was the ginger wonder, looking at him like a spoilt toddler about to poke a snail with a stick. Weasley had no idea what he was doing- Draco was tired, bored, and frustrated. The Weasel would be lucky if he escaped a Furnunculus Curse to the left eye.
“Okay, okay!” he yelped, hands in the air. “I’m sorry. But if you think about it, it’s a compliment—”
Because, God, their eyes were still locked, gazes tangled with this bizarre force that Draco couldn’t rip away from. There was something undeniable there something that made the sensitive insides of Draco’s skin tingle, waves of sensation strumming through him. Stringing him tense and tight.
Smooth, golden skin, planes of it, like so much unmarred silk. Potter’s shirt was buttoned almost obscenely low, toeing the line between inappropriate and just really goddamn hot, and  aforementioned skin was just… everywhere, dipping and pooling in shadows and there was the tiniest freckle that Draco really should not be able to see, Jesus…but Christ was he happy that he could. And now he was wondering if anyone else had seen that freckle. A red mist seeped in at the corners of his mind, making him grit his teeth. That freckle belonged to him. And so did the hollow of Potter’s throat, and the curls that just grazed his shirt collar, and the rest of his luscious skin, slipping out of reach under that accursed joke of a shirt. Part of Draco wanted to grab it and tear it off, maybe give it a shake for daring to obstruct his delicious view. But part of him was ferociously, terrifyingly glad that it was there, however half- heartedly, for that meant that nobody else-
“BECAUSE HARRY DIDN’T INVITE DRACO MALFOY TO SIT WITH US AT THE WORLD CUP FINAL,” Ron bellowed, face puce with exertion.
It would have been easy to just Vanish the oatmeal verbally, but Hermione’s hearing had become incredibly sharp with pregnancy; the Mediwizards said the baby inside her was fuelling not only her magic, but her human senses. She could hear whispers from a mile off, and they had no chance of muttering Vanishing spells without her hearing. It had taken weeks for Harry to master non- verbal magic; he’d never been great in school, and it was more difficult now he was older. Ron was in charge of the wandless stuff because it came more easily to him in his family home; there was a definite air of Weasley magic permeating the place, and he could draw on it without too much hassle. But the non- verbal spell was Harry’s responsibility, and he pressed his lips firmly together, flourishing his wand in a small, precise motion under the table.
And- Potter?" Draco said, feeling as though he had to get it out quickly or he'd die of the burning feeling that was snaking through his body at the sight of those eyes on him.
Shock. Shock at Potter’s response. Sure, he’d been suggestive. But to get a blush so very prettily rosy… well, Draco was extra Slytherin- sure he’d struck a chord somewhere.
And then Blaise Zabini slammed himself down opposite Draco, excessively groomed quiff slickly gleaming in the soft breakfasting light. Draco groaned internally, resting the sausage down on his plate. He looked at it wistfully for a moment, and then turned his attention to the seething boy sitting before him.
It suddenly looked ostentatious again, and Draco muffled a scream in his hands, mirroring a frustrated shriek that arose hellishly from down the hall at the exact same second.
“Don’t say it like that!” Pansy snapped suddenly, swallowing a huge mouthful so quickly it looked painful.
“Let me guess,” Draco said drily. “It has something to do with the weird dynamic between you two where you treat him like glass and he curbs your hard edges and it’s all sweet and romantic and inter- house unity.”
The light, curling smoke of four cauldronfuls of bubbling Wistful Draught permeated the dank air of the dungeon, and Draco was getting more and more lightheaded as it thickened. He desperately tried to stay focused, finger tracing the print of his textbook, but the smoke definitely had some of the potion’s properties, and the urge to slump to the floor and stare tearfully at the curve of Potter’s arse was almost becoming too much. Besides, it was becoming more and more difficult to ignore the dreadful fact he’d been trying to block out the whole lesson- he was paired with Weasley. What’s more, it was not just Weasley, but an increasingly fractious and hotblooded Weasley, who kept trying to dump the wrong things into the Draught before they were meant to.
“Fucking hell, is the Floo broken or something? It’s hot as fuck in there.” A high, familiar voice blared from the living room.
Harry grinned, and took Malfoy’s cock in his hands, licking over the base in broad, flat strokes until Malfoy groaned aloud.
Ginny carried on. “There was one girl who stared right back at me, and she made, like, the exact same expression, only I was in about fifth year, so I was still kind of skinny and had a messy ponytail and the remains of acne, but this girl was sixth year, and mature at that, so she was freaking gorgeous. The way she was quirking her eyebrow, just like me… it felt like she was taking the piss, but not really? I was so attracted to that. And I can still feel the way I swallowed, hard, and my tongue felt thick, and I couldn’t look away, especially from—and I couldn’t for the life of me explain why—her neck, which was exposed on one side ‘cause her hair was pushed to the right. And it was really slim, and pale, and I could see her delicate jawline, and the point where the fullness of her mouth pressed into the sharp curve of her cheek, and it was so lovely.” Ginny sounded dreamy, and even Ron wasn’t gagging or looking away. There was something mesmerising about the whole story.
Harry licked his lips nervously, bending forwards, and he was breathing hotly over the tip, gazing up at Malfoy through his lashes, waiting for a reaction.
Draco, unwilling to stay in Malfoy Manor, had rented a little apartment in London with a small fraction of the contents of the Malfoy vault, and tried to be normal for the few weeks that needed to expire before he could return to Hogwarts. One evening in the small dark bookstore he’d taken to haunting, that song had come on. He’d never paid any particular attention to the music playing before, but this song- it had arrested him where he was walking, running a finger over the worn spines of the books. He’d stayed frozen until the last notes faded, the thin flexible voice had died away. After that, he’d made the little old shopkeeper play it every time he came, at least once, until he knew each word by heart. Lost in thought, Draco remembered the smell of the old paper, wax and dust mites and sunshine dancing in the musty air to the sound of that unnamed Muggle singer, who had captured Draco more successfully than any magic had before. On an impulse, Draco seized his wand from where it was lying in a little nook on the shower wall, and, with careful intent, started to scratch words onto the shower wall. Scrawling black script, in his own Malfoy- taught cursive- the first two lines from the song.
Draco cleared his throat, unable to look upward into Potter’s eyes. The legs around the chair tightened imperceptibly as Potter shifted forwards, still wrapped suggestively around the bloody thing, and now Draco was fucking jealous of an inanimate object.
The sheer- shirted man sneered, and his blandly handsome face twisted into something ignorant and ugly. “Got that right.” He snatched up his coat from his chair and flung it dramatically over his shoulder, pivoting towards the staircase. Before he marched up to the ground floor, he turned for a parting shot, sticking out his arse in a way that was definitely on purpose and flagrantly unattractive.
He thought he would have come there pretty quickly, hips held possessively by Malfoy’s large, insistent hands, shirt sliding up to bare skin that Draco was looking at like he wanted to lick it up. But just as Harry opened his lips on a desperate moan, caught up in Draco’s lips, the other man pulled back.
“He died,” Harry explained, feeling a twinge at his heart despite the start Kreacher and the Order had gotten off to.
“Because we all want to know, Harry. You’ve never told us this,” Hermione said sternly, and Harry couldn’t resist that voice, he’d spent years learning to
They looked back at him. Pansy swallowed, and gave a hesitant nod. Her lips twitched upwards. Blaise, beside her, was openly suppressing laughter. Draco lost all composure, and gave him the finger, eyes immediately tracking back to the lone, dark- haired figure at the nearby table.
There was a general flurry around the classroom full of students, all of whom were staring at Draco, as Professor Flitwick came briskly into the room, levitating a tottering pile of NEWT level Charms textbooks. When he saw Draco reeling in his seat, the pile came crashing to the floor. Flitwick ran to him, bending over to feel his face and lifting his wrist to listen to his pulse. Draco could hear blood throbbing weakly in his ears- out of the corner of his darkening vision he made out Zabini, scowling down at the whole scene. Flitwick, small wand raised, muttered a short incantation, twirling his wand and passing it over Draco’s forehead. Miraculously, the agony behind his eyes lessened hugely, and Draco gasped, left with a faint sense of itchiness in the region of his eyelids.
But Draco could have sobbed for joy. He walked quickly over to his best friend without saying a word, and wrapped her in a hug, pressing his face desperately into the familiar curls of her hair. She smelled strangely of boy’s deodorant and cologne, but underneath that was sandalwood and clean teenage girl. It was indubitably her and Draco felt the aching gap in him where she’d once resided fill up effortlessly. He breathed easier.
"I'm sorry. For-- before. In the broom cupboard, with Finnigan. The things I said... I was drunk. And stupid. I didn't mean-- I didn't mean any of it."
Draco exhaled. “Pansy. Darling. That sentence was not even slightly understandable by anyone untrained in the lingo of the chronically mad. Speak. Fucking. Sense.”
“I just… after it being the three of us for so long, isolated from everyone, I think I got used to that. Not… in a weird way. Just. They did too. I couldn’t break the habit, and to be honest we didn’t need to. The Burrow’s got a lot of rooms, for all it’s not massive.” He shrugged. “We like it.”
Pansy cast him a faintly disgusted look, sliding the brassy tureen of rice towards him with a delicate hand. Her chopsticks were balanced impeccably between two fingers, roughly rounded nails grazing the slim wooden sticks.
The Headmistress’s expression was slightly softened as she spoke to Draco. He felt the change in her tone like a shock down his spine; unexpected and not altogether dislikeable.
! Whether they knew better at age eleven or not, they still fucking joined Voldemort in the end, didn’t they? They let Muggle- borns be tortured and killed by their own parents, and didn’t do a thing. They—” Ron choked off a sob, voice rising uncontrollably. “They
He shook hastily, pulling his hand away as fast as he could and breaking their stare. With a quick nod, a tight smile, he turned away and started to walk back to the Slytherin table. His heart raced beneath his robes in a way that was entirely unreasonable. As he strode away, Potter called after him.
“So, sixth year. We were in DADA. Ron, you’d been paired with ‘Mione, and we were doing Confundus Charms, remember?”
Draco strode out of the classroom, brushing past Finch- Fletchley, who was stumbling around in a drunken stupor, fourth Lucidity Charm apparently too weak. He did not look back, not when Professor Flitwick called after him, not when the door slammed, and not when vicious green eyes burned in his memory.
“Well, it could have been an accident… a sparking of magic in a particular moment of emotion or…” Professor Flitwick trailed off, sounding dubious. Draco appreciated his attempt at ignorance. It was obvious; someone had cursed the ex- Death Eater in the hopes he’d bloody well drop dead or at the very least fuck off back to his London flat. Draco was unsurprised. Actually, it was a wonder he didn’t get more of this.
Potter grinned at him, a lazy grin that split his face open even as Draco stared at him, incredulous.
“Okay. I’m going to pretend you’re not acting like a child, and invite you in. I didn’t know you’d been here with—”
Harry shrugged, and Malfoy looked at him, really looked at him, gaze sliding over Harry’s body in that particular way that made him shiver. He came towards him, still staring, and slowly, never breaking his gaze, he knelt.
“Look, Nott, I’m not telling you shit! We’ve hung out a bit this term, but frankly we barely spoke before that. I don’t know you that well, and for you to just demand things of me, pin me to a wall, and fucking—”
Draco looked down at them, shaking his head. But he couldn’t tamp down on the fond smirk tugging his lips wide.
He looked up, and Draco sucked in a breath, clenching his stomach not to just come at the sight. Potter… his cheeks were flushed, schoolboy- flushed, and the green of his eyes was glossy with a desire that unfurled a thick, hot tendril in the pit of Draco’s stomach. His lips were redder than ever, bitten and slicked by a tongue that Draco could just barely make out, lips parted sweetly as they were. He wanted to lick deep into that mouth, stroke that dark hair back and bite that lip, tease it out between his teeth. He wanted to wreck him, muss up the beautiful glaze that was Harry Potter and make him shake, moan his name over and over in that fucking infuriatingly rough baritone.
Draco thought with relish-- looking sullenly at Granger, who was engaged in lively conversation with a brown- haired Ravenclaw who Draco was pretty sure was called Bookly. Finn Bookly. No wonder Granger was so interested in him.
Together, they ascended the set of stone steps to the entrance of the restaurant, pushing open the glass door and stepping into a large, darkly lit space divided up by jagged wooden walls set at crazy intervals throughout, creating little divots and spaces for tables to go. The effect was similar to that of a high- fashion maze, confusing but beautiful. A woman dressed in traditional Japanese garb stepped up to them, eyes thickly lined with kohl and face palely made up. A Squib. They tended to work in these kinds of jobs, where Muggles and wizards mixed in society, guiding each of them to where others of their kind were.
“Help me! These two,” he shot Ron and Hermione, who were clutching their sides from laughter by now, a filthy look. “Are useless. What shirt shall I wear?”
It was kind of incredible, actually. He felt like just asking Potter if he could wait just a minute, so he could step away and maybe have a mediwizard confirm what he knew but couldn’t quite believe—that his pulse was racing faster than the time Blaise had found a baby Hippogriff crouched in Draco’s walk- in wardrobe.
But what? But nothing. The ‘but’ was meant to convey that it was alright, really, but it manifestly was not alright. Nobody had forgiven him, and he had not moved on.
Pansy made to skip away, humming to herself, when Draco croaked, “Wait. Wait! We’re sorry. Aren’t we, Blaise?”
on his left forearm, sinuous black ink threading with his veins, marring the soft skin. A part of him, one that would never scrub off.
“Oh yes,” Hermione said, sweeping a critical eye over the plum shirt. Harry had pushed the sleeves up, left a couple of buttons undone, and he was wearing his tightest black Muggle skinny jeans.
Draco picked up his wand from the nook where he’d put it, and stepped up to the wall again, wet fingers set in that peculiar grip on his wand handle that burned black lines into the glistening tiles. Carefully, heart pounding, he scratched another line.
“Don’t rub that in my face! The stupid wand didn’t know what it wanted—probably just felt like practicing some of the more basic spells for a change.” He stepped closer to Potter, hands still deep in his pockets. “Some of us have a more diverse range than just Expelliarmus, you see.”
“You see, Malfoy, normally when a person turns a corner they don’t need to check if someone else is coming, just so long as that someone else isn’t sprinting like they have a Firebolt up their arse. If everyone is travelling at a normal speed, collisions like this are virtually impossible. You don’t need a magical eye that can see through walls and look ahead—” Potter broke off, looking away from Draco.
After the passageway, he couldn’t see further into the recesses of the restaurant, but he assumed there’d be a corridor with the witches’ toilets at one end and the wizards’ at the other. Other magical species would be somewhere in the middle. Harry fought down a burst of anxiousness. Which way would he have to go? Right or left? His belly twinged.
But it seemed he could not. Potter, with an exasperated glance at Granger’s fussing, walked up to Weasley and wordlessly began helping him repack his bag, which had now been emptied of its contents entirely and was ready for a more strategic filling. Their heads were bent together as they murmured, just like in Muggle Studies, except now Draco was curious. He hooked his thumbs over the edges of his pockets and stood casually, cocking a hip to push his ear a fraction closer to their conversation, and listened in.
Draco thought infuriatedly--  that, even though it was angry, made Draco’s eyebrows flick together for a second, his breath to still, before he got a grip.
The squib sashayed away, pen and pad clasped tightly between two pale, red- tipped fingers. As she set the menus down on a podium near the bottom of the stairs, she tossed a coy glance over her shoulder at Blaise, lips arranged in a sultry pout, and then turned away, bare feet silent as she padded back up the stairs.
They separated, and Ron cleared his throat, sinking back down onto the sofa. Hermione wrapped an arm around him, and Ginny sprawled over the loveseat, head in Harry’s lap.
Pansy sniggered. “Why would he be? Blaise here has always been a sucker for a pretty face.” She flicked her hair and preened, fluttering her-- Draco had to admit, fairly lush-- eyelashes.
In hindsight, it was a really stupid idea. All either boy needed to do was take out their wand and Summon them. But that silver World Cup logo drove the logic right out of their brains.
“I just think,” Pansy said, waving her spoon around wildly, “people shouldn’t underestimate female players so much! Yeah, they can’t pass the Quaffle as hard but,” she swallowed a mouthful of cornflakes, “they’re a lot more, like, deft. Skilful. They need to be, to get onto the teams, or even have a chance. I tell you, the sexism in the industry is unbelievable.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. He looked around at Blaise, eyes unconvincingly offended. “Wha—you think that’s—you think I--? I don’t
A particularly loud laugh of Granger’s, prompted undoubtedly by Bookly, who was blushing fiercely, made Weasley emit a sort of wounded noise that sounded a bit like a pained Kneazle.
Ron slackened against the sofa. “It’s only that-- well, we spent years insulting the git. He spent years making your life hell.”
Malfoy looked at Harry through his eyelashes, and the seam of his lips was still parted slightly, like he hadn’t recovered yet, like Harry wasn’t letting him.
