“He didn’t have much good to say about your father, though,” Blaise muttered.
“Oh, I guess. But it isn’t all bad. You’re just cranky lately. I really think you need a good shag to get everything out of your system.”
Potter turned towards him with a start—it was the first time he had ever addressed the group of students as a whole during one of these sessions. He continued: “It’s going to take longer at first. You need to clear your mind. And then repeat the spell to yourself—nonverbally, obviously. You have to envision it. In your mind,
They sat in silence, Draco cursing himself for being so stupid. Proudfoot looked off into the distance, apparently unbothered. Finally, he pushed himself off the cold ground. “I’m headed back inside. From what little I know of your father, Mr. Malfoy, he’s quite resourceful—I wouldn’t count him out just yet. In the meantime, you need to worry about yourself. Keep up your grades. Make an effort with these study groups—if you can save your reputation a bit, it’ll help you down the line. They’re only your classmates now, but someday they’ll be out there working, and it’s always good to be able to call in favours."
“Theo, are you bringing Lavender to the Christmas dinner? At Blaise’s?” Pansy demanded.
“Why are you lying to me?” she demanded. Their eyes briefly met—she was glowering at him, mouth twisted in fury.
There was a tense silence as they all stared at him. Greg looked up at her from his untouched bowl—
“It wasn’t a
Everything hurt. He felt as though his very bones were bruised. “Why? Is that what came up?”
“I didn’t know,” Harry said. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.”
“Yeah.” Draco winced as he felt the by-now familiar press of Potter’s wand against his skin. “Three…two…one…”
As Daphne finally paid for her quill, Pansy said, “I can’t take the cold anymore. Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks to warm up and then head back.”
-o-o-
Ron shook his head, “But Malfoy said she couldn’t have been-”
“It’s probably not even the weapon itself.” Draco said, “Just information. It’s technically my job to collect it anyway. I knew my father’s been planning something like this for a while now. It was bound to lead to this.”
“T...Two days ago...” Harry then remembered that for the past two detentions, Umbridge hadn’t asked to check his hand at the end of the night. She hadn’t had the chance to see that they’d not been healing over completely.
Harry shook his head, telling himself it wasn't allowed to seriously hex fellow students.
"Hero worship doesn't count, golden boy." He tapped Harry on the nose once. "Not like you'll get any of it anymore, though. You have Rita Skeeter to thank for that. If someone actually likes you this year, keep them close, Harry. It really is
"Regardless, Draco. I've decided I won't give word of this to you mother and father, although I am sure you can imagine if they knew."
"I…" Harry looked up at the ceiling, letting his head rest on the back of the chair. "I think it was the right decision. I even said it to him back when we did it. For some reason, I don't regret it."
"I've never heard of it before." Draco said thoughtfully. He hoped he wasn't asking too many questions, but one thing his father encouraged in all of this (what
"Well? Don't just stand there. Come inside."
of how much red could fit on a single person. Potter, Draco realised, was rather poorly caught in the crossfires of their argument. He stood helplessly as he watched Weasley and Granger have their little spat, fists clenched at his sides.
"Oh dear Potty, you're using big words again! Maybe little Harry should go to bed!" Draco cooed sickly. Harry glared at him, but his eyes were alight with humour anyway.
“Ow! Prat!” Harry hissed. Draco ignored him, eyes roving over the desk hungrily. It was undercover work, that’s it. His curiosity was sound… It was for the Order…
“Occurrences?” Umbridge asked.
"Harry." Dumbledore said, "Can you walk?"
Draco shrugged. "It made me angry, the way they were discussing you. It's like you were just a name thrown around, not an actual person next door. Don't you think you deserve to know anything that concerns you? Especially after what happened?"
The woman shifted her eyes between them before supposedly deciding she didn’t care. With a sigh, she looked down and continued writing nonsense on her paper. “You’re on the wrong floor. Go down one more - that’s floor seven - and you’ll find him at the very end to the left.”
His father nodded, "I'm not sure of the schematics, but Severus is handy with that sort of thing. I use many of his spells both because they are generally lesser known and often times-" He smiled cruelly, "-very dark magic."
"Okay," Harry  said, "So if you were to give an estimate, how much time do we have?"
So, Draco settled in to make notes, making sure to take his time organising his materials in hopes that it might save him some time being bored out of his bloody mind. Pansy next to him was doodling something vulgar on to one of the textbook illustrations and Blaise seemed to be staring at his parchment in a way that almost made Draco check to see if he was even awake.
Draco watched her go with wide eyes, all but a bit scared. Potter chuckled next to him when he saw his face, but stopped and cleared his throat when Draco glared at him. Weasley was staring after Granger in defeat. He slowly got up and walked to a Ravenclaw girl in silence, leaving Draco and Potter alone together again that night.
He groaned internally. Or was it out loud?
Draco sighed, not bothering to open his eyes.
"Damn right, Harry.' Ron said with a pained grin, "Bloody hell…always something with you, isn't it?" Harry smiled weakly and looked back at the fire, both of them looking suspiciously docile and strange if someone were to walk in on them sitting by the fire in silence.
Harry shot him a dark look that stopped him mid-sentence, and he closed his mouth with a huff.
"Thank you." Draco said politely, getting up with his head swirling for the surrealness of it all. He went back to his seat, Ginevra stepping away once he'd returned with another polite smile.
“That was hardly violent.” Draco crossed his arms with a huff, “You’re an idiot. You’ve
“But what does the Hat want?” Harry said thoughtfully through a mouthful of toast. “Not like we can just frolic with the Slytherins and make everything better.”
"Wait, you don't…you know, agree with everything your father says?" Harry said, turning to Malfoy quite confused and deciding not to pursue the dickhead comment for the time being.
it's always better to have more minds put together. Besides, if I need information from you, you can't really refuse, can you?" Harry said triumphantly.
Draco lolled his head back to face the ceiling, thinking about it for a moment. “Hm, that’s actually not unhelpful.”
He settled in to eat, blocking out the murmurings of his house around him. It worked for a while, before the voice of the very bane of his existence (besides Potter) began to speak.
"I don't
"Where's…"
"Dad and Percy rowed." Ronald said, "Even at the mention, Dad breaks whatever's he's holding and Mum starts crying."
Harry's head whipped quickly to Draco, whom was flushing slightly and looking away from him to the Lake. Harry sagged a little, not quite knowing what to say but understanding nonetheless.
"What? Don't you two know wand jokes?" He asked in disbelief. Harry and Hermione turned away from Ron and Harry continued.
"Do you really not know who she's going with?" Ron asked earnestly. Harry silently nodded, shaking the whole chair as he did. He looked at the clock on the wall, seeing they had two hours until the Ball. Why were people already getting ready?
“Merlin, I thought she was going to pounce at me across the desk.” Draco crossed his arms over himself defensively with a shiver.
The Slytherin was wearing form fitting white robes with dark green satin linings on the hems. It looked as if he had been standing there a while, and the other champions and their dates were looking at him rather suspiciously for loitering outside the Hall like that. Harry only nodded at him and scurried to the line, trying his best to breathe properly. He caught Professor McGonagall's eye as she formed the line and he saw her mouth thin in to a small line when she saw Malfoy.
, Potter." He said venomously through a dazzling smile. Harry certainly tried his best, and once they reached the empty spot on the floor, the delicate music started and all the couples started to dance.
“Just let me say one thing,” Harry said, breathing heavily. He leant over the desk, fingers splayed out on the surface and Umbridge seemed to cower away slightly. “Just like how I’m minding my business about the Ministry, the Ministry should mind its business about
"What do you mean?" Blaise asked curiously.
"Tea?" He asked, gathering the cleanest cups he could find from the cupboards.
Harry crushed his new set of ingredients, adding them to the cauldron base. "I'm surprised you're being so calm about it. I thought you'd be angry. Might have even killed either of us." Harry said after a moment.
Draco looked up in disbelief, "What? Why not?"
walks?”
“Is this another Potter thing?”
"A truce?" Ron asked incredulously, and Harry saw Hermione looking at him curiously.
Umbridge eyes fluttered in a panic, “Mr Potter, I don’t know where you’re getting this information-”
"Come again?"
"For Merlin's sake! I don't have time to deal with you lot. Ron. Grow up. Harry? We'll talk
His Godfather's face immediately surfaced in the coals, and Draco had never been so glad to see the man's sour face before. He crouched in front of the fireplace, ignoring the twinge of pain in his bad knee.
- I almost agreed with some, if not most of what he said."
Draco smirked, "You do look weird."
"Mind my hearing? Of course. Its bloody tomorrow and I have no idea what I'll do-"
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —”
Draco shrugged. "I told them everything I knew. About this past summer and such, then they started discussing you. About the events leading to your leaving your relative's house. How you have a court hearing soon and how they might go about getting you acquitted. Useful stuff if you were even there."
Draco skipped ahead, eyes skimming the page before he turned it over to reveal a tall diagram, starting from a single name at the top of the page and connecting to many others with small black lines, increasing as they went down each row.
thanks for reading, as always.
"Right. Well that's rather morbid." Malfoy remarked, "But what we have to focus on is how you're going to survive underwater for an hour."
"Diggory and Potter….Start!"
"Gillyweed." Malfoy said again.
They parried spells a little more, and Draco managed to keep himself on his feet most of the time, having been knocked over several times before for the last hour. His body was already aching and he knew he'd bruise badly tomorrow, but he couldn't concede in any way yet. It would've been useless if he did anyway.
"I know." Draco said, his voice flat and void of emotion.
"Which also means sacrificing some." added Sirius.
"It'll be over soon." Arthur said reassuringly, "You'll be cleared in no time." The man turned to his wife, "Heard they got Amelia on the case, luckily for us."
After dinner that day, Harry made his way to the Lake in case he might catch Malfoy there. He made his way under the willow tree and saw that he was in luck.
"What on earth could you be sorry for?" Malfoy asked, and it took Harry back to a night some time ago when they had apologised to each other back and forth, as if it could explain why they kept coming back to the same spot. Malfoy was turned to him, a look almost like worry in his eyes.
The boy instead quirked an eyebrow curiously at Harry, "What could you be sorry for?" He asked genuinely, like he didn't believe Harry could be any such thing.
"No way!" Harry exclaimed, clapping Ron on the back.
He glanced over at Harry, who was staring apprehensively at McGonagall with his knee bouncing up and down. Sighing, Draco looked away. Harry obviously couldn’t seem to unwind from how strung up he was.
They stood in front of a dreary row of houses, all desolate and pressed closely together on the lane of a muggle street in London. Draco's stomach churned uneasily from the press of Apparition just moments before. He let go of Professor Snape's arm as soon as they landed, and Snape started towards the houses without a word.
"I didn't want anyone to see." Draco answered sheepishly, a hint of red blooming on his cheeks.
"I'm serious, Harry. He said that the D- You-Know-Who was getting stronger. It's not a good sign." He fiddled with his wand between his fingers nervously, an act that would've put Harry on edge if it were months before. "Not a good sign at all."
"Draco Malfoy, Mrs. Weasley." Harry spoke before he could, then turned to address Weasley and Granger, "He saved my life last night."
He entered the Hall with a flurry of other students, making a beeline for Pansy and a brooding Blaise. Draco hoped he'd calmed down already, he felt to wound up to deal with the boy's wounded temper at the moment.
Harry muses to himself about how horrible ('cruel and unforgiving') Umbridge is. He then has an epiphany right as he is about to leave the room, that Umbridge must to some extent believe Voldemort and/or his followers have risen again. With this, he spontaneously carries his own plan out by giving out hinting remarks and acting all smug and shit, speaking in a manner as if he himself was Voldemort and/or one of his followers.
Moody was making his way through the grass pathways, head turning occasionally.
“Were you now.” Harry replied monotonously, reaching for a slice of toast and half-listening as Hermione went on an in-depth analysis of each line of the song.
He took a sudden deep, shuddering breath.
Harry doodled a bit on a hangman drawing from a previous round, thinking for a moment. “She was with Cedric…” He muttered. “Bit weird now, innit?”
"Ah, shi-"
Harry and Ron carefully avoided making eye contact as Hermione went on a tangent about the schematics of the Sorting Hat’s power (with Ron mercifully making the right noises at the right times to indicate they were listening). Soon, their focus was turned to the arrival of the post (“Just keeping an eye on the enemy.” Hermione had said when Harry glared at a copy of the Daily Prophet that had arrived for her) and their schedules finally being handed out to them.
"I don't have time to explain it." Draco said, not caring if he sounded desperate and pleading, "But something's not right. Please just believe me."
Draco watched his two friends emotionlessly, waiting for them to finish. When they had eventually managed to die down and Draco was sure nothing would set them off again, he asked evenly, “So you think Umbridge was antsy because of Potter?”
"Well then you should think about that before you go traipsing with foreign students at night, you pillock!" Draco exclaimed.
"Oh…I didn't know that." Draco said. "How come nobody talks about it?"
Umbridge looked up from her work briefly when he opened the door then her eyes shot back down to her work quickly.
"I'll never get used to that." Ron muttered next to him.
Harry led him to the other end of the table where Sirius was sat with an empty chair next to him. Harry sat on the other side and Draco sat across him. There was a selection of food laid out on the table, and Draco's mouth watered despite the nausea he'd felt just moments prior.
“What’s going on?”
“She’s with Mill and the others. Crabbe and Goyle, too. Hey...Maybe you should talk to them-”
“A secondary one. Something completely other. Something distinctly un-Harry.”
Something flickered over Sirius's face as he heard Harry, and his gaze softened just a bit. He rubbed his hands over his eyes tiredly, sighing deeply.
So now there he was, hiding in the terribly kept flower beds underneath his relative's open window and listening to the news on their telly as it sifted through. Harry found it was a remarkable step-up from locking himself in his room, except now he was knee deep in dirt that he knew his Aunt Petunia would probably give him a bollocking for later.
Umbridge leant back in her seat at her desk, as if stunned that Hermione had the nerve to even utter the words she’d said.
Draco just smiled at him smugly. "I have my admirers."
. Draco felt his jaw click from how hard he grinded his teeth together.
"We need to talk." Malfoy said, wasting time by adjusting the placings of the vials and jars. Harry dropped a pair of tongs, hearing Snape mutter irritably behind him. Harry bent to pick it up and put it back, leaning in closer to Malfoy. Barely moving his lips, Harry said, "When are you free."
-o-o-
with posters of women in varying degrees of undress, as well as some muggle transport he'd forgotten the name of.
But it came suddenly, the realisation that Draco was still there. It was like he'd been obliviated of the boy's existence for the last fortnight, but all of a sudden the fact gave him the littlest energy to get out of his room for a bit. It was just the smallest ray of light to know he had someone else.
Neither spoke for a while after that, to which Harry was grateful as the throbbing pain finally receded. It felt as if his facial muscles were finally relaxing, and in turn made way for a heavy fatigue to wash over him. He closed his eyes, and his breathing barely evened out when Draco spoke.
No, that wasn't it. He wasn't jealous of Draco's situation exactly, but perhaps rather that Draco was training so hard everyday while Harry sat on his arse and did nothing.
Ron and Hermione flinched.
“You were bleeding, mate.” Ron cut him off, “You were busy.”
"And now he's traipsing in the Ministry like a guilty man walking free?" Draco asked understandingly. Harry nodded gravely, and Draco got up to sit facing Harry. "It’s something I think about a lot. He just…got away with it. Imagine the people that knew the truth. Imagine how it must have felt after Voldemort died and he was still walking free…"
, Ron wrote on the parchment, and Harry nodded as he started drawing a new picture.
Draco shook his head, “Even so, my father would definitely get those files before that happened.”
"You will go back in to that room," Vernon growled, grabbing Harry by the collar of his jumper and lifting him until he was balancing on the balls of his feet, "Or so help me, I will
“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge sweetly. “Off you go.”
"Yes!" Harry threw a fist in to the air, spinning around to see Draco and his face immediately contorting in to that of horror. "Draco, the eggs!"
Just when he felt his eyes flutter closed, was of course the time Harry came rumbling over.
Unfortunately, the day passed quickly and Harry’s nausea never let up. He’d never hated himself more, apart from the time after Cedric’s death. Throughout the day, he would be struck with the momentary incredulous realisations that
back home. These were real people and not useless pieces in chess you could rid of to make up your perfect ideal reality. I don't want to be that person. Maybe I don't even want to be my father." He stopped talking abruptly, his voice cracking at the end of his sentence. Harry gave him some time, not filling the silence between them while knowing it must have been difficult for the boy to speak so much. He let Malfoy's words sink in to him and simmer in his mind.
"What I'm about to say," he said, "never leaves this room. Understand, kids?"
"No." He just said again.
"Draco?" Granger said after a moment, shocked. Ronald stood next to her with his mouth agape, graceful as always.
"It was just Viktor!"
"Did you know?" Ron all but yelled.
"Me? What about you?" Harry exclaimed, "You actually think I'll die!"
"Er, right. I'll just be outside while you guys…" He trailed off and looked at the woman next to him. "Care to join me, Mrs. Weasley? I'm sure you have many lovely stories about Ronald here." The boy blanched as Draco sauntered out, Mrs. Weasley following behind.
"Severus will be here with the Veritaserum soon, everyone."
Harry smiled victoriously, looking at Malfoy's tightly held features as if the words were painful.
Ron flushed. “I — well,” Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. “I thought I’d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom.”
Draco's body flooded with fear. Could he run? Hide? Shit. Why did he leave the Invisibility Cloak in the corner…
"What are you lot dawdling for?" His father burst out of the room, walking at top speed. "We'll be late!"
“Ready?” Draco asked after a moment.
i don't ever really set out to slander Dumbledore, but it just ends up happening (apologies!). Most of the negative views against him are from Draco directly or his point of view, which don't necessarily imply Dumbledore is the big bad guy in this story, but do just highlight the flaws of his character specifically. I remember Harry being particularly resentful of Dumbledore around this part of the ootp as well, so it all comes together in the end.
“Alright, alright.” Harry chuckled, taking Draco’s finger on his chest and steering it away gently. “You excited, though?”
"Go on! Are my parents not dead?" Harry urges with fake congeniality. Malfoy nods slightly, looking confused. "They are." He said.
Then he realised that they were silent sobs wracking through his body, that were automatically restrained as much as possible and pulled in to his chest. He didn't make any sound. Anybody passing by would have thought he was laughing like a lunatic, not crying like he was a little boy in his cupboard again.
"Moony's arriving today." Sirius said, looking at Harry with bright eyes.
"You own Grimmauld Place?" Harry asked, pulling himself to stand and brushing off his jeans.
"Don't woman
"And I…" The boy said. Draco's heart sped up.
"Padfoot!" A female voice said. Draco blanched and looked at Harry, stricken with fear. The boy looked back, but Merlin he was
Draco reached out to put a hand on his shoulder, turning him around. "Don't worry, okay?" He said softly. "You'll be fine."
“Yes!” Hermione said. “Good on you.”
It was a moment before he felt Harry's heaving chest, and heard the small sobs coming from the boy. He immediately tightened his grasp on the boy, voicing soothing hushed sounds to him every so often.
He thought again,
"Had to, Harry." Draco admitted with a knowing look.
Malfoy seemed taken aback by what Harry said. He slumped to the ground, his white robes forgotten. He looked out at the Lake, then back at Harry.
group me in with the likes of
Harry's earlier confidence completely flew out the window, and he tried not to look too much like he had gastrointestinal issues as Hermione's gaze bore in to him.
By Harry fucking Potter.
." He grabbed the letter out of the air and chucked in to the bin, shaking his head.
"It's worth the risk. Major meeting they're having down there. Must be why Malfoy's here."
"Something he didn't have last time." Draco said to himself, index finger tapping rhythmically on his lips as he thought. "An edge. What is it he fears most that would stop his uprising?"
"SHUT IT!" Draco yelled, immediately spelling Harry in to silence. He took several steps forwards to where Harry was panting in place and his eyes were shining like fire. As he got closer, he realised he was beginning to look down at Harry - he'd overtaken him in height over the last month. He stopped in front of the other boy, looking down, and said angrily, "You're probably too angry to realise it right now, but just remember that you were the only one who saw Voldemort come back. It was just you that night, the rest being a bunch of Death Eaters. You don't have evidence, and the only thing anyone has to go on is your word for the moment. Despite all of this, the Order has reconvened, and all these people are here despite never seeing him come back. Do you know why?"
," Potter said with a quick glare at Draco, "That someone
His father turned to him, "It was a
“Wh-? That’s not it!” Draco interrupted quickly. “There are so many things wrong with that-”
Moody disappeared behind one of the hedges, but he was very close to the center. Why would Moody be there? Was someone else attacking? Were they hiding in the maze?
"But I can't help it." Draco said, "How could I not worry?"
“Oh, it’s quite exciting, really,” Lancaster said. “Only recently did we construct a new way of sifting through our collection in a way that would help visitors.”
Not having time to cast another, he jumped and rolled to the side. He came up on to his knees in time to block another purple hex that smelled like burnt toast. His eyes lost the spot on his father's robes so he cast quick hex that was meant to cause boils to spread over his father's skin. It was blocked easily, but he took the quick moment to find another spot to focus on.
"Well, I figured, but I didn't believe you two could do it." She said curtly.
It wasn’t Witherby, but it was bloody close. Merlin, it was bloody close.
"Oh." Draco said. He really had forgotten about his end of year exams after the way the year ended. They'd gone well enough for him, but all he could remember was worrying about Harry the whole time.
Draco wasn’t surprised by the question. They were in the generally Slytherin side of the train, and the compartment also had children of other Slytherin-lineaged families inside. Most of the time, Slytherin families knew each other, so children often already knew each other as well. That was a relief at least, as he didn’t want to play matchmaker on top of telling them to
Harry’s eyes widened for a second. “Oh, alright then.” He turned to walk out the class, following behind Draco. “Yeah, got it.”
“And they are.” Hermione said quickly, and Draco heard the intelligent lilt to her tone that she always used in class when in a passionate debate about something. “But the aims only cover areas such as understanding, recognising and contextualising the uses of defensive magic. There doesn’t seem to be any aim to do with our abilities to
He knew the Potions Professor would have tracked him down eventually, so he decided to save the man the trouble. Normally Draco wouldn't be so averse to seeing Snape, but since it was about him and Potter, Draco was considering throwing himself out in to the Lake just to avoid it.
“Come in!” Umbridge’s voice sounded, her voice much more lively than the day before. Harry took a deep breath, steeling himself, and walked in.
"Come on." Harry grabbed him by the arm, bringing him forward. Draco stepped hesitantly, but Harry's grip was strong.
" Moody whispered, and Draco's vision fell through as he became a creature of pain and heat, awareness of who he was replaced by lava through his veins and hot needles under his skin.
“First Years!” Pansy bellowed across the table, “Slytherin First Years, this way, please!”
" She demanded scathingly and Harry winced again.
He thought he saw Sirius and Remus exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can only get by stealth.”
"Alright." He said. It wasn't really like he had a choice anyway. He mostly just wanted to make a fuss if anything.
"Yes, sir." He said. "Until death."
Umbridge stared up at him in shock, eyes flicking from his hand, dripping blood onto the floor, to where he was clutching over his scar. Something flashed when she saw the source of his pain.
Harry used a hand to squeeze her arm in response, realising the strange look in Hermione's eyes was unbridled worry, as if she couldn't quite assure herself that Harry was really there. He then realised that at some point in the last two days, she may have feared the opposite for a while. That he may have not come back at all.
” Umbridge replied through that gritted, toothy smile. “The Ministry itself can guarantee that you are under no circumstance in any danger at all by any Dark Wizard! If you have any concerns, Mr. Potter - or anyone else in this room -, you may come to me privately and we can discuss it! In fact, we may just have enough time during your detention tomorrow!”
"Oh." Hermione said, and Harry looked up to see tears rolling down her face. His heart panged and he immediately got up to kneel in front of her, looking up in to her shining brown eyes.
.” Harry was trembling. “By Voldemort himself.”
They reached the secluded point, then he automatically took his mothers offered arm to apparate. With a tight pop in his gut, they were immediately in front of his home, Malfoy Manor. It stood as tall as always, black marble ingesting the sun setting behind it. It was a dreadfully dreary place, he knew that. If he didn't know any better it could have just screamed
going to be there was interrupted by Mrs. Weasley opening the door.
"And then what did he say?" Hermione asked.
Umbridge gestured to a chair on the other side of her desk, where there was a blank parchment on top of it. “Sit.”
his broom for the task.
"Draco?" He asked worriedly. Draco shook him off, not peeling his eyes away from the empty seat in the stands.
"So my mother lived here?" Draco asked the man.
Harry turned around triumphantly, looking to share his great joke with someone who understood fine humour, only to see none other than the last person he possibly wanted to share this moment with.
"Dumbledore called for me. Says this place is for an Order?"
"He already did." Potter said. Draco's head whipped to his in turn, making contact with Potter's eyes fully for the first time that morning.
Draco scoffed on instinct, shooting Harry a scowl. Harry only grinned and Draco looked away, whistling sharply to call out his Owl, Athena. A large, dark bird came swooping from the vaulted ceiling, coming to land on his offered arm. In the background, he could hear Harry and Chang discussing something.
conclusions, which by the way Potter would
"Fine. Stay standing, then"
"My father had her tutor me when I was younger - preliminary education before Hogwarts and all that." He sighed again, looking up. "She was meant to teach me Muggle's Studies - more like an ambassadorial version of the subject, should I need to deal with them in the future. Of course, that just translated to her slander of them as a whole. She was extremely adamant I knew that muggles were lesser than us, and that muggle-borns were rather just mistakes on their part. That woman…" Draco paused, lost in memories of her pinched face and malicious gaze. The ruler she always slapped in one palm as she spoke. She couldn't technically touch him, but the sound alone kept his head down. "I can't think of anyone worse to be teaching children at all, let alone muggleborns and half-bloods."
"Just a little. Now eat." Draco got off the bed and stretched. He yawned, and realised the room was too silent. He looked around, and- shit. Everyone had been watching. Weasley's eyes were wide and Granger just stared.
"Sure." He bit out, and Harry knew Hermione must have been intervened on his opinions somehow. Harry was surprised he wasn't blowing up the entire castle as he'd expected him to. Ever since their fight before the first task, Harry noticed Ron's temper had quelled a lot more.
Draco blanched, not unlike the old woman had done, Harry thought.
"What? Yeah I did Why?" He asked confusedly, looking up and catching Parvati's eye as well and looking quickly back down at his chopping.  "I guess she's still mad." He muttered, and Harry pretended to stir the potion some more to make himself look busy. He slowly turned around to Parvati again and mouthed a sincere '
"It was." Draco said, "He was your Godfather and he…betrayed your parents to…"
"Mum made us swear to be nice and all that." George said, " 'sides, we heard about the Tournament. Mostly everyone was told that you'd be here and why."
"Uh - What?" Harry asked incredulously at seeing her expression, "What do you think we did?"
His father disappeared in to a room nearby, as if unaware that Draco were about to depart to King's Cross an they were about to be horrendously late. Draco knew he knew, but why he continued to act otherwise was apart of the mass enigma that was his father. Bloody dramatic.
Snape cleared his throat again. Ten ticks, this time. Should be about…
"Yes. Muggles, right?" Draco asked slowly, and Harry nodded. It just occurred to him that Draco didn't know anything about how his summer's with the Dursley's went. Locked in his room, scarce servings of food and the only contact to the outside world through Hedwig and his friends. For all Draco knew, Harry went home to a bunch of ignorant, blissful muggles. He probably even thought they
Dressed to go in the water moments later, he glanced at the vial in his hand and looked at the crowd. He immediately spotted Draco's blonde head amongst a sea of green scarves, and the boy caught his eye. He nodded nervously, and Harry smiled and shook the vial. The sides of the boy's mouths twitched, but he just tapped his nose knowingly, three times. He then traced a finger from his mouth down the line of his throat. It wasn't exactly clear, but Harry understood anyway.
"That will be enough, Severus." Dumbledore cut him off. Draco barely held back his grin. "I'm sure the boy knows what his actions convey."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Too late, it's gone, it won't come back." Harry said, reciting the last line of the clue.
Naturally, Draco fell in line with other children from the most prominent Sacred-Eight families from then on. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were not the brightest, but they were far more tolerable than Pansy Parkinson, whom Draco took a few years to get used to being around before becoming good friends.
Harry prodded her questioningly, but she batted him away with her free hand. Draco looked at Umbridge, seeing her purposely ignoring the girl as there was no way she couldn’t have noticed. Soon, many more students were choosing to stare at Hermione's attempts to catch the woman’s attention, and Umbridge, finding she could no longer ignore the situation, looked up with the same tight smile that Draco had seen her give Pansy that earlier morning.
"That's because it was banned at that bloody school." His father sneered. Draco just barely flinched, feeling like he made a mistake in asking at all. His father sighed, placing his hands behind his back and turning his back again to a nearby window. "It was a popular spell, at some point." He turned his head to Draco with a slight smirk, "Your Godfather was always good at putting things together."
Turns out that Blaise’s mum’s new husband worked in none other than the Department of Magical Archives, as what Draco later discovered was the position ‘Head of Archival Organisation’.
"Sleep well, Potty." Draco muttered absently as he thumbed through his book for the right page. Potter said nothing back.
“Tch, that won’t do, will it?” Umbridge said suddenly. Harry looked up to see her peering at his parchment with a judgmental glean in her eyes. It was the most outward she’d been towards him in the past two days.
"I…We…" Harry stuttered, "Don't get mad." He said, feeling like he was about to make a very bad mistake.
“And your parents agree with your...inclinations?”
Harry sat back in the seat ponderously. The parchment of lines seemed to be put on hold for the time being and he definitely wasn’t complaining. He crossed his arms over his chest, tapping his fingers on them impatiently, “Well a person such as myself would certainly be concerned about the happenings at the Ministry, wouldn’t you say?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"But not when you talk to Harry. And I've seen how you act and you haven't done anything to make me think otherwise. I know you'll mean it."
Harry scoffed at that and decided to leave the issue for the time being, getting up from the chair and stretching deeply.  "Well I'm in Gryffindor, luckily for you." He said, shooting Ron a sly grin. The other boy shoved him lightly, but said nothing in a silent agreement to let the matter lie.
Harry woke up the next morning like a man on a mission - but then again, he
As if Draco hadn't bloody
Malfoy shoved him away, his usual sneer back on his face so quickly Harry was almost taken aback.
"I did." The boy winced. Draco's mouth fell open.
"What if he messes it up? Slips up when it matters most and makes a mistake? Being in the position that he is…"
"So. You have a thing for Quidditch players, is it?"
He made to the edge of the lake and scurried to the secluded spot under one of the Willow trees. Malfoy was already there, sitting down on the ground to Harry's surprise. He was busy inspecting the soil around him and throwing some of the rocks in to the Lake.
The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast.
," Ron said in a tone much like Hermione's, "Is there no way you can get out of taking the tosser as your date?"
"The task, Harry. Third one." Draco said dully.
Umbridge EATS that shit up and Harry, in a final effort to make it believable, uses wandless magic to momentarily change his eye colour to red. Umbridge watches in catatonic shock and he cancels the spell, acting as if nothing had happened, and leaves the room.
"Why is it so…run down?" Draco asked thoughtfully.
on using magic to fix it.
"I couldn't…It's my fault!" Harry hiccupped, leaning in to Draco more as he drew slow circles on Harry's back soothingly. Draco guessed Harry was talking about Cedric, and his heart squeezed because Harry really blamed himself for someone else's death.
"All the more reason to believe him if he says he's coming back! Look, with what I heard about my father, what he did in second year, it all makes
“I see.” Draco narrowed his eyes at him, but he didn’t budge, instead staring straight ahead. “Well I’m sure you’re not going to do anything too bad again, will you?”
"No!" He snapped back, but ten minutes later, he was carrying in a saucer of English breakfast with a copious amount of sugar in it.
Malfoy took a step back and whipped his body to the Lake. Harry calmed his breathing, his pulse going rapid-fire around his body. The only sounds were the lapping of the water and the heavy breathing from both boys. Malfoy looked angry, and even a bit lost.
"Yeah, think so." He said as he precariously poured some in to a tube.
He readjusted the bag on his shoulder, “See you tomorrow then, Professor.” With one last smile thrown over his shoulder, he walked out the door leaving a very shocked Umbridge in his wake.
"Nothing, Viktor." She said curtly without taking her glare off Harry. "As soon as this dance is over, Harry Potter, you will
"Oh. Well that's…"
"How do you know." He said weakly, stalling from the actual point.
coming back." He looked at Draco cautiously, assessing his reactions, "What side would you be on?"
"Now you got it." For some reason, Harry could hear the smile on Draco's face while he said it and he finally broke one of his own. He buried his face deeper in to Draco's shoulder to hide it, and felt the other boy tense up slightly.
“G’night, Harry.”
"I don't give a fuck about what they do. The fact that they exist is enough to make me despise them alone."
, lighting the two boy’s faces in front of each other. Harry looked down at the letter in Draco’s lap.
"Would it be terribly bad if I hugged you again? Just once?" He asked tentatively, hands clenched at his sides as if a coiled spring about to strike.
"I know." Harry grumbled.
"I could ask you the same question." The boy said casting a side along look at Draco.
side. That means what you fight for, I'll fight for. It's all just…a bit grey at the moment."
There was a loud thump, the sound of a heavy object hitting Ron's head, and the subsequent sound of it hitting the floor.
“I don’t want my magical signature on her stuff, you dolt.” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He really was quite hungry, but he needed to get this sorted out first.
Draco snorted, "When don't you? Be glad there was no Potions. Snape can probably smell mental weakness and you'd have been reeking of more of it than usual."
"Going for a walk." He mumbled, not waiting for Ron or Hermione to respond. He walked out the Hall without looking up, focusing on his shoes and not caring if he bumped in to few people on the way. Before he knew it, he was sitting on his usual spot by the Lake in silence and staring blankly at the water.
"It'd be annoying. And I can take care of myself that much." Draco said, answering his rhetorical question out loud.
Meaning there were no threats in the maze. It was just Moody.
God, he hated himself.
"Erm…By the way." Draco started, reaching the last few steps with Harry and halting him as the others went inside the kitchen. "Mrs. Weasley…She looked mad at me earlier. I'm not sure what I did."
"I know, Draco. He was in Hogsmeade and he practically lives in his Animagus form, so he's alright for now." He assured. "He wanted to talk about the Tournament, and then he spoke to me alone after - Ron and Hermione were there too by the way."
casually. "Okay. They don't like you." His face turned sour suddenly, "
He felt Harry's stare on his skin, and they were quiet for a moment. He quickly wiped his cheeks, wondering if Harry saw, or just decided not to comment.
Two knocks. "Mother?"
Harry's eyes widened, "Unbreakable." He repeated.
"I…just…worry!" She sobbed. "What if…something like that happens again?"
"Yes. It made little sense, bless his illiterate heart, but my views on blood purity were constantly countered by his logic - as unbelievable as it sounds." He said at Blaise's disbelief,  "He had started to compare all of what I said about muggleborns to the war and what the Dark Lord did. Of course my family supported him, but look where that got my Father? Not only on the losing side but with a tainted reputation. I don't necessarily like muggleborns and I don't care about muggles, but they were being
tell me, what I should have done to keep magical culture pure. What should I have done about keeping your history honourable and whatnot. Because not everybody can control how their life stumbles upon being magical. Not everyone has your bloody privilege of knowing where they came from and what place in society they'll have, let alone that it'll be at the very elite part of it. I had no family, some people have no magical family. It's not a big deal! So get your head out of your arse for once and look around. There's more to life than background and
“There’s nothing wrong, you’re just a little...stressed out. It’s normal to be angry.”
to wizards, Potter. I wouldn't expect a muggle-raised like
"Fine." he grumbled. "Bloody O.W.L.S. I'd forgotten all about them."
Draco was sitting on the windowsill in one of the high towers of Hogwarts, his parchment and books laid out around him that he was dutifully ignoring in favour of staring at the transfigured Quidditch pitch.
"I said
“I don’t know…” Pansy replied pensively. “She was all agitated in class. Didn’t you two notice?
"Find another spot, Potter. This one's obviously taken by me." Draco once said to Harry when the boy came across him sitting in some well-needed silence from the heavy atmosphere of the Slytherin Common Room.
"But he died! Potter himself killed him!"
“But she was looking at him all weird! Like she was studying him or something just as creepy.”
He felt foolish, however. The other main reason he stayed in his room was in the dumb hope that a letter might come for him at any moment. From anyone. It'd been one week since the summer holidays started, and he had yet to hear from his friends. He missed them terribly, and it only added to the ache of everything else he had to think about.
"They're technically living." Sirius shrugged.
“Oh, the lower levels have much more complicated systems, but of course.” Lancaster took another sip and Draco watched hungrily as he finished the cup. “We now have the ability to sort by date, theme or even keyword!”
Once wrapped up, Ron pensively packed up his things before saying tentatively, “I think we should discuss things with Hermione first, yeah?”
“I’ll make sure nobody sees, I promise. I just need you to get in. Just this once, and whatever you want, I’ll get it for you.”
"I'm just worried it may come back to bite either of you." Hermione said, her voice hoarse as if she might begin crying, but Harry could see her eyes were dry. "There is never getting around these things."
knowing Voldemort's out there? That's even if I'm going back!"
He hadn't necessarily lied to Draco earlier, but to say Sirius hadn't taken the news well was severely sugar coating it. It took Harry ten minutes to calm his Godfather down before he could even begin to explain.
set the Slytherin off in all sorts.
"And what's that." Blaise asked patiently.
"OH! YOU TWO!" Mrs. Weasley cried a moment later.
“It’s gone, but Ron, it had hurt so much. What if she really is-?”
"I know. Place your bets on who's room this was." Draco laughed, walking along the walls. He pointed to the muggle contraption where a woman clad in what seemed like undergarments was draped over languorously. "What's this thing?"
"Merlin, don't worry about it, Harry." Draco cut him off, holding up a hand. "It wasn't anything I didn't deserve. I think you know that, too."
But the person in the maze couldn't have been a student. This person was tall, a hair a dirty blonde colour. It could have been a man.
“That must be it,” said Draco. “Let’s go.”
“I’m glad we sorted this letter out,” Draco said as they were on their way back to the castle. Harry turned to see him smiling softly at the ground as they walked. “I have a direction now if that makes sense. Thank you.”
"Yes, like me." He grumbled, annoyed for some reason.
“Oh! Right, well I just thought it odd that a student such as yourself would be...interested in topics of that manner.”
The Professor glanced back at the pink note for a second. “You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”
But he knew he had to do it now, if not later. If he wanted to be different from his father, he needed to go about mending those rifts his family had caused. He was doing it for himself, mostly, not his sham of a bigot dad. If it made Harry happy too, then why not?
"He'll be fine." Harry said, but the words were overpowered by his relative's panic. Dudley's eyes found him, and Harry was surprised to find them fearful, and almost regretful.
"That's not the point!" Remus said loudly. "It's basically-"
It had been easier for Harry to just forget the events of that night while Draco had been around, but as soon as he left and Harry was laid up in his hospital bed once again, the curling anxiety came back and settled in his stomach. He stared at the blank ceiling above him, letting his eyes go out of focus and blur the lights together.
"Oh, before I forget." Malfoy said, fishing through his robes and bringing out his wand. Harry's hand instinctively tightened on his own, which he had been holding the whole time he was there out of habit. Malfoy, however, regarded Harry's hand on his wand with a raised eyebrow and tossed Harry his own wand. It flew in an arc straight in to Harry's lap, it's dark wood shiny and smooth. Harry picked it up cautiously, holding it out in the light.
"The Ministry isn't…on our side?" Harry asked.
Soon, the man cast a few more spells Draco didn't recognise. He looked around once more, then started out the maze again, following the jutting paths fluidly without hesitation.
"Then what?" said Harry.
for Harry?" Ron growled, and Harry's heart began to race as he realised how close everyone in this room was to being at each other's throats. He had always feared that Draco and his friends wouldn't mix well, but he never realised how much he hoped it would happen anyway. "Just last year you were close to killing him!"
"I…" Harry blew out a breath, thinking. "Kind of, yeah." He admitted apologetically. "It's like I can't do anything on my own."
By the time the first Monday back in classes after the Ball occurred, Harry was still no closer to figuring out the clue to the egg. Despite having the entire break devoted to the bloody clue, Harry never got past the wretched thing screaming bloody murder at him.
Then, as the pain in Harry’s arm gave a particularly nasty twinge, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through Harry's body, making him impossible to be touched.
Harry heard him huff and opened his eyes. He saw Malfoy stood up a good meter away with his arms crossed, looking at the Lake. His face was back to it's perpetual sneer, eyebrows furrowed and his mouth in a tight line. Harry stretched his legs out and leant back on his palms behind him.
"Mhm?" The boy replied, looking like he was half-listening with a serene look on his face.
"M' alright." Draco said flippantly, looking up to stare at Harry face-on. "What happened?"
"Professor Snape, Sir?"
“Fair,” he said. “I’ll see what I can do and I’ll get back to you.”
"Oi!" A banging at his door. "What's all this? Open this door, boy!"
"What? Why not."
-o-o-
"Yeah, what." Ron said absentmindedly.
"Like what?" Malfoy asked irritably.
When both had gotten under the covers, careful not to make any noise above the hushed sounds of their sleeping dormmates, Draco heard Blaise whisper lowly so he barely just heard him.
-o-o-
"I think we're both smart enough to know a meaningless apology when we see one."
"Realise
." Draco hissed. He stood up again, immediately drawing the attention of all the Slytherins as well as some students from the Ravenclaw table next over. Addressing everyone at the table in his most commanding, no-nonsense voice, he said,
"Now this time what I want you to do is, when I cast, transfer your wand to your other hand before you block." He arced his wand again, and this time Draco followed the instruction and whipped his wand in to his other hand before casting the counter-jinx. This time, it stopped well before it reached Draco. He was breathing slightly heavier, and his body was in the same position before, but his left arm was held out in his father's direction.
. Hermione, helpful as always, said nothing and picked up the jar she had been eyeing and walked away. So much for
Her eyes seemed to narrow even more, the corners of her mouth pinching tightly.
. Bloody prat.
"Morning!" He bellowed, much too loud for the earlier half of the morning.
He looked away. He didn't have time to analyse that.
"Do you want to?" Dumbledore asked calmly, and Draco shut his eyes, tears betraying him and rolling down his face.
"I just liked the place where we initially talked. It was relaxing, so I wanted to keep going there. It seems he liked it too, though, so unfortunately we bump in to each other there sometimes."
Draco frowned, unable to recollect when Ronald had expressed an interest in joining the Quidditch team, which is what he assumed the boy was going for as he was distinctly practicing Keeper maneuvers. He had wanted that new broom after he’d been picked as prefect, though, so maybe that was the reason. Draco wondered why Ronald hadn’t told anyone about it, as he was sure Harry would have surely mentioned it if he had,
"I don't care about what you think, Ronald. And to answer your question from earlier, Viktor asked
“You may go,” Umbridge said impatiently. She was marking some papers and hadn’t even looked up. Harry checked the clock behind her and saw it was almost eleven at night. He flicked the quill to her side of her desk and it fell off the edge, clattering to the ground.
"No unfortunately, no hexing." Draco said leaning back against his headboard. He sat thoughtfully for a moment, thinking about the evening before and trying to remember what happened before him and Potter parted ways and went to their respective dorms. They had danced, Draco remembered bitterly, then they went outside at Potter's request - but why had Draco trusted himself to be led outside like a bloody fool? He could have been attacked! Or hexed! Or seriously maimed!
But Harry had done it. Umbridge’s smile was gone, and her face was pinched together. “Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident.” she said coldly.
"And I'm just very skilled at it." Draco said impatiently. "Any other reason why you're here? Or shall we talk about my Transfigurations marks, too?"
Without a word, she steered him in to a seat surrounded by Ron, Neville, Ginny , Fred and George and a couple of other of his Gryffindor classmates. Nobody said a word to him, except for Ron's quick clap on the back and a short "Welcome back, mate."
"Well…" Draco started not knowing how much to tell Blaise in order to ensure he got teased the least. "After the, uh, dance, we agreed to talk about the whole thing, because it was rather weird and people kept asking questions."
"Well it'd be terribly hypocritical of me to disapprove of something like that - especially after how I was before. Even then I had reasons, but now I can't see anything wrong with being…"
"Unfortunately, it all is." The man replied gravely. "Voldemort has once again risen. The time has come, much too early for Harry."
After the Weasley's and Granger left, with much hugging and hushed words, Draco slumped down on to the end of Harry's bed, completely spent.
"No, both of you," Remus looked at them both head-on, and Harry became hyperaware of Draco's presence next to him. "
"Oh, aren't you two darling?" She said, picking up an apron and drawing it around herself. "Then since you're both here, Harry, you can start on the eggs while Draco and I make the batter."
Umbridge hesitated for a moment, probably running through their conversation from the day before. Harry knew what he’d said, but he hoped that maybe if he acted like he hadn’t then she might just let it go…

"It's not
Once in the corridor, out of sight or earshot of the Defense classroom, Harry broke into a run. His skin felt frigid as the sheen of sweat met air resistance as he flew down the halls, not particularly caring where he was going.
know what you're getting in to. Do
"So Black was innocent?"
The shadows scattered across Harry's face sent a rush of fear through Draco, the malevolent glint in his green eyes flashing something serpentine.
i wrote this in the midst of exam season, because i obviously have my priorities set right. this is also a heads up in case i don't post again for a few weeks, but once they're over i'll update!
"Not if I phrase it right. Nor if I sum it all up at once, somehow. We just need to make it so I'm as versatile as possible." Draco said quickly, speaking faster than he could think. "So even if they captured you or me, they'd never be able to find out the truth even if it was staring at them in the face. Hell, we could be in the same bloody room kissing each other and they'd never know!" He grinned to himself, thoughts flying around his head. "A secret-keeper keeps it inside their
"Malfoy." A voice called out. Draco turned quickly to see one of the older Weasley children beckoning him from the other end of the table. He quickly took one last bite and gratefully slid out of his seat with a regretful look at Mrs. Weasley. Making his way to the man, Draco was interested to see a few piercings and what he assumed was an animal tooth through his earlobe. He didn't have much time to think about it, however, because in the corner of his eye he could see he was also approaching where Moody sat, and his skin immediately prickled on the side of his body that faced the man.
"Like Severus here." He said, gesturing to Snape next to him. "I understand you also have some doubts about his loyalty, but I can assure you they are well placed. Please put your trust in him from now on if you need anything." He turned to Snape, completely ignoring Draco's incoherent sputters of disagreement, "Severus, I'm sure you can look after the boy if necessary?" Snape nodded, and Dumbledore continued, "And if any emergency or need shall arise, the address is number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."
"No, for God's sake." She said angrily at once, her tone making him look around at her quickly. "If we're going to be working together, it's not going to be like this, so apologise."
Hastily throwing his satchel over his shoulder, Draco reluctantly left his dorm feeling empty and vulnerable without his wand. He couldn't shake the odd feeling of having left something behind, and only the thought of breakfast and his wand back kept him going all the way to the Great Hall, fatigue and hunger from the all-nighter finally catching up with him.
The door opened to reveal Draco still half-shirtless, his hands in the process of going through the sleeves of his top. "I recognised the sound of your footsteps." He said, stepping aside to let Harry through, to which Harry obliged. Draco pulled at the hems of his top down, covering his body. He was dressed in light pajama trousers and a matching long-sleeved top, in a pastel blue colour of all things. It barely registered to Harry before what kind of clothes Draco wore outside of robes and semi-formal wear as a means of being
“Hey, who’s the bird next to Dumbledore?” Blaise asked, making Draco look up quickly to the Teacher’s table, where Dolores Umbridge sat in full, blush glory.
"You better not be bloody asleep again, Potter."
"But Draco…" Blaise sighed again, rubbing the back of his neck, "This isn't just because the ferret thing is it?"
“Don’t be.” Ron waved him off, beginning to unbuckle the straps of his gear.
"Right…" Harry said, unconvinced, but let it lie. "What about you? Merlin, I forgot you had to go back to your-"
Draco swallowed, a large lump in his throat that made it hard to breathe. "So…How can you trust me?" He asked hoarsely, trying to dull the sting in his eyes. "I am the son of a Death Eater. I might even become one as well in the future."
"Dinner?" He asked.
The other boy's eyes narrowed as he let go of Draco's hand, "I think you mean I'm taking you. I asked first, after all." Anger flared in Draco's chest but he suppressed it and just smiled politely at Potter. He considered arguing, but he really had better start getting ready. With a sigh he replied, "Of
"Hi guys." He said, and awarded by puzzled expressions from both. "Potions first, right? Let's be off before we're late." He started walking ahead of them, a little too much bounce in his step.
"I DON'T CARE IF IT'S FAIR!" Harry shouted, face like a torrential storm, "WHAT ABOUT ME? WAS ANY OF IT FAIR ON ME?"
Soon, Ron and Hermione left Harry to go deal with the new First-Years (“Midgets! This way!” - “Ron! You can’t say that!”), and he was once again back in the company of Neville, who was currently raving about the password to the Tower being the name of his plant.
"Got it!" Harry called back, and the two left with lazy waves.
"What are we doing here again?" He asked impatiently after a few moments.
Draco nodded mournfully, looking down at his lap.
Harry walked a few paces ahead of Malfoy all the way to the side of the Lake. He made sure to stop beneath a willow tree that would have obscured them from view if anyone decided to look out the courtyard. It was a secluded area, and Harry pleasantly noted it's suitability for staging a non-so accidental death of a certain Slytherin student. The moon was still a few hours away from the crux of it's path over the sky, but it shone regardless and cast it's beams over the water. Harry thought he might have enjoyed it, if certain
He tilted his head, “I don’t think you get it, Professor. It was just me and Cedric that night, but it wasn’t me who killed him.”
Nudging Ron awake, he quickly immersed himself in their potion without looking at Draco for the rest of the lesson.
"Uh-" Draco sputtered in shock.
"Yes, well it could be either beneficial or extremely dangerous. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though. The bugger's not even alive yet."
Yeah." Ron said resignedly, "We just…We're always here for you, you know? If you need us?"
“Oh, alright. Thanks.” Ron said, looking slightly embarrassed.
"Harry." Hermione beckoned him over, and from the way she called he knew he had no choice. He slowly got up, momentarily forgetting how to move his limbs and made his way to her. He sat down on the floor just across the chair she was sitting in. He knew he was in for it when she snapped her book shut
"Oh! I forgot to tell you!"
quite a bit of technical magic stuff in this chapter. sorry if that's boring for you lmao
“You said he works in the archives. The ones at the Ministry?”
Conjuring his most charming smile and throwing it at the Weasel and finally to Potter, Draco strode to the boy and took his hand. He shook it once, hiding his wince that it was quite as clammy as it looked, and said,  "Very well. I will take you to the Ball, Potter."
Draco said nothing for a moment, thinking about it all. Currently, they had four sides to contend with as far as he could see. The first two were simple: Voldemort’s followers and the Order of the Phoenix. Those against Voldemort and those in support.
"Why the bloody hell not? I thought you didn't want to take him!"
"You two, I swear. It says in the introduction that the Ocular Replenishing Potion is a restorative supplement for one's tired, distressed or dry eyes. It's mostly a medicinal potion, but people brew it at home too." She said, finding the page she wanted and stabbing a finger at one of the crowded paragraphs. "If you had read it, you would been able to include in your notes that the appearance In colour of the potion isn't necessary to be stated, only whether it has the desired effect."
pile.
"Er, Ocular Replenishing Potion?" Harry tried to say confidently. Snape scowled, obviously disappointed he couldn't take more points off of Harry.
"Draco." His Godfather sighed.
"I'm not- It's not like -" Harry backed away, hand reaching out behind him for the door handle. "I'm not!"
"You seem to possess a particular aversion to her." Dumbledore remarked.
“It was
He said nothing, keeping his eyes trained on the wall behind her as she cried.
Then with hurried writing underneath it,
"She still hasn't given up on S.P.E.W."
"Not that I'm not grateful, or that I didn't like- no, I mean I didn't
"Wh- No!" Harry said a little too loudly. " 'M fine."
"Well, now's the time to learn." Molly said jovially as he saw Harry shake his head to himself, "Come on, then." She beckoned him, and he shakily got up to join her side. Harry was already heating up the stove, looking completely in his element while Draco felt stiff and awkward.
Outside, Ronald caught a quaffle deftly. Draco watched him throw his arms up and whoop to himself, a small sound in the vast area.
He handed it to Harry, eye fiery, “This is wrong, Harry. No matter how you see it-”
He stared at the ground throughout his journey back to the common room, the weathered stone floors rushing past his vision as he traveled down the darkened corridors. He soon looked up to glance outside the windows out of habit, spotting Ronald down by the Quidditch Pitch once again.
“Oh, shit. How were tryouts?” Harry leant forwards urgently.
“Well, you can’t just lose your temper at every person who insists on something other than what happened, which may I remind you, Mr. Potter, will happen alot!”
"What d'you mean?"
“G’night.” Hermione slurred before disappearing up to the girls dorm, rubbing her eyes tiredly. “Mr Keeper and Mr Seeker!”
"You slept like the dead, Potter." Malfoy said, looking at him with amusement. Harry sat up, rubbing the back of his head and yawning the sleep out of his system. The sun was much higher now, and the warmth was almost stifling directly under it's gaze. Harry irritably noted that Malfoy didn't even look like he was
for the next few minutes while I speak." Snape said harshly. The man went on to tell Draco in detail what exactly happened to Harry the night before, while Draco had been stuck in the classroom. From the moment Harry and Cedric touched the Portkey, to Cedric's own death and the subsequent capture of Harry.
Harry felt everyone's gaze on him at that moment, but he didn't look up.
found Draco, Harry let it go.
"I live to serve."
Sighing and taking off his glasses, he said, "I'm sorry. I'm just…I don't need that right now. Could you please just…not do that?" He rubbed his eyes tiredly, fatigue catching up with him.
" Draco snapped.
Draco came down the stairs to the landing where the curtains were screaming, Harry noticing his wand drawn. The boy peered at the curtain as it threw senseless, guttural cries.
"How's Parvati, Theo?" Blaise said sweetly, and Theo looked up nervously.
“Good.”
Draco fell in to a heap on the floor, the air knocked out of his lungs as he was released from that one same spell his father seemed to keep hitting him with. He let himself catch his breath for a few seconds on the floor, before pulling himself to his knees, still panting heavily.
"That's what Snape thought." Harry shuddered involuntarily, "Imagine if he had found me. I think I had nightmares about it when I got to bed." He was pretty sure he saw Draco shudder too.
A spell. Merlin, he had just used
"Git." Harry muttered, rubbing his arm while Draco smiled slightly. "I'll have to learn some new spells."
. Draco swore.
The pillock wasn't looking at him. Not just that, but he was purposely
“I got Draco’s letter,” she whispered over the table at Harry.
He thought from nowhere, momentarily making his heart seize. He reluctantly pushed it down, along with the panic he felt from earlier. He listened to the music that was playing, a soft melody played by pianos, violins, trumpets; all at once. He let the sounds wash over him and tried to forget who he was.
"Have a good evening, Professor." He said as he opened the door. Snape didn't reply, and Draco left.
“What? You don’t have to-”
“Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we?” she said, finally letting go of his hand.  “You may go.”
Around the table were the Weasley's, all already seated and chatting loudly amongst each other. Granger was seated between Ginevra and Ronald, while Ginevra was busy giggling with another woman whom seemed to be changing the shape of her nose. He wondered what type of spells she was using to change it so easily.
Just like the day before, a sting started on the back of his right hand as the words were cut into it magically. Blood began to bloom in the form of the letters, barely dripping out of the wounds before healing over again.
"Mr. Malfoy." Snape leered. Draco said nothing, knowing Snape would say what he needed to and leave regardless. "May you please explain why you and Mr. Potter are dancing together at the Yule Ball." He didn't raise his voice at all, but he didn't need to. Draco could tell he was angry just from the way he expressed his syllables. "Because last time I checked, you and Potter were not…friendly, with each other.
"That's got to be one of our biggest issues, as well." Draco said.
“Erm, right. Well, Ron and I were just discussing the Sorting Hat’s song-”
“Naomi. Naomi Adley.”
“Jesus, Ron.”
Harry sat back with a huff. “Fine.”
," She turned to him with the most venom in her voice, "I don't know what you're planning, or what you've confunded Harry with, but when I find out I will hex your fingers off!" And with that, she turned away and stomped to wherever Krum must have been sitting.
"Is that why you're being moody, then?" Pansy asked incredulously. She gave Blaise a knowing look which he returned, "Should have known."
"Just this summer. Dueling practice. It was doing pretty well until now, actually…" Harry looked down at his knee, using a hand to prod at it and squeeze slightly at certain areas. "Fuck are you doing?" Draco asked, peering at him before Harry pressed somewhere in between the joint of his knee and a sharp pain went through it. "Shit!" He yelped, smacking Harry's hand away.
“So just make one.” Harry deadpanned. “Magic, remember?”
He shook his head to himself. It seemed not all Hufflepuffs were gratuitous in their ingenuity.
Draco's shoulders loosened slightly. "Good." He said, his face just a fraction softer.
Draco thought, and it shouldn't have been as satisfying to tell himself as it was.
"Right." Draco said, looking slightly deflated. Harry didn't understand why the boy's mood suddenly changed before his eyes caught on the sun sliced in half by the horizon, but looking whole anyways in the reflection of the Lake.
Potter put a lid on his snorting and said, "I did help him for the first task, so it's only really fair if you look at it." He smiled lazily, and Draco felt something in him jump that the boy seemed alright again.
"That you're not so bad." Bill smiled. "And you're not the same bloke that hexed slugs to come out my brothers mouth in Second Year."
you, it goes
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free-”
“Never since we've joined Hogwarts.” Draco said gravely. His eyes found the child in question, a girl with dark skin and hazel eyes. He hadn’t met her on the train, only realising she was a muggleborn because of her unfamiliar name during the Sorting Ceremony. When the hat had called her name, she had the air of someone who knew nothing about where she was, which wasn’t uncommon amongst those from muggle backgrounds.
He matched Malfoy's heated stare and said in a tone that left no room for argument, "We'll talk about this later." because he knew he couldn't do anything in that moment without embarrassing himself as well as Malfoy.  The Slytherin - thank Merlin - didn't say anything to provoke Harry after that, seeming to have come to the same conclusion as well.
"Where's he been?" Harry exclaimed.
.” Draco hissed as he spotted some of the people around them giving the three some curious looks. “You’ll start rumours about me!”
, Blaise." Draco grumbled, attempting to bury his face into his pillow in hopes it would smother him dead.
"I know. It's all just extremely suspicious. Do you think this has to do with all the possible Death Eater plots?" He looked at Harry suddenly. "Do you think it was you who was meant to be attacked instead?"
"Nothing." Draco said quickly, acting as odd as he'd been for the last ten minutes. "Just remembered something."
Draco sat up, "He is a Black! My Mother was a Black too, Harry. We're cousins!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco flashed a grin reassuringly. "I'll be fine. I never needed them, anyway."
“Good evening,” he said curtly, not making eye contact. He tried to make his face as neutral as possible, but hiding his emotions was something Harry was never good at.
“You hand! How long have the cuts not been healing?” Umbridge snapped, causing Harry to flinch from the sound.
"And I'll be here." Harry sighed sorrowfully. Draco squeezed his shoulder once, then turned to face the meeting. Bill was waiting for him, and Draco braced himself with a deep breath.
Snape's frown deepened, but his hands stayed up as he stared at Draco.
All at once, Harry said his goodbyes to his Godfather and Remus, leaving with Arthur as the man muttered about something to do with tubes. Draco watched them walk down the street together, Arthur's hand in his jacket, probably on his wand in case of any sign of danger.
"Can't wait."
"You didn't even notice." Ron piped up, "You also always looked more…relaxed at odd times when you did finally show up. I thought you were going barmy from the Tournament, to be quite honest…" Ron said, rubbing his neck sheepishly at Harry. Harry stared between his two friends, not knowing what to say and wanting to ask a million question all at once.
“That’s alright, then.” She said, “We have Arithmancy together. I’m sure he’s figured something out.”
"He laughed because it was
"I don't think so." Remus said honestly, voice quiet. "It shouldn't be, because the Vow doesn't physically manifest unless it's broken, but you've set up the chance for it to be, you understand, boys?"
Stepping in to the room beside Harry, Draco saw two more ginger heads than normal. Not only that, but they were identical.
Harry sighed frustratedly. Still nothing on the news. Was Voldemort really back? Wouldn't he be spilling as much muggle blood as he could by now?
, so excuse me if I'm still right confused when you think you can speak for Harry about something when you haven't ever even spoken a good thing in your life."
“Yeah. Because I don’t think I can stop myself anymore.”
“I thought I’d start celebrating early,” Harry said. “Slytherin have no chance against us.”
improved.
“Fine.” His automatic answer. Hastily, he wiped his face.
Weasley must not have realized what was happening until that moment—Harry had to thump his back as he suddenly choked on his firewhisky. Granger threw a disapproving glare at him before turning back to Lavender. “You both work in the same department, then?”
“Just black,” Draco answered.
He thought he might fall apart as Harry gave him a sly smile and then wiggled out of his pyjamas. His cock curved against his stomach, bobbing as Harry tossed his bottoms aside and then lay on the bed. Before he could lose his nerve, Draco reached forward and took Harry in hand.
Harry made an impatient noise. “You know that’s not what I meant.”
“S’alright,” Draco muttered, passing Potter the vial. He closed his eyes and began to absently thread his fingers through his hair. In truth, he was nervous.
“What are you—what are you angry about?” Draco asked, breathless, as Potter suddenly stopped kissing him. Potter leaned his forehead against Draco’s, searching his eyes—though for what, Draco couldn’t say.
“Yes, sir. Don’t want to be late for my first class.” He held up his timetable and flashed a smile that he hoped seemed genuine.
“A Shield Charm?” Draco said. “Really, Potter? Stick to Lumos for now.”
“Fine.”
“Well…” Blaise looked over at Draco, who shrugged. “Alright, then. Er, see you, Draco.”
“But what if it’s dangerous?” Pansy asked, her face anxious. “What if they’re experimenting on you, to see if it works? Is this—Draco, is this why you’ve been fainting?”
Harry glanced where Ron was pointing, the boy's finger stopped near a pale circle contrasting off the dark green thread background. It was Draco. Looking up a little bit, he spotted a familiar face, just barely recognisable underneath a black scorch mark burned on to the top, like a cigarette burn.
"Yes what?"
"Wow, Malfoy! Just wow!" Harry begun to fake clap, "Another orphan joke! How do you do it! I had no idea!" He stopped clapping and took a threatening step towards the boy, looking down at him with nothing but seething hatred and getting the same look back up at him. "Don't you
-o-o-
"Oh." He said simply, and Harry grunted in agreement.
"Creature, indeed-"
“Just one more thing, Draco.” Dumbledore cut in, stopping Draco in his path to the door. He turned to look over his shoulder.
Draco rolled his eyes, "My partner in Potions? Tall, fairly handsome, has gold earrings in for some reason…"
"I have no idea how to convince you how very
Remus's eyes widened comically again. He paused for a moment, shocked, before letting out a loud laugh. "Keen one, aren't you?"
Harry sighed frustratedly, running a hand through his hair. "T's nothing, just… He barely even acknowledged me. He didn't even stay to talk to me after the hearing ended… I just…" He paused, thinking for a moment about the hearing and why on earth Dumbledore couldn't just have
," He looked up at Harry, pupils blown but not quite even looking at him properly, "And who better than Harry Potter to carry mine."
All too easily, he found Potter and his two parasitical companions. He bit in to his croissant again and tried to catch Potter's eye. Merlin, why wasn't the boy bloody
Malfoy jumped and smeared ink over the end of the sentence he'd been writing. His fingers curled dangerously over his quill and he turned his head to glare lethally at Harry.
The bird saw him, and he could swear the thing's eyes narrowed at the sight it saw. It rose to it's full height, wings tucked at it's side and head pridefully held up so Draco wouldn't be able to look down on it even if he tried. It's body covered the window behind it, blocking all light and casting a shadow on Draco. It was bigger than, and from the looks of it, even if he had his wand which had been confiscated by Harry, much more powerful than him.
' to the girl. Her glare softened and she nodded approvingly, leaning back to talk to Lavender Brown.
Pansy stood at his side completely silent, but Draco could feel the anger radiating off of her.
"But if Dumbledore
“Oi.” Harry felt a kick on his back. He turned irritably to see Draco standing over him. “Get up, you oaf. Once I leave, this charm on the ground leaves with me.”
Before Draco knows it, he's swept up in to a crushing hug by the woman.
"Right. Well done." And Draco's mouth almost fell open from the sudden praise he never got from the man.
Draco thought bitterly.
Pansy's face softened with relief. "Oh that's it? It's okay, I can go with Blaise or something. I assume someone else has asked you then?" She said with badly hidden curiosity. Draco groaned again and Blaise smacked him on the leg.
“Alright.” He stepped forward and drew his wand. With a flick upwards, he lifted the inkpot off the ground. As it floated in the air, Draco looked over at Potter, who was staring at him intently. He lowered his wand, and the inkpot drifted gently to the floor.
Draco climbed the stairs to the Owlery two at a time. Although Callidus was sleeping high up in the rafters, given his size he wasn’t difficult to spot. Draco decided to let him sleep a bit longer. He sat in his usual spot on the window ledge and pulled out his inkpot, a quill, and a few feet of parchment. Addressing his mother, he started by outlining his classes and his assignments. He rambled on about Transfiguration and Charms, detailing the spells they were learning in as dull a manner as possible. Then, he described the study groups, listing all of the students he had coached and his thoughts on the curriculum for next term. Before moving on to finish with news regarding his friends, he added: “I spend a lot of time in front of the fire in the common room.” And, in concluding his letter, he wrote: “Tonight, everyone’s going out to Hogsmeade, but I’ll be staying in. I expect them to be back around two in the morning or so, but that’s too late for me: I have a Potions assignment to finish.”
“Ron’s already started his Auror training,” Goldstein continued.
“Oh, er…” Lavender looked up at Theo, smiling sheepishly. “I don’t know. I hadn’t really thought about it.”
“I really don’t think he’s in the mood for dancing and drinking in that bloody room,” Draco snapped, irritated.
“Let’s get you back to the castle,” Harry said. It was as though he was unaware of the others’ presence.
They looked up as Delacour approached them, tutting. “Monsieur Malfoy, Monsieur Goyle, surely I can expect better? ‘Ave you been practicing your wandwork?” When they both nodded, she gestured at their lizard. “Go on. Show me.” She stepped aside and clasped her hands neatly as she waited. Annoyed, Draco swiped his wand through the air: “
Pansy snapped her mouth shut, glowering at him.
She looked up at him, amused. “Since when are you such a stickler for the rules? You’re like a doting father this year.”
“Right, then leave me alone.” Potter’s close proximity did nothing to soothe his nerves—if anything, his chest felt tighter than ever.
They pushed through the crowd until Draco caught sight of them: Theo towered over everyone else, while Lavender looked very pretty in a teal peacoat and matching earmuffs.
As Harry traipsed off to the store cupboard, Draco told himself to relax. To take a deep breath. He forced himself to focus on the familiar sounds of onions bubbling away, knives hitting wooden cutting boards, and Slughorn’s footfalls as he paced through the rows. The experience was so surreal that he almost felt as though he was watching it from outside of himself: he and Harry, working next to each other in Potions, getting along as well as they ever had. Maybe it wasn’t Harry who had lost the plot—maybe it was him who had finally gone insane, and was now having very odd hallucinations about Harry Potter of all people.
“Good! Very good!” he said happily, moving on.
Pansy climbed gracefully into one of the carriages, and he made to follow her, until he caught sight of the Thestral hitched to their carriage. Its taut, black skin gleamed in the moonlight, and its great wings were drawn tightly at its side. Of course, Draco had been able to see Thestrals for a while now, but at the sight of the skeletal beast he froze. His stomach clenched and flipped as though he had missed a step. The blood rushed in his ears. He hesitated, halfway into the carriage, and he found himself unable to move.
“Oh, no, this is different,” he said. “I’m not erasing anything. Hermione gave me this potion, here…” Potter reached into his pocket and produced a small, green vial. He passed it to Draco, who turned it between his fingers. The label read
“How’s your Mark?”
“And you sent Weasley?”
And Harry, nearly drunk with arousal, found that he wanted that, too. Wanted everyone to know that he was helpless when it came to Draco, that he gladly allowed himself to be used however Draco needed, that he was powerless with Draco’s cock in his mouth, fucking him senseless. Harry curled his hands into fists and pressed them tighter between his legs, doing everything he could not to touch himself. His cock needed it,
Finally, Draco slipped off the bed and walked over to him, cock bobbing against his stomach. “Tell me what you want,” he said softly.
come, then?”
“Right. And what map are you talking about?”
Draco waited for Proudfoot to move on to the next pair before asking Pansy in a low voice, “What have I done this time?”
“Does it still hurt, Draco?” Harry asked. “Your Mark?”
“But you used to have a massive collection, Draco!” said Nott. “I reckon you must have just about every card. Of course, now there’s all sorts of new ones…I got Longbottom last week…wanted to toss it in the bin, but then I wouldn’t have the full set…”
was the one bringing Harry to this point was too much for him.
As frustrated as he was, Draco couldn’t stop the peculiar little squeeze his heart gave. That word—
She shrugged.
“It’s nice,” he said. And it was, particularly in the glow of the Christmas tree.
“Hi,” Potter said as he approached Draco. Looking back over his shoulder at Pansy’s retreating figure, he asked, “Is she okay?”
Draco groaned. The thought that Harry was enjoying this, was enjoying
His mother pursed her lips. “You can’t avoid your father forever. You’re his son, Draco, whether you like it or not.”
“Absolutely not,” Potter said firmly. “What if you have a bad reaction?”
“Oh, great. Just what I need, Nott and Zabini there to cheer me on.” He took one final swig from his goblet and then rose from his seat.
“Mummy, daddy,” Pansy said, still sounding short of breath, “do you remember me telling you about Lavender Brown? She works at the Ministry, with Theo.”
Even with his wrists held tightly above his head, Harry managed to look up at Draco’s face. He was close enough to kiss—and he wanted to kiss him, wanted so badly to taste him, to hear him groan the way he did whenever they kissed. His lips were pulled into a teasing smile, his white blonde hair halfway in his eyes as he leaned forward to hear what Harry said to say. “Want you to fuck me.” Harry cleared his throat, trying to soothe the rasp in his voice. “Fuck my mouth.”
“Harry!” Draco whispered furiously. “You’re so transparent.”
“How should I cut this jewelweed?” Harry asked, pulling out his cutting board.
“I know that.”
Harry looked him up and down, as though unaware, or unbothered, by everyone else in the room. “Should we go, then?” Harry asked. His voice was several decibels lower. “Meet some people?”
Draco shot up as if electrified, dropping his textbook. At the commotion, several students looked back. Delacour frowned at them as Draco reached down to pick up his book. When she finally turned away, he hissed, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
The tension was palpable. Draco’s fists were curled tightly in his lap. He urged himself to calm down, to breathe. He wanted desperately not to show Harry that he was bothered. Because Harry, of course, seemed completely unaffected by his presence, just staring at him as though he was a mildly interesting oddity. The thought made him sick.
“I do care,” Potter said immediately. “It’s not what it looked like.”
"Think of your mother, all the good parts of your childhood,” Harry suggested. “Think about that time you let a Dungbomb off in the Manor.”
Draco was staring down at the knife in his hand, considering the blade’s steel, when he suddenly flashed back to the Manor, to that horrific moment when his aunt had used her knife to carve deep into Granger’s flesh—he had wanted desperately to look away, and yet hadn’t dared, and so had he stared, transfixed, as Granger writhed. The blade had pierced through her skin so easily, slicing through it like butter, until it was obscured entirely by Granger’s blood, weeping out of her wounds. Draco had seen the other Death Eaters torture people before, but it had always been with magic. It was still gruesome, and he still wept at night, but rarely had he seen marks on flesh. There had been something savage about the way his aunt had maimed Granger.
“I bet it was Boot or Goldstein,” Nott declared. “You were all buddies at the Three Broomsticks, weren’t you?” Zabini sniggered, which seemed to only encourage Nott further. “Had them both at once, did you?”
“Threw me in the dungeons for a week.” He looked over at Harry, who was staring at him in horror, and laughed. “I’m joking! Of course she didn’t put me in the dungeons. She just yelled a lot. My father was out in the gardens checking everything over, so we managed to clean it up before he came back in. Had to open every window in the Manor.”
Grinning shyly, Harry took Draco’s hand into his and pressed it against his chest. “Feel how hard my heart’s beating.”
Draco paused. “Do you want to?”
“I’ll take care of that,” said Proudfoot, approaching them from the High Table. “Let’s clear out the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, that should be more than enough room.”
“Because you aren’t subtle at all,” Draco complained. He watched as the small dot labeled ‘Mrs. Norris’ slunk down the fifth-floor corridor. Nodding at the Marauder’s map, Draco said, “Show me again how to wipe it.”
“Fuck off,” he mumbled. He ripped off his clothes and cleaned himself with a quick flick of his wand—he didn’t have time for a shower, although he badly wanted one.
“He’s still on that?” she sneered. “God, I would have thought it completely beneath him to ask any of us for help. You know he thinks he’s a better wizard than anyone at this school—including the teachers.”
As the hour went on, they paced through the students, correcting where necessary. Draco had to grudgingly admit that Potter seemed to be in his element: smiling, exchanging jabs with his fellow Gryffindors, and offering words of encouragement to some of the younger or more nervous students. Draco, meanwhile, felt that familiar sense of dread rising in his chest again. He kept glancing at his wristwatch, willing the hour to go by.
“There’s no way.” Pansy shook her head. “It’s—it’s hours away. You’ll never make it on brooms.”
“No. Leave them. Please, leave them.”
Draco sat back. His head hurt from trying to make sense of everything.
Draco stumbled out of the shower, catching himself on the vanity. Shaking, he reached in and shut off the water. He took one of the towels next to the sink and dried himself, avoiding his reflection. He didn’t want to see how scared he had become. He didn’t want to see how little of the Mark there was left. He couldn’t live like this anymore, he knew. It was time to set things right. He pulled on his pyjamas and then headed back into his room, where Harry was still lounging on the bed.
"You seem to be taking it particularly hard, though."
," Draco was embarrassed to hear his voice crack slightly, hear it sound so pleading and
he wanted to call out to Harry's retreating figure, but couldn't get the words past the steadying anxiety snuffing his throat. Instead, he watched Harry's back until he disappeared from view, his heart feeling heavy with the sense of a harrowing tomorrow so strong, it made his eyes sting.
The older woman finally spotted him from Harry's side, frowning when she saw him. "And you are?" She said.
"Draco,
"Harry-"
" Draco finally shook Snape off, looking at him for the first time. He'd never seen the man look at him so unguardedly. Like he was scared.
“Well,” Pansy started, “I’m not usually one to ponder too much about the state of my teachers - physical nor emotional - but she was especially antsy and I believe it was because she kept looking at Potter.”
What was most irritating was that the wounds were small and not even lasting, yet they stung so bloody much. Harry barely held back hisses of pain as the wounds were exposed to air then closed back up again.
"Please, dear. Call me Molly."
"Right. Voldemort works secretly, did so in the first war. He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails who he wants, not going around knocking on doors. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. It's possibly why Harry was attacked by a Dementor in the middle of a Muggle neighbourhood."
"Me? Just, er, I went for a walk." Harry said.
attacked!” A boy next to Dean added, hand already up as well. “Seamus Finnigan.” He added before Umbridge could open her mouth.
Draco scowled. “So quite dangerous. You could have just said that.”
“Enough!” Umbridge shouted. “I won’t have it! You’re insane, Mr Potter. Insane! You will continue with your punishment as of right now, or so help me I will keep you here until morning!”
"I do too! Right Blaise?" Draco said incredulously, turning to Blaise who was shrugging vaguely. Draco sighed and turned back to the last few bites of his food. Pansy said nothing more on the subject for a while, until,
He heard Harry snort. “Bye, Draco.”
"Snape?" Ron cried. "Oh, bollocks-"
"It also sounded like they were out to get something." Draco continued, "That they'd found it's location. Dumbledore said something about that, too. An object, or a-"
Eyeing the wand again, he held out his arm to it. He closed his eyes, trying to replicate what he did earlier. What he done exactly? Oh right, he had taken a deep breath back then, so he did it now. He had felt his heart slow by just a beat, and remembered wanting his wand.
Draco nodded knowingly, tensing up despite himself.
His father spent a good three hours with his guests in the Dining Room, and Draco may or may not have fallen asleep a bit in between. It was probably his first nap in weeks, though, so he allowed it.
"Right." Draco said, just managing to keep the bitterness out of his voice. His father was a Ministry man as well, and he seemed to be doing the same thing as Crouch; burying his shady past away where everyone would also rather forget it. It suddenly became strange to him how his father was even still at the Ministry. Wasn't having been a Death Eater at all not caused any alarm? How could people move on so easily?
"Hurry up, Potter." He said impatiently to the boy, whom was still sitting in disbelief, then quickly left again before Harry had the chance to throttle him.
“Thank you.” Harry sniffled, voice thick and still not looking at his friend.
Harry nodded gruffly, skin still prickling with excess magic in the air and trying desperately to keep in inside along with his anger. He continued chopping his ingredients, glancing at the textbook and realising he'd meant to be crushing them instead. He swore audibly, throwing down his knife and ignoring the niggling warning of Snape's nearby presence.
His father pointed his wand at Draco, and the ropes around his body loosened and disappeared.
His eyes flew open to see two very angry Slytherins standing not far off the foot of his bed. Nott, poor soul, was now practically
"Well his son of course." He said as if it was as common as casting a Lumos.
"Not then. You're not invincible. It's not your job."
“Bollocks, I can’t!” Ron twisted out of Harry's grip angrily, walking away again and disappearing into one of the toilet stalls. Harry narrowed his eyes, but a moment later Ron emerged with a wad of toilet paper.
“Pansy!” he cried, staring in horror down at his parchment, an essay for Potions about the properties of Moonstone. “I was almost done with that!”
, guard completely down.
Remus chuckled. "Nonetheless. Thank you."
"What are you two on about?" Weasley asked almost exasperatedly before Draco left the room. He didn’t wait to hear Harry's reply, quickly walking to Charms with his chest feeling oddly tight.
“So that’s it?” Harry asked, feeling slightly put out, “It’s just a few notes about your father not being able to get something. Not only do we not know what he wanted, but Umbridge knows about it too, now.”
, picking up the most recent volume of a generic
The three made their way outside unnoticed by the other Weasley's, and they entered a room across the one Draco and the Order had gone in to. Walking in, it seemed to have been some sort of parlor at some point in time, but was now abandoned and layered with grime. There were faded sofa's in the middle of the room, a vaguely patterned rug on the floor that may have once been black, and on top of it a deep wooden coffee table. What was most noticeable was what could obviously be a Grand Piano covered in a dusty tarp to one side of the room. It looked as if it hadn't been touched in years, and the tarp was almost completely grey under a layer of dust.
Blaise cleared his throat awkwardly. “Right, erm, well I’d say that you’d have to blend in first, innit? Like get under the radar so they won’t notice you, even if they find out whatever it is is stolen.”
Harry sat up determinedly, “What if she just uses this - your father I mean - to try and get closer to you? You can still do your job, then.”
Something unsaid passed between the two, a mutual understand flashing in both their eyes as they stared at each other for a moment.
Above all things, he needed to apologise to Draco.
"Do you think it could be…Death Eaters?" Malfoy asked, face blanching.
“He was out of order, Harry. And besides, I’m a prefect now. S’ not right to call you names, even if you’re not my best friend.”
"So are we all…" Harry started cautiously, "Are we good now?"
Just like the day before, he started to run through the halls with abandon. He needed to get away, and get away
Harry, one step ahead of him, was already scurrying to the bathroom with his bag of toiletries. “Save me something to eat!” He called out after him.
"My robes! This all your fault, Potter." He snapped. Harry rolled his eyes and sat back down. He yawned deeply, "Just cast a scourgify on the later. I want to enjoy the outside a little more."
be able to come to with his miniscule brain."
Malfoy shook his head, suddenly looking extremely pale.
-o-o-
Draco and Harry both said nothing for a moment, stunned.
who does Snape’s work early.”
“I know, Harry.” Draco said in a hushed tone. “Figured you needed to cool off before facing her.”
"You told me to leave!"
"I - I'd prefer it." Draco said, his eyes wide in confusion.
“Draco?” Pansy asked with concern. “Where'er you-”
Finally, his father stepped in to view, looking down at Draco with something like disgust in his eyes.
“What do you mean?”
"You lot!" Draco barked, and they both jumped like kneazles thrown in cold water. "Am I nice?" He demanded, crossing his arms. The Third Years nodded quickly, and Draco turned to Blaise triumphantly. "See?"
please forgive me for missing 2 weeks of posting! I'm trying to get a rhythm going again somehow.
Draco continued to look at him as he looked at Buckbeak, unable to tear his eyes away. "Yeah." He mumbled.
"Would you believe me even if I said no?" Harry said tiredly.
Remus's face sobered, but his smile didn't fade, only changing to that of acceptance. "It was foolish of me, but I never managed to let him go from my life, even if he was sentenced for life. Because I knew he was innocent."
"He's just sleeping right now, that's all, Draco."
Soon, Pomfrey levitated a tray on to Harry's bed, with even a plate for Draco, sitting at the foot of his bed. Harry looked considerably calmed down, and even smiled briefly at Draco when he reentered the curtains.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, Ron seeming to be waiting for Hermione's approval. Soon she turned to Harry and reluctantly nodded. Harry smiled, feeling a weight on his chest lift off of him. The spent the rest of the morning talking about Sirius and the Egg clue, before Harry realised they were late for breakfast.
"Yes, sir."
Nonetheless, Potter was too stupid to take advantage of it and
"Just take it day by day. Get cleared in the hearing, go back to Hogwarts and focus on your upcoming O.W.L.S. Alright, Harry?"
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.
"Shit." Draco blew out a sharp breath. "He's kept it well under wraps."
He heard a snort from where Draco was. He didn't look, but something warm settled in his stomach at the sound.
His right hand curled in to a fist, then released. He definitely felt a tingling feeling in his fingertips, and the inside of his wrist had a slight burning sensation. He looked down, expecting to see his hand glowing or something just as bizarre, but everything looked the same. His hand flexed, but still nothing.
"Fuck!" Draco disappeared under the Cloak again, "Damn you, Harry" He hissed. Harry chuckled and took a few steps back in case the other boy decided to retaliate. "I'll be going now, you prick." He heard Draco grumble. "I'll get your cloak back to you somehow."
." He spat, and heard Blaise chuckle quietly to himself behind him.
"Sirius." Harry whispered. He traced his eyes around Sirius before they landed on another face, not burned but still resembling the man himself. "Regulus Black." He read out, his head quirking to the side.
Draco's mind went back to when he'd thrown himself in front of Harry before fake-Moody could fire a spell, and wondered why people equated It with something so big as actually saving his life.
"That thing was a Dementor." Harry said levelly at Dudley and ignoring his Aunt and Uncle, "It sucks the happiness out of you. That's why you feel the way you do right now."
This time Blaise opened up the gate and glanced around. Draco briefly wondered what the difference was between floors six and seven, but his train of thought was stopped by the room they were walking into.
Harry gritted his teeth. “I haven’t a clue what you want me to do, Professor. If you can’t already tell, I’m bleeding and I have better things to be doing right now.”
When he woke up the next morning, a feeling of nausea already flooded through his system as if it were continuing from the night before. Ron barely seemed to notice his worse for wear appearance, however, as the boy seemed to also be as tired as him. Harry was sure that if he’d poked Ron even the slightest while they were changing into their uniforms then he would’ve tipped right over. His eyes didn’t even seem to be open. Harry could sympathise.
“We’ll be seeing you later, then, ma’am.” Draco bowed slightly, trying to lay it on thick which indeed earned him a gasp. “And if there is anything you need assistance with, for whatever reason, please don’t hesitate to ask either myself or Pansy.”
Right. He
"About her and Krum! You must have! You're both champions, you must have heard about it!"
"In due time, Draco. Now, again!" And he casted in an arc Draco had come to readily anticipate as the days had passed. He blocked it immediately with a non-verbal spell, doing so again when another spell came barreling his way. Over the last two weeks, his father had only gotten tougher on him as he himself had gotten faster at reacting. It was like his father knew just how to stretch Draco thin but never enough to make him break.
"I'll have you
"But I can feel-"
“Good evening.” Harry said, monotone just like the past few days. Umbridge barely replied, unlike the days before when she would make some fake-cheery response. She didn’t even shoot him with one of her signature spine-chilling grins.
"Vat is the problem?" Viktor asked innocently.
Then for a moment, he forgot where he was. Who he was with, why he was there.
Harry proceeded to tell Malfoy about the theories that someone else had put his name in to put him in harm's way or another. It felt wrong at first to tell Malfoy, but the boy in front of him listened intently, not a hint of ill motive behind him. Harry chastised himself for putting blind fate in to the boy, but kept going anyway as they discussed how Harry's name might have been entered in to the Competition.
"Really?"
When the door was opened, the sound of a loud crack filled the air.
anyways, life is super busy rn and I'm actually going off to uni very soon (doesn't mean I'll abandon this fic tho. release your pitchforks). if I'm a little distant, it's probably cause I'm too busy, but I'll try my best! this is my de-stress project anyway, so pretty sure I'll need to be writing it a lot.
“Of course, my boy.”
He spent Breakfast giving Ron and Hermione a brief synopsis of what had happened the night before, and regretted it for the ten minutes in which Hermione scolded him for going out at night alone. She wasn't as vicious as she could have been, though, because he brought the poem that came from the egg with him.
“Magical archives. My father asked for files from there but was denied access.”
Harry's eyes went as wide as saucers. "What?" He gasped.
When he's done for the day, he asks to miss Friday's detention in favour of Quidditch keeper tryouts (she ofc says no. nasty bitch)
“Hunch or not, this is about Harry’s life. Could it be dangerous?”
"Oh, for Merlin's sake, Potter. Why the bloody hell did you ask me, then?" Malfoy spat. Harry looked him the eyes and saw the same anger in them he always saw when Malfoy spoke to him. The sight only made Harry want to rise to the bait, anger coiling in his stomach.
As the room had emptied, Ron, Hermione and the other Weasley children made their way to Harry's side of the table as the adults siphoned out the room to go about their business. Harry assumed that since the major general meeting was over, everyone was done for the day.
power, Draco. Recognise what makes them the reason people obey, lest we start placing them on untouchable pedestals.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"The clip was on my bedside drawer! The one that's also next to
Getting permission to go the bathroom, Harry borderline scurried out of the classroom and settled in an alcove nearby. He pulled the note out and read it.
"Did you and Malfoy fight or something?" Ron asked carefully. Harry drew his eyes away from Draco and nodded, looking down at his plate. Both his friends said nothing for a while, and he focused on pushing his food around, having picked things up he didn't even like but wanting it to look like he was eating anyway.
"Voldemort." Draco said quietly.
"I am not short." Harry said hotly. "A few millimeters on me and this is how you act?"
Hermione just sighed, rubbing her face again. "Don't be. I just wish you…talked about it with us first."
Blaise nodded glumly, looking slightly deflated at Draco's answer.
"Draco!" Pansy hissed in his ear. He spooned some oatmeal in to his mouth. "Are we just going to ignore it?"
"I'll do my best." Harry said, trying to smile and show his friends he had it under control. All three stayed staring at each other for a moment longer, words spoken without being said, then Hermione pulled Ron away to the stands to sit down with the rest of the school.
"I…" Harry said, gripping his sleeve and head turned away. "I'm sorry for, er, you know. Shouting at you."
Draco opened the door to reveal an impatient Snape waiting for him, tapping his foot on the floor. The man barely waited a moment before spinning on his heel and marching back down the steps of Grimmauld place. Remus flashed him a wince, and Draco returned it. Levitating his trunk, he made to follow Snape before the man left without him.
Hermione had unfortunately heard what Draco had said, her frown deepening at him. Ron, meanwhile, rolled his eyes at Harry.
"The usual Malfoy never knew his father was intending to serve a madman in a war for the second time." Malfoy growled. "I may be a dickhead but I'm not a murderer, or some extremist."
“Do I really need to explain it?” Harry for the first time that evening, raised his voice. “Must I really make it explicitly clear to you, like some sort of child?”
Harry pondered it for a moment, looking down sheepishly for overreacting, “Yeah, sorry.”
"Ron, where's Hermione?" He asked. Ron barely looked like he was listening as he stared far off with a glassy look on his face. His nose was scrunched up as if in the throes of a terrible event.
"Well I wouldn't put it past them. They were there at the World Cup. You remember?"
"Damn." Moody swore. He looked at Draco. "I'll be back." He growled, and threw open the doors quickly, shutting it with a lock and leaving Draco with the sound of his wooden stump thumping away unevenly.
"Merlin, Potter. Spit it out. You babble like a First Year."
"Small woman?  Vaguely toad-ish?"
"Bloody hell! Draco, shut up. Pansy, shut
Malfoy turned to him, "What?" But another movement caught Harry's eyes just in front of him. Viktor Krum's date, a brown haired girl he hadn't recognised whirled around and Harry sputtered once again. Viktor followed his date and smiled once he saw Harry, "Ah, hello, Harry." And he turned to Malfoy and slight recognition crossed his face, "And..ah, yes. Dragon! I vemember you! Ve spoke at the velcoming veast…Malloy, is it?" He said proudly. Malfoy gave him a tight lipped smile, an infuriated glint in his eyes. It didn't occur to Harry to give him hell about it, however, because he was focused on Viktor's date, whom was none other than Hermione Granger.
. Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office.”
"Is that so bad-"
"I think they'll say it's a very nice haircut you got, Harry. ' Oh, Harry, how on earth did you do it?' They would say, ' Why didn't you take
"What the fuck are you on about?" He asked weakly. Why hadn't he killed him yet? He was right there. Any sane person would understand if he did. Maybe he could get Lolligo to hide the evidence.
He crossed the courtyard cautiously, wishing he had bothered to bring his Invisibility Cloak. The stupid thing was tucked away nicely in his trunk upstairs.
"You're weak." His father said bluntly. Draco wanted to say nothing, too busy trying to figure out why his father was looking at him like that. Surely he couldn't be
Was that really happening? Malfoy was probably extremely sleep deprived, although Harry found himself quite fond of that little spot by the Lake. Hopefully Malfoy would bugger off and he could have it to himself.
"Chirpy lot, you are then." Greeted Theo Nott, sidling up to their table. "Can I see your sketches if you're done? I think my plant was sat on or something."
It was fitful, and it's fevered dreams meanings were lost to him almost as instantly as they came.
Harry shook his head, "No, actually. We just danced and that’s it." He glossed over the part where he and Malfoy went outside for some reason, "I think I hurt him more while dancing to be quite honest." He said sheepishly. He thought for a moment, pushing up his glasses, "Although he did take me outside and point his wand at me at one point."
"Merlin, Malfoy. But you said
And Draco, no matter how much he tried, could never control the influx of emotions he had when it came to Potter.
"What? Bloody hell, Draco. Tell me everything at once.
Harry stared at him for a moment, then nodded to himself. He then begun to tell Draco about the maze for the next task, how Viktor asked him to talk in private about something.
"Wrapping up?" Draco asked incredulously, "I still have no bloody idea what's going on! You Know Who is back, and now I have to go back to a house with one of his followers, and my friend's been traumatised,
"Molly is a pleasure, but I'll be glad to never hear about my 'peakiness' every again. I tried to tell her, but she just
Her eyebrows perk up in interest, "So that's how you always pass Potions so well?"
"Merlin, what's that about." Muttered Ron.
“Sorry about Cho.” Ron whispered to him midway.
Draco couldn't help but shudder. He was still avoiding Crabbe and Goyle ever since being transfigured in to that elusive
he, a supposed Wizard capable of taking down a Dark Wizard as a baby, reject him so outright? What could be possible be so wrong with Draco that he had said no? Harry Potter didn't look much at all, in his old, oversized clothes and wonky glasses. Draco was clearly better than him in every way, or so he believed at the time. Shouldn't it have been the other way around? Why was Draco the one feeling humiliated and left behind, and not Potter?
Draco's eyes went wide, "How did you know?" He asked, and Sirius and Remus laughed.
Umbridge gaped at him before taking his hand. He was too busy to savour her expression because he was focused within, remembering the time during summer holiday, back in the Dursleys house. The rev of energy, the prickle of magic through his arm...God, he really hoped he didn't mess it up….
"Gillyweed." The boy said, and Harry sat on his hands so he wouldn't throttle him right there. He sighed and closed his eyes, praying for strength.
Theo's eyes shot up to his for a moment before looking back at his sketching with a small smile. "No problem." He said. It was weird to Draco how genuine it seemed. He expected to be nice to people (or some resemblance of), but didn't expect it back.
“Why does Umbridge have it, then?”
"Wrong pile." Ronald reminded beside him after he'd just placed an old tome in the
Panic shot through Harry’s system at the thought, so he relinquished the hand hesitantly. Umbridge’s hand shot out and gripped his, tugging it closer to herself so harshly that Harry was pulled out of his chair to lean over the desk awkwardly.
“You say it like it’s easy.” Draco snapped, “I’m already up to my eyes with shit to do, and now this is happening, too. There’s no way for me to distract her without drawing attention to my-”
" He sounded like he was finally absorbing it, to Harry's dismay and ill fated destiny. Ron's face was slowly blooming in to a shade of red that implied he was about to get really pissed off and Harry quickly searched for the best way to leave the chair before being attacked by the ginger. Damn it, he should have picked a different chair. Harry swore at himself internally, his pulse quickening as Ron continued, "Harry…Oh Merlin, Harry you really didn't."
to come this year."
"Hi." Harry returned. "Erm…Celestina Warbeck?"
"Belladonna, right." Harry said, shooting a fake glare at Ron as if he should have known better, earning him a shove. He added the Belladonna, and watched as the potion turned in to an endearing shade of silver.
"Erm…Sir?" Draco said tentatively, eyeing the grimy houses wearily while scurrying next to his Godfather. "Are you sure we're in the right pla-"
"Oh, where is he? I do hope he's awake!" A worried female voice said.
Draco said nothing, pulling Harry back in and cradling the back of his head as the boy cried in to his shoulder.
After a moment, however, whoops and cheers came from the hallway, and he knew what the verdict was.
"Probably to see to it the right pieces are in their assigned roles." Draco said bitterly.
-o-o-
"Uh, yeah-"
"We thought we heard your dulcet tones." The other said.
"Big boy words, Draco." Blaise cooed mockingly. Draco removed his arm off his face to glare at the boy and Blaise returned it with equal mirth. Draco sighed in defeat and looked at Pansy wearily, "Change of plans, Pans. I can't go to the ball with you."
"Hello yourself." Draco couldn't help the relieved smile on his face. Harry was
Harry grabbed Ron with his other hand quickly.
Sighing, he tore off the cloak with his hands held up non-threateningly . "Just me, cousin." He said casually.
, back then.”
"That's right, Malfoy." He started with a dangerous smile on his face, "It seems I have no choice but to ask the most undesirable, unwanted and desperate of the lot to the Ball. What can I say? Of course it's got to be a
want? Does he ever ask for your input? Because I'd say it was pretty important, considering what you've been through to deserve it. You of all people should be involved, don't you think?" Draco refrained from mentioning the way Dumbledore once spoke about Harry as if he really would be the one defeat Voldemort himself, although he didn't know why. It probably had something to do with Harry's sorry appearance or how weak he looked at the moment.
"Right, sorry. He's making me work like a
“I see.”
"It is. I'll show you one day. I keep forgetting to bring it here actually, so I don't have to sneak across the courtyard."
There was a chorus of gasps around the room, Slytherin side included. Draco was even stunned, as it was the first time he’d heard Harry verbally acknowledge Cedric’s death at all since it had happened. He itched to race out of his chair and shake Harry out of his rage. The boy definitely wasn’t doing himself any favours, especially to someone like Umbridge, who Draco still had no idea was capable of.
McGonagall didn't stop staring at them for a few painful moments before stalking away, her eyes still wide. Harry sighed at the floor and turned to Malfoy. He immediately regretted doing so as he saw the boy staring at the top of his head with a sneer.
He looked back at Bill to already see him looking at him.
"You need to get started, Harry! You have around a month, you fool! How you've survived this long is beyond me!"
, Sirius." Remus barked, then sighed. "Just let them hear me." Sirius sat back, fuming but staying silent. Remus turned back to the two boys.
After assuring Blaise that no, he wasn't going to storm the Ministry and no, he still wouldn’t tell him what he was planning, Draco rushed back to the Library. He went straight for the section filed under
Ron nodded and looked at Harry uneasily, "Well, I was with Hermione one night while you'd disappeared again, and I was doing my Potions homework, you see. The one about that foul-smelling stuff? It was as awful to write about as it was to make, let alone explode-"
Pansy and Blaise were next to him, bickering as always. Neither had changed much over the summer, and although the three didn’t communicate much over the two month break, they always managed to continue an easy line of conversation when the school year started again.
Nott, ever the fool, seemed to have convinced himself he had a fighting chance and squared his shoulder unconvincingly at Blaise, "
she was! This was about politics! Alliances! Not some silly schoolyard friendship.
Draco snorted, turning away for a moment then back, "You weren't that much of a giant before this, you know."
"Fucker." he muttered.
She took it and stroked the back where he’d been bleeding not even moments before, inspecting it as if she were a craftsman studying his own work. Chills ran over his body as her fingers ran across the raw skin, almost every instinct urging him to rip his hand away from her, but he was frozen in place.
Draco laughed. It felt strained and couldn’t have possibly been believable, but the woman seemed to eat it right up.
The next two were much more grey. There was the side of the Ministry that sought to suppress the return of Voldemort for the sake of saving face, or the side of the Ministry they’d theorised had existed back with Remus and Sirius: the so-called ‘mole’ that came from Voldemort’s side. Either way, they now had to split the Ministry into two as separate types of threats.
"Ugh. Fine. Calling Weasley a blood traitor." Malfoy wasn't looking at Harry at all but instead at his palms, but whatever worked for him, Harry guessed.
"Mum thought we'd been brawling once." added Fred. "Couldn't stop the blood coming out my nose!"
“I wanted to ask how to get into Slytherin like you.”
"I don't give a damn! That thing came because of you, terrorising my
Harry sighed deeply, feeling fatigue start to creep up on him. “Alright, fine.”
Harry stared at the woman in front of him and her wide smile didn't quite match the lack of emotion in her eyes. Did she suspect Voldemort was alive? Did she suspect Lucius was up to no good in his name?
has something to do with Potter!" Blaise shot back.
"Ah, you're awake. Finally." A voice drawled next to him. Not just any drawl. Harry squinted at the figure next to him. He was sitting down with a book open on his lap not far away. That explained the paper sounds. He didn't know if it was better than just being his own books flying away to Malfoy sat primly next to him.
Blaise waved, walking away, then disappeared through the entrance to the dormitories. Draco sighed deeply with a long exhale, pinching the bridge of his nose. He could feel a headache coming on, and his blasted knee was acting up from climbing into those bloody carriages with the non-existent horses.
Harry shrugged again, trying to come off as casual, “I’ll ask her at detention tomorrow. Maybe I can do an extra few days so I can miss Friday’s. Angelina will have my head if I don’t-”
it was a first time offence. He shook his head to himself. "Wanker." He muttered.
Remus glanced at Sirius, something secret passing between them. They both looked back at the three of them, uncertainty lurking in their eyes.
"So many things…" Draco muttered to himself, then continued to Harry, "Will you be okay without any Witches or Wizards this summer? Around your muggle family, to be specific. They may not…understand what happened this year, right? What you've been through?"
Draco's eyes moved further, and he spotted the older Weasleys, Arthur, Bill and Molly. His gaze shifted to a person of a completely different contrast to the ginger family and he stilled.
Harry sat back, feeling a weight lifted off his chest as he let the sound of his friends bickering wash over him. He got up and stretched, then went upstairs with Ron trudging behind him to retrieve a fresh parchment to start his Transfigurations essay.
Draco became exceedingly good at the role, as time passed. He genuinely believed it was the best way for him to make his father proud and become the person needed to be the Heir of the Malfoy name. There were almost no repercussions for his actions, both at fault of the forced ignorance of the teachers and the fear of his name. The only negative feedback he ever openly received was from rare instances from students in other houses, and Potter.
"And you're okay with not only casting two powerful spells on the both of us at the same time, but entrusting me with being your - what was it called, Secret-Keeper?" Draco nodded and he continued, "Right. Trusting me with being your Secret-keeper, as well as accepting the fact that if you betray me, you will die. Do I have everything?"
The sun was dipping just halfway in to the horizon. The maze's green hedges looked dark blue In the low evening light, and the flash of blonde became more prominent. Draco sat on his haunches, waiting for Moody in case he did anything else.
Draco reached in to a bowl of cut strawberries that Mrs. Weasley had brought them earlier, popping a piece in to his mouth. "Not my fault you're short." He said after swallowing, eyes never leaving his book.
, Potter. And I'm not missing any classes lest I want Snape to come after me." Malfoy said, and rubbed his face very un-Malfoy-ishly. "Double Arithmancy it is, then" He got up and held a hand to Harry. Harry gratefully took it, suppressing the absurdity of it all and pulling himself up. He let go of Malfoy's hand with a nod of thanks and they started towards the Entrance. When they reached the doors, Malfoy turned his head behind him slightly and did a double take.
He only realized he was staring when Weasley looked up and, catching sight of him, frowned. Before he could escape into the press of students, Draco saw Weasley elbow Potter. As their eyes met, the smile dropped from Potter’s face. Draco turned his nose up at them and stormed out of the Great Hall, telling himself that he didn’t care as he heard another peal of laughter from the Gryffindor table.
used to say, because I believed them. About pure-bloods and Muggleborns and all that rubbish. You don’t think that’s terrible? To fill your child’s head up with that?”
"I know it must be difficult. If my parents…I mean, not that I really get along with them…but I know I’d be worried. I think you’re being very brave about it.” When he said nothing, she added, “I know Theo and Blaise like to tease, but, well…try to ignore them if you can.”
But it was clear that his mother had ordered her owl to harass him until he finally read her letter. Furious, he cast aside the green ribbon holding the scroll together and unfurled it.
Harry, apparently sensing that Draco wasn’t going to drop it, exhaled. “I just wanted…I dunno. I needed time to sort myself out.” Draco kept quiet, waiting for Harry to continue. When he did, his voice had a bitter tone to it. “All my life, I’ve been Harry Potter. The Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived. And then, just like that, I defeated Voldemort. And once things started going back to normal, I realized that my whole life, I’d had a goal, you know? Killing Voldemort. I had never really thought past that.”
Bewildered, Draco looked over and saw Greg standing at the side of his bed, wand drawn. Haggard as ever, he fixed Proudfoot with a strange, impassive look.
Harry quickened his pace to match him, and they quickly fell out of sync, but no matter; he was close to losing his mind as Harry thrust into him.
“I have a free period in the afternoon,” Potter said. Before Draco could argue, he asked, “Do you feel better? Can you tell if anything’s changed?”
Draco nodded towards the back of the shop. “Divination is down at that end.”
“Can’t,” she said glumly. “They’re so expensive. Mum promised she would buy me one last year if I did well on my N.E.W.T.s, but…”
uniform?” Harry asked. He stopped in his tracks and, with his free hand, pulled Draco closer. Their noses were almost touching as Draco looked into his eyes, hardly able to breathe.
Draco always looked forward to the first frost of the season. This year, he was not disappointed: the grounds were beautiful beneath the thin layer of icy dew. He, Blaise, and Pansy crunched through the stiff grass as they met their Herbology class near the Quidditch pitch. They huddled together, dressed warmly in earmuffs and fur-lined cloaks, as Sprout reminded them that their sketches were due by the end of the term. Although he would never admit it, Draco was very grateful for Pansy, who had been meticulously consulting their list to ensure that they sketched any plants that might go dormant come winter.
“Ready?” Potter asked, taking out his wand. Draco nodded, settling his head onto the pillow and closing his eyes. “Three…two…one…”
Harry shifted, and his leg came to rest against Draco’s. “Check your Mark. Does it look any different?”
“We have a quorum, Mr. Potter.” Madam Webb seemed to be growing very irritable indeed.
“Are you alright?” Potter asked, reaching out to him.
Draco nodded. He couldn’t take the earnest look on Potter’s face a moment longer; urging himself to get a grip, he turned to the spot where he usually lay. “What, no blanket this time?”
“Well, yeah.” Potter glanced up from his parchment, eyebrows raised. “You
Harry leaned forward and pinned Draco’s wrists above his head. “You know it’s more than that,” he breathed. “And that’s the problem.”
"And what if the Wizengamot change their plans again?” Harry asked, his voice rising. “They could move his hearing up. They could move it to tomorrow!”
“Gryffindor versus Slytherin. You’ll be there to support Slytherin, won’t you?”
Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. He looked away, unsure of what to say. Harry snickered at his discomfort, pulling him to his chest. “Sleep,” he said. “I want to watch you.”
“Pansy,” Harry said suddenly. They all turned to stare at him. Unaffected, he said, “Thanks for your help in Transfiguration. I think I ended up doing alright on the test, in the end.”
.” Draco sat up, panicked. “Blaise. It’s not like that. And you can’t tell anyone, alright?”
“Well, you’d better get a move on.”
“I can’t just go out in my nightclothes,” Draco said, scandalized. He tip-toed over to the wardrobe and pulled the door open as quietly as he could manage. The door gave a sharp
“Right.”
Draco shrugged. “Sometimes. But for me, it’s different, because…because of what I saw. And what I did. Even just thinking of that word—pure-blood—it drives me mad.”
Highly amused, Draco watched as Harry reached over the side of the bed for his wand. “Careful where you point that,” he warned.
“I suppose so,” he muttered.
“It doesn’t matter,” Blaise sighed. “Just wear any old thing.”
“You are unbelievable,” she spat. “You’ve spent
“Studying works up my appetite.” He shrugged. “Butter, please.”
“Outside to study, sir,” he said defensively. “I have a free period.”
He nodded. Potter pushed up his sleeve, examining his arm. Draco flinched as he felt warm fingertips brush against his skin.
about?” Pansy asked, bewildered.
“My Mark?”
Zabini laughed as Draco stood abruptly and gathered his things.
The Mark ached so tenderly that every time his arm bumped against Potter’s side, a fresh wave of pain coursed through him. Fighting off the urge to groan, to grip his arm, Draco said, “I’d rather be dead than have this thing.”
“Well, there isn’t much else to do at a dinner party when you’re eight years old,” Draco defended himself. “I wonder if she remembers that. Probably not. My mother has the incredible ability of remembering only the best of me. She has a very selective form of amnesia in which she forgets all of my misdeeds.” Draco looked back up at the ceiling, smiling to himself. “And that’s why I was such a well-rounded, humble child, you see.”
“And do you still go?”
“I just don’t want to waste the opportunity,” she said in a small voice.
When Harry took his wand away, Draco’s Mark burned miserably. His mind felt sluggish as it whirled through his memories. Draco grit his teeth and rubbed his hand against his arm, trying to dissipate some of the pain. When he finally opened his eyes, he saw Harry gazing at him, a sad look on his face. They both knew the same thing. It was Draco who decided to voice it. “It has to be that memory. That’s the only way.”
Potter looked up at him. “You can do Shield Charms nonverbally. You make it look easy.”
“I didn’t mean to interrupt,” Harry said. “Go ahead.”
“This here…is that a hydra?” She leaned closer to the text, squinting. “Draco, look at this one. What is that?”
“Go on, Draco,” Goldstein laughed as he finished off his treacle tart. “I was outside earlier—it’s not too cold.”
“You’ve never even heard me play!” she said, although he could tell she was pleased. “Well, anyway, that’s the plan. As soon as I’m done at Hogwarts, I’m taking the money and I’m leaving.” She gave a breathy laugh. “I’ll be on the run! And then eventually, once my mum and dad aren’t so angry anymore, I’ll tell them where I’m at. By that point, school will have started, and there’ll be nothing they can do about it.”
"So she rejected you?"
"Hello, father." Draco said, voice barely shaking. He bowed as he always did in greeting, and hoped to Merlin his father couldn't see the ways his legs shook.
"Course they are." Draco said smoothly, but Ron wasn't convinced.
Draco blew out a long exhale. He ran both hands through his hair, letting the information sink in.
"I guess it just proves how serious he is." She admitted quietly, "About all this."
Draco gulped, stomach turning from the mention of his father. "Yes, Sir. I know."
"This one's got a nice Italian villa and some other properties, I've heard." Blaise went on tiredly, and Draco patted him on the back sympathetically.
His father quickly cast the
Harry gripped his wand tightly behind his back. Just to be on the safe side.
All four chorused in agreement, the atmosphere in the room dull and solemn.
“Draco.”
Draco waved them away quickly. “Drop the sir, you’ll make me feel like my father. Now go on. Bother someone else.”
Draco leant in to Blaise, nudging the boy annoyingly. “Who said it was Lancaster I was after, anyway? Looks like everyone’s dad
"Because not even Barty talks about it." Blaise leant forward and spoke quietly even though nobody could have been listening, "His son was a Death Eater."
Draco spun around to the maze, looking up to the sparks as their colour set a sickening tint of red light over his face and Snape's in front of him. His heart sped. If it was Harry, he was probably unharmed enough to call for help…
“For centuries,” He bit out sharply, continuing, “the Slytherin dormitories have housed no one but the worthy. That means that visitors aren’t allowed within any area of the Common Room or even further. Understood?”
"No, you tosser. My scar's been hurting lately. And I get these strange dreams…" Harry explained the dreams he had been having over the summer at the Dursley's, as well as how his scar would flare up whenever Voldemort was near. It felt strange telling Malfoy all at once when he could barely even tell Ron and Hermione a few months ago. He knew Malfoy wouldn't tell him to go see Dumbledore or anything else just as useless like Hermione might have forced him to. He really loved his friends, but sometimes they didn't understand and got riled up over the drop of a pen on Harry's part. It was well-intended sentiment, but Harry didn't need that when he told them, he needed
"Nope!" Theo said, popping the 'P'. Blaise and Draco shared a look and watched Theo get what it was he needed and leave. When he was gone, Draco checked the time again and saw they had an hour until breakfast was over.
"Then those you share it with will become Secondary-Keepers. Secondary-Keepers can't share the secret at all, even if they wanted to. It's only you- why are you
“Erm...Mucus mumbletonia?” Harry tried glumly when they came up to the portrait, staring up at the Fat Lady. She smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked back at him in unamusement.
"Is it a secret?"
“What’s going on with you?” Ron knelt in front of him, looking up anxiously. “I feel like you’re not telling me something.”
" Ron hissed again into his ear.
She called Hedwig down, leaving the room with her. All that remained was Draco, and Harry peaked over his shoulder to see the boy staring at him speculatively with his arms crossed, which sent a surge of anger through him.
"Wh -
"It's possible." Remus said. "But the Order has no intel on such a thing."
“Miss Granger would bring the emotional aspects into the situation more than her brilliant logical mind, unfortunately. Were it anyone else, I would have surely consulted her, but this time there would be a conflict of interest.”
Ron stepped forward with his hands clenched at his sides, his voice tight in constrained anger as he spoke, "Actually,
"Yeah…" Draco went along with what Harry was saying if it would make him get up quicker. It seemed, however, that the boy was still talking as if within a dream.
He looked at his watch now, angled slightly to the side on his bedside table so he would be able to see properly through the cracked glass without the numbers being refracted. It was only mid-day. He lolled his head back to face the ceiling again, mildly wishing he never bothered to check the time in the first place. His limbs felt heavy, but his blood thrummed beneath them just like it did before a Quidditch match. There was a rushing in his ears that made him feel like he was swaying on his bed. He begun to think that if there was a way rotten food, sitting left and unwanted and festering in mould, it would be like this.
"Er, right. Well we agreed to meet today." Harry said slowly placing his glasses back on.
“Oof-”
"Really?" Draco hadn't expected him to give in so easily.
Draco let Blaise's words fall around him as he sunk in to a dark sleep.
"Hermione's with Ginny." Ronald waved him off. "Besides, I don't know why it's so bad."
"I'll be back." Harry repeated surely, stretching and taking out his wand to hold it. "Now I really need to get back. Hermione will kill me if Ron tells her I was out for so long."
His robes felt uncomfortably stuffy despite their relative airiness and it didn't help that he kept occasionally wiping his sweaty hands on them. At least he didn't have to worry about the robes themselves like Ron did. For what probably the fifth time that evening, Harry glanced sidelong at Ron's frilly ensemble, with hems that hung a little too high off the boy's feet. He felt marginally better after that, before snapping his gaze forward again when Ron caught him staring and scowled.
"I didn't do anything!" Harry shouted. "I said it earlier! A Dementor just attacked and I only used magic to fight it off!"
"Unfortunately." Sirius sighed.
Draco laughed, "Please, you've been looking his way this whole time. Not to mention your little proclamation of
Harry gripped his wand tighter and saw Cedric tense up next to him. The entry to the maze was obscured by darkness and fog.
"Okay." Harry said, nodding and giving her the kitchen towel. He picked a seat next to Draco, throwing himself down and immediately placing food on to his plate. "Haven't cooked like that in ages." Draco heard him mutter.
"Where's Ginny when you need her." George muttered, but silenced when Mrs. Weasley scowled at him. The two gave each other wry smiles, then whipped out their wands to start levitating food as Mrs. Weasley busied herself with the remaining food.
"In what way, Hermione?" Ron asked, sat huddled on the floor and sorting through random objects. He was nursing a bandaged finger from where he sustained a curse burn earlier on from one of them.
Blaise's head shot up to look at Draco in amazement.
No, Draco was above such trivialities.
“Mhm.” Harry nodded, mouth full of toast, “Wha’ elf di’ it say?”
"Fine." Draco grumbled, crossing his arms. "How the Weasel will help, however, I don't know."
Draco got up, seeing Harry staring longingly at the hallway. Draco reached out, putting a hand on his shoulder. "I'll be back." He said.
"My best mate wouldn't really-"
But Malfoy continued with a new sort of interest and barely spared a glance at Ron or Hermione, "Oh
"I don't give a damn, Malfoy." Harry shot back, causing something uncomfortable to sift in Draco's chest. "If I'm such a problem - If I piss you off so much, then do something about it! Not like anybody here would give a shit!"
"Sit first, Potter." Draco gestured to the empty foot of the bed. "You'll crash through to the floor below standing in one spot like that."
.” Pansy replied. “That thing’s due next week anyway, you idiot. You’re the only person in the
thank you for reading!
"Not really, I mean he really just told me we would talk about it. We were almost about to start a fight in the middle of the bloody dance, so I had to agree."
, they were going to say something about him and Potter. Not that anything
“But what she said was wrong! She was lying!” Harry said, outraged.
Knowing he had to do something before the Dementor slipped through the window, before it got close enough that he wouldn't be able to fight off the darkness anymore, Harry squeezed his eyes shut and recited a spell he'd done many times before in his head. He focused on the incantation, trying to sound it out in his head around the screams of his mother. He took his mind to how the spell felt, trying to become it completely.
Draco couldn't believe it when Harry first dived in to the water like he'd bloody lived there all his life, gills and all.
"You mean, like what, some sort of mole?" Draco retorted. Dumbledore only nodded, to his disbelief.
"Oh, I thought about it. Something about his face sometimes still makes me want to…" He chuckled at the thought, to which Ron laughed as well. Within a second, they were both giggling to each other and Hermione was sighing.
"Language, Pansy. What if I told your mother you spoke like that?"
Draco shuddered slightly, adjusting his sweaty grip on his hand at his side. He steeled himself against the chill running down his back, and stepped back to lock his knees in preparation.
She let out a choked sob and threw her arms around him. Harry immediately responded, reaching around her back as he was pressed in to her shoulder. Her knees were digging in to his chest, but he couldn't care at the moment.
"D'you think we made some sort of mistake?" Hermione whispered in to Harry's ear as Draco and Ron continued to bicker behind them.
His face stayed neutral and he stayed silent. Umbridge said nothing more, settling back in her seat, and neither did he.
"Ow! Hey!"
Remus took a long sigh, his head falling in to his hands tiredly.
Harry looked back as well, smiling. “I won’t.”
Harry nodded grimly, turning to the dorms. Ron followed him, grumbling about his hideous dress robes and wondering out loud as to why the hell Hermione took so long to get ready.
"Gay?" Remus filled in for him, and Draco nodded. "Well, not quite the term I'd describe the two of us."
“Night, Harry.”
Ron and Hermione nodded dutifully. Draco stiffened, but his face became softer and eyes grateful. "Thank you." He whispered shakily.
Avoiding looking at the reflections in the mirrors of the bathroom, Harry made his way to Ron who was waiting by the door.
"Just sending letters?" He asked, a shit-eating grin on his face.
Or that's what his mother used to tell him. He really should write a letter to her soon.
He also felt a stab of something sour in his gut from the letter. A complete contrast of the warmth it also brought him. It was when he'd read about Draco's training with his father. Harry felt…jealous? Why would he feel jealous about that? Draco was literally being trained to become a Death Eater, to possibly kill…
"Didn't Harry tell you what?" Harry asked, suddenly beside Draco with a bag of Doxies in hand. "What did I not tell him?"
Draco nodded, surprising himself.
From the look on Sirius's face at Dumbledore's name, Harry could tell the man wasn't very pleased with the Headmaster, and he felt a surge of affection for his Godfather for it.
" He moaned, his face crumpling once again, "What have you done." His face collapsed into his arms and Harry clicked his tongue impatiently. The Fat Lady clicked her tongue as well, "You boys done? Or shall I wait here all night?" She nagged. Harry swore irritably, spat the password and led Ron inside the Common Room to a chair by the fire. There were was no one else there, Harry observed. Were they all really already getting ready?
Draco deflated, but Severus went on, "However," And Draco smiled. "Dumbledore has requested your presence come August for some Order business."
Harry stretched languorously and rolled to Malfoy's side with an elbow propping up his head, "I don't wanna go up there." He rolled back on to his back. "I like it out here."
"Your boy did well." Blaise's voice murmured in his ear, and Draco was too chuffed that his bloody Gillyweed worked to even respond.
"Yes. Worried about your mental state, Weasley. Does it hurt being dumb?"
Once inside with the doors closed, Draco was jabbed in the side painfully. “Ow!”
He looked down again to the parchment, this time keeping the back of his right hand in view as he began to write again.
His stomach began to heave and he felt a sourness threatening to leave his mouth. Scrambling back up, Harry brushed past Ron and began to run again.
"What?" Harry asked incredulously, and Draco stiffened beside him.
"Right." Draco tried to hide his scowl at the Weasel's name. "When did you get here?"
"Wait - Umbridge?"
Harry shrugged. "I'm in a good mood." He said with a small wink, before turning to Ronald to ask him something, the two walking away to talk to the rest of the rejoicing Weasley children, all of whom were chanting "He got off! He got off! He got off!" to the very frustration of Molly. All that was left was Hermione, who had a curious eyebrow raised at him. He didn't like the look she was giving him. At all.
. The words never meant more than right then.
"But 'We've taken what you'll sorely miss'? That could be anything." He trailed off for a moment, tapping his quill on his parchment. "Maybe your wands? Maybe they'll disarm you. Or maybe it's a metaphor, like taking your breath away?"
"How do you trust him so much?" She pulled back, looking him over and her cheeks stained with tears. "I've tried to understand all this time, but how can you put so much faith in him? After all he's done?"
“Erm, just lines,” he said. There was no way he was going to tell either of them about the nature of said lines, especially after what he’d done after the fact. Although he knew what Umbridge was doing was wrong, he felt he at least deserved it since what he was doing was wrong too...
"What is
"Did you never think he would tell someone? That he'd betray you?"
“So what, we’re just not using magic?” Ronald spoke up loudly, leaning back as he tilted his chair precariously on it’s back legs.
"Why are we doing this again?" Harry asked, mostly to himself.
While such a reason might probably be true, Draco knew that Umbridge was mainly interested in him specifically because of his father. Not like he’d tell Pansy as much. She wouldn’t give up the chance to gossip to save her life. It was for that reason that he somewhat expected her to work for the Prophet one day if it ever managed to get out of the current (fifteen-year) rut in journalism it was going through.
"Erm, lunch is ready!" Harry said quickly before Draco had the chance to comment on S.P.E.W further. He started to the kitchen in hopes that the rest would follow, and was relieved to hear them pattering behind him as Ron and Hermione bickered about something.
"It can't be that simple as killing." Draco replied. "Not if they're going to this much effort."
"Recurring since when?" Hermione asked behind Harry, stood over him.
Draco had walked in, laid eyes on it, then walked straight out before the thing could so much as
“It’ll activate in the afternoon. Exactly one ‘o'clock.” Blaise said, pocketing the teacup neatly covered in a napkin into his satchel.
As he changed out of his uniform, he caught sight of the dreaded egg on his bedside table and studied it as if it might bite him.
, Draco. You need me to write it down?”
Once inside again, Harry could tell from the tension in the air that the Ball was about to start.
Harry walked stiffly to the front door of the house, Draco following tentatively behind. Harry said nothing, seeming deep in thought if it weren't for his clenched fists at his sides.
"Ah! See, Minnie. He's right here. Alright, Harry?" Dumbledore twinkled. Harry was too busy trying to catch his breath. He left the two teachers to go change, hearing McGonagall whisper sternly to Dumbledore before he left, "Don't call me Minnie, Albus."
When Potter focused on Draco in front of him, Draco expected him to scowl or glare, or just ignore him as he usually did. However this time, Potter saw Draco and the corners of his mouth twitched a bit, as if he was about to
“Erm,” Harry started, to which Hermione looked up from her needles interestedly, “I spoke to…” he leaned in to speak quieter, “Draco, yesterday.”
"Oh." Harry said, then it dawned on him. "That means…"
"I'm nervous, you pillock! We're about to bind ourselves with a very powerful-"
"I'm sorry." Draco said. "I get them too, sometimes. And I've taken to randomly waking up really early and not being able to go back to sleep."
"Ahh, I got it." Harry said, remembering the striking boy always sitting next to Draco during meals.
He felt an uncomfortable sensation cover his scalp and he pushed Draco away, scrambling up and grabbing his head.
"Yes." Harry said. "I can trust him. He even apologised about the things he's done. To all of us."
i feel like a negligent parent and this fic is my child.
"I saw your end of year's." His mother said, still staring in to the fire.
"Bonder?" Harry countered.
only yesterday…”
, when you entered said truce?"
And that's why when they both made to stand up, Harry broke every unspoken law and rule of the Lake and wrapped his arms around Draco quickly, almost knocking the boy off balance. At Draco's sharp intake of breath, Harry squeezed a little tighter and hoped the boy didn't hex him. After a moment, however, he was astonished to feel a pair of arms come up around his waist as he was being hugged back.
“No, Harry. It’s bleeding and the wounds are deep. What the hell did she do?”
"Francis? Fell in to a furnace and died." Blaise said apathetically. "One of the apprentices took over and half the royalties go to Mum now."
"Because, Harry," Draco continued, turning to him. "It'll be hard enough with the Ministry and Voldemort-"
"Tell me why I'm not surprised you noticed." Harry smiled tightly, still standing awkwardly in the middle of the room as Draco threw himself on to the single bed that was to one side of it, wincing slightly when he put some pressure on his left knee.
"Now, Ron. You will be nice to Draco from now on, won't you? I think saving Harry's life is far more than enough to make up for his past aggressions."
"See you then, Malfoy"  As soon as Harry turned his back to Malfoy, a look of complete pain ran across his face.
"He has been through an ordeal! He needs medical attention!"
Ron looked at him expectantly, sensing there was something like a punchline coming.
Draco nodded, “I haven’t thought of how, just yet, but I will. I’ll steal it from Umbridge myself if I have to.”
Just then he felt someone brush past him to grab something off the shelf behind him.
Harry's eyes flew open, seeing Ron's ginger head hovering above him, looking concerned. Shit. He'd fallen asleep without changing his clothes. Bloody Malfoy.
"I can't believe you're snogging a
"You'd be surprised."
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was also an envelope in her hand. “Did you — did you get — ?”
His vision was encompassed by darkness except from the faint light of the streetlamps from outside reaching in. They cast shadows on the walls and ceiling, swaying back and forth above him…
“He’s only in charge of Level Two and that’s it,” Lancaster explained, put out. “I’m the Head of this department, and yet he’s completely set aside with Level Two…”
Ron stood in the doorway, a hand on the handle and the other poised over the pocket where Harry knew he kept his wand. “Harry?” His eyes travelled between the four, Harry pointing a wand at Seamus as Dean held the boy back. Neville seemed to be trying to disappear into the shadows.
"Don't tell Dumbledore about the Vow?" Draco double checked.
“No problem.” Harry said, then they said nothing to each other the rest of the night.
“Oh! That also reminds me, then.” Hermione added excitedly, “I could knit you two some gloves for practice. It’s getting colder out…” She dug through her bookbag and the two boys exchanged glances.
“Thanks, mate.”
, sit down and take a minute."
"Move, boy. You will be next. Harry Potter will be the first death after the rise of the Dark Lord."
"I never knew he did that, honestly. He never spoke about it. He hid it from me…I-" He looked down at Harry from where he was standing with an expression Harry had never seen on him before. He realised it was fear on Malfoy's face. "You-Know-Who's…soul?" He asked shakily. Harry nodded silently, sweeping his eyes across the horizon. "So he's alive?"
.” She glared pointedly at Harry for a moment. “It would be best not to have you two draw any unnecessary attention to yourselves, understood?”
"S.P.E.W?" Draco asked in disgust.
“S’ afternoon.” Harry mumbled with his head down, still wary of the stares he could feel on the back of his neck.
"What do you mean why am I-" Malfoy snapped irritably.
“Right….”
The corners of Harry's mouth twitched slightly, "Of course." He said. "Now how do we get this Vow sorted?"
Shit. Now he felt Draco's scrutinizing gaze on him.
idea!"
"All good?" Harry asked, looking far more cheerful and like himself than earlier.
While Draco had been thinking, Snape had knocked on the door three times, and by the time he'd registered it, the split realisation that there were actually other
Draco came to a stop in front of one of the windows, watching Ronald’s maneuvers in front of the hoops - which he noted were marginally better than the day before. He didn’t know why, but he found himself still standing in the same spot a few minutes later, so caught up within layers of thought that watching Ronald’s repetitive movements merely provided a stimulating backdrop in his mind.
Bill laughed, and Draco noticed there were rings adorning almost every finger on his hands. He quickly shot his eyes back up to Bill's face before he noticed him staring, but something in the man's eyes said that he'd already seen.
"Snape told me to pack for at least a fortnight." He said politely.
family. He tried to look for any loopholes that might help Harry, but the hedges were practically impenetrable when fully grown, both physically and magically. The textbook barely even said how they could be grown, so Merlin knows how the school procured some so easily.
Voldemort was back. He was now alive, resurrected and vengeful.
"Er…Yes, sir." Draco was confused; He thought his father knew all of this already. He barely managed to not roll his eyes.
“Slytherin is for the ambitious and cunning!” The First-Year exclaimed. “They’re the ones who get things done!”
Draco made a show of reaching through her personal space to grab a butter dish, taking his eyes off Potter for the time being seeing as the boy was preoccupied with Granger's incessant yapping. He took his time spreading the butter over the croissant, and noticed Blaise looking considerably calmed down looking at him.
"I don't know. I'm sorry we never got along. Maybe because I never took your hand in first year?"
“Not the chapter, no.” Hermione said, finally letting her hand fall.
Ron waved him off, “Just go. Hermione told me he’d been asking about you. It’s been a while, anyway.”
"You've barely tolerated anything, and I'll have you know that end of year exams are coming up, and I have the right
Draco was taken aback by the question. He hadn't really thought about it before. Well, he had never really needed to. He sat for a moment and mulled over the question, feeling Blaise's stare boring in to him.
He heaved again and this time it was more gagging and less actual vomiting. His eyes began to water as his stomach muscles convulsed.
"Yeah. Just Bill. I have a meeting later."
"Professor Dumbledore. I need-" But it was difficult to say anything when he was trying to get past Snape.
Harry, however, hadn’t quite yielded yet, it seemed.
"Come on! Just for a little! I've missed it." Draco was saying, already sliding the compartment door open.
