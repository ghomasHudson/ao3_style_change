"Paul is watching us again, you bloody exhibitionist."
“Stop,” Harry said, laughing brokenly, caught up in the same fever. Draco dragged his zip down, palmed his erection through his pants. Over Draco’s shoulder, Harry could see the swollen, rosy jut of Draco’s cock, the jerk of it upwards when Harry groaned against his neck. It felt like something he hadn’t earned, being allowed to view evidence of Draco’s arousal, to hear it so clearly — to be the cause of it. The sweetness of that, whatever Draco claimed, increased a thousandfold
“Thank you,” Harry says.
“Privately,” Pansy said. “And not to the extent that Draco did, or Greg. Even Blaise, whose mother is,” her lips pulled into a little moue of displeasure, “the quintessential Slytherin, very cunning. He was already seventeen when the Carrows had us practice Dark magic on the younger students. She paid about three husbands’ worth of gold to keep him from Azkaban. Regardless, their contracts stipulate a— response, if they talk about the deals they took.” Her voice shook slightly. “With anyone other than a spouse, or their solicitors.”
“I wasn’t—”
It’s just reminiscent enough of the constant refrain Harry’s heard for so long, in one way or another, that he glares at Malfoy without realising until Malfoy’s lips tighten in a frown and he notches his chin up stubbornly. Harry narrows his eyes; although he hadn’t intended his look to be a glare, he certainly does now.
And Draco, perceptive to the last, seems to understand; he kisses Harry back with raw violence, eschewing magic to tear at Harry’s clothes with his hands, feeding Harry a gratified snarl when Harry’s shirt is gone and his glasses with it, another when Harry’s jeans are undone, and a third when he grips Harry’s cock in a ruthless fist and finds it already damp. Harry’s knees go weak as Draco works his hand over it —
In retrospect, Hermione understands her own fluster, but she can still recall how embarrassed she’d been for crying; it wasn’t as if her mum hadn’t explained puberty already, wasn’t as though she hadn’t done research and been fully prepared for its logistics. Yet Minerva had cut off her apologies with a gentle hand to her shoulder, guiding Hermione to one of the cushioned chairs by the fire. She’d brought tissues, and tea with a splash of Calming draught, and a tin of chocolate biscuits; she’d given Hermione a wooly tartan blanket to rest over her lap. Only then did she ask if Hermione needed supplies, or had any questions, and when Hermione had shaken her head, she’d lapsed into a comfortable silence, sipping her own tea, stirring it, refreshing it with Charms when it cooled. Her brusque warmth and steady presence had been its own sort of magic, and Hermione knows that if she’d not had that to rely on back then, when everything felt so new and big and raw, her whole life’s trajectory might have been different.
The tattoo was solid black all the way through, stark and attention-grabbing against his pale skin. A symbol, indelible as the one Draco had on his forearm, and as clear a choice.
Porcelain clatters softly as Granger sets her cup down on its saucer. “Rose is fine.”
“Fucking men?” Harry suggested, trying to ignore the internal flinch instigated by his fluster. He’d seemed so much more blasé about it when Harry’d first come out. “Well, I didn’t choose to link myself to someone like that,” he said, getting back to it and returning Robards’ relieved smile. “I chose to link myself to Draco.”
Rubbing over the damp chill on my brow, I tried to moderate the frantic kick of my heartbeat. I felt achy. Restless. The dreams were getting too vivid. I resolved then and there to actually look for a way to cancel our sessions.
“Oh,” Harry breathed.
“Loose, like you did mine,” he said. “Messy.” He swallowed. “I like you messy.”
Harry shrugs. Tries to put into words what wants to stick in his throat. “Hermione. Ron. I’ll be able to—” He barely recognises his voice for how hoarse he is, and he shakes his head, swallowing convulsively, until he feels Draco’s gloved hand rest on the back of his neck. Without looking up, he says, “Last night. I wanted to— I almost—”
"So, I was thinking — the O'Sullivans were the third family whose heirlooms were stolen, but the
Stay safe, everyone. All my love to you and yours. <3
To the commenter who said they'd like to feed Paul all the worms. <3
“Both, I s’pose. Or neither, if you don’t want to tell me.”
Narcissa shrugs again, a graceful, contemptuous gesture she’s perfected over the years. The pureblooded wife’s version of the more common hand insult.
“Okay.”
Their third and fourth divorces were inconsequential — quickly arranged around the juggernaut of their schedules, and failed nearly as fast as the first two: once, when Harry Flooed into Draco’s flat because he’d left some books there, and found Draco in the bath; the next for a reason he’d never really cared to know, Draco slipping into Grimmauld Place after work, jerking Harry’s jeans down, and swallowing his cock. Harry didn’t complain.
He got up from the sofa, agitated. Draco hadn’t come back down, and Kreacher had merely shaken his head upon returning from asking him. Harry wanted to leave everyone where they sat and go have it out, but he went to the window instead. It was stark outside, white and grey. The untamed hedges had taken on a blush tint and all of the flowers had gone dormant. Only the hawthorn tree brought any colour to the garden, a wintering bloom of silvery-greens and effusive reds.
to… whatever this was. Whatever might be about to happen, the air between them laden with anticipation.
“I wasn’t asking so I could tell. I was just…” Potter stopped, sucking in one cheek. It made the  line of his jaw and the high slant of his cheekbone stand out. Draco cleared his throat, irritation flooding back tenfold.
Draco opened the stall and peeked out. The showers were in use and the rest of the bathroom was empty. He turned back to Potter and grinned.
Malfoy shoots Harry a wry smile. The flutters in Harry’s stomach apparently like it, because they multiply, and a contingent of them pop down to his knees as Malfoy steps nearer. Voice low, he says, “You’ve got two bathrooms, right?”
* * *
“You don’t have to go,” Harry started, but Draco was already walking away, disappearing behind his curtain. A moment later, the Obscurification spell came up, splitting the studio off from the entry, and Harry slipped behind the dressing screen to remove his clothes, studying the little shelf of essential oils, the rows of hooks on the wall for his clothing, the stacks of fluffy towels. Everything in perfect order. Like Draco, except when he wasn’t — when he let Harry see there was more to him.
Harry rolled back over and pinned me with a look. “Really? Can you?” I glared at him and he huffed. “Draco, you stare at my arse every time I walk ahead of you—”
“Well,
“It’s beautiful.”
Harry doesn’t think he’s been in the room for more than twelve minutes.
he’d said. And telling her about Draco’s magic would seem like a disloyalty of sorts, relating that by the time Harry left early Monday morning, he could feel it every time Draco touched him. That Draco sent pulsewaves of magic through Harry, accidental and flooded with so much prickly hope, it tied a knot around Harry’s heart; that Harry was fairly sure those odd looks Draco had begun giving him were because Harry couldn’t help but to mimic it, couldn’t stop his own magic melting into Draco from his hands and his kisses every time they got close.
“I made soup,” Harry says after a beat. Draco looks so calm. Unaffected, the way he does whenever he’s truly frightened. Harry takes the blanket Draco hands him and draws it back around his shoulders. “It won’t be very long.”
Such a justification might have felt better, though, if the scroll hadn’t been a gift-exchange form.
Draco took a deep breath. “Why not?”
Draco arches an eyebrow, too dulled to even feel insulted. He supposes he’s in some form of retroactive shock. “I love my mother. I'd take apart anyone who hurt her. But I make my own decisions. I rather thought you’d learned that much about me by now. At least that.” Warming quickly, drowsy, he gestures back-and forth between them. “This would be a stupid position to put myself in if I felt I needed to watch you, no matter how cold I was. We can talk about the rest tomorrow.”
” he said, low and hard. He swung his finger to Harry. “And
Shaking his head, Harry pushed his jeans down, cool air washing over his arse. Malfoy’s cock was hard against his pelvis, warm and leaking. “I don’t,” he said, closing his eyes when Malfoy pressed their cocks together in his grip. “
never got scared enough to seek comfort from—”
“What are they for?” Draco finally asks.
Harry releases a sigh. He slides a hand into his faded pyjama bottoms, where his cock is pressing obscenely against the fabric, to find it’s already damp at the head. He swirls around the moisture gathering at his slit and thinks of Malfoy licking over his balls from behind as he’d bent shakily over the sink, one of Malfoy’s hands splayed over the small of Harry’s back, the other between Harry’s legs to wank him in an unhurried tease. He begins a smooth, fast jerk over his cock, aware it’s not going to take much even as he forces his fluttering eyes to stay open and on the page. He can practically hear Malfoy’s low, dirty voice in his head.
“No,” he says. “Honestly, I never expected it to happen at all.”
Malfoy swallows hard, lips thinning. “A— a dream, yes. But then I woke up and—”
Harry opened the door. The changes were immediately obvious: one of Draco’s smaller trunks sat open in the middle of the room; the photographs on his mantelpiece were gone; three of his bookshelves sat empty. Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach.
“Then.” Draco shook his head. “So. Hannah’s… where?”
Potter was going to take it the wrong way. Potter crowded him, jaw knotted, and Draco shoved him back a step.
“If you want—” Arthur began.
* * *
“You never said the appointment was for Harry Potter,” Zabini said. He shot Harry another curious glance, another swift smile, but the look he gave Malfoy was disapproving.
Weasley looked up at him, expression so pained and filled with pleading, Draco took an alarmed step away — straight into Potter’s chest, warm against his back. He turned; Weasley wasn’t looking at
The confusing flip in Draco’s stomach vanished, much to his relief, and Draco scowled. “Don’t insult me.”
It’s immaterial, regardless. Harry leaves the bottles where they are and sets the travel bag on the toilet tank, then crouches to check the wastebin between the toilet and the sink. It’s got some tissue paper with little blotches of blood as though Malfoy cut himself shaving, and a crumpled piece of hotel stationary that reads, in decidedly feminine handwriting,
between them, and then
“A mobile,” Harry says. “There are too many downed lines for a regular telephone to be able to transmit a call, but I think satellites and towers were probably unaffected.”
“I, ah—” Draco is so
With a sigh, you push him, it, out of your mind. Once again, it's time to rebuild. To move on with a  new life.
“Malfoy’s not an easy thing to get over,” he said. “But we’ve been trying. I didn’t— see it, until Christmas. That it was more than… trying your best to get along, making the most out of a shit situation. ‘Mione thought, maybe… Only I think it was hard for her to accept, too. He’s never apologised, not really.”
“Draco!” Harry yelped it, undignified in his startle as he whipped around and straightened. He found Draco’s gaze on him; the half of his face not covered in hives had gone deathly pale. Harry glanced at the tank only to see Fearful disappearing into the brush, and his shoulders came in. “I didn’t know I still could.”
, Harry. He was… awful, like how he’d been at the w— joining.”
“Reassessed?” Potter sat down without an invitation, tossing his book bag onto the table. Wary, Draco leaned back to study him. They’d shared the same classes for years and now shared a dorm room, but the way Potter kept approaching him in public over the last few days was decidedly… odd. And he’d never once come up to Draco in the library, before. He had to have an angle.
” Draco hissed, arching into Potter’s hand as best he could without unseating Potter’s cock from his arse. Potter pumped his hips a little, dragging his prick almost all the way out and pushing back in as he continued wanking Draco in that lazy, distracted way. True to his word, he kept his thrusts shallow, and what Draco’d meant as something that might drive
* * *
So Harry cleared his throat and only said, “Yes, I know him,” once more. Blushing, because he did. Because he had no doubt the look on his face betrayed those small intimacies and hundreds more, as well as everything he wasn’t quite ready to admit yet — every memory so deeply, intensely private that it seemed faintly voyeuristic for Harry to even think of them in someone else’s presence.
Biting back a growl, Harry went in — and instantly faltered. The room, so airy and open before, had shrunk down to the space  of a cupboard, hosting only the reception desk and a single chair, a blurry wall thrown up beyond that.
“What if—?” Harry stopped, unable to even consider posing the theoretical question on the tip of his tongue without feeling lanced through. He loved his job, was good at it, had always felt meant for it; being an Auror wasn’t something he thought he could give up. But: “Is that a dealbreaker? My job?”
“What are they?”
Potter shakes his head, unkempt hair brushing Draco’s face. “They’ve got to know… something, of course. There might not have been a sighting in awhile; they might think it’s safe,” he says, barely audible over the sound of glass breaking not too far away. “They might be scavengers who’ve let down their guards. It doesn’t matter. With that uproar, it won’t be long before—”
Harry took another look around — at the collection of things that could never make up a man — and let himself out.
“No,” Draco said, voice constricted, and Harry’s hand fell away from him. “I won’t.” There was another beat of silence, and then he pulled his wand from his sleeve and flicked it. The parcel he’d set at the bottom of the stairs shot into his outstretched hand. “An explanation, then. Well, come on.”
And Malfoy was back in those same trousers, too. Harry could see the shift of his cock through them when he moved. God, were pants out of style or something? If so, Harry couldn’t imagine that ‘polite society’ would approve.
“That’s true,” Goyle mumbled, still unhappy but no longer quite so crestfallen.
It wasn’t a kiss, in the same way Harry’d never be able to think of what they were doing as just sex; it was more like a fight, Malfoy biting at his lips until Harry wasn’t sure whose blood he was tasting, then sucking at Harry’s tongue, licking over it, pushing his own into Harry’s mouth. His fingers slid into Harry’s hair — a sting against Harry’s scalp when he tightened them — to keep him in place as their mouths met over and over. Coasting off each other, returning, hungry and violent and just the thing Harry needed. And then Malfoy wrenched his mouth away.
,” he said, making it sound in no way like a request, “take Potter to the back? He needs to leave in something delectable today.”
Harry yelped a laugh and rubbed his eyes under his glasses. He gave himself a moment to moderate his breath, then looked up and said, “No, just— I don’t want to fall asleep on you.” Except that he actually… might enjoy falling asleep on Malfoy. Fuck, this was bad. Harry laughed again. “So if we could—”
Draco eases off the desk. Some instinct has him backing him into the corner. He watches helplessly as Harry glares at the ground, then suddenly rips a metal drawer from the tall filing cabinet and throws it against the loo door. Harry shoves the cabinet onto its side, then attacks the one standing next to it, and anything else in his reach — he sweeps the desk of its electronics; he sends folders flying; he systematically decimates the office piece by piece until everything is shambles around him. And when the Inferi below are howling once more and there’s nothing left to destroy, Harry snarls with animalistic frustration and turns to slam his fist into the wall with cracking force, again and again and again, plaster dust fogging the air between them, and all Draco can do is… wait. By the time Harry wilts, what's left of the section of wall he's been pummeling is smeared bloody, and the Inferi below sound like they're rioting. Harry slumps, shoulders heaving. Draco unlocks his muscles and walks through the evidence of Harry’s devastation, careful not to trip.
hear the cheer that erupts from them, but he sees the shape of it from every mouth, and it matches the same cheer written, in silvery-white sparkles, across the air above everyone’s heads:
Potter looked suspicious. “And the way you wouldn’t take off your shirt?”
Potter frowns, but looks interested despite himself. "Could you do that
“What are you doing here?”
“You cut your hair,” Harry said. The glossy, pale curtain that had grown out near to his jaw was gone. He’d cropped it high on his neck but had parted it to one side and kept it relaxed, rather than slicking it back.
” and “
Malfoy exhaled through his nose, clenching a little. “Twenty Galleons per hour—”
Teddy and Andromeda were the first to migrate. Waiting as Ron and Hermione opened their presents, Harry watched Teddy wriggle in Andromeda’s arms, then barrel full-tilt for the hall when she set him down. Harry held up a finger and stepped away to see Draco kneel down in time to catch him before he fell over. Draco lifted him up, blinking, his hands curled firmly under Teddy’s armpits. Luna said something to him, and Draco blinked again and fit Teddy against his hip with a cautious smile. Teddy took his fingers from his mouth and poked Draco’s cheek under his dimple, which deepened, shiny with toddler-drool. The corners of Draco’s eyes creased. He shook his head at Andromeda when she held out her arms to Teddy.
Malfoy! I’m here, aren’t I?” He rattled the doorknob again, but it didn’t budge. “Don’t you take walk-ins?”
Draco opens his mouth to agree, but a simple ‘yes’ won’t satisfy, won’t explain his revulsion at the thought of fully releasing his magic, nor the longing he feels to do so. Not without telling Potter how their broom ride had felt, how those moments before his magic, forcefully pushed into Potter, had begun to drain. He’s never liked the act of lending his magic, an exercise overwhelming to the most highly trained Unspeakable and only rarely done. There’s usually far too much friction, but with Potter, there'd been something…
Narcissa bites back an inelegant snort. “Perhaps if I’d been raised in a barn and wore denim robes covered in chicken feces, you’d have a better opinion of me.”
Harry sighed as Ron went to fetch them. “I don’t doubt that they’ll find plenty of evidence of his other crimes over the next few months,” he said, “beyond the contract stuff. But—” Ignoring Ron’s little put-upon sound, he twisted and levitated the wand box on his bedside table over to Hermione. “I had him dead-to-rights on that, and I was counting on the fact that he’d choose being disgraced over being disgraced
, and Bill nodded.
—?” He laughed again, face so lit with joy that Harry took a step nearer to him, wanting to be closer to that look. Draco flicked his wand at the table of handbags and they zipped into a modicum of order; he aimed a flick at the cloak rack and the cloaks shuffled, a fast rustle of fabric righting on hangers, the hangers straightening on the rod. Then he directed that look at Harry and it was— it was even better than touching him had been, hotter and more satisfying, inexplicably more intimate. Draco’s voice wobbled. “
“Isn’t it a bit early to be so thirsty?” Harry asked.
“I used to think you were a horrible student,” he said peevishly one afternoon, after Harry spent thirty minutes arguing the significance of regional climates for matching components, “but when you’re genuinely interested in something, you’re—” He shook his head and got up from the table in a huff to filch a taste of the stew Kreacher was making on the hob, then absently hummed and stripped a stalk of thyme, sprinkling its leaves into the pot.
, he tried to say.
It was… surprisingly hot.
“Mm,” It’s probably as close to a concession as Harry’s likely to get. Draco plucks at the edges of his dressing gown, lifting his gaze heavenward. “You’re waiting for me to say something in particular.”
“Then you’re remarkably narrow-minded for someone who has spent the majority of her life in this world proclaiming that we are all the same,” Narcissa says. She limits all expression of anger to a single, arched brow. “I claim no surprise, but you should more carefully inspect the viewpoints you find yourself most automatically inclined to dismiss. Lucius and I shared far more in our years together than most couples will ever dream.”
“He’s in love with you,” Harry said — pushing the words out, not liking them, or the pity they induced.
Goyle sighed and Vanished the shirt that had cost Harry nearly eighty Galleons. “Sarah really liked that shirt. Take off your trousers and get on the pedestal. Can I call you Harry?”
Harry arched a brow, so smug I was tempted to punch him.
Harry jerks away. “I said just wrap it!” he hisses.
I’d look good in the dress, it’s the
He sat bowed over his desk, quill in hand, and was back in his casual wizarding clothes, tawny breeches and a loose, cream shirt, cinched around his middle with a sash. Harry looked from the curved line of Draco’s back to the robes he’d been wearing, discarded in a heap near the foot of his bed. Draco shook some excess ink from the quill’s tip, the white shock of its feather quivering through the air, and Harry eased into the room.
Hermione’s eyes softened. She picked up the container of food and resumed eating with tiny but swift bites. Between them, she said, “Thank you. But I’m still not discussing Malfoy with you.”
Draco scoffed and pushed at Harry’s shoulders, glaring at him disapprovingly when Harry snagged a last kiss, but returning the kiss all the same. His cheeks were bright red, and he stayed wilted against the reception desk for a few seconds, propped on his hands behind him as he caught his breath. “I have to— I’m not cancelling, but I’ll have to Apparate by yours in a bit.”
Harry blinks. Clears his throat to respond. Malfoy doesn't give him a chance to — drifting nearer.
right. She yanks open the door of her office and runs down the stairs, bursting into the corridor because she hasn’t fallen apart yet where people can see, she’d never do that to the students, and she has the splintered idea that the reminder of being in public might help.
“What, then?”
Harry pulled in some air and thought of the smile Ron hadn’t been able to repress when Hermione had stepped into him.
Still, it’s not as if he can ruin the clothes by putting soap on them. Draco blows out a breath and works swiftly, getting each item thoroughly wet before drizzling them with shampoo. He scrubs them out, gooseflesh rising on his arms as he dips them back into the chilly water to rinse out the foam he’s raised. Potter’s boxers and socks are part of the bundle, and Draco can’t help glancing over his shoulder to check for him, as though Potter might be standing there with a raised brow as Draco washes his undergarments, but Potter is still patrolling along the shoreline in the distance. Draco cleans the items as well as he can and wrings them out, then lays everything flat on the rocks to start drying in the sun. He slides off the rocks into the water.
“Mm. Yes. Well, then, tell Rose I said hello.”
she'd reasoned, which made a certain sort of sense at the time. He'd stored everything in the attic, but even if he brought them back out, it wouldn't be the same — Sirius was gone. Everyone was.
“Worse,” Draco snapped, nodding when her laughter choked off. He cut her off before she could ask. “What did you put on my form? What should I expect?”
But as it turned out, Hermione wasn’t close to any sort of solution at all. Within two days, Malfoy Apparated to Grimmauld Place, Narcissa clamped to his side.
“Belong with me,” Parkinson said.
Funny how long it’s taken him to acknowledge that they might be missing.
, Harry, and then we can— do
Harry knew it, and he still stared, until Malfoy’s smile faded.
Ron whistled, long and low, through his teeth. “I’d wager Robards didn’t take that very well.”
“Soon.”
“She wouldn’t even let me apologise. She deserved so many apologies, but wouldn’t let me. I pushed her away, like I did so many people back then,” he says, covering Draco’s hand with his own. Holding it. “I pushed her away and hurt her, and she told me she’d understood. I still felt— I still loved her. But she’d fallen in love with someone else by then, and I didn’t want… She asked me to stand for her at her wedding.”
“He is not waking up when Kreacher came back to tell him that his letter is not posting,” Kreacher said, “and when the clock is striking six, he is having new marks all over, and Kreacher is not being ables to ask Master Harry for helps, Master Malfoy has said, and—”
When the bottom of the sun nears the horizon just to their left, Potter stops him with a hand to his wrist. Draco looks around. Eyes on the road directly in their path for most of the day, following Potter’s body cues, he hasn’t paid attention to much. They’ve kept to side streets, near the walls of buildings, turning corners at a careful pace and slipping across bridges between abandoned automobiles. They've had to jog sometimes and slow others, but it still seems that they’ve managed to put some real distance between themselves and whatever happened behind them. They stand on a roadway now, green shrubbery on each side, idle vehicles on the street.
Harry dispatches the first without difficulty, its large, jiggling arm, nearly purple with post-mortem bruising, falling harmlessly to the ground even as it reaches for him. Then Harry swings his machete in a wicked arc to the side, inward, a hard slash
, the few one-offs who’d given interviews before he’d stopped visiting wizarding clubs were brought up at every opportunity; hell, the time he was spotted buying tofu for
Draco considered what admitting, “I thought to trick you into telling the truth because, yes, maybe I thought you might be shelling out sex as gifts or pity,” would ultimately get him: Potter sliding out of the bed and fucking off. “Because I was nervous,” he said, conscience not even whimpering.
“From what I’ve heard, Lucius went mad in Azkaban. You’ve had years to accept your marriage is—” Her voice shakes a little, then firms. “—over, and even if that wasn’t true… No. I don’t think you feel love the way the rest of us do — no. There’s no comparison.”
“Harry, what’s going on?” Ron asked.
“Not too complicated. Not for me,” Harry said, closing the distance still left between them. Draco stayed pliant for the arm Harry slipped around his waist and, feeling his way, the apologetic kiss Harry pressed to his jaw . Harry carefully fit them together, and let out a breath when Draco reached back to rest an idle hand on his hip.
“Right, and the twenty Galleons you made me slide the maître d was because they’d lost yours,” Harry snapped, returning the poisonous look Malfoy shot him with one of his own. “Do you mind telling me what’s crawled up your arse and died today?”
And still, no one wanted to believe them.
Outtake Three:
Harry chuckled, gratified by the quicksilver smile Draco shot him. “Sorry you had to postpone your plans.” Something complex flashed in Draco’s eyes, and Harry hesitated. “Seriously, though. I’d— I’d like to know.”
“They don’t like it,” Robards said, the curve to his moustache disappearing. “It looks bad for the Ministry; it will ruin your chances of getting my spot. And since I refuse to retire until someone I trust is locked in, that means another five years for me. It’s a choice that’ll end badly, son.”
“Depends on what you mean by that.”
Still, Draco flew as aggressively as he ever had, clipping Potter’s broom with the tail of his own whenever he could and flying into him to knock him off-course when he was closer to the Snitch than Draco was. He had no choice really, but couldn’t deny the thrill that flooded him each time Potter had to right himself in his seat, each time Potter snarled with outrage.
“Yeah,” Harry says, glancing at the clock. Little creases around his mouth appear, the glimmer of a smirk. “Sixteen minutes is progress, I suppose. I wagered you’d be in there for twenty.”
The solicitor was Summoned via Floo call; Harry’s attempt at a Patronus had barely wisped out from his wand — ghostly, unformed. Ron trudged upstairs like an old man, one hand on his lower back, to fetch his father and Bill. Luna arrived moments later, pale and windswept and more serious than Harry had ever seen her; Harry could only suppose Malfoy had sent an Owl before leaving the Manor.
Harry thought of that, of Draco young and arrogant enough to mount a full-sized broom, to think he could control it. Thought of his pointy face, rounder, fuller, like a toddler's. He smiled. “It, uh. It looks like a crescent moon.”
But Draco was listening intently — head still cocked to one side, his eyes thoughtful on Harry’s face — and Harry was overcome with the urge to just get it out, the thing he’d tried not to think about, the thing he'd been sure he never admit, to anyone. He swallowed. “It was just… all the same. Everyone watching. Waiting for me to do something miraculous and meaningful, or at least fail spectacularly trying. Wanting me to do what they
I’d not even have a seat at my own table—”
“She came up with the recipe,” Potter murmured, still gazing at him in that odd, contemplative way. He shook his head, straightening his glasses. “My aunt had all her books.”
“—Yes, very much like Harry, although I feel confident in saying he doesn’t dress anywhere near as well. Anyway—”
He felt a bit idiotic for not having realised sooner, though it did seem to fit the natural progression of their relationship up to that point: wary, unspoken allies after the first time Harry entered his medical care, both of them in training and determined to remain professional; tentative friends after the second when Harry’s slashed femoral artery dictated a deeper intimacy of care than his concussion had, and they were forced to choose between awkward and total silence or learning how to soften their interactions with one another.
Draco’s voice remained low, though they were the only people in the exam room. “I apologise, all right?” Scribbling his signature, he tore the parchment from his clipboard, and handed it over. “It was a stupid impluse, and I regret doing it. I’d hoped you wouldn’t remember, but— It won’t happen again, okay?”
Malfoy blinks several times, then adopts the same cheerful tone Harry attempted; Harry tries not to feel sour when Malfoy pulls it off better. “Of course! You know, I’m rather glad you let me know he was with you, I haven’t spoken to him in a few days. I nearly firecalled him at home tonight. I’d certainly have felt silly then, wouldn’t I? Move aside, Potter, and I’ll come right through.”
Harry breathes that in. Observes Draco’s agitation, his small, wordless squirm. Something settles inside him, curling peaceful around the knowledge of his own, frightening capacity for violence. “Then why don’t you want me to see?”
“He was trying to shove his hand down the back of your trousers!” Ron sputtered.
“A vigilante?” Harry asked. She stared at him, and he shook his head. “No. Someone with a vendetta, though. Yes? And they’d have to be in the Ministry, right, because they’d know Draco couldn’t talk.”
“A little more humiliation could hardly hurt matters then, could it?” Harry said. “Are you off work tomorrow?” he asked, and felt the ripple of Draco’s shock.
The thin layer of gravel covering the rooftop crunches under Draco's footfalls. He hesitates again when he reaches Harry, but at last lowers down to sit beside him. Harry takes a conservative sip from the bottle of water he offers, mostly to show his appreciation for the gesture, and then drinks deeply when it makes him realise how parched his throat has grown. He sets the empty bottle in front of them.
“No, but—” Malfoy frowned and leaned against the side of the desk. “I should have thought of that. You should have one. And I actually know someone who—”
“What the bloody—?”
Draco nods at the truth of it. Magic has been intrinsic to his sense of self for the majority of his life, and now he's set it aside in favour of survival.
“Based solely on my experience sucking your cock, I assume we’ll both come.”
“Maybe— Maybe you can sense them because they can sense you,” Harry says. His tone is detached but there's a disturbed crease to his forehead. “If they’re drawn to purebloods. They congregated in the wizarding section of Paris; maybe they’re acting on orders to collect purebloods, and it creates some sort of internal alarm in them.”
The thick line was ripped in the centre. A slender limb split in half. Draco stared, jaw flexing silently. Colour leached from his face, his body unnaturally still. Then he gave a slow nod. “It’ll repair itself, soon enough.”
Pushing to his feet is a struggle with nothing to prop himself against but Harry manages it, a vague sense of urgency swirling around him, bitter as the wind. On his feet, he sways for a moment and takes stock of himself. Though his feet are cold, they don’t feel as icy as the rest of him, insulated by his heavy boots. But his robes are soaked through, and that’s telling: standard-issue Auror robes are charmed to resist the elements.
He takes Draco’s foot in his hand, skimming his fingertips over the arch until Draco’s toes curl, then starts kneading gently.
” Hermione said, dropping her utensils on her plate. Cheered by the clear exasperation on her face, Harry laughed and looked at Ron, who popped three chips in his mouth and quirked her an unrepentant grin. Hermione rolled her eyes and elbowed Ron, but the look she shot him was fond and warm. “Hush, or you’ll end up with your own problem — with a capital P,” she said warningly. She turned back to Harry. “There is a point to be considered about your image, that's not wrong.”
, and he was

“What?”
leprechaun gold never vanishes. Nor does it fade, or stain, or scratch. There’s an old cautionary tale in my mother’s family of someone in our line who ran away with a leprechaun,” he mused. Then, under his breath: “I can’t believe I’m going to see her, soon.”
Harry licked his lips, his mouth a wasteland of dry heat.
Draco tries to catch his breath. He’s soaked through with sweat and the moaning refrain from the halls seems never ending. It makes him dizzy. He can’t seem to orient himself, both nightmares warring in his mind simultaneously.
Harry tries the door. It slides open several inches — soundlessly, thank fuck; he doesn't know what he'd do at this point if the hordes came crashing in through the hotel room door at the opposite end of the room. He can hear them out there too, the eerie echo of their moans in the hallway just beyond the thin protection of the walls.
“—and your erection tents your robes after every one of our meetings.”
There, Lucius cursed and stalked away from the table, robes fluttering. If Harry had been able to feel anything other than humiliated wrath in the moment, he might have been curious about why Lucius chose that moment to leave — or wondered about the smirk accompanying the flush on Malfoy’s face. And then Hermione decided to make things even worse by saying, “But there! Compatibility, fertility! Two wizards can’t— um.”
“You would have said yes,” Draco says. “If I asked you to dance.”
“Offensive?” Draco’s eyebrows lift of their own volition.
,” Potter says, looking confused. He glances over his shoulder, then back to Draco.
“That’s—” Draco scowled, staring at Harry like he was daft. Harry preened, and Draco’s hands drew into fists. “Bugger off. You got what you came for; you’re getting nothing else.”
“What elves
Harry sought it again, breath coming in short, ragged bursts, punctuated by Draco’s panting. He managed a lick over Draco’s lower lip, a kiss against his jaw. Draco squirmed, kissing him back and pulling away, clutching at Harry and pushing at him. He grazed the shell of Harry’s ear with his teeth and gasped, “I suppose this means you thought about it for more than a few hours,” then kissed Harry once more, even harder. Harry rolled his hips in answer, grinding slowly against Draco, excitement shivering through him when Draco untucked the back of his shirt, warm fingers slipping up the dip of Harry’s spine. Draco kissed his mouth, his cheek, bit at his neck and traced the cords of it with his tongue, and between all of it, got out, “Potter, I have— someone under meditative charms and— I think we’ve—
“You should be. If Blaise had decided you might upset Greg, we’d have had to go to Paris to get you clothed.”
“Had to Apparate a couple of times,” he says. He limps towards the tent.
Sirius’ grey eyes upon him, evaluating, understanding.
“This way,” Draco said, “fuck me like this.” He tucked his face into the crook of Harry’s neck and rutted against him, his cock skating wet tracks over Harry’s belly. “
He Summoned his wand and cast a
Sighing, Harry looked around at the furniture in varying states of readiness: another sofa that hadn’t been filled or covered yet, a homey kitchen table sans chairs, a bed frame styled out of rich mahogany, the intricate pattern on the headboard only partially carved. Near the back of the workspace were the shelves where Ron kept most of his materials, the tables where he drafted his ideas. Harry felt a sudden pang of sadness at the memories that flooded him — he and Hermione sitting around those tables before life got busy, eating pizza or curry and listening indulgently as Ron talked about his plans. His shop had been open for four years running, something Ron never seemed any less surprised by, though Harry could still remember the shine in his eyes when he'd first tentatively brought up leaving Auror training to pursue this; Ron was astonishingly good with his hands and had grown up watching Arthur add onto the Burrow and craft furniture for their family out of mere scraps.
“Who the fuck are they serving?” Harry breathes.
“Well, the two of us, for instance,” she said with a gentle wave of her champagne flute. “It would have worked well in his favour — my family’s reputation is solid, our vaults secure, and he knew I’d give him freedom to live as he wished after we conceived — but he broke our betrothal contracts regardless—”
But Harry barely heard the second part. He glared at Paul and shook him until his hand fell away from himself. "If your bad behavior makes yellow-hair— Er, Draco stop frucking me again...!"
Potter hummed, sliding his hand into Draco’s bottoms instead. He folded his fingers around Draco’s cock. Pulled it. Draco lost his breath and fucked into Potter’s touch.
, crowded there with everyone else’s — except for Fleur’s, which pointed at
Incredibly dim after the bright sunlight of midday, it took Harry’s eyes a few moments to adjust and when they did, his jaw dropped. He turned to Malfoy, found himself being watched with a look of mild amusement, and grabbed Malfoy’s sleeve to drag him closer. “This is a
“I don’t know yet,” she says — too hurriedly. Harry opens his mouth, but she keeps going before he can say anything. “We
He’d taken a week of holiday time, Harry found out at work on Sunday. Draco had gone to Paris.
A tiny smirk plays with Harry’s lips and, narrowly, Draco studies him. He’s let himself get too used to interpreting Harry’s expressions through the beard he’d been growing, and its absence keeps throwing him off. Newly shaved, Harry’s face is darkly tanned from mid-cheek up and pale lower down; the whole effect implies shadows where they don’t exist. But Draco does note that Harry avoids his eyes as he makes his way to the window, favouring his healing hip. Harry tweaks the curtain aside, looks out for a moment, and sighs. “They’ve almost doubled overnight.”
me, Mr Potter,” she said, following closely behind him. “I believe you need a warrant for—”
“I think—” Draco clears his throat. “That's probably enough.”
questioning how much of an asset I could be to the Ministry when my name got in the way of my job… Well, it got a lot of traction,” Harry said. He looked down at his plate, stomach suddenly churning. “And whenever I go to public events, I stay on the sidelines, or I’m accidentally rude to some diplomat—”
* * *
Harry admits, something akin to panic rising in his belly, a chaotic flutter he hasn’t felt in years. At some point long ago, he learned to detach from caring about or expecting too much from anything or anyone but those few people who've always been by his side. And even watching his teammates die, even knowing how fucked everything is, nothing since has come close to shaking him the way the vulnerable arch of Malfoy’s feet in white socks do.
Draco closed his stance and reached between them, filling his hand with Potter’s prick. It was hot, wet, slippery at the slit, and Draco thought of how Potter might respond if he toyed with him a bit, but then two more students came in, talking loudly above the sound of both showers, and Potter’s exasperated sigh warmed Draco’s cheeks. Draco grinned and fit Potter’s prick between his thighs.
Draco squinted groggily at Narcissa. “Mother, what are you doing here?”
“What matters is that we’re working together now,” Granger says with a tiny smirk, sitting back. She crosses her legs and sets her hands in her lap, her pose elegant and relaxed.
“Became friends?” she asked. Harry nodded, though it wasn’t what he’d been about to say. “No, that came later, with the letters. It’s very hard to be friends with someone who’s holding you captive,” she said seriously, “even when you have the sense he’d prefer not to.”
All of it was Harry’s fault. He’d been the one to ask Hermione to make sure the Malfoys couldn’t force Draco into an additional marriage; the idea of such a standard predating the contract hadn’t occurred to anyone until then, Bill had told him once they’d all stopped talking over one another. And everyone had been over the Malfoy and Potter histories a hundred times, a thousand, so it had taken almost no time to examine the contracts executed before Harry and Draco’s — and then Hermione had thought to look for precedent among the Black family, on a whim. One lineage as good as another, as long as it applied.
It's like taking a
“I didn’t need to be,” Pansy said. “I know him.”
, except that one would never do, because Draco would want to know why it was relevant. He lifted a shoulder and said, “I’ve never been able to figure out Hermione’s reasons for doing things,” blood rushing a thunder in his ears, as loud as the night the Thames overflowed. "Maybe she's decided to…" He couldn't finish, but Draco seemed to read his mind.
Harry heard Blaise clear his throat, and Theo and Draco broke away from one another. Blaise slanted Harry a swift glance, and gathered Draco into another embrace, this one blessedly shorter. He pulled back and Harry looked at Theo with a sense of crawling dislike, only to see Theo returning the look in spades. Harry’s jaw hardened, and he turned to Draco to keep from doing something stupid.
Harry hikes up his good shoulder defensively. Draco observes him with the disconcerting realisation that nothing less than the end of days would have brought them to each other’s bed. He probably should have known as soon as Harry finished speaking to Granger that it would precipitate a change between them, but finding out his mother was alive, the confirmation that his father wasn’t… His instincts have been off. Evidently more than he realised.
Whatever concerns Sirius had regarding his life turned out to be unfounded, Harry’d thought. Hermione had been the only one to echo them in any way, easy enough to brush off. Harry had loved the stillness Sirius so disliked, and when he needed more, there was always something or someone to occupy him.
you?” Draco asked. Instead of replying, Pansy
Harry nods. He’s got more experience than he should, absorbing a hit he’s jumped in front of, and it’s automatic at this point to take stock of the damage:
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised though he couldn’t say why. “Congratulations.”
, he'd explained. He’d paused to allow Harry time to comment, keeping it a conversation.
Draco’s hand moved, slid down. Then he poked Harry hard in the spine and Harry started, barely refraining from dropping his glass. He turned to the others, flushing; not only was MACUSA’s Deputy Commissioner of Commerce staring at him with an indulgent smile, three other people he didn’t recognise were exchanging laughing glances.
“I enjoy winning things, yes, though I’m fairly certain that title still belongs to Flitwick,” Draco said, looking Confunded when Harry let himself laugh. Why not. Harry broke the seal on the scroll, and Draco gave a little cough, the flicker of his smile dying. “Well,” he said, sounding more subdued. “Perhaps that’s your answer, already.”
, his shoulders drooping further with each upward step he takes. “Yeah, no problem.”
. He had half a mind to spend the holidays in the shadowed, vacant Manor, rather than be subjected to any more of Potter’s nonsense.
“It will.”
“Well,” Draco says as they start walking again, “we’ve not found any bodies. All of the vehicles are empty; people have been running. Do you think they’d leave their one communication device behind, even if it wasn’t working at the moment?”
This pause is longer; Granger resolves it with a hiccuped breath. “Um, he’s—” She stops. Continues. “We don’t have much longer, and Malfoy should get to speak to... The— the call, Ron’s— helping with spellwork. He can’t talk, but he— he can hear, so…” She trails off.
“How ill-mannered I am in your imagination,” Narcissa murmurs, lips twitching. In truth, she’d not been conscious enough, dizzy from the blast of Ronald Weasley’s magic slamming her into the Floo as the Inferi began converging on him. She can still feel it when she searches, a strange, hot knot around her magical core that shares too many properties with her own magic — but is unaligned, somehow — to make the knowledge of its presence very comfortable. It’s probably due to their distant familial connection. Narcissa prefers not to contemplate it, nonetheless.
And Draco'd got defensive. He probably called it something else, but Harry's stomach lurched, thinking of it. How cornered he must have suddenly felt, when he'd anticipated an entirely different morning.
“I needed some time,” Draco says simply. “To think about whether I should put them on.”
Harry nods and reaches to take the bead back, but somehow instead covers Draco’s palm with his, the soft leather of Draco’s long, gloved fingertips brushing the inside of Harry’s wrist. For as much care as they take not to touch during the day, the craving is always there now, for some reason worse when Draco allows Harry glimpses at the way his mind works. Harry would wager half the contents of his vault that Draco was remembering the exact layout of Hogwarts, his face raised to the sky, Harry’s wand held aloft. He suddenly remembers spotting Draco once in Fifth year, cloak spread beneath him on the empty Quidditch stands as he’d laid back against them, circling his wand above him. Plotting something, Harry’d assumed — and was probably right.
“You haven’t needed nearly as much help as I assumed you would. As you thought you did,” he said. “You could run for Head Auror and have the position in a day, if they don’t give it to you outright.”
Harry glanced at the items scattered on Draco’s bureau and sucked his lips in. Bit down on them. “Please prepare our meals for four today. Thank you.”
Yes, it’s true! The whispers following our Chosen One over the last several weeks have been substantiated — by none other than Harry Potter himself! Notoriously private in regards to his personal life (as his repeated threats to sue this very publication for libel can attest), Potter has decided on transparency for the first time since his relationship with Holyhead Harpies Chaser Ginevra Weasley ended in 1999. We at the
things with a total disregard for your privacy? Shut up!”); and he wouldn’t commit in any way to being Harry’s plus-one at the gala, no matter how many times Harry brought it up (“Stop whinging about it and put your mouth to good use—
Numbly, Harry shrugged, though Draco wasn’t looking at him. He should be feeling glad. Relieved. As the events of the last twenty-four hours had proven, their isolation could have dangerous results. At least now they could Summon a Healer if one of them got hurt; that was good. But it all felt a bit too much like it had when he’d been told of the contract, like when his name had flown out of the Goblet of Fire — like something that could happen, only to someone else.
Potter.”
“Take it,” Malfoy said, “or don’t.”
“It feels a lot better,” he murmurs, looking at it. “Thanks.”
“That’s it?” It wasn’t nothing, but Harry’d half-expected Malfoy to demand a look inside his vaults before quoting a price.
“Leaving?” he suggested, shooting a pointed glance at him before examining the parchment again.
“Ah. You could have Owled.”
, to have set such a limit?
Draco takes the phone with a small, shocked bleat. Harry faces him, takes in the look of his white face. He wants to leave, to mute the buzzing in his head, to walk to the centre of the dying meadow and away from someone he can't help but trust, and
And, well, that was surprising. “Congratulations. He’s not gay, then?”
Pansy, who used her last breath to protect him. To tell him she loved him.
“But we don’t get on,” Harry said, confused.
Shuddering, Harry tried to hold off the tide of his oncoming climax, grinding his pelvis against Draco’s arse with tiny, hard ruts of his hips to hit Draco’s prostate at the angle he wanted, hypnotised by the sight of Draco’s hand working swift over his prick — but it was no use. It crashed over him, inevitable, Draco’s skilled inner muscles rippling around him even before Draco’s own orgasm began, a pulse of sensation spasming around Harry’s cock. He started coming with a wordless cry, jerking himself out to watch himself spill over Draco’s hole, inarticulate with the need to mark him in some way, and then shoved back in to flood Draco’s arse with spunk, to ride out the waves of his orgasm; flawless; consuming.
Potter stirred under him, yawning. “You didn’t hurt me, if you’re worried about that,” he said, sounding sleepy.
Turning his head, he smothers a curse. A dog, a fucking
— had weaponised their thorns within an hour of Nev’s arrival; a defensive measure they took when they were in danger of drying out, Neville told him later, and one he’d thought was a myth.
“Mother,” Draco says without inflection. It’s revolting. Impossible. But he hasn’t heard her use that tone in years, and the last time was in response to Bellatrix's needling implications that she was considering taking Draco to her rooms to toy with him in private, that final, wandless night he spent at home in seventh year:
“No, we’re just—”
Harry met his eyes and swallowed. Pulled his fingers out, murmuring another lubrication spell. He lined up, and Draco’s eyelashes fluttered shut again, relief sweeping over his face as Harry pushed inside. Draco’s legs were too close together and he was about an inch too tall for the angle to be easy, but his inner muscles clung hot and sweet around Harry’s swollen cock, a solace all on its own to finally be inside, and Harry buried his face against Draco’s neck and groaned. Fully sheathed by the tight clasp of Draco’s body, he kept his pumps measured, deep, barely pulling away before sliding back in to the hilt, and found Draco’s bobbing cock with his hand once more. He let Draco’s instinctive back-and-forth fucks determine their pace and shuddered out muffled curses into Draco’s skin as he started going faster, the taut backs of his thighs trembling against the fronts of Harry’s own.
“You get so hard when I kiss you,” he whispered, husky against Harry’s lips, grinding atop Harry on the sofa in the parlour and thwarting Harry’s reply by slotting their mouths back together. “Your neck is sensitive,” he murmured, a gleeful light to his eyes as he skimmed down the cords of it with the blunt tips of his nails, and twisting them so it was Harry’s back to the wall on the staircase. “You couldn’t possibly be about to come again already,” he’d groaned, tightening his fist around Harry’s thrusting cock and pumping faster as they writhed together on the rug in the study.
Narcissa pats Rose's trembling shoulders calmly. A mother's touch. Hermione hears herself snarl as she steps closer for truer aim.
, Potter,” he said, with stiff, painful honesty. “I spent the first day trying to compose a note inviting you over again. When the Ministry Owl returned it — they do that, return Owls sent to employees who are gone and don’t have a return date, did you know? Because I hadn’t — I spent the next six wondering whether the next time I saw you would be like the last time. I hadn’t even been aware you’d got an assignment of that nature. Which is fine. Of course it is. But was I
“‘cause iss o-ay?” Harry hears Teddy mumble, probably around his thumb.
“We’re taking a break,” Harry said.
“Well you won’t be
“Right,” Draco said a while later when Potter pulled away to let him draw in a breath. He was still moving against Draco, still hard as a rock, but he didn’t seem in any hurry to pay attention to the importance of Draco’s silk underwear. Draco wrapped one of his legs around Potter’s hip, closing his eyes and matching him stroke for slow stroke. “What are we doing?”
too much, too perceptive, too close to the nightmares Harry never lets himself think about, and he means to step back, he’s sure of it. Instead, he helplessly cups Draco’s jaw. It’s an unspoken agreement that they don’t touch unless necessary, though Harry can’t find in himself any of the reasons he’s used over the years.
I've braced myself for death at his hand too many times. Of late, I'd convinced myself it would happen as result of his reckless courage in the field, from having to throw myself in front of him. I never once considered I'd be brought to the brink from the dazed quality to his voice, or his slow petting strokes over my rim. His almost polite, trailing enquiry as he massages it with his thumb.
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t take that on faith,” Harry said. Robards’s smile hardened, and Harry relaxed slightly; he hadn’t yet checked, but there had to be
“Which of us,” he asked, smiling, “is supposed to be the filthy little slut, again?”
“So easily distracted,” Draco murmured, pushing back against him. Harry kissed his jaw, felt the rasp of invisible stubble against his over-sensitive lips, and the flex of Draco’s grin, the crooked one that hid nothing, ridiculously precious. Draco made a low noise, almost sleepy, and said, “Well, then? Fuck me or finger me, we haven’t got all night.”
Rose buries her face back in Narcissa's shoulder. Hermione grits her teeth at the subtle triumph shining in Narcissa's eyes.
“I’m starting to wonder if you actually have a care for Draco’s life, anymore,” Ms Granger says, staring at her.
“And here I was under the impression you were aware I’m not very polite.”
Draco takes a breath. “Did you notice that she— it—”
A lamp flared to life inside. Harry kept pounding on the door. Harder when a pale blond glint of hair rounded the corner — only dropping his hand when the door finally swept open.
“So you’ve chosen theft,” Harry said uncomprehendingly.
over himself, and crawled under the covers.
,” came the same, calm — and frankly creepy — woman’s voice Harry heard the first time. He looked at the placard beside the door.
It comes with a final puff of air, the trembling sort that was, for two years, so common at Malfoy Manor.
“What—?”
Someone screams.
,” Harry mumbled. His mind was hovering in a half-dream state, Draco’s magic spilling through him. Draco stroked a circle in the spot and Harry became aware of a… a
“Did you have fun?” Harry asks at the first advert.
“You stop first,” he said, and moaned into Potter’s mouth as their cocks slid together.
right, Potter,” Malfoy said, voice dripping with disdain. He looked Harry up and down. “Not only have you made me turn away clients who probably won’t be back, you practically begged me for a wake-up call when you woke me up in the middle of the night.” He turned and walked towards the door but paused just before he got to it, twisting to look at Harry over his shoulder. “Don’t open the door next time if you don’t want to hear it.”
“You have so many more important things to do while you’re on holiday?”
I could quite cheerfully murder him where he stands.
I will be attending the war orphans fundraising benefit with Draco Malfoy. I will be wearing black formal robes.
“We’ve been here too long. Put the glove back on,” he repeats, an order this time. But his gaze runs over Draco’s body as Draco obeys, and his voice is rough when he says, “We can talk about it later. If you want.”
“What are we saving them for,” Malfoy asks practically, with another pointed nudge against Harry’s arm, “if not something like that?” He waits, patient and stoic in an entirely different manner than earlier, and Harry reluctantly takes the pills, once again feeling like a child who’s been put in place. Malfoy glances around their space with a nod. “Rest it up for a minute while I put everything away.”
“—all because of a silly little clause that mentioned an old familial blood curse, and— Oh.” Astoria’s gaze swerved from his, relief settling her shoulders. She looked at him again, smiled. “My apologies. Nevermind.”
a betrayal, doing what she must to protect their son after both of his parents have damned him.
to, but at least she was wearing pyjamas, and... this is what they’d always done. What they’d had to do far too often the past two years when things got bad. He supposed she couldn’t really help it.
Harry swallowed the last drops of his champagne and plunked the glass down on another floating tray. “I’m sorry,” he cut in abruptly. “If you could excuse us for a minute?"
Harry latched onto the excuse with a desperation he hadn’t felt in years. There was no spell and they both knew it, but… maybe there was. Maybe there was something they didn’t know, something making Harry so hard he felt half-mad with it, that gave him the ability to fuck someone he loathed. That made sure Malfoy’s erection didn’t wilt even a little, though Harry had pushed in with no consideration for hurting him, had
Draco stood. “Such effusive praise — coming from The Boy Who learned to cast a glowing, horny deer at the ripe age of thirteen — will be held close to my heart for an eternity,” he said, rolling his eyes when Harry snorted. But his smile didn’t falter. He held out Harry’s wand, thumb stroking lightly over the wood. “Here.”
Standing in the study where he and Draco had been forced to marry, where they’d fucked and argued and talked and watched the fire together, Harry had the bizarre sensation of falling through time — seeing his life as it might have been, without all of that.
“Of course not. But did you think someone willing to tear their soul apart would not have other contingency plans in place?” Naricissa asks, fitting a calm smile onto her face. She waits for the shock to bleed from Granger’s expression and, when it doesn’t, laughs softly and prompts, “I would take it as a personal courtesy if you refrained from being so unforgiveably stupid in my presence.”
“What crisis are you having
“I’ll make you forget for a while,” Harry says. Draco closes his eyes, and lets him.
I think it quiets down outside sometimes. I haven’t— haven’t been paying particular attention,” he mutters.
Malfoy glared at him. “Yours?”
“It’s not as if I’ve got him tied to my bed,” Draco said, sounding bored. “Today.”
“And Rose?” Minerva asks, frowning when Hermione flinches. She suddenly leans forward, resting light fingertips on the surface of Hermione’s desk. The compassion on her lined face is painful. “Hermione, I will of course take upon the role of acting Headmistress if you are too distressed to fulfil the duties which have been bestowed upon you—”
Draco swallows and shifts his gaze away, and the break in eye contact snaps Harry into focus. Face warming once more, he takes the bead. Swallows it. He taps the phone quickly with his wand and murmurs a location spell, then starts dialing even as he warily scans for movement around them and bears down on the internal, eager leap of his magic to contain it.
(Not too much. Not from the inside out. Harry likes the shine of his own come, low in the cleft of Draco’s buttocks, too much; likes the look of it, the tacky, slippery feel as he rolls back onto Draco, fitting himself along Draco's back.)
, or— well,
“We see each other all the time,” Draco said — flushed already, his magazine facedown on his lap. “I like my flat.”
Harry wanted to wipe the look off his face, however deserved it was. He sighed, ran his hand over the sturdy, fine-boned push of Draco’s shoulder blades. Seriously, he said, “So what you’re telling me is that you weren’t even half the tart Cormac McLaggen was.”
Harry didn’t know if Draco’s timeline consisted of the fifteen years between Madam Malkin’s and their first kiss, or only the years since they’d become friends. But he’d done everything Harry had asked, so far, his strain to do so shown only in the frustration that resulted in their fights. Harry's lungs tightened as he realised how little room he'd given Draco to breathe.
You wake up most mornings to Harry Potter at your side. Or atop you, or mouthing his way down your body. You fuck in bed, in the shower, and sometimes in the supply cupboard at work, on your lunch break. You take the downgrade to your salary in stride when they transfer you back; you're so constantly saturated in Harry's scent, most Alphas are too intimidated to even meet your eyes. You accept an invitation to coffee with Padma and fill her in on the details, grudgingly warmed by her enthusiasm and support. It makes you four minutes late for a date with Harry, and he drags you to the pub Floo, takes you to his, and shags you against the wall next to his fireplace.
“He might cry,” Draco said matter-of-factly, slanting a look at Blaise as he, brows drawn down, continued to run his hands over Harry’s back and chest, down the sides of his waist. He took Harry by the elbow and gently away from Blaise’s wandering hands and said, “Groping him isn’t going to fix the shirt. Can we just get him into something new, please?”
against him now, when so short a time ago, he’d been freezing; it scrambles Harry’s thoughts. “I thought about doing this to you,” he says. He moves his hand to Draco’s jaw, thumb splaying out to touch his swollen mouth. Draco opens it wider and takes the tip between his teeth, sucking lightly on it. Harry gasps, “Yeah.
spoken,” she says grimly, and Hermione’s heart flutters. Minerva shakes her head. “I’m not sure I’m convinced as to whether or not she
“That presents a problem,” Harry said. The aftermath of Draco’s revitalisation, even just a few seconds’ worth, left him giddy. Sure. Like taking a sip of Felix. He huffed a laugh and rolled his hips once with a rumble of pleasure, but stopped when Draco managed to, somehow, poker up even more. “Because that’s the second thing: I need a plus-one for the gala Sunday night.”
“Yeah.” Harry tilted his head. “That’s why you came back, too?”
Malfoy levitated a black trunk from the top of one of the stacks. It was free of stones, but the wood — ebony, Harry thought — was decorated with elaborate carvings. Malfoy tapped it a few times with his wand. “I saw— that thing gone, dead. No longer in my house.” He swished his wand differently and the hinge of the trunk popped open with a fragile little click. Malfoy moved to the side to let Harry see the confetti of multi-coloured specks inside, glittery as stars, all smaller than Harry’s pinky-nail. Malfoy sifted them through his fingers. “Mermaid scales.” Harry must’ve made a sound, because Malfoy glanced at him again. “They would have been gathered. You can’t harvest mermaid scales from their tails without express permission, and no one ever gets that. But you can gather ones that have been shed; on the shore; in the water. They’re really rare. I’ve only ever seen them in pictures, couldn’t even go looking for them near the edge of the Black Lake because the water gave me hives. Why?”
“Tell me something about myself,” Harry says. Draco readily opens his mouth and Harry holds up a hand. He smirks. “
“If it’s possible.” Harry looked up. The disbelief on Draco’s half-damaged face was so extraordinary, Harry didn’t know why he wasn’t tempted to laugh, why it made him
Draco’s hand feels like an anchor. Harry says, “Do you think Ron is dead?”
“I know,” Draco said, with a distracted peek out of the curtains. “But I’ve got a Dark Mark, and I told you there would be complications, and I still have faith you won’t break your word by telling them before you’ve told me. You won’t, will you?”
Potter gave a bewildered laugh and looked down at the note. “‘Suit up and meet me on the Quidditch Pitch for a Seeker’s game when you wake’?” he read. “No, it’s pretty clear. What’s not clear is
Draco’s jaw flexes. He tosses his wand at Harry, who’s so startled he nearly fumbles the catch, and says, “How did you mean it? What did you think would happen?”
And if he’d indulged, a time or two, since they started working together, in fantasising about Draco’s distinctive shade of hair on the head his imagination conjured to bob over him as he wanked, at least that had been mostly accidental, and understandable: Draco was attractive; Harry was a man who was attracted to men. They were in close proximity on a regular basis and, ultimately, those instances didn’t have to mean anything. But since his cock had clearly decided it was fifteen again in the face of Draco’s allusions, he was starting to reconsider — and get more than a little sore.
“I have to say, the likeness is truly incredible,” said a low, feminine voice. “To how you looked back then, that is.”
“Soon,” he agrees.
“If you’re waiting for me to agree with the sentiment,” Draco says, an amused tilt to his mouth, “you’ll be waiting a long time.”
, yet you can't fight any longer.
" Your body is on fire, the corridor spinning.
It may not have been, but it was better than his previous gifts: three rather boring silk ties and a Slytherin tie clip. Well. The ties were fine, as such things went, and Draco liked the tie clip quite a bit, actually — it had small emeralds embedded in the coils of the serpent and the S in Slytherin. At least none of them were rotting meat. But those things could have been given to any student, or at least any in his House. The recipe was something he’d been struggling with for nearly two months, and he didn’t appreciate being made to feel defensive about it.
“Potter, your arm.” Malfoy reaches for it.
He stepped around Potter to the door of the stall and cast a drying charm over himself. His thighs and arse were more than a little sticky and he could use another shower, if he was honest, but not with Potter there. A cleaning charm would get him through, once he made it out alive.
“Fine.” Harry grimaced and started to push to his feet, but paused when Malfoy took a step closer.
“Think you can do it in less than ten?”
“Gobs of it,” Malfoy said, tossing a pair of worn joggers that Harry sometimes slept in to the
Potter shakes his head. “We lucked upon it,” he mumbles, swallowing his mouthful. “I thought we might have to sleep in the middle of a field, or break into a house.” His lips are stained dark, a streak of juice trickling from the corner of his mouth to his chin.
,” but pushes harder against him all the same, frantic, juddering ruts as the tension of Harry’s own pleasure rises with small shocks that radiate from his cock to all of his extremities. Harry comes with a small, choked cry, hips and cock jerking helplessly, the already-damp inside of his pants growing wet and warm and sticky. Malfoy huffs, a humid blast of air hitting the spit-slick side of Harry’s neck, and digs his fingers into Harry’s arse. He follows Harry over the precipice, coming so hard Harry can feel the throbs of Malfoy’s cock through layers of cotton and wool. Harry holds him tighter; he forces Malfoy’s head back and kisses him, fucking up against him until Malfoy finally goes boneless. He feels good atop Harry, skin heated, body comfortably heavy for someone so skinny, all of it
— here, when he most needs it.
Harry raised his head and Draco’s breath stuttered at whatever he saw on his face. His lips twitched, a smile breaking over them. He took Harry’s hand, brought it to his nipple. Hips shifting restlessly, cock rising and then slapping back down onto his stomach, he used Harry’s finger to rub the peak. Exhaled with a little hiss, drifting Harry’s finger over it.
“Well, of course you should!” Robards said with a deep chuckle. Much to Harry’s satisfaction, it rang with a faint unease. A question.
Bill shot a swift glance to Harry and nodded, but Draco lifted his eyes and said, “No, I’ll send Kreacher in with some tea and leave you two to catch up. I have something to attend to upstairs.”
“I don’t, either.” It was— tenderness, he saw now. The care Draco had kissed him with, the welcome, his touch on Harry’s face, all of it spooling together into something achingly soft inside Harry, an advancement from one thing to another. “It was a positive emotion.”
Then Potter grunted, shifting once more. He cupped Draco’s buttocks, simultaneously arching up and pulling Draco in. One of his palms slid up over the muscles on Draco’s back to bring him down, so Draco closed his eyes and went, plastering his chest to Potter’s and working his cock in and out of him as slowly as he could, Potter’s slippery, rigid prick pressed tight between them.
“He did, actually. Poured me a drink and encouraged me to take an extra week to ‘recharge’,” Harry said. “Apparently I haven’t taken any of my holiday time in the last few years except when I’ve gotten injured, and that tends to be frowned upon.”
Harry’s gaze lingered on the movement of his mouth. He hooked his foot around Draco’s under the table, tensing all over when Draco’s ankle twisted to keep it in place.
” That last he adds with a hypocritical jab of Draco’s wand in his direction, for emphasis.
He makes short work of breakfast, the kettle and the little pot that came with the stove hot in no time. He sniffs the steam rising from it appreciatively as he cleans out the empty tins he’s held onto for this very moment, and is reaching for the kettle when a soft shout comes from the tent. He’s barely aware of the clatter of the tins falling to the ground, wand already brandished and heart pounding even as he falls to his knees and lifts the flap of the tent in time to see Malfoy’s panicked body go still, his face bleached of all colour. Malfoy’s sat up, their blanket gripped tight in his fists, the wildness of his eyes fading slowly, and Harry hesitates, not sure what to say.
“Not the fun you had catering to your ego rather than telling me?”
“Hot today,” Harry said.
“Shove that talent in my face and you're going to get my cock up your arse for it,” Draco panted like it was any sort of threat, fucking Harry with one possessive hand around his throat as the room filled with potent scents like
“Malfoy— You. We should— We’re in the showers,” Potter said hoarsely. But he rutted into Draco anyway, folding his arms around Draco’s waist as though Draco were trying to get away instead of provoke him into sex.
It didn’t, shockingly enough, put either of them off their stroke. Harry choked a breathless laugh, and Draco shot him a mischievous grin, his brow still tight with building pleasure, his hips still rising to meet the thrusts of Harry's cock. All of it married perfectly inside of Harry: the violence between them, the play, the affection Harry could no longer pretend he didn’t feel, especially to himself. And none of it was something he had to resign himself to, or figure out, or fit together — it was uncomplicated simply because he
Banishing the shiver at the back of his neck, Harry said, “It’s just not— realistic. All of this,” he gestured to the files waiting, “for just one Auror.”
“Finish your food,” Harry says, standing. “I’m going to break down camp.”
“I—” Draco frowns. He clears his throat. “I trust you with my life.”
"Alright," Draco says again.
“Well, we’ve engaged in rounds of a few different things,” Harry says, heart knocking hard with gladness. “Which one are you referring to?”
“I guess…” Harry sighed and tweaked his glasses out of their tilt. “I guess I’ll figure that out if I have to. There are ways around getting their approval,” he said with resolve he hadn’t known he felt until the words were spoken. He laughed a little, incredulous, then looked down at his desk and collected a few of the files from each stack. “And yes, I’d appreciate it if you could reassign these. I’ve got used to sleeping more than two hours a night while on holiday, and think I’d like to keep that up.” He tipped Robards a crooked smile and held them out.
Draco blinks at him, slow and heavy, eyes veiled. They’re both hard, but neither of them seek any sort of gratification yet; they’ve learned how to savour their arousal, the way Harry thinks only longtime lovers might ever truly be able to appreciate.
Draco dumped the potions on Potter’s trunk and tossed the bowl to Potter wordlessly, frowning when Potter caught it; it was antique and had been in Pansy’s family for centuries. Potter disappeared into the small, attached loo and Draco Summoned a chair and bedside stand to the middle of the floor, transfiguring the stand taller and adding a scoop to the back of the chair. He set the potion bottles on the table. “Fill a pitcher too,” he said when Potter returned and set the basin, sloshy with water, down on the stand. Potter nodded and vanished back into the bathroom, coming out a few moments later with a pitcher in hand. He passed it over to Draco.
, maybe you should let him? But no, no, it’s all you can think, how wrong it would feel. Then another Alpha lunges, snapping his teeth — he gets a hex to his cock, and you shake off his angry hands on the whipping tails of your robes. Your next hex is weaker, your next shove. Too many Alphas work in the DMLE, and all of them can scent the sickness on you. All of them can smell the wet. You're running out of resistance, you just need to be
— and I found myself yanking Potter closer by the hips and flipping him so he was pressed to the wall instead. I couldn’t even say why I did it, except that it might give me the freedom to get away from where he’d pinned me. But even that didn’t work as any sort of excuse when the first thing I did was scoot us along the stones so I could blindly open the door to my rooms… where Potter promptly stumbled inside with me and lashed out with one foot around my legs to kick it shut, then hiked his knee up to my hip, his lips hot and intent on mine the whole time. I pulled out of the kiss with a gasp of realisation that quickened my breath.
“Potter—”
"Hey."
Ron presses his lips together. He nods, looking grim. "Yeah, mate. It was Malfoy."
Draco shoots him a glare. “Nothing, I said. I’m tired. Let me check your arm.”
“Hm?”
“Yes, I like it,” Harry says, feeling more than a little wrecked himself. “You did so good. That’s just how I want you.”
Death heads for Draco first, because he’s the closest. Harry next — and oh, how it's craved him — in less than thirty minutes, using the force of destruction it's been allotted to slash down every obstacle in its path. It will be in London with Ron hours later, and will work its way slowly up toward Hermione in Scotland, as she tucks her children into bed at night.
“But—” Pansy paused, gaze flicking over his face. “Oh. Oh, good. You have a plan.”
a hallucination. Maybe I’d inhaled some fumes from a toxic potion earlier — first years’ in particular were awful at listening to instruction. If one of them had mistook nightshade for nettle, I could very well be at death’s door. I lifted the hand resting at the small of Harry’s back and carefully poked him. He seemed pretty solid, but that might be the case if this were a death dream, right? I poked him again.
That seemed pretty reasonable. Harry shrugged. “What, then?”
This is how it should happen — and how it does, for a while. There isn't supposed to be anything else.
Harry fingers him deep, this man who taught him how deep love can go; he brings Draco near to climax with the sure, twisting pump of his touch, and lets himself say all of the things he’s been waiting years to say:
“I don’t know,” Harry said, refusing to follow her gaze until his heart had stopped beating so fast. “I don’t know.”
~ ~ ~
, and
A sizzle of heat exploded throughout Harry, and he took Draco's mouth as hard as he was taking his body, frenzied at Draco's immediate surrender to his kiss. Wanting him everywhere, and all the pieces of him too, and only pulling away to breathe — gasping, his forehead to Draco’s temple, his pulsing prick grinding deeper inside. Wanting him and being wanted by him — following Draco over the ledge, coming with him, letting go.
Hermione gave an apologetic sigh. “An idea.”
“Plus, Hermione said so,” Harry finished triumphantly.
“This is… bad.”
it could be like that. Lucius had always been so careful with her, so considerate, before, ensuring she reached her pleasure before he took his. But that day her arousal came to her not as a slow build, a sweep of crescendoing music; it came as the ocean does, calm one moment and tumultuous the next. She had been frantic for him, bursting with love for his concession despite his fear, for his courage. He let her press his back to the floor, let her roll astride him, a reversal of how proper wives ought to behave, and she rode him with sharp, hungry rocks of her hips until they were both covered with sweat, until they both broke like the waves did on the shore.
, do it? ‘Harry’ —
“I’m c— Yeah, just a
It’s taken weeks and Harry misses home, misses his friends. But his team, hand-picked for this mission, has worked hard and they deserve a night off. He’s got Portkey-activation discretion, no need to rush back. It’s only a couple of extra forms, and he doesn’t mind filling them out for the opportunity to buy a few rounds in thanks, to sit in a pub with his coworkers, to spend some time wearing his own face in a city small and far away enough from London that he’s not at great risk of being recognised. Harry takes a pull of his warm beer and relaxes.
His vision blurs, then clears as he breaks from a snarled thicket of overgrown hedges at the tree line, and Draco follows his feet north. The jostling weight of his pack slows him down but the bunch and release of his muscles verges on euphoric, he knows it so well, and the uneven terrain is as easy to negotiate as the stitch burning in his side, once he lets his body take over. The motorway they never stray too far from looms ahead in the waning darkness, promising a steadier path and a clearer territory on which to defend themselves if caught; leaning into the ache of his own propulsion, Draco pushes himself and hits the wet, hard-paved road so smoothly he doesn’t even need to correct his stride. He gusts out the last bit of residual darkness from his lungs and faintly hears a sharp, distinctive
Harry’s got a bottle of paracetamol somewhere in his bag, but they’ve already spent too much time in one place. The sun is almost directly overhead now, signifying noon — usually the safest time to travel — and he doesn’t want to lose whatever advantage they’ve gained, so he nods and takes Malfoy’s proffered hand when Malfoy rises, grunting quietly when Malfoy hauls him up.
“Pansy,
He closed his fingers around his own cock, first. He smoothed the lube over it, tugging, a low gasp torn from his throat.
Harry choked. “Kreacher—”
Draco’s stomach flipped. “Yeah,” he said again, and angled his broom just so. “But I’m a little busy right now.”
When Harry woke in the morning, he wasn’t surprised to find himself on Draco’s bed, though he’d had no memory of falling asleep. A chenille throw the colour of goblin wine had been draped over him, his trainers removed, his glasses. Beside him, Draco’s angles looked less cutting, but Harry saw his eyes open. “Sorry,” he said.
returned it, had done it first in fact, and several times since, and Draco didn’t know what the bloody fuck that meant. He thought of Potter’s shaky voice, Potter’s warm breath against his ear.
Not once in those first two weeks had Draco implied he wanted that, or liked it. But his hips stuttered now — because he liked knowing what got Harry going, or because of the words themselves, either way an acceptable outcome. His cock had hardened fully during Harry’s slow wank, grown heavier and thicker in Harry’s hand, and went suddenly slippery at the slit, easing the glide of his delicate foreskin over the head.
, but at this point Harry doesn’t really think such a thing exists.

G-E-T D-M-A-L-F-O-Y
—” Harry heard, his mouth full, Draco’s cockhead bumping the entrance of his throat. The skin over his shaft was silky, the length of it plump and twitching. Harry swallowed and covered Draco’s fingers with his own, gripping his cock with him. Lifting up, he curled his tongue along the length and licked into the bunched folds of his foreskin until the press of Draco’s fingers was painful enough to distract. Then Harry hollowed out his cheeks, sucking a twist around the head with a jolt of euphoric pride at the fresh slick of salt that burst over his taste buds, and at Draco’s groan, a ragged, half-laughed sob for more. Harry did it again, lips stretching as he lowered his head, and again, pulling hard with his mouth when he rose, and again, and again, and again.
“You’re the best person I know!” Harry said, horrified. “You and—”
“Then—” Draco broke off — and cursed, his words drowned out by the resounding
Harry placed his wrist atop Malfoy’s. “Dare to be predictable, Malfoy.”
Malfoy made an offended sound, glaring down at him. “I’m supposed to have a stake in the results? That’s not the way this works, Potter.”
“Nothing,” Harry said. He smiled and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”
“He just started crying harder when I reached for my wand to dry him,” Harry explains, spreading his hands wide. “He wouldn’t let me change his sheets, either.”
“I talked to McGonagall,” she said. “When the form first Vanished. She told me that whatever was written on them would be under the same strict confidentiality clause and none of the gifters would be allowed to tell anyone about what was on them. Even after the exchange was complete, because it included such personal details. So I just hoped that you’d… That you’d get someone who was decent. And then Potter came to my room to—” She squeaked and put a hand to her throat, whatever she was about to say catching there.
“Well,” Narcissa says, tipping her head at the closed door, “while not particularly bright, the guards you set upon me may eventually be asked for more context about this morning’s conversation. Though Mr Potter’s reaction to the unfortunate news and your dramatic exit currently overwhelm finer details in their daily report, we must take what opportunities we are afforded, mustn’t we? ”
“So,” she said cheerfully with a sickly-sweet smile, “Granger wrote that you needed to meet with me?”
, the act of playing the supplicant for someone Harry’d sworn, once upon a time, would never best him. But it was. Powerful and so fucking hot, Harry had to slow down the strokes of his hand over himself. He closed his eyes, the absurdity of the moment flashing through his head — how dangerously close he was to coming just from getting Draco Malfoy’s cock in his mouth.
“I won't believe it."
Harry jumped up, loosening his hold on Malfoy’s hand when his face creased with pain. “Malfoy?”
Harry finally catches his breath, eyes on the rippling of Draco’s shoulders and the paleness of his nape, before Draco lifts his head from where it’s bowed between them. Unwinding his fingers, he flicks Harry an oddly apprehensive look and scoots back to pick up the dish towel that’s suddenly on the island. He rubs it carelessly over his cock, his pubic hair, then folds it and attends to Harry in the same manner, as though Harry’s a puppy who can’t quite clean himself. He discards the towel and pushes Harry back a step, rising to pick up his dressing gown and Harry’s blanket. “We should rest a bit, I suppose.”
when Harry kissed him, and after,
and the quick slash of his machete revetebreing up his arm, and that had been it. But now… Seeing Malfoy this way, someone Harry associates so clearly with the
“What?”
for Potter to stay the whole night, and why he’s not once thought to object. Potter nudges him with something cool and smooth — an elixir bottle, Draco thinks — and without waiting for him to respond, says, “Yeah. I saw you’d dipped into the whiskey when I got up for a piss last night. Take this; Hangover Cure.”
Body wracked with tremors, he makes himself sit up. Every movement hurts, his muscles spasming and so sluggish he’s tempted lie back down — and might, perhaps, if not for… What? There’s something he’s forgetting, something important. He looks around. At first glance, all he can see is snow, covering the land, the trees. But then, in the white-grey distance, he spots a cabin, its windows lit up from within.
Auror, not that I'm confident enough to apply because I'm so sure the Ministry won’t hire me, even though I'm brilliant and would be fantastic.
Draco has no answer for that, and doesn’t think he could bring himself to give one if he did. Why
I wouldn’t,” Draco said, peeling off his cloak and gear as he ranted. He hesitated a moment before removing his shirt and jumper, but they were rather ripe, so off they came too. Discreetly, he sniffed under his arm, curious whether he ought to have a shower before they did whatever Potter brought them there for, and continued, “We have a very unique structure in place, we never do anything for another Slytherin without having something equitable offered, and if it’s something that could potentially be used in blackmail, that needs to be taken into account too, and a
“Good,” Draco croaked, pupils shot. His parted lips were bracketed by the barest creases of a smile. “I want you to. Take me to bed.”
“Staying?” Draco asked after another little beat between them. He glanced up at Harry and the tightness leached from his face. He huffed an unconcerned laugh. “Oh, the club. I forgot you even showed up.”
“What did
“Yeah. Yeah, Aurors do, too,” Harry says, looking back to him. “I studied Offensive Wandless Applications—”
The Inferi, running now, swerve away from Harry and towards him when he steps out from behind the bin. Draco hears Harry shout something at him, but there’s no use for protest anymore so he detaches himself from it. From everything else. His wand sends a shock of pleasure through his palm and up his forearm. He watches himself swing, and doesn’t drop his shoulder.
Narcissa’s eyes settle on the phone. It’s a 2007 Nokia, sheepishly offered to Hermione after a quick survey of the Muggle-born students. Mobile phones have been strictly forbidden from Hogwarts’ grounds since the explosion in Greenhouse 2 and subsequent loss of all of the Mandrake root and Dittany being harvested there back in 2005, but Hermione found herself ridiculously gladdened by the rule-touting in this case — enough to offer the Hufflepuff in question a hundred House Points, when and if they can get the hourglasses working again. It feels like a lifeline in her hand.
Harry purses his lips. “As a matter of fact, you were. Close enough, anyway. And I found out you were here and— you’re an Unspeakable,” he says. Malfoy’s eyes widen and he gives a hedging nod, which Harry copies. “They’re using Unspeakables at Hogwarts to— to see what can be done.”
s from an angry student hitting the door. He barely had time to whip his head around before Potter scooped him up around the waist, pausing only once to pick something up before hot-stepping them both toward the one of the showers.
were too brave a child to ever relate;
“Pardon me, Ms Granger, but I’ve attended enough negotiations in my day to recognise an offer when I hear one,” Narcissa says smoothly. There’s no trace of the rasp to her voice that would suggest this is the first time she’s spoken, and Hermione resolves to check with the elves later, to see if any of them have noticed her practicing; that could end up being useful. Narcissa gives her a benign smile. “The real question was left unspoken: What will I do for you to gain the privilege?”
“Harry, no; you’ve already—” Draco says, eyes widening. “And I—”
Well, Draco was going to.
“Get my shirt up,” Malfoy said. Mindlessly, Harry did, spreading the laces at his throat and wrestling the material to hook over Malfoy’s head, tousling the neat quiff of his hair.

Harry waits.
bike, the one he restored with his own hands, leaned against the outside of Madam Puddifoot’s —
Harry doesn’t hear his own cry, but he
He was training a class, he knows that much. Advanced duelling tactics. He remembers there'd been at least six people out of the dozen watching who'd got shamelessly aroused at his demonstration. Keeping such a thing secret is a futile effort; no one bothers. No one minds. Why would they? It happens. It's expected.
"In one way or another, I'm sure." There’s a subtle thread of panic in Hermione's voice, a hint of savagery like he’s never heard from her, and he can’t figure out what that means so he bottles up the questions crowding his throat and, as always, puts his faith in her. It’s enough to know she and Ron know things he doesn’t, whether or not they have time to explain.
He smiles at Kreacher with a shake of his head, mind turning back to Hermione as he makes for the street. He hates leaving for an overnight shift, though she’s understanding about how the extra work has been piling up, with Harry gone. But it did afford him with even more reason — as if he’d ever need an excuse — to turn his bossy, brilliant wife into a needy tangle of boneless, gasping pleasure. He walks down the street, whistling, and reminds himself to pay attention the next time Nev blathers on about his Most Extraordinary New Plant; maybe it'll give him a clue about what to buy as a thank-you for taking the kids out for a few hours before dinner.
The wizarding district in Paris is a bit bigger than that in London, but all it takes is one look to see that the streets have been ravaged by Inferi. Glass from broken shop windows glitters in the streets, lit by the few lamps that still have a working flame, and Harry can't feel the telltale buzz of wards over any of them. The air is colder here, too, and is oddly thick, a murky sort of fog, as if the necromancy that's soaked into the hordes has permeated every magical space. Maybe it has.
He smells like whiskey sours and sweat, like spunk and a cologne with sweeter notes than the one he uses. Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s damp, messy hair — purple-tipped this time, Harry sees, prettier with his moonlight blond than the green was — and says, “I’m not waiting up to let you in the next time you’re too drunk to unward the door.
“Are you sure about that?” Harry asked. He held his breath and tossed it to him.
Harry swiped some more ointment on his fingers and sighed. He concentrated on the blotches on Draco’s face as he went from one to another. He’d had hours and hours to stew on the matter, and hadn’t come to any sort of satisfying conclusion. He bit his lip, rubbing small circles against a welt on Draco’s cheek, just over where his dimple would be, and said, “Sirius — my godfather, Sirius Black—”
Harry slides back along the brick as furtively as he can, his heart in his throat. The tinkle-crunch of broken glass under his boots blares in his ears, but he can't let himself stop or he’ll lose momentum, can’t let himself think or he’ll talk himself out of it. He hikes a leg over the glass spiking sharp from the window sill, tucking his wand away. The showroom is filled with model brooms and he swallows hard, peering into the shadows to make sure none of them are moving as he eases his other leg over.
Harry scowled. “I wish.”
. “I was— scared, that night, walking in. But I came back out. And we’re not really in any danger from Acromantula; they moved to the opposite end of the forest after the battle. The Centaurs aren’t very friendly, but Firenze talked to them and they’ve agreed to go back to ignoring humans, so long as we don’t disturb their sacred spaces. Besides, it’s sort of peaceful here, doing this. Picking plants. Being useful, but in a small way.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, dropping his leg from around Harry’s knees. He slid his hands out from under Harry’s shirt and, with a touch light enough to tickle, up Harry’s sides around to his chest. He flicked a bunched nipple through Harry’s shirt with the pad of his index finger, and Harry hissed in surprise at the bolt of electricity it sent to his dick. Malfoy smiled. “The blanket,” he said, more seriously. Harry swallowed and let go of him.
He didn’t know what it meant that he had, that he could.
They rotated their hips together, a hard, slow frot through dampening cotton, just what Harry needed, and maybe Draco too. Harry’s muttered, “You’re gonna make me come, baby,” against Draco’s mouth sent a shudder through Draco, and he slid tight hands down Harry’s back to push into his bottoms — to massage his buttocks apart. Those fingers Harry never got tired of watching, of feeling on him, slipping into his crack, and the stiff, swollen length of Draco’s cock rubbing against his own. Rocking harder, Draco’s whimper felt more than heard against Harry’s parted lips. And then Draco’s hips juddering, desperate, precipatory.
Malfoy stood there, unease skittering across his face. The ball of his throat bobbed.
“That one you killed just outside Paris. I think she was headed for me,” Draco admits. “It felt like she was.”
” he said. “Just because your gifter’s given you socks every day—”
“Fine,” Draco said again, but faintly, because it most certainly was
“I’ll
“I already did,” Harry says. “Malfoy, I—”
Harry probably should have felt happier for Malfoy. For having a plan, for taking charge of his life. But his mind stuck on the word France for a second, the way it had on the bicycle when he’d first seen it — turning a whole country into a curious oddity, and one he had no way of fixing.
Harry squeezes his hand before releasing it, as stunning a disparity as the heat of his mouth which hasn't been so close since the rains began. Then, following his own advice, Harry pulls the machete from his scabbard and arches an eyebrow. Draco blows out a breath and pulls the scimitar from his own — not a wand anymore, though he’s grateful Harry had the presence of mind to call it that. It’s light, the hilt not only comfortable in his grip, but… pleased. Like a Crup waiting for approval from its master. Draco subdues his magic; he nods at the question on Harry’s face. Harry yanks the zipper down, and bolts.
Draco pulls to a hard stop and turns. He’s no longer being pursued, but neither is Harry anywhere in sight. He can’t make out much of anything beyond Harry’s absence — not the shape of Harry’s body lying helpless in the middle of the road or in the field he’s just run through, no corpse with Harry’s face following him. Draco’s rushing blood feels like poison spiking through his veins, his own, lonely pulse the worst sort of duplicity.
The bike glowed at him like a talisman, shiny as metallic eyes, the leather covering its seat and handles pristine and pale. The tyres were worn, and the rims a bit scuffed, the bike’s condition less perfect than the last time Harry had seen it, but — still beautiful, it was undeniably his.
“Come, lass,” Minerva says. She looks at Hermione for a long beat over her oval glasses, until Hermione is matching her, slow breath for slow breath. By the time she speaks again, Hermione feels calmer, and Minerva’s voice has gone crisp once more. “We should head to the infirmary.”
“We all got them, Draco,” Pansy said, sounding bored. Draco shot her a glare, scowling when she didn’t look up from the desk she and Blaise were huddled over.
It’d just be a means to an end, that was all. To ensure Draco was doing the best job he could.
Granger pauses. “And does that mean you can be bought?”
,” Malfoy sneered, though the colour of his complexion was still high. His tone ended the meeting, which at least gave Harry time to seek another opinion.
, no. Slower.
"I'm only—" Hermione swallows against the rise of bile in her throat. "Narcissa is right, darling. I'm very surprised, but I shouldn't have lost my temper. I'm sorry."
Hermione seemed to notice as well, because she turned to Narcissa and, through her teeth, said, “
“It’s different from what’s in the Muggle Studies cookbook,” Draco said, uneasy when Potter seemed content to wait for an answer. Potter laughed —
Through the flit of leaves, Draco can see Potter fussing about the camp from the corner of his eye. He doesn’t particularly want to rejoin him but forces himself up and back into his clothes. Their space is mostly cleared and packed away except for the tent and a few essentials. Potter looks up with a determined glint in his eye as Draco moves to break down the tent. Draco braces himself, but all Potter says, in an exceedingly measured tone, is, “Did you get a chance to look at the numbers Hermione sent?”
might apply for a dorm mate as well. Stupid Potter and his stupid towel and his stupid dirty feet.
“I don’t know, okay?” Harry sighed, watching as Draco approached with narrowed eyes. “Just tell me how this goes.”
“Yeah.” Shadowed, Draco plumps his jacket a little and settles with a jaw-cracking yawn. “You?”
“They can’t, but if it makes you feel better,” Draco said.
He waits for a second until I raise my eyebrows at the hob, then laughs and turns his back to tend the sauce. Thanking every deity I don't believe in, I take the opportunity to escape. I curse myself as I head down the hall.
“I guess that really does rule me out, then,” Draco said, snorting when Pansy pinched him.
“They’re coming,” Draco breathes. Harry nods again, lifts his head. They look at each other for a long beat and then Harry’s shadowed gaze snaps to the side, his body tensing. Draco listens, and can’t hear anything but the storm.
He wouldn’t.
They don’t speak through the maze of Hogwarts’ corridors, but Hermione can feel Minerva behind her with each step like an echo — her steadiness, her severity. She wants to say something. Hermione is glad when she doesn’t.
, and
“It’s fine,” Harry said. Because he knew Draco enough, and it was.
It’s as true now as it was then, but Harry has never been able to let himself rely on anyone the way he knows he can with Ron and Hermione, not even the members of his own team. He’s too used to taking point, the habit too deeply ingrained in him to allow for other people at the helm. And even Ron and Hermione are exceptions in only little ways: Ron with his practical use of logic, Hermione with her book knowledge. But for all intents and purposes, he and Malfoy are practically the only people left in the world — their world, at least. Whatever other issues Malfoy’s got going on in his head, feeling useless doesn’t need to be one of them.
At that, Narcissa blinks several times in a row.
“We can’t talk about— certain things out there, either,” Potter says. He clears his throat. “
Hermione pauses. It occurs to her that this is the first time she’s spoken to either of her children in well over a day, although she checked on them in their beds when she returned to their rooms last night. She swallows. “Just this morning. You remember what I told you, right? What I’m doing, what you’ll need to do?”
, and hauled Draco into a booth.
“It was the first time you looked at me the way you are now.” Draco twists his head, cheek pressed to his knee, and offers Harry a smile. “Not the last.”
“Did.”
Because they were friends, he waited on Harry’s faith — but was asking him to choose it.
. He blew on them, pebbling my thighs with gooseflesh and hardening my nipples, and nuzzled the damp crease of my thigh with his nose. So quietly I almost didn’t hear him, he said my name.
“It’s fine,” Draco said with a little snort, and Harry opened his eyes. Draco twitched him a sardonic smile. He returned to the chair, folding himself into it and doing nothing to hide the hard outline of his cock curving towards his hip. “You used a charm, remember?”
“Gryffindors?” Hermione guesses, laughing a bit when Minerva raises an eyebrow and nods. “I’ve their names on a list,” Hermione glances hopelessly down at the parchment strewn over her desk before giving up with a shrug, “somewhere. I’ll find it and see if there’s a way to issue light tracking spells on them. What do you think about putting an alarm on the castle doors? I don’t want to cause a panic, but if anyone tries to go outside…”

“But you still want me. You’d fuck me
It seems so simple, phrased that way. So bloody simple. Because Draco is right, has been the whole time. Harry’s been running too, as far and as fast as he could. He simply hasn’t been ready to trust himself, his own feelings. May never have been, until he saw Draco covered in a blanket of snow. Draco’s lowered his defences so more than once, given Harry chance after chance to close the space between them. It can hardly be all his fault that Harry’s skittishness only disappeared after Draco’s wards would go back up.
They devoted the rest of each day to research, and Harry woke up in the morning excited, and confused about his excitement. Wandmaking demanded an intricate knowledge of histories and basic principles, of component interactions and star charts, things he’d never taxed himself to learn beyond what was useful in a fight. But he sat half-curled in Draco’s leaf-patterned chair and studied theory until his eyes hurt, reading about accessories and woods and cores and astronomy, absently asking himself questions about things he didn’t understand, and looking up in surprise because Draco would always posit an answer. He sat in Draco’s leaf-patterned chair and felt indulged, as though the extra days Draco had requested were really a gift meant for him.
“Not far.”
“I won’t,” Harry said without hesitation, as honest as he’d ever been. Twice, Draco had opened himself up; unstinting reassurance felt like the least Harry could give him, and Harry couldn’t think of a single Auror he worked with who wouldn’t personally volunteer to make sure he held to such a promise, if he ever had trouble holding it on his own. “I won’t do that to you. I give you my word I’ll do everything in my power not to. If you think— If you can have a little faith in me.”
“That was—” Draco’s breath caught. “—truly disturbing. Awful. The most vulgar sort of—” his eyelashes fluttered, hips starting to move in time with Harry’s hand, voice turning faint, “—joke.”
Draco snorts and gets comfortable on his side, draping one elbow over a pile of pillows. “Well, you can’t be expected to know everything about me,” he says, sounding irritated.
She made a little sound of protest. “I didn’t—”
“We haven’t,” Granger tells him, following it with a loaded, pointed silence that does the work for her.
Harry cleared his throat. “Why Andromeda and Teddy, though? You didn’t even know them, really.”
“Well,” Malfoy said, “she did have a virgin Hippogriff with her.”
. He slings it over his shoulders and heads for the door. A low growl freezes him in place.
“You’ll be the Sporty one,” Draco snarled. “You won’t have to wear a dress.
Really, it was all Christmas’s fault.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Okay. Fine.” He hadn’t thought of that. Didn’t want to think on it now — how Draco had essentially been moved from one prison to another. How he’d been handed over, as much a sacrificial lamb as Harry felt, having to make the choice between a life sentence and the death of...
“Our studio is currently closed. We will re-open—”
, could I?” Frustration — or relief — made Harry yell.
, like when he asked Teddy what he wanted during his meltdown.
“Move away, move on,” Draco said, lifting the cloche from his tray and setting it aside. “Without enmity, so it doesn’t have to be unpleasant when we meet however many times a year the contract dictates, preferably once. I’m pragmatic.” His lashes fluttered, face partially obscured by the rise of steam from Kreacher’s quiche until it dissipated. “And famished. God, this is marvelous.” He sighed and glanced at Harry. “What?”
Silence fell and I took a few minutes to gather my thoughts. First, I didn’t think I had a leg to stand on questioning Harry’s sexuality anymore. Second, Harry was refusing to leave my bed, as though we were some sort of… Third, I couldn’t seem to stop thinking of him as
"Went by Mungo's and apologised to Matthews," he says gruffly. "He's no longer listed as critical."
“You need some things,” Potter says, pulling out one hanger after another and holding up the jackets in Draco’s direction while squinting behind his glasses. He discards several of them, but keeps one in brown leather and shoves it into Draco’s arms, then turns to pick through stacks of shirts and jeans on a nearby table. He shakes a few of them out, glances narrowly at Draco again, then pushes two sets of jeans and a few shirts into his arms as well. Draco clutches everything close, dumbfounded.
sex life has been,” Draco said with a sharp inhale, letting his head drop to the side when Potter’s lips came down on his neck, “but I’m fairly sure people can do it anywhere.”

It sucked the air from Harry’s lungs. He shook his head. “You don’t mean that.”
* * *
you must, do you understand? Harry—” There’s a momentary break in the line, static, and then, calm but urgent, Narcissa says, “
, lashes lowered, so Harry did: their mouths barely touching, kissing with an exchange of breaths, the smoulder of Draco’s gaze thrilling through him.
The tension leached from Draco’s spine, almost as quickly as Harry had interrupted him. He arched a rub of his arse against Harry’s cock and resumed rocking into Harry's hand. He let Harry wank him, slow and steady, for a few measures, then said, “Roll onto your stomach,” in a voice seductive as an apple presented by the brightest-eyed of snakes. “I’m going to finger my spunk back into you until you come again, and then you can suck me until I’m ready to come on your face.”
It wasn’t the best, as inventories went. Too many of the items were unspecified, because Harry couldn’t be sure what they were, or what significance they had. Sixty-four trunks, each with a different casing — various leathers soft as sealskin, exotic woods, polished to a reflective shine — and about half decorated with a king’s ransom in jewels. Emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and so many others; Harry had only recognised the lapis because it looked so much like a set of earrings Petunia had once blamed him for losing. On his second visit, Harry had noticed two cupboards set against one of the walls, their doors so seamless as to be invisible, except at a certain angle, in a certain light. Inside the first was a row of heavy aprons made of dragon-hide, matching gloves in their front pouches. Inside the second was a lone shelf, years of dust clearly delineating where books had once rested.
Draco does a double-take, his eyebrows climbing. “How injured
No one wanted to talk about the fact that Harry’s magic was unaffected. Malfoy’s, too, as far as Harry could tell, always wielding the wand Harry had stupidly returned to him as though it was an extension of his hand. Using it to warm Narcissa’s tea, to Summon tissues for her when she covered a cough with her hand — floating them over to Molly with a sigh when she couldn’t stop crying. Always out, as though it was
The buildings turn out to be a tiny, devastated village. Harry doesn’t want to use a place they can’t fortify if he doesn’t have to — most of the houses are decorated with shattered windows and broken doors — but they happen upon luck in the form of a little, abandoned stable, old but well-maintained. A lot of luck: no lingering scent of livestock indicates that it’s not been used to house animals recently; the glassless windows are shuttered from the inside; there’s a locked door at the back giving them more than one potential exit, and the wooden doors at the front are on sliders, handles bound together from the outside with a loosely-knotted length of rope.
Hermione paused, a disposable fork in one hand and paper napkins in the other. “You haven’t come by in a while, Harry.”
Harry slid off the table, gripping the sheet around his waist, and followed. Ducking between the drift of fabric, he came to a halt as his mind warped to adjust expectation to reality. The room, so possessively, privately guarded, didn’t expand out with wizarding space like Harry’d more than half-presumed, but was a tiny studio flat that was mostly filled by a large if otherwise unimpressive bed. Two long, narrow windows stretched across the far wall, each cracked open to allow for— air flow, perhaps, and each covered by herb boxes sprouting green things. Off to the left was a kitchenette; next to the bed, a shelf filled with books and a modest wardrobe, a years' worth of newspapers stacked to its side. Draco waited by a closed door through the kitchen, a sardonic quirk to his mouth. Harry padded over.
“Harry,” Draco says when he pulls away, “I’ve been telling you for years.”
My eyes flew open, and I caught a glimpse of wild black hair in my periphery. It was—
there could be a pair of eyes on him. Let alone a perverted pair.
A shiver zipped up Draco’s spine. He hadn’t counted on this at all.
“No, the reception is fine. I just—” Hermione clears her throat. “Ron’s busy, he’s— he’s in another part of the castle, and we have some things to cover before we hang up.”
Once begun, it was halted almost immediately, Harry unable to resist pausing with Draco against the wide-open door of the parlour. Kissing him became a new destination, Draco’s hot breath in Harry’s mouth, against his skin — almost falling when they forgot themselves, their weight swinging the door back to hit the wall, Draco’s breathless laugh like a Tahaitian night. And then, minutes later, after a stumble of a dozen or so steps, Draco finding his own holiday port, near the stairs to the kitchens. Bowing Harry back against the railing dangerously, a hand slid under his jumper to his stomach, fingers splayed and kneading as he devoured Harry’s mouth.
“I’m not looking to mend them, I want to
His cheeks warmed. “Hermione,” he said, smiling, “when have you ever been able to—?”
” and, as he feels Harry come immediately awake beside him, tries to give out a warning, only to find that he’s too terrified to speak.
” Molly huffed, goggling at him. Harry gulped, unable to believe he’d just done that — resisting the urge to take it back .
Potter shuddered and said, “I heard an —
“For fuck’s sake,
“A year and three days, actually,” Harry says. He releases Draco’s hand and tugs at the waist of his towel, pulling it open. “But reading that…” He swallows, and makes himself remember Draco new in his arms, confessing to being afraid for Harry; he makes himself remember Draco’s declaration of faith, and how that had felt. “It was… bad, Draco. I can’t— I can’t feel like that, when I’m on an assignment, and you wouldn’t want me to.”
Draco pulls one tail of the sash, unknotting the bow but leaving the two sides still looped together. “I do,” he says. There’s a new light in his eyes, a flutter of anticipation. Harry can feel it all around him, that look, like a tongue on his skin. Draco smirks. “You want to fuck my mouth— Or, wait,” he murmurs.
you know, it was spell-based. I knew right away somehow that I wasn’t supposed to let you know whatever he was going to ask. But he was being decent about the list,” she said plaintively, “getting you such nice things, and then he mentioned the hair potions, and…” She swallowed. “I thought it would be something we’d laugh about later, you shampooing Potter’s hair.”
He took a little comfort from the fact that he knew which utensil to stab Malfoy with when he inevitably drove Harry to violence, although Malfoy didn’t seem to appreciate it when Harry said as much. Shoving his chair away from the table as soon as the bill was delivered, Malfoy forced a smile and somehow managed to look sophisticated and unperturbed even as he stormed outside to wait. Blood thundering in his brain, Harry took his sweet time paying, not remotely eager to join him.
“—rry?”
“Careful, Potter,” he murmurs, nudging his hips forward. “If you fuck me now, you’ll have a much harder time convincing yourself later that you’ve done it for my benefit.”
“No, I’m just thinking,” Harry said. He took off his glasses and pulled his t-shirt free from his jeans to clean them. His wand worked better, of course, but cleaning them manually tended to buy him a minute when he needed one, and he did — Malfoy’s questions were more involved than he realised. Or maybe he realised it, and just thought Harry wouldn’t understand the depth of his curiosity. Either way, it was one of those moments that made Harry grateful for the convenience of having glasses to clean. Finished, he put them back on and said, “I am one of her favourites.” Harry smiled and shrugged at Malfoy’s snort. “But she meant it, at the beginning of the year — that thing she said about zero tolerance for fighting. Only I made it clear that you’d been defending yourself against that sixth year, before we…”
“You could try showing enough common sense to know I care about

“I’ll get us as far as I can,” Harry says over the screams of Inferi below them. Dozens of them are even climbing atop others in a maddened, growing tangle up the side of the ground floor, a horrific wall akin to creeping ivy. The glass door on their balcony finally shatters and Harry raises his voice. “Be ready to run.”
“So. You mentioned having ideas to get around the Wizengamot’s objections,” he started.

“I was
“I can,” Luna said softly. She’d sat down at some point, had pulled a pillow into her lap. Her fingers were folded together atop it.
“Maybe,” Harry said. “Maybe it is.” Merlin knew he wanted it to be. He wanted them to be nothing, the way they were when Malfoy had been safely under house arrest, and Harry could spend his afternoons tramping through the woods and resting on his balcony. He couldn’t mistake Malfoy as a friend, despite how well they got on during certain activities — but they’d never be nothing again.
“Yeah,” Ron said, sounding glum about it. “I don’t envy you there. Well, anywhere really, I doubt Malfoy’d be my type even if I swung that way. That new Beater for PuddU, maybe,” he added with a thoughtful air. “Blaise isn’t a bad sort of bloke. I’d probably like a guy with lots of muscles.”
Potter took a step forward and kissed me again, an obvious ploy to shut me up. But he gripped my hair with one hand and fisted the other tight into my robes, tilting his chin into the kiss.
no problem, Potter. You be as circumspect as you like, about
“You did,” Harry points out. Draco swivels on his stool to face him, his narrowed gaze lifting to Harry. After a moment, the scowl perched on his brow fades, and Harry clears his throat. “They set up anti-Apparition wards around your house. After you went down, I managed to get you into the parlour and I couldn’t think what else to do. I’m sorry, I know this is your private space.”
. Not even when Draco stared at him before walking away, lips swollen, fingers still tight in Harry’s hair, for a measure far longer than Harry would have needed to explain — the span of twenty kisses or more, depending on how Harry counted, and all of them gone unkissed.
“All right.” Draco paused, processing that revelation with an appearance of equanimity that he felt deserved prizes, as well as a moderate amount of gold. “I would appreciate that.”
, and should be
“You are,” Harry said. A conflicted look passed over Draco’s features, and Harry cupped the back of his head, disturbing the fine strands of Draco’s hair with his fingers. “You
rather than making assumptions — Malfoy cleared his throat and stood up a bit taller. “Alright. Does Astoria have a plan of action for managing the fallout over this?” he asked brusquely.
Draco held himself taller for Harry’s inspection for a moment, a kindle of light growing in his silvery eyes. He stepped forward and deftly unknotted the sheet from around Harry’s waist, his hand reaching down familiarly to circle Harry’s cock and give it a slow pull. Another. Firming already, Harry’s erection grew fat and hard in Draco’s grasp; Harry dropped his wand and paused Draco’s strokes with a trembling hand.
The last member of his team disappears. Harry times his own departure, controlling the flood of anger through his extremities. He’s been gone for days, and he’ll need to use the full capacity of both — anger and control — if he wants to get home in the next twenty minutes.
Surprising himself with a snort, Harry heaves himself up from the bed and looks down at Malfoy. He doesn’t smell too bad, probably due to the freshening charms he seems to have been using on the room. But his hair is lanky and unwashed, and the blood on his robes has long since dried, leaving it with unsettling puce stains over the chest and cuffs. There’s more blood on the back of his wrist, some under his chin, little streaks half-flaked off. He’s an absolute mess, but the Ron in Harry’s head is right — he can’t concern himself with that, yet. He turns to better investigate the room.
Pansy subsided with a small grimace. Draco stared at her hair until one of her hands fluttered up to pat it nervously.
Harry stopped. Blinked. “Yes. And you’re okay with him?”
“Enough that I knew where to look to figure it out,” Harry said and Draco stilled. Harry could see the fast flutter of his heartbeat, just over his collarbone.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Potter,” Draco says. “Stop.” He runs a hand over his face and shakes his head, before abruptly skirting around the sofa to drop onto it, close to Harry’s side. They sit, pressed tight from shoulder to thigh, for several moments, and then Draco leans his head on Harry’s shoulder and takes his hand. He smells like the shampoo that costs half his monthly pay, and three different men Harry would happily kill given the opportunity, and Harry would breathe in the scent forever if it meant Draco would always be this close.
The air seemed to still for the duration of a heartbeat — neither of them breathing. And then Malfoy's palm slid against Harry's, those long fingers tightening around the back of his hand for two brisk, efficient pumps. Malfoy let go, and Harry looked back to his tea.
“Mere repayment, as discussed,” Narcissa says. “For letting me speak with Draco, for however short a time.”
“I’m not—” he says, smiling. “I won’t, right now, be able to get— We'll have to use—”
“I—” Harry laughed, helpless with it. He was going to look like the most besotted fool in history in tomorrow’s papers, assuming they didn’t run a special midnight edition. He lifted his shoulders. “Yeah. Sorry.”
“Seems we’ve got plenty of that,” Harry says. Draco snorts and sets his bowl aside, drawing his legs up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. He rests his chin on one knee, examining the fire as though it might give him the answer to something. His face takes on the same abandoned sort of concentration as it had when Harry saw him dance.
There, he’d said it. Harry felt a moment of intense satisfaction with himself — and then like he was going to pass out.
"He do it too." It grinned, flashing dirty, jagged teeth, then bounced its hips from side to side.
Potter’s gaze slid to Draco’s face and stayed there, so intent it began an unpleasant riot of Bothersome Things in Draco’s stomach. He let go of the curtain and Draco let his hand fall away too, as Potter said, “Then the Cannons shirt, then the Quidditch tickets.”
Tilting his head, Harry listens. “Yeah, a little.” It doesn’t sound like there are any more of them, though, and they’ve lost the interest they seemed to gain in the building during Harry’s outburst. “It’s going to be ugly tomorrow morning,” he says, not moving yet. “Dangerous.”
“It’s only as easy or hard as you make it,” Malfoy said and jerked a nod to the top tube of the bike’s frame. “Get on, I can show you.”
Harry swallowed. Wondered if that had been true.
“I’m at work,” he said. But he sounded unsure, and bit his lip. Harry took another step. Draco inhaled sharply and shook his head; his whole face had turned pink in a matter of seconds. Harry liked how it looked, and continued closer, pausing only when Draco’s palm settled on his chest. Draco curled his fingers slightly, digging into the cotton of Harry’s t-shirt. “I-I’d get fired,” he said.
“Yeah,” Harry says tersely. He stares at his watch until the disturbing memory of Williams’ smiling face sinking in on itself fades.
,” he said, showing off all his teeth in a grin.
"I am, a little." Surely it's not a weakness to admit
“Fine.” Harry huffed, irritated with himself for even wanting to pursue that line of questioning. He lifted the cover from his own tray to find Kreacher had personalised their meals; his plate was loaded with runny eggs, sausages, toast, a cuppa off to the side — next to post. Lifting it, he said, “You can win at being the tartiest tart to ever walk the halls of Hogwarts, if it means so much to you.”
“I hate you,” she said.
“You have a few things to learn, too,” Harry said.
you’d be the last person I’d come to for that sort of aid.”
, you think, tasting yourself in his kiss, gasping out of it only to breathe.
?” Harry asked. God, Draco was going to kill him for doing this to her. “A member of the Wizengamot? The parole coordinator? A—”
“It’s a frivolous one — empty, when someone has nothing to offer.” Malfoy tossed the blankets off himself and swung his legs over the side of the bed, gripping the edge of the mattress — pausing there for a few breaths. He’d taken off his shirt in the night, and the stretch of his back was exposed, the top of his arse. The shadow at the top of his crease. The length of him was spindly, the dips of his ribcage visible, the sharp jut of his shoulder blades flexed inward. But two dimples lived at the base of his spine, shallow and perfect, the size of the pad of Harry’s pinky, and slender muscle shifted under his skin as he straightened, setting his shoulders. The nape of his neck was pink; it had a tiny, dark mole and a small scar. He stood up, and Harry looked away. Malfoy said, “Nine o’clock.”
“Harry,” Weasley said, sounding rather pathetic. “Any chance he’s dosed you with a love potion?”
Malfoy growls and bites down on the tendon of Harry’s shoulder too hard — and that’s believable too. But Malfoy soothes the bite with a lick when he pulls away, and he murmurs, “Better give you a good story to tell, then,” hand working fast and rough over Harry’s cock, his arm dropping from Harry’s midsection. He snaps his hips harder, jangling Harry’s belt buckle, loose around his knees, and jerks Harry back, bouncing Harry’s arse against his pelvis so hard Harry groans. The friction is
“But—”
turn out to be fine, even though Pansy refused to join him — claiming the need to attend a fourth engagement party for her sister (which is an even bigger insult than Draco’d originally thought, he realises in retrospect, blast her; he’d been Pansy’s fucking plus-one at Violet’s wedding
The dog's growls intensify.
on his body.
Harry crouches down, wiping off his weapon on the soft grasses underfoot. “Go ahead, say it.”
Malfoy sighed. “What do you want?”
“Draco,” Harry says, exasperated. Draco raises his eyebrows.
He hears Morris process the offer with a sharp inhale, and then a crack of Apparition as he sweeps a hard-eyed look over the rest of his team. Only the best of the very best can get certified in field work for the DMLE since he took over; they undergo rigorous hand-to-hand and magical combat training, hundreds of hours of psychological testing, and two years of Pensieve Simulative practices. They’re a good team to have, and he’s proud to have them — even if, in this case, he plans on doing most of the work.
“What joy; I’ve long thought the act of taking a shit could be improved by doing it centre stage.”
Harry twisted and discovered that Draco had backed up; he stood under the vaulted arch of the study’s entrance, eyes on the floor between them. He moved away from Bill, took a step closer to Draco. “We should sit. Draco?”
At dinner, Draco sat next to him before anyone else could get there. His casual touch to Harry’s wrist deepened Harry’s shameless lean towards him to the point where it probably looked absurd — like he was trying to fold into Draco’s lap, when really it was the opposite. Even the thought sent skitters up Harry's spine, and he had to swallow a moan when Draco subtly insinuated a finger under the woolen cuff of his Weasley jumper.
“A book of recipes with magical notes in the margins, a potion’s kit—” Draco left out how the kit included silver-tipped knives, feeling a bit bad for Potter’s socks, “—and a new subscription to Quidditch monthly,” he said. Which led to a discussion about the current season, which led to an
“Did you not understand what—?” Malfoy breaks off. His Adam’s apple bobs and he shakes his head, a lock of his hair coming loose from its clip to rest against his jaw. There’s a ghost of fear on his face that Harry recognises from when they were younger, but Malfoy’s eyes are settled unflinchingly on him, molten as volcanic ash, and a new planet carves itself inside Harry’s heart.
“No.” Draco takes in the conflict etched over Harry’s brow, the unhappy shape of Harry’s mouth. He drawls, “From what I’ve read, you’ve usually got good intentions, too.”
“Pobble,” she says, “Bean.” The elves pop into the room. She surveys them dispassionately; their heads are bowed, their ears drooping. To the Unspeakable, Hermione says, “They have plenty of power, and Hogwarts has little use for them. Ask them to volunteer.”
“I don’t have to,” Harry said. Finding his pyjamas, he took his towel off and sent it flying back to the loo. “I know you did.”
Draco let out a breath, gave Harry a definitive nod. “Okay.” He sat down again, seemed to collect his thoughts for a moment. “Yes. So. I’m. Well. You know how I feel. And I’m smart enough to take the opportunities that come my way; I wasn’t going to turn you down after saving your life made you catch feelings for me,” he said, directing his sneer at Harry’s hand. “But as disagreeable as it might be to admit, Weasley isn’t wrong. Not everyone can just— accept the good fortune they’re handed. Especially those of us that don’t deserve— that haven’t earned it yet. I fucking
“Hate what you see, Malfoy?”
those rumours about you?”
“I came through the DMLE Floos to avoid the mayhem,” Harry said. He grimaced at the perplexed silence that followed. “Draco… isn’t here yet. But he will be.”
Harry, somehow completely unsurprised that she was behind him, was torn between the desire to turn a glare in her direction or watch in fascination as Draco jumped in place like a scalded cat. Watching Draco won out, and Harry waited until Draco regained his footing, snorted as Draco muttered something about being right back, and finally swivelled to meet Parkinson’s unimpressed gaze when Draco stalked into the back room.
“Fuck,” he muttered with feeling. He fisted Draco’s cock, up, down, tightening his grip around its flushed, leaking head, his own cock throbbing damply against the inside of his pants. “Look at you.” He twisted his hand around the length on a downstroke. Thumbed over the silky precome gathering at his slit, hissing when Draco’s fingers flexed in his hair. “Look at that.”
It’s a map of France, intricately detailed and obviously charmed. Each province sharpens when Hermione looks at them individually, streets and houses clearly visible to the naked eye, Paris in the middle. She can practically see the flow of the Seine. She nibbles on her lower lip. “All right. What is it?”
Speechless, flooded with thirty different types of adrenaline, Harry wanted to leave, and couldn’t — but couldn’t accompany Draco inside, either. From the doorway, he saw Sirius, in his patented indolent lounge, cock a grin at him from the armchair near the fireplace. And standing next to the fireplace, elbow resting on the mantelpiece, having a smiling argument with Remus. He was leaned against the crook of the sofa, an arm scooped around Harry’s waist as Harry’s head lolled onto his shoulder, and whispering affectionately in Harry’s ear:
?” Harry asked, breathing with short, sharp pants. Draco gave him a shark-like smile and rolled against him again, smearing slick precome over Harry’s cock — though Harry’d be hard-pressed to figure out whose.
“Yeah.” It’s not very bright, and battery-operated, besides; they won’t be able to keep it on every night if they want to conserve any power, but Harry doesn’t really fancy the idea of sleeping in pitch darkness again either.
“Where I just blunder in with a wand and brute magical strength,” Harry says. But his sarcasm is underweighted by a vague sort of hurt, and Draco swivels in his chair to face him.
Dear God.
The messenger bag is more interesting. Mostly, it contains folders of papers written in a code specific to the security clearance on level nine — nothing important; bureaucratic nonsense memos, most likely, based on their format. But there are also some scrolls that are still covered in secrecy charms, though they fizzle as soon as he picks them up. Unrolled, they reveal complicated geometric diagrams accompanied by shorthand notes in the margins about Apparition vs Floo travel, and magical restraints vs
Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, and Muggle Studies, although who would have guessed, I'm such an arse.
Potter turned then and walked out the door, as abruptly as he’d come in. Draco stared after him, feeling rather blank, until the timer for the oven dinged.
“But you would have, anyway,” Draco continued. “Because you hate being forced to do anything just as much as I do, and possibly more. Tell me I’m wrong.”
” Harry accused, into his hands. “There’s going to be pictures of us in tomorrow’s paper going into a fucking
“Since I opened the door so he could see you, when he came to my room,” Pansy said. She twisted her hands together. “It wasn’t— That wasn’t
“Will you come join me?” she inquires gently. She pats her bedside. The girl blinks, clearly having expected admonishment rather than invitation. “My name is Narcissa,” she says, giving her a conspiratorial smile, “but my friends call me Cissy.”
Each word was chipped off like ice, Draco’s smile colder still. He sneered it — an expression cruel enough to topple a weaker man. But Harry kept his gaze on the tiny creases etched around the corners of Draco’s silvery eyes, the only hint of anything on his aristocratic face that hadn’t been formed or learned in the bitter, malignant tundra of his youth. They were laugh lines, recent. Evidence of a warmer heart.
“Potter—”
A plaster slapped over his nose and mouth, shaped out of his own fear. Harry makes himself breathe through it. He looks around the room and counts: five little things. And again. Eventually his dizziness abates.
“It’s fine.” Harry waved it off, trying to smile. “It’s good that she does; I don’t begrudge you a mother’s gifts,” he said, laughing a little. He felt a little bad — fully grown, he knew it shouldn’t be a tender subject for him, and there was no point in being sad that other people got to have things that had been lost to him before he could remember. And he couldn’t deny wanting good things for Draco, not anymore. He touched the globe again. “It’s really lovely.”
. If you have any care for how inappropriate this is, Mr Potter, you’ll—”
everything had been so
Harry managed a whimper, a nod, stifled by a mouthful of cotton-wrapped feathers and a scramble of desire in his brain trying to work out how he could fuck himself on Draco’s fingers or fuck harder against the mattress with Draco’s weight pinning him in place. He didn’t think it would take very long even if he couldn’t. His bollocks were already throbbing with the need to come.
, Harry thinks he’s going to say, but Draco just shakes his head, a wryly genuine smile replacing the blasé one on his face. It ticks up after a moment, a little sharper. “You date men who look like me.”
“Semantics,” Draco scoffed. He slipped his ring off. It made a soft
“But he had a hand in it,” Granger says after a pause, and Narcissa opens her eyes.

And just like that, Draco had one.
Draco wants to say
Still relaxed from his orgasms a few hours later,
Draco shifts, unsure what his qualifications have to do with anything, but as he opens his mouth to respond, it occurs to him that Harry is still considering the blank expanse of the wall. “Yes?”
They get ready for the day in silence, not touching.
it reads.
And, well, Harry's been trying
“We have a little time.” Malfoy dipped his head a touch to bring his mouth within kissing distance, but didn’t kiss him. He inhaled again — a big, nervous swig of air — and said, “We have a little time, Harry. If you don’t want to go yet.”
— Harry can hear the squealing
me, rather than stalking away. Merlin fuck, he’d taken off the rest of his clothing. I’d not a clue when he’d done it but he had, and he was completely, mouthwateringly bare, every rangy muscle bunching and on display as he sat over my thighs. The weight of his impressively thick cock, flushed and drooling, thumped against my belly. It rose with a jerk, and settled again, and I reached for it, for him, without thinking. Potter grabbed my wrist and pressed it to the mattress. “No.”
“Aren’t I going to
going home?”
“But Kreacher’s been living here for generations,” Hermione said. Her eyes had gone bright with interest, her lips pulling into an inquisitive frown. “To hear him tell it, his sole purpose is to take care of Grimmauld Place and its inhabitants.”
“Then we’ll each have got to have that first with each other, yeah?” Potter said huskily.
My heartbeat is very loud in my ears. My face is scorching.
I’m— I’m just—”
part’s true,” Harry says, snickering. Draco gives him an offended glare and Harry’s control breaks; he laughs in Draco’s face and shakes his head. “I’m willing to admit to being a little oblivious but I’m not stupid. I know you can get us out of here whenever you like.”
They were falling asleep by the time Harry remembered that desire of forever he’d felt in the bath. Sleepy, he lingered over the memory simply because it made him feel good, kissed Draco’s jaw, and closed his eyes.
“Yeah.” Harry settles more fully in his straddle over Draco’s thighs and presses his face to Draco’s neck as Draco’s body erupts in another round of violent tremors. Harry drops his arms into the water and lets himself relax, tired down to his bones. “How are you feeling?”
Harry reared back. "I didn't mean that you couldn't…" He licked his lips, heart roaring in his ears, and made himself look.
, and drifted off imagining them on the same holiday.
“You’re going to fuck up our divorce,” Draco said, low. But his eyes gleamed, good as any invitation, and Harry couldn’t help his grin. He could feel the heat of his own breath gusting over Draco’s mouth.
"I'm fine," she says, then promptly amends, "As well as— as any of us can expect, I suppose."
Draco threw him a wary, sidelong glance as he drew the milk from the cooler, then poured some into the pot on the hob. “Me too,” he said, adding cinnamon. He found a whisk, stirred it in with brisk, efficient movements. He blew out a breath, voice going distant. “Me too.”
“Oh.” Harry huffed a glad breath and held him closer. “And?”
“I want to know… I want to know what happened to him, to make him change.”
Harry draws back, staring at the paper. He's not mistaken, he knows he's not, but he reworks the code in pen, regardless, before the glowing symbols on the coin fade. They were Hermione's answer to “constant vigilance”; her own brand of cryptography. He remembers teasing her when she came up with it.
didn’t beg, and he certainly didn’t want—
When you wake up, he's got his lips sealed around your arsehole. His tongue is inside you. The fever is still there, but— no longer as urgent. The stubble on his cheeks rasps against your buttocks, and you groan, finding his messybeautiful hair with one hand. You arch into his tongue, hear his appreciative sigh, and then a sloppy-embarrassing slurp as he lifts his head. He kisses the inside of your thigh, nuzzles the crease of it. "'m going to make you feel so fucking good," he promises, low, "you'll never want to leave my bed."
“Well then it’s a very strange Slytherin campaign to smear you by making you look incredibly selfless,” Harry snapped, irritated. “Come on, Hermione!”
Someone else spoke. “Fuck. Is that Harry Potter?”
“We’ll go in soon,” Harry says. They’ll have to; Draco is trying to hide it, but his teeth have already begun chattering a little because it’s November, and freezing even without the wind, and Draco isn’t wearing his fucking jacket. But Harry thinks they can spare a few more minutes. He points. “Look.”
Potter looked down at the swath of green and silver stripes on the material resting over his chest and stomach. He let out a breath and gently pried Draco’s wand from his grip, flicking it at his own wardrobe. A scrap of maroon and gold flew into his hand and he held it out.
Kreacher was… smiling.
“I wouldn’t have to ask Theo so much as crook my finger for him to come running,” Draco said. “But I don’t—” He blinked, a small groove appearing between his eyes. In a slightly strained voice, he continued, “I wouldn’t. Not until I’m in my own life. If that’s something that needs to be said.”
“Why am I not surprised you’re defending her?”
“Sleep well,” Draco said.
“But you talk about everything else,” Harry says belatedly. He doesn’t see any reason not to let Draco know how much it gets under his skin now, either, so he adds, “Sometimes I fantasise about spanking you for it.”
“Harry.” Granger’s voice wobbles dangerously over his name. Her breath comes raggedly across the line. “He— He’s busy, like I said, and,” she forces a laugh, “I’m sure you can’t possibly remember everything
“Harry…” Hermione makes an impatient, worried sound. “
“You’re not spending Christmas at the Manor, idiot. Stay here if you’ve got to, you know you always can,” she said, scrunching her upturned nose at him in a scowl he didn’t believe for one second, “but you’re not going back
bombshell like it was nothing, yet sounding strangely disgruntled when he added, “but by the time people stop calling me over, you’ve always gone home.”
Potter moaned into his mouth, kissing Draco back just as fervently. He released Draco’s hand and cupped his jaw between two warm palms. Draco pushed his fingers deeper into Potter, two at once, with the same careful pace Potter had set, until they were seated to the knuckles. Potter kept kissing him, little whines breaking free from his throat when Draco started fingering him open. Potter was so hot inside, so fucking tight, Draco was a little afraid he’d spend as soon as he got in.
“Yours to lose?”
"I’ve always known what a little hypocrite you were, but this is really extraordinary, even by your standards,” Malfoy murmured. He let go of himself and clung to the formica counter at his back, its drab olive-green drawing focus to his whitened knuckles, in blatant opposition to the appeal of his pose, the lazy drawl of his voice. “You couldn’t possibly still think you’re the only victim in all of this.”
Harry shivered and gathered him tighter, fucking himself against Malfoy’s still-firm cock. “Do I— Do I—?” Words gone, Harry slid his fingers between Malfoy’s buttocks, brushed them impatiently over his hole. Malfoy’s trousers were too tight for him to spread his legs, but Harry could turn him over, could have him that way. Could use the slick of Malfoy’s come to push inside.
“I’ve never liked you, not once in my life,” Parkinson murmured, pasting on a sweet smile. “And I don’t trust you, and Draco’s been stupid about you since he was little, and if you hurt him again I don’t care who you are, I’ll kill you myself.”
Harry cracks a surprised laugh. Draco twitches a guarded smile at him, then pulls from Harry’s grip and turns his back in a way Harry supposes means he's not quite forgiven yet. He wonders if he should make more of an apology before expecting such a thing. Wonders how much there is, really, that he should be apologising for.
Regardless," Draco said, clearing his throat. "This wasn't about you. I didn't ask for your help, and you had no reason to give it.” Bitterness underscored the flat affectation of his tone. “You
the thing?”
“I can feel you,” Harry slurred. He heard a hum, a buzzing in his chest, and the twist of whatever was buried there being pulled free. With it came a gush of memories: successes that soon felt like mistakes based on the heavy pauses after he explained, the weighty frowns that were deliberately hidden — but not soon enough. But then there was that shimmer again, wrapping around the hole next to his heart, and Harry was able to breathe, to think, his mind in a freefall and Draco’s hands working magic over the tendons of his wrist. He drifted off, Draco’s huff of aroused laughter floating through his head, and Draco’s voice, annoyed and resigned and soft: “I knew I’d never make it another week, anyway.”
He made it fast.
“Narcissa,” Minerva says, an edge to her voice.
.” It’s so maddening, he grips Draco’s shoulder to keep from living out the picture Draco suggested of simply manhandling his mouth over his prick. Draco’s eyes slide up, glinting, like he knows exactly what Harry’s thinking, then opens his mouth and lowers his head in a long, wet slide, tongue dragging over the sensitive underside of Harry’s cock. Harry’s vision goes white around the edges, his cock jumping and pulsing out a burst of precome as it’s encased in heat. Draco pauses again then, exhaling warm through his nose against Harry’s pubic hair, and makes an inquisitive sound that vibrates around Harry’s cockhead.
“I saw Hugo…” Hermione mentally tallies for a moment. “Yesterday morning.”
"We should have left him at Grimmauld Place."
Potter wound a firm hand around my erection and gave it a light squeeze.
“Hi,” he said, when Malfoy didn’t.
“With new volunteers, it shouldn’t, but there will be no way to re-extend the wards after it’s done. We should have anticipated it," he adds, accepting culpability, which Hermione appreciates, "but the majority of us have been focused on constructing the spell complex enough to both clear a path for Potter and Malfoy in Coquelles and rebound in time for their exit in Britain. I would suggest directing —
“Four times.” Harry grimaced. “More, really. Apart from little things like spilling wine all over Ireland’s Minister for Magic or insulting that envoy from Brazil by having to leave early when I got sick off the Firerolls they served at their event, apparently my dress robes are all wrong, I’ve not once used the correct fork, I may as well eat my feet for how often they’re in my mouth, and I refuse to dance, no matter who’s asking.”
“I could have told you that already, after having seen your reaction on the street a few nights ago,” Draco said. “I should have realised how much of your magic is connected to your pleasure centre. But I’m not finding any problems; if it’s been muffled, it’s only been marginally so.” His hands lifted off Harry, and there was a rustling sound, the small pop of something being uncorked. Citrus this time. Draco put his palms flat on each of Harry’s shoulder blades, slippery with oil. “You haven’t been sleeping well since you got that Owl from your boss.”
They're already coming.
“Fine.”
Barnaby had Flooed home even as they were being ushered from the office; he’d postponed his family holiday to sign and file the paperwork, and was excited to activate his Portkey for Japan. There was no way they could summon him back, so they had to stay married a bit longer.
Draco ran that through his head. He pasted on a smile. “I suppose you could always just Obliviate them.”
“Yes.”
“Ron, yes.” Hermione bit her lip. “Except that you don’t let a lot of people in, Harry. For good reason, sure. But it does limit the people in your life. Anyway,” she said, “when you only open yourself up to the same people because you’re holding grudges against those who’ve done wrong but want to change, history repeats itself. Do you know how long the witch trials were used as part of the pureblood rhetoric? So many of them grew up hearing that they had to protect themselves from people whose only power was strength in numbers and manufactured weapons. So many of them grew up learning things wrong, and I— I didn’t want to contribute to that world. I
“I—” Malfoy paused, throat bobbing, and shifted from foot to foot. His gaze flicked over Harry’s face. “Yeah.”
What the…?
~ ~ ~
Granger looks at her like one might examine a specimen under glass: interested, but sceptical. Removed. “You’re saying Lucius is the one who did all this. That he was driven so insane by Voldemort, he tried to… What? End the world to prove himself better? That’s what all of this has been about?”
“I’m… Rose,” the girl says. She takes a few, halting steps closer before stopping, a worried frown caught on her face. “I just wanted to—”
Harry disagreed, chest tight with tenderness. “I can be less reckless,” he said. “And I’ll keep you informed. I’m sorry for that, it was crap of me—”
“You never do,” Harry says.
he wants, if he’s being honest.
Remus had told him, an oblique promise, before departing.
Always in the eye of a different storm, perhaps not such a horrible fate as he'd imagined.
“A conversation about what?”
“You’re—” Harry shuddered as Draco slithered one long finger between his legs, under his testicles, and curled it up; a steady, rubbing increase of pressure to Harry’s perineum. “—still a fucking Slytherin. But yes,” he said, answering both questions at once, “I do.”
“Your magic, though,” Malfoy said.
“Harry!” Robards recovered from his surprise quickly. He rose from behind his desk, an ugly, ostentatious thing that probably weighed a metric tonne, but that he seemed to think made him look powerful. He gestured to a chair. “I’m glad you were able to make it in today,” he said, with a weird blend of censure and approval that grated on Harry’s nerves.
selfless, not completely. Not even a little. He’d known what he was doing was a big thing; he’d known it would be even when the idea first came to him, not quite unlike searching for the Resurrection Stone would have been. It felt entirely selfish, because he wouldn’t have done it for just anyone — and because he was filled with the same happiness he saw mirrored on Draco’s face.
is made second by second, because out there, “ Harry jerks his chin to the window, slid partially open to let in the breeze, “that’s the way you have to live. Understand?”
They only got to the stairs.
“What did Granger say?” Draco asks, pulling back slightly to look at him when his shivers have abated. Harry’s forehead is creased; it reshapes the bolt of his scar.
But beyond a few smiles, Potter was treating him the same whenever they were in front of other people: polite and a little distant, not quite meeting his eye. Draco preferred it that way.
“A thread,” Draco says thoughtfully.
He was less worried about anything Andromeda would do than he was about Ron and Hermione; their response to Harry’s invitation included such a surplus of underlined words and exclamation points it bordered on threatening, but Harry hoped for the best until the night before. Draco came upon him in the kitchens at half-two in the morning and tripped on the bottom stair when he glimpsed Harry at the kitchen table, then turned to glower at it for a beat before looking at Harry.
“He really was,” Ron put in. He sighed, scratched the back of his neck. Gave a hapless, one-shouldered shrug. “Hermione was just—”
They’d never have to. Harry rubbed his damp palms against his thighs, the denim covering them, soft and worn. Comforting, somehow, when so little else was. He lifted his drink again, drained it. Watching the gulls by the shoreline toss sand into the air as they fought over something to eat, he exhaled his question as a statement — as a question, it was humiliating. "No one's asked me about the— stipulations. Not really."
“No, I— I know,” Harry says, an eager note to his voice. He beams a smile at the mobile, then directs it towards Draco for long enough that Draco's mouth runs dry. “I know. Don’t worry, I’d already decided— I was going to tell you— Yeah. I’ve got it.”
things together. He couldn’t even protest, because they were, and he knew he must have said the same thing at some point, and Draco obviously didn’t mean anything by it. But he couldn’t find his voice until Draco was already rummaging through the cabinets for a small pot.
