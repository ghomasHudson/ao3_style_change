Malfoy blinked at the stars thanking them that he even had a chance to look at them, silently thanking the boy sat beside him for speaking on his behalf at Wizengamot and coming out scot-free. He could have been living a very, very different life right now, one that did not include the freedom to watch the stars, one that was eerily identical to his father's.
Harry jolted and sprung to his feet. A shiny orange marble rolled on the ground and stopped before his black shoes. He whipped out his wand and pointed it between Malfoy's eyes, 12 curses on the tip of his tongue all varying degrees of bone-crushing capabilities.
As he waited for his dish to be ready, he found his mind wandering to the conversation he had with Malfoy up on the Astronomy Tower a week ago. It was odd, the whole experience, almost surreal. They had not hexed each other, they had not insulted each other Malfoy had been, dare he say, civil. Calm.
"The Wiggenweld Potion was curated immediately after the invention of the Draught of Living Death," Madam Pomfrey expounded. "It was the sole antidote to this particular Draught but it's generally used for
Harry frowned at her in confusion then turned back to Blaise. "I'm pretty sure Trelawney is happy to have a break from someone who can't read tarot cards."
See, he was meant to have died when he willingly walked himself to Voldemort. He was not meant to have survived, hell, even Dumbledore himself predicted that he was going to die. Yet he did not. He was alive, first thanks to his mom, Lily Potter, and second thanks to Malfoy's mother, Narcissa Malfoy.
"I quite like Ancient Runes," he said conversationally. He thanked Merlin that Potter was in the state he was in so as not to comment on his weird conversation skills or lack thereof, but Malfoy was desperate as he did not want Potter to finish writing his lengthy letter that was upsettingly getting closer to what seemed like a conclusion.
Harry's heart ached for a moment. Some part of him wished that what he had with Ginny was strong enough to sustain the damages of the War but alas, it never was. Perhaps it was a testament to how fragile they were as a couple.
"Ah, you might know him as Grindelwald," Madam Pomfrey amended but Harry's face remained blank. "Sometimes I forget you did not grow up in this world."
"Before we begin, I want to say…" Malfoy chewed on his bottom lip, seemingly having an internal battle with what he wanted to say. "I want to express my deepest gratitude for choosing me to perform The Veil ritual this afternoon."
"No. Not once did it even cross their minds to think what they had was wrong. In their minds everything was right, despite where they stood, everything was right and alright. They did prove to be something though."
“Of course, he did. An Animagus in the form of a lion is quite difficult to achieve but alas, as it is Gryffindor himself, it is not so hard to imagine. He was the best of the best, son.”
"There is always a disconnect between being acquitted in one's crimes and society acquitting one from the same."
, he had the feeling that Godric had been ignoring everyone for hundreds of years. He knew for sure that Dumbledore must have tried his luck in getting the lion to speak, let alone
"Like Nearly Headless Nick," said Harry, patting himself on the back though another part of him should have known the other House ghosts not simply that of his own House.
"The Mirror was often regarded as showing, not one's appearance, but their heart's deepest desire. Cartomancy has the same effect as you allow your future to be read and secretly open up yourself and your magic to be infused with what the cards have predicted as your future."
Harry involuntarily shivered. He could not imagine never having to feel the sun on his own skin. Despite the horrible English weather, he did occasionally like the rain, the smell of it, especially. But to have lived so long as a ghost that one forgot the feel of such small, yet big, things, he could not imagine it and his heart sunk at the prospect of Fat Friar’s ancient ghost.
Harry nodded at his suggestion and as soon as Ron walked off, he walked in the opposite direction, towards Malfoy's table. His hands felt clammy and his knees slightly weak but he reminded himself that he,
She considerably calmed down. "I see. Come in, come in. Sit there," she gestured to a purple couch by the fire, "and I'll make us both a hot cuppa, how does that sound?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "Is it true about that guy who slept for nearly 500 years? Like, is it a fact?"
Malfoy pursed his lips, looking as if he were about to say something but decided against it. "I don't even want to know. Anyway, the first was Illyius."
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii this is my first drarry fic and i kind wanted to play with the history of the OG characters & ran with this idea lol.
Harry nodded and reached out to grab a Pomfret cake. He took a bite, having never tasted it before, and the taste of licorice flooded his mouth.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously. "What are you not telling me? How did you go from fighting against Death Eaters to being on the same side as them?"
He would find himself in the common area chatting with Ron, Neville Longbottom, and Dean Thomas about next year's Quidditch World Cup, blink, and he would be in the Great Hall with everyone, enjoying their meals. He would blink one more time and find Professor Flitwick jotting something up on the board in his Charms class, blink and he would be up on the Astronomy Tower contemplating a world where Harry Potter ceased to exist.
Fat Friar nodded eagerly, his joyful demeanor something that Harry was increasingly aware was his default.
"Malfoy!" he said under his breath, his eyes gazing at his new visitor walk down the aisle of the Wing, heading straight for his bed. He felt as if his heart was a snowflake falling to the ground but before the snowflake touched the cold ground, he landed on a warm hand that was awaiting his arrival. He felt warm and a feeling of being wanted.
"Raczidian," Malfoy absent-mindedly corrected him. "Nobody knows if he lived or not. Part of me thinks it's a cautionary tale told to ward off the dark side from casting Patronus charms."
"Purebloods have the power to chant an incantation for the dead to pass successfully beyond The Veil without being stuck in the middle. However, even with an incantation done he has to be willing to leave which he has not done since 1966." He narrowed his eyes at Harry. "You might have disrupted that."
Panic struck Harry. Did he know about his goodbye letter? Had Malfoy read his letter? No, Madam Pomfrey assured him that a few people knew the contents of that letter yet why did Malfoy sound as if he simply
Hermione smiled. "You're welcome, Harry. You know I haven't been able to do any light reading because I am worrying a lot about my NEWTS and my future and my parents and, well." She paused. "So this is a good distraction."
Ginny snapped her head to her, momentarily forgetting that Luna was also on their table. “Why’s that Luna?”
Professor Binns stared at him for long moments of silence before, and Harry had never witnessed this, laughing out loud. "Oh! I can assure you, Mr Potter, that I am truly alive and kicking."
Fat Friar laughed joyfully. “Not at all, Harry. It’s the same feeling as walking through a fog. You don’t really feel it. I don’t feel things anymore.”
And Malfoy did the most unexpected thing that he ever thought possible: he smiled. A genuine smile, without its accompanying snark nor sarcasm, and it was so pure Harry looked back down at the flower in his hand.
Hermione was all too happy to divulge on the readings and essays and lessons and experiments Harry had to catch up on and he was not feeling weighed down by the sheer amount of work he had. Instead, he was happy to just lay back and listen to Hermione relentlessly and passionately talk and he supposed that was what he missed, reminiscing on the good ol' days when it was the Golden Trio.
"There's only so much that a potion can do. Only so much rest and restoring of bones can do but love is the ultimate."
Harry briefly wondered how Luna would know it's a tough one but he supposed he would blame the Wrackspurts.
Harry Potter, defeated Lord Voldemort, he was pretty sure he could complete a simple task such as asking Malfoy to be his partner.
Malfoy ignored him completely. “Why was his portrait moved in 1368? Did anything happen during that time?”
Harry remembered eagerly choosing to be an Auror, he simply wanted nothing else. He had it all envisioned and planned down to the last T, with the help of his mentor Albus Dumbledore, the then-Head of Gryffindor. He was going to be an Auror and needed to have passed at least five NEWTS to be qualified. He was going to go into training with Ron Weasley by his side, thereafter graduate from Auror training after three years, and rise the ladder to be Head Auror. Additionally, he was going to marry Ginny once he became Junior Auror (while she played professional Quidditch), have three children, and live the rest of his life happily ever after.
“Of course! You and I had something special and we’d be fools to let it go just because of a War. Voldemort can’t destroy they fire we had.”
Professor Binns stopped his packing and looked up at his Eighth Year student. "Relationships have no business in history books, Mr Potter. Their impact and work towards the building of our school has bigger importance, wouldn't you agree?"
"That… that can't be. I am alive! I am alive!" he screamed facing the heavens. "I am not dead. I will never die. I was promised to teach for the rest of my life."
for truly they were one and the same thing. This year, Hermione had a 10-month plan on how to achieve perfect NEWTS through a methodological and organized study plan that she generously included Ron and himself into. In all honesty, with Harry's weird insomnia mystery and general lack of will to live, his grades were gradually slipping but not so much that Professors would notice. Though he figured it was a matter of time, especially in Transfiguration and Charms.
"He's worried about you. The last thing you two argued about was Ginny and that morning he wanted to apologize during breakfast but you wouldn't wake up. It's been eating him alive."
Ron groaned loudly and was immediately hushed by his girlfriend. "How am I supposed to write all that and do the Potions essay, go to Hogsmeade to buy ingredients for next lesson, and fill in three blank star charts and write a five-inch essay on the witch-hunts in the 10th Century and—"
"Apparently there is a big DADA exam today and everyone was studying for it so my other visitors were not available."
Malfoy was struck by the sincerity in Harry's eyes, the voice laced with desperation and despair but whatever was on the surface he knew there was a monster of
Malfoy began separating the ingredients in the order that they would be put into the cauldron for the brewing. "What do you mean?"
Professor Slughorn immediately brightened up and clapped his hands four times. He spun around and as he heads to the front of the class, he announced, "Harry, my boy, has reminded me that I have an announcement to make." He stood tall and strong and proud at the front of the classroom. "To bring about the theme of inter-house unity, with full backing from Headmistress McGonagall, I have revived my prestigious Slug Club from the ashes and we shall have our meeting next Friday evening – in exactly nine days."
Malfoy nodded and the silence stretched between them. As usual, Harry's anxiety rose, from the pits of his stomach up to his vocal cords. The silence was making him uneasy and queasy, he wanted to fill the silence with words, anything, really. In hindsight, he wondered if Malfoy's silence, or simply the silence itself, bothered him.
Harry choked on his cake. He rapidly beat against his chest, still in a coughing fit. He drank the remainder of his tea quickly and his airway was cleared. "Lover? Dumbledore had a
“Excellent work, Ms Granger,” Professor McGonagall praised her. “It’s perfect! The rest of you, please follow her lead.”
Fat Friar seemed confused at first, his eyes questioning before he floated down below the ground and only half his body was visible. "I don't think it had anything to do with the Chamber. We all knew, mind, but I am almost positive that Salazar did not outright purge Muggleborns."
), he knew the effects of it after casually asking Malfoy more about it on the pretense of taking more notes for his upcoming essay, and he set an alarm to wake him up for breakfast.
Professor Slughorn burst through the room, clapping his hands happily as he looked to his left and right, surveying his Eighth Years. He reached to the front of the classroom, sunlight gleaming through large glass-stained windows, twirled twice, and smiled openly.
"Perhaps one day the Battle of Hogwarts will also be forgotten in, like, thousands of years to come. We will only be a sentence in the history books and, like, that's it. Maybe that's all we live for."
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - will be HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think of it (:
, Mr Potter," Professor Binns said, his voice not a drone anymore but rather quite sharp and impatient and, momentarily, Harry wondered what his real voice sounded like. "It indicates the relationship between Godric and Salazar was based on that of professionalism to build something unprecedented that would last for millennials to come, to provide an institution of learning for all those who wished to learn. Whatever ill relationship the two founders, or even four founders, had between themselves did not interfere with the overall big picture."
Professor Slughorn instantaneously noticed Harry, as he always did. Harry wondered if the reason he noticed him was simply because of his mother being the best student in his class or because he was Harry Potter but that was neither here nor there.
“Well when we got together we were so young and fresh and the War happened so we didn’t really connect. But after the War I felt like the spark was there. We had something special, you and I.” Ginny paused. “I think we should not be quick to say goodbye to what we had.”
"You don't know?" Harry smiled, amused. "The great Draco Malfoy does not know? Oh, wonders do cease."
Madam Pomfrey nodded curtly. She set her unfinished tea on the floating tray beside her head and reached beneath her white apron to pick a folded brown paper from underneath. She held out the paper for Harry who gently took it from her hands.
“Mr Potter, a word,” Professor McGonagall’s voice rang through loud and sharp and Harry froze. What was this about? Malfoy spared him a brief glance before joining Parkinson and heading out of the classroom. Hermione and Ron stopped by his table, stating that they would wait for him outside class. He nodded and made his way to the front of the class.
Well, not exactly controlling him, he had 17 years of that happening thank you very much, but controlling in the sense that his body simply took over and he was on autopilot. That type of controlling.
"That's a myth," said Professor Binns and he clicked his bag closed. "Mrs Binns is making a roast for dinner and I do not want to be late." He looked at the time that appeared in thin air. "Almost 6 o'clock. Good evening, Mr Potter. See you next week for class."
"I honestly doubt it. Patronus Charms are not known of their origin or creation and were only discovered way after Hogwarts was founded. I doubt either of the founders of Hogwarts had knowledge about it or could even fathom such a thing."
He was alerted to the time by the sounds of his roommates waking up and he groaned into his pillow. Another night where he barely caught a wink of sleep. He got ready in the blink of an eye something that was eerily starting to lightly scare him at how moments would pass away without his knowledge, as if somebody was controlling his life.
The following day in their Transfiguration double lesson, Harry relayed the same information to Malfoy (after hassling to be his class partner before Parkinson could get a word in).
Harry chuckled to himself. Of course, Malfoy failed in Muggle Studies, duh. Of course, he failed the one subject that involved non-wizarding persons because growing up as a Pureblood seemed to be in one's DNA to despite those who
"History says?" Fat Friar joyfully laughed. "History says a lot of things, son, and usually the victor writes the history, not the loser. Unfortunately, Slytherin house did not get it's redeeming arc, even after all these years, it still has not."
"Did you hear what Slughorn said, about Salazar and Godric being friends?" Harry whispered conspiratorially.
"If you are anything like Hermione, which you are, Malfoy, your version of terrible grades is P which honestly isn't so bad."
Harry nodded, not ready but his blood was making him nervous and excited for what was to come. He watched Malfoy remove his wand from his inner robes, raise it to the ceiling and murmur something in French… or Latin, Harry was not particularly sure, all the while his wand moving in a precise and intricate triskaidecagon shape.
He found himself, once again, stomping off to Madam Pomfrey’s office, explaining that sleep was eluding him. She conjured a dark purple Sleeping Draught for him that was meant to put him into a deep sleep instantaneously. Excitedly, he took a drink out of the bottle, placed the potion on his bedside table, closed his eyes and… did not drift off to sleep. He waited for a couple of minutes, couple of hours, still nothing and cursed Madam Pomfrey the entire night.
Minutes to midnight, Harry had drawn the curtains to his bed and clutched the clear liquid in his hands. He needed to take less than five drops (lest he slept for 500 years)(which sounded like a dream if Harry thought about it because he would be
"Snape, but he never got around to it. He was busy teaching me Legilimency and Dark Spells to prepare me to be a Death Eater."
"Curious, isn't it? Folklore tradition never dictated for anyone to tell spirits they're dead because it was always assumed they knew – which frankly they do. Nobody knew how to go about with rare examples like Professor Binns and it was assumed we would all wait until he found it out himself."
“Terms of my probation,” Malfoy said in a tone that indicated he was tired of using this as an explanation for a lot of aspects of his life. “You need to keep that Hufflepuff ghost aloof.”
Afternoon classes on a Wednesday were superb for it was a double Arithmancy, followed by Ancient Runes and finally, before classes were over for the day, Ghoul Studies which only Dean took which then made Charms the last class Harry had for the day.
Hermione briefly smiled at him, squeezing his arm in affection, Harry imitating the gesture and then breathed out. "What happened, Harry? There're lots of rumors flying around the school but I want to know from you. Did you really overdose?"
"Are you going to explain what this is about?" Malfoy asked, showing no signs of moving whereas Harry was looking increasingly like he was about to yank Malfoy up by his robes and drag him to the Charms classroom.
"I'm alright," he answered, groggily. He looked to his left and then his right then back to his left, there were no other patients in the Hospital Wing. "Why am I here?"
Harry's mouth moved to speak but no words came out. He quickly glanced towards Malfoy then Blaise then to the Professor.
Like always, the professor had given them three unrelated essays to be completed before the next lesson.
"What we allegedly know about Godric and Salazar's friendship is false," Malfoy stated, looking at him. "According to the tale as old as time, Salazar and Godric were indeed friends and while they did have obvious differences – such as recruiting Muggleborns into Hogwarts – their friendship remained. It continues that Rowena and Helga were jealous of this friendship and manipulated Godric into believing that Salazar was an evil wizard who built the Chamber of Secrets to secretly purge any and all Muggleborns in Hogwarts."
All Harry did was increase his tone, anger deep-set in his voice. "That's all I wanted! I didn't want anything else apart from that because I have literally not been sleeping, like, at all. I was desperate and tried everything but none of the other sleeping potions worked. Including the one made for dogs.
She nodded at him, a small smile playing on her lips. "It's archaic magic that most people today do not believe in as it happens to one person every 3, 000 years, something sort of folklore or myth at this point. Yet I am alive to witness it."
Ron sighed. “I know it’s selfish. But I didn’t want to move out because… well, I don’t think Hermione and I are going to be together much longer.”
“Merlin, Malfoy, you look like the most exercise you’ve done in years is going up the lift at work.” Malfoy gave him a death-glare. “Alright, come on then, or we’ll miss the train.”
"So, back in the first uprising of Voldemort-" Draco tried to hide his flinch at the name- "Travis Parkinson and his wife, Leanna, were involved in a whole string of muggle killings. They were sympathisers with Voldemort, but never became Death Eaters. Travis and Leanna were put in Azkaban and died there a few years later, but their son Rexell is still alive and owns the farm. It was suspected that he was involved, too, but he was never prosecuted."
“Will you two just shut up?” Harry snapped, slamming his fist down on the desk. “We hardly ever see each other anymore. And when we do, all you do is fight. I know it’s hard right now, but can’t we just… go back to old times?”
A few hours later, Harry, Hermione, Pansy and Andromeda were standing outside Blaise Zabini’s house, all with a similar look of dread and nervousness on their faces.
“I know it’s holiday season, but we really can’t afford to have anyone take time off. It’s all hands on deck,” Robards sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair, “of course, Christmas Day is a public holiday, but apart from that…”
She looked up, and tears had begun to run down her face. “I just… I just feel so guilty. My transition has been so expensive, and Mum and Dad just insist that everything’s fine.” She wiped some of the tears away and sniffed. “It makes me wish I wasn’t trans. I feel like I can’t put Mum and Dad through this, but I also know that I
“I am Ivan,” he said, holding out a hand. Draco shook it. “I come from Ukraine. I have lived here just over a year.”
“Even Neville’s doing better than me,” Ron huffed, “look.” He pointed at Neville, who performed a perfect Finite Incantatem, exploding the floating beanbag which Kingsley had conjured for them.
Inside the ministry, the morning bustle was already starting. Harry quickly made his way upstairs to the auror office, where Robards was waiting. "Harry. Morning," he said, taking a sip from his mug. "Coffee?"
“They don’t need any,” she said, and pulled out a piece of paper from her pocket. “I found this on Robards’ desk. I saw him leaving the Ministry, and I had no idea why, but I managed to sneak into his room once he’d gone, and…” she handed it to him.
Pansy sighed, and nodded. "I don't want you to be, but I guess you're right." She reached forwards and tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. "It'll be okay, Draco."
Draco thought, looking around. The room was entirely for show - to impress people who visited the house.
, because he broke up with me, but I was going to break up with him, so… I don’t know. It’s complicated.”
They walked down a few flights of stairs and along a corridor before reaching Amyra's ward. Draco stopped outside, and moved his head slightly in the direction of the door. He didn't need to say anything else.
They looked up as Harry, Andromeda and Teddy entered the room, and walked over to them. Draco hugged Andromeda, and Harry watched awkwardly as they stayed embraced for a while before Draco broke away, and knelt down to hug Teddy.
Hermione nodded, unsure as always what to say about Luna. “Well, your N.E.W.Ts are coming up soon, and then you’ll be out of school with us.”
After a few seconds of discomfort, he appeared, outside Amyra's house. Apparating that distance had been risky. But he needed to help Amyra.
"It's alright, Draco." Blaise smiled awkwardly. "I don't really blame you." He put down his cup of tea and ran a hand through his dark, curly hair. "I was a total asshole."
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, moving his gaze upwards to the stars. Here, away from the city, the sky was covered in glowing silver spots. “I can’t seem to feel anything. Except anger. But even that’s mostly gone away, now. I’m just… empty.”
Pansy groaned loudly. “Draaacoooo, just do a spell or something, please? Cooking with magic takes like, zero effort.”
Draco nodded. He had heard of the Parkinsons - they had been talked about amongst Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor.
Draco felt like he was going to throw up. He took a couple of steps forwards. “Potter, don’t, it’s alright-”
“You, me, Draco, and Robards. Although, Robards probably told some of the other Aurors. It has to be one of them.”
Term ended the next day, which meant Mrs Weasley was busy making Ginny’s bed, and she immediately set Harry and Ron on degnomeing the garden.
“Uncle Charlie told me about them,” he said after the fourth dragon, “and this is a Welsh Green. I call her Nimbo.”
“We almost got caught by the landlord when I took him for a walk. I had to duck around a corner and cast disillusionment charms.”
don’t want to be nice to. But essentially, after the war, many of the Slytherins in our year inherited lots of money and power after their parents went to Azkaban. I think we can get them to help us.”
The nurse guided them to the waiting room, where they sat for what felt like hours before the Healer finally came out to talk to them.
Pansy rolled her eyes. "You're so dramatic. A lot of people would kill to be in your position." She sat down next to him, and inspected her nails.
He walked out of the office, along the corridor, until he came to the bathroom, walking inside a stall and checking no one else was there before slumping against the door and pulling out his phone.
His heart was beating erratically against his chest as his legs run down the stairs. Would Professor Binns be alright? Did he make a mistake of telling him he was dead? Nobody had ever told him since his death in the Sixties that he was not alive and yet everyone continued like it was business as usual. And what was happening to him right now? Why did he need to find a Pureblood—
"Before he died, Godric wrote a letter to his best friend that he forgave him for all that he did, for purging Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets and his last request was that when Salazar died, they are buried together wherever he wished as proof of his loyalty."
so she does not count. Then Zabini whose mother is a voodoo doll for all I know and then you, a very odd choice."
He rubbed his face with his hands, internally groaning. He supposed that was enough speculation for one evening and work on his assignments. His second Divination essay, one inch long, was to write on why Italian tarot cards were more powerful magically than the French tarot cards. He was partly happy that Trelawney barely asked a load of thick essays as most of the learning occurred in class rather than outside class. Speaking of outside class…
Harry gulped. He had not thought about what happened to his goodbye letter to Molly. He had not even thought about how he hastily dropped it inside his bedside table and called it a night.
but rather studying his previous books to learn about his take on wizarding history. Currently, all Years are studying
Harry turned to face him and tilted his head. Malfoy did the same and a shiver ran down his spine. Looking at him, properly looking at him with the dark circles under his eyes, his hunched back, his hair falling lifelessly over his forehead, his green eyes not so bright anymore, like dim candlelight about to fade into the darkness… he was the shell of a man that could never be his best anymore.
briefly looking down at the contents of the page. Why he still took Divination was beyond him and blinked once more at the page.
He was under no illusion that his father was the worst kind of human being, do not get him wrong. He deserved everything that ever came to him, including Azkaban. But regardless, Lucius was still his father, always was, always will be, and no matter what his mother deserved a moment to say goodbye for his father. She deserved to bury her husband but Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt refused, letting his body rot and wither away in Azkaban until the end of time.
"Professor Slughorn reminded all of us to write down three different fields we are interested in for our Apprenticeship. I think the same applies to all Houses."
"For the life of me I didn't remember if I was to take one drop, half a drop, or, like, four drops," Harry said, chuckling at himself because it was very much him. "You have to understand, Malfoy I was so, so tired. Of just everything. I wanted the world to stop for a bit, just a tiny bit." He snorted depreciatively. "Look where it got me."
"It'll help to know where to start on the angle of Salazar as I cannot seem to find the first step which was his portrait."
“Ah, that’s where the problem begins.” Fat Friary flew slightly higher and Harry had to turn his head up to view his face. “He has barely changed from his Animagus form since his portrait was moved in 1368. He does not speak, does not respond to those who prompt him to. For hundreds of years, many have tried but the lion remains sleeping.”
Harry whispered back, "Revision is a powerful thing." For once, however, Harry knew the answer. As he had been lacking sleep lately and had tried nearly everything under the sun to enable him to sleep and not entertain the idea that he was secretly a vampire, or worse a Muggle zombie, he was excited for today's particular lesson as, as far as he understood anyway, that this potion was the most powerful and potent of all sleeping potions.
"Voldemort had cursed Grindelwald and Albus rushed him here, at Hogwarts, asking me to heal him. Of course, you know, I can heal just about anything under the sun," she added, giving Harry a cheeky wink. "But his injuries were severe and there was nothing I could do. Albus spent his days and nights by his bedside, never once leaving him alone. He died three days later."
Hermione nodded. "You two had something boundless back in Sixth Year but with us trapezing around looking for Horcruxes and fighting Voldemort and keeping up with just about everything dampened whatever you had with Ginny. Ron and I are lucky to still have each other after."
"There's no shame in feeling like Malfoy is one of your friends," Madam Pomfrey said. "If you truly feel that he is worthy of friendship, nothing else matters. After all, you have more in common than you think."
“I am still curious about Godric and Salazar’s friendship. Maybe if I talk to Godric’s portrait I might get some clues.”
"His entire life he was obsessed with Helena and winning her love I don't think he had a clue about Salazar or Godric's mysterious ending."
He figured that Malfoy did have a point that maybe Godric's lion did not present itself to be alive because he was with Fat Friar and perhaps if he had gone alone it would show himself to him? Simply because he was of the same House? What was more was why Godric was by himself on the floor? Before leaving that night, he had walked up and down the corridor and Godric was the only living person on that floor. Scratch that, he was the only living creature on that floor. The other portraits were simply of naturistic paintings such as mountains, oceans, forests, beaches, whathaveyou.
Malfoy's customized quill froze mid-sentence for a fraction of a second before he finished his sentence, put his quill down, and gave Harry his full attention. "Horcrux is dark magic, very, very dark magic. My father taught me a little about it which was enough to make me suspect that the Dark Lord had gone through the same process."
Harry rubbed his face with his hands. They were currently in the Common Room, the Golden Trio working on their Charms essay together, rather Hermione intensively researching on nonverbal spells while Harry pondered on his upcoming meeting with his Mind Healer and Ron munched happily on chocolate frogs – gifts for all three of them from George Weasley that Ron was quickly munching away.
“You’re not seriously listening to her. Our auras don’t match,” she mocked Luna’s airy voice. “We make our own rules not something you read on a palm or look into a clear ball.”
"You speak Latin, Potter?" Nott asked, surprised, along with the rest of the Eighth Year Slytherins.
Harry's eyes widened on the spot as he watched the professor fade before his eyes and then return to his normal ghost self. In the next minute, before his very green eyes, his body glitched as his head moved sharply to the right while his body shifted to its left then returned as fast as it had happened. And then it happened three more times.
but perhaps he would ask Professor Binns – or Hermione really, his personal walking fountain of knowledge.
His first guests, a rather big surprise to him, were Blaise and Luna. They had come in bearing large flowers of various forms of roses, a bag or two full of candy, several editions of The Quibbler, and a golden goblet so large in between Blaise's hands that Luna swore would get rid of the remaining Wrackspurts floating around Harry's head. He placed the giant goblet by Harry's bedside table.
"In layman's terms, your magic eats itself to sustain you which is incompatible with one's nature. See here, if you drain all your magic you die and we all know that a wizard cannot live without magic."
"Agree to disagree," he said, smiling at Malfoy working himself at correcting Harry's phrase instead of admitting he did not know. Harry would have liked to bet every last galleon in his bank that the one thing anyone could count on Malfoy doing was having answers to nearly everything under the sun and it jolted him a bit when he admitted 'I don't know.' The same went for Hermione who rarely ever uttered the phrase.
"Harry Potter!" The ghost raised his mug in the air. "So glad to have bumped into you. Hope I didn't frighten you."
"Fair point. It'll be interesting to see who shall take the position. Perhaps another ghost?" Malfoy smiled, the same pure and soft smile he had when they were in the 4F classroom earlier today. "Alright, we have all our ingredients ready and we can begin. I want you to take the Sopophorous bean and crash it with a silver –
underneath. In the back of his mind, he recalled the night at the Astronomy Tower and the several times Harry's eyes would wander, not up at the skies, but down to the grass. And the damn letter he had been writing, whatever it was.
"How does nobody know where Godric has been buried? How does a detail like that simply get lost in the history books?"
Malfoy-like gesture. "I suppose so. Actually yes, they're all hung except for Salazar's which remains a mystery. I asked Slughorn and he simply said it was because Salazar himself did not want to which might make a bit of sense."
He stopped at the doors of the Great Hall, stopping to catch his breath and scan the hall. His eyes fell on two sets of ginger hair on the Gryffindor table. The Weasleys were Purebloods, he could ask them. He stopped his feet after several steps. Ginny most likely would not talk to him and he and Ron were icy towards each other because of Ginny.
"Pity," Malfoy said. "But who cares about that fool. Who knows if he will even help with solving the legend? He might as well be useless to our investigations."
Harry briefly smiled at his two best friends, swirling his fork on his copper-colored plate with a modest serving of his breakfast. He took a bite of his crunchy toast, his best friend's bickering about Ron's ever-growing appetite in the back of his mind. Like a magnet, his eyes looked across the Great Hall, passed the Ravenclaw table to the Slytherin table and down towards a certain platinum blond Slytherin. He was looking intensely at whatever Blaise Zabini was saying and a small part of Harry wondered what Zabini was commenting that had caught Malfoy's full attention.
Hermione noticed, he knew that she knew something was off about him, but anytime she looked his way with her pitiful eyes he would look away or engage in conversation to avoid her. When she was about to ask if
He shook his head. Of course not. That was absurd! Malfoy himself would rather curse himself into oblivion than consider him a friend to Harry.
Malfoy sputtered. "You still don't understand the magnitude of what you did? You could've called any Pureblood – hell, even Weasley or Longbottom – but you chose me instead. So—thank you."
This did not make her happy for she glared at him for a long time before she stomped out of the Hall. He turned back and looked on at the head of the duck to his left.
“Did you also not notice that she did not give us the incantation? We have to figure that out ourselves before the lesson is over.”
"I'm sorry, Ron," Harry apologized. "I don't feel that way anymore. I think the War made me realize a lot of things and one of them was that, like, I'm not in love anymore. I think we found comfort in each other because, you know,
He had never heard of a perfect textbook explanation of how to cast a Patronus but was grateful for receiving Remus' instructions as they were, well, less wordy. "She's right. Don't you know anyone who learned the Charm?"
He made a deal with himself that if the potion would not work tonight then he would go see the Mind Healer. He really did not have troubles, he simply wanted to sleep. He just wanted to shut his eyes and rest, and he would even take back the days when he would have nightmares the whole night because, at least then, he had had some shut-eye.
"All Hogwarts portraits are up in the Headmistress' office," she gushed. "Naturally they are there! Why did I think they would be anywhere else? It's Hogwarts tradition."
Lunch was already served when they arrived but Harry found none of his friends were present. He found it odd but quickly remembered that they were all in the library finishing a last minute Arithmancy essay before their class. He looked across the Great Hall and indeed neither was Malfoy.
Harry wanted to ask more but Malfoy was keeping a stiff upper lip about it and he figured he would find out more information from Hermione or Blaise…. Or in two days when he walked out of the Hospital Wing. On to other serious matters….
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - are HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think (:
What intrigued him now about Bloody Baron's story was how he was taught by none other than the founders of Hogwarts. It made perfect sense that he would know more information regarding Salazar because one, he was the founding father of his own House and two, would know whether Salazar was really murdering Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets. That may be more up Malfoy's alley for he was sure the Bloody Baron would not be shared with anyone outside Slytherin House on inside information about Salazar himself.
as amy from brooklyn nine-nine famously said that latin is just taking a long nap and is not a dead language. the title loosely translates to: legends of history
Perhaps it was a trick, Harry entertained himself with the thought amusingly, orchestrated by Slytherin himself, like a simple charm of illusion and he was secretly counting down the days (rather centuries, at this point) to when someone would notice it was an illusionary charm. He had defeated Voldemort with a First Year spell, what was to say this was not the same?
"We both wanted to see you! Madam Pomfrey met us at the door and explained the visitation system," she answered and was very intrigued by the system itself for a full 17 minutes. Harry did not interrupt her, having missed her enthusiasm for knowledge and all things Hermione. "I'm sorry! I've been rambling and haven't asked a thing about you. It's just that—"
"I don't know. That's what he told me. Like, Hermione said there isn't a lot of information regarding Horcruxes around, apparently, you are right, it is very dark magic."
"So, I would've died in the end," Harry said, concluding for himself. It was funny, after everything he had been through, how many times he had come close to death (apart from that time in the forest) and always evaded it. He came so close to death, started wishing for death, and now,
"Some of us didn't spend our childhoods in a large garden under the sun, surrounded by peacocks and swans chattering about nonsense in
"They agreed on everything. Well, apart from the Muggleborns situation, they agreed on everything else. Some were jealous of their friendship, you could say, some wishing them ill intent but nothing Salazar could not fix, you know? Nothing Godric could not forgive."
"It's similar to superstitions like in the Muggle world," Hermione explained and he partly understood where Ron was coming from.
He began the recipe by chopping the broccoli into small, chunky sizes and put them inside a glass bowl. Next, he chopped the green beans into half and added them to the mix. On top of a lemon kick, he also loved zucchini and it was an obvious choice to add to his broccoli pasta salad. He added the other ingredients such as the cherry tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes (can never have too many tomatoes, see) and finally some pine nuts.
Harry bit down on his tongue and looked away from him. Malfoy took his silence as a response and muttered under his breath that it was no surprise he was going to be an Auror.
Harry's mouth dropped. Belatedly he was trying to remember how many times he had done a Tarot reading to either Luna or Blaise as a joke. Far too many for his liking.
Malfoy frowned. Why would getting a P not bother him? Why did he not care as much as he would? Malfoy spotted the letter in his hand, unfinished mid-sentence and he turned his head, looking up at the blinking stars. If he ever did get anything below EE his father would throw him out of the Manor without a second thought. Or better yet he would slam a
He walked before the brick wall three times and a large, brass door slowly appeared replacing the cold, stone walls. He supposed after the Fiendfyre incident that the Room was gone, vanished and vanquished by the roaring blaze but he had wanted a free space, somewhere alone and quiet and he tried walking before the wall, three times like he always did and expecting nothing to appear, a door magically appeared.
Blaise shrugged and leaned forward to the bed. Spread across the center of Harry's bed were all sorts of sweets imaginable.
"Wiggenweld Potion, unfortunately, takes about a week to make and then, when administered, takes approximately two days before the patient wakes up. Yours took longer because your dosage was higher than normal."
"Uhh…" he stuttered having not heard the end of her sentence. "I already have a partner." And unwillingly his finger pointed to a Slytherin who was to his immediate left.
. Also, Slughorn gave everyone a fair shot and chance in his Potions class compared to Snape who tended to favor Slytherins.
"You've been in my care for three weeks now," she said and Harry's jaw fell to his chest. "You accidentally ingested more than the recommended dosage of Draught of Living Death and fell into a deep slumber. I was alerted to the happenings by your roommate Ronald Weasley who had attempted to wake you up for breakfast but to no avail. Only after spotting the Draught by your bedside table did he urgently call for me."
Harry shook his head. "I couldn't sleep at all, Hermione. I used to have nightmares after the War and would only sleep for two, three hours a night. Just before we came back to Hogwarts, I barely slept at all. Like, the entire night I didn't sleep a wink."
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands together thrice and his grin widened. "Today's an electrifying day, my students, for we shall be brewing a wonderful, absolutely wonderful, Potion today. The powerful Draught of the Living Death! As you all know it is a very strong sleeping potion – the most powerful some may argue." He winked at the class. "It can be made…"
"Pureblood tradition folklore dictates that a wizard, or a witch, does not consider death the end of life but the next big adventure. To get to the next adventure, one would conquer death through dying."
He added the fusilli to his boiling water, reduced the fire, and sat back, waiting for it to be ready.
"C'mon Potter, we've got a list to write," Malfoy said, dryly. He picked up his bag and moved to the back of the classroom and Harry followed suit.
"Yeah but that's because the Zabini family are experts on such things," responded Ron, then immediately shrugged. "As far as Pureblood families go, the Zabinis are known for Divination and Astronomy capabilities. They're the best."
"Have you written down your essay on why you want to be an Auror?" Hermione asked, as if not having heard Harry's sentence.
"This is where the legend gets hazy and vague," Malfoy said. "One, there is little to no accounts of where Salazar has been buried – only that he has been buried somewhere in Slytherin dungeons. Two, while everyone does believe that Salazar did purge Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets there are tales that it was not Salazar but someone else who killed Muggleborns." Harry gasped loudly. "Third, according to several accounts, back in the day the Bloody Baron was heard saying that Godric and Salazar were never buried together and that the ghosts of the two founding fathers forever roam the Hogwarts corridors looking for each other."
Fat Friar expression hardened for just a second before turning into that of a joyful demeanor. Harry had heard of Fat Friar before, a wizard born a long time ago in the 980s, sorted into Hufflepuff and was taught by Helga Hufflepuff, one of the founders of the school. He joined the clergy – hence his monastery clothing – where he allegedly could cure the pox and was able to pull rabbits out of a cup. He recalled in his Fifth Year History of Magic class, Professor Binns teaching them that Fat Friar's kindness killed him in the end as he was murdered by his own churchmen.
So were the Astronomy Tower trips and the lengthy goodbye letters he frequently wrote to Molly, his adopted mother. The night Malfoy had met him he had the intention of sending that letter, his last goodbye letter but the slimy git had begun talking to him about the damn legend or whatever and in that he had forgotten about his letter. He had not touched it since but it was safely tucked inside his bedside table.
He uncorked the bottle, carefully to take less than five drops, put back the cork, and set the potion inside his bedside table and before his head hit the pillow, he fell into a deep slumber.
haapy new year potterheads! feels like a century ago since i wrote this but life swept me away and finally landed on my feet once again.
Hermione hummed again, deep in thought. "For hundreds of years since 1368 Godric has not talked, moved, changed into human form, and for what? Why?"
"Yes. She often told me that some wizard or other along her bloodline did not sleep as magic sustained him. He was working on a Potion for sleep paralysis but he never got to finding the antidote because he died. Nobody knew why but now I guess it's because his magic killed him." Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "You're slowly becoming a case for unusual magic happenings that one only hears or reads about."
"Uhh…" he stuttered eloquently then breathed in and out. "I need to do more research on the history of the founding fathers, finding more about the friendship between Godric and Salazar, whathaveyou."
Malfoy leveled him with a look. "Potter, we studied this in Second Year in History of Magic. Were you not paying attention?"
It was on the tip of Malfoy's tongue to agree with Harry but he did not. Instead, he said, "Then we keep on going with it until we find what happened to the two founding fathers." He stretched out his hand towards him. "Deal?"
"I thought we were writing an essay on how to properly brew the Strengthening Solution?" asked Dean Thomas sat beside his best friend Seamus Finnigan.
Malfoy stared at him, unsure if he had heard correctly or if his ears were tricking him. He wordlessly cast a wandless
Malfoy's eyes bowed, shame flooding his body at Madam Pomfrey remembering this tidbit of his life. "If we were friends, he had no reason to. He'd miss classes--"
"How do you, like, keep on moving forward? After everything? I would assume you're worse off than me considering the position you were in during the War and yet you're here,
"I focus on one thing, any one thing, a bit like finding a purpose. It does not matter if it is small or big, whether it is passing your NEWTS or going to Hogsmeade every weekend or starting a collection of different feathers of a bird; focus on something, anything to keep you going."
"I did some analysis on your body, after two private conversations from Ms Granger and Mr Malfoy, and your body has been deprived of sleep. It is quite something phenomenal."
Malfoy spun on the spot and walked back to him. He gingerly reached the space between them and took Harry's hand in his. He opened his hand, palm facing towards the ceiling. He then put a single pink carnation flower on his palm and then stepped back slightly.
He had a free period after lunch and that was when he was having his first meeting with Professor McGonagall, his Head of House, and the Professor assigned to talk to Gryffindor Eighth Years about their Apprenticeship. Instead of heading up to the ninth floor to her office, he stopped on the seventh floor of the castle and headed for the Room of Requirement.
Malfoy opened his mouth to answer but then closed it. He had reached a dead-end. There was no answer to his question without further research.
Harry put his book down when a small chime rang through the Hospital Wing, notifying him that there was a visitor. Since his stay at the hospital, there had been two new occupants but seeing as one had yet to wake up and the other was a First Year who was unable to talk because of a curse, he might as well have been the only one in the Wing.
"He was one of the four founding fathers of Hogwarts?" he answered him, phrasing it as a question. Malfoy made no comment about it.
In a moment of surprise and shock, Malfoy saw Harry fold up his paper and pocket it, along with his pen. He turned to Malfoy and cocked his head, waiting for his answer.
A collective groan was echoed in the class save from Hermione writing everything down on her parchment that Professor Slughorn was instructing.
Malfoy had found him writing a letter – a goodbye letter – to his adopted mom, Molly Weasley. He was thanking her deeply for including him in her family, for welcoming him with open arms and treating him like one of her children, like he was part of the family. He thanked her for a lot of other things but lately he had not been feeling well. He was
"But their falling out did play a great significance, did it not? That's why there are, like, House prejudices between Gryffindor and Slytherin
He never found the cure to his insomnia and Harry was increasingly worried about his lack of sleep, even entertaining the idea that he had transformed into a Muggle zombie and nobody knew. How was he able to remain awake for nearly 24 hours and his body not need sleep? It was basic knowledge that a body needed rest to rejuvenate yet Harry's body was able to sustain him.
"Blaise takes Muggle Studies. He quite likes the playwright and often ends up quoting him. Anyway, I can't remember but Shakespeare said something about humans and their small swift life before they are extinguished like a candle flame."
… until a ghost burst through the floor and he came to a staggering halt. His heart was beating rapidly against his chest as he came to a standstill before a man that was short, stout, dressed in grey monastery clothing, and holding a rather large mug floated before him. His appearance looked familiar and his name was on the tip of his tongue.
Malfoy shook his head. "While it was a fascinating experience and a once-in-a-lifetime one at that, it's also ironically not a big deal. It was bound to happen so there is not much tattle around it. Do you still have the pink carnation?"
"Yeah, something of the sort." Harry had heard of it and made a note to ask Hermione about the quote later on. "Can—Do you need help?"
“Sure,” he readily agreed, visiting Hagrid put off for another day. They made small talk, Harry inquiring about Charlie’s adventures with dragons in Lithuania, of Molly’s new cooking spells, what new Muggle objects Arthur acquired and if Bill figured out a name for his new baby girl.
knew that. If he told Ron or Dean, or even Ernie, they would not know. "I'll do my research and find out what happened in Hogwarts during that year."
---where? Where was he to find a Pureblood? Where would one find a room full of Purebloods? Why, the Great Hall! No matter what time of day it was, there were always students and teachers around in there.
Draco got an inkling that he was not meant to have found Harry Potter on the edge of the Astronomy Tower looking sightlessly before him. It was Malfoy's space, the one place he found peace of mind and was now rather occupied by The Boy Who Lived… Twice. Taking a closer look, he found Harry's head bowed and his hands lightly trembling on his lap. He briefly wondered if he was crying. He murmured the spell
"I couldn't get a word in. He was marching up and down the corridors without stopping, muttering something about needing to find Helena's diadem to give back to her as an apology."
"I assume you have heard of Mr Potter's hospitalization?" she began and Malfoy nodded his face carefully blank. He sort of reminded him of Grindelwald. "May I be so bold as to ask why you have not visited him?"
Harry stared down at the folded letter in his hand. His grip tightened around the letter, the words flooding his mind without needing to read what he had written that night in the Astronomy Tower.
“Morning.” She yawned again, stretching her arms above her head. “How do you look less tired than me when I went to bed earlier?”
But for some reason, something inside Draco was telling him that he didn’t want someone else going and getting the records.
“They can’t do this.” Harry clenched his fist, his fingernails digging into the palms of his hands. “They don’t even have any evidence.”
He couldn't even ask Hermione for help understanding them - they were under strict instructions not to share any of their work with other aurors.
They paused for a moment, both surprised by the mutual understanding they had reached. Then Harry caught himself, and continued to attach his bag to his broomstick.
"No, it's okay. I mean… yeah." Harry shrugged. "I know about how much of an asshole he and Sirius were to Snape."
He left the room, feeling sick, and had to remind himself that Lucius and Narcissa deserved Azkaban. They were evil. They had been Death Eaters.
Without thinking, he quietly pulled on a robe and shoes, careful not to wake Ginny, and crept out the door.
“Good effort! Those of you who failed, make sure your pronunciation is correct. Finnigan, your wand movement is slightly off…” as Shacklebolt moved between the students, correcting them, Draco waved his wand and the charm dissipated. He felt the reverse of the original spell - a warmth flooding him from head to toe.
Potter nodded. “Robards wanted me to, uh, check when you’re coming back to work. I told him it’d be a while probably, and we should just let you be, but I think he wants all hands on deck at work.”
Pansy looked at Hermione, who nervously handed the letter she had found in Robards’ office to her. Pansy handed it to Blaise.
“Well, most of it’s just left to me or other family members, most of whom are dead anyway, so it’ll only be one painful evening of meeting relatives I haven’t seen in years, and then it’s over. Although, there’s the funeral too.”
“Potter, you have to understand - it’s not that I don’t trust your judgement, it’s that I have to be careful. For example, if there’s nothing suspicious going on, would you care to explain why the caretaker of Azkaban informed me that there were spells cast in Lucius Malfoy’s cell?”
But what had changed since school, it seemed, was that Potter didn’t retort back or recklessly pull his wand on Draco. He just shrugged, and got off the elevator at the next stop.
Hermione walked into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes groggily. Her hair was untamed and her shirt was buttoned wrong.
“Ivan?” He said, and put down the safe. Potter and Robards hardly noticed, so deep in their conversation, as he walked, and then ran over to where Ivan was standing, looking at him.
“Ah, Draco,” he said, “I didn’t want to interrupt your work, so I was waiting for you to finish talking.”
It wasn’t the shaky, unsteady scrawl of his mother, like he’d been expecting, but instead an official print. Somehow, that made Draco more uneasy.
Robards nodded. "Alright. We're travelling by broom, because apparition at this distance and without properly knowing the destination is risky. Charm up your belongings and get on your brooms."
“I can’t believe how difficult it is to convince you that you aren’t an evil asshole who’s incapable of redemption.”
“Sir, excuse me, you aren’t allowed in here-” One of the nurses said, but Harry pushed past him, having spotted Amyra’s bed.
“I overheard them talking about it last night. They didn’t explicitly say it, but I’m pretty sure it’s for my surgery. They were saying… well, I’m the only kid still at school, so once you guys move out, they don’t need such a big house anymore. They’ll get a small cottage somewhere in this area instead, and…” Ginny sat down on the bed, and put her head in her hands. Harry sat next to her.
“I suppose.” Draco pushed his hair out of his face, sighing. “I don’t know. I don’t really want to see any other people right now.”
“Potter, I understand that it’s not ideal, but we are under immense pressure to find out everything we can- we have to be sure-” Robards ran a hand through his hair, and then mumbled, “if I’d known you were going to be here…”
Before Harry could process any of the previous interaction, Draco had stepped forwards and hugged him.
"Harry, hi!" Mrs Weasley said, bustling in, "I know you said not to bring anything, but we got some crackers and dips just in case."
“I apologise that I have to keep separating you from the rest of your colleagues. However, it is imperative that the information you three discover - and have discovered so far - does not reach the ears of anyone except the people in this room. I believe that there is someone in here leaking information to outsiders.”
Harry walked around the kitchen counter, and pulled Hermione into a hug. She sniffed a bit, and held him tightly.
They walked outside, followed by Potter, Andromeda, and Teddy. It was sunny, but there was a distinct chill in the air.
Her hair was still long and silky, her face speckled with freckles. She was wearing a simple cropped shirt and ripped jeans. She was still beautiful.
Robards stood up. “Potter, you are crossing a line. I have known the other Aurors for years, and I trust each and every one of them with my life. There could be a million reasons why the Purists only decided to retrieve the safe then - it’s impossible to make an assumption based on that alone. Granger, surely you agree with me?”
“Go and talk to Lucius Malfoy, obviously! We’ll have to get special permission to enter Azkaban, of course, but it shouldn’t be a problem - this investigation is the Ministry’s highest priority after all. I want you two to go - you should leave as soon as possible. I’ll send a message asking permission right now. Start getting everything ready!”
The apartment was almost exactly how Harry remembered it - small, a bit run-down, but homely. A few moments after he knocked, the door opened, and Seamus stood there.
“Some things never change, do they?” Ron sighed. His hair was getting longer, falling in his face constantly. His robes were tattered and worn, shoes scuffed, lounging on his desk chair.
Ivan shrugged. “That was many years ago, now. I have travelled around, first to America, then France, Belgium, Russia, and finally here. I like it here the most. I have started learning about magical plants. I would like to open a shop, I think.”
"I know. But when Voldemort was at large…" Amyra flinched slightly at his name, "I used to get these… visions… in my dreams. They were real, at first, until Voldemort started using them to manipulate me." Harry frowned, and took the cup of tea Amyra handed him. "There was one…"
“What other choice do we have?” He said, perhaps a little too loudly, “They’ve got Malfoy! They’ll lie, or force him into some kind of false confession, or-”
Harry nodded slowly. He was about to respond, but there was a sudden bang as the door to the room flew open behind them.
it's been so long since i last updated wow... school started again so i have been really busy, but here!
Ron looked at Harry. “I’ve got one question, mate,” he said, “earlier, you were so sure he was up to something. What makes you so sure he’s innocent?”
“They say not to speak ill of the dead, but to say my mother was perfect would be outright lying. I know she did some awful things, and even if that was a result of her circumstances and not something she set out to do, it doesn’t change the fact that she hurt a lot of people.
That night, after supper, Ginny jerked her head in the direction of the garden. Harry followed her out.
"Well, when I said you could pop around anytime for a cup of tea, I didn't exactly mean in the middle of the night, kiddo," she said.
"Yeah. I taught them. Professor Lupin taught me in third year, when all the Dementors were at Hogwarts and I kept being affected by them."
They walked out of the office. Harry grinned. “This is great! We’ve got a lead, and you’ll be able to check that your parents are alright.”
“Hm?” She mumbled, her eyes opening wearily. Then she snapped upright, looking panicked. “Wh- what time is it?”
“Nothing,” Harry said, unconvincingly. Hermione gave him a look, and he sighed. “It’s just, Malfoy hasn’t confirmed that he’ll meet us here. I’m worried he didn’t get it, and Robards is going to use it as another excuse to gaslight him.”
Draco paused, his eyes wandering over the room. He was trying to ignore the dead bodies of Rex and Max, which proved to be quite difficult when their blood was strewn all over the room.
“I think he said Dean and Seamus had a room open at their place. There’s a whole group of them. Neville’s there too, and some other guys he doesn’t know.”
us.” He suddenly scowled, his face turning cold and angry. “She wouldn’t listen. I did what had to be done.” Then it was over, and he started laughing again.
Draco’s voice was shrill, panicked. Harry immediately yelled, “Protego!” And Draco’s bolt of red light bounced off Harry’s shield, hitting the wall and leaving a small crater.”
But the thoughts that occupied his brain the most - which also happened to be the ones that frustrated him the most - were primarily about Draco.
Potter stood awkwardly in the doorway, wearing a black button up shirt with the top button undone, and a dark coat. He smiled awkwardly as Draco walked towards him, and Draco felt his heart jump.
Harry zoned them out. Their bickering was almost constant in the workplace, as it had been in school. There had been the brief grace period just after they had got together, when it seemed their fighting had only been because neither wanted to admit their feelings for the other, but now it was back to the usual.
“This is a very serious problem,” Robards began, “and as the Minister said, you must not tell anyone about this. You two are the most skilled out of all the trainees, so we will be doing a lot of the difficult field work. Our first job is to investigate past offenders who may have had something to do with this, or who may know something about this.” Robards paused, and then spoke in a quieter tone. “There is no evidence to suggest that this is… you know. Death Eaters. It’s most likely a couple of messed up people following his ideology. We’ll catch them soon enough.”
The elevator door dinged, and Harry stepped out. He needed to get some files from his desk before heading home.
“Today we’re going to be practising disillusionment spells. They’re pretty basic, but a lot of people who train to be aurors fail the exam because they can’t do the basics.”
He wasn’t sure if he was telling that to himself or Hermione. In reality, it felt more like everything was falling apart.
Harry sighed, looking up at the ceiling. “Yeah, I guess.” He watched Malfoy slowly put his bag down, and sit down on the other bed with a soft
She looked up at the night sky. “Ron and I have been… well, it’s like before we started dating, again. Every little thing I say, he takes as a personal attack, and gets defensive. I don’t know how to get through to him. If I try and talk to him about it, he gets angry.”
“Anyway, I’ve gotta go. Robards actually, uh, specifically told me not to come and see you. I kind of ignored that part of his owl.”
Draco stood, the letter grasped firmly in his hands. He had to read over the words three more times before it finally sunk into his head what it meant, and a feeling of numbness began to spread all over his body.
"I know I just said I wanted to spend a lot of time with you, but this is going to get in the way of that," Harry said, sighing. "I wish I could change it or explain why, but this job is really important."
“Alright, I think everyone’s here,” Kinglsey said, as Dean Thomas joined them, “as you heard in my message, there is an emergency. I had hoped we would have completed more of your training before sending you out into the field, but we don’t have a choice.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Ten muggles were murdered by one of our kind.”
Well, Harry had tried every method of relaxation possible - reading, watching TV, cooking, taking a bath - and he still felt restless.
“Back in the high security cell, with even more Dementors and enchantments on him than before,” Robards said, sighing. “We aren’t on very good terms with… anyway. As I said, the situation has been resolved. Lucius Malfoy has been restrained.” Robards sighed again. “Anyway, I need you two back at the Ministry, now. Granger and Weasley are already there, along with a few others. More Muggles have been killed, too.”
Nonetheless, he looked through pile after pile of papers, skimming them for any piece of information that might be useful.
Harry looked around the room, and sure enough, Ron was nowhere to be found. “Robards hasn’t noticed,” he muttered back.
"I guess I thought… Well, I didn't really think. I woke up, and I figured that if I got here soon enough, I could save you. Even though I know that my dreams are just… just dreams."
Draco was led into a small room with a chair in the middle, and rows of seating surrounding him, with a large desk in front. As soon as he sat in the chair, large chains wrapped around his arms and legs.
“Not for a Death Eater, though. I’m pretty sure that every other Death Eater has killed before. And besides, it’s not like you really chose to be a Death Eater, right?”
TRIGGER WARNING: This chapter contains descriptions of child abuse that may be troubling to some readers.
Pansy nodded. “If we could get the public skeptical of the Ministry, I’m sure it’ll be harder for them to cover up the whole thing.”
“Now, to business. When we were looking through those journals, there  was a lot of mention of Lucius Malfoy. Now, I know Draco has been cleared and everything, by your endorsement - and this isn’t to say I don’t trust you, not at all! I’m just a bit, erm, skeptical.”
“It’s a huge help, Pansy,” Hermione said, “really. This means that when we do get him out, we’ll have a much easier time dealing with the Ministry.”
He paused, staring at Draco. “The Dark Lord gave ordered me to meet with someone called Collins, and his wife, at every solstice and equinox. I was told to record their findings, doings, plans, everything, and then report back to the Dark Lord, as well as give them instructions from him. They listened to what the Dark Lord wanted less and less, and started lying to me. I was ordered to intimidate them, and I attempted to do so, but unfortunately there was one of me, and a few dozen or so of them. I returned a failure. The Dark Lord had less trust in me from then on, and he went himself to stop the Purists. He said he killed them all, but I doubt he succeeded.”
"Come on, we'll go back to my house. I can only take two at a time with apparition, so you come first with Teddy, and then I'll come back for Harry and Hermione."
"It's okay. I know it's hard for you right now." She paused. "You know… the rest of us aren't exactly sailing through either… It's different, but I've been talking to Blaise, and, well, we've had similar experiences. People still tiptoe around us, or sneer at us… You should come back to the old gang, Draco."
He still didn't know why he had got the job. He almost hadn't applied at all, so sure that he would be denied, given the fact that he was literally a Death Eater. He even had the fucking tattoo, for Merlin's sake. But something had made him send in the application, and for some reason, he had been accepted.
“Andromeda? What are you doing here?” He asked, as he knelt down to ruffle Teddy’s hair. “Hey, Ted.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t sure saying anything would help. Instead, he took the necklace from Draco’s hands, feeling his heart jump as his fingers brushed against Draco’s.
After a few seconds, he shot out of the fire in the Ministry of Magic foyer, managing to land on his feet with some semblance of grace. Hermione joined him shortly afterwards, and brushed them both down with the brush she kept in her handbag before they made their way up to the Auror offices.
Hermione looked up from the dining room table, her hair pulled back out of her face in some semblance of a messy bun. “Oh, hi Harry,” she said absently, “how did it go?”
“They didn’t know it was there,” Harry said, still breathing heavily, “they only found out about it when we did. Which means that someone inside the Ministry told them.”
“I haven’t forgotten, Pansy, but it seems our friend Draco has forgotten who exactly got all of our family members killed - or worse, put in Azkaban.”
“We heard a noise, is everything okay-” Potter was cut off by the delighted barks of the dog, who removed itself from Draco and began to bound around the room in happy circles, before jumping back to Draco, who put out a tentative hand to scratch the dog behind the ears. It closed its eyes and started panting.
"Draco, don't," Narcissa said, and Draco looked away. He took a few steps until he was standing next to Harry.
Posters on the walls of his Quidditch team - the Falmouth Falcons - the biggest one with seven signatures on it from when they’d gone to see the Falcons at their final match against the Chudley Cannons in 1993; another poster, this one of his favourite band at the time, the Wyrd Sisters; a Slytherin house banner.
“Obliviators have already sorted out Muggle eye witnesses, and we want to keep this as quiet as possible. The Prophet can’t know about this. As far as anyone else knows, it’s a Muggle serial killer. It is
Draco shrugged. “A safe? Maybe a hidden compartment, something like that. Probably should have asked him where to find it.”
“Alright, everyone,” Robards called, “As you are aware, there was an attempted attack on Amyra Collins, one of the wizards we interviewed in trying to find out about the Muggle killings. Since then, there have been two more Muggles that have been killed. We are in crisis mode. The Muggle authorities can’t figure out what’s killing the Muggles, as the killers are using the unforgivable curse. To them, it just looks like a bunch of perfectly healthy people are dropping dead for no reason. We need to stop this before it gets out of hand. We could be looking at a breach of the Secrecy Act if we aren’t careful.”
“I’m sorry, Sir,” Harry said, as Robards ran a hand through his thinning hair. “I had to know what was happening. But I can promise you, Malfoy had nothing to do with it - I didn’t tell him what the letter said.”
“Then please, enlighten me on why a beautiful man with a voice that sends shivers down my lesbian spine has given you his number, and you
Harry paused. “I think… I know him better now. I don’t know if I can say he’s a good person. But he’s definitely trying. He wouldn’t pull something like this - not now.”
“Potter!” He turned around to see Robards waving him down. “I was hoping to catch you here- can I have a word?”
“It’s alright. I know… we want to bury our pasts. But, you are better now. You became an Auror. That is not an easy thing to do.”
Potter turned and muttered a spell that Draco couldn’t hear, pointing out the window. Nothing seemed to happen.
“The study’s upstairs,” Draco said, and walked briskly towards the staircase. He wanted to get out of the foyer as quickly as possible, he didn’t want to think about his mother-
“You didn’t drag me into it. And it didn’t get in the way of the mission. We still got the information we needed, even if we did get a little bit… sidetracked.” Potter smiled, almost mischievously. “And besides, it’s over now. We can tell Robards what we learned, he can send some people to go get the records from the Manor, and then we go find these Purists.”
"Hermione told me you were leaving, so I thought I'd come say goodbye." Her tone was slightly accusatory, just enough that Harry realised he'd done something wrong.
“For someone who hates Muggles so much, it feels weird that he entrusted his secrets to a simple safe,” Harry said.
The woman behind the desk looked Harry up and down. “Are you sure you don’t need the emergency ward?” She said, her eyes lingering on his arm. Harry looked down, and was surprised to see blood slowly staining his shirt.
Pansy had recently cut her hair. She had a long bob, with a shaved part at the bottom. Her hair was currently loose, hiding the undercut. She had several ear piercings, and wore a black crop top with ripped jeans.
“As if Ginny will even notice whether we’ve got bloody gnomes or not,” Ron said, reaching deep into a bush to pull out one of the little creatures.
Hermione nodded. “I’ll see you two there, I just have a couple of things to finish up first.” She bustled off to her desk.
They sat down on the old couch in the living room, and a few minutes later, Dean and Neville walked in, followed by a very sheepish looking Ron. Harry stood up to hug each of them, followed by Hermione, who stopped awkwardly before Ron and settled for a wave.
A smile split across her face. "I'm great. A bit tired, but they have me something to drink and the anaesthetic has pretty much worn off. I can't feel any pain, either."
“We faked her death, and exchanged her body with a different dead body disguised as hers, while she escaped…”
Draco sat in front of her. "It's alright, Mother. I'm just glad you're sane. From your last letters, I thought-" Draco stopped abruptly, and glanced back at Harry.
Potter sat down on the porch, and Draco sat next to him. There were a few moments of silence before Potter spoke.
As it turned out, he needn’t have worried - he and Andromeda were the only other guests apart from Draco himself, and Pansy Parkinson.
They spent most of the train ride in amicable silence, until Harry looked over at Malfoy to see him clenching his fists and chewing his lip.
Blaise, and his house elf. Nollit. What did ‘treating her well enough’ mean? The way they had treated Dobby had been considered a norm for house elves…
“Don’t tempt me,” Draco said, with a small smile, walking into his bedroom. He sat down at his desk, and opened one of the boxes containing all of the Collins’ journals. He had told Robards his findings about the ‘Purists’, and had been ordered to further investigate.
"I, uh," Harry trailed off, realising how stupid his reasoning sounded, "I had a dream that you had been hurt." He avoided her skeptical gaze. "There was a couple that we interviewed before you about the Muggle killings that were murdered a few days ago. I got paranoid."

Amyra scoffed. "Oh, Dumbledore had a thing for broken people." She stirred her tea and sighed. "Listen, Harry… Dumbledore wasn't exactly a good person. He used and manipulated people that he could take advantage of. Severus Snape was one of them, once Lily married James. Remus Lupin was also one of them. You were too, Harry."
“He’s only a couple minutes late, sir-” Harry started, before Draco ran in, stopping next to them, breathing heavily.
Draco sighed. “His hometown was destroyed by Death Eaters. And I’m pretty sure my father was one of them.”
to see you after all this time. How long has it been? Days, weeks, months, years, decades… no matter, no matter, come and give your father a hug.” He made a motion to move towards them, but was stopped instantly by the chains. “Ah, forgot about that little problem. They won’t take these off. Come here, Draco, let me see your face properly.”
Harry looked at the clock. He only had fifteen minutes left at home before he had to go out into the field with Malfoy and Robards.
Potter stopped pacing, and looked as if he was about to say something, when there was a sudden loud crack behind him, and Hermione Granger appeared, looking distinctly frazzled.
“I love you too, dumbass.” She pulled him in for a hug. Leo jumped up on the couch, barking happily and trying to lick their faces.
Did Robards really think he was that thick? He could have figured out there was something going on, even if he hadn’t overheard them talking before.
Harry nodded, and broke away from Neville to hug Seamus. “It’s really great to see all of you,” he said.
Dean came back, wielding a bowl of chips. “So, Harry, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?” He asked, sitting down next to Seamus.
In one of his insomnia phases, and in desperation, when instead of heading to the Astronomy Tower, he ventured off to the Potions Storeroom which was, strangely, unlocked.  Briefly he wondered since Snape was dead, was that the reason the Storeroom was unlocked? He picked a Crup Sleeping Draught, or three for good measure, and prayed to Merlin this one would do the trick. It was meant for crups, but well, it was under ‘Sleeping Potions’ in the Storeroom so he supposed it would work. The damn elixir never worked.
"Because we need to learn about Antidotes in general before venturing onto Poison Antidotes," Hermione said as a matter-of-fact.
Harry groaned. "I liked the class before. Oh, by the way, is no one talking about the pink carnation or how Professor Binns passed through The Veil?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Trelawney is permanently out of her marbles. That woman was batshit crazy. So glad I dropped it after my OWLS."
The following day at lunchtime, Madam Pomfrey made her way downstairs to the Great Hall where students of Hogwarts were having a hearty feast. She made a sharp right and walked over to the Slytherin table. She spotted Malfoy first, his head turned to Nott, talking in hushed tones, fast and furious as if in an argument. With Zabini and Parkinson's backs to her, she did not know what they were saying but they seemed to be involved in the bickering as well.
Harry frowned. But why would Fat Friar not believe that Salazar was capable of murdering Muggleborns? Harry knew as well as anyone that truth, more often than not, was stranger than fiction and therefore believed Salazar, to some extent, did murder Muggleborns and somebody somewhere was upset. Very upset. So upset that something horrible happened to him.
“We can trust no one. I have a strong sense that Salazar realized that in the end before his demise. And even after.”
Harry leaned forward, his nose almost brushing against the portrait. “He… Godric was an Animagus? He had the capability?”
"The dead deserve to rest in peace, don't they? Imagine after all these hundreds and hundreds of years, neither Salazar nor Godric have found any rest because neither of their wishes was fulfilled. And their history erased from history books because someone along the line deemed Salazar unworthy to be mentioned nor respected Godric's wishes because of Salazar's history."
Harry spluttered. "I thought he was dying! He kept, like, disappearing from my eyes and insisting I fetch a Pureblood witch or wizard."
Harry gawked internally. This fella did not wake up from his slumber for nearly 500 years after drinking the potion? His eyes drifted to the cauldron on the table and wondered how terrible could this potion be?
“Nah, I’m good. Hi, Hermione!” She put her trunk down at the door and gave Hermione a long hug. “It’s good to see you.”
A week or so passed with similar results. They would find the house, ask the person some questions, and find out absolutely nothing. Many of them, like Rex, had tried to hide their connection to the wizarding world. Others were simply trying to move past their past, and some seemed to have disappeared completely, their houses now owned by different people.
Draco turned and walked towards the podium, and Harry stood frozen for a moment before taking the remaining seat next to Pansy.
“If the Purists knew about the safe, why would they wait so long to collect it? They could have gone and got it from the Manor at any time, but they didn’t.”
"Yeah, yeah, of course we will." Her phone buzzed. "Speaking of which... it's this girl I met the other night, Lana." She picked up the phone. "Hey! Yeah, I'm free... that sounds good... I'll be over in half an hour... bye!" She grinned at Draco. "Duty calls. There's a very pretty girl who
After a few minutes of painfully awkward silence punctuated only by Blaise’s house elf bringing them tea, Pansy cleared her throat.
"I see." She closed her eyes, and stumbled for a moment. Draco put his arm out to catch her. "I'm sorry, I… My head feels a bit fuzzy. With the guard dementor gone, I can at least think straight, but I can't…" She stumbled again, and sat down on the floor, the chains clinking against the ground.
The new recruits had been put straight to work, with training squeezed into their schedules. There was a senior auror put to train the recruits, in pairs, as well as general classes.
She paused. "I'll miss you, Draco. We hardly have time to talk like this, or watch movies, or anything."
He couldn’t go back home. Pansy was… busy, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself. His lungs burned as he came to a halt outside another block of flats, and realised what area of town he was in.
“It’s a letter between two of the head Aurors. It’s not explicit, but… I think it’s enough to start suspicion.”
“Blaise, we were just saying how good the food is smelling,” Millicent crooned as Blaise took his seat next to her.
He stared at her. “I was kind of, you know, a Death Eater. And before that, I bullied people for like, six years.”
He slowly opened the front door, and stood outside the Weasley’s house, breathing in the fresh country air. The stars were so clear there, unlike in London, where Venus was hardly visible some days.

Draco vaguely remembered stumbling around with Pansy, both trying to lean on the other for support, giggling, when they'd seen them.
The library was organised terribly, and there appeared to be no search system whatsoever. Finding a book that even mentioned organisations targeting Muggles was near impossible.
