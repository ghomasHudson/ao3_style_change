"I'm having dinner with Potter," he said to himself. The words didn't make it any more believable and the wind was picking up, so he turned heel and Apparated to The Witch's Brew.
He was just about to suggest they slow down when he felt a familiar crushing sensation and the kitchen vanished from around him. When the air returned to his lungs, he was in a small bedroom dominated by a large wood-frame bed with Potter sprawled across it.
“Is that—” he began in a whisper, but Draco cut him off with a nod. They walked a little closer before Draco pointed to Harry and then the ground. Harry took the hint and stopped. As Draco proceeded to the cave alone, he stomped heavily in contrast to his usual graceful steps. He stood in the clearing outside of the cave for a long moment, and Harry watched his tall figure against the bright blue of the sky behind him.
“Some people think they’re shagging,” Malfoy murmured in his ear as he reached across him for the bread basket.  “I think they just stay up all night talking about dragons.” Whether it was that Malfoy was confiding in him or the warm breath on his skin, Harry shivered.
* * *
It really wasn't so different from kissing. Larger than a tongue, yes, but firm and warm in the same way. Draco focused on Potter's noises and squirms, trying to get as much reaction as possible.
Harry would feel this all night, and it made the thought of naked dinner with Luna even more awkward.  Oh God.  What if he dripped?
was sitting, it’s anus was certainly making contact with the counter. The creature didn’t have any sort of buttocks to act as buffer between where it produced waste and where Draco had made tea just that morning.
“Dumb luck?” Harry cut in.  After all of the sycophancy from
No longer distracted by the press of their arousal, they slowly bathed each other. Harry washed Draco’s hair, wondering at the way his hair felt even softer in the stream of the shower. Draco gave Harry and himself a very thorough cleaning of cock and arse, filling Harry’s mind with numerous possibilities for the rest of the night.
Draco watched him with his piercing eyes for several long moments, but he lowered them back to his book when he spoke.  “And Teddy’s guardian is comfortable with him visiting my family?”
If the Aurors wouldn't protect him, he'd have to go into hiding. But Claudius would know about each of the Malfoy holdings, and Draco had no property from his mother's family. He collapsed into a chair.
Most of the guests were people Harry liked, but there were some exceptions, the most blatant being Parkinson. The dislike was mutual, as she demonstrated by glaring at Harry as she arrived. Luckily she kept her mouth shut, simply snatching a flute of champagne and walking off to join Blaise in the living room.
“Get 'way from 'im,” Potter managed to say, “or I'll curse buttocks—bollocks—off.
* * *
Ron looked up again. 'Anyway, I'll be waiting for your Fire-call some time after five. Get back to the boyfriend before he gets suspicious.'
Draco's large hands grabbed Harry's hips tightly as he pressed forward.  There was a moment of tension when Harry's body wouldn't give at all, and then he let himself relax and accept Draco inside him.  It burned like mad, and there was no relief when the head passed inside.  The shaft itself was too thick.  There was no give, no wiggle room, just a solid weight inside him forcing him to accept it.
The only thing about the Burrow that didn't bring Draco peace of mind was the frequent visits by Harry Potter. Seeing Potter made Draco's body fall apart: his skin felt too small, his fingers fumbled over everything, and his stomach was suddenly full of doxies. Potter was perfectly civil, but there was a palpable tension between them. Draco couldn't talk to Potter without his tongue becoming heavy and slow, so he would talk to anyone else in the room. Potter soon gave up trying to engage Draco in conversation and started to just
Despite his comment about never looking at her again, he certainly didn't want to keep his back to her, so he settled for glaring at a spot on his sofa beside her.
He would have gone downstairs just for some company, but Charlie and Pavel were out in the field with a couple of researchers from their sister reserve in New Zealand. He could have gone to the inn, but he knew that a crowd could be lonelier than solitude.
He wanted to be using his talent for Potions to help the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and the Aurors solve cases involving illegal potions.  Clearwater, as Head of the Department, was in charge of all interdepartmental assignments, so he'd been cajoling her for the past three years in the hopes that she would finally let him use his skills for something of interest.
Pomfrey gave her a sad smile. “A Healer is of little use anyway. The potions will help with comfort, but there is little that can be done but to let the illness run its course. Miss Abbott will be fine. As will you if you catch it. And house-elves will be bringing meals and checking on you throughout the day.” Part of the joy of house-elves was their immunity to wizarding diseases.
When Potter’s friends sent their Patronuses, Draco summoned Kreacher again to tell them Potter was over the worst of the illness but resting.
* * *
"Yes."
Harry placed a comforting hand on Ron's shoulder and gestured with his chin to where Hermione had been drawn into conversation with the newest member of the Wizengamot. "Hermione looks radiant tonight." It was true. Her bronze robes were understated but flattering as they clung to her curves. "People will look at her. They will appreciate her looks and her intellect." As if on cue, the Wizengamot member leant closer and spoke with more passion. Ron tensed, but stayed by Harry's side. "Do you trust her?"
Another knock to his shoulder and Ron nodded to where the experts had broken apart. Draco was walking toward them looking confident, gorgeous, and smug. It really wasn’t fair how comfortable he looked in Harry’s own department. Harry barely managed to gesture for Draco to follow him back to his cubicle lest he choke on his own tongue in an attempt at speech.
“Well, well, Potter. Who knew? I mean, I expect young Aurors to be in shape, but you really are fit.” He stopped and reached out his hand as if to touch Harry’s waist before pulling back again. “Look what you’ve been hiding all these years. Not a scrawny thing at all.” He looked down Harry’s legs. “Knees are still knobbly, but grown men shouldn’t wear shorts anyway.”
now, wasn't he? How was that going to happen? Ron. As if they were
Draco's eyes widened, but movement drew Harry's eyes to his lips. Lips. Pink, soft-looking lips. Clever lips slightly parted in surprise at Harry's words. Oh, Merlin. Harry wanted to kiss him. Not just in some memory from a romantic moon-lit beach. He wanted to kiss Draco right there against their sitting room wall and never stop. Giddiness and relief rushed through him as he slowly regained confidence in his own feelings.
“Of course I’m sure. You still do the chocolate cake, right? The one Ron was obsessed with?”
Slowly sensation returned.
They were in a room. With a bed. Alone.
Draco woke in Potter's soft white bed to memories of messy kisses and frantic hand jobs between sheets that still smelled of sex and sweat. Soft kisses pressed against his hair and Potter's earthy scent washed over him from behind. He couldn't resist pressing back into the solid heat, even if it was a bit like cuddling. Potter wouldn't mind.
He ate a poisoned apple and woke up in white emptiness. So was this all there was for eternity? He heard a distant echo of shouting, but he couldn't place the voices or the words. Just as suddenly, it was gone. Draco forced his feet to keep moving. When sound returned, it was quite murmurs and desperate pleading, but Draco could make out nothing more than the tone. There were sobs.
to play for his House team. Not that there was any chance of Slytherin being allowed to lose. And the new dress robes his mother gave him had simply accentuated how thin and pasty he had become. That Christmas he had gotten everything he would have wanted as a younger boy, but he finally saw how useless it all was when the lives of his family were on a knife's edge.
“Draco.”  Harry gathered the last of his courage and ignored the shattered remains of his pride.  “I just want you to know that I like you.  I like being your friend, and the sex is fantastic, but I really like you and . . . if you ever think that maybe . . . if you ever think you could want something more . . .”  Draco was staring at him and he felt the flush staining his own cheeks.  At least Draco wasn’t laughing.  Yet.  He shrugged to show that he was out of words.  What more could he say?
the dragons.”
Potter stood close to Draco and offered several casual touches as he gave a tour of the ground floor of the cottage that ended in a large kitchen painted in a cheerful yellow. Draco seated himself at the long wooden table as Potter took his place in front of the range.
He took a deep breath and let it out.  Draco wiggled beneath him.  “Still with me?” he drawled lazily despite their position.  Harry had to laugh.  Draco was naked and spread out with Harry's cock up his arse, yet he still managed to talk down to Harry with that dry tone and an arched brow.
Harry nearly walked into the entryway wall in surprise.  "You called me Harry."  It was a stupid thing to say, but Malfoy mercifully let it go.
'I had help, but the catering and champagne was all me.' Harry wasn't usually one to demand credit, but it suddenly seemed very important for Draco to know how much he had done. He had spent weeks racking his brain over each detail and giving up every lunch break to shop or plan for the party.
“Hope you weren't expecting a variety of take-away options,” Malfoy said smugly.
Once they were shivering in the dark a little ways from the door, Hermione let loose on him. She had apparently noticed all his door watching and how he always left when Draco arrived. "You were the one who said I could trust him to help with D.U.M.B. Why are you being so mean to him?" Harry tried to object, but Hermione insisted that fleeing at the sight of someone as if they carried the plague did, in fact, constitute being mean.
Malfoy seemed taller as he strode between the racks of clothing to where a brown leather sofa faced three fitting rooms in the corner. The area around the sofa was set up like a small sitting room with a plush rug and a wooden side table. The wall was dominated by a large oval mirror.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open as Harry called his name and squeezed his shoulder. "Wha …" And then he sat bolt upright. "Did they decide?"
to tell him. It must be hell for her to have gossip on Potter and have to keep quiet.
Potter still looked confused.
Harry didn’t … did he? Sure, he might make a comment if something reminded him of Draco, but that was rare. Well maybe not
." Of course, she was happy; she had been proven right. "And I think Harry Potter is a fine young man."
Hermione looked impressed. What? Like Harry didn’t have good ideas now and then? So what if he was cheating by having Malfoy’s own words.
Potter’s eyes lit up as he smiled. “I’d have endured doilies for you.”
“Fuck off, Blaise.”
“I was really impressed with your report on the case,” Potter went on, “Even Ron was saying how great you were, and he's not usually your biggest fan.”
Draco appeared from thin air as he dropped to his knees beside Harry’s aching chest. Cool hands ran over Harry’s face and arms as if searching for further injury.
“You stay. This isn’t your job.” He could feel the argument brewing but he pressed Draco back harder. “You can Apparate back to the Ministry or you can stay here. I’ll send my Patronus when it’s safe.”
When will you stop pinching my arse, he silently questioned.   Useless cow .  Contrary to his thoughts, he threw another brown-nosing smile over his shoulder before heading into her office.

friends. He'd force them apart—with a Severing Charm, if necessary—and
hope Potter was peeking, and he certainly did not clench his buttocks to make his bum look more pert.
Draco hated the thought of not being able to pop in on Pansy at any time. She was his best friend and sometimes he
The magical food festival in Paris had been inspiring and well worth the trip. Draco and Aida had stayed for all four days of cooking demonstrations, lectures, and tastings while they met and caught up with various chefs and food critics.  Aida had even met a promising sous chef she was trying to recruit to the hotel. After the festival ended, Draco and Aida had travelled to the south of France to visit Aida’s family and enjoy the way the local cuisine made use of seafood. Aida would be there for two more weeks seeing loved ones and collecting new recipes and ideas, but Draco was eager to get home.
Harry shifted under Draco’s condescending gaze. Put that way, the last week seemed far more interesting and important than Harry had realised. Draco stomped on and Harry found the other man’s upset weighing on him.
He stripped and climbed into the shower. It felt wonderful to be clean, but as he stood rinsing the shampoo from his hair he felt his legs protesting the standing as his lungs took issue with the hot, wet air. He began coughing as he rinsed the last of the suds away and fumbled for a towel.
“So?  It's not like you need the job or the measly pay that comes with it.”  Draco knew that Blaise resented having to work for the Ministry.  His mother married for money and rarely worried about that money making it to any of her children.  The fact that she had gotten him an easy job with the Wizengamot that came with power and benefits did nothing to diminish his bitterness about having to work at all.
Weasley was the first to leave—explaining that Granger was due back from a business trip that night—and Draco managed to bite back any comment about who was the dominant in that relationship. Neville started collecting glasses and helping his girlfriend clean up, so Potter and Draco took the cue to leave.
“Voldemort did mark Draco’s arm. That was confirmed by the Aurors when collecting information to decide whether to press charges against him. It was also confirmed Draco was a schoolboy and a legal minor and in no position to refuse.”
He pulled the Protean-Charmed Galleon out of his pocket and flung it down in front of him on the table.  Hermione had improved the coins since fifth year, and the coins now allowed letters as well as numbers and also allowed communication to go both ways.
Malfoy shrugged and gave him a small, slanted smile. "Paris was never forever. It was good to get away, but this is home."
He found himself fidgeting with one of the Muggle things Merryn used at her school instead of a quill. A pen, he thought she called it. He looked at its clear sides and the line of blue ink inside it. He had to admit it was quite convenient the way it came with its own ink. It was probably nice not to have to worry about ruffled feathers. Quills were supposedly charmed not to break, but Draco had opened his school bag more than once at Hogwarts to find a quill with a bent or snapped end.
He gave Draco a dazzling smile to show just what he thought of their evening so far.  "Brilliant."
Harry followed.
Harry felt his face go cold. "No! Your mother is scary protective." He hoped Narcissa didn’t know how Harry had been treating her son all summer.
The door swung open to reveal two heads of wild black hair. Harry and Merryn jostled each other as they both pressed forward to embrace him. Merryn mumbled something about “daft” and “knocking” into his shoulder, and Draco just smiled and held her tighter. Harry pulled back just enough to kiss Draco firmly on the lips, which led to Merryn pulling away with a sound of disgust.
for our first day as a couple.'
Draco, romancing him, through—what? A group date? Looking around at the floating candles, flowers, and garlands, he realised the setting he'd created was more appropriate for a candle-lit dinner for two than a birthday party with work colleagues and school friends.
* * *
How was he meant to read this bloody thing? Right. Notes from murder cases. History of the Bloodrot Potion. A mess of information about the various ingredients involved including the Ministry classification. Harry knew it would be important to sort which ingredients were legal and not, but he could barely keep his eyes on the page. He was beginning to feel rather peckish as well, but he didn’t want to be the first to stop working. Finally Draco set his file down and held up a sheet of parchment with a three column grid.
Draco dropped to his seat and forced himself to finish his report; it would make things easier for his replacement after Weasley Hexed him into the next millennium. Draco hoped they didn't have three-legged races in the future.
Harry’s mind was racing through a fog. He had so many thoughts and yet he couldn’t make a single one make sense. Was Malfoy telling Harry to open his trousers? Or was he speaking in hypotheticals? He was so close, his warm breath tickling Harry’s neck and cheek. Surely that wasn’t normal. Surely that was an invitation. Harry certainly wanted it to be one.
Draco's whole body went rigid.   Shit!  What had he done wrong?  Maybe Draco still didn't trust him.  Maybe Draco had been with men who were too rough and hurt him.  The thought made Harry sick and he vowed to make tonight pleasurable for Draco.
* * *
When Draco awoke, Potter was staring at him. They both stayed frozen in their beds staring across the space between them with closed expressions. Was Potter going to thank him? Would they have to talk or could they go back to ignoring each other? Whatever was going to happen, Draco wanted it over with before the awkwardness could grow.
“I'll spend Christmas with the Weasleys with you, if you come with me to Vienna for New Year's.”  Harry's whole face glowed as his smile transformed him.  It was beautiful and it filled Draco with hope that this would work.  He would have Harry, and not just as a lover or a bodyguard.
“What did you name him, Draco?”  Draco’s eyes widened at Luna’s use of his given name.
Malfoy was almost to the forest, and Harry quickened his pace to keep him in sight as he neared the low branches of the outer trees. Harry had first seen Malfoy leaving the castle on the Marauder’s Map and, suddenly eager to watch Malfoy again, he had hurried to follow him. He didn’t bother himself with a reason for all his watching. Reasons were for Ravenclaws.
'Anything interesting happen in the wizarding world?' he asked as he finally entered the room. It wouldn't do to let the tea go cold.
Draco felt a coldness that was unrelated to Potter taking all his cosy heat away. "Weasley and Longbottom? No, I don't think they would want—that's probably not a good idea."
Harry didn't have the heart to tell her that he had meant to avoid Draco by choosing Herbology, so he simply made a vague comment about going with his stronger subject and then asked about dinner.
"I've been an angel since the war." He tried his doe eyes on Pansy, but she was immune. Her constant querying began to make him nervous. "Why? Has Potter said anything about me?"
“The good news is that this particular Potion includes Squib’s Friend, and Squib’s Friend is a real bitch to grow.” He sat on Harry’s desk and stretched his long legs out across the floor. Harry had to resist reaching over to find his thighs under all that grey fabric.
“That’s not—”  Draco snapped his mouth shut.  From his wince, he may have actually bitten his tongue.  He lifted his chin stubbornly, and Harry wondered what he was hiding.
Harry looked back at Ron and saw the little furrow of concern on his brow. He understood. Perhaps the dignitary thought the dance would lead to something. Perhaps he viewed dancing as foreplay. It didn't matter. Draco would correct any misconceptions.
“Guess who I saw in the Atrium?” Ron asked, dropping his gloves and hat on the floor by the coat rack, before removing his damp travel cloak. He gave the cloak a shake, spraying water over a Wanted poster on the wall.
“Have you been in touch with her since the war?” Harry asked when they’d reached the privacy of their own flat several hours later.  There was no need to specify whom he meant.
The door jingled pleasantly as Malfoy opened it. “Potter. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Malfoy’s tone was dry, but not hostile, which was as much as Harry could hope for.
Antero’s words will be enough to ease pain and discomfort, but he will not be able to heal like his mother alone.
One by one the seven Weasleys filed in with snarky comments and playful ribbing. Luckily most of it was aimed at one another, and Draco received nothing but praise for the breakfast he served them. When Draco set out packed lunches for them to take to work, more than one eye looked dangerously moist.
“Right then.” Draco pulled out the wand Harry had used to end the war and conjured a beautifully carved chair with red velvet cushions. “Let’s see what drivel has made it into the file thus far.” He sat down, crossing one long leg over the other and displaying a black boot laced with a series of delicate silver hooks. The leather was so rich and supple.
The duvet was now neatly spread across the bed covering Harry's side as well as Draco's. Harry smiled to himself as he stopped at the doorway to watch Draco's face as he read: a dip of his brow, a slight parting of his lips, a widening of his eyes, a hint of a smile. Watching Draco read the news was far better than anything the papers ever printed.
He returned to the living room and his eyes found Draco immediately. He was standing near the bar the caterers had set up with Padma and a tall man who must be her boyfriend. Could it be Padma? Was the unhealthy part that she was with another man? Draco had seemed worried that Harry might fancy Padma. Was he jealous? Fighting down panic, Harry forced himself to be still and observe the three.
Harry thought that was a damn good idea.  There would be no dripping.
“Of course, Potter,” Draco purred. “I should have known you’d be enormous.”
He hadn’t thought to grab any clothing on the way in, but at least he had large covering towels to wear out.
"I'm sorry," Draco murmured. "I'm so sorry."
"Harry!"  She ran down and hugged him, and he was so focused on Malfoy that he was spared the awkwardness of being hugged by a very naked friend.  She noticed his lack of attention and turned toward Malfoy.  "Oh, you've met Draco.  Well, of course you
“Tell me Potter, is there any part of Hogwarts you didn’t nose your way into?”
"I heard you spent the night with Potter."
Harry bumped their shoulders together playfully.
“You’re sure about this?”
Draco stood very still staring out Harry’s sole window.  Finally, he looked at Harry.  “I heard my name.”
That was unusual. Draco was sure that all of the Weasleys still shopped at Madam Malkins. Perhaps George? He did go in for high-end purchases more often then the rest, but Twilfitt and Tattings did not carry the flamboyant styles he favoured. In his curiosity, Draco made his way to the peep-hole. A portly little wizard stood at the door frowning at his pocket watch and then at the door. "It's eleven o'clock. You called for a fitting."
"Fine! Harry Potter is cooking dinner for me at his house. We met up at an event in the spring but he’s an idiot, so he thought I was married until this morning. Happy?"
“If you’re so interested, you could have come visit me!”
Of course! Harry had been so worried about being inexperienced that he hadn't considered that Draco might be too. They were doing this together, both new and unsure. Harry rather liked that idea.
Harry had handed Draco off to Hermione without any sign of suspicion. Draco had grumbled a token amount about working on a Saturday, but by the time he'd put on his travelling cloak, he'd already been nattering away about the possible effects of quotas on hiring practices. Hermione had just winked at Harry behind Draco's back, and then they'd Apparated away.
But as he led Draco down to the kitchen a few minutes later, he couldn’t help but wonder if Draco might join him at the Burrow the Sunday before Christmas when the Weasleys had their big party. And maybe Narcissa might have room for one more at Malfoy Manor on Christmas Eve. Surely it would be lonely with just Draco and her, as Lucius still had another year in Azkaban. He decided to ask Draco at a moment when he couldn’t say no. Like maybe the moment before taking Draco's cock down his throat.
“Ready to go?” the witch asked from a door that must have led to the kitchen. He nodded.
“I just meant that you were both at Hogwarts that final year and—”
He saw Potter nod from the corner of his eye. "I'll meet you here after work, but I don't want to go to Malfoy Manor," Potter said. Draco was about to argue, but Potter didn't give him a chance. "In fairness, I assume you don't want to go to the Burrow."
testimony in Draco Malfoy’s favour.” She had that same look in her eye that Ron got during a chess game. She was enjoying this.
He turned to peer back into the tunnel and felt cool fingers poke him in the face.
as my hair and clothing usually are.”
* * *
He barely dared to hope. "No. Why?"
The contrast between the ashen, painfully thin Draco Malfoy of his memories of the war hearings and the one who strolled into the Ministry three years later had been enough to render Harry speechless.  He had stood frozen in the Atrium taking in the tall, confident walk, the lean muscle, and the faint pink tint that spoke of three years of health and peace.  It was then that he had first noticed the perfectly shaped, muscular arse.
Despite Potter’s privacy charm, Draco still found the meal less enjoyable than it should have been. Aida’s cooking was as fine as ever, and yet Draco felt he could hardly taste it as he tried to ignore Gabby’s eyes on him. He only barely controlled his startle when Potter covered his hand with his own.
These were all rather alarming realisations for Draco, especially with them being locked up together. It was a good thing he had them after his fevered dreams or he might have said rather embarrassing things to Potter. Although the dreams might have been better. Less Snape dancing and more Potter in a towel.
Potter scowled and it was far more authentic than the pout had been.  “Harry.”  It took Draco a moment to understand Potter's objection.
“Why would I—do you think they'd even let , I mean want, me in their house, let alone at Christmas?
The Wizengamot better decide soon, Harry decided. He didn’t want Draco on tenterhooks for days. "Not yet. It’s just that Hermione and Oliver are due in a few."
They continued as usual—eating, drinking, and discussing neutral topics—until they finished their first round of after dinner drinks.
"Ooh. You lucky dog." Romilda Vane's shrill voice was too close to his ear as she pressed up against him to read the parchment over his shoulder. Nosey bint. Aurors usually didn't come to the Curse-Breaker division, but Vane was always there pestering Draco and sniffing for gossip. "You can tie me to Harry Potter any time," she cooed. She dropped her head onto Draco's shoulder—curly black hair tickling his face—and sighed dramatically.
was standing in a field with
“Well, then let’s see if it can rival the treacle tart at Hogwarts.”
He tapped the kettle with his wand and it whistled instantly.  That was one of the perks of magic that would never grow old.  He poured it over the teabag in his favourite Hungarian Horntail mug and left it to steep, as he pulled out frying pans, eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, beans, and bread.  With a flick of his wand, everything flew to the correct pan and began simmering away.  Harry smiled.  He threw out his teabag and poured in a dollop of milk.
He laid very still, feeling Potter's chest rise and fall beneath him and listening to their mingled panting.  As his heart rate and breathing slowed, he started to doubt he was dreaming.  His mind struggled with the unlikely fact that he had just pulled Harry Potter in reality.
“Comfy,” came the muffled reply.
"That a yes, then?"
Now here he was with a very drunk Harry Potter.  “Had a bit to drink?” Draco teased.
"I do love a long, firm courgette."
Draco’s dancing eyes meant there was more good news. “With the addition of the controlled plants they must be growing, I am almost certain they are growing in Wales.” He pulled out a map and circled an area with Harry’s quill. “Probably here.”
when I think someone will expose Merryn to danger.”
It was that last word that gave Harry his courage. That complex syllable with all its little sounds uttered so easily, as if it were a genuine, non-repulsive option for them.
He took another bite and washed it down with water.
Harry blinked against the morning light pouring in the windows.  Not only was Draco’s room bigger, it had more windows, and Harry found it impossible to sleep in with so much light.  He had suggested they use the curtains, but Draco had refused.  Draco said that he liked to fall asleep to the starry sky at night and wake with the sun in the morning.  Harry glanced over at his boyfriend’s still form bathed in sunlight up to his neck.  His head was hidden under a pillow.
Harry scowled. 'Ron, he is
A cool hand slid against his cheek and pulled him from his fevered thoughts. “Potter? Do you want to know?” Malfoy looked smug and delicious, and Harry’s cock was hard just from being so close to him. Of course Harry wanted to know if Malfoy was as affected as he was! He nodded, and Malfoy’s smile cracked into a feral grin. “Well, then.” The hand on Harry’s cheek dropped to Harry’s shoulder and gently pressed down.
Harry felt as if he had fallen into his own body. All sound was muffled by the rushing of blood and Parkinson appeared far away as if he were watching her from the back of his skull.
“I’m holidaying at the Hotel Kalmynsi, and my stay will overlap with the Angove-Bronstein wedding, which I have kindly been invited to attend while there.”
“Honestly! What’s the use of wizarding space if you still have to squeeze your dick into tight trousers?” Malfoy gestured to his own crotch, and Harry’s eyes obediently followed. “The material lies flat to give the look, but then you can hang free. Without a charm, Muggles have to chose a side and have their dick smashed against their leg. And if they get an erection…” He looked as if he couldn’t bear to continue the thought.
Yet once Harry and Draco had started to become friends, she had grown hostile again for no reason Harry could discover. He wondered if he'd accidentally offended her or if she was simply jealous of how close he'd become with
Had they missed one? Shit! Was Draco okay?
Charlie just smiled. “Good to hear.”
So it was more than a little odd to be enveloped in the broad chest and warm arms of Harry Potter. Draco was very slightly taller, and Potter's head seemed to rest easily on his shoulder. Potter's hands, as energetic as the rest of him, moved up and down his back in comforting loops of warm pressure. It all felt rather . . . nice.
"You knew I was coming?"  Harry had assumed it was just his usual luck that Draco had stumbled upon him naked in front of his house.
“I hope Harry hasn't gone off my pies.”  Rosie was standing by the table with a wry smile.  “Well, if your date's run off on you, why don't you come up and finish your meal at the bar?  It's a slow night and you can provide some company.”  Without waiting for a reply, she picked up his plate and carried it through to the other room.  Draco followed, drink in hand.
Draco slid down Potter's body until he was facing Potter's cock. He could do this. And if he gagged, so be it. Potter already knew this was Draco's first time. He lapped at the head of Potter's cock and heard an appreciative moan overhead. Well that was a good sign. He opened his mouth and took Potter in. The taste was a bit unusual, but not unpleasant. It really just tasted like skin, except for the bitterness of the moist head.
Draco grabbed his hand and all but dragged him up the stairs. Harry focused on the placement of each foot to keep his mind from what might be expected of him.
"Forgive me for being civilised." It was a bit awkward just standing in Potter's bedroom with Potter on the bed and the expectation of sex handing over them. "So um..."
Harry closed his eyes and let himself go to the sensations pulsing through him. A strong arm wrapped around him and he allowed himself to partially collapse against Draco’s chest.  God, he smelled good.
"So I thought we could keep up the practising and increase our speed," Potter said as they waited.
Malfoy’s voice was soft. “I still don’t go in deep.” He shuddered, and Harry wondered what image had crossed his mind. Voldemort drinking unicorn blood? Maybe the Acromantula that had attacked the castle with the Death Eaters the year before? “But the edges are home to different types of birds and squirrels.”
“So what do you think?” Charlie was looking at Harry with intense brown eyes, so much like Ginny’s and Mrs. Weasley’s. “Can you work with Draco?” He cocked his head to the side and narrowed his eyes slightly. “You know, if the two of you put the past aside, you’d probably work pretty well together, what with his understanding of dragons and your—”
Draco finally turned so Potter could see his glare. "What
Potter's hands were cupping his face and sliding into his hair.  He was kissing every part of Draco's face, returning again and again to his lips.  The kisses began to move down his jaw and neck as Potter's hands moved from his hair to his waist and then slipped under his jumper.
“The only other matter is dining. We usually have two different dining rooms open for each meal, but as you are our only guest…” Draco wasn’t sure how to end that sentence. He couldn’t say they didn’t want to bother with both. Luckily Potter just smiled—a smile that lit his whole face and did not make him look boyish at all—and said for Draco to just tell him where to be and when. Draco had a brief thought about how fun it would be to boss Potter around and have Potter actually obey, but that was quickly shut down. Not helpful.
“She's my boss.”   Idiot.
Now that he was there, with Weasley and Potter looking at him expectantly, it didn't seem so easy.  What did he say?   I came to tell you that you can shag me?  That would work on Blaise, but he sensed it wasn't the right approach for Potter.  Potter needed something more . . . friendly and . . . nice.
"That Muggle stuff that doesn't break?"
"I am not!" His instinct was to be contrary, but her predatory smile made him doubt his choice of reply.
'You should have asked me about the catering.' Flintridge had moved to their side and was speaking over Harry's arm. 'I know the owner. I could have gotten you a discount.'
"Potter."
Draco smirked as he handed Oliver a pint of stout. "How many stories did they get you to read?"
one abandoned, and now Draco was reading out an interesting review of the latest Dumbledore biography—co-written by Elphias Doge and Professor McGonagall—as Harry rested his head in his lap. It had taken months for them to be able to so much as mention Dumbledore or Snape in each other's presence, but now they could speak generally about the past without fear of an argument.
Epilogue
He began climbing the stairs again. “We are going upstairs to the kitchens off the main dining room.” He reached the first landing and led Harry down a hallway lined with portraits and paintings in golden frames. They walked by a large doorway which showed what must be the main dining room. It was a large room with walls the color of red wine and ornate chandeliers of twisted metal. Draco bypassed a small door and led Harry to the end of the hallway where Harry was met by gleaming stone countertops, shiny pots, and baskets of brightly colored vegetables.
Draco stared down at him for a moment. 'Harry. She's been dating Laurence Boot for two years. They met through his younger brother, who was in Padma's year in Ravenclaw. Does any of this sound familiar?'
“He wants to get married in Cornwall,” Leah went on. “He’s stayed at the hotel before. He said he got to know a couple of the people who work there and he’s sure he’ll be—we’ll be safe.”
They ended up having a rushed breakfast at a café around the corner—with no mimosas but a decent cup of loose leaf Earl Grey—so they could make the opening ceremony on time. Draco wasn't sure when he'd been tricked into sitting through tedious speeches at Potter's side; perhaps Potter was more cunning than Draco had realised.
That year there been more food, sweets, and presents than any other, but it had been the worst Christmas of Draco's life. Terror had hung over him, saturating the very air so that each breath poisoned him. The fear had made the food taste like ash and the sweets burn in his stomach. He hadn't want the new broomstick that was waiting for him under the tree. It only reminded him that, as the fastest flyer, he was now
Parkinson turned to look at him for the first time. Her brow was low in concentration as she strode forward, stopping a little too close to him. She stared at his face with her beady brown eyes, and he avoided her gaze by watching the bubbles float up her champagne flute and pop on the surface.

At that, Leah’s eyes risked falling out. “
Draco was off.
Draco’s breath ghosted over his ear once more. “Greenhouse.” And then the comforting weight on his shoulder was gone.
Kensa was standing in the doorway with Merryn at her side. It looked like they’d both been crying, but they now wore matching expressions of calm determination.
The burly one who worked with dragons came in next and inhaled with exaggeration. "It's almost like having Mum back." His smile was a bit too much like a leer for Draco's liking. "But with a nicer arse."
* * *
Draco mental cursed himself. How could he have been so careless? He should have opened the other windows by hand. He shouldn’t have let Potter into his kitchen. He shouldn’t have—
Ron started out the enchanted window at the imaginary sunny beach. “I was going to take her back in the spring for our anniversary, but with press like this the place may be gone by then. The rest of the article is people expressing their outrage and saying they are cancelling their reservations.”
Draco laughed. 'They were gossiping about us long before this. I'll bet everyone down there is saying,
was a git to us in school, but I’m actually kind of worried about this bad press. Hermione really liked the place. I did, too. Not just the cake.” He glared at Harry. “I know what you think, but I’m serious! Hermione actually relaxed there after a day or two. It’s so beautiful and peaceful. She actually went to the beach without a book or a report or anything. She just enjoyed herself.”
Harry watched in appreciation as Draco slowly dressed himself, cruelly hiding his lean muscle and porcelain skin with more and more fabric. As soon as Draco shut the hotel room door behind him, Harry had to decide whether to moan in longing or dance for joy because that fabulous creature was actually coming back.
Blaise shrugged and started to leave.  He turned back to Draco to say, “You can't keep this up forever.  At least I'm a friend.”  Draco briefly wondered why the last statement was true.
Potter made a groan, and it was not a sound of pain, but of desire.  “Yes, Draco.  Want you.”  Suddenly insistent lips were pressed to Draco's and his vision was filled with messy black hair.  The kiss was awkward, wet, and messy, but there was a passion to it that was compelling.
“He grabbed your arse!”  Potter seemed suddenly sober as his eyes flashed and he bared his teeth.
It wasn’t just Draco’s bladder that had him rushing into the lavatory each morning. He had to put a door between him and wet, almost-naked Potter before his interest made peeing impossible. There was plenty of time for thinking about Potter once he was under the hot spray of the shower.
Somehow the evening had become Phases Two through Five, and it had Draco worrying that Phases Four and Five wouldn't be done properly. A rushed plan too often became a ruined one, and he had little hope of shagging a Gryffindor without proper time and effort devoted to Romance and Seduction.
"Go lie down," Harry said softly.
Another door opened, and this time it was Luna.
“Do you want me to fuck you?”  Harry would have thought that Draco was taking the piss, but he sounded serious.  Harry didn’t know the purpose of the line of questioning, but he figured he owed Draco the truth after the scene he’d just forced him to witness.
The woman walks a long hallway made of cold stone. There are tapestries hanging between portraits of scowling faces surrounded by gold. The room is cold with great evil and the woman fears it. She wrings her hands and worries, but it is not for her own safety.
Draco looked to the window and saw the last traces of a golden sunset. How long had he and Potter been sharing a bed? Potter showed no signs of leaving the bed now that Draco was awake, and then Draco remembered it was Potter’s bed he had collapsed in after his shower. He tried to push himself up, but Potter promptly pushed him back down.

“Shouldn’t a witch visit her relatives?” Gwenna asked pointedly. She left it unsaid that a woman living with her dead husband’s aunt might not have grounds to criticize a woman visiting her own grandmother.
"That night … the morning after. The French paper came, and it had a picture of you and Scorpius and your wife, and I just assumed—"
Draco barked out a laugh, his whole face radiant and relaxed before his brows drew close again. “Wait, Weasley called me ‘Draco’?”
“That’s very funny,” Neville said. “Clever, but completely barmy.” He looked at Harry. “Course you would have no idea what he’s up to.” His eyes flicked to the side. “Your date approaches, so I’ll just say that good little pure-blood boys are raised not to have sex before the third date. I think Draco’s a little impatient, but not enough so to break with decorum.” He snorted a last laugh and clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Have fun tonight!”
His muscles relaxed in the heat, and the water seemed the carry away his tension.
Potter placed a firm hand on the small of his back and urged him forward. He had warned Draco that the Weasel and Longbottom had gone ahead and Weasley was likely to have started drinking. That didn't prepare him for Weasley's grin and wave from a stool at the bar.
, you idiot,' Parkinson spat. 'Draco is giving up any chance at a
Harry wanted to ask that they eat in the sunroom—casual sounded more his style—but he’d told Draco he would eat where he was told and he didn’t want to suddenly become difficult.
“Nice place.  That Hyde Park out there?”  Potter was gesturing out the window over the stairs.
Parkinson was ranting about sex, but Harry was stuck several words before.
“The best chance of discovering who is behind this is to discover where.” Harry knew the farm had to be in Britain or Ireland. The wards along the Channel were too strong to Apparate through, and they only accept official Portkeys which landed in the Ministry for a bag and body scan.
holiday there? Really? Ohmygod. We’re getting married the third weekend in April. The day before Easter! Oh please tell me you will be there!”
No. Harry could not work with Draco. He would stare and obsess and embarrass himself horribly. Luckily, he was pants at Potions and could use that as an excuse. It certainly sounded more professional than admitting he was fighting down a stiffy.
“Oh, Potter.
Before Harry could reply, dinner was announced, and they were shepherded into a large ballroom lit with dozens of crystal chandeliers. It was only Harry’s Auror training that had him noting the gold-trimmed vaulted ceiling and the floor to ceiling red drapes that could easily hide an assailant. But there were Aurors who were there to provide security. Harry was there to provide good company and loosen the purse-strings of wealthy benefactors.
“It’s Cornish,” Hermione explained. “It means peaceful hotel.”
Harry didn’t want to talk about flowers. He was very curious about his former schoolmate who had vanished for years only to pop up as a hotel owner on the very tip of England. He’d grown into a man who bickered with schoolgirls about the size of pastries while baking the Muggle way with the Cornish version of Mrs Weasley. It wasn’t at all what Harry would have expected and it made him all the more curious.
Harry’s assumption was proved correct when his foot slipped from where it had been perched on a rung of the stool and thumped to the floor. Draco startled like a cat, glaring at Harry from over his pan.
Potter looked sheepish as he asked the elf to bring his own school supplies. Did Potter think he would be excused from two weeks of work? Draco felt his mood sour. Of course Potter thought that. And he was probably right. Not Draco. Draco would have to have an elf deliver his essays so he wouldn't lose points for tardiness. Plague or not.
“And how would we get there?”
A hand behind his head pulled him down into a hard press of lips and then Potter's tongue was in his mouth, sliding against his tongue. Draco's hips pressed down in response and Potter groaned.
"Oh?"
“You like that, don’t you?” Malfoy looked smug, but Harry was willing to admit he did.
It was best to get the whole thing over with, so Draco walked over to stand at Potter's right side and extended his left leg in offering. Potter pressed his own leg against Draco's and began winding the rope around them.
Patil looked alarmed as she was handed a case of potions and told she’d be locked away with Abbott for two weeks. “But I’m not a Healer!”
Next to Pavel, there was an Asian witch with short, spiky hair and a wide smile.  Charlie pointed to her and said her name.
“Merryn!”
Remembering his illness explained the time of day and the feeling of his body, but he was struggling to wrap his mind around the third oddity. Cracking one eye open, he saw Potter stretched out beside him, sound asleep.
dragon!”

Kauko has found his mehiläinen, his bee. She takes Kauko’s hand and places it over the mehiläinen’s. Harri, she is told. She tells them that Kauko has found the mehiläinen that helped his mother save him and that he will help Kauko save again.
He found the red-draped table he had been assigned and looked for his own name on the ornately inscribed cards set behind each golden plate. He was sat between one of the more tolerable Ministry bureaucrats and a woman who spoke almost exclusively about her cats, but he ignored almost everything either said. He listened just enough to know when to nod or make a sound of disapproval and gave the rest of his mind over to watching Malfoy at the next table.
after the War, Harry still found it hard to hear any sort of compliment about his abilities, even from his friends.
“That’s right.” She smiled at him as she pulled back. “Except about macaroons.” The two laughed and Harry watched them enjoy the private joke. It was good to think Draco had made a history for himself that had nothing to do with Voldemort,
“She has the right.”
Someone called Draco’s name, and when he turned he saw his mother in her room at the Manor. She was taking off her pearls and laying them into her jewelry box. She turned to him with a gentle smile that froze before she began screaming.
"Fine, Vane. What do you want?"
A troubling thought occurred to him, and he frowned.  “Do I have to buy the Weasleys presents?”
bedroom. Draco didn't open any drawers, but he did notice a framed photograph in a place of honour on the dresser.
Potter was still staring at him, which made it very hard to keep his mind clear and his hope in check.
“You're such a dear, but how many times must I tell you to call me Calinda?” she cooed after him.
Oh for the love of—he
'So what's your plan for tonight?' Harry asked with all the innocence he could fake once Draco had finished the article.
She shrugged lightly. "Maybe he is but, like you, is too fixated on a particular person to notice when anyone else is flirting."
“I'm sure that you will find him indispensable.  He's just so helpful!”
A wizard from the Improper Use of Magic Office approached Draco and was granted a dance. The music was lively, but the man kept leaning forward and trying to hold Draco closer. Harry saw the irritation on Draco's face, but knew anyone else would miss the subtle tightening of Draco's features.
Teddy and Scorpius scurried around the back yard trying to catch snowflakes on their tongues. Harry had to keep the storm cloud low so that the people in the village wouldn’t see it and wonder why only his cottage was getting a white Christmas, but it was worth the risk to see the two boys laughing and squealing in delight.
Draco grinned in a way that made Harry nervous and made him wonder if he’d just promised his soul to a dragon. “You can owe me one,” Draco replied smugly. “Come here.” Before Harry could object, Draco took hold of Harry’s arm and Apparated them away.
“Why wouldn’t they be?!” Harry was rather hoping to find a suspect to question. Just
“I see.” Draco looked much smaller suddenly. “Yes, I imagine my family was in the news a fair bit at that time.”
Something hit him in the face, and it took him a moment to pull his thoughts back to the Auror Department and the memo now sitting on his desk. Ron laughed at him and snatched up the paper.
A clanking sound came from their side as Draco abandoned his glass on the table, and then there were two hands grasping his hips and holding him tightly against Draco's groin. The little kisses Harry had initiated turned deeper as Draco pressed forward with his tongue. Harry opened to him, letting him explore and claim his mouth. He'd already promised Draco he could have all of him, and it was a promise he was happy to keep.
Potter stood up and immediately fell back onto his stool.
Draco, pulled from his shock by Harry’s voice, dropped his eyes to the floor.  “I’m sorry.  I heard a shout,” Draco said to the floor.  “I thought you were . . .”  He turned away from Harry and looked on the verge of bolting.
virgin, he was
"If Weasley would be a good choice, why not put that idea in Robards' head. Even if he disagrees with your candidate, he will likely get the hint that you don't want the position for yourself."
Of course, Macmillan had been dating Finch-Flectchey by the time eighth-year began, but that didn't stop everyone from assuming he'd shagged Potter at
Draco looked up and let Potter slip out of his mouth. "Really?"
"Hungry?"
They never found out because, at that moment, a large owl pecked at the glass of the sitting room window. Draco and Hermione all but flew to open the latch.
Harry tried to keep his voice casual as he agreed and gave his Floo address. By the time he offered to make dinner, he accepted that he had completely failed at playing it cool.
“Anything exciting?”
“I'll take that as a yes.”  He stroked Potter's wild black hair back from his brow so that his bright green eyes would catch some of the pub's dim light.
Draco began to relay the history of the estate that had been in his mother's family for over a hundred years before it had been given to her by a distant aunt.  Bragging about family assets was familiar and he felt his body relax.  It was only as they reached his bedroom that he remembered Potter was not there for a tour.
But Harry working with Draco would be impossible. He no longer held any animosity toward Draco, but that had created a greater problem. Apparently the animosity was the only thing keeping Harry from noticing just how attractive Draco was. There was just something so compelling about that smug mouth and the way he lifted his eyebrows in silent question. And the less said about those long slender fingers, the better. Thank God he was wearing that figure-hiding robe. Harry wouldn’t function otherwise.
“You might want to try calling him Draco.” The glint of challenge in Charlie’s eye was all it took.
They were so close. They were often close to each other, but this was different. Harry could feel the heat of Draco's breath, coming faster than necessary, against his face. He could almost taste him. He wanted to taste him, but he couldn't push without knowing for certain.
It was less quiet than the first few days, but it was peaceful.
Harry laughed, a rich hearty sound that made Draco's stomach squirm. "What? You that upset you'll miss watching Zabini and Parkinson snog?" He gestured with his head back to Draco's table and his groping friends.
He sat up, knowing his face was probably as flushed as Draco's and his hair was even more rumpled. There was a stain on the thigh of Draco's trousers that was almost certainly Harry's release, and Harry felt his cheeks grow hotter at the sight of it.
“You don’t even know Leah Bronstein, do you?” Draco knew the bride had only just moved here from the States. Potter was rescuing strangers again.
about, was the pile of ginger fur currently sitting on Harry’s kitchen counter.
Draco's tongue slid into his mouth and Harry met it with his own. The taste of champagne was gone, but there was a sweetness to Draco's tongue that made Harry want to suck on it forever. Draco hands slid between them and fumbled with the buttons on Harry's shirt. Mirroring him, Harry tried to open Draco's buttons. Their kissing grew fiercer as they competed to open the other's shirt, and Draco moaned triumphantly as he pulled Harry's shirt open and pushed it off his shoulders.
Harry figured pointing out the Fidelius Charm would probably not change Draco’s mind. It was rather chilly and the air was heavy with the promise of more rain.
Once a week, when Draco is allowed access to parchment and a quill, he writes to her. He never mentions the maddening tedium, only thanks her for her letters and asks after her friends and the Manor. He doesn't ask after his own friends. He doesn't want to know. The last time he had seen Goyle, there had been very little sign of sanity left.  Pansy had written one letter to say she would be leaving the country. No one else had written him.
Malfoy’s smile was as captivating as it was terrifying. “It hides from feel as well. If you want to find out if I’m hard, you have to unzip me and see.”
A flick of his wand and some whispered words had his stag racing off to find Ron. Harry stayed pressed against the tree, listening for any sound that they were being pursued and wishing he could check Draco for injuries.
“But…” It was like he was trying to think of a reason to say no. Harry hoped he didn’t find one. “I’m using you to improve the hotel’s reputation!”
The question seemed odd to Harry.  “I could Side-Along us.”  He said it more like a question than the statement it was meant to be.
With fumbling hands and a few mumbles of

Draco had always been a bit …
Harry was going to say they could all go to hell, but Draco pressed on.

Aida had grown up in the south of France near her father’s family and then moved to Paris to study cooking, so most of her culinary influences were French. But most of her mother’s family lived in Senegal, and Aida’s annual visits always inspired her to try new dishes. Mother made it quite clear which cuisine she preferred.
"Back off, Malfoy," came a woman's voice. Abbott was back and, despite her words, she was smiling. "He's quite satisfied without your cock, thank you."
In the end he sent a note back saying to wear Muggle attire.  He wanted to make this work, and that meant being honest about what he wanted.  And what he wanted was to share his favourite restaurant with Draco.  It was just a tavern in a small village near the Welsh border, but the food was incredible and he'd come to know Rosie, who ran the place.  He usually went there alone to enjoy the anonymity, but he had taken each of his closest friends there in the two years since he'd found the place on an Auror mission.
Draco didn't dare to speak or breathe as they changed their positions. Potter returned to his hands and knees, and Draco knelt behind him. He ran one hand over Potter's back as he used the other to line himself up.
'Did you buy him roses, too?'
Draco made a choked sound which might have been a laugh or a sob, and then he buried his face in her hair as he hugged her.
Draco looked deliciously smug. "Even better. You know those big Muggle structures that run long lines of thick wire?"
“Someone who could save the hotel if word gets out he likes it.” He let them stew just a moment more before telling them about Potter’s telephone call.
“Fuck it's cold!”  Another swish closed the window, but did little to settle Draco's goose pimples.  “Alright bird; you'd better have good news.”  What the bird had was a simple—and did the man do another type?—note from Potter explaining that he had a very busy day in Weasel-ville with the people he actually cared about, but could spare some time to shag Draco that evening.  There wasn't even a mention of dinner.
Harry’s own concerns centred around how his friends would react to him dating someone who had tormented them so much at school. Ron and Hermione seemed accepting, but Harry still found himself nervous as their anniversary trip to Hotel Kalmynsi approached. He was spending more and more time at the hotel with Draco, sleeping there as often as at home, so Ron and Hermione planned to have him and Draco join them for meals during their holiday.
Harry’s revelation might have made things awkward between Draco and him, but they no longer had time alone together.  The summer season meant that there was a constant presence of researchers and tourists who needed to be escorted around the reserve, and Charlie’s team was in charge of visitor safety.  Since flying tended to provoke the unwanted interest of the dragons, all exploration had to be done by foot and the team spent days at a time trekking into the heart of the reserve, sleeping in communal tents or underneath the stars.  At least Harry was finally being included with the team, having been deemed no greater risk than the tourists who often ignored Charlie’s warnings about loud noises and sudden movements.
"So drinking at parties still leads to snogging blokes, huh?" Even as he said it, Draco had to remind himself that there had been no one—according to Pansy—since Macmillan. It eased the sudden flare of jealousy that cramped his stomach.
"No! Draco, no." Virgin then. "You can't tell anyone. Neville would be furious." She had gone incredibly pale and her voice trembled as she said her boyfriend's name. Fuck, she really was gone on him.
They'd called a Healer to the Burrow who assured them there was no long term damage from the lack of air, but only because of the timing. She said another few minutes and it would have been a different prognosis. Ginny relayed that bit of the story, and her eyes were wet and fierce as she spoke. Somehow, Draco had found himself inside the protective circle of Gryffindor loyalty.
Draco had a plan to save Potter from his own virginal captivity, and it did not involve shagging in a vegetable garden. He pressed one last kiss to Potter's lips and then pulled away.
"Malfoy?"
It was probably the lack of etiquette offending his sensibilities.  If he had ever chosen to court someone, be it for marriage or sex, he would have shown far more tact and class than Potter had thus far managed.  Yes, it was simply an aesthetic reaction to a classless letter.
Ron shook his head. “No. Hermione neither, and she was all over the place checking up on how the animals were treated and whether there were house-elves. There are, by the way, but she said they had clothes.” He rolled his eyes at his wife’s continued obsession with house-elf rights. Then he fidgeted with the edge of Harry’s report. “I know Malfoy,
He could have admitted to his own lack of experience, but he wanted Potter to feel he was in good hands. "Don't worry. I'll take care of you." To prove his claim, he gently removed Potter’s glasses, folded the arms, and set them on the nightstand.
in his head. "And for what it's worth, I think you're doing a great job redeeming your name. Bill says you're a really good Curse-Breaker, you know. And I know you're the only reason Vane is doing so well with her case load. She joined us because she loves Aurors, not Auror work, and yet she hands in the most thorough Curse reports of any trainee. We all know it's because she always consults with you."
With no information from Harry’s brain or the hotel he would need a reservation at, Harry assured a complete stranger that he would be staying at Hotel Kalmynsi Easter weekend and would be happy to attend her wedding.
Harry stepped forward and risked putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco leant toward him just slightly, but enough to embolden him. He put his other hand on Draco’s cheek. The grey eyes which met his were wary but interested, so Harry leant forward until their lips brushed together lightly.
Draco let Harry kiss him once more before he wiggled free and opened the door. "Good. I’ll pick you up then. For now, I have to go to the Manor and extract my son without waking him—all while dodging my mother’s prying questions." He looked exasperated for a moment before an evil gleam came into his eyes. "Maybe,” he smirked at Harry. “Maybe I will tell her the Saviour just shagged me over the couch and then kicked me to the kerb without dinner."
Harry wondered if he should be offended, as he had been with Toby the night before. But Malfoy insulting his clothing was
'Cold!' Harry protested. Draco huffed, but then there was so much heat around his cock that all thought left Harry's mind. He was in Draco's mouth and Draco's tongue was caressing him as his cheeks sucked and squeezed. Harry balled his hands into fists to resist the urge to grab at Draco's hair. When Draco started bopping his head and running his tight lips up and down his shaft, Harry was grateful he'd kept his hands to himself. The slice of his nails into his palms was well worth letting Draco feel things out on his own.
And they didn’t look at
"Now, now," Malfoy went on, "Don't get all explosive. I want Granger's legislation to pass, no matter how terrible she is with names and acronyms. I just want it to happen without the establishment getting up in arms and starting the usual hoopla about Muggle-borns destroying our ways. That kind of rhetoric didn't work out so well last time." His lips formed a wry smile, but there was a tightness around his eyes that reminded Harry that Malfoy had suffered as much as anyone in the war.
Harry shook his head.  “You don’t know Luna,” he said softly.
Harry couldn't resist admiring Draco's arse as he sauntered out of the loo: it really was the finest in London.  In contrast to Draco's long, lean figure, his arse was lush and beautifully rounded.  Harry wonder how it would look without the trousers and robes that always obscured his view.
Longbottom flushed at her words and smiled into his pint.
Potter sat up and coughed more forcefully into his fist as the purple spread into the same mask look Abbott had before collapsing. Draco’s first impulse was to contact Pomfrey, but then he remembered that no help would be sent. Potter was very pale except for the purple markings and his coughing grew thicker and raspier.
Harry could kiss him! Avoiding electricity would dramatically limit where the plant could be grown. Okay, maybe he would want to kiss Draco even if the man had brought him terrible news. But he hadn’t.
They were back to staring at each other. Harry was growing to hate the noisy clock and all its ticking.
Quidditch team.
“Well the next group should be easier,” Charlie said.  “Researchers from the European Magical Creatures Institute.  You should know one of them,” he looked to Harry, “Luna Lovegood, remember her?”
Malfoy stared into his eyes as if checking the truth of his words.  Harry supposed he couldn't blame him for wanting to distance himself from his father's actions and their shared family name.  Draco then.  If he chanted it in his head a few more times it might even stick.
He faced Draco again with an attempt at haughtiness of his own. “Well if I’m with you, you won’t have to wonder what I’m getting up to.” He was delighted to see Draco’s cheeks pinken. He didn’t deny it!
Was this a date? Was this just two co-workers getting a meal after a hard day? Draco seemed aware of Harry’s interest, but he—
Potter's eyes sharpened at that. Perhaps there was hope for him after all.
Harry could feel his face fall. He'd tried so hard. He thought he'd done everything to make the party perfect. 'What did I miss? I spoke to the caterers and Hermione and Padma! I even sent the menu to your mother to approve!'
Harry thought back on his training once more. His instructor encouraged reference to a greater authority, and Harry was eager to turn attention away from himself. “The Wizengamot reviewed each member of the Malfoy family and met out the consequences they saw fit after reviewing all the evidence.”
Potter scrunched his face in thought. "It's kind of like a plate you throw and catch, but it's made of plastic."
Harry glanced at Draco, but George waived him off with assurances that Draco would be fine. Harry finally nodded, slowly gathering his things and saying goodbye to Draco with such intensity that Draco felt its touch on his skin.
"Infiltration. Which reminds me, I need you and Longbottom to host something together and make sure Potter attends. A house party would be best so that I can get Potter alone some place quiet.
Weasley rolled his eyes and walked off without a departing word.  Draco had thought he might intervene or attempt to “protect” Potter from the evil Death Eater, but instead he seemed unsurprised by a turn in conversation that sounded suspiciously like Potter asking Draco on a date.  Was that what just happened?
, but a larger part of him was worried that even thinking it would cause the illusion to shatter.

Draco’s hand flew exactly to the tuft of hair sticking up on one side. How did he always know when it was messed up and where? Maybe that was a normal talent that Harry lacked because his hair was
It must be a mistake. The only one ever home at eleven was Draco, and he most certainly had not arranged a fitting. A shame, really. He hadn't had a chance to buy new robes, and his old ones were getting slightly too short at the wrists and ankles. He missed the feeling of trying on a new robe when the fabric was at its finest and the hues were at their riches. But the fact remained that no one had scheduled anything with this peddler.
He realised he'd moved his face closer to Draco's when he saw Draco's eyes widened further. It was almost comical, except that Harry could see how wide his pupils were. How dark. A shiver ran down his back.
rather nice to look at these days, and Harry did look. Quite often. And now he knew a way to look his fill. He smiled at the shop.
Draco went straight to bed that first night. He even skipped his usual evening ablutions so he could stay locked away in the privacy of the attic. The room was hideously decorate with the garish orange of the British league's
* * *
Harry gaped at him and then scowled.  “It was your idea!”
A man’s voice on the other end was rich and familiar. Draco was so distracted by it that he missed most of what was said. Not that he needed to hear more than the word “reservation.” Draco was honestly just grateful for the dignity of cancelling instead of just not showing up like the family who never arrived on Friday.
, but—
Harry didn’t know whether to be proud or heartbroken that Teddy knew to offer his own loss to comfort other people. He was such a kind child. Perhaps he’d Sort Hufflepuff like his mother.
"She is one odd duck, isn't she?" Draco said.
“Piss off,” he replied reflexively without even a glance.  This was a typical part of Draco going out.
“Oh, he did. He actually swears by it.” Harry allowed himself a private smile as he prepared to relay the story. “The other day, he was helping his niece build a model dragon, but the pieces wouldn’t go together right. He was getting really frustrated, and I could tell Hermione was worried he was going to start swearing in front of delicate ears. Anyway, he’s just adding the tail when his hand slips and he knocks the legs off, and he shouts ‘Draco’s chocolate cake!’”
Well if they're both going to have someone . . .   Harry stopped mid-stride.  “I need to send an owl.  I'll meet you there.”
Draco let his eyes drift off to the side of the building where the rose garden was visible through a wrought iron gate. He remembered the first time he and Harry had walked through the garden when Harry had asked for a tour of the grounds. More recently, he remembered having tea at a small garden table as the smell of velvety petals accented the rosewater in the scones Draco had baked.
Teddy frowned. "Well, whose tummy did you grow in?"
Draco understood. Death’s Mask was rarely lethal, but the few deaths were almost always the elderly. Pomfrey was no spring chicken. “Patil,” he whispered, distracting her so that Pomfrey could check on Abbott one last time, “Pomfrey is at greater risk than any of us.”
'We doing good?' Harry whispered, again needing to hear Draco's own words to believe this was real.
Going out on the pull had clearly been a horrible idea. He glared over at the friend responsible for the idea in the first place. Toby was strolling beside him on the dark London road clearly lost in his own thoughts and oblivious to Harry’s misery.
“You want me to escort you to the wedding?” It wasn’t a no. It sounded like Draco just needed clarification.
“It’s Cassis and champagne.”
Malfoy Manor sat empty as his father finished his sentence in Azkaban and his mother lived in the flat in Vienna.  She had connected with the Malfoys living there and showed little interest in returning to England.  Draco doubted if any of them would ever choose to live in the former residence of the Dark Lord and his many atrocities.
Harry knew he should have kept his mouth shut. His mouth was always getting him in trouble, flapping away with no input from his brain. But before his brain was any the wiser, he leaned around his protective plant and asked, “Are you discussing Draco Malfoy’s hotel?”
There was a surprising warmth in Draco's eyes.  "Yes."  His eyes sharpened and his lips quirked up.  "Unless you stay over and make it unnecessary."
"Yes, but you
“Why were you avoiding me?”  Harry was lying on his back on Draco’s bed, sated on every level.  He ran his fingers through Draco’s long, silky hair just because he could.  “When we were first . . . you know.  You wouldn’t talk to me.”
Potter just chuckled and shoved the spoon back into Draco’s mouth.
—had been out drinking and dancing? Was she home minding their child like a dutiful wife, never questioning her husband's intentions?
Potter gave him a smile. “For a moment I worried you’d called her here. You know, for the publicity of me being here.”
He had to step completely away from Draco to regain enough concentration to open his door. It was a wonder his wand even stayed in his trembling fingers.
"A formidable foe, apparently, given that he can't defeat it on his own."
“Uh…” The caller sounded confused. Or was he recognising Draco’s voice. Hopefully not! “I, um, I haven’t made one yet. That’s why I’m calling.”
A quick glance around showed Ministry officials and members of the Wizengamot drinking ale and chatting with an ease rarely seen inside the Ministry. Perhaps it was time for Draco to form some new alliances.
Draco stood on Harry’s doorstep looking absolutely edible. He wore dark trousers and a collared shirt with a snug grey waistcoat accentuating his narrow waist and hips. The look was crisp and polished, but the open top button or two on his shirt showed his pale throat and a glimpse of collarbone. Harry pulled his eyes back up to Draco’s smug smile. Apparently Draco could tell exactly how affected Harry was by that bit of exposed skin.
“You're . . .” came Draco's raspy voice, although his face did not change from his expression of shock, “falling for me?  What do you mean, falling for me?”
Weasley's arm brushed Draco's as he shrugged. "School," he said casually. "Buy you a drink, Malfoy?"
“You’re right.  I don’t,” Draco whispered.
“Well, we’ll get several weeks off.  Zhi always stays, which means Dave does, the fool. . .”  Draco seemed to realise he was rambling and fell silent.
! Draco did Potions! He had gone to the Greek Institute of Potions and Herbol… oh shit.
But his pride had to be sacrificed to his limited time. Hermione was due back in three days, and Draco needed to know where things stood before then. So it was that he send an owl to Harry arranging dinner for the next night.
Potter let Draco have the first shower even though he must have felt disgusting, coated in sweat and germs. While Potter had his shower, Kreacher appeared and changed both of their bedding.
expert.”
clean. His only pleasure is knowing that his mother isn't there with him, and yet that is the only pleasure Draco needs.
"Can you bake?"
“That’s okay, right?  We have the evening off anyway.”  A thought occurred to him and he panicked.  “There’s no rule against us dating is there?  You’re not going to make me leave, are you?!”  Not only did he love his new life at the reserve, he couldn’t imagine leaving Draco now that he was finally winning him over.
Harry remembered Ron's comments about roses and diamonds and wanted to smack his head against the wall. Everyone had seen it but him. He felt a flash of shame, but much stronger was the driving urge to get it all right
'Beautiful.' Draco kissed him just above his heart, and the intimacy of the gesture made Harry's cheeks flush. Draco continued kissing a path down his chest, and each soft, wet kiss making his hair stand up on end. Soon Draco was on his knees with his face pressed against Harry's clothed cock. The devilish grin he flashed was enough to ensure Harry was completely hard by the time Draco had his trousers and pants around his ankles.
Your own work, Draco thought bitterly, but kept a smile on his face.
He turned and saw Malfoy up close for the first time that evening. The years abroad had been kind to him. He was still pale, despite moving to France, but his skin looked warmer and softer. There was a glow to his cheeks and a twinkle to his eyes that had not been present when they had last met in the months after the war.
“Something like that.”
Draco raised his eyebrow in a more successful attempt. 'Are you denying that you planned to order the roast beef sandwich that you
He had no idea how much worse things would get. The year his father wasn't home because he was in Azkaban. The year he stayed at Hogwarts to try to fix the cabinet in a desperate attempt to save his parents' lives. The year the Carrows were at Hogwarts, but he had still wanted to stay there because it was far less terrifying than what was waiting for him back at the Manor.
“Is this how you treat all your customers?”
“The Silver Lining. The only place a wizard should ever buy Muggle clothing.”  He gestured toward the dark shop with the excitement of a father whose child had just made a Hogwarts Quidditch team. “The places in Diagon sell some Muggle stuff, but it’s always horribly out of date. And you can obviously go to a regular Muggle place, but then you have to do all the tailoring charms yourself, and I can never get the wizarding space right for a wand pocket.
"Wouldn't it be a bit … crowded?" He'd heard the Weasleys lived in a tiny hovel. "And why would they even take me in?"
* * *
Harry vowed that he would make Draco his by the end of the night.  The question was, how?  It was Sunday, so he would be expected at the Burrow for a late lunch and Quidditch as usual.  He could cancel, but he always hated to do so with so little warning.  Mrs. Weasley surely had the roast half done at this point.  Besides, his evening was still free.
“I’ll go.  To Christmas.”  Draco looked up from his book with an arched brow.  “That is, if you want me to.”  Harry tried to remember whether Draco had expressed any preference over breakfast.  “Do you?”
Potter did a little snort-laugh, and it was actually rather cute.  Not at all like Pansy's.  “No, no.  We were following a suspect.  The information you gave us about Euphora and Scotland, it was pure gold.  We had a suspect right away, and then he led us to the lab and his associates.”
“The vegetable garden and pastures are on the other side. It’s a shame you can’t see them.”
Draco shrugged and gave him a coy smile. "Fancy going with me?"
* * *
think I should be wearing.”
"Her talents lie elsewhere." As much as Blaise was quick to speak for his girlfriend, even he seemed incapable of saying anything positive for her cooking.
The evening continued well. Conversation came easily, only interrupted as Draco explained each course and Potter made noises of pleasure that made Draco feel equal parts pleased and awkward. But it was all going smoothly, which is why Draco should have known something was about to go wrong.
"So you’re not married?" The timing might not be great, but Harry had to know. He was so confused, and there was a dangerous hope bubbling up in his chest. The hope brought with it the possibility that he would soon be very angry with himself for jumping to conclusions without the full story.
'No! I'm comfortable.' He sounded sulky and tired. 'Go make us tea.'
But Harry was never very good at hiding his feelings, and one evening, as Draco and he were setting up camp, he couldn’t bite his tongue any longer.
“Of course the cloak had it’s own problems. It covered my hair but not my face, and with my complexion some of the older boys called me ptóma.” He curled his lip up as he said the word. “It means corpse, Potter. Corpse.”
something. Go find something to do."
Malfoy murmured something under his breath as he handed the jeans over.
“You saw Hermione.”
.  Luna's house.
As usual, Robards’ briefing was short and simple: Bloodrot Poison, which was illegal to produce or possess, had been used in three murders in the past six months. Four more vials had been found on suspects arrested for other crimes or at crime scenes. The style of vial was consistent, implying one organisation distributing the potion.
Potter fidgeted beside him, digging into the pockets of his robes. He pulled out a length of red and white rope and held it for Draco to see. "Shall we get started?" His tone was carefully neutral, and Draco found it tedious. Even by attempting to be civil, Potter managed to annoy him.
Harry made a mental note throw out every pair of shorts he owned. He had Cooling Charms, right?
Footsteps approached and he was rolled onto his back with the toe of a shoe. A very scuffed, chocolate brown Oxford.
Easily done. Luckily Pansy fell quiet and Draco was able to finish the section on rimming.
Draco shrugged. “I did in Greece, but I am not sure how many customs are the same.” He smiled with half his mouth. “It felt safer there because when I made mistakes they wrote me off as an odd foreigner. Here, I’m always worried I will break the Statute of Secrecy.”
“Are you asking if I intend to involve myself with other men whilst on holiday?”  Harry nodded, hating how articulate Draco sounded in contrast to his own ramblings.  “No, that is not my intention.  And you?  Will you fill your bed in my absence?”
Harry could see Draco’s wrinkled nose and curled lip without even turning around.  It was always the same.
Harry eyed the seating chart and tried not to feel disappointed that Malfoy was not at his table. Curiosity didn't make for good dinner conversation, and it was nothing but curiosity that had him tracking Malfoy's pale hair among the sea of Ministry bigwigs, society darlings, and people who nailed tapestries of their family tree to the wall. These big events always left Harry uncomfortable and bored, and it was for that reason alone that he had hoped to be seated with Malfoy. Of course he would want a little mystery among the tedium.
"But not ignorant." He closed
Harry gasped and dropped this knife back into the jar, heart pounding in his chest. Then he realised the voice wasn't accusatory or even Draco's. He turned to the fireplace and saw a freckled face sitting in the flames. 'Hi, Ron! You coming through?'
Harry blushed and looked down at the scratched wooden table. 'No. But you make it seem like a bad thing.' It wasn't his fault that the beef was perfectly tender and the horseradish mustard had exactly the right amount of kick to it. He looked up into Draco's bright grey eyes that were shining with warm amusement. 'When I find something good, I don't see any reason to give it up.'
So when Malfoy suggested stepping out for fresh air, Harry agreed. They pressed though groups of other people laughing and bragging in their finest robes until they reached a set of French doors that opened to the gardens. Harry didn’t know if they were really outside or not, having Flooed to the party. He didn’t even know where in the country he was. He paused to marvel at the ways of the wizarding world, and Malfoy stopped to look back at him. There was a hint of question and, perhaps, nervousness in Malfoy’s features. Harry tried for a smile that was reassuring, but feared it might have just looked goofy. It didn’t matter because Malfoy smiled back and squeezed his hand lightly. Then he led Harry into the cool spring air.
Draco left so quickly he didn't notice Harry rooted to the spot behind the door. Neither did Pansy when Harry heard her heels clop by a moment later.
Draco scowled at the hand in his face for only a moment before he gave in to his instinct for self-preservation. "Truce." He wrapped his hand around Potter's and was surprised how warm it was.
He wasn’t sure he had ever run so fast.
* * *
"Look, I'm sorry."
“I think I’ll call it a night,” Dave said with a yawn.  “Summer rush may be over, but there’s still work to do.”  He stood and stretched his powerful frame.
Draco scowled at him.  “Don’t make me reconsider, Potter.”
But it was Draco, and Harry wanted all of him.
He stepped onto the stoop himself and shut the door firmly behind himself. “I’d rather not have my decor subjected to the same…
“We’re not busy now.”
At the first bend in the road, he stopped and felt a deep rush of affection for the hedgerows that afforded him a sense of privacy despite standing on a
Harry felt ridiculous standing in front of Malfoy in his boxers and socks. It wasn’t that he was usually prudish—if Hogwarts hadn’t acclimated him to dressing in front of others, the Aurors certainly would have—but it was the abrupt and unexpected nature of the situation that had his cheeks heating. That, and his fellow Gryffindors and Aurors didn’t look like Malfoy.
“Fruit.” He knew that the elf would bring eggs, sausage, and toast as he did every day, but Draco missed fruit. When breakfast arrived, there was a large plate of berries, apples, and sliced pears.
Harry laughed. Yesterday his clothing had made him feel ugly and alone, and today these clothes had gotten him much more than Malfoy’s attention. “Yes. Very much. I can’t wait to see what else you have.”
Draco smirked as he took Harry’s hand in his and pulled him away from the wall. “You can afford it.”
And this was where every discussion of Ron and Hermione’s holidays ended up. They would tell Harry how much fun they had and how much he would love it. Last time, it was the tropical island with amazingly soft sand and rare animals. The time before that, it was the charming old city with a library so impressive even Ron hadn’t wanted to leave. This time, Ron was rabbiting on about a chocolate cake that could lure Harry’s heart from treacle tart forever. His friends would do their best to sell him on a destination, and he would do his best to convince them he would consider it. But they all knew Harry didn’t holiday.
* * *
“Um . . . well.  We could go into Sibiu.  I mean, they’ve got to have a nice restaurant in the wizarding section somewhere.  I’d be willing to try a Muggle place, but I suspect you’d prefer wizarding.”
Malfoy had slid down the wall and was now sitting with his long legs—still tethered together by his pants and trousers—stretched out in front of him. His limp cock rested on his lap. He looked up at Harry with a lazy grin. “I take it you like the jeans, too?”
“Me? A Malfoy? Subservient to goblins? You must be daft, Potter.”
"Well Harry doesn't shag at all," Pansy snapped as she plopped back onto the sofa.
Until Draco fell ill.
'Draco, it's ridiculous. This
Potter's eyes widened briefly before he frowned. Draco wondered if that was Potter's thinking face.
"God! That smells amazing."
Draco moved in so close that Harry was afraid to breathe lest his chest expand and they touch.  "Then I will have to owl in the morning."  Harry didn't get a chance to think about the words because Draco pressed forward and they were touching from their lips down to their thighs.
When Harry returned, Draco was still against the wall, but his company had changed yet again. Standing far too close,
'That's okay. You can just buy him diamonds.'
? There is hope for you, yet.” He gestured for Harry to stand and then began slowly circling him like a wolf choosing the angle of his killing blow. Rather than attacking, he stopped short with a huff. “I can’t even
They do not understand. Kauko is from far away, and he is still learning their language and their ways. Kauko will see Mehiläinen when he is ready.
In contrast, Harry looked like a drowning boy lost to the sea of fabric that was Dudley’s old t-shirt. The image on the front was so faded and flaked that he no longer remembered what it had once depicted. Harry knew that his jeans—
Potter coughed out a laugh. "Not really. But I do have ears. A lot of guys spent eighth year discussing who had the largest breasts."
“Well part of that might help,” Harry ventured cautiously.  He ignored Draco’s glare and pushed ahead.  “You could just say you’re sorry.  I mean, you are, aren’t you?”
'But—'
“At least he’s bloody
Back out on the streets of Muggle London—with a Notice-Me-Not so their cloaks didn’t attract attention—Harry no longer had his injuries to blame for his light-headedness or the tightness in his chest. “So …”
Ron wrinkled his nose. 'It's still seriously weird that you guys share a bed.'
A small noise sent adrenaline surging through his body. A tiny crack. A broken stick? A distant or muffled Apparition? A wild animal wandering or a wizard returning to guard his crops?
Draco popped into existence on the walkway to the Château. The morning air was crisp and clear, although he still found it hard to breathe. The weight on his chest still bore down on him no matter how many times he scolded himself. What was had he been thinking? Did he really expect Harry Potter to wait in his bed for them to share breakfast and a cuddle? Potter might have been friendly and flirtatious while trying to get into Draco’s bed, but there was no reason for him to bother the morning after.
“What on earth are you on about?  We’re talking right now.”
"I'm not blind."
"I'm not mean, I'm just rarely nice."
Harry blinked and tried to gather his wayward thoughts back to the case. Potions. Ingredients. Right. “So I need to figure out where these ingredients are being grown and who is doing it.”
Harry leaned over to whisper in his ear.  “If you win this for us, I’ll give you a blow job in the shower back in our room.”  They were staying at a hotel, rather than crowd into the Burrow or face Malfoy Manor.  The wizarding hotel was lovely and decadent and had an enormous shower in addition to a huge bathtub.  It was amazing that they’d left the room at all.  “But if I get more questions right . . .”
—Vane's file when he felt Potter's presence behind him. Draco could smell that hint of grass and warm dirt, and he could almost taste Potter's restless magic.
It would have taken weeks to make all of the arrangements by owl, but with Harry’s Muggle way he had everything sorted by lunchtime.  He found Draco in the sitting room and couldn’t contain himself enough to even sit down before speaking.
Draco could hear his mother chastising that only boring minds got bored, but he kept that thought to himself as well. He could feel Potter glaring at him anyway.
Harry's mind filled with horrible images of ways Draco could entertain himself unaccompanied in a foreign city.  Hadn't Draco once mentioned some Viennese wizard his mother had tried to set him up with?  He felt his body heat with anger at the thought of Draco with another man.
"The Witch's Brew does a decent meal," Draco said casually, just in case he'd imagined Potter's invitation. The poky little pub was on the outskirts of London and far from the crowds of Diagon Alley.  It was a favourite of those witches and wizards who valued privacy over proper lighting.
Draco nodded slowly. "Okay. This wasn’t quite the setting I’d imagined …" He turned back to his son and gently stroked the fine hair back from the boy's forehead. "You grew in Aunt Astoria’s tummy." He said gently. "She knew I wanted you more than anything but couldn’t make a baby by myself." His voice was so earnest and he looked terrified as he waited for Scorpius’ reply. Harry could feel his own heart clenching as he watched.
When Potter came out of the shower, he would know. Draco had used charms to hide the sound of his coughing all night, but Potter would notice even silent coughing now that he was awake. Draco crawled back into bed and let his aching joints relax against the soft mattress. He wasn’t sure why he was hiding his illness from Potter, but he knew it would be a very long day.
Draco placed one hand on Harry’s hip and ran the other through his hair. “Don’t talk about Weasley right now,” he murmured before pulling Harry into a much more heated kiss.
Pansy looked just like her mother as she poured tea for Draco and herself. He was sure she would hate the comparison, but there was something about the way she tilted her chin as she delicately lifted the handle of the teapot that reminded him of sitting in front of Mrs. Parkinson's tea settings as a small boy in shorts.
It was a small mercy that Robards chose that moment to resume speaking, bringing all eyes back to him.
"I didn't want you to think I didn't know what I was doing. But apparently I didn't do a great job of winging it." Draco’s face felt hot as he confessed and he wanted to bury it in Potter’s pillow.
As painful as it was, Draco found himself nodding his acceptance. It hurt a little less when she wrapped her arms around him and let her wild hair tickle his cheek.
Harry turned back to the table to see Hermione glaring at him. Neville, Ginny, and Oliver looked as confused as Harry felt, so there was no use asking them for an explanation. But he really didn’t fancy asking the friend whose usually-kind brown eyes were burning into him.
"Ripweed Burgundy," he managed between gritted teeth. The pain was easing, but his anger hadn't.  He wouldn't draw his wand on Weasley, but he couldn't resist ordering the most expensive wine the Leaky carried, one he knew came only by the bottle. He didn't think Weasley would recognise the prestigious label, but the little flinch from his right assured him Weasley at least suspected the cost.
"Don't mind him," the scarred one assured Draco. "He's a harmless flirt. If you don't have wings and breathe fire, you won't hold his attention more than a minute."
He kissed Draco fiercely, pouring his outrage at any mistreatment into his lips and tongue.  He kissed his way down Draco's body and settled himself on his belly between the other man's legs.  Hovering above Draco's groin, he was reassured by the sight and smell of his arousal.  He stretched out his tongue and licked a long stripe from the dusty pink balls along a thick vein to the tip of his cock.  He teased the slit with his tongue before taking the head into his mouth.  He licked and sucked until Draco's heavy breathing gave way to moans and whimpers.
"I want the details. The damage is done, so you might as well fill me in." He knew he'd won the moment she bit her lip. She
“This is all off topic!”  Hermione said a bit shrilly.  “We were
“So you could just say that you’re glad that she’s alright.  That’s true enough, whatever the reason, and I think she’d be happy to hear that.”  Draco’s lips were pressed into a tight line, but Harry took the lack of argument as a good sign.
The silence returned and hung over him. He was surprised his legs and feet weren't tired from his walking. Could his body tire when he was dead? Surely, this body wasn't real.
“They’re going to come for us soon and I … I hope we’re different now. Friendly.”
Draco took the hint. He all but sprinted from the house and made his way through the crowd in the back garden to the quiet side yard. Crouched beside a tomato plant with a glass of wine held precariously in long fingers was Harry Potter. Alone. His free hand was fondling a tomato with the same care and concentration Draco would expect from Pansy or Longbottom.
That lovely pink returned to Potter's cheeks. "Not usually, no. I help Mrs. Weasley with her Sunday roasts, but this is the first time I've cooked one here."
When he put it like that, what choice did Harry have? He had a finger inside of Draco’s heat without even registering that he’d dug his lube out of the nightstand drawer. Nothing mattered more than being inside Draco’s body. All of him. He added two and then three fingers, wishing he could put his whole hand inside. He wanted to taste him, but his tongue would have to wait for another time. Nothing could convince him to wait another moment before sinking his cock into Draco’s arse. He pulled his fingers out and gave those perfect globes of flesh a firm squeeze.
Draco agreed and Potter ordered two mojitos.
“Oy!  Will you two stop flirting and get in here!” Ron shouted from the sitting room. Harry hadn’t even noticed him leaving the kitchen.  “We want to play team
* * *
It was several hours and many Muggle farms later when they saw the glimmer of magic around a decrepit barn. Harry had been on the verge of calling it for the day as the light was running low, but having seen the hint of a charm, he gestured for Malfoy to fly just above the ground with him. There was a hedgerow that ran along the farm, providing them with extra coverage as they approached the barn. It wasn’t until they were close that the illusion of the barn fell away and they saw a large greenhouse with two wind tunnels beside it.
And maybe Draco would admit his undying love and they would live happily ever after with two and a half children and a dog. And maybe Umbridge would become a kind person, and Azkaban would be voted Tropical Resort of the Year and start serving daiquiris.
Then Draco thrust his hips hard and Harry choked. He pulled back as his throat clenched again and again around nothing but air.
“Is that what he is now?”  Ron's brow furrowed.  “I thought you hadn't even gone out yet.”
Draco didn’t look gloating as he considered his reply. “I suppose I could. Aida is cooking, and Merryn was going to help me serve anyway. She’d like getting to do it on her own, and you are as good a guinea pig as any. She usually only serves in the sunroom, which is more casual.”
An advantage of working with his best mate was that Harry could combine a briefing with dinner. He Flooed into Ron and Hermione’s cottage to find Hermione curled up in an oversized armchair with a large tome on her lap.
Zipping and buttoning the front, Harry found it odd that there was no matching pressure against his cock. Shouldn’t he feel the jeans press against him? Especially given how tight they were. He stood staring at his own crotch in confusion.
* * *
Harry pushed down his annoyance. He wasn’t asking Draco because he was worried about showing up without a date. This wasn’t the Yule Ball and Harry certainly wasn’t fourteen anymore. In fact, if the Yule Ball had taught him anything, it was that no date was much better than the wrong one.
Oh shit. Time to confess. 'Um . . . well, I sometimes send her an owl when I get stuck on a gift or something like that.' Apparently it was the night to end all secrets. 'And sometimes when you're really busy and I know you haven't had a chance to write yourself. I know she worries,' he all but whispered. He briefly considered confessing to using the butter knife in the jam that morning, but decided that maybe it wasn't such a big deal in light of everything else.
“I can’t study with you hacking away. Do us both a favour.” Draco was sure Potter could see through his attempt at disinterest, but he silently accepted the potion and water. The potion helped Potter through the evening until he started coughing up blood.
Kreacher appeared three times a day with meals that made Potter’s face light up. Clearly the elf knew Potter’s favourites and had little interest in serving anything else. Draco and Potter would eat their meals in silence and then return to their studies: Draco at the round table where they ate and Potter stretched out on the sofa. The only noise would be a silvery Patronus from one of Potter’s friends or the hum of the wireless that Potter kept tuned to a station that played far too much Celestina Warbeck. Frankly, any Warbeck was too much.
Harry turned to see Draco standing with blank shock as his eyes traveled between Kensa and Merryn. He blinked and seemed to come back to himself. He looked at Kensa and his face softened. “You don’t need to apologise. I made my own reputation and I have to deal with the consequences of that.” He glanced at Harry before returning to Kensa. “And I can relate to becoming a bit,” he shot another glance at Harry, “
That would change tomorrow, Draco reminded himself. This weekend, Hotel Kalmynsi would feel like herself again.
"Yeah. One of our trainees asked me out—not Romilda for once—but I said I was off to practice bondage with you."
"I think we've got walking down," Potter said. "Next time we can try increasing our speed." He pulled his arm away and Draco's back felt suddenly cold in the evening air. His leg felt almost naked as Potter undid the rope.
Draco pulled away to meet Potter’s eyes. "So you're still up for this?"
Potter laughed fully. "Not even a little bit."
"Then let the others dream a little." Harry smiled at his friend. "After all, that's all they get. The dream."
Oh shit. They were going to talk about it.
Fuck, Draco was hard. So hard and so hot. Harry slid his hands into his cloak and began fumbling with the soft fabric of Draco’s jumper.
“No.  Quite the opposite, actually. It sounds like he’s finally doing something because he
"And what about you, Potter? Don't you have signings to attend and babies to kiss? Can the wizarding world spare their precious
Draco turned away from the kitchen just as a woman appeared in the doorway. Harry’s first thought was she had high cheekbones like Draco, which was an odd comparison as the two otherwise looked nothing alike. Harry had always thought of Draco as pointy and pale, while this woman’s features were rounded and her complexion dark. Her eyes were soft and warm, while Harry had always thought of Draco as having his father’s cold, unfeeling grey eyes. Although...when he thought about Draco laughing as they walked along the crag that morning, his eyes hadn’t seemed cold at all. More like the surface of the ocean, promising great depths beneath.
“Well, boyfriend sounds rather . . . I don't know, domestic.”  Harry glanced from the mugs of tea—his with a snitch and Draco's with a little cauldron and the words “morning brew”—to the half-complete crossword and then back to the bed-rumpled man wearing the grey flannel pyjama bottoms he'd stolen from Harry that morning.  What about that scene wasn't domestic.  Draco seemed to have guessed his thoughts because he turned a little pink.
Potter's surprise gave way to a beautiful smile and blush.  “Well, that's—I mean—I was happy to—I'm glad I—.”  He clamped his mouth shut and blushed deeper.  Potter was pretty adorable when he was flustered.
Two winters pass before they return.
Harry gave him a warm smile and took his hand. The snow was falling harder and they should probably head back to the castle while they could still see more than a metre in front of their faces. “I like Butterbeer,” he said as they started to move through the trees. He squeezed Malfoy’s hand and smiled at him. “And I like ice cream in the winter. The ice cream doesn’t melt everywhere and the queues at Fortescue’s are almost nonexistent.”
Draco nodded his head in acceptance and asked about the next steps in the case. Harry explained that Fernsworth would likely know everything their prisoners did by the end of the night. If there were enough information to lead to a raid, it would happen without Harry. Robards had strict rules about shifts, and Harry wasn’t on call this weekend.
Malfoy shrugged as if it were nothing. As if it weren’t the opposite of what he would have done at eleven years of age. “I check the places they used to gather. I spent a lot of seventh-year looking for places to be that the Carrows wouldn’t go, and I learned there were things more frightening than this forest.’
“Mmm . . . soft,” Potter mumbled against his lips.
Draco cringed. "Ooh. Not good."
“Well it’s good you are not pining after Weasley behind Granger’s back.”
A flash of heat ran through Harry’s body and he scolded himself to stay calm. “Now that we’ve established I’m in the right place, how about you let me in? Your sign says you’ve been open for two minutes, and I’m still stuck on the pavement.” Harry caught a glimpse of genuine amusement on Malfoy’s face before he turned to lead Harry into the shop.
Draco was readying to leave when the violet memo landed on his desk.  He opened it to reveal a hastily written note from Potter.
Each day, his mother writes to him, telling him what she had for breakfast and where she went on her morning walk. He closes his eyes and can almost taste the buttered crumpets and sweet tea. He imagines her walking among her beloved roses or along the brook at the east end of the grounds, the sun shining on her hair, and her face finally free from the worries of war. Draco had made her promise not to worry for him and Father. They would be uncomfortable, but they are finally safe. The Dementors are gone and the food is sufficient to keep them alive.
Potter's leg was surprisingly strong and sturdy, reminding Draco that Potter hadn't been a weedy pre-pubescent boy in many years. Potter's hands were definitely not a boy's hands: broad, with long, muscular fingers. Draco wished he'd worn thicker trousers as he felt the heat of Potter's leg against his own.
Toby assured him he knew the perfect place to “sort him out” and gestured across the road to where the battered old sign for the Leaky Cauldron was coming into view. Harry followed after him and was surprised when Toby walked past the Leaky and stopped at the next door.
Malfoy Mirror
Even though his ex-wife had given birth to Scorpius, Astoria had always viewed herself as more surrogate than mother. She had insisted on being called Auntie so that Scorpius wouldn’t be confused or hurt that his mother had moved away to marry a man who wasn’t his father. "I’d rather be the best aunt than the worst mother," she had told him. And like most things, she got her way.
you would be to my …
If one of his friends sent him an owl he could reply, but he doubted even Nott would think to use an owl within Hogwarts. And if Nott wouldn’t think of it, there was no chance Pansy or Goyle would. Zabini probably hadn’t even noticed his absence.
Harry stepped forward and peered into the darkened window. In the dim light from the street he could make out a table with neat stacks of clothing and a rack of shirts beside it. It didn’t look any more threatening than Madam Malkin’s, and it might improve Harry’s currently non-existent sex life. He looked at a little sign on the door to confirm the shop was open on Saturdays and then promised himself that he would return in the morning. He told Toby as much.
“Ew.”
The edge of Draco’s lip twitched.
* * *
"Days. Today is Thursday and you bit the apple on Tuesday." Harry stared at his fingers as he pulled at the grass. "We'd given up. I was just saying goodbye to you before we sent the coffin to your mother."
Humiliation burned up Draco's spine until his face was hot. He couldn't raise his head and risk Potter seeing him so affected.  He couldn't even bear to stay there.
Draco looked over the paper and then threw it to Harry as he dug change out of Harry’s coin bowl for the owl. “We’re in it.”
“Do you need to go into work?” Draco was clearly aiming for casual, but Harry was glad he had missed his mark.
Harry thought Draco might mean a gift in a box until he saw Draco's eyes rake over his body.
"What? Plan to poison him, too?" Potter was using his Defender of Justice voice.
Then the dancing started.
They spent the morning flying over the nearby countryside under strong Disillusionment Spells. Despite Draco being as blue as the surrounding sky, Harry always knew where he was; his presence was too powerful to be masked by any spell. They raced and tried to outdo each other's manoeuvres as they flew over pastures of oblivious cows and sheep.
That was as difficult to process as the original realisation that Potter was a virgin. Months? That meant Potter’s feelings pre-dated any of Draco’s planning. That was before the drink they had shared at the Leaky.
“And Jowan?” Draco interrupted. He didn’t need to tell Potter his hotel was only booked for one event and thus there had been no need to guess which one.
Harry smiled. “I’ll be glad for something more exciting than confiscating a borderline Dark object from a wrinkled old witch who swears it’s been in her family since Merlin’s time.”
Draco came to a halt as he felt his meagre breakfast fight its way up his throat. Could his uncle really have—he thought—the Aurors had said … Not that it changed the fact that his father was dead and his mother had fled to South America.
Draco flopped back in his chair. Why did he bother? "Yes. I have a date." He sat up and raised a hand as if it could protect him. "And no, I don’t want to talk about it."
Hermione would chastise him for not knowing the name of the usual waitress at his favourite pub.
He looked up at George to see him smiling victoriously. Before Draco lost consciousness, his last thought was to wonder why George's hair looked white.
A warm feeling spread through Draco's chest. He still couldn't believe all the little gestures of kindness and concern the Weasleys showed him. "Thank you," he whispered.
Draco had seemed receptive to all of his advances, both romantic and sexual, but Harry wasn't sure how many fuck-ups the other man would endure.  Draco Malfoy was not known for his patience, even if it did seem to have increased over the years.
Draco could hear his mother’s voice and smiled at her growing bravery. She still avoided crowds and strangers, but she now frequented much more of the manor in the cooler months when the hotel wasn’t bustling with strangers. On quiet mornings, she would even brave the rose garden or walk up to the sea.
Draco wrinkled his nose. 'Don't tell her that. She doesn't need encouraging.'
of your legs to one of his." She pressed her left leg to his right to demonstrate. "Thus creating three legs. You can run just fine so long as your strides are in sync. It takes lots of practice."
Harry stood naked in the snowy wasteland, shivering as the cold seeped into his bones. There was nothing but white ground and grey sky for as far as he could see, so where was that beeping coming from?
He pulled away from Draco, clambered out of bed and fled the room. More swears rose from below a moment later. Draco sat up in bed and listened to the banging of metal and running of water between Potter's colourful outbursts. Finally heavy footsteps came back up the stairs, and Potter stumbled into the bedroom and fell across the bed.
A knock on the door interrupted him. Harry waited for Robards’ usual rant at the expense of his assistant, but instead Robards called out a simple invitation to enter. The door opened and his assistant stuck his mousy face in the crack. “They’re here, sir.”
“Of course, Ms. Clearwater.”  He stood with a smile and turned toward her office.  He tried to move swiftly, but was not fast enough to avoid a pinch on the arse.
As he was leaving for the next farm, he saw movement in one of the long glass greenhouses. There was old Rodney Snipter waving a gnarled hand around as he spoke to none other than Draco Malfoy. Of course! If Squib’s Friend had been legal any time in the last century, old Rodney would know about it. Harry couldn't help but smile at Draco's cleverness.
Squibs. They just wanted a nice hotel with great food that didn’t require an international Portkey.
“Harry!  Harry’s here!”
had to be present for Potter's mocking, it could be much worse.
Potter appeared at nine with tea for two—in crisp white cups that spoke of a proper tea shop and not the Ministry cafeteria—and a shy smile. They talked about the weather and Quidditch, but Draco found himself smiling by the time Potter left him to his work. He stared at his desk for a long moment before opening a file and pulling out a report on Cursed quills.
“So I've won over Weasley.  I can die happy now,” Draco drawled.  Potter rolled his eyes but was smiling.  “Now,” Draco continued, “I believe you were telling me about what more you could do in your bed.”  He took a step forward and placed his hands on Potter's chest.  Potter didn't seem to need further encouragement as he pressed his mouth against Draco's and slid his tongue past his lips.  Their tongues moved against each other briefly before their lips closed in a wet kiss.
“I don't think Muggles take Galleons, Potter.”
The wide expanse of navy bed made everything suddenly real.  This was Draco Malfoy's huge bed, and Harry was going to climb on top of it to take Draco Malfoy's huge cock.  Harry's cock twitched at the thought.  He could almost see himself spread out wantonly on the dark sheets with Draco pounding into him.
Robards cleared his throat again. “Yes, well, back to the case. Fernsworth, you and Sylvie have worked together successfully in the past. I’d like you two to handle distribution. Find out how it’s getting into people’s hands and whether any shops are involved.” The two witches smiled at each other in a ruthless way that made Harry glad they were on his side.
It was a simple statement, but Harry saw it for what it was: the answer to one of Harry’s silent questions. Information freely given.
“Here.”
to be there. The way the fabric of Draco’s clothing stretching across his lean muscle and clung to him, it was as if adorning his body were its reason to exist.
“I didn’t know you were good at Herbology.” Okay, not an inspired conversation starter, but better than creepy silent staring.
The Kauko with hair like snow has a second chance. He can chase pride, or he can chose to heal like his mother. To do that, he must find the bee.
Harry got up from bed, but didn't head for the shower.  He was approaching Draco with his arms forward.
Sitting alone at the bar, watching other men strike up conversations and flirt with strangers, Harry had felt ugly and unwanted. It was too much like being back with the Dursleys, and by the time Toby stumbled off the dance floor—looking sweaty and sated—Harry had been desperate to leave.
A tall figure made its way through the shop, and Harry could tell it was Malfoy from the the lean build and easy grace. Malfoy was dressed like a Muggle in dark trousers, a collared shirt, and a navy jumper. As he neared the door, Harry admired the pale hair that Malfoy now wore short on the sides but with the soft strands on top just long enough to fall into his eyes.
to do the right thing by staying away from the very attractive married man he still wanted to throw himself at whenever he had more than a couple of drinks. Harry was trying to do the right thing, but
Potter seemed to accept that the topic of Merryn was closed and took a bite of cake. His eyes fell shut, his lips closed around the tines of his fork, and he made a small moan of pleasure. It was rude and indecent and one of the hottest things Draco had ever seen. He stared hard at his coffee until Potter had finished eating and making inappropriate noises.
Potter got out of bed and stretched in full naked glory. "Breakfast tea from a bag or we can go out. But if I'm buying you breakfast I want a promise that you'll go to the fair with me." Potter turned to face him and his eyes held equal parts challenge and mirth.
“Rufus.” Harry said it slowly like he was trying it out. “I like it.” He stopped using his hand to stroke the spoiled beast and pulled Draco into a one-armed hug instead. Draco ended up pressed against the newly named Rufus, who looked distinctly unimpressed with their new proximity. He and Draco both.  At least he didn’t scratch Draco’s eyes out. Draco could work with that.
Harry looked up at Draco and saw the man's trademark smirk.
"I'm ready," Potter gasped and gently pushed Draco's head from his lap.
Harry couldn’t hold back the laugh that erupted from him. His mind was full of Draco interacting with children of all ages and not hexing a single one of them, even when provoked. He saw Draco’s sour look and tried to reign in his mirth. “Why
"And now?" Draco nodded toward the glass of wine in Potter's hand.
Harry shrugged, pulled his trunk out of his pocket, and cast the charm to return it to its proper size.
No. Best not to say that. He was trying to seem
want to know if any apothecaries or Potions shops are involved.” He turned a pointed look on the hooded witch, who turned toward Draco and back.
"Do you still think of me that way?"
'That was incredible,' Harry gasped. He was breathing so hard that he wondered if he'd remembered to breathe at all as Draco had tended to him—no
with them. It’s like they respect him as one of their own.” He leaned back in his chair and stretched his muscular legs in sharp contrast to the other three who sat leaning forward in their own chairs with their legs braced beneath them.
It was an hour into the party and almost everyone was present who was going to be.  It was the perfect time for Draco to enter with his perfect posture and exquisite robes. Harry knew nothing about tailoring, but he knew that the robes showed off Draco's lithe figure, accentuating his broad shoulders and the dramatic tapering down to his narrow hips. Tonight's robes were silver and grey with just enough shimmer and sparkle to catch the eye without seeming flashy. All eyes turned with Harry's to take in the sight of beauty.
“I’m not up to anything nefarious, Potter.”
Harry couldn’t have suppressed his smile if he’d tried. All thoughts of the war vanished as he imagined Malfoy feeding birds and squirrels like a Muggle child at the park. Warmth flooded his chest, and he resisted the urge to hug Malfoy and pinch his cheeks.
Draco stood up to his full height looking almost like the swaggering boy he’d once been. “Both.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at the insult. He had other social commitments! He attended his mother's teas and occasionally he visited Goyle. Sure it had been a while since his last date, or even pull, but he was in no way pleased to have to spend so many nights with Harry bloody Potter.
He pushed by the Irish Gryffindor and a couple of gingers before he was able to find Pansy. She accepted his gifts with a pointed comment about the new vegetable plot on the side of the house.
It took Draco a moment to decipher Potter’s comment; he had almost forgotten about the man between his thighs.  “Put me down, Blaise,” Draco ordered.  Blaise looked reluctant, but obeyed.  “See, Potter?  No problem.  Run along now.”
Angelina smiled at them as they sat next to her on a soft couch.  “They’ve been tested, and they all have antidotes.”
excuse for wanting to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord. What sauce is good for the goose, and all that.
“I am the one who will get in trouble if Weasley finds out.”
“Do you go to Muggle places much?” Harry kept his voice low so no one would hear.
Robards made an annoyed grunt. “Everyone in this room has been carefully vetted, Sylvie. He’s one of ours now.”
Harry would need to contact Ron to get reliable details on where the case stood. He looked up and saw an uncertain look on Draco’s face.
“Don't know how you boys managed it, but I don't think Substances has assigned us an advisor this quickly since Clearwater became Head.  Well done!”  A glance at Ron's wide eyes and limp jaw showed that he was as surprised as Harry was.  “Anyway,” Robards continued, “I hope Malfoy is more useful that the usual lot she sends us.”  He scowled.  “Can't be any worse.  I hope she falls into one of those damn canals.  Good riddance.”  He wandered off still murmuring to himself.
That left Draco and the other witch, and Harry would have to work with one of them. Part of him wanted to volunteer to work with Draco. Ron would certainly thank him. Despite Hermione’s improved relationship with Draco, Ron had never become a fan. Them working together would be a challenge to say the least.
Right, the whole surname categorising people thing.  "Shit, M—Draco.  I hadn't really thought about it.  Do I think that you're your father?  No.  I wouldn't be here if I thought that."
“No!” Potter squawked. “No. She was just being stupid—or really her future sister-in-law was—and I didn’t want to see her ruin her wedding over nothing.”
Draco nodded at his book.  “Do you think . . . do you think she ever wants to see
When Potter had finished binding their legs from ankle to knee, he stood up. They were so close that there wasn't room for their arms between them.
Harry thrust forward, losing himself to visceral sensation: hot, tight, slick, moving. He knew he was large, but Draco took him eagerly.
* * *
Harry wondered if he should be thinking.  His throat was dry, and he had no idea if he was talking or just gasping for breath.  Hands grabbed at his hair and his hips.  Lips found his, only to move away again to his cheek, his neck, his ear.  There were words.  Chants.  Moans.  Then the intensity increased, the tightness and heat, until there was an explosion of white behind Harry's eyes.
There was nothing prudish about the way Potter pushed their groins together and sucked Draco’s tongue into his mouth. All thought of plans and phases fled Draco's mind as he let his own fingers run around Potter's waist and down the firm flesh of his arse.
When Draco parted his lips, Harry tasted the wine more fully and felt the silky pressure of Draco's tongue.  He was damn good with his tongue.  All of the posh talking must have made it strong and nimble.  If his cock could thrust and rub half as well as his tongue, Harry was going to die from orgasm by the end of the night.  It was a good way to go, even if it would be damn awkward for his friends.
It didn’t help that Draco looked amazing in his clothing. Harry had seen plenty of men wear jumpers and trousers before, and none of them looked as if their clothing
Remembering his own breeding, Draco chose a sheet of his finest parchment and wrote a simple but gracious reply.  He decided that he would rather have Potter on his own terms, so he invited Potter to his house that evening.
Harry closed his eyes under the warm, albeit sticky, weight of Draco’s body on his chest.  When he opened them, his room was dark and Draco was gone.
Killing Lucius had been surprisingly easy after a childhood of failure. It was as if losing the war (again) had broken his spirit. It was actually rather disappointing, but it made it easier to accept that he would never get credit for the deed. The simple act of writing out "Death Eater scum" in Lucius' blood had ensured the Aurors didn't even question that the murderer was retaliation for Lucius' war crimes. Again, it was almost too easy.
Charlie furrow his brow in a thoughtful expression.  “Maybe that’s why he’s so damn
Draco had refused to practice over the weekend, claiming he was far too busy. It wouldn't do for Potter to think Draco had nothing better to do, and he
“Any work I can help you with?  I'm sure you must have plenty to do with only four days left.”
He waited until the weekend, exactly two weeks before Christmas, before broaching the subject.  They were at his cottage, as was their Saturday tradition, eating toast with tea as they struggled with a crossword from the newspaper—the Telegraph, because Harry figured it was as Malfoy as a Muggle paper could get.  They were sitting in the conservatory that jutted out into the garden, allowing them the sense of the outdoors without the cold.
of a job,” Harry corrected. He didn’t want Draco to think he was done with Harry just yet.
"You okay?" Draco didn't sound as confident as he'd hoped.
Malfoy’s lips curled up as if he’d eaten something rotten. “There are many reasons
Draco felt a rush of annoyance that Potter was using him as a pawn for more Ministry propaganda. "So this is just part of Shacklebolt's re-election campaign?"
Harry propped himself up on his elbows to glare into those stormy eyes.  "Don't you dare.  Get some lube and open me up."
Draco made his way back to his own department, having agreed to dinner that Friday.  As was his habit, he stopped into Clearwater's office for his morning schmooze.  As was her habit, she was engrossed in Witch Weekly and ignoring the piles of paperwork on her desk.  Draco noticed Potter's and Weasley's Auror Request for Interdepartmental Cooperation sitting on her desk under a book entitled Bewitching Canals: A Witch's Guide to Venice .
Potter nodded as if Draco had spoken. "Then let's find somewhere neutral."
When Harry arrived at his desk, Draco was already there—coffee in hand and perusing a case file that looked far more organised than it had when Harry had handed it over the day before.  Ron walked in a second later, and Draco began his report immediately.
As he looked at Draco in front of him, he allowed his mind to return to that beach and a particular moment in which Draco had bitten his lower lip. Harry'd had the impulse to bite it for him, but had pushed the thought away at the time. Now he embraced it. He imagined pressing his lips to Draco's, nibbling and sucking that lip into his mouth. He felt his cheeks flame before Flintridge's loud voice pulled him back to the present.
“If the place is that good, people will keep going. You know what these things are like: everyone makes a big fuss and two weeks later they’ve forgotten. Don’t seaside places quiet down for the winter anyway? By the time you go back in May, it will be booked solid again.”
***~fin~***
Draco was certain at least a couple sets of eyes fell on their joined hands as they moved through the pub. Potter was going to start rumours with his reckless actions, but Draco didn't protest. He should have thought about how the association would help his reputation, but instead his mind went to discouraging any others who might fancy a chance at Potter.
Harry nodded. "I'll check with the suppliers to make sure they only sell to the apothecaries Ron is checking.” There. Harry
Draco nodded dully. He didn’t have much hope of success, but he couldn’t argue that she didn’t have the right to demand it of him. She had forgiven him for Hogwarts and the war when he had done nothing but torment her for years. He owed her an awkward conversation with Harry, no matter how much pride he had to swallow.
“I want you,” he whispered.  “Please.”
Even if it almost killed them both.
“Potter!”
“What’s your favourite type of dragon?” he asked in hopes of improving his companion’s mood. Few things please Draco like getting to talk about dragons or himself.
“Nauseating, isn't it,” said the familiar drawl in his ear.  Harry spun around so quickly that he nearly slipped off his stool.  As it was, he slid forward and found himself flush against the delicious man who'd come up behind him.  “Easy there.”
Harry nearly laughed. Of course it was about food.
They walked until the air grew colder, and neither of them so much as stumbled.
Harry teased Draco that he was becoming like Dumbledore, taking in those the Ministry deemed unemployable or undesirable. Draco threw a tomato at him for the comment and then made him scrape the pulpy mass from his face into the chicken bucket so it didn’t go to waste. Harry didn’t minded too much.
Potter shook his head but smiled. "I'm mad, aren't I?"
sometimes. "
—turned it into the hotel.”
Harry looked up from the grey shirt and met matching eyes set above an amused and smug grin.  He closed his eyes and rested his face against the soft fabric, barely resisting his body's exhaustion and the desire to fall into a comfortable doze right there.
A dull plunk was followed by Potter's hands grabbing him firmly around the waist. Pansy would not be impressed that Potter had just dropped one of her crystal wineglasses into a vegetable bed, but Draco could not care less so long as Potter kept digging his fingertips into his hips as if terrified Draco might slip away.
