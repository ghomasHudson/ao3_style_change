"It is not nonsense, you intolerable wench. You're allowed to hold jealously over the fact that you will
But when Corey reached for his hand, Draco didn't pull away. Harry didn't know what he was, would never consider him as a choice if he knew. The world wasn't safe enough for him to be taking risks like that. This was how he needed to play it. A war was brewing on their back door.
"I'll be okay, Draco, you don't need to worry about me. There are other fish in the sea." Corey waggled his eyebrows at the line, and Draco rubbed his temples in exasperation. "Besides, I was beginning to sense your heart wasn't in it. I was waited until you were ready to confront yourself first."
"You're the whole reason she's in this mess!"
She grinned that one of the two was finally starting to get it. However, her ecstasy was short-lived.
Snape nodded sagely, bringing his mug back up to his mouth and taking a slow slip, as though contemplating everything in life that had led to him being afflicted by the
After a few minutes, he determined it was all 'out of his system' and pulled himself from the floor, reacquainting himself with the battered sofa he had rolled off of.
His mother was unwavering as she approached Griphook and asked to be escorted to the Black family vault. Draco was amazed at how well she portrayed herself as unafraid, wondered how easy it came to her, if it had gotten easier with practice... He hoped he mimicked even a modicum of her confidence.
Even up close he couldn't decipher the formation. He waited for her to finish her reading before looking at her with the question in her eyes.
"It is a rule whenever I am overseeing you as a student," Umbridge replied.
He got no answer. His attention was drawn back to the water at the air grew metallic. It was impossible to tell who had begun bleeding as they had healed just as fast, but it was obvious Draco was the culprit given from the crimson dripping from his maw; His fangs looked even sharper from the way they glinted in the moonlight.
to hear about this."
"Draco," she ordered, "You're going feral. Go back,
Andrew had run himself out of breath, and Draco tried to understand the flurry of words being thrown at him. "You're talking about Cassie, right?"
"Cassie, are we being watched?" he muttered, mindful to not let those nearby them overhear.
Aegeus shook his head. "You misunderstand me, child-"
Cassie and Andrew smiled sheepishly but otherwise did not move from their spots.
TW: hallucinations/delusions
There was a reason only Draco had to fear the loss of life on account of their bond breaking.
"Sir?" At this point, Draco wasn't entirely sure that Snape was talking to him in particular, or just venting to the world.
Albus. This is personal. If you haven't forgotten, everything I've done for the past two decades has been for her. You promised to help keep her safe, so pardon me if I don't immediately run to you when you fail to keep that promise. I trust very few when it comes to Cassiopeia's safety, and you've been dropped from that list."
Dumbledore raised a wand, and Corey snapped at the headmaster to back off. He kept advancing forward anyways, and Harry couldn't restrain himself any further. Hermione was unsuccessful in stopping him the second time around--likely stunned as the scene before them unfolded--and no one else got in his way as he rushed to the front of the Hall.
"Of course not," he sniffed, turning his head away from her, nose high in the air. Bloody Gryffindors and their desire to confront people about things. Was it really that hard to be passive aggressive like normal people?
Cassie stepped in between them. "Were you not present when I informed you of my cousin's illness? Not everything is about you, Potter. Draco is gravelly ill, and he doesn't need the headache you bring on top of the rest of his pain and suffering. Now, if you bother him just one more time about whatever lunacy you've turned to next... The Triwizard Tournament will be the least of your worries. You may just find yourself expelled from Hogwarts and inadmissible to any decent Wizarding School worldwide. They'll break your wand and make you more of an outcast than you already are. Now,
Corey leaned in to hear him, his expression turning from confusion to concern. "Cassie? Can you come 'ere?"
He retracted his hand like he'd been burned, hitting himself for being so careless when Draco was wounded. Yet as soon as he pulled back, Draco growled, grabbing at the waist of his robes to pull him back towards him.
Harry sat at the foot of the bed to catch his breath. "What was that? That Cassie did? I thought sirens couldn't influence other sirens."
Hermione watched in horror as a tear rolled down Snape's face. "You foolish girl. You needn't worry about me."
He shrugged to lessen the blow of his words. Yet, the second he had said them, he wished he had kept his mouth shut.
Except they weren't even just friends. They just, were. Harry had tried to hex him, for Pete's sake. Draco had thought that Harry hated him, had tried telling Harry that he had changed. And he'd been too stupid to realize that it was himself who hadn't changed, instead caught up in trying to maintain their stupid rivalry, because at least then Malfoy had talked to him!
Malfoy barely blinked in surprise. Ha! Caught in the act.
"Draco, is there something in my teeth?" Andrew asked, having caught him in the act of staring like a creep.
Hermione turned to Ron with her 'it's clearly obvious, but I'll explain to you anyways' face, but Cassie came from around the corner to beat her to the punchline. Snape followed close behind, but kept a distance upon seeing the state Draco was in.
"You absolute fucking fool! He doesn't trust you because you only see her as a pawn! She's important because she's his fucking daughter! Maybe we should have gone to the dark side for protection, because at least they'd value our lives! The goddamn fucking murderers!
And, ugh, Draco hadn't even thought that far ahead. They most certainly would be, and now Draco added that to his pile of things to mope about.
"Harry, don't!" Hermione warned as she yanked on his robes to keep him seated. He would've protested more, but Dumbledore had swept his way to the center of commotion and sent him a warning look.
TW: referenced suicide (mentioned briefly/in passing)
TW: swearing (brief), steamy make out sessions, ~angst~
Cassie pulled back enough to look him in the eyes. "If what Dumbledore thinks is true, I'm not risking what he'd do to you. To me, or Draco. If he knew about me there would be no lengths at which he would stop. I refuse to let him hurt you."
Potter shook his head in confusion, looking at the mauled grindylow and then around it in an attempt to figure out what the bloody hell had just happened.
Draco easily got lost in his head as they arrived at Hogsmeade, Cassie gently guiding him under the appearance he was escorting her, her hand curled around his bicep and tucked in by his elbow. He felt nauseous. Maybe this had been a mistake. The solid ground beneath his feet felt like a thousand pinpricks, he longed to be nearer to the Great Lake. The air was suffocating, he desperately craved the comforts of water pressure pushing in on him like a firm hug, the weight of its resistance slowing everything down around him.
Alright, Draco
"I'm going to the Islands to get everything ready."
"She will." Snape didn't seem to be having any of this. "Because if you die, then so does she. Even if she doesn't, there is no forgiveness to be had if I let anything like that happen to you. Don't you understand? Everything I do is for her, so she can live! She loves you, and if you feel the same you won't risk her life so carelessly."
Cassie came back from the ladies' room, sliding into Andrew's booth and squashing him up against the wall, as if there wasn't already a wide berth of room open for her to sit. Andrew glared at her in response, and she grinned like a cat that got the cream, putting even more force into the squish.
"I'm just saying, if the system is this easy to play, maybe it's time to reform the system. So many weak spots is like asking for someone to come and corrupt it. I still can't wrap my head around a bunch of adults not putting the pieces together that Harry Potter, of all students, is the one who gets his name unwillingly put in the Goblet! Ah fuck, my tea's gone cold. But if the damn thing's only supposed to allow one student from each school, what if someone went and said they went somewhere else, like Ilvermorny? What's the damn cup to know any different?"
instead of
More footsteps greeted them. "Dray, stop looking at the water like it's going to bite you, this isn't Louisiana."
Someone cleared their throat from behind them, and Harry nearly fell out of his seat, not recovering well when faced with Professor Snape. They really should not have been having this conversation in the library, of all places.
However, upon leaving the Hall, he saw a flash of bleach blond hair rounding the corner towards the dungeons. Sprinting after the figure whilst ignoring a yell from Filch about running in the corridors, he barreled into Draco without meaning to.
Andrew straightened his stature with a set jaw. "Draco's got cold feet."
She continued. "We were blessed with Her beauty, Draco. The beauty of nature, the purest of its kind. Everything that you are is a blessing, and you need to treat yourself to the same kindness that you give to those you love. Mirrors are ludicrous tools to reinforce false insecurities we have created in our own minds. If you don't banish whatever thoughts it has helped manifest in your head and leave for the dance with us right now, I will dye your hair bright pink and you will not be able to change it back for the rest of the week."
He huffed. Great, missing even
"Then get the gamekeeper! He has already shown an idiotic affection for dangerous creatures, and the oaf is far from a devious mastermind!" Draco couldn't believe his ears. Did all Dumbledore think about was various ways in which he could endanger his students' lives?
"I suppose this is our room now," Corey laughed, not phased in the slightest as he maneuvered around him.
slid to the floor next to Draco, still leaving a decent foot of space between them, and started to hum a low note.
"Doesn't work like that, Dray. Only the Siren that sang to someone can counter the damage. You could sing to them to extend the demands you wish of them, but trying to undo another siren's Song will do virtually nothing."
She released him, which resulted in both of them sitting in a comfortable silence while Draco tried to sort the spiraling thoughts in his brain. The worst part was that even though they ran rampantly inside the bounds of his skull, he had a firm grasp of their significance.
He placed a hand to Draco's cheek, who flinched violently from the contact.
He awoke late in the morning. Still in the robes from the night before, he cast a quick
"First, you must promise me something in return."
While temporary, the potion dampened his connection to Harry as much as one could without severing it (AKA: killing Draco). He hated the loss he was left with--like a gaping wound festering where a limb had been lost. It didn't affect Harry the same way, but Severus and Andrew had gathered it was because he wasn't a siren. The bond affected him differently as it was.

The professor looked like he'd been slapped. "She's my
Blaise looked at him expectantly, and Draco swallowed a lump in his throat. Worse case scenario, he just said 'no.' There were worst things, like embarrassing himself in front of the entire school, or in front of
Another twig snapped, and this time Corey snarled in the direction of the sound. As Snape came out of the shadows, the professor failed to conceal the deep roll of his eyes.
"Aegeus made them right before the sirens arrived at Hogwarts, he didn't exactly give them much of a choice."
Like a reanimated corpse, Potter stood, nodded his head in goodbye, and calmly walked out of the room. After a minute, only Dumbledore returned, looking as cheerful as he had left.
Dumbledore stood from his seat. "Alastor, I will have to insist upon your immediate suspension until after Winter Break. Attempting to hex not one, but two students, is quite the egregious offense ever committed by a Hogwarts professor. This punishment, in my opinion, is a tad too forgiving. But, as a longtime friend, I insist upon giving you the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. Take this sabbatical as a time for most needed reflection. You are dismissed."
Draco keened, the noise sending shivers straight down his spine. It was impossible to ignore the two spectators right next to them as Draco pulled Harry flush against him, Harry instinctively gripping tighter at the sudden movement and prompting another drawn out moan from the Nightingale.
"He's alive," he whispered, more to himself than the others.
There's not a single reason that you should have to prove yourself when it's hardwired in you to always take the bullet if it means your mate's life."
"I'm afraid that may not be an option in this case," Lucius cautioned, "I know with certainty that she is mated with another siren. Their bonds last even in death."
He was curious, after breakfast, what they possibly could have wanted him for in the Second Task. He obviously could not risk making them believe he'd even consider the idea of volunteering himself, with the task being in the Black Lake and all...
She grinned, stepping into the fountain and dragging him in by the wrist. "You're saying that, next time, I should just leave you to be threatened by a fucking Weasley? A wizard?"
Severus stood with a gloom expression on his face. It was very similar to the one he made when Longbottom botched yet another potion. "Very well. I will deal with the matter. Do not go investigating on your own."
Draco somehow ended up squished between Andrew and Cassie on a couch that really wasn't large enough for the three of them and their broad shoulders that protruded into each other's space. Said shoulders were bumping into each other as they all tried to get comfortable, before Snape took pity on them and charmed the couch to fit them more comfortably.
He mirrored her look with an added level of flair. "And that's on you for using scare tactics to get him off of my back with the bloody shovel talk!"
That concluded the story of Draco's first three accidental murders, and the part he played as an unknowing accomplice to the fourth victim that Cassie had 'put out of his misery' by drowning him in the sea.
Potter was a blur running past him with the amassed group of dark wizards hot on his heels. He needed to do something, anything, despite the growing lump in his throat and the searing pain that pushed past the adrenaline rush.
Corey.
It was hard to see how it may have transformed given the moonlight was partially blocked by his body. Afraid of losing it (even though Andrew could extract another one) he quickly lifted it to the gaping wound and pressed down as hard as he could.
care for Potter. There were too many reasons why it could never be. He was a siren, a fugitive, the son of a Death Eater. Potter was the boy-who-freaking-lived.
He nodded, feeling his lungs deflate in defeat. It really hadn't been anything more than a crush. Maybe it also had to do with the feeling that one of his closest friends was abandoning him, his cousin-kinda-not-cousin moving on with her own life while Draco was still trying to unravel his. Was that really what this was about? With all of these uncertainties piling up, had Draco finally reached his breaking point?
to do anything," he retorted.
As they left the diner and walked back to the contraption of death and destruction, there was a small group of young men gathered in the parking lot. Something about them made Draco uneasy, and he picked up his pace to keep close to the older sirens.
Ludo raised his hand like a timid first-year. "Pardon me, but did Mr. Malfoy say he had taken a numbing potion?"
The professor wiped away his tears, like they had never been there to begin with. He met Draco's eyes with a calm look of resignation.
"You will forget to mention what was discussed today, unless it becomes common knowledge. Look into my eyes, won't you?"
Cassie grasped Andrew's wrist, tugging him even closer to her side. "With everything that the Oracles have been predicting and that Moonbeam in France, Andrew's family put pressure on him to begin courting someone to be his mate." She ducked her head, hiding a grin.
"No, no, absolutely not!" he protested, not even needing to hear her say it aloud.
"You don't have to be enrolled at the academy to access their stores?" he pondered.
And that was the end of that. Cassie was done with her little show, resuming her glaring contest, and Draco leaned against her side. They'd have to levitate him back down to his quarters. As the voices in the room lulled in volume, assurances made that Draco would not be involved in any way and that they were sorry for even thinking it was 'permissible to entertain the idea' in the first place...
Cassie pressed her side into his. "It's not a commonly known fact, but a handful of centuries ago some alchemists discovered that siren scales were very effective in potions designed to make a person have the same health as someone young. The hunt for surviving sirens spiked, with the goal obviously being to obtain their scales. They called it the Fountain of Youth Era. We called it the Great Hunt of 1513."
"I didn't- I didn't believe it was true. You being ill, that is. I just thought, maybe, that it was an excuse... Is it really bad?"
Corey pressed a kiss to the top of his head. "Get some sleep, only a few more hours until we leave for Hogwarts."
Andrew gave him one of those stupidly cheery smiles. "I'm glad, I'm sure you two will have a lot of fun. Now, you may want to cover your nose for this next bit."
Andrew finished rolling up the cattails with Irish sea moss and added them to the bubbling cauldron. He turned to Draco with a patient smile.
"Listen," Draco said, "I wanted to talk about what happened in the maze, during the Triwizard Task..."
Now or never. "I know you had something to do with putting my name in the Goblet, and I know you're lying about this whole 'being deathly sick' shtick. Everyone else might buy it, but I'm not stupid."
He pointedly ignored the stares and whispers as they entered the Great Hall in a tight formation. Many were about there being actual sirens in the castle, but quickly the chatter evolved as they made it to their table.
Through Harry, Draco was now bonded to the Dark Lord. No matter how small the connection, this had been his fate all along.
She didn't protest, getting up and brushing off her robes of any lingering crumbs, striding out the door and down the staircase after her father. They certainly had the same innate flair for the dramatic.
, but dad's already been playing that broken record for the past hour."
He wasn't entirely sure he had a concrete answer for that. He could remember the moment just fine, how he'd had a burning desire to destroy anything that threatened his mate.
Harry wanted to hit him upside the head. "How is that relevant here?"
"When my first set of gills appeared along my neck, I don't remember it being this drawn-out of a process," Draco whined.
Draco grinned against his neck, arms snaking around his waist. They stood like that for what felt like minutes, hearts racing in tandem as they panted to catch their breaths. Harry had managed to get him to take a step back from the wall before the pressure became unbearable.
Moody seemed barely restrained from stomping out of the room like a petulant child, if his huff of disbelief were anything to go by. The door slammed shut behind him, and Dumbledore switched the focus of the room.
Speaking of Granger. "Malfoy was gone for a few days. It was odd to disappear before the term even started."
"I know. It's not even hurting his feelings that scares me so much," he admitted, "What are the others going to think of me?"
Things rarely were.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, her expression gone cold. "Oh? Is that all I'm good for, being friends with Harry Potter?"
"The conditioner will promote blood circulation to the area," Cassie explained without prompting, "You should apply it at least once a month, but also on new scales that come in after an injury to prevent infection."
He couldn't resist the urge to roll his eyes. "Don't remind me, it's bad enough that we
The trio followed both Dumbledore and Snape from a short distance.
The stone walls were cool against his back, rough edges digging into his shoulder blades as Draco forced himself even closer to him. In a moment of panic, Harry realized his blood was beginning to trail south. He tensed for a moment, prompting Draco to pull back to meet his eyes.
Merlin, the headache he could've saved himself by mating with another siren. Even when Cassie and Andrew bickered, at least they'd never have to worry about one of them betraying the other. Loving another.
Draco's head snapped over to the teacher's table. Following his eyes, Harry found the Potions professor staring down into his goblet while lost in thought. Finally, Draco would see that the man wasn't as great as he thought him to be.
from their magical core enough to destabilize their own, then I don't see why we shouldn't give this a chance. They're connected through blood and prophecy, and the amount of potential they have when separated..."
So, he improvised: "Andrew loves her just as much. He'd go through hell and back for her, you know as well as I do."
The doors opened, McGonagall hurrying over to Snape. She grasped the other professor's forearm with both hands before leaning in to mutter something unintelligible to Harry. As Snape processed her words his face changed into a calmer demeanor, his posture going rigid as the fidgeting was trampled from existence. Harry caught the end of Snape thanking McGonagall, then realized he'd been given a sleeping draught. His eyelids grew heavy--as did his bones--as he sunk into a dreamless sleep.
But if this war was going to kill him, he wasn't going down without putting up a goddamn fight. If he couldn't walk out of this blaze alive then
Andrew grinned, completely carefree about the fact he was the only thing keeping his cousin from mauling his boyfriend. He weaseled out of her grasp, throwing an arm around her shoulders and guiding her up to their room. As she turned, pitch-black eyes looked at him with calculating eyes.
"They aren't concerned with making a profit, this place is much different from the rest of the Wizarding World. You really should have Cassie take you around for a tour, I think it's long overdue."
Ron. Parvati went to find Padma, wouldn't Ron be with her? He tried his best to skirt around the crowds, not wanting to be deterred from his goal.
Harry felt like shrinking in on himself, Vernon's words pounding around his head. "Isn't it... not natural?"
Cassie didn't let up from snogging the living daylights out of Andrew, who had cracked an eye open at the sound.
If he let himself get close to Harry, allowed himself down that path... If Harry ever changed his mind, if he decided he could no longer handle the idea of Draco... It'd be the end of it. He'd be subjecting himself to a life of misery, a most painful and slow death stemmed from the agony of his own heart. Even worse, if Harry did not make it out of this war... Very few sirens were strong enough to overcome the grief. If they didn't go mad, they died of starvation, unable to even consider the idea of taking care of themselves. Most died soon after their mate, if not out of heartbreak then by their own hand.
"Now, who can tell me what the five kinds of sirens are?" Moody and his twirling prosthetic eye made Draco feel nauseated.
"There." He pointed with a shaky hand to a goblet on the farthest side of the room.
"HOW DARE YOU?" the Potions master screamed, and even McGonagall jumped in fright at the outburst.
Andrew had maintained his composure, not looking surprised in the slightest. "No one told him, Draco, he figured it out. Don't worry, he's one of the few advocates for magical creature rights, he's not going to let anyone harm us here."
"Narcissa, it's lovely to see you." The two smiled at each other, but otherwise made no physical contact. If this was supposedly a member of his family, would they not embrace for even the slightest of seconds?
The way Corey had smiled at him after eased the guilt that was building inside him. Corey was genuine in his friendships and spread his contagious happiness like the plague. He was loyal like no other, and would never willingly do anything that would hurt him.
The cause, perhaps, but not the source.
Draco brushed his thumb over the precious stone. His heart felt just as heavy inside his chest. He knew this had been coming.
He nodded.
He moved forward to hand it over to Draco, and he recognized his mother's handwriting in an instant. His head shot back up to look at Snape, but his question was answered before it could even leave his lips.
Harry couldn't help himself from letting his hands roam with unadulterated curiosity along the length of Draco's back, smoothing down razor sharp spines to lay flat as the rigid scales served to remind him who the predator was between the two of them. He had momentarily forgotten about Draco's injured shoulder until his fingertips brushed against the laceration, Draco releasing a choked moan at the touch.
"It's that black cat, again," he announced, and his mother pushed away from her chair with a childlike glee.
"It's been three days!"
"What-?"
Draco shuddered at the recollection of the tale. At moments like these, he did not wish to think too much about his future, but it was all inevitable. It wasn't like he hadn't brought it up with Cassie a few times over the summer. Talks about faking his death in the British wizarding world and going off to live with a pod in America. It was easier to be in hiding there, with the vast lands and the Magical Congress' lax laws regarding magical creatures. While sirens weren't immune in the States, the Native wizarding community had been strong opponents to their persecution and had stayed true to their word of protecting them.
The doorknob began to turn, and Draco leapt back. Cassie poked her head in, not amused with his behavior, grabbing his wrist and dragging him out into the parlor.
unleash your vile insecurities onto those drastically younger than yourself. You call us your students? Then take a hint from all the other professors in this godforsaken castle, and learn to stop acting like a petulant child with the emotional maturity of a toadstool. You want our respect, really? Then behave better than the
Hermione refused to back down. "Draco's a different person now! He
When Snape released the feral siren, Corey and Andrew shoved him into the Great Lake, their robes sopping as they blocked his escape from the water. Snape gripped Harry's shoulder and pulled him back from the water's edge as the elder sirens fought to disrobe Draco before he could tear the fabric to shreds.
Draco tossed and turned, his nightshirt rubbing his skin like it was made of burlap. It clung to his sweat-soaked body no matter how many times he tried to separate himself from the offending clothing to the point where he got fed up and disrobed and threw it to the floor. If only the fireplace was nearer; it would've been a much more fitting destination for the retched thing.
"You ain't coming along Draco?" Andrew asked, and curse his stupid smile of concern.
Ezio cleared his throat. "I can't help but agree with my grandson."
Snape chuckled, the sound lacking in mirth and not reaching his eyes. "Seeing as her mother was tortured by You-Know-Who before she took her own life to escape his wrath, one could say she was a very hands-off parent."
She sized him up in apprehension, before nodding slowly. "Very well. I'll dismiss you from your morning classes, as Mr. Malfoy seems to be in need of a comforting presence. However, this will not become a habit. I anticipate your presence in your proper common room in the future, for your own safety and for my peace of mind."
He imagined this is how his aunt Bella felt when she went too long without casting an Unforgivable.
They continued towards what Draco suspected was Dumbledore's office. They got to a griffin statue, the password as simple as 'Chocolate Frogs,' and the griffin leapt out of their way.
feel more confident at the idea of watching the Tournament from the actual lake itself. The water made him feel safe and secure, and he knew that She would never let him come to harm in her jurisdiction.
Albus Dumbledore, in all his glory, with Snape stood just behind him.
"Harry."
His own father. The bloody coward only cared about saving his own skin, damn it all if it meant endangering the rest of his family. He'd been distant since Draco had come-of-age, but to go this far? Did Draco mean nothing to him at all?
Severus walked over to Draco to wrap an arm around his shoulders, allowing him to tuck his face into his godfather's shoulder. He could feel the traces of Cassie's magic still clinging to the man's cloak.
"Does this mean you're ready to talk about Andrew now?"
He would not be pestering Harry with these insecurities. He already had enough times before their mating, and now Draco had to refrain from anything that'd push Harry away faster than he could leave on his own. Did that even make sense? Draco felt like he was making sense.
Draco laid on the ground of the bathroom floor, ready to hex anyone that tried to move him. He had barely slept a wink last night thanks to his stupid gills that were coming in on both sides of his rib cage. It wasn't even as excruciating as when his spines were manifesting. It was the type of ache that persisted no matter what position he laid in, aggravating enough that he had yet to find a singular position where the ache lessened even slightly.
Snape surprisingly didn't glare at him, but sent him a calculated look nonetheless. "Yes."
Cassie entertained him, biting back a growl. "Sirens and goblins don't get along. You should've paid better attention to not-Moody's lecture in DADA fourth year."
He was interrupted by Margo reaching over to tap at the tabletop to get his attention. "You have a visitor marching this way."
"But why Potter? Is he trying to get him killed?"
"Bloody hell, Andy, if she's feral then keep her somewhere she won't kill anyone," Draco complained.
"I would do anything, if it meant you didn't have to risk your safety," the Potions professor spoke, his voice lacking its usual timbre.
About twenty minutes later as they were all lounging around the fire karma came knocking at the door.
Speaking of, Draco's tail was
"Harry, don't look at me like that! Only an idiot would find Andrew unattractive, the amount of times I've had to listen to Draco wax poetry about his scales it's no wonder I picked up a thing or two..."
Hermione raised her hand before speaking, even though the classroom was vacant except for the three of them.
It sort of scared him how easily the older siren was faring. He didn't even have bags under his eyes or even seem to be having trouble sleeping, although it was entirely possible Professor Snape was supplying him with Dreamless Draught. But, unlike Draco, he didn't need to be harped on to eat a meal, didn't space out on a frequent basis. He had become mechanical.
"That's Draco Malfoy! His cousin, too!"
She wordlessly handed the letter to Andrew. Pressing the heels of her palms into her eyes Cassie began to take a few steadying breaths. After collecting herself for a minute, she fixed herself into a proper position, all straight posture and chin lifted and hands crossed on her lap with poise.
There was one question in particular burning an itch in his mind. "What about my parents?"
He entered the tunnel that led into the castle. Cassie and Andrew had beat him here, he could sense them already up near the surface. Maybe they'd be blind to the obvious guilt on his face?
"I forgot, how did I forget?" Ron muttered to himself, and Hermione's laughter grew even louder.
"The second task is in the Black Lake?" Draco almost couldn't believe his ears.
"Didn't he die? How's he a siren?"
"Then, one day, a traveler came through the small Oceanside town, and was struck by the beauty the girl held. He stole her away and robbed the girl of her innocence, and, once he was satisfied with his sins, the brute cast her aside to rot. She ran to the sea, an empty shell of the girl she used to be. Devastated of the pain She had been unable to save her from, Mother pulled her into the sea with the promise that no one would hurt her ever again. Using all of Her love, She created the First Siren, gifting her the ability to defend herself and never having to be the victim to that pain ever again. Newly transformed, she went after the brute, and upon hearing her voice he was captivated to follow her. Even as she walked into the depths of the sea and he began to breathe in lungfuls of wretched waves, he followed and followed to his last dying breath.
Harry kept moving forward, and Draco kept backing up until his back hit the wall. Harry was now mere inches from him. He licked his lips, and Draco's eyes traced the movement.
He must've looked as shell-shocked as he felt. He shook his head.
Barty Crouch took a step backwards, nearly toppling himself over as he tripped on the rug. Ludo gave an unsure smile; he appeared like he was trying to decide whether he was afraid or not.
Snape shoved Harry again, forcing him to tumble and crash into Draco's solid form. His arms had reached out to catch himself, but all he could focus on was the slick scales that had found themselves under his hands. From the few times he had felt a fish--courtesy of Vernon dragging him along on one fishing trip to carry the bait and equipment before deciding him too much a nuisance to ever bring him along again--he had come to the understanding that despite the scales their flesh was soft. Likewise, he had assumed that sirens' had a similar give, not dissimilar to when you pressed your fingertips into another person's palm: sturdy yet pliant, yielding but durable.
She was silent, save for an undercurrent of sadness surrounding him, letting him know that She heard him. That She could feel his sorrow, his fear. She made no move to try and comfort him otherwise, no declaration of love or promise that it was all going to be okay.
Cassie crossed over to the seating area where Draco was located, plopping down next to him on the sofa. He grumbled as he shoved her out of his personal space, but he did not try very hard to ward her off.
"You as well, Cassiopeia. This is my son, Draco."
Instead, Draco somehow found himself in the company of his friends from school year's past. They all seemed to pretend like nothing was different, like Draco had barely communicated with them for the past few months. Even more surprising, was their quick tolerance to the newest addition to their group.
"Oh, that's cool. Right, well, I can talk to Draco later, sorry for disrupting your lunch." He left faster than he came, form retreating into a sea of black robes. The meal resumed around him as he stared at the spot where Harry had disappeared into.
His former mate-to-be cleared his throat. "You knew this was a possibility. Hell, I think we all knew this would be the outcome."
"Draco," the eldest siren reasoned, "you're going feral. You love Harry, and he loves you! Meanwhile the Dark Lord is looking to bond you to him! What exactly isn't worth it? This is a two birds, one stone situation!"
The nausea intensified.
"You said no one was going to tell him!" Draco was also struggling with volume-control at the moment, but in his defense it was well past hours of when students should be in their beds.
Dumbledore calmly arranged himself in his seat as Moody was toppled from his chair and backed into the wall, Snape's wand digging into his throat with enough pressure to do more than bruise.
A laugh. Cold, short. "Before we were forced into hiding, they happened slowly over the years as children grew. After the Ministry decided we lost our right to exist? An instinctual preservation gene kicked in so the changes wouldn't happen until the kid at least has a bit of a fighting chance."
Once finished, he looked up, and she shook her head.
He stepped back, a slight wobble to his voice. "What makes you so sure?"
His parents had gotten him away from Voldemort. Of that, he was certain. After that was were he couldn't clearly make out the lines anymore, could remember the adrenaline scouring his blood as he ran, the invisible force dragging him forward with brave certainty. He hadn't feared the force, was able to blindly trust it even as it threw him into a shallow pond.
Cassie was just as lost for words as he was. She shrugged, and they moved along, not having the time for a discussion.
"There's no need to be nervous! You should be excited!" Andrew waved his hands around to express the grandiosity of it all. Blasted optimists and their distorted view of life-defining events.
! No wonder they've never been involved with this damned Tournament, they see it for what it is-" Her tirade ended on a choked sob, and she buried her face into the crook of Draco's neck.
The contact with the water helped his fever subside long enough for him to slide into the cold lake water, the pressure enveloping his head as he sank to the bottom.
Malfoy looked... Happy. The dark circles under his eyes had lightened, his face practically glowing in the silver lights of the Hall.
The entire courtyard was silent, everyone frozen, not daring to move or even breathe too loudly.
"It's okay, Draco, I'm right here," he reassured, lifting his hand once more. This time the touch wasn't rejected.
"Boys and girls must stay six inches apart," she tutted. Draco looked up in time to see the flick of her wand that yanked Andrew and Cassie's chairs apart.
"What do you mean, she's not there? Where is she right now?" he asked.
"Cassiopeia." He handed her the stack of parchment. "Can you at least assure me you'll be careful?"
He mouthed his thanks, getting a wink in return, and popped one into his mouth before treading back into the belly of the beast. The elder Oracle and her were still going at it with full vigor. At least no one had been stabbed in the two minutes of Draco's absence (not that either of them had noticed).
Cassie's features were more dark. Coffee brown hair that appeared black unless she was in the sunlight. Eyes much the same, the amber brown appearing inky black in all other lights. But she shared his build, and his bone structure, enough so that one would believe they were more closely related.
All he could feel was his throbbing head, his vision beginning to swim on top of his toppling surroundings.
Ron leaped to the offense. "I saw her arguing with Professor Snape! She called him 'Severus' and told him that if he tried to give her detention ever again she'd steal his left femur and beat him with it!"
"What's he doing here?" Potter felt the audacity to speak up, as if that wasn't the exact reason they were in this mess in the first place.
Lucius had learned quickly to not defy his wife's wishes. He had known that the date would arrive long before Draco had been born; the day where he would not be the best-suited to guide his son through his young life.
it gets worse before it gets better my dudes
Harry blinked. Once. Twice. The Triwizard Task.
She kept talking, and Draco couldn't find the energy in him to keep listening. It all seemed so trivial. Worrying about a dance, when there was so much else happening in the world.
She poured some cream into a small dish and set it in front of the cat, which immediately purred with delight at the sight of the daily treat.
The song finished and the couple broke away from each other. Cassie laughed at something not-Alex said, and the circle of onlookers parted for her. She strolled past Harry and a drooling Ron, walking straight up to Malfoy and doing some sort of mock-bow as she asked him to dance.
He brought his hand slowly up to Draco's shoulder once more--trying not to wince at the hot blood that seeped down his chest into the water--applying the slightest of pressure once his hand reached its destination.
They were sat in the Xylomancy classroom at St. Achelous' as it was conveniently a wide, empty room. The dirt floor was charmed not to tarnish their robes or togas, and cushions were placed in a neat circle to kneel upon.
"Would it be awkward for one of us not to move out? Would it be awkward if we did? Should I talk to him before moving out, or just do it quickly to avoid the conversation? Should I be the one to ask him to leave?" he rambled.
He was going to be sick. "Wait, are you saying that She's considering aligning herself with the Dark? Against Dumbledore?"
"Who even comes up with these ideas? How are we supposed to spectate an event that's deep underwater?"
Harry couldn't even find it in him to get mad at the nonsense Ron was spewing. He would be here tomorrow, they would see for themselves! Draco would be back, and Harry could finally talk to him about-
Draco would most certainly be recounting this tale to Hermione once all was said and done, just so she could properly lecture Ronald on 1) paying attention during class, 2) being knowledgeable on all things siren, 3) how goblins sold out hundreds of sirens they had promised to give sanctum to.
Even worse was what Snape shared at the last meeting before term started. Harry had barely been allowed in on that meeting, his attendance being sporadic to begin with. Molly kept pushing for him to be kept out of the loop, but with Sirius as his legal guardian, the latter had more say in what Harry could or couldn't do.
"I want Harry," he croaked.
Cassie smirked, nodding her head. "Asshole."
The others had left him alone with the shadows. He cried out for them as they grew faster and faster, running on the walls in a taunting jeer.
Things only got interesting when Potter's name came spewing out of the Goblet on the night of the school champions being selected. Of course the golden boy had to be involved in this mess some way. Had Draco not fundamentally changed as an individual, he'd sneer at the attention Potter was drawing to himself, as if the other boy could use any
Cassie brought the sleeve of her robe to wipe away tears that weren't there. One, two sniffles, and-
"It is not suicide, She will look out for you, no one will be needlessly endangered."
And thank modern architecture for its strange obsession with placing indoor water features inside buildings with large walkways. It was a peaceful reminder of nature, sure. But it felt so out of place when it had been brought into a place that had been lacking, the water confined to cycle through pipes and waterways and forced away from its natural habits.
The bloke from before had returned, with a furious looking Cassie in front of him. She stormed towards Moody, who seemed taken aback, raising a hand in his direction. Where was her wand?
Harry was not
Harry's head was spinning with it all, his newfound obsession with Nightingales not helping in the slightest. As the train sped on, and his friends moved on to lighter topics, Harry was still hung up on one Draco Malfoy.
"Why in Merlin's sake would they be so suicidal as to
Draco huffed. He was too tired to do anything else.
Severus stood from his seat, moving to gather some loose pieces of parchment from his desk. "You're certain, then? This is the best solution you could come up with?"
"A couple, yeah," Draco answered without hesitation, and this time Harry tumbled all the way down to the floor. It was only then that Draco came to the realization that Harry wouldn't understand.
Cassie turned to look at him, and he did the same. "I'm serious, though. If Corey hurts you, I'm making a coat out of his scales."
Draco turned to Cass as unease rumbled in his chest. "How did she get stunned? Nothing in the maze is capable of anything like that except for us."
Draco spun in circles, trying to find the location of the culprit to no luck. Why would someone do all of this for a silly game? It was just a cash prize in the end, plus a trophy that would mean absolutely nothing once the war started.
Severus had been caught up by an unexpected visitor in form of Bellatrix Lestrange.
"You broke up with Corey?" Harry cut off his rambling.
"Use protection!"
(Which had meant throwing Dumbledore under the bus, but that had been an easy decision to make).
The Golden Trio were gathered behind a pillar, quite obviously following them.
"I'm sorry for getting mad," Harry said, "It wasn't fair of me. You're right, it's not your fault. None of it was your fault, you didn't have a choice."
Draco screamed, and the reverberation of his Song made Harry's joints ache.
"Don't!" he screamed, "Stop!"
They fell into a comfortable silence, alternating between watching the rolling scenery and stretching out on the long benches. He was glad to have spent the summer with her already and gotten to know his few-times-removed cousin, otherwise this would be quite awkward the whole way.
"Harry, are you alright?"
Harry might've imagined it, but Malfoy appeared to roll his eyes in exasperation.
"Can I, um, can I share something with you? Something you'll promise to keep to yourself?" He couldn't meet her eyes, or the lump in his throat would grow to the point where he wouldn't be able to breathe, let alone finish this conversation.
if you haven't forgotten! I have no guarantee She'll protect him, and I care more about his safety then I do your damn prophecy! You've been guessing at this for almost two decades! Just because you think you have it right this time gives you
Draco's mating scale was the same shining gold as a snitch, a vibrant glow that loudly called attention to itself in contrast to the large expanse of black that surrounded it. His eyes kept finding their way back to it as he watched Draco float in the pool adjacent to his dormitory. In his defense, the opportunity to see Draco's siren form in the light was repeatedly stealing his breath away, and his eyes didn't dare neglect the rest of his body.
He had forced her free. Apparated her far, far away and stunned her so she wouldn't try to follow him as he ran away. She should have been safe after that. He should have made her promise to never come near him again.
This was not an ideal time to be having an identity crisis. "So, it's okay?"
There wasn't a doubt about that. He had been to the ocean many times before, but not since his fourteenth birthday. Now, as he stood barefooted in the shallows, he could feel Her love. The protection that She would always provide for her children, a promise no one else but Her could keep. The wizarding world would be no match against Her wrath, for no wizard in existence could be more powerful that a formidable force of nature. In that way, She was much like magic itself. A living energy that could not be created nor destroyed, forever existing, as true as the sun and stars above them.
"You are not going after her! I will be able to check on her," Snape spat, "She will never forgive me if you get hurt!"
The two men stood stiff as rigor mortis. Barely meeting each other's eyes as the silence stretched on between them.
"Oh, yes, yes, we're aware Mr. Malfoy has been... dealing with some health issues lately." Crouch used the word 'aware' like he was unsure of the definition.
She snorted. "The same could be said about you."
His body was trying to fight off an infection. His connection to Cassie left her vulnerable to the same ailment as their magical cores were so interdependent. His magical core was now infused to Harry's, but Harry's core had been compromised.
"How do we know that their bond isn't acting up because of the reflecting pool water they drank and not the prophecy?"
comes looking for you here."
Sometimes, it wasn't even Death Eaters they came across. Ministry officials, typically Aurors, trying to recruit them for the 'good fight.' They loved to wax poetry about how they wanted peace now, preached cooperation in order to win the war. While they were spared from death, they left with the clear message that siren-kind wanted nothing to do with the bastards after all they'd done to them.
"Your mother is fine, Draco. Nothing has happened to her."
"You were like that, in the courtyard. Your eyes were black like that, like Cassie's."
"Harry Potter, I am not sure if I've made your acquaintance yet. The name's Andrew. I'd like to keep the chitchat short, as Draco needs to ask you something."
The Gryffindor still wouldn't meet Draco's eyes. "What's it like, for you? When you get that way?"
"Their bond isn't like anything our kind has ever seen before. If they're able to reach each other's magic over such a long distance and
He grew quiet. The words he wanted to say died before they could even reach his tongue. He turned his head away as he quickly sat up. Cassie waited for him as he calmed the brewing storm within him to be able to speak.
His throat felt like sandpaper as he swallowed. "Yeah, yeah, I'm here."
Draco gulped. "Cassie?"
That was how Severus came upon him after he had failed to show up at breakfast.
His lungs struggled to get air. His feet were cemented down, and he was trembling, his joints protesting at the harsh movements. How had he been so blind? How had this happened? This was Malfoy they were talking about! He couldn't, he wouldn't-
He stumbled to his feet to assess the scene before him. Potter was running in his direction. Draco looked down, the cloaking spell was still active. Potter couldn't see him, nor could-
"Well, to put it so bluntly," he huffed, "but, yes. On Andrew."
Cassie tilted her head at him, as though the answer was obvious. "You did vanish for quite a few days there, princess. He probably thinks you made a pact with the Devil and you're out for his blood. I've only been here less than a week, and him and his friends are definitely the paranoid type. Like, not all people have it out for you. Maybe you're just annoying and way too self-centered."
He stared at the reflection of her eyes, a dark amber in the glow of the firelight.
She sighed upon meeting his gaze, likely disappointed he didn't recognize what she was doing. "Really, Dray, this is an important skill set to have. Our ancestors have relied on these predictions to survive after all these centuries."
Andrew and Cassie's heads whipped in Draco's direction with Severus' glare following.
"I think that he will definitely hurt you, but it will never be on purpose. He will blunder many times before he starts to get it right. He will never be complacent to your true pain."
"This is not about you, Potter. Sit. Down." Snape waved a hand, conjuring the nearest chair to slide over, running into the back of Potter's legs so he'd topple back and be forced to take a seat.
Andrew felt this was the opportune time to comment: "You're so lucky the wizards aren't here to listen to this crap; Weasley would be demanding our heads on spikes already."
It was like flying, but
The champions jumped forth into the water, and Draco waited a beat before following Diggory. He glanced back to Potter apparently drowning himself, and shrugged it off to follow the true Hogwarts Champion.
"My money's on Mad-Eye," Cassie mentioned, her interest directed more to the heaping mountain of mashed potatoes occupying her entire plate. It was by some divine miracle that none was occupying anywhere else, with how it threatened to spill over the edges.
"I think Moony's anxieties about his husband purely exist because he couldn't be here with us."
in the art of Divination."
Draco stood up in a heartbeat and Snape didn't even flinch as Draco rushed out, "Sorry, but I need to go talk to Harry."
Draco's eyes flittered throughout the hall, mindlessly eating as the conversation lulled around him. Around his twentieth or so pass of the Gryffindor table, he was not surprised to find Weasley and Potter's gazes directed straight at him with suspicion and discontent clear on their faces. For once, he loathed the attention, quickly looking away in hopes to drop their interest.
Crouch regained his footing. "Of course. Mr. Malfoy, we require your assistance in the Second Triwizard Task-"
Two hands cupped his face and he shoved them away. Everyone was too close, his clothes were too tight, he couldn't
"Andrew can never stay mad at you, I'm fairly certain he forgave you before he even processed what you'd done."
Corey reached out to embrace his hand with both of his, palms cradling him like he was an injured bird. Draco couldn't find it in him to say 'no' to the question resting on the tip of Corey's tongue.
Not that he minded. It was nice to have people that cared. Both had done more than either of his parents combined. Father almost acted as though Draco wasn't there sometimes. He had yet to send any sort of letter this far into the year, and hadn't corresponded with him over summer either. His mother, with whom he had sent daily letters over the summer, regularly sent him letters and parcels of treats each week. But she'd been quite unhelpful on the Siren front.
Someone, perhaps Corey, broke off into a sprint, the squelch of damp forest leaves and dirt marking his departure.
Draco nodded. They stared at each other.
Hermione filled in the gaps for him. "You're physically marking him, he's going to want to mark you, too."
Draco hoped that she didn't regret it. He certainly wouldn't have.
Malfoy's companion sized him up, but then made eye contact with Malfoy and took off. Harry didn't pay too much mind to him.
Cass beat them to the punch. "Just spit it out. I have evil things to get to, a small child to dismember."
Cassie's hair was drenched from the shower spray. He watched the dark tendrils cling to her face in disordered swirls as she talked to Andrew. Well, less talk and more commanding. Andrew called it her 'delegating' voice. Normally, it'd made him smile.
"Can't you teach me to use my Song, so I can just undo it?"
Draco.
. Like the water knew where he was headed and made way for him. In a way, the water likely
"They were going to hurt me. Kill me, maim me, and you of all people should understand," Draco forced out to the frozen boy, "They've been killing us for centuries, skinning us for our scales and making us drown in our own blood. You think I enjoy it? Enjoy this? It's not a choice, none of it was ever a choice! Don't you get it?"
"He's bleeding." His godfather was there, a blurry figure looming over him.
"I went to see him on Saturday, and I knew he wasn't doing well, and Cassiopeia had, she had-" Hermione hiccuped. "Had warned me that it wasn't looking good. I tried to see him again yesterday but he was asleep and Snape was with him, Andrew told me to come back tomorrow but, but-"
The fear fell from Mad-Eye's face as the man leapt to his defense. "It was justified! She's just as rotten as her father! Powerful wandless magic, no doubt taught to her by her no good, Death Eater-"
"You're lucky there are witnesses present, or the things I'd do... They would not even recognize your corpse," Snape started, but Dumbledore cheerfully cleared his throat, which was enough for Snape to collect himself and back off, dusting himself off with an unnecessary amount of aggression.
Loud growls and splashed waves of water died down as the Nightingale finally stilled where he was held. His charcoal eyes lazily looked around, the effects of the sedative still in effect. They landed on Harry, and in the blink of an eye, they were back to their usual pale grey.
on the Hellfire siren before him. His warm almond-shaped eyes were always kind and inviting, and when Draco got caught staring by them he barely managed to not completely malfunction and disintegrate on the spot.
Draco snarled but otherwise stilled in his movements. Harry rubbed his thumb in circles over the sharp lines of his cheekbone, waiting patiently as his boyfriend's heavy panting slowed to calmer breathing. Behind him, Dumbledore was yelling at Harry, yelling at sirens who were blocking his way.
Potter leaned forward, eyes glazed over, his body lightly swaying in the trance. He could hear the low hum emitted from Andrew, so deep it was barely audible to the untrained ear, lasting a brief few seconds before Potter's eyes cleared, and the room fell silent.
Perhaps... Chang? Diggory was friendly enough towards him, but Draco didn't think he was more important to the Hufflepuff than his girlfriend. Unless Diggory was fiercely in the closet, which would add up considering he was an only child, but Draco always considered the Diggory family to be on the more progressive side of wizarding society.
No, that wasn't fair. Corey could not be blamed for his humility. That was just how he was. Killing everyone with kindness. Draco had only harmed himself in letting it get to this point. He had gone to Corey to forget himself before he was a siren. Tried to shove down that old part of him as a solution to his frustrations. Now, it reared its ugly head.
Harry scanned the room, looking up at the teachers' table to find everyone present except for Snape and Dumbledore. His attention was quickly drawn back to his table when George stated, matter-of-factly:
They sat, and Cassie leaned over his shoulder. "I love being reduced to Draco Malfoy's
"Professor, does that mean-" Harry started, and Snape silenced him with a hand snapping into the air, doing the sign for him to zip his mouth shut.
The thirteen were ushered into the castle before the students could wake up and catch a glimpse. It was Pomfrey, of all people, who greeted them and led them to their new residence. Walking past the entrance to the Slytherin common room, they came to the same portrait of a kraken that marked the entrance to Draco's private quarters from last year. Pomfrey taped thrice on its head, and it swung inward to reveal a room quite transformed from the one he remembered.
"Corey. My mate is a natural born seer, and is attached to Draco at the hip. Tell me that you at least noticed he spends more time with her than he ever does with you or me. Hell, if he's spending time with me, it means that Cassie has decided to grace me with her presence."
Draco stood so quickly that Harry got whiplash looking back to him and then turn again to watch as he stormed up to the teachers' table. The other sirens had decided now to fall silent, along with the rest of the students present, as it was obvious something significant was about to go down. Before Harry could stand to join Draco in support, the latter was already straight across from Snape and leaning over to whisper whatever accusation he had on the tip of his tongue.
Parvati made a comment about finding Padma and disappeared before he could really process what she was saying. His eyes flew back to Malfoy--they honestly hadn't left the Slytherin in the first place--and tried to process the sight before him.
"The Champions will be instructed to send up a blast of red sparks should they require assistance. By doing so, they have forfeited their right to the Cup, and you shall escort them safely back to the entrance. The maze has been briefed that it must protect you from the Champions' sight at all costs, and will assist you in staying hidden should you need to escort a Champion out. I wish you both the best of luck."
The gemstone in his pocket suddenly felt heavier than lead.
Hermione grinned with pride, eliciting Ron's face to fall. "Yes, actually, I've been corresponding with Cassiopeia all summer."
Cassie stirred as his voice raised in pitch and was very quick to read the room.
"Hush."
The Golden Boy gaped like a fish, and Draco decided he'd heard enough. Cassie had not stopped for him, and was already towards the end of the corridor. He moved to catch up, and Potter had nothing else to say. He didn't look back, but Draco wouldn't be surprised if it had been a minute or two before Potter unglued himself from the spot once the shock had worn off.
If Lucius disproved of the hug, there was no visible sign. Ever since the end of Draco's third year, that's how it had been. Narcissa taking a sudden charge over Draco's upbringing and Lucius being put in his place if he attempted to have a say. The first time it occurred had been jarring for Draco, not used to his passive and mild-mannered mother lose all subtlety and begin to announce how things were going to go.
Snape glared as his coughing slowly died down and made no comment before moving on. "It should be noted that for this portion, both will need to be in the water, if that wasn't already implied by the need for a scale. After She aids the human's part of the ritual, the scale should then be taken and inserted into the incision on the Siren's shoulder. At that point, the ritual is complete and water can be poured over the wound to heal it. It's very likely,
"Fucking hell," Cassie grumbled, tying her hair up into a bun. Severus turned to her expectantly at the curse, mouth half-open as though uncertain if he should chastise her or not.
"Cassiopeia, have you considered simply spectating in silence? We wouldn't want to hurt Blaise's ego with a discussion that is clearly above his level of comprehension, you understand."
Andrew peeked over his shoulder before giving Cassie some sort of signal, and both of them rushed to join him. His first swim with his tail-
"Yes, Andrew says I need a formal tour of the Islands and to not stay cooped up in the villa all day."
Corey looked like someone had handed him an empty wrapper when he'd been expecting candy as he took the hand to shake.
"Cassie?" There must have been something in his voice, for she was quick to look at him in concern. "What do I do if someone finds out? What if I can't keep it secret? What if a potion explodes in my face during class and they rush me to the hospital wing and then Dumbledore finds out?"
Moody was chastised for his handling of the situation, and Harry heard Dumbledore's name brought up, yet he was still trying to wrap his head around the wandless magic he'd just seen. Wandless magic was incredibly difficult, especially one that was powerful enough to ward off a hex. Cassie didn't even break a sweat, hadn't even hesitated. She'd done that before.
Madam Pomfrey finished cleaning his wounds, shoving a potion into his hand for him to drink. Snape was still hovering nearby, likely on Dumbledore's orders, eyes flicking over to the doors every few seconds. The man was fidgeting, something Harry didn't even know Snape was capable of, like a bird itching to take flight. Was this about Mad-Eye turning out to be Barty Crouch Jr.? Or did it have to do with Voldemort's return?
Draco fixed himself so he was knelt at Harry's side, clearing his throat to diffuse the tension. "Right. Potter."
All three stood shocked, stunned into silence. Cassie didn't wait to hear anything else they had to say, hooking an arm around Draco and ushering him down to the dungeons. As she walked up to the portrait of the kraken, tapping thrice on its head, Draco wondered what Potter thought of him now. Would he be happy that Draco was suffering, even if he didn't know the true reason for it? Or, would he have pity like his housemates?
"What is it now?" Malfoy asked.
Draco's mind was swimming as he tried to process what he was being offered. They wanted him as a safety precaution in a historically deadly Tournament? At that point in the year, he'd be a newly-matured siren, fresh into his powers. He had extremely limited experience with his Song, the only few times he'd used it were accidental! Well, he had been practicing, but only on Cassie and Andrew who were immune to its effects... He wasn't ready for a responsibility like this! What if he exposed them both to the Wizarding World? Someone was already hunting sirens and killing them, did he really want to risk putting a target on their backs? And-
Draco hoped his dissociating wasn't that obvious to the blind eye. As Dumbledore droned on about new staff, the Triwizard Tournament, Merlin knows what else... He couldn't buy into the excitement. He simply wished for the feast to be over so he could retire to his dorm.
If Dumbledore was involved in this, it could mean nothing good. It wasn't public knowledge that Snape had a daughter, and yet they transferred her to Hogwarts for the school year. Were the States not safe for her? But the threat was targeting Snape and Draco as well...
He nodded, clinging tightly onto the cloak, pretending that it wasn't just a trace of Cassie's magic enveloping him. He didn't bother to look up when he gave his answer.
If you had told his 11 year-old self that he would have ended up playing muggle card games in just a few years and having the time of his life with a bunch of fugitives, well. He might say you’d gone mad.
"He wishes to force a bond upon him. Upon-" he sobbed, "Upon Draco."
"You've killed people!"
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat before answering, "There's nothing that anyone can do or say to talk me out of this now."
His tail. Cassie had charmed the ceiling to be a reflective surface the day prior. He hated the concept at the time, but now he rejoiced in it. As his transformation completed after a brief few seconds, he couldn't look away. It was just incredible.
"Amphitrite is mostly a residential island?" Draco asked.
He couldn't exactly say 'are courting to become lifelong mates, which is irreversible even in death, thus destroying my chances eternally.' That didn't really roll off the tongue, and would raise more questions than it would settle.
A door bled into existence, swinging inward for them. Inside, Draco was welcomed by the familiar sights of his private quarters, not a thing out of place despite the room hopping to a new location. The moment his head hit the pillow of his four-poster bed, he was dead to the world around him.
"Good, good. We'll have to move some things around, we can't risk you getting involved with him. Something's coming, Dray, something dark. Given Potter's track record, he'll act as a beacon for that darkness, it'll just put us all at risk."
"Cassiopeia, I need to speak with you. Privately," Severus spoke, purposely avoiding the three analytical gazes directed at him.
She composed her smile into one of benign innocence. It wasn't able to soften the steel edge in her eyes or the shark-like quality of her teeth. What it did do, however, was throw more fuel into the fire that nipped at their proverbial ankles.
The hairs on the back of his neck prickled. Someone was watching them. He blearily scanned his surroundings, but he was closer to passing out cold than being an effective lookout. Andrew and Cassie had stopped in their tracks, likely sensing the same thing. Survival instincts were silly that way.
Andy scoffed, "Probably your weird psychic bond from the reflecting pool water--which we still don't know the full consequences of--or your weird psychic bond from your birthright prophecy; Take your pick."
At least he wouldn't be Draco there. At least he'd have a mask to hide behind. The perks of Polyjuice Potion, and all that.
Malfoy. He'd been calling him 'Draco' in his head. But to Draco, he'd only ever been 'Potter.' He was always going to be just 'Potter.'
Hermione beamed at the opportunity to share her knowledge. "Nightingales are the only siren that form hunting pairs, as their magical core is fairly unregulated in daylight. When solidary, their magic seeks out stabilization, and witches or wizards with a powerful magical core can send the siren's magic into further unbalance."
Wiping the tears away furiously, Lucius smiled manically, on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He nodded at Snape's response, before pacing the length of the room while rubbing at his face.
"Don't tell Snape you said that."
Harry was sat at his own table for that reason, his teammates boisterously causing a ruckus just so they could be the center of attention. Draco ached for him to be sat with the sirens, but that would go against their new agreement. No being seen with each other outside of his common room. Technically, it was Dumbledore who had insisted on that rule.
No one was telling him anything. It made him want to strangle someone.
The rumbling was finally beginning to subside, the lack of aftershocks confirming that it wasn't some form of earthquake (even then, the Ministry would be warded against something as straightforward as a natural disaster). Cassie knelt down slowly, helping Draco prop himself up against the wall as she leaned around him to reach for something.
"It's not a death sentence, Draco. I'm going to be okay."
A 'no,' then.
Cassie huffed, snatching his wrist and yanking him towards the bath. He looked at the wall with disinterest as she took off her robes, feeling like a stubborn child as he slowly followed suit.
would.
Huh. It was the first time Harry had ever heard her last name. He'd seen it last night, on the map, but he'd assumed that it was also Malfoy for the longest time, seeing as everyone referred to her as Cassie.
It likely did not help that he considered her more of a sister. Not that
"You will not 'poison' yourself, please, there's no need for dramatics."
Forty-one. Forty-two.
Definitely Severus, then. Probably looking more worried than before if Harry failed so badly in hiding his nerves.
As the pain drained from his head he was able to glance over his shoulder and observe as Cassie gathered another handle of water to pour over him. His nose made a loud crunching noise as it set back into place. Now healed, Draco was able to wrinkle said nose in distaste at the gross sound of it fixing itself.
Cass pulled on a hoodie, prompting Severus to cut in. "And, do tell, where you think you're going?"
Draco crawled towards the blood scent in hopes to find something to tamper his hunger. The room he was in was small and windowless. Had he not been a magical creature, he doubted he would've been able to see a damn thing at all.
Cassie's posture straightened, eyes sharpening like a hawk. "If you call me 'child' one more time, you will find yourself unable to use your tongue for the remainder of your pitiful life."
The next tear was rerouted as she tipped her head back and emptied the vial, falling into her hair where it would stay. He stared at the spot where he thought he saw it run off, when rogue shadows slipped into the corners of his vision. He spun to keep up with them, to catch them in full view, and they mocked him.
of a pitiful glance. Great, just great. Exactly what he needed right now.
A bunch of bull, in Draco's opinion.
Hermione groaned, "Stop calling them 'beasts,' Ronald, it's degrading."
"And in pairs like Cassie and Andrew, their bonding scales are super obvious," Hermione added.
Lucius looked towards the floor, shaking his head slowly like he couldn't believe what he was about to say. Looked up to look dead at Severus.
Potter looked ready to burst into tears. Draco rolled his eyes.
"You're an ass," he laughed, "you know that?"
Severus gulped. "I'm afraid not."
Merlin's fucking balls.
looking at him? This wasn't entirely his decision!
Aegeus had the audacity to roll his eyes. "She would never let that happen, not to you two."
Draco paced a line back-and-forth in Cassie and Andrew's shared dorm. Cass was lounging on the bed, eating pumpkin pie that she'd gotten from Merlin-knows-where, and Andrew was sat next to her scribbling something in his journal.
Nevertheless, Draco survived the day without any major life-changing events. Come time for dinner, and he was exhausted. He may have to take up Severus' offer to build him a reduced schedule with no electives. He couldn't imagine what it was going to be like once the bones for his tail began to fuse. Would he even be able to walk, let alone climb the ever-changing staircases?
Cassie stirred once more, dragging him from his thoughts. A shiver ran through her body, and it was enough for him to abandon his notes completely. He spun around the room as he tried to remember where he had stashed his wand to no avail. Seeing Cassie's--which worked just fine in a pinch--he cast a warming charm onto the blankets. She settled, grumbling as she did so, tucking her nose under the many layers of blankets. She always did run cold. He blamed it on how bony all Nightingales were, which was ridiculous considering they were built for harsh, cold waters.
The conversation went no further. Not after a revelation like that.
"Scared, Potter?"
Jessie and Corey were back at the cabin, having decided to spend the night in. Cassie had demanded they go out for some pie, and Andrew had driven them in the muggle death machine to where they were presently. But, he had to admit, the pies they served were surprisingly addicting. All the waitstaff knew them by name at this point, and they had only been here a few weeks into the summertime.
"Is none of your concern. You will stay here and protect Draco. If you go after her then he'll follow along right behind you, and then that's three sirens in the hands of the Dark Lord. Prophecy or not, I refuse to risk Draco's or your life when there is an alternative solution."
"Still comfortable splitting up?" Cassie asked.
Draco was dead.
The French doors opened as he sat down in the seat next to his mother. She had already poured his cup and added his preferred amount of cream and sugar, and he murmured his thanks as his eyes trailed over to their guest.
Snape closed his eyes, stray tears trailing down to the ground. "More than anything, I knew that the day she found love was the day where her life was no longer in my hands. A selfish part of me wished she would never, but I'd be cruel to deprive the earth of the happiness that he brings her. I'd go mad knowing I was in the way of her feeling the purest, most selfless feeling in the world. Yet, I find myself wishing that I had, hid her away from the pain that love brings. Even if it had made her hate me with every fiber in her being, at least she would be safe."
He staggered to his feet, Cassie patting his shoulder before turning to Harry. "Next time, you ought to wait till you have a bit more privacy, if you don't want an actual bloodbath on your hands."
Wait.
Draco straightened his dress robes in the mirror one last time. They appeared black at first glance, but shimmered a deep emerald green when caught in a certain lighting. He felt that they made him look even paler than he actually was.
"I thought only old sirens that couldn't defend themselves anymore lived there. And, St. Achelous? No one bothered to tell me there's an academy for sirens?"
Andrew put his head in his hands. "I'd forgotten about that, thank you so much for reminding me."
She opened her mouth as if to say something, but he beat her to it.
He couldn't be one to judge her blood purity. If only she knew what he really was... Sirens ranked even lower than muggle-borns, at least the latter was allowed to live.
"Haven't you heard? I'm
"Yes, yes, right this way."
He shoved Draco forward so he stumbled to his knees, almost landing on top of Harry himself. Draco blushed furiously, and Andrew slipped away like a cat in the night.
It had only taken her a little over a week to find him in his home in Spinner's End. No matter how hard he pushed, she kept coming back, refused to be turned away.
(See the end of the chapter for
As they grew closer to Gringotts, Draco snarled. While he was needed for the mission, he still felt his blood boil at the faint scent of goblins.
Harry let the cloak drop from his shoulders, scanning the room in deep focus. Draco winced, either in sympathy or in shared pain, as Harry pinpointed the horcrux among them.
There was a clanking sound of whatever had tumbled to the floor being picked up, followed promptly by Andrew exiting his room to join them. Unlike Cassie, he had not chosen the same color palette as his siren form. His dress robes were quite simple, as were Draco's, and had clearly been chosen to compliment his date's dress. The main color of it being a tasteful ash grey, almost white in color. What really stood out was that the fabric was charmed with wisps and swirls of a stronger grey that slowly danced throughout. It reminded Draco of campfire smoke from those that they had shared over the summer, ascending into the night sky to be consumed by the atmosphere.
He sighed. "They're dating, but yeah, probably going to the Ball together as well."
"Ah, here it is."
The magic floating about shifted in the slightest, like a mouse leaving its tracks on a fresh blanket of snow. Someone was coming.
Cassie carefully helped him disrobe, and only once his shirt was removed was the source identified. He felt Cassie's hand lightly touch the spines beginning to form under the skin on his back, and he didn't even attempt to restrain the scream of pain that escaped him. That was the whole point of private quarters, after all.
Draco ended up missing the first four days of classes. Not that he minded too much, with Cassie doing all the assigned work he had missed on top of making him review guides of the topics for him to catch up.
"How does your kind endure this? This seems more like a botched homicide than a coming-of-age transition."
." It was more of an exhale than a whisper as it fell from Draco's lips and Harry didn't want anyone else to say his name ever again. They'd never be able to say it so beautifully, make him feel so worthy of being loved.
"You're not entitled to telling me how I'm supposed to feel."  Draco looked at the pool, butterflies stirring in his stomach and rising up into his chest.
Draco spent the majority of his days at Sirenum Scopuli learning to brew siren-specific potions from Andrew. It was very different from how he was used to brewing in that the ingredients seemed to be outrageously specific at times.
She let out a huff of air. "That's really not a judgment I'm suitable to make. I cannot decide these things for you."
He must've said that last thought out loud, because Cassie stopped in her rambling (but not her steps forward) to make a snarky comment.
"You are too young to be using language like that."
Andrew moved to be closer to Cassie, measuring Draco's expression as he did so. "We were planning on waiting to tell you until it was official, as I've only just gotten permission from Severus and didn't want to test his patience any more..."
While he embraced his siren heritage wholeheartedly, the transitioning was almost not worth it. Regardless, he did not have much choice in the matter, as there was no stopping it. It would happen whether he wanted it to or not.
Cass took a sip of her tea from where she was sat at the edge of the pool. "That passageway was formed when you were born, all that had to be done was shed some skin. The bleeding should stop in the next hour or two, but you're not going to be able to walk any long distances for the rest of the day."
One thing was still unclear. "If the problem has to do with Harry's magical core, then why is Cassie miserable too?"
Cassie smirked, "they're two completely different forms of magic. Wizards like yourself need a wand to help channel your magic, whereas wands limit the extent of a siren's. It's not dangerous, really, it just pushes us further from our humanity and more towards our sirenhood. It's a protective instinct, really."
"If you say no, then I will support that decision."
Draco, having only woken up less than a half hour ago, found his way to the kitchen. Andrew was there--likely avoiding getting dragged into the conflict--and he wordlessly slid a plate of grape leaves over to Draco.
A chair toppled over from the speed at which it was pushed back, clattering to the floor as its owner stood up. Cassie finally lifted her head from her seat, if only to look up at fuming Andrew with a calculated innocence to her face.
As they reentered the pool and breached the surface, Draco could sense a presence before coming up. Expecting his godfather, he almost shrieked when it was anyone but.
When he got there, Andrew and Corey had Draco on his knees, pinning him to the ground by his shoulders. Another siren was holding down his legs, while another was putting a physical distance between him and Dumbledore.
"Dude, it was Draco's decision to terminate the courtship. She'd be upset had it been you to do so, or if you had tried to sabotage it in some way. She's not blind, either, she definitely knows the likelihood of Cassie meddling is one-hundred percent certain."
"That cat has a
Corey ran into Draco's back from where he stood stunned in the doorway.
He thought back to the previous year and the punch that he'd taken. He'd been awful to Granger, there's no way she'd forgive him for such intolerant behavior.
"Dracoooo-," she drawled out the last vowel, "no one will ever know we were there! We can enter the lake from the pool here in our rooms! By the time the second task rolls around, you'll be almost completely mature! That means a tail, scales perfect for camouflage, it'll be great practice for navigating while trying to avoid being out in the open."
"It's a blue lace agate. It represents justice and loyalty, and reminds you to feel lighter even in battle. It's a healing stone for Gemini, but also one for protection from negative energies. I felt it was best suited given everything that's ahead."
"Do you think Dumbledore's right, then? About the return of the Dark Lord?" he asked.
Draco's migraine had gotten to the point where he felt the need to vomit with the slightest of movement. He groaned his displeasure, forcing down the threat of rising bile as he rolled onto his side to curl into the fetal position.
Although, it was only the sirens (and Harry and Hermione) that were in on the know. Small miracles, and all that. He was grateful for their help, really, but they also didn't have much of a choice. Thanks to the prophecy, they'd bend over backwards for him (but only for things concerning the outcome of the war, they weren't about to serve him everything on a silver platter).
They dove under the surface a good fifty feet, in case there were any birds trying to catch a glimpse of where the wards for the Sirenum scopuli islands started. The islands' location now changed every three days, moving to a new corner of the world that had been decided only moments before the move, and there were patrols around the borderline 24/7. Death Eaters still managed to find them every few weeks, and the patrols were tasked with removing the threat before more of the sea rats could flock to them.
of Blaise Zabini. The world had not come to this. This was all ridiculous. Maybe he really was hallucinating, maybe this was all a farce. Maybe he was just caught in some weird potion-induced dream, and he'd wake up in the Hospital Wing and everything would go back to making sense. He did
Cassie smacked him with the paper, and he faux-kicked at her from his seat, trying to spill her precious bowl of oatmeal (he was not successful).
The cobra made no noise. It did not occupy the walls like his friends, instead opting for the stone floor, slithering with an eerie grace towards Draco. He was paralyzed, captivated by the creature. It stopped mere centimetres from his feet and the two stared at each other for what felt like hours. It was then, when Draco finally let his guard down, blind in the belief that perhaps the cobra was an ally, that it struck. Lunging fangs first towards his face, Draco recoiled with a scream from the anticipated agony that was about to befall him.
Harry did remember reading about something like that, now that he thought about it. There wasn't much research on it, seeing as very few wizards documented their companionship to sirens (and the majority of the reliable texts were written by sirens themselves, which were few and far between in the wizarding world).
"I'm sorry." Andrew sounded pissed. "But wizardkind isn't capable of anything when it comes to sirens except for making us drown in our own blood and fear for our lives. If this is really about Potter's stupid magical core, then we'd've been better off going straight to the Oracles for help."
Cass threw the nearest object (a vase) at the Oracle's head, and it missed him by a hairline as he ducked to avoid it. There was a rather significant hole indented on the wall in the vase's wake.
Dumbledore looked furious as Potter made his way towards the front of the hall. Good grief, the theatrics were already too much. How in Merlin's name was he supposed to make it through an entire tournament of this debauchery?
Umbridge did not come back after the incident. Dumbledore had informed them that the Ministry would 'deal with her' for her actions, but they all knew that meant a slap on the wrist (if that) and transferring her to a different role as though nothing had even happened.
His hands shook violently as he took the vial from Aegeus. Ezio would fall into an early grave if he knew what was happening.
It was late in the evening. Andrew had long gone to bed, so it was just Draco and Cassie sat in front of the fire. He had tried to convince her to go to sleep as well with no luck, she was determined for him to fall asleep first, no matter how unlikely that was.
The taste of blood from where Draco's fangs cut his lips was nondescript to the relief that flooded through his entire being. Draco was possessive in his methods as Harry melted like putty into his hands, more than fine to relent control.
The cruel she-devil had then blockaded their access to any living water as to prevent Her from washing the wounds away. She had known to wait long enough for the burns to settle, sink deep into the flesh as to ensure a scar would be left in its wake. There were some things that not even She could reverse. It was why there had been no hope for his mother's malady, no reversing the damage done to her siren form.
Draco must have a thing for stubborn hero-types, or the room had gone up a few too many degrees.
"Harry," Hermione warned, but he paid her little mind.
Andrew pulled his claws from where they were still lodged into Draco's shoulder, fingers curling around his palm as he cradled it to his chest. Draco barely even winced from the movement, eyes still dazed as they searched Harry's face for answers.
"That someone else is Cassie."
He found Cassie outside of the small villa, laying stones and twigs in a Xylomancy formation that he didn't recognize, and therefore couldn't tell you what it was that she was trying to predict. Draco had long given up on that form of Divination, it wasn't his strong suit and made him more frustrated than anything else, even after he had done it correctly and gotten a prediction in response.
"Sirens are very difficult to defeat in battle. They must be fought with your eyes closed and your ears covered, as there is no discovered way of resisting their Song. Much like the Imperius Curse, a siren can use their Song to control their victims, or even use their Song to inflict sudden death. Historically, no one was spared from their wrath, any witch or wizard who caused one even the slightest of inconveniences would die at the hands of the ocean, their bodies never recovered by their loved ones. It was for this reason, that the Ministry sought to put an end to their reign of terror. And, why, should you ever encounter one, report their existence immediately to governing authorities. Even the Dark Lord himself was said to fear their power."
"What if someone sees us? They'll recognize us for sure, and even if they don't, there'll be reports of sirens in the Black Lake."
"That's not possible. He makes Snape look like a giant teddy bear."
Cass relented, but the smile stayed on her face. "It's not like I have much else to work with, with that hollow head of yours."
dark about her."
"So." Snape straightened his back as he turned in Moody's direction once more. "Not only did you try to hex my daughter, but you did so because she was defending her ill cousin that you also attempted to hex."
There was a soft
The entrance into the Black Lake was charmed to only let sirens pass through either way, and on the outside took the appearance of a pipe like any other that led out of the castle. Severus had really outdone himself with the minor details.
When Harry laid eyes on Malfoy, he stumbled forward, stomping onto Parvati's foot. He was grateful, even as she kicked his shin, that everyone else had joined in on the dancing and that all eyes were no longer on them.
A weird itch in the back of his brain informed him that he wouldn't be dying anytime soon, and he groaned. The psychic bond between him and Cassie kept getting stronger, and with it meant he was picking up her knack for Divination. He already despised his Xylomancy lessons, but the unsolicited nudges from the universe
"She- She said, she would be right back, but then she was taking so long, so I went- She wasn't there, or anywhere, she just, where would she be? Then I looked, and found the note, and she's not there, Dray, she's not- She's not-"
"-I feel like I should tell you about my dreams..."
He bowed his head awkwardly at the mention of his name. Cassiopeia was thin like both him and his mother, yet loomed over them with an impressive height. She must have been at least 180 centimetres.
Draco still had no clue as to the whereabouts of the caster of the Imperius. Why target the Triwizard Tournament? What-
It was then that he met Cassie.
"Were you aware that veelas are distant relatives to sirens? While their beauty captures the attention of foolish men, it is incomparable to that of ours."
Draco couldn't withhold from flipping to his other side, ignoring the bile that burned his esophagus. "You think this is Harry's fault? Is that why he's been acting like he gutted me like a fish this whole damn time?"
Cass laughed, grabbing a potion off of the tray and motioning for Draco to lay his legs flat. As she applied the salve he could've cried in relief.
"Well, this past summer I spent some time with him and Cassie, and I sorta, kinda developed what some may classify as a crush, which in my opinion is a heavy-handed word-"
They were supposed to be studying for Herbology. Andrew and Cassie had gone out, citing they'd be out well past midnight, so Draco had the quarters to himself. Himself and all his spinning thoughts.
Oh, that was it. Drawing his wand, Harry took a defensive stance, Malfoy reacting just as quickly. He dodged Harry's first spell by ducking around the tree, Harry narrowly missing whatever hex was cast at him in retaliation. Before either could cast another spell, Professor Moody's voice boomed through the courtyard.
Mad-Eye (or, rather, Crouch Jr.) had made them learn about sirens in DADA last year. The term 'Nightingale' was not unfamiliar to him, but Harry had gone down a rabbit hole of research after this particular conversation.
the worst way to ever start a sentence.
No one answered him, although no one got the chance, as Snape immediately leapt for Moody's throat.
https://pin.it/3b7MbiX
Harry didn't typically speak up, but couldn't resist butting in, "does that mean Draco was a siren, too?"
TW (at end of chapter): descriptions of vomit, thoughts of self-loathing
Snape raised an eyebrow. "Have you considered that Mr. Malfoy did not, in fact, succumb to illness? There are many other proven ways for one's life to end."
"When individuals in hiding are on the move, you will find that said travels are held in the highest of secrecy, as to not endanger them any further."
"Hello new students," the pink lady greeted with the world's most sugary tone, "I'm Miss Dolores Umbridge, the appointed High Inquisitor of Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic. During your stay here I will be overseeing your education, but more importantly, getting to know you all. The Ministry is quite curious about sirens, you see, and I've been tasked with reporting my findings to the Minister himself. Now-"
"Andrew, you made it!" Cass exclaimed, and Draco wanted to die. Of course he hadn't been warned of his visit, what good would that have done him? Draco didn't need to mentally prepare himself for his summer crush suddenly appearing in a place he'd least expect, that would be absurd!
Bloody hell, Andrew wasn't just visiting, he was coming to live with them!
Cassie hummed to draw Draco's attention towards her. "Now, now, Draco, that's not how we treat our friends. Come here, let's get you a calming draught, hm?"
"I don't!" Harry shouted, flinching back at the volume of his response. Draco hadn't even blinked, although the color returned to his face.
Draco opened his eyes to darkness. His head was pounding, his entire body aching from where he'd fallen asleep on the stone cold floor. He sat up, his joints announcing their discontent at the action, and let his eyes adjust to the light.
Cassie applied more salve onto Margot's arm before wrapping it with seaweed. Looking at the burn, Draco could still feel the heat of the flame that had sprouted from Umbridge's wand. Could still hear the screams of agony that followed.
from the fire. The swift slide of parchment turning over. A knock at the door.
in the other.
Cassie took his hand in hers. "The tradition of gemstone offerings is to choose a stone that best reflects your relationship and what you want to get out of it. He presented the jasper to me as a proclamation that he wanted to improve as an individual. But that's just it, Dray. I didn't see any faults in him to begin with. He's not perfect, no one is, but his imperfections aren't a downside. They're the reason I fell in love with him to begin with."
He, on the other hand, remained planted where he was. No matter how unnerving it was to watch a Pureblood Lord drop any and all sense of decorum, it wouldn't help the situation if he, too, let his fears bubble to the surface.
If anything, he was grateful for Cassiopeia. Privately educated, his "cousin" had enrolled to transfer to Hogwarts to look out for him. His godfather must've pulled an endless amount of strings to get her into Hogwarts without raising too many questions into her past, but the American Ministry of Magic was thankfully quite lawless and disorganized, therefore making the transition much easier.
Draco laughed, letting himself fall so he could lay down. Cassie copied him, and they both turned their heads to look at each other.
He'd had to ask after her later.
"So sorry for the intrusion, but you three need to come with me."
Andrew nudged his arm with a closed fist, and Harry turned as best as he could in Draco's grip with a open palm to which Andrew deposited the black scale. It was devoid of blood, implying Andrew had rinsed it off, and Harry was silently grateful as he placed the small flake on his tongue. The water engulfing his lower half turned numbingly cold in a matter of milliseconds as his mouth tingled and burned as though he had scarfed down too much acidic fruit. It was over as soon as it started, and Harry removed the scale before he could accidentally swallow it out of nervousness.
Severus cleared his throat. "You will find, sir, that Mr. Malfoy and Miss Prince are joined at the hip, whether you like it or not."
"Draco, Cassiopeia, you have been summoned by Elder Ezio."
"I know you're up to something, alright? You've been avoiding me and acting suspicious, and-"
"You're lucky the merpeople claimed to have been the ones to free Gabrielle when they saw no one was coming to rescue her, but that meant there was no viable explanation to give him regarding the grindylow! Dumbledore had to lie on the spot to the Ministry judges to throw them off your scent! After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me? By not only endangering yourself, but your friends, my daughter?"
He leaned his head against hers, fighting the heaviness of his eyelids. "You know, what a stupid design. Any other siren, no problem! But let's make Nightingales have this absurd weakness since their magic is regulated by the phases of the moon."
"Dad, we both know I'm going to be the most dangerous thing in that maze." Cassie's voice was a bit muffled from her face being smothered by her father's robes.
"Sucks that it found you anyways."
Harry was terrified.
He paused at the figure huddled in the corner.
There was a knock on the door, signalling the end of their conversation. Andrew answered it, and let out a small gasp of surprise. Spinning around in his seat, Draco paled at the sight.
Snape squinted at her for a brief moment, before sighing in defeat. "I believe you will find that come tomorrow morning, Hogwarts will become home to many more magical beings than there are today."
"It's time," she told them, and Draco crammed in a few more bites downed by a splash of tea before pulling the hood up over his face. Cassie was more of a sloth in her movements, taking her time to straighten her robes upon standing, a picture of elegance. Draco wasn't going to lie, he had been bubbling with a mix of both nerves and excitement for the past few days.
The cup rattled against the stone ground as the water within it bubbled and boiled. Scalding hot droplets erupted, landing on his hands, arms, face. He grit his teeth at the prickles of pain--they were only temporary, healing before the burn could take hold--held out as the rattling grew faster, droplets turning into what felt like spews of molten lava.
"Wait, when I asked if you knew he was the one, you talked about his offering. If you already knew you loved him, wouldn't that not matter?"
Draco had to hold in a snort of amusement. "She does bring up some interesting points."
"In the case of human-siren bonds, the established way of linking two cores is by removing one of the siren's scales and creating an incision near the clavicle to mimic the wound typically created using teeth or claws in siren-siren pairs. The removed scale is then placed in the human's mouth, as it's a place where the pair's bodily fluids have already familiarized themselves with each other-"
"Draco, don't move!" she yelled back at him. She sounded more irritated than panicked, which allowed him to relax his shoulders and take a deep breath. Although he had improved his Divination thanks to their shared psychic bond, her having confidence in her next actions was much more reliable in predicting the outcome.
Andrew leaned back in his seat, shoulders slumping as the ire drained from his body. Defeated. As though he had considered the exact same thing. He had yet to face Draco to his right, and wished desperately for the growing silence to end. Building himself up, he braved turning to his side.
"I'm sorry my inaction has made you feel so strongly, Severus. But, I assure you I understand the importance of her life and the role she will play in Voldemort's defeat."
"He's feeling claustrophobic, the last thing you want to do is crowd him," Andrew advised.
"Seriously, if there's an age requirement, how can they let Potter participate? Bitch, haven't they read Shakespeare? '
God, Harry was going to hate him. If he found out this all could've been avoided, if it hadn't been for Draco's cowardice in confronting his feelings.
They were both stunning. This wasn't news, especially not to him, as the guy--what was his name? Alex?--had been the reason for Harry walking straight into a pillar upon his arrival to Hogwarts.
"If you are ever on the run, get to the sea," Corey had advised him on one such occasion. "She will always protect you, no matter what."
He would get his revenge for that snide comment some other time. "What have I done to garner his attention this time?"
They held wrists as he initiated the Aquaparition, the water overcoming them both before crashing down and away from them. In the near distance, Malfoy Manor welcomed them back home.
"You can, uh, call me Harry, if you'd like."
Draco stood in the wine cellars of Malfoy Mansion. It was dimly lit, but he'd recognize it anywhere. He turned slowly on his heel as he took in the room he didn't anticipate ever seeing again.
"Right. Thank you. It won't happen again."
"THE WHAT?!" both adults screeched.
Because Harry may leave, but Draco can do everything in his power to avoid speeding that process up.
It had all been much more amicable than he could have anticipated. It might have been better if Corey was pissed at him, or at least a bit more expressive in his reaction! But, to tell Draco that he basically had already noticed and wanted to wait until Draco was able to see it for himself? What kind of person bloody does that? How dare he frame himself as the bigger person!
It hadn't been that long ago, in this very room, that he had danced and laughed and looked so vibrantly alive. He had looked fine. Hadn't he been fine? He couldn't remember the last interaction he had with the blond. He'd seen him, before the Second Task, sat with his cousin at breakfast. Draco had looked tired, certainly, but he was still up and about.
If you asked, Harry would not be able to recall how they ended up snogging against the wall. Again, thoughts-before-action, not his forte. All he knew for certain was that kissing Draco was nice in how it made his blood rush with excitement, like the way it did when he took a dive on his broom going after the snitch. Of all the darkness in his life, it was all drowned out with how happy he felt in moments like these.
Oh, the melodrama. "Cor, you couldn't even get
Corey had gone over to Snape's desk, but the professor himself was nowhere to be seen. If they had been waiting up on Draco, perhaps the man had made a run for it, given the opportunity to flee.
The three looked at each other in a panic as they tried to gather a feasible excuse.
He felt helpless as he soaked her robes with snot and tears. As she rocked him gently, shushed his cries and whispered empty assurances into his ear.
Draco tilted his head back, blinking away tears with a stubborn grimace. He wished Cassie were here, if only because she would understand how he was feeling without him having to put words to it. It wasn't that he didn't love Harry. To try and deny that was a lost cause. It was the burden of binding Harry to him, forcing him into an obligation that'd only endanger him further.
"I feel like we should be using a stronger word than 'off,' Severus. I'd say he's a completely different person, based off of what Draco's told me."
"Potter, does he fucking look alright to you?" Corey snapped.
Cassie scoffed, "yeah, just like how She was the one to tell you to have us poison ourselves, makes a whole lot of sense."
"The Moonbeam in France-" Cassie said, her voice catching. "They found her like the Moonbeam in France was found."
"And, Granger? I can see you two getting along just fine, and I'm sure her company wouldn't be
"A miracle he finds his way out of bed in the morning," Cassie said under her breath, only loud enough for the two Malfoys to pick up on.
He bid her goodnight as well before rushing back into the dorm. Corey had returned to his bed and seemed to be fast asleep, while Andrew and Snape sat perched at the foot of the bed, one on each side of a shell-shocked Draco. An empty vial of Dreamless Drought sat on the nightstand, explaining the way Draco's eyelids drooped every few seconds.
"Harry?"
Andrew didn't answer right away. Draco forced his eyes open, the tears welling in them not daring to fall. He willed them down, he would breakdown about this in private, not now. Not in front of Dumbledore and Snape and all the portraits that were asleep but could very likely be eavesdropping anyways.
but it's aight because I kept saying I wanted to learn a third language fluently and now I'm being held accountable and actually learning one so???
He blinked, and they were now in the dungeons. Someone was still following them. Draco needed to vomit. How could She let this happen? They had found two sirens off the coasts, they had died in Her realm! She was supposed to keep them safe!
"I bumped into it with my tail and it tried to attack me, I wasn't planning on eating it," he explained.
Cassie shrugged. "That kind of chaos is too controlled. Practically predictable. Where's the fun in that?"
"I wanted you three to hear it from me, before you read it in the papers tomorrow," the headmaster started, looking down at the letter like it was a dark artifact.
Cassie had remained uncharacteristically quiet. Draco looked to her now for her input, but was shocked to see a blank expression staring right back at him. Why were they
It was then that he noticed that Snape looked paler than usual. Even Dumbledore lacked that ever-present twinkle in his eye, his shoulders slumped as he turned over a letter in his hands.
Both males regretted the question at the Cheshire grin Cassie made, her eyes devilish as she made eye-contact with her mate. Thankfully, they'd never know what she was about to say, as the door swung open in time to settle the mood.
Toad leapt at the bait. "Your language about having a 'mate,'" Umbridge spat the word, "I will not have such nonsense spewed in this classroom."
Cassie took the last bite of her pie, still chewing as she spoke. "Dray, Corey really isn't that hung up, and he's told you this himself. I don't understand why you're even here. Go find Potter and snog in an empty classroom or something."
The same merperson shook their head in disdain. Likely the leader, then. "I will have to make up a lie for the judges to explain what has happened, if the boy has not blabbered to them already."
Draco groaned. "Can we seriously not catch a break, here? We've already done him a favor by exposing Mad-Eye as an irredeemable psycho."
He elbowed her ribs, and the Hufflepuff on her other side lightly glared as they were shoved to the side as Cass tried to evade the assault. None of the badgers dared say anything, however, as the one bracing herself to speak up was cut off by Cassie's head snapping to look at her.
Cass smiled at his eagerness. "Am I going to teach you how to put the fear of Merlin deep into the very bones of random strangers, compelling them into a mute silence?" She mockingly scratched at her chin. "I don't know, such a nefarious act seems very out of character for me."
The summer before his fourth year had been Draco's favorite summer by far.
Corey shoved his plate of food away from him. Andrew slumped onto the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
As the girl's eyes watered, the rest of the carriage fell silent. Once they arrived at the castle and separated from the group, Draco was quick to cut to the chase.
Draco wasn't entirely certain where they were. It wasn't the cellars, like before, and the darkness around them held a certain warmth to it.
He'd been so obsessed over Draco as a siren, he'd nearly forgotten! It had all felt like a dream, or at least some very corporeal hallucination, one that was too blurry in his recollection to make any sort of understanding out of the complex series of events.
Maybe it wasn't a prank. Perhaps someone slipped something into Draco's pumpkin juice.
He shook his head. "I think, um, that I like Draco Malfoy."
Draco was rattled as a shoulder roughly bumped his, his godfather rushing to his daughter's side. He looked behind him to find the room cleared, only a few sirens lingering here and there as they talked to Professors Flitwick and McGonagall, both Dumbledore and Umbridge nowhere to be seen.
"Pinky promise," he repeated weakly.
Ron groaned, not needing to verbalize his 'not this again' for his message to come across. Hermione somehow hadn't reached that point yet, but still seemed on the verge of exasperation.
"I-, um, thank you, Malfoy. I would have never expected to receive any sort of apology from you. Not that it isn't nice to hear! It's just, a bit out of character for you. Is it true then, your illness? Is it really that bad?"
Andrew held out a crinkled piece of parchment, charmed waterproof by the looks of it. Draco took it from him like it was a delicate piece of china, folding it out carefully as he recognized his cousin's careful script. Harry shifted to read over his shoulder, and Draco angled it so he could see it better.
"I was not taunting him!" Potter leapt to defend his honor. "I was confronting him-"
Andrew and Cassie, now that they were unafraid of triggering jealously in him, were showing off.
It wasn't a consideration. Draco was long past weighing his options. He was already in the thick of it, and could only ponder which path his life would go down.
There had been debate over whether or not the prophecy had turned him into a martyr. This was all the confirmation he needed.
Now, he supposed, he was more than capable to take her out himself. He was 15 now, and a fully mature siren at that. He had perfected the use of his Song during his time on the Islands, meaning he no longer needed help from others in fighting his battles.
"You're insufferable," he said, refusing to face her as her footsteps made their way towards the door. Had there been any witnesses, one could say Severus Snape began to cry as the door closed with the tiniest of clicks. However, the room was empty with the sole exception of one Professor, and he'd tell you he spent the morning alone revising lesson plans.
The older siren nodded frantically.
"Your first summer with the pod," she answered with zero hesitation. "You remember when you first used your Song?"
"Because, he's operating under the impression that I sent her to him, which gives an advantage. He thinks I can control her, so he won't need to manipulate anyone. He'll simply ask and expect it to get done."
"Have you even informed his parents? Requested a specialist from St. Mungo's clear him before trying to drag him into this?! I'm sure the
Umbridge scoffed, "Certainly more than any qualifications you may have."
His cheeks burned and he ducked his head, not capable of forming words coherently. Andrew stood and ambled toward them, giving the Headmaster a warning glance. He kept his voice low as he spoke next, although the Hall had seemingly emptied out since it had all started to go down.
"Is this because he's human? I know this is scary, Dray-" Corey's sentence fell off at the sound at a twig snapping from behind.
"It's alright, Draco," Hermione reassured. The snarling stopped.
Cassiopeia sipped her tea, not taking her eyes off of Severus as she did so. "He doesn't know, and I wasn't planning on telling him. Narcissa already made me to swear not to."
Andrew mumbled, "a bit late now, pops, 'cause I don't think Draco will let him walk away unscathed at this point."
"What's the point in plotting a fake death if you want to throw it out the window after a few months?" Cassie argued.
He turned to Andrew for confirmation, who stared blankly in response. A yes, then. He pointed at the kook. "And him knowing about our suspicions about Moody?"
"Andrew, wait-" he tried to protest, and all he got was an amused laugh in return.
The dream came back to him in pieces, yet also all at once. He reeled back from the sting of it. It hadn't been a dream. It wasn't a dream.
Ugh, not pity. Did she really think that he'd have to be on his actual deathbed to apologize to her?
"Shh, I'm here," Andrew had awkwardly sat up, Cassie still straddling his legs. She stopped muttering, a glazed over look to her eyes as he wrapped his arms around her, tucking her head under his chin as he hummed a low Song.
It was spoken so softly, Draco almost hadn't heard. "Professor?"
TW: couple F-bombs, other swearing
Their class time in their common room was akin to a dictatorship. He longed for their lunch break to begin already. All he had left to complete was his practical work, and he couldn't do that until later when McGonagall came by to evaluate them anyways. So, he sat, pretending to read a chapter of his transfiguration book, aimlessly flipping the page after an undetermined interval of time. On occasion, just to spice things up, he'd flip back to the previous page as if he needed to reread for better comprehension.
Andrew huffed. "Sacrificing yourself isn't an option, Severus. If I sit back and do nothing and you die, Cassie will never forgive me."
"Enough," Snape snapped. "You need to stay here and protect Draco. He's going to send someone to figure him out, and you and Corey need to be prepared to throw them off his scent. Lie if you have to, but think of the bigger picture. What would She want you to do? Hmm? Why don't you go ask Her about Her damned prophecy and if she has any useful insight? Isn't She supposed to protect you? Go ask her how the bloody hell she let this happen."
Krum blinked in confusion, and that was when Draco saw Potter and Diggory arguing next to the Triwizard Cup. The hedge walls began to shift, cutting Krum off, and Draco yanked on Cassie's sleeve to pull her towards the two Hogwarts Champions. Krum would be safe now. Hopefully.
Diggory advanced forward, getting closer and closer to the Cup, when a curse struck him while his back was turned. Diggory let out an agonized scream that made Draco jump back in fright until he laid eyes on the caster of the Cruciatus Curse. Krum?
Draco looked up, mustering the strongest possible glare he was capable of. "Piss off, Andrew."
He looked at the modest cabin surrounded by sea cliffs and towering pines and wondered how soon he could go back to the Malfoy estate. He already knew he'd have to leave behind his wand, but this was a
He was about ready to bash some logic into that thick skull. "Yes, they pair up on instinct, but it's because it strengthens their vulnerabilities. Did you not pay attention in first-year health at all? They're the only type of siren to abstain from solo or pack hunting, and they're drawn to each other to balance out their weaknesses. Cassie is a seer, and..." He waved his hand at Corey, prompting him to finish the sentence.
Cassie clicked her tongue at him.
The Triwizard Tournament had honestly not proved much of a distraction. He was not about to let his guard down and risk his tail because of some stupid Goblet. He couldn't even enter his own name in, not that he wanted to. He'd rather have a potion blow up in his face in front of the entire Gryffindor house than endanger his life with a pointless suicide mission.
"Yeah, bad dream 's all," he grumbled, pulling his blanket tighter around himself.
The next thing he remembered was watching Cassie and Andrew start stuffing the bodies in the trunk of the car. The one that Cassie had knocked out was starting to come to, and she punted his head to keep him down and out. Draco was guided to the car, his whole body tingling and numb and everything felt like it was happening to someone else.
It was Draco's turn to snort. "We're not Gryffindors, we actually have a sense of self-preservation, thank you very much."
He should've shoved her off the couch when he had the chance. "You really want to watch this whole place burn? Is there not enough chaos already with the Triwizard Tournament?"
Cassie was uncharacteristically subdued. Aegeus had ordered she be dosed with a potion before the meeting, and Draco wanted to carve the proud smirk off of his face when the potion took effect. He'd likely have to get in line, however, with the murderous intent that was clear in Andrew's eyes. Damn Andrew, only he could make bloodthirst look attractive.
Everything after happened in slow motion. Cassie threw herself across the tabletop, her fist clutching Andrew's robes like a lifeline as she tried to pull him out of the line of fire. As Andrew collapsed to the floor, she rolled right after him, scrambling to kneel over him as he heaved and gasped. Draco felt heavier than stone.
"The Goblet, I know you had something to do with it!"
In the small Washington towns they frequented, many mistook them for siblings. They never corrected the passing comments from waitresses and cashiers, not needing to draw any more attention to themselves than they already had.
Quickly shaking his head was his first instinct. It did nothing to get him out of the conversation he was quickly getting drawn into. Even Draco had paused from obediently cleaning his plate to look over in curiosity.
From the neck down they were all scales and sharp fins. If the moon weren't full and directly hitting the water, Harry wouldn't be able to recognize the shape of Draco with how he blended in.
She snorted as if he were telling a joke. Upon turning to him and realizing he wasn't, she frowned.
At the center of the village, four people hung suspended in the water, chained down to a stone statue. He recognized Hermione first, then Cho Chang and Weasley. The younger blonde held an unmistakable likeness to Delacour, likely her younger sister.
Dumbledore smirked, and Harry wanted to punch him, but knew that Andrew would be first in line followed by everyone else in the room.
to do this during a full moon."
Cassie jut out her chin. "I was not aware that was a rule in the student code of conduct."
"St. Achelous is the name of the island, but St. Achelous' Academy for Magical Arts is located on it. Beside the school is a small town full of shops where you can purchase anything you might need--quills, ingredients, new robes--but there's also the Bank of Aquarius. It's full of collections of water from all over the globe, and you're able to get what you need from them for free."
"Yes." She tilted her head, analyzing him. He probably seemed like he was having a stroke.
There were private dormitories for each of them--with the exception of Cassie and Andrew who shared one--simple rooms with a bed and a desk connected to a private bath. Like last year, there was a pool in the bath, appearing bottomless at first glance. Hopefully with an entrance leading to the lake.
One of Cassie's hands came to rest on Draco's shoulder. Honestly, having two mama bears ready to do all the heavy-lifting for him? This was living the life. Despite what onlookers may say, Draco despised confrontation.
He was a tad bit surprised that it was Potter, who likely was unsuccessful in his attempt to drown himself. Upon closer inspection, it appeared he had used gillyweed to get him through the task. Wonder where he acquired that, especially when the bubblehead charm would've been much easier in all aspects.
"And, how, exactly, is that a potion ingredient?"
Severus didn't try to hide the pained look from his face any longer. He never thought he'd admit it, but he was eternally grateful for Andrew's existence at the moment and the nightmare he'd spared his daughter from.
In all honesty, not even Draco was aware of the answer to that. Why had he done that? He may as well have undone the cloaking spell at that point, since he was apparently hellbent on exposing himself after all.
blessing that was a teenage daughter.
His own father had betrayed him. For what?
Looking at him now, Ron's words echoing inside his head, clashing against Vernon's overbearing screaming.
And, no matter how much he may have disliked Andrew at first, the darn boy had grown on him. He'd never admit it, but it was the closest he'd felt to having a son of his own. Excluding his ungrateful godson, of course, because the little brat would've been disowned at least twice had he been really his. That aside, if anything happened to either of them,
Severus stood slowly, walking to the door like he was stepping around broken glass. Yet Draco's eyes never left his cousin's and the look of pity that they held. She knew he hated pity from others' and she wasn't even attempting to hide it.
