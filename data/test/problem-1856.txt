“I figured you were rather pleased with the view when I caught you staring,” Draco said with a small snort. “you weren’t very subtle, Potter.”
"Don't ever try to get inside my head again" Harry said, in a dangerously low voice and pushed him against the rough bark. He stared into the grey eyes, and his tone softened. "It's too dark for you."
Harry smiled in that dopey way Ron always calls him out for, complaining he looks lovesick, "Oh do you now, baby."
“It’s not. Not in those jeans” Draco said with a smirk. Harry turned faintly pink. “Didn’t think your cheeks could get any brighter with the cold in here.”
He wasn’t with Ron and Hermione. He was in Otryazan with Draco Malfoy. Was Draco a friend? Could he forget the six years of animosity? He had considered it once or twice. Yet, he wasn’t certain. Could he trust Draco?
“Oh for heaven’s sake –” A small frown creased Draco’s forehead, while he stared at Harry in disbelief. “Isn’t it,” he pinched the bridge of his nose, “isn’t it obvious, you prat?”
“Malfoy, I’ve seen it.” He said softly, the emerald green eyes peering into his own grey ones. “We’re linked in a way – Voldemort and I – And I accessed his mind without intending to.”
“Set you on fire in your sleep?” He asked, a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. “No promises.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, staring at the silver smoke, slightly brighter which was slightly brighter than before. “what are you thinking about while casting the Patronus?”
“Not father,” Malfoy said with a pained mien, which vanished within a brief minute. “A Patronus will protect you. Save you – it won’t –” He paused. “It won’t be related to father.”
“Yeah.” Draco said as he sighed softly, brushing a strand of hair out of his face. “Reality is a bit harsh.”
“I’d rather not,” He placed the cup on the edge of the bed, one finger on the base. It had a faint throb. A second heartbeat. “the prophet writes enough articles about the chosen one and I’d rather not add on to it.”
Malfoy was an amusing mix of confusion with a hint of rage and a small uncertain smile on his lips. “Go on then, I want to hear it. It’ll be easier to decide if I want to laugh or kill you.”
"You could say it isn't the first time I've considered it, so no, actually, I've been considering for a while now and have finally decided to change my mind." Merlin, the earnestness and pure regret and guilt that shone through those emerald eyes was impossible to look at.
Harry curled his fingers around the artifact and whispered a charm, forcing it to wear out. The artifact quivered underneath his fingertips. It was warmer. Twitching. The charm wore out. He placed it on the kitchen counter.
The night-sky was quiet. Peaceful. It wasn’t as chaotic as the sky of his fancy. He couldn’t find the star he was searching. Perhaps he didn’t want to. He could vaguely recall the exact location of the star.
“I can’t… Gin, I’m sorry if I offended or upset you,” he stood up and grabbed his shirt, throwing it over his shoulders. “I promise I’ll make more of an effort.”
“I suppose you could say that,” Draco looked potter directly in the eyes. “Why are you so quick to believe that I did
He’s spent most of the day trailing around Hyde Park. He’d never admit it to Ginny but he couldn’t stand to be alone more than necessary in that house. It was only when it started to get dark and the tourists all started dispersing to go to their scheduled dinners that he went back to the house.
“What were you thinking? Sometimes I swear you’ve got a death wish Draco,” She spat across the cotton sheets pacing back and forth at the end of his bed.
He tripped straight up the stone steps, his robes had wrapped themselves around his foot and his knee collided with the edge of the step. It was definitely going to bruise. But this wasn’t where the issue lied, he could have quite happily stood up and carried on with his life if it weren't for Harry bloody Potter.
“Well, explain it to me then!” Ginny quickly stood up, placing herself strategically between Harry and the exit.
In the following fifteen minutes, Draco kept replaying Pomfrey’s rushed words through his head. Each sentence opening his mind to a truly disastrous outcome. However, he was pulled from his internal debate when he felt all the heat seep out of his body and the gentle tingle on his hand stop.
“Uh, yeah… I don’t know what’s wrong with you but he told me what happened and I think it would be best if you get Parkinson and leave us all alone.” Her eyes were foggy and the words had a slight slur to them, she looked disgusted and uncomfortable to be in Draco’s presence.
McGonagall burst into the corridor, her greying hair loose over her panic-stricken face. “-Where is he?! Potter?!”
Empty emerald armchairs were scattered around the dark room and a crisp sound of flames flickering from the fireplace filled Draco’s ears. He kept his head bowed and limped forwards to the dormitories, letting his fringe fall in his face. Every step he took, his worn Italian oxfords scuffed the surface of the plush carpet.
“The party,” he whispered to himself before locking eyes with a distressed-looking Draco, “that’s why I was looking for you because what happened at the party.”
Everything went quiet, Draco’s shoulders going up and down with every breath. Pansy just stared at the boy, her mouth slightly ajar, eyes watering and breathing heavily.
Red trail marks burnt down his face from the tears and his chest was harshly pulsing as he stared at the woman perched on the side of his bed.
McGonagall tilted her head slightly, a silver ringlet slipping out of her bun. “Malfoy what are you trying to do here?
- even if those were the spell that won them the war! Worst of all, if he felt like anything fishy was occurring the staff and Order would straight away put him down telling him just to focus on his studies. He was expected to just be a normal seventeen year old wizard but carry the burden of being ‘the chosen one’.
“You must leave now Potter! You, of all people, cannot be here,” she barked waving him away quickly.
Biting down hard on his tongue, he forced his side into the oversized door, throwing all of his feeble weight into the motion to enter the wing. The door fell open with him landing on the stone tiles in a fit of panic. The rough edges of stone lying under his fingers. He knew it should feel freezing to the touch but alas he felt nothing. Unable to find the strength to stand, he allowed defeat to wash over him, the pain too much.
He sucked in his dry lips his head still shaking, she placed a warm palm on his clothed knee, making sure not to press too hard.
“I-I don’t know,” she stuttered holding back her tears. “No! No, I won’t let it happen. We’re going to find your mate, you’re going to to be okay Draco.”
He didn’t understand. All his body felt was muted pain and an overwhelming amount of warmth. After the past week, he should be dead. He’d done the reading; he knew the facts. He was an abysmal and unwanted veela, he was supposed to be dead.
“Look Draco,” her voice softer, more careful. “I can’t begin to understand how it must have felt to have such a…
Harry groaned inwardly, as he recalled the events of the manor. He would’ve been dead if Lucius Malfoy hadn’t sent him here. Yet, the question remained: Why was he here?
It shot up in the air and dropped down, and he felt a surge of magic go through him. He had levitated it, but he had minimal control over the spell. He hadn’t controlled the intensity of the magic.
It was a rather poor imitation of the eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy, yet it was sort of comical, “no need to ask yours – blond hair and posh robes,” The corner of his mouth twitched and curved into a small smile. “you must be a Malfoy.”
The blond arched an eyebrow at him, the corner of his lip curling into a derisive sneer. “Refrain from providing the pointless retorts once we start practicing, Potter – silence your fucking ego.”
“Draco –” He had to bite down on a retort while the dull ache in his chest turned into a searing throb. “It was cruel and for the fifth time, I’m sorry,” He winced at the venom in the tone, cleared his throat and continued, “Yet, you said I had one last chance and I shouldn’t screw it up,” A beat. “That I was forgiven.”
“Good.” He forced out, falling back on his heel, turning his head to the side, eyes fixed on the mantelpiece, while he whispered, “I don’t care about you.”
In retrospect, he should’ve been a bit calmer. Sadly, it wasn’t his forte around Draco Malfoy. Fate was cruel. He would’ve tolerated Gollum – an evil, little hobbit with a ring fetish – He could not tolerate a full tilt diva with a skincare routine or – Oh, forget it.
He realized, after a moment of thinking, this his anger was directed at his father. Not Potter. Potter didn’t want to be in Otryazan. He had never asked to be here.
“I was – I didn’t care if you were the chosen one,” Malfoy whispered, he fidgeted ever so slightly, losing some of his carefully maintained Malfoy composure. The fidgeting also made him accidentally brush up against Harry and he pulled away as quick as the touch lasted. Not quick enough for Harry to not feel a flutter, though.  A lingering warmth. “I wanted one little win, Potter. Only one.”
A blur of blond hair, silver eyes and the falling stars flashed in his mind, and he didn’t force it out and the intense pain in his head worsened.
–” He could detect a hint of sarcasm in the tone. “if you want to sort out a fight with Harry Potter, you must remain subtle, instead of a –”
He didn’t understand his father. Why would he send Harry Potter to Otryazan and risk his own life? To break the unbreakable vow, was to invite your own death. Why would he risk it, if he knew?
He fished out the pocket-watch. It was warmer, and emitting that familiar dark feeling, pulsing with raw magic.
Harry couldn’t resist a small smile. “Wicked witch of the west instead of The Dark Lord – Merlin, who are you and what did you do with Draco I despise references Malfoy?”
“Yes, your royal highness.” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl, “wait, right, no quips,” he forced on a serious mien on the face. “I’m sorry, continue.”
He poured the tea into the cup and with a faint smile, he walked into the bedroom. “Here, Potter. You should get some rest. It’s your third cup of tea.”
With the corner of his eye, he saw a blur of blond hair as Malfoy closed the door. He directed his magic at the cup, and it mended itself.
“No, we’re in a show where the protagonist is stranded on a severed Island with a rival of seven years – Draco Malfoy – who can’t correct the stance,” Draco wanted to punch the smirk off Potter’s face. “a fantastic show.”
He wanted to say it in a nonthreatening, offhanded way, only to dissolve the tension hanging in the air, but it sounded a little accusatory.
“Oh.” Harry couldn’t decide the next words. Plus, he didn’t want to screw up a civil conversation and turn it into a fight. “Right, it’s obvious.”
which refrains from sarcasm,” One corner of Draco’s mouth curved into a small smirk. “you can’t censor your sarcasm, Potter.”
He picked the can of whipped cream, and gave it a slight shake. And a spurt of cream landed on Harry’s face and he cursed. Malfoy stared at him, and a laugh escaped his parted lips.
The second note, was written in an untidy scrawl. He exhaled slowly, as realization dawned on him. He had written the note. He had written a note on Third December, 1996 and he couldn’t recall writing one.
"I can’t explain,” Lucius said, the panic evident in his voice and whipped his wand through the air. Harry leapt to the side and rolled, narrowly avoiding the spell.
The watch wasn’t warm against his palm now, and the dark feeling had reduced a bit. Only a bit. It was a fucking menace. He placed it back in the pocket and sighed softly, as he carded his fingers through his hair.
Harry pursed his lips and directed a pointed glare at Malfoy. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t resist a clever sardonic remark: “Oh, well – must your stance be off every single time?”
The amusement was dancing in Potter’s eyes gave way to an all-too familiar smirk on his face as he said, "Never said you were, Malfoy.”
The blond was chewing on his bottom him while frowning at the counter. He was tense and unsure, yet with the similar uncertain voice he said, “I saved
“Yes, I might’ve,” Draco said with a small frown, “Perhaps, in a moment of weakness, it occurs once in a while” He turned his head to the side, “what’s your point?”
“You let the death eaters into the castle, Malfoy.” Harry grimaced, his mind tracing back to the Astronomy tower. The night he had retrieved the fake locket with Dumbledore. “You couldn’t kill him. You were lowering your wand.”
“Yeah, sure,” The blond fixed him with a cold stare, yet it was sort of unfocused. Nervous. An uneven breath stuttered out of Draco’s mouth, “your sense of humour –” He clutched the corner of the counter in a rather firm grip while he lifted the other hand to wipe the beads of sweat which had started to form on his forehead, “is awful,” He had a slight quiver to his voice, “now, can you not with the quips –” He flinched at the momentary flicker of lights in the kitchen, “otherwise I’ll light you on fire."
A warm breeze brushed across his face, and he exhaled softly. He wasn’t supposed to be here. He had to destroy the horcruxes. And defeat Voldemort.
It was a subtle ‘thank you’. Or a ‘fuck you’. He couldn’t decide. With Malfoy, he could never decide. He poured more batter into the pan and rest his gaze on Malfoy. “Do you want to flip a crepe?”
Malfoy searched the kitchen, and he cursed when he didn’t find a note. It was sort of amusing. Not that the intention was to amuse himself, but it was an added bonus. And a tiny victory.
Harry could vaguely imagine Narcissa reading to Draco at night, when he was eleven, probably stroking the blond hair fondly as she recited it. He didn’t comment on it and instead, he remained silent.
“If it was plain atrocious,” He quoted, with a smirk on the corner of his mouth as he imitated the blond. It was rather amusing to watch the brief irritation flicker across his face, and the hint of a smile. “why are you smiling?”
Harry, however, had no desire to cast a glance around. Instead, he focused on Draco. On the silver eyes, the softest smile which graced his lips and the light of the stars above dancing on his pale skin.
“I figured,” Potter whispered with a slight quiver to the voice, “yes, the cup is a dark artefact and it was screwing with my emotional compass which caused the small outburst that unfortunately, involved an insensitive choice of words.”
It wasn't the easiest of tasks trying to mask his still very present hurt from Potter's earlier words with his usual bouts of sarcasm. But Draco Malfoy was nothing if not obstinate.
“I’m not open to criticism,” Harry refuted in a serious voice, yet he had a faint outline of a smile, which indicated it was an act. “I’m open to
“Good! What I was saying is, there is this social event next Friday that Ravenclaw are hosting, I think it is to do with bringing all of the houses closer together after the war really. But anyway, I have told Luna that we would go, you know how disappointed she would get if we didn’t turn up! However, I am unsure of what to do now with the whole ‘Ron’ thing! I mean we kissed that one time, but emotions were heightened and he has never mentioned it again! What if he has forgotten and-”
“-Hey Luna.” A velvety voice waltzed down the corridor, those two words leaving Draco’s core vibrating. He didn’t need to look up to know why he had suddenly started perspiring.
A slender pale hand reached out to his bicep harmfully rubbing carefully, “Harry I need to know for my peace of mind.”
She lifted her gaze to look at the red-faced man. His hair straggly, more unruly than normal. Dark purple blemishes embossed under his eyes and a light sheen of sweat dressing his olive skin.
“What are you?” Draco swallowed deeply, unsure that his planned lie to Potter would work now. “Malfoy? What the hell is going on, why are aurors guarding you? Why are you making weird noises?”
From his new angle, he was aware he was the only person occupying the ward, at least sometimes he gets lucky. Last time there had been a third year in with a mild case of dragon pox and Draco had to be charmed so he was unrecognisable.
It had taken around 40 minutes to apply all of the glamours to his body, it had actually made them incredibly late but that was fine in Draco’s opinion. Pansy had assured him she knew what she was doing and let her wand loose. There was nothing more self-deprecating than looking at yourself in the mirror while somebody tries to perfect you. She made him gain some much-needed weight, especially in the bum as she said
“What on earth are you talking about?” Draco frowned, he attempted to sit up further without vomiting.
“Potter, I have no interest in what my of-age eighth years get up to on a Saturday night,” her lips quipped upwards. “Especially when there are more pressing matters at hand.”
With his Map at the ready, Harry opened the door, listening out for any sounds before closing it behind him, the occupied sign changing to unoccupied.
Moisture began seeping out of Draco's hole, slicking Harry's hand and staining the chaise beneath them. Harry removed his hand from Draco with a wet pop and felt the muscles in Draco's legs tense against him. He placed a hand on his dick beginning to guide it towards Draco's entrance.
"I don't care, just shut up." Harry argued through clenched teeth, grabbing ahold of Draco's chin and roughly kissing him, his other hand now working at Draco's belt. He didn't care about what he was doing, he just wanted to feel good, to stop the torment running rapid in his head, no matter if it hurt Draco. However, Draco was fighting against him now, using the same force Harry was to stop him prodding his body.
"So sorry to have kept you waiting, your Highness, but I almost got caught at the last minute. I'm lucky I even made it in here." Harry responded, sarcasm also present in his voice, mimicking Draco.
"Harry, I told you to stop!" He managed to hold Harry's arms away from his lower half, glaring down at him when he fought back. "Harry! Stop!"
The Fat Lady sighed, glaring at him before asking for the password, which harry gave correctly, and opened up the portrait. Harry stepped through the hole catching snipits of the Fat Lady's mumblings under her breath.
He unbuckled his belt followed by his trousers and pushed them down, pooling around his ankles. He tugged at the hem of his boxers and slid them down joining the clothing at his feet.
Their chests heaved: sweat glistening on their bodies as they greedily gulped at the air, demanding oxygen. Heat burned their skin as the blood rushed through them, hearts pumping twice as fast than usual.
Harry observed it before reaching his hand out and grasping the shaft, gliding his fingers along it. Draco's breath hitched, his body lightly trembling at each touch. Harry wrapped his palm around the length and held it in place as he lowered his lips against the tip. A gasp escaped from Draco as he kissed the swollen head, swirling his tounge over it.
Harry removed his fingers, guiding his cock towards Draco's ass. His tip prodded at the hole, pushing in slightly at a time. Both boys moaned as Harry pushed in deeper, his hips grinding in Draco's. He stilled for a moment, his jaw clenching as he slowly pulled out and slammed back in.
"Does it feel good?" Harry questioned, licking his earlobe. Draco nodded his head in response. "I can make it feel even better." Harry voiced seductively.
The stimulation was overwhelming his body, drowning him in immense pleasure. Before Harry could reach any sort of climax, Draco let up to purr in his ear, "Get on your knees."
The journey was quick and easy, no one appearing or slowing Harry down, no Peeves in sight to alert his presence. Soon the door to the room was stood infront of him, a 'occupied' sign plastered along the front. Harry said the password, the door unlocking and opening as he pushed against the handle. It made a creaking noise, not loud in reality, but the night seemed to make everything sound louder than it really was. He quickly shut it behind him, heart racing in his chest and keeping an ear out for any sounds beyond the wood, nothing reporting back to him after seconds of waiting.
"Draco?" Harry whispered looking around the room to find the Blond male. Harry walked past a block of stalls and finally came across the huge, swimming pool like bathtub where he found the male he was looking for. A few torches were lit along the ceiling, a nice warm glow to the room.
No noise was heard, the hallway was empty, so taking the advantage they slipped out the door and into the dark hallway.
Professor Snape was cut off by a high-pitched twitter sounding from beside him. Professor Umbridge stood with her back straight, smiling up at everyone in her vision.
"Let go of him now!" Hermione shouted, pointing her wand at Draco's neck. Draco looked at her in disgust while still holding onto the boy's collar.
Continuing along the halls, Harry crept around each corner with caution, each step growing closer to his destination and closer to the boy awaiting him.
Harry's lip twitched and his eyebrows knitted together. "Says the one who only has snobs as 'friends'. If you weren't a Malfoy they wouldn't even bat an eyelash your way. I'm pretty sure your father pays them just to talk to you." Harry responded.
"50 points will be taken away from Gryffindor for your incompetence, Miss Granger. You will be serving detention with me for the remainder of-."
Harry trailed his hands along Draco's sides, grazing his flesh with goosebumps. His hands slid down towards Draco's thighs which he hoisted over his shoulders, securing them in place before slipping his hands further down to Draco's hole.
Moonlight streamed in through the arched windows, cascading the ground in a puddle of white light. Students, teachers, ghosts and portraits slept soundly in the peaceful dark.
A moan caught in Harry's throat, a whine pouring out instead. His lips trembled as a hand slid over his erection, his body jolting in pleasure. His grip tightened on Draco's shirt, scrunching the material between his hands.
Hands wove through Harry's hair tugging at it whenever Draco twitched. Harry pushed his mouth further down onto Draco's dick stopping once he could not take any more of it in. Draco held Harry's head in a tight grip, helping him to manoeuvre his throat.
They waddled along to the dungeons bumping into each other as they were squeezed into the tight cloak.
"What do you want me to do now?" Draco whispered against his lips, his breath skimming Harry's puffy ones. Draco could feel him shudder, barely hearing the words he forced out.
There, outside the doors to the Great Hall, stood Draco and his goons Crabbe and Goyle. Next to them was a young boy from Gryffindor who was shaking, struggling to keep back his tears.
"Harry, what happened to your hand?" Draco had seen Harry punch the wall before he spoke to him in the corridor, but the marks on his hands couldn't just be from that alone. It was hard to make out where the open wound was as a big patch of dried blood covered a good portion of his hand. Harry yanked his wrist out of Draco's touch, keeping his head down as he walked over to the desk where he'd left his bookbag, throwing the strap over his shoulder. He glanced at his hand, wishing Draco hadn't noticed, reminding him of the pain he wished to forget.
Harry slowly trudged his way through the common room, tiptoeing up the stairs to his shared room. The door, slowly gave way, Harry trying to keep as quiet as possible. He peaked at each of the sleeping figures, no one had moved since he left earlier, except Ron's snoring had gotten louder. Harry reached his bed and slipped off the Invisibility cloak, tucking it back into his truck with the map. He sat down on his bed and placed his wand down on the bedside table along with his glasses. He slipped back under the covers, rolling over and getting comfortable. His eyes started to droop and eventually he lulled to sleep.
Harry's hands wandered Draco's body, trailing down his hips to his cock and beginning to pump it, seeing the cum seeping out.
"Very good. Well then, you are free to return to your dormitory." Umbridge finally made a move back to her desk, giving Harry space to breath without her staring at the back of his head constantly.
"No. It's fine. I just want to hurry up and get it done. If I finish early then I will meet you in the Great Hall." Harry rushed out.
The hours passed agonisingly so in Harry's opinion and as soon as lunch time arrived, he was out the door before anyone else. Several footsteps raced after him shouting his name.
A hand grasped the back of Harry's neck, catching him off guard as Draco's lips smashed against his for an affectionate peck. Draco pulled back smirking and started to walk away from him towards the staircase.
Draco could feel Harry's body trembling beneath his fingers, his grip latching onto Draco's shirt as if he was holding on for dear life. Draco didn't know what to do, he wasn't one to comfort someone when they were upset so he stood there, confused on how to make him feel better.
"You're not going anywhere until we check your pockets," Draco said, smirking. He grabbed the boys collar and motioned for Crabbe and Goyle to search him. "Let's see if you're telling the truth." Draco growled.
Harry stood up, his knees wobbly as he got to his feet. He fixed his tie as best as he could before stepping over Draco's body to the door. Draco tried to purposely trip him over for his own amusement however failed, leaving him pouting up at Harry.
"Please-Please, let me cum!" Draco begged, irritation dripped from his voice. Harry smirked, rubbing his hand faster stimulating Draco's upcoming orgasm.
Even though it had been a few days after their encounter, Draco couldn't stop thinking about it. It bothered him day and night. He was pissed at Harry for what he did. He had humiliated him. But he also had turned him on. That's what confused him the most. He hated Harry. Right? They were enemies. But what Harry did to him felt good. Amazing, even.
Draco smirked, "Stupid Hufflepuff, thinking she can get past us. Pathetic." Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's response. Crabbe and Goyle laughed before heading further down the hall, stopping at a brick wall.
Harry paused when Umbridge spoke for the last time, gripping the handle with such force he could feel the hinges tremble on the frame. She was lying. Trying to get under his skin. She wanted to give him as many detentions as possible so he'd stop spreading his "lies" he'd been telling everyone for months. He swallowed a lump in his throat, responding to her.
As the minutes passed, Harry no longer lent on the wall and was now opening the closet, looking around at the tiny space. A few brooms layed against the far corner, dust littering the floor. It wasn't much to look at compared to the Room of Requirement, but it would have to do for now. A screeching noise echoed from down the hallway. Harry frowned, spinning around and letting out a yell when a body slammed into his, trapping him in the closet. The door locking behind them.
"What? I didn't hear you." Harry's chest rumbled as he spoke. Draco scrunched his nose and fisted Harry's shirt in his hand.
Draco's knees locked in place as Harry continued his hand job. His pace was steady picking up speed a little while later and slowing down again to tease him.
"Mr Weasly, you will also be serving detention tonight for your foul language. If you continue as you are you will also be suspended from your Prefect duties." Ron was about to protest but Hermione stopped him. "You will both recieve a note later today including your detention times. That will be all now so please enjoy the rest of your day".
"Hey! I don't spend hours on my appearance just for it to be in vain. I have to maintain my popularity, you know." He pouted, turning away from Harry and crossing his arms.
Draco's hair hung in limp strands about his face, damp with his sweat. Saliva pooled from his lips as his mouth hung open in bliss, his orgasm beginning to take affect as Harry sped his pace, scissoring his hole and sucking his dick at the same time. Draco's grip on Harry's hair tighten to the point he nearly ripped some strands out, gasping when the balloon inside him popped with a shuddering explosion. Harry removed his fingers but kept his mouth still as Draco pumped his cum down his throat, Harry trying his hardest not to choke on the fluid. Draco's chest heaved, his head hanging limp as he stared down at Harry, watching him swallowing around his cock.
Draco grabbed the arm of the chaise clawing at the fabric as Harry began moving again. The dull sting of his ass being opened wide soon disappeared, a more pleasant feeling overtaking his senses.
A second passed before Harry's shoulders drooped, the tense muscles relaxing as a sigh escaped his lips. He pushed himself off the wall and slowly stepped out into the middle of the corridor, keeping his eyes on the corner Flich had left just incase he decided to turn back.
Harry stood up from his chair, gathering his bookbag off the floor and swinging it over his shoulder, being mindful not to touch his bleeding hand too much. He picked up the piece of parchment he'd been writing on for the last hour and the quill he wished he could burn out of existence.
Harry closed his eyes, all anger leaving him, kissing back. Opened mouth kisses soon came into the mix, Draco diverting between his neck, collar bone and jaw. Harry let pleased moans slip past his lips, leaning into the pleasure wrecking his body. He looked back at him now, eyes hooded as Draco released his mouth from Harry's neck.
"Damnit! That bastard!" He glanced at himself in the mirror before turning to the stalls and walking into one, locking the door behind him.
Licking his lips, he moved his head down to Draco's nipples, teasing the sensitive buds with his teeth. Draco swung his arms around Harry's neck, gripping on for dear life and pressing Harry's face further into his body, drowing in the pleasure.
"You should've seen the Hufflepuff girl we caught sneaking out. We promised not to snitch on her if she gave us five Galleons. Look 'ere, she payed up." A golden glint extended from Crabbe's hand, a proud smile on his face. Harry was struggling to resist from hexing them, annoyed when they started to insult the poor girl they had stolen from.
Draco's eyes followed Harry until he was left alone. He let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes leaning his head against the wall. He ran a hand through his hair and reopened his eyes. His body was still hot and his erection was prominent.
"Harry, don't lie-" Draco wasn't convinced, slowly walking over to Harry but his words were drowned out when Harry interrupted him.
The water settled around them, Draco holding onto Harry as they caught their breaths, the hot water flushing their faces. The room had become hotter than before, leaving their skin covered in a sheen of sweat, sticking to their hair. Draco pulled out of Harry, turning him enough to see his red face. Harry rested back against the wall, feeling heavy and sore. Draco blocked his body from escaping, both his arms holding him up on the wall behind Harry's head, steadying him.
"Well, what are you waiting for? You're not going to leave me in this bath all alone, are you?" Draco said while smirking. Harry rolled his eyes before setting down his wand, whispering "Nox" to shut off the light. Shrugging off the cloak, he threw it to the counter lining the wall, his glasses and map following suit. He began to strip off his top, his trousers and undergarments, watching as the pooled by his feet. Draco's eyes followed him as he walked to the edge of the tub, each foot sinking into the water, the bubbles swirling round his feet as he stepped in.
"You should probably take care of that. I suggest you go to the nearest toilets. Dinner is almost over." Harry smirked at him in satisfaction. He turned around and walked off towards the Great Hall.
"HEY! YOU RUINED MY HAIR! DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO STYLE IT?." Draco yelled, slicking his hair back behind his ears.
His blond head disappeared around the corner, no longer in Harry's eyesight. A few minutes went by before his feet started moving, his steps slow as his knees wobbled. By the time he got to the staircase, his body seemed to move normally again making it easy to walk down the stairs without feeling like he would fall.
Hermione looked at him and nodded her head in understanding. Harry looked back at his apple and thought back to earlier, turning redder thinking about Draco. He looked across from him at the Slytherin table and made eye contact with said boy. Draco winked at him before getting up and leaving the Slytherin table with his group. Harry looked down at his apple again and his face blushed once more.
"What was that? I couldn't hear you." Harry could sense the amusement in his tone, growling out his words louder this time, not wanting to repeat himself.
"Fine. I won't talk but please stop hurting me." Draco decided to just let Harry get his frustrations out, he wasn't too confident in what eles he could do for him other than that. Harry nodded his head, releasing Draco's top and Draco did the same, letting Harry's arms go.
Turning around the last corner, his feet jolted to a stop; his body freezing in place as the looming figure grew near. His breath hitched in his throat and sweat began to slip down his brow, the blood in his veins rushing to his ears as his heart thumped in his chest.
"What the hell, Draco! You prat. You scared the shit out of me!" Harry snapped before glaring at him. Draco started to chuckle, Harry rolled his eyes.
Professor Umbridge had hired a few students (Slytherins) to help keep surveillance at night for any rule breakers and each student would earn house points for their cooperation. Draco was surveilling the 7th floor tonight.
"What's wrong, Potter?", Draco breathed out, chuckling, "Can't move?". Harry looked up at Draco, rolling his eyes at his tauting.
"You look better with your hair slicked back and without your glasses. You look so sexy." Draco whispered in his ear, seductively using his other hand to play with the hair on the nape of his neck, pulling him in and closing the gap between their lips.
"I suggest you head to the Hospital Wing before another fight breaks out." Not waiting for a response,  he left the group of students standing in the Hall, his cloak billowing behind him.
"I want you to touch me," he breathed out starting to remove his clothing, "with your hands and your mouth." His dick stood tall as he finished removing his clothes: the head was flushed pink, precum occupying the tip.
Draco dunked his head back under the water, the little horns falling limp back onto his head. He washed himself just like Harry, swimming over to him once he was done. Harry pushed himself up onto the wall, getting out of the water and into the freezing air. His arms wrapped around himself as he went over to the same counter that held his stuff, two fluffy towel set out beside them. He heard the water shift behind him, Draco grabbing the remaining towel and drying his body. With the towel wrapped around Draco's hips, he walked over to the tub, releasing the plug and draining the dirty water.
"Oh yeah, I forgot to ask. What is this place?" Draco questioned, glancing around the room intrigued.
Harry picked up his wand, using a charm to speed up the drying process, letting him put back on his clothing faster. He ruffled his hair before grabbing his glasses, able to see the room better now. Draco came up next to him, using the same charm on himself with his own wand and quickly dressing back in his school robes. Harry raised an eyebrow, confused he didn't have his pajamas on.
They passed hallways smoothly until they reached the stairs and carefully descended them at a slow rate: not wanting to alert anyone of their presence.
"I'll see you around." Harry kept his back to Draco, making his way over to the door. He couldn't face him right now, he didn't want to. He was scared Draco would see him as weak if he saw the emotions he was trying so hard to suppress. It was best to just walk away and get back to Gryffindor Tower as soon as possible. Harry unlocked the door with a tap of his wand, leaving the classroom. Footsteps echoed behind him, Draco rushing after him.
"I needed to get something from the common room. I have to do my Potions homework so I think I'll just skip lunch." Harry lied.
"What's the rush, Potter? Leaving me already? I'm hurt." Draco teased, putting a hand over his heart in mock hurt.
Broken gasps bellowed from his lips as his hole was filled up, opening wider and wider as Harry's dick pushed deep into him, sucking him inside and squeezing the shaft as he tried to relax.
Grabbing the cloak, he ripped it from his head, fisting it in his hand. His heart pounded in his ribcage as he caught his breath.
"You're one to talk, I don't see you jumping up and down right now." Draco let out a scoff, letting go of the wall and swimming backwards into the middle of the tub to prove him wrong.
"Ok, if you're sure." She gave a questionable look before slowly walking away with Ron following behind.
Harry scoffed. "No, I think prat is more fitting to be honest." A smirk appeared on his face at Draco's scowl, a light chuckle passing his lips.
"Well then, I hope you enjoy being scolded when you turn up empty handed." Harry remarked as he strolled past Draco, hands in his pockets.
Harry let out a light scoff. His shoes clicked along the stone floor as he glided over to Draco. He stopped a few centimetres away from his body.
A hand grasped Harry's chin, pulling his face in close to the slytherin boy's where a smug smirk sat upon his face, clear as day.
Snores from Ron shook the room, Harry trying his very best not to wake him and which, thankfully, he didn't.
Just as he neared them, the door opened and a dark figure stood before him. Draco drew his wand high ready to strike however stopped once he saw who it was.
The tension that had built up in his body snapped. Draco's hips locked in place while Harry kept pumping his fist. A loud moan tore through Draco's vocals as his cum splattered against Harry's hand. He panted hard, struggling to regain his breath.
"And that's how you chose to handle the situation?! What the hell is wrong with you?!" Draco seethed. His jaw ticked.
"Well, well. If it isn't Scarhead. What are you doing out here, Potter? Shouldn't you be in the hall with Granger and Weasel? Or have they finally had enough of you and run off together?" Draco taunted, stopping Harry down the corridor.
The Great Hall was still full of students as he reached the doors and he spotted Hermione and Ron sitting near the middle of the Gryffindor table. He reached them both in no time and sat down, picking up a sandwich and an apple.
"There will be no dueling in the corridors." A monotone voice snared from behind them. The students turned to the new voice, a look of despair reflecting on the Gryffindors' faces.
Even when Harry handed the items over to Umbridge, he still couldn't look her in the eye, worried he might lose control of himself. Umbridge took the items gladly from Harry, smiling as she watched him turn around and grasp the doorknob, pulling the wooden door open.
"I-Is this where it feels good?~" Draco's words began to slur as he spoke, his focus on pounding into Harry's ass. He got no response, Harry's mouth not seeming to work anymore, his head barely nodding as a yes.
"What? Who's there? Hello?" Harry startled at the voice, turning to its direction, seeing the Fat Lady groggily looking about for the person who had disturbed her sleep. She yawned continously, squinting down before shutting her eyes against her will. Harry's paralysed body relaxed a moment later, the cold sweat that had covered him, thinking he had gotten caught, slowly dissipating as he watched her sleep, her head lolling from shoulder to shoulder.
Harry groaned in pain and anoyannce before looking up and meeting Draco's gaze. Draco towered over him, straddling his hips and smirking.
Harry read over the note twice, sliding it back into his trousers before anyone could notice. He looked back up at his friends, trying to encourage them to eat something.
"Well, it was better than having a duel. Why are you so angry about it? If I remember correctly, you seemed to have enjoyed it."
Harry attacked his neck with wet kisses, sucking and biting on his skin leaving hickeys in a few places.
Draco clenched his teeth. The urge to hit Harry was growing. He knew he couldn't tell anyone, his reputation would crumble if he did. Harry smirked knowing he was right. But he'd be damned if he was gunna put up with Harry's bullshit. Draco growled at him. His lips parted.
Draco's body was on fire, lust bubbling in every nerve as Harry ravished his chest in wet licks. He could feel the slickness of Harry's hand as he rubbed his cock, both his sweat and pre-cum mixing. Harry marveled his way down Draco's abdomen, lowering his body to the ground and kneeling just before Draco's lower regions. Harry released his sweaty hand from him and used his mouth instead to continue pumping his dick. A moan caught in Draco's throat, his hand reaching out to grab Harry's hair and help guide him against his dick. The warmness of Harry's mouth only invited his orgasm to grow, swelling like a balloon, ready to pop at any moment. Draco rocked his hips against his mouth, quickening up the pace. He could feel the balloon on the verge of bursting, repeating "yes" over and over. Harry gagged along the shaft, spit sticking to his lips and all over Draco's privates.
Harry awoke slowly to the sound of birds chirping in distance and the soft rustling of the trees. He rubbed his eyes, pushing the covers aside and glanced around the living room. He smiled softly, curling his fingers into the blanket. A candle chandelier hung in balance in the centre of the living room over the brown coffee table.
If Harry were forced into the wrong side of the war, would he have denied? Would he be valiant enough to? In theory, he was. In theory, he would retort cleverly if he was about to be tortured or killed. Yet, he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure if he would’ve denied if the life of his family was at stake. If he could protect his family, why wouldn’t he?
Malfoy chuckled. A strand of blond hair rested over his right eye, and he didn’t brush it off. It was kind of attractive in the silver light – wait, he wasn’t – He didn’t want to think about it.
“Precisely.” Malfoy said, pouring the batter into the pan with a ladle, an evident smile etched onto his face and it caused the irritating little flutter in Harry's chest. “I can continue with
“Yes, well – if you’re surrendering within the first four days of practicing the Patronus charm – you’re not cut out for it.” He said, with a rather dramatic roll to the eyes. “Patience, Malfoy. Patience.”
Draco stumbled into the sand first, on his back, with the brunet landing on top of him. “Oh, Salazar,” Draco said, muffled and echoing in the ears. “
His mind traced back to the manor, and the words that Lucius Malfoy had whispered softly before he had fired the spell: ‘Save him’
The sky was slightly darker when a light of a star faded. It wouldn’t be, if the light never existed.
The sun was rising at a distance, casting a warm, rosy glow upon the Island. The tree leaves were rustling, and he could vaguely hear the soft chirping of a few birds. The brunet sighed, as he opened his eyes and stared at the horizon.
He inhaled shakily. The rage was familiar, and he couldn’t give in. He closed his eyes, focusing on the sound of the waves and the rustling of tress. On the soft breeze. And it was slightly better.
Malfoy did not have breakfast that morning. Or lunch. He didn’t write back. Instead, he wandered back into the bedroom with any notes. Confusion was one way to put it.
Potter smiled, clearly pleased by the last bit. Or he wanted to rile him up. “You’re sort of fascinated with the idea of Neverland. Or fairy-tales.”
The seashell ascended in the air at a slow, decided pace. He could control the flow. It wasn’t spontaneous. It was calm. Precise. The shell was hovering mid-and and he caught it in his hand and a small smile formed on his face. “It’s – wow.”
He felt a breath claw of his throat and the confidence returned in him while he dipped the blond to the floor in accordance with the music. He did not, however, raise him up. “Is it the right moment to mention how beautiful you look tonight?”
When the brunet ended it with a soft exhale, Draco raised his head with a slow yawn. He cleared his throat as he created a bit of distance. “You’re up.”
Draco smiled. “Or a side with a pitch-black sky, where infinite falling stars streak the night sky, and live instead of burning out.”
“You –” He had a small crack to the voice and a flicker of confusion crossed the features for a brief second, the composure shifting slightly. In an uncertain voice, he said, “we’re not –” A pause. “friends yet, are we?
Draco crawled onto the bed, and kissed him softly. “I love you. I fucking love you – Say it again. Say it all again, and I swear I’ll never stop you.”
He couldn’t wrap his head around that. Lucius Malfoy could’ve given him to Voldemort, but he hadn’t. He wasn’t even hurting him in any way. “He disarmed me, and sent me here.”
He turned, casting a final glance at the sea, and walked to the house “If you write a code of conduct, ninety-five of the hundred rules will include your favourite Gryffindor, won’t it?”
He couldn’t think of Sirius. It was stark reminder of the casualties in the war. Of the one family he had lost. The only family. He could never have a proper family.
In a sense, he was a prisoner of some memory. A prisoner of fear. And failure. He would define himself by things he couldn’t change.
They slipped into the house quietly, and Draco pushed the door until it was almost closed. Only a small whistle of the wind revealed that it wasn't. He fished out his wand from his robes, lighting a fire in the grate.
Harry laughed. Malfoy smiled. And it caused a tiny flutter in his chest again. He opened the fridge, browsing for the chocolate chips and avoiding Malfoy’s gaze. He detested the flutter or the warmth that coursed through him. He cursed silently. Yet, the flutter didn’t want to cease.
He could hear the smile in Draco’s voice when he said, “Oh, Of course – who would you show off your overachieving abilities in Quidditch, sarcasm and Patronus charms to if not your favorite Slytherin?”
“The Patronus – It’s a stag,” He said with a brief pause, staring at the sort of faded wisps of clouds. The sky was canvas-like painted with warm colours. “because my dad was an Animagus stag.”
It was a familiar drawl. It couldn’t be. He was just an outline against the sky, but the moonlight falling softly on the platinum blond hair was unmistakable. He turned.
"Yes, I want to dance with you and if the prophet wants to publish fifteen articles it can," He outstretched a hand towards the blond with a small smile, "come on."
“Godric, Draco,” He lifted the blond up with a small smile and drew him closer, "You're perfect," He raised a slightly trembling hand to Draco's face and his thumb across his cheekbone, "I could dance with you to our favourite song forever."
As anticipated, the crepes were still on the kitchen counter when he returned to the house. And he could only assume that the plan was still working.
Harry placed the chopped strawberries neatly in the middle, and wandlessly summoned the whipped cream. It was a tiny victory.
He didn’t say more. He turned, walking towards a quaint glass house, half a mile away from the water.
“Mhm, yes sure – now, when I want to be sarcastic, you dare to counter it with what I said to you a few moments ago,” Draco shifted in place with a stifled groan, “Of course, the precious chosen one can do whatever he wants to, can’t he?” He went on, voice laced with malice, “oh, such a privilege.”
He shrugged. He had been dueling with the death eaters, and he was exhausted. He didn’t even know if the others were alright. “I can’t stay.”
Malfoy fished out a wand, and fiddled with it, waiting for the tension to clear. In retrospect, he should’ve toned it down a notch instead of an insensitive comment. Or stating the obvious, in this case.
“I – forget it, Potter.” Harry felt a small throb in the chest. “perhaps, you and I –” Draco’s fingers circled around the doorknob and he twisted it slowly. “I was right, we can’t be friends.”
Veelas live for their mates, it was their nature and the moment Potter briefly died was the worst pain Draco had ever suffered. While he hadn’t even known at the time Potter’s whereabouts, he felt it. He vividly recalls being overwhelmed, dropping to his knees and letting his Veela cry out to an awful tune. The agonising stabbing from inside his body, even the Dark Lord’s cruciatus never wounded him quite like that.
The clunk of the half-empty pint glass on the oak table was suddenly the only noise noticeable between the two men.
“Mr Malfoy?” Not again. He slowly turned to face an emotionless Professor McGonagall. “If you wouldn’t mind joining me in my office now?”
He shrugged confused by the question his girlfriend posed, “I think it was bloody weird but he’s a weird guy.”
Though his vision was slightly blurred, he could just make out the shape of a motionless hand on top of his own. Scrunching his eyes together as hard as his body would allow, Draco attempted to clear his sight but was left with more of a bewildering picture than before.
He took a deep intake of air and made sure his eyes were back on the bed across from him, “I asked if you are happy Potter.”
“Right,” Harry inhaled. His mind was spinning with this information. People genuinely believed he hurt Malfoy because he was spiked. Jesus Christ, things were getting messy.
The aged witch dampened her lips, “I wouldn’t say he is out of the woods yet, though your physical touch will bring him back to himself. You must stay with him though Harry, keep physical contact”.
It started off relatively tame, Draco trying to understand the concept of the muggle game. Everyone was picking dares. A few kisses here and there, a Hufflepuff girl had to take a bra off under her shirt, nothing too drastic. Draco just kept quiet and gulped down his drink.
Draco had decided then and there, to refer to the incident as divination-gate. The best yet worst moment of his existence. It was if that brief touch was to be imprinted onto his skin for the rest of eternity.
He felt so exposed, she had seen far too much. Slowly he pulled his knees up to his chest under the sheets and took a glance around the dorm.
While they were all interesting and slightly amusing options, none of them felt right. He couldn’t put his finger on it but Malfoy had been acting sketchy since the beginning of the school year. It was apparent the boy had no friends and yes, Harry was aware of the teasing but there was something else.
The warmth coming from Potter’s hand suddenly felt like it had cooled off slightly within Draco’s body.
“I left you once Dray… I refuse to leave you again,” she wept. “I’m honestly so sorry Draco. I got caught up in what everyone was saying about you. I let it all happen, I watched them tease you, beat you and I sat back and watched…”
sworn rivals, Malfoy, mostly because you were a prat," Four weeks ago he wouldn’t’ve cared if he had offended Draco Malfoy. In fact, he would’ve left the blond to stew in his own misery. Now, he couldn't do that. He did care. More than he wanted to. “Now, you and I are not the same," A beat, "now, we’re friends,” A corner of his mouth upturned in soft amusement. “Deal with it.”
Malfoy’s head snapped up, and he stared at him with a stone-cold face. “I warned you, Potter. Do not go there.”
Malfoy frowned, as his gaze landed on the cup of tea placed on the peninsula. “You – Harry Potter – The Golden Boy – The chosen one – made tea for me?”
“Harry,” he swallows, and one of Harry’s eyebrows raises just slightly, making Draco grin, his boyfriend somehow looking smug even as he laps at the underside of his cock. Draco’s fist moves quicker over himself, waves of pleasure rolling through him, and he knows there’s no use in fighting it, “love, m’coming, open—”
Harry sleeps on his back, arms lazily splayed over his head and thrown atop the pillow near the curls that have gotten even more untamed in his sleep  — it’s often how Draco finds him; in the low light of morning sun peaking in just barely through the window across their bed. For a moment, he stops and just looks, free of shame because Harry can’t quirk an eyebrow up at him and ask him if he’d like to take a picture instead. He can’t hear the other’s snark, see his smirk pull at the corner of his lips, and while he loves all parts of Harry, even the cocky parts, he quite enjoys just watching him rest.
“I could get you off like this,” Draco offers, watching Harry’s eyes open for the first time this morning — he knows the poor thing can’t see well without his glasses, but he looks wide-eyed towards Draco, pupils dark and covering almost all of the green he loves so dearly, “just take my fingers how you like, come all over yourself? Hm?”
Harry ran his hand over his face and into his shaggy hair, “I’m sorry Gin, I should have been honest”.
“You are more than free to check my anatomy Potter,” he slowly responded, trying his hardest to ignore the sudden flutter in his stomach.
Draco felt his body freeze, alcohol bubbling in his stomach being the only movement. He knew people were cheering but he couldn’t hear much more, he knew Pansy was shouting but couldn’t determine anything more. His eyes homed in on Thomas approaching him, a smirk plastered on his face. In seconds a curled fist was flung into his jaw, pain seeping into his pores. He spine shaking in agony, Thomas was laughing back in his seat. He was getting praise.
The tense man let out the breath of air he didn’t realise he was holding. His mind quickly switching from worry to panic.
In seconds she was thrown against the wall by a shirtless figure. The scratching of stumble rubbing against her porcelain neck. The pads of Harry’s fingers pressing hard into her sides, sliding up her ivory blouse revealing her lace lilac bra. The small room filled with the scent of body odour and her neck wedged against a coat hook.
The double-click of her kitten heels slapped against the stonework of the corridor, the signifier of her departure. For now. He let a deep breath from the bottom of his lungs slip through his nostrils, leaving an airy chill on the lower half of his face.
His spine cracked, he felt the soft touch of feathers grazing his back under his robes. This wasn’t right. He didn’t do anything. They were wrong. His mate was wrong. His cheeks continued burning up and a cry stuck in his throat. He was spinning again, dancing in a circle with his mate meters away.
He could hear the rhythmic tapping of hard soled shoes approaching. Each smack on the stonework a countdown to reality. His lips had thinned and his eyes focused on the wall ahead of where he perched.
Clumsily, Draco wrapped himself tighter in his robes, having to bum shuffle slightly on the tiles to free the excess fabric he was sat on. He wanted to flee but he was a still as the water on the lake. All the memories of Potter swirling in Draco’s mind. Disgusting. Pathetic. Stay out of my way. Disgusting. Disgusting.
Blinking Ginny stepped back with a drunken sway, the stone wall catching her. “I don’t understand. You s-slept with-“
They strolled silently through the grounds towards the Quidditch pitch, Harry wrapping his arm tightly around Ginny’s small waist.
They moved inside the warm stones of the castle and found themselves in a quiet window seat in the East Wing. They mainly sat in comfortable silence, Luna reading a magazine upside-down and Draco fiddling with the ends of his knotted scarf.
Another piercing pressure erupted from his lower back. His hips jolted forward in reaction and one knee gave out causing him to stumble off balance.
She was half-dressed in her training uniform. Her baggy top falling just under her bum, as he noted her crumpled leggings thrown off in the corner of the room. She had a light sheen on her skin and a relaxed disposition.
Suddenly his shoulders were on fire, every pore of skin exposed to Thomas’ palms shaking him back and forth.
“Thank you,” if the boys had seen Draco’s wings they would have destroyed him, he was barely safe in that bed at the best of times.
It appeared all of the blood on his face had drained away, leaving a deathly version of the boy’s angular face. His normally sleek locks were matted and the strands stuck down on his forehead brushing over crunched up eyelids. Though none of that was what caught Harry’s immediate attention, it was the darkened shell that was protruding from his mouth. Malfoy had a bloody beak and was squawking as if his life depended on it.
Instinctively Ron wrapped his arm around his girlfriend, “we’re going to look for ‘Mione's parents and maybe spend Christmas day on the beach.”
“-I-I-I’m so, so s-sorry…” he wept. Every part of him was shaking, his dirty blonde hair falling in front of his eyes. He felt a relief like never before, she was off him but suddenly he could feel the coolness of urine spreading where Pansy’s wandering hands had been. He had pissed himself, he was mortified and scared, everything felt so foreign to him. Pansy was looking at him in disgust. He was disgusting.
