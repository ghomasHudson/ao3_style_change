Draco went to the cabinet and poured himself a drink. He took a few sips as he stood over the counter, but when he brought the glass up to his lips once more he noticed the tremor in his hand. Fuck. He set the glass down.
“Last time you played him you were still a rookie and you didn’t have my help.”
“Don’t flatter me. I got lucky,” Draco responded.
Draco turned over so that he was facing Harry. “What is it?”
The funeral was held outside of the Château in Sancerre. Draco wasn’t even sure why he bothered to attend. He shouldn’t have come at all but he knew it wouldn’t have felt real unless he saw it with his own two eyes. It was a small gathering and it wasn’t hard to pick out his father’s widow though the children were a surprise - a boy and a girl. They were young. Younger probably than he had been when he’d lost his mother.
The match was intense. Draco kept dry enough with a few water-repelling charms but that didn’t make it any easier to see. He decided to fly a couple of laps around the field to see if he could spot the telltale shine, and he watched Durmstang’s seeker do the same on the other end of the pitch.
After they returned home they celebrated the season together. Justin and his wife hosted the party at their house and Draco finally got to meet their kids. There was music and laughter and tacky paper decorations, and Draco couldn’t think of a better way to spend his time. Harrison led a wonderful toast dedicated to families, both found and made, which did not make Draco cry at all. The night was one of the best of Draco’s life and he spent it with Harry at his side.
He spent the rest of the day pouring through books, but the only thing Draco learned that Thomas had been right. There were countless cases of squibs being born into pureblood families. In the early days they had been killed, but that practice was soon seen as cruel and barbaric. There was a law passed in the early 1900s that forbid squibs from marrying or having children that stayed on the books for several decades before being repealed. There were even accounts as late as 1976 of forced sterilizations. But for the most part it seems purebloods just swept the entire thing under the rug. It become a well-kept family secret and was something that no one wanted to discuss. Draco was disgusted and appalled.
Well that explained what a kid was doing at Beauxbâtons, sort of.
“Well, what do you want to do?”
“Alright, point taken. I’ll talk to the professors tomorrow and see if any of them are feeling particularly generous.”
“I’d have to get to know you better first before I threw out an accusation like that.”
“The Euros right? Ginny was upset she didn’t make the cut.”
“You’re here aren’t you.”
study better with people. You know my rank has already dropped two spots this semester.”
He started taking the magical pills every day once again. Then he would go for his morning run, eat breakfast, head to the training facility for some kinetic stretching, run through practice with the team, spend some extra time on the pitch running his own drills and practising different scenarios, then there was his cool down workout usually lifting weights or some other strength training exercise, he would shower before heading home and run any necessary errands. Once he got back to his flat he would pour himself a drink and start on dinner, while he was cooking he would listen to some muggle tapes and practice his Russian. He would usually have another glass as he ate and studied old matches. After cleaning up and getting ready for bed he would polish off one last nightcap to help him sleep then wake up the next morning and start all over.
Draco spent the summer on a broom. His entire life had been one struggle after another, everything he had he’d fought for, his grades, his popularity, his friend (singular). But flying was easy, effortless, and it was something he was good at. More than once, he realized he had skipped a meal because he was too busy flying or that the sun had already set without him even noticing. The only reason he ever stopped was because the school curfew prevented him from flying at night. Which was just as well, it gave him the time to write to Pansy and stay on top of his studies.
Was this man for real? Draco moved to leave but was held back by a hand gripping his upper arm. The hand quickly retracted but it was enough to give Draco pause. It was probably best to just let Potter say whatever it was he wanted to say then Draco could get out of here.
Draco levelled a glare at Potter. “
Professor Dubois had stayed behind this year, so Draco picked back up the habit of studying in his office. Occasionally he would go on walks in the forest with Professor Dubois and they would gather different plants and just talk.
At the end of the summer, Draco found himself invited to another party in the woods. This time he didn’t go off alone but stuck with the group. He kept pace with the fifth and sixth years, drinking and playing party games. Now that his expectations were much lower, Draco actually caught himself enjoying it a few times. The alcohol gave him an easy release and helped him relax, his worries drifting away. As the night went on, Draco’s memories got fewer and farther between. He felt like this should probably bother him more than it did, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to care.
has an article listing everything from apps and forums, to support groups and call centers, even podcasts.
“Were you really studying?” Thomas asked.
“I would like to be.”
Pansy raised her eyebrows and gave him a pointed look, Merlin’s left tit Draco hated her.
“Better be careful Potter, people are going to start thinking you’re obsessed with me.”
He scanned the room to see if any of the adults had witnessed the event. It seemed he was on his own. As the initial shock and adrenaline wore off, Draco could feel the right side of his face beginning to throb. The other boys grabbed their food and moved to another table, so at least that was something.
That night all the teams celebrated, winners and losers. Draco was thoroughly enjoying himself. It had been a while since he had been this drunk and on hard liquor no less, it would seem the Russian weren’t much for wine.
Between his outdoor study sessions and his playdates with Thomas, Draco had spent an exorbitant amount of the summer outside. He’d used skin protection charms hourly, but by the start of classes his skin had developed a golden glow and his hair had lightened so much that it was almost platinum in colour. It had gotten much longer since the start of first year as well, there wasn’t quite enough of it to pull back but the soft locks were constantly falling into his eyes and Draco had developed a habit of tucking it back behind his ears.
I beat Krum.” He opened his mouth to add more before changing his mind. He was done with this conversation. He apparated on the spot and ended up in his own hallway.
Draco held on as his body was yanked about through space, twisting and turning. He crashed into the ground landing on his butt. A few of the other boys were on the ground next to him, one scrambled away to puke in some nearby bushes, but a couple of the boys who had been laughing at him earlier managed to land unsteadily on their feet.
Harry Potter, made his bid at Krum’s title. Instead of completing his final year at
. Draco could feel those eyes following him across the pitch even if he couldn’t work up the nerve to look for himself.
“Draco.”
As bad as things had gotten after his father’s funeral, this was worse. As the days turned into weeks which turned into months, Draco lost any hold he had on the outside world. All that mattered was where the next drink was coming from. And the moments in between, the small slivers of sobriety, those were agony.
Inside were a couple dozen glass cloches. Draco got to work setting them out for his classmates and soon after he finished the other students started to arrive.
The look in Draco’s eyes was hostile. “How would you know? You’re not around enough to see.”
I know all this information can be overwhelming (I have definitely been there), but I hope that if you need help you are able to find it.
“I can’t believe you.” Draco looked around for his shirt and trousers before giving up and summoning them non-verbally.
“I know.”
Draco performed well in his matches. There were a few tight games, but if he was being honest no one came close to beating him - certainly not Fisher. Draco won the cup easily and got invited to join Great Britain's team for the upcoming European Cup. He accepted, of course, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth.
Draco nodded.
Draco was nervous as hell and his mind was racing. He wasn’t even sure he wanted to play quidditch anymore, but he wasn’t sure what else to do. He had given it a lot of thought in the past few weeks. Maybe Dubois would be willing to be his thesis adviser and he could get his mastery in Herbology. But what then? Draco had no interest in teaching nor did he particularly want to work for a potions manufacturer as an ingredients expert. Perhaps he could travel the world and collect magical plants for wholesale, though that would require some capital for start-up and capital was something Draco didn’t have. Which brought him back to quidditch.
A few months into Draco’s recovery Pansy did the impossible. She helped get Draco a second chance at his pro-quidditch career. He hadn’t touched a broom in all that time though he had continued to exercise almost obsessively.
Draco looked away. “I don’t know. I might not even get matched with him in the next tournament.”
More fun outfit inspirations! Draco's look at the equinox dinner was inspired by
“Look Draco, going from number two to number four doesn’t make you any less perfect. And any apprenticeship program would be lucky to have you after graduation. Besides, grades are just one arbitrary measure of a person’s intelligence. All they really tell you is who is good at working the system.”
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” said Pansy. “If you want to play quidditch then play quidditch. I’m sure that one of the teams has an opening for next year.”
“Monday.”
“Oh, come off it Draco. We both know you more than enjoy it. Since the moment you got on that broom, there was no force on earth that would keep you grounded. I’m sure that if you became an Animagus you would be some kind of bird the way you take to the air.”
Lunch went well and after that Draco and Pansy ate together every day. Sometimes they ate with the other boys, sometimes with the girls, and sometimes it would just be the two of them. Everyone assumed they were dating and Draco and Pansy were content to let them think whatever they wanted.
“We could make it interesting… a galleon per game. That is unless you’re scared Malfoy?”
Draco watched wide-eyed as the cake switched its trajectory and flew right back at Simon hitting him square in the face. To the other boys watching it looked like the package had bounced off the rim of the bin and back at Simon, but Draco knew better.
“Talent,” Blaise clarified. “You, Draco Malfoy, have talent. And that can give you a life that anyone would envy.”
“Draco, great game today.” It was the female Weasley. What was her name? Penny? No, it started with a ‘G’...
“Draco!”
The first time Draco had even touched a broom since the Euros had been last week but he was grateful he had managed to get some sort of practice in. Draco didn’t even want to entertain the notion of getting back on a broom for the first time in over a year with the eyes of Harry Potter locked on to him. And they
Draco looked over the paperwork he would have to fill out and mail before coming to another letter.
“I’m afraid he hasn’t gotten to that part yet.” Draco turned to Blaise expectantly.
"I mean he is a Slytherin, right? we like self preservation, he probably ran towards the forest like us, he should be fine" logical thinking to down worry, that's what he was trying to do.
“Well, with feet that size, hard not to” of course Draco had to go and provoke them, but something told me he had done it for a very good reason. His arms were folded now, he was acting as if he had been seeing the horror show the camp side was. Weasley let out a slur. “Language, Weasley” his pale eyes glittering. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?” So that was what he was up to, he was giving them a warning. Urging them to leave. A blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around us.
“I’m flying!” he shouted, and this time, he did not shy away from the silver fire that streamed out of his mouth as he whooped. “Mother, look!”
, but that was neither here nor there. His chances of finding a mate were infinitesimal, because not only would he have to win the undying love of a wizard powerful enough to survive a mating with a weredragon, but he would have to persuade said wizard to make an Unbreakable Vow to never reveal Draco’s identity.
, but it was still his greatest achievement to date. He was confident that even in the future, when he had a mate and a hatchling of his own, it would remain amongst his greatest achievements.
Draco noticed the distinct lack of the term ‘ours’ in describing his parents’ joint claim on him, but he inched forward nonetheless, hesitant at witnessing such an unseemly display of emotion (his mother had taught him that such displays were unseemly) from a stranger. Lucius might have fathered him, but he was still a stranger.
When Lucius pulled back from the hug, Draco smiled, his teeth a bit sharper than usual.
“Fine.” Narcissa sighed. “You may fly at Hogwarts—emergencies only. And by ‘emergencies,’ I mean being reasonably certain of your own death approaching within seconds.
with the sight of that mouse. His stomach grumbled, and he was unexpectedly hungry. Those sandwiches he’d had for lunch mustn’t have been filling enough… Ham sandwich… Cheese sandwich… Mouse sandwich…
a liar, because the alternative was untenable. Surely she would not leave her mate to die alone, even if they had been separated for years, even if Lucius had been missing, even if Draco had never met him.
himself.
It was just… He fantasised about being open about himself, sometimes. He indulged in the occasional daydream of soaring above the spires of Hogwarts, his wings unfurled majestically against the backdrop of a suitably fiery sunset, filling the tiny onlookers beneath him with awe.
Draco didn’t offer his own opinion, for it would not be welcome; he
“Oh! Um.” Draco coughed, and a bright silver flame erupted from his mouth. He staggered backwards. “Fire!”
But he
his death, when you could have done so earlier.”
Being claimed by a dragon was not an insignificant event. Dragons weren’t exactly renowned for letting go; they hoarded and they hoarded, and they guarded their hoard viciously. While Draco had already begun accumulating a modest hoard of his own—trinkets, mostly, pretty stones and seashells and strips of shiny, discarded Christmas wrapping paper that surrounded, like a nest, the single, blazing ruby pendant that he had stolen from his mother’s jewellery box—it was only now, upon meeting his father, that Draco realised there was an inner hoard, as well. People that roused in him the same urge to protect. He could not call them a hoard in the typical sense. He could not hide them away in a cave, away from all harm.
Draco was fortunate that he was a weredragon, for he would not have understood such emotions as a baby. Had he been born in his human form, the ancient knowledge he held within his dragon bones—knowledge passed down by blood, from generation to generation—would not be within his human mind’s reach. Not until he got older, anyway, and his human psyche developed its own intelligence.
Lucius still did not look away from his son. He gazed at Draco with wonder, longing, and a peculiar sort of pain that would take Draco more than a decade to recognise as love.
There, in the glimmering water, he saw a white arrow arcing through the air, and as he dove close enough to skim his talons in the water—what a thrilling splash of coldness against his legs!—he saw what the arrow was.
It was him. He was an alabaster dragon, white all over, with scales so fine that they were scarcely visible, as though he were formed of white silk instead of leather. His talons and his eyes were a burning silver hue that matched the colour of his flames. The ridges on his forehead were regal and pronounced, culminating in a pair of long, tapering, unicorn-like horns, as white as the rest of him, as white as Malfoy Manor’s resident peacocks.
Only when he was five did Narcissa take him out onto the grounds of Malfoy Manor to teach Draco how to fly. She cast a mixed Disillusionment and Silencing charm vast enough to encircle the estate, but did not yet remove the spell that was keeping Draco human. Draco was all but vibrating with impatience. At last, he would be free! At last! At last!
Ah. So it must be terrifying.
fire?”
Draco secretly relished the idea of scaring the wits out of people, but his mother, ever the mind-reader, subjected him to her icy glare whenever she suspected him of such childishness.
“Um, what’s a bigger disaster than death?”
Draco did not dare ask.
And Draco tried. He tried, and tried, and
Only later would Draco learn that they were in France, in the forest of Mont Ventoux, where his mother’s ancestors were from. Weredragons always returned to their ancestors’ lands to give birth. It was tradition. More than that, it was sensible; there was a security in the old magic of his ancestors, who had painstakingly built layers upon layers of defensive wards around mountain caves just like this one, caves that allowed weredragons to go through the birthing process uninterrupted.
. Now, spread your wings.”
“Indeed.” Lucius slumped and addressed Draco again. “That was why I… That’s where I was, all along. I finally managed to engineer an exit from my employer’s organisation.”
This was where he belonged. The scent of ozone and electricity zinged through his nerves like a flush of the most intoxicating power, and though he knew he was only a child, he felt full-grown and just as powerful as his mother in this moment. The sun did not blind his dragon eyes but instead gave everything he saw a blazing purple after-shadow, painting the sky like a canvas both alien and wonderful, a scene out of a dream.
Draco jumped up, propelling himself off the ground and throwing his arms around her neck, although they didn’t even go halfway around. “Mama,” he whispered, and she went still. He had only ever called Narcissa ‘mother’.
It wasn’t as though Draco didn’t know that weredragons were hunted, and that their organs—especially their flaming, giant hearts—were harvested for potions that granted near-immortality. It wasn’t as though he didn’t know that every aspiring Dark Lord would happily make mincemeat out of him at the first available opportunity. It wasn’t as though Draco didn’t know how important it was to keep his true nature hidden.
The sound etched itself into Draco’s mind, which grabbed onto it greedily, as if onto a new addition to a hoard. He had made his mother laugh. Granted, she was laughing
The world was perfect in that instant—just him, his mother and his full belly. He wanted for nothing.
Narcissa
This time, Lucius’s tears
“B-but,” Draco asked, gaining the gift of speech with the rapidity that only weredragons could achieve at such a young age, “wh-what if the fire burns? What if it comes from somewhere else? What if it isn’t
“You have missed me, my hatchling,” she said quietly, the brimstone-and-ash rumble of her voice so longed-for, a memory brought to life. The most precious memory of all.
“Yes, yes,” Draco said impatiently.
“I am looking,” she answered dryly, but with a measure of pride that had Draco preening. He swooped like she did, whirled and ducked and dipped and rolled, following her every move. Before long, they were soaring together, higher and higher, until the Quidditch pitch disappeared beneath them only to replaced by clouds.
Draco obeyed more swiftly than he’d ever obeyed any command of his mother’s—which was saying something, since Narcissa did not tolerate anything less than efficiency—and when he turned back, he found his mother’s clothing folded neatly on a toadstool enlarged into a makeshift table, and his mother standing there in all her colossal dragon glory, towering over him like a fortress.
Blue. All blue, her scales glinting like sapphires. She bowed her strong, graceful neck until her snout was right in front of him. Her nostrils were huge, each nostril the size of his face.
“The wind…” Narcissa rubbed her thumb and forefinger together, as if feeling the texture of the breeze. “The wind itself is a substance; it has a weight and a momentum as hefty as that of a ship’s wheel, and only upon mastering that wheel will you be able to fly safely. If you are not the captain of the ship, the master of the waves, then the wheel will spin uncontrollably and carry you with it into death and disaster.”
His mother chastised him for his foolishness. So Draco learned to hide it, as he’d learned to hide so much.
The dusky valley beyond the cave’s entrance lightened, as though the valley was a cup into which light was flowing, gradually gathering at the bottom in a pool of shimmering green. It was beautiful, even glimpsed through the rain’s semi-transparent veil. This land was beautiful, and it called to Draco like the summons of a faraway song, heard too long ago to remember its exact words.
, and the clouds were as shivery-cool and damp as wet cotton, but far more insubstantial. They melted away before the heat of his breath, opening up for him as though he were a hot knife slicing through butter. Not for an instant did they obscure his eyesight. Flight was made for him, and he was made for flight.
Draco did not meet his mother’s dragon self again for many, many years. For all that she claimed weredragons should not fear themselves, she feared revealing herself—and, therefore, her offspring—to humanity. She feared it more than anything. She told Draco tales of dragon-hunters, of cruel, greedy men, and warned him never to trust a human unless it was his mate. A very carefully chosen, bound-by-an-Unbreakable-Vow mate.
Draco was only an infant, but even so, he envied her. He, too, wanted to be beautiful and terrifying.
“I should have been there. I should have been there, Draco. I’m sorry.”
Naturally, conditions became trying very quickly. Reality had a way of rising to meet one’s expectations.
They walked to the centre of the Quidditch pitch, where Draco had yet to be permitted to whizz about on his broom, as his mother had wished to teach him flying as a dragon, first, so that he did not acquire any ‘bad habits’ (her phrase, not his) from human flying and seek to apply them to his dragon-flight.
“Dragons must make sacrifices for the clan,” Narcissa said quietly, and not without remorse. “We are all but extinct. We cannot lose more of our kin.”
What followed was a series of gruelling years in which Narcissa did her utmost to prepare her fledgling dragon-boy for a world populated by humans that would, upon uncovering the truth, be petrified of him.
rend and rip any that sought to harm them.
Draco dreamt of fighting off evildoers, of being a noble-yet-intimidating creature, of having tales sung about him by the Weird Sisters of the future. (And possibly the present.) He dreamt of fame and power. He dreamt of making men’s knees tremble with fear… or reverence. Or both. Both was good.
narcissa: nobody must find out that my son is a dragon. this is IMPERATIVE. his survival depends on it.
“Your template for flying must be that of a dragon’s,” Narcissa emphasised. “It should lay the foundation for your body’s memory of flight. Human flying is easy, as it is done using the broom as a crutch, but if you become too dependent on that crutch, your learning of dragon-flight will suffer. Hence, we will begin with dragon-flight, and you can learn how to fly with a broom after you have mastered the basic principles of independent flight.”
Narcissa did not need to teach him how to do it; it was natural, like taking a breath after being underwater, both sweet and desperate, and he gulped and gulped and gulped. When he opened his eyes after shutting them (when had he shut them?), he found the ground farther beneath him, and his nose flooded by an excess of smells. His eyes were able to see so far and with such crystal clarity that he could see beyond the Malfoy estate into the township beyond. There was a cockerel-shaped weathervane on the steeple of the tallest roof.
When Draco was seven, he accidentally incinerated his mother’s rose garden. Since then, she became very particular about teaching him self-control.
His wings gave a weak, infantile flutter. They’d never had practice, after all.
again, to fly as his imagination and his instinct bade him to. He had never flown before, but he had dreamed of flying. Oh, had he dreamed. “What if there’s a fire?”
Well. That was reassuring.
. Not minutes, not hours. If there is an alternative to saving yourself that does not expose what you are, then you must choose it, regardless of how difficult it may be. I do not want you transforming at every threat, or because you get into an immature hormonal fight with some adolescent rival of yours. You are only permitted to transform if your very existence is in clear and present danger.”
, Draco’s dragon-mind whispered in the recesses of his consciousness.
“What if there’s an emergency?” Draco piped up. He was bobbing restlessly on his stubby, stupid little human toes, aching to transform again, to be
Outside their cave, it was raining, and the gentle breeze that blew inwards carried on it a soothing mist, bearing the fresh scent of evergreen forests and pine trees. The rising sun cast questing fingers over the horizon, weaving delicate strands of sunlight through the falling raindrops, like threads of gold woven through diamonds.
flow, dampening Draco’s shirt, and Draco experienced a surge of protectiveness. Draco’s mother clearly did not need protection, but this man did, impoverished as he was despite being dressed like a prince; he was starved for affection, for the sight of his own child. This man, who could not sprout wings and talons at will, who could not breathe fire, who was even weaker as an adult than Draco had been as a hatchling.
“Wh-what was the disagreement about?” Draco asked his apparent father, still clinging to his mother’s skirt.
“Of course, Draco, you are a
As his mother led him downwards again, circling around the Malfoy estate and spiralling down towards the lake behind the manor, Draco strained to speed up, eager to see his own reflection in the lake. To truly
a Drakoi. You are mine as much as you are your mother’s.”
Draco’s first memory was a plume of blue fire. With it came the brush of a warm, leathery wing, and the sound of his mother’s voice in his ears, a low, maternal rumble. Her breath was a whiff of brimstone and ash. Her underbelly was a pale cerulean shade that matched the jewel-bright radiance of her large, unblinking eyes, eyes that watched over him with both sternness and tenderness.
Draco took in a shuddering breath. He withdrew about eight feet to create enough space for what he estimated would be his dragon body, and transformed.
that had her launching upwards, the wind generated by her ascent sending a ripple through the grass around her, like a goddess emerging from the earth.
It was on Draco’s sixth birthday that he met his father. His human father. Apparently, Lucius had been abroad, although Draco could not imagine leaving a child of his own unvisited for six whole years. When Draco asked about it, Narcissa merely nodded at her impeccably clad spouse and said serenely, “We had a disagreement.” Her eyes sharpened. “But it is now resolved, is it not, dear husband? Given that you promised not to return until it was?”
Draco listened with half an ear as he beheld the sunrise through the mouth of the cave. Maybe it was only so arresting because it was his first sunrise; he would later associate it with the colour of his mother’s frost-white, nigh-golden hair—or her human form’s hair, rather.
Narcissa had found Lucius and had extracted the Vow from him under what Draco subtly intuited were less-than-ideal conditions, given the coldness that persisted between his parents. Lucius certainly hadn’t harboured an “undying love” for Narcissa; it was likely some combination of desire and strategy, which Narcissa had manipulated to her gain. She had required a human of sufficient standing and strength to bear a hatchling, and by mating with her, Lucius was guaranteed an heir of great magical aptitude.
"You are just jealous I inherited more of the Black beauty than you, it's not my fault Sirius had stronger genes than Narcissa and passed all those Black genes too me" Both boys held back some laughter.
“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to?  trying to rescue the Muggles?”
We walked around the camp and were amazed by the city of tents. The vivid colors, the diverse shapes and sizes of the tents, small kids running around laughing, older wizards using magic to build their tents or doing chores, foolishly believing nobody could see them, it was a truly beautiful sight.
The door of the carriage shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle.
"DRACO! WE FORGOT ABOUT BLAISE!" his eyes shot open like plates. We looked at each other in panic, was he okey? did he get out of that mess? did he get hurt? Fuck! We were both so caught up in our own problems that we complexity forgot.
His whole demeanor was messy and sloppy, as if the weight of his body was suddenly too much for his legs to bare. His eyes looked as if they were on the verge of tears. It didn't take long for me to realize what Draco was upset about, only one person was capable of leaving him in such a state, Potter.
Once we made it to the woods I broke free of Dray's hold and ran towards a tree to puke all the contents of my stomach; my best friend rushed to my side and held my hair up, making soft circle motions on my back.
We stood up quickly grabbed our wands and with no other words we ran out of the tent; Outside it was chaos. The dim light of the few fires that were set at the distance, allowed me to see millions of people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells.
Bulgarians stood up all over the stadium and begun chanting there national anthem, well it was more like screaming it at the top of their lungs. It was a mess, but it all grew quiet when suddenly, Veela started to appear, and they were the most astonishing creatures I had ever seen. Their colorful and beautiful wings were engaged in a careful and gracious dance with the wind, feathers swiftly moving with the wind. My hands twitch with the urge to draw them, draw their breathtaking wings, their smooth skin that somehow shined like the moon, their flawless faces with no marks of aging. I wanted to draw how their golden hair waved in the air and how they bodies moved with such delicacy as they danced to the music. They were hypnotizing.
Eventually I found Nott and Zabini and sat with them, locking away my feelings, and pretending nothing happened.
The three of us, with Mr.Malfoy and Blais's mother now beside us, followed the path marked by green and red lanterns towards the field. The sounds of laughter and people sining set up cheerful atmosphere that lifted my spirits. Draco was right I shouldn't be down, shouldn't be sad, this was the quidditch world cup, I should be having fun and smile. So I jointed into the cheer and sining.
Once I arrived to the Rowle state my mother locked me up on my room, and gone was the warm feeling Mrs.Malfoy left on my chest with the big and warm hug she gave me before I went home.
Note to self: Never write while sleep deprived, also double check.
I guess I should start my story at the quidditch world cup, where I found my dad standing next to Harry Potter laughing like there was no worry in the world. I saw my father who somehow managed to get a trial and was declared innocent months ago, but didn't even bother to contact me at all. But here he was, laughing and having a good time with the Weasley's and Potter.
"I'm sorry! I knew something was up, but I've only realized this once I had already invited you, and I was going to tell you, but... you've been feeling down lately, and I though, hey maybe I shouldn't tell her, and let her enjoy this day, let her have fun and keep her mind off of things" the bloody idiot, always making it hard for me to get mad at him.
"BLOODY HELL!" I screamed as I punched a close by tree. "He is going to hate me even more now! How am I supposed to get closer to my dad when all he is going to hear about me is that Harry believes I sympathies with the Dark Lord!" I wanted to scream. "IT'S NOT FIAR!"
"You can't imagine" With that Mr.Fudge left Draco and me alone and quickly returned his attention to Mr.Malfoy.
"You are quick to tease, but what about your own crushes?"
"It's going to be okey, the asshole doesn't deserve you anyways"
"It's not that simple and you know it! If I betray the dark lord, the ones who will pay the prize are my parent's... I can't lose my mom Mia... I just can't..." I nodded silently as I watched him shed more tears. I knew this was going to be his answer, it was the same one he always gave me when ever I told him he had a choice. "And you? what side are you choosing Mia? Which path are you going to follow?" His question caught me off guard, I didn't have an answer. How was I supposed to choose? How was I supposed to decide which way was the right way to go? Choose the dark? where only death and destruction can be found but everyone I ever loved is? or the light? Where everything is broken but it's the side I believed to be the right choice?
“Well, we’ll start with a run.”
Draco loved Harry’s hugs.
“Go clean yourself up.”
“I could teach you if you’d like. I also know a good one for your eyebrows. I’m Pansy by the way.” She held her hand out. “Pansy Parkins.”
Running and working out helped keep his head clear and gave him something to do that wasn’t drink or get high. But flying, flying just made Draco think about all the ways he had failed. Then in May, Pansy told Draco that she’d gotten him a meeting with the owner of the Falmouth Falcons. The Falcons were at the bottom of the rankings, lower than the Cannons, but they had recently been bought out by a new owner who was committed to turning things around.
Draco ground his teeth. “Alright,
“I’m Professor Dubois.”
“Thank you, but I’ll be perfectly fine on my own.”
“But you’re leaving me,” Draco said flatly.
“You don’t get it.”
“And me, they called me cursed when the Wasps lost every single game the season they signed me. So you see, all of us were unwanted in some way before Mr Moore took us in.”
“I’m leaving,” Draco said. He was out of bed now and pulling on his clothes. “I can’t believe you would quit just like that. Honestly, who the
“Isn’t that muggle?”
Draco shook it. “Draco Malfoy.”
"I'm Mia Black sir... the Malfoy's were kind enough to invite me here today" the man was taken aback by my answer, probably trying to find someone in the house of black who could have had a kid in the past fourteen/fifteen years.
“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.
"Good, you can keep the insanity of the Black's all too yourself then"
“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Draco.
Slowly my mind begun to drift away, imagining time stopped right here in this beautiful moment, in this perfect moment, where we were just a couple of kids, who could afford forgetting all about the imminent war, and the pressure of our families, and the roles we were forced to play, forgetting about the hurt and the chaos of the outside world. I imagined we stayed in this bubbled of illusions and were finally happy. And then I started to wonder if things had been different, would this moment be just a moment or our whole lives? Would this momentary perfect happiness be more lasting? If my dad had never been sent away to Azkaban would he be able to love me now? If he had watched me grow, would he still care I was in Slytherin? Would I still be a Slytherin if I had been raised by my dad? Would I even be friends with Draco? I shook my head and drove those thoughts away, I couldn't change the past, so there was no point in wondering of what might have been.

"Says the one who acts like a Hufflepuff most of the time" I looked away in defeat, he had won this round and he knew it. No matter I would get him next time.
When the Irish Mascot show ended, they started to name the players of each team, each player doing their own flashy entrance, but the only entrance that managed to get the whole stadium to cheer, was Victor Krum.
As promised to my self, I painted and played with my cat, Loki, for the rest of the summer, or at least I did that most of the time. Sometimes my mother would remember my existence and then no matter what I said, or what I did, it would always be the wrong thing, and then my mother would give me one of her 'Punishments'.
People were cheering and chanting, some would get so excited they would stand up and scream at the top of their lungs. Normally this wouldn't be my type of setting, I didn't like crowds or loud places, but somehow this felt different. It felt like the excitement spilling out of peoples bodies was somehow entering mine like a virus, a virus spreading form people to people witch cheers, chanting and sining, a virus so out of control that spread to everyone in this stadium.
I was sitting on the floor supporting my back with the couch, reding book about an epic adventure, while Draco sat on said couch behind me.                                                                                                 For his part Draco did what he enjoyed most since childhood, mess with my hair, and  between the book and having someone playing with my hair, it almost made me forget. It wasn't until the clock stroke midnight that screaming started to be heard at the distance.
I turned around and started to make my way towards the carriages.
"How do you...? How?" I winked at him.
English is not my first language so I apologize beforehand.
"For what? Father is to busy falling into the enchantment of this Veela"
It felt as if someone had put invisible chains around my shoulders, making them heavy and draining my energy, I wanted to cry, why would they try anything? why couldn't we all just have this one night to forget about politics and just enjoy? I shook my head,
It never cease to amaze me how we could make each other forget about the imminent danger and make each other feel better with just a few words. It always made me wonder if we would have fallen in love if circumstances were different, it would be so easy to fall in love with him, and it would certainly make our lives easier. Of course that never happened, Draco only had eyes for boys, well more specifically, a certain boy with round glasses and a lighting scar on his forehead. And me, I've always seen him as the brother I never had.
“What’s the Marauder’s Map?”
Draco slashed his wand at Pettigrew and his arms and legs locked together. He fell to the floor with a slam, his wild eyes darted around the room.
“He saved my life,” Draco said suddenly. “He did it by killing a basilisk. Still one of the most impressive things I’ve seen him do.”
"Yes. Of course..." Draco walked next to Dumbledore, shooting glances up at him.
. It’s about being there where it mattered, consistently giving them support. It was something that happened naturally. Nothing
“Ye brave boy.” Hagrid spluttered. “I’ll never push ye again.”
“I didn’t mean it like that, Harry. I’m not defending anyone."
That's right, they were
“Why are
"No, sir. You gave them to me."
“Hello, cousin.” Draco managed.
"Yes, Dobby.
When class ended, Draco didn’t glance at Harry and Ron’s table. (It took a lot more effort than it should’ve.)
“Uh, yeah, we should,” Harry said shortly.
“Draco?” Ron managed. “Why’d you do that?”
"Penelope!" Draco gasped, taking a step back from the Petrified Ravenclaw on an infirmary bed.
“TRAITORS! MORE TRAITORS BROUGHT IN BY MY CURSED KIN! I SHALL--Oh, I know those features!” the woman gasped. She clapped her hands. “Are you a Malfoy, young man?”
“Not only are you a traitor to your house, but you also seem to be a stalker too.”
“I got you a date. Thank me later. I need to go,” Draco said, packing up to leave.
"I—I'm your best friend?" He couldn't help the awe and wonder from coming out in his voice. "But what about Weasley—"
“Sliding doors he says. Sliding doors! Oh, Draco, you are sometimes so
“How could I?” Draco complained. “There was still so much going on in my head.”
Draco twitched in his seat as he waited for Defense Against the Dark Arts to start, ignoring the concerned glimpses from Harry sitting beside him.
“Mister Malfoy! Dear child, words cannot express what it means to me for you to have you back in my classroom once more. I do hope that I can ask for your forgiveness from my prying last year.”
"You know Mrs. Norris? Filch’s cat? Yeah,
Escaping from the people he knew, he ran blindly down the corridors, shocking Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students alike.
The chamber was barely lit, Harry could hear water drip as it echoed all around him. He suddenly wished that Ron wasn't stuck on the other side of the rocks with a frazzled Lockhart. His ears strained to hear something that could sound like the basilisk, but he could only hear his footsteps as he walked further into the chamber. At the end of the chamber, he saw a figure on the floor, the back of black robes facing him and a head of blonde hair.
“He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy. I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spells that Snape needs to break through-"
“Yes I am, sir. The phoenix lives a life, but then grows old and dies.”
It took Draco a long time to compose himself, dozens of emotions trying to squeeze his throat. He angrily wiped at the runaway tear, steeling himself as he tore out of his reprieve and sped towards the Quidditch pitch.
"A Prefect?
"Can we talk?" Harry asked abruptly.
Narcissa nodded and pulled up her hood before ducking out the living room. There was a distant sound of the front door opening and closing. Draco took a shuddering breath.
“He’s done what?! You’re joking!”
be in Slytherin. How was he going to explain?
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, no, it's fine really."
Thank you for reading, comments are amazing pick-me-ups so don’t be afraid to leave one and I’ll see you all soon :)
“Harry. He,” Draco felt his body take time to process the word. “Confessed to me."
Despite living through it before, Draco didn’t have much information about Black's break-ins. He was cosied up in the Slytherin Common Room at the time. There was now a certain faith that Black had nothing to do with the death of Harry’s parents. Why else would Aunt Bellatrix spit his name in distaste? Or use him as an example when she lectured Draco on the importance of sticking to family and tradition? A wild theory that Black could be after Draco after all for breaking tradition by not being in Slytherin. But that still didn’t make sense because why would a Black harm another that was technically
"Hah! So--So you're working for--him." Then the information caught up to him. "Wait--You're with him? But you're--you used to be an Auror. Hold on, who's your father? What are you..."
"I never heard about the Death Eater thing," Seamus said.
Right. Draco shook his head to empty the thoughts of the letter and fortune. The incense air was making him get all sorts of dung brain. He shook his head.
know. We’re here to train our new seeker.” Everything went silent.
“What do you—“
“I don’t know what you mean.” Draco lied.
“The Dursleys…” Harry started. “Are not just any sort of muggles… they're magic-hating muggles. Hated everything about magic so much that I didn’t know magic even existed until my Hogwarts letter. To me, it never felt like I was, you know, a part of the family. It seemed to me that I was more like, the kid they got stuck with." Harry said easily. The boy scoffed. "My Uncle Vernon is the most boring man that could ever possibly meet yet he still tried to seem like he was better than me. His favourite pastime was to complain about me. Then there's my cousin, Dudley, seemed to love the game of Chase the Harry and then my Aunt Petunia…”
"Tonks told me about it."
“What’s Clearwater
“Add up all the corresponding letters accordingly like so...” Vector’s chalk demonstrated on the board. “And you should get your result of how that individual feels towards you in the form of a percentage.” Draco frowned at the unimpressive ten percent circled on his parchment. His calculations must’ve been wrong.
Black fur covered her face and yellow eyes were wide with cat ears poking out of her hair.
"Sorry, sorry." Longbottom pried himself off of Draco and cast his nervous eyes all over the forest. Silence went between them. "Why have you been avoiding Harry?" that caused Draco so off guard that his foot snagged on a tree knot, causing him to trip slightly.
"That." Draco pointed to the thing hooked up on the reins.
are not over that yet? Honestly,“ Draco hasn’t thought of that day since it happened. Potter pulled him closer, talking in a hushed voice.
could ever dream of. I always thought that I’d keep this to myself, but I can’t hold back any longer! I want… I want...” He turned his head away, blushing brightly.
"Really? Strange." Draco's face burned and he couldn't fully understand why.
Fletcher was walking away from the busy streets of the village down towards the Shrieking Shack, alone. Draco followed after the Slytherin, wondering where Crabbe and Goyle were. Why would Fletcher be alone?
“I know you just woke up from fighting the Dark Lord, but I need to ask about something.”
jolted him awake. Through messy blonde bangs, he squinted until he was staring into saucer-wide green eyes. "Dobby?" his voice was heavy with sleep. “What do you want?”
Snape's forehead creased. "You never tried to make jokes like this in the past. It's unlike you. It's not proper from you."
"I got into a... argument with my family of muggles. Specifically, my uncle's sister who both hates me and magic." Harry said ruefully.
Sorry for the long notes, but as usual, thank you for reading, comments are amazing pick-me-ups so don’t be afraid to leave one and I’ll see y’all soon :)
The three boys were taken aback, seeing Draco’s teary eyes. Draco felt a dark flush of frustration on his ears.
once.
Harry wouldn’t even
“ARGH!” Harry spasmed and fell out of bed.
"I know, I know. Just… this potion will get my mind off a few things. Please?” Snape gave him a hard look before closing his eyes, inhaling deeply before answering.
still alive! I'm so sorry for the basic abandonment of this fic that wasn't my intention!! it started off with writer's block then school started up again and... now it's 2017. i don't have an excuse... but now this school year is OVER AND wOW has this fic grown!! over 2000+ kudos with over 400+ bookmarks!! h o w?? thank you so much!! im still confused and surprised every time i think about it...
Harry was important to him. After knowing what it was like to be on the same side as Harry, he couldn’t go back to the opposite. And if Draco thought about it too long, he’d be reminded that Harry was too all-encompassing. He was the Boy Who Lived, an annoyingly loyal friend, someone who adored his godfather with the feeling returned, adored by everyone at the end of the day.
“Why should I? You’re here learning magic like everyone else on this train. I wouldn’t think that I needed to give you special treatment.“ Potter looked at him for a moment, seemingly accessing him. Draco looked away and watched the Weasleys argue on the platform, cursing himself for letting old grudges slip out.
“Draco’s head!”
"Harry Potter?" Tom asked needlessly but Draco still nodded. "You're choosing Harry Potter over
“Are you okay?” Anthony asked. “What happened?”
Harry ripped it out of Draco’s touch. “Draco! Just stop! Please. I-I don’t want to hear it. I’m still trying to--from the Yule Ball, the Second Task, Skeeter, and just
Hermione readily replied, “The Triwizard Tournament is a competition that challenges three wizards from the European wizarding schools of Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.”
“I don’t know about that.”
“Thanks.” Draco could hear Anthony’s smile in his voice.)
“Scabbers!” Draco shouted after the rat, wondering how the old thing managed such speed.
" Riddle laughed and Harry made fists at his sides. "But soon, Draco caught on to me a tried to get rid of me. He threw me in the fireplace, can you believe that?" Riddle clicked his tongue, shaking his head. "But that didn't work. He got rid of me again, then, it worked in a way." his head shot up to Harry, a maddening gleam in his eye. "That's where
A part of him sneered.
Terry shook his head. "With a lunatic like Black, I don't think it'll matter if we had bloody Merlin at Hogwarts he's still might on his way here.”
The group shrugged and compiled. Ron skipped the last of the stairs with a mischievous glint in his eye. “Man, I should find Michael right now before he forgets!”
“Harry, there might be a chance that you can get out of it,” Draco said although he didn’t even know where to start. If he wouldn’t be able to interfere with Diggory from entering, he needed Harry to stay calm. “But if you can’t, I know you’ll be fine.”
“And remember: don’ try ter blink. They take it as an offence.” Hagrid repeated once more as he grouped students together to introduce themselves to a hippogriff. "Now go on!"
The dormitory door groaned open.
“Dumbledore says that now they have Pettigrew in custody, they’ll reopen the case,” Hermione answered.
"Doesn't stop you." Draco smiled up at Harry. "I'll take it that you wouldn't mind me taking up Quidditch and beating you then?"
Michael came forward and tackled Draco in a hug, with Terry and Anthony following.
“He WHAT?!” Michael shrieked. “He did that?! That's... That's..."
“I should probably get back by now. They must’ve finished plotting whatever it was.” Draco pushed out his seat, starting for the door.
The blond felt his words go stale between them.
"Really?" Two more people were coming through the door now.
"Take a bath, you smell and you're tense; I can feel it in your shoulders. Eat something. Do you still have candy? You probably do." Draco was rambling at this point. "Eat a Chocolate Frog. Maybe start a Chocolate Frog card collection. I’m not into that sort of thing, but maybe you are. You look like the type. Don't you still have Dumbledore? He can be your first card--" Harry stopped a couple steps before they reached the floor, making him crash into his back.
“Shut it.”
As expected, Potter was nowhere to be seen at the Gryffindor table, neither was Weasley. He saw Granger looking around the Gryffindor table, looking for the two as well. He knew that they wouldn't be there, but for a reason he couldn't explain, he was hoping they were all right and sitting at the annoyingly bright red table.
Crookshanks entered the room, leading the group of Gryffindors.
"So Potter's going to have to fight a big bird?" Anthony ventured.
Tom blinked, surprised. "Oh? Then who is?"
Draco swallowed, sniffed wetly, and wiped away a stray tear. This felt familiar. Bracing himself, he carefully shook Harry’s hand. “Friends.”
"That's
“Let’s hope not.”
He thought as he pushed himself further in the shadows cast by an armor that was beside the Great Hall.
“Michael said something stupid because he’s an idiot.”
“You’re welcome.”
There was a part of Draco that wanted to sigh and apologize, but Draco was on a Malfoy streak. And Malfoy could hold a grudge and a temper for as long as he wanted.
What was her version of a good Malfoy?
Draco felt himself leaning against his bedpost, feeling lightheaded.
"Because I'm in Ravenclaw."
“She kept denying that he’s back,” Harry said. “She was calling me a liar. I won’t stand being called a liar especially when it comes to Voldemort.”
Fletcher grasped at his handle, dangling hundreds of feet in the air. He looked wildly down at his feet. The stands rumbled with gasps and shocked shouts. Before Draco could go and help, Fletcher pulled himself back onto his broom clumsily as he wouldn't uncurl one of his fists. The reason why was revealed when Fletcher roared in victory, showing a Snitch between his fingers.
“Yes, he’s gone…” They sat in comfortable silence. The blonde shifted closer and placed his head on Harry's shoulder with a quiet sigh. "Thanks again, Harry."
“What are programs?”
They entered the Yule Ball with festive fanfare, Draco winked and grinned at the scowling faces of Hogwarts boys glaring at him. When he passed by Terry, the boy just shook his head.
Draco dropped to his knees, bracing his hands on the ground. A tension that Draco never noticed seeped out. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath of relief. Cedric was alive. That was more than Draco expected and thought was going to happen this year.
"Because he's the reason I didn't get in trouble for using magic this summer."
“Strange lies your father has been telling you.” Moody tilted his head. “Why would he shy away from telling you much when he’s doing all of this for you.”
“Er, of course, Lucius. Everyone," Mr. Weasley nodded his head towards the exit. "Wait for us near the staircase.”
Oliver Wood throughout the game was yelling at Harry to show force with Draco in order to win the game. Midway through the game, Draco noticed it. Hovering near Oliver Wood’s foot, the Snitch fluttered.
“Why not?”
Ugh, he hasn’t been this bad since first year. Every word coming out of him was clunky and abnormal. He should’ve thought this through before he opened his mouth. Maybe that was enough for today.
When the two landed on the pitch, Draco rushed up towards the boy. "What do you think you were
"Oh, what’s a little student doing out of—“ Draco didn’t have time to whirl around to tell Peeves to shut up before he screamed, “ATTACK ATTACK! AN ATTACK ONCE MORE! EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THEIR GRAVESTONES!”
“What?”
Before memories could start attacking him, he shook his head. Rubbing one side of his temple with his fingers to ward away an oncoming headache. "Okay... I’m just going to find Anthony.” Draco pointed a thumb at the direction he was going. "I’ll see you later. Good luck on the game, Harry." Without stopping, Draco walked away. He never heard of the Sorcerer's Stone before, and he really wanted to keep it that way.
The sound of crunching snow stopped as Draco continued walking away.
“I know, I know,” Tonks mumbled, petting Draco’s head.
Draco suddenly felt like he didn't deserve Cho's blanket.
“We both are terrible at following through things we say. I don’t put it against you. I know how hard it can be. And I can never hate you.”
"The what?" Harry asked.
“It’s fine, Harry. You don't have to—"
“What was that?”
Harry's eyes gleamed. “We never weren’t friends.”
“You’re right evil,” Ron said, shaking his head.
Draco felt frustrated tears sting anew at his eyes. He
A surprised laugh blipped from Narcissa. “It’s one of the reasons I’m not trying to.”
Krum tilted his head. “Is… Is that it?”
” Black’s fingers lowered to the rat in Draco’s hand.
"What are you talking about?" Draco followed him. Harry seemed to forget that he was there and turned back to him, smiling so widely it looked like it hurt.
“Of all the things Potter could’ve done this is by far the most...” Draco heard Anthony sigh and click his tongue. “He must’ve done something that really unsettled Draco. I just don’t know what could make him that upset. He’s so secretive about the important things.” There was a groan. “Arg! Every time I think I’m starting to understand him, I always end up going back to square one.”
Terry straightened in his chair as he saw Potter walk up to Draco and pull him away from the circle of Triwizard champions. Draco gave an incredulous glimpse at Terry before being whisked out of the Great Hall.
As the last girl dashed over to the Hufflepuff table, Dumbledore rose from his seat. He held up his hands for complete silence.
“Wait. You saw all of that?” It was a stupid question with an obvious answer but he needed to know. He needed to see if this was actually happening.
"Don’t let what Flint said get to you. You’re not a traitor or anything like that. Don’t know how you can be anyhow,“ Harry huffed, seeming like he ran there from Hagrid’s hut. Angry jibes that were being made in his head disappeared.
“No, I could never let you do that—“
Draco was bumping elbows with Anthony and Michael in the stands of the Quidditch field. "So, if Slytherin and Gryffindors are enemies; are we enemies with Hufflepuffs?" Michael said out loud as the teams were still in the locker rooms.
“I do.” Harry shook his head. “I mean—yes, I want to be more than just friends.” Emboldened, he gathered Draco’s hands in his own. “There’s nothing that I want more.”
Terry’s head shot up and he turned towards the blond. “You didn’t hear such a thing!”
"So... what really happened down there?" It was there that Harry spilled everything. From the mirror to burning Quirrell's face, his eyes seemed glued to the white bedsheet. Draco shivered and even full-on cringed at some parts, but otherwise was calm.
The footsteps started once more until they became inaudible.
"Someone move Pettigrew," Draco said.
, Tom. We can talk later when we're--"
He was about to complain about the poor planning and give up when an unusually tiny, but familiar Snitch darted into his vision, a tinny buzz circling around his head.
"Sorry, it just," the blonde tried helplessly to grasp for words. "happened."
“I’ve been reading about European wizarding institutions since the World Cup. It’s in the footnotes of
Draco and Hermione returned to the sitting area of the Weasley’s tent. Draco was frowning and rubbing at his cheek, sending Hermione a peeved glare. Hermione just scoffed and rolled her eyes as she went back to her spot beside Ginny at the far side of the tent.
“Of course—er— we should be heading back.” Harry fumbled to get back to his feet.
and her artwork!
Draco lowered his head, hoping to hide his pink face. “Thank you.” He cleared his throat. “Okay, I need to go.”
“I’m not exactly someone that's pined after,” Draco said instead.
"Heard that, Malfoy!" Ron hollered but seemed to happy to be upset.
draco: its fourth year! I finally know what’s going on!
Fletcher Nil’s face soured, most likely hearing Michael's words. Draco’s pointed stare past Micheal made the group turn around and see the Slytherin boy. With a glowing glare, Nil turned away, now stomping back to school.
Terry slept soundly even as Michael’s leg and arm got thrown over him during the boy’s slumber.
Andromeda liked to listen to French Muggle singer, Yvonne Printemps, whose high warbles rivalled Celestina Warbeck’s and was a stickler for proper etiquette, Ted liked to sneak into the kitchen late at night to cut an inconspicuous piece of a persistent chocolate cake on the kitchen island.
Draco smiled a few hours later, satisfied as Ron led him in the smoothest waltz they've had yet. “Well, it looks like you
Draco leaned over Michael's shoulder and found a picture of Harry gloomily staring out of a window. Harry's picture heaved a soundless sigh as he rested his head in a hand.
"Dumbledore goes on how the professors are beyond impressed on how advanced his magic is and how he got top marks in his entire year." She went beside Draco and set her hands on the back of his chair.
he wanted to say, but he couldn't.
“Of course, Narcissa."
Hermione gasped. “I DON’T BELIEVE THIS! IT WAS THE
"Excellent. You are indeed very smart for your age.”
At least some people benefited from going to the Yule Ball.
Chills ran down Draco’s back as a guttural growl reverted over the grounds.
"I'm sorry."
Anthony pressed his lips together, Terry crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders, Michael scratched the back of his head.
"So you can’t feel anything?” Draco asked once he too was at his side.
“No, it’s not yer fault. It’s me fault. I shoudn’ have done hippogriffs on th’ first day,” Hagrid wiped at a tear with a towel-sized handkerchief. “I pushed ye when I shouldn’ have. I set meself up fer disaster.”
“Okay, what?”
“I’m not mad.” They gave him an unbelieving stare. “I’m serious. It’s not a big deal.” He liked spending time with Harry but he didn’t need to spend time with Harry at length. Draco wondered how did his friendship with Harry look like in his friends’ heads. “But I would feel less guilty if he were here.”
"Then no. Do it yourself."
, a write-in column in each
while you are at school? I don’t wish for others to think I did not raise my son properly.“
“You should before someone else does. I think Viktor Krum is going to.”
"To see how they’re holding up. You haven't talked to them in ages."
"Oh, the shame I’d feel if my forefathers saw this. Trying to tarnish this good Malfoy boy!”
“Well, fine, he didn’t say no,” Terry conceded but quickly added on, “But running away isn’t exactly a yes either!”
"I'll take him," Snape said, ducking beneath Lockhart's arm. Draco gave Harry and Ron one last look before Snape reached him and couldn't be seen behind the black robes.
Terry frowned. “Since
"I don't want to do it—"
"Your glasses are broken." The broken lens obscured the view of Harry's eyes.
“A note…”
“I have until February to think about it,” Harry shrugged. “Hey… I've been meaning to ask. Anthony and them told me that you were fine during my task. You didn’t react to me getting chased out of the stadium by a dragon. Did you already foresee it and... not actually impressed?"
“The hugest!” Michael cheered.
“Because we have this." Draco gestured to the lake. "We both have each other to talk with, to be friends with, to help each other out. We do have this right?" Draco asked more for his benefit than anything else.
going to join the Quidditch team?” Michael pointed a finger at him. “And beat Harry Potter while doing it?”
Last year was a complete mess, he barely kept up with moments when something was going to happen. His flashbacks weren't going to around forever. He needed to write all them down. Give Dumbledore everything in writing.
Anthony held up his hands in complacency. "So sorry about that but I have been looking for you. Glad I caught you before Potter did.” Anthony wrapped a casual arm around Draco’s shoulder (with more ease as he seemed to grow a few inches over the summer). ”Merlin knows that you don’t sit with us often.” Anthony pulled at Draco to start walking. “I have to tell you all about my Bar Mitzvah I had this summer—you know, the one I mentioned in my letter—and warn you that Michael’s growing his hair out. It isn’t as bad as we say it is, but we can’t have him getting an inflated head so…” Draco nodded, understanding.
According to an online 1993 calendar, Hanukkah started around the
“The dragon I saw--" Draco mumbled to himself, but stopped when the three of them were looking at him.
The only plus Draco could find about being from the future was that exams were simple. All he had to do is skim through some chapters to refresh his memory, but other than that, Draco was always the first to finish in the exam hall.
“Love?” Narcissa looked down at her son. “What’s wrong?”
"You're going to jinx yourself. Have you figured out the clue from the egg?”
He took the diary in one hand, ready to throw it in the fire. His arms didn’t move. Four more tries and he still couldn’t pry his fingers open to let go.
“I like you.”
Draco gave the boy an assessing look. “I didn’t think you’d go for girls like that, Harry.”
Michael pulled back. “How’ve you been then?”
The third years buzzed all day with excitement at the first trip to Hogsmeade. They all seemed to rush after the last class of the day to get ready for the late afternoon.
"Floo Powder. I wasn't speaking clearly." Harry shifted from foot to foot, trying to flatten his hair and rub off the soot, seeming embarrassed.
Narcissa squeezed her son’s shoulder, keeping him close to her as they pushed through the crowds of people at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. “Draco, you’ll be careful this year won’t you?” she asked seriously, watching parents reluctantly let their children onto the scarlet red train.
Feeling kicked out, he wandered the Hogwarts Express until he found another set of three faces. Draco pulled opened the sliding door. “Mind if I sit?” he asked the occupants.
"It's not easy. I... need time. It’s not easy to confess secrets, especially with secrets like mine. But can we forget about these past few weeks?” Draco felt his cheeks past the colour pink to a dark shade of red.
“I will.”
“No!” Draco said with enough speed to tell them he was lying.
"Exactly! Thank you, Ron!” Michael crossed his arms. “I’m willing to bet 10 galleons that Bulgaria will win because of him.”
“I’m what?” Draco did a double-take.
tried to steal it. When word reached Draco, his fork clattered loudly on his plate. "Mate, it's okay. Potter's probably fine." Terry soothed, but Draco had no doubt about that, it was him that didn't feel fine. When he tried to visit the two in Hospital Wing, he was turned away because of all the Gryffindors were visiting.
Harry stepped closer but still kept a large space between them. “So… Why did you call me out here?” he asked.
“Many still don’t think they’re good people… But my family is trying to make amends.  I don’t erase what they did or dismiss their crimes because they’re my parents…  They know what they did… but… Does it mean something that they’re trying?”
Fletcher pulled his face into winning glee. He chest puffed out in the way where he knew he had power and could flaunt it, with dozens following after him. As if anything could be given to him on the shiniest silver plate. Just like how Draco did it. It was a sad sight to see from the outside.
“It’s not exactly what you think of… I... I can see what
“Thank you for showing me and my sister around ze castle all zis time,” Fleur said, her arms linked with Gabrielle, the young blonde girl she rescued during the Second Task. “And for accompanying me as I place my name in ze goblet.”
“The Killing Curse. An inescapable fate. In fact, there’s only one person that’s even known to survive the Killing Curse. And he’s sitting in this room.”
… and if you want...
Harry’s demeanour cooled. He uncomfortably shifted in his seat. “Lines. That wasn’t the bad part, it was the principal.”
Harry’s reaction was instant with a stumble in his step and dropping his bucket of water he was carrying onto the ground. The three stopped as they jumped away from spilt water with shouts of surprise.
..." Draco looked at Petrified Hermione with scared eyes. "I wouldn't do it to
He forgot how long sorting took. Hearing name after name, it all became one giant word.
“Mister Malfoy,” Professor Lupin’s rang out in the emptying classroom. “A word, if you don’t mind?”
“Yes, but that’s not the thing that excites me. There’s something in the Muggle world that’s probably the best thing they’ve ever come to create.” Draco smiled as the image came to his head. “I’ve never wanted anything more.”
“Who said they 'found' her? As the professors left us, they were suspecting Potter's group of doing that to the cat,” Anthony said, falling into his bed across from Draco.
Scabbers curled into a tight ball and went back to napping as if he wasn’t sleeping for the entire day.
That weekend, Draco was standing across Harry on the Quidditch field, glaring at Harry’s shiny, new Firebolt. For once since they came back, he was looking at Draco. He felt some satisfaction that he saw Harry gulp.
There was nothing appealing about what he saw tonight.
nobler then pretending that they’ve never existed and pretending you're perfect.”
"He's right," Potter jabbed in. "He's really nice." Draco Malfoy: Nice. Draco thought he’d never see the day.
“I better see Nil’s arse get destroyed by Potter to be in this rain!” Michael shouted over the freezing breeze and loud hiss of rain. Draco’s clothes were already drenched and clinging to his frozen skin.

“What do you feel, Draco?” Anthony asked.
"Terry, mate, Hogwarts is the last place Black would want to go to,” Anthony said, forcing himself to laugh weakly. “We have Dumbledore. He's probably the most powerful wizard out there. Almost everyone in the world knows that. It’d be stupid to come to Hogwarts.”
“We have another Hogsmeade trip in a few weeks, right? I’ll go then.”
,” Michael swore, thinking that Draco went off to sleep.
“Then?” Dumbledore moved to sit behind his desk.
“You two, knock it off!” Anthony hissed.
"Weasley," Lucius nodded before straying over to Harry and Hermione standing beside him. "Potter, Granger," He said in the same polite tone.
Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry…”
“Oh,” Michael said and Terry cuffed the back of his head.
Draco took a shuddering gasp, tears stung his eyes. Strangled breaths managed past his throat. Draco wildly looked around the compartment. Professor Lupin, wide awake, still pointing his wand. Ron's eyes were bugged wide as Hermione was taking deep breaths. Harry was no longer beside the blond.
Cho furrowed her brow but stood and followed their professor down the Ravenclaw Tower and to the Headmaster’s Tower. They entered and saw four chairs lined up in front of Dumbledore with two already filled. One chair held an older woman in furs that regarded them with a frown. The other chair held Gabrielle.
"How was your--" Harry's question was cut off with him staring at the quiet book. "How is it staying still?"

, standing up and placing it in Harry's arms. "Uh, where do you see the Charms section?" Draco didn't wait for his response and travelled deeper into the bookshop.
“That thing doesn’t look like it’ll make it to Halloween. I don't want to be a witness to a rat's death.” Anthony eyed the scrappy rodent, turning out his light.
"I just want to stay here that's all," Draco said quickly.
"No, I’m giving Chang and Diggory three years before they get together.”
Horrific, ghastly shrieking made everyone go to their ears.
"How have you been?"
“She said she’s going to wish Harry extra luck,” Ron said. “You sure that Harry’s going to be alright?”
"I'm... sorry." Draco cast his eyes down. It was a trick that he's learned to make Anthony forgive him for just about anything.
"I’ll swear to me job, it wasn’ him!“
Draco thought he misheard her. “What?”
Harry seemed to look around the area, trying to find them but the crowd was too immense. Without warning, the Hungarian Horntail shrieked and pounced at the boy. Harry scuffled around the area, breaking away brittle rocks as he crawled over away from the Horntail’s spiked tail.
There was an abrupt sense of trepidation curling inside him. The air was gone between them leaving his straining for breath. His shoulders tensed, a rush of manic adrenaline surging through him.
“Apologies," Andromeda said. "It’s just really sudden. I haven’t seen you for so long and you come with such... news.”
“Oi, Draco Malfoy!” Draco turned around to see a scruffy dwarf hanging off a coat of armor. “Love note for you!” The cupid waved a white envelope before jumping down and shoving students’ legs out of his way to get to Draco.
He skidded past the poking heads of students nosily wondering what just happened. The back of Draco’s throat burned as he tried to keep tears at bay. He busied his fingers and tore into the chocolate piece and was relieved when warmth appeared in his chest at the firs taste. He quickly found the compartment and hurriedly stepped inside.
Draco rushed out to see Harry and Ron standing awkwardly at the bottom of the steps by Granger. “Harry! Wea—Ron!” They turned around and beamed as he rushed down to meet them.
"Dobby is very sorry for disturbing you. For that, Dobby threw himself down some stairs before coming here." the servant was twisting his hands into his pillowcase uniform. Darting his eyes back and forth, shifting from foot to foot.
“He’s… I don’t think he’s a bad guy, Harry.” Draco said, but his shortened breath and most likely broken ribs said something different.
They stopped in a chamber off to the side of the hall. McGonagall did the expected speech about the houses of Hogwarts (Draco having to hold off Potter’s questions of, “What’s Gryffindor?” and “Is Hufflepuff a real animal?”).
"Mum and Sirius have been at each other's throats because of it," Ron added. "Mum's says that Sirius is too irresponsible. Sirius says that he's Harry's legal guardian and therefore can let Harry make his own decisions."
Fast trekking footsteps left the village and continued its pace until stopped in the empty clearing near the Shrieking Shack, where Draco was before with Fletcher Nil. Draco took in the view.
“Nothing. Harry just kept saying these funny things.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, please go to your room.” When he didn’t move, she added, “
Draco sniffed wetly and rubbed at his eyes. “More than anyone.”
"Narcissa?" She said, alarmed.
Draco felt a humiliating flush on his ears as he could feel gazes wash over him. A flash memory of seeing his father showing his mother his Dark Mark before they left the Quidditch World Cup. It still looked brand new. Strange. For an odd moment, Draco had forgotten that he came from a family of Death Eaters.
Terry shrieked and slammed his hand over Anthony's mouth. “Merlin, don’t! It’s because I made it my mission to
"Draco!" Someone was shaking his shoulder. He gasped loudly and flinched away, making the two boys look at him funny. "Are you 'right?" Weasley asked. "You zoned out."
“I agree,” Fleur nodded.
Anthony steeled himself and walked over to Potter despite Terry's quiet protests. “Hey, Potter?”
There was a rustle of Draco’s owl of him getting jealous of having little attention compared to Errol.
“Ron’s not saying that anyone’s forgotten! But…” Hermione furrowed her brow. “I think… many would call it a second chance. People should get a second chance if they really put themselves into it. As in, they don’t put their second chance to waste. I think knowing you’ve done wrong and acknowledging from it is
“Of course not, Mister Malfoy. If it makes you… happy… I won’t interfere.” Snape seemed to strangle the words out. It was an odd way to phrase it but Draco shrugged it off. “But you are aware that going outside without supervision is forbidden this year given with all the… paranoia.” Snape said pointedly. “And it was a priority that Mister Potter shouldn’t go anywhere outside of the castle.”
Andromeda grinned. “Hundreds. But do you have any other questions before that?”
“But he'll get Hagrid in--" Being the reason for Hagrid to lose his teaching job (
“I’m beautiful,” he said to himself, in shock.
A menacing, thorny amusement lightened Narcissa’s expression. “I look forward to learning what ‘tragic circumstances’ you invented, as the wizarding world has been treating you like a missing person for the past half a decade, after
“My employer,” Lucius replied. “Narcissa preferred that I work… elsewhere.”
The Drakoi could not mate with ordinary dragons; that would be akin to mating with beasts. No, they could mate only with other weredragons, or with magical humans, and humans were preferred because they gave weredragons shelter in the human world and a more thorough cover identity. Wizards and witches thus made the ideal mates. Muggles were out of the question; they had no magic in them, and would not survive a mating with a weredragon.
His mother shrugged, serene, her gigantic wings moving with her shoulders. Had Draco not been tucked within their shadow, he would have been knocked aside. “The world is full of fire, my love. It is up to you whether you let it light your path, or whether you let it burn you to ashes.”
Dragon mothers were notoriously fierce, after all. And to Draco, who was then only a mewling, snivelling, sticky mess, she seemed the epitome of all power and grace. Her very shape was an immensity, as though the entire universe had poured itself into the mold of her form—stars, planets and all. Her scales certainly glittered like stars in the dim, pre-dawn light, and she had a strange gravity to her, as though any creature foolish enough to look her in the eye would be drawn in helplessly for the devouring. She was beautiful, and terrifying, and Draco adored her with all the blind, animal devotion of a newborn.
. Since his hatching, he hadn’t seen—
“Leave them,” Narcissa said grimly, and it shocked Draco, though he could see the sorrow in her eyes as she said it. “Hatchling… You cannot risk yourself, myself, and what remains of the Drakoi line for the lives of a handful of humans.”
“His death was not the death of his organisation,” Lucius said sharply. “I had to construct a believable story to render me… compromised in their eyes, not through any failing of my own—as that would have got me killed, and likely you and Draco, too—but due to tragic circumstances.”
risk more. Instead, he allowed his mother to distract him with flying lessons.
It was this advice of his mother’s that would stay with Draco, always, even after he learned that she was also a woman named Narcissa, and that he was also a boy named Draco—a boy with a body that felt oddly… soft-boiled, not hard enough or armoured enough but fragile and helpless, a snail without its shell.
