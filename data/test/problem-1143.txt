The words tumble out before Harry can fully process them. “And while I’d like to invite you to not-celebrate my birthday with me next month, I’m afraid I’m a tad impatient and don’t want to wait that long.”
“I mean with your slightly swollen lip and my bruises it wouldn’t be too hard,” Harry says to Draco with a snort.
“Drinks next Friday? Say...eight? Muggle place of my choosing?” Harry’s stomach does about thirty somersaults over the course of the next second as Draco pretends to ponder his proposal.
"I think you need to re-evaluate your definition of sweet, Potter," Draco says, leaning his head back on the wall then turning it towards Harry with a soft smile that crinkles the corners of his eyes.
He can hear Potter's sharp intake of breath, and it takes every ounce of his remaining willpower not to bolt right then and there. Potter must sense it because he's quick to grab his arm and hold him in place, pinning him with his determined gaze. "No, you didn't. You didn't have a choice."
The boy captures his lips with his own this time, though with a little more confidence. It’s still gentle however, like he wants to savour every moment, and Harry is more than happy to let him.
A moment later, Harry notices Draco's hand on his waist slipping under the hem of his jumper, surprisingly warm fingers sliding against the bare skin above his hipbone. A shiver runs through Harry's body that has nothing to do with the biting cold around them, and his heart hammers against his chest.
Their eyes never leave each other as they move almost as one to close the distance between their bodies. Harry drops Draco’s hand in lieu of gently wrapping it around the back of his neck. Then, seeking more contact, his other hand soon finds its way to Draco’s cheek, brushing along a high cheekbone then carefully replacing a loose strand of silky hair behind his ear.
Potter looks shaken as he digests this statement. "Sometimes, I find myself imagining how different things could've been if I'd just talked to you instead. If I could've saved you," He continues, swallowing thickly and looking about ready to kick himself for not being able to keep his mouth shut.
“But I–“ Draco’s voice cracks and Harry immediately sits up, concern growing. “You deserve so much better than me,” He says, his voice wavering.
"That doesn't change the fact that I still hurt people!" He fires back, fighting to keep his volume low and hating the way his voice wavers.
I going to do with you? Can't even take you out to a bar without you causing a scene," Draco says with a 'tsk' before moving to sit next to him. Harry peeks up at him and immediately wants to smack the amused grin off his stupid, pretty, annoyingly sober face. It would be just his luck that Draco would be a heavyweight unlike himself.
Draco laughs quietly and Harry ignores the way his chest flutters at the sound. "Yes, apparently so," He says with an amused smile. "Do try to refrain from vomiting on me, this coat was rather expensive and I'd prefer it not get ruined."
Harry glances over at him from the corner of his eye and it seems as if he's holding his breath unintentionally. He looks shocked, or like he's figuring out an extremely difficult potions recipe. Harry can practically hear the gears turning in his head. But a second later he seems to come to a conclusion, and then he's letting the breath out and ever-so-slightly leaning into Harry's touch.
Draco hesitates before steeling himself and reaching around to undo the magical knot. He is momentarily taken aback by just how green his eyes are this close and without his glasses. Harry’s eyes finally adjust to the lighting, although still blurry due to his lack of glasses, and he is met by vulnerable yet piercing grey eyes. His throat closes up as he sees another tear cascade down his cheek. Draco angrily goes to brush it away but Harry beats him to it, bringing his other hand up to carefully wipe it off.
Now that he knows exactly who he’s with, he doesn’t even hesitate before pulling him fully onto his lap so that Malfoy’s legs are on either side of his hips. They break apart momentarily to settle into a more comfortable position then Malfoy is kissing him again like his life depends on it. Harry can’t help the groan that escapes his lips, lifting a hand up to grasp a handful of platinum blond hair.
“It wouldn’t make you much of a gentleman to shag me on the first date?” Harry finishes for him with a crooked grin.
He wracks his brain for something to do to help reassure him, but right as an idea starts to formulate he ends up knocking into someone walking in the opposite direction. He stutters out an apology but the man just gives him then Draco a dirty look before spitting "Oi, watch it! Fuckin' fairies."
He finds a sort of solace in the fact that Potter looks about as miserable sitting in the circle of Eighth Years as he feels. But he quickly tears his gaze away before his traitorous brain can start whinging about how unfairly attractive Potter looks in his worn olive green jumper.
“I’ll admit, I expected you to be a little more surprised that the person you apparently have the most chemistry with is a guy,” The boy says, seemingly amused.
"Well I've changed my mind." Draco says, lifting his head up to glare rather pitifully then dropping it back down onto Harry's shoulder.
“Absolutely,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s hand back. And then he’s pulling him back in and kissing him so sweetly Harry’s heart melts a little bit more.
Harry dips his head forward, closer, closer, closer, until their foreheads meet. Each hot, shallow breath from Draco’s parted lips ghosts tantalizingly across Harry’s. He can taste the liquor on his breath and is surprised to find it less than repulsive. Instead it serves to makes him want to taste it on his lips. His mouth. His tongue.
“I’m glad you decided to not-celebrate your birthday with me...I...had a lot of fun if I’m being honest.” Harry laughs self-consciously, feeling his face heating once again.
"Your support truly warms my cold, dead heart," Draco replies, holding a hand over his chest and wiping away an imaginary tear.
He doesn't think about the catch in Potter's breath when his lips finally meet skin. Or how he can feel the hammering of Potter's heart when he finds a pulse point.
He switches between kissing, licking, and biting, until Harry is sure there’s going to be a mark there. The knowledge makes him feel oddly giddy. He almost makes a joke about him secretly being a vampire. But then Malfoy kisses back up the side of his neck, finding an especially sensitive spot behind his ear, and Harry finds himself breathless and almost painfully aroused.
Desire and warmth coil in Harry’s stomach as Draco’s tongue runs along his bottom lip. Harry is quick to part his lips, answering the unspoken question with a sigh. Draco’s tongue obligingly slips between his lips, tentatively exploring his mouth as one of his hands tangles itself in his unruly hair. Harry barely withholds a groan as he ever-so-gently tugs at the captured locks. He can feel the smallest of smirks pull at Draco’s lips as they continue to move against his.
"Truth!" Someone says impatiently, and Draco drags his attention back to the game. He fishes around for a decent question to ask, finding the source of the voice to be Parvati Patil.
The hand at Draco's neck trails up to cradle his jaw, tilting his head just-so to deepen the kiss. Potter lets out a contented sigh, and Draco can feel him smile softly against his lips. Draco uses this opportunity to swipe his tongue along Potter's bottom lip, drawing a quiet gasp from him as he readily opens his mouth to grant him access.
"Play nice, and perhaps I'll share my homebrewed hangover potion," Draco teases. "Doesn't even taste like troll bogeys like that store-bought rot."
"Not even a little bit? I'm hurt," Draco says, voice muffled by the covers. "Now shut up, I'd like to get
"Right, yeah," Potter answers faintly, a dark flush beginning to creep up his neck and dust his cheeks. Draco pointedly tries
“Because maybe you’re not the only one who’s been pining after an oblivious idiot,” Harry says with a light laugh, pulling his head back down so that their foreheads touch.
"We love you and support your decisions, Harry!" Hermione calls over her shoulder, probably a little louder than necessary.
"Gods no," Harry replies, pulling him back in and nearly tripping on a crack in the pavement he could've sworn wasn't there before.
"Good," Draco says, squeezing the hand on his shoulder so briefly Harry isn't entirely sure if it actually happened or if he imagined it. He squeezes it back for good measure then focuses on not falling flat on his arse. Merlin knows his pride is bruised enough as it is, he doesn't need literal bruises too.
"There, now we're even you wanker," Draco says, nudging him with his elbow and trying to calm down his laughter.
Draco is more than happy to oblige, thumbs grazing teasingly along hipbones where too-large trousers hang tantalizingly low. Potter's restraint seems to finally dissolve at his touch, tongue returning the exploration with fervour. He leaves Draco reeling as he manages to simultaneously be compliant yet characteristically demanding, neither him nor Draco ever seeming to get the upper hand.
That night (though not unlike most other nights if he's being honest) he dreams of mischievous green eyes, scruffy black hair, and a private, fond smile that has him falling all over again.
A few shots of Firewhiskey later and he had miraculously made it through ‘I Have Never’ and ‘Truth or Dare’ without much incident on his part. The same couldn’t be said for the others however. Particularly Seamus giving Blaise a surprisingly good lap dance, Ron having to perform a strip tease (though thankfully leaving on his pants), and Malfoy having to kiss Goyle after which Malfoy had claimed he “wasn’t drunk enough for this shit” and had left to presumably get another drink for himself. Harry had laughed at that statement, having noticed earlier that he was the only bloke to stick to bottled Butterbeer so it was his own damn fault. But he hadn’t called him out for it. Something told Harry he had some reason for doing it and had probably hoped no one would notice.
“Are you now?” Draco says after the words seem to sink in, eyebrows raised. “Well, I mustn’t keep our Glorious Savior waiting then. What is it you propose we do to solve this...predicament?”
“I’ll do anything,” Draco says, his hot breath brushing against Harry’s ear before he gently bites the lobe causing him to shudder from pleasure. “Just tell me what you want me to do.” Harry’s hips jerk up unbidden, seeking out more of that delicious friction he craves.
Draco glances at Harry and, upon seeing him shiver again, frowns. With a ‘tsk’ he unwraps the scarf around his neck and winds it around Harry’s before his sense has time to stop him.
going to tell me that my best friend is into blokes? Or was I just supposed to find out in a game of Truth or Dare myself?" Weasley asks, again gaining no response apart from a swift punch to the shoulder from Potter.
Their second kiss burns all the way down Draco's throat and coils warmly in his stomach, better than any scotch or Firewhiskey he's ever tasted. It's intoxicating, every nerve in his body alive and crackling with energy.
yourself, Malfoy," Potter murmurs, bringing his other hand up to wrap around the back of Draco's neck.
And, after a suffocatingly awkward exchange in which Draco had approached Harry in order to thank him for speaking on his behalf then shocked everyone by genuinely apologizing to Ron and Hermione, one would almost consider them to be on friendly terms.
Harry has to bite down on a grin that wants to split across his face, not wanting to look like a complete loon. Of course, he ultimately fails to keep the grin off of his face, not that Draco sees it since he seems to be too busy looking forward, likely overthinking every little thing. It's a quality that Harry finds quite endearing, if a little frustrating at times. Though he can't exactly blame him for being a little over-analytical, sometimes to the point of flat out paranoia. He also can’t blame him when he himself possesses very similar traits.
“Oh believe me, she tries every year,” Draco says. “I’m just more stubborn than her on this. Though I’m sure she’ll manage to trick me into doing something soon to make up for it as usual.”
“In that case, I believe it’s about time I bid you goodnight.” Draco pulls him in for a final kiss that leaves Harry aching for next Friday, before turning and Disapparating on the spot. Harry manages to catch the self-satisfied smirk regardless.
He rolls onto his back as his left hand continues to stroke his leaking cock, and when he closes his eyes, he can almost pretend it's Harry's. He imagines a scenario where Harry decides to follow him back to his room instead. He can see the predatory glint in Harry's eyes as he pushes him back and crawls on top of him. He can almost hear him whispering filthy things in his ear as his hand quickens its pace.
“Shit, you alright?” Malfoy asks, causing Harry to wonder how the hell he hadn’t recognized his voice sooner.
"I can't even argue with that because...well..." Harry wiggles the arm on Draco's shoulder and pats the arm around his waist as if to explain. "I'm more of an armful really," He says seriously before snorting much louder than the terrible joke deserved. A person passing by gives him a disapproving look but he pays them no mind.
Harry, in turn, leans further onto Draco, resting his head on his shoulder and wrapping his arms around his waist. "No. Fuck you. You're warm and stable and I'd probably fall over and die somehow. And that would kind of defeat the purpose of you walking me home, right?"
Draco snaps awake, sweat soaking through his clothes and to the bedcovers. He shoves the covers off then sits up, curling into a tight ball.  He shivers violently at the sudden cold now assaulting his trembling body. A strangled "shit," is all he manages to say before the panic overcomes his mind and his body seizes up completely.
Draco easily uses his grip on Harry’s waist to his advantage, gently pushing him back as he joins him on the steps. Harry gasps as the ice cold metal of the railing digs itself into his back, chilling him through his jumper. But he barely spares the discomfort a second thought as he finds Draco’s mercifully warm body being pressed against his front.
And who just had to be the first person picked but none other than Harry Potter himself. Before he knew it he had been blindfolded – glasses hastily shoved in Ron and Hermione’s general direction – and pushed into a closet.
"Well, I'm afraid that's something you'll just have to get used to," Draco says matter-of-factly, stepping away and pulling Harry in the direction of his room.
Draco is the first to break the eye contact with a cough. “Right, I should probably...” He trails off, hands waving aimlessly before promptly being shoved into his coat pockets.
"Alright, alright, I’ll let you get your beauty sleep." Blaise's bed creaks as he presumably readjusts into a proper sleeping position and Draco lets out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.
Draco can think of plenty of things that he wants, not the least of which is for Harry to stay with him the whole night, but figures asking for that would be pushing it. Instead, he just shakes his head, rolling over to get more comfortable. "Never mind."
"Half of them were drunk enough they probably won't even remember it come tomorrow," Draco says with a snort.
"If you want," Potter teases. "Though if you're gonna stick your prick in my arse, the least you can do is start calling me Harry," He adds, dragging him closer until their bodies are almost flush.
Slightly emboldened by this seemingly positive reaction, Draco covers the recently bitten skin with his tongue, soothing the irritated skin before tugging at it with his teeth again. The fingers around his bicep tighten, and Potter seems to be holding his breath once more. Draco feels like he should thank him, not sure how he'd handle his breath on him again, let alone any of the noises the prat seems to be struggling not to make.
An image flashes in his head and Draco's heart aches as he recalls a time, long ago, when his mother would hold him whenever he was scared and rock him gently until his tears dissipated and he was able to fall asleep. Sometimes she even sang soft lullabies in French, or in Latin if it was really bad.
Waving goodbye to any ounces of sanity he had left, he leans forward and dips his head down, figuring the neck is as good of a place as any to place a "love-bite" on his ex-arch-nemesis. (Now
He turns around to check for the door he came through only to find it has disappeared, replaced by a room he knows all too well. It's then that he notices Harry standing across from him, looking at him with complete and utter disgust.
There's a moment of silence as they stare dumbly at each other. Potter sways slightly in the doorway but doesn't make any moves to keep walking.
Harry continues to run a hand through his hair and Draco feels himself slowly falling asleep. When his breathing evens out Harry's hand continues for a while, wanting to make sure he's actually asleep before returning to his own bed.
"Think I'm gonna go ahead and clock out for the night actually," Potter says to Weasley in a way Draco knows was meant not to draw attention to himself. Unfortunately, tactics like that have never seemed to work on Draco, who finds himself picking out his voice anyway.
They stay like that for what feels like hours, Harry letting Draco cry into his shoulder until all that's left are small sniffles and hiccoughs. He's not sure when his arms moved down and around Harry's ribs to clutch at his back, or when one of Harry's hands started running through his hair so gently he can barely feel it. All he knows is that he never wants this to end. This quiet moment of comfort and reassurance and closeness.
and never mention it again." Draco steps out of his shoes, socks, and trousers and crawls into bed gratefully.
"Yes, shut up." is all Draco manages to get out before he captures Potter's mouth with his own, swallowing any further taunts.
“You’re just in time actually! Longbottom here was just about to show me what a real lap dance looks like, isn’t that right?” He says with a shit-eating grin. “And with a name like that he must be good.”
“Brilliant,” Draco says, kissing him quickly then moving towards the door. “I’ll pick you up say…ten tomorrow morning outside of Gryffindor tower?”
Draco doesn't know when the first tears start falling which soon turn into quiet sobs that wrack his whole body. Harry simply holds him even tighter, rubbing soothing circles on his back and whispering "It's okay, just let it all out."
The following silence is suffocating, but Draco's legs refuse to budge no matter how badly he urges them to let him run away. When Potter lifts his gaze and meets Draco's, he's taken aback by the intensity of his eyes from this proximity. It's only now that he realizes he must've stepped toward Potter at some point, leaving less than a metre between them.
"You're worthless." He whispers, now holding his wand to the side and beginning to conjure a fiendfyre in the shape of a snake. "I should've left you in that fire," He mutters darkly before thrusting his wand forward, engulfing the room in scorching flames.
"But where's the fun in that?" Draco replies, amused smirk only growing. He seems to register the genuine guilt in the glare Harry shoots him, however, and adds "Don't worry you righteous idiot, he's not fatally wounded or anything. And I may have conveniently left out the fact that it was you that did the hexing. As far as they know, we're his best mates who saved him from a crazed wizard he rejected and hauled his sorry arse over here."
At first, he wonders if it's an unfortunate mouse that has found its way in but never made it out again. Hesitantly, he bends down to pick up the unknown lump.
Against all the odds, the bottle lands back on Pansy, who laughs. "Let's have a dare then, shall we?"
“No it’s- you’re fine. Really I - “ Harry cuts himself off. Words having failed him rather spectacularly, he decides to simply show him. Using some of that Gryffindor courage, Harry takes the boys hand from his shoulder and tugs the boy towards him. “You’re fine, honestly. I just wish you’d tell me who you are.”
He finds a strange amount of comfort in the expansion and deflation of Harry's lungs beneath his fingers; in the feeling of Harry's body against his: solid, warm, real,
Draco can hear snorts from around the circle as the other Eighth Years catch a glimpse. "No one said you had to go and yank my hair out either," he shoots back petulantly.
," Potter says grimly, the bottle already spinning in front of him as he seems desperate to shift everyone's attention away from himself.
"Look, I'm not some charity project for you to use to fulfil your saviour complex. I didn't need your pity then, and I certainly don't need it now," Draco snaps, feeling stung and far too vulnerable as what he refuses to believe are tears begin to prick at the corners of his eyes.
“No, I suppose not.” The boy laughs again. “Not when I’ve spent the last four years pining after the one idiot boy I knew I could never have.”
“I’ll have you know that still hurts,” Draco says to Harry with a sniff. “You’re lucky it’s not bleeding or I might not forgive you.”
He becomes vaguely aware of the fact that Potter doesn't seem to have breathed since he started the kiss, and he wonders if this is affecting Potter as much as it is him. But just as he begins to ponder the likelihood of Potter passing out on him, he lets out a controlled breath that skates warmly across the side of Draco's face.
He's never realized just how much he misses that closeness, that physical touch which he has been starved of for so many years. He's broken out of his melancholy by another light squeeze and patient eyes watching him closely for any signs of fear or discomfort. Draco squeezes back in what he hopes is a reassuring manner.
“I’m just going to pretend you’re also worried about my well being, not only whether you’ll live through getting back on Hermione’s bad side,” Harry says with a tired laugh.
"Tame," Pansy says with a disappointed pout before standing and striking a pose that's undeniably Celestina-esque. One rousing rendition of Hoggy Warty Hogwarts later, and Pansy is curtsying to enthusiastic if perplexed applause.
And Merlin does he want to. He’s half a second from pulling Draco into his apartment right along with him. But another part of him desperately doesn’t want this to seem like a one-off thing that they go the rest of their lives pretending never happened.
They find themselves in another comfortable silence and Draco is suddenly hit by just how exhausted he is. Without the conversation to distract him he feels the last bits of energy drain out of him, a long yawn escaping his mouth.
"Don't you fucking dare Potter." Draco says, grabbing his hand and placing it back on his head with a pat. "Besides, no amount of your gross hand oil could make my hair look that bad."
“Oh shut up,” Harry says before pulling him down that small, slightly infuriating distance and claiming his lips once again. Draco responds by sighing and wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him even closer. Harry soothes the irritated lip with his tongue, drawing a quiet gasp from Draco. Both rather breathless as they pull apart slightly, they can’t help but smile at each other again.
Harry moves to leave but is stopped by Draco who says a quiet "Harry?" As soon as it comes out of his mouth he hopes he didn't hear him, not even sure why he said it.
Body finally able to move, Draco scrambles away just before the fire ignites the place he had been standing in only seconds before. He turns and runs as fast as his legs will carry him, adrenaline pumping through his veins. Refusing to look behind him, he stumbles aimlessly until he finally sees a door off in the distance. With his destination in sight, he pushes his body harder, faster, further.
Harry glances over at the boy he can finally call his boyfriend just as Draco himself glances at Harry.
“That doesn’t excuse the fact that I still become one! I’ve tortured people Harry. I’ve had to watch as they beg me for mercy, knowing if I stopped he’d kill them or me.” He roughly pulls back his sleeve revealing the ugly faded mark. “A couple selfish good deeds doesn’t erase this. It doesn’t erase a life of prejudice.”
For the first time in years Draco genuinely feels safe, in the arms of someone who used to be his enemy, and believes him when Harry says there's nothing to worry about and that he's going to be okay.
he thinks he's about to do, he nearly jumps out of his skin when Potter chooses that exact moment to leave the bathroom.
He begins saying "It wasn't real, just breathe," over and over in his head like a mantra as he tries to regain control of his erratic breathing. His head feels fuzzy and a ringing in his ears drowns out all other sound. "It wasn't real dammit," he repeats in barely more than a whisper; each breath he drags in feeling like it's being forced back out before it reaches his lungs.
He curses his inattentiveness when Blaise elbows him, gleefully informing him that the bottle has landed on him.
He doesn't think about how one wrong move could have him toppling over on top of the idiot in front of him. Or how he has to grip the carpet, so his hands don't wander and touch what isn't his.
Following Draco's terrified gaze, Harry seems to realize his mistake and places his wand on the bed, holding his empty hands up in a peaceful gesture. His lips move and Draco thinks he's trying to ask something but he can't make it out through the muddled ringing. Harry seems to ask something else, though this time he adds hand motions; first indicating his own slow breaths and then gesturing towards Draco. Harry continues to take long exaggerated breaths and, finally understanding, Draco tries to match them with his own.
But the validity of that first statement soon begins to crumble as Potter's previously-unoccupied hand snakes its way around his neck, calloused fingers tangling themselves in the silky hair at his nape.
"As if you'll be dragging your sorry arse out of bed any earlier than noon," Draco says with a pointed look. Harry opens his mouth to retort, but at Draco's raised eyebrows, he closes it again, looking put out. "
Then they hear a loud knock at the closet door followed by Pansy’s voice saying “Times up lovebirds!” Harry jumps so bad he ends up biting Draco’s lip who tries to look annoyed before snorting and bursting into a fit of giggles.
Harry returns the kiss with what he hopes is just as much enthusiasm, his hand desperately gripping Draco’s shirt from where it’s been trapped between their heaving chests. The proximity is dizzying, each swipe of his tongue is intoxicating, and every spot Draco touches crackles like electricity. It’s all at once too much, and not enough, and Harry just lets himself drown in the sensations.
But then Pansy decided they should play a different game. After explaining how the new game worked lots of people seemed to be on board and so started before Harry could get himself out of it. The basic idea was that she would put everyone’s name into a hat that would magically pick two people with the most chemistry and then they would be given ten minutes to do ‘whatever they want’ in a closet. The catch was that the first person was blindfolded and thus did not know the identity of their person. And the only way the blindfold can be taken off is at the end of the ten minutes or if the second person takes it off for them during the ten minutes.
It’s not until Harry is stumbling up to his blissfully warm bed and has begun undressing that he realizes he’s still wearing Draco’s scarf.
"I don't exactly fancy waking up to you sucking my blood, you know?" Blaise continues, not deterred in the slightest.
“As am I,” Draco says, expression softening. “You’re, dare I say, not too terrible of company after all.”
One of Harry's hands drops to Draco's hip, fingers gripping flesh and nails digging in possessively. The other pulls at Draco's hair, tugging his head forward towards Harry's shoulder and causing pleasant tingles to shoot through his scalp despite the slight sting of pain.
Once inside, Draco leans back against the closed door, taking a moment to compose himself before finding a stall and doing his business. For a second, it had looked like Potter might follow him back in, but he clearly decided against it. Draco shudders at the thought of being confined in a bathroom with Potter for a second time.
all of you," Pansy says with a tsk, though clearly enjoying herself far too much. The other occupants seem to quickly grasp the danger of a dare from Pansy, based on the extreme response from the other Slytherins.
"Just- For the love of Merlin, you two couldn't have picked a less public place to finally shag?" Weasley bemoans incredulously.
He's too close, and he knows he's treading dangerous waters. But the longer he stares into Potter's eyes, alight with desire and silent challenge, the less any of that seems to matter. They're close enough now Draco can feel Potter's warm breath against his lips when he cheekily says "You planning to kiss me properly this time or what?"
When he finally allows himself to take the skin gently between his teeth, one of Potter's hands shoots forward and grasps his bicep. It manages to simultaneously steady him and throw him wildly off balance.
Too worried about scaring him off though, he instead decides to test the waters a little by sliding the hand previously held on Draco's shoulder over to the nape of his neck, tangling his fingers into the short silky hair he finds there. He takes it as a good sign when Draco doesn't shove him away. In fact, the only reaction from him is the slightest tightening of his grip on Harry's hip.
"Impossible." Draco shakes his head, though the smile fighting its way onto his face suggests he's just saying it for the sake of the playful argument.
"Would you rather I let you go home by yourself?" Draco asks, raising his eyebrows and pulling away slightly.
Draco stares at their hands, letting the motion and physical contact bring him back to the present. A few minutes pass in near silence as Draco continues to even out his breathing. With another light squeeze Harry says "You're doing really well, just keep breathing. Is there anything you need?"
It’s a nice change, Harry thinks, not being the only one unsure of things and all. Seeing Draco like this, strange as it sounds, reminds him of how human he actually is.
They lapse back into silence as they continue walking. The next corner they round brings them right in front of the staircase to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
"Do you want me to shut up now?" Harry asks with another laugh that reverberates through Draco's body.
“If you wish to word it that way...yes,” Draco says with a long-suffering sigh before offering a small smile of his own.
He doesn't even try to stop the hand that dips below his waistband, merely using the other to grab his wand and throw up some half-assed privacy charms. He places his wand back on his nightstand then absently feels along his throat, flushing as he recalls the mouth that had been there not too long ago.
“Yeah, no splinching please.” Harry shudders for effect as he starts to walk once more. “Merlin, just thinking about apparating makes me feel like vomiting.”
He can feel words beginning to form in his mouth and only hopes he's able to escape from this exchange with some of his dignity still intact. "I never blamed you for it, you know. After all the awful things I did that year...I thought I rather deserved it." The Veritaserum might as well have shoved its hand in his chest and ripped his heart out.
Hermione, Pansy, and plenty of others open their mouths to say something but are cut off by Weasley. "
"Right then, it won't do to have you fall asleep in the middle of the hallway," Draco says resignedly.
He’s not sure what he expected him to taste like but he definitely didn’t expect it to be so warm and sweet, almost like–
There he was just innocently standing by the food table at the inter house party, trying (and failing miserably) to not stare at a certain blond Slytherin in much too tight trousers. When Pansy Parkinson of all people had dragged him towards a circle of people saying something about stopping being such a wet blanket and joining in on some “inter house unity exercises” as she called them. Which really just turned out to be a bunch of Muggle party games.
Because there’s anxiety, and nerves reflected in his gaze. But behind all that is pure want. And Harry begins to wonder just how little resistance he would’ve been met with had he snogged the bugger a half hour ago.
"Gods, don't remind me, I'm gonna have the worst hangover," Harry groans, thunking his head against the wall. "Ow."
Taking pity on him, Harry reaches out for his hand and tugs him forward. "Get over here and give me a goodnight kiss, you numpty," Harry says, besotted grin making a brilliant comeback and demolishing any hope Draco had of forming coherent thoughts, let alone comprehensible words. Luckily, that becomes less of an issue as Harry seems content to claim his mouth with his own instead.
Just as he begins to slip into a deep sleep, Draco hazily hears Harry mumble a barely audible "Gods, you're going to ruin me." Harry let's out a laugh that sounds more like a resigned sigh. Draco's heart hammers in his chest and at first he thinks that's it. But then Harry leans over, planting a light kiss on his forehead. He slowly gets up and heads towards his bed, completely missing the small twitch of a smile on Draco's face as he lays down to fall asleep.
"Actually learned that one from Hermione," Harry murmurs. "I guess a whole summer living at the Burrow with people suddenly bursting into tears left and right does that."
It's a breathtakingly beautiful sight and Harry hopes he never forgets this moment. Just the two of them, drunk and laughing their arses off at the ridiculousness of their night as they walk home together.
"Guess I'm lucky you like me so much then," Harry says with a cheeky smile. And this time he definitely doesn't imagine the sharp intake of breath beside him and the tightening of the hands around him.
Harry approaches him like a predator would freshly caught prey, eyes flashing dangerously. "How could you ever think I'd want you? You're just a weak, pathetic, lonely death eater who should be rotting away in Azkaban like your father." Harry leans in close enough to whisper in his ear. "You mean nothing to me." He practically purrs, straightening up and taking a few steps back now pointing his wand back in Draco's direction. "Nothing."
Most of the walk is spent in comfortable silence, only broken by small conversations here and there about seemingly insignificant things. They miraculously manage to avoid any touchy subjects despite Harry's aptitude for blurting out the worst possible things at the worst possible times, especially when sloshed. They also don't bring up the guy at the bar, having come to a silent agreement that that particular part of the night is better left behind them.
Finally, Draco pulls away, blowing cold air on the mark as a finishing touch just because he can. He watches, gratified as Potter shivers, and breaks out in goose flesh. Before he can think better of it, he lifts his gaze to meet Potter's, and Merlin, he's so fucked. The picture of a slightly breathless Potter sporting a bright red love bite is one he's not soon to forget.
“How could I not? You guys always made a huge spectacle of celebrating them at breakfast, or at least when we were younger.” Harry pauses. “I’m surprised Pansy didn’t manage to drag you out somewhere tonight.”
Draco bites his tongue, but it's no use. He takes another step forward, voice barely above a whisper. "You bloody well heard me."
Harry looks surprised for a moment before nodding. "Okay," he says, scooting forward on the bed and drawing Draco towards him by the hands. "Like this?"
His thoughts are interrupted by the boy– no Malfoy’s tongue reciprocating the timid exploration. And suddenly, Harry has the overwhelming urge to protect him, to hold him close and make him his.
Draco lets out a shaky breath before asking quietly, “How did you find out?” The vulnerability in his voice wrenches at Harry’s heart.
Harry laughs then pulls him towards himself, winding his arms around his neck and leaning it. “Perhaps I should try kissing it better then?” He says quietly.
of us still have a game to play." Draco and Potter both whip their heads around, startled by the interruption.
"Do you want to try going back to sleep?" Harry asks quietly, as if he's just as afraid of breaking this fragile spell of peace and quiet as Draco is.
"Right," Draco says faintly. He hesitates for a moment then tentatively wraps his right arm around Harry's shoulders, ever-so-slightly pulling him closer. Harry nestles his nose into the scarf wrapped delicately around Draco’s neck. The smell that floods his senses is intoxicating, wrapping him up in a blanket of citrus and warmth.
"Okay," Harry says with a small laugh. It's a nice sound, Draco thinks. "It's okay to be scared you know. I still have nightmares almost every night."
A small shiver runs through Draco’s body and Harry doesn’t even try to attribute it to the cold. As if seeking out an anchor to keep himself grounded, Draco’s hands shoot forward and grip Harry’s waist hard enough to bruise.
His mind wanders further, and he catches snatches of sensations: a calloused hand on his cheek, a wicked tongue sliding against his, tingles where hair was pulled, whispered words and uneven breaths skating across his neck, the firm press of Harry's body against his, hot delicious friction.
"Now come along Potter, I'm tired of you looking at me with that hangdog expression on your face," Draco says briskly as if wanting to get as far away from the subject of the creep as possible. He pushes himself out of his seat, standing up and sticking out a hand which Harry takes. He must not hide his surprise very well, as at Harry's expression he adds "The least you could do after cutting our night off much too soon is walk me home like a real gentleman.”
And without any further reason to doubt or hesitate, Harry tilts his head and dips down that final distance.
“Then kiss me like I know you want to, you numpty,” Harry says with a light laugh. He almost feels bad for the considerate boy. “If I’m going to be blindfolded and shoved into a closet with a boy I apparently have the most chemistry with, the least he could do is snog me like he means it.”
“Alright, alright, I’m walking.” Harry catches up to Draco and they resume their walk. However, with the absence of Draco’s body heat against him, he becomes startlingly aware of how cold the night has grown. He shoves his hands into his front trouser pockets in a futile attempt to find warmth, regretting not wearing a coat as he enviously eyes Draco in his.
“Well, I guess that makes you a bit of a hypocrite then doesn’t it,” Harry says, feeling along the blooming love bites scattered across his neck.
If you had told Harry that he would run into Draco sodding Malfoy after work, he would’ve shrugged it off, seeing as it’s not an entirely uncommon occurrence. With them both working at the ministry it’s damn near impossible to not run into each other or make awkward eye contact every now and then. Especially when Harry’s brain seems set on actively seeking out those stupid pretty grey eyes and those stupid pretty platinum blond locks. (Old habits die hard, Harry guesses)
Even after all of these years, it’s hard to not see him as the emotionally detached, lifeless boy he once knew. He doesn’t think he’ll ever forget how small he looked sitting silently before the Wizengamot.
It's then that Harry realizes he doesn't think he's ever seen or heard Draco laugh this loudly and freely. On the rare occasions he does, they're always light breathy laughs or mocking snorts, but never this. Full-bellied with tears pricking at his eyes as he covers his mouth with an aristocratic hand and clutches his stomach with the other.
They stand like that for a moment, neither wanting to move away lest they risk breaking the bubble of comfortable silence that has settled around them. Harry takes a moment to simply soak in Draco's presence beside him, finding a strange comfort in the sound of his breathing; a security in the weight of his arm around him. He finds himself growing drowsy, however, as his relaxation gives way to exhaustion.
No such luck. Blaise is in bed with his back turned to Draco, but they've been rooming long enough for him to know when the prat is faking it.
Now, Harry wasn't exactly sure what to expect from a night out at a gay bar with Draco Malfoy of all people. But sitting in St. Mungos' waiting room definitely wasn't on the agenda he had in mind. It wasn't his fault some creep had tried to chat up Draco, and Harry, admittedly drunk off his arse and pining hard for the blond git, had hexed the guy into next Tuesday.
“Maybe you should let me be the judge of that,” Harry says, tugging him forward again. The boy remains silent as he seems to consider it. He stays quiet though, long enough that Harry starts to feel bad for how much of a struggle this seems to be for him. “Hey, if it’s that big of a deal to you, you don’t have to tell me.”
“Of course, my lips are sealed.” Harry mimes zipping his lips then gives him a thumbs up. Draco laughs again.
He feels the unknown person approach his spot on the floor followed by the rustling of clothes as they sit down.
It’s odd, kissing someone while unable to see. It makes every slight feeling heightened. Every touch like fire. Searing through his veins and warming his body like a shot of Firewhiskey.
Draco knows he's going to regret it later the moment the Veritaserum-laced Rum and Coke slides down his throat. But there was absolutely no way he would've been able to back out of tonight's game of Truth or Dare with his pride still intact. Especially not after his narrow escape half-way through last week's round of I Have Never. (Leave it to Parkinson and Granger to come up with such a horrid idea as "inter-house unity" parties)
. And besides, I think you rather like the idea of parading about with these tomorrow," Harry says cheekily, running a finger along the bitemarks then digging into one with his fingernail. "You do, don't you?" The little shit adds, meeting Draco's gaze with an innocent look that has Draco swearing internally.
Draco's legs immediately start to cramp up from the awkward position, but he stubbornly refuses to touch more of Potter's body than is absolutely necessary. He settles his hands on either side of Potter's crossed legs, studiously avoiding his gaze. Someone who sounds suspiciously like Finnigan wolf-whistles at them, causing another round of giggles to pass around the circle.
The kiss is laden with desire and promises of things to come. Ending much too soon for either of their likings. It's with a gargantuan amount of effort Draco pulls himself away from Harry, though they remain joined at the hands for a moment.
"Your words wound me, truly," Draco sighs dramatically, earning him a sharp bite to his neck in retribution. "Must you maul my neck, Potter?" He asks, slightly scandalized. He can only imagine how dark the marks on his neck will be and silently curses Harry for having darker skin.
It takes every single ounce of Harry's dwindling willpower to not just grab Draco, shove him against the nearest solid object, and snog the living daylights out of him.
Harry's hands still as he seems to think something over. "Maybe we should talk about them, I mean probably not tonight but eventually. It might help both of us you know?" Harry says with as much of a shrug as he can muster with Draco wrapped around him.
A Draco who was impulsive enough to ask Harry out for drinks, not knowing whether he’d agree or laugh in his face.
Draco takes one look at Harry and rolls his eyes so hard it looks like it hurts. "Merlin, Potter, you look like someone kicked your Crup."
Harry frowns, seeming to have forgotten that the game entails coming up with truths and dares as well. "Er...I dare you...to sing Hoggy Warty Hogwarts like you're Celestina Warbeck."
“I don’t really celebrate it, it’s not a big deal,” Draco says, batting away the assault. “I’m surprised you remembered. Or even knew when it was for that matter.”
"Yet here you are, walking me home because you're worried about my well being," Harry says with a grin.
Draco stands, ignoring his protesting legs and alcohol ridden body that insists on making his task much more difficult to execute smoothly. He snatches the bottle of rum from an indignant Seamus before unsteadily making his way back to his spot in the circle. Once he's settled on the floor safely, he refills his glass and immediately knocks it back. The rum burns down his throat but does nothing to get rid of the squirmy feeling in his stomach.
But then he realizes he recognizes these floor tiles. Tiles that had once been stained red with his own blood. His stomach lurches as he finds himself in a very familiar bathroom.
“But I’m here now, right?” Harry says after the admission sinks in. “And I’ll be here for you as long as you’ll have me,” He says, threading his fingers through Draco’s and squeezing. Draco stares down at their joined hands as if he can’t comprehend it, and perhaps he can’t. He rubs his thumbs against Harry’s hands, taking a deep breath and feeling the most calm and grounded he has in years.
The next breath he lets out is surprisingly ragged as all thought leaves his head outside of the sensation of the fingers on his hip. It's such a small gesture but Harry feels like his body is on fire, warmth pooling in his stomach like he’s taken another shot of Firewhiskey.
In the fading light, I swerved between the gnarled trunks of the oaks and broken lower boughs of the pines which protruded like daggers. The crow instincts that I had acquired with this form told me that if the rooks caught me, I’d be lucky to escape with nothing worse than the loss of a few feathers. More likely, they would kill me.
, Harry chucks the crusts of his toast across the breakfast table at his boyfriend and says he almost forgot how much of a prat he could be.
“Well, no,” Potter says, tilting his head to consider it. “You have to figure out what’ll make you happy and go after it, I guess. Tha’s what I’ve decided.”
Harry went back to Grimmauld Place and waited for word from Malfoy. He paced through the high-ceilinged rooms and climbed the long flights of stairs until his legs ached. He caught himself holding his breath, listening for a knock on the door or the roar of the Floo. When they never came, he went out to the back garden instead and lay on its small rectangle of grass. He considered where he might go—California or New Zealand. Or maybe some South Pacific island where it never got cold.
He shrugged, then quickened his steps as we walked along the swift-running stream to the grove. The banks were already becoming lush with spring grasses, and the meadow would soon be in bloom. It was an overcast day, but bright, so at least we wouldn’t be waiting around in the rain.
He sets down his plate and reaches for a row of books on a high shelf. The one he pulls down has a tattered red cover and a moving illustration of a smiling, middle-aged witch on the cover, Harry sees when Malfoy holds it up.
By the time they’re ready to wrap up for the day, Harry is more than eager to get away from this dreary house and have some human company and conversation. For someone who usually doesn’t mind working alone, Harry felt the solitude more keenly today. Maybe it was simply his awareness that there was someone else in the house. Harry decides to pretend that’s what it was, rather than the pull of the man sitting in the kitchen.
Somehow, Harry gathers his wits enough to shut his mouth and step into the room, until he’s so close he can see the muscles beneath Draco’s skin shift when he moves his shoulders. Merlin’s tears, Harry’s hand itches to press his fingertips against that skin and feel the warmth of it. His mouth almost salivates to taste the slope of Draco’s shoulder. He swallows hard.
Draco is ready to offer apologies to whoever is willing to hear them—not only for the sake of his and Harry’s relationship, but because he truly feels that they are owed apologies for Draco’s bigoted words and reckless actions. But he worries that his sincere contrition won’t be enough, that their soulmate bond will wreak havoc on Harry’s personal and professional relationships. He worries about Andromeda and Teddy, in particular. Draco can’t imagine that his aunt would allow a former Death Eater and convicted felon, the son of the sister who shunned her, no less, to be part of her grandson’s life.
“You… had it for three… nights in a row,” Malfoy growls, pausing for breath every time he tries to shove his arse further onto the armchair. The same chair where Harry is sitting sideways with his legs hanging over the arm. “I know you’re
Harry stops walking. He’d rather finish this conversation now than in front of the others. It feels important to talk things out with Draco, even if they have to do it in the rain while Harry’s holding a snail teapot and their boots are sinking into the mud.
“Is there something upstairs?” Draco demands, straightening so that he’s holding Harry at arm’s length. “Is it safe to leave it?”
“Yeah, of course I do,” Harry says, letting Draco pull him to his feet. He’s a bit lightheaded from the snogging and the sudden change of position, so wraps his arms loosely around Draco’s waist and leans against him for a moment. He smells so nice that Harry can’t resist planting a few kisses on the side of Draco’s neck and inhaling his cologne.
“Not yet, but I’ve seen it come damn close a few times. You can’t tell me that all the raids are catching dangerous criminals. Most of them aren’t even petty criminals. They’re being arrested for minor offences, just to make us cower. And to make it look to the rest of the magical world like the Ministry’s doing something productive for once.”
“I know. Astoria’s going to be cross about it when he’s wide awake after dinner, but I’m not sorry. He’s going to be too big to sleep on my lap soon,” Draco says sadly.
Harry dims the lamp a little, then tosses his wand next to it. He pulls off his own shirt and wraps his arms around Draco’s neck, bringing them chest to chest.
I got up and went to the window, desperately trying to replace the most terrible image of her in my mind, the one I’d gladly erase with an
He folds up the chess board and packs it away while Malfoy considers the idea. When Harry looks back up, he wonders what Malfoy could be thinking that has brought a sudden flush to his cheeks. Maybe it’s just the heat of the fire, Harry reasons.
“Yeah, I understand that. But I’ve learned a fair bit about the community from you and from my patrols. I think I’d like to be a part of it, if I can. If they’ll let me.” Harry pauses for a soft laugh. “It rather seems like fate, come to think of it.”
Harry can’t suppress his smile at the possibility of witnessing that, but decides that getting the camp built is more important than Malfoy getting his comeuppance for being a whinging little git. He gives the girls a jaunty salute and heads for the tent site, again relishing the wind on his face. May has arrived with milder days, and the sun is warm on the top of Harry’s head when it breaks through the clouds.
“We could build a bigger tent,” Greg suggests. “It would be all right for winter with more weatherproofing and heating charms.”
, followed by a light Cooling Charm. I’d already known that his interest in me had seemed tepid when we were by the waterfall. There was no reason to feel as disappointed as I did now, hearing him ask me to
Damp and footsore, they wait for Luna and Pansy. Greg paces back and forth along the half-fallen side of the cottage, looking off into the fog for any sign of movement, while Draco and Harry rest against a stone wall. The only time Draco speaks is to demand that Harry teach him and Greg how to cast the Patronus Charm before they ever set foot on the damn moor again.
“I was thinking of my mother,” Draco says. “She’s been separated from my father for over seven years now. She never speaks of it in her letters, but it must be very painful to be apart from him.”
In the morning, he awakes to the merciless June sunshine attacking him through the curtains and a splitting headache pounding at his skull. When he reaches for his glasses, his hand falls on something smooth and round—a half-full vial of Hangover Potion, lying on top of a folded scrap of parchment.
“She does seem to enjoy your company,” Draco mused, “and she would certainly get more attention than she gets now. Do you think you would like owning a snake?”
It’s the first time they’ve talked about Draco’s soulmate. Susannah has been more than respectful of his privacy; he’s not sure if she’s even told Jerome, and he’s certain that Naia doesn’t know about Harry—she’d have endless questions, if she did. Draco hopes Susannah knows him better than to think he’d simply walk away from the connections he’s made here, especially his students.
“It will take a few hours for the counter curse to take effect. Just stay where you are and keep holding his hand,” she instructs him from someplace to Draco’s right.
“Draco’s very skilled with stonework. He helped rebuild the house,” Luna says, dropping this surprising bit of information as casually as if she were mentioning his favourite food. Malfoy turns pink and strides away towards the shed, muttering something about mortar. “He doesn’t want people to know, for some reason,” Luna adds with a soft frown.
“Oh, yes. I go down to see her sometimes. She likes to have company, especially now that she’s retired. And she still serves me custard creams with my tea,” Luna laughs.
Draco owls a note to Potter, wrapped around a vial containing a Pensieve memory of the customer. He receives a reply on a torn scrap of parchment with only the words
Draco hums in acknowledgement, but doesn’t comment. Harry continues, determined to get a smile out of him at least.
I hurried back up the hill to the house. Zoë wriggled around my legs when I came inside. I gently pushed her away to go upstairs for the gold. On my way back down, I paused, curious to know what I looked like. There was no mirror in the bathroom—Potter, I speculated, might be able see the strange effect his magic had wrought on his appearance (as I could as a crow) and didn’t like it. I hastily pulled a saucepan from the cupboard and cast a reflection spell on the bottom.
The forest has reached its full, summer lushness, a far cry from the tentative smattering of green that Harry saw on his first walk up this path. His previous experiences with forests (namely, the Forbidden kind and the ones he spent a winter camping in during the last year of the war) didn’t prepare him for how fond he’s become of this little corner of Devon. It’s quiet, yet full of small sounds if he stops and listens; it’s peaceful, yet busy with countless plants and animals living and growing and driven to survive. Harry feels a kind of silent solidarity with them, as a fellow living thing, when he’s here.
Draco nods. “That’s a good idea. I was going to sit with him in the rocking chair back at the cottage until it was time to leave for tea, but it would be better if he had a proper sleep.” He squats down next to Scorpius to get his attention. “Let’s go see Mummy. And drink some water on the blanket.”
Before he even touches stone, Harry hears a shout. Someone catches him. He looks up to see Draco, wide-eyed, as he’s lowered to the floor. Draco wraps his arms around Harry and pulls him against his chest.
“So sorry,” Draco replies sarcastically. He casts the charm and the noise outside the tent abruptly ceases. “Well, that’s one problem solved.”
After months of dreariness and cold, the arrival of spring was almost exhilarating. Between the new foals prancing after their mothers by the stream, Zoë’s constant canine joyfulness, and the moorland bursting into life, I was reminded every day that something will come along to lift the lowest spirits, if you can hold on long enough.
Harry suddenly feels Draco’s absence more keenly than he has all afternoon. His sharp observations and lively banter with Pansy lend their gatherings a bit of zest. Or maybe just being in his presence, with their long and tangled history, is still a novel experience to Harry. Something that makes him feel more
“Don’t you get tired of the same views?” I huffed impatiently when he gave me a look. “Yes, I know it changes from day to day, but wouldn’t it be nice to look at something entirely different? Like the sea?”
For three days, Draco’s tormented himself imagining Harry’s reaction when he finds out. He’s lain awake at night thinking of the things Harry’s friends will say to convince him that Draco is unworthy to be his soulmate. For three days, Draco’s fought against the return of the self-loathing that almost defeated him during his first few months in Azkaban.
Draco smiles grimly. “You have a lot more nerve than I do. My idea of danger these days is letting Scorpius play with a self-inking quill.”
“Wait,” Malfoy says, shrugging Harry’s hand off his shoulder. He reaches into his bag and pulls out an envelope.
They should make the most of their limited time together, Draco reasons as he’s pulled into the breath-stealing darkness. And the harsh realities of the world and his past will intrude again soon enough.
“Nope. The kitchen,” Harry says, following Draco into the house. “It just needs a few dusting and scouring charms. And you might want to clear the chimney before you start a fire, in case birds nested in there. There’s a strange smell coming from one of the cupboards, too.”
Harry was visibly relieved he opened the door for Draco last weekend. Since Draco’s near miss with the Aurors and their conversation afterwards, he’s been checking on Draco every day, either stopping by or sending an owl when he can’t come in person. One evening, when they were sitting side by side on Draco’s bed, tucked under the low eaves of the attic room, Harry tried to apologise to him for not doing more at his trial.
“Oh. Well, I was thinking about what you said the other day, about not being able to make your way in the world. And I was wondering…”
“No matter how much I try not to dwell on the past, I still have dreams about it—nightmares, sometimes.”
He lies awake for a long time that night, hunger gnawing at his stomach—he’d been too shaken to eat dinner—and unanswered questions gnawing at his mind. He’s not thinking about the brief interrogation, which concerned whether Draco knows a Mr. Such-and-Such (he doesn’t) and if he’s been to Newcastle lately (good lord, never).
Draco looks taken aback by the bitterness in Harry’s voice. But to Harry’s surprise, rather than replying, he stands abruptly and rushes toward the mantel where Harry set the Portkey.
And then Harry’s lost—lost to the heat of Draco’s lips and tongue, lost to the desire that’s coursing through him. His hand makes its way into Draco’s long hair, which Draco takes as a cue to deepen the kiss even more. Harry finds himself pushed into the pillow with Draco half draped over him and rutting slightly against Harry’s hip. He can feel that Draco’s already—oh, god—
After he left, I lay watching the winter light outside turn bluer, then fade away, and thought about the way Potter had just looked at me.
“Of course I was. You can’t possibly think what we’re doing is a wise choice for either of us,” Draco shrugs, hoping that nonchalance will allow him to keep a shred of his dignity. “I think that’s obvious, don’t you?”
Harry interprets Draco’s silence as an admission. “You weren’t going to tell me,” he says flatly, looking away when he sees Draco shake his head in denial. “You didn’t want me to be your soulmate. Do you still hate me a little, like you did at school? Were you hoping for a Pureblood girl from the Sacred Twenty-Eight to have your perfect heir?”
Granger frowns and shakes her head, and Draco senses that she’s frustrated that she can’t immediately think of a counterargument. He sips his lukewarm tea and considers the idea further.
“So, would you like to tell me what that nonsense about the turtles was about? And the television? I can’t believe I fell for that! Snakes are not known for their sharp hearing or eyesight, are they? Did you even care about my snake at all?”
But there was a distinct tension between Harry and Draco. It was in the way they caught each others’ eyes and quickly looked away all day; it was in the way they tried not to show how closely they were listening when the other one spoke; and it was in the way they were careful not to brush against each other in the crowded tent or let their hands touch when passing a plate or a record sleeve.
Pansy grimaces. “Not on good terms, to say the least. But I think that’s something he’d rather explain himself, if he chooses to.”
So Harry tucks the duvet around them, makes a fresh pot of tea, and asks Draco for another story. He watches Draco’s expressive face light up when he laughs—not the cruel, mocking laugh Harry heard at Hogwarts, but a genuine one— and he can’t help but notice how pleased Draco is when Harry laughs, too. He’s captivated by this side of Draco that he’s never seen before, and sometimes he can barely wait until a tale is finished before he presses against Draco and kisses him until they’re breathless.
They land in a narrow lane in the woods beside a rotting wooden gate. Beyond the gate, a path leads down to the river, which is sending the murmur of flowing water to their ears. Harry’s filled with the same anticipation that he had the day he found the path to Luna’s house. An adventure lies ahead, and this time he’ll get to share it.
“Yes, well you did say some rather shocking things to your superiors and colleagues yesterday. Even if they didn’t make their way to the
Draco hums in agreement, but there’s also a frown of concern that Harry’s quick to kiss away. He doesn’t need to ask to know Draco’s thinking about Lillian. She’s probably stalking unsuspecting birds in the dunes right now, the tip of her grey tail gliding above the tall grass like a shark’s fin in the waves. Or maybe she’s curled up for a nap on the kitchen doorstep, fur warmed by the sun. Either way, she’s getting by while she waits for a family to appear on her shore again.
“I know you’ll do it,” Luna says serenely. “Let’s go see what Draco and Greg are doing, shall we? It’s almost time for lunch.”
Harry shivers. His Warming Charms are shit and there’s no way to control the temperature in this place. He’ll just have to wait until he hears the telltale whistle and clank of steam pushing through the cast iron radiators. Tea would be a good idea, as would heating up the leftover Chinese food in the refrigerator, if he could muster the energy. He hasn’t eaten anything today besides a cheese danish from a coffee shop near the Museum of Modern Art (his destination for the day), and an overpriced turkey sandwich from the museum cafe.
“Er, I’m going to go eat this now before it gets cold. Have a good day… sir.” Harry starts towards the stairs, then calls over his shoulder, “Be careful, it’s a bit slippery out there.”
Harry runs his hand through his hair and vows to keep his mouth shut on the subject for the rest of the night. He certainly doesn’t want to make things worse, and Luna is by far the best person to mediate this dispute, anyway.
“It’s all well and good for you to say that. You don’t need to work any more than I do,” Harry points out.
the Ministry—and a good portion of the wizarding world—for treating everyone here without the smallest bit of dignity and humanity.
“Out of curiosity, what should I do if you accidentally get cursed by something?” Draco gives Harry an anxious look. “Not that I doubt your abilities, but I’d like to know how I should help you.”
! I just wanted you to check for scratches, honestly. It took five seconds and I didn’t take a step.
“All right, I’ll hold you to it. I’m happy to have you both here, and Teddy will be thrilled that you’re staying, Harry. What did you bring with you?”
“On the floor, I guess. Or in the chair,” he shrugged, “though I should warn you it’s not very comfortable for sleeping in. Change back into a crow and perch somewhere. That’s what you were going to do tonight, anyway, right?”
Years living and working here have shown Draco the harsh realities of life in Knockturn. People here walk on a knife’s edge between survival and destitution, persistence and despair. They’ll seek out whatever advantage they can get. As much as he wants to help improve life in Knockturn, Draco would rather not be put in the position of being asked to secure special treatment from the Ministry—for his employer or anyone else.
“I wouldn’t do that to them,” Harry says. “Even though it was boring sometimes, it wasn’t a terrible place to work until I figured out what I wanted to do. Wanted to
Potter! Don’t you pay attention?” Malfoy holds out his arm and squints at his fingers, then looks at Harry imploringly. “Could you check my temperature for me? I don’t want to worry Andromeda just yet.”
“What shall we do this afternoon?” Luna asks just before biting into a pasty. “Oh, Harry, these are wonderful. Did you make them?”
They’re swept away after that, tangled together like branches on a rushing river. Bare and panting, with their bodies and breath heating the air around them, they move against each other until they slip over the edge.
Harry doesn’t reply, but there’s something in Draco’s words—and in the distant tone of his voice—that makes him uneasy.
“I overheard a couple of people in the butcher shop in Hogsmeade say she’s been wandering around the high street for a few weeks now. She needed a home,” Potter said.
Harry looked in the mirror of the eighth-year boys’ bathroom and found he was truly comfortable in his own skin for the first time. His life wasn’t going to be scrutinised and dissected for public consumption anymore. The people around him didn’t think he was a
. Harry can’t remember the last time she referred to herself in a depreciating way, and he knows that being with Luna is a big part of seeing herself as something more than a socialite.
Hermione seemed unimpressed with this explanation. She didn’t even need to speak for Harry interpret her thoughts as,
I was being quiet so I wouldn’t wake Teddy.” Malfoy closes the door behind him and casts a Silencing Charm. “The more pertinent question at the moment is, why were you snooping around my belongings?”
“I’d have to train it not to bother them,” he said thoughtfully, “but you’re right. It might be nice.”
“They finally got tired of you, mate,” Ron said with a laugh as they trudged back to the school after a morning of Christmas shopping. Harry scooped up a handful of snow and rubbed it, none too gently, into Ron’s grinning face.
dictate kicking Malfoy in the shins. He draws his wand and sends the cardboard box drifting ahead of him towards the kitchen.
“We made a few benches last year for bonfires, but we want to build a proper camp so we have our own home base for adventures. Not that Dad minds us in the house. It’s just a bit cramped in there.”
Potter takes this interruption as his cue to stand. He leans down until his face is close to Draco’s again.
I rolled my eyes, annoyed that he was feigning enthusiasm for my sake. I walked to the water’s edge and squatted down to trail my fingers in the water. There were a few gulls coasting on the breeze and I thought about transforming. I’d never flown over the sea before. But Potter would probably just stand around like a lump who didn’t know what to do with himself if I left him alone.
He’s tried and tried to let himself grieve for Sirius. For Remus and Tonks and Fred. And even for his parents. Even though he knows he needs to allow himself to feel the full agony of their deaths, Harry can’t let himself do it. He’s afraid he’ll be overwhelmed, like a man beneath a tidal wave, or he convinces himself that his grief is somehow
“There, is this so terrible?” I kept our fingers laced together so that he couldn’t retreat. “You’re not scared of the sea, are you? I should have asked.”
Malfoy grips the doorframe and studies Harry with narrowed eyes. He’s let his hair grow out a bit and he doesn’t look as thin as the last time Harry saw him, about six months ago. But he still has the same sharp features, the same taut posture, the same style of clothing that reeks of gold and taste. Harry could probably recognise the posh bastard from across a crowded room.
Luna makes a pained sound. “She’s just immersed in her work and doesn’t want to be interrupted. I’m sure she’ll apologise later,” she adds when Greg doesn’t look placated.
“Well, I had never considered it before I was completely charmed by yours. I work pretty long hours, so a dog is out of the question and I don’t care for cats, except for Hermione’s. But a snake would be manageable, I think.”
If Andromeda notices the jagged appearance of her yew hedge, or wonders why it takes Harry four hours to weed beneath it, she doesn’t say anything.
He didn’t get the chance to finish. Harry launched himself out of the chair and crushed Malfoy in a hug, laughing tearfully into the shoulder of his Unspeakable robes.
Well, perhaps it was the fact that the houseguest was me, specifically. I set off on my walk to give him some space.
articles.” Luna leans down to kiss the corner of Pansy’s mouth. “I’m going to go get an apple. Would anyone else like one?”
“We’ll set the wards far enough away that we won’t disturb them,” Draco promises. “Believe me, I’d rather not be chased by an angry swarm halfway across Devon today.”
“Well, the best case scenario, if I messed up, was a wooden spoon to the back of my hand. Worst case was missing a meal or three. It depended on my aunt’s mood on that particular day.” Harry tries for a wry smile, but he can feel that it’s more of a grimace. He hears Draco draw a sharp breath.
As soon as Harry eases up to tease Draco’s tingling lips with gentle sucking, Draco takes the opportunity to pull off both of their shirts. They press together again and his breath catches in his chest—he can feel how ready both of them are to take this further. After holding back for months, and then their recent separation, it’s no wonder.
Lightning flashed again outside, but the thunder took its time arriving. The storm was rolling away to the west.
Nodding, Draco tilts against him. He buries his face in the side of Harry’s neck, too relieved to speak.
“I hope he wasn’t too disappointed,” Draco replies. “I always thought that unicorns should be purple for some reason, when I was about three or four years old. My poor mother had to listen to a tirade whenever I saw a picture of one. I was so adamant about it that she teased me relentlessly when I wrote to her about studying unicorns in Care of Magical Creatures.”
He tries to go faster, but can only manage a clumsy run over the uneven ground. When he reaches the end of the ridge, he stops to catch his breath and look around. Nothing but fog all around him and above him, a dome of grey trapping him on the brown-green moor.
“Well she certainly couldn’t ask for someone with more enthusiasm,” Draco observes. “I think you would have started the next day if you didn’t need to give notice at Magical Games and Sports.”
“If you can’t, then I’ll Side-Along you there. I don’t know how things are going to play out in the next few days, but I’d feel safer if you weren’t alone in Knockturn just yet.”
Potter blinks at him, as if this question confounds him even more than Draco’s presence in a Muggle bookstore. He’s wearing a puffy blue parka and what appears to be a Chudley Cannons scarf, and Draco almost has to look away, his eyes are so offended by the clashing colours.
“You can buy as many of them as you like from Susannah, if you want more. I assume you’re going to have cake tomorrow, anyway.”
“Hold this for a second.” He pulls his feet, one at a time, from the mud with some difficulty, careful not to lose his balance. “Okay, now I’m ready.”
In the light of the wand, Harry gets to see him for the first time since he woke from his nightmare. His hair is a bit tangled on his shoulders and his face is still flushed. Harry’s tempted to look at the rest of him, but he keeps his eyes averted.
There’s been no sign of Lillian today, Draco informs Harry when he asks, but he’s going to put some food in her bowl tonight before they leave. He accepts the music box from Harry with only a cursory glance at the outside before placing it at the end of the row of objects on the kitchen table.
“Well then, I suppose we may as well embrace the madness.” Malfoy leans back on his hands and gives Harry a wry look. “Don’t you think?”
“All right,” Draco said, at the end of what felt to Harry like several of Nicholas Flamel’s life spans. “I can give you five minutes, but I
“The past few summers I have. It’s better than being cooped up in a little flat all weekend, especially on days like this.”
