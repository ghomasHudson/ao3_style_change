“I can’t be brilliant on my own?”
Pansy’s face fell. “What do you mean?”
Words failed Draco for a moment and he shrugged casually, keeping his gaze off the female in front of him. “I could care less.”
one to talk, Malfoy,” he retorted in disgust. “Whatever game you’re playing right now, I’m having none of it. Maybe if you stop being an arse for more than an hour I’ll actually consider a truce.” The brunet’s head gave a painful thump, increasing Harry’s irritation. “Now,
A blush crept up into Hermione’s cheeks. “Harry...” she began, embarrassment obvious.
“Yeah, I kind of maybe did,” Harry said sheepishly as he sat down in between his two best friends.
“Draco,” she began carefully, keeping her tone even, “when did you first notice this reaction to Potter?”
“Why?” Pansy frowned.
The blond shook his head. “I’m tutoring some of the younger students.”
“Why, what?”
“W-Wait—how do you even
“Well?” Pansy prodded.
“Perhaps Pansy would be satisfied if we started calling each other a sappy pet name,” Potter said with a smirk, winking in the female’s direction.
“Well?” Pansy questioned, tapping her foot.
As that thought settled, a sense of alarm overcame him. What were the chances of Malfoy, being a pure-blood wizard, happening across Tumblr, a muggle site? Shouldn’t Malfoy have very limited knowledge of the internet?
Dropping his bag to the floor, Ron left the two in the dark room and rushed down the stairs. Hermione closed the door behind him and made her way back to Harry’s bedside. She placed her wand aside, still lit, and sat on the bed, laying a comforting hand on Harry’s hair.
As the golden warmth of their post-coital glow began to fade, a fresh sense of discomfort made an appearance. Draco’s fingers were lazily stoking Harry’s hip and Harry suddenly wished he would stop. The very idea that the blond could even be so at ease with him so soon after the incident baffled the dark-haired male. He had expected that the blond might have been more apologetic, careful even, in his approach to Harry. The blond had admitted how distraught he had been over the pain he had caused Harry and yet here they were, literally acting as if never had been occurred.
Draco cursed softly. “Potter, look. Would I be here right now, bearing my feelings and in a complete and utter mess because I wanted to continue to fuck with your head? There are only a few people I will allow to see me like this… and you’re one of them.”
Draco
“Nice going, Ron,” Harry said, trying and failing, to appear put out.
It was a

well.”
A wicked grin overtook the blond’s face.
“Don’t do that,” Draco murmured, knocking the male’s hand away.
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione beamed, pulling the brunet into a hug. “I’m so proud of you! Congratulations!”
Malfoy snorted. “I would prefer to not be placed in the same category as Pansy.”
find out what he did to woo the great Ice Prince.”
“Was that the first time you had been close to him this year?”
“Nice tact there, Ronald,” Hermione commented, taking a seat on Harry’s bed while the brunet leant against one of the wooden posts.
“Headache...” Harry croaked in reply, closing his eyes again. “Feel sick.”

Unable to be bothering to figure out exactly why the pronunciation of tomatoes was important, Harry instead began his new drawing of Hermione, something
He didn’t mean to be so foul; after all, feeling as he did was not something he was used to. Malfoys were always in control, always strong and they
“Draco’s the only person capable to ignore your stubbornness and push your grades higher,” Pansy commented.
“I thought that—maybe—we could start again.”
“Well that’s not really fixing the problem then is it?” Potter replied with a small smile.
“That was probably Dumbledore’s plan all along,” Malfoy smirked. “Get us both drunk enough that we forget why we hated each other in the first place.”
“I never said anything.”
Capturing Malfoy’s mouth with his, Harry pushed a second finger inside, swallowing Draco’s moan as he began to scissor the digits.
Draco smiled. “Agreed. Thus why I am here also.”
, Malfoy!” Harry’s breaths were coming out in panicked pants, his terror spiking when he felt his back press up against the cool stone of the wall.
slowly, Draco hooked his fingers beneath the hem of the brunet’s boxers and leisurely dragged them down, allowing Harry’s impatient cock to spring from its confinement. Draco eyed Potter’s erection hungrily, smirking at the precome already leaking from the tip. He swiped his tongue across the head of Harry’s cock, relishing in both the taste and the way the brunet gasped, hips jerking off the mattress. The whimper that he had forced down previously broke free, fingers trembling as they stroked through the blond’s hair. And finally,
“Can you imagine my dad on something like this?” Ron snickered. “He’d drive mum mental.”
“I guess.”
Butterflies fluttered in his stomach and for the thirteenth time, Harry’s gaze flickered to his watch.
“Ugh, silver. Potter, you can have that.”
The anger seemed to seep out of Ron as the red-head watched the defeated slump his best friend fell into. With a sigh, Ron came to sit by the brunet on the bed, knocking Harry’s shoulder with his own.
He had contained his temptation to corner Potter all day. Instead, he had simply observed the Gryffindor whenever he could, needing the chance to study him, understand his habits, and find a way to speak with him.
makes it out to be, you know.”
“Malfoy really must think I’m an idiot,” Harry snorted, coming to a halt outside the Slytherin’s secret entrance. With only a few moments of further hesitation, he mumbled the password and entered. The warmth that greeted him was a welcome change and he relished in the heat the crackling fire emitted.
“Yes, Wormtail,” Voldemort continued in mild amusement, “don’t talk about Lucius in that manner.” He had kept his gaze on Draco all the while, a deviant smirk curling at his lips. “Very well, Draco, be on your way. I do hope you give—

“Great, alone in the Hospital Wing with

talented tongue and a knack for finding certain spots that drove Harry crazy.
Draco found that he liked the way Harry smiled at him. It was so honest, nothing sinister hidden within the glistening green eyes as they stared openly. With his gaze on Harry, it was hard for Draco to miss the blazing, angry puncture wounds on his neck. Draco felt a rush of satisfaction, enjoying the sight of such a possessive mark on his mate’s neck. While the desire to leave the recognisable wound untouched burnt strongly within him, Draco couldn’t help but consider Harry’s opinion on the matter.
to mess around with Harry until he realised he actually liked him—how’s that for ironic?” Ron quirked a corner of his mouth into a half smirk. “He didn’t have the guts to admit it though—guess he thought he was in too deep or something. Harry obviously found out somehow and I guess now assumes that the slime ball did it all on purpose.”
Harry frowned. “How? We don’t have any scanners.”
She worried her lip, sharing a brief glance with their teacher whose suspicious gaze was now on the pair.
“And don’t we know it,” Ron leered.
“Perhaps he’s noticed that you look different,” Pansy offered, laying her quill delicately beside her ink pot. “You may not have changed much but the differences are still there. Considering you’ve been in each other’s faces since First Year, I’m honestly not surprised that he’s picked up on the changes.”
Reaching over, Draco shut the lid of his computer, determined to get some of his work done.
I thought it might be nice to get to know one another properly.”
“What more do you want?” Draco replied snidely, standing aside to allow the Gryffindor in. Potter brushed passed, his eyes scanning the room appreciatively.
in the Slytherin’s room practically screamed ‘Malfoy’; all class, no-nonsense, aesthetically pleasing furniture upon which there was no clutter, no cushion out of place, and certainly no scruff marks.
“What’s in the Gryff—?” Draco began.
“You’re such a
“I guess that’s fair.” Ron bit into a sausage, chewing hastily. “It would be kind of weird seeing you guys acting all friendly all of a sudden.”
Draco leaned closer, eyes alight with fury. “
“Patience,” Draco said in reply as he shut down his laptop. “I will inform you once we are back in our common room.”
“That isn’t—”
A shadow fell across him.
… Draco thought with mild concern.
that this bond wasn’t forced—
“I didn’t think you were the blogging type,” Hermione sniffed as Harry rolled his eyes. “I was... protecting you.”
“Yeah I know and I told him that. I um, may or may not have had a suspicion about you anyway...” Ron glanced slyly at his best friend. “So how long have you liked guys?”
Granger’s eyes were sickeningly kind as they studied him. “After everything that has happened, Draco, you deserve a little happiness.” She held up a hand to silence him as he opened his mouth in indignation. “I am well aware of our past,
“It wasn’t even that late when we went to bed,” Harry said. “What time did you go to sleep?”
Draco blinked. “I guess you wouldn’t have many people around for company…”
Harry quirked his head with a curious frown. Had Hermione missed a crucial part of information? “What do you mean?”
“I’m not sure,” Harry replied honestly. “He looked so desperate and bloody hell it was pretty fucking scary but then he… he just
” Hermione pressed. “He didn’t even see me as a
“Um, excuse me—Draco Malfoy?”
“But—all those stories?”
She chuckled softly. “No, don’t be silly,” she replied. “That’s what we’re here for. Of course, we really have nothing better to do. Off you go! Enjoy your tour.”
“Shh! I’m almost done.”
“What’s the real reason?”
A brief smile tugged at Draco’s lips, lasting until they reached the Slytherin entrance. Without hesitating, the blond spoke the password freely and the wall scraped aside.

Harry sighed sadly, hand coming to a stop on a flick of Malfoy’s hair.
his subconscious replied.
The brunet’s laughter was infectious despite the scowl that crossed Draco’s face.
A soft gasp from Narcissa had Lucius looking up, his grey eyes drawn to the impossibly white owl that was perched on the railing of their bedroom balcony, staring in through the window with intense amber eyes. In its claws was a scroll of parchment. The Malfoy patriarch was across the floor in mere moments to open the window, reaching for the scroll. As soon as the parchment was within his grasp, the owl soared away into the sky, leaving Lucius to blink after it in amazement.
“Same,” they said in unison.
Pansy paused, raising an eyebrow at the blond. “You’ve been in here alone for ages.”
see the day,” Hermione retorted with a sniff, wiping the smirk from Malfoy’s face. “Come on, Harry, we have better company to keep back in our common room.”
Harry allowed a smile to grace his lips. “Aww dang, no fangs?”
“Loathe him?” Ron chimed in.
“Why don’t you two go find a table?” Hermione suggested, reaching into her bag for her purse.
Malfoy paused, eyeing the liquid in his glass thoughtfully. “Maybe she wasn’t completely wrong.”
“Hey, Harry, we’re going to head inside and grab something for lunch to bring out, did you want anything?” Ron asked suddenly, getting to his feet and brushing off blades of grass.
get to know one another…”
“Actually that sounds like a good idea,” Hermione said, pondering that now would be a good chance to speak to him. “I want to ask you something.”
Once his door was shut, candles lit and his laptop on and placed carefully on his bed, Draco allowed himself to relax into his pillows, loosening his tie and placing it on the bed beside him. His shoes had already been removed and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows. No one, not even his housemates—except maybe Pansy—had seen him so casual and at ease.
There were so many thrumming bodies surging around them it was hard to see where one male ended and another began.
,” Voldemort suddenly hissed, his lip curling in fury.
“But this all happens while you remain human,” Hermione continued. “The bond will help in extending your age of course—you’ll probably live as long as Draco will. But you will not need to consume blood as Draco does, nor will you start growing fangs or anything of the sort.”
Before he opened a document, Harry refreshed his dashboard one last time. He blinked in surprise as he eyed the new notification telling him he had a question in his ask box. He clicked on the little envelope, a smile spreading across his face when he saw who it was from.
disappointed when Malfoy hadn’t invited him back to his room after dinner but he’d figured that the Slytherin had as much homework as he did.
“I can’t stay hidden forever, Harry. You’ve had your chance and yet still no one knows about us. I am not a dirty little secret," he murmured.
Blood splattered the pristine snow, deep gashes appearing on the brunet’s arms as he shielded Draco from the damaging boughs. The cracks suddenly disappeared, the constant onslaught of whipped branches pausing as the tree swung back, gathering speed to slam its thick limbs in a fresh brutalising wave. Potter suddenly flung out a blood stained hand, his eyes positively glowing, and the tree began to slow. The branches’ movement drifted to a halt, the entire tree stilling as the spell the brunet had cast took hold. The tree now frozen, Draco dragged his eyes to the brunet as the young man suddenly staggered. Without warning, Potter’s knees suddenly buckled and the brunet hit the snow in a limp slump. Draco sucked in a breath as he climbed to his feet. Every urge within him was screaming to run—to get away while he could. Potter was down and there was no way of knowing how long he would be out for.
Draco wasn’t sure why he had decided to lie to Pansy—after all, he and Potter had already discussed that they would be telling their respective best friends once they returned from holidays.
With her homework done for this evening however and the weekend the next day, Hermione saw no reason why she couldn’t spend most of her night doing what she loved.
“I swear the universe has it in for me,” Draco snarled, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms tightly across his chest. “This is ridiculously unfair.”
Hermione immediately smiled, carefully closing Harry’s art book. “Of course.” She picked up her own laptop bag from beside the desk and they left together, making the trek to the library where surprisingly, there were very few students.
like the guy—”
Ron exhaled loudly. “Okay let me give it a go.”
“That sounds… nice,” he replied. He watched, surprised, when Potter’s face suddenly brightened, a faint red blush ghosting across pale cheeks, hidden almost imperceptibly by dark facial hair. Draco found a sudden urge to rapidly change the subject. “I… is there a preferred method of how I should send my letter?”
“Percy, what the hell.” Ron frowned at the clock. “This guy isn’t our prisoner, he’s our
be the victor—”
Did he really seem that peaceful? Nobody but Pansy had ever seen through his mask before and yet Potter had captured such happiness and even some vulnerability in just a simple expression. Draco wasn’t sure whether he liked this look or if it showed too much weakness.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Who told you?”
about becoming a Healer, yes?” Pansy inquired.
Frustration crashed over him. He had been
Harry smirked. “Is it working?”
Harry cleared his throat. “Do you want to become a Death Eater?”
“Promise?” Ginny demanded.
“Er—I guess?” Draco replied, brain buzzing. Harry’s relief was obvious even to him until he turned to face the culprits. His expression changed instantly, green eyes alight with fury and disappointment as he stared at the two young Gryffindors.
“No more than you,” Harry smirked, returning to his own table.
please… please let it be so…
“So do
Harry thought wryly, pouring a decent amount into his glass.
“Would you tutor Potter? It’d give you the chance to see if you’re compatible.”
“And here I thought the whole Slytherin thing was a gambit,” Harry sniggered.
The older woman looked over him carefully, frowning. “What about you, Mr Malfoy? Are you alright?”
get to be useful and it’s so
Potter threw him a sheepish look. “And I like peace and quiet every so often,” he admitted.
A smirk curled delicately at Draco’s lips.
,” Harry muttered. “You’re all the same.”
Malfoy, his hand on the bulge in Harry’s jeans, squeezed, and the Gryffindor’s eyes instantly rolled back, a moan escaping his mouth as he nodded.
Harry offered a small smile. “I don’t hate you anymore,” he commented.
“Then why the fuck does Potter keep staring at me?”
The brunet gave a sudden exasperated snarl, shoving his hands through his hair. “It’s no use,” he grunted. “He’s so beautiful, and I’m so… well
“Pray tell, Lucius, why it is you deemed it acceptable to return so late.”
And perfect.
“Granger, over here.”
“Do you reckon the first years will be able to handle that?” Ron asked with a frown.
“Do that again?” the male gulped.
Ron held his hands up in surrender, blue eyes kind but extremely doubtful. “I would totally rather you didn’t, mate, you know that,” he began. “He’s such a prissy little shit; how could you
mad at you right now,” she stated. She unfolded her arms, raising her hand again to point at the dejected blond when she stopped, the hand dropping to her side. Instead, she crossed the room, heading for the door. Draco’s head turned around, brow furrowing.
… even despite every explanation Harry had considered, the one Malfoy had just given him had not even been on his list possibilities. If Malfoy had been through all of that… and still was determined to live a somewhat normal life… how could Harry honestly deny him?
Draco chuckled, nodding. “Yes,” he smirked, “biting privileges would be ideal.” Smirk fading, a look of seriousness coloured his silver eyes and he regarded him carefully. “I will give you the time to consider this,” he murmured. “Please don’t rush into your decision—it will not be beneficial for either of us.”
The Slytherin frowned, quirking his head. “Why not?”
what happened between Malfoy and himself. What had occurred between them last night was most definitely still on Harry’s mind. Did he regret it?
“You’re a virgin, yes?” Draco asked, watching as Potter nodded.
might come to care for him.”
Harry sighed softly, imagining a world where snarky blond’s were perfectly polite and charming.
Harry gave her a bland look. “Mione, you know I don’t dance.”
Draco suppressed a growl. Pansy had been on his case about the
Draco snorted. Sometimes he wondered whether or not his subconscious was being helpful or just deepening his insecurity. In any case, there was no point in dwelling in upsetting assumptions. Despite his suspicions, until the truth was revealed, the blond would not have a clear indication as to the intentions behind Potter’s latest actions.
“What do you mean you haven’t started the essay that Professor Snape assigned?” Malfoy frowned at the Gryffindor who shrugged sheepishly.
The female practically snarled the password to enter the Slytherin common room, starting for the Boy’s dormitory immediately. She wasn’t entirely sure that this was where Draco would have been but at least it was a start. In any case, if the blond had indeed come across Potter that morning, this was the logical place for him to retreat to.

showers?”
Oh, yes. There would definitely be a next time.
“H-How did it go, my lord?” Wormtail asked timidly, edging closer.
—it was a gentle cascade of soft black snarls, framing his angular face in a thick black curtain which made his emerald eyes positively gleam. His facial hair had been trimmed instead of clean shaven, giving his hollow cheeks a more appreciative depth. Surprisingly, a seeping heat rippled across Draco’s skin and he dropped his gaze quickly, pretending to rearrange his cutlery with an air of indifference. He had to force his eyes upwards when Potter sat down opposite him, not wanting the other young man to feel as if Draco was ignoring him. He opened his mouth to offer a greeting, when Ginny beat him to it.
He moved his gaze to the side bar, reading the long piece of information that stretched down the entire side of his screen.
Pansy felt her face pale. “And how long can a vampire go without blood?”
Malfoy laughed sourly. “Is it that obvious?” He offered a wry smile. “I may survive as long as Pansy holds out on her promise to return with buckets of chocolate.”
“There we are, Mr Potter.”
“Just saw Harry leave,” she stated, wriggling her eyebrows suggestively as she bounded across the room to sit on the edge of the blond’s bed. “So everything is back to normal then?” She grinned.
“He—he will be summoning you this evening,” Draco’s mother continued, somewhat hesitantly. “I believe he is... quite curious to meet you.”
Eli drew his bottom lip into his mouth but nodded anyway, eager to please.
The ragged brunet nodded in agreement, clearly missing the irony hidden within Draco’s spoken words. Potter scratched distractedly at his hollowed cheek, the motion drawing Draco’s gaze to the returning shadow of dark facial hair.
“How about Ron? I haven’t gone to check on him this morning,” Harry said, closing his art book inconspicuously.
“Different?” Malfoy sneered spitefully. “I didn’t realise you
Potter stepped into the common room, his eyes instantly drawn to Draco curled up on the leather couch. He glanced briefly at the dying fire and waved his left hand in a careless gesture, the flames roaring back into life. A small twinge of guilt wormed its way into his chest as he returned his stare to the blond now awash in firelight; it was obvious Draco had moved the couch purposely closer to the hearth. Harry really needed to make more of an effort to keep the castle warmer. He had gotten so used to his friends and himself being unimpeded by the bitter degree level that he hadn’t even considered Draco’s comfort and wellbeing.
… Harry thought desperately as he silently turned to a fresh page.
The brunet was all green eyes and tousled black hair, a goofy smile on his face as he pulled a red and gold scarf from around his neck. His… deliciously tanned neck. Draco could only stare as the trio paused a little way from the counter, scanning the menu above their heads.
Sitting on the edge of the mattress, Harry’s gaze fell to the closed bathroom door.
… Harry thought with frustration.
“Draco’s initiated the bond.”
Harry swung his gaze in the direction that Hermione was pointing and felt his mouth twist into a grimace. He shook his head rather adamantly at her, only slightly put-out when she pouted.
Potter remained perfectly still, watching the boy’s movements with a curious frown. It had been so long since he’d had physical contact with another—let alone a
“Lazy Slytherin,” Potter retorted.
“Now?” Harry asked wearily.
A frustrated growl fell from Draco’s lips. “And how do you propose I do that, Pansy? We share half of his classes.”
“Go on, Harry,” he urged, inching bit by bit off his stool. His knees brushed against Harry’s. “What does it matter? I can be another notch in your belt and you’d
“Fair enough.”
Harry smiled softly. “Not that I know of,” he replied. Then again, when had anyone shown anything more than a hero’s worship towards him? Liking someone, and being liked in return, was a touchy subject for Harry, especially when many only liked his name and nothing more.
“Harry and I were thinking of see Hagrid during lunch,” he repeated.
“Come along, Draco.”
A hot tongue began to slide down the length of the brunet’s erection, a pair of glistening silver eyes boring into Harry’s all the while. Harry inhaled unsteadily, an intense swell of heat surging through his body so strongly he swayed. Draco emitted a deep chuckle, warm hands gliding over the skin of Harry’s hips to steady him. Even in the blond’s long slim fingers Harry could feel the strength Draco now wielded and he leant into him automatically, trusting his lover not to let him fall. Draco pressed a tender kiss to the crease of Harry’s inner thigh in response, earning him a gentle sigh from the male above.
Harry laughed, nodding. “You got it, Ron.”
Malfoy.”
Harry shrugged again. “It’s up to you, mate.”
“Sounds good,” Hermione replied. “How was Hagrid’s?”
“I’ll draw you a picture,” Harry offered.
“Be that the case, they were obviously never a good friend to begin with,” Malfoy said a-matter-of-factly. “I’ve never understood the ludicrous quarrels between supposed friends over trivial matters.”
” he whispered furiously. “Pansy, what the
“I’m glad you’re feeling better how this, Harry,” Hermione voiced, smiling up at him. “And if you do decide to accept this bond, there are things you will need to know,” she explained, watching as the brunet sunk onto the edge of the mattress beside her. “If you want I am more than happy to inform you of each step so you are able to think about this seriously.”
“Okay,” Harry managed to reply, eyes glazed.
Closing his art book carefully, Harry cocked his head to the side and gazed at the female. “What about?”
He had some reading to do.
His lover’s answering moan of consent was enough to cause Draco’s cock to weep, his fingers massaging the warm, tanned globes of Harry’s arse. He heard his mate’s breath shudder and Draco groaned in reciprocation, Harry pushing back towards him, offering himself. Unable to wait a second longer, Draco parted Harry’s cheeks, his gaze instantly falling on the delicious pink ring that awaited him. As his tongue finally swept over the most intimate place of his love, Draco moaned. The sheer amount of trust Harry was gifting to him right now was overwhelming; it made him dizzy with need. His tongue brushed in controlled, languid strokes over Harry’s puckered entrance before he began to circle the ring with the tip, unable to stop himself from teasing his mate with delicate flicks.
“Not really,” Harry replied honestly.
The blond nodded his head, keeping his gaze lowered. The miniscule flare of contentment that had appeared only moments before was gone now, replaced with the despondent reminder of everything he had given up. But he had saved his father and that was the most important thing. Merlin knows the state in which Lucius would be now if he continued to remain in that freezing cold cell. And his mother had been so
With a smile, Draco acquiesced. He pushed his tongue forward, breaching his mate’s entrance and forcing his tongue deep within. The brunet choked a gasp, fingers curling into the fibres of the rug and twisting painfully even as he pushed himself back once more. He couldn’t believe something so filthily intimate could feel so
Potter sneered. “Listen to what? You trying to make excuses for what you did? You’re not used to being in such a vulnerable state, Malfoy, and it’s getting to you,” he retorted waspishly. “What could you possibly say that could make this better? You could make up anything on the spot right now to try and convince me otherwise but at the end of the day, Draco, you’re just trying to make yourself feel better.”
“Thanks, mate, really,” Ron said excitedly. “I hope this date works.”
Draco glared at Professor Snape’s private room door. He’d waited the appropriate amount of time to be respectful and Snape had yet to allow him inside. Instead, Draco whipped out his wand, dissolved the wards protecting the door as if they were nothing but spindly webs and entered.
… Draco thought with a cheeky grin.
“Yes, we’ve established that.” Pansy shook her head, gazing at her best friend curiously. “Why does the idea of the Golden Boy being your blood-mate repulse you so much?”
The blond kept his eyes closed but made sure he retained a pout on his lips as he allowed Potter to direct him forwards. He tried hard not to focus on how warm Potter’s hands were… nor did he consider how very comforting his touch was. The strength in Potter’s fingers alone definitely had
“And yet, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, I’ve been fine,” Draco retorted. “I’m not exactly about to keel over.”
Ron, oblivious as always, waved his friend goodbye and left for class. Harry followed soon after, trekking back up to his room where he dumped his stuff and headed towards the bathroom. He cringed as he switched on the light. Already his eyes were aching from the throb that sat just behind them.
The Slytherin grinned. “And I believe my declaration of love may have been evidence enough for no longer hating you either.”
his inner voice hissed.
“Uh, hmm, well I’m pretty useless when it comes to choosing wine,” Harry said, gesturing to Malfoy’s empty goblet. “Unless you’re happy with beer?”
“What is it?” Snape frowned.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco sighed, suddenly weary. “I don’t know why I thought I might like him.”
“Do we both not take you seriously?” Harry mused with a smile.
“I’m sure.” Pansy smiled. “So what was it? What has Potter done?”
They worked in silence for the most part, the bubbling of theirs and other’s cauldrons the only source of noise in the classroom. Although Draco was trying his hardest to stay focused, he found his mind wandering often as odd thoughts took hold whilst his concentration was down.
“Glad to see this still works,” Draco murmured against the brunet’s skin.
“W-What?”
Potter smiled but shook his head. “I’m not altogether fond of public displays of affection.”
“You refuse to speak to me. Therefore, I will converse for the both of us. Eventually you will tire of listening to me talk and will no doubt give in and join the conversation. It will be interesting to see how long your stubborn Gryffindor attitude lasts.” Malfoy tilted his head mockingly. “It’s your choice, Potter.”
“I’ll go get Pomfrey,” Ron offered. “I’m sure Harry would appreciate a woman’s touch rather than mine,” he grinned.
Before the blond could retort, another figure waddled into the room. Looking down, Draco stared, bemused, at the walking red clock.
Lost as he was with the questions floating around his brain, Ron barely heard the oncoming footfalls of both Parkinson and Malfoy. With a start, he pressed himself silently against the bricks, praying to whoever was listening that the two Slytherins would not see him as they passed. Thankfully, neither of them noticed him hiding behind the suit of armour and Ron was able to gain a quick glance at the blond’s face.
“No, don’t be daft, Potter,” he replied.
Staring at the blond, Harry nodded, trusting the vampire completely. A beautiful smile lit up Draco’s face and he leant forward once again, grazing his lips against the brunet’s in another tender kiss.
“Funny, I was thinking the same thing.”
“Should be with Ron somewhere—they both have frees,” Hermione replied. “I can’t imagine they’d be anywhere near Malfoy though.”
! We’ll be human again by midnight!”
It didn’t take long before Malfoy was thrashing on the mattress, head thrown back as wave after wave of his released crashed over him.
With surprising speed, the dark figure was there, blocking the blond’s path with a steady growl.
more important than school work.”
this.”
“Granger!”
“Not until we find you a man, Draco,” replied the dark-haired female. “You’ve been such a git lately—you really need to get laid.”
say you find my company
is it?” Potter pulled a face. “Because me and shopping don’t mix.”
“Oh, he’s not—that is—we went to school together is all,” Harry babbled. His cheeks started to warm and Khari smile indulgently.
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively. “Call it what you want. Go get your homework and I’ll meet you in my room.”
“Don’t be jealous that I’m prettier than you.”
“At the moment, yes.”
Harry chuckled darkly. “Completely ridiculous I know.”
“Merlin could you
Harry tapped his lip thoughtfully. “Well, what about the whole stake to the heart thing?”
“You’ll have to go to a muggle town,” Draco said. “The easiest way would be to purchase a prepaid USB device. That way you don’t have to give as many details.”
“Alright, Ginny, that’ll do,” Hermione replied. “Slowly now, don’t spill!”
“What?” the Weasel whined.
as to what had even occurred that night. And as much as Draco desired his mate, he couldn’t bring himself to continue lying to the brunet.
“Nothing a Gryffindor would understand I’m sure,” he replied in amusement.
“Take that You-Know-Who! Harry might decide to date you instead!”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Even if he doesn’t get along with you, he can still recognise hard work and improvement.”
“I’m not sulking,” Draco argued with a mumble. “So what if Granger knows that Potter’s gay?”
“Is that why you’re wearing thirty layers of clothing?” Malfoy smirked, gaze raking over Harry’s form.
A bemused smile appeared on Harry’s face. “I have things I need to do.”
“Then it must be a coincidence that Potter just happens to be sitting where you’re looking?” Pansy rolled her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite his reassurances, his mother did not look entirely convinced and if Draco was honest with himself, even he found it hard to truly believe his own words.
Once he had convinced himself that it was alright to prefer men, Harry began reblogging more and more photos that involved half naked gorgeous men alone or with others.
, he thought, staring unseeingly at the stone.
“Applying his charms,” the dark-haired Slytherin murmured softly in reply, sweeping a casual glance up and down the corridor. So far, she and the Gryffindor were the only ones who had arrived. “I have yet to tell him about our conversation yesterday. I don’t think mentioning Potter’s name and the possibility of him being Draco’s ‘blood-mate’ would go down rather well, do you?”
His footsteps barely made a sound as he stepped down the dark corridors of the dungeons. The shadows were a welcome refuge from the usual bright sunlit hallways of the rest of the castle. Despite the charms he applied, Draco still felt more secure hiding away in the darkness where it was quiet, cool, and had a severe lack of rambunctious Gryffindorks.
Whatever.
“Yet, despite your intense hunger, you did not.” The older woman placed a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I will admit to doubts I had when the Headmaster informed me of your… new predicament. I had expected accidents galore as you became accustomed to your new body and hunger. From what you have just explained, Mr Malfoy, you have demonstrated an amazing strength of self-control not easily matched by most. Why I may not condone the actions that led you to this point, it is obvious you are more than aware yourself of the possible dangers. I hope, for yours and Mr Potter’s sake, that some form of understanding will be established between the two of you so incidents such as this will be avoided in the future.”
notice the subtle differences. His skin was paler, smoother. His eyes, which had always been a striking feature of the blond’s appearance, were brighter, a sharpness within them that told Harry Malfoy’s vision had improved dramatically; Harry felt almost exposed beneath his stare.
To find him a date for Valentine’s Day.
“Yeah!” a voice exclaimed, making Draco jump. He’d forgotten the damn wardrobe was still in the room.
Harry shrugged. “Like all of the—the rumours and, well, I guess the typical stereotype stuff.”
knew.
Right at that present time however, Draco was finding it hard to concentrate as his mind kept wandering back to those blissful hours.
“Don’t even think about it, Potter,” Malfoy snorted. “I refuse to wear that.”
While Draco wondered why the hell his inner voice sounded a lot like Pansy, the blond had gotten himself up off his bed and over to his wardrobe.
“If it makes you feel better, Ronald, no, Draco won’t be able to hurt Harry—not that he’d
“You’re right,” she whispered. “I would prefer him away from the Dark Lord for as long as we are able. Perhaps, if he is allowed, Draco will continue to send us letters.”
Malfoy quirked his blond head to the side slightly in thought. Then he smiled.
“Right on time,” he murmured, straightening and heading over to answer it. He swung the door opened wide. “Welcome, Potter, to my humble abode.”
before you ever used that thing.”
“Mine!” Hermione called cheerfully, smiling kindly at Draco as he handed her the coffee.
“What’s wrong? Are you alright?”
“Thanks,” Draco replied. “The first years’ charm is all but lost on me.”
Draco lowered the mug carefully. “The skim latte?”
“Of which I can no longer visit,” Draco replied with a growl. “It’s not the bloody village, Pansy, it’s the fucking principle.”
, Potter.”
“Of course you do.” Severus rolled his eyes, waving a hand in the direction of his private storeroom. “You know where they are.” He returned to his screen, adjusting it to his preferred position. Draco was curious as to what it was the professor was so interested in but he decided against snooping. If caught, he didn’t want to imagine the sort of horrible thing he’d see… or his godfather’s reaction.
“Your father has been rather boastful about your accomplishments at Beauxbatons. It seems the Dark Lord would like to meet the young man behind the glamour.”
“I find that hard to believe.”
Another voice suddenly perked up. “Oh! Did someone say tea?” Ginny hopped up onto the table, her porcelain eyes widening with happiness when she spied the blond sitting at the table. “Draco!” she beamed, skidding to a halt before him.
“Well come on then!” Ron beamed. “Let’s get moving.”
Harry arched his back when Malfoy suddenly bit his hipbone, sending an array of spectacular shivers coursing through his muscles. So lost as he was in the sensation, Harry barely felt Malfoy drag both his jeans and his boxers downwards.
,” Potter gasped.
and wondered if it was
Aside from a small smile on his lips, the blond said nothing in reply but sat down elegantly in the seat opposite Harry, pulling out his textbooks and parchment. Harry noticed that Malfoy kept his gaze casually averted from his, and he wondered if it was because the blond was nervous.
“Might get me in trouble though.”
“Malfoy? Wanting to make Snape
Ron snorted. “No, you prat,” he said with a shake of the head. “Do you fancy anyone?”
, oh my god I can just imagine them following you around for an autograph.”
“No, sorry,” Harry grinned. “Still, being a dragon would be pretty mad.”
A knock to the door broke the blond from his thoughts and he looked over to the stone wall warily. He got to his feet as the knocking continued, hesitating beside the bricks.
Hermione turned at the familiar voice, her eyes falling on the two Slytherin’s sitting at a desk tucked away in the furthest corner of the library. She immediately focused on the blond, heart sinking at Malfoy’s ragged appearance.
“I think we need to attach bells to that girl,” the brunet commented. “At least that way we’ll be able to hear her coming.”
Dumbledore paused, enjoying the astonished attention he was receiving.
“Shall we ditch this party and make our own?”
“Things are probably going to be very interesting from now on,” Harry murmured with a crooked grin, “are you ready for the impact this is going to have?”
“Allow me take care of you,” Malfoy purred.
“You don’t know that,” Hermione said quietly, but her gaze wavered from his as she drew a breath.
Harry was already waiting for him when Draco arrived. He was sitting on a large stone ledge, gazing out of the snow framed window. Draco felt himself pause, taking a moment study his mate, examining his relaxed posture as he reclined against the wall. Even in jeans, a dark hooded jumper, and sneakers, the dark-haired Gryffindor took his breath away.
“Oh shush,” Hermione snapped. “I’m not going to let this poor boy go hungry.”
Harry’s gaze swept over the lake, a cheeky grin beginning to brighten his face. “Ever been ice skating, Malfoy?”
The bushy-haired Gryffindor suddenly frowned. “But Harry—”
“He’d never,” Harry replied sadly. “Pansy asks him to come to our study groups and he doesn’t. He avoids me, Mione.”
You’ll be the death of me!”
stay in the library?”
Pansy’s face fell. “Oh.”
“It was pretty awesome.” Ron grinned, flames flickering. “Of course half the time Hermione, Harry, and I were busy stopping a mad-man who was, and probably still is, intent in taking over the world.”
“How about this?” Harry smiled, putting the tiara onto his own head. “Happy?”
Shutting down, Draco began reorganising his room, making sure there was nothing Potter would see that could potentially ruin their fun. He smiled to himself as he locked and warded numerous drawers. Potter thought he was coming so they could talk some more; the poor naïve Gryffindor most likely had no idea that Draco wanted to jump him as soon as he walked through the door.
“No, no, Harry, that’s your business,” Hermione said, pausing beside the bed. “I just wanted to make sure that you were happy.”
Taking the pile of parchment out of the drawer, Draco took it into the bathroom and placed it into the sink. He stared at it for half a second and then raised his wand.
Harry rubbed his forehead tiredly, glaring at the Slytherin who merely smirked in response.
In an attempt to distract the brunet, Draco leant forward to kiss him again, running his tongue teasingly along Potter’s bottom lip. The Gryffindor melted into the kiss, just as Draco hoped he would. He kept the male beneath him distracted enough that when he suddenly breached Potter’s puckered entrance with a well lubricated finger, Potter simply moaned in response and opened himself up to the blond.
“She can’t helb anyway.” Draco sniffed pitifully. “Dis a new flu—nothing helbs.”
” they both shouted.
“When has it not been Potter,” Draco replied bitterly, looking down at his hands as they lay haphazardly in his lap.
“What’s wrong?” Pansy asked worriedly.
The brunet had regained consciousness just as Draco was lifting him via a hovering charm. Startled, the blond had cancelled the spell without thinking, causing the dark-haired male to hit the snow unceremoniously. With a mumbled apology, Draco had assisted Potter to his feet, pulling an arm around his shoulders, and the brunet, dazed and confused, had allowed Draco to guide him back inside the castle.
“You’re not wrong.”
Pansy snorted. “Obviously. So what is the relationship between you?”
He flinched suddenly as an unexpected source of light fell across his face. He could hear the rustling of curtains and the smell of disturbed dust. Well, at least wherever they were, it apparently had windows. More rustling, the darkness ebbing away until Draco could tell he was practically bathed in sunlight.
After a few tense minutes where Harry wasn’t sure whether his stomach was going to cooperate or not, he managed to stagger back to bed and slide in beneath the duvet. Class seemed completely irrelevant whilst his head was being destroyed from the inside; hopefully Hermione would come to check up on him and she’d be able to suggest something.
, Weasley
“Certainly,” Hermione said. “Where would you like to start?”
Harry was slightly amazed by the relieved smile he felt quirking his lips. “Noticed that, did you?”
“And that Potter has the hots for you.”
“Oh.” Hermione blinked and smiled awkwardly. “Sorry, my mind got carried away.”
Harry stepped away in disgust, shaking his head in disbelief. “Fuck off, Malfoy. Don’t pull this shit with me.”
Realisation hit Harry hard that he blinked. “You have no idea, do you?”
“Fair enough,” Harry replied, a small smile appearing on his lips. “Damn you and your logic.”
“Oh no, not you, Potter, you’re practically one of the girls.”
With a growl, Voldemort withdrew from Lucius’s mind so forcibly the blond swayed on his knees, his vision swimming.
Hermione’s eyes glittered and Draco immediately rolled his eyes.
The Dark Lord watched the elder Malfoy pale with relish, his sick smile widening as he gestured him to leave.
Harry thought miserably.
,” he exclaimed in an almost-whisper.
“Relax, Harry,” Draco said. “Let me take care of you.”
“I just wanted to—to explain what happened. I didn’t mean—that is—I—” Frustration welled within Draco.
“Shut it, Granger,” Draco growled. “What do you mean, I fixed Potter’s eyesight?”
“See you later, bud,” Ron smiled.
“Draco—don’t!”
Harry sat beneath a large tree, eyes trained on the blond’s defined broomstick stance. In his lap was his art book, drawings of different variations of Draco scattered over the page. Watching the blond fly was slightly breathtaking but capturing his natural essence was even more so. Although Harry would not be able to put these up on Tumblr, having them in his art book for his eyes only sent a thrill down his spine. This was a side of Malfoy that Harry was positive no one knew.
With a final burning kiss, Draco sunk his fangs into his lover’s inner thigh.
. I don’t think he was messing with you in the end. He made a mistake.”
“Maybe I should become an artist,” Harry teased. “Who needs Aurors anyway?”
Malfoy grimaced but otherwise did not say a word. Beside him, Pansy pursed her lips, staring at the Gryffindor with a faint frown.
Draco looked away from the gaping man in front of him. “I can’t continue a relationship when the things that are important to me mean nothing to you.”
Harry snorted with laughter. “Mate, I think she would have seen the flying badger regardless.” He clapped him on the shoulder. “I’ll see you in the common room yeah?”
But the young man was not to be deterred as it turned out.
“Can you blame me?” Ron grunted with a pout. “You’ve gone from one extreme to the other.”
“Yes, I can see that,” Pansy replied with a smirk. “You should probably lock your door then if that is the case.”
Draco released a gentle sigh. “We need to talk,” he stated, seating himself on the chair beside Harry’s bed. There were so many things he should have explained to Harry; so many secrets he’d kept hidden. Leaving it so late to finally be having this conversation sent Draco’s heart into a stampede of concern. What if Harry did not accept his apology? What if his mate did not care of his explanation—
Lightning-Shaped-Scars.
“Where the hell is he?” Pansy growled, looking up and down the corridor for the twelfth time. “If he didn’t want to come to class he could have just said so.”
“She said
The door to the café suddenly swung open, the little bell tinkling angrily as someone stormed out. The three scrambled to get out of the way as a familiar young man with dark hair shoved passed, hard eyes set on the street and hands clenched determinedly at his sides.
Harry grinned, green eyes brightening. “Thanks.”
Harry grinned. “So, are we actually going to get any homework done or was that simply a ruse to have your wicked way with me?” the brunet asked, slyly.
“Just you wait,” Draco replied, lowering his face purposely towards Potter’s neck. The blond had discovered during their intimate moments that Potter had a particularly ticklish spot just above his right collar bone and Draco wasted no time in attacking that spot with his teeth and tongue.
“Of course they have. Honestly, do you doubt me
“Erm—okay,” Harry murmured. He tracked every movement Malfoy made as the blond stood from the chair, stepped towards the bed, and lowered himself gracefully onto the edge of the mattress.
With a sigh, Draco inclined his head. She had, after all, helped him throughout this entire ordeal. He could at least
put those lips of yours to some use,” Malfoy commented, tilting his head ever so slightly to the side.
What did it matter though anyway? Malfoy was a snarky little git and probably always will be. Harry might find him physically attractive but that was as far as the appeal went. Whatever feelings he attempted to shove aside whenever he thought about the Slytherin seemed to be quite content to fuel his rage whenever he and Malfoy clashed.
“Shut up, shut up!” Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly before glaring blearily at the laptop screen. He refreshed his dashboard, breath catching in his throat when he saw the new posts.
… he thought sourly, rounding the corner of the bookshelf. Distracted as he was, Malfoy wasn’t aware of anyone in his path until he walked straight into another figure.
“What’s taking so long?” he growled up at Ron and Hermione who sat on the mantel above the hearth. “I told him to come. Why isn’t he here yet?!”
He groaned. Charlie had acquired a personal interest in making sure Harry was… well looked after… come Valentine’s Day. The bloody tenacious red-head was so damned determined to hook Harry up that he’d willingly left his dragons for an entire week in order to be the ultimate wing-man.
was not prepared to discuss whatever it was Harry was feeling about this entire situation. God, he hardly knew what was wrong himself. Reaching forward, Harry lowered his laptop screen, a faint frown on his face as he stared at the silver sheen, so reminiscent of Draco’s eyes. He stroked the smooth plastic distractedly as he reached for his bag, plonking it onto the table.
“Exactly.
Lifting his head, Potter’s gaze found Draco’s. “I wouldn’t even
“What?”
Draco Malfoy’s eyes briefly closed in annoyance. “Yes, Pansy,” he replied, voice clipped. “For the tenth time I have everything covered.”
… he thought determinedly.
Harry froze. Ron gaped.
“Maybe he’s developed a fear of heights.” Ron grinned nastily. “Or maybe he got hexed with something nasty
“Is he for
Ron glanced at the bushy-haired female once more. “But I dunno… Hermione makes a pretty good point about your obsession with the Ferret.”
The blond quirked an eyebrow. “I guess,” he replied casually.
“Yes,” the shadow hissed, eyes glowing. “But you must promise to stay here forever.”
A sudden drop down menu appeared and Harry scanned the potential options.
“You can adjust the brightness of your screen,” Draco said. “Once we’ve organised your settings.”
Harry sat back against his pillows as he signed out of MSN. Although he enjoyed talking with Hermione, Harry knew if he spent any more time on chat with her he’d end up spilling everything. Already his lips burned with hidden secrets; his fingers itching to retell
“Vampire bites can only be healed by the saliva of one,” Draco explained, a faint pink tinge colouring his cheeks. “I just—I assumed you did not wish to walk around school with such an obvious wound on your neck.”
to write his number down, would it? It wasn’t as if the guy would feel
“Fine, mope. I was just trying to improve your mood,” the brunette replied with a snort, hitching her bag further up her shoulder. Beside her, Harry was leaning against the brick wall, his gaze drawn down the dark corridor to his other classmates. Familiar faces littered the line of students, and yet there was one face in particular which stood out.
“So, you going to tell him?” Ron said, sitting beside the brunet and raising a sceptical eyebrow.
extremely
“But why would Ron like
Ron sat down on the arm of one of the squishy armchairs, the frown on his brow remaining as his gaze travelled back to the boys staircase.
“Details?” Ron asked, a confused frown tugging at his brow as he looked between Hermione and Harry.
he thought, eyeing his reply.
“I’m too good for him anyway,” Draco sniffed. “He’s better off with someone like Longbottom.”
“I think it came out rather nicely,” Pansy continued, examining her nails intently. “You’re just jealous because he hasn’t drawn
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Pans, you can drop the act,” he replied. “All four of us know exactly what you’re doing.”
he thought with a grin.
Draco tapped an elegant finger against his lips, taking note that Potter’s eyes once again followed the movement. His subconscious took great amusement in pointing out the obvious, his mind filling with interesting images.
“It’s just—” Harry flopped down into the spare chair beside her. “There’s something different about Malfoy but I can’t work out what it is. Since you’ll be hanging around Parkinson I was kind of hoping that you’d notice as well and be able to work it out.”
,” Harry snapped, marching down the corridor.
That bloody smile was still on Malfoy’s face and
Everyone ounce of Draco’s being wanted nothing better than to thrust his best friend out of his way and claim the male that was his. He cared not for the room full of students; his craving for Potter outweighed the threat of witnesses. It was the last lingering thread of his humanity that stopped him, and he took a single step back, jaw locking and hands clenched at his side. Pansy kept her wand on him until Draco had slid back into his chair, eyes boring a hole into the desk before him. Mercifully, no one besides Pansy had noticed his abrupt change of character, which had been an added perk of their chosen position within the classroom.
The blond released a frustrated sigh. “You can’t just
“Er—yeah, sure,” Potter stammered out.
“What if Draco agreed to tutor you? Would you do it?”
“That’s me,” the red-head grinned, rubbing his hands together in an excited fashion.
pretty smart; it sort of makes sense that they should be study partners and all.”
the derisive sneer that he knew was currently on Malfoy’s face. He watched, relieved, as Eli conceded surrender and snatched his cloak from the back of the chair. With a final sulky glare, Eli turned away and left the bar.
“No,” Hermione whispered in reply, turning to Ron. “But he doesn’t look very well either.”
reactions.” Snape swished his wand, the directions appearing on the board before them. “This potion requires you to brew in a silver cauldron. For those who do not own a silver cauldron, you may retrieve one from the storeroom. Please refrain from the overuse of conversation.”
Malfoy laughed softly. “Because it’s more fun this way.”
Potter was frowning, staring at Draco as if he’d grown another head. With a quick quirk of his head, the blond drew in a silent steadying breath and took a half step back.
The Slytherin snorted. “It’s not like that,” he tried to reassure himself. He stared at the pile of paper for a minute longer before coming to a conclusion.
And Harry did so, lying on his stomach without a second thought. The gentle caress of the white rug felt wonderful against his heated skin and he sighed, feeling his lover’s hands run themselves soothingly down his back as Draco’s body moved, fitting in between his parted thighs.
had he felt this before.
The blond picked up his laptop and took it over to his desk, booting it up. Hermione had sent him some of her notes from their study session this evening, he might as well go over them whilst he was waiting. Reaching for the drawer on his left side, Draco was sure he remembered having a pile of spare parchment—
” Harry snarled.
The brunette frowned, tilting her head in confusion. “What do you mean?”
“Because I have one as well!” Hermione folded her arms and glared. “You didn’t tell me!”
The blond jerked his head up, eyes wide as he gawked at the dark-haired female. He hadn’t even realised she had been speaking.
Draco cringed inwardly, fingers fiddling with his quill. “I don’t... hate him.”
“Just don’t get your germs all over it,” Harry teased, making sure both Ron and Hermione had everything they needed.
“Tell Hermione about Malfoy this morning,” Harry said persistently.
Hermione still looked doubtful but Harry was determined to get his best friends together. They deserved to be happy.
He’d been shopping in muggle London with his mother who seemed quite taken with the jewellery they sold, when he’d passed by a store filled with strange gadgets. He’d stopped to have a closer look, nose crinkling at what the muggles had come up with. When he’d found the laptops, however, his face lost the look of pure distain and he began to look with earnest. It was when the cute sales assistant came forward, explaining which laptops were better and asking what sort of programs Draco was after that the blond found himself seriously considering buying one.
fault!”
I suppose not…” He bit his bottom lip, hips thrusting into Draco’s hand. “Oh god, D-Draco,
Ron pressed the small square button carefully, the monitor flashing as the machine switched on, humming contently in the red head’s lap.
The Gryffindor smirked. “Much obliged.”
Slowly, the two males turned to stare at Hermione who held their gaze, brown eyes steady. Her fingers tightened their grasp on his arm, her thumb stroking soothingly. “Look,” she began, “I told Malfoy—”
” the brunet roared. His magic lashed out, exploding the already damaged chair lying a few feet away. Not a split second later did a bedside table behind Draco suddenly shatter and the blond felt his terror leap.
“I’ll go grab my cloak!” Eli said excitedly. “I’ll meet you at the entrance?”
Draco’s mouth practically watered at the sight of Potter’s straining length which was masked by a pair of red (
Harry laughed aloud. “That’d be pretty cool. Hogwarts will have its own social site.”
His subconscious remarked.
Lucius stared up at Voldemort. “My lord?” he questioned. “Do you mean—?”
The candelabra glanced towards Hermione who fixed a glare on the brunet.
All of the laptops were the same pretty silver with the Hogwarts crest print in black in the middle of the top screen lid.
In the end, the two boys were not expelled as Severus demanded they be. Instead, they were both suspended and given detentions for the rest of the school year, to be spent with both Snape and McGonagall. All privileges were revoked and a note was made on their records. Draco was that bone tired he didn’t even care. Potter had seemed outraged on his behalf though, agreeing with Professor Snape that their actions weren’t just idiotic and silly, but cold blooded and just plain nasty.
“Could we do that a little bit later? I want to see what I can do with mine but the last time I tried... it frightened me.”
“Make up more lies?”
“Hiding? Harry’s hiding nothing!” Percy yelped, hopping up the stairs after the male.
“Or maybe I’m just too good.” Harry grinned at his reflection, ruffling his damp hair. Gryffindor had won three hundred and fifty points to eighty so Harry was in an ecstatic mood as he got dressed. Ron was humming happily beside him, blue eyes alight with happiness.
. And you
“Um, Harry, would you like to pull this with me?”
Pansy’s frown grew. “I don’t like it when you lie to me,” she said in response, keeping her voice low.
So who was this mystery male that Potter was so intrigued by? A list of names began to run themselves through Draco’s mind, each one more disgusting than the other.
“No, Eli,” Harry murmured. “Unfortunately, I don’t find myself much in the mood.”
“Leave him alone, Hermione,” Ron stated. “Harry is well within his rights to be mad at you right now, and you deserve it.”
Harry rolled his eyes as Ron trailed off into the possible, awful injuries Malfoy may have obtained over the summer holidays. Truth be told, he too had been surprised when Malfoy’s name had not been on the Slytherin’s Quidditch team roster. As much as Harry was thankful that the blond was no longer going to play against him, a little bit of Harry was disconcerted with the sudden change in normality. It had always been the same way, he and Malfoy, on the pitch, racing against one another…
Draco bit his lip.
He looked strangely beautiful.
“No, we’re not,” Hermione said strongly.
unwell and needs our help? Will you ditch him for class?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Make it a man and you’re on,” he replied automatically.
By this time, even Hermione was beginning to get a glazed look in her eyes as she stared at their teacher. Harry was amused to note when she finally gave up and decided to browse her dashboard as well.
“Your father,” she began, her voice shaking, “your father hasn’t returned. I—I think he’s in trouble.”
their mate. If Draco was frightening you, Harry, he would not have been able to bring himself to hurt you in any way or form, regardless of how desperate he was for you.”
“Alright,” Hermione agreed. “Have a good afternoon.”
“Goh away, I’m sig.”
Draco shook himself. What was he
“Why do you?” Pansy frowned. “Last week you wanted to embarrass him like nothing else.”
who fixed Harry’s eyesight.”
“My question was rather personal,” Potter replied, staring at his hands. “I should have been more considerate—”
Settling his laptop on his thighs Draco typed his password and entered into his settings. Already the wallpaper had been changed to the one he used at home and his icons arranged to how he preferred them. As he opened his internet browser, Draco’s mind began to wander back to when he’d stumbled across his first laptop.
A flurry of embarrassed butterflies swirled in Harry’s stomach and he pushed the thought away.
Malfoy had touched him so intimately. Had taken his
The brunet cringed.
“Disgusting,” Hermione moped. “Do I loog as bad as I feel?”
“Harry?” she questioned with a faint frown, “why are you spearing your sausage with vigour?”
“Kinky,” he said.
“Do you have plans for Monday night?”
“I decided to grace you with my presence,” Harry grinned, looking back down and continuing his work.
“I know,” she replied, laying the bag across his lap. “I’ll grab you some clothes to change into during dinner, okay?”
Malfoy’s nose crinkled. “Beer does not suit my palate,” the ex-Slytherin said haughtily. “If you message me detailing what you intend to cook I shall provide a suitable wine.”
“Haff the school already is,” Draco sniffed. “Anober reason why I do not wan to goh to the Hospital Wing.”
Pansy shrugged elegantly. “I found him drawing before one of our study lessons and I asked him about it. He said he liked to draw people and I asked him if he would draw me. At first he seemed reluctant but I persevered.”
“Oh, yes… right.” The Potions Master cleared his through awkwardly. “Go ahead, Draco, I’ll be a few minutes.”
Pansy stared. “But you only fed the other day,” she stated.
Pansy snorted elegantly but decided against making another snide comment. Instead, she squeezed Draco’s hand, made sure he was set with everything he needed before leaving him to rest, exiting his room silently.
Pansy eyed him suspiciously. “How
Draco lowered himself into his chair. “I’m screwing around with Potter.”
“Yes, to a degree.” Hermione smiled soothingly at him, her porcelain face glinting merrily in the firelight.
Spying a staircase nearby, the blond made towards it, stepping up each stair carefully. The moonlight did not reach as effectively as he’d hoped, and the further Draco climbed, the more he found it rather disorientating trying to measure the size and location of each step as they spiralled around. Each door he passed was locked and no
It had taken all of his strength to leave Potter after their conversation that afternoon. Draco had been close—
With those finals words, Ron brushed passed the silently weeping girl. Hermione stared after him, knowing full well she deserved the guilt she could feel swirling inside. She watched, miserable, as Ron left the dormitory without so much as a glance back.
“Harry isn’t exactly the best at hiding his feelings,” Draco continued. “And from what I can gather, it seems that a lot of what he was feeling when he told me he had forgiven me might have been based on cravings, rather than the honest consideration that he should have been doing.”
Draco thought miserably.
At once, that thought process was immediately hushed. Draco had seen for himself the power Potter wielded, there would be no way his parents would be able to save him from his current prison. He wouldn’t be able to risk their freedom…
“Your essay was fine,” Draco replied as he and Pansy entered the library. “Perfectly acceptable.”
“Because,” Draco retorted, thinking up a reply to Potter’s question as he opened the other male’s Ask Box.
Harry grinned, glancing at Ron. “I, er, had a sleepover with a friend.”
Cool grey eyes masked the swirling inner emotions that threatened to break through. He braced himself for the next words that left his mouth.
Voldemort thought maliciously.
feel better, you prat.”
Narcissa allowed her son to pass, concern on her face as she watched him climb the stairs.
“Both of you are a pair of fucking—
…” She held up Harry’s laptop bag, pleased when her best friend’s face lit up with a smile.
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” Harry sulked as Hermione offered a smug grin.
Draco stumbled, another wave of agony surging through him. He winced, rubbing his sternum tenderly as the emotions of his mate tore mercilessly at his chest. Leaning against the cool of wall of the dungeon corridor, the blond could do nothing but wait until this particular wave of Harry’s emotions subsided. For the past half an hour Draco had been swarmed with his mate’s feelings, all of them unpleasant. He did not know exactly what had happened but judging from the vast range of agitated emotions, Draco was positive it had had something to do with him.
” he interrupted the red-head before Ron could exclaim his indignation, “nothing happened, alright? He wanted to bite me and he tried, but for some reason he—he just wasn’t able to.”
most of them!”
“I can only imagine,” Hermione mused, eyeing the sign with delight. “Well come on then, let’s go inside. I would love a coffee and maybe we can get Harry a boyfriend.”
“Alright.” Potter nodded thoughtfully. “Do you want to start?”
Blinking, Harry realised his freckled best friend was frowning faintly at him.
,” he recited. “Snape means the potion we’re currently studying doesn’t he?”
Excited, Harry searched for Tumblr instead, clicking on the link that appeared and following the prompts. His excitement grew as he realised this was exactly what he was after; a place to be himself, post whatever the hell he wanted and follow others who shared similar tastes.
“I don’t believe you.”
“Don’t worry about that, Draco always did have trouble accepting the fact that he didn’t always get what he wanted,” Pansy replied. “Do you realise how much that crushed, Draco? To have the Great Harry Potter cast him aside for a Weasley; he’s never gotten over it.”
“You wait until you discover the internet,” Harry grinned. “Here I’ll show you my Facebook.”
The Gryffindor exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t know,” he replied truthfully. “I’m still coming to terms about a lot of things. I think I still need some time.”
Harry’s jaw dropped. “
I promise to stick by you, alright?” Shaking his head, the male reached forward and clasped Harry’s shoulder, gripping it firmly. “But, mate, you do realise that you can’t just ignore this. Regardless of what’s happened, you’re still Malfoy’s blood-mate, and you’re going to have to make a decision sooner or later.”
to see how you react when you discover it’s
“I hope that’s homework you’re doing,” Hermione replied suspiciously. “You look to be enjoying that too much.”
“It’d be nice to have some photos with you guys,” Hermione replied honestly. “But the last time I checked there were only a few wizarding cameras around and none of them were compatible with our laptops.”
“You know, being honest with yourself is the first step in admitting you have a problem.”
Despite the glare plastered to his face, Harry could feel the familiar unwanted flicker of interest growing within him. If the blond prat wasn’t so damn physically attractive it would have been a hell of a lot easier for Harry to squash the notion of temptation from raising its infuriating head.
Speaking of which...
Potter grinned but, Draco was happy to note, did not make an effort to remove himself from his proximity.
As the wind grew stronger, it began to carelessly toss falling snowflakes around them and Draco watched as Potter’s face light up, the brunet lifting his head to gaze at the sky.
“Good boy,” Draco smiled indulgently, releasing the grip he had on Potter’s wrists.
“I think we should head up to Gryffindor tower and see if Harry’s there,” he announced, turning to Hermione.
The desolate dark dungeon common awaiting him had Draco shivering. Down there, all
Harry summoned the box that lay on his bedside table and handed them to the red-head before returning to Hermione’s side, double checking her temperature.
“Get your filthy mind out of the gutter, Pansy.”
“With Draco’s luck lately I wouldn’t be so sure,” Pansy said wryly. She glanced at her watch with a frustrated sigh. “I better go find him… just in case.”
There was still a hint of uncertainty on Potter’s face.
“From Pomfrey?” Pansy frowned.
Potter looked positively lethal. What frightened Draco the most however, was the intensity of the pure energy that seemed to surround the young man. The air positively hummed with the tangible force, causing the hairs on Draco’s skin to stand on end. Forcing himself not to shake, the blond stepped towards the other male.
“Of course I have,” Harry hissed with irritation. “I’m not an idiot.”
He sucked in a deep breath, closing his eyes momentarily. “Nothing,” he uttered after a moment, lips barely moving.
Then he ran.
“Liar.”
“—so? This bet happening or not?”
The room was silent for a moment as Harry collected his thoughts. He had known that the bond was important, at least, to some form of degree, but he hadn’t realised just
“Ron,
“I look forward to
The blond made sure his figure was hidden as Potter bypassed him on his way out of the library. The glint in Draco’s eyes grew, his skin tingling.
“Oh.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, gazing at the blond. “So… would you like to?”
Blinking, Draco glanced down.
“Probably for the same reason
“Impress him with your good sense of humour!”
“Still no sign of him?” Ron asked, craning his neck as he too, glanced up and down the table.
A sigh seeped out of the blond, his hand moving from the grip he’d maintained on Harry’s shoulder to his cheek. Cautious hope trickled into the brunet’s chest at the familiar touch of Malfoy’s fingers, the strokes on his skin soothing his panic.
Finding his preferred potion, Draco forced it down, savouring the immediate effects he felt as it passed through his body. Gone was the urge to yawn and slump. Instead his eyes brightened and he felt a new sense of urgency to do things.
The brunet stopped when the blond did, his eyes darting up to Malfoy’s face to gauge his expression. His mask was firmly in place as he returned Harry’s probing stare impassively. Harry quirked an eyebrow in a silent request. Finally, ever so slowly, Malfoy’s face began to relax, a hint of unease colouring his eyes.
“Maybe later,” the blond commented, his eyes still trained on the dark corridor at the top of the stairs.
“Yes.”
“Hello?” he called again tentatively.
Harry’s back arched, his fingers latching onto the blond’s upper arms and digging almost painfully as Draco kissed him senseless. He felt Malfoy’s arms wrap around him, his body pulled flush against Malfoy’s, and a delicious hardness begin to rub against his thigh. Harry trembled, moaning as Draco suddenly left his mouth to press hot, open kisses on his neck.
“And if I do?” Draco grumbled, marching back to the side bench despite himself. He slid two of the mugs into one hand skilfully and grabbed the third in the other. He straightened his back purposefully and crossed the dark wooden floor, coming to a halt beside the trio’s chosen table.
Draco looked so defeated Pansy didn’t have the heart to tease him. Instead, she crawled up beside him, laying her head on his shoulder.
“Vampires have unusual relationships with their… mates,” Hermione said. “Generally, they are able to feed from various humans at their leisure. Malfoy feeds from you, doesn’t he?”
“Believe him about what?” Ron frowned. “Come on, mate, it can’t be that bad.”
“Harry?” Hermione called, knocking on Harry’s bedroom door.
Draco had not felt this content whilst being within such close quarters with his mate ever. For the first time since he had returned to Hogwarts in his new condition, Draco found himself feeling more like his old self, even with Harry just across the room from him. There was no urge to claim the male, no distracting growling hunger that had forever felt unsated. He could not believe the difference in his concentration as Professor Binns began his lecture. His body seemed to exuberate a sense of serenity that radiated unseeingly around him, so much so that even Pansy, who sat beside, could explicitly feel the dissimilarity.
Draco sighed. “
“What do you think?” Pansy sneered. “Stop being such a prat and go see Snape right now. I am
“You’ve never taken the time to hear most of my jibes then, Potter.”
“Shut up,” Harry groaned, tucking his wand away and rubbing a hand over his flaming face. A spot on the side of his neck began to tingle, the same spot that Harry could still feel the two pinpricks from his dream. “You just startled me is all…”
Harry shook his head, offering a reassuring smile. “Not as long as I keep using the same charm Healers do when dealing with contagious patients.”
Draco Malfoy stood beside Pansy Parkinson, his blond hair shining even in the gloom on the dungeons. The male’s grey eyes were constantly scanning the other students in an almost calculating and shrewd manner. Harry didn’t remember the Slytherin being so… cautiously observant before. Despite the caginess, Harry couldn’t help but appreciate the way Malfoy appeared. His skin, which had always been pale, was even more so, his eyes glinting a sheen of silver whenever his gaze moved.
Their bodies, slick with water, were inseparable; a tangle of limbs as their mouths sought for areas to kiss, nip, and suck. Harry’s mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions with a desperate edge; he could barely keep himself standing let alone talk. When he felt Malfoy’s fingers over his arse, the brunet could only hiss a single word.
“I don’t like to stand people up?” Potter started in surprise as he realised his back was now pressed against the wall. With no room to escape, Draco made his move. He stood in front of the dark haired beauty, placing his hands on either side of Potter’s head. He stared down at Potter whose eyes had shifted to his. They were bright with nerves, embarrassment and something else that made Draco shiver.
was defending
Potter immediately arched into the embrace, his hands coming to rest on Draco’s upper arms, fingers digging into his skin. He groaned into the Slytherin’s mouth, breath catching as Draco ghosted his fingers down his throat, curling around to stroke the soft skin on the back of the Gryffindor’s neck. Something awoke within Draco’s chest. Something hot, insatiable, and desperate. He kissed Potter until the young man was weak in the knees and his cheeks were flushed a deep red.
With painful, controlled movements, Malfoy began to turn, his wide eyes falling onto the Gryffindor who paused a few steps away.
“Basically,” the brunet began, shifting his stare to the ceiling, “I’ve been getting to know this guy over Tumblr all year. He was smart, funny… and just really nice to talk to.” Harry paused then, his eyes growing wistful; sad. “Turns out it was Malfoy all along, messing with me. I put up things on my blog that I didn’t expect any of you guys to see… let alone him.”
“Mmm, to a degree,” the blond replied. “Stop teasing me, Potter.”
Malfoy shook his head. “I do not believe so. I have never heard of a wizard getting ‘cancer’.” He shivered abruptly. “Spattergroit however…”
Malfoy’s deep chuckles seem to fill the corridor as he led Harry away from their hidden alcove. The brunet followed in a willing daze, his cheeks flaming, body warm from the intensity of the kiss. It wasn’t until they reached the seventh floor that Harry realised where Malfoy was leading him and an immediate swirl of anticipation rose in his gut. He licked his suddenly dry lips as the doors to the Room of Requirement appeared, the familiar dark wooden doors materialising before their eyes. Malfoy reached for the handle and, with a quick heated look at his mate, pushed open the door and pulled them both inside.
“How do you turn it on?” Ron asked.
The Slytherin drew in a breath. He swallowed.
“Can I help you, Mr Malfoy?”
“Harry? What’s wrong?” she asked.
“For all of those who are muggle-born or may be knowledgeable with the muggle lifestyle, Hogwarts is now introducing a brand new system that you will no doubt be experienced with. For those who have had no interaction with muggles what-so-ever, this new system will not be entirely difficult to learn and even I can express my pleasure in how much fun it can be.” Dumbledore chuckled humorously, oblivious to the many whispers that had broken out across the students. Many of the teachers were looking excited, if not nervous, at the idea of the new system. They of course had been informed of such a change over the holidays. Professor Snape on the other hand, looked downright miserable.
“Fine,” Percy huffed, folding his arms. “Glass of water. Crust of bread. And then—”
“I am aware of that,” Draco snapped. “I am as confused as I’m sure
Harry could feel himself trembling, holding himself back so Draco could adjust, his eyes squeezed tightly shut.
to disregarding all rational thought and claiming the delectable brunet as his own in front despite the audience they would receive.
these decisions for him, Hermione!”
“How is he?” Ron murmured. “Does he have boils?”
“We’ve hit a little snag,” the Slytherin replied. “Draco’s discovered he becomes rather irrational whenever he gets too close to Potter.”
Throwing a quick glance over at the brunet, Draco couldn’t help but agree.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry muttered, returning his gaze to his essay.
“Shall I get us some more liquid courage?” Potter asked then.
The blond turned around, a hint of bewilderment evident on his face for a mere moment before it was masked. He nodded. Harry cocked his head to the side, indicating to the other male that he wanted them to speak alone. Taking the hint, Pansy turned away and continued up the stairs, a small smile on her face. Malfoy, who was gazing at Harry curiously, followed the brunet without a word until they were safely hidden from prying eyes and ears.
“Prehistoric bugger,” Harry muttered.
The grin that Harry threw her way was brilliant, his green eyes brightening immensely. “Ro-on likes you, Ro-on likes you,” he sang.
“Just think about it, will you?” Pansy persisted. “Draco doesn’t hate you anymore and although his attitude is similar to yours I think it would be… beneficial to the both of you.”
With a snort and a shake of his head, Harry pushed open a door to the courtyard. As he stepped out into the warm sunshine, Harry seriously considered possible jinxes to stop the blond from speaking continuously. Alright, so the prospect of becoming friends with the git had initially been alarming, but there was really no reason why Harry couldn’t warm up to the idea, not since the realisation he’d made about being
With a silent curse he looked away, grateful for the distraction as Profession Snape stalked into the room. Obsidian eyes swept across the class, lingering for a split second on Draco who met his stare steadily.
“How is it cliché?” Harry frowned.
He shook his head stubbornly, keeping his arms folded.
“She’ll associate it with your death.” Ron grinned. “Her predictions are becoming a lot more fun, especially when the class starts giving her ideas about what could happen.”
“And why would I do that?”
“But you must!” they replied in unison.
“Whinge, whinge, whinge…”
“It’s been a while, Draco, do you need…?” Pansy’s hand hovered over her left wrist as she gazed at her friend. With a brief look in her direction, Draco shook his head.
Pansy cleared her throat delicately. “There’s a rather spacious alcove near the Astronomy Tower,” she suggested with a knowing smirk. “Out of the way, hardly
Ron’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at Malfoy. There was something off about the blond; his smile was too forced as he conversed with Parkinson, his actions too deliberate. The female seemed to have guessed that something was wrong and was attempting to dig for details Ron was sure. The much too casual way Malfoy was brushing her off did not sit very well with Ron and a sinking feeling began to appear in his gut.
“Or I would have just given up,” Draco admitted.
“What are you doing?” Harry half gasped.
Harry stepped forward determinedly. “It’s okay,” he repeated. With slightly trembling fingers, he lifted his hands to his tie, loosening the knot and tugging the material away. He held Malfoy’s gaze as he did, watching as the vampire’s eyes followed his every movement. He couldn’t help but shiver at how hungry the intense silver eyes appeared, tracking each pull of the material with such burning desire it set Harry’s blood on fire. With one final tug, Harry removed the red and gold tie from around his neck and allowed it to drop to the floor in a silken puddle.
, I just…”
Harry grinned. “I couldn’t resist making you suffer. Plus, you deserved it,” he replied. “Consider the agony you were in for the past week whenever you think about lying to me in the future.”
A split second passed before the hospital wing matron was bursting out of her office, robes fluttering madly as she rushed towards them. Her gaze landed on Harry and a knowing looked passed instantly over her face.
“It’s now or never,” Draco murmured. Straightening his spine, Draco made his way to the seat opposite Potter, sliding in gracefully and nodding towards the slightly surprised Gryffindor.
But that was just it—Draco was not the same person he used to be.
Students were staring at them in the corridor, a few worried faces flitting back and forth between him and Harry, most likely petrified that curses would soon fly.
“I suppose that’s fair.” The Slytherin sniffed.  “Thank you, Granger.”
Harry raised his hands. “Hey, as long as she plays nice, I don’t have a problem,” he said honestly. He looked at Ron who shrugged.
“You’re such a
Harry’s hand unconsciously drifted down his stomach and towards his cock which was beginning to show signs of interest, his fingers gently caressing along the length.
“My—my Lord,” Narcissa stammered. “Did you wish to… join us?” Her offer was weak but Draco groaned silently all the same.
Draco felt his heart plummet.
of all people condemn your best friend to
Harry smiled. “Because you don’t see me as anything other than who I really am.”
Potter’s brow crinkled in confusion. “How do you remain so confident?” he asked, voice croaky.
“Ronald!” Hermione scolded from beside them. “That’s disgusting.”
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Draco replied, picking up a toasted croissant. Instead of eating it however, he began to pull it apart as his gaze wandered back to where Potter was sitting. It had been a shock to see the dark haired Gryffindor enter the Great Hall that morning without his glasses; Draco wondered why it was that Potter had suddenly decided not to wear them.
” Harry spat, cutting her off. “Hermione, he—he—” but he couldn’t bring himself to say the words. The brunette had no idea what had actually occurred between the two them and Harry wasn’t sure whether or not he wanted her to know. Nausea swirled in his stomach. God, all those times the memories of his apparent dream had swarmed him, warmed him, made him crave something he’d imagined had been out of reach…
“Hey, Parkinson isn’t that bad either,” Harry interjected. “She can be really funny at times.”
“Come here and I’ll show you.”
,” Ron remarked with a cheeky grin. “Harry has no coordination whatsoever—aside from quidditch that is.”
The sound of his name falling from Potter’s lips sent a shock of electricity straight for the tip of Draco’s cock.
“And?” Pansy whispered earnestly.
the shower?” Potter managed to mumble, eyes heavy lidded as he gazed up at Draco.
Harry heard the unspoken insinuation in the female’s voice and frowned. “Come on, Mione, just tell me. I’d rather know all of this now before getting sprung with another surprise.”
“Well he’s not going to like you in return if you keep being an arse,” Hermione interjected.
Before long, Harry had copied down all the notes from the board and, considering that Snape was immersed in whatever it was he was doing, Harry decided that some net browsing wouldn’t go amiss. He checked his email first and was happy to see an email from Malfoy.
“Why?”
“Why did you walk to class with Malfoy just now?”
Hermione smiled tentatively at Harry who quirked an eyebrow.
“What? Do I have a crush on you as well?”
“Liking him and caring for him are two completely different things,” Draco clarified. “Aren’t we allowed to enjoy ourselves without making it too difficult with silly female emotions?”
“Okay um, how should I do it?”
“I know this entire situation is frustrating for you,” she said gently. “But remember no matter what happens I will stick by you, alright?”
“You don’t have to,” Pansy grinned. “It’s written all over your face.”
“Have somewhere to be?” Hermione inquired innocently.
With a frustrated sigh, Harry flopped onto his back, glaring up at the ceiling of his four-poster bed. It was two in the morning and the brunet had yet to fall asleep. A mantra was currently running through his head, peaking his distress and preventing his slumber.
“I suppose so.”
Leaning forwards, Draco pushed his lover back against the wall and aligned his body fully against him.
Potter’s bewildered look quickly faded into realisation as Draco began to push his way inside of the male below him. It was Potter’s sharp intake of breath and his hands tightening their hold on Draco that helped hold the Slytherin back. Despite stretching Potter as much as he could with his fingers, Draco was well aware of the sense of invasion and pain that accompanied the initial penetration—especially for someone’s first time.
“Oh my god.”
Harry grinned. “Does that mean I can I return that favour with photos of half naked men?” Despite the challenge in his voice, Harry’s heart was pounding a mile a minute, worried how Hermione was going to react to this sudden news.
Relief eased throughout Harry’s muscles. It was eerie how well Malfoy read him at times—perhaps it truly
“Potter, you are a Gryffindor, it’s natural for you to suck at Potions.”
“Well that would be a problem if I was actually lying then, wouldn’t it?” Draco took a bite of his sandwich, still refusing to meet her stare.
The teapot’s exclamation drew the blond away from his thoughts. Hermione was beaming.
Draco sneered at the screen.
“Just… don’t be too late,” Hermione said finally. “And don’t get caught! You’re the Head Boy, Harry, you’re meant to be setting an example.”
Draco swallowed his current mouthful, reaching for Ginny to take a small sip of tea to soothe his suddenly dry throat.
“Haven’t most Professors adapted to receiving printed documents?” Harry asked, watching her closely.
, Potter, will you just listen to me!”
Parkinson rolled her eyes. “Of
“Fine, we’ll go over it again tonight, alright?” Draco promised, spying a table in a rather secluded corner.
“Draco, I—” she sighed. “I just don’t want to see you get hurt. It would be so easy for people to turn on you now… I don’t… I don’t want that to happen.”
Draco had managed to escape Pansy after dinner, only to be hunted down by a bushy-haired Gryffindor.
Harry thought, trying desperately to make light of the situation. He reached out for the door and pushed it open, a wondrous warmth greeting them as they stepped inside the Black Stump. Almost instantly, Harry could feel the tension draining out of his muscles; the familiar scent of fine spirits and cedar wood drew him in with a welcoming embrace. The two of them removed their cloaks and Harry did his customary sweep of the patrons inside.
"I know a spell that will seal your lips shut, Malfoy," Harry said in warning.
"You cannot possibly still be cold," said Draco.
"I said I was sorry!"
Draco nodded slowly and then once again, more firmly. "Yeah," he replied. "Let's return to Hogwarts."
"Okay, I'm moving," grumbled Harry. He drew back slowly, smirking when Draco twitched and hissed as Harry's cock dragged over his prostate. He thrust in again and repeated the process until he'd established a smooth rhythm. Draco signaled his approval by hooking his ankles behind Harry's back and clutching at his shoulders with strong fingers. Harry suspected he'd have bruises in the morning, but this was completely worth it.
Narcissa ascended the final two steps into Draco's cavern and greeted him with a smile and a hug. "I was hoping to catch you before you left for the mainland," she said.
"Are you sure you feel okay?" asked Harry. "You were peaky this morning."
With Ineville following, Hagrid carried Harry's body to the home of Miracle Maxophilius.  Ineville knocked on the door, only to be berated by Miracle Max.
Snaperdinck cocked his head to the side.  "To the pain?  I'm not sure I follow."
Harry nodded and left before Draco could question him further. He all but jogged up to Intake on Ward Four. "Where is Healer Granger?"
"What am I going to do?"
Harry waited until that evening. Dinner had been a mellow affair, after which clean-up was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Harry and Draco settled onto the sofa in the lounge to watch an old film on the telly. The more relaxed Draco became, the more tense Harry got. He was gearing up for battle, while Draco had no idea he was about to be ambushed.
Once again, Lucius seemed to grow and solidify. "Never," he hissed. "It is my mission to haunt Potter until he dies screaming."
Potter hunched his shoulders in a feline shrug.
After a long moment spent on the cold ground, Harry sat up and rubbed his sore shoulder. "This is absurd," he muttered. "How are we to clean up the roadside if we can't even stand, let alone walk?"
"We can and we will," growled Zabini.  "Need I remind you two of everything I've done for you?  Ineville, you were a drunken lout," he said, addressing the dark-haired swordsman.  "Hagrid, you were in a traveling freak show until I rescued you and gave you a job."
It was Malfoy's turn to yelp when Harry fell and dragged him down to the cobbles. They landed in a heap, cursing and punching one another. Harry ended up on top of Malfoy, sides heaving as he panted for breath, specs lost somewhere on the road, and sporting wood. He was too tired to fight any longer, and it seemed Malfoy agreed. He lay unmoving, eyes closed and breathing hard. Speaking of hard...
Salzaria drew back and cocked her head at him. Her attention turned to the opening of the cavern when Hedwig landed on the ledge with a scrape of talons.
"But-"
Harry's automatic response was to refute that it was not
"It's always belonged to you," Harry told him. "Doesn't mean I can't play with it, too."
A framed photo on the wall behind Potter caught his eye. Draco leaned forward for a better look. "Is that-"
"Oh, very well," Malfoy sighed. "Circe forbid I sully your sanctimonious hole with my Slytherin semen."
By the time darkness fell, Ineville and Hagrid were perched on a rampart overlooking the heavily-guarded castle.  They force-fed the pill to Harry, and lo!  It worked.
Zabini gave it a cautious sniff.  "I smell nothing."
"Our first...but, we...sorry?"
Draco's brow furrowed. "Are you quite certain that it's my-"
"Then who is that behind us?" Hagrid asked.
In the meantime, Snaperdinck was also on the trail of his betrothed.  He and his men came across the area where the sword fight had taken place.  The Half-Blood Prince traced the footprints in the sand, determining which way the winner had gone.  He mounted his horse and led his soldiers in that direction.
"Not when it comes to Darjeeling," Draco countered. He held Harry's gaze while taking another sip of tea.
"What do you think of my invention?" asked Rodolphus.
Harry was happy to comply. His own body was clamoring at him to get on with it. He drew his fingers out slowly, then smeared the excess lubricant up and down the length of his erect shaft. Harry settled into position and guided himself to his target. Draco helped by tipping his hips up. Harry smirked at him.
"It's not that simple," Harry told him. "You may need surgery to fix this, depending on the severity."
"Naughty boys get more interesting toys," mused Draco. He raised his cup and met Harry's eyes over the rim.
Hermione giggled.
Draco scrambled backward, swiping the back of his hand over his mouth. He would need to Obliviate himself later to remove the memory of where his teeth had been. A hand wrapped around Draco's upper arm and hauled him to his feet.
"Harry, I swear to Merlin, this is going to be the shortest marriage on record if you don't-OH!"
Harry reached the door of the suite he'd been directed to and paused. He took two deep, calming breaths and reminded himself that he was an Auror, a professional, and not to let Malfoy get under his skin. Again. He knocked on the door and waited...and waited. Harry was about to knock once more when the door opened.
She yelped and flailed, shaking her head and stumbling backward as she tried to dislodge the furious cat.
Harry teetered between amusement and affront. He settled on affront. "Shame on you," he chided. "Spouses are meant to share."
"We'll never survive," Draco protested, even as he ran with Harry towards the sanctuary of the trees.
"Oh, um, in that case, let me do the honors," Harry babbled, snatching the wand from Draco's hand and performing the spell on himself. He grinned up at Draco like a nutter. "There, all ready now!"
“I—um, maybe?”
Draco sighed wearily, rubbing his temples. “He knows it was me doesn’t he.”
“Maybe.” A smirk curled at the brunet’s lips. “Is that secretly a turn on for you, Draco?”
“Then Malfoy will have to be extremely careful. The rejection of a mate is rare but it does happen. Should Malfoy not initiate the bond, the two of them will be fine. That is, if Malfoy can resist Harry long enough until they are far apart that the cravings fade. However.” Hermione paused then, gazing at Parkinson carefully. “If Malfoy acts on impulse, ingests Harry’s blood and Harry rejects him… then Malfoy will no longer be able to take from another’s vein. Ever.”
“What—what did Pomfrey do?” he gasped in reply. “I can see!”
“Er—you alright?”
“No, no,” Hermione said hurriedly, plastering a smile onto her porcelain face. “Harry and Voldemort’s history is only partly known to the Wizarding World after all. Speaking of which, it’s obvious you did not attend Hogwarts when it was open. Which wizarding school did you attend, Draco?”
The brunet glance down the corridor where the rest of the class was filing out of their Transfiguration classroom. The familiar bushy-haired head of his best friend was speaking with Malfoy, evidently discussing their own potential study session.
“I can’t stay,” Potter murmured softly, reaching to brush a lock of blond hair behind Draco’s ear.
Harry glanced at the time, realising with a shock that it was already close to midnight. The library would be closing in just a few minutes. Staring down at his essay with a sigh, Harry dropped his quill and rolled up the parchment. He was close to finishing, he’d be able to complete it tomorrow morning during his free period. He packed up his bag and stood, feeling exhaustion wash over him as he left the nearly deserted library, making his way back to Gryffindor tower.
—really, Harry? You don’t find Neville attractive
“Never it’s much too fun down here—you really must join me.”
“What’s not to want?” Malfoy smirked, eyes scanning up and down Harry’s figure. “I am
“He refused to answer to anything else,” Harry continued, joining Malfoy beside the tank. “
Harry chuckled, eyes bright with mischievous glee. He brought his knees closer to his chest, leaning against them as he peered up at the blond. Draco propped himself against the wall just across from his mate, folding his arms loosely.
Harry groaned into his firewhiskey. “Forced to.”
“Well obviously he’s not so much a cat right now.” Ron positively roared with laughter at the look on Draco’s face, the candle wiping away a shed of wax as if wiping away a tear. “I know, I know, it’s going to take some getting used to.”
“What can I say? You bring out the wicked side in me,” the brunet replied.
Draco gazed at the male, noting the faint hesitance in the usually honest green eyes. Instead of the sly comments he yearned to say, Draco simply allowed a small smile to grace his lips.
“Thank you, my dragon.”
He couldn’t help but stiffen, body going still. Potter was sitting in a tattered armchair close by, looking rather sheepish as he stared down at his bandaged arm, picking idly at loose threads through the gap in his sling.
“That’s not my name,” Potter puffed in reply.
Harry scowled at his reflection. A dark haired, green eyed, scrawny teenage boy with wire glasses scowled back.
“So stay the night,” Malfoy interrupted, flicking his hand in a careless manner. “Bring your school robes and sneak out in the morning.”
Smiling, Harry shook his head in amusement and crawled up beside Malfoy, planting his hands on either side of the Slytherin’s shoulders.
Draco, his hand on the bulge in Potter’s jeans, squeezed, and Potter’s eyes instantly rolled back, a moan escaping his mouth as he nodded.
“I thought you were serious about this, Potter.”
Draco chuckled as he kissed a reward on Harry’s lips. “Mmm, I really should thank Weasley then for arranging our date.”
“Please,” she murmured. “Just… take what you need. At least for my peace of mind.”
The blond inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself. “Harry, listen… you know I’m not good at this sort of stuff—”
“Who is it?” he asked.
of all people and look where it got me! How can you expect me to believe that what we had was
Pressing the palms of his hands against his eyes, Harry sucked in a breath, desperately wishing that the voices in his head would cease. What made the entire situation worse was the fact that neither Ron nor Hermione had seemed surprised. Ron’s initial denial of course was based on the mere detail that it was Malfoy of all people. But that hadn’t stopped the red-head from changing his attitude rather quickly after Hermione made the point about Harry’s ongoing infatuation.
” Wormtail snorted then, “he needs all the help he can get.”
Harry grinned awkwardly. “Stop exaggerating.”
“What?” Draco blinked, cheeks going red at Pansy’s smirk. He looked away in annoyance. “Shut up,” he moped.
Hermione smiled knowingly. “Yeah,” she said. “I know.”
“What do you want it to be?” Draco asked casually, keeping all self-doubt out of his tone.
The blond lifted his head, frowning at her. “
He teased his mate for another minute before Draco pulled back with a
wanted to meet you, Harry,” Eli said earnestly.
For the first time since beginning his schooling career, Draco Malfoy had the flu.
Nott’s face paled, the fight draining from him instantly. “What?” he asked, turning to face the blond. “You—but you’re different—I mean—”
Hermione snorted. “Figures, men never notice anything.”
“Pansy?”
his subconscious said slyly.
Draco could only stare at the carpet. He felt as if he was falling, his body submerged into a void of darkness as the repercussions of his actions finally hit him. How could he have been so
One thing had become evident from their study session.
“Not everyone is an exhibitionist like you, Malfoy.”
,” she seethed, snatching her wand to heal the bite on her wrist that was still bleeding sluggishly.
Draco remained silent.
The oily haired professor could not be seen, yet Draco could hear signs of life coming from another room. The door was ajar, revealing a strip of light and the tell-tale clicks of fingers against a keyboard to filter through. With a roll of his annoyed silver eyes, Draco marched to the door, pushing it open.
You’re probably wondering why on earth I made Neville the oven/stove instead on making him some form of gardening tool. Don’t worry, I had the same problem! But there is no scene where Neville as a gardening tool would have been used and I wanted his character around because I like having him close with the Golden Trio.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Draco, please be serious.”
“How noble of you, Potter.”
Draco found himself nodding. He knew with complete confidence that staying away from Potter was his best chance at retaining any form of normality. Even if he did decide to give in to his desires, there was no way he could predict whether or not Potter would be a willing recipient.
“Ooh, that’s a good one. Probably something deceiving, like a cat. I can be cuddly one minute and stark raving mad the next.” Harry giggled to himself. “What about you?”
if you would
“What would you like to drink, Eli?”
“Good morning,” Draco replied, entering the room with a small smile.
Pansy eyed him thoughtfully. “What if I were to get you a tutor?”
about it.
“I have an announcement,” Dumbledore began over the noise of the students.
him!”
“He’s not at the table,” Pansy pointed out. “You might be able to catch him before class.”
,” the voice scoffed, before the entire room seemed to go still. When the voice spoke once more, Draco was astounded to hear the perplexed tone that shadowed each word. “You would… take his place?”
The brunet shoved the concept out of his mind. He was tired from practice and the headache, which had been hanging around since his run-in with the blond earlier that same day, was flaring up again.
The brunet bit back a snarl. He ran his hands through his hair, willing for patience. “Will you come to dinner?” he managed.
, Draco,” Pansy replied dryly. “And despite what you think they actually make rather good company.”
“Shut up, Harry.”
Wand light it was then.
“You don’t sound very sure.”
“You can switch your laptop on now if you want,” Harry continued, flipping through the booklet.
“Potter, do you have a moment?”
.  I am not going to stand around and allow you to continue fucking with me.”
“Er, yeah of course,” he agreed, slightly bewildered.
“No.”
“Harry?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and leant close, his mouth a mere inch from Harry’s ear. “How far are you willing to go, Potter?” he hissed, nipping at Harry’s earlobe.
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Harry found himself asking.
compared to the luscious aroma of his blood. Even after Granger had taken Potter’s hand and healed the wound, the mouth-watering fragrance still hung in the air, embedding itself into every fibre of Draco’s being.
The headmaster smiled benignly. His kind eyes stared enquiringly at the blond. “We were all aware that this change was not going to settle entirely smoothly. I will be honest with you, Draco, I am surprised at the amount of control you appear to retain. I had expected your return to Hogwarts to be a trying experience for you. Evidently, it has been a welcome change to my assumptions that you have not acted out in accordance to my expectations. It is this reason that I do not intend to reprimand you for the accidental slip in your Potions class. You will also be pleased to hear that despite voicing his concerns for your wellbeing, your godfather continues to believe in your ability to control your vampiric impulses… and I am inclined to agree with him.”
Harry gazed at Malfoy thoughtfully. “I think that’s also why I’m attracted to you.”
Harry watched Malfoy storm away from his table and raised his eyebrows in curiosity. He wondered what it was that had annoyed the blond this morning; he rarely saw the snarky Slytherin so worked up unless they were arguing. He had to stifle a smile though when he’d seen Parkinson smack him on the back of the head. Harry had a feeling that she was the only one able to get away with that.
Draco frowned. “What are you talking about, Potter?”
Hermione pulled a face. “Truthfully, it’s hard to say. I want to say no because I like to believe that everyone has at least something good about them… and I
“Harry?” he murmured.
Pansy frowned as she crossed Draco’s bedroom, coming to sit beside him on the bed. Despite the room being cast in shadow, Draco’s skin seemed to glow, his eyes illuminated against the darkness as he turned to face her. Alarmed by the desperation on the blond’s face, Pansy broke the silence, suddenly frightened of her best friend’s answer.
Taking the chance, Harry blurted out his question.
“Not as bad as yours when she called out Malfoy and Hermione,” Harry teased.
“Responded in a way a vampire’s prey might?” Pansy shook her head in disgust. “Draco, have you forgotten how easy it is for vampires to coerce humans?” She dropped his wrist and folded her arms across her chest. “So, you practically raped The-Boy-Who-Lived, who doesn’t even seem to be
“I know,
“No let’s sit over near the window,” came Granger’s voice. “It’s a bit stuffy in here and I could use the fresh air.”
“It would seem,” the Dark Lord began with a growl, coming to a halt before Lucius, “that the boy has placed a hex over the castle, ensuring that anyone who leaves the grounds does so with no memory of ever being there.” He swore colourfully, settling a sizzling glare on the kneeling form of his follower. “This does not bode well for our plans, Lucius. It would seem we will need to wait until the curse nears its end.”
Shaking his head, Harry picked up his bag. “If it turns out you’re right when I’m ready to admit it, you can gloat as much as you want,” he promised. “Until then, I shall remain pleasantly happy in denial.”
“I guess we should figure out what this is exactly,” the brunet said then, waving a hand between them.
Harry thought wickedly, eyeing his monitor with a smile. Just the thought of what he and Malfoy had done, or even, what they might end up
Draco thought numbly. He tried desperately to stagger to his feet but another branch swung out of nowhere, knocking the blond to the side and back onto the ground. Draco’s head connected with the earth painfully and for a few seconds he lay dazedly in the cold, blinking up at the swaying branches. He could only watch with dread as the tree curved again, preparing to strike Draco with a final blow. The blond closed his eyes and waited for the impact with bitter acceptance.
“How do you mean?” Harry asked with a curiously frown.
“Joking shouldn’t be allowed!” Ron exclaimed, calming his stampeding heart. He pointed an accusing finger in Hermione’s face. “I hope you aren’t planning on becoming friends with the Ferret.”
“For the love of
“So, um… are you able to get that picture off the computer?” Pansy asked, biting her lip endearingly.
It had been a very long time since Harry had concerned himself with another person.
Harry backed up until his legs hit the mattress and he sat, art book still held tightly in his arms. Hermione went to go sit beside him, taking one of his hands and giving it a squeeze.
“Never,” Draco said through gritted teeth. “Are you
“Oh yeah…”

“Fetch Lucius, Wormtail,” Voldemort stated, gazing at the dark red liquid swirling gently in the wineglass.

enticing.
He could only stare in brewing irritation at the male before him. Potter continued to gaze at Draco as if he’d gone mad, his usually honest green eyes darkened with defiance. Draco could feel his patience slipping, and he allowed a derisive sneer to curl at his lips.

(See the end of the chapter for
Voldemort stared at the young Malfoy, his interest in Draco not going amiss by the blond. “Join me, Draco. If your talents exceed your reputation, then you shall make a fine addition to my side. You belong here with me; it is your responsibility as a Malfoy.”
.” Ron cleared his throat, throwing Potter a pointed look. “Harry has something he’d like to say. Don’t you, mate?”
“Now that Harry’s Head Boy he gets his own room,” Ron moped. “Lucky bastard…”
Voldemort turned his stare to the snivelling man. “I’ll have Draco for my very own, make no mistake about that,” he hissed.
Sleep took him instantly, a tissue held tightly in one of his hands.
His body suddenly halted, stilling in mid-air. Draco willed his eyes to open, finding himself face to face with the staircase.
“Hate me?” Harry said.
The bastard
be the day.”
“Er—alright then.” Harry turned back to the bartender with whom he shared a similar look and lifted two fingers.
“This is called an email,” Draco explained, rather amused at how enthralled Pansy appeared. “If I make you one we’ll be able to communicate and send each other files.”
“That doesn’t make what I did any better.” The brunet swallowed, feeling suddenly exhausted. “Fuck, Draco, you should hate me.”
“Stopped being an arse? Yes.”
The brunet smothered a groan as he dumped his belongings into his bag and got to his feet, hitching the strap onto his shoulder.
he could have a crush on Malfoy! Just because he’d noticed a few things about the Slytherin didn’t mean he wanted to kiss the bastard.
“Just through a muggle site we both use,” Draco replied dismissively. “Nothing important. The important part is that I am able to find things out about the Golden Boy that people don’t even realise.” The smirk returned to his lips. “Some very interesting things.”
“Seriously, Ronald, you’re not going to understand how to use your laptop if you get me to everything,” Hermione sighed exasperatedly.
Harry almost choked, staring up at the ex-Slytherin in open astonishment who simply smirked and turned, returning to the booth and allowing Harry ample time to ogle his backside.
Pansy rolled her eyes but didn’t bother replying as she grabbed the last ingredient. Draco had already stalked off to their table, slumped in his seat and begun to glare at his cauldron as if it were the cause of his misfortune. Pansy shot an obvious glance at Professor Snape, who was watching his godson curiously, silently telling the older man to do something. Snape however, knew just how stubborn Draco could be when it came to his school work and the older man would rather avoid the inevitable argument. Instead Severus minutely shook his head; indicating that it was useless to try just at the moment. Sighing impatiently but understanding her Professor’s predicament, Pansy seated herself down beside the ill blond and organised their ingredients.
“If I had known going outside was a turn off for you I would have done this years ago,” Harry commented, not making any effort to return to the castle.
Harry’s cock twitched.
“So, Granger, what’s the latest as far as the Golden Boy is concerned?” Pansy asked as the Gryffindor neared, taking a seat opposite them.
“Mine’s Potions of course,” the blond continued, gliding down the staircase elegantly. “Considering your abysmal attempts in Professor Snape’s class I can only stipulate that Potions is not your strong suit. Any fool would have automatically assumed your favourite was Defence Against the Dark Arts but you don’t strike me as—”
Shoving his hands into his pockets, Harry fell into step with the smirking Slytherin. “I’ll take that as a hint to never take you seriously every again.”
“Yes,” Madam Pomfrey replied sternly. “No ‘ifs’ or ‘buts’ about it.” She turned to the other Gryffindors. “You may stay for five minutes and then it’s off to class.” She turned on her heel and stalked back to her office, closing the door with a soft
.” He smirked at his best friend, shaking his head. “I don’t blame Draco for losing control, Ron,” he stated. “I told him it was alright knowing how desperate he was. It wasn’t the most ideal situation but it happened and now… now I’ve made peace with the fact that I am Draco’s blood-mate.”
Draco could feel his eyes widening as he took in the sight of the desolate castle. Large cracks scattered the stone walls, many of the widows shattered beyond repair. And that was just what Draco could see… who knew what awaited inside.
“Yes, Pans, I get it, you can type and send emails,” Draco said drily. A small smile tugged at his lips nonetheless, happy that his friend had learnt so quickly.
you’re grumpy when you don’t sleep well,” Pansy moped.
Harry offered a silent thanks to whichever god it was who’d interrupted them. As much as he loved Hermione, Tumblr was something he wanted to keep to himself. It was the little piece of him
He drew a breath. “Potter, the thing is—”
The red-head seemed to brighten at this idea. “Good plan,” he grinned. “I just hope it doesn’t come down to that.”
“When did
“It’s called being human, Malfoy,” Harry replied, raising his eyebrows. “Everyone is brought up differently. Do you want to know the real reason why I was afraid of coming out? My relatives.”
Potter nodded meekly.
Draco nodded his agreement as he grabbed his bag, swinging it onto his shoulder.
Draco explained a little more to Pansy so she was well versed when it came to purchasing. She seemed to catch on pretty fast, something Draco was secretly proud about. He was handing her a piece of parchment with the necessary information when her expression suddenly changed and he frowned inquisitively, asking her if anything was wrong.
With a frustrated frown, the brunet worried his lip as he stared up at the dark stone ceiling.
“That’s his problem,” Draco replied. “That
“Come now, come sit down before you faint,” Hermione chided gently, leading the way back to the couch.
Or revenge.
“I would have never picked you as a Healer.” Pansy cocked her head. “But I can see it I guess.”
Harry released an irritated sigh. “Look, I’ve got a bunch of assignments I need to finish, I really don’t have time—”
“I didn’t even notice!” she exclaimed, getting to her feet. “Can I see?”
“You’re leaving me?” he whimpered.
Which, of Hogwarts, the Dark Lord found nothing but utter darkness.
“I knew there was a reason why I enjoyed your company, Potter.”
“Harry?”
With a roll of her eyes Pansy removed herself from the room, leaving Draco in silence. He glared angrily at his screen, profanities of a vile nature running circles in his head.
“Ready?” he asked.
Draco found himself staring aimlessly at the accustomed decorum of the manor. Everything here felt stale; overused. He figured that was most likely the reason behind his choice to remain in France. A new home to call his own—not the same manor that had been handed down through each generation of Malfoys. There were too many rules here. Too many constant, unchanging qualities.
A playful leer appeared on the young man’s face. His hand began to move unabashedly up his thigh. Harry’s fingers were instantly around his wrist, tight and restrictive.
Harry chuckled along with him before saying, "Let's get naked." He stepped back and finished unbuttoning his shirt so he could shrug out of it.
Once Draco took his leave, Snaperdinck turned to Rodolphus.  "Go and see to our guest, will you?"
"Are you able to feel your fingers and toes again, love?" he asked.
"Thank Godric," Harry breathed. He released Draco's foot and stood up cautiously before stepping over the edge of the tub and onto the bathmat. He relieved Draco of his cup of cooled tea and offered his other hand to his husband.
"Draco, you're pregnant."
"I remember this farm boy," mused the masked man.  "Before he died, he spoke of a boy who was beautiful and faithful.  Surely, he could not have meant you."
Draco stared at him in shock. "What ever is the matter with you?!"
"Yes, but you've been getting up in the middle of the night to do that quite often."
Harry sat up. Even without his glasses on, he could see the grimace on Draco's face. "Do you reckon you should schedule an appointment at St Mungo's?"
"That...mm...that depends on how well you do it."
"Liar!" shouted a young woman, charging into the room from the back.  "He said 'for love', not luck," she insisted, poking Maxophilius in the chest.
Ineville watched the others go, then moved to the edge of the cliff.  "Hello, down there!" he called in cheerful greeting.
"Please do not distract me," muttered the man in black as he struggled to climb the rock face.
Draco responded until he had to pull back and catch his breath. "Why are we still dressed in our wedding attire?"
To Potter's credit, he didn't shrink away. Rather, he squared up, as if preparing for battle. Once again, Draco put a hand up to prevent Potter from doing or saying anything to escalate the situation.
Harry shrugged. "If I were you, that's what I would do."
"Cunt," Harry muttered. He performed his own cleaning charms and dragged his pants and trousers back into place. Harry cast a Scourgify on the sofa and paused to look around, making sure he'd left nothing behind. Nothing except his self-respect, that was. He tried and failed to muster some outrage. A good orgasm tended to have a calming effect on him.
"Until I kill you, yeah," the ginger replied.
The masked man came upon Zabini.  He was seated before a flat rock with a bound and blindfolded Draco at his side.  Zabini held a knife to the young prince's throat.  "Stop where you are, or I'll kill him," he said.
In moments, Harry was naked and stepping into the tub. He settled down with care, trying not to cause the water to slosh over the edge and onto the floor. "Mm, this is heaven. If only I had a cup of tea, it would be perfect."
Draco leaned his head back, closed his eyes, and swallowed heavily. "She advised me to retire."
As he tumbled backwards down the hill, the man called out, "As you wish!"
Draco's lips twisted in a sneer and his eyes flashed. "No, I'm not!"
said Potter. His fur bristled again with his mounting frustration.
"Yes," Draco breathed, arching up and spearing his fingers through Harry's unruly hair. Harry's technique had improved, and he brought Draco off in only a few minutes. Harry wiped his mouth with the back of one hand and stretched out next to Draco on their pallet. They lay on their backs, both of them relaxed and replete.
"Draco!" Harry cried. "You can't have alcohol!"
"It's meant to be romantic," said Draco. He drew his wand and Vanished the petals with a quick wave. "There, that's better."
"I will always come for you," Harry promised.  "You are my one true love."  With that vow, Harry left to seek his fortune on the sea.
Draco could only muster a scoffing noise. He flapped one hand to the side, meaning to smack Harry's chest. He made contact with his partner's face, instead.
Lucius' image flickered, but he mustered a sneer and said, "You wouldn't dare."
Harry was coming to regret his decision when the two boys tore through the house and jumped on the furniture. They would halt their shenanigans when Blaise reprimanded them, only to turn around and get into more mischief. Daphne was occupied with the baby, and Harry noted with a sinking heart that Draco seemed to have little interest in the youngest Zabini.
"Malfoy! Don't leave me alone with him!"
"If I tried to pull Finnigan, I am quite certain his boyfriend would murder me."
"I suspected it, yes," Harry admitted, "but I haven't spoken to Liddell about your case since you first came in."
"Hagrid, please!  He's getting away!"
Harry's pulse quickened again. "Is that a yes?"
Draco huffed out an angry breath and flounced down on the bed. "I'm not in the mood any longer."
Harry expected a smirk; instead, Malfoy smiled at him. "It sounds as if you've played this game before," he said.
"Go fuck yourself!"
Draco tossed a piece of bread at his partner.
Potter sagged with relief and sank onto the sofa in the lounge. "I can't thank you enough," he said, "but how about I make you dinner?"
Harry's temper flared, and it was a struggle to control the angry magic stirring in him. He clenched his fists and stormed over to the sofa. As Harry was reaching for his belt buckle, he pinned Malfoy with a glare. "This goes no farther than this room."
Harry laughed lightly. "Would you like me to read you a bedtime story?"
"Draco, may I enter?"
"An excellent suggestion," said Draco. He accepted the cup of tea and took a sip. "Ah, that hits the spot. I fear my inside was as frozen as my outside."
"Of course, if you want to establish your own identity among Muggles, go by Draco Salzaria."
"Ow, that hurt," Harry grumbled.
Harry stumbled a step sideways, laughing even harder. "I'll see you at dinner," he told Draco. Harry sauntered away, still chuckling to himself.
Harry's mouth fell open. "You're having me on."
thought Harry. Aloud, he said, "I expect you to use a prophylactic charm."
Rodolphus turned tail and ran.
Malfoy's gaze hardened. "Drop your trousers and bend over the sofa."
Harry nodded in understanding and relief. "Come on, let's have dinner, and you can go to bed early."
Harry sat up, his mouth slack with surprise. "But, I didn't..." he started to say, then shut his mouth. He'd been about to protest that he hadn't tweaked Draco's nipple any harder than he normally did, and which Draco normally enjoyed, but Harry could tell the effort would be futile. He settled for apologizing. "I'm sorry," he said in a gruff voice. "I didn't mean to hurt you."
"Are you ready, Potter?" asked Malfoy. He didn't wait for a response before he nudged Harry's rim with the tip of his cock and barged on in.
Potter replied.
When Harry woke up, he was strapped to a wooden plank, while being tended by a ginger.  "Am I to be held here until I die?" he asked.
"Of course," confirmed Lucius. "It's all Potter's fault that the Dark Lord failed. Potter should suffer for his crimes."
Indeed, the photo depicted a cat and a rabbit huddled together. Draco opened his mouth to comment on it, but he had no words. He settled for asking, "Why did you keep that?"
"I get to top the next time," Harry bargained.
"You'll be flying with Harry and Hedwig," Draco told her absently. "I'll be joining you later."
"Are you enjoying this, Potter?"
Draco was startled awake when the door banged open. Pleased to be rescued, his ears came up.
"Sure enough that I've already spoken to the head of my Ward," said Harry. He squeezed Draco's hand. "Are we going to do this?"
Harry raised his head and smiled at his beloved.  "Draco," he whispered.  "Will you marry me?"
Draco shuddered. "I need a stiff drink."
Draco drew back and smiled. "Do you reckon anyone has noticed our absence?"
"You could crawl."
"I did not start anything," snapped Malfoy, recalling Harry to their argument. "I simply approached the bar to order a round of pints for my mates, when you had to come up and start whinging about how I cheated to catch the Snitch."
Ineville was surprised, but he recovered and raced after the Count.
"Thanks for the advice," said Harry, mentally cringing at what could happen with Draco's magic.
A vaguely familiar room came into view, but Draco's attention was drawn to Potter, who was pacing back and forth. "Potter?"
Draco began pushing back, hoping to get more friction where he wanted it most inside of him. A growl of approval rumbled from Harry, sending a shiver of excitement through Draco. His cock twitched and fluid beaded at the tip.
"The first time I visited the mainland, I used the name of my father's dragon," said Harry. "He and mum were already known to the Muggles, especially mum for her textiles. When I introduced myself as Harry Potter, people associated me with my parents. Your father has visited Mugland many times. He's well known and respected there."
"Did you say, 'I do'?" asked Harry.
may be able to convince them," he said. "I doubt anyone else could. In fact, you may be able to request room service from the suits of armor."
"I'm not providing this information out of the goodness of my heart, Potter. Nothing is free."
Harry felt like he was being stalked, and he had to steel himself to avoid taking a step back. Malfoy tucked the folded note into the breast pocket of Harry's outer robe. He looked Harry up and down, eyes lingering on Harry's groin.
"Can't get the taste of blood out of your mouth?"
The prospect excited Draco. Perhaps he could barter some of his soap for a gift to give to Harry.
"Shut your gob," growled Harry. He managed to stand up straight, but he was reluctant to move for fear of slipping once more.
Malfoy slammed in hard a final time, and Harry felt him stiffen behind him and twitch inside of him. Malfoy groaned out loud, the sound triumphant and satisfied. At least the prophylactic charm spared Harry any further indignities. Malfoy sighed and slumped over Harry's back, and Harry ended up with his face mashed into the sofa cushions anyway. He sputtered and tried to lever himself upright.
Hagrid settled for draping Harry over a suit of armor before he lumbered down the corridor to assist Ineville.  He broke the door down with ease and grinned as Ineville pushed past him in pursuit of Count Rodolphus.  Hagrid made his way back up the corridor, only to find Harry missing.
"Spiders of Unusual Size?" Harry asked, eying one such specimen behind Draco.  "I don't believe they exist."
Draco stepped up to him and pushed Harry's hand aside. He wrapped his long, elegant fingers around Harry's erection and gave him a gentle tug in the direction of the bed. Harry went obediently enough, only muttering, "Don't break it," as a mild protest.
Harry laughed and clasped Draco's bum, giving him a naughty squeeze through his tailored trousers. "I quite find myself looking forward to shagging you as your husband. Does married sex feel different, do you reckon?"
Draco took heart in that, although he would rather not be discovered in such a lowly state by his fellow Aurors. Aside from that, it would be hours yet before anyone came looking for them. The rustic cottage they were in was cold. No fire burned in the hearth, and they had no wands or even hands to start a fire. Draco's sides heaved as he sighed.
Malfoy chuckled as he drew back and slid in again smoothly. His cool hands gripped Harry's waist, holding him steady as he fucked Harry with slow, measured strokes. Harry wished he would just bang away and get it over with. He widened his stance as much as he was able to with his trousers and pants around his knees, bracing himself against the force of Malfoy's thrusts. Malfoy's thighs bracketed Harry's hips, and the friction of his trousers against Harry's bare skin created additional stimulation. He wanted desperately to touch himself, jerk his prick until he blew his load, just for the relief of release. Harry resisted the temptation.
Harry wanted to protest, but when Draco's fingers expertly undid his tie and tossed it aside, he forgot what he meant to say. Draco took his time, working each button free and pausing to bestow kisses on each part of Harry's chest as it was revealed. When Harry began to pant, he felt his husband smile against his skin. He placed a finger under Draco's chin and tipped his head up.
Harry responded with a lazy grin. "A shag?"
"So you think it's a good thing to foster mainland children?" asked Draco.
Draco removed the scroll, unrolled it, and read:
"At your service," said the man, sweeping Draco a mocking bow.
"That's not true, Draco," Hermione said, chuckling a little. "You can take some of your healing draughts and soaps. I recommend you take as much of your lumos blossom soap as possible. Lumos doesn't grow in Mugland, and the scent is coveted by the wealthy women there. Your soaps will be highly sought after."
Maxophilius' eyes widened.  "You
"Bedtime stories are for children," said Draco. "I want a shag."
There was once a boy named Draco, who lived on a modest estate in Wiltshire.  His favorite activities were riding horses and tormenting Harry, the farm boy.
"That looks...unpleasant."
"What will you do, Father? Send me to my room?" Draco taunted. Had he known how good it felt to stand up to his father, he would have done it while Lucius was still alive.
The message was signed simply H Potter, and it listed how to contact Potter via Firecall.
Narcissa smiled at him. "And you and your dragon brought great changes to Hogsmeade," she said.
Draco sank down in the water with a grateful sigh. He slumped further until the bubbles were tickling his chin, then he leaned his head back and closed his eyes.
huffed Potter.
"You could take up coaching," Harry replied. "Or you could change careers entirely. I hear you're fair at brewing potions."
Harry's semi-interested cock twitched and lengthened into full-on interest. "I'd, erm, love to join you, but we're somewhat stuck here. No wands, remember?"
Malfoy sniffed. "I picked up my share of trash," he insisted, looping their arms together and spinning them in place.
"Don't forget the silencing charms!"
Draco peppered his face and throat with exuberant kisses, wriggling atop Harry.  "At a time like this, that's all you can think to say?" he murmured.
"Second best," Harry shot back. It was an old, familiar argument, and it helped to ease his tension.
Ineville snatched it from him and opened the gate.  Hagrid lifted Harry from the wheelbarrow and supported him as they staggered inside the castle.  They were met by four guards and Count Rodolphus.
Harry offered a placating smile. "Yes, you are."
Draco turned over, frowning in frustration. He reached for his erect cock, only to have Harry push his hand aside. Harry chuckled and moved to crouch over Draco. He bent his head and took Draco in his mouth.
"Sex is not a spectator sport, Harry."
In spite of the circumstances, Harry's cock was hard and leaking. The intense pressure inside of him and the sensation of being so thoroughly filled only contributed to his level of arousal.
"What in the name of Merlin's beard is going on in here?!"
Draco grabbed his wand back and eyed Harry with suspicion. "I don't think I'm in the mood any longer."
The man whipped his head around.  "Where?" he asked. "I don't see anything."
"Is that old battleaxe still alive?!"
Back in the chapel, Snaperdinck was aware of the commotion, and he urged the clergyman to hurry the ceremony along.  "Say husband and husband," growled Snaperdinck.
"Gently," chided Harry.
She turned away and reached up onto a shelf, emerging with an old camera in her hands. The witch pointed it at them, and the bulb flashed as she took a picture. "I ought to send this to the Daily Prophet. I reckon they'd pay a dear price for this." The photo emerged from the camera, and the witch set both items on the table.
Harry sucked in a sharp breath at the burning discomfort of being breached so rudely. He wasn't a novice bottom, but it had been some time since he'd last entertained a cock in this manner. Harry exhaled slowly, willing himself to relax. Malfoy pushed in deeper, and Harry clenched his teeth to prevent any sound from escaping. He refused to give Malfoy the satisfaction.
Ineville burst into the suite and took in the situation at a glance.  "Do you want me to kill him?" he asked, pointing his sword at Snaperdinck.
Draco chuckled at Harry's petulant expression. "Since you've been a good sport about the bath, the tea, and the foot rub, I reckon I can reward you with a shag," he said. "I believe I'm sufficiently warmed up now."
Lucius' form wavered and seemed to enlarge. "How dare you?" he spat, causing several items in the vicinity to rattle.
Ineville launched into a sob story.  "He is married, with four children, and his wife cannot manage-"
"Specs with round frames?" Draco prompted. "Wildly idealistic?"
Draco chuckled warmly. "It's not punishment if you enjoy it, I reckon."
Draco shivered, right on cue. "I feel frozen," he muttered. "It's bloody cold out there, but I needed to harvest the winter-blooming witch hazel at its peak." As he spoke, he removed his gloves and toed off his boots.
"No, you're right when you said the women in our life would take over and turn our wedding into a spectacle. I'd rather have something small and quiet. In fact, let's elope."
Harry stilled, groaning a little when Draco's rim clenched around him. "O-okay there, love?"
Harry grimaced. "I hadn't even thought of them. But, since we're working with an abbreviated time frame here, none of them will be able to get too far out of control."
