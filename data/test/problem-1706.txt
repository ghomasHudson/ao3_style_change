She cleared her throat, "It isn't much of a story but we, the Malfoys, are now members of the 'light' side." She stressed the word as if it were wrong and Harry supposed she was right. The light side could not be truly good, not if they were murdering people. They could not be good, especially, because they had Dumbledore.
Harry twisted the knob and leaned his head against the warm tiles. The bruises were more extensive than he thought, littering his back and legs like freckles. He rubbed his face before stepping out of the shower. He couldn't see into the mirror and assumed he had the water hotter than he thought.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous Draco. I doubt they're bullying him. Harry's just being dramatic as per usual. Although, in this case his dramatism makes sense."
Of course, that was the point. Harry discovered very quickly after Vernon's first beating that the voices had no power over his pain. It clouded his mind in ways that vanquished the voices just as many wizards wished they could Voldemort. However, Voldemort was his job. Harry had to take care of him even if he didn't want too. Even if the idea of killing him caused bile to run up his throat.
Harry Potter sat up in bed and looked at the black clock on his bedside table. That wasn't right, not his bedside table. His temporary bedside table upon which sat his temporary clock. He asked Poppy to get him a clock and, while she looked confused at first, after a quick explanation she brought him one. It appeared to be old, probably an antique knowing the Malfoys.
Lucius blinked and shared a glance with Narcissa before explaining, "We discussed it last night and agreed that the safest course is for you to spend the school year here. Severus can slip away from school occasionally to teach you potions and defense against the dark arts while Narcissa and I manage the rest."
So uhh my friend didn't read this yet, but I'm deciding to post it. I also made it twice my normal size because I felt bad that I'm a couple hours late. I got distracted. I mean is Starmyu a bl anime or not? I'm so confused because the show is almost pushing them together, but it's not. Anyway, I hope you like this chapter. I wasn't really sure what to do and the fluff only appears at the end and I didn't do the Lucius chapter. It just didn't seem necessary for this scene like I thought it would. All this was planned a couple hours ago and I'm doing at 3 am despite my better judgement so I might wake up and change it. However, I like the fluff at the end. Is that even fluff? I wanted them to cuddle, but... the whole potter thing happened and now its a joke...or not. I got an idea. want to reveal, but i cant. anyway, so long. peace. have a blast. see ya later. hasta la vista?
"I was wondering if you boys would make it," Narcissa spoke up from Lucius's left. She smiled at Harry and patted the spot beside her, encouraging him to sit down. The younger boy smiled and gave in to her request. He was happy that Narcissa wasn't mad at him despite the obvious glare he was getting from Severus and Draco.
"But it does matter. Don't you see?" Sirius looked manic as he spoke, eyes wide. "We summoned him with dark magic."
The silence hung around them like a dark cloud until they entered the dining room. Lucius, who sat at the head of the table, looked at them curiously before his gaze lingered on Draco, questioning.
"You don't know what you're talking about." Severus said, rubbing his face with a hand. "You're just a child and you haven't met the dark lord yet. Not like we have."
Lucius coughed as Harry stabbed a piece of pancake, "I'll be going into Diagon Alley with Severus. I'm afraid the two of you will have to entertain each other." He said nodding at Harry and Narcissa.
"As much as they can be," Draco replied, watching him. When Harry met his gaze though, he didn't bother to avert his eyes.
He can hear Draco moving, but he doesn't bother opening his eyes to track the other boy's movement. Harry couldn't even if he wanted to. So when Draco's fingers wrap around Harry's wrist squeezing lightly, Harry flinches.
After that, it wasn't a question of how to please the dark lord to Draco, but a question of if that was still his goal. His parents revealed to him a couple months later that they didn't support the dark lord anymore and Draco began to question himself. This person that he built...this bossy, refined, and narcissistic person he became to please the dark lord. Was this person who he really wanted to be?
"Whatever." Pansy protested still looking concerned as she grabbed her book from the table. She glanced at the wall clock, noticing that Draco hadn't been there ten minutes and he already had her tense. She turned back to her page to continue reading.
Harry turned to find Narcissa and smiled. "One of my friends had sent a letter and I thought it would be better not to leave her worrying for too long." Harry began and noticed Narcissa's frown deepen."I didn't mention any of you, if that's what you're worried about."
"They had to go pick up a couple more things, Draco. That's all. Your father forgot some potion ingredients Severus needed," Narcissa explained.
Opening the door, Harry glanced out into the hall looking for Draco. He wanted to ask the other teen if he could have some paper and a quill. Harry had not brought his own of course.
"I do not serve the Dark Lord," Malfoy confirms. "Have you ever heard of the taboo curse, Mr. Potter?"
"It doesn't matter Draco and stop putting your nose in my business." Harry growled throwing open his door and walking inside. He moved to close it but Draco grabbed on holding it open.
"He has a point," Narcissa frowned from her spot. She couldn't help glancing worriedly at the door every couple of moments. She had never dealt with someone like Harry before and she was beginning to realize why her father had hated gryffindors. They were far to independent for him.
"I think you give yourself too little credit." Narcissa said smiling. She folding her hands in front of her before standing. Her robes flowed around her, not willing to stay still with her movements."I think I'll retire until lunch, Harry."
He pulled up a board assuming Lucius would cover him and began to shift the wood below it trying to find something identifiable. He spotted a shoe rack hidden beneath a board and smiled remembering Petunia putting it in the cupboard when he was moved to a bedroom.
Draco grimaced and pulled back from his chair, "How would I know? I'm not the Harry Potter whisperer."
The gryffindor grimaced, "Just Hogwarts subjects." Harry looked at Severus for the first time in the conversation attempting a prideful face. "I want to touch up on the subjects that I scored badly on and get better at them before returning next week."
Grabbing a towel he wiped the surface cringing as he caught his reflection. "Better not look at that again," he whispered. Wrapping the towel around his wait he looked around the room before realizing how spur of the moment his shower was. He hadn't bothered to bring any clothes.
"Of course!" Poppy grinned and took the plate off the corner before disappearing. The 'pop' left Harry flinching this time and he rubbed his arms, trying to get rid of the goosebumps.
It is a difficult to raise one's feet or hands when one does not wish to. Harry Potter knows this very well as he descends the staircase ahead of Draco. The other boy only a mere couple steps away, but Harry couldn't bring himself to speak.
"Are those Amaryllises?" Harry asked. He couldn't help but admire how straight the stem was, "I can never get the flower to stand that straight. Some would say that's because I have no dignity." Harry chuckled, but the sound was fake.
Draco pulled his legs up to his chest staring at his mother. Her hands moved without thought as if the needles she held guided them. She smiled at him and set the cloth down. "What is it? Is Harry mad at you?"
"I wouldn't call it saving exactly. I just pulled you from the rubble," Lucius says. Harry looks up to see him in the doorway. Dark robes covering everything, but his face. It left him looking almost sickly at times. The black clothing makes him so pale he looks unnatural.
"When we, me and Harry...I mean...Harry and I, when we return to Hogwarts, will I have to pretend to be his enemy?"
AN~ Hi guys this is Deci, I would like to have a really awesome excuse for not writing for so long but I don't. I just didn't feel like it for a while, forgive me. o,o - my attempt at a puppy face xD
However, Harry's feet did stop as his eyes met black. Black hair to be more specific. Harry looked towards Abraxas's portrait, but the man had disappeared.
Harry nodded waiting until he heard the click of the door before he cheered. He wouldn't have to go back anymore. He knew he shouldn't be happy that they died but he couldn't stop the little bubble of excitement in his chest that fed his smile.
"I don't understand why I have to go over there," Draco snapped. "It's not like I'm friends with her. She's stupid for not following the dark lord and so are you guys." He sneered at his godfather before turning on heel to go to his room, but a hand grabbed his robe, pulling it tight.
This took forever! Well, that's a lie. I actually wrote it in an hour with my friend's help. However, coming up with the motivation took forever. My friend's super excited for the next chapter though so I might rush it. We'll see. I'm not making any more promises. I break them too easily. Have a wonderful day, guys! Hope you like my Draco.
"I don't suppose you could scoot over?" Draco decided to ask as he smiled at Harry. The other boy glared at him, but relinquished the left of the rock. "You like the outdoors?"
"Must've forgotten I put it away, I guess." Harry responded jumping from the rubble so Lucius couldn't force him to talk anymore. As his feet landed Harry couldn't help a gasp of pain and he grabbed onto a board sticking out as he felt his knees give in.
She smiled and put another sandwich on Harry's plate to which Draco snickered. "They should be back by dinner." The vase still sat on the table but it was pushed to the side since they were eating.
AN~ Sorry this chapter is so short. I actually wrote it this morning and expected to write more of it later but ideas for another story are coming really easy so i'm going to spend the rest of the night focusing on that. Hope you enjoy, Deci. <3
"Because I understand now." As Severus spoke Harry looked up from his hands, curious. "I misjudged you and mistreated you. For that, I apologize."
Harry Potter had no idea what he had dreamed about anymore. Maybe it was the shock or his own mind, but he couldn't remember for the life of him who the woman was or how she had died. He placed his hand against the wall surprised at how cool it was and even placing his cheek beside it as if it had the ability to leave him numb.
I meant to put Hermione and Draco in this chapter (the other versions), but I got distracted by angst.
"Mr. Potter, I'm afraid you have the wrong idea." Harry might have found the words comforting if they weren't coming from Malfoy.
"How about we go downstairs and out into the garden then. You can fill the vase, while I tell you a story." She slipped her wand back into her robe pocket and led the way out of the room. Harry looked around for Draco as they left but he was no where in sight. Draco's door was closed shut, though, so it was safe to assume he was inside.
"Are you alright?" Lucius asked quietly, observing Harry's reaction to his voice. He wasn't disappointed as Harry flinched before turning to look at him.
Draco glanced at him concerned but Harry just turned and walked to the bed. He should've realized he didn't have any extra clothes. He had only retrieved his suitcase last night, which contained his books and wand but no clothing, except his robes.
Harry was just pulling the over-sized red sweater over his head when an owl flew up to the window. Tilting his head to the side he walked over to it curiously, giggling as it  nibbled on his finger. He untied the string fixing the letter to the owl's claw and unfolded it. Rough, cursive handwriting spread across the paper, almost finding its way to the bottom.
"I thought I heard something." The man said, his blue eyes shining. "Never mind." He nodded at his partner in apology as they returned to their posts. Lucius's heels didn't make a sound as he walked back to the grass that they apparated in on. As Lucius turned around quickly preparing to apparate, Harry stole one last glance at the rubble and chaos that had called everyone out like moths to a flame.
He bit his lip and looked at Narcissa, who at the moment was looking at him in concern. "Harry are you alright? You're looking a little pale." Her voice was softer than when she had spoken to Draco.
"It was mostly my fault." Harry finally responded, sighing. "The moment I realized my wand was gone, I started worrying about my position at Hogwarts and took it out on you." He looked at the brown door in front of him in thought.
As the slytherins continued to pass pleasantries around him, Harry found himself staring at a scuff on the table. The only mark it appeared to have. A tiny wedge cut into it by what was most likely a fork. It was only one line, but Harry wondered why Narcissa hadn't fixed it yet, or, as horrifying as it was to imagine, replaced the entire table. From what he had seen, the family prided themselves on perfection.
"Don't even go there. The day you get to do anything to me is the day I die." Harry replied leading the way downstairs before he realized he didn't know where the dining room was. He stopped and looked at Draco expectantly.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, "I was actually planning on taking it the kitchen and washing it. Was I not supposed to?"
Snape doesn't flinch, but rolls up the sleeve of his arm revealing his dark mark as Malfoy does the same beside him. "We bear the mark, but we do not serve. I know Dumbledore told you, but I have defected. Lucius and I defected at the same time."
Harry subconsciously rubbed his arms as a tingling of regret crossed his mind. He had invited the death eaters in. He had broken the peace that once covered this street like a warm blanket. It was his fault that these cars and lights disrupted the daily lives of everyone and made them abnormal.
Harry nearly slapped him right then. The tension had left the room the moment Narcissa confirmed that they weren't called and Draco just had to call it back like it was a dog that needed to be fed.
As Lucius moved to set him back in bed he noticed Snape sitting on the grey couch that Draco had been on earlier. he nodded at him and placed Harry on the covers before turning to leave.
It wasn't that it didn't hurt. The bruises that had not disappeared yet were indeed part of the worst of his injuries. Harry Potter wasn't sure when the other, more minor ones, had healed. The days had blurred together at Malfoy manor.
What did not cross the older man's thoughts, however, was that the young boy might be curled up in a corner of the room, shivering. Severus wasn't sure what to do. Even if he did know what to do Draco could be here any minute. He had left Draco downstairs, but just before he knocked he heard footsteps. It was likely that the slytherin was right outside the door.
"Yes, Mrs. Narcissa." She nodded eagerly popping out and back in with a blue vase in her hands which she passed to Narcissa.
A police officer turned to look at the loud noise and tapping his partner's shoulder walked to the edge of the rubble looking around. "What's wrong?" His partner asked running a hand through his hair. Lucius jumped down and grabbed Harry's side, picking up both him and his suitcase.
Severus ran a hand through his hair and sighed then dropped down next to the couch. "Why would he use a glamour?"
When Severus entered Harry's room, he didn't know what he was expecting. Maybe the boy would be reading a book or had just woken up and was rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, or maybe the child had taken to playing a one man game, though Severus didn't know many.
Narcissa waited until Draco had stopped talking before she spoke, "You only visit Pansy at your father's insistence. I'm surprised you haven't convinced Harry to come along with you, yet."
The older man wrinkled his nose. "I don't have time to play with children. I'm going down to the potions room. Lucius would you care to join me?"
The older slytherins looked at Draco, surprised. "I'm just saying, isn't it useless if Harry becomes depressed because of it. Dragging him away from his friends. Taking away his free will." Draco wasn't sure why he was defending Harry.The boy had considered Hogwarts to be the most dangerous option from the beginning. "Wouldn't that just corner him into defeating Voldemort?" However, it seemed wrong.
"Oh, but I so would." Draco replied picking up the blanket he had stolen and after folding it, placed it back on the bed. "Breakfast is downstairs. Snape says you can walk so you're supposed to join us."
Harry reached out his hand and grabbed Dudley's old clothes, pulling them out of the suitcase and throwing them against the ground. His fingers raked through the fabric of the only shirt he still held before letting it join the others. Then, in a fit of rage, Harry dropped onto his knees and slammed his fists against the appalling items.
He caressed the holly wood for a minute, relishing in its return, before he grabbed his suitcase and made his way back to Lucius. He looked at Harry curiously before asking, "I thought you left your wand on a table?"
Draco seems to reach the same conclusion at Harry's silence because he drops the wrist. "Sev hates wasting potions." He says as if that explains everything.
"That doesn't matter! You shouldn't take someone's clothes off without their permission," Harry responded. He knew he wasn't going back to bed at this point and grabbed his glasses as he stood.
It's awkward between them as she raises her wand first towards her own clothes then towards his. As if remembering his earlier flinch she stops, "Can I?" He nods and she straightens his own clothing, taking out wrinkles he had never noticed before. "I can get rid of your puffy eyes too. Or at least glamour them. The spell was very helpful for me at Hogwarts, James, your father, wasn't very good at expressing his interest."
"That's alright dear." She said. "Have you finished eating?" She looked pointedly at his still fork and he nodded. They both stood and Poppy came back into the room clearing the plates.
For the first time in his life, Draco's blood ran cold as he felt a sharp pain on his cheek that radiated out into a stinging puddle. "You slapped me?!" he screeched clawing at the hand that still held his robes.
She smiled at him, "Good morning Harry. Did you sleep well?" Taken aback he only nodded, unsure where to sit. Draco decided that for him as he took the seat next to Snape and began to pile his plate with bacon and pancakes.
When Snape watches Harry flex his fingers and arm he can't help but wonder if he knows. Yet when Harry looks down his glamour is in place. A nifty potion he had learned that senses nearby magic. Even unconscious it will activate in the presence of anything not muggle.
Harry pulled the chair out cringing as it scraped against the tile and sat down turning to face everyone. He nodded at them, reaching out to grab a piece of bacon.
"Lucius Malfoy?" Harry asks as he remembers the man's face. Remembers the anger when Lucius sees Dobby free.
Draco looked at him stunned before speaking, "Are you serious right now, Harry? You have got to be kidding me."
Harry narrowed his eyes and then deflated. "Sorry, I didn't mean to make it seem that way. I'm just distracted is all. School should be starting soon and I'm worried since I haven't received a new letter from Hermione."
"No, I won't." Harry argued on reflex. "How could squinting hurt me anyway? I've been doing it for years with no side effects."
He bit his lip...They might count it. What had happened after I passed out? Did I perform magic? Harry drew a weary hand across his face before shaking it. I shouldn't think about this now. I have things to do.
Draco flinched and reached his hand out before deciding against it. Old habits really do die hard, he thought as he followed the other boy down the stairs.
"I'm not sure how much I can help. I've never made a bouquet." Harry replied honestly. He did take care of Petunia's garden but he had never picked any of the flowers, he wasn't allowed too.
"Potters at your house?" Pansy asked and then burst into laughter. Draco rolled his eyes as he took a bite.
He heard the floo activate and assumed that the oldest Malfoy and Snape were back, but he didn't want to see anyone in his current mood. He climbed the stairs and opened the door to his room. Falling onto to the bed, his eyes closed immediately and released him into a blissful sleep with no dreams.
"Thank you," Harry whispered. Draco understood him a bit more. He had been right, it hadn't been death eaters. Even if Draco wanted to react badly and curse the Dursleys that wasn't what Harry needed right now. Harry Potter seemed to need to feel normal and that's what Draco planned on doing.
"What do you think of Dumbledore?" Harry asked. He formed the silver flowers to be the outer ring and placed red roses in the center, but the vase looked devoid of color. He spotted a group of Chocolate Lace flowers and began to pile them in between the silver and red ones.
She ignores him. Has to because her brain is turning. She can't think about what Draco's jokes might mean for Harry. Didn't have time to consider the repercussions of emotions not yet proven. They had seen where he was and he was clearly unhappy. Even with his parents there and Sirius, Harry ran down the hall more than walked. Trying to escape.
"They did?!" Harry shouted and Draco looked up to his eyes shining. "So I'll get to see Hermione and Ron again. Neville will probably lose his frog on the train again and I'm sure that Luna will say something weird. Something about nargles most likely. Speaking of which, do you know what nargles are Draco?"
"That sounds reasonable. What makes you think he's lying?" Pansy restated looking exasperated. "I really thought you would have something juicy." She murmured standing up and heading back to the living room.
The gryffindor didn't glance at the portrait of Abraxas as the man had grown accustomed to him visiting and after the first three days decided Harry wasn't worth the trouble. Those three days had been a pain though, Harry had to admit that Abraxas was one of the more determined Malfoys that he had met.
Severus pulled Harry's sleeve up revealing a long, still healing scar. "Foolish boy. I gave him Dittany." He summoned a bottle from his shelf and uncapped it.
"I'm not sure what you want me to do," Lucius admitted. He was leaning against the fireplace while Severus sat on the couch. Books were strewn across the coffee table and the curtains pulled tight.
Draco bit his tongue before he could retort and sighed. "Is this really necessary? I was just sent here by my father. I don't even like you."
Harry didn't understand himself. Whenever people were nice, he would always break out in a sweat and get nervous. It had happened earlier this morning as well. When they were nice to him, he was unresponsive. It didn't make any sense.
"Boy! Just because your insolent, lazy parents created you doesn't mean I'll allow you to follow in their footsteps! You will get up and make me my dinner!" The last part was yelled out in one breath and Harry could just imagine how red his face became and realized he was correct as Vernon slammed the door open with such force that the wall it hit was tainted with a crack.
For all he knew, they were keeping him here until Voldemort decided to kill him. Harry looked back up at Narcissa as she spoke. "You know I don't like talking about that man, Draco." Her voice was stern, but she smiled, still the image of peace and happiness. "They said where they were going when they left. They're just visiting Diagon Alley."
Hermione and Ron, while Harry had not explicitly told them about the happenings of the Dursley residence, had known all the same. Hermione had left potions, illegally made, on his bedside which soothed his injuries, albeit at a slow pace. She had left no notes, or messages, but no one else would have taken the time to make the potions or have the knowledge and confidence.
Draco sighs, stepping even farther back. He moves toward the door not even bothering to look at Harry when he says. "I'll go get Sev. He can explain everything to you. You probably need more potions anyway after pulling at your hair like that."
Pansy found it easy to help Draco though. She forced him to apologize many more times after that until Draco was used to it. He didn't reply with a snarky comment anymore. Well, most of the time. Old habits die hard.
"Thank you." Harry said looking at her as she grabbed his plate. She startled and dropped it. The plate stopped a couple inches from the floor and Harry looked at to see Narcissa moving her wand.
When he was younger it was simple; everything was so simple. Grow up and make the dark lord proud, make his parents proud. But, three years ago things began to change. Severus and his father would meet in private behind closed doors that were covered in magic. Draco had tried using spying charms multiple times, but his father caught him and sent him to his room.
"You lied then," It's Harry shouting. Words sometimes mumbled together or garbled beyond recognition in the void between their worlds. "Any of it real?"
"It's not," Draco paused drawing in a breath. It isn't a lie, right? I do want to kill Harry Potter. I do! I'm sure of it. So why...why can't I just say it.
"He's right. We'll be back within the hour so don't kill each other. I would hate to waste good potions getting the blood out of Narcissa's carpet."
Narcissa raised her eyebrows, an exact replica of Draco-or maybe Draco was the replica. "I suppose that would worry me but no, Harry, I was simply curious."
"I might just do that. I don't know what we could talk about though, but I've always loved gardens." Harry agreed. He wasn't sure if he could count Narcissa as an ally, but he didn't want to make her mad just in case.
"I don't know what you want me to do. I exploded on him today, I won't be able to get any information from him. If he's gonna talk to anyone it would be you." Snape replied flipping through the report in anger as he was reminded of his own childhood. Just how many children will become adults before they're of age?
Or, maybe more than snatches: red hair. Lily Potter stands before her son, confused. Her head is tilted as she looks at him, eyes analyzing. Trying to figure him out the way Hermione would a book or Draco a potion.
The black walls closed on him like the walls of his cupboard and he was relieved to see one of the paintings from earlier. He stepped forward taking a closer look at the portrait, his hand rubbing his chin. The plump man sat still for a minute staring out of a window that sat outside his room.
"Draco Malfoy, you watch your language around me," Narcissa scolded. Draco shrank back and opened his mouth, flabbergasted that his mother was not siding with him. Harry was beginning to think that the Malfoys were never the problem. The problem, he considered, must have been the judgmental wizards who put them in a box labeled 'dark'.
Narcissa sighed again, "Consider things from his perspective a bit. You and Pansy, all of us, were his enemies only two and a half weeks ago. Your jokes are very similar to your insults, Draco. I doubt that Harry has forgotten them so easily."
"I don't know." Draco admitted looking at her white cabinets. "My father said that he heard about a raid on Potter's house, but he was busy so he arrived an hour later. He found Harry under the rubble and pulled him out.
Attempting to sit up Harry felt a hand resting on his chest stopping him, "I wouldn't suggest that, Mr.Potter." Snape's cold voice said in greeting.
Draco slid his hand across the line in the book. An old one that he had found in the back of the library.
He rolled his eyes as he thought about it. Here Harry was cursing his own father and Hermione was accepting it. None of it made sense. Hermione was diligent and straight-forward. She didn't enjoy snide comments.
Draco shivered beside Harry and nodded. "I don't want to die just yet," he smiled. "If we do kill each other I'll make sure to keep the blood on the balcony."
Harry hated himself, in the moment, for what he had done. For as much as the clothing before him had only brought him misery, Harry felt a strange connection to it. Harry had been forced upon the Dursleys and mangled by them in the ways that they saw fit. Despite all that they had done though Harry, in the same the fabric had, wanted to be loved by them.
Draco and Harry talk to some pepes that aren't each other. They each have their own issues to work out and they're finally realizing that.
They were human. Open to betrayal at any moment. Open to lying just as Dumbledore had. For the greater good, Harry. Always for the greater good, but never for him. It was never Harry they considered in those moments, but themselves. So wrapped up in what they wanted to achieve it didn't matter how much trust they crushed along the way.
"Oh." Harry whispered, "I'm guessing death eaters attacked then?" He picked at the sheet in thought wondering how the Malfoys fit in still refusing to believe that they had rescued him.
"I said that if you didn't get up you would become pant-less. Did I not?" Draco glared folding his arms across his chest.
Harry crawled to the side of the bed, which he still considered far too big for him, and set his legs on the ground. Harry had taken to going to the library lately, much to Draco's chagrin. The blond had tried to stop him and offered to go flying with him, but Harry knew what he needed though he wouldn't tell Draco. Harry needed to study.
"Yes." Snape looked at Harry for a second and then sighed before sitting back down, "Harry, the wards around your house collapsed. The Dursleys are dead." He patted Harry's arm in comfort not noticing the little smile on Harry's face.
The man gritted his teeth as he turned around to glare at Draco, who didn't even glance at him, but continued into the room, unfazed.
I'm sending this letter on the whim that you might still be alive. No one knows where you are, Harry, and we're all worried about you. Dumbledore says that the Dursley residence is destroyed and I was shocked myself to turn on the news and discover that the Dursleys were dead. Ron and the twins are worried sick...so am I. If you are alive and do receive this letter please respond immediately at your own convenience or not. Harry I really hope you are reading this somewhere... Please be safe.
"We are grow adults, Harry. We know what we can handle." Lucius continued, "besides it has already been decided."
AN~ Who's late? It isn't me...I'm never late. What are you talking about? *laughs nervously* Narcissa has reasons and I might reveal them next chapter...maybe...possibly...Okay I'll stop babbling. Hope you guys liked this ~.~
Draco Malfoy was another story entirely. The patches had been rough at first, specifically before their first agreement and their first fight since friendship-if it could be called that. However, after their meeting where Harry slipped about the Dursleys it was as if they were walking on egg shells. Harry wasn't sure if Draco was too scared to talk to him about his summers or if Draco was trying to be courteous, but the effect was lost on him.
She shrugged, "Mom needed new robes, but I think that's just an excuse. However, she looked at me like, 'You be good and don't invite any boys over. You have to save your chastity for marriage.'"
"Once or twice." Harry said grimacing as he felt the sun on his back again. He looked down at his full plate and scowled before picking up his fork.
His body hurt, Harry smiled. He couldn't hear them anymore, those nasty voices that penetrated his thoughts, they were gone.
"But, its red." Harry explained to him looking at his back. He repositioned his towel and turned to look at the clothes hanging up. Draco had a very extensive wardrobe.
Lily frowns, realization hitting her. "I didn't lie, Harry. Not once in my responses to your questions. Only about the veritaserum. I couldn't- Harry I couldn't give that to my own son."
"Fine, I didn't." Harry admitted still pawing uselessly at Snape's robes. "Just take me back to get it."
"Why do you have a red sweatshirt?" Harry whispered fingering the cloth. It was the same color as the gryffindor common room walls. He hugged it to his chest, trying to get warm in the chilly air.
She smiled at him before bringing a piece of her sandwich to her lips. She, too, had cut it up into pieces and Harry was beginning to wonder if he had missed a memo. "Make sure to eat at dinner then," she said.
Harry took a shaky breathe in an attempt to collect himself and with one last tear, let the fabric lay in a mistreated pile. Despite everything the Dursleys had done to him, despite it all. Harry had still yearned,though it was not for discovery or vengeance.
AN~ OH HELLS YES I WENT THERE! It's so late. Someone buy me coffee. Anyway, hope you enjoy and all that stuff. Hearts, hearts and, oh my god, my heartue.
Harry understood even if Snape didn't think he would. Forcing people to call him 'The Dark Lord' or 'he-who-must-not-be-named' dehumanized Voldemort. Any small resistances unable to even call the man by his name would be discouraged every time they discussed him. Any small resistances too misinformed to know better would be killed.
Severus hummed in response, barely paying Lucius any attention. He spread a small amount onto Harry's scar watching as it bubbled for a moment then slid off.
Harry snorted but didn't comment on the quip as Draco led him across the hall and into another room. This one was similar to his but with blue walls and green sheets. A wooden wardrobe sat next to the bed opposite the nightstand.
"That's my son." Lucius smiled wrapping his arm around Draco's shoulder and steering him out of the dining room.
"A single utterance of his name could bring death eaters into the area within minutes," Snape agreed, smiling sadly. "It helps quell any resistances. Minor resistances anyway."
"It's not your fault, Draco." Severus sighed and pulled him into a hug. "You had too much pressure on you to please the dark lord and I know that's it's going to be hard to discover who you really want to be now that that pressure is gone. However, me, your father, and your mother are always here to help you. Don't forget that."
He knew if he did he wouldn't be able to get an answer. Would stop asking rather than force her to speak. James needed to know though. When he and Sirius had left Harry had been fine. Almost happy even.
Harry flinched and pushed himself back into the wall, shivering. A face appeared in his mind for a moment before disappearing. That picture, harry thought, but the couple danced from his mind before he could react.
Harry shivered as the cold air caressed his skin. His mind traveled back to the cupboard and its scratchy old towel that he used as a blanket and he wondered if the Malfoys were a dream. A sweet dream like the one he had of his mother and father.
By the time Harry Potter is done crying, the cookies are burnt. He can smell it. Lily had waved her wand at some point, probably turning off the alarm so it wouldn't interrupt his sobs. Harry cringed at the thought.
However, Draco didn't think anyone's eyes could quite compare to Harry's though Severus might disagree with him later.
Lucius strode from the wall to take a seat next to Severus and squeezed the man's shoulder. The only kind of comfort Severus would ever allow after his father. Severus smiled at him in thanks.
"Your magic protected you from the rubble. You never cease to amaze me, Mr.Potter." Snape cleared his throat as he removed his hand and stood. "I'm going to go get Mr. Malfoy now."
Draco scowled as he entered the room, his eyes landing on the offending pot of flowers that attempted to destroy the room's color scheme. "What in the bloody hell is that monstrosity?"
Harry could remember Ron's face, clear as day, when he had grabbed Harry's arm in third year and felt the mark. He had curiously turned over Harry's arm, who had stilled momentarily unable to breathe. The boy twisted it and turned it, but the skin revealed nothing, it was completely unmarred. Ron's face had twisted until he looked constipated before he finally dropped Harry's arms and returned to his game of chess. Harry had flicked his wrist as if he was stretching it and let his eyes begin to take in the words of his book once again.
His mother chuckled and straightened her posture. "You spend as many hours in the day as you can with him, but suddenly you want to watch your mother knit. It is uncanny," Narcissa didn't sound angry with him. The fact, that Draco, her beloved son, wasn't as inclined to spend time with her as he was when he was younger didn't leave her angry or sad. She had resigned herself to him leaving her long before he had begun to do so. If anything, she sounded humored.
Three sizes too big and torn to shreds. Dudley had sometimes found it enjoyable to tear his clothing when it became too small, knowing that it would be given to Harry. Some which bore stains, Harry hated more, while others, which nestled deep into his suitcase appeared well taken care of, Harry loved. Ron had snuck in clothing some nights, or maybe it was Neville. Harry wasn't certain.
By all accounts Snape was supposed to be a double agent for the light, but Harry had grown familiar with lying while living with the Dursleys. He knew that one lie could grow quickly. He also knew that lying became easier the more you did it. Being a legilimens could only make it easier for the man.
"Oh." Draco said, unsure about how to explain what happened last night. "My father saved Harry Potter from death eaters and now he's staying at my house until he recovers."
"Don't have to be so defensive, Harry. I have some paper and quills in my room." Draco raised his eyebrow at Harry's tone before making his way back into his own room. Harry followed behind, diligently.
"They were...beating me up when one of them moved and it gave me an opening to run. I ran up the stairs to my bedroom and barricaded my door. I guess they just decided to burn the whole house down and me with it." Harry shrugged nonchalantly.
His hair is loose, ungelled, as it follows his movements when he looks up. "And so the golden lion awakens, gracing us with his presence." Draco's mouth hasn't changed at all.
"Don't talk to James that way," Sirius growled moving in front of the other man. But James stopped him. Wouldn't let the man touch Harry. For what? Who was he protecting?
"Mr. Malfoy was nearby when your wards fell. You're very lucky he found you Mr. Potter. Voldemort and his death eaters descended on Privet Drive just as he left."
"If it wasn't for Ron and Hermione I would have died before meeting the basilisk. They get far too little credit." Harry's lip curled as he spoke and he glared at the white floor below them.
Harry smiled at the idea of Abraxas shouting profanities at Snape before fully taking it what the other man had said. "I should let you get back to reading. I was just here to pick up a couple of books." Harry said as he made his way to the left corner of the room.
"You're reading about how to talk to victims of abuse?" Lucius asked, incredulously. "Severus, isn't your personal experience enough?"
Harry smiled as he drank the potion in one gulp passing the vial back, "Thank you, Professor Snape." He put his glasses on the table sinking deeper into the mattress as Snape's voice began to fade.
He groaned and rubbed his face, "Fine. Snape sent me to wake him up and I was just surprised is all." Pansy waved her hands still waiting for him to finish, "His eyes are really green."
"And?" Draco drawled pulling a pair of jeans from a box in the back, "These are from last year. I couldn't find anything earlier than that." He passed them to Harry and jumped out of the wardrobe.
Pushing himself out of bed Harry pulled the curtain aside. The pristine carpet was soft on his feet and sunlight streamed in through a window to his left, that he assumed was enchanted. He turned to his right as someone coughed and found Draco gracefully sitting in a grey couch that rested against the wall by the door.
The other man shrugged and pulled his coat tighter around his body. "Everyone reacts to it differently. A slytherin girl who's mother laid a hand on the girl all break would break down and cry the moment someone raised their voice but..."
"No." The mark had burned severely when Lucius arrived on Spinner's End. Voldemort's anger always transcended words.
Harry bit his lip as he considered his situation. A Gryffindor in a room full of Slytherins. A "boy-who-lived" in a room of current and future death eaters. People that should want him dead. He had been so caught up in the familiar banter with Snape and Malfoy that he had forgotten to think. To consider the war they were fighting.
It's more of a wayward connection than anything. The video flickering constantly as they watch and the audio in snatches. Snatches are all they need to understand what's happening.
"That's what we wanted to ask you Mr. Potter," Severus says. "Mr. Malfoy found you on Privet Drive under what remained of your aunt's house."
He supposed it was only a matter of time until he woke up but Harry wasn't prepared for the green walls that graced his vision. He expected more the antibiotic scent and white walls of Saint Mungo's.  The silver canopy of the bed above him should have given him an intimation as to where he was at but in his state of mind he wasn't thinking.
A knock penetrated his thoughts and Harry turned to the door trying to get rid of the excess fear that still had his limbs weak. He considered standing, but couldn't find a reason too. "Come in," harry decided to say instead. He didn't know who was at the door, but it shouldn't matter. The gryffindor had nothing to hide.
"Poppy." He called before waiting a few moments for the elf to appear. "Bring me the tray of food mother sent to Harry's room." A nod and a pop left the two boys alone again.
The smell had been a bit different from the time they made it in Slughorn's class, but he hadn't thought.
At least, in their surroundings, Harry specified as he thought of their attitudes. Even when, Poppy had brought out the food, Harry still found himself absorbed in the mark. His fork absentmindedly stabbed a piece of meat and bringing it to his mouth, but he didn't draw his eyes from it.
Draco scoffed as he pulled out a sheet of parchment and a quill, holding it out to Harry. "You didn't seem to trying very hard to be nice either."
While Draco would be sad not to see Harry during school, he couldn't help but agree. After conducting more research he had come to the same conclusion. The moment Harry returned to Hogwarts there was nothing the Malfoys could do to protect him. Plus, this way I won't have to be mean to him, Draco couldn't help but think.
The sheet slipped off farther as he scooted back into the headboard. "Are you going to take me to Voldemort?"
He snorted then laughed. "I'm in a room full of death eaters calling Voldemort their 'Dark Lord' and I'm the one who has misread the situation?"
Draco raised an eyebrow, smirking. "Come on Hermione. People hated me emotionally, but physically..." He smirks as he looks back at the cranny. "Good times."
Harry had lived most of his life in silence, so he left. It didn't seem right for him to enjoy the quiet anymore. Not after meeting the Malfoys, or this version of them. This version of the Malfoys were not bad people. Draco was snarky but he wasn't as big of an ass as he was in school. Narcissa seemed to like to talk to him. Lucius and Snape had actually helped him. Harry wasn't sure where he was supposed to stand anymore.
Narcissa paled and set her fork down before snapping her fingers. Poppy appeared with a 'pop' and bowed, her ears flopping against her head. "What do you need?"
Harry blinked. Then, the boy blinked again. He couldn't wrap his mind around the idea of Snape apologizing. Even if it had already happened, Harry hadn't felt that Snape was really apologizing then. Now, though, it felt real. Harry could somehow feel that the man was sorry.
"Harry?" Draco asked stepping into the room and looking at him nervously. He put a hand on the bedpost waiting for Harry to respond.
Draco still glared at it every other minute, but he had agreed to it after his mother had scolded him. "What are they doing anyway? The dark lord didn't call them, did he?" Narcissa cringed and Harry tensed as Voldemort was mentioned.
His friends had all told him that it wasn't his fault but they didn't hear the voices. The terrible voices in his head that whispered constantly about how stupid he was to believe the vision was real. He laughed pitifully as his rubbing became forceful, a now constant pressure on his bruise that only created more pain.
Even if Draco was tall for his age, Severus stood at the impressive height that his last growth spurt had given him, easily an inch or two taller than the other slytherin. Severus made a movement that was close to a shrug before turning and walking out of the room leaving Draco and Harry speechless.
Draco frowned as he listened. Harry didn't seem to even know he had spoken out loud. "So that's why you weren't in your room." Draco wasn't looking at Harry, but who could feel his flinch. The boy really hadn't noticed. "I was a little scared I would find you in the library. Didn't seem right, you being a gryffindor and all."
"Severus? Is he okay?" A voice asked from the hallway and a blond poked his head into the room. Draco didn't look an ounce uncertain and took a step inside when he saw that Harry was awake. "I thought you might sleep through dinner too. I asked Severus to wake you up." Draco explained as he continued into the room until he stood by his godfather.
"Oh yea," Harry whispered as they left his room. Draco snagged the light before closing the door letting Harry walk in front of him. "I forgot that they left." Harry looked a little worried for a second and Draco couldn't help but grab his wrist to keep him from going ahead.
Harry wants to yell at him. Who the hell was Draco to think he could touch Harry? Act like his friend by doing unnecessary things. Hermione and Ron never bothered to stop Harry in these moments. They already knew it was the only thing that could help Harry. Draco is not an acquaintance or even a friend, much less Hermione or Ron.
It wasn't that he wanted to show off once school began again or that he felt he needed to prove himself. It was what happened a week ago. Harry had seen Voldemort once again shamelessly, and effortlessly hurting someone. Harry had let his feet continue on the path, but he wasn't surprised when they stopped and he looked up to see the library doors.
"So," Draco pauses looking for words. "He's in a different world from our own...with his parents? Who are bullying him?"
"Where the bloody hell am I?" Harry asks, moving to sit up, groaning when his vision blurs. He grabs the sheets as much as he can, squeezing them. When this doesn't help, Harry reaches up to grab at his hair pulling it.
"We are a family of slytherins Mr.Potter." Lucius said in response as he took a seat next to Draco. Harry stared at his hands waiting for someone to speak. It was Snape who broke the silence.
Severus steps back from the door letting Lucius tap it open more with his foot as he moves to clear the nearby couch. The walls are lined with bookshelves leaving barely enough room for Lucius to move as he drops Harry down.
Narcissa laughed outright. She took the pot from him and walked into the dining room. "If you like it Harry, then it is a beautiful pot of flowers." She placed it on the table, twisting it a couple times before stepping away. "Are you satisfied?"
Harry Potter doesn't stir in Lucius' arms until he is standing outside Severus' house. The boy moves and whimpers a moment, but settles back down. Lucius pulls a strange comfort from Harry's own uneasiness here. He hates Spinner's End.
"Draco why don't you go find Harry and tell him we've changed our mind," Narcissa suggested. "I'll have Poppy send up some food to his bedroom so see if you can get him to eat as well."
Future AN~ Oh Hell to the Yes!!!!!!!!!!!! Updated, this chapter had the most updates, those being in the fight between Draco and Harry. I was so mad at myself for using such a cheap escape as unconscious charms. The fact that I didn't notice the plot whole at all, really hurt my pride too. Anyway, hopefully I'll update weekly now. I have exams this week and next so I'll do my best to update frequently but no promisesssssss.
Draco Malfoy knew when he was cornered. It wasn't difficult to tell especially since he had grown up being cornered by his parents and godfather into doing things. With one last glare at his parents and a toss of the normal, "I really dislike you two sometimes", Draco left the room.
"He must be. See this cranny?" Draco asked, pointing at the small visual. "It's right in front of Hufflepuff commons."
Yes. He does remember the stairs. A familiar ache in his bones, his right arm sluggish as he makes a fist.
A pseudo set of parents destiny pushed onto him. She dipped her fingers in red paint each time she touched him.
"I have enough common sense not to attack a student in front of a professor." Harry says as he crosses his arms. Then, when Draco barely reacts he mumbles, "ferret."
"Your eye color is green, dimwit." Draco replied, smirking, as he grabbed a piece of Harry's hair and let it slide between his fingers. "I can understand why you would be proud of it though." He smiled and let go of the strand leaving Harry speechless. They stood there, awkwardly, for a couple of minutes until Draco cleared his throat.
"That makes no sense. Death eaters don't kick people. When you said they beat you up last night, I thought you meant they cursed you."
"Yes you did. You're so concerned with keeping everyone out that you don't even bother to think about what you say." Draco sneered looking him in the eye, "You're so selfish Potter." Selfish.
Luckily he had a spare container of ink in his suitcase so he didn't have to go to Draco to ask for that. Setting the items up on the empty desk, he sank down into the chair. Running his hands through his hair he began to wonder why he couldn't keep the snark out of his voice when speaking to Draco before the owl hooted, reminding him to write the letter.
"It would do you good not to aggravate my patient, Draco." Snape turned finally spotting Harry against the bedpost, "What are you doing up?! You foolish boy." He grabbed Harry arm supporting him as he hobbled back to the silver sheets.
Draco didn't have a reason when he checked on Harry later in the day, but he did. The boy still hadn't moved, huddled up in the corner of the room and clutching the sheet like it might run away. Draco ran a hand through his hair and left. If Harry was still asleep there wasn't much of a reason for him to stay.
Harry stepped back at Draco's tone before he steadied himself and glared. "Of course not. My favorite color is green." He squeezed his arm, angry that he let his anger take over. Draco glanced at him curiously.
She frowned, concerned, "You just went there Tuesday. What do you have left to get?" Harry began to eat hoping they wouldn't start arguing. Vernon and Petunia frequently argued over him. This often led to Vernon getting physical and Vernon was never physical with Petunia.
Lucius leans on his cane as he considers him. Did Severus want the truth here? The most likely answer: no. He already knew. They both did. Severus wanted Lucius to lie to him. To make everything better.
Which is exactly why Draco should not have been surprised when he found Harry, two hours later, sitting on a rock outside. He wasn't in the gardens, but the foolish gryffindor had wondered past the gardens and into uncharted territory. At least, uncharted territory for Harry. To Draco, that rock and it's surroundings were very familiar.
"You don't have to ever clean your plates, Mr.Potter. The elves will take care of that," Draco's mother affirmed. Harry flinched as they returned to a last name basis before nodded and leaving the room.
Harry folded the letter back, following the creases. Slipping it into his pocket he petted the owl affectionately, "Hang here while I write a reply." The owl simply chirped in response before settling on the dresser.
Draco ran a hand through his hair and gave up on trying to make himself look busy. He set the clock down and turned back to Harry, leaning back against the nightstand. "Do you have a problem with that? Its just a color."
As if reading his thoughts, Harry visibly relaxed and looked at him curiously. It was as if Severus had never seen him shaking or cringing away. The boy was still huddled in the corner, but Severus couldn't sense any fear from him anymore. It was as if Severus had imagined everything. Maybe I did. I mean, who's to say I didn't?
"You think this is funny! This is a lesson, boy, I will not have you lounging about while I work all day. I expect a warm meal when i return!" With each sentence Vernon increased Harry's pain in a new way. As blood entered his mouth from both outside and inside Harry realized this might not be a good thing.
"B-But my wand. Sir, I need my wand." Harry stuttered finally looking at Snape's face. He was disappointed as his eyes met Snape's. They were angry and disagreeable. "How will i go back to Hogwarts without it sir?
He picked up a strand, pulling on it and scrunching it, hoping to bring it back to life. He shook his head and dropped it. He noticed the shower behind him and saw a towel on the rack. He smiled. He didn't think the Malfoys would be mad if he used some water.
Snape snorted and uncrossed his legs. "That old fool? He saw me and fled to Lucius's study. He's probably irritating the man as we speak. How did you know who he was?"
Potter, no... the gryffindor, had no reason to trust Draco enough to want him to know about the abuse so Severus couldn't ask him about what happened. At least, not without Draco coming in moments after.
What he had done to her face. "Who was it?" Harry asked bringing a hand up to his face only to find it covered in blood. Me?
The boy became so lost in his thoughts he didn't notice the silence that had enveloped the room or the occasional nudge against his foot until it turned into a kick. Harry glared at Draco as he rubbed his foot where he was sure it would be bruised by tomorrow. "What was that for?!"
He couldn't even recognize the ceiling from the floor as the pieces mixed together and he was thankful when a small crack sounded in his ear and the green walls of his temporary room greeted him.
"Just forget about it Mr. Potter." Snape says. "If you continue to push yourself you'll only create more problems for me in the long run."
He had gone too far. Sirius grabbed his arm and yanked Harry toward him. Yet, Harry had expected it. Prepared for it. Even as Sirius pulled Harry was twisting and then Sirius was gone. Not gone. Across the room. The man slammed into the wall and hit the ground hard.
He set a brisk pace giving Harry no time to admire the paintings that were hung every couple of feet. "It's just in here." Draco intoned pushing open a door to reveal a large black table and pristine silver walls. Lucius sat at the head of the table with Narcissa on his right and Snape on his left.
"We can talk about all sorts of things." Narcissa comforted him pulling his plate to her and putting three pancakes on top. She slid it back, "Have you ever gardened, Mr.Potter?'
Swinging his legs off the bed, Harry stood up on shaky legs and made his way over to his suitcase. A couple of bags sat next to the suitcase. Those were not his target. Harry's gaze wondered until he found them. The hand me downs.
Draco leaves before Harry can think to stop him so instead he reaches up for his hair again. The feeling of rebellion he gets when he pulls it quickly is odd. Draco wasn't an adult, not someone who could command him to do something. But, Harry finds himself relaxing his grip on his hair.
"Gone. The boy was under the rubble. I didn't have time to look around so I grabbed the boy and fled. I couldn't exactly go to Malfoy Manor with him and of course, you live with the godforsaken muggles, so I had to carry the boy."
"You can borrow some of my clothes." Draco offered and Harry looked up, surprised. "Just because you are selfish, doesn't mean I am." He held out his hand, waiting for Harry to accept it, just as he did when they were first years. Nerves crawled up his skin forming goosebumps until Harry grabbed his hand. "I should have something your size. Albeit three years old."
"Yea, he basically kicked me out of the house before I finished my breakfast. They've been weird ever since Potter got there." Draco whispered pulling out a bar stool and taking a seat.
P.S. The person I normally have read through these before I post them isn't responding at the moment, so I might make changes later. ( I will mention it in the author's note of my next chapter if I do)
"No 'buts'. Lucius and I will return to Privet Drive and examine the rubble. I'm sure even us mediocre wizards compared the great Harry Potter can trace the magic from the explosion. You will rest here with Draco to keep an eye on you."
Harry practically growled from his seat as he stood up glaring at them. "If I am not included in that discussion then what makes you guys any different from Dumbledore?" With those words, Harry stormed from the room.
Draco shrugged and turned back to the clothes, rummaging. "I don't know. Must've gotten it somewhere."
Harry glanced outside as he rubbed his bruised side. The sun was slowly melting into the earth as the day itself faded from existence. He couldn't help but wonder when his last day would be, with the Dursleys or maybe after he defeated Voldemort? He wasn't even sure he had the energy to defeat Voldemort, he could barely get out of bed since Sirius's death.
Harry still remembered when Dumbledore had first told him, he had held it in until the meeting was over and scurried to the nearest bathroom to empty his stomach. The sour taste had invaded his mouth just as he suspected it would for the rest of his life if he killed someone.
Life can be a surprising, can't it? I'm glad you are worried about me, though the circumstances are disagreeable to say the least. Your owl, or Ron's-frankly I cannot remember-I suppose, has quite the attitude. I don't think I will be coming to the Weasley's before Hogwarts, like I always do. I'm a little 'tied' up at the moment, not literally of course. This letter is all over the place, but I'm sure you'll sort it out Hermione. You always do.
"He wouldn't stop yelling at me the first couple of days I came here so I asked him what his name was. I think I may have shocked him because he couldn't speak for a good minute." Harry said as he chuckled at the memory.
He can still feel Draco's fingers on his wrist. The burn of it. Harry has hated physical contact ever since the first time Vernon slapped him. Still can't stand it despite the efforts of the Weasleys.
"Draco?" Severus asked, shocked. "Those boys can't see past their own egos. I doubt either of them will be friendly to each other when we return. Speaking of, did Narcissa ask you about our unexpected leaving?"
"So you think its embarrassing?" She asked watching him twist his hands, "Draco helps me with the garden." She smiled as she spotted a pot full of crimson flowers. " He planted these."
"Any reason you should be smiling after just hearing that your guardians hit the cauldron?" Draco inquired fingering a silver ring that rested on his right middle finger.
If he dies, who'll save the wizarding world? Who will defeat Voldemort? Dumbledore can't tell his right side from his left. It was all Harry, always Harry. As much as he enjoyed the silence in his head he knew he couldn't die here. He had things to do. Even as he started to black out Harry felt his magic pull into his gut, circling inside like a carousel.
"You don't have to stand there. Take a seat, Mr. Potter." A voice, that Harry recognized as Severus's said from behind the chair as a hand waved around it in greeting. "I won't bite."
"I'll be fine when I have my wand in my hands again." Harry answered before looking back at the remains of his old house. The boards lay haphazardly scattered on top of each other like a giant pile of jenga pieces that no one bothered to clean up.
"Who else would I be?" Snape asks as he moves closer. Harry can barely see him with his bare vision, but he tries. He squints until he can make out Snape's robe floating behind him. The damn thing must be spelled because every time it happens the robe seems to follow the same current of wind. "Draco please find Mr. Potter's glasses. I'm afraid he'll injure himself farther with how much he is squinting at me."
