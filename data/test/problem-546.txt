"Male, Potter. She bats for her own team. Honestly, you live together, how did you not notice? I mean, I knew you were thick but to not notice this…" he trailed off.
“I, Harry Potter, swear on my magic that these memories are honest, genuine, and have not been tampered with in any way.”
And young Ronald Weasley believed her this time. As a female Slytherin, Ron had never felt insecure while being friends with her. They were
Potter cleared his throat and put his wand back into its holster. He surprised Draco by holding out his free arm out towards him. “I’m tired of fighting, Malfoy,” he said, looking earnestly at him. “We’re both going back for the eighth year, might as well call a truce, yeah? I don’t want to fight anymore.”
Draco ran a finger over the raised words on the back of Harry’s hands. He didn't need to look; he knew them better than his own.
Draco nodded; anger dissipating as quickly as it had come. He had a trip to plan. "Tell Miffy to pack my bags, and to take a week off. I'll leave directly from the ministry; I have some work to finish off before leaving." He told Scorpius.
Harry’s hair was cut short for the first time since they had gotten together. When Ginny had checked on Draco before the wedding, the only information that she had given them was that it had her nearly forty-five minutes to style Harry’s hair.
his daughter bowed to each other and he turned towards the students. “This is your first duelling class since the holidays, right?” A couple of students voiced their agreement. “We can spare thirty minutes for your questions before I split you up to practice,”
Harry loosened his tie, sitting on his table. “I’ll be okay soon. It was a bit much, but I want to get this case done. I’ll be home later than you, though, so I expect a bubble bath waiting for me, preferably with you in it.”
“I’ve been vising Andromeda and Teddy,” Harry had confessed a few days ago during Potions. “the anniversary of the day she lost almost all of her family is coming up. I want to be there for her.”
Ara missed her best friends. She had Hermione, Blaise, and Ron with her while they were on the run, but she missed the rest of them. She missed Ginny and Daphne, who were quietly running the resistance at school. She missed Pansy and Milli and Tracey and Theo and Luna and Draco.
The sweet moment passed when the troll came blundering in and the girls screamed. It was still Ron Weasley who knocked it out, running into the bathroom at the right time, levitating the club onto its head.
She had brushed Astoria’s hair away from her forehead, whispering something that Draco couldn’t hear in her hear.
Draco barked out a laugh. He remembered finding out about Sirius Black’s innocence when the Dar- Voldemort scoffed and sneered and the thought of Cousin Sirius being his servant. He had died the same day his father was imprisoned.
He grabbed his wand and cast a Tempus as a pretext, turning his attention back to the stove. “Ron has an appointment for his wedding robes in half an hour. It would be dreadfully inconvenient if the best man was absent from it.”
There were a few murmurs amongst the crowd and the interrogator paused to look down at her sheet, the gold frames of her wire-rimmed glasses glinting in the light.
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes when he saw something move, out of the corner of his eyes. He sat up straight and looked at Harry’s arm.
He sighed. “You’re right,” he sounded defeated, far more than he should have for a cake baking competition. “There’s no way I can beat Ron. He has Molly’s training.”
"I love you all so much," Ara said, her voice slightly choked. "And I'm so proud of the people you've grown to become."
Ara's throat was hoarse from screaming in Malfoy Manor a few days ago, and she couldn't speak. But she leaned across the table and hugged Remus, nodding happily to convey her agreement.
Harry nodded conspiratorially, lifting a finger to his lips, and smiled affectionately at her as she walked away. Draco’s heart warmed at the sight.
“You attended a lot of the Defense courses at Ilvermorny, right? Were there any teachers there that resembled Harry Potter?”
They had gotten close after that, long afternoons of discussing ministry regulations with Hermione or playing chess with Ron.
The most dramatic of the night, however, had been Pansy. She had stood up and apologized to Potter for trying to give him up, and Draco vaguely remembered seeing a lot of crying, then hugging, and then more crying. He remembered talking to the group into the early hours of the morning, tearfully apologising for all he had done. Draco was a lightweight when it came to drinking, he spilled his secrets fairly easily.
No, this young Potter was crueler than the other had ever been. She was vicious and ruthless, a proud daughter of the Blacks rather than Dumbledore's pawn. So when she woke up in King's cross, it was Regulus Black who appeared.
"Your spell work was shoddy, Malfoy," she said, but he didn't move. Ara could feel Blaise at her shoulder, his steady presence calming her. "Now why the fuck are you avoiding us?"
“Go back to whatever hole you crawled of; you’re imagining things. Looks like the famous Black insanity didn’t miss you after all.”
Draco and Susan couldn’t hear most of what was going on, but they would go over the interrogation together, and then send their information to the ID.
When he first joined the Dark Lord, he had been honored that he had been chosen for his post. Honored, that out of all the death eater children, he was the first to get the mark.
They had laughed about it on the plane, and in the hotel room bed as Harry was curled on top of Draco’s chest, Draco tracing their matching sectumsemptra scars on his bare chest.
The Aurors had come onto the crime scene to find the girl dead, her body completely drained of blood with multiple bruises on her person. The man’s partner had been nowhere to be found.
Sirius laughed heartily, clutching his stomach. “You should be careful kid; you might catch it too.” He looked at him thoughtfully. “You're not that bad though,
Draco felt Harry's slightly chapped lips move against his arm as Harry spoke, and stopped moving his hands through his hair, choosing to move his hand down to his cheek instead.
This was the perfect chance, even though he didn’t have any alcohol in his system to make it easier.
She looked at the door of the compartment that the six Slytherin prefects had entered after the meeting, hesitating only for a second before casting a silencing charm and a charm to make the doors opaque at it.
He felt slightly shaky by the time he was done. Potter looked like he didn’t know what to say. He was silent for a few seconds before he finally decided what to say.
It had been long nights of stumbling into their house, frantically removing clothing. They had moved Draco’s stuff into Harry’s bigger bedroom and had spent many mornings lazily curled around each other as the sun rose. Draco was possibly the happiest he had been in his entire life.
"Professor," Ara said. "I do have one request." when he didn't say anything, she continued. "I want to learn Legilimancy."
But then there was Sirius, gently taking Teddy out of her arms so she could take a moment to herself.
"You're human now, Tom," she said, feeling Draco's wand responding to her magic as she twirled it in between her fingers. "Just like me." She looked him in his serpentine eyes.
She nodded, and he held a hand out to her. "We aren't exactly friends but we need to put out an image of cooperation. May I have this dance?"
Harry was an excellent cook and finally learned how to enjoy cooking when he and Draco had moved in together last December.
Potter nodded at her thoughtfully, “You're right,” he said, taking out his wand and waving it in the air.
Ron and Bill were dancing with their multiple nieces and nephews, Rose clinging onto Ron’s front, and Victoire, Fred, and Teddy clumsily trying to dance to the music.
t. He was unexpectedly good at dodging blows and had extremely high endurance, often running on absolutely nothing but grit to finish a fight.
It was so strange to be having a civil conversation with Potter after all these years. He smoothed his hair back self-consciously. “And how exactly do you plan on contacting them, Potter?” Draco asked. “You do realize that we left them halfway across the ministry, right?”
A five-minute discussion later, and Narcissa and Draco were being moved in too. Ara was delighted. Sirius was less delighted. "As long as you cast silencing charms on your room," he said, looking at them coyly.
They were still gaping at her when she dragged them up to the library to show them the queer wizarding section in the library.
Draco moved to hop off the counter to the fridge to get food dye but stopped when he felt Harry grab his upper arm.
Potter crossed his arms. “Even if you don’t qualify, Lily can still tutor you so you can stay with us. Tell your father that you’ll be safe here. But if you choose to continue your education elsewhere, I can help you find a master who will take you on.”
Ginny Weasley couldn't help but admire her. Not just because she was the girl-who-lived, but because of the way she acted. She was polite and kind, but didn't let people walk over her at the same time. She was smart and athletic and appreciated Ginny's family even though they were poor. She was different from the stories that portrayed her as a noble, self-sacrificing heroine.
When the Patronus came, Hermione apparated them all to an alley in London, Kingsley's voice echoing in their ears.
It was Cedric who answered. Brave, handsome Cedric, who she was now older than. "Quicker and easier than falling asleep," he promised.
“It’s wonderful that you’re doing this for her.” He agreed. “And I never said you shouldn’t. But don’t neglect yourself along the way, okay? After everything, you deserve happiness too.”
Even after knowing each other for so long, her cheeks still warmed when he did something sweet for her.
Draco’s father was still in Azkaban, and Harry was in no way willing to invite his Aunt and Uncle, but his cousin Dudley was there.
At the funeral a few days later, Ara spoke. She rested her forearms on the platform and looked over the massive crowd.
"Wizards have a house of Lords," she said out of nowhere when she and Dudley were walking home. She knew her aunt had tried to convince Dudley to stop hanging out with her, but he just brushed her off.
Victoire was curled up right next to Teddy, and Ara barely resisted cooing at how adorable the two best friends were next to each other.
Draco smiled. It had been six months since they had gotten together, but Draco still wasn’t used to being able to kiss Harry whenever he wanted.
It was fairly easy to imitate her cousin, and Blaise stood next to her, a haughty expression that Ara had seen on Draco's face many times before.
Teddy then turned towards Draco and reached out to him. He hesitantly took a step forward and raised a hand to meet his cousin’s. Teddy curled his hand around one of Draco’s fingers with a surprisingly strong grip. His hands were soft and warm and Draco slowly felt a smile taking over his face.
She could feel Draco's arms tight around her waist as they flew, Crabbe's screams echoing in her ears as they battled the heat of the fire. She longed desperately for better times, but she just gripped the broom tighter and concentrated on getting them out.
He spoke as nonchalantly as he could. “I’m sure there are more details to the sentence than what they mentioned, so I expect that they will give me the full version.” He stopped to think for a moment. “-and I expect that father’s trial will be all over the news, so I will find out the results either way.”
She and Blaise grew undeniably close that year. She was busier than she had ever been, having to balance her school life with running a system to protect her housemates.
Teddy scoffed. “Fine. Would you prefer to discuss wedding details then? I’m sure you, Uncle Bill and Aunt Fleur will have a marvelous time with that.”
“No, no,” Potter said. “I’m leaving once I finish my shower, and he told me that you can go through the pamphlets on his bed if you came early.”
She hugged Dudley tight in July. They had spent all the time they could together, him pushing her to her limits while training in what little time she had. "Stay safe," she said, feeling slightly choked up. There was a high chance of her death this year, and she wanted to make sure that he was safe in the place that the Order was taking them.
He was cut off by both of their wands beeping, in the synchronized tune that meant that they had an emergency of their hands.
Harry laughed, and they separated, Teddy slowly walking towards them with his fingers covering his eyes. “Grandma says I’m here for the week, so
Walking down to their wing in the manor and dropping their fake smiles and walking to different rooms as soon as the doors were closed.
Ara pursed her lips. "By 'they' you mean Sirius and I can't, right? I hope you realize that you've caused a lot of trouble for my department."
He remembered hours of leaning on each other and discussing anything and everything. When he woke up the next morning there was a lot of embarrassment and awkwardness among his year mates. But he slowly noticed more and more inter-house friendships and open-mindedness among them. They slowly stopped sneering at him every time they saw him. They slowly started including him in everyday conversation.
Draco had smiled into his coffee as Luna had tended to the abandoned food, the cousins sharing looks of exasperation as their partners ran around the house.
The first few times, when they had still been in the first, slightly awkward stages of friendship, Draco had hesitantly asked him, “Potter? How is it you always know what will come back up and what won’t? Most people just glare at me until I eat something.”
They didn't have the money in their vault to pay for expensive magical robes, and muggle clothing was surprisingly comfortable, as they had found.
After they fixed him up and visitors were allowed, Draco would walk in, usually drawling about how Harry should have a permanent room in the hospital because of how long he ended up there.
He had reappeared once for the trials and then left Magical Britain. He returned to Scotland in September to help with the reconstruction of Hogwarts.
An auror listed their two next of kin when they were sworn into the ministry, and their friends and family list was given to St. Mungo’s, and they were the only people allowed to visit them in the event that they ended up in the hospital.
“Even though I treated you horribly for all those years you still saved my life. Twice. And my mother’s life too. I don’t know how you have forgiven me so easily when I insulted your dead parents at every chance I got and broke your nose just because I could,” he saw Potter wince slightly at that. “I will never be able to repay what you have done for me. I just wanted to say that I am sorry. So,
It wouldn’t be that hard to find Potter, Draco thought as he checked into the magical hotel that Hermione had recommended. He knew Potter worked at Ilvermorny, so all he had to do was sneak into one of his classes or wait outside the school to follow him home.
Sirius rubbed his chest where Ara's elbow had smacked him. "Like that'll keep them away from each other."
“Don’t pretend you weren’t staring at my Godson, cousin.” Draco almost jumped, his DMLE training the only thing preventing him from shouting in surprise.
Every time he thought of his year mates and how they were slowly starting to warm up to him, he felt a warm fuzzy feeling in his chest. All young purebloods were taught not to feel emotions and conceal them, so he was pretty much doing everything that was a giant fuck you to them. Wearing muggle clothing, for one.
If it had been a few years ago, she wouldn't have hesitated. But now she was the head of the entire DMLE, and they couldn't afford to have a head change so quickly after the election.
He pulled a hoodie on top of the t-shirt and turned to Draco while tucking a pair of keys, a wallet, and a device that looked like a muggle smartphone into his pocket. He looked very adult-like, compared to a few months ago.
He had needed to take a moment to lean against someone and Draco was perfectly willing to give it to him.
He hadn’t changed much since he was eighteen. He had filled out a bit, and grown his hair a little longer, and left the scruff on his face grow out a little more often.
Luna shrugged. "Sometimes the ones we love are the hardest to ask for help. He may not want it, but he needs someone."
Harry turned his head around, and before Draco realized what he was doing, he pressed his lips to the tip of his dark mark, which was only a few inches away from his face.
Ara dreaded what was waiting for them at the castle. They entered the astronomy tower, and Ara had never felt fear spike through her as bad as when she cast a dillusion over herself under Dumbledore's orders.
Romantic partners weren’t allowed to be Auror partners, so Harry had quit the Aurors and applied to the Investigative division a few years ago when they had initially gotten together.
“Also, we kissed in front of the hotel and no one batted an eyelash. I’m not used to that happening in the muggle sector of a lot of places.”
The rest of them nodded. It would be futile to oppose her. They all knew she held the power in their house.
"You've never questioned my aunt before," he drawled in a perfect imitation of Draco's posh accent. "You wish to do so now because of a lowly rumour mill?"
What he didn’t expect, was to find Harry dozing at the table. Harry had been sleeping well for the past few days, so it was slightly unusual to find Harry asleep. At the table, at that.
His terrible luck stuck again when someone drunkenly pointed out that he had taken a shot and asked all those who had to tell everyone about it, in the spirit of camaraderie and being open and honest with each other.
She reached over and hugged her dad around the middle, silencing him. They stood there silently for a few seconds.
It showed him sneaking down to the Manor’s cellars with blankets and food. He passed them through the cellar doors and whispered to Luna, who was a prisoner there. “This is all I could get for today; I’ll bring more tomorrow.”
Ara smiled, squeezing his hand lightly. "Me neither. With Draco and Theo-" she broke off, a lump forming in her throat. Katie Bell had returned from St. Mungo's the past week, just in time for Christmas.
Draco spent most of his time in Blaise’s dorm, where Pansy would join them to study, play a game, or just talk. He would much rather do that than
"Aren't you tired of fighting?" Draco asked her one day in October after she came home sweaty and bruised from training. She flicked some foam from her bubble bath onto him.
“The list of the crimes Draco Malfoy is being tried for, the attempted murder of Ronald Weasley, Katie Bell, and Albus Dumbledore, being a member of the terrorist organization known as the ‘Death Eaters’ and letting them into the grounds of Hogwarts school of witchcraft and Wizardry on the 30th of June 1997. Mr. Malfoy, how do you plead?”
Draco made a face at him and scooted closer and looked at the tattoo for a few seconds. It was ink written just below the slight cut of his bicep, in dark red ink, the words
Draco’s raised his eyebrows, but he decided against saying anything. “How come you’re here with him?” he asked cautiously. He knew was treading on light ground; he didn’t want to accidentally upset Potter after he had just saved his life.
Harry just nodded, looking at Draco with the kind of intensity that made his chest ache. Draco reached forward and ran a hand through Harry's hair one last time, feeling the coarse strands between his fingers.
Harry was like a leopard, broad and strong, with a predatory gaze and unexpected grace when needed. His duelling style was distinctive. He never shouted the spells like had when they were younger, instead, he whispered them or dueled non-verbally, which made him an extremely tough opponent to beat.
that it hadn't even crossed Ron's mind that she would cheat to enter. And if he was rude about her being a part of it, Ginny would knock some sense into him.
He then had apologized profusely for every single thing he had ever said to them, heart hammering in his chest as they stared back stonily at him.
"And get points taken off of us before we even enter the castle?" she snarked, searching through her pockets for a quill. She dragged them behind a pillar and sent off a note to one of the professors with Hagrid, and one to Hermione to let the people on the train know what had happened.
She waited until the students left, and then addressed the remaining students. "I trust you all to uphold the dignity of our house and to protect the younger years. Dolores Umbridge is clearly a ministry spy. I warn you all, no matter what she says or does in her class, you clench your jaw and keep quiet about it. Report to us instead and we will keep an updated list of whatever she says as proof. Third years have Mandatory sexual education this year. The timetable for those classes will be up by morning. You are now eligible to tutor first years, so those interested can give your names to Astoria. Fourth years can tutor first and second, and interested students can give their names to Malfoy. Third and fourth year can leave."
Hermione exhaled. “Hello to you too Draco. I know, that’s why I didn’t come. I’ve attended his lectures too. Just please, talk to him. He’s the only one who knows how to destroy them. You know that Ron and I wiped each other’s memories of it when Harry moved to make sure that the information never got into the wrong hands.”
"It's worth a try." She tilted her head back and waved her fingers around the smoke that wafted into their area from where a couple of older guys were smoking. Both of them hated the smell. She pushed a little bit of magic at it, forming it into the shape of a dragon.
Harry and Draco swayed together during the dance, quietly reveling in each other’s warmth and presence.
She cut the floo call and Draco sat back on the floor, mind swimming with all the new information. He would look for the youngest Potter first thing tomorrow. She would undoubtedly be there earlier as an apprentice, and he had seen her face two days ago which should make it easier to identify her.
Instead, Sirius took her, and she swore an oath that she wasn't lying in front of all the members. The look of anger on Fudge's face made him look rather comical, and she voiced as much when Sirius took her back. "Like a tomato about to explode," he agreed.
Harry smiled sheepishly down at him; his lips slightly swollen. “I’m pretty sure you know what it is.”
Pansy's eyes were gleaming and her painted lips were tilted up in a dangerous looking smirk. Both of them had that photo framed and kept it in their respective living quarters, though they didn’t talk about it, or their feelings in general.
Harry blanched. It was one thing to get a call saying that his godchild and niece were cozying it up in a broom cupboard. But his daughter? Merlin, that would be horrible.
"I don't know what I would do without you," Blaise admitted one night while writing a rotation schedule for patrols for that month.
when I told her. She definitely had to do some press conferences to talk about it, since she was once working on the reforms before she moved onto politics. But she was still proud."
It had decreased in the past few months. He no longer glared at him every time he saw him, but he didn’t make an effort to speak to him like the rest of his year did. Out of all the things Draco did to his year mates, Longbottom was probably the one who suffered the most.
"It must be a Slytherin thing," Ara shrugged. "Will you partner with me in transfiguration later today, Hermione?"
“To the kitchens,” Harry declared, bending down to grab his hoodie from where half of it was stuffed into one of his back pockets and pulling it on, leaving his hair looking like a literal rat's nest.
He cur her off, unbuttoning the cuff of his sleeves. "You want to know what's wrong?" He snarled. She felt dread pool in her stomach. He rolled his sleeves up, a motion she had seen him make so many times. On the previously blank skin of his arm, was the Dark Mark. Alive and throbbing, a blemish on his smooth skin.
There one really nice candid of Harry, Ron, and Hermione for Hermione’s twentieth birthday, where all of them were happy, grinning faces with arms wrapped around each other.
“I’m non-binary,” they had whispered. All Harry could do was hold them tight and even tighter when they came out to Draco the next day.
At least his husband agreed with him. Their sixteenth anniversary and his thirty-ninth birthday had passed the previous month, marking an age that none of the marauders had passed.
He felt Draco trace the shape of the tattoo on his back, the dragon curled around Lily, Narcissus, and Aster flowers.  The little Teddy bear that was under them.
He walked back to where Draco was sitting and hesitated for a second before sitting down on the other side of Blaise’s bed, a good five feet of distance between them.
It was silver, with a small, square-cut diamond in the middle, two small emeralds on either side of it. It was simple enough that he could wear it on raids or while working without It being damaged. It had a small engraving on the inside,
"You aren’t wrong," Ara admitted as they circled each other. "He seems to think that I'm straying to the dark side. He's desperate to have me on his."
Then it was Leo, who was only a year above her in school. She and Hugo would be the last ones to go until Lissa followed her in a few years.
It was hilarious. They would see each other, and Harry would clear his throat, standing up straighter.
He sighed. “Another one, Harry? I have nothing against you getting them but you’re going to have to endure Hermione’s lecture on how you won’t have any skin left by the time you’re thirty.”
And a week later, she sat on his shoulders as they walked the streets of New York, both of their cheeks painted in rainbow colours.
" he imitated, shoving her shoulder with his on the way to Astronomy class. She shot him a grin over her shoulder and he scoffed but returned it, silver eyes glittering under the firelight.
“Cape Verde,” he recited. “Island country off the coast of Africa. Official languages are Portuguese and Creole, one of which I speak,” Draco shot a superior look at Harry.
Leo slipped out of his mother’s reach, shooting a sheepish glance at Aster’s dad who had noticed Aunt Ginny screaming. He walked towards her and Lissa with a grin.
Before dinner, she quietly met Malfoy and Adrian at the entrance of Professor Snape's quarters. "Malfoy, Adrian." she greeted. She looked at Malfoy as Adrian went in first, presumably to talk about the quidditch team strategies and formation.
The entire Weasley family had a love for pranks. It included the friends too; Draco couldn’t remember how many times he and Harry had come home with some weird hair color or feathers in their clothes.
Draco looked at Harry’s hand, the one that was holding his wand. He didn’t know what to say, and even though the silences between them were never awkward, he felt the need to say something.
The song had become a tradition for Harry every Valentine’s day. Every year for the past five years, Harry would find Ginny wherever she was, and sing the song at the top of his voice.
When he went downstairs in the middle of the night craving fresh air to clear his head of the nightmares, he could see them in the common room, often curled up around each other as they spoke in hushed tones, looking up only to share an understanding look with him before they tilted their heads back together.
"You heard her," Daphne expressed. "You need to let him know how you feel. And get him wrapped around your finger like the queen that you are. So what we need, is a plan."
Draco leaned back on to his arms and looked over all the drunk students, who were now silent and paying attention to him. He sighed. Looks like he would be doing the explaining, as the least drunk member of those who had been in his dorm that were present. He would rather he explain it as simply as possible, rather than have his dorm mates accidentally spill even worse secrets about him.
Terribly, completely wrong. He had forgotten to take Ilvermorny’s size into consideration in his search. It was the largest Magical school in the States and had thousands of students per year group.
Harry shivered. “Tell me what you know about this place, you studied pretty much every country in the world as a child.”
He came closer and realized it was Harry, his hair flying messily in the wind. Harry whipped around when he heard footsteps approaching, stiffening when he saw Draco.
She nodded at him firmly before walking over to her bed and picking up a book and putting it on the bedside table.
Teddy's lips tipped upward in a half-smile. "Victoire and I found a loophole. They can't arrest me."
Draco slipped into the auditorium where Potter would be instructing, finally having found the room after a few hours of sneaking around. Ilvermorny had a pretty solid security system, and the only thing allowing Draco in was his ID card from the British Ministry.
The memories ended and Potter stood there triumphantly while Draco sat there, dumbfounded at what had taken place.
Slytherin was the house of survival and adaptation like its element, water. He had learned quickly enough when he saw the recruits being tortured for defying orders. Keep your head down. Only answer with the affirmative, and address him with the utmost respect. Sink to your knees and kiss the hem of his robes. And never tell the Dark Lord that he was wrong.
He looked around until he settled on the portrait of Sirius Black that was hung up near the entryway.
"I've seen the way he looks at you, darling. So has everyone else. Ginny would murder me if she knew I was telling you this, but she had a similar conversation with him. You never know when your life or the life of someone you love is going to end. Don't waste this opportunity, you deserve happiness too."
"Extra naan for me please." Ara and Dudley had taken to spending a lot of time near the fence at the far edge of the park near their house. Ara had done some fiddling and gotten the wards to cover that area too so that no one could see them, and it was hidden from general view.
He walked into her room, taking in the neutral decorations and the framed photo of her family on her bedstand.
" with his pale skin and hair, and silver eyes that almost looked like they were glowing in the light of the nightclub.
“Andromeda and Teddy will be here any moment, they both wanted to see you and Malfoy” he finished, awkwardly rubbing his neck.
Aster and Lissa are Drarry's daughters, Percy's daughter Lucy is trans here, so now it's his son Luke.
Ara wiggled her fingers in front of her. "The snakes on the walls and portraits tell me everything I need to know."
' on Harry's motorbike, with him grinning devilishly back at her, one of her arms wrapped around his waist and the other hand pumped into the air in excitement.
Potter spoke again, “I suggest house arrest without access to a wand without a wand until November, and then letting him complete his schooling in Hogwarts after that. I remind you all that he was a minor for most of his crimes, and that he made up for it after that. He saved my life, and that of many others,” he continued, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “He deserves a chance to live his life.”
Everyone in the manor could hear her screams. Her throat was raw from yelling itself hoarse, Bellatrix's cackles filling her ears as she cast the curse on her, giving death eaters chances to take turns on her and Hermione. She knew Draco would have to cast it next. He
“This could be Ginny’s doing too. Ever since they got back from the honeymoon, she’s been pranking everyone non-stop.” Harry grimaced. “It could also be because of what happened yesterday.”
Draco had always expected to see Potter's kids at King's Cross along with Ron and Hermione's, but he hadn't been seen in Britain for a few years now, though Ron and Hermione mentioned him often. Draco hadn’t seen him since he came to the manor to return his wand when he was under house arrest years ago.
Dudley was smarter than people gave him credit for. "Yepp. Apparently, there's a godfather's ritual, which makes me his heir by blood and magic if he never has any kids of his own."
The crowd quietened, and Ara felt Malfoy silently stand beside her. She waited for a second until the rest of the prefects were gathered around her.
They had ditched their turquoise hair in favor of a more Harry-Like appearance, one that they often adopted. Harry had spent a lot of time around his godchild as Andy got increasingly older.
He pulled a file out of his messenger bag, giving the completed paperwork to the young man at the front desk to store. It had been an exhausting case, and he already had another one, but the week-long vacation that he had gotten after it had been worth it.
From eighteen to twenty, his life had slowly gone back to grey, lightening until it was nearly white. He had lost people and still had people sneer at him and occasionally throw things at him in the streets. He knew it was nothing he didn’t deserve, however.
Ah, so that’s what he was talking about. Harry continued to talk, lying back down and nuzzling his head into the crook of Draco’s neck.
She was related to the rest of the Weasleys distantly, through Grandpa Arthur’s mother Cedrella, Teddy, her father, and even her dad’s ancestors by extension.
This was Potter. Potter, who was somehow always there when someone needed the day to be saved. Potter, who had saved
“After you took the mark you knew what you were doing was wrong, why did you not leave his service?”
Draco thought about his life, as compared to a few years ago. His childhood had been golden and white, angelic. Running through fields of wildflowers, splashing in pools of water in Paris, touring the cobbled streets of Rome.
A few people hollered as Zacharias Smith took a shot. He grinned widely before addressing the group, “I don’t know about you lot, but Professor Taylor sure Is something to look at, eh?” he put his glass down on the floor. “She has legs for days.” At this point, his speech was starting to sound a little slurred.
He had been grateful that his aunt and Harry had each other to lean on to. He knew that they saw his mother occasionally too, usually for tea in the evening. He remembered a letter his mother had written to him earlier that year.
Three days later in the bathroom, Millicent and Pansy gave her a list of spells to help curly hair to sit neatly. "If the rumours were true and you were raised by muggles," the pug-faced girl said, "Then these should be helpful."
Scorpius scoffed. Draco snapped his head around to look at his son, anger welling up at him. He took a step forward and pushed his left sleeve upwards until it hit his elbow.
Yesterday, Ginny and Luna had floo’d over in the morning for Harry’s cooking, and she had chased him all around the house as he screamed the lyrics.
He gently lifted the side of his shirt off, and Draco sighed, frowning slightly at Harry’s tendency to not notice his injuries because of how often he got injured, before waving his wand and healing the injury.
Fred and Louis were in Gryffindor, and Aster knew Hugo wanted to follow them into the house of the brave.
Ara and Ginny had gone with him to choose the ring the previous month, and Ara sent a wink over to two of her best friends as she spoke to Percy about the new vampire legislation.
Draco held Harry's limp hand as the conducted the final tests on him. If a raid had gone wrong and Harry ended up in St. Mungo’s, Draco usually just finished up their paperwork and went to the hospital gift shop to buy some ridiculous looking flowers for him.
Draco had never spoken to his aunt or her daughter, and last he had heard of her was that her daughter had given birth to a son. He didn’t even know who the father was.
Next of kin worked differently in the magical world, since so many people had been lost in the two dark lords within fifty years of each other situation.
Once a week, usually on Friday or Saturday, the entire group got together and drank or played party games. They had been denied a normal teenage experience because of the war, and better late than never, right?
“Fucking piece of work,” she spat, uncharacteristically angry. “He starved her and beat her. His partner is a woman we went to school with, a year under us. He doesn’t know where she is, but he gave us everything he knew about her. Get in contact with Minerva and some of our younger years, see what they have on her. They got married straight out of Hogwarts, so there has to be more information.”
Draco wordlessly held an arm out to him, and Harry leaned against him gratefully. He saw him pull the hair tie out of his hair, and run his hands through it for a few seconds before putting it back up through the corner of his eye as he watched Susan wrap up the interview.
cast a cutting curse at Augustus Rookwood's neck, watching him fall to the floor, gurgling as he choked on his own blood in the middle of the explosion that he had caused.
Ara stood up straighter, only tilting her head slightly to look him in the eye. "I'm the head of our year," Ara said. "If there's anything wrong, you know you should tell me-"
"Woah," Ara stared at the bottle of Felix Felices in Ron's hand. She glanced down at the worn textbook in front of him, and at the spidery handwriting that she recognized immediately from her lessons with Snape.
It hadn’t been perfect, there were some lovely bug bites that both of them had acquired, and one of them had knocked over a glass of wine in the dark. But Draco wouldn’t have had it any other way.
She pushed the door open slowly, breathing out in relief when it didn't make any noise. Draco was bent over the sink, gripping it so tightly that Ara could see the skin pulled white over his knuckles. He was crying, she realized. His shoulders were shaking and he was making soft sobbing noises that broke her heart.
He rubbed his wrists, still slightly in a daze, as an auror told him that they would collect him and send him to a safe house in an hour after the final details had been finished up.
Harry remembered. He remembered the flashing lights and a slight smell of alcohol and sweat in the air as they moved their bodies to the loud music. He remembered the taste of vodka on Draco’s lips. He remembered hands reaching out for each other and warm breath ghosting across his jaw with their hips slotting together.
His face quickly lost all semblance of teasing when he saw Harry turn away and raise a hand to scrub at his eyes quickly before turning back.
Ara had pointedly been ignoring the smell of Amortentia coming from the other side of the room. Every time she inhaled the scent of old books, daisies, and a sharp smelling perfume that Pansy had gifted all the Slytherin girls the previous year for christmas. Their entire dorm room always smelled strongly of the perfume.
, guarded. They protected high profile people in events, were stationed around sights of crime, guarded Azkaban, and protected people who were related to cases in the DMLE.
Both of them had died in the war, he realized. He would never get the gruesome image of Greyback murdering Lavender Brown out of his head.
Though Harry never said anything about it unless asked, he always felt much better after talking to someone. Draco was always willing to be that person, but no matter how many times he told that to Harry, he never said anything unless asked.
came through, throwing a sheepish look at Kingsley Shacklebolt before settling down in the seat meant for witness for the accused.
of all people to bring the attention to them by clapping Blaise on the shoulder. Draco supposed this was payback for all those years of tormenting him. Not that he didn’t deserve payback, though.
He knew that Potter had kids and lived in the US, but the large Weasley family and Minerva, the only ones who knew where he was, refused to say anything about him.
“It will take time,” she echoed her words from less than a minute ago, “And I don't like you. I think you're entitled, prejudiced and a bully.”
Draco had an apparition license, but Harry had an Order of Merlin, First Class, and could apparate directly into the ministry because of his savior of the wizarding world title.
"I can't believe you got another one without telling me. Honestly, Harry, we live together for fuck's sake. How did you even hide this from me?"
He took a minute to look at her. She knew she looked a lot like father, with her pale skin, high cheekbones, and light hair. But her eyes, those were all dad’s.
Luna held up a thin silver chain. "You can hook it around this so you don't have to use magic to keep it hidden."
When the Dementors came, he listened to her when she told him to run. But when he ran, it was to Mrs. Figg's to get her to call someone to help. The elderly woman clearly lived in a magical home.
The lady at the ticket counter had made them feel slightly awkward as she checked over their tickets a few minutes ago.
He felt his heart beating wildly in his chest, and could only stare down at Harry. They had discussed marriage; it was only inevitable in a relationship as serious as theirs.
Potter reached into his pocket and pulled out a tan card. “These have Lily’s contact details on them. Give her a call to help clear your mind. She’s in the same situation as you. She can’t return to England because of the Dark Lady either.”
There was one where Harry and Draco were wearing old, paint-covered clothes. Both of them had been nineteen, sticking their tongues out at Pansy, who had been lounging behind the camera while they painted their basement.
The members of the investigative department were the ones who tracked down the missing people, looked at memories, and did all the forensics and detective work. They were the detectives and inspectors of the wizarding world.
Draco leaned against the counter, loosening the cuffs on his sleeves as Harry put his case files away.
It was easy to see the way they moved to protect each other, even though they didn't recognize it themselves until someone else had pointed it out.
She put her hand in is, and he pulled her to the dance floor, arms surprisingly steady against her waist.
But when she went to the great hall thirty minutes later, there wasn't a blond boy waiting to mock her. Here, it was a simple, "Alright, Potter?" from him, and a crushing hug from Theo, who she hadn't seen since June.
Ara had no idea what she was talking about, but she felt sympathetic anyway. "I'm Ara," she said. "I'll write to you,"
As far as he knew, Potter had disappeared three weeks after the war, after helping to round up the last of the death eaters. Draco’s father had been sentenced to 15 years in Azkaban. It was more like a normal prison than the torture chambers it had been before the dementors were removed.
And when she moved through the crowds, they parted for her. And there they were. The Malfoys. Narcissa, Daughter of the Blacks, and Lucius, who just wanted to save his family. And Draco. It was only a matter of time before the Aurors came for them. She moved to them, Lucius wary, Narcissa grateful, and Draco-
Draco’s shoulders finally released the tightness that they had been carrying ever since Hermione had told him that he would be flying out to the US.
"Slytherins," she said. "Assemble in the order of year groups, ascending order, please." The older year groups started to move on her command, and the other students scrambled into place.
"I was born male," Luna confessed one night near the lake. Ara had snuck out, unable to sleep because she couldn't stop hearing the hissing voice of the beast in the chamber. Luna had found her, and they both were sitting at the lake, skipping stones into the water.
Harry had missed an appointment that they had today, so he assumed he was working late or in deep in his casework.
The last question was directed at him, and he tried to clear his throat to answer. “I do.” Like the rest of him, his voice was hoarse from disuse and his voice came out raspy and just
Malfoy was going with Pansy, Hermione was going with Krum, and Ron was taking Luna as a friend as a favor to Ginny. The boys and girls in her year had all paired off, deciding to go together as friends, even though as a champion, Ara was the only one who actually needed a date.
His nervousness had eased a little as he had laughed, his mother and Blaise smiling at the mental image.
In the end, he just settled for the safest option. “Who will be escorting my mother and me to wherever we are staying?” he said, acting as nonchalant as possible.
Harry had been the one to change their nappies, the one to take them to their first day of school. Harry had been the one who McGonagall had floo’d angrily every time they had caused some mischief.
The mark had completely changed his life. It had been the event that made his entire life spiral downwards, and he would regret taking it for the rest of his life. But maybe it was finally time to let go of the past and start living again.
drunk. Just enough to start talking or rambling with each other. There had been a lot of confessions, whispered secrets, and apologies.
the weird sisters. The only reason she listened to them or had any of their apparel was because she felt like she had to like them because they were similar to her style.”
Scorpius looked down at him, brows furrowed, looking eerily like Draco did at that age. "Of course. You too."
Umbridge had given her that lovely gift in detention for every time she had stood up in her class so her classmates didn't have to. She pulled on her boots, making sure to tuck a magical unlocking knife into the hidden compartment in them.
When they fought hand to hand, they were pretty even in terms of strengths. Physically, Harry was stronger. He also had an uncanny ability to dodge hits, probably stemming from his childhood with the Dursleys.
The guest list was only family and friends. By some miracle, their wedding date and location hadn’t been leaked. The wizarding world most likely knew that they were getting married sometime this week since they had both taken three weeks off. The date itself hadn’t been made public, and the guest list had only those who they had been comfortable with.
She rested her head on Draco's shoulder, similar to how Hermione had stood last year with her. "Merry Christmas Draco."
When McGonagall whipped her wand out and there were gasps of horror, Ara almost smiled through her duel with a Death Eater.
“A lot of things in my life happened because of them, not just because one of them was my father,” he added wryly at the look Draco shot him.
He had been getting multiple dirty looks, and he could see people reaching for their wands whenever he walked near them.
“I have a meeting now anyways,” Harry sighed, grabbing a file filled with his papers containing his messy scrawl. He stood up and put it next to him as Draco reached up to straighten Harry’s tie.
Harry simply stopped moving his hand and caressed Draco's cheek instead. His hand was rough from a lifetime of fighting.
Harry pulled it back up, getting off of the sofa. “I’m changing into pajamas,” he called over his shoulder, walking out of the room.
“Nymphadora, Aunt Andromeda’s daughter?” Draco asked, even though he knew the answer. Potter snorted. “Only if you wanted to be hexed.” Draco looked up from where he was observing the baby’s hair.
With that, the students all stepped back, and Potter and his daughter stood on opposite ends of the room, both of them bowing at each other with perfect technique, settling into combative duelling stances.
Aralynn slipped into an empty carriage at the end of the train, and read silently until she reached Hogwarts. There was no redheaded boy with a pet rat, or a bushy-haired girl asking if she'd seen a toad. Not in this version.
He noticed small changes in Harry while they were on the job. Harry, normally cheery and sarcastic, stood up straighter, shoulders stiff when he was on a raid. His words were harsher, and he seemed almost cruel sometimes while doing interrogations, unless the person that they apprehended was younger than twenty.
"Sure, Malfoy." she laughed. She knew how favours worked in Slytherin. She had established herself as the top student of her year a few months ago after all.
Tonight, however, the common room was eerily silent. There was no one sitting there, and the fire had been put out.
"I didn't make prefect," Nymphadora Tonks said to Ara at the party. "Apparently, I lacked the ability to behave myself."
If it had been a weekend, they could have joined their friends in a pub night, or a club night if they were feeling particularly energetic and someone was willing to babysit.
She was thinking of completely renovating Malfoy manor and making it a home for War orphans and residents of the Long-term ward in St. Mungo’s. she wanted them to have a nicer room, rather than a shared room with 20 other people.
Harry slowly blinked his eyes, groaning as he got up. “What-” He looked up at the clock and nearly jumped up.
It was hard to see his powerful rival of so many years become so subdued and accepting of the cutting remarks he thought he deserved. He was glad that Draco felt comfortable enough around him that he could tease him without any awkwardness.
Harry was a natural with children. It had started with caring for Teddy from when he was only a month old and continued to when the various Weasley parents who dropped their kids off at Grimmauld Place when Harry was free.
“I know. But I’m one of Teddy’s few parental figures and It’s coming up on his first birthday. I saw pictures of the stuff Sirius did for me for mine. It’s practically
"I wasn't chatting her up!" Harry exclaimed, hanging his coat up on the hook next to their door "But yes, that is when I got it. It's on my bloody torso, Draco, I wasn't going to rip my shirt off randomly to show you. I'm not some impulsive teenager."
He finished beating the eggs, probably the only thing he could help with, and hopped off the counter, pushing the bowl in front of Harry.
“I’ve had enough of politics in my life, love. I’ll let your dad deal with them instead.” That had been a few years ago, and the question hadn’t come up again, though she knew the offer still stood.
He watched as the people trickled into the room and then looked down at his hands when he saw them staring at him. They were pale and long-fingered, even skinner than usual after prison. He looked at the area where the handcuffs met his wrists, where the skin was slightly red with irritation, and rubbed at it slightly, trying to soothe the ache. He clasped his hands together and leaned back in his chair. The room was finally full.
Potter grinned at him one last time before leaving the room, whistling the tune of a song he didn’t recognize.
"How plebian," Blaise drawled, but his wand was still pressed against Sirius' collarbone. "Use the swiss army knife in your boot instead."
He had seen what it did to his father for the year he was forced to stay there and knew he wouldn’t be able to take it.
Leo, Luke, and Roxanne had ended up in Slytherin. Aster knew that her father wanted her to end up in Slytherin, but she supposed that was only because he had bet on it.
A few hours later, after they had all eaten and spent a few hours playing random games, the dementors still came. She heard a woman scream, and she fell to the groundin a heap. The Patronus still chased them away. That didn't change.
Ara and her friends still did sit in a compartment with professor R. J. Lupin. It was Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Luna who piled into the last compartment they could find, Ara closing the door behind them.
She looked over their slightly nervous faces and smiled kindly at them. "We are still people. We love, we cry and we fall sometimes. You can always come to us for any issues you have, and we'll be here to help. If you find that you're grades are slipping, we'll have a tutoring timetable up by tomorrow morning. An upperclassman will walk the first years to their classes, and the third-years to their electives for the first few days. Students of the second year and up who are interested in Quidditch, give your names to Adrian Pucey, this year's captain." Adrian raised his hand. "The password changes every week and is up on the board next to the exit of the room. Let no one else enter the room. Boy's dorms are upstairs and to the left, girls to the right."
As soon as the surgery had ended, a good two hours after he had brought Harry to the hospital, the healer had tiredly called him in.
The first time Draco saw his reflection after the war was on a blisteringly hot day in Mid-June, a few days after the Death Eater trials had started. He left his chambers in the ministry holding cells with his hands locked in shackles that bound his magic, with two Aurors escorting him out.
“Granger,” he said, and she looked up. “Thank you. I won't disappoint” He walked over to the doorway and was about to leave, his hand on the door frame when he heard her speak.
Thankfully, the eighth-year students didn’t belong to their houses anymore and weren’t required to wear a uniform, so it was easy to hide under the coverage that muggle clothing provided. It also had an added benefit; no one expected him to wear muggle clothing.
Ara sneered. "You would do well to listen to him," she said, her voice sultry and soft. "I don't like being questioned."
"Neither are you," Ara shot back with a grin and a quaffle tossed over his shoulder. "For a Gryffindor."
Potter looked up suddenly as if he had forgotten that Draco was in the room. He saw Draco look at the tattoo and smiled lightly at him. “This was the first tattoo I got, at the end of May.” He continued to rummage through the trunk and the tattoo turned its head back to the other direction and settled down comfortably below the nape of his neck. “I wanted to honor those who we lost in the war.”
Potter looked at him and frowned. “He said you would be here after the last period. His class doesn’t end for another half an hour.”
They seemed a little younger than Scorpius, and if he looked to his left, he could see Arianna Nott quietly waiting for the lesson to start, a redheaded boy talking to her in low tones.
That had been in October, and he got drunk enough that he didn’t remember much of what happened. He remembered apologising, crying (not just by him), and a lot of heart-to-hearts from all of them. It hadn’t been pretty.
He was so used to not eating that he couldn’t stomach too much food. At the manor and at school, there was always something disturbing going on. Then he was too agitated to eat in prison, and when he finally came to school, he had gotten so used to not eating much that he couldn’t stomach much food.
There were a few raised eyebrows as Granger took a shot. Her blush was visible all the way up to her ears, even with her dark skin.
He had made sure that Teddy always knew that they were loved and valid. Especially when they had sat Harry down at fourteen, looking more nervous and scared than Harry had ever seen them.
Aunt Andromeda sighed. "Like kids, these two. Come, Cissa,"  she said. "I'll show you to your room. Ara, take Draco. Different rooms and no funny business."
“You too?” Lily asked her father, eyes flitting over where Draco was standing, and Draco’s heart nearly stopped.
Sirius laughed. "You sound exactly like Tonks and Ara when they were your age. You know, when your godmother was your age, she tore down the Auror regulations and helped rewrite them. When I say tore down, I mean
She hung up the phone, and Draco pulled his bag towards him, removing his work bag and unshrinking it.
"Did you know," he asked, "That we have major communication issues that we should have sorted out years ago?"
When she left, she deftly climbed the steps up to Dumbledore's office. She whispered the password and walked in. "I know you're going after a Horcrux next month," she said without preamble when he looked up. "I want in."
They were sitting on opposite seats, staring out the window. "You guys go in," Ginny said, a shiny Quidditch Captain's badge on her chest. "I'll scare away any kids who come this way."
He was still speaking to the man in low tones, now gazing down at him with one of the most controlled looks of rage Draco had ever seen in his life.
Now, she was Professor Aralynn (Black) Potter-Malfoy, Defence Professor, and Head of Slytherin House.
Ara kept the photo of both of them at the concert in her trunk, positioning it so that she could see it every time she opened it.
Teddy had been a Hufflepuff like their mum, and Molly and Roxanne were currently in Hufflepuff; Molly would be Head Girl this year, A fact Uncle Percy was extremely proud of.
It was the unfortunate effect of a madman taking up residence in his home for a few years. The hallways where he ran down, squealing when he was a child, were now littered with slashed bodies.
His mother spoke up, “Harry spoke up at my trial too, Draco,” she said, her eyes shining, “I will be on house arrest for the next four years, and will stay with you until school starts and during the holidays.”
So when the end of the year came, it was Hermione and Theo who accompanied her to the trapdoor. They caught the keys, beat the chessboard, and this time there was no hesitation when Professor Quirrell burned under her hands. Voldemort had killed her parents. She would make him
Draco's favourite photo, however, was a small collage of pictures of him and Harry that they had collected over the past two years.
"Slytherin is the house most looked down upon," she continued. "We are the house of the ambitious, ruthless, and powerful. We stop at nothing to achieve our goals. That being said, we aren't perfect. We come from different families and types of people. That is why you must listen carefully to everything I say. As Slytherins, we are not just looked down on. We are attacked in corridors and not given house points for our achievements. So remember these next few lines.
He had been extremely surprised since a patient's next of kin was the only person allowed in before visiting hours. He would have expected Harry’s to be Ron, Hermione, or Ginny, or maybe Andromeda since she was somewhat of a surrogate mother to him.
, is that I love you," he felt slightly shaky, and Harry stiffened against his shoulder for a second, and then relaxed, his free hand tightening against Draco's waist.
Which in this case meant Draco, but he had no idea why Potter would testify for him, after how much he tormented him when they were younger. Or maybe the saviour couldn’t go a day without saving someone.
Harry leaned on his elbow, his chain with the small moon pendant hanging down, tickling Draco’s ear.
Harry handed him a milkshake in a bottle and waved his wand over the kitchen area as Draco grabbed their coats and bags, which they had packed the previous night before leaving,
Harry unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt, standing up and stretching his arms above his head.
Theo had sent his daughters to Ilvermorny, fearing the stigma that they would undoubtedly face by being the daughters of a death eater. He hurried back to his hotel room, wrapping his dark coat more firmly around him as he walked.
No one knew why they had broken up. Both of them refused to say anything about it. Draco had been a little miffed that Harry hadn’t told him, but he hadn’t pushed. They were still friendly with each other when they saw each other at the ministry, though they made it a point not to hang out with each other or their friend groups.
There were pictures of Draco and his Slytherin year group, Harry and his band of Gryffindors, and one of all of them on their last day of eighth-year, smiling wide with arms slung over shoulders in the grounds of Hogwarts.
checked your family’s investments at Gringotts and hired a regent to manage the finances. How hard would it be to owl order a bottle? You own the bloody company.”
The numbers 500, 50, and 1000 were etched in ink, still, over the date of their wedding. The tattoo was muggle, unlike the other ones Harry had, which explained the plaster.
She hugged him tightly again, pressing her forehead into the crook of his neck. "I promise," she repeated against his skin.
A week later when she went to the boy's dorm to collect a book from Theo, she found Theo lying on Blaise's bed in the dorms, his head pillowed in the other boy's lap
She could still see her parent’s love going strong after all these years. They had moved into their home nearly twenty years ago, and other than a few renovations, it hadn’t changed much from what Aster knew.
Ara cast an immobilizing curse at a  Death eater who was sneaking up on Ron, and Blaise pushed her out of the way when he saw a green light coming towards her.
"Draco?" she said softly. He whipped around, brandishing his wand in one hand as he turned. She disarmed him with a flick of her hand, easily catching his wand as it flew towards her. It felt warm and familiar to her, recognizing her touch.
It wasn't like they hadn't ever had people over for the night, or the few, short-lasting relationships that Harry had. He was attracted to Harry, sure, but it wasn't bad enough that he would risk the amazing friendship that they had.
When Teddy went off to Hogwarts, their whole family had gone to see him off. She and Draco each held one of their kids in their arms (Cassiopeia Luna and Scorpius Regulus.)
Not when he woke up from nightmares of students being tortured every night. Not when he when into the kitchens only to see Fenrir Greyback grin at him with his unnaturally sharp teeth, tearing raw meat off of bones.
," Malfoy told them. The door opened, and the two of them lead the students in. Once all of them were inside and the doors were closed, Ara made her way to the front of the common room.
? Or something else equally rude, but if Potter was making an effort to be polite, then so would he.
No one would have made as good of a partner to Draco as Harry, but Susan was a close second. She was ruthless and efficient with her work.
Ara cracked a smile at that. Ginny was scary enough on her own, add a badge and green trimmed robes, and well- no junior would cross her.
Ara clenched her jaw, plopping down into a chair. "Considering you don't know any parselmouths or anyone else with a piece of
"I'll see you in a few hours," her daughter said to her, grinning as she boarded the train. She looked so much like Ara had at that Age, only healthier,. Both of her children looked like her, but Cory had Draco's colouring and eyes.
When Lupin came in, they all knew he was a werewolf. Hermione had tracked his absences and Malfoy had quietly confirmed their suspicions in the common room. When Snape followed Professor Lupin, Ara wasn't surprised.
"Perfect." He praised. "I'll get Tonks to put me on the auror team there so it doesn't look like you're lying."
She took a year off when she got pregnant with the twins the next year, terrified but also so excited to enter this next stage of their lives.
The shelves had been broken in a party that they had hosted two nights earlier, and they needed to get them fixed.
They entered Professor Snape's office. "Sit down, both of you," he said tiredly, much as Ara felt.  "The three of us are perhaps the most at risk in the entire school these next few years."
She could never figure out how her dad did that. He seemingly appeared out of nowhere and walked soundlessly no matter where he went. It made it very tough for her to prank him.
His head cleared as he walked fully into the atrium and saw Potter there talking to his mother. He had heard that her trial had been the day before his and he hadn’t seen her since he entered the ministry more than a month ago. He didn’t even know that she was free, or whether she was alive.
Harry suddenly whipped his head back to Draco. “Do you want to see them? Andromeda, Teddy, and your mother.”
He walked stiffly, legs not used to the exercise after so many days of sitting idle, and blinked when the bright light of the chambers hit him in the face, trying to clear the blank spots from his vision.
It had been a little strange for Draco, he thought as he showered, rinsing the shampoo out of his hair and reaching for the conditioner.
“There was something off about him,” Harry said as they walked towards his office. “Something he was hiding. Watch his hands closely during the recording.”
He had been too nervous at the feast to care about how much he was eating, and how horrible It would feel coming back up.
Ara scrubbed a hand over her face. "Listen, I don't give a fuck about yours or your family's allegiances. This is a school. As the upperclassmen, it is our duty to uphold the honor of our house and protect the younger years. If I hear a single slur against anyone for any reason, I'll give you detention for two months. You have all stood with me since I stepped foot into this school. We are family above all else. We're kids thrown in to fight in our parent's wars. Show the rest of the school a united front. I've assigned you all groups of students to lead to different activities and classes, the house-elves should have put the list on your bedside tables by tomorrow morning. Let me know if you have any issues. Good luck, and I'm here for you. You may leave."
Both of them showed finesse and grace in their steps, and his daughter was firing off spells with startling swiftness as he demonstrated techniques. When they finished a while later, the only sign that they had been duelling was Lily Potter being slightly out of breath, and a slight sheen of sweat on Potter’s forehead.
"Alright," Dudley said hesitantly. His parents hadn't taught him a lot of things, but keeping to your word was the one thing that they stressed on.
There were no cheers of 'we got potter!'. Only a hushed silence as she sat down next to Parkinson, Pansy,  a pug-faced girl who had been sorted a few seconds earlier.
He felt Harry's hand in his hair, slowly carding his fingers through it the way he did for Teddy when he was sad and looked up.
When Draco reached home after a long day of work, he usually knew what he was coming home to. His husband, if he had gotten off work earlier. His nephew, goddaughter, or any other of the Weasley children. One of his friends maybe, if they had the day off.
If she had been his golden girl rather than her own person, he would have asked her to come. But instead, he looked at her impassively. "It's dangerous, and I see no reason for you to come."
"I don't mind it," Draco confessed as they repaired the Slytherin Dungeons in August. "It keeps them from bothering you,"
Draco then realized that he had taken off his outer robes and was wearing a t-shirt underneath, the edge of what he had thought was a tattoo poking through.
The interrogator looked back down at the sheet. Next to her was a dicta-quill taking note of everything that was said.
"As someone who fell into it and can't get out, I will do everything in my power to keep the house safe," he promised. He pulled a thick book out of his desk. "This is a book on mind arts. I want you to read it. Lessons in your free period tomorrow."
"Agreed," she said. She looked at the rest of the prefects. "I want you all standing right behind me as I speak. The portraits in our living areas are filled with snakes," she warned. "I know everything that happens. Be careful, and keep them safe. We'll talk more in the commons, after the speech tonight." She unlocked the door and left, only sagging tiredly once she entered her friends' compartment.
They were walking to the interrogation room to take notes on a criminal’s information for this case. They knew that man in question had a partner, but so far, he hadn’t said anything about them.
I realize that this chapter deviates a little bit from the summary, but oh well, at least there's some solid Drarry content haha
Now that they were mostly adjusted to their schedule, Draco and Harry's little trinkets had slowly made their way over to their house, making it more homely.
"I feel like we should talk about this," Harry said, his voice slightly muffled. "But all I can feel is relief and I just want to stay like this for a while."
"I am," she agreed. "But not through my Dad. The Potters are rich, but we've intermarried with people of-" she made quotes with her fingers, " 'Impure blood' too many times for us to be considered nobility."
One of Harry's favourites was one of him and Ginny, dressed in what Draco’s father would have termed '
"Potter," Malfoy hissed one evening during prefect rounds the day before a DA meeting. "I know about your little club." Ara felt fear drop into her stomach but didn't stop walking, instead casting a wandless privacy charm that Snape had taught her.
Luna's father was been in the long-term facilities in what had once been Malfoy manor, recovering from an accident with a magical creature that he refused to tell anyone about.
One week at their weekly dinner at the Weasleys, Ron and Hermione announced their engagement, all hell breaking loose once Hermione held up her hand with the shiny ring on it.
Draco had stood by watching as Longbottom had been tortured enough times that he wouldn’t blame anyone if he woke up one day with his meager possessions slashed.
Draco pulled away, and Harry rested his forehead on Draco's collarbone.  He could feel Harry smiling, and laughed, slightly giddy with relief as he rested his chin on Harry's shoulder.
Harry dueled like he did everything else. He threw himself into it, letting the movements and instincts take over, ducking and twirling and firing off spells in unbelievably quick succession.
She smiled at him and it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. “I was just thanking him when you came in.”
Her father was one of the ministry’s senior-most Aurors and potions experts. She knew her father had been offered the Head auror position, one that would give him great political influence.
She visited Hagrid, but when the baby dragon's egg hatched, Malfoy didn't tip off any professors.  Instead, he watched from afar as Charlie Weasley collected it, and silently went back to his dorms.
"It does," she said, relieved. "I'm going to get someone to tip off Dumbledore and Fudge that Aralynn Potter is in the ministry Atrium, and get them to go there. I'm thinking Tonks for the ministry and maybe one of my Gryffindor friends for Dumbledore?"
And when she and Hermione sat near the lake, Hermione spoke, thumbing through a book about wizard sexuality. "Are you gay though? Nothing changes between us if you are." She looked up at Hermione who was seated next to her, their shoulders pressed together.
He grabbed a bunch of ingredients and deftly started mixing them, occasionally reaching up to their cupboards to grab an item.
Teddy was curled up next to her, his head resting on her chest as he finally crashed from all the sugar that he had earlier that evening. Sirius and Draco were off somewhere, undoubtedly searching for more food, while George tried to sneak suspicious looking blue liquid into Bill's drink.
There was the little dreamcatcher like trinket that Luna had bought them when she travelled the world with Ginny, from Peru hanging over the doorway. It made a little tinkling noise every time someone walked in.
The weather was warm, and the leaves were slowly turning orange, a cool breeze occasionally brushing against their faces.
Draco moved forward to kiss Harry, this time pulling him to his feet. Harry wrapped an arm around him and pulled him closer, nearly upsetting his balance.
They were all fairly similar, with slight adjustments in training and specialization to make sure that they covered all the areas of crime.
On impulse, she pulled him closer and hugged him tight, resting her chin on his shoulder and squeezing her eyes shut. He resisted for a few seconds but then she felt him slump against her, burying his face in her hair as he continued to shake. She cast a drying charm on the floor and pulled him down gently, holding him tighter as he buried his face in her shoulder, his tears falling on her shirt. She pulled per legs under her and ran a soothing hand through his hair.
Hermione laughed, and Draco could hear someone talking in the background. “I’ll call you after visiting tomorrow, then.” He said. He didn’t have anything else to say and Hermione probably had better things to get to.
He slipped out of the door as soon as they looked away and apparated back to his hotel room soundlessly before he accidentally revealed himself. He cancelled his dillusionment and muffling charm as soon as he entered the room.
Granger sniffed. "I was always bullied for being black. I hoped that I would be accepted here, but I don’t know…"
Teddy, Victoire, and Fred had already Graduated. Teddy, four years ago, Victoire two, and Fred the previous Year.
He paused, looking at the face of his husband, tucked comfortably against him, his phoenix tattoo glinting on his bare back.
Draco knew that he tried to be as small as possible whenever he wasn’t doing okay, as if that would make him disappear.
Scorpius was Hermione’s secretary, Rose worked part-time at Ollivanders when she wasn’t at Healer training, and Hugo was Head boy.
heard that the Diagon ally branch of the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes had been closed until the end of May, only a few months after it’s reopening.
“The dragon reserve in Romania,” she explained. “He went there for about five weeks with Ginny’s oldest brother, Charlie, for about five weeks before he came here.”
Potter nodded at him before grabbing his stuff and leaving for the showers. Draco grabbed a pamphlet and leafed through it distractedly.
The Aurors usually made note of the physical reactions leaving space below to write a more detailed analysis of the information later. The ID would then use that information and the locations given to look into it further.
Daisy was in Slytherin too, though she didn’t interact with the Weasley kids much, other than Leo and Hugo.
Ah. That explained it. He had his fingers mentally crossed that no one would point out his and his dorm mates' empty shot glasses. It only took a few seconds for
"Shut up, Potter," she smacked her arm lightly. "Of course I will. We'll be the most gorgeous couple there."
Big mistake. Potter was wearing pants and trousers, but he was still shirtless as he trifled through his trunk, presumably for a shirt to wear.
She babysitted little Rose Granger-Weasley, and Draco got down on one knee during their yearly trip to her parent's graves.
Anna? Potter clearly knew the Nott sisters better than Gen or Theo had let on. “You’re eligible for the same category that Lily is.”
Ara took the thread and Hermione secured it around her neck. "Never a boring day with you Aralynn." she murmured as the train took off.
She tutored Malfoy, sorted out the problems of her younger housemates, and graded first-year potions essays as payback for Snape teaching her Legilimancy.
"I feel like making a savior-of-the-wizarding-world comment right now, but I'll probably get hexed so I'll refrain from doing that," Draco laughed, one hand on the counter that he was leaning on.
“We’re starting combative duelling now,” Potter’s voice carried over the entire room, authority clear in his speech. “I will demonstrate the techniques and do our usual system later.”
She stopped in front of them and the two sisters took a moment to observe each other. His aunt Andromeda was slightly taller than his mother, and her skin showed wrinkles around her eyes and mouth; all signs of a good life.
"Dumbledore must be off his rocker," Ara said incredulously as she stared at her Hogwarts letter in Grimmauld Place. "Me? A prefect? He must be desperate to get me to publicly voice support for him."
Grimmauld place had been clean and nice but barren when Draco had moved in, with Harry not having time to make it a home rather than just a house. That had been because of the stress and exhaustion of starting DMLE training.
His daughter came to join him, and Draco realized that the students were packing up their stuff, some of them leaving through an exit at the backs of the room.
The two Potters didn’t look much like each other, but their crossed arms and slightly tilted heads were identical in stance.
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “I’ll be done by then,” he added, handing the file that was previously in his hand to Draco. Draco raised a questioning eyebrow at him.
"Where do you want me to start?" she sighed. "First of all, you know how I'm a parselmouth. I fell into one of Professor Snape's memories when we were training. I saw you telling him that I too am a Horcrux. I know about Horcruxes because I am Heiress Black and I have access to the Black Library. My room in Grimmauld Place was once Regulus' and he tried to destroy one, but I don't know what happened to it. There was a note about it in his diary. Lastly, I have basilisk fangs. Now you take me with you or I won't cooperate with any of your plans for me."
There were no fireworks or cheers, but Draco could feel Harry smiling into the kiss, and the warmth in his stomach slowly spreading. And that was enough.
“Same-sex activity has been legal here for a few years, which is probably why Hermione chose this place,” He brushed his lips across Harry’s forehead.
Pansy scoffed, waving her hand in the air dismissively, the diamond on her ring flashing distractingly in the light.
It had taken all of twelve hours after they went back home for the press to get wind of it, a picture of Draco’s hand with the engagement ring making the first page of the prophet and the witch weekly.
"Where did I go wrong?" He asked finally. "You hate me more than anyone has before, except perhaps Tom Riddle."
She saw Draco's wand shake, and she knew he wouldn't be able to cast it. She looked at Fenrir Greyback, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Professor Snape, and knew what was going to happen before it did.
“Okay I’m next,” Pansy said. She stretched out her legs, making her dress seem even shorter. Draco could see Terry Boot from Ravenclaw eyeing her. “Never have I ever fancied a professor.” There were mutters as a few people took shots. Once again, Draco felt no compulsion to take a drink. All his teachers were either old or completely out of his preference.
"They've been marked," she said softly. Ginny gasped lightly. She reached out and grabbed both of them on the arm. "Hey, look at me." they did. "We're going to get through this."
“Uncle Draco?” his goddaughter sounded confused, most likely because of the location that Draco was calling from.
, I actually take care of it.” Draco retorted, reaching an arm up to ruffle Harry’s hair further, making it impossibly messier.
Rather hypocritical of him, wasn’t it? To give those kids the food they craved to survive, only to not touch a morsel of food himself.
"Grimmauld Place," she called out, kneeling in front of the fireplace. She really hoped that someone was awake to answer her call. It took a few seconds, but Sirius' face showed up, sleep mussed and tired.
He had a vague idea of what Potter would look like too, but people changed as they grew older, and it had been over twenty-five years since Draco had seen him in person.
He raised an eyebrow back at her. "I thought you were gay too," he said. "You brought Weasley with you after all."
"Anyone who's anyone knows you're a Slytherin," Ginny had reassured. "Now let's get to Quidditch practice or Pucey will
Arianna nodded, as the rest of the students stood up and started to shuffle out the door, murmuring in confusion. Apparently,
The lack of food and his complete lack of physical exercise left him winded every time he had to rush around Hogwarts. He couldn’t even carry his book bag comfortably, even with a lightening charm on it.
Draco wanted nothing more than to stay here, but he had work to do. “I’m going to leave before we get carried away and I miss the entire recording,”
She was just as excellent as a flier in this version. But when she entered the first task, she bowed down to the dragon and spoke the language of the snakes.
“Will he turn into a birdie like Uncle George did last week?” her childish voice was laced in understanding.
From this close, Draco could see the top of Harry's head and his long dark eyelashes as they fluttered against his cheekbone. He could see the slight indent that Harry's glasses made on his nose. From this close, the only thing stopping them from sharing the same air was the few inches of height that Draco had on Harry.
Draco had stiffened, idly moving his spoon around in his breakfast and pointedly not looking at Ara when she went to check on the Gryffindor Chaser. Ara had been the one to find Katie suspended in the air that day in Hogsmeade.
She only moved to Grimmauld for the last week of summer, choosing to stay with her cousin (her brother, really,) rather than be cooped up in Grimmauld place with nowhere to go. She even refused Dumbledore when he came to testify for her in the wizengamot.
When the night came, Ara held the locket in her hand as they portkeyed back to the castle. She knew that there would be an attack on the school that night, and had made sure to alert all the prefects and some of the professors to keep the students under lockdown.  Dumbledore was sagging against her, still woozy from the potion that he had drunk.
She paused. "The stone is in the forest. I didn't trust myself to keep it safe, so I left it there. The wand is in Dumbledore's grave." She felt Draco's hand on her shoulder. "I kept Ignotus' gift though, dad. It's our family's, after all."
At the station, Narcissa Malfoy approached her. "I too, am a daughter of the Blacks," she said without preamble.
Strong, Beautiful Daphne who had always had her back. Ara had caught sight of her body while walking out, her heart dropping into her stomach as she slipped through the crowd in her cloak.
"I don't know if it's safe for you to come back for the holidays," he said. "But promise me that you'll write,"
And there was no guidance needed for Aralynn to reach the platform because the only thing that Aunt Petunia said to her before she left was to walk into the barrier between platforms nine and ten. So there was no red-headed woman to introduce her to her son.
The eighth years, being fully-fledged adults who would have been out in the real world by then, were given fairly free reign, and were allowed to leave and return to the grounds as they pleased, so long as they returned before midnight.
Draco just raised an eyebrow at him and returned back to his book. When he looked back up, Sirius was gone.
Potter looked at Draco and cleared his throat, startling him out of his thoughts. “I’ll see you then, Malfoy.” He said, awkwardly lifting a hand in farewell, before turning on the spot. Draco saw a flash of red on his shoulder before Potter disapperated.
She looked up to see him leaning against the doorway, arms folded across his chest. He was already wearing his formal clothes, and Aster had no doubt he and Father would be leaving straight for the ministry after work.
When December rolled around, Ara apparated them both to Godric's Hollow. She pulled Draco lightly until they came across her parent's graves.
"Hermione asked me not to tell you. Ginny came with me because she wanted one too. One thing lead to another and now all of our friends have a bet on how long it would take for you to figure it out.”
Hagrid was still the one who took her to Diagon, and he bought her Hedwig as a present. But there was no pig tail or a hut in the middle of the sea.
He glared accusingly up at Harry. “I would have been notified if you were injured.” It was a statement, but Draco knew Harry could sense the question in it too.
When she ran into platform 9 3/4, her Dad by her side, a flurry of movement caught her eye. The entire Weasley Clan had come to see the children off. She could see Teddy and Victoire, the engagement ring on Victoire’s left hand catching the light as she waved her hands around while speaking.
She tightened her arm around Ron and felt Blaise rest his chin on her shoulder. Ara could see Hermione's dark curls on Ron's other side. She looked at Draco's blond head as he ran out of the room, and etched his broken features into her memory.
It was Potter and his redheaded daughter. He looked startlingly similar to an older portrait of his grandfather, Fleamont, with his grandmother Euphemia’s colouring. Draco had seen the portraits when he visited his family’s main vault after his last promotion, the portraits conversing with their relatives.
After one night like that a few weeks ago, Hermione had woken them up. Her expression wasn’t like those of previous times (one of concern), this time she looked amused, eyes dancing with a hand covering her mouth. Harry had fallen asleep on Draco’s shoulder and had somehow ended up with his head on Draco’s lap, with Draco’s hand tangled in his hair.
, Harry was growing old. His eldest was at Hogwarts, undoubtedly pranking people with her cousins, with his youngest soon to follow.
He handed Draco the eggs that he had brought on the way home from a meeting with the teacher from the pre preschool group of kids that Teddy was going to join the next May.
And so the year went on. Ara continued to protect her housemates, brewing healing potions in the dead of the night to give to them when they were attacked in corridors, helping whip the Quidditch team into shape, teaching the other houses defence, and learning how to attack minds.
When her birthday was nearing, their friends in the neighbourhood surprised her with a cake that they had made. She was Aralynn Potter, defeater of the dark lord and Slayer of the Basilisk. She
Aunt Pansy and her husband had split when Aster was very young, and she had never wanted children anyway.
Draco rolled his eyes, throwing a loaf of bread at Harry. Harry caught it without looking at it and placed it on the kitchen counter. "You've been twenty for ten days, you bloody prick."
They had bonded after the first task over being underestimated as females. Ara still stuck to her policy of women supporting each other instead of tearing each other down.
“Yeah,” Harry had said, shooting a wry look at Draco as he had pretended to check his nails, bored air of indifference practically radiating off of him. “Boy’s trip.”
Draco scoffed. “They’re my family, of course, I do. But I read the detailed version of my sentence. I can’t leave Hogwarts until the school year is over.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. "And? Which one of you is flying over the Atlantic to seek out our chosen one?"
Ginny was the only other Slytherin to accompany her to the DA meetings. Ara had made sure that the rest of her house learned what they needed, after all.
His romantic attraction in Harry had started shortly after Harry had broken up with Althea. He had started noticing Harry in ways that he hadn’t before.
When Snape saw her, he started. He couldn't bear to look at or say anything to Aralynn, so like James with her questioning eyes and brown skin. But she wore his house's colours and her mother's eyes. So he didn't question or mock her.
The ministry holding cells provided only what he needed to survive. A basic amount of food and water, and bathroom facilities that had only cold water and the bare minimum of hygiene supplies. He had always made it a point to look clean and good, and here too, he did what he could to keep himself clean.
Ara leaned her head back on the cushion, feeling her hair pressing into her neck. "He doesn't know," She said. "I don't know-"
Draco wiped his mouth, leaning back in his chair. He arched his eyebrow at his best friend. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
They had spent the rest of the day walking around London together and then curled up on the couch as Draco read a book and Harry read the rule book for the Investigative Department for the third time.
The circle erupted in cheers and laughter at that, leaving Draco slightly stunned, but he joined them in taking one last shot before the group broke up.
They stayed like that, in silence, sides pressed against each other for a minute, before Draco spoke again.
"I'm sure," she told him, fingering the tiny bell in her pocket that was her portkey. "I'll see you tonight at Hogsmeade, love you."
It was an emerald encrusted Dagger that she pulled out of the hat, rather than the Sword of Gryffindor.
Sirius raised an eyebrow. "Either you give us your hair or we take it from your hairbrush. You're an underage witch and we're thirteen adults who can use magic."
Ara reached out to touch his arm but he withdrew it as soon as she came close. "We can help you Draco."
He rubbed at his neck, pulling his tie off completely, tousling his hair. Draco was suddenly reminded of a night a year ago, down by the lake, when Harry had looked eerily similar to how he did now.
A few years later, when Ara's kids were in their final year, she accepted the position that Minerva had offered her. She handed over her department to the previous head of the Aurors, and spent the summer reviewing lesson plans. Her son was Head Boy, and her daughter was Quidditch captain, both of them with shiny badges pinned to their chests as they got onto the train.
"Everything alright Ara?" Daphne asked from where she was seated on the couches in the common room that Ara was draped on. The rest of the girls were sitting around and chatting and doing their homework.
There was beating Malfoy in duelling and patrolling with him at night. He wasn't bad at all once you got to know him, Ara thought one day in January when Mr. Weasley had returned home from the hospital. Once he shed his pureblooded views, he was rather fun to hang out with.
They collapsed into the seat, smiling at each other as they watched Teddy and Victoire chase each other around the gardens, Ron tiredly running after them with feathers all over his face.
Weak, but it was the best he could do. It hadn’t been long since he had realized that he was in love with his best friend. It wasn’t an ideal situation to be in, especially considering they were roommates.
His husband’s crow’s feet were becoming more prominent each year. His own hair was starting to grey.
As they stood up, Ara called out to them. "And for merlin's sake, someone set a headache potion on my table."
“I got my set and Hugo’s; Father hasn’t checked my bag since last night. Teddy said he’ll send the map to me by mail, and the cloak is in my trunk.”
Potter smiled tentatively at him when a swan Patronus appeared in front of him. When it spoke, Draco immediately recognised the voice as his aunt’s.
Draco whacked him on the back of the head with the newspaper he had been reading, walking past him to their kitchen and rummaging in the fridge.
Two weeks later when she returned from the friendly match that the older Slytherins had held for the houses, sweaty and wet from the rain, Pansy was the only one waiting in the dorm room. She was standing in front of the mirror, applying eyeliner carefully, wearing nothing but a tank top and her school skirt. Ara pointedly looked in the opposite direction as she removed the quidditch gear she had on, Malfoy's words from the ball ringing in her ear.
He had gotten more comfortable with it now, with the multiple Weasley children, his goddaughter Dominique included. He and Fleur had bonded, being French-speaking and blond among the chaos of the Weasleys.
Ara proudly stood as maid of honor in Blaise and Theo's wedding two years later, and Luna and Ginny's a year after that. She walked with Dudley in parks that reminded them of their childhood, took Teddy to preschool, and prodded Draco on late nights when his mastery studies kept him up, making him sleep. She captured criminals and help rewrite reforms.
Draco cast a dillusionment charm over himself as he exited the room in the middle of the group, and then a muffling charm as he slipped back in, hopefully unnoticed. His spells were auror grade and he had years of stealth training, but the wards of Ilvermorny were unfamiliar to him.
He could hear Harry’s laughter until he closed the door and walked the floor up to his department, mood sufficiently lifted.
"I have a crush," she mumbled. Tracy pulled her down so she was sitting on the floor with the rest of them. "Spill," she commanded.
Draco clutched Harry’s arm as he apparated them to the section of the ministry where their classes took place, and they both handed their wands over for inspection before they entered their class.
He put his books in his room before leaving his room to find Blaise. They were supposed to go over pamphlets for apprenticeships and further education together.
After his last duelling basics and tactics class, Draco felt slightly nostalgic and bittersweet as their training group walked to the locker rooms to change.
"Whenever the kids at school brought up that I didn't have parents, I always shot them down. Mum and dad may have died when I was a baby, but I never grew up without a dad. I had a dad in every way that counted. I know I don't have to thank you, Harry. But you were always there. Aster doesn't know how lucky she is. She has you and uncle Draco as parents."
“Yeah,” he said, turning his inner right arm towards Draco to see. Terrible idea, now Draco could see his entire chest, and
He was excellent at them, words harsh in a way they never were outside work. He had drilled himself on techniques, pouring over them at their dinner table at night for hours during training.
Draco and his mother wrote to each other a few times a week, so their letters usually weren’t too extensive. She had sent him another letter the next day, talking about how Andromeda and Teddy had come along, Harry appearing for lunch to spend time with his Godson while the two sisters spent time with each other.
"I know you aren't returning to school next year," Blaise said quietly after a few minutes. She felt the rippling magic of a silencing charm around them, and saw Blaise's hand in his pocket.
“We have a special guest with us today, she’s going to be my duelling partner until John returns from France.” He gestured to his daughter. “Some of you may remember her from last year, or as Professor Grayson’s apprentice from this year. Lily Potter, my daughter.”
Harry's lips tipped upward slightly. "Like I've been tortured and cut open multiple times." he turned over, turning his bright green gaze on Draco. "But I feel better now."
He pulled Draco’s wand our from a pocket in his robe and set it onto the table. Draco’s fingers itched to touch it, to wave it in the air like he first did at eleven years old, and feel the rush of magic throughout his whole body.
Ara stood up, looking down her nose at the professor. "That would be the first time you prioritized my safety, Professor. Let me know when you're leaving."
AN: as of 25/5/21, I've edited this fic !! nothing too major but I've changed a lot of the dialogues to make a little bit more sense
He was suddenly aware that he had apologized to one member of the Golden trio the previous night. He had sent Potter a long letter apologizing and thanking him after their brief conversation in the safe-house, he owed him a life debt. What he had done for him couldn’t be conveyed in a letter.
"Nah." Ara scoffed. "Watch this-" Blaise twirled her around dramatically, and Ara felt her skirt swirl around her knees.
He looked in both directions to make sure that no one was watching him before he swiftly walked the distance to Blaise’s dorm.
They passed for siblings, or even twins, very easily. They were both tall, fair, and willowy, with light eyes and hair so blond it was nearly white.
She had socked him in the jaw as soon as she had opened the door, and then smiled at him and welcomed him in like nothing had happened, Scorpius gaping incredulously at them as they walked through the doorway.
She held a hand up. "My ring prevents any entry into my mind." The black heir's ring prevented any intrusion into her mind.
"Excellent," Professor Snape praised. "Even the Dark Lord couldn't get through Narcissa's shields if he wanted to. Potter?"
"Ah." Milli grimaced lightly. "He doesn't know you like him. I can hint at it in the dorms when I return Theo's essay if you'd like."
Dumbledore nodded reluctantly. "I will, on the condition that you do what I tell you to, to keep yourself safe."
Ara didn't mind Neville Longbottom. He was sweet enough and his grandmother was a force to be reckoned with, but he seemed to cower from everything. She had spoken to him a few times, and she felt a little bad for how he was treated, but she didn't want to be partnered with him in potions.
He walked over to Pansy, feeling lightheaded and slightly dizzy, before slinging an arm under her shoulders and helping her to the stairs leading to the room she shared with Granger. He could see some of the people talking and some couples snogging on the couches as he walked up the stairs with Pansy, who was significantly more drunk than he was and just about passed out.
“Both his parents are dead, and the anniversary of their death is coming up soon. He’ll never grow up with them, Draco. He’ll always have a loving family. But Remus won’t be there to teach him how to use the map. Tonks won’t be there to teach him how to control his morphing. They won’t be there to hold him or watch as he takes his first steps. They won’t be there to take him Hogwarts shopping or stand with him as he gets married. He will always, always be loved,” he said fiercely.
He really hoped that Harry would get up soon, or else he would be in a rather awkward situation. An extremely attractive man who happened to not be straight, straddling his lap. Also, said man was his best friend, who he happened to live with.
Daisy and Leo were the ones who Aster was directly related to. Her dad and Daisy’s dad, Uncle Dudley were first cousins. Aunt Luna and Father were second cousins, so Leo was her third cousin.
They had accepted it, but it had taken until they went shopping together for Hogwarts supplies the next year at the children’s request for them to have a civil conversation with him.
to prove his loyalty somehow. When they locked eyes, his wand gripped in his fingers, she pushed through his mental barriers the way that Snape had taught her and brought all of his worst memories to the forefront of his mind. So when he looked her in the eyes and cast, her screams filled the room once again.
He felt this feeling every time he ended a year of Hogwarts, especially after eighth-year. He felt it whenever it was his or one of his friend’s birthdays, and every time he saw teddy more grown-up than the last time.
It was unspoken between them, but she and Malfoy didn't speak to each other. He was a pure-blooded supremacist. She was a half-blood who had taken down his family's lord. They would keep all quarrels within the walls of their house.
As soon as he finished hurriedly casting some cleaning charms over himself and brushing his teeth, he heard Harry yelling outside his door.
She left the brothers to mourn and crouched down near the corpses of Remus and Tonks. She pulled Sirius into a hug, tears finally spilling out of her eyes when she saw his red-rimmed ones.
Aster was personally hoping to get into Ravenclaw herself. She knew Aunt Pansy had a bet on which house she was going to be in, however hard she denied it.
“Noted,” she said, making some notes on the parchment in front of her, “The wizengamot now calls upon Harry Potter as a witness to the accused.”
He was so lost in thought that he didn’t realize that he had reached the entrance to their common room. He said the password and entered, shifting his book bag to his other shoulder.
He had woken up gasping, clutching at his stomach. He hadn’t eaten anything but an apple each day for the past two days, which was
When the Potters found out that they were having a baby in the middle of a war, they were equal parts worried and overjoyed. When the Dursleys found out that they would be taking in their niece, all they felt was apprehension.
In the younger classes, it was now compulsory to sit with a member of the other house, so house unity was stronger than it ever had been. No one had a concept of house tables, except for the welcoming feast, Halloween, and the first half of the end of the year feast. Everyone just sat at their friend’s tables.
Draco held his wand arm out and both of their holsters came zooming into his hands. He tossed one to Harry, and they both got up, wordlessly turning off the lights and grabbing a small model of a nutcracker doll, an emergency portkey that would take them to the ministry to be debriefed.
Cutting curses like sectumsemptra had been a favorite of the death eaters, Draco knew that. He had just never expected that he would ever come in contact with them or their methods again.
When she went back to the common room an hour later, she asked her friend. "Ginny," she said. "Will you go with me to the ball? I know you were planning to sneak in but I really need a date and-"
Draco laughed, crossing the room in a few quick strides to tilt his head up and press his lips against his fiancée’s.
He switched off the recorder as Susan exited the room, and they watched the man being taken back to his holding chambers.
Teddy looked at her, slightly guilty. "Sorry. But I would do it again if I could. Especially with the loophole that we found."
"He did. The cousins that Rose and Hugo talk about? The ones who they're really close to? Those are his children. And one of your cousins too Scorpius, Teddy Potter-Lupin."
She felt another pair of arms encircle them and glanced up to see her father smiling down at her, his face holding the same wistful expression that her dad did.
He paused, cocking his head slightly, bringing attention to the scattered grey hairs that he had started to acquire. "Other than giving you the safe sex talk," he said, "That was a pain in the ass."
Draco hummed. “That’s good. Tell him that he can always ask me if he needs more money. Merlin knows I have enough of it.”
They sat down in silence for a few minutes, both of them undoubtedly thinking of Aster and how she was settling in Ravenclaw.
Draco also thought that he saw him ward his bed and his possessions, but he wouldn’t blame him if he did.
Lily shared a look with her father before answering. “I’m doing competitive duelling, but I’m getting a defence Mastery rather than a duelling one for now. So yes, I am following in his footsteps either way. I’m competing in the national Duelling tournament this summer.”
Every time he thought of the first time that he visited their house, his jaw tingled with the ghost of Hermione's knuckles.
He didn’t want to end up spilling any more embarrassing secrets, but he wouldn’t definitely have protested more if he knew how that game was going to turn out.
"My name is Aralynn Potter-Black. I am your fifth-year prefect, and this is Draco Malfoy, my counterpart. The two of us and the rest of your prefects are the ones to report to if you're having any problems. If you are in the first-third year group, you will report to Astoria Greengrass, the leader of the Junior sector. Astoria, will you raise your hand so that they know who you are?" Astoria raised a hand, and Ara could see Daphne looking proudly at her from a few feet away.
"Hello everyone," she began. "I'm Aralynn Potter-Black, and anyone who knew anything about me knew that Dumbledore and I didn’t along." She paused. "But for whatever personal reasons I had, even I can't deny that he was a great wizard. He was one of the first magical people that I had ever heard about, and this is what I knew." she held up a chocolate frog card, and there were a few titters of laughter from the card. "He was brave but cowardly. He was powerful but weak. He was an authority figure, but he was cowardly. And till this date, he is the only person that Voldemort had ever feared. For all I disliked him, he was almost a mythical figure to me. He was
"No, no, we can't put any dye in. Ginny sent me a list of the foods she can eat pre-season when she started dragging me into her workouts. She won’t eat any if there's dye in it."
And now she was back at hogwarts, her first real home, the gates immediately swinging open to welcome her.
you if you got up with me, or better yet, ate food by yourself, you bloody prick.” He heard Harry muttering under his breath after that.
"Ginny," Harry grinned. "She has our schedule and knew we had hand to hand today. She reckoned something would happen there. She also won herself 50 galleons."
His head was throbbing like someone was pounding at it with a sledgehammer, and his mouth tasted like something had died in it.
"Beat these, I'll put the bread in the fridge. Ron and I are having a competition to see who can bake the best cake for Ginny's birthday tomorrow. We need to make this her best birthday yet, especially since she's leaving for tour in a few months. No sugar or frosting though, or her trainer will murder her."
The DMLE trainees were all fairly touchy with each other, having spent multiple nights together, pouring over textbooks for their quarter yearly exam, dancing, or rather grinding together at clubs, spinning around each other in training simulations, or betting on who could survive best on 3 hours of sleep after shadowing senior DMLE members at a stakeout.
That hadn’t changed, she thought, as she folded her robes into her trunk. Teddy was still her role model, and other than her parents and younger sister, Teddy was the one person she was closest to.
He had always known what his wedding would be like as a child, the stuffy atmosphere in the manor’s gardens, with an equally stony-faced pureblood woman opposite to him as they stiffy recited their magical vows.
Blaise said. He didn't have to fake a French accent. His mother was Italian and made sure that he learned how to speak most of the European languages fluently. She leaned forward and kissed his cheek to keep their image, and also because she was just grateful to have another Slytherin with her.
A woman, who he assumed was doing the interrogation, was sitting in a chair with a desk in front of it a few feet in front of him. The desk contained four clear vials containing a clear liquid he could tell was veritaserum, for interrogating him. She had dark hair and square rimmed glasses, eyes sharp and intelligent as they took in the room. She reminded him of Professor McGonagall, oddly enough.
Hermione smiled, adjusting the files on her desk. "I know my best friend. I'll talk to him tomorrow, but I still want you to go, Draco." She looked at Scorpius. "And to answer your question, he has a lot of family here. All his nieces, nephews, and Ron and I. It's been a few months since he's seen Rose and Hugo in person too."
He tilted his head at him and raised an eyebrow. “I never got to know her,” he said, a little wistfully. “Will you tell me a little about her?”
He walked around the grounds, hands in the pockets of the jacket he had haphazardly thrown on before leaving. Lost in thought, he hadn’t realized that his feet were carrying him to the lake until he saw a figure sitting a couple of feet in front of him.
Ron grinned at him, shouldering his messenger bag. He and Hermione were getting ready to leave. It had been a long week for all of them, and Draco's mind was still spinning from Hermione's words.
"I'll do my best," she promised. Uncle Vernon didn't say anything to her, only shaking her hand before leaving out the door. It was only her and Aunt Petunia left.
He supposed it was a part of growing older. Every time he caught a glimpse of Teddy’s engagement band, he felt a tug at his heart. He had helped raise Teddy from when they were weeks old. It had been the only thing that had kept him sane at the time.
"And you as an older sibling," Harry said, shifting closer to Teddy. "You were one of the only things that kept me sane after the war, Ted. Everyone had paired up and moved on, and I didn't know what to do. But I had you. I know I don't have to thank you either," he teased. "But you were always a priority."
Draco glared wetly at him. "I'm pouring my heart out to you Potter, the least you could do is let me finish."
Draco paused, and they sat down on a bench nearby. He looked at her expectantly. "What did the kids do? Honestly, if they snuck out again, could you get Neville to talk to them-"
They found them at the end of the train, in the compartment that Ara had sat in on her very first journey to Hogwarts.
“Hmm?” Draco asked. He was exhausted. First the wedding, then the flight, and then his first time taking his husband to bed. His fingers continued moving, nails scratching lightly over a love bite on Harry’s collarbone.
“What does it mean?” he asked hesitantly. They had spoken about much more serious things, but Draco knew Harry’s tattoos were always both meaningful and private.
"Child, not son." Hermione corrected gently. "They're all grown up too now. Either way Draco, you leave tonight. Consider it a favour for a friend, or an order from your minister. I’ll tell everyone that you're working with MACUSA to solve a missing person's case."
She looked over the room, and everyone but Malfoy and Hermione were partnered up. As the best students in the class, they were allowed to work alone. She had just gotten up to get her's and Neville's ingredients when Malfoy spoke up.
Her family was insane and messy. She knew about the war, and the part her family had played in it. She would be joining almost all of them in Hogwarts this year, leaving Lissa to be spoilt by all the relatives since she was the only one left.
They were perfect in training simulations together, watching each other's backs and covering each other’s weaknesses the way only two people that were that close could.
Ara didn't tell Professor Lupin that she knew he was friends with her parents. She had seen him in the wedding photos, one of her father's arms slung around the Professor and her godfather each. If he had wanted to contact her by now, he would have.
It took him a few months after the battle to be able to eat anything filling or nutritious every once in a while, without it coming back up a few hours later. The quality of prison food had been bad enough. It hadn’t encouraged his appetite.
“Bloody hell, you two look like night and day,” Hugo exclaimed as they went into an empty compartment. He wasn’t wrong, Aster was extremely pale, and Daisy had taken after her mother’s dark skin.
She looked in front of her, carefully avoiding his eyes. "I need to learn all I can, and stay out of Dumbledore's reach."
Sirius was sad when they moved out, but he had his cousins and his godson, who now switched between his godparent's houses every few weeks. Draco completed his mastery, and joined the potioneer's ranks at St. Mungo's.
A few years passed and it was her other godchildren and then her own who she saw off at Hogwarts. It was Teddy's last year and Cassy and Cory's first. Her hair had a few gray strands in it, and a few more scars adorned her body.
Draco hummed, not annoyed at Harry for not telling him. “Another tattoo then? It’s been a while since you’ve gotten one.”
"Shut up, Potter," he muttered, but Ara could see a smile tugging at his lips. "I didn't want you to lose points for us. You're writing my Ancient Runes essay this week though,"
So, most days it was Harry and Draco. They spent the nights on the couches, feet tangled together in the middle, or on the floor, letting the light from the fire wash over their faces, shoulders pressing together.
His voice was sleepy now, he sounded like he was drifting off. Draco turned towards Harry, resting his head on top of his and wrapping his hand around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer against him.
He had met the requirements for the department easily and was now moving up the ranks fairly quickly.
She barked out a short laugh. "You know exactly what I'm talking about, Draco. You look at each other in a combination of 'I want to rip your clothes off' and 'I want to wake up with you every morning.’ I can’t decide whether it’s sickening or adorable to watch."
Potter looked at Draco's cousin before answering. “She hexed anyone who called her that. We called her Tonks, her last name. Only Remus was allowed to call her Dora.”
He smiled at his niece in all but blood. “Thanks, Gen. I’ll make sure you get double presents next Christmas.”
"Interesting," was all Dudley said, and Ara was relieved even though she knew he wouldn't care. "So you're gay then?" He said the word hesitantly but she appreciated him not reacting explosively to the news.
"He probably likes you too," Daphne assured, tossing her long hair behind her shoulder. "How are we going about this?"
The interrogator turned her gaze on Potter, “Mr. Potter, you will defend Mr. Malfoy after he has admitted to being guilty of all his crimes?”
Every single eighth-year student who had come back to finish their education was sitting in the living room for a game of never have I ever, along with Luna and the Weasley sister.
Ron and Hermione were getting married in a month, Luna and Ginny got engaged last month, Pansy was getting married next year to a fellow editor in the prophet.
Ara laughed. "I spend half my nights sneaking around the castle," she said. "Merlin knows why old Dumbles chose me."
"I haven't made it clear enough since you're doubting yourself so much, you melodramatic prick," he teased, echoing Draco's words from earlier.
when did Potter suddenly become so fit? He had come a long way from the skinny, pale first year that Draco remembered.
"I'm Ginny," she said, "I'm going to Hogwarts next year, but I don’t think my brothers will write to me. Bill and Charlie did, but they're all grown up now."
Draco felt the veritaserum working and didn’t even try to resist as the words flowed out of his mouth.
"Members of the household," Sirius continued, evading her elbow, "We wanted to take part in it too."
And when they went to the zoo for Dudley's eleventh and she hissed to the snake, he didn't push her and the glass didn’t disappear. Instead, it was a worried cousin who brought her to the side as his parents spoke to someone they knew. "Listen, Aralynn. Doing that kind of stuff in front of Mum and Dad is only going to make them angrier."
"They're all gone," he gasped, and Ara felt guilt drop into her stomach at what she was about to do. Tonks was Sirius' niece and Remus was his best friend. Tonks was like an older sister to Ara, and Remus was one of her only father figures.
was written in the margin, and she quirked an eyebrow at Ron. She had taught him the spell when they were on patrol together last year, to talk about the twins leaving school soon.
He pulled the top part of his shirt off, showing the right side of his ribs. It was a constellation, Draco realized. Glowing dots in the shape of Canis Major, joined by a thin line forming a constellation. It was small, but Draco could clearly make out the star at the head of the constellation, Sirius, glowing brighter than the rest.
They were warned of the third-floor corridor by the insane headmaster, and they were taken to their dorms, where the head girl delivered the message that would stick with them for the rest of their years. "We protect each other. We never turn each other in. What happens in Slytherin, stays in Slytherin."
Instead of cheering, she hugged her friends tight. Ron and Ginny, who had lost a brother. Tracy, who had lost her best friend. Dennis, whose older brother had been part of the casualties. Sirius, who sobbed in relief when she reached out for him. Hermione and Blaise, who were tiredly clutching each other, the most unlikely of best friends just glad to have survived. Parvati, who was crouching over Lavender's body. Only Ara had known that they were dating in the sixth year.
They sat on a blanket in the park, and though she saw a black dog a few feet away from him, she didn't think too much of it.
"Cut the bullshit," Malfoy stressed, and Ara looked up at him. She had never heard Malfoy swear before. "I'm here to offer you a deal. I keep quiet about your club and lead Umbridge away from it, and you tutor me in defense."
Though they didn’t mean to, Hermione and Weasley both leaned on each other more than Harry, simply because of the nature of their relationship.
There were the good parts, though. There was catching the snitch in the quidditch matches, and studying in the library with her friends. There was gently steering Ron clear of Lavender, and Hermione's smile when she did it. (She could tell that Lavender and Parvati were meant to be together anyway.)
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as they took off their coats, the students making room for them as they stepped to the front of the room.
Potter stood up and grabbed what looked like a helmet to a bike from under his bed before shrinking it and adding it to his pocket. He looked up suddenly.
He turned around to ward the door like one of them usually did. He didn't freeze or say anything when he saw her, but she saw something shift in his posture. "You're early," was all he said.
Draco put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and steadied him. “Luna’s fine.” He reassured. “Ginny and I were there, and
When she woke up in the infirmary, it was still to cards and well-wishers. And this time, Slytherin won the house cup. It was the first time she had seen Malfoy smile.
Scorpius put his mug down. "He married your sister then, Mr Weasley? The former captain of the Holyhead Harpies and the two-time chaser for the English National team."
Daphne and Hermione had filled in the role somewhat, but they were more like cool aunts than a mother. Nevertheless, Draco was beyond grateful for their help.
“But I know I can never make it up to you. My family and I have caused you many grievances and I have treated you horribly. I don’t understand how you can stand to be in the same room as me, much less talk to me. It isn’t worth much, but I have always admired you and I can never apologize enough. I am truly, honestly sorry for everything. I can only hope for forgiveness and you would be perfectly justifiable in not giving it to me.”
Later, as she danced with Ginny one last time, his words of ''I thought you were gay too." rang in her head and she went to the one person she knew would have answers.
"Merlin, you two." Hermione sighed. She looked up at Ron and Ara. "Both of you will make excellent prefects."
The clothing was standard grey prisoner clothing, scratchy but not so uncomfortable that it wasn’t bearable.
“You hate it when anyone takes food off your plate. When you’re nervous, you untie your shoelaces and tie them again, by which time your hands would have stopped shaking. You like the cold more than the heat because it makes you feel more alive. Whenever you feel like you don’t have enough space, you draw patterns on whatever skin is available with your fingers.”
"You once pushed me into the middle of a crowd of people in a concert and I found a note with a phone number in my pocket the next morning. You and kreacher once covered every single surface in my room with frogs." He grimaced. "Does that clear it up?"
She bought a leather jacket identical to his and wore it to the concert that they snuck out to watch on August 30th, two days before she had to leave to Hogwarts. They looked like father and daughter, with messy black hair and high cheekbones. (The fact that both of them were dressed in leather jackets didn't help either).
"I would absolutely love to explain this to you," he said, not sounding like he wanted to explain anything to him at
The first day of classes went by smoothly, and after hearing a few complaints about Umbridge, she told her year mates to spread the message- They would have a short house meeting that night after dinner.
"Didn't know you had a heart Malfoy," she said quietly as she cut the ingredients into even little cubes. Aunt Petunia's cooking lessons had been good for something after all.
There were moments when she saw the red lights of celebratory fireworks in the distance and froze, remembering Bellatrix's cackle and the flash of red light as she screamed.
“So that’s how you stalked everyone, Potter?” Draco retorted, raising his arms in a sweeping gesture.
He had fought tooth and nail, studied through nights, and practiced duelling for hours with Harry after training until he felt well enough to survive classes without fainting afterward at home from hunger and exhaustion.
“Oh, shut up, you try dealing with hair like mine before saying anything.” Harry sounded like a petulant teenager, which, Draco realized, he
"I see a common theme in your school years," Dudley said one day at the boxing gym. Sirius had been cleared the week earlier, and he had spent the last five days in St. Mungos. "Your headmaster being a meddling old fool."
He scoffed. "We came together for the image," he jutted his chin to the side, where Pansy was dancing with a Slytherin girl the year above them. "I'm not her type."
He was leaving his son to her mercy, a target already painted on both of their backs for siding with the ministry.
Luna still recognized Ara immediately. Ara was shorter now, with fair skin and a pixie cut, slightly similar to how Ginny had cut her hair a few years ago. But not much got past Luna.
They both grabbed an arm each and directed him towards the lift, to take him to the level where the trials were being held, their grips rough against the sensitive skin of his wrist.
Draco didn’t see Blaise anywhere, even though he had said Potter would be going out by the time he came. “Blaise said we would meet here now…?” his voice trailed off at the end slightly.
Draco made note of the man’s reaction as Susan recorded the interrogation. The man had slowly paled, and now he was fidgeting, his hands rubbing over a raised scar on his wrist.
They stood there silently for a few minutes until Adrian came out. The corridors were too risky of a place for them to talk in.
Draco shouldered his bag and held Harry’s out for him as they rushed out the door, Harry locking it by muttering the words to the wards under his breath.
He would then belt out the lyrics to the poem Ginny had written for Harry in their second year, while they chased each other around one of their houses.
"Minerva owled me at work yesterday," she told Draco one day. They were walking in the park near Grimmauld place where they used to take Teddy when he was a toddler, in the early 2000s, when they were young adults fresh out of a war.
"I've never argued with that," his voice was teasing but Draco could hear the earnestness in his voice.
After the sorting and dinner, she and Malfoy stood up. Ara signaled to the other prefects, and they started nudging at the older students to stand up too, calling out for the first years to follow them. After looking at the toad of a woman that Fudge had sent over, she had even more to say to her house. She led them to the dungeons, and gently prodded at Malfoy when they reached the entrance of their common room.
The first person other than family to congratulate him had been Susan. She had grinned at him as he entered their shared office, putting their new case file on the table.
She instructed them and corrected them when their stances were wrong. Draco could see a few of the more arrogant looking guys look a little apprehensive of a girl so close to their age correcting them, but one glare from her silenced them.
He moved to the lone chair in the middle of the chambers and was pushed down into it, taking in the seats in the courtroom that were slowly being filled in. He wanted to say that he could sit down perfectly well by himself,
She and Harry looked almost comically contrasting. Harry’s hair was long and tied up in a bun a little below the crown of his head. His robes were open, revealing a button-down and a loosely tied tie untucked over his slacks, sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
They gripped each other tightly, her head on his chest. Draco didn’t even try to keep his tears at bay as her arms wrapped around him.
Ginny had moved in with Luna once their relationship had hit the one-year mark, and though they now had the flat, Luna usually went with Ginny on tour, using it as an opportunity to study different creatures.
There was one where both of them were leaning against each other, tired grins on their faces after their first stakeout, with Draco's arm slung around Harry's shoulder.
Draco’s heart had clenched as they had walked in, Hermione hesitantly placing a hand on his shoulder.
Ara hadn't been wearing her signet ring because of her occlumency and legilimancy training, and woke up shaking from a dream about her godfather in the ministry.
Harry saw Draco’s face pretty often during meals, given that Draco and Hermione would have hour-long rants or discussions together, leaving Harry and Ron to share long-suffering looks with each other.
He sat there in the chair, idly twiddling his thumbs, and waited for the chambers to fill. He hoped he wouldn’t be sentenced to Azkaban,
Some days he saw Weasley with him, hands wrapped around a mug of hot drink, leaning on each other with tearful eyes.
And with that, He cupped his hand around Harry's jaw, feeling the rough stubble under his hand, and kissed him.
Harry was chatting with Susan Bones, walking next to him and Draco was getting his gym clothes out of his bag
So when nine-year-old Ara was cornered by Dudley and his friends, one of them spoke up hesitantly. "Are you sure, Big D? I mean, she's a girl-"
“Did you willingly join the man known as Lord Voldemort, knowing full and well what joining him and his followers entailed?”
For his holiday, Harry had surprised Draco by whisking them away to the Caribbean, where they spent seven blissful days among the wizarding population there.
Draco had returned the gesture, and they had just stood there, running a finger over the ring on his finger in awe for a few minutes.
Draco shot her a look. “I’m on loan from the British Ministry, Gen. I have important work that concerns him. I swear I won’t use the knowledge for nefarious purposes.”
His mother smiled warmly at Potter. “Draco and I will forever be thankful to you Harry,” she said, as a dark-haired woman that bore a startling resemblance to his other aunt walked in, baby in her arms. She walked in with the grace of a pure-blooded lady, her neck and back straight and her head held high.
And two months later, when Aunt Andromeda came with her to the ministry, Sirius at their heels with a babbling Teddy, she did get him out. Hermione and Pansy had helped her write a speech, the three of them curled up in the living room of the flat that the remaining Slytherin girls, Ginny, and Pansy stayed in together.
"Thank you, Professor," she said. "I won't let you down." she paused. "You knew my parents, sir, didn't you?"
Ginny still had the diary, but rather than tales of loneliness, it was stories of her friends and family that came up. Tales about her role model and best friend, and Luna Lovegood's creatures and Ron's chess games. It was about Hermione's study schedule that made Ginny feel all warm inside and Pansy showing her to class. It was the Carrow twins confessing that they didn't want to follow in their guardian's footsteps at midnight in the dormitories, and looking over muggle cameras with Colin.
Aralynn pulled out the black heir's ring from where it had been hanging around her neck. "I claimed it a year ago. I'll make it public once his name is cleared."
"Theo," he whispered. Theo shifted his arm so that his forearm was facing away from them and gazed resolutely out of the window.
His hair was getting longer, it nearly brushed his shoulders when he leaned back, and Draco could make out the line of his Adam’s apple and the curve of his throat in the darkness, warmth pooling in his chest at making Harry laugh.
Draco walked out of the doors of Williamstown Regional Airport; the bag slung over his shoulder the only visible luggage on him. He couldn’t have taken a portkey to get to where he was because of the illegal monitoring that was undoubtedly happening in the ministry because of the war.
"What a sweet young couple they are," She said loudly in her charmed-French accent, smiling widely at Ron and Hermione. Hermione shot them a flustered glare as Ron's ears reddened.
They were allowed visitors for an hour, twice a week. The only people who visited them were his Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, and occasionally Potter, who was now apparently a friend of Mother’s.
Classes would start in a few hours, and Draco was starting to feel a little sleepy. When they reached the common room, they walked in, waving at Ernie Macmillan and Padma Patil, who were drinking a mug of something in the kitchenette.
“It’s like you wait for us not to be there during meals so you can forget that you don’t have to eat,” he said accusingly.
When he finally felt well enough and had enough meat on his bones, he threw himself into duelling and hand to hand combat with everything he had, clawing up to the near top of the leader boards.
They shook on it, and Ara remembered how it felt to have those hands around her waist, lifting her up into the air.
He stood up and was about to turn away when Draco spoke, “Potter,” Potter turned around and raised his eyebrow at Draco. “I have something I need to say to you.”
Harry looked at him sheepishly, grabbing his clothing and muttering a wandless cleaning charm over himself.
When Lucius Malfoy whispered for his son to come forward, he did. But then there was Neville Longbottom weilding the sword and slicing the head off his snake. When Ara rolled out of the arms of Hagrid, Draco threw his wand to her as she faced off with the man who killed her.
A few weeks later, Hermione came to Ara with the idea for a defence club. Now that Ara had settled into her usual hectic schedule, she had handed over the tutoring to different students, and assigned students to teach defence. She added her own spells to the paper that the students signed, and Hermione distributed the galleons.
"Yeah, Ted. Answer her." Sirius said. Sirius was nearly sixty, but he was still working under her as one of her senior-most Aurors. He still had a
She stood there quietly after he left, thinking about how she hadn't gotten any letters from Draco or Theo since summer had started a month ago. Her letters to the Nott residence were all returning unopened as well.
“I’m visiting Andromeda,” he said, even though Draco hadn’t asked him anything. Draco nodded distractedly.
Teddy lifted his chin. "I burned every single document the ministry had on werewolves being dangerous."
Ginny laughed. "You should see her in the common room if you think this is her being interesting. She confiscated six prank boxes from Zonkos when she heard that the people holding them were using them to sneak into the gender-neutral dorms and harrass the students there."
And it went on and on, showing him healing kids in the dungeons and shielding kids from rogue hexes. It showed him throwing Potter his wand and many people gasped at seeing that it was Draco Malfoy’s wand that defeated the dark lord.
" she mocked. "If I can beat one of your stupid friends in a fight, then you guys lay off me and listen to what I say,"
He sighed. She had a point. “She better treat you well,” was all he said. She just smiled widely at him and turned back to the group, where Finnegan and Thomas were recounting their experiences together.
Pansy reached over the table and put her hand over Draco's in an uncharacteristic display of affection.
Draco was one of the ministry's senior-most Aurors, with more than twenty years of field time and even longer as a potions master under his belt. Scorpius had begun to work as Hermione's secretary soon after she had been re-elected, a little over a year ago.
At the wedding, Blaise and Ara were polyjuiced into a French couple who were friends of Fleur's. It made it easier for Ara to hug Fleur and Bill at the reception, and watch Ron and Hermione dance in the tent.
She gently placed a kiss on his forehead. Fred had been to one to give her the marauder's map. He had winked at her and spelled the steps to be less squeaky when Ara snuck out of the Burrow to go flying. He had spoken to her quietly in the kitchen of the Burrow less than a year ago, assuring her that he didn’t blame her for George's lost ear. He had hugged her tight at the wedding, telling her that Ginny wasn't the only little sister he had.
Right. Draco didn’t take herbology, and Longbottom hadn’t been in his room either. “I’ll just come back later then,” he said, turning around to leave.
Draco had a completely different approach to fighting. While Harry was broad-shouldered, with thick ropes of muscle down his arms and back, Draco was tall and wiry, all square shoulders and narrow hips.
The group of students laughed, a couple of them reaching over to give him a friendly punch to the shoulder.
The beautiful gardens where he zoomed around on a broom or had tea parties with his mother were now resting grounds for werewolves and practice grounds for dueling with lethal curses.
In the end, while they were walking down the beach, Harry had pretended to see a shell in the sand and kneeled to look at it. Draco had been too full and content to be annoyed, but he still sighed.
There was no animosity between them, and Althea had embraced both of them after the ceremony, her one-year-old daughter looking up at them with wide eyes.
Potter had a duelling mastery? And his daughter’s words implied that he had one in defence too. Masteries were hard to do no matter where you were in the world. Two of them were pretty impressive for one person to have.
Draco smiled wildly at Harry, pulling him onto his feet. “She.” He said. “We’re going to have a daughter.”
He gently waved his wand over Harry's head, wand just brushing the tip of his hair, murmuring the incantation for a healing spell.
Draco flicked his ear. "Yes, brat." He pulled back, looking up at his son. Scorpius was taller than him and had been for the past few years. "Stay safe."
Harry didn’t like being left alone with his thoughts, and he often saw him late at night in the common rooms. Sometimes he and Hermione were curled up around each other, his cheek resting on the top of her head.
"All right Potter?" Malfoy stood in front of her, blond eyebrows furrowed in what was almost concern. They weren't exactly friends, but he had taught her some spells for the tournament, and Ara had exchanged a few letters with his mother about the black vaults.
And so they didn't beat her up or make fun of her. It took a while, but by the time her eleventh birthday rolled around, Dudley no longer stomped by her room to wake her up or trip her when she was walking. She slowly established herself as a part of the friend group and hung around with them in the neighbourhood.
"I don't care who you like" she paused, looking over them, "as long it's safe. Besides," she smiled. "It would be a bit hypocritical of me to judge you for liking your gender, wouldn't it?"
“Malfoy,” he said in greeting, before opening the door and walking in. Draco hesitantly walked in. Potter was kneeling in front of his trunk, gathering what looked like bath supplies from it.
Harry shook his head at Draco in disappointment, removing his hand from the door and returning it to his waist. “It’s a tradition Draco. I’ve been doing it every year for five years.”
“It’s going to be so quiet without you in here,” he said wistfully. “I remember feeling like this while sending Teddy off too. You were only a baby, but he was most sad about leaving you.”
Harry cut him off again by kissing him and this time he turned Draco's head towards his and kissed him more firmly.
It was their last non-specialized class. Next week, specialization results were out, and they would choose or be assigned their department, ranking, and partners, depending on their exam ranking.
“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad; His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, the hero who conquered the Dark Lord”
Potter looked up from where he was smiling at the baby in his arms. “An auror should be accompanying you guys. You have a few minutes before you are required to leave though, your mom can talk to Andromeda until then.”
She spoke to him softly, eyes glinting slightly in the light from outside the door. “I wanted you to
His eyes twinkled at them. “I suppose it would only be fair if I gave you this and told you to keep one thing in mind. I took this from Teddy after they graduated, they knew I was giving this to you.”
Draco and Luna had lived together in a flat a couple of blocks away. It had been an easy enough decision to make since they were cousins.
Harry looked in the other direction and swallowed. He was silent for a few seconds, and Draco felt his nervousness dissipate. This was Harry, who he knew better than any person on earth. Harry, who knew him better than anyone else did.
The Slytherin dorms were apparently a lot more exciting than any other one since all the ex-Slytherin males took a drink.
Ginny stared at her as impassively as she could with her hand wrist deep in a box of bertie botts. "Define a thing."
"Hello Mr. and Mrs. Potter," Draco said. Ara looked at him, and he kneeled down. "You would be so proud of the woman Ara's grown to become."
Quidditch lessons came and Ara pulled Malfoy's hand down when he made to reach for the Remembrall. "Don't give us a bad reputation Malfoy," she muttered as Madam Hooch took Neville to the hospital wing.
Harry had returned home nearly every day with extremely sore muscles for a whole month until he slowly got used to it.
Ara slipped on her ring and changed into more comfortable clothes, running a finger over the raised words over the back of her hand.
“I didn’t hear anything about it and I was over at Ron and Hermione’s flat before I got your call. They would have mentioned something.”
She came closer, reaching a hand out to him, and gently used an arm to maneuver him towards her. He pointedly looked in the other direction, but Ara could feel him shaking under her hand.
The next thing he noticed was that he usually got up before the sun rose so that he and Harry could go on a run and make breakfast before DMLE training, and that he should not be feeling or seeing the sun when he woke up.
“You told me that you ate in the kitchen last night.” Draco looked away guiltily. Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him up, disrupting Draco’s balance in the process.
But when Hermione tried to make an excuse, Ara stomped on her foot hard. "Granger was alone, and I came to talk to her," she explained to an irate McGonagall. "We didn't know."
"I'm not sure yet," Ara said, leaning her elbows back on the grass. "But that does sound like it fits"
He recognized all of them fairly easily, the first was of Potter in Malfoy Manor, multiple stinging hexes on his face.
Harry grinned, the expression looking slightly maniacal in the dark night. “I know,” he stated. “But it’s more fun seeing her reaction when I get one rather than me telling her. She saw it last night.” He frowned. “Well, a few hours ago actually. She sighed in exasperation and muttered something about
The memories kept changing to show him at Hogwarts helping the students evade capture and torture. It showed him, screaming in pain, being crucio’d by Alecto Carrow for refusing to torture a first-year student.
Draco’s chin trembled. Even thinking about it made dread coil in his stomach, even though he knew the man was dead. He knew that when he spoke, his voice would come out shaky.
Potter smiled at Teddy gently lifting the toddler’s chubby hands off his t-shirt. Teddy gurgled happily at Potter and lifted his hands off. Of course, the boy wonder was a natural at taking care of children. What else could he expect from their saviour?
Harry sagged in relief, bringing all the papers that were together on the table together and arranging them in some pattern that Draco didn’t care to analyze.
“I imagine she’s going through a tough time,” Draco had said comfortingly, reaching up and patting the hand that Harry hadn’t been using to stir their potion. “And so are you. You lost one of your only parental figures too, Harry. You don’t have to be there for everyone.”
When Draco showered or changed, he could easily count his ribs. His cheekbones looked significantly less gaunt than when he had been released from prison, and he didn’t look like a tall, walking skeleton anymore, but he still looked skinny. Slightly unhealthily so.
He expected it to be a stag, or a doe to symbolize her parents. Aralynn Potter may have had her father's eyes and her mother's hair, but she was her own person, and she made sure everyone knew that. Her parents hadn't raised her. While she loved the memory of them dearly, she didn't let anyone compare her to them.
“I threw a vase into the wall the day I found out that all of our year group would be getting a chance to come back for the eighth year. I didn't think some of you deserved another chance. I thought about it later and it lead to me testifying for you the month after, but I meant what I said in the courtroom. We were all kids, and I was unfair to you too. I humiliated and shamed you too when I shouldn't have. I accept your apology.” He said, “But only if you'll accept mine too. I shouldn’t have treated you so badly when I didn’t know how your life actually was, especially in sixth year. I didn't know what the curse was and regretted casting it the second I saw what it did.”
Susan took Harry’s place on the table as he walked around the room, interjecting every few seconds to add on to Harry’s questions. It was only a few minutes before the man started to tremble, spilling out the information they needed.
Draco may have made fun of him for it all the time, but he could appreciate it’s benefits, especially when he was benefited from it too.
"Yes, Professor," she said. When the five minutes were up, they were whisked away from the station and were admitted into the Hogwarts grounds. They spent the next few hours on the grounds, chasing each other around and taking turns on Ara's Nimbus 2000 that she had bought in Diagon.
His eyes flitted over Draco’s for a second, and Draco’s auror training was the only thing preventing him from flinching or revealing what he thought. Potter looked back at the group.
He brought out the files on the Dark Lady and began to compile the worst information and the information on her Horcruxes that he had found.
He pulled out a big vial from his pocket with silvery fluid floating in it. Draco recognized it instantly. Memories. Potter spoke again, “These are memories of all the people whose lives he has helped save.” He rolled the vial in between his thumb and forefinger. “There are the memories of over twenty people here, myself included. The memories will be projected into the chambers by the pensive. Are there any objections?”
“Would it be socially acceptable for us to leave within the next hour? I know we have a flight to catch tonight so we have to leave early anyway, but I want to get home.”
"Tryouts are on Tuesday," he said. "Both of you are keeping your place right?" they nodded. "Brilliant," he said, "I already have a few names, and I would appreciate it if you both were there," he added and left, robes swishing behind him.
He supposed he was to be grateful to them from freeing him from a life of servitude. But after six weeks of living in a ministry holding cell with little to do and eat, knowing that the Malfoy name would be tainted forever, there wasn’t much left to be grateful for.
It wasn’t until he said the words that he realized how snide he sounded. Potter had always had a way of bringing out the worst in him.
"I'm a little surprised that they sorted Ravenclaw," she said to her husband during breakfast the next day. "But, I'm so proud."
In the event that there is an issue to deal with, you will report to the prefects, and we will convey as such to our head of house. Slytherins keep all fights within our walls.
"I-" she hesitated. "It's going to be dangerous. But it's your choice. And I can't say that having an extra hand or two wouldn’t be useful."
Draco grabbed his robes and all but ran down to the kitchen, flipping off a laughing Sirius in his Portrait. Harry looked just as disheveled as he felt, his hair sticking up in all directions reminiscent of his early school days, and the buttons of his robes only half done.
She had been many things in her life. Aralynn Potter-Black, the girl-who-lived turned woman-who-won, and Slytherin's head student. She had been a prefect, a war hero, a girlfriend, a goddaughter, a godmother. She had been a best friend, an auror, and a wife. She had been a sub-department head, a department head, and a mother.
He looked battered and bruised, and Draco immediately identified it as the day he lied to the Dark Lord about Potter. It showed him failing to identify Potter, and many people sucked in a breath as it switched to the next memory.
Draco sighed, turning to face Harry and looping arm around his neck. They were on break for another thirty minutes anyway. “I know, I’ve seen it all five years. You knew she would get back at you some way. And I do think this is Susan’s doing, she looked annoyed today morning.”
When Ara entered the compartment that she and her friends usually took, Malfoy and Theo were nowhere to be seen. She and Blaise scanned the train after they came back from Slughorn's meeting, Ginny at their heels.
The name fit it well, he thought. Almost all young purebloods were taught how to mask their emotions from an early age.
The questions continued for a few rounds. Some questions were obscenely dirty, and some were pathetically boring. There was only one topic that everyone skirted around deliberately. The war. Draco was perfectly content with answering the random questions that had been thrown at them. Most of his exploits had been during the war so he was
He nodded at them, looking annoyed but holding an empty photo frame in his hands. "This is a portkey. It will activate in five minutes and deposit you in front of the gates, where I will be waiting. Until then I will examine the other side of the barrier to see what the matter is. Miss. Potter, I trust that you will make sure that you and your peers get there safely?"
He saw Andromeda approaching with a squirming Teddy in her arms, and made a split-second decision, grabbing his robes from where they were discarded on the chair.
She remembered them swinging her around, her Aunt Ginny shrieking at them to be careful. She had been only four, and Teddy had been one of her first role models.
Little Ginny Weasley was surprised and overjoyed a day later when her new friend turned out to be Aralynn Potter, and apprehensive when she heard that the girl was a Slytherin. But she had been kind to her and written as she'd promised to.
By the time he was seventeen, the grey rapidly shifted to a jet black, with screams of children being tortured haunting his dreams and running through a battle hoping his parents weren’t hit by green light, clutching his mother’s wand.
Tracy nudged her shoulder. "Blaise spilled. Did you two-" Ara clapped a hand over her mouth. "Yes, we're dating. Yes, we kissed.
Ron still stepped up. "If you want to get her," he growled to Sirius Black, "You'll have to get through us." His leg was still broken, and it was Blaise's wand that pressed against Sirius' throat.
Potter cocked an eyebrow at the people in the chamber. At that moment Potter looked every bit the saviour. Rich, handsome and powerful. A woman that looked vaguely familiar spoke up.
He rolled his eyes. Sirius usually switched between his vaults, where Harry’s grandparent’s portraits were, Aunt Andromeda’s house, and Grimmauld Place. He also had a nasty habit of speaking up and surprising people when they least expected it.
Sirius Black's face appeared on telly one day as Ara shelled peas in the living room. Dudley was doing his Summer reading, and Aunt Petunia was looking through a magazine.
"I'm so proud of you, my darling girl." Her mother's silver figure was in front of her, only a few years older than Ara was now. She rolled the stone in her hand.
The lights suddenly brightened as two figures strode in, and the students around Draco quickly became silent as one of them shut the door behind them.
more boring than the Slytherin dorm after lights out.” He threw his shot back, and swallowed, feeling the alcohol burning down his throat.
They had nothing against Scorpius, they had met him a few times and thought his son was charming and polite. It was Draco that they had a problem with. Astoria had brought Scorpius over once the day before Christmas to pick up a book of Scorpius’s that Rose had actually packed, but her illness had been getting worse off late so Draco had to take him.
Harry had never called him mate like he did when talking to Ron or Finnegan. They were pretty physical with each other, though that was probably a result of Draco’s upbringing as a pure-blooded heir and Harry’s less than stellar childhood.
“Hey Ted,” he said, and Teddy dropped his hands down from his face. “How do you feel about a little sister?”
The walls of the lift were made of shiny metal, and he could see his reflection in them. He was a shell of his old self. His hair hung thin and pale around his face. He had lost weight, and he looked skeletal. His cheekbones were more visible than usual, and his eyes had purplish bruises under them. Those were clearly from the nightmares of the past few years that had plagued him off late.
Her dad was the head of the Investigative Department, and she knew he was going to be promoted to head of DMLE within the next ten years.
And when the newspapers were flooded with talk of Voldemort returning the next morning, she winked at Dumbledore while drinking her tea. The look on his face after would fuel many of her patroni in the future.
Both of them looked over at Lily Potter, who was angrily lecturing one of the, particularly arrogant looking boys. Draco knew that type, every class had one of them. Draco was suddenly reminded of his ex-sister-in-law and the way that she argued in the courtroom.
Potter then started drunkenly listing out every time he had been in danger in the castle, from the entire school body
Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco, tugging at the knot of his tie, loosening it before joining Draco at the stove.
Draco had deserved that and far worse, and hadn’t complained as they spoke politely but icily to him throughout the visit. It had been awkward, just the three adults as Rose had dragged Scorpius and Hugo to the backyard to play quidditch.
Harry had felt that same pride and nostalgia and was the first to embrace his nephew, having been the first openly lgbtq+ member of the family.
Harry and Draco were in the lounge in the airport, bundled up in sweaters. Both of them touched their wedding rings every few seconds, smiling at each other in disbelief every time they caught each other’s eye.
“Good morning class,” he spoke to all of them, nodding at Arianna before resting his eyes on all of them as a whole.
Harry always got affected more negatively than usual when it was a child as a victim, most likely as a result of his childhood.
A few hours later, he sunk tiredly into the chair in his hotel room, dialling Hermione’s phone number on the phone that Scorpius had forced him to buy a few years ago.
The reserve? He had no idea what Potter was talking about until Luna leaned towards him and spoke, her hair tickling his cheek.
He knew that he was cockblocking himself, but he squashed down his feelings and yearning and decided that it could wait. His priority was making sure Harry was safe.
“It’s dark outside Harry, I know you’re obsessed with collecting souvenirs, but it baffles me as to how you could want one-”
"I consider myself in the grey category. I'll use any means necessary to get what I want, but I won't hurt anyone if I can help it."
Teddy laughed harder, clutching at their stomach now. “I can see the look on your face, oh god Harry. You’ll be so shocked when she’s older.”
Andromeda wanted to start working again and someone needed to look after Teddy on the days that Harry or Mrs. Weasley weren't available.
Potter inclined his head to the side, “Let’s give them their space Malfoy, come meet your cousin.” He walked away, gently bounced the baby in his arms.
They weren't allowed any possessions from the manor, other than books that were strictly non-fiction and one picture or portrait of their choice. Shortly after they had arrived, two Aurors- brother and sister by the look of it, had come to take their measurements for clothing. They were allowed to use one of the minor vaults to pay for expenses, and they had both agreed to wear the muggle clothing that they had been told that they were getting.
This time, Harry had the upper hand. The fight ended with Harry straddling Draco's lap, his forearm against his throat. The fight had lasted well over 20 minutes, and both of them were breathing heavily. Draco could feel sweat slowly trickling down his neck, and grimaced at the feeling.
Ara still visited Daphne's grave every month. Sometimes, Pansy, Tracy, and Milli would come with her, all of them silently sitting there or talking to her about their lives. All of them had grown older, and Ara could see a few laugh lines near her eyes when she smiled in front of the mirror.
She shot a grateful smile at Potter. “Thanks, Professor.” She said. “I’ll think about it, and give you an answer soon. I’m trying out for the championships either way.”
Ron shot him a nervous look, clasping his hands in front of him. Draco could tell that he wouldn't be happy with the answer.
"I'm still figuring it all out," she said softly as they bowed to each other. He held a hand out and she put hers in it, slightly stunned when he pressed a cool kiss to her knuckles.
The criminal and his partner had been keeping a little girl hostage, draining blood from her every full moon.
"Ask her if the position will be open in a few years, then," he suggested. "I know how much you love teaching, and I can tell that the department is wearing you down."
Teddy had moved to Asia, studying Magical law with Victoire. He still called them every week to talk, chatting and complaining about things in a way that she remembered talking to Sirius about Auror training when she was his age.
"Hermione and I came here last year," she said and kneeled down. "Hey mum, dad," she said softly. "I'm back. It's been a while since I've seen you, and a lot has changed."
The first time they had spoken to him properly was when Astoria was on her death bed a year after the shopping incident.
Tracy waved a dismissive hand. Ara threw some floo powder into the fireplace. She and her dormmates had torn down the wards preventing floo calls years earlier and used it regularly to talk to their families.
Draco knew the meeting was important, and he knew Harry would have a good explanation for it when he came back. It wasn’t like he didn’t want Harry to get any tattoos, but he could see that they were addicting and thought that Harry needed to slow down a little.
“Leo!” she heard Aunt Ginny Shriek. “If I hear a single complaint from Professor McGonagall this year, I swear to god, I will ban you from flying for an entire summer.”
There was a slight protest from some of the people sitting around him. Weasley punched him weakly on the shoulder. “Don’t talk about women like that, mate,” he said, sounding slightly disoriented. Draco rolled his eyes. Honestly, did these people have no shame? He expected better from a bloody Hufflepuff.
Harry hummed contentedly, closing his eyes. Draco hesitated for a second, and slowly started running his hands through Harry's hair, the way that Harry had earlier.
In the dorms, there wasn't much talking between the girls, but as they walked to breakfast the next morning Tracy Davis sat down next to her and showed her what fork to use. "Us half-blood Slytherins need to stick together," she said and buttered her toast.
Harry ran his hand over the plaster, and it came loose under his fingers. He pulled it off, and Draco leaned closer to see what it was. As soon as he moved, Harry gripped his shoulder.
They had only one class today in the morning, to wind up whatever they learned on the last day before exam results and specializations came out, but it was two hours long and started in fifteen minutes.
Harry gave him a weak smile, "At least we'll have matching scars now," Harry's voice was gravelly, and it sounded like it hurt to speak. Still, Draco had never been as relieved to hear someone’s voice in his entire life.
“You’re an open book Potter,” Draco teased, nudging his foot gently. “Even a bowtruckle could tell that you were thinking about something serious.”
- the stars as glowing dots in the position of the constellation of canis major with the star Sirius brighter than the rest.
The lights were dimmed, and Draco stood glamoured in the corner of the large room among the students, most of them chattering excitedly.
He could feel the coolness of the metal of her engagement ring on his hand. All his friends were getting married.
Three days later, Ara paid the boxing gym some money she had converted from her trust vault, walking next to Dudley as they entered his class. Now that there was
As much as he liked teasing Harry, Draco knew he was right. He walked closer to him and gently grabbed Harry's jaw. Merlin, this was doing
He led her to her bed, before taking off her shoes and kissing her lightly on her forehead, before turning around to leave. He froze when he saw Granger in front of him, leaning in the doorway. She looked suspiciously sober, compared to how drunk she was when he last saw her only a few minutes ago.
"Thank you, Parkinson," Ara said to them. She had caught onto the way  Slytherins' way of calling each other by last names until they had permission to do otherwise. "I've seen so many girls tear each other down for their own benefit. I'm hoping we won't be like that?"
A few more sentences about why she was there and the Hungarian Horntail lifted the golden egg in her mouth and handed it to Ara. She gently put her hand over her warm snout.
Her hair was slightly lighter than Bellatrix, and her eyes didn’t show the same madness as their sister’s ever had.
"So guys," she said nervously once they were all seated. "I went to Gringotts last month, and I uh, did a thing."
Draco had come as far into the hospital as he could, face pressed against the glass of the room so he could see what was happening. There were flurries of robes and blood.
He pulled the hood of his red muggle hoodie over his head, hoping that it would cover the ends of his short hair and prevent anyone from recognizing him.
"He's an adult," Draco said. "But being my son and Hermione's assistant has put an extremely large target on his back. See that you do."
Harry smiled gratefully at him, lifting his shirt slightly higher to heal the bruise above his injury with a quick episkey, and waving his wand once more to clear the blood above it.
She ripped them off the wall in the atrium and set them on fire after Kingsley told her about the restrictions present."
She flipped Voldemort off as the portkey took her back to Hogwarts. She was shaking from the cruciatus curse, clutching Cedric's still-warm corpse, and bleeding from at least six different cuts all over her body. But she couldn't resist.
They didn't beat her or put her in a cupboard. But that was becuase they were worried about what the neighbours would think. Instead, she learned to cook and clean and wore secondhand clothes was told that her parents were drunkards. That didn't change.
work together to protect our house. We are the most at risk, and the most likely to be blamed if something goes south. I want a list of all the students at risk, and
He poured Teddy a mug of tea from their cupboards and set another aside for when Draco would inevitably join them when he returned from his briefings.
Draco had grown up with money, and now that his family had regained some of it, he liked to spend it on lavish holidays for his family to enjoy.
She hadn’t lost the American accent that living in the United States for nine years had given her, though she had been back in England for two years now.
Normally they would have said something, but this was a muggle woman and it was their wedding night.
Ron, who was staring at his badge with an equally surprised look, snorted. "The two of us are the absolute worst people to be prefects." he said, his eyes wide.
Draco put his bag on the chair that he had occupied earlier and sat on the edge of Harry's bed, toeing off his shoes and crossing his legs.
