(10:39 am) A mutual friend sent out a wedding announcement and it brought up a lot of feelings. But they’re best left buried.
He straightened and used Draco’s wand to clean them up, and then buttoned him back up. “There, good as new. Didn’t even muss your hair.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please do not spend the next hour worrying about getting
Changing his clothes meant generating laundry and if there was anything Draco learned in the two weeks of living with his friends in Malfoy Manor it was that laundry fucking sucked. More than anything. He had regret for every House Elf he’d ever harangued about laundry because they were all angels sent from heaven for doing that one very important task.
He hated the view from so many centimetres down. He hated how his centre of gravity was all off. He hated the coiled tension that made him want to spring into action for no good reason.
“Yes,” Daphne sighed shakily. “She’s around too.”
“You thought I’d be eager to help the family that turned their backs on me?”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and whispered, “Don’t linger. I want to take you back to our room and fuck you up against the window.”
All part of the plan.
Film night
Draco snatched it away and grimaced at it. Nothing. It felt dead. Empty. Just like Draco. After six weeks surrounded by Dementors, his magic no longer sparked a warmth in him. What was he supposed to do with this wand now?
“Getting home quickly was definitely an emergency. What a shit day. We tagged over forty
“You are just full of limes, aren’t you?”
“I’m getting a new pair. Those have been repaired too many times and it’s just time to replace them.” Harry set a shopping reminder on his phone for Monday and Tuesday both, just in case. “Time is ticking down! Ask me again on Wednesday.”
Understanding washed over Draco and he shook his head, “Pansy does that to me when I piss her off. She found the spell when we were, like, thirteen and I’ve never been able to counter it. Sort of afraid to, really, because then she’ll just find something worse. At least it’s a private torture.”
“I am! This just feels really… decadent?” Draco played with Harry’s top shirt button sheepishly, and then unbuttoned it to expose his neck a little more.

the ridiculous man he’d been fucking for seven months that this meant more than a casual shag to Draco too.
“Yeah, great. And… you? Will you be joining us?”
dead houseplant and it fit the mood.”
“For Saturday. And Sunday. But we can talk about that later,” Harry said quickly. Too quickly, making Draco narrow his eyes suspiciously. “I think you’ll like what I’ve got planned.”
Each punch packed a sharp electric jolt, but made Harry laugh anyway as he rolled away and got to his feet, gasping for breath. “Ron was watching the whole time! It was fine! And now it seems I owe you a life debt. I believe thirty days of service is the traditional method of repayment.”
“Let me go and get another box!” Amanda disappeared to a back room.
“I—I was at the Ministry this morning and while I was gone, they took Orion. The baby.”
Her face reddened and her body trembled. She shook her head. “No. We can’t.”
He sent the two boys to claim the first compartment behind the Prefects’ carriage, assuming it would be the safest spot on the train. Then he pulled another two trunks out. “Astoria and Evelyn.”
“Bloody fucking ever lasting hell!” Harry shouted as he got to his feet. Too many eyes turned to their end of the table but Harry didn’t care. “That’s what this was? All this time?”
“Bloody fucking… you didn’t
(10:53 pm) That’s good advice.
“You didn’t help?” Draco asked Ginny. His fingers crept from the chair to Harry’s shoulder,
“I always wanted to fuck around on this train.” Draco bit Harry’s lip and gave Harry’s cock a hard squeeze. “And this is my last chance. I’m almost there, love. Go faster… so good…”
Theo glanced at Jane, nodded, and got to work with Draco. Theo applied protective charms to their hands, and together they cleaned the wound and applied disinfectant alongside a silver wash that would seal the scratches.
“Sorry. I’m so fucking tired…”
“Let’s begin, shall we?” Mrs Stokke said, setting her quill to dictate. “As I understand it, Draco Malfoy has submitted the standard forms for opening a foster care home at Malfoy Manor and is pending approval. The DMLE, specifically the Auror department, has blocked his application for suspected Death Eater activity. Is this correct?” At several nods around the table, she turned to Ms Coddle. “We’ll begin with you, Commissioner Coddle.”
“NO! Send them to me anyway.” Draco stepped forward and toyed with one of Harry’s buttons. “But I couldn’t wait to see all of it.”
Annie beamed at him as she wriggled into his lap, forcing his chair back from his desk. “Those are flowers. The red ones in the garden. Can we go to the garden now?”
“Well if you’re over her, I’d say mission accomplished,” Draco said.
“I need you as hard as you can get! How is that not worth your while?”
Harry’s smile fell. He fastened his jeans and said sharply, “I saw you. In hot pink boy shorts. You were changing your robes.”
“And yet…”
“Now you’re stalling. It’s nothing special—just his mum. She writes him all the time. Go now or he’s going to go to bed and you’ll miss your chance.
“It’s a healing potion. Broad spectrum kind of thing, but strong enough to counteract Draught of Living Death. They probably give it to kids coming from shady situations, as a general cure.”
“It’s easier to stay awake with someone else. And anyway, don’t you have training?”
The girl wiped a grimy hand across her face. “It’s just to get his arm fixed up. We won’t be staying.”
“I did.” Potter blew his nose loudly and vanished the handkerchief. Conjuring a new one of his own, he wiped his eyes clean. “I made up all sorts of stories about my parents coming to find me. That they hadn’t died in the car crash and it was all a misunderstanding.”
Draco poked at his roast beef and shook his head. “I knew she wouldn’t come.”
“It’s you - seeing you. And you’re watching me…”
to make friendly conversation.”
“Not quite.” He spun Harry around and quickly washed his back and over his arms. He took a little extra care with his arse for no good reason other than he liked to torture Harry. “Legs next.” Again, he lamented there was no helpful ledge to rest a foot on. But Harry managed to lift one leg, then the other, balancing precariously and bracing himself against the wall.
“Still, this hasn’t gone anywhere at all yet, but you think it might last forever?”
and said, “Do you agree with Slughorn that my clothing is a distraction?”
“Just in case my editor will allow it, I drew you as a dragon as well.” Harry flipped back a few pages. “Look, here he is sneezing.” The round, green dragon with blunted scales down his back had his face scrunched up and tiny tendrils of smoke and fire coming out of his nose.
“Malfoy! What are you doing here?” Potter pushed his glasses up his nose and eyed the child-sized robe in Draco’s arms.
Draco stuck his tongue out childishly and rubbed his sore side. And admitted to himself that the sting helped him stay awake. He couldn’t wait to greet his bed. To slide between fresh, cool cotton. Rest his head on the plump feather pillow. Melt into a weighted duvet that cuddled him in a cosy cocoon. Bliss.
Auror Blakely grunted. “Poor little Death Eater children…” he mumbled under his breath.
(3:20 pm) I’m not sure I should be illustrating *and* writing.
“I miss the wide array of shower heads we have.” No sitting out in the cold mist at their house!
Draco raised an eyebrow, “You know, they make sexy underpants for men.”
“I want that too.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and considered his nervous husband. And thought about the list thus far. “It’s bondage, isn’t it?”
Or he could save his revenge for tomorrow.
“Of course you were. We all were at some point.”
Why she couldn’t have owled that information to him, Draco didn’t bother asking. “Do I need to owl my solicitor?”
“It’s nice to see you having fun,” Potter said when the two of them were finally alone.
“You and
(12:19 pm) You made me spew tea everywhere!
It had taken a while for Draco to understand Harry didn’t know how to fill a space. He had few possessions and didn’t know how to arrange them to enjoy them as he should. His furniture, while functional, didn’t give the space the homey feel Harry craved.
“I’m here at the Minister’s request.”
Pansy, Daphne, and Astoria met them at the door, gasping when they saw Robbie lying limp in Draco’s arms. “Oh Merlin, what happened to him?”
“My mother would be horrified that there are crayon marks on the walls and random scratches and dents in the hardwood floors, but I appreciate the sentiment.”
--------
She raised her eyebrows with a
“I know. And I don’t know how I’m supposed to do this job with everyone in such awe of me. Blakely probably hates it more than I do. Every time someone asks for an autograph, he has to swallow the urge to hex them. And there’s… there’s never an end to the calls. Draco… you wouldn’t believe the awful, horrible shit one person can inflict on another.”
Draco’s thoughts began to leach away as Harry’s hands trailed over his skin. “Oh shit, for real? I thought I was hiding my lascivious nature rather well.”
“And you?”
Considering the long-term benefits, maybe this wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
In the bathroom, Harry was already in all his naked glory. Tanned, sculpted muscles. Tight arse and that gorgeous cock, which Harry was already working over. Impatience was his middle name. He grinned at Draco, holding his free hand in the spray of water waiting for the water to heat.
He hated to admit it, but abstinence helped. Draco still didn’t sleep at night, but he had a clearer head in the mornings for dealing with the day’s problems. Food was a near constant need. He arranged for a regular delivery from a shop in the village near the Manor of fruits, vegetables, bread, and cheese, but how long could they live off that?
Harry detected a slight hint of nervousness in his voice. Narcissa would be returning in two weeks to begin discussions of their betrothal contract and Draco didn’t hold out much hope that it would come to anything.
“I’m not sure my editor will run with a name like Draco, but it’s worth a try.” He hesitated a moment, unsure if he should continue. “I wasn’t sure about drawing a deer. I thought it might hurt but… it’s nice.” When Draco frowned in confusion, Harry said, “It’s my—It reminds me of my dad. The stag, you know. It’s still my patronus and it reminds me of him.”
For now, he’d enjoy the fun that landed in his lap. Literally. Draco pushed Harry to a bench and straddled his hips. “Tell me you want it,” Draco moaned, brushing his lips across Harry’s.
“Is that what you want?”
“I know,” Ron said with a grin, leading Harry out. “Because that’s how you roll and that’s how we got in this mess in the first place.”
book club?”
“Oh definitely.” She rolled her eyes. “Roxy’s interested in a sperm-egg sharing program between us. She’s always wanted a big family. But I think Draco wants to wait a few years, which suits us as well.”
She moved her dictation quill to a fresh scroll. “A final decision has been made in the case of Draco Malfoy versus the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Effective immediately, Malfoy Manor is granted full status as a foster care home in line with the Charity Commission guidelines. In addition to the annual inspection required by Charity Commissions, the Wizengamot is granting the Aurors two additional inspections per year, with a required twenty-four hour notice given to two members of the care home’s Board of Directors. Any new residents in the home, either children or adults, must be reported to the DMLE within twenty-four hours. A warrant for search or inspection of Malfoy Manor may be granted at that time.”
“I’m happy for me too. And a little embarrassed I didn’t notice on my own.” He gestured down at his unfamiliar body. “I just needed fresh eyes on the situation.”
got his arse kicked by a seven year old?”
with him. They weren’t thirteen anymore!
“You mean we can have Orion back?”
Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around his waist. “It was a beautiful home. But I like our cottage better. If only because we built it together.”
--------
“I’m going to get more robes,” Draco announced. “A variety of sizes. Something for everyone. Anyone need anything while I’m out?”
Draco agreed wholeheartedly. He’d had enough of portraits yelling at him in his youth to last a lifetime. Why didn’t anyone ever animate his kinder ancestors? Or perhaps there were none of those to begin with.
“Is it?” Harry asked softly, leaning in a little.
As the lift doors opened, Draco quickly scanned the room, but didn’t see the familiar head of black hair. At the welcome desk sat a sour young wizard, already glaring at Draco.
Draco sighed. “The Aurors are circling closer every day. I’d hate to think what’ll happen if they find a spot to land. Which reminds me, I need to send an owl to my solicitor.”
“Not quite,” Harry said, amidst a flurry of hugs from Annie and Chester, “but I
But it would hurt and that was all Harry cared about. He happily tucked into his breakfast, basking in the proud smile Draco sent his way. Breakfast wasn’t perfect—two or three accidental jolts made his heart race painfully—but it gave Harry hope for future meals once they had a little more practice at staying apart.
Harry’s stomach chose that moment to rumble loudly. “Yeah, okay.” He clutched the terrycloth in his hands, bewildered and uncertain about where to go from here. Did Draco want more? He'd implied he did earlier, but maybe that was the heat of the moment. Maybe this weird little one-off was all Harry would get.
fancy you but it does fancy Hermione, which is a whole different sort of weird for me and I think I’d like to take you on a date.” He cleared his throat awkwardly. “You know, sometime when I’m in my own body again.”
enough to look accidental.
classes led by the Ministry,” Ms Coddle said with a frown.
Harry sighed in wonder. “Who are you and what did you do with my Draco?”
“They asked about your guests. How long they’d been there. Was it only children? Was I—was I ever worried for their safety or my own?”
My garlic bread falls to my plate uneaten as I get to my feet with an eager smile. “Why does this continue to work when you can have me anytime you want me?”
Harry kissed Draco’s fingertips. “So are you.” He hugged Draco closer and adjusted them so he could rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Want to nap with me?”
“I already miss our cosy bed.” Draco set his cardigan on an empty seat and began unbuttoning his robes. “On your knees then, Potter,” he said in an imperious voice.
“Let’s do a few more laps,” Harry suggested casually to Draco before he could dismount. “We could race? Best two out of three. Ron, want to referee?”
“You’re hogging the blanket and my toes are cold.”
Harry blamed the upcoming NEWTs for Draco’s distance, even though he knew it was the owl he received from Narcissa and refused to discuss. He tried to give Draco some space. Until he tried to turn Harry away for their usual Saturday evening.
(7:34 pm) This is the funniest thing that’s happened to me in forever.
(9:21 am) Flat planes the whole way in some lovely forest.
“We’ll talk tomorrow if the potion works.” He glanced back at Ron. “When you’re back to your usual self.”
Draco shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. Opening the basket he revealed—
My cock throbs in my pyjamas as he whispers, “Oh the wonderful things I can show you, my lovely…”
Andromeda sighed and picked the baby up, patting him on the back. His hair changed to a soft blue as he cooed.
Draco bit back a laugh. “As a matter of fact, my father
“Yes, of course. Right this way…”
Harry, however, was a nervous wreck. He kept darting glances between Ron and Draco and wringing his hands. Ron’s body looked ridiculous, with such mincing gestures. When Draco patted Ron on the arm and then made a few notes in the chart, Harry mouthed, “
Pursing his lips, Weasley disappeared into the back. He returned quickly with a packet of powder. “It’s three galleons.”
“My sister will find me there!”
Draco tensed at the sound of his name. Potter. Of
He curled up on the sofa with the throw blanket that his imagination told him smelled like Draco.
Until then, Harry enjoyed his quiet privacy with Draco. He loved the way their bodies entwined so perfectly, and the thrill of Draco’s hands travelling over his heated skin. He loved curling up with Draco afterwards and trading light kisses. He loved the even cadence of Draco’s voice as he told Harry silly stories that made them both laugh. He loved when Draco carded fingers through his hair and told him he was beautiful. He loved Draco playing his violin to calm Harry before bed.
to the
“Maybe you can see if someone is willing to come to the house to measure for school robes.”
That earned Harry a kiss on the cheek as Draco reached for a parchment of his own. “What is your favourite thing in our house?”
Automatically, Harry reached behind him, to where the shower shelf sat in their own shower. The one stocked with soft microfibre flannels and various bathing products, and a special water-resistant lubricant that frequently came in handy.
“Are you kidding me? Where even is that thing? How is anyone supposed to access it?”
“What do you think your animagus form would be?”
Orion slept under a colourful array of lights, with a tube running down his throat and another in his arm. Draco approached the bed, but didn’t want to risk breaking the spells by reaching through them.
“You deserve all of it and more.”
Harry smiled widely and got to his feet. “Sounds good.” He kissed Draco lightly. “This was a fun start, right?”
“This horrible lighting does nothing for my complexion. I miss the candlelight in our shower.”
Draco’s smile turned coy, “Assuming you’re worth a second date.”
Harry happily complied, moaning on each slick draw of his lips down Draco’s cock.
“You have lost your mind!” Draco whispered. “We can’t do anything here!”
Each night, Draco played his violin for Harry. He loved the soothing sound of it, and the peace it brought to mind. Although by the end of the holiday, it started heating his blood as he began associating it with the intimacy that always followed.
“This was fun,” Potter said when they’d finished for the day and the kids followed Pansy and Daphne to the dining room for dinner.
“You feel so fucking good inside me…”
“I don’t remember but one of my wines had cherries in it.” He collapsed on the bed when Draco pulled back the duvet.
Draco Malfoy.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at Potter’s teasing. “Maybe we can… Let’s re-evaluate in two weeks, when the results of the inspection come in.”
“Sex in front of a mirror.” Draco’s face scrunched up. “I’m not sure about that? We’re not exactly young and trim anymore.”
“I take it back now that they’re actually useful. I enlarged them to make a bed of sorts for us.” He tugged Draco close enough to the ‘ritual circle’ to be enclosed in the warm bubble of air. “What do you think? Want to get naked under the stars and declare our love physically to the heavens in a darkly homosexual way?”
how Potter was!
Pansy brushed that off. “Don’t worry, I’m
Daria nodded, pressing her face into Daphne’s hip.
“Sorry.” Harry shook out his wet hair, spraying Draco with more water. “Want to wash my hair?”
He trailed off, and Draco’s breath caught when an honest to goodness
Malfoy. In knickers. Bright pink ones.
The first batch was an utter failure they didn’t even get to finish. The second batch was much improved, but still not good enough to drink. The third batch turned out perfectly.
“I’m eighteen, not eight,” Draco said, putting on the ear-flap hat with a grin. “Aren’t you going overboard with the dragon theme?”
Harry and Theo followed behind but Narcissa must have cast another silencing spell that kept their conversation between the two of them. In the Entrance Hall, she gave him a brief hug goodbye, then left without glancing at Theo and Harry.
“Wait! Draco!”
His grin makes butterflies flutter in my stomach but it’s the way his fingers rifle through the popcorn that sets my blood running south.
“When do you think they’ll send word about your paperwork?” Potter asked, taking the chair closest to Draco. His legs splayed out in front of him so that his boot rested against Draco’s.
Between one breath and the next, a heavy sleep claimed him.
Harry rolled his eyes. “What a prick. Anyway… Today’s theme is
A cold breeze circled Harry. “What was that?” Exhausted and drained, he collapsed on the bed next to Draco.
“Just like on our honeymoon, hence…” He spread his hands over the food. “Remember wandering the French countryside and the random picnics we’d share under a brilliant blue sky?”
“I’m not going to Japan! And it’s not research.”
“What should we name our dogs?” Harry whispered.
“Oh love, you look just as delectable as you did on our first date.”
“I wish I could unbutton your shirt and kiss that dip in your collarbone.”
Daphne Greengrass smothered a shriek and turned to Draco with wild eyes. “Draco? Fucking Merlin! You scared the shit out of me.” She huffed a sigh and pressed a hand to her heart. “What a surprise to see you.” Her other hand clenched at her side, trying to hide the bulge of the apple in her pocket.
“Oh.” Draco’s heart constricted and he forced himself to breath as evenly as possible. “I didn’t see it this morning.” Maybe Harry had posted something else. Surely it didn’t mean what Draco thought it meant.
But it provided shelter and a soft bed for the night, and that made it sufficient.
“I got it from the library,” Harry said, holding it up so Draco could see. He didn’t want Theo knowing Draco had given him anything. “It’s called,
“They can’t stay here,” Pansy hissed.
friends, you can see why that might be worrisome.” Draco looked at the group of children. “Are we ready? To the ice cream shop!” Several of the children jumped and a few tried to clap their hands, making the rope jiggle and nearly unbalancing everyone. Draco grinned and nodded at Daphne. “Let’s go!”
Draco laughed so hard, tears gathered at the corners of his eyes as he yanked it from Harry’s hands and turned it all around. “Bloody fucking hell, where did you even find this? I thought we got rid of this ages ago!”
“At least while he heals,” Theo added. “After that… I don’t know.”
Draco summoned their newest book of erotic retellings of fairy tales and they settled themselves more comfortably together on the sofa. As he neared the end of the first story, Harry’s hand slipped under the waistband of Draco’s pyjama bottoms. He caressed Draco’s skin almost absently. Rather than arousing, he simply enjoyed testing the different textures Draco’s body offered.
“I love you more.”
. That was a lucky find.”
The wizard filed the waiver away and pulled out another form. “Yes sir, it encourages people to clean up their own spunk.”
I close the distance between us.
“My sisters, yes. But I learned not to condemn the entire tree for a few twisted branches. And I
“Harry! Fuck! Are you all right?” Draco’s hands clenched in the air above Harry’s shoulders, since he couldn’t actually grab hold of him. “Say something!”
A tidal wave of words looked like they might burst from Draco’s mouth, but instead he snatched the quill from Harry and hastily signed his name. Harry signed the parchment as well and offered him a small smile. “It’ll be all right,” he whispered, hoping to reassure Draco.
“You plan on housing families?”
Harry quickly followed in a shady haze of arousal and the green, murky light of the Slytherin common room. Panting and spent, he slumped against Draco and mumbled into his flushed, sweaty neck, “Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff next?”
“I’m fine! Don’t come in here!” Ron pressed his face to the door and drew in a deep breath. Slow exhale. The flimsy hospital gown hid absolutely nothing and he would
time. And on the spot like this, he couldn’t even remember the name of another plant. He sighed, “Okay yes, it was the orchid.”
A sweep of Mrs Stokke’s wand had all of them immobilised in place. “Why does it always come to this?” she sighed. “One day they’ll pass the wand ban for arbitration but until then…” She shook her head. “I’ll let you free, but if there’s another violent outburst from anyone, they will be banned from the room. Understood?” She allowed three seconds of silence before releasing them.
Ideas, both serious and ridiculous, started to fly amongst the gathered eighth years. It left them all feeling so lighthearted, that Lisa Turpin handed out two or three squares to everyone the next day and told them to write a few goals. She and Terry decorated a large bulletin board and encouraged everyone to post their five year goals — both serious and ridiculous — for everyone to see. That way they could work on them together. Encourage each other when needed. Heal from all the trauma of the last year.
Draco took a fortifying breath before lowering the wards on the door. For a second he considered closing the storeroom door behind him to make it all the harder for Harry to get out of the shop undetected. Merlin knew the sexy wanker deserved it.
Annie giggled, covering her mouth and doubled over. “Draco looks like a princess!”
All Harry could manage was a needy whine as his body ached for all that and more.
his entire hand, “that’s the only bit of me going into you.”
Potter.” Draco held out his hand and called the broom up, already walking away.
“Seeing as we are
, now can I?”
“I used to laugh at the silliness of it all. Who cares what sort of apples Harry Potter buys? It’s funny, right? But here they are,” he pushed the paper at Harry, “speculating that you didn’t want green apples because it reminded you of your Slytherin ex.”
Draco frowned at Harry’s confusion. “The life debt that I owe you. Thirty days of service. I told him I’m only on day thirteen and I can’t spend hours brewing if you ask me to—”
Always.
“You’re not?” Harry asked. “I thought you said your parents wanted you home.”
Utterly spent, Harry sagged against Draco and wished he could live in this suspended moment of warmth, arousal, and the soft press of Draco’s lips against his temple.
“Not quite. I turned mine into a portkey but I wanted you to wear yours too.” Harry wrapped Draco’s old Slytherin scarf loosely around his neck. “It fits the theme. Are you ready?”
Effortlessly I pick Simon up, growling when his legs wrap around my hips and his kiss turns decidedly filthy.
.” He laughed, but Harry heard the undertone of hurt.
“You got a bribe?” Ron asked. “What sort of bribe? I want in on the bribe action!”
Harry spelled the dinner dishes to clean themselves then turned to Draco with a smile. “Are you ready for our first fun activity?”
“The expense of this is outrageous for no reason.”
“Let’s go fly,” Draco said, getting to his feet.
Ron laughed. “See? I told you.”
He swept an armful of chocolate frogs into his basket, laughing giddily when several boxes bounced off the rim to the floor. “Frogs on the floor,” he sang to himself, then knelt to pick them up.
“Unsavoury homes… you mean Death Eater homes?” She laughed mirthlessly. “Oh Harry, you do know how to stretch the bonds of friendship.”
As much as Draco loved Harry getting himself off while sucking Draco’s cock, he couldn’t help but love Harry’s focused attention more. With his hands unoccupied, they could roam Draco’s skin, squeezing at his hips and skimming over his arse. And when Draco reached the edge, Harry gave Draco’s bollocks a hard squeeze that sent him over his peak, flooding come into Harry’s eager mouth.
Pansy gave him a horrified look when she saw all that he’d purchased. “You said a few odds and ends!”
“As it should be,” Harry said with mock solemnity, helping Draco out of his robes.
“They can look after themselves,” Draco said, forcing a patience he did not feel. The sooner they could get off the platform, the happier he would be. He wanted the Littles as far from the wizarding world as he could get them.
Draco threw his fork down. “I’m sorry, but I’m too worn out to eat and I still have some Charms work to finish before exams. I’ll see you tomorrow.” With arms wrapped around himself, Draco left the Great Hall.
“You’re not afraid of flying, are you?”
Their number quickly swelled from ten to eighteen by the end of June. The dizzying changes kept them from the alcoholic bliss Draco had come to depend on. He ran out of Calming Draught and didn’t know how to get more without alerting Pansy. Her mother’s addiction made her hyper aware of Draco’s dosing habits.
“You look pretty as a picture right now,” Harry said. “So smug and self-satisfied.”
Harry’s continued support and love had smoothed Draco’s ragged edges until they fitted together perfectly and he didn’t need to hide his words any longer.
Hermione frowned at him. “Of course we came. Even if no one is clear on what we are mourning.”
Other images began to cut across the memory—Harry’s romantic proposal, cutting the cake at their wedding reception, getting fitted for their wedding robes and laughing at the more outrageous fashion plates, leaving for their honeymoon—and then they were back at Blaise’s rooftop party.
Harry put his head under the spray, once again pushing Draco out of it and into the plastic wall of the shower. He smothered a shriek. “Be careful! These walls are freezing!” At home, the tiles were charmed to start warming when the water ran, so that one could comfortably rest if one was, say for example, being fucked into oblivion against the wall.
“You’re here again?” Draco spluttered as Potter rolled through the floo mere seconds after Theo left for his interview with the Charity Commissions. “It’s bright and early on a Monday morning—shouldn’t you be in auror training?”
“Drink this,” Draco said, handing Harry a cup of tea. “We could get a room for the afternoon, you know. Away from prying eyes.” He inclined his head at the rest of the Great Hall, with its scattering of students.
Pansy sighed, “You two are so sweet. I hope the day is a lovely one!”
“Right,” Sterling said absently, as if the fucker didn’t know that already. At least Potter and Weasley caught the odd interaction and would report it if anything happened.
ideas. Almost daily, Draco complained about being paired with Theo instead of Blaise. But Blaise found Neville far more easy going than his uptight Slytherin friends and refused to switch with either of them.
Malfoy leaned into him, his hot breath sending delicious shivers down Harry’s spine as he whispered, “Perhaps privately
Or was it just an extension of the commands Harry gave him? How could he ever know?
Harry didn’t have any defence left. “Yes,” he moaned, “Fuck, Draco, make me come. Just like that…”
“I think we need more brooms,” Draco said with a sigh as Jemma and Bryce began fighting over whose turn was next. Theo summoned the broom and had them flip a knut to see who went next. As Jemma sailed happily away, Draco arranged for Greg to take his place so he could head to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
“It’s stupid.”
“I’ll, er, walk you out,” Harry said, jumping to his feet. He followed them out to the carpark, feeling lighter than air. “This was… really good.”
Draco ran a soothing hand down his back, and up to scratch lightly at Harry’s scalp. “My dearest, you don’t have to worry about losing me anymore. I’m not leaving. Not ever. We’re legally and magically bound to one another and if you try to sever that, I will hunt you down and cut off each of your fingers and toes, one at a time.”
Supportive. Kind. Friendly. That was all that remained between them, now that the life debt had been paid. Harry could do this. He could be a good and supportive friend. He could let Draco go.
Every piece of Harry screamed at him to stop what was happening, to snatch the bag from Draco’s hand and unpack the full trunk waiting by the floo. But he knew he couldn’t. He couldn’t beg Draco to stay, knowing the internal conflict Draco was already undergoing. Draco didn’t like talking about the tug of war between the teachings of his childhood and his very grown up desires, but he felt it constantly just the same.
“Yes, Harry, yes,” Draco yelled as his hand flew over his cock. “Oh fuck,
“No,” Draco groaned, shaking his head roughly. Andromeda Apparated into the spot they’d just vacated, a squirming Teddy in her arms. “I mean yes, I’m fine.” He loosened his tie even more and smoothed his damp hair. “Last night was the full moon,” he whispered. “I was up all night, and then all this with Orion. I’ll be fine. I just need to collect him and get back home.”
This was based off a comic someone posted on the Drarry Discord. Again, I have no link and no way of finding it. Sorry to be so disorganised!
Now he saw his horrified face and it, too, was comical. He needed to practice some new facial expressions.
Jane whined on behalf of herself and Robbie. “We’re not going to
“This is the one that does that ghosting thing, right?”
Harry took Draco’s hand. Friends could hold hands to offer comfort. “I’ve done my best, Draco, to not push the limit too hard. I don’t want you feeling caught between me and them. But we have to admit we can’t continue on like this indefinitely.”
“Wait. What?” Nothing Draco said made any sense to Harry, but a feeling of impending dread turned all the food in his stomach to lead. It didn’t help that around them the other eighth years seemed to have caught on to something odd and were quieting down to listen.
As if on cue, a knock sounded. “Draco?” Claudia asked through the door. “Are you all right in there?”
“A new toy?” Draco asked, intrigued already. He untied the bow and tore the paper away to reveal a make your own dildo kit. He snorted loudly at the completely unexpected gift. “Is this real? We’re going to
“I wish that too,” Draco said. He smothered a laugh when Harry let the door go before Theo could fully walk through as well.
“When was the last time we even opened this thing?”
The Elf’s eyes widened almost comically. “Oh no, sir! Pickles can’t be a free Elf! No, no, no!” His eyes darted around the room, and Draco wondered if he might be looking to punish himself.
Harry, naked and almost painfully aroused, leaned forward as far as he could, straining against the sticking charm holding his knees to the floor. “Get over here and fuck me, you sadistic git!”
“Yes,
“This is our first time here,” Harry said, leaning on the tall counter.
of shame if Malfoy saw him now.

Confused, he glanced over her and finally noticed she’d removed her school shirt to reveal a strappy tank top thingy that probably had some specific girly name.
They set up makeshift beds in the small ballroom for anyone that needed company that night. Once Annie had fallen asleep and Draco could finally slip away, he had a short conference with Theo, Daphne, and Pansy. They included Alex and Jason, if only to calm them against any thoughts of revenge.
Harry laughed. “That’s just what Ron said. I think we can survive a few weeks.” Or work around the rules. Harry had plenty of practice with that. They’d be fine.
“I want to kiss you.” Harry gave him a peck on the lips. “I want you to snog me senseless.” His breath hitched at the soft glow of Draco’s eyes. “I want to pretend we didn’t fight a war and this happiness could have been mine all along.”
that story.
“Oh I don’t read as much as Harry does, but he passes on the really good ones.” He waggled his eyebrows playfully. “Perhaps he’s thinking we might have a real life friends-to-lo—”
“Oui, mon très cher amour…”
“Theo and I are quite talented potioneers. It’s possible we could brew Wolfsbane for—”
“Well…” Draco said reluctantly, not wanting to give in too easily, “since it means so much to you…”
,” Harry whined back, “and you said we’d have lots of hotel sex. Come on.” He stood and knocked Draco playfully on the knee. “Blow me in the shower and I’ll rim you 'til you cry.”
And as their cooling bodies drifted towards sleep, Harry heard Draco say, “It was a good first day.”
“Hopefully you won’t have time to get used to it.”
With a grin he agreed, “Any day now.”
“Right. What time are you usually up?”
--------
They briefly considered putting a bed in the spare room, but quickly decided they didn’t want any of their friends crashing for more than a night. They could handle the occasional kip on the sofa but a bed implied someone could become a third flatmate and neither of them were ready for that.
!” Draco clenched his fists. “Thank you, Mr Potter,” he said with stiff formality. “Our family is honoured by your consideration. I’ll send my parents an owl with your request, post haste.”
Mrs Stokke’s eyes, a slightly darker purple than her hair, widened in surprise. “Dromeda, I didn’t expect to see you here. I understood you were somewhat estranged from,” she paused briefly, her eyes darting to Draco, “this branch of your family.”
“O-oh, well,” Harry glanced at Ginny’s tightly drawn lips, and decided to follow Pansy’s lead. That was much safer than dwelling on a story he definitely didn’t want to tell. “You know, children experience loss too, so… Molly’s experience prepares them in some way. Plus, I had to throw out
“I know, babe—sorry, Hermione. Malfoy came to check on me earlier, because he’s familiar with Harry’s
“They were my parents’ rings.” At Draco’s surprised yet curious look Harry said, “Just the gold was. I had my mother’s two rings and my dad’s melted together and recast like this for us.” He didn’t mention the diamonds from the engagement ring and the cuff links he turned them into. He was saving those for a wedding day present.
(6:04 pm) Yeah? Is that weird?
“You look like a drowned rat, plonker.” Draco smiled anyway and gave Harry a kiss on the tip of his nose. “My drowned rat. Conditioner next.”
“Harry!” Hermione said loudly, patting her hair in its tight bun. “I got all dressed up for this!”
fooling around. I’d like to say I’d do anything you asked of me, but that would definitely be pushing it. I could never share you with someone else.”
“Yes. With a note,” he said, plucking a scroll from the blankets. He read aloud, “‘
Harry dug his wand from his bag and tapped the page. “
of sense.
“It’s just a name, Dromeda,” Potter went on. “You just need to sign a few papers and they’ll take care of the rest.”
“Draco!” he heard and jolted once again.
Pure lust shot through Harry as he stepped into the shower, closing the curtain behind him. Lightly he caressed the length of silicone, practically drooling at the thought of Draco fucking himself on it. He could easily picture it - Draco with his head tossed back, stroking his cock as he rocked back and forth.
Draco threw his hands up, “Well there’s a huge fucking surprise! So what, you’re just going to be here all the time?”
She followed Draco on a small tour of the rooms, marvelling at the toys and childish artwork everywhere. “Your mother placed great stock in all the trappings of wealth,” Andromeda said, her eyes scanning the parlour’s shelves, now empty of priceless heirlooms and breakable knick-knacks. “I wonder what she would think about this.”
Harry grabbed his bowl of folded up parchments and followed Draco to the sofa in the sitting room. Draco measured out half the vial into a shot glass and offered it to Harry. “Bottoms up!” They both drank, and Draco hummed in pleasure at the mildly sweet taste.
Theo was already leading Gretchen and Lizzie away. Greg waved to him from the house and gave him a thumbs up—hopefully that meant Robbie and Jane were out of sight. It was fine. Calm, cool, collected. Because everything was fine. Extended house party was the line and he’d follow it to the bitter end.
“You are a naughty boy,” Harry said, giving Draco a slap on the arse as he left. “Goodnight.”
more.
“Heads up for this evening,” Harry said. “You might want to tell whoever’s opening tomorrow that you’re probably going to be late. We’re going to eat shrivelfigs and stay up half the night with films and popcorn and you’re probably going to want to sleep that off.”
Draco clapped his hands loudly to dampen the budding momentum of sound. “I think it’s time for lunch!”
it. I marked the inventory sheet properly. As you said, it’s already mine.”
Draco stepped back with a wicked smile. “Good. Have fun in Defence!” He gave Harry a cheeky wave and a wink, then hurried off to Potions class, leaving Harry hard and wanting.
“I didn’t—” she said quickly, halting his footsteps. “I told them you were a good boy. Always kind. And…” She came around the counter and rested a hand on his forearm, right over his brand. It made him shiver, even if the touch was accidental and she didn’t know what it meant. “Draco, I told them that judging by the sheer amount of clothing, shoes, and toys you’ve purchased over the last few months… those children didn’t have anything at all. I—I don’t know what you’re caught up in, but I know you have good intentions.”
“Oi! Draco!” Greg hollered from his seat.
The unknown Auror turned to Auror Blakely, “You took off your uniforms?”
“Probably but I don’t care. No one says anything if I turn in something late.”
“Well I did a little research. Wanted to see why you’d do something like that,” Harry laughed nervously. “I ordered a few and liked it. So I bought more.”
Draco’s anxiety melted away as he switched to carer mode. He hugged Leila and then dragged Harry and Marrin into it too. “We’re going to be here for you. And for them. And we’re going to get through this together. I promise.”
Astoria took the younger girl’s hand and gently led her forward. “It’s all right,” Astoria said. “Better than last year.” Their textbook lists indicated the second years would be repeating a lot of their coursework from the previous year, and Draco hoped Evelyn managed with her new, borrowed wand. It hadn’t sent up as many sparks as David’s had, but it would serve until they could find something more permanent.
“I wish I could offer you my arm,” Harry said, opening the door for Draco.
“Mm… for me it was last week, when I was planning the mirror thing.”
Harry took the quill, still stammering and red-faced, “There won’t be… we’re not… like…”
Even the thought of watching someone else’s hands sliding down Harry’s chest and into his pants made Draco’s insides twist painfully. And he certainly didn’t crave the touch of anyone else for himself.
fucking textbooks!”
Draco’s offended face made Harry wish he could take back those words. “No, it’ll be our little secret.” He gave Harry a small smile, “Because I’m good at keeping secrets.” He paused, “Oh. Secrets. Is that what you thought I meant when you first asked me out? I honestly meant my—my office. You can still use it, if you want.”
“As long as we need to.”
He’s on all fours above me, a position I never would have taken as seductive. Not from him, at least.
“Yeah,” he agrees readily, “seems easiest.”
“They’ve managed this long,” Potter insisted. “Surely another few weeks while the paperwork is filed won’t make a difference.”
“I bought two pieces of pie but also couldn’t resist a sampling of other treats. Caramel macarons—how could I not, right?—chocolate cream puffs, cherry danishes, and baklava.”
“Is that what you want?” Draco asked hesitantly, his shoulders tensing up.
,” Theo grumbled, “so you could have chocolate. As if you don’t have a trunkful of chocolate in the castle!”
Harry remembered staying up eating take-away Chinese food, playing one recording after another, and laughing with the best friend he’d had since first year. And how Ginny never liked him working late on evenings and weekends, even when that put him in danger of missing a deadline. After all, she’d repeat, Harry had all day to get it done. Even though Harry explained writing and art didn’t work like that.
“I should have known this would go tits up,” Theo said, kicking his foot sullenly against the wall.
Draco’s smile fell as he looked more closely at her worn robes and the bags under her eyes. “Daphne, are you all right?”
“Draco!” Harry said with great relief when he saw his guest dusting himself off. “You’re here.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco pasted a cautious smile on his face. “Isn’t this a merry gathering. How can I help you?”
“Only one way to find out,” Harry said. “Open it up.”
Each wand had a small tag.
Draco wondered if the potion had gone wrong in some way. Surely Harry’s best day would include more than that?
“I should probably go,” Draco finally said into the silence, tugging on his shirt.
“Me too.”
“How about we call it a tie?” Draco rocked his hips seductively. “Surely we can think of a prize we can share?”
The adrenaline surged every higher and between one kiss and the next, Draco was spilling over Harry’s frantic fist. “Oh sweet Merlin, love, I’m coming at work.”
But he didn’t
Draco rolled his eyes with a fond smile. “Shower time?”
Draco pulled his knees to his chest, thinking fondly of his new, makeshift family. “But these kids… They’ve bonded like siblings and become so happy here in a carefree way I never could have managed as a child. And I wonder how they could have ended up like they did. How did their families take them in and see their smiles and laughter and just throw it all away like worthless rubbish?
“You’re doing the same, trying to hold all this together by yourself. Aren’t you supposed to be leaning on the others more?”
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “Is that so.” He pulled his jumper off, revealing a thin white t-shirt. “How about this?” He arched his back and made a kissy face. “Should I drink suggestively from the butterbeer bottle?”
“We’re never going to fuck in this bed, are we?” Baz whines, helping me to neaten my clothing before anyone finds us.
I’m treating shrivelfigs like coffee beans. So it can be considered as use of a stimulant but in a mild way. Also, there’s no way that by 2021 the wizarding world hasn’t embraced muggle technologies.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco groaned, squeezing hard at the base. “That feels so…”
? You burst into
“I want what you want.”
On and on it went, until Draco wanted to tear his hair out. What did any of this have to do with his application? After a short break, Draco had to evaluate inkblots and then solve a series of wooden brain teaser puzzles.
“Oh how you spoil me,” Draco said, rubbing his cheek against the scarf exactly as Harry wanted to.
“Fuck, please move faster so we can get out of this red and gold monstrosity,” Draco whined, shutting his eyes tight against the hideous
“Harry,” Draco tried again, but Harry couldn’t wait around to hear whatever he said.
“Can’t you do that during class? Hermione said you lot could organise your own potions, more-or-less.”
He set Annie on his hip with a grin and a kiss to her plump cheek. This was his life now, and he loved it.
when the meetings are held.” He pointed at the contract. “Look for yourself. As the one courting,
could flirt a little,” he said to Draco, cursing the heat sliding up his body that must mean his ears were reddening.
What a fucking circus. He kicked a stuffed narwhal and a wooden horse out of the centre of the corridor. “Someone needs to pick their shit up before it gets stepped on!” he yelled to the house at large.
Draco sighed and turned slowly. “What do you want?”
“I see nothing remotely sexy about any of this,” Harry insisted.
! We can’t just…”
“So is French the theme for today? Hardly seems kinky at all. I wonder what Blaise and Pansy will do. Her French is terrible and Blaise only knows Italian. I suppose they could go Italian instead.”
“We’ve been married for thirteen years, Harry. I’m pretty sure it won’t be luck.”
“Potter,” he said, restraining an eye roll. “I’d say it’s a surprise to see you, but it’s really not.”
“Erm, yes? Wouldn’t anyone want to play instead of work? We can work on essays this afternoon.”
Draco set the ridiculous toy by the side of the tub and pulled his pants off. “Fine, but it’s going up your arse.”
Two hours later, a young witch with sharp eyes and smart dress robes appeared at his door.
“Oh,” Draco said, perking up at this unexpected change. His face lit up at the chubby little deer with rounded, fat antlers. “I’m so adorable! Look at my tiny antlers!”
“Your hair is in my face.”
Harry’s eyes flew open. “What does it look like?” A creeping sense of shame turned his cheeks bright red. “Should I stop?”
Pansy and Daphne spelled two of the cellar storage rooms clean, and Draco and Greg furnished them with soft bedding that would likely be shredded by two werewolf pups. But on the off chance the potion worked, he wanted them to have somewhere comfortable to rest through the night.
They sipped at their drinks and made fun of the couples forming and reforming on the dance floor. It didn’t take long for them to unanimously and silently decide this was no longer their scene. Abandoning their mostly finished drinks at the bar, they exited the club for the quiet of the London streets.
Harry’s sparkling laugh lightened Draco’s heart. “I want to know what all the fuss is about when I pinch your nipples.”
“Hey!” Draco yelled at David, Elyon, and Samantha as they came coasting down the hallway. “Roller skates are to be kept on the second floor portrait gallery!”
want Harry. Do you want me to take my shirt off too?”
Harry shifted in the seat. The stretch and pull of his knickers gave him confidence to say, “Maybe… maybe coffee then. Sometime. Or—or dinner?”
Have a laugh for Valentine's day!
Even if it was just the usual gossip in the common room with their friends, Harry had a wonderful evening trying not to grin like a complete fool at Draco sharing an armchair with him. Draco draped his legs over Harry’s so they weren’t so squished and Harry got to rest his hand on Draco’s thigh. Every so often he’d give it a light squeeze and Draco would give him a little smile.
Harry had decided on first names for them, as tentative friendships broke out across House lines among the eighth years. A privilege Draco hadn’t been brave enough to take him up on just yet.
In all the years that he’d been brewing this specialty potion, Draco never once felt tempted to take it. He remembered well his first introduction to it in Slughorn’s class, and didn’t like thinking about what he wanted it for.
Harry waved one last good-bye then stepped back to give them room to Disapparate. He happily returned to the pub, mentally composing
Pansy surveyed the piles of school things they’d collected so far. “We need trunks for each of them. They can’t pack everything in their backpacks.”
Draco sighed up at the sky, wondering how he got so
“Mm, better,” Draco said, slouching down on the sofa so Harry could reach him easier. “Does this mean you’re done with the film?”
(7:30 pm) All at once. Rip the plaster right off.
of us at risk. This is a good time to remind you I don’t
The image that finally downloaded was of Harry’s side and the end of a dragon’s tail just above his hip bone. Or maybe a snake? A sea serpent? What else had a tail like that?
bath products and looked around the chocolate shop, overwhelmed by the possibilities of so many glass cases of chocolate truffles in all shapes and sizes. Another little treat for Draco, to pick out his very own collection of chocolates. And well he deserved it too! His eyelashes fluttered and he couldn’t help but gingerly touch the puffy skin around his eye.
Harry’s eyes widened in delighted surprise.
“This was fun. I’m sorry if I made things awkward at the end.”
Organising a game of quidditch on the Saturday after NEWTs was easy enough. All fourteen of the eighth years went out to the pitch and the ten that wanted to fly were divided into two teams. Draco and Harry played rival seekers, just like old times.
“Tomorrow.”
“I’ll stay until then. To keep Auror Blakely in line. But then… I’m taking a gap year.”
“Peel off these outer layers until you get to the dark purple centre. We’ll steep that for four minutes.”
Because that was what Draco was here for. Mr Whitehead went through question after question for over an hour, ranging from Draco’s cherished childhood memories to his thoughts on ethical harvesting of potions ingredients. He asked about anger management and Draco’s favourite book. Where did he get that smart muggle suit, and why didn’t muggles have flying cars yet? Perhaps wizards could help with that, yes?
Several heads turned at the mention of sprinkles, but Draco cut them off with, “Just plain cones for everyone.”
Daphne returned with fewer and fewer children, but word started to spread on its own about the safe haven at Malfoy Manor. One afternoon, they heard the chime of the Manor gates. With a confused shrug to Pansy, Draco hopped on a broom to fly to the end of the drive. He returned minutes later with a large wicker basket.
Relieved and exhausted, Draco managed to nap for two hours before Annie snuck away from her minders and poked him in the eye to wake him up for a morning walk.
Mentioning their silly list of his attributes made Harry’s cheeks redden even more. Yeah, all right he should have played along to get out of whatever inquisition resulted. He certainly didn’t want Ginny to find out he’d tried texting her number from memory and accidentally got Draco instead.
“It’s the list. Today is ‘angry sex.’”
It hovered right on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say something more. But he couldn’t use words like ‘love’ and ‘forever’ now, not with Draco so open and vulnerable. He didn’t want Draco thinking it was only sex that Harry loved. He would save it for later, when a different opportunity arose.
And what a long night it ended up being. Pansy, Theo, Daphne, and Greg each took a shift keeping watch over the dungeon stairs. Draco stayed with each of them, refusing to go to sleep or leave his post, despite having no wand to defend himself. They waited one hour after sunrise before going to check.
He took a little extra care to clean the flat that afternoon, and set the mood with candles and a dozen roses to decorate the dining room table. He picked up a special dinner for the two of them, and baked brownies for dessert.
Waiting, and waiting. Because of course the pipes weren’t magical and so the water didn’t come out at the perfect temperature already like it did at home. Draco crossed his arms and huffed the fringe from his eyes. He caught sight of himself in the large bathroom mirror and quickly turned his back on his reflection.
“Why not.”
“Then prepare yourself for loads of, ‘You like that?’”
“Harry… Do you know what this means?”
“You’re insane. What sort of service would you offer Ronald Weasley?”
He worried he’d be late to pick up Greg but it looked like they were just finishing as Draco arrived. Greg’s eyes bugged out when he saw the bags Draco carried, but Draco didn’t give him time to comment. He shoved half of them at Greg and smiled at Mr Whitehead. “Everything go all right, then?”
“Mm, all the better to ravish you, my dear.” Harry sat up and bared his teeth for Draco. “Pansy showed me the spell. Hers are significantly longer but I didn’t want to risk actually piercing your skin.”
“It was a good day twelve, wasn’t it?” Draco asked, hovering in Harry’s doorway for a kiss goodnight. They stepped aside to let Ron by.
“What was your dad hiding these up here for?”
“Mm… you…” Harry cupped Draco’s cheeks and gave him a smacking kiss.
“Well then you’ll just have to stay friends.”
“Not to mention,” Daphne added, “these kids don’t have trunks or school robes.”
“Mate, I’m no fool. I had to hide in the fucking bathroom because…” He gestured vaguely at his groin. “There was definite interest I was unprepared for.”
“Forget it. I can make do.”
Harry nodded decisively. “All right. Let’s do this.” He clapped his hands together and stared at the box.
“He pays me for it!”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and rubbed his back soothingly. “How can you possibly be complaining about
“They’re just doing their job—”
Draco blinked, and Potter was gone.
“Eight years? That’s oddly specific,” Granger said, flipping through the pages.
(11:00 am) Oh no, I made this weird, didn’t I?
Harry missed half the conversation but caught with alarm on Draco saying, “I think I still have that book in my room. You’re welcome to borrow it.” Harry had to dig his fingers into Draco’s waist to keep him getting up and revealing Harry’s predicament to everyone. Thankfully Draco settled back against his chest. “I’ll get it later though. I’m far too comfortable here.” He toasted Ron with his teacup and took a sip.
On Friday morning they showered together, but Harry preferred getting clean alone so after that, they used their separate bathrooms. They went to breakfast together, but the younger students didn’t bother them there. Over tea and scrambled eggs with toast, Draco liked to make a plan for the day.
His eyes strayed to the parchment — frustratingly unsigned — and he shrugged. “I haven’t really thought about it much.”
“That seems like a significantly less romantic first kiss.”
“And I’m not doing anything illegal.”
“That arse.” Draco shrugged unapologetically at Potter. “Sorry.”
They both laughed and Harry said, “My feet are so far away and I keep bumping into things. This is definitely one of my weirder moments.”
https://youtu.be/ovlH5u67xG4
Draco moaned and tried blinking into the water, a hopeless endeavour as the water sliced at his sensitive eyeball. He gargled and spat the water, trying to clean out his mouth. Then rinsed his cheek, but of course the come stuck to his skin like glue and had to be scrubbed with the scratchy flannel and even then he kept running a hand over his cheek to be sure he’d got it all off.
“I want to suck you off. Seems easiest.”
All of Harry’s breath left in a heavy whoosh. “I - what?”
It had been different then. Easier. With the summer sun setting, and not so many years on them yet. But Draco didn’t want to be a crack in the cauldron after Harry worked so hard to set up this special evening for them. And it felt like a nice
for Draco later. But he’d already had enough of this round of hotel sex. He’d rather re-do the rickety desk chair that fell over yesterday.
!” I exclaim with a horrible crack in the middle that turns my cheeks bright red.
They both looked down the table where Greg had the boys around him giggling into their ice cream cones, and Pansy shrieked as sticky hands reached for her. “Ugh, muggle places are the worst, Draco!” she grumbled as her napkin shredded against Daria’s damp palm.
“It’s a muggle thing. What use is that to us?”
“And maybe onto a broom of a different sort?” Harry asked, wriggling his hips.
The bulletin board was surprisingly not Hermione’s idea. During a late night common room discussion about their various Mind Healers, Terry Boot mentioned his own ‘homework’ of coming up with three goals for the new year, to keep him moving forward. Where did he want to be in one year? Five years? Ten years?
Draco’s breath left in a shuddering sigh. “It was mine. The pancakes, the dogs. The husband. But I didn’t sign my name because I was afraid of letting everyone know just yet.”
Harry stood too, and picked up the pot of floo powder. Friends could spend the night at one another’s homes, but only under certain circumstances like unsafe apparition conditions. But never when there was a risk of falling into bed together. Harry held the pot out. “I’ll see you soon?”
It didn’t help that Auror Blakely gave him an eager, ugly quirk of the lips. “As you are well aware, the Ministry is suspicious about the activities beyond your gates, Mr Malfoy. We’re here strictly as a precaution for Ms Coddle and her assistant.”
Draco pulled out his wand and summoned two brooms from the far end of the lawn where, not ten minutes ago, Evelyn, Bryce, and David had been laughing and racing. Now they were all inside, terrified of being taken away by Aurors.
“But you love me anyway. Want to help us set it up?”
With a groan of frustration, Harry set the books on the floor by his shoes. “This sucks.”
She sighed and flipped through the receipts. “Yes, I suppose. You’re impossible.”
And even more so when Draco cupped his own growing erection through his pyjama bottoms. “Go ahead, Harry,” Draco whispered, sounding every bit as enticing as Harry imagined he would. Slowly he reached out to drag his finger along Harry’s hip, along what could barely be considered the curve of his arse. “I can see that you want to.”
showing up in the paper—Harry suggested they go flying, now that the day had warmed up.
“Ow! Fuck, that smarts!” Draco yelled, rubbing his cheek with a grin.
“We’re going to brew Wolfsbane Potion before the next full moon.”
The overstuffed armchair barely had room for them both, but Draco couldn’t care when he had Harry in his lap, head thrown back and riding Draco with a slow pace meant to draw out their orgasms for as long as he possibly could.
And the hardest of all, sad reminders of their trauma —
I soak up the last of my spaghetti sauce with my last piece of garlic bread and say, “Yeah, well I’d do literally anything to get out of wearing any kind of costume.”
Anxiety and disgust swirled through him and he wanted to drown in it. Unfortunately, he knew he couldn’t stay hidden forever. His muscles grew tired and cramped and his brain wouldn’t shut the fuck up about all his failures and mistakes. The best he could do was sneak into the castle before Filch locked the doors, and then hide somewhere inside until the other eighth years had gone to sleep. Maybe a night of sleep would help in some mysterious way. If he could even manage it.
“What clothing drive?” Perhaps he should try another shop. His grip tightened on the hanger. Fuck shopping around. No one stocked as many childrens’ robes as Madam Malkins, and he had already almost reached his limit on exposure to strangers.
I have to pretend, in the dark of night, that he can’t see the slow, smooth motion of my hand on my cock.
“I might say no, just to fuck with the onlookers.”
“Your treat? Is that a belated ‘thank you’ for using my office as a napping spot all those months?”
“I should have used a stronger charm,” Harry said sardonically.
Draco’s heart clenched, knowing nowhere would be safe for them for a very long time. “At least there’s no risk of being thrown out on the streets. Even if the other Houses are suspicious or angry, at least you’ll have food, clothing, and shelter.”
“Ha! I won! Now it’s your turn to lose a sock!”
There was only one invitation because only one person was invited. But Harry well knew that if he invited Draco, then Theo would have to come along. And that if Blaise wrote out the invitation, his nosy arse would show up as well. And if Blaise came, then Neville would follow. And if Neville came, Ron and Hermione would as well.
“I want that too.”
Mrs Stokke spoke before Blakely could send Harry away. “It’s not unusual for Auror Trainees to observe these sorts of proceedings. But take note, Mr Potter, you are to remain silent.”
Pansy offered to take Orion upstairs for an afternoon nap. “Did I hear Potter say the others were invited back to Hogwarts?”
My words end on a high-pitched squeal, accompanied by a harsh tearing in my throat.
--------
Draco narrowed his eyes at her retreating form, wondering if she’d set up this little late night chat on purpose. Oh well, too late now. Draco sipped his hot chocolate and resigned himself to another hour of Potter’s company.
Draco poured a measure of Polyjuice potion into two mugs. “Are you sure about this?”
Draco leaned forward eagerly. “One month is traditional. Thirty days, to be exact.”
“I—but—the potion…”
Seeing as nothing outrageous or unexpected happened, Draco didn’t mind letting his hands wander down Harry’s chest and over his belly to tease the crease of his thigh. “You know… the day isn’t over yet.”
As he started to walk away, Potter grabbed his wrist. “Thank you. For listening. And for letting me… just be whatever.”
“N-no,” Harry stuttered, “I don’t mind.”
“What? Take the kids out for ice cream? No, never. And it was a huge enough hassle we probably won’t do it again. We much prefer ice cream parties at home where we can make messes and clean them up with magic. Where the kids can run and make noise and be themselves. Hiding ourselves is cumbersome.”
Ron squinted at the title. “
(7:37 pm) And eat the same dull thing for lunch every day.
“Would a pensieve be better, so we can watch it unfold together?”
But then, he loved anywhere with Draco.
could mean
“I always have fun with you.” Draco kissed the back of Harry’s head. His thoughts wandered around the day's events and briefly landed on Blaise and Pansy. “I wonder why Pansy chose vampires. Blaise is terrified of vampires.”
“Yeah?” Draco asked, his eyes shining with excitement. “What did you have in mind?”
“It was just a tiny fracture.”
“Day twelve is going to suck, with everyone coming back.”
Harry smiled. “I borrowed it from Alexandra and Marcus from
“Me too. I’m glad you’re up.” Harry gestured at the sleeping students. “I imagined everyone would be sleeping and I’d be eating alone.”
“Weasley,” Malfoy said, looking over the chart in his hand. “This is certainly a strange one. Potions accident during a raid on an illicit lab resulted in a body swap.” He looked up and gave Ron a half smile, which sent Ron’s (or rather Harry’s) heart beating faster. “Our lab identified several key ingredients and think an antidote can be ready in about twenty-four hours.”
Draco’s heart stuttered and he dropped the snobby attitude. He glanced out the darkened window and reached for Harry. “At home? In our bed?”
“Thrilled to be the one to burst your bubble, but it absolutely is. All those kids in there have one story or another about their parents imprisoned or disappearing, and the Ministry casting them out. They’re safe here and the Ministry will have them back over my dead body. Now get the fuck out and don’t come back.”
Harry’s fingertips flutter and the golden ball darts away.
“Right away, my dearest husband.”
“And happen to share a room,” Neville added.
“Damn, enough already, where’s the popcorn?”
Pansy cackled and pulled her phone from her pocket. “Unfortunately I’ve got work that weekend but...” She tapped rapidly at the screen. “Just in case, here...” Pansy handed the phone to Harry, displaying a ‘new contact’ screen. “Why don’t you put your number in for me? I don’t want to have to steal it from Draco later.”
“In my imagination, there are no predators. Next question.”
could get in. Pansy and Theo freed the room while Daphne took her off for a soothing glass of warm milk and some biscuits.
“What.” Draco’s hands dropped to his sides and blinked several times before scrunching up in confusion. “What is going on here?”
“Malfoy… please, I want to help.”
“Take your time.” Draco kissed Harry on the cheek and pulled a different book from his bag. At Harry’s raised eyebrow he said, “What? I didn’t know how long we’d be and I wanted to be prepared. I’ve also got two puzzle books and a deck of cards.”
“Good morning to you too,” Harry grumped. He sighed and pointed half-heartedly at his wand just to his right. “I don’t think I’m casting it right. Help me, please.” He handed the shoe to Draco. “Ron’s still in the shower so I couldn’t ask him.” Two spells later and Harry’s trainers unknotted themselves. “Thanks.” He shoved his feet in and used another spell to tie them up.
“This can’t be real,” Draco mumbled as Blaise shoved him into a chair to stop his pacing for the third time.
Closing the door behind them, Harry asked, “What do you even know about pureblood courting?”
“It’s sandalwood, but close enough.” Draco reached for his wand and switched their shirts with a spell. “Better now?”
Harry’s hand slid up Draco’s thigh, teasing the inner seam of his trousers. “And now?”
“No!” she whispered, wide-eyed and on the verge of laughing.
“Because it’s a dangerous, stupid idea. A concentration of children like that is just begging for attack. No one is going to be safe there. They’d be better off elsewhere. In other homes. Spread out so they aren’t such a target.”
Honestly, Harry couldn’t be bothered to care when Draco’s cock throbbed in Harry’s hand and his body welcomed Harry so perfectly.
“Today’s sexy thing is Invisibility Cloaks so I thought I’d surprise you with it and we can do something naughty here in your back room.”
“Here let me… Like this.” Draco held the base, keeping himself upright and still. A drop of pre-come pooled at the tip and Harry longed to lick it off.
“Of course I am. But what
Or they could talk about it at dinner that night.
Draco snorted in surprise. “I’m married.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry, but it was Ron who spoke first. “I’m just saying you could use more lemons in your life. Or, damn, even some limes to tide you over or something.”
Draco cleared his throat nervously. Were the younger ones likely to be taken away? Five eighteen year olds were hardly ideal guardians. “Erm… Of the twenty-five we have with us, twelve are below Hogwarts age.”
Blaise shrugged with a smirk. “You could have been
Draco tickled her until she shrieked with laughter. “Little Bit, you are one conniving witch. But very convincing!” He kissed the top of her head and set her on the floor. “I’ll look at these boring accounts later. Let’s hang up your garden, then go see the real thing.”
Draco shook it off first with a heated look, “So… my quarters or yours?”
“Oh no! You loved that orchid!”
“Yeah,” Potter whispered, head hanging in contrition. “I suppose you do.”
Pansy’s beer bottle slammed the table as she smothered a laugh. “Draco! You almost made me spit beer everywhere. That’d make a good first impression, wouldn’t it?” She wiped at her mouth with a tiny napkin, shaking her head.
“You’re going to have to propose again because I’m not telling my mum you begged me to marry you while I fucked you over our kitchen table.”
“We are gathered here today,” Harry went on in a solemn tone, “to mourn the loss of something very dear to exactly two of us.” Draco’s eyes met his and one platinum eyebrow went up in question. “Today marks the end of seventeen potential days of deviant debauchery.”
“Oh well…” He handed the third book to Harry. “That one’s ragingly homophobic but it’s the only one I’ve found with two men so…” He shrugged. “The owner of the life debt is
Pansy’s face crumpled and he pulled her into a hug. “You great fucking arsehole. You know I’m not leaving!” She sniffed against his t-shirt. “We can’t do this!”
“Harry!” Hermione yelled, startling him into sloshing some of his potion over the side of his cauldron.
from the pocket of his robe. “Did you see this week’s Potter Watch?”
Pansy made a dismissive sound. “Who even cares?” She leaned into Harry, resting a hand on his arm and focusing on him as though he was the only man in the pub. “Poor Molly. I felt so sorry for Mr Wiggles! What made you write such a sad story for her?”
He pulled his wallet slowly, avoiding Harry’s eyes. “I didn’t realise you were—You’re only ever in the papers with women.”
“Draco,” Potter said plainly, “how is this in
They celebrated the end of the Charity Commission evaluations on Friday with a large dinner that included Potter, Andromeda, and nearly six month old Teddy. Pickles and Dowdy kept the babies entertained in a play space in the corner of the dining room, while everyone else chatted noisily at the table.
“I don’t have chocolates purchased by my beau, now do I?” Draco simpered, batting his eyes at Harry.
Draco scoffed. “That is a game for small children.”
“Are you all right?” Draco asked, pulling Harry aside in the Entrance Hall.
Draco pulled away, avoiding eye contact and wiping at his nose and mouth with his sleeve. What a disgusting fucking mess he’d become in the last twenty-four hours. “Thank you,” he whispered, his voice raw in his own ears. “I don’t think we’d have found him without you.”
Someone shared a meme on discord of this guy dressing his dick up in little jumpers and scarves. It was hilarious. And then a friend drew a silly picture of Draco and Harry's dicks that was even more hilarious so then I wrote this. I'm sorry I don't have links to share, but it was before I thought of this project.
“I’m deadly serious. This is the problem with getting married between our birthdays. We don’t get to do fun stuff like this the rest of the year.”
“Of course you did.” Draco set his breakfast plate in the sink and leaned against the worktop. “I’ll make us a weak tea from
“Now I won’t be alone. Not if you’re coming out as well.”
While Harry tried to organise his thoughts around their whirlwind conversation, Ron came to sit next to him. “Looks like he said yes.”
What would his father think of him getting special treatment at a secondhand shop? And why the fuck did he keep thinking about his father? It was the anxiety he couldn’t shake. That itching on the back of his neck. He rubbed his neck, twisting his head side to side to ease the tension.
against his skin as Harry fucked him wildly. Right up until he realised it wasn’t jealousy.
With a defeated sigh, he scraped the mess into the rubbish bin. It was fine. He still had the chocolate sauce and ice cream. That would have to do. At least Draco was a little late and wouldn’t see him breaking down over failed brownies.
“You’re always welcome here.” And for once, Draco extended the invitation without rancor or irony.
Harry dug around in the bowl and unfolded the tiny parchment. “Which is better, sex in the morning or sex before bed?
“I thought we were dating! I thought you were my boyfriend! I thought I—” His words cut off with a cry of despair. He thought he loved Draco. But did he even really know Draco? Did Draco like the things they did or did he hate Harry for making him…
“Okay?” Harry threw a confused look at Draco, who rolled his eyes.
(5:57 pm) It might be nice having company tonight?
“Two of them are of age?”
Draco smiled. “How wonderful. I’ll take those.” He reached through the bars for the pile, but Auror Blakely pulled them back.
“I asked Pansy to come along so I wouldn’t be alone. But when I explained how we met, and the text you meant to send to your ex, and the way she strings you along, Pansy said —”
(6:10 pm) Not a reader of fanfic? That’s ok, I can explain.
and I did promise…” He threw Draco down on the bed and crawled up his naked body for a slow, deep kiss. “And I always keep my promises…”
“Go ahead and laugh. But you know it’s a good idea.” Draco bumped their shoulders together. “They’ll let you in the Aurors anytime you want. It doesn’t have to be now.”
While the saleswizard packaged it up for transport home, Draco arranged for payment from his Gringotts account. Potter hovered at the edges of his vision, his pair of gloves twisting in his hands.
“Professors Malfoy and Potter,” McGonagall’s stern voice cut in, making them spring apart, “I overlooked your little tour of the common rooms when the castle was empty but now that the students have returned, I must ask you to keep such activities in your quarters.”
When Draco dropped his last card in the centre pile, neither of them hesitated to slap the smaller discard deck. “Fucking hell!” Harry yelled, shaking his hand out as he got shocked yet again. “At least I got the pile this time.” He scooped up the cards and shuffled his set of cards for the next deal.
“These kids look to us for everything—food, clothing, shelter. I would have said anyone can give them that, but apparently some people begrudge them even the basics. As for love and attention… all of them missed out during these last few months and for some of them… It’s a critical age, you know? Without that love and support, they’ll only ever learn to hate and mistrust the world."
“Well we have school right now and I don’t have time for this!” Draco stomped off, hoping Potter would take the hint and roll right back through the floo.
Turning, Draco stuck his tongue out at Potter, then joined the others. Annie climbed into his lap with her face alight. “Did you get sprinkles on mine?”
“Mr Potter! What a nice surprise! Are you and Mr Malfoy back together? Enjoying a Saturday treat together? What sort of ice cream did you get? I’m partial to the pecan pie.”
“I had no idea I played such an important part in your big gay awakening. Hurts less to admit you were the same.”
“Mm, I certainly hope so,” Draco whispered back.
“No, I know that,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s fingers a little too hard. “Of course you won’t.”
No such luck. A quick knock and then the door opened on Draco Malfoy in ugly green Healer robes.
“Greg, Dowdy, and Pickles are with them now. In the larger ballroom.”
“Not in real life but they do in the novels and it’s always sexy. Makes me wish I was part Veela.”

Quietly Harry closed the door and found some clean clothes to wear. He splashed water on his face in the bathroom and brushed his teeth, trying to ignore the sandpaper feel of his eyelids. He reminded himself he had a pretty boy waiting on him. A
Harry swiped on his phone to google more animals. “Has to be real.”
Images quickly fluttered by, too fast for Draco to see, until they quieted around an image of Draco in royal blue robes. Oh how he’d loved those robes. They had a deep v-neck and then cut away below the three buttons to show off tight trousers in the same shade of blue. Silver embroidery along the sleeves and hems matched the silver shirt he paired it with. His younger, more trim self cut quite an impressive figure, if he did say so himself!
“Want me to lick it off?”
Ms Coddle’s back stiffened and her brows drew down. “I want to see where he’s sleeping. What sort of supplies you have for him. What is he eating?” She held out her hands with a smile for the baby, “Hello, little lovely. Will you let me hold you?”
Greg flipped him two fingers and followed the secretary to the conference room. Draco groaned, hoping that Greg had better manners for Mr Whitehead. And that he didn’t do anything stupid to jeopordise their position. He shouldn’t have listed Greg as a board member, but he felt guilty leaving him off for being a little thick. Greg meant well, so long as someone could point him in the right direction.
Ron gave an odd little laugh. “Right, Draco. So… erm… How are you doing these days? Working?” He looked a little panicked. Maybe Harry should have warned him first, but the coward’s way out had been easier.
He wiggles his arse against my spent cock and laughs, “I know, but next time…”
I have to pretend, as I hover on the edge of bliss, that I don’t want the taste of his lips to send me over.

where everyone at his end of the table, including Malfoy, could hear him. And he knew Malfoy heard him because he raised that one stupid eyebrow that always sent Harry’s heart cartwheeling around his chest.
“And what if he’s still here in a month for the next full moon?” Pansy shot back. “What if the girl is one too?”
“Me either.” A delightful blush cascaded over Harry’s cheeks. “I posted my Five Year thing and didn’t want anyone making a fuss about it at midnight.”
“My cheeks are bright red, aren’t they?”
“Good,” Draco said, hugging Harry ever tighter, “because I’m never letting you go.”
Draco snorted at the significantly
Thankful for her unexpected support, Draco answered honestly. “For many of them, various group homes
“Oh, is that for the clothing drive?”
“Yeah, okay. I understand.” Potter settled back in the chair, but kept their hands joined. “We’ll re-evaluate in eight years.”
(11:27 am) This is why I’m not good at meeting new people. My mouth always runs away from me.
Draco used to love inciting Harry’s jealousy back then. The possessive, biting kisses set Draco aflame, driven higher by the deep growls of
Maybe twelve weeks of chastity
“Hmm… Okay.” Harry climbed into bed, his mind racing with possibilities. “Okay. I’ll talk about it with Draco. See what he says.”
Gretchen and Lizzie eagerly dragged Harry to the newly furnished school rooms. Libby and Chester joined them at a tiny table with tiny chairs, and all four spoke over one another to tell Harry the plans to start school after the weekend.
“Of course. Please, come in.” Ron shot Harry a wide-eyed look, then quietly left the two of them alone.
stretched across his toned chest and shrugs, eating another spoonful of his cereal.
Theo turned a panicked look on the gathering of little girls. “I’m shaving my head like Greg tomorrow. Those girls are tiny terrors with those flowers! I don’t know what sort of sticking charm Pansy uses, but last time it took me three days to get all the petals out.”
Harry pointed behind him to the Ravenclaw changing rooms. “I’ve never snogged another guy before. What do you think?”
the damn fox was going to become
—outside of a ‘bookish’ setting.”
Harry dipped his finger into the cake batter Draco was mixing and got a smack on the hand for it.
Draco sighed, and then almost choked on it when Potter pulled him into a hug. He slapped Draco on the back then stepped back, a light flush on his cheeks.
As the questions were answered, Auror Blakely’s scowl deepened, while Potter and Granger took on contemplative looks. Draco took that as a very good sign. As Daria showed off the upstairs playroom, Draco summoned his baby wrap from the hook on the back of the door and tied Annie securely to his hip. She burrowed into his chest with a soft sigh, revelling in the contentment and security of being bound to Draco.
“You’re with me. It’ll be fine.”
Harry shook his head, still grinning. “This was loads of fun. I’m really glad my text went awry.”
“Really? All right.” Draco shrugged and led Harry back to the common room. They saw Theo at one of the tables, and Draco excused himself to go whisper something to him. Theo frowned at Harry, but then nodded. Draco took Harry by the hand. “Theo won’t bother us for a while.”
“All of them?” Draco asked, quirking his eyebrow just to make Harry grin. “You know I like it a little rougher than you do. Are you ready for that?”
To Ron, in Harry’s body, it just smelled like perfume. It didn’t have the same scent memories Ron’s body had. And he could tell by the look Harry sported that Ron’s body clearly remembered their anniversary weekend in Mallorca last month.
“Touch me,” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips.
“Hadn’t planned on it,” he murmured, sitting up to let me snuggle in behind him on the sofa, with eyes glued to his phone, “but my favourite author just posted a new thing.”
Pansy crossed her arms and rolled her eyes. “Fine. I guess I understand. It’s only another day or two.”
for children in need. I’m fucking starving!” Draco turned to run, but bravely because he was a Malfoy. “They sell them in Fortescue’s too,” he called as he rounded the corner. Let Potter search Diagon for chocolates. Draco only had a short time before the potion wore off and he’d better be home when that happened.
“Erm,” Draco said hesitantly. “You can’t sit there. That’s Annie’s seat, and she’s particular...” As he spoke, the wily little girl climbed into the chair with an angelic grin.
The murmuring picked up as the children dispersed. Draco’s friends gathered around, passing copies of the Hogwarts letters between them.
“I see.” She sighed and opened a small purse hanging from her wrist. “I’ve brought a courtship contract with me.”
“Maybe I should do it later. He looks busy with that letter…”
(12:13 pm) Ok good. That’s good to hear.
“Oh, right. It was the chocolate baklava. Sorry, but I ate both pieces,” Draco said without a single trace of remorse. “I’ll try to get you one for our second date.”
week so no, actually, I don’t.” Potter brushed soot off his jumper and smiled. “What’s for dinner here? Kreacher has Sundays off so it’s just leftovers at mine.”
The girl glared suspiciously but then sighed. “Robbie.”
“Daphne Greengrass?” She looked at her folder again. “You have her listed as one of your board members.”
“Yes. Here at our wrists. Or maybe our ankles? I don’t know if that would work but… Say our hands were locked together like this and we each only had one hand free…”
“I’m seventeen now! I shouldn’t have to go back!”
Harry ignored him and continued, “And I thought we could perform a little ritual of the homosexual variety…” Harry stood and whipped his jumper and t-shirt off. “In the back garden.”

The fifth trunk yielded a treasure of immeasurable value. A wooden box full of wands.
“Yes, anything you want.” Harry’s husky whisper sent a bolt of lust shooting through Draco.
“It’s not—I

“Have any of the children had negative experiences with Aurors?” Granger asked firmly and calmly.
pulsing and spreading through my whole body, just
“Duly noted.” Harry finished their shirts and handed one to Draco with a kiss on the cheek. “Lesson learned. So what now?”
After all their time together, Draco knew exactly how Harry liked to be touched and teased, but he hesitated this time. “You don’t want me to—to…”
“The ones you claimed were a waste of money?”
“Good enough to return the favour?” Harry asked with an uncharacteristically shy smile.
Lifting off from the ground didn’t terrify Draco as much as he thought it would. The wind rushing through his hair brought back some muscle memory. It helped that Harry’s body supported his, helping him to lean into turns and dips. Still, it had been ages since he’d flown and the speed of it was less exhilarating than he remembered.
Draco read his parchment and felt his face heating up. “When was the first time you wanked over me? Ugh… I think I’m going to hate this.”

“Are you sure?” Harry asked, already turning them into a careful descent.
“No…” he sighed and instantly Draco’s tension dropped. “I just miss you.”
anymore, but he swallowed the words at the last minute. No need to go making everything worse.
they were full. They were also given to family members that didn’t want them. Or that were unsavoury in various ways.” He tried not to roll his eyes when Blakely scoffed at that as well.
Harry stuck his tongue out, but of course Draco was still too far away to reach. But only just. Closer, closer…
Harry licked at his ice cream with a heavy sigh. Even creamy coconut ice cream couldn’t lift his spirits. Was his life really this dull before Draco? Sitting here, reading the stupid newspaper he hated. Wearing stupid, boring pants now that his knickers gave him a sour feeling.
Except for Draco’s last sock, just so they were clear on who won.
“Of course! Why wouldn’t I be?”
Two weeks later, they were a hefty group of twenty-eight children ranging from baby Orion and toddler Annie all the way up to Draco and his friends. They set up a schedule of chores to help Pickles and Dowdy get the Manor cleaned up and catch up on laundry. Several children were eager to learn to cook literally anything other than cold sandwiches and cheese toasties.
“It was sweet,” Harry agreed, winking at Draco. Draco returned the wink and then went back to his textbooks while Harry finished reading. Of course Annabelle and Charles had a little boy, a tiny mini-duke to continue running the empire. He hoped the other books were better. And sexier.
Harry had no choice but to pretend he didn’t care. He didn’t want Theo to have any more of Harry’s miseries to bask in, and he didn’t want Draco rubbing in Harry’s misjudgement about the courtship. Because it wasn’t a misjudgement. This would be good for them, which Draco would realise soon. Any day now.
His hand slowed then dropped to his hip with a soft moan. “Holy fuck, that was intense.”
“Erm, yeah.” Even though their end of the Great Hall remained empty, Harry leaned in to whisper, “I lied about the dogs. Really what I can’t stop thinking about is one of my t-shirts stretched across a broad, flat chest. I tried to imagine some pert, round breasts, but honestly that just doesn’t hold my attention nearly as well.”
Bracing himself carefully on either side of Draco’s hips, Harry leaned forward and let his lips hover where his fingers had been moments before. They tingled and buzzed as his tongue darted out to almost tease the head of Draco’s cock.
“I fucking love this flat,” Harry moaned.
Harry laughed and drew Draco in for soft kisses. His fingers trailed down Draco’s bare back, making him shiver in the very best way.
And then Potter promising to come back again to play tomorrow.
Harry sat in the other chair and nervously smoothed out his trousers. The chair squeaked a little every time he moved and he wondered why no one had bothered to fix it with a spell or two. “You look nice,” Harry said after a long minute of awkward silence.
Annie leaned back against Draco and the ice cream melting over her hand dripped onto his lap. She nodded, then turned her back on Potter to snuggle in deeper against Draco, smearing his shirt with ice cream.
to the bottom.
Harry rolled his eyes. How dare she disparage his work when he’d tried so hard with very little artistic skill to draw from! “We’re eighteen—nearly nineteen—Hermione! It’s two
“What? Why didn’t you lead with that?” Harry yelled, getting to his feet.
“Harry, my Harry,” he breathed, pressing their foreheads together. “I have so much to tell you.”
“It’ll be all right.”
“I mean it. Why would I want anyone else after knowing what it’s like to have you in my life? I’ve never loved anyone like I love you. And I know you know it.”
(12:15 pm) I’m doing an ABC book!
“I don’t know, all right?” Draco scrubbed his hair in frustration. “Is that what you want to hear? I don’t know what’s going to happen. But we have to go on, day by day, hoping for the best.”
Harry kicked off his trainers and sat cross-legged on Draco’s bed, watching him get the violin out of its case and set up his sheet music.
“Do you?” Harry began spreading jam on his toast with a slight tremor in his hand. Clearly he thought he’d said too much, and Draco didn’t want him embarrassed about it.
He snapped the box shut and shoved it in his pocket as he went to the kitchen for another cup of tea. Even if he didn’t drink it, the process of making it soothed his nerves. He almost dropped his mug when the floo flared to life.
