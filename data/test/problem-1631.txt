‘Thanks for the support, mate. I’ll remember you throwing me in front of the lions when I write my will.’ Ron mutters.
‘You can eat now.’ Draco doesn’t hesitate and fills his plate with all the glorious food. He eats as if his life depends on it, scared of Harry revoking his privilege to eat again. Harry sends him a knowing, lopsided gin.
‘So tight.’ The Counts voice turns into a loud groan as his thrusts become unsteady. With one last thrust the Count comes too, his face distorted in pleasure. After a moment of quiet, he tells Harry slightly out of breath: ‘That was bloody amazing.’ Harry grins, too dazed to reply. The Count pulls out his cock and leans in on Harry.
‘I take it you’ve talked to Harry, Draco?’ She emphasizes on the Draco part. I grin. This is one piece of work. Not knowing exactly how honest Harry has been, I deflect her question.
‘I’m gonna fiiiiiiind you.’ Harry circles the tree slowly, his fingertips tracing the bark. Draco follows his movements, as quiet as he can, keeping the tree between them. ‘Imagine what I could do to you. Hmm? Nobody’s here. No one can hear you scream. Nobody would believe you if you told them what I’m going to do.’
I open the door and find him in the exact same spot as I left him. His head is leaning against his knees, arms wrapped around them. He is crying in long, ugly sobs. The sounds tug at my heart. I can’t believe I’m doing this. I’m really doing this.
Harry watches as the man leaves. ‘Thank you, I think!’ he shouts.
Gin and I discussed this. She proposed staying with her brother for a while, but it somehow feels wrong to have Draco over in our home. Someday, but not yet.
Harry looks at him. ‘I said stop. Move away.’ He pushes him away, hard. The wizard falls on the ground. The crowd around him applaud and laugh as they continue their swaying to the music. When he looks back where the Count was, only the witch is left. Her red lipstick is smooched. She’s wearing a harlequin patterned mask similar in color to his, but there is a scale pattern where his is solid green. Relieved he starts pushing his way through the crowd, searching for the Count.
‘You like his, hmm?’
‘Oh, Precious. When you do the blushing thing it makes me want to devour you.’
As if Harry reads his thoughts, he asks: ‘Draco, you weren’t always this submissive. We used to have enormous power struggles. What happened? If, that is, you want to talk about it?’ The look of genuine interest and the lack of force makes Draco feel he can trust Harry. That, and the threat of plain sex, makes him decide.
As Harry bucks his hips up, Draco feels how far along he is. He shudders from the extra friction it causes. Harry grabs Draco’s arse and grinds his groin against Draco’s. Draco feels pleasure vibrate through his spine as he tilts his head back. Harry starts sucking his throat. ‘Oh gods, Draco. Gorgeous Draco, you’re going to be the death of me.’
‘Drapunzel, Drapunzel,
Harry makes his way back. He casts a wandless lumos. A small bulb of light floats in front of him, just clear enough to see his surroundings. Harry is glad to see it works even without his wand. A male singing voice comes from the tower. Harry freezes. The soft melody drifts towards him. Harry’s never known how clear and powerful Draco’s singing voice is. He mustn’t let it distract him, he decides, as he continues his path, the beautiful melody wraps around him like a blanket.
Something transitions in his gaze, as he tells me: ‘Make me.’
‘You keep surprising me. Why so considerate?’
‘By Merlin, you know! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!’ Draco raises his hands in a aggravated gesture.
‘Country residence.’ His voice comes out gruff.
‘Yes, Draco, it arouses me. Knowing you can take pain and discomfort. Knowing you’re turned on by force. It makes me want to fuck you right here, right now.’ Draco shifts, as something is growing in his pants. Shit, he is bonkers, to want this madness.
She pinches Draco’s cheek. ‘Such a lovely, clever boy as yourself should be able to get over your fears, right?’ She follows her husband into the elevator.
Draco feels his cheeks flush, but keeps his pace, eyes focused on Harry. He feels his release building up, balls tighten, a telltale sign he is very close. ‘I can’t hold back much longer, Harry.’ His heart is pounding so loudly, he thinks the table next to them is able to hear.
‘This turns you on, right? I haven’t forgotten.’ He releases my hands and lines up his cock with my hole. As he presses it in, I groan at the sensation. It has been so long anyone touched me there, I have trouble relaxing.
Draco moves even closer and Harry feels the press of his lips against his own. ‘In fairy tales this is usually where the prince’s vision returns.’ Harry tells him. ‘Maybe we should try again? See if it works?’ He smirks.
In which Harry declares his love and Ginny is content.
‘I... We... Draco...’
Reluctantly I break the kiss. Draco whines ‘Why? Just when I had so much fun.’
‘You’re so tight. So... Ah... So good. So tight. So... Ah.’ Grunting, Just Harry comes. Draco feels his strong arms tightening, his jaw clenching as he releases his spunk into Draco. ‘So perfect.’ Just Harry breathes in his ear. They don’t move for a while, Draco sitting on Harry’s lap in a tight embrace, panting and trying to recover a normal heartbeat. Sexy Arse and Boy Toy get up first, helping Draco up. They each give him a sloppy kiss, before laying him down gently on the carpet.
‘-Fair. I have to say, Precious Saviour, you’re doing a lovely Sarah yourself. But unlike Jareth I’m easily persuaded. Just think of a way to shut me up.’ His eyes move down deliberately to Harry’s lips and back up. A crooked smile tugs on his plush lips.
‘Hmm, especially in that dress.’ Harry licks his lips, feeling his cock stir again.
‘Faster, Harry, please.’ I stroke myself faster too.
‘God, so close.’ He moans. Harry stops. ‘Fuck you, Harry.’ Harry bares his teeth in a downright filthy grin. He keeps stroking and stopping, stroking and stopping, sometimes squeezing the head of Draco’s cock right before he comes. He keeps him on the brink of an orgasm. Draco thinks he’s never felt the urge to come this badly in his life. ‘Fuck, Har. I can’t take it anymore.’ He is a panting, shivering, sweaty mess, hair stuck to his forehead, arms sore from being tied above his head. He doesn’t give a shit. The need to come is all compassing, the adrenaline drowning out all discomfort.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Rude.’ The Count’s twinkling eyes tell Harry he doesn’t care at all.
‘No, I came out of that after Hogwarts.’ We grin, both remembering the fuss it caused when the Prophet found out my bisexual nature.
Did I tell you it’s difficult to live together with a bloody competent auror? Someone who’s heard every fucking excuse, defense and explanation? Someone who has seen every sodding crime there is to see and has developed a sixth sense for lying? Someone who’s still in Sherlock mode when he’s at his own freaking home?
Well, looks like he’s wrong. Harry is just the same as all the others. Too kind, too compassionate now he knows he’s damaged goods to give him what he needs. Suddenly a strange, bitter feeling takes control of him.
‘Uh-uh’, Harry hums, his mouth full of treacle tart. His eyes are closed while he savors the taste.
‘I... I’m not sure if I want it. What if it gets too much?’
‘DIDN’T I?’ Harry stomps both of his hands next to Draco’s head. Draco’s pulse races, he’s out of breath. This isn’t the easygoing Harry he knows. And it’s frightfully arousing.
Sorry, real short chapter today. More to come tomorrow!
‘Look at that beautiful body, lads’. Sexy Arse gently strokes his chest, tenderly brushing his nipples, nuzzling them with licks, kisses and soft bites. Boy Toy takes Draco’s now unbuttoned shirt off and starts caressing his back, kneading and stroking it, taking extra time for hard lumps in his muscles. Just Harry pets his hair and whispers sweet words in his ears, while nibbling at his earlobes and licking his ear shells.
‘You’d take them off.’ Draco’s posh voice wavers a bit.
We eat in silence. Harry seems to want to start speaking, but decides better of it. When we’ve finished the food, spelled our plates to the kitchen and warmed up some left over tea (mum would be so disappointed with me, if she knew her only daughter turned out such a terrible housewife), we start talking at the same time.
‘Draco, we’ve discussed our safe words. You can get out of every scenario you want with one word. The same goes for me. Safe wording out means an emergency brake. No questions asked. Just a full stop. We are clear about that, right?’ Draco nods.
‘If you keep doing this, Bellatrix will find us fucking and kill us off instantly.’ Harry’s voice comes out rough. Draco winks at him and makes his way downstairs.
Draco nods and Just Harry starts kneading his arse. Draco can’t stifle a moan when Just Harry’s thumb accidentally fumbles over his furled hole.
The rest of his sentence is muffled by Just Harry, who resumes kissing him. Sexy Arse replies: ‘Don’t worry, stud. It’s just really hot in here, and I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. So I thought you would feel better without your clothes on. But if you don’t want it, we’ll put them back on’.
‘Thanks, Dray! You’re the best! I’ll be right back!’ His whole face lights up as he takes  the Weaslette’s arm and walks away. I have to bite my lip to stop from crying as I watch him lean into her, whispering something in her ear, while she swats at his arm. Both are laughing loudly.
I pull back my cock and grab him by his armpits, knowing full well he’ll be sleeping within seconds from now. I apparate us straight into the bedroom. I lay him down gently and cast a few healing and cleaning charms on him and myself. He looks at me adoringly as I see his eyes flutter. Before I know it, he’s sleeping. I lie next to him and pull the duvet over us. I’m not able to sleep yet, as I never am after rough play. The adrenaline soars through me, keeping me awake, while Harry seems to need it to fall asleep. I stroke his hair and wonder what I did to deserve such a great lover and his even lovelier wife.
‘I want you to look at me when you come, Gin.’
Panting, they both take some time to steady their heart rate and even their breathing. Taking out his softening cock, he casts a wandless cleaning charm over them both.
The Count’s eyes grow wide as he splutters his coffee. ‘Wh-?’
‘Well, we could always ride the elevator back up if you want?’
They apparate in the alley next to the restaurant. Harry opens the door of the expensive Spanish restaurant for him. The waiter takes their coats. ‘Mr. Potter, it is good to see you again. We’ve prepared your favorite table. Will you two gentleman please follow me? Gracias.’
‘I wanted you to be different. I wanted you to be unlike the string of others.’ His hand shakes. Malfoy lowers the gun and runs his hand through his hair.
Harry swallows. He had wondered. ‘Yes.’ He nods.
Harry starts unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. Draco pushes him off, casting a quick scourgify on himself. Seeing the disappointment in Harry’s eyes, het tells him ‘I already came thrice, you know. Now it’s time for me to repay the service.’ Draco pushes him on the bed, tugging his trousers down for better access and casting a protection spell for safety. He gives him a proper blowjob, Harry’s moans as he sucks him off tell him it’s received well. He swallows every drop.
‘I hate them for doing this to you. For taking you without the right precautions, for not regarding your needs. For making you feel faulty, dirty and self conscious. Most of all I hate them for being the first to do this to you. It should’ve been me, I would’ve taken care of you, let you know how special you were after I had fucked you senseless. Your story arouses me.’ Draco’s eyes flutter open. What the bloody hell...?
‘Very good. We’ve already established I’m a man of my word. I want you to go to the loo and prepare yourself.’
Malfoy kneels behind him, opening his arse and lining up his cock. Careful, almost gentle, he pushes in. Bit by bit. Harry feels himself opening, his body trying to accommodate Malfoy’s hard prick. It’s overwhelming and it hurts. Malfoy’s strokes his hair and back.
She looks intensely at me. ‘Yes, I believe so too. Let’s talk to Harry about this.’ I nod and together we make our way down. I think we’re going to make someone bloody excited.
‘You too. I must’ve done something really nice to deserve you going full auror on me.’
I have to slow down rubbing my nub, because I’m so close and I don’t want to come before Harry. I need to stay aroused to be able to take his cock this deep in my throat.
We won’t let that happen. It will be hard at times, but I know we’ll try. Try our hardest. Because both of us want the same: to bring joy to this man that has already been through hardships unnumbered.
He does as he is told, putting his hands up in the air. The stranger picks it up. The recliner is in the shadows. Harry can’t make out the strangers face. Silence follows. Harry’ll be damned if he’s the first to break it.
‘Never mind, it’s a muggle thing. I would love to suck your cock to prevent a ticket for performing underage magic or whatever you’ll think of.’
Harry caresses his cock and fondles with his balls. ‘Fuck.’ Draco’s posh voice swears, emphasizing on the ‘k’. He feels a wet stripe being licked on his shaft, before his cock is engulfed in wetness. Did it just get too hot inside the office?
Sexy Arse’s hard-on brushes against Draco’s butt when he starts licking stripes on Draco’s back. Boy Toy undresses himself first, then he starts taking off Just Harry’s clothes too. Just Harry releases Draco’s lips to remove his own boxers and tosses them in a far corner.
‘You say that to all your playthings, I’m sure.’ Harry voices the doubt he’s had from the start. The Count has had so many fucks, he probably thinks this one mediocre. At best.
Draco’s eyes flutter around to check if anyone sees them. ‘Let them watch. It would be a crime to keep such a dirty boy all for myself’. Draco’s cheeks turn beet red, but he doesn’t remove his hand.
‘Count Flagler, would you please sit down?’ The small wizard sighs in exasperation. The Count is pacing up and down his dining room.
A twig cracks behind him. The sound reverberates in the eerie quiet forest. Harry swirls around, wand drawn.
Draco doesn’t.
Fuck, how does he do that? Just as Draco feels more collected, Harry finds a way to turn the tables again. He’s in full control. Draco thinks he’s never been so turned on in his life.
He feels the lips of Boy Toy on his back, pressing butterfly kisses everywhere. Sexy Arse has diverted his ministrations to his legs and is circling them with his fingers. Just Harry straddles him and tugs his hair as he fondling it, grinding his erection against Draco’s chest. Draco moans. Just Harry takes advantage of his open mouth and presses his tongue in. Draco lets out a squeak he hopes sounds indignant. Just Harry grins in their kiss, his eyes filled with lust and appreciation.
‘Dray’, her voice is seductive, making me look back in wonder, ‘Would you like to watch?’
I’m waiting restlessly, fidgeting with the hem of my sleeve. Get a grip of yourself, Har! You’re a big, bad auror for Merlin’s sake. Not some blubbering nervous schoolgirl. A thousand ‘What if’s’ sear through my mind. I’ve hurt Draco all those years ago. Why on earth should he want me back?
‘Yes.’ My voice comes out shakily. I can only look at the gag. What would it feel like to have one in my mouth? What if I can’t breathe?
In which Ginny realizes a few things.
‘Even more men die of gluttony, so with this food I’ll be long dead before the jealousy stands a change.’ Harry wiggles his eyebrows. Draco sniggers, as he starts grating the cheese. Harry makes his way over to Draco and tries to steal a strand of pasta from the bowl. Draco swats his hands away as he divides the pasta on two plates, grating extra cheese over it. He pours two Martini’s to go with it and floats the plates, over to the table. Both men dig in and eat silently for a while.
Looking in the mirror, he kind of likes what he sees. He looks more confident than he feels. Glancing at the big, cherry wood clock in his living, he sees it’s almost time. Harry fastens his mask and waits for the pull of the portkey, his foot tapping nervously.
‘Good morning, love’ Harry greets, as if no awkward conversation has happened yesterday. ‘Breakfast? I’ll whip up some omelettes, if you like?’
‘I hate what you’ve been through.’ Shite, pity is even worse. Draco knows he is deranged, he had enjoyed the rape, the overpowering and even some of the torture. He doesn’t want someone feeling sorry for him. Doesn’t deserve it. He had thought Harry, of all people, would understand. Would know what to do, would save him, would give him what he needs.
Draco groans, until Harry shifts his angle. ‘Yeah, there’ Draco manages to grunt as he sees spots of pleasure with every time Harry reaches his prostate.
Maybe Harry knows what he needs after all. Maybe he can help him heal what’s been broken. Suddenly the conversation about limits doesn’t look as appaling anymore. Harry kisses him once again. ‘You’re perfect, Draco Malfoy.’ Draco leans into Harry and closes his eyes. Harry wraps his arms around him and gently strokes his hair. For the first time in years Draco feels safe and loved. A small tear escapes the corner of his eye. Harry kisses it away as Draco feels himself getting drowsy.
He tries to sleep, but sleep won’t come. He’s dreading the next day, his heart heavy. Tomorrow, he has to let him go. A silent tear rolls over his cheek and splatters on his pillow.
‘You don’t mind, do you?’ Harry is talking to me. I think I zoned out a bit, because I’ve got no clue what he’s talking about. So I nod. Mistake! Harry’s smiles broadly, before thinking it through. He frowns.
Harry feels a cool, slippery substance on his entrance. Malfoy presses in his finger, nails retracted, gently pushing. The first finger is easy, as Harry is relaxed and needy from the rimming. Malfoy presses in his second finger. Harry moans. It hurts. He feels stretched to an uncomfortable level. Malfoy removes his fingers.
Just Harry gently grabs his arsecheeks. ‘Why are you doing that?’ Draco sounds suspicious.
‘What?!’
Don’t hate me! The tiny bit of angst I had planned got out of hand! I swear I just wanted to make Draco insecure about his body and scars, but our poor boy had other plans. To not make him feel too messed up, I added a bit of smoochy smut in the end.
‘You, for instance.’ He looks at me with that piercing auror stare, combined with a tightening jaw. No wonder his criminals always confessed. You want to when that stare is directed at you. Luckily I’ve known it for quite the years, so I’ve become rather immune to it.
‘So I thought about who would be the most unlikely partner for you. One with whom you could have crackling, kinky intercourse. And I came up with Malfoy. As if you would ever have steaming hot sex with him.’ I hear myself talking and suddenly know how stupid it sounds. Me, writing about Harry and his former arch nemesis. I feel so silly, I laugh a bit. Expecting Harry to laugh too, I look at him.
Servants with trays full of drinks and finger foods make their way through the room. Harry feels overwhelmed for a moment, watching the dancers on the floor, swirling around laughing. He sees masks of all kinds, horned ones, some with long, Venetian beaks, Phantom of the Opera styled and feathery ones. Rustling gowns leave shoulders bare and dive low between breasts, or have long sleeves and push up cleavages. Silk and satin shirts are worn, some buttoned up, some open to the waist. The trousers are tight and leave nothing to the imagination. Harry feels at loss for a moment, surrounded by such lush decadence.
‘Make it at least three fingers!’ Harry yells as he’s making his way to the toilets. He feels his blush spread up to his neck as he enters the stall.
‘That is different. When I hurt you intentionally, I know what I’m doing and know when I’ve gone too far. This time you need medical aid, okay? Your ankle wound looks severe.’
‘Oh yes, you featured every wank session I had since that day on the stairs. Thinking about all the filthy things I could do with that firm, round booty. Sometimes I had to toss twice to get rid of the image of your round perfectness.’ Harry’s voice is husky as he licks his lips.
The thought of Harry disciplining him does all things of things to his southern region. The opposite things senior auror Jones has in mind, he’s sure. He has to bite his lip to hold in a grin.
‘I’ll teach you!’ Draco replies enthusiastically. ‘You know Mary Jewry’s* mom was a Malfoy? So we got the recipe first hand.’
He sniggers. ‘How about being such a gorgeous wife? Who bears with me and takes all my irritating imperfections without too much complaining? Who burns my toast to absolute perfection and warms my heart and my cold tea?’
Harry gets up. ‘I could use a nice after sex shower, couldn’t you?’ Stark naked, he walks to his bathroom, his cock lazily swaying from side to side. ‘Coming?’
‘What have we here, ma’am? Another vial?’
Harry looks at me, eyes dark with lust and passion. He pushes himself up and lines up his cock with her cunt. ‘Like this, Draco?’
I nod, still not trusting my voice.
The bishop sleeves are wide, fuller at the bottom than at the top, gathered into a small cuff. He’s glad Dean has laid off on the ruffles and frills. The sleeves are gathered in a puff, right below his elbows. He buttons down the shirt, feeling the smooth metal of the buttons under his fingers. The soft linen hugs his body, Harry revels in it as he tucks the shirt in his trousers.
‘I’ll be there.
‘Green.’ He manages to tell him in a hoarse whisper. He feels Harry smile against his back. He also feels his cock swelling between his arsecheeks. He pushes his arse backwards, hoping Harry will take the hint. Harry slides in, his hole still open and slick from Harry’s come. Draco moans. ‘Yellow.’
‘Shall we keep on standing there, or will you let me in sometime tonight?’ Harry asks, cheeky grin forming on his handsome face.
‘We haven’t received a declination note, so your precious one will probably show up. NOW SIT. We have to go over the event one last time. We need you.’
A witch in a pink feathered mask leans in and kisses him on his cheek, her hand cupping his crotch. ‘Too bad you’re already matched with him.’ Her grin turns devilish. ‘I wouldn’t mind watching, though’, she says and tosses her head back in laughter as she walks away. He swallows. What is this party? Why are people watching him so intently? What do they know, he doesn’t?
He flings open his eyes, to see not one, but two Harry’s on the carpet as a third one enters through the door, wearing nothing but a lopsided grin.
In which Harry discovers Ginny’s online secrets, but Ginny finds out she’s not the only one harbouring a skeleton in her Potions cabinet.
Draco’s eyes are burning as he whirls around. I follow him and grab his wrist. ‘Draco, please listen to me.’ He shakes it off. I fall onto my knees in front of him. Me, Auror Potter, begging for forgiveness. How desperate I’ve become. I beg him to stay. Beg him to listen. But he stands there, looking like a bloody statue in a muggle fountain. Unrelenting, eyes cold, skin made of marble.
Besides, a few snogs aside, he’s only had sexual experience with Ginny. It’s scary to start this whole dating thing, knowing he feels rather inexperienced in the sexual area. At least at this party he’ll know the one with the same mask as he is compatible. That might make it easier to let some of his walls down.
I would love to hear what you are thinking so far!
Ouch. It’s really painful. As he looks down, he sees his ankle is twisted in an odd angle. So much for it being sprained. Broken, it is then. Sighing, he resigns and flops back down, waiting for the inevitable. A large part of him is looking forward to it.
‘Dray?’
‘We will use it tomorrow, to capture Bellatrix. But first, we sleep.’ Harry feels his eyes starting to close on their own. Draco yawns as he takes off his stockings and girdle. They get under the covers. Draco snuggles into Harry’s arms. ‘Might be my last change.’ He mutters. Harry’s not sure if he means the next day will be perilous or if he expects Harry to fuck-and-run. He hopes it’s neither, as he surrenders to his tiredness.
He glances at Harry. ‘The way I used to wank after our fights, almost running to the loo with want. The adrenaline that sizzled through my veins after our encounters. I knew then and there that violence and fighting turned me on beyond avail. What I didn’t know yet is that I like to be commandeered, but the fucking bastards made me find out.’ Draco exhales.
‘When I opened my assignment. I thought it would bring me fucking pleasure.’ Malfoy clarifies.
Draco struggles a bit to stay true to his innocent role, only to have Boy Toy holding him down. ‘Such a good pet’, Boy Toy tells him, ‘taking all those cocks. It wouldn’t be fair if you didn’t finish what you started, now would it? You owe all of us pleasure. Wiggling that lovely arse of yours in our faces all day. What would everyone think of you, knowing you tease all day but never finish? They would think you had it coming.’ Boy Toy begins tossing himself off. The power struggle seems to arouse him.
Bellatrix moves closer. ‘Something’s off this morning. I’d best alter your memories again.’ Bellatrix starts waving her wand. Harry jumps from behind the curtain, yelling a well aimed expelliarmus. Bella’s wand flies towards him, while Draco throws the curtain rod around her arms and waist and ties her up.
Panting, they sit next to each other on the floor. Draco’s hands search out Harry’s cock. Harry swats his hands away. ‘Not now. There’s no time.’ Seeing Draco’s disappointment, he adds: ‘I think those trousers deserve a proper dinner date, don’t you?’, His voice comes out croaky. Draco smirks at the thought of Harry being hoarse in all their meetings this week, him the only one knowing why. ‘I’ll pick you up at seven thirty.’ He casts a quick scourgify on the both of them, as Draco gets up too and dresses. Counterspelling the door, Harry leans in close and whispers ‘I’ll be fucking you right after dessert, so try to keep those pants clean until then’. He winks at Draco and walks out to get another mug of earl grey.
‘Malfoy, why are your teeth pointed?’ Harry swallows, already knowing the answer.
She trembles, her eyes rolling back, her nipples hardening. She moans both of our names as she shudders and comes. If I could get any harder, I would.
‘Still not doing it.’
‘Have you lost your fucking mind? I’m not going to get on my knees on this filthy restaurant floor!’ He almost yells. Haughtily he adds ‘You can do it yourself, just like me, or is the Boy Who Lived scared of the papers? I can image the headlines: How Boy Wanker Gets It Off.’ He sees Harry still, hand hovering over his fly. An ominous feeling creeps up Draco’s spine, he’s in trouble.
‘Nope, I just offered them your services after I’m done with you.’ Harry looks earnest. So earnest, Draco feels a pang of doubt. He wouldn’t, would he?
I push her away and get up, looking sternly at her. I’m using what Gin calls my ‘Head Auror Potter glare’. I notice her reaction to it. She shifts on the swing, eyes dark, small smirk on her lips. If I keep this stance up, she’ll be trembling with anticipation.
‘If you don’t show your face within five seconds, I’ll punish you.’
‘Ginny, what is this?’ Harry is standing at the table holding my brand new iWiz in his hands. I can hear the understated anger in his voice.
Harry starts fucking my face. He’s wild and sets a ferocious pace. He’s sweating and swearing. ‘By Merlin, woman, you are so gorgeous. I’m so fucking lucky to have you. Taking my cock so perfectly. Swallowing so fucking deep.’ Harry only swears when he’s incredible angry or incredible horny. This is the latter.
‘Anytime, mate.’
Draco glances around, no one seems interested in what’s happening at their table. Carefully he takes out his cock. ‘Good boy. Now start tossing.’
‘Is that why you keep on questioning me when we’re having sex? How it feels to come? Scrutinizing my cock as if you want to memorize how it looks? Suddenly deepthroating when you’ve never shown an interest in it before?’
‘Uh-uhm’ Draco manages to hum as he reluctantly swallows the excellent finger food.
Gradually, we both calm down. The crying subsides to tiny sobs. We’re both silent, save for the blubbering sounds we make every now and then. They sound awful. And somehow funny.
Letting go of his hands, Harry trails down and strokes Draco’s arse. He feels the slickness of an oil of sorts. His fingers feel Draco’s hole. ‘All open and ready for prince Harry, aren’t you a grateful little thing?’
‘You promise?’
‘Auror Potter! Not at all. One moment.’ The floo goes black for a second, before showing him the smiling face of Dean.
‘Fuck some sense in him. You wanna go first?’ They burst out in a fit of giggles.
‘I would love that.’
‘Hello, beauty.’ He leans in and presses his lips against Harry’s. Harry pushes him away.
‘I’ve got an idea, pet.’ Boy Toy flips Draco over, until he is on all fours. He gets on his knees in front of Draco. ‘If you suck like this, you won’t choke as much. Try it, pet.’
I stroke his hair, putting my hand in the nape of his neck. I could stand like this forever.
Harry crowds in and presses him flush against the tree. He bites his neck hard, using the moment Draco groans to force his tongue in. The kiss feels like a struggle. Harry grinds his hips against Draco’s. The friction is bloody fucktastic, Draco thinks as he tilts his head back, until it thumps the tree. He moans into Harry’s mouth.
‘Didn’t anyone tell you wandering into a magical forest with werewolves was a bad idea, Saviour boy?’ Malfoy’s face is so close, Harry can smell him. He smells earthy and musky.
‘Take your time, love. Take your time. Let’s get to bed. We can shower in the morning. Separately, if you want. For now, we’ll just sleep. ‘Kay?’
Sighing, Draco gets his quill and the requested report. He sits back at his desk and starts writing. Suddenly he feels something brush up his leg. He looks under the desk, but sees nothing. Shrugging it off, he starts to work. Suddenly he feels his legs being nudged apart.
‘I know. Me too.’ His looks seems scrutinizing.
‘Stop thinking’ Harry looks at him. Draco is taken aback by the fierce lust he sees in his eyes. His pupils are blown, a small slither of green is visible. Does he have this effect on Harry? Wow. Suddenly he feels fucking bold. Two can play this game, Harry, he thinks and decides to put up a good show.
‘Yes.’ Harry nods. ‘That was spectacular.’ He realizes he’s cuddling Malfoy. ‘I’m sorry. I don’t think you want cuddles. I don’t know what came over me.’ Hastily, he wants to move away, but Malfoy pulls him close and holds him there. The sheer force of his physical strength makes Harry feel safe. They sit together for a while. Harry has no idea how long. It feels as if time stands still. The forest isn’t quiet anymore. But it’s still cold and it isn’t long before Harry starts shivering. Malfoy get up and fetches their cloaks, covering Harry in his own before swooping him up like he’s a Phoenix feather.
I still.
Harry’s hand moves to his cock. He starts tugging it. ‘I won’t last long, Count’. He’s been aroused ever since he stepped into the ballroom. He won’t make it for another five minutes.
Not fair, Draco thinks. He has struggled for what feels like forever to stagger the few meters he has traveled. Harry crosses the distance in mere seconds. He puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder and swirls him around.
‘I hate to tell you, Malfoy, but I’m not very interested in comforting you right now.’
‘Suit yourself’, Harry chews on a piece of bread, a content sigh escaping his lips.
‘Hello Mother. How are you this morning?’
‘Dead serious. Luv, life is too short to be unhappy or to give a fucking shit what other people think. If you think Malfoy could make you happy, you should pursue him.’
‘Sure, no problem. You just hurry.’ He kisses her on the cheek as she makes a dash for the door, shrugging on her outer robes and grabbing an apple on the go. On her way out, she yells: ‘You should get her some flowers, Har! She loves those wild anemones. Thanks, you’re a dear!’ The door closes with a heavy thud. Harry sighs.
The table stays silent. Not knowing if he’s still there, he starts working again. His stomach flutters with anticipation. He feels his zip open and his cock being pulled out. He sucks in his breath and releases it shakily. What if someone enters?
Draco has to think of the quidditch manual being read by professor McGonagall to prevent coming in his pants, because the thought of Harry filling all his holes is suddenly overwhelming.
He hides behind a tree. Trying to control his breathing, he feels the sturdy tree behind his back, grounding him. He realizes he doesn’t hear anything anymore. Suddenly the suspension gets too much and Draco peeks around the tree. He sees a glimpse of Harry, back towards him. Harry seems to have heard something and swirls around. As stung by a bee, Draco retreats. Fuck.
‘None taken. I know I’m not the most generous person on earth.’
I get on my back, top of my head just a bit outside the bed so I can tilt it more easily. Harry straddles me and presses his cock in my mouth, using his hand to guide it in. Careful at first, but he knows I like it rough. His mouth forms a predatory grin when he grabs my hair and pushes me onto his cock. I relax my mouth and swallow him. Deep.
Harry unbuckles his belt and unzips his trousers. He opens his button and takes out his cock. It’s ridiculously hard already. Draco watches it wide-eyed.
‘There are wolves in this forest, laddie. You’d better watch yourself. This forest thrives on magical energy. Yours is strong, I can feel it. It makes you a desirable target.’ His smile crinkles at his eyes, while he is showing a row of uneven teeth, his face lighting up. He looks friendly.
Harry puts on his glasses and wraps his blanket tightly around himself. Speaking to Mrs. Malfoy is scary as it is, he’s gotten no desire to let her know he sleeps in the nude. ‘Mrs. Malfoy? Where did you get my floo address?’
‘Gin?’
We both know it’s not true. Now he’s started this, he can’t stop it. I don’t want him to stop it. ‘We’ll figure it out, luv.’
Suddenly he starts seeing white spots. The white spots turn into contours, that turn into real objects. Colors are seeping in as he feels his vision returning.
‘Let’s just say I have a thing for blond, haughty, posh, cocksure wankers. And yesterday you were two of my fantasies in one. Jareth wannabe.’
‘Je pense que j'ai eu un peu peur?’
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
‘If only we had more time. I’d bend you over and fuck that provocative arse of yours right here on my desk. Don’t think I didn’t notice your perfect tush yesterday, wriggling at my face. I had to use all my willpower to restrain myself from splitting you open right there and then.’
‘Ma’am, I’m just going to search you. No one is talking about any illegal potion just yet.’ She is already getting up from the seat. My mouth twitches slightly. So eager.
I know we’re both the same, him and I. We both want to see you happy. I am startled how well we get along. He’s wittier and kinder than I gave him credit for. I can see why you fell for him all these years ago. Even if his true character was buried under layers of prejudiced soil then. But you always were one to see the good in everyone, weren’t you, luv?
‘How did it go?’ I ask him, already knowing the answer. He laughs. I pat next to me. Harry sits himself down. We sit in silence for a while, watching the fireflies in the garden.
He nods. ‘Ginny and I already talked a lot about this. We both feel that, if you want it too, we should have a conversation together.’
‘I didn’t know you had so much wandless magic?’
In which Harry plays the criminal and Draco takes what he wants.
He frees himself of the ropes as if they were made of licorice and pushes me backwards. The unexpectedness makes me stumble and fall. ‘Stop right there, fucking ponce.’ I run after him, quickly tugging my cock back in my pants. He is gone.
‘Tut-tut’. Harry swats his hand away. ‘No touching.’
‘What happened with mapping my body until I was writhing and over sensitized?’ I ask him.
Harry looks sympathetic as he hands over a plate of hot, buttered toast with some wonderful looking marmelade on the side and a perfectly cooked egg. ‘Poor you. At least you’ll be home on time.’ His smile is full of sinful promise.
Harry’s heart feels like it’s hammering out of his body. He starts seeing white dots, as his breathing comes in small pants. He comes with a low moan, spurts of semen soiling his hands and stomach.
Harry lathers his fingers in lube and presses one finger in his arse. Gently bobbing it up and down, moaning at the impact. My movements might be restrained, but my cock sure as hell isn’t. And it’s already achingly erect.
Once cleaned and dry, he picks out a pair of beautiful, soft dark chocolate colored stockings. He attaches them to a gorgeous, chocolate and pink lace girdle. Gently, he bunches one stocking down to the toe. He points his toe and slips his foot in. Carefully, he pulls the smooth fabric up to his thighs. He repeats it with the other leg, tracing the lustrous, glossy fabric with his hands. He fastens the girdle, admiring how tightly it fits. His cock is slightly trapped. He decides against wearing panties. Prince Harry must have swift access. The thought makes him grin.
‘I feel guilty for having gotten off twice, while you’re still hard’ Draco doesn’t dare to look Harry in his eyes. He must be disappointed with him.
Feigning innocence I reply: ‘What are you talking about Harry?’
‘You need to see a mindhealer, Potter. This isn’t okay. I’ve never seen anyone not flinching when there was a gun held at their head. And trust me, I’ve got some fucking experience in the matter.’ Malfoy seems to suddenly realize what he’s supposed to do to Harry and grimaces. He grabs Harry’s chin and forces him to look at him.
Harry smiles wistfully. He wishes he shared Dean’s confidence. ‘If only, Dean.’
When Mispy leaves, Harry asks: ‘too cute, oi?’
Malfoy looks intensely at him.
‘No... oh no. Auror, I will do exactly what you ask of me. Please, no cuffs.’ Her lip trembles. I’m not sure if it’s from anticipation or played fear.
‘That is enough talking for now, ma’am.’ I’m switching to an even sterner voice. ‘Hands against the window pane, ma’am.’
Malfoy chuckles. ‘Yeah, you are definitely fucking different after all.’
The kiss is hot and aggressive. Malfoy’s hands pull Harry’s hair. It makes Harry groan into Malfoy’s mouth. He hasn’t felt anything like this in ages. Malfoy licks a stripe in his neck before getting up and opening his trousers. ‘I must bloody be out of my fucking mind.’ Malfoy mutters as he takes out his hard cock. Harry looks at him through hooded eyes. Malfoy’s pupils are so dilated, Harry can only see a slight sliver of grey. He’s sure he’s not doing better. Malfoy grabs his hair and feeds him his cock. Fuck, Harry thinks, he’d forgotten how arousing it was to taste another man. Malfoy thrusts in, not holding back. Harry chokes. Malfoy pulls back. ‘Sorry.’
Draco’s hand returns. He looks up at him expectantly. ‘Like this?’
He looks under the desk again. Nothing. ‘Fuck. I forgot about that bloody cloak.’
Draco looks at the omelette, drooling, and waits impatiently for Harry to make his move. Harry cleans up his plate with a crust of bread, and moves all the dishes to the kitchen sink. Harry crawls on the now empty table, laying flat on his back and spells the rest of the omelette on his stomach and cock. ‘You can eat now.’ He looks cheekily at Draco. ‘You’ll get dessert if you clean up your plate. Make sure you leave no crumbs behind.’ Harry pushes his hands behind his head and makes himself comfortable.
In which Harry tries to explain and Draco doesn’t listen.
Draco turns a deep shade of scarlet. This is worse than his initiation when joining the aurors. Why did he ever think this was a good idea? A sudden thud makes him jump. Harry has spelled the door shut and is casting a Muffliato and Imperturbable spell on it. Huh? Why?
He looks at me predatory. ‘Oh, but that’s not what I had in mind at all.’ His eyes are glistening with darkness. Whatever he’s got in store? It’s going to be fucking amazing.
‘Shame. And here I thought the Saviour of the whole wizarding world would get a kick out of all this attention.’ Harry’s eyes flick to the Count’s, expecting a sneer. But the Count looks at him with his amused, arrogant grin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sits up. ‘Harry’, Draco asks, and three voices reply in unison. Fuck. This won’t do. ‘All right, I’ll name you. All of you. You, get your naked butt over here.’ Very naked Harry makes his way over to the carpet. ‘You’re Sexy Arse.’
‘I really would like you to suck my cock. Have you ever done it before?’ Harry knows he shouldn’t ask, but he’s too aroused.
‘My, my. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you’re scared.’ He grins a toothy grin. ‘Are you? Scared, that is, Potter?’
Draco’s cock stirs at the prospect. He glances at Harry as he takes another bun and starts smearing the sticky cinnamon sugar deliberately around his mouth. Harry looks at him like he’s ready to devour him, a thoroughly filthy grin forming on his lips.
‘You’d take them off’, Draco mumbles.
‘I’m really fucking sorry.’ A tear slides down Malfoy’s cheek as he fires the gun. Harry’s eyes lock onto Malfoy’s, before his head feels like it’s exploding. He sinks into nothingness. He will never know how Malfoy gently tucks his hair behind his ears and presses a kiss onto it. ‘I’m so fucking sorry, Harry.’ He whispers as he expertly cleans the room before leaving.
‘Searching.’ I simply reply as I touch her tits, knead them and push them together. I slip my hands in her bra and search out her nipples. I stroke them until they are hard like cherry pits under my fingers.
‘What would you like, handsome? Want me to suck you off at the ministry? Want me to ready myself so you can use me as a plaything whenever you please? Want me to pretend I’m a teenage rent-boy? Let’s hear what you’ve got in store for me.’
Harry snorts. ‘Malfoys and their mob-like influence existed even then?’
Draco grins and drapes himself on the bed, legs spread widely, arms above his head. Harry kneels on the bed and starts massaging his smooth, stocking clad legs. He works his way up, sliding his hands over Draco’s thighs, carefully avoiding his hard-on, trailing the girdle up to his nipples. The little buds are peeking up just above the girdle, waiting to be tweaked. Harry casts a wandless lube spell and slicks Draco’s nipples before pinching them. Draco moans. Harry caresses the sore spots on his throat before making his way up. He covers Draco’s body with his own as he trails his arms with his hands. He weaves his fingers in Draco’s as he starts to grind against Draco’s erection. ‘Fuck, Harry.’
‘These patatas are otherworldly delicious. Too bad you’re not allowed to taste them.’ Harry deliberately licks the salt of his immorally endearing lips. He lets out a delighted groan.
Cautious to not wake Harry up, he slides out of bed and tiptoes to the door. The floorboards creak as he carefully distributes his weight on them. As silently as he can, he makes his way downstairs while buttoning his shirt.
‘Yes. No. Maybe. I... Let’s just get it in with, okay? Before I change my fucking mind.’
At the first sight of Jareth, he realizes that what he always thought was just the bad guy from a movie, actually was his very first crush on a male. By Merlin, his taste in males has always been like this. Arrogant, selfsure, blond badguys. Just like Malfoy. If Jareth was his first crush, Malfoy bloody hell was his second. He shakes his head, smiling to himself. He’d better not tell anyone this. Ever. He watches the movie unfold, finishing his food.
‘Hey luv!’ I wave at him brought the floo. He looks pleased. ‘How is it?’
I’m crying full speed now. Tears are splattering down my collar, soaking my shirt. I don’t care if anyone sees me. This song, it touches my soul.
‘You are so good to them, love. Look at them. They can’t believe you’re doing this. They are so close because of your perfect slutty hands moving over their pricks. But it isn’t fair. You’ve only gotten two hands, am I right?’ Draco can see where this is going, and he nods vigorously.
The Count grins. ‘After sex bliss? I tend to have that effect on people, I know.’
Draco frowns and thinks hard. ‘I don’t know. I don’t think so, but in my mind it feels like I have.’
Draco presses in even deeper, until he’s balls deep. We lie still for a while, both getting used to the feeling. Then he pulls back and looks up at me. There’s a sinful look in his eyes. A small, smug smirk plays on his lips.
The stranger looks up, his teeth flickering in the little light there is left in the clearing. Stormy grey eyes look piercingly at Harry.
‘Do you really now?’ Harry gives him a lopsided smile, saucy confidence written all over his face. Draco feels his cheeks redden as he stomps upwards, ignoring Harry’s now full fledged laughter.
The world feels like it’s falling down. Nothing matters anymore, but this man and me. My ears mute all the sounds around me, except for the song. He is killing me softly with his words. It must be magical somehow. He must sense my wish Harry would carry me home.
Silence ringing inside my head
Merlin fucking Hell. I feel my cock jump up at Harry’s words with an immodest speed. They guessed right, watching them is turning me on more than I ever imagined.
Him using my given name jolts me into action. ‘I... I want to talk to you, Draco. About.. us.’
Harry orders tapas for the both of them. Two waiters arrive with plates full of beautiful arranged, mouthwatering finger foods. Draco hasn’t eaten since the amazing blowjob he got this afternoon, the prospect of tonights events making him feel slightly nauseous. But now he smells the wonderful food, his stomach starts growling, angrily reminding him of its existence.
‘I... I think I was expecting it.’ As much as it pains me, this is what is was. At that time I didn’t feel I deserved happiness. I had done so many wrongs, I was a bully and a traitor. If Astoria and later Scorpius hadn’t found their way to me, who knows how I would’ve ended.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Dear Merlin, are you shy? The great Draco Malfoy, embarrassed to be nude?’ Harry grins. ‘I’ve already seen your cock, thrice, love. I think I can handle the rest of you.’
‘I think that’s what having a gun aimed at you does to a person, Malfoy.’
Okay, three short chapters today. I’m working on the Drarry smut and expect a new installment of a smutty quickie tomorrow! (Because, hey, if you’ve been randy for this long, you wouldn’t last for hours too, right?!)
‘You hate Marmite.’
‘Never.’

‘Gorgeous Drapunzel, I would very much like to take you to the bedroom. May I?’
Harry feels he should protest. Anyone can see him. But he finds he doesn’t give a flying fuck. He nods. The Count’s deft fingers don’t waste time as he unbuttons his shirt slowly but deliberately, opening it to his navel. The Count takes a step back and lets his gaze slide over his body. Harry feels exposed, conscious about his scars. His body is slender and toned, but he doesn’t have the six pack some other wizards have here. What will the Count think? What was hé thinking, giving his permission to undress? He wants to cover himself up, but the Count grabs his arms.
In which Auror Harry has some rather indecent interrogation techniques, but Ginny doesn’t complain (because it’s kind of hard to do with your mouth full).
‘I’m open to almost every kinky, dirty, strange scenario you want to try, but I also like a good, vanilla snog every now and then. I draw the line at borderline verbal and physical humiliation, fisting, strangulation, Imperious, Cruciatus, using animals, piss and poop. I’m clean, got my yearly checkup last month and only had protected sex afterwards. My safeword is Umbridge. Questions?’
Let down your hair,
In which Draco wants to talk and Harry tries to take it slow, both failing miserably at their resolutions in their haste to undress each other.
‘Hello, Drapunzel. I’m Prince Harry indeed. Will you show yourself?’
Sure, he thinks, why not? Let’s fill up this basket and get some damn anemones. It’s not like he’s got something better to do. After resigning from the aurors, Harry is in between jobs. A status that has been lasting for a full year now. He has no idea what to do with his life, but auroring wasn’t agreeing with him anymore. He woke up every single night in agony, feeling like he was never doing a good enough job. There was always something that could’ve gone better, new cases to solve, new people to save. He was just so tired of it all. Tired of saving the world. Tired of being in control.
At first he starts small. Wearing trousers that accentuate his assets, clinging at all the right places. Yep, reaction is imminent, as the ogling intensifies. Next step in the theory is wearing his pants of sex, as Pansy calls them, tailor made pantaloons in a darkish grey, that fit his firm arse like a second skin.
Draco’s treacherous body goes rigid, muscles clamping up, fists clenched next to his body. ‘Draco?’ Harry immediately senses there’s something off. ‘What’s the matter?’ He makes his way over to Draco, who has started trembling. ‘Is it all right if I hug you?’ Harry asks. Draco nods, his teeth are chattering. He feels the urge to throw up.
‘Oh, Malfoy. I ám an Auror, you do realize? And a rather good one, or so they say. Plus, I’ve watched you intently since you were 11. I recognize your movements even when you’re glamoured.’
‘No.’ I tell him simply, as I cross the room. I’m close to him, I can see the almost unnatural bright green of his pretty eyes, that are cast downward. Eyes that are swollen and bloodshot. I take his chin. ‘Look at me.’
Harry lets his prick fall out of his mouth. ‘Malfoy, I didn’t Muffliate without reason. You not making noise just won’t do. If you continue to hold back those lovely sounds that slip your mouth, I’ll be taking measures.’ He slides Draco’s cock between his lips, sucking him in deeper this time and releasing again. Draco lets out a content moan. ‘Damn, you’re good a this’.
‘You won’t lose me. I’m suggesting this, aren’t I? Now quit deflecting.’
Sexy Arse takes Draco’s boxers and tugs them down. Draco breaks the kiss with Just Harry. ‘What are you doing? I don’t want- hmmm.’
‘Keep looking at me.’ Harry’s voice comes out dangerously low.
Harry tuts. ‘Draco, Draco, Draco. As much as I enjoy myself, you’re not getting any fun if you don’t tell me what you want and where your limits are.’
‘With what are you agreeing exactly?’
‘Am I, now?’ Harry squeezes his bone. Draco feels the pain returning in an instant and grunts through gritted teeth. Harry looks at him darkly. Draco’s stomach flutters with want.
(See the end of the chapter for
I swallow. He’s still looking at me questioningly, his brow furrowed and his eyes earnest.
When I pull back, I tell her: ‘I am a decent auror ma’am. Nothing you can do will change my mind.’
Harry is silent. He looks at his hands. I see him struggling with something.
Harry leans in. ‘It hasn’t escaped our notice that you like watching us.’ Yes, true. But I wouldn’t mind pounding Potter myself now, not watching his gorgeous wife getting laid.
Opening his eyes he sees the Count’s amused smile. ‘You had quite the internal strugg-hmmhm’ Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It’s aim is a bit off, but the Count tilts his head down to move his lips in a better position.
‘No, you don’t understand.’ Harry blushes and averts his eyes. ‘I’ve... I’ve never been with a man.’ He waits for the Count to laugh, deride him, anything. What he doesn’t expect is the short intake of breath. Warily he looks back at the Count. He watches Harry with a predatory grin, his eyes filled with lust. Harry swallows.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘So eager. On all fours. Now.’ I get up a bit, wondering if he’ll fight me again. I hope not, because as arousing as it was, I really want to fuck him. Thankfully, he complies and turns around. I yank his trousers and boxers down in one pull. I hear him stifle a moan as I part his arse cheeks.
Draco flushes and hastily makes his way to the shower.
‘Don’t forget stubborn.’ Draco adds. We are silent for a while.
I swallow. My cock is hardening. Quite the performance, since we just had some bloody perfect sex an hour before.
I must look guilty, because Ginny rolls her eyes and says: ‘Men... Do all of you have the communication skills of a troll, or is it just you two? Maybe he should whack you in the head with a club and drag you into his fucking man cave by your hair. Maybe that way you would listen.’ She looks at me sternly and for the second time I wonder why she is really here.
‘You wish, Precious. You wish.’ The Count starts thrusting in earnest, using Harry’s thighs as leverage. It feels fucking fantastic. His head bumps against the pillows as the Count sets a steady pace. Some thrusts are even better than others. Harry has read about this, but never imagined how reality would feel. He moans every time the Count hits the right spot, unable to stop the noises he’s making.
I grin. Draco, eloquent as he is, sometimes finds it difficult to discuss a kink with me. It must be his stiff pureblood upbringing.
‘Try to stay in one piece until I split you open, would you?’ He growls as he presses me onto the bed. I shiver at the anticipation. Sex with a male is so different. Especially with one that is just as strong as I am.
‘No shit. Saviour Boy never had a proper fuck? Never had a cock so deep in his throat he choked?’ He hovers over Harry. ‘Never got penetrated so rough he saw stars?’ His posh voice makes Harry’s flagging cock jump up again at immodest speed.
‘I know’, Harry tightens his grip around Draco. His head nuzzles Draco’s neck. He breathes in his scent. He smells good. Safe. Feeling protected, he allows himself to doze off. Everything will be all right. He slips into a blissful sleep, his unconsciousness hearing Draco yelling at St. Mungo’s staff to get off their lazy arses and start saving the Saviour of the wizarding world. Yes, everything will be alright. He grins in his sleep.
‘You are much stronger than you look, beauty.’ Harry sees the Count behind the wizard. He’s kissing a witch, his hands cupping her arse. Fuck. He tries to see her mask, see if it’s the same as his. The Count’s eyes find Harry’s. He whispers something to the witch. Her head turns and she looks at Harry calculating, her tongue licking her upper lip slowly. Her mask seems the same. Fuck. She beat him to the Count. He tries to struggle free, but the wizard won’t let him go.
‘Goodmorning, Precious.’ The Count says, without turning.
‘Oh Dray’, Ginny tells me as she gets up, ‘what makes you think it was for one of us?’ She grins a rather toothy smile.
Harry pliantly opens his mouth. ‘Gods.’ Malfoys voice comes out hoarse as he pushes the gun in. Harry hollows his cheeks and sucks it in, eyes never leaving Malfoy’s. Malfoy groans and pulls out the gun. A trickle of spit slides off it. He lets the cool metal slide down from Harry’s chin to his throat, leaving a tingling cold trail. He rests the nuzzle at the top of Harry’s tight fitted black shirt. Harry swallows. Using the nuzzle, he whips open the top two buttons, sliding the gun inside. He caresses Harry’s chest with the silencer. Harry’s breath hitches as the cold metal of the nuzzle slides over his nipple, hardening it in an instant.
‘Oh yes, if you keep doing this, I’ll come so hard, you’ll be choking on my sperm.’ Draco whimpers. ‘Do you want that? You dirty, gorgeous thing? Do you want me to spoof up that lovely, tight throat of yours?’ Harry’s rough-edged voice becomes uneven, his breathing erratic. Draco wants him to come. He murmurs something around Harry’s cock, which makes Harry groan even louder. ‘Gonna come, so good, so good...’
The Count looks at him. ‘You didn’t like it?’ Harry grabs his hand and moves it to his rock hard prick. ‘Oh’. The Count smiles a hungry smile. ‘Want me to suck you off now?’
Harry leans in and whispers: ‘Just so you know, you looked so fucking beautiful. I almost came untouched from the sight of your mesmerizing toss-session. You are such a good boy, aren’t you? I can’t wait to bend you over and fuck that precious arse of yours. Gorgeous man.’ Draco feels high on praise, discomfort forgotten.
He opens the basket to uncover a luxurious lunch. A stasis-flask of perfect Orange Pekoe sits in the basket, next to a few thick slices of homemade bread, still slightly warm, a bowl of fresh strawberries and a bowl of Harry’s famous egg, humus and avocado salad. A package of assorted nuts and a small, rich, sinful dark chocolate bar are chucked in the side pockets. A note is on top.
The wizard closes in and licks a stripe on his cheek. Harry flinches. He might be single, but this really isn’t his way. ‘If you’re looking, I can give you pleasure beyond imagination.’
She sighs. ‘I know everything, Draco. He’s told me everything. How you fucked him thrice.’ I must look shocked, because she quickly supplements: ‘Not every intimate detail, Draco. He’s not a kiss-and-teller. But I know about your affair. About how he broke up with you when we got together. It must’ve hurt you.’
‘I... I’m not mad.’
To his surprise the Count laughs out loud. ‘Only you, Saviour. Only you. I’ll let you in on a little secret: this is just the place where I fuck.’ He emphasizes on the f, prolonging it. ‘Speaking of which.’ He captures Harry in his arms and kisses him. The Count takes off his jacket and opens his blouse, lips never leaving Harry. He takes of his boots and gestures Harry to do the same. Harry toes his shoes and socks off as quickly as he can. Harry whimpers when the Count deepens the kiss further and walks him backwards, to the bed. His hands slide over Harry’s arse and thighs.
‘Don’t.’ The Count grabs his hair and pulls him back towards his cock. ‘Try and cover your teeth with your lips when you suck.’
He sighs. He really should tell him tomorrow who he is. Will he be disgusted? Having shared his first same-sex encounter with hím, of all people? Or maybe he’ll be raving mad, threatening to go to the papers. Either way: he would never want to see him again, of that he’s sure. The Count swallows. Will he be able to cope with that?
‘So I tried out Sherlock. That was an improvement. People started reading my fics and commenting on them. It was great! I even got kudos. But Sherlock didn’t feel good to write. He is a rather... emotionally distant character. So I switched to the other fandom that has fangirls and fanboys of all ages.’ I’m silent.
Harry moans as he keeps on bobbing Draco’s head, pressing his length further in. Draco does his best to use his tongue, make it good for Harry, but he keeps on gagging, not able to take it in as deep as Harry seems to want him to. His tears well up as he feels useless. Harry stills. ‘Have you ever deep throated before, love?’ He asks.
Harry’s eyes travel downwards. Malfoy’s torso is naked under the cloak, he is only wearing a tight fitting jeans. His strong, muscular, toned body leaves Harry’s mouth dry. Malfoy is covered in scars. Harry notices his nails. ‘Damn, Malfoy. Why are your nails pointed?’
‘Molly isn’t feeling well, ever since she caught the Dragon pox. I think we should do something for her, don’t you agree?’
‘No fucking way!’ Draco blushes. ‘I’m so sorry. I have no idea where that came from. I seem to behave badly. Mother was right to punish me.’ A tear wells up in Draco’s eyes.
‘And then what? What do you fucking propose?’ Wow. Swearing and the nostril thing. I’m in for a good show. He raises his voice. ‘You and Malfoy, sharing me? Holding one sodding hand each? Cuddling in bed together? Or no, how about visiting rights? You and him discussing who will have me in the bloody weekends? Jotting the freaking times on the freaking calendar? Never showing him or you at a social event, because what the fuck would the people think? You having sex with me while his spunk is still seeping out of my bloody arse? What the fuck is wrong with you?’
Ginny pokes her head from the kitchen: ‘Don’t be bloody barmy, you two. I already know you fuck, so I think I won’t spontaneously combust into flames when you peck him on the lips.’ She disappears.
Malfoy’s eyes darken. ‘Be careful what you wish for, Saviour’ He puts the gun on Harry’s forehead. He doesn’t flinch. Malfoy swiftly moves the gun to the left and shoots it once. With a muffled thud the bullet impacts on Harry’s wall. He ejects the gun’s magazine in one fluid movement and tosses it onto the recliner. Malfoy rubs the gun over Harry’s lips. ‘Suck.’
‘Oh please, don’t. I’ll be good from now on.’ Draco mock-begs with a lopsided grin.
I hear the pop of apparating. A part of me is relieved she’s here. Gin will know what to do. The other part isn’t ready to face her yet.
‘I’m just checking in on you, Harry. Don’t you dare not go.’ Dean must’ve told his wife he was going to the ball. And somehow she knew he was doubting his attendance.
As if bitten by a snake, Harry pops the cock out of his mouth. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘Fuck, Draco. Is it really you?’ Harry pants.
Remembering Draco doesn’t know him, he plays along. ‘Don’t worry, dear. I am a friend.’
Slowly he starts moving, pushing in deeper with every thrust. Draco groans in discomfort. ‘Don’t worry, love. It will get better soon’. Harry pulls Draco’s hair, tilting his head upward a bit. His other hand grips his hip fiercely. ‘Look at you, you are such a precious thing, taking my cock so beautifully.’ Harry starts setting a pace.
Sighing I revert my eyes back on stage. ‘The Netherlands!’ Well, here goes nothing. They haven’t won since 1979 or something, so there will be no competition from them. The bookies are sure Arcade will win, but the bookies have been mistaken the last few years. I flip out my phone to tweet some nasty comments about this contestor, who obviously will never win the contest.
Ooh, ooh
Draco feels goose bumps all over him, the attention of three men is fucking incredible. Every part of him is being caressed, fondled and pampered.
The Count, Malfoy, lets out his wondrous laugh again. ‘Oh, Potter.’ He turns serious. ‘Aren’t you mad?’
‘As in the eighties movie? Ooooh, I’ll do glitter. Oh, and feathers.’
I watch as Harry tongues Ginny, and I find myself hard already. They’re not even fucking yet, I think, and I could come right here and now. I press my hand on my crotch as Harry licks down Ginny’s neck, sucking at her pulse points, before stopping at her breasts.
After breakfast, Harry makes his way over to the floo.
Sensing Draco’s discomfort, Harry laughs again. ‘You are so easy to ignite, love. Of course I used my fame. Whatever else have I got it for? Although, with a tush like that, you could effortlessly make some money on the side. Well, are you coming?’ Draco feels a bit giddy from the unorthodox compliment. Any other man would’ve gotten a proper blow between the eyes with a line like that, but Harry gets away with it, he contemplates as he follows.
When the tea arrives, the injury seems forgotten.
‘Mr. Malfoy.’ She replies, as she walks by. Suddenly, I hear a scream and turn around.
I lift her skirt up, baring her bottom. Her cunt is so wet, there’s moisture dripping between her legs. Slowly I slide my hand between her thighs, working my way up. The other hand finds her nipple again. She writhes underneath me. When my hand reaches her pleasure spot, I give it a teasing stroke before pressing my finger into her cunt to spread the lovely warm fluid that’s pooling there.
Effortless he places me onto the bed, never stopping his sloppy kisses. I cup his cheeks as I kiss back, letting my tongue flick over his lips. His hands travel down to my breasts, caressing my nipples. I feel my cunt getting wet in an instant. Who knew I still had fluids left after all that crying?
‘Good boy. Get yourself ready.’ He licks his lips appreciatively as Draco gets up, legs wobbly. Harry hands him a bottle of lube.
Harry takes out his cock through his already open fly. Draco looks wide eyed at the sheer size of it. Harry laughs as he puts on a condom and slicks his cock with the lube. ‘I will fill you up so nicely, you’ll be screaming for mercy and more at the same time’.
Sighing desperately, Draco replies: ‘I’m okay with preparing myself in the loo and have you bend me over the table to fuck me’ Draco lets the word roll out of his posh mouth, filthy and slow, emphasizing on the ‘k’.
‘Spread your legs, ma’am.’
Harry makes a new pot of tea and sits down, waiting for the oven to finish its baking. His mind wanders to the party for the umpteenth time. Would the Count really have eyes for him? There must be lots of people going for the first time. It’s probably just a coincidence. But it would be great, wouldn’t it? Like a fairytale. Harry imagines dancing with the Count, swirling the room, heads held up proudly. He smiles at himself. Romantic sap. Would he dare to kiss the Count? Would it be different from kissing a girl? Would he even dare to go further? He blushes when he thinks of all the things he’d like to try out.
‘I’ll make it good for you. Okay? I’m not completely inhuman.’ He strokes Harry’s chin and lets his hand trail down, to his nipple. He pinches it, making Harry close his eyes in pleasure. His other hand keeps twisting an scissoring inside of Harry. His tongue licks stripes onto Harry’s neck, sucking at his pressure points. Harry whimpers.
‘If we’re going to continue this lovely little adventure we’re having, we’re going to set some rules, okay? I need to know what you’re comfortable with and how I know you’ve had enough.’
‘Imagine how tight you’ll feel around my cock when I fuck you deep into this mattress.’ The Count licks a stripe from his neck to his nipple, biting it gently, while moving further down. He stops at Harry’s waistband, looking up through his mask. ‘Do you want me to suck you?’
Harry removes his glasses and slips the mask on his head, fastening its luxurious velvet ribbon in the nape of his neck, right under his messy bun. He is surprised to find himself see through it as if he’s wearing glasses. It must’ve got some intricate weaved in vision spellwork.
‘Would it be wrong to have a bit of fun?’ He can almost hear Ginny’s voice in his head. ‘Sweetheart, please. Go live a little. Have fun. Do it for me.’ He knows he’ll probably hate every second of it, but he has made up his mind. He’s going. At least he’s going to be incognito. Oh, that reminds him. He needs new clothes. His usual formal is attire too recognizable. He’ll floo Dean tomorrow.
‘Side-a-long.’ The Count apparates them into a gigantic bedroom. An enormous round bed stands in the middle, black silk sheets and soft, grey pillows on it. The ceiling is covered in mirrors. The cream colored carpet is soft and plush. There is a table and two fauteuils standing there, with a bottle of Champagne, two crystal glasses and some posh, luxurious chocolates.
‘Yes, I’m okay with it.’ He tells Harry through gritted teeth.
I chuckle. ‘Bollocks. It’s because I talked to Draco, right?’
‘Thank you for trusting me. I hope you understand the importance of safewords now?’
‘So fucking tight.’ The Count groans, his posh voice hoarse. ‘Such a glorious arse.’
‘Fics about us have no suspense. No crackling chemistry. No bad guys. Unless you count the ones where we’re eloping with one of my brothers.’
I cancel the cock ring spell and push my prick in her mouth. Man, the look of a woman (or man) putting her mouth around your cock, seeing it disappear inch by inch between her wet, soft lips. It’s the most fucking gorgeous thing you’ll ever see.
Malfoy hits him hard with the grip of the gun. Harry feels his jaw crunching as a bolt of pain shoots through him. ‘Fuck you, Potter.’ Malfoy grabs his hair and pulls him towards his face. Malfoy breathes in his ear. ‘I could do anything to you right now. I’d better watch that mouth if I were you.’
Harry raises his dark eyebrows. ‘Don’t.’
‘Don’t worry, I’m not a distressed damsel in need of our mighty Saviour Potter.’ Draco sneers as he feels an uncomfortable, unexplainable anger coming up.
An extra little bite of Harry and Draco, because I felt like it today :). The end is nearing, but I’ve got a few extra smut filled chapters in mind. I’ll put these up later as separate stories because of their triggers.
I pass one particularly large tree, and I hear him breathing. I know he’s perfectly capable of controlling his breaths when on a job, so he must be doing this on purpose. Is it a trap? Carefully I look behind the tree. He’s waiting for me, just as I expected, his hands behind his back.
Draco notices Harry doesn’t watch Ron or Hermione’s tush, or that of the ludicrously hot new guy from the owl-care service who just started working at the ministry. It seems only Draco’s plush little behind does it for Boy Wonder. Slytherin to the bone, Draco decides to test his theory.
I laugh. ‘Aren’t you and your big cock forgetting something?’
‘Oh, don’t hold back now, oh grand Savior Prince of mine.’ He feels Draco smiling against his cock. ‘I do like to swallow.’ Expertly, he greedily sucks Harry’s cock in again. That’s it. Harry’s vision turns blurry and he comes with a low grunt. He empties himself in Draco’s throat, spurting his semen deep down. Draco swallowing it to the last drop must be one of the sexiest things Harry has ever seen. Draco wipes a trickle of spunk away with his thumb, and sucks it clean. He looks at Harry with a lopsided grin. ‘Hello Harry.’
