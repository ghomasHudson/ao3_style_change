Harry was the first to reach his climax, calling out Draco’s name, as the boy he called, held him and kissed his neck. When Draco followed, no name fell from his lips, to busy kissing him. When they finally came back from their high, they curled around one another, looking into each other’s eyes. “I love you,” they said. This time, it seemed that the room decided they could stay a bit, both resting in each other's arms. Though the light, which had been dimmed while they were dancing, turned back on brighter when it was nearing one in the morning. Though the boys wanted to fall asleep in each other’s arms, they knew they could not. Reluctantly they climbed out of the bed, Harry walking Draco to his common room, and Harry going back to his after a goodbye kiss.
Hermione and Draco had come together to devise a plan. Creating study groups with the eight years and Ginny and Luna. They combined everyone who had the same course, and together they all revised their exams. And when it was finally time to sit for them they all felt ready. There was a lot to get through and it was hard work, but when Harry walked out of his last NEWT exam he sighed happily, his arm slung around Ron’s shoulders with a happy smile.
The group around him nodded and spread out, most of them going up to their own rooms. Only Ron and Hermione stayed behind. “Harry,” Hermione started, “I hope you know what you are doing.” Harry nodded.
Narcissa is there on Saturday, and Draco´s made dinner for the three of them when his mother steps through the floo. The vinyl that played their first night is on again, the music loud enough so Draco can hear it over the stove. Harry is reading on the couch in the living room. He takes Narcissa´s coat and hangs it on the small hooks they´d placed in the hallway.
“Nah,” Charlie said, “not my thing, dating people. I tried back at Hogwarts, but figured I liked hanging out with dragons more than dating people, or sex for that matter.”
“That means you passed all your classes!” Draco said excitedly, “you can officially become Remus’ apprentice!” Harry nodded, looking up to Sirius and Remus at the tables. They were both looking at him, and even though they looked nervous they also seemed confident in Harry.
“One can be suggested to the House, they would vote on it, if they had the majority, the minister would have to agree as well,” Neville said, “though, this hasn’t happened in ages. When that happens a ceremony would take place, giving them the title Lord and or Lady.”
‟It seems like you´re in good health,” he says with a smile, ‟the heartbeat is strong, and your nutrients are on good levels. Are there any side effects you´ve been having?”
“I really missed flying really.” Harry said to Ron, “I was never a fan of apparating but after last year I hope I won't have to do it all too much.”
“Yeah,” Remus said, “we’ll try, but I think Molly will be hard to convince.” Harry understood, but he needed to find a way to at least talk to them. Did they really want to go with him?
Harry wasn’t the least bit impressed. However he had no idea how he was going to talk, so instead of opening his mouth he choose to open the whiskey and fill both glasses with the drink. He gave picked one up and slid the other over to Malfoy.
“So,” Sirius said, “you wanted to make breakfast?” Draco nodded, leaning against the counter taking a sip from his tea. “Kreacher,” Sirius called out, which caused the elf to appear. “Draco is going to make breakfast, can you get all the ingredients?” Kreacher turned around at the mention of Draco and looked at the boy with wonder.
“So,” Ron asked, “I won’t even talk about the whole assassination business now, but did you manage to get the Horcrux?” he asked.
“Yeah, because you always fake throwing up Ronald,” Hermione said. The boys snickered, it was indeed the reason. “Besides this is their home, they are free to do what they want here.”
‟You´re naming him Scorpius?” Ron asks the next morning, a frown on his face, ‟I thought you wanted James.”
Draco knew that in these kinds of days it was best for Harry if he could choose what happened. If he could decide. It was hard sometimes. Both boys were plagued by the war, though Harry more so than Draco. The death had taken a toll on the boy, and now that he had talked about it with McGonagall, the wounds were open more than normal. Draco’s mind was on helping Harry, something that helped him when he thought back to the pain he had felt while Harry was in the forest. Helping him meant Harry was alive to be helped.
“Does this mean that that ring, had the stone inside of it?” Hermione asked, “how didn’t they know that?”
Two weeks after the war a letter was sent out, Harry didn’t know who had all gotten them, but it was to a memorial to those who had died in the war. Harry, as the hero who had killed the monster, had obviously been invited as a special guest and had been asked to speak at the memorial.
With the others knowing about their relationship, it was easier to go on their dates. They didn’t have to hide away in the room of requirement, nor did they have to wait till night.
“Positively awful,” Narcissa answered. Her face was still a mask, as there were too many people around her for her to be relaxed. But Harry saw her eyes, where he could see delight. “Almost as shocked as the wizengamot when I spoke.”
Harry laughed, he lifted himself from the floor. There was no place on the bench, so he just dropped himself on Draco’s lap. The taller boy let out a grunt but wrapped his arms around Harry. “You really wanna know?” he asked. He would tell the truth, they had decided that they would do so if anyone asked about anything. Especially now that they had the okay from Kingsley.
Dumbledore told Harry, that Voldemort started to work for Borgin and Burkes after school, much to the dismay of many staff members, who thought he should have gone to the ministry. He told Harry that this was not where Voldemort wanted to be, how he wanted to become the DADA teacher, but that the current Headmaster at the time refused, thinking he was too young to start teaching. He told him that while working at the shop Riddle had to try and persuade people to give up their rare treasures. Which he was especially gifted in.
‟Have you two already decided on a name?” She asks sweetly, ‟calling it the baby seems so impersonal.”
“A letter,” Harry said, “written to me.” His voice broke when he said it. Draco inhaled sharply, his eyes focussing on the words on the envelope. Harry’s hands were trembling. He slowly opened the letter, only for it to fly up, and a voice to speak.
Draco’s was almost entirely the same only the colours were switched. Where Harry had been gold, there was silver and the other way around. Draco’s was black, though it seemed almost green in different lighting. The Churidar’s were switched, an off white for Draco and a black one for Harry.
The next day Harry wakes up happy, something that quickly turns into nervousness when he and the rest of his quidditch team move into the locker room. He gives a rousing speech about winning and defeating the Slytherins, and all his teammates seem proud and ready. Ron the most, though that might be from him thinking he had drunk Felix Felicis that morning. When they win, he looks at Draco, thinking how he would like to kiss him, but he can’t. It would have to wait.
“Hello Daphne,” he said, “how was your day?” He didn’t really know what to talk about with her. But he felt like it was always a good subject.
‟And loving my fiancé is not enough?” Draco asks, his father sneers, though it still looks graceful why he does. Harry wonders briefly if his children will be as graceful as Draco or as blunt as him.
The door opens and reveals Draco and Ginny next to each other. Harry holds back a laugh at seeing his ex and fiancé standing next to one another. Draco looks around the room his eyes immediately zeroing in on Harry. After that, his eyes travel to the Weasley matriarch.
“Let us take the suitcases upstairs,” Lucien said, not waiting till Draco and Harry had agreed before snipping his fingers. Draco felt the snake being removed from his neck as well. He knew Lucien must have put him in his terrarium, so he let it go.
“Of course I want you too,” Harry said, “I just thought I’d have talked to Sirius and Remus a few times before they’d agree.”
Harry laughed, “Yeah, maybe.” He laid down on his back again, “never expected my life to become this. To have a home, a husband, a family who loves me, and more friends than I can count,” he smiled. “In the end, they got what they wanted for me, in the end, I’m happy and I found my family. My childhood wasn’t what they wanted for me, but now, my life is even better than I could ever imagine.”
“I’m sorry, he what?” Draco said, “you are telling me the person that opened the chamber before our second year was Voldemort himself?”
They stood in front of one another. “Very second year, don’t you think?” Harry said. Draco laughed. The two bowed, turning around and standing. With both their knowledge of non-verbal spells it was only expected that the first spell would be nonverbal. Draco was the first. Before he even moved his wand Harry could feel Draco’s magic move in the pits of his stomach. Not knowing what kind of spell it would be, he threw up a Protego.
Harry felt shame prickle along his spine, he had forgotten about that, besides the one try, he did give he had mostly been focused on either Ron, school and helping Draco with the cabinet. “I, uh, have not.” He paused, “I asked Slughorn, but he did not give it to me, and would not let me speak further. He has done his best to not be alone with me after my first try.” He thought for a second, how could he explain that he forgot, “the only time I managed to speak with him was when Ron ingested the love potion. I wanted to broach the subject when Ron had gotten the counter potion for it, wanted to wait after he had drunk some Mead. But then,” Harry raised his hands.
Mrs Pomfrey walks in seconds after, spotting Harry quickly. She gives an exasperated sigh, ‟I´d hope I wouldn´t see you here this year, mister Potter. And we´ve been doing so well.”
“Yeah, Dumbledore said that the night he tried to kill me, something happened, which caused me and his mind to kind of mix? In a way? Basically, when he feels really strong emotions I can feel that.” Harry explained, “so that night I saw him, with Rowle, showing him his rage.”
“Now,” McGonagall said, breaking the silence, “this year we have three new teachers in our midst, though one of them has taught here before, and some may recognise him. As first I would like to introduce Remus Lupin, our returning Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He too will be the head of Gryffindor house this year.” There was a loud clapping from all those that had been taught by him before.
“Of course you know where the kitchen is” Draco answered with a roll of his eyes. “Well, let's go then.”
“It should be a pureblood teaching it, though,” Draco said, “you won’t be able to find someone who knows everything when they haven’t grown up with it.”
“I’m not certain yet,” Remus said, “I thought maybe we could try you two duelling once without the class, see how your magical cores react to it and all that. Is that okay with both of you?” They nodded, “thanks boys, that’s all.”
“Kreacher is here to serve,” said the elf, he bowed to Harry and Sirius, gave a small nod to Remus but ignoring anyone else.
Draco turned around in Harry’s arms, as the latter was not letting go. “Sirius, Remus, sorry to drop in so suddenly and so late at night,” he said. “Congratulations on the marriage bond, by the way, Harry told me you two had performed it together.” They both nodded, reaching out to each other’s hands.
“I’m Nymphedora Tonks, but you can call me cousin.” She smiled at the shocked look Draco gave her. “I’m the daughter of your mothers sister Andromeda.”
“Oh, right, that might’ve been it,” he said, “not like he really cared for me.” He just wanted me alive, until he saw it fit he died, Harry thought bitterly.
Inside the forest he stopped, removing the pouch from his neck. He pulled out the ring, putting it on. Might as well die with the ring on, won’t make much of a change. Then he pulled out the snitch.
“They’ll get a combination of our melted magic because our magic would be the new Malfoy magic. The rest of the family will still only have the magic that makes up the Malfoy magic now, but if we would take up new families, or adopt new people into the family, they will have our magic as the focus point.”
“Sure,” Ron said, “just another thing to look for.” He sighed, “but at least we know where it is. Better than any Horcrux.”
Ginny and Luna both pop in and out of the eight years common rooms whenever they want. They’ve been accepted as honorary eight years, with everything they have done during the war and all. Everyone is always happy to see them. They study together, they drink together on Friday's or Saturday’s.
Harry flushes but nods. ‟I´ll leave you to pack and unpack again,” she says. She turns before turning back again, ‟and boys, do be more careful in the future.”
Lupin and Sirius nodded, “well, I don’t like that you three are going to leave without any of us knowing what or where you guys are going,” Remus said, “but I trust Dumbledore, if he thinks you three can do it alone, we’ll accept it.”
Ron smiled hugging her as well.  When he sat down, she called the attention on himself again. “Thank you for being here with us to celebrate the graduation of these Hogwarts students. There are drinks in the courtyard!” With that, she left the podium and all the students started talking together. Harry and Draco first walked over to Narcissa but were all quickly congratulated by all the Weasley’s as well.
“Yes,” Draco breathed softly, “You don’t have to ask Harry,” he parroted what he had said to Harry about cuddling.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, looking around, “we’ll make it our own home.” Draco nodded, kissing Harry lightly. They left, collecting Narcissa on their way out. Harry and Draco both said goodbye to their house-elves, thanking them for their help. Both answered that they were just a call away.
“I hope I’ll get on with your friends as you get on with mine,” Harry said, he turned to Ron, “I am re-meeting Pansy and Blaise. Though, honestly, I don’t think we’ve ever really talked.”
“I told them to meet me before the room of requirement, so, uh, I thought maybe we could ask the room for another room?” He looked sheepishly at the boy, “It’s just that this feels more like our room, you know?” Draco nodded, picking up his book.
Draco sits at the table in shock, and Narcissa smiles at her son and son-in-law. ‟Let´s have dinner,” she says, and house-elves appear with plates of food. ‟Everything should be safe for you to eat,” Narcissa says, ‟we wouldn´t want to hurt our grandson.”
“Who had expected this to happen,” Remus laughed, “Draco Malfoy and Sirius Black making pancakes together. I could get used to that.” Harry smiled at that.
Harry felt Draco’s arm tighten around him, Harry squeezed his hand again. Harry knew Draco was thinking about the feeling of Harry dying. Harry might have been the one that died, but that hadn’t been painful. The feeling of Harry’s magic trying to leave Draco and trying to hold at the same time, that had been much more painful.
“Professor,” Harry said, when he looked at him, “I was wondering if I might ask you about something.”
‟I imagine it must be hard though,” Molly asks Harry, ‟to suddenly be pregnant. For me, it was, the first time at least.” She looks at Bill, ‟we did plan it though.”
“You won’t have to decide now,” Draco continued, “sure if you want to you could start finding out what classes you need to have and which you don’t need, but you don’t have to. You should ask Remus, he knows how to become a teacher and I am guessing you would want to become a DADA teacher,” Harry nodded, “then asking him would be smart.”
“You guys handing it in today?” Harry asked. Hermione and Draco both nodded, looking very proud of themselves.
“It is general knowledge that students in our school have joined the dark lord, some have even taken the dark mark.” He saw people around the room nodding, Ron and Hermione were still looking confused, even though Harry had told them multiple times that this was happening they had never believed him. “It is with pride that I can say that we have managed to turn one of these students. This student has, with the help of Harry, been turned into a spy against the dark lord.”  Most of the people looked at Harry again who was shrugging nonsensically.
The group moved up, meeting Remus and Ron, also on their way upstairs, when they entered the corridor the sound of curses being thrown was hard in his ears. Snape ran up to the astronomy tower, Neville followed. However only snape managed to walk through, Neville was thrown back. The death eaters had already moved upstairs. One was lying on the floor, unmoving.
“I know this is hard,” Dumbledore said, “but it is important that you all do this. Harry,” he said, “you will need to tell the Order about the plan after I am dead. They need to know that Snape and Draco are still on their side.” Harry nodded. “And one more thing, with me dead, I will not be able to be secret-keeper for the headquarters. However, I can give this to someone, therefore, Harry we will need to do a spell before we leave. In which I transfer my power as secret keeper to you.” Harry nodded.
“You, do what you do best,” Dumbledore said, “you protect your friends, but if you are present when I am killed, if you see it, which is likely. You will need to act as if you hadn’t known. You will have to act that you are angry at Professor Snape. Because, if you are in the room, someone might be able to tell, no matter how well covered you are. So, act, as if you had not known.” He turned to Severus, “And in turn, you will defend yourself, but, make sure that Harry is not mortally wounded.” The professor nodded.
“God,” Draco said, looking at the pile of letters, “I expected this but, fuck, that’s a lot of people who wrote.” He looked through the handwriting. “Pansy wrote three letters?” he asked out loud.
“Now, step two,” Twycross continued after letting some time pass, “Determination. Focus your determination to occupy the visualised space. Let your yearning to enter it completely take over your body, to take over your mind.”
“I ordered the house-elves to clean everything and remove any artefacts that the death eaters left behind,” Narcissa said, “though I told them not to touch it, you never know what those people left behind.” Draco nodded. “I think we should start cleaning out your quarters, and I should do mine. Call upon the house-elves if you want something.”
‟Of course,” Pansy says, ‟we´ll do it around July. After Hogwarts. The Parkinson estate would be a beautiful place for it.” She mutters something, and Harry shoots Draco a confused look.
“I think Pihu added my father's clothing to the mix,” he said, “because half of this I have never seen before.” Draco cocked his head, looking to the closet. Indeed there was more clothing than Harry had owned, and he knew for certain that nothing of it was his own.
‟It seems that the hero´s of your war have forgiven you,” he says, ‟who am I, someone who doesn´t even know what happened, to judge you.”
They sleep when Scorpius sleeps and they´re awake when Scorpius is. Slowly their friends visit briefly and they all see Scorpius grow. Harry´s bought a book, for all of them to write something in if they wanted. There´s a lot of pictures taken, and overall, there´s a lot of love.
“I have decided, that from now on, whenever we have an important conversation we won’t wear the locket.” Hermione said, she held out her hand, “so give it to me.” Harry did as she had asked. She turned around to the portrait where Phineas was back. Harry had not seen that yet.
Slowly the days moved by, Harry focussing both on his studies and on Malfoy. They had decided to move to meet once a week for a discussion of the mission, and meeting every other Friday. Even though they both would have loved meeting every week, Hermione and Ron had told Harry that some people had started questioning where he was going off to. And they could only tell so many times he had detention, without arousing too much suspicion. And since they had to be wary of a lot of things, they decided it was for the best even if they didn’t like it.
‟Ah,” the woman says, ‟well, I´m happy that you´ve found a worthy couple to sell it to.” She smiles at Harry and Draco. ‟I´ll leave you to it! Maybe I´ll see you around again.”
“Indeed, but you fought. However,” Kingsley said, “Only Draco, Narcissa and Harry are called to testify for a few specific cases, for the rest anyone can come forward as a witness.”
Harry’s eyes softened his steel resolve lessening. “And when that happens, I’ll be right there next to you,” he answered, his voice soft, “ready to show you that you and I are both alive.” He gave Draco a quick peck on his lips. Though quick, it conveyed his love and the security he brought to Draco.
‟It was really impressive, of course, we couldn´t say that at the time,” she says, ‟and the Weasley is king, the buttons that sang? You made those as well?” Draco nods. ‟You have a knack for charms it seems.”
“I want to fuck you,” Harry said, causing Draco to open his eyes, “if you want,” he added hastily, his hips still grinding down, “we, ah, can keep doing this if you don’t.”
“I, uh,” Harry wondered if he should tell the truth, “I had put my focus into helping Draco, sir,” he looked down, “I realise now that I should have divided my focus more than focussing on one problem at a time.”
It was nice that when they started they could talk about things. It wasn’t something really important in the end, but it was the start of a conversation. To gain each other's trust, they would have to talk.
Narcissa breathed in and out, looked behind her with a small nod and opened the doors with a dramatic flair. She walked down the rows first, Harry and Draco following after a few steps, and Remus and Sirius going last. The room was filled with their friends. Fellow order members and most eight years were present. Remus had almost invited the whole Gryffindor house, as he was the Head of House. Instead, he only invited those he had a close bond with, which meant Harry and Draco’s close friends.
“Oh, well the Peverell’s family, is where the myth of the tale of the three brothers came from.” Draco said he turned to Harry, “do you still have the book I lend you?” Harry nodded moving over to the bedside table and grabbing the book from inside. “The myth, or tale, is about three brothers, that all meet death, they all ask for something, the oldest, Antioch, asks for a powerful wand, the elder wand, the middle one, Cadmus, related to the Gaunts, asks for a stone that can bring back the dead, and the youngest, Ignotus, the one Harry is related to, asks for an invisibility cloak.” Harry gives the book to Draco, who passed it over to Hermione “you can read it if you want, it isn’t that long.”
How had he missed that all the times he had been here? The whole time the letters RAB, the name had been right here. They had known who it was all this time. “Hermione! Ron!” he called out. Seconds later the two had bound down the stairs.
When it was Draco’s turn he looked around. “I don’t have that many,” he says, “but there is one, well numerous ones in one place really.”
A few days before the party, Hermione asks who she’s going to bring, now that Ron and Lavender are dating. Hermione just tells him she is going with someone she knows Ron will hate. When Harry says he thought they could’ve gone together, she says she should’ve thought about that. She does not say Harry is smart to think of that.
When they arrived home, Harry was led into a small room, close to the end of the hall. There he was greeted with the sight of Remus Lupin, waiting in a chair. The man looked better than Harry had seen him all the times he had been at Hogwarts. “Remus!” Harry said, seeing the man, the man in question stood, closing his book. And drew the boy in a hug. It wasn’t long before there was the feeling of another body joining the two in a hug. The three laughed.
The energy in the castle changed with every Daily Prophet. The first thing everyone did was look at the people that had disappeared, taken by the ministry or had been killed. Everyone looked around them to see that everyone was still there. Harry was lucky in a way, the only people he really knew were at school and the others were Aurors.
Draco nodded, “it’s an old elf. I would guess as old as Pihu, and he changed his alliance to me on the day I was named heir. So it was my elf, and I expect him to become our oldest child's elf if he lives that long.” Harry nodded, “Lucien,” Draco called out.
“As you can see,” Remus said, “not everyone is as powerful as those two over there.” Harry was looking at them, leaning against Draco. Though he wouldn’t have gotten away with that hadn’t it been for the power he had exhausted. They gave Remus a cheeky smile.
The man nodded, summoning a cart with fabric. “If you two are going to wear the same design, you should match, but not have the same colours. I propose using black for the one and white for the other.” The boys nodded, liking the idea. “We can incorporate Silver and Gold as decorations.” He looked between the two boys, looking at them critically. “Mister Potter should wear the white, his skin would make it look great. You,” he said looking at Draco, “should go with the black, with your lighter complexion white would be less fortunate.”
‟Mister Potter,” McGonagall says, ‟pregnancy is not something to take lightly. Take care of yourself and if you feel a strain in your magic, do not participate in class.” She sighs, ‟I will have to inform the staff.”
Draco looked even paler than he did, “my father?” the group all nodded, “so that was what he had been carrying that day.” He looked at the group, “that week he had dragged me to Diagon Alley every day, waiting to speak to someone. When I asked him he said he just wanted to warn someone, that someone should not mess with the Malfoys. I, of course, admired him and went with him diligently every day. I thought the warning was the whole fight our fathers had, but when he picked up Ginny’s books I saw him add an extra book. I just thought it would cause her to be sick or something. What could I do but look at what was happening.” He looked at Ron, showing regret on his face, “I do not think he knew what the book really was if he knew that it would make Riddle possess someone in a way, I don’t think he would have given it to Ginny, he would have used it in another way.” The group listened. “What happened to the book?” Draco asked.
They find their lunch in a nice little sandwich shop, and they get a few looks from the muggles, but none of them show any actual confusion.
“Sound logic,” Draco said, “but, uh, we’ll be down in a second?” Remus laughed, pulling Sirius along down the hallway.
The others had drifted off in their own discussion when Hermione had started to talk about the lessons. Harry moved to them, they easily made a place for him. Dean was asking Neville what he was going to do during the weekend. It was a Hogsmeade weekend for all the other years so Neville and Hannah had decided to stay at Hogwarts, not looking forward to the chaos that would ensue in the wizarding village.
Harry made a happy sound, jumping off of Draco and walking past Sirius to bound down the stairs. Draco chuckled, following behind Harry.
The graduation is actually a bit inspired on my own! There, our mentors spoke about us for a few minutes, which I thought was a really nice touch! I had difficulty choosing between letting the head of their houses speak or McGonagall, but they haven't had a head of house all year so it didn't sound so nice, and McGonagall knows everyone.
“Hey, none of that,” Harry said, tightening his arms around the boy. “I will always help you, and you can always tell me something. Just like you always help me. Nothing is too small to talk about if it is something that bothers you.” He felt Draco nod. “You feel better now?” another nod from Draco, “let’s go sleep then, yeah?”
“I,” Harry said, “I don’t know if I want that. I love you,” he said to Draco, “but I don’t know if I can let the name die out, not if I can help it.”
‟Leo talked about it once,” he says, ‟I think it was that band I think at least? He´s a fan I think.”
Harry stopped them from talking by holding up his hand. Luckily they listened. "Just to be sure," he said, grabbing his wand and casting a silencing charm.
“Yeah,” Harry said, “they really are,” his Patronus fell away, as did Draco’s only moments later, both men now too focussed on each other, “I think my Patronus changed because of you,” he said, “because I fell in love with you,” he looked into the grey eyes before him.
“You should look at the family homes,” Narcissa offered, “there used to be a lovely place in France and one in the countryside.” Sirius nodded.
The next day Draco and Harry were sitting comfortably in the drawing-room when the floo suddenly burst aflame. Out came the minister, with his hand in front of his eyes. Harry was the first to see, laughing loudly at Kingsley’s antics.
“They bought it just after the school year ended, said they had a lot of back and forth with the seller because he thought he could run up the price when he found out who they were. Of course, they didn’t like that but in the end, Percy helped with the contract and all that, and they’re going to renovate it now.”
“Huh,” Harry looked up to Hermione looking with a concerned look, “yeah, I’m okay ‘Mione, just thinking.” He looked around, “I was thinking about tonight, and how I would need to do my homework after my meeting.” He used the word meeting because he felt it was less like lying. “I haven’t done much these last two days.”
Fairy lights were strewn across the room, together with green and red orbs. After the dinner, they would remove all the tables and chairs to create a space to dance, much as they had done at Fleur and Bill’s wedding.
‟I hope we find something before the baby comes. Imagine moving and having a baby at the same time,” Draco says with a laugh. ‟It was nice for Andromeda to offer her home to us if we didn´t find anything.”
“Yes,” Harry said, “till tomorrow.” With that the minister left, going the same way he had arrived. The rest of the people looked at him quizzically, “he wants to speak with the four of us about the mission Hermione, Ron and I were on. I told him you knew,” he said to Draco, “so he asked if you could come as well.” The rest nodded, Harry and Draco hadn’t told them what it was, even though the war was over.
“You want to?” Harry asked. “I,” he paused, “I never got to know about it you know. Aunt petunia only mentioned dad was Indian once. She scoffed at it,” his eyes were sad, “I didn’t even know my grandma and granddad were both Indian till the Mirror of Erised. I saw them and saw that they were like me. I never really knew who to ask,” he said softly, “I never knew someone who knew about their culture.”
McGonagall led the four to the courtrooms. She would not be part of the trial herself, so she left them in Narcissa’s care, and asked Narcissa to escort them back to Hogwarts as no one was sure how long the trial would last. The group sat together, sitting close to other witnesses that Harry did not recognise.
“Yeah, that’s why I thought we could combine the duties as newly appointed lord and a getaway.” Harry looked confused, so Draco continued to explain. “I told you that my family has an apothecary chain right?” Harry nodded,  “well with them we also have greenhouses that supply most of the ingredients and brewing houses that brew the potions and drinks we do sell. As the head of the family, it would be my task to see them and see how the people are. We could go together.”
“They are part of the list, though when the list was made public, the family told everyone that they weren’t part of it because there were many muggle people that were related to your family.” Draco continued, “that is also why many pure-blood families see your family as blood-traitors,” Draco saw both Hermione and Ron’s jaw tightening, “however, there is a reason that most families are about to die out, as the families were too busy trying to stay in the pureblood sphere that they did not realise marrying muggles, half-bloods or muggle-born is necessary.”
“It’s a dragon Hermione, It can take care of itself. It’s us we need to worry about.” Ron said. Hermione cocked her head, questioning. “I don’t know how to break this to you, Hermione,” Ron said, “but, I think they might’ve notices we broke into Gringotts. The most secure place They’ll know we broke into Gringotts.” They started to laugh, Harry momentarily forgetting the pain in his scar, until it was too much.
The song ends and Harry pouts, he turns, turning the vinyl to the other side. He smiles brightly when the song starts. He sings along, ‟crazy little thing called love,” he sings, pulling Draco into another spontaneous dance. Harry laughs brightly Draco laughing too.
With the trials finally out of the way Harry and Draco felt like they could breathe, and they relaxed more. Harry was busy most of his free periods these weeks. As he had many lessons to catch up with, with Hagrid. As promised Harry and Draco went by Hagrid the next week. Draco was nice, apologised for buckbeak and showed Hagrid that he wasn’t the prat he used to be. Hagrid conceded saying that Draco seemed to be a good guy, and he heard about the trial and all. Though he did not say so to Draco, only mentioning it during Harry’s next lesson.
“Because,” Hermione answered, “if we were to be captured and someone would Legilimency on us, we wouldn’t be able to resist either. So they would know that Snape helped us. Which could be the death of him.” Harry nodded. Ron gave a weak ‘right’. She turned to Harry, “go now, we’ll tell him.”  Harry nodded, going back to the place he had been taking watch.
“Nah, he’s busy drawing,” he said, “I forgot how talented he was with that.” He said, looking over to his boyfriend who was sitting at a table in front of the fire. “So I’m here to bother you,” he said with a smile.
“Well, you see, Lord Malfoy has sworn to protect his family.” She said, serenely, “He must do that, in whatever circumstances, in any way he can, or he could get hurt himself, as it is a form of an unbreakable oath. So when the dark lord ordered me to be captured, Lord Malfoy made sure that they brought me to the manor.”
“You silly girl,” he said, “the sword is made out of Goblin silver. It repels whatever doesn’t strengthen it.” He looked away, a bored look on his face.
When they were inside, Harry was forced to cast the Imperius curse on both Travers and the Goblin leading them. Harry had never before done the curse, nor wanted he, but he knew it was necessary. The operation went nothing as they wanted, but at least they got out alive with the cup. However, they had lost the sword, without having been able to destroy the Horcrux.
“I need to keep up appearances, as if I did nothing strange, mainly because only Snape’s name is in the paper for the murder. So I need to go to others, I should be able to get away.” Harry nodded at that. He really wanted to see Draco. He needed to see Draco. “I need to go,” he whispered, “I love you, Harry.”
“The well? Close to the forest, do you know which one I mean?” Draco nodded, “that should be close to the manor, only a few minutes walk. Apparate to there.” Draco nodded again, and they were gone. Harry landed next to Draco, Ron stumbling a bit. Sirius landed a few feet from them Remus and Hermione both looking unbothered.
“I literally walked in on Sirius giving you a blowjob,” Harry accused Remus. Both men choked on air, Narcissa, who Harry hadn’t realised was already sitting in the kitchen, gave a delighted laugh. “Besides,” Harry said, pouting slightly, “I was going to propose we play chess. I was just messing with Draco.”
“Thank you, Miss Lovegood,” Amelia said. Luna nodded, walking back to her place next to Ginny. “With that, all the witnesses have been talked to. I would now like to ask if the immediate family of the accused has anything to add before the wizengamot goes into deliberation.” She looked at Draco, who shook his head. Next, she looked at Narcissa who nodded. Amelia signalled her to come forward.
The nurses had told him that there was no way that he could ever get rid of it. Draco knew it in the back of his mind, he always had. But that moment he knew for certain that the mark would always be on his arm.
‟It´s not unheard of,” she says gently, ‟though very much uncommon. There are only a few cases of unplanned male pregnancies. It seems you and your partner have a very compatible magical signature.”
‟It´s old,” Harry says opening the cupboards, ‟but it´s in pretty good condition, and it´s not ugly.” Draco nods, ‟I say, change the stove and fridge for a new form, and let the rest stay. If we really want, we can always remodel it later.”
They walked towards a small shed where the chariot was parked, three brooms also hanging on the wall. “You guys have a carriage?” Harry asked. He knew the answer was yes, as he was looking at it but it still surprised him.
Remus nodded, “well, you can always do your newts another time. You won’t have to start immediately. You could finish your year as you are doing now, and take the Care of Magical creatures NEWT next year. You wouldn’t have to study it at Hogwarts necessarily. For the History, you really would need to check with McGonagall if you need to finish it, she might want you to only have a passing OWL, which you could also get next year.”
“Indeed,” Dumbledore said, “you can come, because, due to Voldemort himself, you are his equal, you are the one that will kill him after all the Horcruxes are gone.”
“You can say that again,” Blaise said, “one moment you are doing all kinds of stuff we don’t want to know in the sixth year and the next moment you are bonded to Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding world.” He looked over to Harry, his eyes taking him in, “he does clean up nice,” he mocks whispers to Draco.
They continue talking for the rest of the day. Around midday Teddy begins to get fussy, wanting to play around. They exit the tea shop and find themselves in a park that Harry had never noticed. There are other kids playing and Harry smiles when he sees Teddy moving around.
“She’ll be okay. She was crushed, thought Malfoy here had doused you with a love potion or something. But well, we both know love potion acts differently.” He said, grimacing when he thought back to the problem with the love potion. “Seamus and Dean helped her realise it wasn’t though,” he said. “I don’t think she’ll be very nice to you the first few weeks, but she’ll get over it.”
“Still confused,” Harry said, “I mean sure, they are bonded now, how does that help when they are apart?”
Halfway through the week, they receive the notice that the house has changed ownership and that they are now officially owners of the house in Everton. Harry instructs Kreacher to clean the house thoroughly. He takes a day before returning, telling them that he finished. The day after he cuts the grass and cleans the garden.
“So,” Kingsley said, “at this point, you had destroyed five of the Horcruxes.” Hermione nodded, “and you thought you had only one more to go, the snake.” Ron nodded, “this was when Voldemort suddenly ceased fire, saying that he would let everyone live if Harry came to the forest.”
“Thanks, Draco,” she said smiling. For the first time, she looked the two boys up and down. She whistled low, “you two look really good, though your hair could use some styling as well Harry.”
“I might actually start to like that husband of yours,” Ginny grumbled, “thank him for us will you.”
Draco was walking past the books, reading the spines. When he found a book that he thought could be interesting he took it out of the bookcase. Soon he had three books stacked on each other. “I think we should start with these?” Draco said, turning and looking over at Harry.
Harry looked at the memories in the flask in his hand. He stood, only to fall back, the voice of Voldemort loud and clear.
“Okay, wait,” Hermione said, “back up.” She sighed frustrated. “You are basically the leader of a whole family, including all the second and third and many more cousins?” she asks.
He picked up the mirror and the ring next looking in the mirror, he saw nothing but his own reflection. He looked at the ring, he could put it on, they weren’t in any danger now, they were safe here. Would he be asked about it? Would it matter?
Draco shrugs, ‟maybe? I thought we could go to the Malfoy vault and look at some of the paintings there. Maybe see into the Potter and Black collection if you´d want.” Harry nods. ‟I´ll send them back to the vaults so we know they´re in our collection.”
“Master Draco’s belonging’s,” they indicated. “I talked with Lucien about what master Draco owns, and I had a thought.” Pihu looked at Harry for permission to speak said thought, Harry nodded at Pihu for her to continue. “Master Draco needs a room for his art projects. So I propose that the western tower as a studio.”
Draco hummed, “so, ask her,” he said shrugging his shoulders, “You haven’t written your weekly letter yet, ask her in that one.”
The first half of the potion goes very well. But then Draco adds the eyes of Newt and Harry takes one whiff of it before he staggers. He manages to grab Draco´s arm before he falls over.
‟I remind you of the fact you composed a song to make fun of Ron.” McGonagall laughs, ‟and the potter stink buttons?”
Harry laughed, the happy sound unexpected with everything that had been happening. “Draco,” Harry said, “I love you so much.” He once again moved forward, still holding Draco’s wand. He pointed it at his door, locking it, and pulled Draco towards his bed.
Lucius shakes his head, ‟you passed indeed,” he tells him, ‟Now go, I imagine the train ride was less than comfortable.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “I know that it has something to do with what Dumbledore said to us, so we can’t really talk about it?”
Luna spoke up, “well, there’s the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw?” people looked confused. “It’s lost, centuries ago. Flitwick says it vanished with Ravenclaw itself.”
“Well, I’m off to bed,” Harry said, stretching, “good night guys,” he got a chorus of goodnight’s back, leaving the room.
It turned out that a lot of people were there all ready for dinner. When the boys walked in the hall went silent, all eyes focussing on them. Harry, used to this by now, just walked on, ignoring the stares. Draco, less used to it, had some difficulty ignoring the looks. The others weren’t here yet, so Harry sat down, pulling Draco down with him.
Draco nodded, “and I mean the moving was more instinct, I think.” Harry nodded in agreement. “Also when I used wandless magic I didn’t use words, because it was more acting on instinct. I reacted to what Harry did, and I imagine he reacted to what I did.” Harry nodded again. “I don’t think I ever knew which exact spell I used, only if it was a protection of attack spell.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, “mother taught me. It’s one of the reasons I didn’t want the death eaters here, these paintings are very personal.” Harry nodded in understanding. He looked at the canvas’ stacked on one another.
“No problem,” Hermione said, “I should go, it’s almost seven. See you guys in the common room okay?” They nodded. “Oh,” she said turning away, “I brought my beaded bag,” she said, “there’s enough space for some bottles.”
Draco doesn´t say anything just turning back to Luna, who´s more than happy to continue talking. Harry smiles, before starting to eat. Slowly the conversation starts up, and Harry smiles towards himself. When pudding arrives, Harry steers clear of the Coconut macaroons, grabbing himself a piece of treacle tart.
‟I suggest that,” Andromeda says, ‟you could look into getting a home that you could build onto.” Both men nod, ‟two bathrooms?” she asks, both men nodding again.
‟I don´t care if he likes me or not,” Harry says turning back to Draco, ‟I want to give him the chance to show us he´s better with Scorpius, but he won´t be able to show that if you let him provoke you.” He shakes his head, ‟you told me he was a good father, that he was good to you when you were younger. You confessed you still love him, even though he did those awful things.”
“I was thinking of going into Hogsmeade,” Harry said when someone asked what he was going to do. “Need to buy some supplies,” he shrugged. He looked over to Draco with a silent question, who nodded. When Dean asked him what he was going to do, he too said he was going to go to Hogsmeade. Dean almost laughed at that.
“Vernon,” came the voice of a snatcher, “your name isn’t on the list, aren’t you wanted? Or are you on a different name? what was your Hogwarts house?”
She looked around again, every single one of the students nodding. Her eyes lingered on Harry and his friends, knowing they had the most action during the war. They all nodded grimly. It wasn’t like they thought it was going to be necessary, but if it were the case, they would listen to her.
Ever since the party with the eight years, where he had talked way too much about his sex life, he had been less held back about it. He just divulged the information to those he loved and to see people squirm. Draco thought it was very Slytherin of him.
Harry told Remus and Sirius, they were sad, but they also knew it was bound to happen. They told Harry they’ll do everything in their power to protect Harry’s friends and family.
The following week Harry and Draco are roped into all kinds of activities with their friends. By working hard with all their friends, the group has started mixing, and everyone is becoming a form of friends. Pansy and Astoria are often seen together as are Daphne and Blaise, though the former is also often missing, while the latter two are never completely alone together, per decorum.
They enter the room of requirement. It´s nothing like the one he´d been in with Draco, instead, it´s very similar to the Gryffindor common room. Harry takes a seat, the rest filling in.
And sleeping in one room was great. Harry had noticed that Draco touching him really helped how tired he was sometimes, especially if they hadn’t even held hands that day. If he focused, he could notice the baby taking part of his magic, though not enough to take it all way, and enough for it to regenerate during the night. Especially when the baby went to Draco´s magic during that time.
“Yeah, well, he can also send false things to Harry,” Hermione said, “that’s what he did in our fifth year.”
“I think that they want you to live the life that you want.” He said, “and, I think they won’t mind, as long as we still go and see them. Don’t think they’d mind having their home back.”
He pulled the boy to their bed, both sitting next to one another. “There are other things we can do,” Draco said. “Remember how I said that I would once become Lord Malfoy?” Harry nodded, “do you also remember what I said after that?”
There was a clock on the waiting room wall, showing that it was already eight ‘o clock. They had spent a long time in that room. As if on cue, Ron’s stomach gave a rumble, signalling its hunger. “Dinner?” Harry asked the others. They all nodded relieved.
All of them drank the liquid that Snape had offered. They all took each others hands, Harry was reluctant to do it, but he knew it was necessary for the spell to have contact with the people that concerned the spell. It took little time to finish and once finished they sat down in the chair looking at each other. No one knew who was going to speak first.
“Then why did you take the dark mark?” Hermione asked, “If you are so against Voldemort,” both Ron and Draco flinched at the name, “why did you join him.”
“So you aren’t dating anyone?” Daphne asked, interrupting the conversation for the first time. Harry felt Draco’s leg tensing under the table.
Draco grinned, “they aren’t wrong,” he pointed out, still only talking low enough that Harry could hear him.
“No?” Draco asked, sitting down next to him, “you don’t want to be my trophy husband? Colour me shocked.”
Draco nodded, “though, we’re buying him new clothes first,” he smiled, “he would be eaten alive if he met them wearing something like that,” he said with a disgusted look at Harry’s clothes.
‟Right,” Draco says slowly, ‟and you don´t care that the world knows I knocked you up? They´ll speculate that we only got engaged because of this.”
I may have put wayy too much attention into them getting ready, but honestly wanted to write the familiarity between them. Hope y'all like it!
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, “this one didn’t mention anything new either. Well besides that the trait to talk to snakes, was from Slytherin. They mentioned that many from the gaunt family could speak it. Which means you didn’t get your trait from the Peverell’s as they married into the family.”
The first week after the ceremony was busy. Draco received letters from both France and England. Most of them were congratulations on the induction to the house of lords and lady’s, but there were some that were to ask for appointments with their new lord.
“A Gryffindor,” Pansy repeated, “I mean why a Gryffindor. There are so many good looking Slytherin and Ravenclaws. Hell, there are some good looking Hufflepuffs even.”
“Right,” Harry said, “I forgot I also had a personal vault.” He paused, looking at the numbers again, “are these numbers including that vault?” Draco nodded his head. “Wow.” He closed it again, he wasn’t sure what to think of it. It wasn’t like he was very interested in money, but to know that he would always be comfortable as would his children, was a nice thought.
Neville moved over to Harry, “did he really just ask why Seamus was walking like that?” he asked, Harry nodded. “Poor Hermione,” he said solemnly. Causing Harry to spit out his water, coughing. Neville’s head turned red, “No, wait I didn’t mean it like that,” he said, realising how it could’ve sounded. “I meant it in a poor Hermione, that she’s in a relationship with someone so tactless. Not in a how sad Hermione has apparently never needed to walk like that,” he rambled, his face only getting redder. Harry was laughing so loud he felt his stomach hurt.
The boys sat down, looking at one another. They hadn’t really discussed how they would ask this. Harry looked at Draco, eyes asking him to start the conversation. Draco however shook his head, it was his godfather, he had to ask.
“Why are you here Malfoy,” Ron demanded. The moment his mouth opened the energy in the room turned down, making the whole room colder. It took Harry some time to realise it was his doing.
“Yeah,” Draco said, pulling on his clothes, “I’ll see you at breakfast then,” he gave Harry a quick peck covering himself with the invisibility cloak.
Harry looked around, the order of the Phoenix had arrived. Most of the older people had stayed. They were ready to fight. McGonagall was giving orders to people, others were casting spells to protect the school.
Harry pulls Draco in another hug, ‟I´m kinda nervous for tomorrow,” he says, ‟what is she going to say?”
“Kreacher did,” Sirius reminded him, “and technically, because you were still alive the bond between house elf and the potter family was not broken. I imagine James told her to stay, both to keep her safe and to make sure you would be able to return if you wanted to.” Sirius looked around. “It hasn’t changed a bit.”
“Thanks, Bill,” he said, “for not asking what we are doing, and for the warning. We’ll keep it in mind.”
“I’ve never done them,” she said, “but I know the theory. You think we should make him forget that we were in the ministry at all?”
“We missed you too, Harry,” Remus said, “Sirius and I actually have a little surprise for you.” Remus and Sirius walked out of the room, towards the stairs, Harry following dutifully. The Home looked better than it had looked so far. The two had been busy renovating during the periods that they hadn’t worked for the order. The awful elf heads and paintings had been removed. All the walls had been repainted, most of them now a lighter form of green and some red and yellow.
When they entered they all took a seat, Harry and Ron sitting next to each other. When Hermione came in she came to sit behind them, Draco sat down next to her after she nodded to his silent question.
Miss Granger, who had been talking to Narcissa turned back to her husband. “Andrew,” she said, “can you believe Narcissa is actually a Lady! As in nobility?” Her husband looked back at Narcissa, her posture and masks in place. She smiled warmly. Harry and Draco left the Granger with Narcissa moving to search for their friends. They talked animatedly with their parents and each other and the rest of the day was filled with talk of everything, from what they’ll miss the most and what they are going to do during the next year.
I know it might all seem a bit planned now, but I think that Harry and Draco need an actual plan if they set up a way to assassinate Dumbledore. Especially because it would need to go well, and the people in the school would need to be as protected as they could be. And I think this was the best way to do it.
“Well, they don’t know about how I became a spy for the order and they don’t know about how I got the death Eaters into the castle.” He paused, his eyes cast down between their bodies, “it’s basically my fault that Snape became headmaster and that the Carrows were even in Hogwarts. It should’ve been safe, but it wasn’t because of me.”
The following weeks the group went around wizarding villages, trying to find anything and everything they could. All the places they knew Voldemort had been, safe for those that were close to Hogwarts or to London. They went around, moving into and out of places.
Harry was confused, but he didn’t mind. They walked through the manor. It didn’t feel like a home like his manor had. It felt devoid of emotion, like everything that made it feel regal and ancient had left.
“Yeah, but his is the same as his Animagus,” Hermione said, “it’s the same with Sirius and Remus, Sirius’ is of Snuffles, and Remus is that of his wolf.”
“Yeah, didn’t even outright say anything about it. Though I got a lot of jibes about how there was tightened security for the family vaults.” Harry said laughing, “oh and he mentioned how there used to be a dragon as protection.”
Harry told him how he killed the basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor and killed the first piece of Voldemort’s soul with the fang of a basilisk.
“You will have to request your family scrolls from the Ministry,” Narcissa informed them. “Your family scroll will become dormant when your family is taken up by ours,” she said to Harry, “so you’ll be able to request it from the ministry after they have taken a look at both scrolls.”
Slowly people trickled into the carriage. First Neville came in, with Hannah Abbot in tow. They had gotten together shortly after the last battle. Luna arrived a bit later, happily sitting next to Draco. And then Seamus and Dean arrived. It was a tight fit, but they managed.
“Really?” Draco asked, feigning ignorance to Harry’s obvious suggestion, “what are you thinking of?”
“Technically,” Draco said, “you were walked in on by your cousin, as you are now officially related to the Black and Malfoy family.”
In the end, he was bleeding heavily, and that is when Harry suddenly appeared. Only later did he realize Harry probably found him, because he had felt Draco’s pain and how he was close to bleeding out. He’d brought him to St. Mungos. They had only managed to heal parts of his arm, though there was a piece around the mark that no magic could touch. The only way to heal that had been using muggle technology. Stitches.
“You are here as a character witness,” Amelia said, to which Luna nodded, “tell us, what should we take into consideration?”
‟Understatement of the year,” Harry says, pulling Draco out of the room without another glance at Lucius. ‟Come, love,” he says to Draco, ‟my back and feet are killing me.”
“Hermione,” Harry said, “we all said what we were going to do after school. What were you planning?”
It wasn’t long before the group arrived. Thirteen people were in the abandoned living room of Privet drive, Harry had his rug sack and broom in his hand. “He knows that I’m being moved tonight,” Harry says, not waiting for a hello.
“You are officially accepted into the Snake Club,” Pansy said, “only real snake people can talk about a snake like that.”
He has a folder in his hand, and he reads it through quickly. ‟I´d first like to run some diagnostics again. To check up and see if anything changed since your matron has checked.” Harry nods, and he performs all the same diagnostics.
They eat dinner, drink some more, and Draco finds his way to Leo´s flat, lying on his couch. ‟You really love him, eh,” Leo asks him.
Harry, not entirely awake from his dream, realised that he must have been making sounds during his dream. He didn’t know if he should be happy that the sounds he was making during a sex dream were the same as he made when he was a nightmare. But if it meant that Ron won’t be asking questions about it, all the better. “I’m okay, Ron,” he answered, putting his hand on his friend's hand that had been on his shoulder. “Thanks for waking me up, you should go back to sleep.”
“Well, yes that was not pleasant,” Draco says. “I kind of taught you were breaking up with me because you were going to tell your friends the previous Friday.”
“Of course not,” Hermione sighed, “we only managed to convince McGonagall that it was something that was needed, and to pass it on to the board.”
The next week Harry and Draco stand before the front door, hands intertwined. Harry isn´t nervous anymore. He´s excited, having dinner with all of his family. He doesn´t have to leave his heart at home.
“Of course Harry, they wouldn’t care that you are with a man,” Remus said with knowing eyes, “I think they would be proud that you found something in these hard times. And that you loved who you loved, even though you know not everyone would be happy about the specific person.”
Draco leads them to his quarters. Harry finds himself in a comfortable position on the bed, and Draco sits down, pulling Harry´s feet on his lap. Harry falls asleep with Draco massaging his feet lovingly.
‟They´d have done the same when we suddenly have a son, only if we didn´t show them that one of us was pregnant, they´ll wonder who´s it really is and who the mother is.” Harry shrugs, ‟I´m not ashamed of Scorpius.”
“Well, it was great meeting another family member!” she walked out of the room, “nice meeting you Draco!”
Draco and Narcissa stayed in Grimmauld place. Narcissa had her own room, and Draco stayed in Harry’s. Though neither had told her that they had bonded, it seemed that she had known that they were. Narcissa and Harry had struck up an unlikely friendship, fuelled by their shared love for the blond git walking around. She had approved of the relationship from the start, much like Sirius had.
They take the fast route to the room of requirement. ‟We´ll have to tell them,” Harry says the moment they sit down on the couch. ‟If we´re changing rooms, they´ll want to know why.”
Only when he met Krum at the wedding where he had heard the name before. The man was a wandmaker. He asked Krum where the man was, but he only told him that the man had retired.
Harry and Draco both nod, telling her the same Harry told his friends. ‟It´s early, but Draco and I both always wanted kids. And it´s not like there´s a guarantee this will happen again.”
“Okay,” Harry said, “I’d like that option. But what if you have to ask the family and they do not agree? Would that mean that I either have to become Lord Potter or that my family name would go extinct?”
For the first time, Harry looks up. When he looks around, he sees almost everyone in the great hall looking at them. ‟They´re all looking,” Harry whispers.
“I actually would need you to talk with me before the trials,” he said, “so we know how much is relevant to the trials and what should or should not have to be discussed.”
The woman nodded, “much like your room it is the only one not defiled by the death eaters.” Draco nodded. “I already had your fathers office cleared out, all the necessary documents are in the chalet in France. You might want to look through it and see if you want some things he owned.” Draco nodded, “call for your house-elf,” she suggested, “you know he missed you, but he wouldn’t leave your stuff without a guard.”
He doesn´t, walking into Draco´s outstretched hands with platinum locks. Harry feels his heart melt, his hand going to the bump without noticing. Draco lifts Teddy with a loving look towards Harry.
It occurred to him how similar it felt to each other, the way the feeling came in. Though if he concentrated it was easy to distinguish the feelings. Draco was something deep inside him, he felt it in his chest. While Voldemort’s anger he felt radiating from his skin, from his scar.
“To the library, duh.” Harry said, walking faster, “I want to get a book about snakes and how to take care of them! I need to know what to and what not to do!” Harry and Draco went into the library, there were few people there, and Harry walked over to madam Prince.
“We have now dealt with the separate accusations of the accused, and will move on to the accusation that they all share.” Amelia said, “First we will let the accused Alecto Carrow speak, as she has stated that they all are not responsible, but she can say who is.” A hush covers the whole courtroom. Alecto Carrow smiles, as his silencing spell is lifted. “Drink the veritaserum, state your name and explain.”
Harry nodded, “I agree,” he said, “I imagine they are safest in Potter Manor,” he continued, “and we could always look through the books there and see which ones could be in the library you proposed. After all, everything that is now of the Potter family will become Malfoy property.” Narcissa nodded, a small smile breaking through her mask.
Harry nods, “I guess you’re right.” He gives a small smile, “you’ll tell me if it's too much though?”
“Well,” Kinglsey said, contemplating his answer, “I think you should be able to say everything. Keeping things a secret will only make people want to find out more. But, I do recommend that you only tell people you trust.” The others nodded. Kingsley stood, giving them all a hug, “thank you, for telling me, and for being so brave.” They all smiled leaving his office.
He actually did follow them, only now they were walking down towards the dungeons, looking back they saw Harry walking towards them. Snape pulled them into a classroom, locking the door and adding a privacy spell on it, making sure no one could hear them.
“Kingsley!” Sirius said, hugging the man, “Draco said you were here. To what do we owe the pleasure?”
Narcissa had moved in on Tuesday, as promised, and they were frequently found together in the study. Harry mostly left them to themselves, but he joined them whenever one of them thought they could use his help.
“This sword belongs to the Goblins. It was stolen from us by Gryffindor, it is ours, and should come back to us.” He said.
“Every time they say stuff like that,” dean mock whispered to Seamus, “and all I can think is, what the actual fuck were those three did. Travelling through the whole English countryside?” The three of them just shrugged, not answering anything about it.
“Wait, you guys aren’t….” It’s not like he had thought he would find disgust on their faces, but he also hadn’t expected this openness, this carelessness about it.
“So when we take up new family members,” Harry started, trying to make sense of it, “you will be exchanging magic with them?”
“Yeah,” he said with a sheepish expression. “I missed having an animal around, but I could never take another owl.”
“Get out,” Slughorn said, “I don’t know what Dumbledore said, or what he showed, but don’t ever ask that of me again, get out of here now.” Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Slughorn stood and only pointed at the door, Harry held up his hands, as if he was giving up and left the room.
They went back into silence, slowly they had gotten more comfortable, Draco had put his feet up against the small table that stood in front of them and Harry had turned a but putting his back in Draco’s flank. Stretching his lag over the rest of the couch. They sat in comfort, both wanting to just stay, and ignore the war for just a minute. They sat in silence just basking in the fire. When they both felt themselves falling asleep.
“Can’t believe Harry didn’t realise you two were together,” Draco laughed, causing Harry, who had been standing next to Draco, to hit him against the back of his head, causing Sirius and Remus to snicker. Ron, still too overwhelmed by the sight of Draco cooking breakfast, was standing in the middle of the doorway eyes wide. This caused a pileup behind him.
“Yeah, no,” Ron said, “but when we managed to get into the vault Griphook double-crossed us, and he wasn’t going to help us get out. So Hermione had this brilliant idea. Jump on the Dragon and free it, so he could get us out of there.”
“Ginny,” Hermione said, “could we speak with Harry alone?” The girl just nodded, leaving the three of them alone.
“Good,” Kingsley said. “I think I have all I need. Thank you for sharing,” he said to all of them, “and Harry, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry.”
Slowly Slughorn moved his hand to his pocket, grabbing a flask, he touched his temple with his wand, pulling out the memory, while keeping his eyes locked on Harry’s eyes. On Lily’s eyes. He gave the memory to Harry, “Just,” Slughorn said, “don’t think too badly of me after you’ve seen this.” With those words, he turned to the table and fell asleep next to Hagrid.
“Harry!” Hermione said, “are you okay?” Harry was lying on the ground, Hermione and Ron standing over him.
Harry smiled, “thanks, we won't be able to do anything about the past. But one thing is for sure, I’m done fighting.”
He walks out, what are they going to do with Kreacher. He doesn´t want his kids growing up, thinking it´s normal to have a house-elf. He doesn´t want them to grow up spoiled rotten, and not knowing how to work a stove. How to cook an egg.
Harry gave a mock salute before walking off to the storage. ‟Can´t believe you still have to work with the ferret,” Ron says when he too stands there to gather his ingredients. ‟You´d think saving the world would give you at least a free pass from that.”
“Oh,” Sirius said, “I told Remus that you two would get bonded before Fleur’s wedding, he said that you guys would at least wait till the war was done.” Sirius looked over them proudly, “I obviously saw the impulsive Black traits in Draco and the James in you.” He held his hand out to Remus who reluctantly dropped a gold coin into it.
Dumbledore nodded throughout the speech, listening intently. “Those were good plans Draco. I suggest you focus on the last one. The first one will need to be eliminated, as this could endanger another student. For the second one we would need to find a way to see that Slughorn doesn’t drink it alone, and that when he drinks it with someone else this person will give him a bezoar.”
“I taught him the Patronus charm,” even though they were alone in the common room, he didn’t want to use Draco’s name for fear that someone would overhear.
“Really,” Hermione said, “only good wizards can do that Harry.” This caused Harry to look angry at Hermione.
The parents all left before dinner, the great hall being turned back into what it normally was. There was a feast, with McGonagall speeching about how happy she was that they ended the year without much ado. After the feast the eight years went to their dorm, having their last get together in their own common room until deep in the night.
“Mate,” Ron said, turning his head to him, “you realised you screamed so loud that it went through the silencing charm. The charm that McGonagall put up. Besides, I was always worried when that happened.” Harry just shrugged.
Ron and Hermione look at one another again, and it seems they´ve decided it´s Hermione´s turn to talk. ‟I´m glad you felt like you could tell us,” she says with a smile, ‟Is that what made you upset. You´re not a coward because you didn´t tell us before you were ready.”
time, when he turned he felt the familiar pull he had when he had gone on the side along trip with Dumbledore. He felt himself moving from the place he turned on and appearing inside the hoop. He looked around him, seeing Hermione and Ron looking at him impressed. Hermione was wearing a slightly envious, but she was also looking proud.
“Oh,” Sirius said, his hand grabbing Remus’ on the table, “Yeah, I mean I knew you’d ask about them eventually,” Sirius took a deep breath, “is it okay if we do it tomorrow? I’d like to, well, prepare myself?” He looked at Remus who nodded encouragingly. “It’s just tough to talk about them,” he said looking back at Harry.
‟He´s downstairs,” Ginny says. Harry frowns, he thought Draco was still at Hogwarts. ‟I told him mum might want to see him.” Harry shakes his head with a smile. ‟Want me to get him?”
“Potter,” Snape spoke sneering at the boy, “The headmaster had said that you were to find a way that everyone could speak freely in this room without the Dark Lord, or any of your friends would find out due to a slip of the tongue.” Snape looked at harry sceptically, he probably thought that Harry wasn’t competent enough to find a way for that.
“At least we will be able to talk now, with the mirror?” Draco said hopefully, “though we should be careful with that.” The two boys looked in front of them, not knowing what to do. “How is it, that when it is my last night, we have no idea what we should do?”
McGonagall nods, ‟are you doing that for yourself, or because you want to prove to people that you´re a good man.”
‟Yes,” Harry answers instantly. He moves to straddle Draco. ‟I love you Draco, and I don´t care what the rest of the goddamn world thinks. You´ll be my husband and I´ll carry your name with pride. Like generations of Malfoy´s have done before you. Your family is more than the mistakes you, your father or grandfather made.”
“Now, as you all know, there are only seven of you here. Obviously, we could put you all with the current seventh year, but we have decided that as eight-year you will all share one tower.” She said standing up, “I will bring you all there.”
‟Actually,” Harry says, ‟we were wondering if there was a store that sold wall paint anywhere close by.”
‟There´s a village not far from here,” Andromeda says, ‟close enough by Hogwarts to fly there, but mixed with wizards and muggles.”
“I love you guys,” he said, “tell the others I love them as well.” He looked at Ron. “Take care of your family,” he said, “they’ll be okay, but they’ll need you and Hermione.” He nodded, tears falling down his eyes. “And please, go and see Sirius and Remus as well.” He nodded again.
“Indeed,” Dumbledore said, “I am glad you say this, after all, if we don’t procure the real memory, I fear there is no way we will know what Voldemort has done. And after this lesson, there is only that memory that still needs to be found.” Harry nodded at that. “you remember where we left off?”
He quickly walked over to the table. He usually didn’t because, well, he already got enough attention, and walking to the teachers’ table would generate even more, but he really wanted to show Remus and Sirius.
Draco did what Remus said. He pulled at his magic, pulling it up. He had never done this before. All the times he helped Harry it was with his mind, thinking of him, sending him energy through his mind. Controlling the magic in his core, that wasn’t something he was used to doing. It was one of the reasons wizard’s used wands. Very few people were able to actually manipulate the magic inside their core.
“Shh,” Luna said, much groggier than her usual light self, “Shut up and just give us. I can’t believe how much we drank.” Harry laughed loudly, causing the two girls to look at him with a mad expression. He threw his hand in the air, fishing a potion out of his bag. The girls shared it, looking better immediately. “Thank you, Harry,” Luna said, kissing him on his cheek.
With the ceremony over the ceremony, the room empties out, Harry and Draco following Narcissa out of the room. Sirius and Remus stay behind for a second, relaxing before dinner.
“Fuck yes,” Draco said, his hips bucking up slightly. “You know how to?” he asked Harry. It had been on his mind ever since Harry had taken control that one night at the start of eight-year. He liked that as much as he had liked ordering Harry around. Harry tying him up was the icing on the cake, especially when he also blindfolded him.
The two men looked at one another, before again turning to Harry. “What is it?” Sirius asked, concern in his voice. “You’re not pregnant right?” Harry laughed at that, thinking Sirius was making a joke. Though, his face told him he had not been joking.
Hermione approached Harry at his table somewhere in the night, she asked if he was alright, but before he could answer, silver light came through the tent.  A lynx appeared, Kingsley’s voice coming from it, faint screams being heard in the background. “The ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead,” Harry finished the message at the same time as Kingsley, “they are coming.”
They sat down, Draco noticed Harry actually sitting down more slowly. Chuckling, he got an elbow in the rib for that. Hermione looked at both of them. “You okay?” she asked Draco, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you with hair like this.”
Draco stands there, hand on the doorpost, his back to Harry. “I love you too, Harry,” he says, before grabbing his coat and walking out the door.
He moves his head away quickly, pushing the curry away. He breaths a few times, before pouting. Draco tries to hide his laugh but doesn´t manage, and when Harry looks at him with squinting eyes, he´s laughing behind his hand.
Neville nods, ‟I just wanted to check up,” he says with a smile. Harry gives him a smile. Neville grabs a cake and Harry takes one whiff before the same feeling as today hits him. He stands quickly, walking out of the great hall and into the bathroom. He´s just on time before he starts getting sick.
“I know,” Harry answered, “they are for Ginny and Luna. They have herbology today.” Draco laughed, causing the other eight years to look at him with an angry look. The sound too loud for their hungover brains.
Harry hummed in acknowledgement, still kissing Draco’s neck. “You’re right,” he said, moving away from Draco. He pushed Draco until they were both sitting on the couch again. “We wouldn’t want that to happen again.” With that he grabbed his book from the table, hiding his smile behind the book. He had felt Draco’s excitement, even though he was warning Harry. He flipped to the page he was reading, only for the book to be ripped out of his hand.
“Then Luna wouldn’t be part of the family, but she is,” Neville pointed out. “To state it simply, the family is the bloodline. It’s the people who are of Malfoy magic, or those who carry a piece of Malfoy magic in themselves.” He said, “there are other families that are incorporated into the family, through marriage. Then usually the head of that family carries a piece of the Malfoy magic, after which he shares this with the other members of his family.”
“What spell?” he said, looking at the others, though they kept their mouth shut. “I can’t be sure it’s him,” he stated to his mother, she looked at him but nodded.
After a while, it seemed that the boys had decided on the art they wanted on the wall. They went back into the hallway, Sirius grabbing a few Sickles and Galleons.
“Just if they have names, they don’t.” he looked back at them and back up at Draco. “Aren’t they cute?” he asked. His eyes were focussed on the snake that had first spoken to him.
“Harry found me in a bathroom, crying and talking with Moaning Myrtle.” He breathed slowly, trying to not let too many emotions show, “He walked in, I tried to hurt him by casting a Crucio over at him, it hit him but didn’t do anything. He disarmed me and told me that he could help. He had apparently heard me tell Myrtle that I didn’t want to do what the Dark Lord had sent me to do.” He looked over to Harry who was listening patiently. “I gave him one day to find a way to convince me, that he could help me. The next night he brought me to Snape and Dumbledore. I told them about my mission, and they told me they could help me, even after hearing that. That was enough for me.”
“Sure,” Harry said, he didn’t want to take it off, but he knew that not doing it would take too much attention to it. He took it from his finger and handed it to Hermione, “careful,” he said, without thinking about it.
“Well,” Harry rubbed his hands to the back of his neck, it calmed him down, “she kissed me when we were hiding the book of the Prince.”
“Actually,” Harry said, “I was wondering if Draco and I could take a look in the library, I know there are a lot of dark arts book there, but we, well I, wanted to look into some history of some pureblood families, and I think that that would be a great place to look for it.”
“Great, the ones from France are the best,” he said, looking wistfully into the fire, “maybe I’ll even share with you.”
Harry laughs, ‟yeah.” He throws a handful of floo-powder into the hearth. ‟Thanks again.” He calls out his home, and steps through.
Draco lifts an eyebrow, ‟she just wants her kids to be happy,” he says, ‟and I think she´d like to have grandkids.”
Harry looked down. It was an old shirt he had used so many times it was almost thin, the very same one Draco had on yesterday. His pants were ripped, even though when he had gotten them they had no rips in them. He looked at Draco, smiling sheepishly. “I might need new clothing. Especially if I am to impress your snobbish friends.”
“Well not entirely, more like out here every night shagging some bloke.” He said it with a wink to Harry. Which in turn made him blush. Harry didn’t say anything, which seemed to make Draco nervous, “you don’t have a problem with that right?” he asked softly.
“Yes,” McGonagall said, her eyes twinkling much like they had when Harry told her about him and Draco. “The hearing is about to start, so let’s go inside.”
Harry saw what Draco was doing, and rolled over, reaching his hands to stop Draco from doing any more. “Can I suck you off too?” he asked.
Casting a second lubrication charm he coated Draco’s cock, eliciting small sounds from the man. He moved away again, crawling over his body so his hips were above Draco’s. With his hand holding Draco’s erection he lowered himself. Slowly he moved down, swearing at the stretch. Though familiar, still a bit painful.
An old elf popped out from nowhere. Bowing low to Draco. “Young master Draco,” he said, “I am glad to see you again.”
“Where is his wand?” she asked Bellatrix, who in turn turned around to the snatchers. Her eyes scanning their hands. Then she suddenly saw the sword. Her face contorted with rage.
“We are gathered here for the induction of heir Draco Malfoy,” an old Lady stated. She was sitting next to Augusta Longbottom. “Lady Narcissa Malfoy,” she said, nodding her head to the woman in question, “will be receding from her position as head of the family. Heir Harry Potter is here as a witness and informal spouse.”
‟I wanted to surprise my son,” Lucius says, ‟and to my surprise, he comes in with the boy he knocked up.” Lucius makes a tutting noise, ‟that´s not very well mannered.”
Hermione and Ron had already changed into the clothing they would be wearing during the ceremony. Hermione wearing a flowing dress that was completely black, except for the belt around her waist, which was the same dark green as Harry’s robes. Ron wore a black suit, with a green tie and green pocket square. His shirt was the same off white that matched the chairs outside.
The two continue talking, just the two of them, like before everything that happened. Harry smiles, happy to have his best friend by his side. He had been pulling back, and Harry had let him. But now they´re together again, and Harry feels like nothing could be better.
“Well, I think it is smart that you two resume the lessons,” Hermione said as she read through the letter, “We both know that what happened last semester can not happen again.” She looked up from the scrap of paper to see the sad look on Harry’s face, thinking about Sirius. “Oh Harry, you know it wasn’t your fault, but maybe more lessons would help it from happening again. I’m happy Snape has decided to help again.”
“How will we move it all though?” Harry asks, “I don’t imagine we will be using moving boxes for everything?”
She nodded in understanding, “no time like the present to figure it out,” she smiled, “but I actually came by to propose something.” The two men nodded, sitting down on their bed so Narcissa could take the chair in front of them.
“That is a lot of work,” Ron murmured, “but it’s nice to know you two have a project, or else you might start taking extra classes like Harry here.” The group laughed as Harry let out an indignant sound.
Draco shakes his head, walking over to a clothing rack “not my outfit for you. Besides Harry, you are an obscenely rich wizard, bonded to another obscenely rich wizard.” He feels Harry standing next to him, but keeps looking through the clothing, “You can buy one outfit that costs a bit much.” He looks up to look at Harry, “What is it, love?” Draco asks, seeing Harry looking pensive.
“Everyone knows you can’t dance,” Draco says, “We all saw you panicking during that first dance.” The group laughs, nodding. “Poor Patil, you must’ve stepped on her toes thousand of times. But,” He says, “don’t worry, you won’t have to lead this time.”
Slowly he pushed in, Harry and him groaning at the same time. He set a quick pace immediately. He pulled Harry’s leg onto his shoulder, creating more room. Every thrust he pushed past Harry’s prostate. It wasn’t long before Harry was moaning almost obscenely. His back was arching off the bed while he gripped the bedsheet with his left hand, the other stroking himself.
” he asked. He felt the snake moving down his arm to his hand. “So,” he said, still with his back to Hermione and Ron, “are you going to say anything?”
“I wanted to ask you about the dormitories,” he said, sitting down in front of her. She cocked her head, “mainly about the silencing spell.”
“I don’t know,” Seamus said, “you should probably think of a few and then ask him himself you know.”
A voice woke him from his sleep, “Harry,” he recognised it immediately and went to the broken mirror hoping that it was not just his mind playing a trick. When he looked he did not see the grey eyes he longed for looking back. “Turn around, Harry,” there the voice was again, he could recognise it in his sleep. Harry knew it had to be Draco and, when he turned around, the man was standing there. Harry almost ran up to him, throwing his arms around his neck, pulling him into a kiss.
“We’ll have that wedding,” Draco promised, “after the war, when everything died down, we’ll have a beautiful wedding. We’ll do everything you want.”
There´s no furniture, the chandelier that had hung there gone, broken to infinitesimal pieces when Dobby dropped it on the floor. Harry looks at Draco, and he sees the anxiety on his face. He and Draco have talked about that day and all the other things during and before the war more times than he could count. And he´d forgiven Draco, just as Draco had forgiven him for all the things, he´d did, or caused.
Draco nodded, grabbing Harry’s hand, “I understand,” he said, they started walking again, “but, please, don’t let that hold you back from doing what you want. Don’t refrain from living the life you want, the way you want, because of their death. Besides,” he said smiling, “I think they would have wanted you to live here if you wanted to. This would have been your home, hadn’t it been for the war. You would have moved into this home when it was time then as well, I imagine. ”
“Can we talk about something else now?” Harry asked when they stepped out of the common room. Ron shrugged, starting to talk about something he and Hermione had done in Australia. When they arrived at the table the whole group was staring at him, a look of concern on their faces. “If you’re all going to act like I’m fragile, I’m going to sit with Draco,” he said, they schooled their expressions sitting down. “I can’t be the only one with nightmares,” he wondered out loud.
“I’m not ashamed of sex,” he says, “it’s just that Harry is like a brother to me. You don’t hear me talking about it with Fred or George.”
She gives Harry an inquisitive look. ‟Somewhere in November, I suspect?” she says with a look towards his stomach.
Their magic settled around the sceptre, the sword now having given everything. Narcissa grabbed the sword setting it next to the two goblets. Harry moved his hands so both of them were now cupping the sceptre. They looked at one another again, pulling their own family magic inside their body.
There was a question from the raven, though Harry did not know the answer it seemed Cho did. They went in, he looked around. “Is there anything that shows the diadem?” he asks her. Wordlessly she points at the statue. He looks at it. He faintly recognises it, but he can’t figure out from where. He thanks Cho and leaves.
Harry rolled his hips up, in search of the friction they had felt just a moment ago, his hand not currently in Draco’s hair moving along the boy's body, grabbing his ass, pulling him closer to him. The hard contact caused Draco to gasp, moving back he put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, “Wait,” he said breathlessly.
Draco shakes his head with a smile. ‟Let´s go sleep,” he says to Harry, who doesn´t protest in the slightest.
‟I went to Hermione and Ron,” he says. Draco stills and Harry can see he´s taking care to not show too much on his face. Harry crawls into their bed, and he sits next to Draco. He grabs the book and Draco lets go of it with ease. He closes it before putting it on his own nightstand.
“Mate,” Ron said, “you are literally one of the most powerful wizards we know, and your Patronus is a stag. Maybe the kind of creature doesn’t say anything about power.” Hermione seemed inclined to agree.
“The spell in my room,” he said, “I kind of broke it?” he wasn’t sure if it was the right term. “I woke up from a bad dream,” he explained not wanting her to get the wrong idea, “and everyone kind of heard that?”
“I think I know someone that you would trust. Someone who could help you with both whatever the dark lord had given you as a task and who could help you stay safe.” Harry said, purposefully leaving out a name, to be safe that if Malfoy retreated in the morning that not the whole order nor said spy’s cover would be broken. “I can arrange a meeting with them tomorrow night.” He knew that if he went to dumbledore tonight to tell him it had to be possible.
The hospital wing fell silent when Harry walked in, Hermione ran up to Harry, “are you all right?” she asked, hugging him, Remus walked forward, Sirius was there, in dog form. Harry nodded, hugging Remus.
“Now, we have my family, the Malfoy line, it dates back millennia, but with millennia back that means many splits in the family. In the patriarchal society we live in, the males mainly kept their names. But some didn’t because, well, there wasn’t a stigma against homosexuals as in the muggle world. Every time the family had one head, the main branch so to speak. The oldest of the family that had kept the family name. That went on and on and on.”
‟But I can make it more comfortable,” Draco says, sitting down next to Harry and pulling the board on his lap. ‟Here,” he hands Harry´s plate with a smile. Harry squints at Draco, ‟you can do my closet if you want to help so badly,” Draco says.
Harry moved along, Grayback tried to attack him, but Harry stunned him too, moving along. He had to follow Draco and Snape, he had to. No one could know, but they all would know he was there. He came down the stairs, he couldn’t not go after them.
“Heir Potter,” he said, bowing, “it is good to meet the man that captured my master's heart.” Draco looked shocked at that statement, which caused the elf to laugh. “Yes young master, I realized you were bonded the moment you stepped back into this home that night. Your magical signature had changed. Do not worry, only a personal elf would be able to tell.” Draco nodded. “Is it your elf that is removing the books in the library?” Lucien asked Harry. Who nodded in response. “She told me the address of the manor you are moving into,” he said, “do you wish to move all your belonging there, young master?”
Harry regretted telling Malfoy to come to the room of requirement 15 minutes before the appointment. Now he would have to do some small talk with the other boy. He had not thought about that enough. Nor had he really thought how he was going to do this. The only thing he had decided was that the spell that they were going to preform would be between Malfoy, Snape and Harry.
‟Yeah,” Draco says, ‟we can buy it.” McGonagall gives him a smile, ‟We should probably find a place to talk about the price and contract.”
“Hey Harry,” Seamus called, when the two separated, “settle something for us, who were you flipping off during the fireworks? Dean says it was Voldemort, but I say it’s someone else. Your boy here won't tell us.”
“You too!” Draco called after her. Which caused more people to look again, Draco blushed lightly at the attention. He did his best not to let his mask slip on his face, knowing that the people needed to see he wasn’t a posh boy that didn’t know how people actually interacted.
“Hey, none of that.” Harry said, pulling Draco’s focus to himself, “you did only what you had to do to survive, much like me. You aren’t the only one that has done some unforgivable things for that. There was a war going on, and you staying in the manor and being a spy was what probably saved us in the end.” Draco nodded, it wasn’t the first time they had had that conversation.
The spell from Draco bounced off Harry’s shield. The red glow showed it to be a stunner. The rebound flickered out. They moved, walking back and forth, the one trading defensive for offensive spells. They reacted before the first one had thrown the first spell. Harry realised if it went on like this the one that won would be the one who kept it up the longest, most likely him. So the next time Draco send a spell over to him, instead of casting a defensive he threw an expeliarmus at him, hoping that Draco’s spell would either miss or be a similar spell. Draco’s spell hit him almost the same time Harry’s hit Draco. Both their wands flew into the air. Harry caught Draco’s, and Draco’s caught Harry’s.
Ron nods, before grabbing his own homework, probably bullied into doing it by Hermione. He gives one longing look to his own bed before he leaves Harry alone.
When Harry arrives in his dorm room, Ron is luckily not there. Harry goes to lie down with a book, and seconds later Ron walks in, looking worried. He spots Harry, ‟Harry! There you are,” he looks around, ‟you said you were going to take a nap, but when I got up here you were gone. I was worried mate.”
Amelia Bones walked into the courtroom, causing the whole room to fall silent. “We are here today for the disciplinary hearing of Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Fenrir Greyback and Thorfinn Rowle. They have all been accused of plotting and abetting in the murder of Albus Dumbledore. Amycus and Alecto Carrow are accused of the use of unforgivables on underage students and making other people use them. Fenrir Greyback is also accused of the slaughter of Lavender Brown, the attack of muggle-born and halfblood wixen through the groups known as snatchers, the attempted kidnapping of Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas, Harry Potter and the late goblin known as Griphook and the leading of what is known as the Werewolf Army.”
He turned the stone three times. He looked up to see his parents in front of him. His eyes filled with tears. He finally saw them.
The three of them looked at each other. Harry motionless. He felt stupid, how could he ever expect to live a full life. How could he expect that if he managed to destroy the Horcruxes that he would survive? He thought of all the things he had not been able to do. But he did not dwell on them. He looked at his hands. They were empty, without the ring there, bare.
When Harry asks Hermione about it the next day, she neither confirms nor deny the claim, which for Harry is as good as a confirmation. He thanks her and she just rolls her eyes.
‟Don´t start the baby’s name discussion now,” Neville says, ‟I watched one with my aunt and uncle. It was brutal.” Harry snorts, holding his hands up in the air.
Harry looked in the mirror. His hair was styled. It was still pretty messy, but now it actually looked like it was purposely messy instead of a birds nest. Hermione and Draco really were right, the eyeliner looked nice. Harry moved his head, his eyes flitting between his hair and his eyes.
Ron fakes throwing up, which got him a stern look from Hermione. Harry and Draco laughed at that. They continued studying after that. When Harry and Draco fell in bed that night, exhausted from their study session, they cuddled close.
‟I guess you don´t,” he says. Draco takes the first bite, and he makes a face. Harry laughs, ‟what´s wrong?”
Draco arrived not much later when the three of them sat down, Dumbledore started the conversation. “May I assume that this is about my impending assassination?” he asked. The two boys nodded.
“It’s strange,” Luna said, “being back here, but not having to also think about the DA and all that you know. I have gotten so used to sneaking around, and to hiding that now that I don’t have to I feel like I have all the time in the world.” Harry nodded, he felt like that too.
“We aren’t friends though,” Draco said, not knowing what to say. He wasn’t used to talking to the Irish boy.
“Draco,” he whispered knowing the boy didn’t like to be shaken awake, “Draco,” he called louder, “Love, wake up.” Draco’s eyes flew open, his breath was ragged. When his breathing slowed down he looked over to Harry.
He saw many shocked faces, even that of Lucius when he explained what the diary had really been. Amelia asked about their time in Malfoy manor, but Harry told her that he had not met Lucius at that time, as Draco had gotten him and the others out of there. His eyes focused on Amelia, the only person in the Wizengamot he really knew or at least recognized as a familiar face.
She appears a few moments later, she takes one look at him before telling him to go through. He steps through the floo. It´s late he knows that he doesn´t know what time but he only got home around ten. Hermione ties her bathrobe closer to her body. ‟Harry,” she says concern evident in her voice, ‟what´s wrong?”
Narcissa nods, ‟I hope you continue the tradition, of naming children to stars and flowers.” She smiles, ‟I really think it gives them unique names.”
“Look, Harry, tell me what you are going to take, I need to pack it because we are going with you.” Harry opened his mouth but Hermione didn’t let him speak. “We know what we are doing, we have both been preparing.”
When he wakes up, he finds Draco sleeping deeply next to him. He can´t lie on top of Harry anymore, but he´s half draped over him, their legs tangled and his head on Harry´s shoulder. It´s very late at night, and he wishes he could just turn around and close his eyes again. But he can´t, instead, he extracts himself from Draco´s octopus hold and goes off to the bathroom.
“So,” Remus said, “help it, help his magic float.” Draco’s eyes flew open, the question evident in his eyes. “Concentrate on the connection between your magic and his. It’s strong. Both of you are strong, stronger than many.” He paused. “feel that bond, and pull it, pull it up. Save it from drowning, save it from leaving your body and the world.”
“You know,” Seamus adds, “without the worry of having to find a date, it actually sounds fun. I remember dreading finding a date.” He looks at his boyfriend, “now that’s not needed.” The group nods.
He moved through the gap, into the cell, moving to the figure. Harry recognised him, even though the handsome features had gone, as had the playfulness. “You have come, but your journey is pointless, I never had it.” The man said, Harry heard Voldemort bellow, “you lie.”
“That’s because I didn’t need it,” Harry said petulantly, “who was I going to impress, my aunt and uncle?” Hermione’s lips went into a tight line, he shrugged, “you can come too if you want to help buy me clothes.” She looked at Draco, who just shrugged.
Draco shrugs, “I like being there for you Harry. And it’s not like you and I are never without each other. I do things with my friends, you with yours. Yeah, we’re together a lot, but it’s not any different from how Luna and Neville are together or Hermione and Ron.”
Then came a memory that shocked all three of them. They were in Dumbledore’s office, Snape sitting in front of him. “There will be a time when Voldemort will fear for his snake. He will protect it at all cost. When he knows Harry has destroyed the Horcruxes. Then it is time to tell him.”
“No,” Harry said, “even though sneaking around was kind of fun, I will rather be able to sit in the common room and lean against you while reading. I’ll tell them tomorrow, Ginny as well, might get her to back off.”
“Most of the time the people will become part of the most powerful family, so they would all become part of the noble family. Though the people can still choose to not be part of their family,” he said, “you see, that is what happened when Andromeda married Ted. She made a choice to not be part of her family anymore, their magic was focused on Ted's. Though, I don’t think her staying in the family would’ve been accepted.”
“Well, he really doesn’t like me, but at least he isn’t trying to make me a, what did dumbledore call them, a trophy.” Ron said grimacing, he looked away from the table to his right, “Oh god, I really do not need to see my sister going on a date,” Ron said disgusted, “and now they are snogging,” he threw his hands in the air, “does she have any common decency.” He slowly turned his head to Harry, who, too, was now looking at Ginny. “Talking about my sister snogging, when were you going to tell me you kissed my sister?” he demanded.
Hermione looked up, she nodded. Draco was still focused. Harry knocked him on his shoulder, “Hey,” he said, rubbing the place he just got knocked, “what did I do?”
‟Not that you won’t get property by marrying me,” Harry points out. He´s leaning against the wall with a smile.
“Of course Harry,” Hermione said, “we would love to be there.” Ron nodded. Harry smiled, thankful for such great friends.
“Not just me,” Harry said shrugging, “Draco is pretty good at it as well.” Draco shrugged when his two friends looked at him. Blaise and Pansy just looked at them perplexed. “You know,” Harry said to Draco, “I think this is going rather well.” Draco lets out a laugh.
“You headmaster said you had a husband?” Mister Granger said, “so that’s allowed in the wizarding world?”
“Instead,” Draco said, continuing for him, “he lived. Love,” he said, “is powerful magic. Bonding magic is strong magic, the stronger the casters the stronger the bond. We all know Harry is powerful, so our bond is strong. That night I felt it when the curse hit him. I felt his magic wither, move. Sirius and Remus were with me.” He paused, taking a breath. “I pulled him back, he was dying, his magic manic inside himself. Trying to destroy itself. I didn’t know what was happening. But Sirius and Remus told me to focus on his magic, try to calm it down.” He looked over at Harry, “it worked, I managed to calm his magic down, and with that, he didn’t die.”
“But Dumbledore knew,” Harry said, “he knew I was raised by muggles, so why didn’t he say anything?”
Harry nods, and they all take a seat. Neville is sitting closest to Harry, Ron on the other side. Harry takes a deep breath. ‟So,” he says, ‟there are a few things I need to tell you all.” He frowns, unsure where to start.
Harry laughs awkwardly, biting into the skin around his thumb. She gives him a stern look, and he drops his hand. She sighs directing him to one of the beds and casting a privacy charm around them. ‟So, what brings you here?” she says looking at him.
“The first Hogsmeade weekend of the year,” Ron said, “I told them, it’s the best marketing strategy because everyone knows the Wizard Wheezes now, and if you open up then the students are definitely going to show up. Any other day and only sixth year and up will come because only they can go to Hogsmeade on other Saturdays.”
With still some time on their hands, the boys walked around Hogsmeade together. They decided to buy some of their Christmas gifts already. Harry was surprised with how many people they had bought gifts for in the end. Though, with the whole Weasley family and their friends together they already had 18 people, not even counting Sirius and Remus, or any other order members or Draco’s mother.
“So,” Harry said when they got back to the dorms that afternoon. “I got to say, I would rather take your name than not be part of your family.”
“I stabbed it with the fang of the Basilisk,” Harry said, “which was the monster of Slytherin by the way. It caused the piece of Riddle to leave Ginny. I think Dumbledore now has it.” Draco nodded at that.
Harry’s face lit up, “you mean my father?” The man shrugged but nodded. “I would love that then.” He looked at Draco with a smile. “Would it be appropriate if you wore one as well? Unless you don’t want to?”
“Huh,” Harry said, “I didn’t realise it.” He looked at Draco, “do you mind it when I do?” Draco shook his head, “cool, let's go look at the snakies then.” He smiled, and Draco went down the path again, walking towards the snakes.
Harry nodded. It was not like he understood, not really. He never expected his family to be there, as he didn’t have any family when he was younger. And after that, he knew all his friends and his own made family would always be there. “You wish he could have been there, even after everything he did?” There was still no accusation in his voice, not even confusion. The curiosity had been traded for understanding.
The group went up flights of stairs, leading to a tower that had been unused during their six years at Hogwarts. “Welcome to the eight-year common room,” McGonagall said, having given the gargoyle protecting the door their password. “There are individual rooms for everyone, though,” she said with a smile, “no one will check if they are used,” the group snickered at that.
When Harry took a sip he felt that getting the memory from Slughorn’s office would be as easy as flying. “well,” Harry said looking at his two friends, “I’m going to go to Hagrid, I’ll help him burry Aragog.” His friends looked at him like he had grown a second head.
“There is nothing you can help me with,” she answered, “I just finished gathering all the things we need for the ceremony.” She grabbed the book from the table, putting it in her bag. Harry nodded, leaving her to get ready on her own.
Harry and Draco both shake their heads, ‟you realise we both also only know it for a week now,” Harry says, ‟haven´t even thought about it yet.” Draco gives him an unbelieving stare. ‟Okay, maybe I have,” he says defensively, causing their friends to laugh.
The doors opened again and the people were called in. The verdict was fast much like Lucius’. All four of them had been sentenced to life in Azkaban. It wasn’t really a surprise as most of them should have been in prison for their crimes in the first wizarding war. With the verdict placed, the group came back to their school. All of them were exhausted from the trial. It had stretched on late into the evening, and they only ate their dinner before all went to bed.
“I agree,” Pansy said, “I don’t know what you have done during the war, Draco. But I know you, and you may be a bastard, but you’re not someone who likes to hurt people just because.”
“If you all would excuse me,” she said lightly, “I am going to greet my cousin.” She nodded her head at the others, flashing a small smile to her son and Harry before walking out.
“Whatever you promised him, Harry, be careful. Know that whatever you do, be careful what you promise a Goblin. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a Goblin.” Harry nodded, silently thinking that he was doing the two things at the same time.
They made a pit stop at Grimmauld place, changing their clothes, to a more suitable club atmosphere. Harry walked out of his room, wearing a yellow crop top, over black baggy pants, chains hanging on his hips. Draco having put on dress pants and a mesh shirt, though there were enough flowers on it, that both his mark wasn’t too visible nor his body in general. It was something they both had worn to a club before, knowing it would fit with the crowd.
“But what I don’t understand, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only rip your soul apart once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, have your soul in more pieces? I mean, for instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn’t seven-? “
‟There are some chairs and beds, mostly just warded against breaking and creaking.” He shrugs, ‟if there is something specific you´re looking for, just send an owl and I can ask around. I´ll let you have a look.”
Dobby nodded, leaving. Seconds later the items appeared on Draco’s nightstand. Harry moved over to the tea, grabbing one mug. He looked at the food on the plate but didn’t grab anything. Draco grabbed his mug. The tea was just warm enough, not too hot but ready to be drunk.
Draco smiled down at Harry, his hand stroking his cheek, “when we walked through it,” he said, his voice almost a whisper, “I could imagine it. Us, living there. Our friends coming and going whenever they felt like it. Spending days in the library, reading together. Maybe, when we’re older, kids running around. It’s the life I imagine when I cast a Patronus.”
“Fuck if I know,” Harry said, creating confused faces, “couldn’t let little Tom know, so I couldn’t know.” He shrugged, tapping his mind.
“Sure,” He turned to Sirius, “ready?” the other man nodded. Their duel lasted not as long as Harry’s and Draco’s. They moved in sync as well, and they reacted before anyone could see something happen, but when one of them lost their wand the game was over. They tried to use wandless magic, but even though they managed something, it wasn’t strong enough to actually do anything. In the end, Remus stupefied Sirius, casting a finite seconds later.
They ended up in the library where there was a beautiful chess set that Ron was eager to try out. “So,” Harry said, moving another piece, “did you talk to your brothers about wanting to work in the joke shop in Hogsmeade?”
“Nope,” Harry said, “though I want him to choose his own name. I had made a list, but Draco pointed out that it might be nice to go through a book with him.” He looked at the guy around his wrist. “Maybe an Indian name, if he’d like.”
Harry suddenly remembered where he saw it before. It was when he and Ginny were hiding his book. “It's in the room of lost things! I saw it when Ginny and I were hiding the book.” They sped of racing to the room. They came into the room all the kids were being taken out of. They met Ginny and Neville’s grandmother there. “Is everyone gone?” he asked.
“The only year you didn’t?” Draco asked incredulously, “but he’s only been back since fourth? How eve-, you know what just tell me later.” Sirius clapped the boy on his back, all four sitting at the kitchen table.
“I think,” Dumbledore said, “that Riddle felt more connected to the school than he let people know. He felt connected, it was his first home,” he looked at Harry, “he found many secrets, and there were probably, even more, he could find out if he had worked here. That brings us to our next memory, this memory is mine, around ten years later.”
“I’m not going away forever,” he told Molly, “I’m just going home. I’ll come over soon,” this seemed to calm her a bit.
Soon they were both coming, white streaks painting their chest and the blanket. Harry cast a quick cleaning spell, they lay looking at each other, catching their breath. They basked in the moonlight and each others loving eyes. They didn’t move again until they heard doors opening and closing in the hallway.
McGonagall nods, ‟we´ll switch your roommates, so you two are in the same dorm room,” she says, ‟I´m sure Poppy can take care of the potions you should be taking.”
The group disbanded all going back to their rooms, getting ready for the feast. It was almost six already when they arrived in the dorms. There were enough showers for everyone, so they at least did not have to wait for each other.
“If you know where it is in the general vicinity we should be able to find it, especially since I know the exact space.” Sirius said, “now that you read the address and with your Potter magic, you should be able to find the manor.”
“We can’t tell you that,” it was Harry talking this time, “the spell we had done, only permitted us to tell you two that he was part of the order and that he was a spy. We can’t tell you what the mission is, Dumbledore’s orders.”
McGonagall nodded in understanding. “We will be using the floo network to go to the ministry, Lady Malfoy will meet us there,” she told Draco, “and we will move to the courtroom after that.”
Snape walked forward and roughly pushed Draco out of the way. All the death eaters cowered beside him, even Fenrir and Bellatrix. Dumbledore pleaded, for many, it would seem to plead for his life, but he could see the look in his eyes, Dumbledore was pleading for his death.
After the next Transfiguration lesson, Sirius came up to them, asking if they had thought about their conversation. They told him, that Harry would be the last Potter, and that they were both okay with that.
“You can’t let that happen, Harry,” Hermione said, “you need to use Occlumency, Dumbledore wanted you to!”
Harry looked back to Draco, to see the boy looking at Harry already. Instead of letting Draco question anything of the Rooms actions, Harry kissed him again, something Draco was all too eager to return to. He slowly moved back, one hand behind him to tell him when he was close to the mattress. Draco moved with him. When his hand met the mattress Harry pulled Draco along to the middle of the bed.
“Harry,” Dumbledore started, not waiting for Draco, “I wanted to ask if the intel you have gathered from mister Malfoy has been informative,” Harry opened his mouth to explain it but realised he couldn’t, so he nodded instead, “Ah yes the spell you performed, but that’s okay I don’t need to know the information, I know most of it most probably through Snape either way.” They heard a knock on the door. “Come in Mister Malfoy,” Dumbledore said smiling.
“As long as you guys visit us at least once a week that is,” Sirius said. Harry let out a happy sound, glad that two of the most important people in his life wanted nothing more than him to be happy. “When would you guys want to move?” he asked.
“In my defence, I didn’t know you guys were in a relationship.” Ron said, “I just thought you two were very reluctant allies or something.” The group laughed, just as the sound of the owls arriving came cascading down. Harry had been right, he had only gotten some congratulations from people in the order. Kingsley saying he was happy for them, Andromeda saying she had hoped they were together as they really fit together.
“You’re only saying that so you can claim the same if I win,” Draco said, to which Harry only nodded smiling smugly.
Not everyone had been as lucky, another order member, Harry had not known him personally, had died in the battle, killed by an unknown Death Eater. That death made Harry realise that even the best trained, even those who knew where they were stepping in to, were going to die. It made him realise, that not only had Voldemort returned, but the war had also begun. That had been the first battle.
Harry flushes, ‟you won´t really like me with breast.” Draco frowns, ‟Dray, you´re the gayest man I know. Breasts and being pregnant don´t say I´m a man.”
“That’s why,” Harry said, “after the ministry, we won't go back here. I can’t stop this Hermione, I tried, believe me, I wish I didn’t have to see him murder out a family, but I do, so we need to use it.” He paused looking at Ron and Hermione, “So from the ministry, we won't come back here. As the secret keeper, I don’t know what will happen if he looks through my mind to this house. Do you have anything that will let us camp somewhere?”
“Harry, Hermione,” he greeted the two, “How good to see both of you! And Weasley, pleasure.” The three smiled at him. “I have decided to throw a little yuletide party just before we leave for home for Yule. I would like to invite both of you, bring a date if you like!” With that he nodded at both of them, ignoring Ron almost entirely, and left.
“Harry,” Sirius said, “just ask us, the worst thing we can say is that we don’t want you to get it.”
“I would’ve at least expected Sirius to explain it to you,” he said to Harry, “he’s the Heir now. For god’s sake, we live in the townhouse of the noble and most ancient house of Black. How didn’t you guys know?”
Harry laughs, ‟it´s a bit different than the weird sisters,” Harry says. He puts the needle on the vinyl. The first song starts and Harry mouths along with the song. Draco watches Harry moves around the room, opening another box. His hips sway with the beat of the music.
‟I have a check-up appointment tomorrow,” Harry says, causing Neville to squint. ‟She wanted to make sure it really was just something benign.” Neville gives a short nod, ‟don´t worry Nev, I´m just going to rest here for a second. I´ll see you in the common room.”
“Yeah,” Ron said, “they’re thinking of opening a shop in Hogsmeade, so I thought they could use some help. I also like to do something that is fun, you know, we’ve dealt with so much sadness.” Harry and Draco nodded.
“As Draco said, for the Slytherin prince and Gryffindor’s golden boy,” Harry repeated, getting an elbow in the side from Draco. But both Sirius and Remus burst out laughing. “But to answer your question Moony, when you asked if I wanted to live here I looked at Draco because, well, I want to live here, but I don’t want to do anything Draco doesn’t want to.”
He was thinking, he needed to know what the diadem looked like, it might help. He ran up to the towers, he looked at everyone that he came past, searching for a Ravenclaw. Finally, he found Cho Chang. He ran up to her. “Cho, I need to get into your common room!” She looked at him confused but ran away calling for him to follow. Together they went up the stairs.
“Not really,” Harry said, “they’re nice. And Sirius likes to have his family close. Besides, it’s not like they ever want to step into that manor again.” Dean just hummed in acknowledgement.
His hands were still on Harry’s tie, which he quickly removed, tossing it somewhere into the room, uncaring where it landed. Harry copied Draco, pulling the taller boy's tie off. Draco moved on to Harry’s blouse, buttoning it slowly. The lower his hands moved the lower his mouth, trailing from Harry’s mouth to his neck to his revealed chest. He kissed the scar, kissed around it.
Harry walked closer towards it, trying to read the engraving. Draco came to stand beside him, “Sanctimonia Vincet Semper,” he said. “It’s the Malfoy motto, father always translated it as Purity will always Conquer.” He paused, “I like to think it was meant to translate to Charity will always triumph.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, “why didn’t you tell us about that? You have been keeping so much to yourself, especially with the lessons from Snape now.”
“My husband,” Narcissa said, “is a passionate man. He is proud of his family, of his power and of what his power could mean to him and who he deems important.” She looked at the Wizengamot, her head held high. “During my life with him, we have made a lot of mistakes, as everyone does. However, during my son's life, he has changed. During his early years, he was a kind man, a man that cared for the family. Who cared for everything it stood for. But during the last seven or so years, this changed. He became greedy, he wanted more power. He pledged his life to a dark lord in the first war, thinking it would give him power.
, his head protruding from Harry’s coat as he spoke. “We should go back to the castle,” Harry said to Draco, “get him installed and all that.”
“Harry,” Ginny says, “you, uh, don’t live with Malfoy. You can barely stand him.” She looks at Draco, “what the hell did you say to him,” she hisses at him.
“I will need a drop of your blood,” the goblin said, “one drop will show us if you really are Harry Potter. After last year,” the goblin said looking pointedly, “we changed the procedure.” Harry looked at both Draco and Sirius, who nodded. The goblin produced a piece of paper, with the name potter written in cursive. He handed Harry a pin.
‟Yeah,” Draco says, ‟it´s actually been a name I´d wanted for a longer time.” He laughs softly, ‟I´ve always wanted to name my heir Scorpius.”
“And you to the Potter and Evans family,” Harry said smiling. He grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him out of his room, both boys going down.
‟Yeah,” Harry says, ‟I mean I didn´t even know it was possible. I guess I was kind of in shock at first. Had no idea what to think or do,” he shakes his head, ‟but Draco helped,” he says with a smile towards him.
‟I´d love to then,” Draco says, and Narcissa leads them down the stairs, into a room Harry is sure has been used for potions for a very long time. Draco and his mother talk endlessly about the things there and after a few moments, Harry touches Draco´s arm to signal him going. Draco acknowledges him with a nod before turning back to his mother.
“Hey,” Draco whispered Thursday night, he turned on his side to look at Harry, “you awake?” Harry hummed softly, letting Draco know he could speak. “Can we talk for a second?”
Harry’s hands were roaming along Draco’s body, nails scraping his back lightly. Draco’s hand were trailing down Harry’s sides, the lower they came, the wider Harry opened his legs for Draco. Draco moved away from Harry, causing Harry to whine. Draco chuckled grabbing one of their wands from the floor. Moving back between Harry’s thighs. He grabbed a pillow, “up,” he ordered, Harry lifting his hips instantly. Draco moved the pillow beneath him.
Two days before Christmas the four of them went to Diagon Alley. Harry wanted to go to his family vault as had Sirius. Both Draco and Remus went along for their respective partners. Harry was nervous when he walked in. It was the first time he came back after robbing the bank. He wasn’t sure how the goblins would react to him. They walked over to a free teller.
“Ready?” Draco asked, Harry breathed out a shaky breath. He nodded, turning the doorknob, opening the room. Together they stepped into the room.
Once Harry gave up on the painting, he grabbed a book to read. Draco continuing to pain, together in silence. Draco peeked over the easel to look at Harry every few minutes.
“You can try on mine,” Luna offered. She glided down, sitting next to Hannah, “if you don’t mind me using your nail polish,” she added to Hannah, who shook her head handing over the black polish to Harry.
“Ron, most of the muggle world, mainly the western part, is against same-sex. They believe that it's against nature.”
“I love you, Draco,” he said, “be safe.” And with that, the man walked out of his room, and he was gone.
It took him almost no time to find the dots with Malfoys name. It seemed that he was walking along the seventh floor. Harry looked at the dot as it vanished, that meant he could only be in one place, the Room of Requirement. He knew that following Malfoy now would only cause more problems, he wasn’t as oblivious as everyone seemed to think.
“9.45 in the Room of Requirement, same room” He answered, also still looking at the books. His eyes fell on one of the books. He felt Malfoy walking behind him, walking back to his friends. Harry waited and picked up the book he had been staring at during their short meet up. After a few seconds he walked out, seeing that Malfoy was again working.
Kingsley inhaled sharply. Harry continued, telling about how Voldemort created another, Nagini, after his resurrection. Then he explained how they encountered the first Horcrux, the diary. He told Kingsley the story of their second year. Hermione and Ron jumping in to explain things that Harry forgot. Hermione explaining about how the monster was a basilisk, and how she realised so.
“Let’s play truth or drink!” Seamus said, “because truth or dare is boring.” The group collectively shrugged agreeing. Seamus grabbed a bottle spinning it. It landed on Ron, “have you ever fancied a bloke?” Seamus asked. Ron thought for a second before answering he had. “What! Who?” Seamus asked. “You know it’ll be the next question anyway.”
“Right! Did you see how much money Sirius and McGonagall received? Apparently, there had been a teacher’s bet about it,” Seamus said gleefully, “though they were cheating, they both knew.”
When Harry was back into the common room he sat down, opening the book about taking care of snakes first. Draco grabbed his own book sitting next to him, though there was enough space between them for another person. Said place was quickly occupied by Seamus.
“Okay,” Draco said, relief evident in his voice, “Good luck Harry.” With that, he was gone from the mirror. Harry went to his trunk, rooting around it and grabbed the flask of Felix Felicis. Hermione and Ron immediately recognised it.
Draco has already cleared most knickknacks from his room. The picture frames, the notebooks. After breakfast, Harry puts his clothes in a box. It takes around three boxes before Harry has finally taken out all Draco´s clothing, and that´s not even counting the watches and other jewellery.
“He’s a foreign wandmaker. Krum’s wand had been made by him,” he looked at Ron, “that’s why I thought of Quidditch.”
“No,” Harry said, “We should go to the great hall, every student, with me included. The rest of the order stays. They’ll come in later. We need every advantage we have to overthrow the Carrows.” It seemed the rest agreed if their cheers were anything to go by. He looked over to Draco, beaconing him.
‟Malfoy Manor,” Ron answers. Harry gives Ron a startled look. ‟Dean, Luna and Hermione all agreed. It´s being held in the gardens.”
They both had looked through their closets, finding something nice for Ron to wear. First, he had refused, but when Harry and Draco came out of their room, he caved, saying he wouldn’t fit in with the clothing he was wearing. Hermione had transfigured her outfit, as she was already wearing a dress she had made it more close-fitting, enhancing her figure.
When he checked everything was empty he cast the silencing spell on the door. “I won’t be going to school next year,” he said, Hermione and Ron nodded, Ginny just looked at him. “I need to finish what Dumbledore started,” he looked at his two best friends.
‟Yeah,” he answers her silent question, ‟he asked me to marry him.” Ron splutters but with an elbow in his side from Hermione and a look from Ginny he stays silent. Harry smiles looking at the ring.
Harry smiles, nodding in agreement. When they go down into the common room, they see that most of their friends are already off to their own bed. There´s just Neville and Luna hugging on the couch.
“I don’t know,” he confessed, “I was so happy that he was in jail in our sixth year. And I am happy that he isn’t here now. But, I don’t know how I’ll feel once I see him after his stint in Azkaban. He looked awful when he was broken out, and I felt sorry for him then. I’m happy you’ll be by my side though,” he smiled, “show the bastard that he can’t have it all the way he wants it. His son, married to the man that brought down the Dark Lord.”
He folds two, putting them in separate envelopes. He hands one to Harry who writes the name of his contract holder, Draco doing the same for his own. The third one he folds, ‟for McGonagall,” he says. Harry nods. ‟I´ll bring them to the owlery now,” Draco says.
Harry talks to Sirius and Remus, and the next time he mails Molly, he asks her to come to Grimmauld place during Christmas. When she accepts, he tells Narcissa, explaining how much they mean to him and how much they have done for him. Narcissa writes back, telling him that she is glad he found his own family, telling him that she’s happy that they are coming, even if she and Molly never got along before.
Both Draco and Harry got dressed. Draco was standing in front of a mirror, doing his hair when they heard a knock on their door. Harry opened it, to see Hermione standing in front of him. “Can you help me Draco?” she called out.
Yay, they finally know that Draco ain't a bad guy! But he doesn't get a warm welcome, not that he had expected it.
“Now I would like to call forward Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin first class,” there was a hush around the room. Though it had been silent during the trial, only now there was complete silence. Harry walked forward sitting in the designated chair. “State your name and affiliation to the accused.”
‟I think mum would buy it from you,” Draco answers, ‟though, it kind of defeats the purpose, because that would mean it would be ours again after she dies.”
He was right they were standing there, looking around wand raised. “Did you two destroy it?” they nodded. “I know what the diadem looks like.” He said.
‟I wasn´t afraid,” Draco says, and Harry gives him a sceptical look. ‟I wasn´t afraid for me,” he amends, ‟but I don´t want him to hurt you. I know he would never physically hurt you, but he has a way with words.”
Lucky for Harry, Ron had thought that he would be too preoccupied with tonight, so during lunch, they could talk about the possible training they could do. Harry was happy that he still could talk to his friends, even though he had to keep this big secret from them. During the day he acted the same as he used to, well he tried to at least. He had seen Hermione looking at him strangely multiple times. Though that might be from all the avoiding of Ginny he was doing. She had seen him watching Ginny when he had still liked her, something that was quickly cured by that kiss.
“Why do you want to know more about him?” Hermione asked, “I mean, I understand wanting to, believe me, but why is it important to find out more about him now?” She stood, “Is this about the book from Rita?” she asked. Harry looked away from her piercing gaze. “Harry, if you want to know what she knows, you might as well just read the book. Obviously, she won't tell you anything Rita won’t have written down. I really think it would be too difficult to join go to the village. I am sure that they are keeping watch in Godric’s Hallow.”
“Why would you?” Dean asked “I thought he was like a mentor to you? You even named the DA after him.” He saw the others nod.
Harry and Draco looked at each other laughing slightly. Not long after they were served their food, a butterbeer to accompany it. They thanked her profusely. The snake moved down Harry’s arm at the smell of the food. “
It´s still a mess full of boxes, but their house feels already more like home. After fishing dinner, Kreacher reappears taking their plates to clean. Harry wants to protest, but he doesn´t. Not when Draco leads him into their new living room and starts unpacking their boxes with vinyls.
The last school day of the week was always Harry’s favourite. They had potions today, he had never expected to say he would like to go to potions. But here he was, actually enjoying it. It was probably because it was so much like cooking. It was all measuring and combining. When there wasn’t a teacher who hated you, looming over your shoulder and every move you made, it was actually quite pleasant.
“I think we should go to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry said that next day. “Not only because of my parents,” he added when he saw the way Hermione was looking. “Bathilda Bagshot also lives there. She lived there in the time of Dumbledore. She might know more about him.”
The sun sank behind the horizon, the moon shining brightly in the sky. There was snow visible when they drove through deserted landscapes. It was late when they arrived at kings cross. Harry and Draco walking over to Molly and Arthur, together with Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Luna. They said goodbye to Neville and Hannah, both off to their respective parents, much like Seamus and Dean.
Harry broke the kiss off, looking into the stormy grey eyes addled with lust. His green eyes, now mostly black with his dilated pupils, staring back. He only nodded, signalling his lover that he was ready. Draco picked up his wand again, adding more lube and adding a protection spell. He looked back again, making sure, and Harry once again nodded.
“I knew you’d come! I knew it Harry!” he said, “Can’t wait to see everyone’s face. I kept telling Seamus it was only a matter of time.”
The trio had decided to do some homework when they got back, much to both Harry and Ron’s chagrin, it would be the only way for them to get help from Hermione so they relented. “I have to get something from the room, I’ll meet you two in the library.” With that he ran upstairs, moving fast along the halls, he used some short cuts to find his way to the headmaster’s office. He saw that the stairs were open, and he climbed it fast.
“Well it does get confusing if you combine explaining the concept of magical family relations and the concept of the family business at the same time,” Neville said. “Not even every noble family has such a business. Though I guess there are big corporations in the muggle world,” Draco nodded. “I never thought how to explain it. It’s just something we know,” he said. Draco nodded again.
He was walking over to them, the twins and Angelina appearing in the garden as well. He had a smile on his face, and his voice was joking. “It’s good to see you guys again,” he said, pulling Ron and Harry into a hug. They hugged briefly before he turned to Draco. “I hope you aren’t an arse anymore.”
“What?” He asked, “Oh this?” he said pointing at his face. “this is nothing, Seamus is worse, you’ll see.” He paused for a second listening, and called out, “Ab, there are a few people coming. They’ll apparate directly into the bar, just, you know, show them the tunnel.” They heard the man grumble, but acknowledge the request. Neville turned back to his friends, “let’s get going.”
Harry nods, happy that the man is explaining everything. The man does as he said and when he turns the screen towards Harry and Draco, they both grip each others’ hands. There is their little child. Harry can see the small hands and feet. ‟It kind of looks like a bean,” he says.
‟Ron, shut up,” Ginny says. ‟Can´t you see Harry has something else to say?” Run grumbles something but he falls silent, ‟Harry,” Ginny says, ‟what else is there?” She flicks an eye to the ring and back towards his face.
Remus and Sirius looked at one another, both unsure. “I know it’s not been done yet,” Remus said, “but, I don’t think it’s possible either. We aren’t really talking about changing a whole family. It is creating a new noble family, creating one family from two. To be able to do that, you’d have to get your family to accept it, you’d have to get the whole House of Lords and Lady’s to accept. And how much I would like to say that they would, do you really think the Flint, The Rosier, or The Bulstrode family would accept it?”
Seamus laughed, “interesting to see Harry kick your butt,” Draco looked at him with one eyebrow raised, “what, you think you can beat him after he beat Voldemort?”
“I think Nagini, is the last one, the way she acts, even as a snake, is highly unusual. He keeps her close, and the way she listens to him, even for a Parslemouth is astounding.” Dumbledore said.
“That,” Draco said, “is a very good point. At least the family has the decorum to ignore it, waiting for the revealing ceremony.” He looked at a letter he didn’t recognize the handwriting from. “Do you know from who this is?” he asked Harry. Said boy blanched, looking over to Ron.
‟You forget that there´s no furniture,” Draco says. ‟But yeah, some painting and cleaning. There was a lot of dust.” Harry chuckles. ‟The letters are sent and we´ll get a notification if the transfer is made.”
Draco moved to stand next to him, bending down to his ear. “Sometimes I think you love my mother more than you love me.”
Harry decided to not wear the cloak again. He walked next to Draco, the pair walking behind Hermione and Ron. He held his head high, their hands intertwined leaving no room for speculation. Luckily they had potions so they would only have to go down to the classroom. They were there before Ernie, the professor already sitting in the classroom.
