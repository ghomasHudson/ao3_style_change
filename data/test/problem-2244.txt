He did most of his reading in the garden. His enjoyment with gardening however, fell slowly away as the bluebells and other wildflowers started to wilt in the autumn cold. He started using the fire pit more to keep warm when he was reading, but eventually even that felt too cold. He wasn’t ready to let go of summer yet. He went to the trusted bookshelf and found a book on atmospheric charms. Three days later he was able to spell the garden around the cabin to be in a state of constant summer. He smiled when bluebells popped out of the grass in reaction to the charm and wondered at how magic could make him enjoy a summer day while also allowing him to watch the trees outside the circle of magic start to turn yellow and red in preparation for winter. He’d purposely left the apple tree right outside the edge of his spell, because he wanted the apples to fully mature. When they did, he’d make a fall circle outside his summer-cabin before winter set in so he could enjoy all the seasons as he pleased.
When Draco doesn’t return Harry casts his Glamour over himself and puts on his standard pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He spells a hidden pocket in his jeans and tucks his wand inside. He doesn’t usually bring it when he goes to scratch his itch, because having it makes it harder to let go. He’ll make an exception tonight though. Tonight is all about exceptions.
Harry sits on the sofa too, wishing he had an arm-chair or another sofa so he could give Draco more distance. He’ll want it, when he knows.
November 18th
Harry holds up his glass for a toast. “Here’s to, uh, shit we used up all the good ones. To mates in marriage, or holy matemony if you will.”
Ice rushes through Harry's veins when he remembers Matt. He has to tell Draco. Even if it means losing Draco, his job, and his dignity. It’s not his secret to keep anymore.
“Oh,” Snape says. “I only ever meant to use it to make her believe that I didn’t think less of her for being Muggleborn. I never used it.”
Harry wonders the same thing. Things with Gin, Ron and Hermione, and hell even Pansy feel effortless. And yet every single step with Daniel feels constricting, like the air he breathes keeps getting thinner, the room he has to move in keeps shrinking. That’s normal though, probably. It has to be, because if it’s not normal then Harry isn’t normal either.
Ron groans when she leaves the room, presumably to fetch her book. “Of course she did. You know she bought like five books when you came out as bi? Now she’ll buy even more.”
“What do you mean what?” Draco asks, “I tried knocking but the door was ajar and I came in to find you passed out on the sofa all swollen and reeking of healing spells.”
“Like what you see?” Draco asked. He held his hands out and did a little spin before resting his hands on his hips, drawing Harry’s attention back to his cock.
for Draco get in the way.
“I’ve developed this fantasy,” Harry admitted. “I was thinking about how we used to be, you know, when we didn’t like each other. And wondered what would have happened if we’d run into each without knowing each other from the site. I was thinking, what if this intense
Ginny laughs. “She does. I’m actually going out with Pansy on Friday too. Thank fuck for silencing charms, right?”
He figured he had earned the sobbing, and if nothing else, it was a healthier way to deal with heartbreak than what he’d done after Alex dumped him. Draco, at least, hadn’t gone to the Prophet. There had been no exclusive interview with transcripts of their conversations. Draco hadn’t really done anything wrong at all, except being utterly uninterested in Harry. The only thing Harry could fault him for was not having the guts to end it in person. Still, he’d find a way to move on and fill the throbbing hole in his days and in his heart with something other than crying.
is fine.
“Draco,” Harry croaks, and he winces at the sound of his voice.
Harry closed his eyes and gripped the tomato harder to keep his hands from shaking.
Harry’s hunger is reflected back at him when Malfoy turns, eyes wild and lips parted.
“That’s good,” Harry says. “So good, don’t stop.”
“I’m right here,” Harry said, but he wasn’t really. He knew he hadn’t really been present for anything except the first few minutes of his day, the ones he spent struggling to get out of bed.
“Yes, well, that too,” she says, making Ginny blush harder.
“What?” Harry mentally shakes himself and gets up off the floor.
“Not in the mood,” Harry bites. He walks into his room and can’t quite suppress his internal angry fifteen-year-old enough to resist slamming the door.
“A couple more things first,” Draco says. “First, and I guess this could be considered a limit. I don’t share, not unless I’m there myself. No more finding blokes like Matt.”
for when men rolled up their shirtsleeves. Something about a shirt and smart trousers looked so put together, and then with the sleeves rolled up they looked like they were ready to bend Harry over the table and –, no he couldn’t go there. Not even in his head. Not if he didn’t want to get hard while dicing tomatoes.
“Sorry.”
“Er, I need to ask you something,” Harry blurts, finding no better way to say it.
She pulled a stack of papers from her purse and looked up at Harry, shuffling the papers in her hands nervously. “I’ve had this idea for a while,” she said.
“I could be your Dom, if you wanted.” Draco says it like it’s the easiest thing, like it’s a casual offer to a friend. Like it’s ‘
“But then they got together, and they stopped being my person and were just each other's person. And we’re still friends, you know? I see them every other week or so, when they have a spare moment between work and parenting and being a couple, but they can’t be my person anymore because they’re too busy being each other's person. And fuck, losing them hurt like hell. Because even if I didn’t really lose them I did – in a way. They left me behind when they started their life together, and I keep falling further and further behind. It feels like heartbreak in slow motion.” Harry breaks off to take a deep drink from his glass.
Draco looked at Harry with an expression Harry had only ever seen in the mirror. His own eyes would look like that when he remembered everyone he had failed to save.
Draco rolls his eyes and takes a handful of popcorn. “Fine, you can be Merry, but only if I can be Legolas. Actually no, as long as I can have Legolas, he’s hot as fuck.”
"Take me home," he begged, no longer bothering to lower his voice. "Please, Draco, I want to finish this."
“I like being held down or tied up,” Harry admits, keeping his eyes on Draco’s forearm and imagining the way it could hold him down. “I don’t like something covering my eyes. I think, maybe with you though. Uhm, I like giving up control, having someone else decide. I like being fucked.” Harry blushes harder. “I like it when it’s a little rough, when it stretches so much it hurts a little — so I guess I don’t like too much prep? Fuck this is embarrassing to talk about.”
Harry grinned at the woman who had apparently been in his house the night before, though he had no idea who she was.
“No that’s terrible we’re not toasting to matemony you loon,” Draco says holding his glass away from Harry with a thoughtful look.
going to ask Hermione for help. In fact, he’s going to make the promise and then figure this shit out on his own.
"Oh," Harry says because what do you say when you don't feel the same and don't want to lie?
The movie has only played for a few minutes when Harry realises Draco intends on keeping a running commentary throughout. He finds he doesn’t mind like he does when Ginny insists on chatting through a movie at the cinema. Mostly because there aren’t other people around to be annoyed, and also because Draco only talks about the movie and the thoughts he has about it.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry said, spreading his knees and exposing his arse to Draco. He felt torn between hiding in embarrassment and humping up against the mattress, but managed to stay still. He hoped Draco wouldn’t notice the lube Harry had used when he fucked himself earlier, in preparation for the party.
“Aftercare?” Draco asks.
When Malfoy nods Harry grabs a tray and starts piling on his own favourite breakfast foods, as well as bacon, eggs, half a grapefruit and some toast for Malfoy. He keeps conscious of his wrist, ready to move if it gets cold but the Dining Hall is small enough that he doesn’t really have to worry.
“What?” the bloke shouts, leaning in close so Harry will hear and blowing hot air into his ear in the process.
to each other without the bond helping them along.
Does Harry want that? He definitely wants a relationship, but how can he know if he wants one with Daniel? Maybe the only way to find out is to try. It can’t hurt getting to know him at least.
“Fuck, Harry, so good. So good for me, fuck. Your arse. Shitshitshit. So perfect.”
So of course, that’s exactly what happened. Not only did Draco stop fingering and wanking him, but he pulled off entirely and Harry cried out desperately. His body hurt with wanting, every inch of him felt overly sensitive and raw, like the protective layer around his nerves had been stripped clean.
“Of course,” Draco says, “ready to go home?”
Harry feels his heart speed up as Malfoy gets closer, and he can’t make his mouth work well enough to form words to say anything at all. Not when Malfoy is so close, and when Harry is so desperately horny after that night’s dream. A dream in which, incidentally, Malfoy had him pushed up against a wall as they desperately clawed at the other’s clothes and rutted against each other.
“Alright,” Draco says, “but is it like, you want it but then when you have it you don’t enjoy it?”
“Draco, please.” Harry begs. “Please, I need you in me. Please.”
“Unless nightmares count as stupid,” Harry says before he can catch himself. “Honestly, I just need some sleep.”
“Aromantic,” Harry says, putting extra emphasis on the n. “As in, I don’t want a boyfriend or girlfriend, ever. I just don’t like romance, not for myself.”
Draco groans and pulls at Harry in a way that must be laced with magic because seconds later Harry is lying flat on the bed with Draco over him, both shirtless. Draco stares down at him with heat in his eyes like he’s just as desperate for this as Harry feels.
In his mind he lets himself pretend. He imagines knocking on Malfoy’s door now, finding him messy with sleep and hungry for Harry. He imagines their bodies locking together, crashing together with an intensity that makes them both groan.
Harry waste precious seconds staring at the closed door, wondering if he should find some excuse to open it up again. Matt tugs his arm before he has the chance to decide, and he turns around to find himself face to face with Crabbe.
Ron is the first to make it down, sagging into the sofa next to Harry with a sigh.
Malfoy slides his pants down and Harry groans as his cock is exposed to the air, and the gaze of everyone watching. He isn’t the only one who makes a sound; groans and moans echo off the walls of the room and the obvious pleasure of the others in the room only works to intensify Harry’s own pleasure.
Something about Harry coming must have set Draco off as well, because he suddenly pulled Harry’s head back so hard and fast Harry’s spent cock twitched. He opened his eyes to look up at Draco who was mouthing words and breathing harshly. He felt Draco’s come in stripes on his neck and chest and couldn’t help the soothing feeling that he was being claimed. That Draco was taking him for himself, and that he wouldn’t let go unless Harry asked him to.
“We’ve already set it up with the Portkey office and the house we’ve rented allows animals,” Ginny assures. “Though next year you guys can plan the vacation. It’s harder than you think to find a rental that allows dogs, but isn’t hideous.”
Draco considers him for a moment then smiles, “Then you can be Merry and be good friends with the cute little Hobbits with all their emotions and I can be Aragorn and have hot sex with Legolas, deal?”
“Anyway, thanks. I’ll let you get back to whatever you were doing.”
“It’s not like he didn’t have a point. He wanted the famous guy. I knew that, that’s what they all want. That kid who killed Voldemort. They want me all brave and caring and strong, but I'm just scooped out and used up. He loved this hollow shell of
“Welcome, Potter,” Malfoy says. “I’m glad you made it.”
He feels Draco take his hand, and hums softly in appreciation when the cool towel is rubbed over his wrists, soothing the slight soreness there. Draco keeps going, taking his time running the towel softly down Harry’s arm, across his chest, down the other hand to his wrist. He brings the towel back to his chest and moves it down, cleaning the come off Harry’s belly and the lube from between his legs.
Draco sets a fast pace, pulling out and pushing in hard and fast. It’s exactly what Harry needs. What they both need. Harry holds on tight to Draco, lips parted as he draws shuddering breaths. His cock is trapped between their bodies, leaking precome onto Harry’s stomach. He resists the urge to reach down and close his fist around it. He wants to make this last longer; enjoy the desperation in them both for more, closer, deeper.
Harry gasps, Malfoy’s voice in his ear feeding his pleasure.
“Well, what do you want me to do then? Not everyone meets their soulmate at eleven. Has it ever occurred to you that the only people who are ever interested in me want the
Harry grips Draco’s hand tighter. “Sounds like a brilliant plan to me.”
“Really?” Harry says. “Who’s your boss?” The hand on his thigh inches upwards and he hates the idea that he might have to show this memory to Draco.
“Naan, yeah I know,” Harry finishes for him. “Can we watch Lord of the Rings again?”
Harry sighs. “I know,” he says. “I just really wish I didn’t have to come back here.”
Draco stands from his chair and walks around the table to place his hands on Harry’s shoulders.
The only good thing about returning to Hogwarts at the ripe age of 24 is that they won’t be mixed in with the other students. The course starts in May and lasts out August, and since it’s arranged by the Ministry instead of Hogwarts, they’ve hired their own teachers. Hopefully, the new teachers and the newly restored part of the castle they’ll be using will make it feel different enough that Harry won’t see ghosts everywhere he looks.
“I’m not sure I’m a sane and rational person after all,” Harry says, more to himself than Malfoy.
Harry walked into the living room and collapsed into the sofa next to Ron. Once seated he buried his head in his hands and rested his elbows on his knees. He had to resist the urge to scream with frustration. His emotions were all tangled up in each other. He had his feelings for M and though he’d never met M, or at least this version of M, the feelings were very real. But then he also had his feelings for Malfoy, the bloke who’d broken his nose and called his friends horrible things. The boy who had tried to murder Dumbledore and had poisoned Ron and cursed Katie in the process. Those feelings felt like the polar opposite of what he felt for M. Of course, Harry hadn’t really seen Malfoy since the war.
“You’ve grown into something,” Harry says, unable to keep his eyes off where Malfoy’s sleeves are rolled up to just below his elbows. He has to resist the urge to reach out and run his fingers over the exposed skin. Merlin, he needs a wank.
Harry reaches out for Draco and deepens the kiss. They’re ok. They’re going to be alright. Draco isn’t going anywhere.
Ron laughs kindly, getting up from his chair to give Harry a pat on the shoulder that’s just on the side of painful. “Mate, as long as you’re happy I really don’t care.”
He’s a terrible person. Terrible for lying to Daniel, terrible for leaving out vital information, terrible for being unable to feel the things he really
They sat down at the table, and Harry couldn’t keep the thoughts of where Draco really lived out of his head.
Harry decided to spend a few hours clearing away more weeds, rotten leaves, and weird rocks from the garden. There seemed to be an endless supply of them, but he noticed he was finally making a real dent in it. He wondered if he should contact Neville and get some tips on gardening. It might be nice to grow his own fruits and veggies – and it might be nice to expand on his social circle a little. If he got too comfortable in his own company, he might never leave the cabin.
“I want to be close,” he says. “I want to feel you – to know that we’re ok. To know for sure you’re not going to change your mind and just leave me.”
“Good, I love giving praise.” He squeezes Harry’s hand and Harry looks up to meet his eyes.
“Yes. Like Expecto Patronom means I expect a guardian and Expelliarmus is a mix of expello and arma which means banish and weapon, respectively,” Malfoy explains. “Knowing Latin makes learning and understanding spells a lot easier.”
Inside the cabin Harry rinsed off his tomatoes and was ready to start chopping them when he was distracted by the sight of Draco shedding his winter clothes. Draco started with the scarf, unwrapping it slowly with long fingers and hanging it on the hook Harry had installed by the door. Next was his winter coat. He slowly opened the buttons to reveal a dark blue shirt underneath. He looked
“Martin Walker,” Harry reads aloud, speaking loudly enough to break Draco out of his rant. “42 years old, Squib. He’s been brought in a couple of times by Muggle police for possession of narcotics. Has a Muggle flat, Muggle job and apparently uses Muggle drugs too.”
. And I don't think that will be enough for you."
“Of course, she didn’t,” Ron said, looking at his wife. “Oh. You did.”
Daniel is waiting on the other side of the Floo and Harry suddenly wonders if he does want this, after all. He’s just some bloke, and the only reason Harry’s here with him instead of someone else from the bar, is that Daniel had asked.
Draco laughed, throwing his head back and letting his whole body shake with it. “I can’t wait,” he gasped between laughs, “to see their faces when I resign tomorrow.”
For a second he’s afraid Draco won’t make good on his word, that he’ll keep moving down to kiss and lick Harry all over until he’s a desperate mess and ready to beg for anything. That had been a fun night, and Harry can’t wait to repeat it, but what he wants now is something more primal.
“Beautiful,” Draco hummed. Harry blushed and jerked his hips a little, groaning when it brought his aching cock into contact with the bed.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Thank you for coming with me.”
"Hey, bi-disaster, want to talk about it?" Pansy says.
“It’s not a one-time thing,” Harry says, because he feels in his bones that it’s true. That the second he gets to know Malfoy
December 27th
He was tipping the diced tomato into his bowl when Draco finally responded.
Harry doesn’t feel the stiffness of his knees and shoulders until he stands up from his position bent over the table, and he winces a little when he does. He turns to see Draco standing, half-naked in his kitchen, one hand wet with lube and it feels surreal. He can’t believe he has this.
Harry smiles at that, at how home can be both a place and a feeling and how happy he is to have both. “Yes, let’s go home.”
“No. Yes. Fuck.”
when it comes to being left behind. You know, the whole traumatic childhood thing that we can get into another time, anyway it left me feeling like everyone leaves me. Irrational, probably, but just – promise you’ll never leave without saying goodbye? That’s what I need. I think.”
. At least that’s what he says every time Hermione mentions his
“Fuck, you were so good for me. So fucking hot.” Draco ran his hand down Harry’s arm in a gentle caress and reached to intertwine their fingers. “Was it what you had imagined?”
“No, not now. You’re still dropping, and I’m still angry. I don’t do scenes when I’m angry. And I don’t do scenes without proper communication first either.”
“Nobody did anything I didn’t want them to,” Harry says. He doesn’t meet Draco’s eyes. “It’s fine, I’m fine. Well, I’m obviously fucked in the head, but this is what I wanted.”
“Come in,” she said, stepping aside and letting Harry walk past her into the house. “Rose is asleep so keep your voice down outside the kitchen and living room, those are the only rooms with silencing charms on them.”
“Upstairs in a private room,” Matt explains. “He doesn’t like to be around the ‘common people’ too much, apparently.”
Harry frowns. “Do we really need one? Can’t we just say stop?”
“It should be about what you both like, that’s the whole point. You should both enjoy everything that happens, and he should take care of you after. Talk you through it, clean you off, get you water.”
"I mean, probably. But if there are I haven't heard of them yet. I'm er, pretty new to this still," Harry admitted, hoping his inexperience wouldn't scare Malfoy away.
“How is that different than having a friend you want to have sex with though?” Draco asks, sounding genuinely curious.
“I bought movies,” Draco says proudly, “and a DDD player.”
“Come home with me?” Daniel says, breaking away from the kiss and licking at Harry’s earlobe. His hands are on Harry’s arse, pulling him close to his own body.
“Thanks,” Harry says. “Have you called the other Aurors yet?”
Draco looks pointedly at the green plant next to the television that’s been on the brink of death ever since Ginny moved out. “Most people start with a houseplant.”
“You’re missing one too,” Harry says, only realising after he’s said the words that he’s effectively admitting that the thing with Malfoy
“After,” Malfoy promises, leaning in to give Harry a reprise of the chaste kiss that had started everything.
“Yes, that too.” Malfoy walks a bit faster, catching up to Harry and returning the smile. “So, any particular reason you’ve decided to join me for breakfast today?”
“Indeed,” Draco says. He pulls out gently and rolls off Harry with a groan, waving his hand to release Harry’s wrists. Harry lets them fall to the bed and closes his eyes, half waiting for the horrible feelings to come creeping in now that they’re done. Before his feelings have time to do anything though, he hears Draco wet the towel with a softly spoken spell.
Harry grins at Draco and follows him into the flat so he can get the movie. Things with Draco are always so easy. It’s like he just gets what Harry’s thinking without Harry having to say much at all.
The first time Harry had gone to a BDSM party he'd expected it to be terrible. Hermione had dragged him along talking excitedly about spanking and impact play. That had been the theme for the evening, and it had been what convinced Harry he wanted nothing more than to be a sub. The look of absolute pleasure flashing across people's faces when a hand or a paddle landed on their arse had been enough for Harry to want to try, and the pure ecstasy he'd felt when he let a bloke bend him over the sofa so he could give it a go had been enough to make him never want to stop.
“Harry!” Draco shouts, and Harry turns to Matt just in time to see the fist heading for his face. Pain explodes in his jaw as he falls to the floor, only to jerk back because of the firm grip Matt still has on Harry’s wrist. Harry’s wand falls from his grip, and he has to blink hard to try and clear his head. Draco throws a stunner towards Matt, but it deflects off the shield Crabbe had raised.
Matt grins, and something about the glint in his eyes sends a thrill through Harry. “Do your shot,” he demands.
Harry tries and fails to fight back the blush. “I got distracted.”
Harry laughs because no, he’s very much not OK. He’s attached himself to Malfoy somehow, and he’s pretty sure he’ll fail his NEWT course if he tells anyone about it because it’s undeniable proof of his idiocy.
“Remember all those conversations we had?” Ginny asks. “All those talks about looking for something, or feeling like something was missing, or wrong? I kissed a girl and all the pieces fell into place. And when I finally figured it out I thought, well, you have those feelings too.”
He put his glasses on and laid back down in bed, letting his eyes adjust to the light as he listened to the sounds of people walking and talking quietly outside his door. His house was never really empty anymore, and he preferred it that way. He wanted it to be alive with life and joy, and the parties Millie threw were always fun and full of laughing people. At first the people he loved had been there too. Ron and Hermione had made an effort to show up every Saturday, but then they’d had Rose and Harry didn’t blame them for not coming anymore. Dean and Seamus loved a good party and they still came sometimes, but they had their jobs and they preferred a quiet night in most nights now. Luna, Neville, and Ginny had been there at first too, but it seemed like the more Harry filled his house the less his friends wanted to be there.
Harry is prepared for Draco to get off him, to start unbuttoning his trousers and kick them off before taking Harry in his arms again. He laughs in surprise when instead both his and Draco’s remaining clothes disappear in an instant. Draco holds up the wand he’d apparently never let go of and smirks.
Harry looked at the bed he shared with Draco most nights and wondered when the man had last slept in his own flat. It had been at least three weeks. Was Draco aware he had moved in, or had it been an accident? Harry hadn’t been aware, not until now, but the realisation only made him see how much he wanted Draco to move in.
Suddenly the mirror disappears, instead a metal bar appears in front of Harry, hovering at the height of his hips.
But fresh tears are escaping Harry’s eyes and blending with the melting snowflakes on his face and he can’t let Draco see how selfish he is.
“That sounds like a good plan,” Harry says, assured. Maybe it doesn’t have to matter all that much that he doesn’t know everything, as long as he’s comfortable with the way he’s living.”
Draco looks at his watch and nods reluctantly. "Fine, go and get some bloody sleep will you, Potter."
Harry trails off at the continued look of frozen horror on Draco’s face. The previous night comes back to him in flashes, hands around his neck, his face slamming to the floor, rough hands gripping his wrists. The duvet covers him from the waist down, but of course that’s not enough. Not when Harry hasn’t had the chance to do his routine healing-spells.
“Even though I’m an idiot sometimes?” Harry asks.
The nudge against his consciousness is so gentle this time Harry almost doesn’t notice it, sated and half-asleep as he is.
“I want you to decide,” Harry says, and fuck it feels good to say it out loud. “You know what I like, I trust you. And I’ll say almond if anything feels off. Promise.”
Ron forces the pizza down with a gulp of beer and stares at Harry. “Really? Bloody hell mate.”
Malfoy smirks. “Well now I’m intrigued.”
between them.
Malfoy smirked. "Lack of patience might make bondage hard."
is, it’s not some casual one-off.
And, Harry supposes, what it meant to the world-at-large. Catching the last escaped Death Eater, in a lot of ways, means closing the book on a war that ended over a decade previous. The fact that it was Crabbe Senior, a father who’d cast Imperio on his own son and sent him on a suicide mission intended to kill not only Harry and his friends but Draco and his too, well… It made the case personal to both of them.
Harry dares a look up at Draco. “I’ve found a way to contact Crabbe though. I have a way in, we can get him.”
“You didn’t want to break it?” Draco asks, eyebrows lowering in a confused frown. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
“It just is, I don’t know, it feels different. Part of it is a jealousy thing I think. I don’t mind sharing you and Harry, and I don’t mind Pansy having platonic relationships with other people, of course, but the love we share is just for us – I don’t want to give that to anyone else and I don’t want her to either. And it’s just… more intense, I guess. I mean, I love hanging out with Harry and I think about him and want him to do well, but I don’t want to be around him
“Yes, dropping, drop, sub drop, whatever you like. That’s what’s happening right now, it’s what’s been happening every other week for as long as we’ve been partners. It’s -” Draco breaks off, staring at Harry’s confused face with horror again. “You have no idea what a drop is, do you?”
“Where were you this morning?” Hermione asks, while Ron greets him with a yawn. “I tried knocking.”
Harry jumps at the curse, and Matt must think it’s because his hand is now covering his crotch, because he grins and presses a little harder.
Malfoy seems to catch on immediately, licking a hot stripe from the edge of Harry’s collarbone up to his ear and then gently biting at the earlobe. Harry shivers, and clutches to Malfoy – half terrified he’s going to wake up any second and this will all be a dream.
Draco rolls his eyes and grabbs a fistfull of Harry’s floo powder. “Fine, but I’ll be very interested to hear how you know a Muggle drug-dealer. I certainly hope you’re not addicted to Muggle drugs on top of everything else.” His eyes land on Harry’s drink.
“Merlin, that’s good,” Draco said. He picked up a piece of tomato with his fingers and placed it delicately in his mouth, closing his eyes and sighing at the taste before licking his fingers clean.
“Please,” he said, twisting on the bed to create friction and wincing at how rough the sheets felt on his sensitive skin. To his horror he realised his eyes were wet, tears the only release he had from the overwhelming longing thrumming in his body. “Fuck, Draco. Malfoy. Please.”
They spend the rest of the walk up the stairs to the dining hall in silence. Malfoy is probably lost in thought trying to figure out how to teach Harry potions or pondering his own attraction, and Harry is busy trying to figure out how to ask Hermione for help without pissing her off.
“I’m sorry,” he said. It felt inadequate and by the looks on his friends’ faces it was.
“What?” Ginny asks, loosening her death-grip on her soda and taking a steadying breath.
October 15th
Draco smiles, and Harry feels it against his thumb. “I’m sorry I’m so terrible at communicating that you felt like you needed a bond to get to know me. Seeing it from your point of view was – enlightening.”
The bracelet on Harry’s wrist feels heavy like it carries all the differences between friendship and love that Ginny explained. All the differences Harry doesn’t feel. Daniel isn’t his Pansy, Harry doesn’t feel what Ginny does. He doesn’t feel a damn thing. He could probably love Daniel as a friend, the way he loves Ginny and the way he’s starting to love Pansy and even Draco, but he’s been trying so hard to make the relationship something else that he just feels empty.
“How about that surface?” Harry says, lips against Malfoy’s neck. He doesn’t bother waiting for an answer as he steps back towards the sofa, pulling Malfoy along with him. The resounding creak when he lets himself fall back onto the sofa makes him laugh again.
"Good." Malfoy quickly grabbed hold of Harry's wrists, pulling them behind his back and holding them for a moment. "Hold them still."
Daniel stands, looking down at Harry with disgust. "You clearly have some major mental health issues you need to work on. You're just cold and empty like something is seriously broken. You're a prick, and I want nothing to do with you. Get out."
“You’re being weird again,” Draco observes after closing the door to their office and discarding his cloak. “I don’t suppose you’ll tell me what it is this time either?”
Harry bit his lip. He should tell Draco, he knew he should. The thought of admitting to being a virgin at 26 made a blush rise on his cheeks, but he clenched his fists and spoke. “I - er, the most experience I have is pretty much that time I came in my pants when that Dom paddled my arse at one of the parties.”
“Yes,” Draco says, a sad smile on his face. Harry wonders if it was ever real. He doesn’t know what hurts more, the idea that Draco never loved him - or the thought that he just doesn’t love Harry
“Your face is red.” Malfoy says the second Harry sits down in the chair.
“Interesting,” Malfoy says.
why the fuck have you been with me for months? Did you just hate it, everything we've done? Every time we had sex? Every date we've been on?"
“Oh,” Harry says. They don’t speak about the war or the following year often, but when they do it’s mostly one of them sharing and the other just listening. It’s helped Harry, to talk about it without getting too many answers or opinions, and he hopes it’s helping Draco too.
Harry lets himself watch Malfoy for a few delicious seconds before he gets to work on his own, much simpler, robe. Despite Malfoy’s head start, their robes hit the floor at the same time and then Malfoy’s mouth is on Harry’s neck again, licking and biting gently.
Harry releases his grip on one of Draco’s forearms, and reaches between their bodies to close it around his cock. He wants Draco to see how much he wants this, how good he makes him feel.
“Oh, come on Potter, my puns aren’t that bad,” Pansy huffs.
Draco.
, so good in fact, that he wasn’t really sure how to be just Harry when he was with his friends anymore.
“I know,” Harry says, feeling terribly nervous about the whole thing. It had seemed like a better idea after several drinks.
Harry shrugs. He’d like to lash out, blame Ron for the mess he’s in – but he doesn’t think his friend deserves it. He’d been worried, and Harry gets it. He’s been dodging him and Hermione for weeks, avoiding their questions and hiding when they get close. He knows they were just worried, knows he is the one in the wrong here. He’s the one who cast an untested spell on himself; who spent weeks listening in on someone else’s thoughts without their permission.
“We’ll be even?” Draco asks, and Harry still can’t tell if he’s hurt or angry or intrigued.
“Yeah I think I’m going to just – not have sex. At least for a while. I need to work out how I really feel about it, and if I really do want and enjoy the things I can’t do on my own or if I’m just…,” Harry hesitates, unsure how to word it. “To stick with the food metaphor; I need to figure out if I’m just eating something I don’t really like because I’m hungry. I’m not ruling it out forever or with everyone, but I’m not in a big rush to figure it out.”
Harry groans. “I didn’t think they were actually going to split up partners for this, I thought that was just a stupid idea that got shut down.”
“It’s intense for me too,” Harry said. “I mean, I’m the one who’s always asking you to stay. I can be without you, it’s not that. It’s just, I don’t want to. I like being with you, I like having you around. And if you like that too, why shouldn’t you live here?”
“I bet we know a frightening amount about each other, if we start to think about it. We did live in the same castle for six years, after all,” Harry says, taking another sip from his coffee.
Harry peeks out of the pillow to look at the three people in the bed with him. Ginny is red with a blush, Pansy is looking at her with damp eyes and Draco is balanced at the edge of the bed looking curiously at them both.
“Good morning,” Malfoy says. He looks confident, standing in front of the class in his dark green robes. Confident and yet somehow nervous at the same time. It’s not really noticeable, and Harry suspects the only reason
“What do you mean?” Ginny asks, saving Harry from having to do it.
“What?” Malfoy quirks an eyebrow and stares at Harry.
“Turn over,” Draco says, and Harry does. Nothing about this feels like crashing into emotional hangover land, or dropping, like Draco had called it. The way Draco’s taking care of him makes him feel like he’s landing softly on silk sheets, relaxed and luxurious.
Harry takes the card and studies the details for a Pensive-memory just in case Matt doesn’t let him keep it.
wait.
“I won’t get tired,” Harry says. “The more I get, oh
Harry nods and Draco scoots a little closer, placing his hand on Harry’s back and rubbing his thumb in smooth circles. The tension seeps out of Harry’s shoulders as he lets the sensations soothe him.
“Morning Malfoy,” Harry says when the door opens. “Care to join me for breakfast?”
Ron looked suddenly embarrassed. “I kind of thought she had been the one pushing you,” he admitted. “That she was behind all the parties and the insane number of public appearances. But she said she’s been trying to get you to slow down for ages.”
Spent and oversensitive Harry closed his eyes and let the small thrills of pleasure soothe him out of the intense orgasm. When Draco came, he cursed spectacularly and collapsed on top of Harry, cock still buried deep in his arse.
“I’m alright with anal, oral, spanking, hair-pulling and using toys,” Harry says. “Oh, and I very much prefer to bottom.”
“Oh, woe is me,” Ginny proclaims, throwing her arms out for dramatic effect. “I’m so horny all the time, my right palm is raw from my own ineffectual wanking – I need sex Gin, the libido-monster must be fed!”
. He could never be anything but gorgeous, and he’s in Harry’s bed smiling and running his hands up Harry’s naked thighs. Harry’s arse is still warm against the sheets and he moans softly when Draco’s hands reach it.
Harry gets through the hangover after spending all night drinking with Draco. He gets through helping Ginny pack her belongings. He even gets through helping her unpack them in her new home. And when he goes home after dinner he gets through the first night alone in
“Hold your arse open for me,” Draco said, finally removing his finger from where it had been resting in the cleft of Harry’s arse. Harry heard him reach for his wand and mutter a lubrication spell, and he shivered with want and slight embarrassment as he reached behind him to hold his arse open for Draco.
and combined with the words Harry keeps hearing in his ear it makes him feel warm all over. He waits for Malfoy to round the corner, throws his invisibility cloak over himself and follows.
Ron groans. “
“How was it?” Draco says. He’s sat down by the kitchen table, and Harry doesn’t turn to check if the glint of humour he thinks he can hear is reflected in Draco’s eyes too.
When the finger in his arse disappears and doesn’t come back Harry’s eyes focus back on Draco, and he watches, spellbound, as Draco takes his time lubing up his cock. He’s biting his lips and breathing hard as his hand works his cock, and Harry wants to beg all over again, but he can’t make his mouth form words.
Harry nods. Draco’s face is impassive, not one muscle moving to give away any emotion. His voice is matter-of-fact, questioning Harry without sounding accusing or curious. Harry wonders what Draco thinks. Does he still believe Harry only wanted to be with him to break the bond? Does he believe that Harry didn’t want it broken? Is he hurt that Harry invaded his privacy by listening to his thoughts?
“Really?” Harry asks, “I mean, he’s attractive I guess.”
“Are you alright?” Draco demands, staring down at Harry.
“Please,” Harry says, moaning.
“Sectumsempra,” Malfoy says, “this is where you learned the spell?”
“I miss you mate,” he said, keeping Harry frozen with his gaze.
Harry shook his head to stop the memories connected to the article from rushing in and Apparated to Millie’s office to get his itinerary for the next couple of days. The first item on his list was a birthday lunch with Ron and Hermione.
Harry moves his hand from Draco’s face and grabs his hands instead, gently tugging Draco with him as he moves to sit on his bed again.
“I bought a television.”
“Yes,” Harry agrees, his cock giving a throb in his pants. “Yes, definitely.”
When they’re halfway through eating Draco sighs. “So, tell me about last night. I’m assuming you went off without me because you didn’t want me to know the nature of your relationship with Matt?”
Draco smiles a little and then seems to shake himself. “Well there is no reason for us to be both miserable
The lights in the office are too bright, and Harry’s already pounding headache screams in protest. In Harry’s opinion the office is always too bright, and it’s all Draco’s bloody fault anyway. If he’d just stop refusing to use his reading glasses their office wouldn’t need to be lit with what had to be at least three Lumos Maximas.
Harry wants to laugh, or scream, or break something. He wants to break out of this stupid box and rush after Draco. He wants to curse Ron and Hermione for being so stupid, or himself for being even dumber. The force of his emotions fuels the storm around him for a second before it dies down. The air in the box instead goes unnaturally still and cold.
Harry laughs and he sees the corners of Draco’s mouth twitch in response. “Told you.”
There is a small round stage in the middle of the room, and Harry walks up to it. He hears the other people in the room breathing, but he can’t see them through the light of the stage. He knows Ron is somewhere in the room. That Malfoy is probably there too. He knows the table hidden in half-darkness has the blue rope and whatever toys Ron picked out, and that’s all he knows. Excitement tingles across his skin, and Harry can’t believe he’s getting this. That he’s about to be tied up, on stage, and get off with Draco Malfoy.
“Uh, no I’m alright,” Harry says. “But, er, you go on ahead. I think I’m just going to go back to the Dining Hall and get a glass of water or a cup of tea or something.”
The words crawled inside Harry and settled there as a warm glow in the pit of his stomach.
“Turn the page,” she says.
“Hermione and I thought we’d go to Hogsmeade today,” Ron says, “want to join?”
Harry hadn’t thought his heart could break more than it had when Ginny announced she’d be moving out, but it breaks for Draco now, because he’s hurting just as much as Harry is.
“Why the fuck not?” Ron asked, and the offense on his face made Harry want to laugh.
“Merlin,” Draco said, his voice back to his normal one. “That was intense.”
“Thank you,” Harry breathes. He feels something cold in his heart melt at the promise, and he sighs at the sensation. He hadn’t realised how much it worried him until it was spoken and dealt with. Somehow his fear being out in the light makes it smaller.
“I mean, you need someone to teach you the right way of doing this. Someone you trust, and honestly at this point someone
He puts his pants on underneath his duvet and gets out of bed. It’s a mistake. That much is obvious by how Draco gasps and stares down at Harry’s lower half. Harry follows his gaze and sees his bruised knees and the distinct fingerprint bruising all over his thighs.
“Alright, just for a little while. Then you’re taking me to lunch,” Harry says.
After dinner he sat with Ginny, George, Ron, and Hermione under a heating-spell on the porch, enjoying hot drinks Molly had made.
Harry survives another week of being tethered to Malfoy. A new week of sleeping on the floor and waking up to his body screaming in protest at sleeping on a hard surface. Of cleaning himself with charms, and finding creative ways to use the bathroom. He survives a week of rushing to the seats by the wall in his classes, so he’ll be close enough to Malfoy. He even survives being invisible in the crowded streets of Hogsmeade when Malfoy goes to buy quills. He’s pretty sure he can survive doing this for another few weeks while he figures out a way to break the stupid bond. He’s not sure he’ll survive the dreams.
Harry winces and takes another drink.
“It’s the middle of the day,” Harry laughs.
“It is good,” Harry agrees, “shame most of it’s on the floor.”
“Hmm,” Harry says. He wonders if he’ll ever find one of Draco’s good Doms. If anyone could ever do anything that would feel as good as leaning against Draco while he rubs soothing circles into his back. He wonders how he’ll ever get over his stupid
“You really didn’t have to get me anything,” Harry says.
Harry looks up to make sure Draco and Ayla are still far enough away that they won’t hear him. “I never fit in, not really. I had a house with the Dursleys, but never a home. And after that, at Hogwarts and with Ginny, I got close but I heard somewhere that home is a person, not a place and I spent so much energy looking for that person. And I’ve been so confused because I couldn’t find them.”
The Pensive is still sitting on his desk from the previous week and Harry focuses on his memories of Matt in the pub and the conversation they’d had after Harry laced his drink with Veritaserum.
Draco smiles, and it looks relieved. “I want absolutely nothing between us to change. I love this whole friendship thing we’ve got going. The only thing I want to change is going to bed in Ginny’s old room instead of my flat. I’m not, you know, expecting us to share lives or anything. Not more than we’re already doing. I still need alone time.”
“Yes, I do. Please,” Harry says. He doesn’t wait for a response, just leaves Malfoy standing outside the door and rushes into the bathroom, groaning with relief as he empties his bladder. Fuck. He’s never getting distracted in the morning again.
Harry takes a sharp breath and forces himself not to stare at Malfoy in shock. Right. He might mean hot as in warm, Harry probably still looks flaming red after all. None of it matters anyway, Harry thinks. Even if Malfoy did want to sleep with him, and even if Harry does want to sleep with Malfoy – he doesn’t want it just to break a bond. He wants to have sex because they’re attracted to each other.
“Just, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way – but if you ever decide you do want sex, or you want to try something out, you could always ask me,” Draco says, blushing and rushing his words. “And that’s not me asking you for sex, or pressuring you to have it. I never want to do that. I’m just – open to it, if you ever decide that’s the right thing for you.”
desperate need he woke up to this morning.
“Kinda,” Harry smiles. He lifts a hand to rub awkwardly at the back of his head. “You’re right as usual, apparently.”
The words throb against Harry’s ear like a heartbeat. He has to fix this. Fucking hell, why has he been so stupid? Why is everyone so stupid?
Malfoy releases his grip on Harry’s cock and holds out his hand for lube. Harry can’t help the disappointed whine, even though he was the one who asked to stop.
Stretching and rolling his head to lessen the ache in his neck Harry went inside for a quick refreshing shower and went to work making dinner. He ate at the table, staring out of the window at the slowly setting sun in an effort to keep the glowing feeling of accomplishment the day had given him, instead of letting his thoughts go down the angsty spiral of ‘what the fuck have I done?’ that he’d tried to avoid ever since coming to the cabin. It almost worked.
The ‘I love you’ sits at the tip of his tongue and he bites down to keep it there, choosing instead to look up at Draco as he takes off his pants and crawls into bed. He’s gorgeous, of course he is, he’s
Draco huffs. “I used to talk a lot and yet I never said anything that mattered. After the war I realised I had been talking so much I never stopped to listen.  I talked over people who had something to
“Yeah,” Ron says. “It’s more the memories, you know?”
Draco opened the button on his jeans and slowly lowered the zipper. “Oh, I have several
Harry works on keeping his breathing even. Draco cares. He cares, and he’s angry, but he’s here.
Malfoy barks a surprised laugh. “I’m not sure I was any less of a git right after the war, Potter. I like to think I’ve grown into being only annoying and occasionally rude at this point though.”
Hermione released her lip from between her teeth and it wobbled with emotion. “You told us he worked at St Mungo’s. And then you said he’d been on the wrong side of the war. There’s only one reformed Death Eater working there, I was on the committee that approved it years ago. I wanted to tell you, but you had asked me not to and I didn’t want to ruin anything.”
“Yes,” he gasps when the fingers move to rub circles around his rim. Harry grabs a pillow and shoves it beneath himself, knowing full well he’s going to be too distracted to keep his hips up in a second. Draco’s fingers always make him see stars.
Draco’s trousers fell to his knees when Harry got the buttons open. He still had his shoes on, and Harry didn’t have time to take them off to get the trousers off properly. He felt a rush to keep moving, to keep exploring the man in front of him. Draco’s pants were soft, and the same colour blue as his shirt. His cock made an impressive tent in them, and a slowly growing wet spot made Harry’s mouth water.
Harry knew Sirius had believed what he said when Harry told him he was gay. That he’d seen Harry facing the same misery as they had, and had hoped to prevent it. The world had changed though, while Sirius was in Azkaban. And after the war was finally won, it kept changing. Harry wasn’t afraid of being queer. He didn’t mind if people knew - he wouldn’t be hated for it.
“This spell,” Harry says, grabbing the book and flipping to the right page. “Do you know what it does? Snape wrote it for my mum.”
“I’ll tell you,” Harry promises.
Ginny turns and curses when the Muggle curling-iron catches on her throat. Healing the burn with what looks like a way too practiced spell, she grins at him. “Nah, it’s a smaller place tonight. A new pub slash club slash karaoke type thing. It’ll be fun!”
Harry doesn’t know how much time passes before he finds the inspiration to reach his hand out and summon his wand. Doesn’t know how long he holds it in his hand before the constant inner thoughts of
Harry gave Ginny a soft smile. A month ago, he was thinking the same thing, that he couldn’t leave the cabin without a clear plan. But over time his thoughts had shifted. Leaving the cabin was a plan, and his inheritance gave him the luxury of not having to make further plans just yet.
Draco pushes in slowly, and Harry’s arse burns as it works to stretch around Draco’s cock. It feels almost too good, too intense and Harry only remembers to keep breathing when Draco places a firm hand on his hip and squeezes. Draco bottoms out and they both moan, bodies shuddering at the same time as they finally join completely. Harry locks his feet behind Draco’s back to pull him impossibly closer, and then Draco moves. Pulling out and thrusting back in so forcefully the air is shoved from Harry’s lungs as pleasure shoots through him like electricity.
Harry’s soft moan grows louder as Malfoy enters him. He pushes back as much as he can without releasing the bar and shivers at the sensations of the ropes against his skin. The room isn’t quiet anymore. Harry isn’t holding anything back, and neither is his audience. Loud moans and the wet sounds of wanking rings in his ears, and it’s the hottest thing he’s ever heard. They love it, he loves it. He loves that they love it.
“Don’t be. It’s fine, really. Consent is vital and you can always change your mind.”
Draco spreads the lube over his hand and reaches down between Harry’s legs. He doesn’t tease this time, and Harry arches his back and curses when Draco’s finger enters him in one determined thrust. He moves it in and out a couple of times before taking it out entirely and pushing it in with more lube. Harry keeps his legs spread as wide as he can, and tugs on the restraints around his arms. His arousal throbs in rhythm with Draco’s thrusts and he’s desperate for Draco to finally fuck him.
He doesn’t let go when he’s done. Instead, he quietly urges Harry to let go of the metal bar and lets him rest back against him like they’d started. Harry thinks he’s being shown off. That Malfoy is holding his spent body up for everyone to see, like an artist would show off a painting. Come is running down Harry’s stomach, and he can feel it starting to escape out of his arse too. Malfoy must realise too because he turns him around so the audience can see.
“One gets used to it,” Malfoy says. “Give it an hour and it’ll be crowded.”
He feels happy and relaxed most days because he doesn’t have to go out searching for the life he wants. He already has it. He has a brilliant flatmate that will taste his baking, laugh with him, and listen when he needs to talk. He lives with his best friend, and he’s now good enough friends with Pansy and Draco that it’s never awkward for all four of them to hang out – which they do a lot. Even when Draco isn’t there Harry never feels like the third wheel, like he does sometimes with Ron and Hermione. There was never anything missing at all, so no wonder Harry had become so miserable when he was constantly looking for it.
“Come whenever you like, Potter,” Malfoy grunts, “I’ve been waiting years to feel your arse clench and quiver around my cock.”
He’s not sure how to give the memories to Draco, or how to convince him to watch them. All he knows is he wants to even the playing field, and let Draco know how sorry he is.
“You waited,” Draco said, smiling at Harry with pleased surprise.
“I’m aromantic,” he says, smiling at the confused expressions on Harry and Ginny’s faces. “I don’t fall in love like that. I can’t. I love people a lot, but not romantically.”
with him?”
He’s gotten better at kissing. It doesn’t feel so strange now that it’s not the mouth of a literal stranger invading his own. At least with Daniel, he knows what to expect. He doesn’t like it, but he doesn’t really mind either.
The whole evening is fine until they're sitting in Daniels flat having just finished a nightcap.
“You needed some air?” Malfoy says, voice dripping with disbelief. He looks – cold. Like he used to, closed off and inaccessible to Harry. Harry hasn’t realised how much more he’s been seeing of Malfoy’s expressions until they’re gone.
and Harry had wavered. Malfoy still doesn’t talk much, but Harry
Harry tries not to let the use of his last name sting him, but fails. Harry knows he’s failing Draco by saying he’s too tired to work. Still, he'll go out and find Matt and some release tonight, and make it all up to Draco in the morning.
“For your head, or whatever that is —,” he gestures to Harry and tosses the chocolate at him. “I swear the dementors left something in the walls of that place.”
“Well, when I came here my brain hadn’t really been able to combine M and Malfoy yet and I felt a bit crazy. But now it’s – I see Draco in everything M has written to me and in everything he did in school and it’s like my brain has accepted that he is one person. So that’s not a problem anymore. But I guess I feel like it should be? I can’t be in love with Draco Malfoy, can I?”
“I don’t care. I’ll deal with that. I just - I want people to know.”
“So, uh,” Harry says when Ron finishes the last bite of his dessert and gives him an expectant look. “I’m aromantic.”
Harry struggles against Matt’s grip, but he only tightens it.
Hermione coughs and looks up at the castle. “We’re almost there, I hope the welcoming feast is as good as I remember!”
“It is, though I’ll deny I ever said so. You’re missing one though.”
“I’ll probably take you up on that,” Harry says. “Take me to the back now?”
“Fuck, Draco, that’s — aah.” Harry breaks off into a moan when the belt hits his arse again.
to break it! That’s the whole point. Fuck.”
Malfoy smiles, and it makes his eyes look warm and Harry suddenly remembers what it was his bladder distracted him from.
"I'd do it today, but I'm completely knackered. I don't think it would be safe for us to try going undercover tonight."
“What’s going on?”
“Sex is really complicated,” Harry says.
Now that he knew who M was, he couldn’t stop inserting Draco Malfoy’s face and voice into his memories of the conversations they’d shared. Draco Malfoy feeling so much shame over his role in the war. Malfoy’s biggest fear being turning into his father. Malfoy telling Harry he was worth more than how useful he was to others. Malfoy teasing him, flirting with him. Malfoy who stayed in a job he hated to build a reputation for himself, and who went above and beyond for his patients.
him. At least now he saw himself. And with that came a strange new power to make choices that felt right to him. He hadn’t had a choice in the constant public attention he received, or the war that got him the attention in the first place but he’d made the choice to leave it behind. He’d made the choice to read, and garden, and to get to know himself better.
Harry stops outside the Dining Hall, falling easily into his new routine as he lets his mind wander. He’s had dreams about Malfoy before, but none that felt so
The doorbell rings just as Ginny opens her mouth, probably to share some real advice and Harry groans. “Who the fuck is here on a Friday morning? Why aren’t they at work?
Ron groaned and looked at the book Harry had left by the firepit from when he’d been reading earlier. “Not you too. Am I the only one who thinks reading is dead boring?”
“Bend your knees,” Draco says, and Harry hurries to comply. He’s happy they’re doing it this way, that he’ll be able to watch Draco as he fucks him. The thought sends shivers through him and he spreads his legs wider.
Harry waits for her to leave the room before grumbling about how being a freelance journalist isn’t really a full-time job even though he knows it is, that Pansy and Draco do double the work when they’re chasing a story and that they really earn the time off in between jobs. He and Ginny had opened the Hogsmeade branch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes after Harry had hated being an Auror and Ginny had felt like she’d experienced everything she wanted from professional flying. It had been a lot of work for a few years, but these days the shop mostly runs itself. They’re still there for a few hours Monday through Thursday, but on Fridays, they stay home to do orders and roll out paychecks and other boring stuff. They’ve secretly hired an accountant that does it all for them at this point, but that’s a well-kept secret.
“You said,” Ginny says, turning to look at Harry, “before we broke up you said that you loved me – but that you felt like you couldn’t love me
Harry’s train of thought breaks at the sound of Malfoy’s voice in his ear. Or his thoughts, as the case is, his thoughts about Harry. The words ‘consummate’ and ‘pre-marital indecency’ jump out at Harry. They must mean sex, the bond will break with sex. Except Malfoy will never want to have sex with Harry, will he?
“I found it in the classroom in sixth year. Better teacher than Snape or Slughorn ever were.”
“I’m not sure that makes me aromantic though. I have a lot of love, for a lot of people, and isn’t love just love? Isn’t that a whole slogan and shit? Love is a feeling you have for people in your life, and it’s different of course. I love Ginny differently than I love Ron and different from how I love Teddy, but it’s all just love.”
Harry’s heart speeds up because this felt every bit as scary as how Ginny described proposing to Pansy had been.
Malfoy points his wand at himself, and suddenly the kiss-swollen man is replaced by the Malfoy Harry has come to know, put together and professional. And impossibly hot.
“I always worry,” Draco says, words breathless. “That you’ll tire of this. That next time you won’t be so -  Ah, fuck.”
“Yeah, alright,” Harry agrees. “Honestly, I didn’t even register what the homework is, so I’ll probably be needing a lot of
“You’d be too, if Ron just said to you what he told me,” Harry says. He presses the back of his hands to his cheeks to try and make some of the redness there subside.
Harry grins at the secret admission Malfoy doesn’t even know he’s made. “Very interesting,” he agrees.
“Merlin, I know I like seeing what my voice does to you Harry, but I had no idea how much I’d get off on hearing you ask for it. Fuck, that’s hot.”
release, and Harry has no idea what he’s going to do about it. He follows Malfoy up the stairs and sees him heading towards the library when he panics.
Harry lay spent and boneless over the bed, relishing in the fact that Draco was still fucking him. He clenched his arse experimentally around the other man, and with a loud curse, Draco stiffened and came, clenching his hands hard around Harry’s hips.
November 10th
Harry snorted. He’d definitely considered all three options when it came to Draco.
Harry searches for a reasonable explanation as to why he’d be out and about that early, and doesn’t find one.
Sydney J. Harris
“Oh,” says Ginny, “I’m sorry Draco, that sounds incredibly sad.”
can he?
Ginny makes a sound of protest but Harry hasn’t taken his eyes off of Draco, and he catches the silencing look he sends her.
Harry looked down at the paper and read the words
Harry stutters, not sure how the hell he’s going to get out of this one.
It takes Harry three months to really claim the aromantic label for himself. He’s still not sure it’s right, that there’s some sort of emotion he just can’t feel - but the term accurately describes what he wants from his life – and when he thinks of it in the literal way of
Draco gave a smile that looked so dangerous Harry would have felt scared if he hadn’t learned to trust Draco by watching how he dominated other people at the BDSM parties. Instead, he just felt aroused. Draco bent down to pick up his wand, and to Harry’s surprise he felt his bonds fall loose. Blood rushed back into his hands and feet and they prickled with returned sensation.
“I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t ready to be here. And I’d never forget a case, especially not
“Of course we’ll communicate before beginning a scene. I’d never do it any other way. Would you be able to say no to doing a scene at all though?” Draco asks, concern settling in his brows and drawing them down.
“I know, Harry,” Hermione says, a pained expression on her face. “But you have to agree how dangerous it is to have people working at the Ministry without any type of formal qualifications. That’s how we ended up with people like Umbridge. Requiring NEWTs is just a start, but it
“You get drinks, I’ll get us food?” Harry suggests.
“Please,” he says again, “just one. Just for the lube. I want to feel all of you.”
“Well, he looks like every stereotype of a drug-dealer rolled into one,” Draco says, gesturing at Matt.
Harry grimaces. “I really hope I never have to do that again. But thank you, and I’ll come with you too – though I hope you never need a wisdom tooth removed.”
Harry instinctively arches his neck more, giving silent permission for Malfoy to suck and bite at the exposed skin.
“Mate, he already told you he had a crush on you as a kid. I hardly think finding out you’re you will put him off,” Ron said.
Harry laughs. “Nah, but give me another decade and maybe I’ll get there.”
After unpacking everything he started reading the books Hermione had bought for the cabin. Of course, there were so many it would probably take him years to get through them all, but that knowledge was comforting somehow. He could stay here as long as he needed and never run out of books to read.
Draco drops his wand to the floor and stares at Matt with disgust. Matt relaxes a little and points to Crabbe.
The cabin was, as promised, a mess. Ron and Hermione had bought furniture and sent over several boxes of things, but they hadn’t assembled or unpacked any of it. Harry spent a good ten minutes searching for a light switch before he realised the cabin didn’t have any electricity at all. After casting a strong Lumos to light the cabin, Harry stopped to take stock. It had potential for beauty, he thought. The walls were made of a rough wood that made it look like the cabin had grown straight from the forest floor instead of being built. The ground floor was just one big room that functioned as a kitchen and living room, and there was a huge fireplace in the middle of it. A wooden ladder took him to an open loft that had room for a mattress to sleep on. Through the windows he saw a small river that made a soothing bubbling sound as it ran by the cabin.
“Absolutely,” she grinned.
Draco barks a cold laugh at that. "Not without backup. It's our rule, Harry."
Harry had been to three parties since then, but he'd never done anything with Malfoy. Not for lack of wanting to. He'd admitted that much to himself the second party when he watched Malfoy blindfold a man and make him wild with light touches and hard smacks. The reason he hasn't done anything with Malfoy was simply because Malfoy kept his distance. Harry could feel his eyes on him when he wasn't looking, but the blond always turned away before Harry could catch him at it.
If nothing else the scream and the lack of coffee distracted him enough from the
Draco turns to Harry then, and Harry aches to know what he’s thinking. To know if he’s ruined this for good or if there is hope for them.
Harry follows Malfoy in a quick stride, and immediately regrets it. Now that he’s standing and moving his bladder is
“Ready to beg yet?” Draco asked, and Harry could hear the self-satisfied smirk in his voice.
“I’ve got an hour before the class starts,” Harry says, confirming that he’s got the time on his schedule right. “I’ll go see if I can find it.”
“You don’t have to be an arsehole to be a Dom, and you
Ron nods. “Yeah, alright. I’ll bring you back something.”
Harry smiles and runs his fingers through Draco’s hair, enjoying the softness. He appreciates the words, or the thought, as it is, but he doesn’t need it. Not when Draco has asked him to stay.
“Stand up,” Draco demands.
Harry laughs at the expression of pure want on Draco’s face, giddy with the fact that Draco loves him back.
“Harry.”
Harry leaves. He chooses to walk out instead of apparating because he needs the air. He walks down a street with lights so bright they block out the stars and that feels like a metaphor for his life somehow. Daniel was right, Harry is a prick. And maybe he’s broken too because he just broke up with his boyfriend, but behind the guilt and self-hatred all he feels is a sense of relief. Like he can finally see the stars behind the streetlights. He takes the bracelet off and lets it slip through his fingers and onto the ground. He inhales and the cold January air fills his lungs to the brink, he exhales it in a half-laugh half-sob because his lungs haven’t worked this well in months.
“Sorry,” Harry says, still anxious about how they feel about the whole thing.
And Harry – well alright Ron is probably right that Harry does want to have sex with Malfoy. At least he’s thought about it. And dreamed about it. Wanked about it too, now that he’s apparently being honest with himself.
Ron frowns and looks down on his empty plate with disappointment. “I suppose I should come too. Can’t believe I got homework on my first day.”
Most of the packing was actually about cleaning, tidying, and taking down spellwork he wasn’t sure Ron and Hermione would want to keep. It wasn’t his cabin after all, and most of the things in it weren’t his either. Outside in his garden he saw the green glow of a spell that floated softly over his tomatoes, indicating that they were ripe.
Martin proves to be clear-headed and cooperative, he assures them he’s a recreational user, and that he’d been perfectly sober when he’d seen Crabbe. Harry lets Draco do the talking, forcing himself to focus on the conversation happening in front of him, instead of yearning for the club. It happens like this sometimes, a slow decline and then suddenly he stops functioning at all. His thoughts tangle and stumble as he watches Draco carefully extract Martin’s memory from the night. He lets Draco drag him out of the flat and side-along him back to the Ministry. He uses the elevator ride from the Atrium to their office trying, and mostly failing, to iron his thoughts back out to something that’s at least a little bit functional.
He dropped the ruined tomato to the ground and turned away. “Just go home Draco.”
Draco takes a look at the towel in Harry’s hand and casts a quick wordless charm that vanishes all of the spilled frosting.
Harry pauses, but Draco doesn’t say anything. Not out loud, and not in Harry’s ear. He must be using Occlumency as hard as he can now, trying to keep Harry out.
October 5th
Harry closed down the Po-cuter and stared at it. M used to have a crush on him. His celebrity crush was Harry Potter, and the thought terrified Harry. His experience dating fans was not good, but then again, M had said it wasn’t really a celebrity crush. That he’d crushed on Harry while seeing him trip over his feet and mess up in class. If nothing else, Harry was M’s type. The idea helped soothe the anxiety he’d felt that M would be horrifically disappointed upon seeing him.
"Draco is fine," he said. "I like a bit of intimacy in my scenes. Especially the first one."
“It’s not your fault. There is nothing wrong with you for wanting the things that you want. Nothing at all. You need to be safe about it though, you need to have a Dom that practices safe, sane, and consensual sex and play. Someone who likes to give the things you like to recieve.”
“Let’s just watch this memory so we can wrap up for today and I can get some sleep.”
Harry leaves Matt in his living room and does just that. He leaves the jeans with his wand in the bathroom and crawls naked into bed. He’s done working, now it’s time to let go.
Harry watches as Draco unbuttons his own shirt to reveal a pale and toned stomach, a trail of hair so light it’s almost invisible from his navel down to his jeans. He lets Draco unbutton his jeans, and steps out of them easily. His cock strains his pants, and he wonders if his pants or Draco’s jeans will come off first.
Harry’s sure the dreams would be survivable if he could have them in the privacy of his own room. There he would feel safe enough to actually
“Just me,” Ron says. “The teachers are having their breakfast separately tomorrow. Some sort of meet and eat thing.”
“Only about a thousand times better,” Harry admitted, laughing a little. “But also, just. Remind me you love me?”
Harry frowned a little. “I don’t know. I mean, I noticed him a lot. I
“If you want nothing to do with me after that’s alright,” Harry says. “I mean, it’ll hurt, but I’ll get it. But at least that way you walk away from it knowing as much about me as I do about you.”
“Can’t relate?” Harry interrupts, “what, since I don’t have a family to lose?” He’s angry, white hot fury burns in his veins, but it pales next to the hurt. The knowledge that this will always have to be kept a secret, if he wants to keep having it.
Harry turns to smile at her. “They’re about as good as I am at relationships.”
“It’s like you’re inviting me in,” Draco observed. “But it’s not quite begging yet, is it?”
“Oh, fun,” Harry says, voice as sarcastic as he can possibly make it. “I get to start my week with Potions.”
Draco looked down at himself and laughed too. “We didn’t make it to the sofa that’s literally two steps away. Merlin, I’ve never been that desperate for anyone.”
“Merlin Harry, are you alright?” Ron asks.
“Maybe you just don’t like casual hookups then,” Ginny says. She’s opened her own soda and Harry decides to take revenge by waiting to speak until she’s mid-drink.
Harry winced at the mention of Alex’s name. He didn’t like to be reminded of what happened when he let people see past his armour.
Harry sighed. He’d become very good at being
“Draco,” Harry rasped. His skin was burning with arousal, and he had no idea how long they’d been there. How long Draco had been running his skilled hands through Harry’s hair. Harry tugged at his restraints again and winced at the pain as the ribbons chafed at his raw skin.
“At least we’ll fly right through our Transfiguration classes,” Ron grins. He reaches out to take Hermione’s hand and smiles warmly at her. “After all, I’m doing the teacher.”
"Fuck, Draco, I want you," he whispered, eying the other occupants in the room and wishing Draco could pull his trousers down and let Harry suck him off, or pull all their clothes off and fuck Harry.
Draco reaches out across the table to grab Harry’s hand. “I know. It gets easier as you go though, and you’re doing great.”
Draco takes him home, Apparating them straight into Harry’s bedroom and kissing him while they’re still breathless from the journey.
Harry sighs. “You stupid shits. Get Draco back here. I know I’m under a bonding spell.”
“What?” he asks, looking between Matt and Crabbe with huge eyes. He’s not entirely sure how much of his fear is acting and how much is real. Draco is close, after all. He’ll keep him safe.
Draco let the tip of his finger slip inside Harry and pushed slowly forward. “Hmm, we’ll see about that, won’t we Potter.”
Harry forces his mouth shut and takes a deep breath. Draco still isn’t saying anything or giving anything away – just staring back at Harry with a cold expression.
Every time his brain got too loud, he dropped what he was doing and sat down to write in his journal, forcing himself to make sense of his thoughts and challenge them.
“If you really are, I’m guessing you won’t mind this,” Malfoy says. He places his hands on either side of Harry’s head and leans forward, lips brushing softly against Harry’s. It’s so chaste it hurts, like the smell of something delicious that leaves you desperate to taste it. It’s a question, Harry realises. Does he really want this? And yes, fuck yes, he does.
Harry had considered going into politics himself but had decided against it. He had been content to help raise money and awareness, because he had no idea on how to actually make laws and policies that worked for everyone. Hermione would be great at it though.
“Absolutely. The crush you missed?”
“That’s what Daniel thought too, so we’re going out Friday.”
Harry tightens his fist around Malfoy, hips thrusting wildly as he chases his orgasm. He’s close now. So fucking close, and it’s Malfoy that’s getting him there. Malfoy who thinks kind, brilliant thoughts about Harry but doesn’t say them out loud.
Harry just shrugs, for fear of coughing again.
“I think it would be cruel to have all of this talk about sex right here at the kitchen table, without showing it any action, don’t you agree?”
“You shut up, I’m in this mess because of that nasty bonding spell you made to cast on my mum,” Harry snaps.
“We’re married,” said Ron simply. “It’s what we do, we share things that are hard with each other, so we don’t have to carry shit on our own.”
“So, are you being quiet because you don’t know how to talk to me in person – or because you’re feeling all the attraction we’ve built up over the past few months with no-one to direct it to hit you like a Bombarda to the chest?” Draco said it casually, like admitting to growing hard watching another man eat tomatoes was a completely normal thing to do. Harry thought he could hear the slight worry beneath the casual tone though, and he appreciated that Draco was at least asking, instead of jumping to the conclusion that Harry didn’t like him.
“It’s not your job to save the world,” Ron said, apparently seeing the guilt on Harry’s face. “I know you were forced to do it, but just because you saved everyone once doesn’t mean you have to keep doing it. If anything, I think it’s somebody else’s turn.”
Draco frowns. “What do you mean?”
Harry tries to look supportive, because if his suspicions are right then Ginny is coming out to him. The expression on his face feels more like confusion though. Ginny has been dating boys for as long as he’s known her. She’d dated him! Wasn’t it a little late to be figuring this all out? If she hadn’t realised before now then… but no.
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco says, “I think I should see your memory from Thursday, just to be prepared in case we run into Matt again. And to make sure we don’t miss anything.”
An hour and some paperwork later, Harry and Draco bring Ayla into their flat and laugh as they watch her run excitedly around and smell everything. Harry busies himself setting up a bed and a bowl for her, and Draco disappears onto the small balcony Harry never uses. Harry goes to fill the bowl with food, and the second the first bit of food hits the bowl Ayla comes running so fast she skids right past Harry and into a kitchen cupboard.
Harry summoned a basket and made Draco hold it while he carefully picked his ripe tomatoes from the plant. They smelled delicious and he was excited to taste them.
“Don’t,” Harry interrupts. “Just – you apologised after the war. And I accepted it. I won’t tell you it’s alright, because it isn’t. And I think you know that. Actually, I don’t think you’d want me to tell you it’s alright because that kinda erases all the work you’ve done to change since the war and –.”
Harry twitches and refuses the urge to look in the direction the softly spoken words are coming from. It’s Malfoy’s voice, but his lips aren’t moving. Harry resists the urge to run out of the room in a panicked search for Hermione, but only just. When Malfoy finally walks past him to chat with whoever’s sat down behind him, Harry pulls his sleeve up and stares in horror at the gold tattoo that circles his wrist.
to hear him. He feels selfish, holding on to the bond and holding back from something they both want just so he can hear praise from Draco. He feels selfish and stupid and completely unwilling to let it go.
“That will be an ongoing struggle, I suspect,” Hermione said. “Other than that, I really like it. Getting to debate people and being able to influence how things are done is just so much more fulfilling than trying to find loopholes in the law to help people out.”
Except they are. Harry curses to himself over his stupid refusal to buy into old myths like knocking on wood when thinking things can’t be
He’d meant what he told M about getting an early night. Millie was coming over for lunch so early it would probably be breakfast for Harry, and he wanted to be fully rested for the conversation.
“Good,” Draco grinned. “Me too. If sex can be that good, I don’t see how people do anything else, actually.”
“You know dental spells are dehydrating. I can’t believe they let you go without someone to take care of you.”
He grabs the schedules from Ron’s hand and tries to stare them into submission. Sharing classes with Ron would have made this whole ‘back to school’ ordeal a little more bearable, so of course they had to take that away from him.
Harry sits up in bed and glares at the afternoon sun outside his window. Draco had loved him, and Harry had been an invasive lying shit, but maybe – maybe Draco deserves to know. Maybe the least Harry can do is let Draco see what he thinks, what he feels. It won’t fix what he’s done, but maybe it’ll make Draco feel less exposed.
“I hadn’t really thought of it that way,” Harry says, “but I kinda like it.”
“It is,” Draco laughs. “I’ve decided isn't really necessary though. I mean, I like it - but I like plenty of things. I don’t have to have all of them all the time.”
Harry feels his legs buckle beneath him, and he grabs onto Malfoy for support. “Malfoy, I need ¬– ah ¬¬– surface.”
Harry signed off before M could answer. He had to have changed since the war, Harry knew that – because he knew M well enough. Or thought he did, at least. But had he changed enough that Harry could accept him? That he could accept Harry? He knew it was possible for people to grow and change. Millie had supported Voldemort too, back then. At least publicly. And now she worked with Harry to raise money for people who were hurt by the war. People who she had been raised to believe were worthless. If Millie had changed then M could have too. And he used a lot of Muggle references, so he must have made an effort.
“A bit, yeah, enough to understand the spell. That when a time is specified it won’t break until that time or with sex.”
“I ran away,” Harry admitted. “Only I don’t know where to run away to.”
Harry gives his partner a weak smile. “I think they were right in that, for the first few years at least.”
“To permanent persons,” he says with a victorious look and holds up his glass.
When he does open the door Malfoy is right outside it, leaning against the wall and picking at his shirtsleeve.
“Well this whole thing is pretty surreal,” Malfoy says, gesturing between them. “Both of us doing sex-work. The two of us, well —”
“Pet?” Draco humms, “It fits you well, I think.”
December 1st
“Draco darling,” Pansy’s voice rings from downstairs. “Do come in. I have a layabout Bi Disaster in my layabout girlfriend’s bed. I need you.”
“What?” Draco says, voice high and eyes huge with surprise.
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Malfoy’s laugh cuts him off. “I know you were trying to figure out what I was up to, there’s no use denying it. You’re really not as good at stalking someone as you like to think.”
His performance complete, Ron fell back onto the sofa with a laugh. “Honestly mate, you do have a weird obsession with names and how they tie to a period of a person’s life or how they act in certain settings.
“Yes, that sounds good, we should probably do that right away.”
A cold feeling of dread spreads through Harry at the Muggle connection. It isn’t often that their Auror work brings them to the Muggle world, and Harry’s grateful for it. There’s a reason Harry always goes Muggle for his hookups, even though his Auror-grade Glamour could fool any wizard. The types of guys Harry usually takes home for the night are also the guys he’d be arresting in the morning. He decided long ago that bringing a criminal Wizard home was too big a conflict of interest.
“It’s nothing you need to know,” he mutters. When he looks back up Malfoy looks – hurt. And that doesn’t bother Harry, it really doesn’t because why would it? But he can’t afford to make Malfoy upset enough to want to run away from him, can he?
“I can fuck your mouth, or I can fuck your arse,” Draco said roughly. “Choose.”
“Treacle tart, though I’ll never understand it. Favourite class?”
“Knows what?” Harry demands. His wrist is turning colder, and he turns half panicked to check if Malfoy is moving further away but he’s stopped in front of an empty table and is unpacking his things.
“Fuck, Draco, feels so good. I’m – aah, close.”
“True, but we never agreed that you’ve ever stopped being an idiot.”
“I used to wonder if everyone who was supposed to be my family was up there,” Harry admits. “My parents and Sirius at first, and then Remus too.”
“Merlin’s tits, Potter, you’re so hot. You have no idea. The things you say, the way you look kneeling and bending over my bed like this. I could spend hours eating your arse, bringing you to the edge again and again. Or I could fuck you hard and fast.”
“Anything chocolate, and mine?” Harry shoots back.
Ron had thought it weird that Harry and Ginny had chosen to continue with their plan of moving in together despite breaking up. There was something comforting about Ginny though, and neither of them had wanted to live alone while they searched for someone to share their lives with. Nine years later they still haven’t found that someone, but their friendship has flourished.
Harry shakes his head. “Maybe later, but nothing I can think of now.”
He studies Malfoy and considers what he’ll be comfortable doing with the man. “I’m alright with the bondage you suggested too, but for whatever reason, I’m not super-into having my hands and feet tied together, separately is fine though.
Harry smiles and brushes Draco’s hair from his eyes. It’s the first time Draco has asked him, at least out loud. He’d thought it every time they got off together, ever since that first time, but he’s never actually
Harry gasps in mock offense. “Frodo is the most emotionally constipated Hobbit I’ve ever seen. I don’t want to be like Frodo, I want to be like Merry.”
Bloody Malfoy would like Harry embarrassed.
“I erased every memory he has of you, well of Henry really. Except the conversation you had on your sofa. And I gave him a false memory of what happened later, like we would have done if Henry was a legitimate undercover identity.
It was fast, intense, and probably too clingy. Harry felt too intense a lot, when it came to Draco. He never felt
“Greg and I didn’t realise how wrong Voldemort was until it was too late to turn back; too late to earn forgiveness. Yet here I am,” Draco gestures to their office. “While Vincent, who realised how fucked up it all was before Voldemort even returned and acted to do the right thing, died believing he’d murdered his friends and the leader of the side he’d chosen.”
“So we’ll be patient with each other?” Draco asks, “And practice a lot.”
“It’ll be fun to see if they got any of it right,” Harry says. “But we can’t watch it yet.”
“I, uhm, I love you,” Harry repeats. “I know you don’t — I just, I can’t help it. I love you.”
“Where is he then?” Harry asks, tilting his head to give Matt access to his neck.
“Please what?” Draco asks, finger running back and forth over Harry’s opening and making him push back for more.
By 6 am Harry is pacing the hallway instead of his room. He’s nervous. What if Draco doesn’t want to watch the memories? What if he ignores Harry completely? Fuck, maybe Harry really has ruined this forever? But he can’t think that. He has to try because as much as he’d like to deny it Draco Malfoy has become something Harry never thought he could be. Something so much more than a repressed desire. More than attraction. More than a crush. They’ve only been together for a couple of weeks, and they haven’t even said it. That they’re together, or were together. They just went from not talking, to hanging out a little, to hanging out a lot and then to sleeping together. If Harry hadn’t been able to hear Draco’s thoughts, he might think it had been just sex. But Harry did hear his thoughts, and it hadn’t been just sex.  Harry hasn’t known the grown-up version of Draco for long, so maybe he shouldn’t be feeling it this intensely. Maybe he should still be able to close his eyes and picture his future without Draco in it. Or maybe this is how it feels, when you finally find someone who makes you feel like the world is bright and filled with opportunity. Maybe this intensity isn’t wrong, but just his instincts screaming at him that this is
Ron sat up straight on the sofa and messed up his hair. He made circles with his fingers and held them over his eyes, imitating glasses. “I can’t be Harry Potter anymore. I need to be just Harry. They’re different people. I can’t call him Malfoy, or M. I need to use Draco, they’re all three of them the same person, but also not, so they need different names.”
He turned abruptly to Harry. “That goes for you too, you’re both the bloody same. Always trying to carry the world on your own shoulders so nobody has to share the burden. Only it wouldn’t be so much of a burden if we shared it.”
When Harry starts fucking Malfoy they don’t tell anyone. It’s pure chance really, running into each other at the Muggle club. The sex is amazing though, after years of pent up tension between them. Malfoy isn’t scared to take Harry hard and fast, and he’s not scared when Harry gives as good as he gets. The next time they see each other, at a Ministry function, they do it again. And then again, and again. There isn’t any point telling anyone, Harry thinks, because it’s just sex and it won’t last. It’s not worth the trouble of seeing the hurt in his friends’ eyes at realising he’s being fucked by an ex-death eater.
For weeks after reading the article he’d walked around in a numb trance constantly having to expel phrases like, ‘I thought he’d be brave, but he still wakes up screaming sometimes’ and, ‘He’s not at all the man I expected him to be, I honestly feel cheated’ from his head. Lisa and Ben, before Alex, had felt the same way. They wanted Harry to be the strong and capable man they’d seen in the papers. They wanted to be on his arm in pictures in the Prophet and to attend fabulous parties. Only when they got to know him better, did they discover that Harry didn’t really like being famous, and preferred to keep his personal life private, and that he spent most of his time at home if he could help it. They learned that he wasn’t some strong stoic hero but just a bloke who liked to bake, and they felt disappointed. Not just disappointed, they felt tricked because the man they’d fallen in love with didn’t exist.
Draco made Harry go over what he was okay doing, and what he wanted Draco to do. He made sure they both remembered the safe word they’d agreed on for their rougher explorations of each other, and then told Harry to go to bed and wank without getting himself off.
“Not gay, I think. Felt the same as with you and that brunette girl. So I guess I like both? All? Honestly, I feel mostly confused.”
“Stop distracting me,” Harry says, fighting the urge to just screw the lube and let Malfoy finish him off like this. Malfoy asked for lube though, and anyone who’s making Harry feel this good deserves what they ask for.
“What’s wrong?” Ginny asks. Pansy sighs and moves closer to the edge of the bed so they’ll all fit properly.
Harry feels a bit odd, walking naked and hard through his living room and up the stairs to his bedroom. He throws himself on the bed, and tries to calm his breathing. His cock is wet with precome, and he grabs onto the sheets in an effort to keep from touching it. He listens to the sound of Draco wandering around downstairs, opening and closing cupboards and wonders what the fuck he’s doing. It isn’t long though, before he hears footsteps on the stairs.
“About to fuck?” Harry laughs. “If I’m honest I’ve wanted your cock up my arse since the war.”
without giving your whole self up. And we were kids so we thought there was some sort of twisted romance to that, to a relationship eating away at you until there wasn’t you or me, only us.”
“It does, doesn't it? Draco grins. “Especially considering neither of us particularly enjoy living alone and we greatly enjoy each other's company.”
“Sorry,” he laughs. He looks at Daniel and he smiles, pulling Harry back towards the sofa. Harry doesn’t like to look at him – he’s never liked looking too much during sex. It pulls him out of the sensations and into somewhat panicked thoughts of ‘
“Alright then,” Draco says finally. “Tell me what happened last night.”
“I’m in love with you too,” Draco repeated, taking another step closer. “I’m sorry I messed it up, I’m sorry I hurt you. Please, may I have another chance?”
Ron grins. “I’d wager Snape put a fireproofing charm on it. Remember how angry he got with Neville when he let his book get too close to the cauldron and it caught fire?”
“It’s only selfish if you’re taking something away from someone by doing it,” Draco says. “And you’re not. Actually I, well, there’s a reason I’m so fervently thinking those things and biting my tongue to keep silent.”
“You like those movies way too much,” he says. “But yeah, I’ll get the first one ready.”
Draco seems to struggle with the answer, mouth opening and closing several times before he sighs and pulls out his wand. Harry looks at Draco, ready to ask what’s going on when he notices something pressing against his consciousness. Harry was never good at Occlumency, but the gentle nudge against his brain is so soft and questioning even he could turn it away. He doesn’t though, just raises a questioning eyebrow at Draco and lets the magic through.
“The good ones are supposed to be better,” Ginny says, and she looks sad. “They’re supposed to feel wonderful and leave you wanting more. I mean, Pansy and I have been talking about moving in together in the near future, because we just want to be together all the time.”
October 21st
“Feel good too,” Harry says, words almost slurring with relaxing into Draco.
"No!" Harry says, desperate to make Daniel understand. "I didn't hate all of it. I enjoy spending time with you, I do! I've enjoyed getting to know you – I just feel off doing the romance stuff because I know I should be feeling something that's just not there. And I enjoyed the sex too. You're great at that, really, just – I like the sensations of it, you know, the act. Not –."
“You knew I was M since December 18th.”
Harry grins with his secret knowledge and releases Malfoy’s hand. He reaches out with lubed fingers to touch Malfoy’s cock, and groans in satisfaction at the weight of it in his hand. The groan turns to a moan when Malfoy’s wet hand closes tight around his cock and starts to move.
“Ron can pick them out,” Harry says. “He knows what I like, and I like to be surprised.”
“Fuck,” Harry says when his breathing is almost back to normal. “That was, just, fuck.”
’. Draco still calls him Potter half the time, but he always thinks
“I just didn’t sleep well,” Harry says.
“I’ll tell Crucio you might contact him for some work,” Matt says, “might tell him about your brilliant arse while I’m at it. Could probably earn some money off that too.”
“Why don’t you?” Harry asked, his voice almost a whisper.
The morning didn’t bring any sudden inspiration as to what he should do, but he’d slept better than he had in months and his magic tingled in his veins, telling him it was ready to be put to use. Ron and Hermione would know what to do. They always knew better than he did. He Apparated again, this time with a destination in mind.
. What would happen to the charities he supported, or the social issues he brought attention to?
“I’m sorry I invaded your privacy. I’m sorry I hurt you. I put my memories in a Pensieve. I’d like you to watch them, if you want. That way you can hear my thoughts too.”
been delicious.
“Hey, so I’m going to go sit with Malfoy.”
Harry barks a laugh. “Not sure my comfort matters much when you can’t even look at me in class. Kinda makes it hard to teach me, right?”
“I dreamed too,” Harry admits.
want, instead of trying to want things I don’t?” Harry asks, feeling like the task is somehow more daunting than trying to want what he’s been told he should for his whole life.
“Thank you, it’s perfect!” Harry says, offering Malfoy a grin. “Two sugars and a bit of milk?”
“Told you bondage and impatience was a bad combination,” Draco said, running one of his hands through Harry’s hair to play with the soft tufts at the nape of his neck.
Harry comes hard, the weeks of erotic dreams with no release combined with Malfoy’s skilled hands and mouth makes his orgasm intense. Pleasure rushes over him like a waterfall, and he feels it everywhere. Distracted, he releases Malfoy’s cock and moans as Malfoy wanks him through his orgasm.
“You’re evil, I hope you recognize that.” Her stern expression is without its usual effect because of the smile she’s fighting. She holds it for three impressive seconds before grinning widely.
“Mmh,” Harry says, leaning back and pushing his arse closer to Draco’s hand.
“Would you mind if I told Charlie?” he asks, looking at Harry. “It’s alright if you’re not comfortable yet – just, I think he’s aromantic too, maybe, but I don’t think he knows it’s a
“The coming all over my chest or the sex? Because both, honestly. So fucking much.”
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Draco says. “Take your pants off and lean over the table.”
“And what if I am?” Harry challenges, forcing his chin up so he’s meeting Malfoy’s eyes again. His heart is still beating at full force, sending Harry’s whole body into overdrive. His cock hardens as Malfoy steps closer, and it’s so much like Harry’s dream that he can’t help but anticipate what comes next.
“Turn back around and sit up.”
“I didn’t say you did,” Ron said. “I just said you’ve always had this pull to him, in one way or another. So, when I give it a little thought, I’m not actually surprised you ended up falling for him.”
mean to listen to Draco’s thoughts.
“I’m happy,” he says, wondering if somewhere, beyond the train Harry never boarded when he died, his parents can hear him. “I don’t have what you two did. The whole romantic thing, I mean. It’s not really for me. I’ve spent my life looking for someone. Someone to fill that gaping hole I’ve always felt, to bridge the gap between me and the rest of the world.”
Draco grabs the note out of Harry’s hand. “Fucking Brown.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I shouldn’t put this on you, it’s not fair. I’ll go.”

"I suppose we'll have to go undercover in the Muggle drug-world, I've no idea how else we're going to find him."
“I can’t be here. 20 yards?” Draco asks.
had been less enjoyable, but Harry appreciated the concerned tone. Malfoy is never mocking in his thoughts, never rude or derisive. He’s just – kind, and complimentary and observant.
“Don’t you want to wait for Granger and Weasley like usual?” Malfoy asks.
Draco pulled Harry down into a kiss, his fingernails gently scraping Harry’s scalp and sending shivers down his spine.
“I’d like to tell Ron and Hermione,” Harry says one night, curled around Draco in the bed they share more often than not.
“So we’ve got one of us with abandonment issues, and another who’s terrified of being known?” Harry says, smiling. “We can make that work, can’t we?”
Draco pulls off him with a satisfied grin. “Merlin, you’re so eager for it. You look so good when you’re chasing pleasure.”
“I’m going to take your pants off now,” Malfoy says. His hands wrap around Harry from behind, running down the knots in the rope and finding the waistband of Harry’s pants. Harry breathes in anticipation, but Malfoy doesn’t stop to pull them off yet, instead moving his hands further down to rub Harry’s cock through his pants. Harry arches his back, gasping at the combined sensation of the ropes against his skin and the pressure on his cock. He closes his eyes and lets the sensations take over, carrying him to that place where want and touch and pleasure are the only things that matter.
