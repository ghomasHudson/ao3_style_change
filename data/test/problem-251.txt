I feel like I'm getting my writing mojo back a bit. Hopefully it;s going to stick around!
“Ginny!” Everyone stopped what they were doing, preparing to back Ginny up or move out of the firing line. “I love it!” Molly gasped, running up to inspect the hair further. “It suits you so much better than that long hair that you just used to chuck up in bun. Oh sweetie, it’s lovely.” The room breathed a collective sigh of relief and Molly pulled Ginny down to her height to kiss them on their cheek, then give them instructions on what task they needed to complete next. Ginny smiled and wandered off to feed the chickens, winking at Harry as they passed.
Ginny begins to plant a seed of an idea in Harry.
“It’s perfect, Harry, it really is.” Ginny thought for a moment. “You should open your own salon.” As they said that, something stirred in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
Sleep soon claimed Harry again and his dreams were strange. He dreamt he was flying on a broom and he was looking for something. He assumed it was the snitch. He kept looking behind him, as though he was expecting someone to come chasing after him, but no one was there. He set his eyes on the target again. Where was that damned gold ball? His attention was caught again by a flash of silvery white just behind him. He whirled around and Malfoy was flying inches away from him. He smelled like coffee and leather and fresh, crisp linen. Harry wanted to stuff his face into Malfoy and breathe him in. Malfoy was ear to ear with him now and he could practically feel the electricity jumping between them. And then Malfoy was in front of him, long hair flowing behind him in the wind. A waft of apple caught Harry’s nose and somehow it made perfect sense that Draco bloody Malfoy used apple scented shampoo. Harry saw the snitch. He tried to fly faster but he couldn’t get past Malfoy, who was annoyingly flying at a leisurely pace in front of him. He willed his broom faster, closer, and suddenly it obliged. Harry smashed into Malfoy and could feel and smell and almost taste the other man. They both fell down towards the ground, Harry trying desperately to grab hold of the other man before they hit the ground.
Harry loved the outfit that he was wearing for the wedding. It consisted of charcoal grey dress robes with a white shirt, lilac tie and shiny black brogues. He took a last look in the mirror and smoothed his hair down before going to find Ron. When he did, Ron was sat with Bill, Charlie, George and Percy. He looked as excited as Hermione had been. It was 45 minutes before the wedding; fifteen minutes before they had to go and meet McGonagall who would be officiating the wedding. She’d cried when Ron and Hermione had asked her, saying that she would be honoured. When they went into the garden it was jam packed full of people; family and friends were everywhere they looked. They were all congratulating Ron as he walked towards the bandstand like gazebo where McGonagall stood, reading through some documents. Chairs were set out on the large lawn with a lilac carpet running down the middle of them leading towards the gazebo. Each chair had a Lilac or silver sash hung over it and they shimmered in the sun. Harry patted his pocket absentmindedly for what felt like the hundredth time since Ron had handed him the rings, making sure they were still there. Ron was busy signing documents and talking to McGonagall.
Lunch was laid out in a similar way to breakfast, but instead of being served in the kitchen, it was laid out on tables outside. The tables were almost bowing under the weight of twenty different kinds of sandwiches, pork pies, sausage rolls, quiches, more cuts of cold meats, a huge salad that had been prepared fresh from the garden, dips, crisps, more fruit, cakes and biscuits. Arthur had also prepared a variety of different juices. While they were eating, Harry decided to speak to Dean and Seamus about their business. The idea that Ginny had planted in his head the day before had been growing, and he’d been thinking more and more about it. When he asked how they’d known how to run a business, they laughed.
“Maybe.” They said, laying it carefully on the top of a chest of drawers. Harry carried on cutting, the scissors making a satisfying slicing noise as they slid effortlessly through the hair. When he was satisfied with what he had achieved with the scissors, he moved on to the hair clippers. He shaved the sides of their head and the back, leaving a nice length of hair on the top. He then went back to his scissors to thin and blend the hair to make the transition between long and short smoother. The final cutting step was to use his favourite tool- his straight razor. He carefully removed the fine hairs at the back of Ginny’s neck and tidied bits and bobs up. He then blow-dried the hair, using a little bit of product to keep the hair in a quiff-like style. The hair was super soft after cutting years of length off and it suited Ginny’s angular face beautifully. He’d barely shown Ginny their new look when arms were being thrown around his neck and he was being kissed hard on the cheek. He squirmed out of the embrace, scared for his ribs.
“First I need to tell you something.” She sucked in another breath as if to steady the words that she was just about to say. “I’m not a girl. Harry, I think I’m non-binary. Or gender fluid. I haven’t quite figured it out yet.” Ginny dropped their eyes downwards and swallowed.
Harry was woken up early that morning. At 07:04 exactly, Ron was shaking his shoulder to wake him.
“Erm, Hermione’s, Fleur’s, yours, your mums, Audrey’s, Lucy’s and Luna’s, when she gets here.” Ginny nodded, glancing up at the clock on the wall. It was just gone nine.
Sorry I haven't posted for a little while, writer's block is a bitch.
“Are you sure? I’m just so scared it’s wishful thinking.” Harry nodded.
“Thanks, but I’m not. I don’t think. I mean, maybe?” The idea was growing on Harry, but he knew nothing about owning a business. Maybe he’d talk to Seamus and Dean at some point. They obviously knew something about it, owning their own. He bit into his bacon sandwich, hoping that him having a mouth full of food would stop people asking him questions. That didn’t, but Molly walking in and seeing Ginny’s hair did.
Sorry I couldn’t be there sooner, I love my job at The Quibbler but it’s so hard to be able to take time off. Tomas is taking over the fort tomorrow and the day after, but I had to be here to set everything up and make sure everything would run smoothly while I was away. I’m sure he’ll manage though, he’s a good lad.
“A new shop opened up called Boot and Bones. Terry and Susan from Hogwarts while you were there opened it up and their work is fantastic.” Ginny looked like they were mentally taking note, and Harry suspected it wouldn’t be long before they got one too.
“You feel kinda warm and clammy. Go back to bed.” Harry shook their hand off and insisted that he was fine.
“Shit Gin, I didn’t realise it was so late. I can’t even remember what time we went to bed last night” Another yawn forced itself out of Harry’s mouth, obscuring the last word he said. Ginny let the serious look drop from their face and laughed.
“Yeah. I told her. I nearly passed out I was so nervous. She just laughed in that way that she does and hugged me.”
“She can’t just make up what she is.” Percy sounded like a petulant child.
“What time is it?” Harry asked. Fleur informed him that it was a little past five and told him he should eat something. He nodded again, promising her that he’d try. She smiled at him and walked out of the room, glancing back at him before she left.
Please also pass on my congratulations and best wishes to Fleur and Bill on the birth of their baby.
He was helping Ginny train when the rain came. He felt one drop at first, then another, and another. Then there was a torrential downpour and both him and Ginny stood where them were, shocked. The ground soon turned slippery with sludge and they both took the rare opportunity to let their inner child take over and they began pushing each other into the mud. When their sides ached from laughing and Ginny’s hair was brown from the mud, they went back inside. Harry had gratefully accepted a cup of tea and small plate of biscuits off Molly after a quick shower and Ginny had gone for a long soak in the bath that Harry had put on to run.
Harry Potter”
The rest of Harry’s day was spent lounging. While he didn’t feel particularly ill anymore, his energy levels weren’t very high, so he took the opportunity to rest, eat and drink tea. He spent a lot of time in the reading nook in the front room. It was one of his favourite places to be because he could alternate between reading, napping and watching the chickens out in the garden. It rained in the evening and he went out to a sheltered place and relished the feel and smell of freshness in the air. He hoped it was a sign of good change coming to him, even though he’d never really believed in omens or divination. When he went to bed, he slept much better. He couldn’t remember his dreams but they weren’t nightmares, and for that he was thankful.
See you later, my darlings! ♡
All the memories were dark. There were memories of an electrocution chair. People speaking Russian. Assassinations. Screams. Begging. A lot of torturing, both him to others and HYDRA to him. A couple of memories with Steve but they were mainly the memories of HYDRA.
"Do you have any photos?" Pepper asked.
Harry just smiled from his place by the doorframe. Severus came over to him and noticed a blood red patch on his dragon hide armor. "Harry. You're bleeding."
"It's a sign of happiness, I guess. It's a white-blue misty animal that represents you and your true love or someone important to you. When I was younger, my Patronus was a stag, just like my fathers. Now, it's a dragon. One of their main purposes is holding back dementors. Dementors suck the soul out of you and replays your worst experience while a patronus uses a powerful, happy memory to fight it back. In third year, when Sirius escaped, we had Dementors circling the school. During the train ride, a dementor got in the train while looking for Sirius. Everything got cold. I could hear a woman's scream. Then I passed out, but Remus, who was in the same train compartment as us, cast a patronus and sent it away. I later found out that the woman's scream was my mothers before she died to Voldemort."
"No.. No. I'm fine, thank you though," He smiled a bit fakely.
"That guys
"Like I was being stabbed a thousand times but lived through all of them just to go through it again." Harry answered.
"Then we'll take over the Ministry."
"It's his fault the Death Eaters got into Hogwarts and that Dumbledore is dead! If he had still been here, my Colin would still be alive. He deserves to die!"
"Piece of cake, Quill." Tony said after he pushed the wreckage onto Thanos then flew away.
Once in the training room, Harry discovered Barton was sparring with Natasha Romanoff.
"Just something for my studies. I heard that someone in Camelot might be able to help me."
" Tony and Drax yelled.
"Uncle Sev talks about my papa all the time and Uncle Natasha talks about Uncle Sirius but whenever I ask my dad about them he always just spaces out. Aunt Nat said her friend Clint knew Teddy the best but he's not around anymore, so I don't know who can tell me about him. Uncle Sev said you two were close."
"To check something out and pick up food. I'm assuming we're all very hungry." Draco lied. Well, partially lied. They would have to pick up food after or else it'd look suspicious.
They each put their ring on the other then stood up to hug each other. Both were sobbing happily before a small explosion was heard. Draco laughed a bit, "You left your potion out too long."
Before he could react, Weasley stepped into their wards. Draco started throwing spells at Weasley who was deflecting them easily. Harry, at some point, joined the battle, and more spells were thrown. At one point, the Potters were winning, then the next, their wards were down, more Aurors came and joined in, Harry almost got captured, Draco was hit by some dangerous Curse, was bleeding profusely but still fighting, Harry got really mad, let his emotions take control and the Aurors had to disapparate considering half their men were down.
Arthur nodded, "Merlin still doesn't know how after all these years."
"How did you—?"
Harry came up behind Draco and kissed his hair softly. "Are you okay?"
"He did what? Wait, don't answer that. You'll tell me later."
"Harry. It's me. It's Sirius."
Merlin, looked at where the Dorocha were coming from, the same Veil that had taken Lancelot. Outside the Veil stood the Cailleach.
Upstairs in the Wakandan Royal Palace, Severus watched as Princess Shuri turned to dust.
Harry walked into the the compound. He walked up to Natasha and Steve. "I need to talk to Loki."
Harry realized it had almost been an hour, so he finished what he had to say.
"Hey, Buck. This nice," Steve started, ignoring Severus rolling his eyes, "man is gonna fix your mind."
"Where should we go?" Draco asked, already starting to run again.
Draco knocked on the door of the guest room which had turned into Sirius' room. "Um. Sirius? Can I talk to you?" He asked.
"Malfoy." He called out when he hadn't been noticed.
She grabbed more parchment and started working.
"And you got this when?"
would know more healing spells!"
"I was only 4 1/2 months pregnant, so the Aurors wouldn't have known that we were going to have a baby. They probably would've still killed us though." Draco took a deep breath and wiped his tears away. "We decided to tell you and Ted because October 31st is next week and she's all I've been thinking about recently."
"Drink this. It'll get your energy up as Legilimency takes a lot out of a person." He told Barnes. Once he watched Barnes take it, he turned to Steve, "He's going to remember everything. It'll hurt him mentally. He will most likely need to go to therapy and need to talk to someone about everything without being judged. He needs to accept that fact that it wasn't him doing these things, it was HYDRA before he can move on."
There was one last thing Hermione had to do before going back home. She stepped into Gringotts and asked for the Potter accounts manager, Griphook.
"Ready?" Harry asked Draco, already knowing what to expect, unlike Draco who never drank it before.
Harry was right. Draco did have the most gorgeous gray eyes. But that didn't matter as his love was dying.
"Well, I'm here, aren't I? And since you're here too, I'm assuming this its heaven."
I'm also on
"Right, thanks Loki. If you want you can stay and watch me make the Runes but that won't be fun. You should just go back to Earth."
"Um... you have security tapes of me bleeding out then coming back, I think that's enough proof."
"You're right."
"Okay. Okay. You'll catch me up later. Wait. Important question. Who were the DADA teachers your 6th and 7th year. "
She had obviously brought the trunk to the dinner and after dinner she was going to open it.
Tony had pulled up the footage from the nursery, skipped through the whole story then played the video right before Scorpius spoke. Draco swore he watched that video a million times.
"Do you wanna say the name or should I?" Harry asked him.
"Follow me." He smiled innocently before stepping through the trunk.
The Potters made their way over quickly. Sirius took Teddy from Pietro and laid him down on a couch.
The area was swarming with Dementors. The temperature had dropped significantly.
All the Avengers besides Thor stumbled and took a couple seconds to get back up after the Apparation experience.
"Just one more thing. The High Priestesses built the Veil years ago. You cannot trick its magic. It is more powerful than this school."
Bucky burst out into laughter.
"Oh, yes, the brothers who defied death. Those are very powerful objects, wizard. They can be used in the way you'd like them to. Once the sky is colored brightly, a man of grey shall usher forth the return of monsters and a world's doom. Once the balance shifts, a proposition shall cause a rise of a new god and a fall of friends. When the day comes that the sky is thick with water, a broken man shall bring the end of wealth and an era of sorrow. When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony."
"Arthur." Merlin said when he looked at him.
Stark whined. "I'm Tony Stark. Or Iron Man. That's Steve Rogers, Captain America. Then there's Clint Barton, Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff, Black Widow. Then the giant blonde with the hammer is Thor. And the one sitting with the Doctor, is Doctor Bruce Banner, or the Hulk."
They had landed the Jet a couple yards away from the energy surge.
"He's unconscious, like you were. But he's been like that for five weeks. You've only been out for a couple hours."
Before he realized it, he had tired himself out and stopped. He breathed heavily looking at the mess of a wall that was left.
"Fine. Then is Dragon better?"
"Harry Potter, what do you know about him?" Hermione asked, getting straight to the point.
"How far along are you?" Steve asked.
"Your soul guardian is the creature of the beast. Her movement has begun. She will make her appearance when the moon blocks the sun and the light is at it's lowest."
"Hey, Scorp. I know we haven't been spending much time together since, y'know the Snap. But I wanna take you out today. We can go watch a movie or to a carnival or to the park. Whatever you want, bud."
Malfoy didn’t say much while Harry spoke, bar making small sounds of acknowledgement, or asking for clarification when needed. He bit the inside of his cheek while concentrating. Harry had never noticed he did that before.
“Damn right you’re going to. Now, we should probably actually unpack while we’re up here.” Harry realised that he was eaves dropping and carried on to the kitchen as quickly and quietly as he could. He’d just discovered a newfound respect for Audrey.
His body jerked violently as his eyes flew open. Hermione was sat beside him looking worried.
It wasn’t long before everyone had taken their seats and the band struck up a slow melody. Tingles ran down Harry’s spine as he saw Hermione. Her dress was phenomenal. The lace was intricately patterned and beaded, and it twinkled softly in the sunlight. It was loose and floaty, brought in with a band of hand sewn soft purple flowers around the middle, matching the ones that were embroidered onto her veil. She had a waterfall bouquet made up of ivy, lavender, white lilies and dark purple tulips. Harry looked behind her to see Ginny in similar dress robes to him, but they were a soft lilac with silver trim. They looked so proud of their best friend that they could hardly contain it. Behind Ginny were Luna and Fleur. They looked like wood Nymphs, both of them almost gliding along and radiating beauty. Their dressed matched Ginny’s dress robes in colour and were made of a floaty material that flattered them and make them look almost ethereal. Harry could barely take his eyes off the four of them and he felt himself welling up. That was, until a flash of white caught his eye.
“Those vegetables are looking magnifique, Arthur.” Fleur exclaimed, and Arthur thanked her, eyes sparkling with pride.
“’Course I will Gin. How do you want it? We can have so much fun with it!” Harry could feel the excitement tingling at him.
Sincerely,
Neville, Dean and Seamus arrived later on that day. They were going to spend the couple of days before the wedding putting together gazebos and marquees to give people places to shelter from the heat. Neville was in charge of living flower arrangements, including flowers that glowed with soft light when it went dark that would provide lighting in the evening. The next couple of days were bound to be full of stress, work and excitement. None of them minded, however, as they’d been promised Molly and Ron’s cooking. Harry was looking forward to watching everyone creating and working with the things they loved. It was fascinating to him to see people so passionate about things. He was charged with odd jobs and then styling the hair of the bridal party, which included Hermione the bride, Ginny as the maid of honour and Fleur and Luna as the bridesmaids. He couldn’t wait to see what they all looked like after he’d finished, especially when they were all in their beautiful clothes.
“Sure, Gin, what is it?” His brow furrowed slightly, concern edging in.
“What’s wrong with me?” He managed to rasp out. His throat was dry and scratchy.
“Harry, wake up.” He recognised the soft voice and as his eyes opened a gentle face and blonde hair came into view. Luna was smiling down at him. She sat next to him and offered him a cup of tea, which he gladly accepted.
Anyway, I’m sorry this letter is so short, but I have to get back to work. I’ll see you tomorrow!
“You alright mate?” Ron’s concerned face came into focus over his cup of tea.
“No, I’ll be fine, thank you. This really isn’t that much compared to what I’m usually lugging around the office. I’ll see you tomorrow. I’m sure my plus one is looking forward to seeing you too” She smiled at him and walked off to deliver the papers to Hermione, leaving Harry wondering who she was planning on bringing, and why said person would be so happy to see him. He couldn’t tell if she was being sarcastic or not.
“Hey Gin, what’s up?” Harry forced the words through a yawn, reaching to grab his glasses from the bedside table.
“The Secret,” Arthur whispered theatrically, the whole room leaning in slightly to hear the revelation, “Is to eat some of the peas from every fifth pod, for quality control.” He held one of the peas out for Lucy and she sucked it up out of his hand, giggling.
“You want to keep it?” He asked.
“Don’t mind him, he doesn’t get out very often with work, and when he does it’s to go golfing with his colleagues. He looks bloody ridiculous in those damned socks.”
“Your 2:30 is here, Sir.’ The barista told the man. He looked up to where Harry was stood, and his grey eyes widened in surprise. Blaise clearly hadn’t told him who his 2:30 appointment would be. He stood up and extended a hand as Harry walked towards him, taking in his dark grey suit and plum coloured shirt, which he wore open slightly with no tie.
Teddy nodded, "Okay, I'll go first. Draco, I think you were the first person to actually care about me besides my grandmother. You always came over to visit me with your mom. I loved all our talks, or mainly your talks since I couldn't really talk until later. You taught me so much in such a short amount of time. I remember when I was old enough to understand why my parents weren't there, I remember asking Gran if you could come over because I was sad. And you did come over. You helped me even though you had so many other things to worry about besides me. You would take me to your office because Gran was out and I didn't want to be alone. So, thank you. Even when you disappeared, I always knew I would have you by my side telling me that I would be fine, just like you said before. I love you so much. Um, Harry. You were probably the only person that could really talk to me about my dad. I had Gran to tell me about my mom but you always talked about Dad. I know you didn't have much time with him, but it was more than I had and I wanna say, thank you for sharing his adventures with me. I know you could never spend too much time with me because I reminded you of them, but you still tried your best and I really love that about you. I love you so much," He ended, wiping his tears on his sleeves.
"Natasha Romanoff. The Black Widow. Why don't you introduce yourself to the rest of the group?"
The married couple was standing in the living room, Draco looking a bit nervous while Harry looked ecstatic. The rest of the Potters were sitting on the various couches.
When the team split up, Steve, Wanda, Pietro, Harry, Teddy and Sirius were in charge of making sure everyone was evacuated. Thor, Clint, Natasha, Bruce and Draco were fighting against the bots that were making their way to the city. Tony was trying to reason with Ultron, although he was failing at it. Ultron revealed that he had a machine set up that would first lift the city from the ground, bring it up high enough, then drop it, causing global extinction. Vision, who was made of what was left of JARVIS, went to fight against Ultron after Tony went to help defenses.
"I missed you too, pup. Now," He pulled away from the hug. "Tell me about your wedding."
"Scorpius. He's helped a lot. He doesn't realize he's helping, but he is." Draco looked at Arthur, "It also helps if you accept your feelings for him."
Severus wasn't expecting anything big for his birthday. He never liked celebrating it.
"You seem oddly okay with that. Why?"
"Of course," Draco smiled, "So, is that a yes for my question?"
"What, my Master of Death-ness?" Harry snorted.
"Okay, so we have an announcement." Harry said then he turned to Draco, "Do you wanna say it or should I?"
When he stood in front of his cell, he was both saddened and disgusted. Here was the father of his husband in all his glory. A prisoner because of his ideals.
"We've decided who's coming with us. Obviously, Merlin, Arthur and I. Then, Draco, Sirius, Gwaine, Tony and Loki." Harry said to the group after discussing it with Merlin and Arthur.
"We don't want him to bleed out anymore, you dunderhead!"� Severus yelled back.
By the time everyone, or most everyone, was off the city, the Avengers (now including the twins), stood together to stop Ultron or any of the bots from activating the switch on the core that would drop the island. Once the main Ultron was ripped to shreds, the Avengers (minus Wanda who stayed to protect the core) went to help get the rest of the people off the island that was still going higher.
"Right, well, I told Merlin everything and he took me to meet the Great Dragon, Kilgharrah, and he gave me another prophecy. He said 'once the sky is colored brightly, a man of grey shall usher forth the return of monsters and a world's doom. Once the balance shifts, a proposition shall cause a rise of a new god and a fall of friends. When the day comes that the sky is thick with water, a broken man shall bring the end of wealth and an era of sorrow. When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony. The answer you seek is more obvious than you think. Look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole. Life and death, two sides of the same coin, one cannot survive without the other. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all'."
When they got back from the hospital Harry knew the only place he was going was to bed. It was nearly ten and he felt tired to his core. He took his potion and was asleep before his head had hit his pillow. When he opened his eyes again, everything was dark. He looked around and as his eyes adjusted, he noticed how small the space he was in appeared to be. There were three toy soldiers neatly lined up on a tiny shelf and he was sat on his bed. A feeling of loneliness welled up in him so profoundly that he though he was going to cry, but tears did not come. He heard a voice in the back of his head telling him that he was a silly boy, and that real men didn’t cry. He closed his eyes again, shutting them tight to block out the overwhelming darkness. When he opened them again, he was stood alone on a train platform. He felt lost and he realised that he had no-one to ask where to go. Everyone was avoiding him and getting on with their life. He tried to speak but no sound came out of his mouth. He screwed his eyes shut and opened them again. This time he was stood next to an archway, watching a tall, rugged man slip softly through the curtains. Harry tried to grab him, but his arms went through the man like smoke. He screamed, trying to let the world know how unfair it was. His eyes slid shut once more. He opened them defiantly, wanting to see the man one last time, but instead he just saw bodies. All around him laid the bodies of his friends and family. Remus, Tonks, Fred, his mum and dad, Dobby and Sirius were all staring glassy eyed up at him. He fell to his knees and beat the ground, shouting until his throat felt raw. Gentle but firm arms wrapped around him and pulled his face into their chest.
“Yeah, of course I do. I just didn’t expect to see you here.”
He slept fitfully that night and didn’t feel much better when he woke up the next morning. It was around eleven and he wanted to be there for two. He thought that he would floo to Grimmauld and then get the train to the coffee shop, which would take about twenty minutes. He decided to leave around one. He downed another pepper up potion and managed some toast. He was almost tempted to go back to bed for another hour, but he knew that would be a bad idea. Instead he jumped in the shower to see if the cold water would knock him out of his funk. It brightened him up a little, but he still had a headache and his muscles ached. He looked at himself in the mirror again and rubbed his face. His hair, as usual, was untameable, so he dried it carefully and then left it. Back in his room he began worrying about what to wear to such a meeting. He’d never done anything like it before. In the end he decided on a pale green polo shirt and soft grey chinos. When it was time for him to leave, he grabbed a light jacket and then floo’d to Grimmauld.
Arthur came back from taking Fleur and Bill to the hospital and let Molly know that they would let them know when anything was happening, and then they could floo to see them. Ron and Hermione arrived not long after Arthur and Ron made them a chicken Salad for lunch, and a spiced tofu salad for Ginny. Harry took his potion and then ate most of his lunch. He was glad that his appetite was coming back, it was making him feel much better to have some energy. Ron seemed to be glowing with happiness and he pulled Harry to one side after they’d eaten.
“Dear Mr Potter,
“Well yeah, I have eyes. But it’s Malfoy.” Ginny laughed, shaking her head at Harry.
“No worries at all, Mr Potter. I understand that you have had a rather stressful few days.” Though Malfoy gave Harry a friendly smile, he could’ve sworn that there was something more in his eyes. It was probably relief, but Harry had an odd feeling that it looked more like disappointment.
“Oh, don’t tell me you’re on of them gender neutrals, or whatever they’re calling themselves these days.” He tutted. “You’re a girl. Act like one.” Ginny’s face flushed and they turned, leaving the room. He looked around the room, as if searching for support. No one gave it to him, not even Audrey.
Ron and Hermione appeared not long after, and then they all sat down to eat on the tables outside. As always, the conversation flowed easily. Harry sat back and watched his friends and family talking and laughing. He drank in the joy and happiness that surrounded him, knowing that he would miss it when he moved out, but finding himself excited for what the future held in store for him. He knew that he would appreciate his easy comfort more when he wasn’t constantly surrounded by it, and he promised himself that he would try and visit The Burrow as often as possible after he moved. He also knew that he would have to tell Mrs Weasley as soon as possible. Hopefully she would be distracted by the happiness of the new baby and that would soften the blow of him leaving, but he knew she would still be upset. After all, he was like a son to her. Affection for the woman spread throughout him, but he was soon distracted as Ron placed a huge slab of chocolate fudge cake down in front of him and Arthur topped up his cider. He smothered his cake in cream and was enveloped back into the conversation, a smile on his face and in his heart.
“Sounds like a good base idea, Mr Potter. I’ll have a look at it in more depth and make some notes on what might need to change, or how certain things might be achieved. I’ll write it all up and we can have another meeting. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of days. That should be-“ He checked his diary “- the seventeenth of July. I have one thirty free, if that’s good for you?” Harry nodded. “Would you like to meet here again?” Harry nodded again. “Then that should be all, unless you would like another drink?” Harry was slightly taken aback by the offer.
"Your husband and son."
"Help him. I don't fully know what you two have been through, but I know you have been through a lot. He's a child. He never had a real childhood, he just wants someone to care about him."
"I don't think they've planned a date yet. I think there was some talk about a summer wedding, not entirely sure yet. None of us know how to plan a wedding. Tony and Pepper just went to a courthouse. Draco and I got married at a lake then made it official in a courthouse, so it's been a struggle."
"Then why are you so pissed? I thought you didn't care what your father thought?"
"Yes, Camelot. Excalibur, dragons, Morgana, a Round Table, magic, everything."
"Great! Now, can you tell me, what is your full name?"
"I thought you said you could stop the bleeding."� Arthur worriedly said, though the anger was slowly seeping through.
He hadn't even realized he started crying until after he let go and Teddy has reached up to wipe his tears.
Merlin had been a sickly child who was bullied because he was different. He had one friend, his name was Will, who Hermione would later learn had died while protecting Merlin and his magic.
"Okay. If you're sure," Draco smiled, pulling the paper down and kissing Harry quickly. "Are we still clear on the plan once the Ministry is weak enough?"
Tony and Clint were already in the Jet when the giant gaggle of people walked in. Tony sighed, "FRIDAY, remind me to make a bigger Jet."
"It's fine. I'll get used to it. Maybe if I rake through my brain enough, I'll find something. For now, I'm fine just dealing with it."
I am so terrible at keeping a consistent updating schedule, which I apologize for. This chapter was a bit hard to write because I've not been in the right mood to write some fluff at the moment. But either way, have fluff!
"Yes, so can we get Merlin to Harry Potter so he can help him?"
Merlin's eyes widened. "What?"
When Draco was finally getting closer to his due date, he was basically on house arrest. No one let him leave his room in his house, not even Scott who was one of the most immature Avengers (but he was mature when necessary). All Draco could do was read some books that Wanda brought him when she last came to the house. Harry was basically always at his bedside except when he went to bring food, water or whatever Draco wanted. The pregnancy was honestly getting really annoying and he just wanted to be able to get back to his daily normal life. He and Harry had agreed on a name for their son but still hadn't told anyone what it was so it could be a surprise for whenever he was finally born and introduced into the world.
"Oh. That's bad." Sirius mumbled.
"Right."
"Uh, sure. I'll just, uh, go get something to eat." Tony said, finishing the part of the arm he was working on and got up. He left the lab and went down to the communal floor.
"It's been a year, Potter. It's not Professor." Snape sighed but still handed the potion over.
That made Harry put lower his sword. "King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table?"
Over the 44 years they were in hiding, they both changed a lot. They were both stronger physically, mentally and magically. Harry still had more of a muscular build but Draco was just as strong. Harry's hair was still short, crazy and untamable while Draco grew his out and mostly had it up in a ponytail or bun. At first, Draco was gonna cut his hair but Harry loved his long hair so he didn't cut it. Both had more scars than they cared to admit. They still moved location every week or so and never stayed in the same place twice.
"Key?" The goblin said, not even looking up from his piece of parchment.
"Well, you know that work trip I went on? I figured out how to bring your Papa back. But to do that, I might have to go away. It would only be a short time, but I wanted to tell you."
George had the journal ready to go. He did everything Harry told him to do besides put the date in.
The Avengers (Teddy, Draco and Sirius included) were just lounging in one of the many floors in Avengers Tower after a party when it all went downhill.
"What can Draco do if not even that spell works?"� Tony asked.
"It did. For them it is 2020. I have Merlin's memories up until today, 2053."
"Thor, you know where Titan is?" Natasha asked him to try to take her mind off of what just happened.
"Husband, godson and godfather. But yeah, I'm just here for support I suppose."
Lancelot turned to Steve. "What was that about?"
"Actually, there isn't. There was a second Lord Black but he died in battle with my uncle." Harry smiled innocently as he took a sip of the water he had in his goblet.
Snape rolled his eyes but handed over the antidote which Bucky took and shook off the effects of the potion.
Draco had expected it to be Harry or Teddy, seeing as they were his only two friends. But he never would've guess that the applause would be started by George Weasley.
"I'm ready. Lead the way." Harry said, the same smile on his face as he had for all the post-war interviews.
Harry, Teddy and Draco looked at each other. "Um, 42-43 years." Teddy said. "Since 1970."
"The Wizarding World."
The Cloack of Levitation wrapped itself around the Infinity Gauntlet to keep it from closing as Stephen told it to. Then Peter kept going through portals and landing hits on Thanos before Thanos snapped out of it and grabbed him, threw him to the ground while his hand was around his neck.
"It will most likely require going back."
"I am the Minister of Magic, I can make you do whatever I want!" She yelled, more Aurors slowly coming into view.
"Unlikely. We may be rich, but I doubt anyone in America is richer than you." Harry shrugged.
The Aurors were starting to wake up. Draco and Harry kissed one last time, Harry, Draco and Teddy hugged one last time. They all said their goodbyes and were ready for whatever came next.
"Last I checked, running the Quibbler."
Harry nodded and unzipped the SHIELD Agent uniform that he was still wearing. He had the tattoo on his collarbone.
"Well maybe you should've!" Draco yelled back, then turned to look at Harry, "Harry, say goodbye to Teddy," he whispered.
"I'm the Master of Death." He said, holding up his wrist so Snape could see the bracelet and the tattoo.
"The Whomping Willow incident?" Harry asked.
is fine. He's off with Severus, Sirius and Teddy in our home in New York." Harry said, smiling at the thought of his family.
When the UN signing finally happened, there was an explosion which killed the king of Wakanda, T'Chaka. His son T'Challa was there too and was going to go after the killed which turned out to be Bucky Barnes. Or, so they thought.
"I know all that. But no one ever tells me about what he was like as a kid. Or what he did in his free time."
Snape's eyes widened again and nearly passed out on spot.
"You choose."
Teddy from a far, saw this and used all his magic to put up a shield in front of Pietro, Clint and the little boy. Sure, Teddy could put up shields easily, but from when he was a mile or two away, it just wasn't as easy. His metamorphous glamour slowly died away. His real brown hair and brown eyes were flashing occasionally. He apparated to the sight and held up his shield for as long as he could. Teddy, unlike Draco, Harry and Sirius, wasn't as trained with wars as they were. He was only a month old when the Second Wizarding War ended and there hadn't been one since. He focused on his studies and his school more than learning more defenses than necessary.
There was a whole deal about a girl named Gamora? Then the group thought they were working for Thanos. The whole deal was sorted out when Peter said that they were the Avengers.
"Of course, sir."
"Who cares about that? Why do they keep showing up? First it was them three, then it was Sirius and now this Severus guy?" Clint questioned.
"Wow. I thought my adventure was crazy." Sirius laughed.
He put the book down and went on to look at other things.
His wand was out in front of him even though he knew he could do just as good without it. He walked towards the edge of their wards. He threw up more wards while being as discreet as he could.
"Tell them about the Cailleach and Mordred?"
"Don't worry. I won't. Now, cheer up. You said you're here for your husband and son, so go try not to sulk over there. Understood?"
Snape sighed. "And the child? What was his name? Teddy? Edward? The wolf's offspring."
"Okay..." Draco said softly. He turned back to Weasley, "What's the reason that the Headmaster has to come to the office?"
"So you have your patronus and your wedding date tattooed?" Rogers asked, slowly speaking out the word patronus.
Severus rolled his eyes but opened the box. To say he was shocked was an understatement. He had absolutely no words.
"No one calls me a child. Especially not you." Harry shot a small curse at Thanos. Even though it was small, Thanos stumbled.
As Charlie read, the others started to tear up. They might've hated Malfoy, but if Harry loved him, he must've changed.
Snape took the seat Tony was just using. He took off his jacket and whispered, "
"Let me get this straight. You survived a snake bite because you had an antidote in your pocket, then went on a run for a week then your magical police found you and threw you into the Veil because of your crimes as a Death Eater?" Steve asked.
"Oh, good. I thought you were gonna slap my head again." Harry sighed in relief.
"When do we get to figure out what the name is?" Tony asked.
"Prophecy? What prophecy?" Draco asked.
"That sounds made up." Arthur scoffed.
"That's a lot of people."
Loki nodded and watched as Harry went down on his knees and used his finger to carve some Runes in the floor. From what he could see, Harry had carved ᛖᚨᚱᛏᚺ-ᛋᛁᛪ ᛏᚹᛟ ᚠᛟᚢᚱ which meant Earth-624, the world he was going to. He also had drawn the Algiz around the Veil which meant protection. He was just writing different Runes like the Uruz, the Thurisaz, Ansuz and some other ones. Once he was done, Harry stood back up, said goodbye to Loki, gave him a hug then stepped through.
It went quiet for a second. "You should take him to speak to the Great Dragon." Gaius suggested.
"Is there a Lady Black?" Guinevere asked.
Sirius frowned, "Yeah. He was at Godric's the night your parents were murdered. I found him outside after. He was just smiling up at the destruction. He looked at me for a second before winking and apparating away. Definitely a Death Eater, maybe one of You-Know-Who's more loyal. He was in Azkaban for a bit. Had a cell a few doors down before he was taken to the MoM and never came back. Do you think he was pushed into the Veil? They did that, you know."
"You can't. You would need to get the Infinity Stones first."
"Never have I ever had bars on my window." Draco said, looking straight into Harry's eyes.
Until… "George!"
"Clint, who's that you've got there?" Romanoff asked, clearly (or at least clear to Harry) going defensive since it was obvious she didn't know this man personally, of course. She had stalked him a while ago. Harry figured it out when the wards notified him that the same two people were coming to the house for about a week. He had used his Invisibility Cloak to see who it was.
"You look different without it. Did Tony buy you new clothes?" Harry looked around, "Did Tony buy you all new clothes. He did that with Sirius and Severus. Speaking of which, have you two confessed your love for each other? Also—"
"Okay. I may not be the best person for this since I only met him some years ago. But... He was sweet. He loved to bake, so he would always be making cookies for us in the compound. Draco told me that as a kid he loved the fairy tales they had back in his world. He was trusting and believed the best in everyone. He loved to read in his free time. Or he would go around tricking everyone using his magic. He had the most amazing smile and his eyes, no matter what color they were, they would always light up when he saw someone he loved. And his hair was always changing to represent his mood or just for fun. The kids at his school all called him Teddy because of how young and how adventurous he was, no matter how many times the other faculty told them to call him Principal Lupin. He would make the most boring things fun like just reading out loud for a meeting or whatever it was, he would always change his appearance to however he envisioned the person looking. He put others before himself. He was powerful but gentle. He made sure everyone was happy and healthy before worrying about himself. And when he died—" Pietro took a breath before continuing, "When he disappeared, he made sure that I was going to be okay. He told me that he would come back. He told me to make sure you were going to be alright, and I'm sorry I haven't been able to do that. He promised me we would get married when he came back. So I bought him a ring."
The Chitauri and Thanos’ children and the Avengers fought. While the fighting was happening, there were reunions happening all around. Harry saw Tony and Peter hug, Steve and Bucky kiss, Teddy and Pietro kiss, Sirius and Severus hug (though Harry could see they both wanted a bit more than a hug), Sam and Rhodey hug, Wanda and Pietro hug and more. Harry looked around. The one person he wanted to see more than anyone, he couldn't find. Until he felt someone tap his shoulder.
And Harry Potter was the Master of Death.
About a month later, the Potters were gathered in the living room
Of course, he didn't know what the one in the compound looked like, so that was going to be a surprise for whenever Tony decided to show them.
"He's here, isn't he? You would never go without him."
"Welcome to your new life, Uncle Sev."
"Yes. I was almost a Slytherin, though. But because of Ron telling me that all Slytherins were bad, I didn't wanna go. The reason I was almost a Slytherin had to do with the Horcrux inside me. It was part of Tom Riddle, and he was a Slytherin, so the Sorting Hat wanted me to be the same house as him. But I kinda begged it not to. After all these years, I regret that decision. I could've been friends with Draco faster, I wouldn't've had to deal with Ronald and Hermione, but whatever."
"What did you do to my son?!" He yelled, standing up and all but crashed into the bars.
Harry gasped. "Dementors. Or the Dorocha. They suck the souls out of people, leaving only a shell of skin of a person left. They feed off of a person's happiness, bring fear and depression. Whenever they're around, everything gets cold. In the old days, the only known ways to scare them off is with fire or light, but now we know they can be destroyed with a Patronus."
"I have no clue what you're talking about. I was born on July 31st, 1980. Now if you'll excuse me, I have more work to do," Potter said, standing up before Fury stopped him again.
"Why?"
"Damn." Gwaine mumbled, looking at the circlet.
"What's a patronus again?" Someone asked. At this point, Sirius couldn't tell who was who.
"I want to figure it out." Harry told Severus once he got back.
Harry laughed. It really sounded like he was going crazy. Maybe the prison had an effect that would make people go crazy, seeing as how there aren't any Dementors.
He told them about the idiotic teacher that was Gilderoy Lockhart. He told them about Ginny Weasley and Lucius Malfoy putting the diary in her cauldron. He talked about his ability to speak Parseltounge and how everyone turned their back on him once they found out. He talked about the Chamber of Secrets, Tom Riddle and saving Ginny.
"It's okay Teddy, it was long in the past. I can't say I don't miss her, but she's waiting for us somewhere. We'll meet her sooner or later." He smiled weakly.
Snape was the only one following, the other three had already been in there so many times, they didn't need the full tour again.
Tony's eyes widened as he watched him disappear. He turned to the other Avengers as if to ask if they saw the same thing he did.
"This way, Lord Black." Elyan said, leading him to the horses.
"Wakanda." Steve said.
"He's my godfather." Harry backed up as Sirius turned back into his normal form.
"'m fine. What happened?" Draco mumbled.
When Harry opened his eyes, he realized that the curtains were open and that there was a clean set of clothes on the side of his bed.
Draco smiled and pulled him into a hug, "It's only been a couple hours and I missed you so damn much."
Harry's smile turned into a confused frown. He stood up and grabbed his wand, pointing it at Snape.
"Wow." Someone said, making Harry whip around and relax only when he saw Merlin. "I've never seen someone destroy a wall like that."
There had been no new advances with the Death Eater case which made Draco on edge. Harry, Teddy and Sirius were calmer about it but Draco was a different story. He believed that every time he walked into their house (no matter how many wards were in place) there would be one of those Death Eaters there waiting for him.
"Harry." Now they were both sobbing.
"Grow up Sam. You've been living with us for how many years now?" Harry flashed him a middle finger.
First thing Harry saw when he landed was Loki. He did it right! Loki was waiting for him. Or... maybe Loki was just checking the portal to make sure Harry didn't show up and get stuck on an alien planet.
"I believe that." Draco laughed.
Severus stood up as well, "I'll come too."
Just like Harry said, there were ten thousand galleons, a stack of papers with information on the shareholding of Wheezes and the spare bit of parchment. The spell was what interested him the most, so he grabbed the parchment, along with some galleons and the stack of papers.
Eventually, they got bored of truth or dare and moved on to never have I ever.
"Death Eaters. I saw one. Argo Pyrites. Recognize the name?"
"In that time, Hermione suggested we become friends with Draco since he was trying in best to fix what his father ruined. He actually had to go through the junior program to become a Healer. A year before I became Head, he finally made it to the main program. Me and Draco became friends since a month after the year. It started off as awkward meetings then progressed to me going to his house sobbing one day because it had just hit me what my life had been like up to that point. Then barely two years after the war, we went to each other for help or comfort. I helped him slowly rebuild the Malfoy reputation.
"Harry James Potter, you're being sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban for the murder of Tom Marvolo Riddle, attempted murder of Andrew Dennis Creevey and for assisting in the murder of Cedric Eldritch Diggory." An Auror that had hated Harry since the moment he became an Auror spoke. "Hand over your wand or wands immediately."
"Harry! Oh thank Merlin! Draco's over there. I can hold the man off while you bring him back."
"The Veil," Teddy tried, "We can go through the Veil. They can't follow us through there without dying."
"On it!"
"I need a list. I need a list of all energy surges that have somewhat the same energy recording as ours. The power level will be different, of course, but the recording and the surge should be the same."
"It's a bit gunky. Skulls, guts, what you'd except in a secret snake hideout." Harry explained before jumping down the slide.
"Dad?" Scorpius asked groggily when he saw the silhouette of his father in his chair.
"Yeah. I mean, courage, strength and magic."
"How is he?"
"I don't understand why I can't do this. I'm brilliant with the Dark Arts but can't make a simple potion?"
"I think there might be a bigger threat coming. He thinks there are more wizards out there that are out for revenge."
"Let's go find them. Please?" As much as Merlin normally took care of things on his own, this time he felt he needed Harry to come with him. Last time he saw Mordred, he had stabbed him, almost bringing him to his death if it hadn't been for the Knights, Draco and Harry coming few years prior.
Neville stayed quiet but kept following Harry through the chamber.
"Yes, the one that stabbed me." Merlin sighed, "Draco believes in the good in people. Mordred was a misguided teenager, much like he was. He didn't want someone else to get hurt by their own actions because they didn't know all of their choices."
"I don't know how I knew that. All my spells are in Latin." Harry said, looking at water burning out the last of the fire.
Draco just nodded and watched as Harry left the room.
Loki then somehow teleported next to him and looked at the wound. He was using his magic to heal it when Sirius disappeared into dust.
Arthur caught his glare, "Your adopted brother, I assume?" Loki nodded, "My half sister tried to kill me. Multiple times."
One of Thanos' children went to attack Harry and he just held them back. Soon, Thanos pulled the power stone from the gauntlet and used it against Harry's spells. It held Harry back for two seconds which was enough time to put the stone back and snap.
"Harry?" Steve spoke quietly.
"Mr. Stark? I don't feel so good..."
Harry immediately stood up facing Arthur, hand on the hilt of his sword, as if daring him to do anything. "If you hurt him, I will hurt you."
Harry, out of pure instinct (before even seeing the result of Merlin's spell), mumbled out a spell, "
Pietro started to cry, "I love you, too, Teddy. So don't you dare leave me now. I swear to god, you cannot die on me now. C'mon. Promise me, you won't die on me. Edward Remus Lupin, if you die now, I will kill you."
"I wish no harm." The man coughed out.
, I was finally happy with how it turned out.
Harry pulled out the shrunken trunk from a chain and unshrank it. He stepped in and took a second before coming out with another trunk. He unshank that one and opened it. "Everything's in there. Minus some books that we've put in here. Hope you don't mind. But you were kinda dead, so..."
"Okay, well, I'm kinda not supposed to tell you this but Tony's building your kid a whole wing in the new Compound. Well, for the Potters. It's pretty big, just like the rest of the compound."
Harry sent the cauldron and ingredients down to the basement before kissing Draco. He got up after pulling away.
"Leandro."
The sixth month of Draco's pregnancy was mostly filled with Harry (and occasionally Tony) worrying all over him. Apparently something called Braxton-Hicks contractions were starting which was a way of the body preparing for labor. These contractions caused Draco to be in pain sometimes which is what worried Harry, which worried Draco. Tony insisted they were normal but Draco wished Bruce were there to actually help him. There were no other doctors that knew about the Potters, and what they could do, besides Bruce. Draco just hoped that wherever Bruce was, that he was fine.
"Fine, fine. Let's go. I'm assuming Hermione knows you're here?"
"Wait!" Merlin yelled, "The Dorocha are the beings of the spirit world, they are only released when the Veil between worlds is opened. They are commanded by the Cailleach, she is the only one able to close the Veil. But to do that, there needs to be a sacrifice."
"And Teddy?" Draco asked once he was down in the basement.
Draco snorted, "He's not. I mean, have you seen the way he dresses on a day to day basis? He looks homeless."
Harry had always wondered why Draco stayed the same without his hair or skin products. He had asked Draco about it but he never answered.
Peter jumped over to grab her.
"Clint, I suggest going faster before he dies in my Jet!"� Tony yelled.
"What are you? Are you like Loki?"
"Well... It's very complicated. To dumb it down, my name is actually Harry Potter and I'm a wizard."
"Killed him?"
When they finally got to the compound, Draco ran to the nursery and picked up his baby. "Oh, my darling. You just had to say you're first word when I was away, didn't you?"
"Where'd he study?"
Harry kneeled down to talk to Scorpius, telling him that he had to stay with Aunt Pepper for a bit while the grown ups talked.
"No thanks."
"They can trace us."
"So he's going to be okay?" Draco asked.
"Just keep in mind that we don't ask just anyone."
Arthur and Gwaine, who were with Draco, got to their feet and followed Draco while he led them to the medical wing.
"Ours?" Thanos questioned before a piece of wreckage being pushed by Tony fell on top of him.
Draco smiled, "Well, that's Harry for you. I'm assuming he also spoke about Scorpius and Sirius?"
"No discussions. Barton take Potter into training. I'm sure he needs it. Bring him to my office once you're done. There's more paperwork." Fury commented, quickly scanning up and down Harry before walking away.
The trio made their way to a empty room. Draco held to the two men and apparated in front of their house. Tony activated his suit.
"So at Hogwarts there were four houses, each made by one of the founders. Each house values different things. Gryffindor, created by Godric Gryffindor, values bravery and courage. Slytherins, created by Salazar Slytherin, tend to be ambitious and cunning. Hufflepuff, by Helga Hufflepuff, values loyalty and patience. Ravenclaws, created by Rowena Ravenclaw, are witty, intelligent and creative. Gryffindor's colors are red and gold and our animal is a lion. Slytherin is green and silver and their animal is a snake. Hufflepuffs are yellow and black and their animal is a badger. And Ravenclaw is blue and bronze and their animal is an eagle. I, along with all the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville and the Marauders were Gryffindors. Draco was a Slytherin like every other Malfoy and Black, excluding Sirius and Tonks. Teddy and his mother were Hufflepuffs. Luna, Cho Chang, who I briefly dated in fifth year, were Ravenclaws."
"The King would like your presence for breakfast."
A couple hours later, Harry woke back up. This time, instead of in the medical wing, he woke up in his and Draco's room.
"Because that means I lost the bet." Arthur shrugged.
Draco's eyes softened again and he went over to hug his godfather.
"Yeah?"
"Hey, Ted," Harry said.
"Seriously? Do you not know who I am?"
Harry had run off multiple Aurors. He was trying to contact Draco but his earpiece was turned off.
"Okay. What the hell just happened?" Clint asked.
Draco cast a wordless spell to see what they were talking about to not interrupt them.
"Harry Potter is in a coma." Severus said, his mask falling into place.
Harry grabbed onto Loki and they teleported back to Earth.
Arthur groaned, "The one time we need magic, we can't use it since our resident warlock is unconscious."
Draco nodded.
"We're back, children!" Harry announced. Snape showed up a couple seconds later.
"Teddy!" Harry yelled. Harry ran downstairs since he had apparated to an empty room in the house. The Avengers followed.
Teddy nodded reluctantly before hugging Harry tightly, "I love you, Harry."
Once the group picked up the pizzas and Draco changed Snape's robes to something more modern, they made their way back to the Tower.
As she was looked through old books to try and figure something out, she remembered something from an old History of Magic essay about the Old Religion.
"Severus?"
Hi darlings. There might be another chapter up this week since I am really behind on my updating schedule and I feel terrible about that. I'm probably gonna be updating every other week now on Saturday or Sunday.
"What'd you do after?"
"THANOS." Harry yelled.
world, another is learning about a new world.
"She was surprised of course, but took it well. She's not going to tell the others though. Sirius told Tony about Argo and he's in on our investigation now."
"What is it you want to say, Merlin?" Arthur said, rubbing his temples out of stress, tiredness or anxiety, Merlin didn't know.
Sirius snorted before he burst out laughing, Severus joining in after.
"I love you, Scorpius."
"Draco. Snap out of it."
Harry seemed so confused. "There's no reason to kneel. It's just me. You guys know me."
"In our world, we use the Veil to kill people. Like you guys here have death row, that was our death row. You get sent to Azkaban, then you get either Kissed by a dementor which sucks the life out of you or you get thrown into the Veil of Death. No one was expected to survive the Veil, but they've obviously never been thrown into it." Draco explained. "But to answer you, Tony, I honestly don't know what they're talking about."
When Harry arrived, Natasha noticed how different he looked.
"What's were your last words and why?"
Both Snape and Sirius started stuttering and turning red.
"He should be fine." Draco nodded, "You could wait here. Arthur and Merlin are talking so it might be a while."
It looked that Thanos was getting scared. That brought a smile to Harry's face. Everyone would remember the wrath of Harry Potter.
"How'd you do that?" Romanoff asked, walking back up to them.
Mr Creevey fell to the ground, bleeding from the scars that Harry had made.
"Papa!" Scorp said, grabbing onto Draco's finger.
3. Clint is sulking with his tattoo sleeve, no Ronin Clint in this fic.
"I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict." Strange panted out while looking at Peter.
Draco turned back and looked at Harry, smiling softly, "I can't lose you either. So, as long as you're with me, I'm fine. As long as you have that bracelet, I'm always with you."
"Right, yes. Of course." Harry smiled politely before turning back around to get on the elevator Draco was on.
"He was one of Voldemort's most trusted. He knew him from school. Everyone assuming he died at the First Wizarding War."
He heard footsteps leading up to the room.
"It says '
"You are a prisoner. You have no right telling me what to do, Potter," She said before turning to one of the guards, "Take him to Azkaban,"
"Then get on with it. You and Clint first." Romanoff said, stepping aside, leaving Barton and him on the mats.
And just like that, Harry walked out into the common room. He leaning on Draco for support, but mostly he was able to walk by himself.
"Why are you here?"
He had been even more surprised with the fact that when he was about to sit down, Harry had pulled him into a hug. Everyone was silenced by the hug. Draco didn't know what to do except accept the hug.
"I have one! Never have I ever hated a family member." Thor said.
"Now, can you explain to me what the mutt is doing here?"
"Then let's go. Who's coming?"
"Git," Harry mumbled.
"Thanos is going after the infinity stones. I'm sure this man told you my warning from all those years ago." He said, nodding towards Sirius who was still at his side. "He already has the Space stone and the Power stone. He needs Time, Soul, Reality and Mind. Which that..." he pointed at Vision, "Man has in his head. The Mind stone. In case you can't tell, Thanos attacked my brother and I's ship. We had evacuated Asgard after my sister, Hela, goddess of death, was determined to take it over. It was Thor's idea to unleash Surtur on Asgard, therefore killing my sister and our planet. Everyone was on a ship and Thanos killed almost everyone. Heimdall used the last of his power as Gatekeeper to send Bruce over here. I offered my help to Thanos to get the stones but he knew I was just trying to kill him, so he choked me to death, or he would've if it hadn't been an illusion. Either way, he somehow still affected my actual self but I teleported here. I have no clue where Thor or Valkyrie or anyone else is."
Merlin's spell had been one that started a fire towards who ever it had been intended for. Harry's was a spell that puts out the fire. The counter spell.
I love you guys so much and thank you so much for reading, commenting and leaving Kudos!
"I fell through the Veil. I originally landed on a different world, Earth-37, I think. They had a Wizarding World, though a more advanced one, so I was able to get to their Ministry and go through their Veil. That world had been in a war between the Muggles and Wizards. Then I landed on another one, Earth-441. Although they didn't have a Wizarding World, they had a Veil. The Muggles had been testing it and trying to figure out what it was with little to no luck. Then I landed on a planet in this galaxy. I believe it was called Titan...? I found a young man, long black hair, green eyes, pale skin. I told him I had to go to Earth and he teleported me here. It was sort of like Apparation. He told me before he left, 'He's coming. The Mad Titan Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones. Tell the Avengers'. I didn't know who they were or how the heck I'd find them. I've been on this Earth for a year or so now. Then in a pub I hear some man complaining that their superior was bring up an old case from the 70s about an unknown sudden energy burst. I knew someone from another world was here so I started looking. And that lead me to here."
While the Avengers were getting to know the twins, Draco was pulled aside by Tony.

Harry sighed, "My first tattoo was the Draco constellation, placed right above my heart and I got it because I love you."
"Draco is a very forgiving man. I cannot say much, but he forgives even those who tried to kill him. He forgave an old friend of mine who thought it was his responsibility to kill another."
"Harry!" Draco yelled but when Harry didn't show up in the two seconds that Draco gave him, he yelled louder, "HARRY JAMES POTTER. GET YOUR ARSE OVER HERE BEFORE I HAVE YOUR BABY WITHOUT YOU!"
"Great. Now, before you explain how you got here and everything, we need to pick up food and go back to the tower before Harry sends out a search party." Tony said, opening his phone to an app called FRIDAY and asked FRIDAY to order some pizza from the teams favorite pizza parlor, adding a large tip to get it done faster.
"Of my life or of when we got here?"
"Yes...? Okay, listen, he kind of did die afterwards, but that's besides the point. It was right before the Snap, I don't know if you read about that, but it wiped out half our universe, Teddy, Draco and Sirius included."
"Actually, you have two options Mr Barnes. You could take some truth potion or I can look through your mind."
Merlin rolled his eyes before Lancelot spoke up, "Merlin can ride with me."
“People only really found out today Hermione. I went for a meeting and collapsed. But it’s fine, Fleur says it’s just the flu. I should be over it in a few days. Hopefully before she has the baby.” Harry told Hermione about what had happened that day and all about his plans for opening the salon. She told him that she thought it was a fantastic idea and offered her help for when he needed to decorate or help in coordinating things. She was back at work soon, but her and Ron were always happy to help. He thanked her and they chatted more about what had been happening since the wedding.
The preparations for the wedding begin to happen and more family members appear at The Burrow. Harry takes some time to revisit the past and Ginny opens up to him.
“Let’s go find something to eat.” He suggested. He was probably just hungry.
“It’s about eight thirty. Are you alright?”
Yours sincerely,
After dinner Harry made himself another tea and went and sat outside. He was happy. He was at peace. But he knew that he would have to do something soon. He was growing bored of his nice existence. He knew he would have to get a job at some point and decide where he wanted to live. He had the choice of two inherited houses, or he could easily afford a flat, or even get Ron to draw up some plans for Dean and Seamus to build him a house. It was something to consider in the future. He knew that he couldn’t live off his inheritance and Molly’s kindness his whole life. He sighed and leaned back, cradling his tea between his hands. Ginny’s voice came from behind a nearby tree.
Yours sincerely,
‘Ginny,
He wandered around the house looking for an owl to send the letter and found Pig asleep in the fruit bowl.
“You have the Flu, a bad flu, but you’re okay.” She reassured him.
“Yeah, I’m not feeling great. I haven’t slept particularly well.” Ginny laid the back of their hand against Harry’s forehead.
He was woken by someone shaking him gently.
“Yeah.” They sighed. “Or maybe I’m destined to always have something that I’m confused or panicking about for the rest of my entire life.” They flopped backwards into a laying position on the bed.
“Now Jen, you’re just jealous I won’t let you steal them, aren’t you, my love?” She swatted him and Hermione shook her head, telling them to behave. Molly remarked that at least Christopher didn’t have a collection of multicoloured wellies; something that Arthur had discovered a couple of years before. It was not tradition for people to try and find the most outrageous ones they could for him. The last pair that Harry had bought were pink with yellow rubber ducks in bobble hats printed on them. Arthur had nearly cried with joy when he’d opened them.
“Hey Gin, how are you?” He gave them a quick side hug; he felt like he hadn’t seen them all day amidst the chaos.
“I’m sure you’ll figure it out Gin, you always do.” Harry assured her. They spoke for a while longer before Ginny left to go back to their own room and Harry settled down to sleep. That night his dreams were filled with his parents, their friends and a hair salon.
“That’s not true. I only took an interest because the git was always up to something.” Ginny laughed again.
“I’ve never been so excited about anything in my whole life, even the Quidditch world cup. I mean, have you met that woman? She’s amazing. And, of course I’m nervous, but not about if I’m making the right choice or not. I just want everything to go right.” Harry set down his plate and cup and embraced his friend.
Harry finished reading the letter and Ginny sat almost nervously next to him as he did. He smiled.
Harry didn’t go to bed until the sun was nearly up the day after. The celebrations had gone on long into the night and he could feel himself falling to sleep where he stood. Ron and Hermione had gone to spend their first night as a married couple at their own bungalow, the place they would be living from then on. He pulled his clothes off as soon as he entered his room and dropped them into a pile on the floor. His bed felt like the comfiest thing in the world and he was asleep before his head had even hit his pillow, sprawled out and snoring. His couldn’t remember what he dreamed about that night, but grey eyes and soft blond hair lingered at the edges of his mind.
“Yeah, just thinking I guess.” Harry smiled reassuringly at Ron and began to eat the omelette that had just been placed down in front of him. It was delicious.
It was only a four minute walk to the coffee shop and he walked up to the counter to ask for Mr Zabini’s partner, as Blaise had told him to in one of his letters. The barista pointed to one of the corners of the shop where a man was sat hunched over some papers. Stands of blond hair were falling into his eyes and he pushed them back.
“Hey, who’s Pansy bringing tomorrow?” He asked, trying to sound as innocent as he could.
I’m so looking forward to seeing you at the wedding. I can’t wait to see your new hair! I bet Harry did a fabulous job on it. I must remember to ask him to trim mine when I see him. I think it’s a fantastic idea for him so set up his own salon. You’re always full of good ideas; always have been.
Draco Malfoy was near the back of the congregation with Pansy. He was wearing black dress robes with silver detailing that contrasted starkly with his pale skin. His hair was slicked back and plaited, secured with what looked like a black ribbon. Harry wondered what the other man’s hair would look like when it wasn’t tied back. Draco was still pointy, but it suited him. It made him look aristocratic and refined. Harry had to admit to himself that he carried the look well, and he was undoubtably attractive. Harry bet he was still a prat though. It was as though Malfoy could sense Harry’s gaze on him and he fixed his own grey eyes, almost like molten silver, directly on Harry. Malfoy smirked and Harry turned his attention back to the ceremony. He could still feel Malfoy’s eyes burning into him and it made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“Who wants to help me pod some peas?” He asked, distributing the buckets between people as they all agreed. He pulled Lucy onto his knee when he’d done giving the buckets out and carefully showed her how to pod the delicious peas. Dean watched carefully too, smiling proudly to himself as the small green spheres popped out and fell into his bucket.
When Ginny came back in from training, he asked who else Malfoy had worked with. Apparently he’d worked with Luna when she’d taken over the Quibbler to help her reform the business and make it work more smoothly. They’d since become friendly and went out for a drink occasionally. This eased Harry’s worried slightly, as Luna was a very good judge of character and, if she liked him and got on with him, he supposed he could too. Ginny said that they knew he’d worked with some other people and their businesses were all pretty successful so far and that eased his mind further.
“Right. Well, I guess I do look a bit out of place, don’t I? I’ve just come from the office, you see. I suppose I don’t really fit in with the décor around here.” Harry expected to see a smirk on her face when she was talking about The Burrow, but it wasn’t there. Instead she had an almost wistful look in her eyes. “It looks wonderful. I can’t wait to see what it looks like tomorrow at the actual wedding when everything’s finished.” Harry felt shock run through him again. He hadn’t expected Pansy to be invited to the wedding, but he didn’t really know why. He supposed that he’d never really thought of Pansy and Hermione as friends, but simply as work colleagues. Though, when he thought back he realised that Hermione talked about Pansy a lot, and she’d often spent time with her after work; either finishing things off that they’d not gotten done during working hours, or simply going out for a glass of wine with her.
The preparations for the wedding are in full swing.
“You going to drink that, Potter, or just cradle it until it goes cold like you usually do?” She smirked and sat next to him. “Harry?” He looked up into her face. She looked apprehensive and took a deep breath. “I need you to do me a favour.”
He found Ginny in their room, wiping tears angrily out of their eyes and furiously scribbling a letter. They quickly folded it over when they realised that Harry was in the room. Harry walked over to the chair Ginny was sat on and opened his arms. They leaned into him.
“Maybe you should have a nice bath.” Luna suggested “I know it normally helps Gin when they’ve been training.”
“I don’t think you have anything to worry about, Gin. I can almost feel her feelings for you coming off this piece of paper. Ginny smiled.
All hustle and bustle stopped and the pair of them walked into the kitchen. All eyes turned on Ginny.
The ceremony was simple and gorgeous. Harry couldn’t hold back the tears as his best friends said their vows to one another. He could tell that they meant every word from the bottom of their hearts and when they’d been pronounced husband and wife Ron held Hermione’s face so tenderly, as though she was the most precious thing in his whole world.  Next came the part that most people had been looking forward to since the wedding had been announced: the food. The menu consisted of a starter of a garden salad; spring greens, red onion, tiger tomatoes, cucumber and rainbow carrots (all grown in Arthur’s garden) with a balsamic vinaigrette. The main course was grilled beef or nut roast with wild garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus, baby corn and sugar snap peas and a rich gravy. By the time the main was over, Harry didn’t think he could ever put another forkful of food in his mouth and Ginny rested their head on him, echoing his sentiment. Just then, Ron stood up.
“Of course, that sounds fantastic! How much are you wanting for rent?” Harry looked confused for a moment. He hadn’t really thought about it.
“Only if you never make me picture any of my brothers having sex ever again. Or my parents, before you say anything” They added, pre-empting Harry’s next words. He shut his mouth again, fearing for his poor arms. They stayed in silence for a little while and Harry looked around the rooms. He noticed a stack of letters; each one dyed a different pastel colour and carefully folded. They were being weighted down with a pretty conch shell.
He was more prepared to see Malfoy when he walked into the coffee shop. This time he was wearing a darker grey suit with a deep red shirt. His hair was tied back again; a red velvet ribbon secured it at the top of his neck. Malfoy tucked a couple of stray strands behind his ear and stood up, holding out a hand to Harry. He smiled easily, but there was no trace of his customary smirk anywhere to be seen. Harry shook his hand before taking the seat that Malfoy gestured to.
I was told by Dean and Seamus about your ‘Silent partner’ business. I have the beginnings of an idea for a business, but I will be the first to admit that I have no idea what I’m doing with the business side of things. If we could set up a meeting to discuss whether you think my idea is viable, I would be very grateful.
Fleur looked exhausted and Harry had never seen Bill look so proud in his entire life. The baby slept peacefully in his arms. She already had a mass white-blonde hair and her eyes were green in some lights and blue in others. They’d named her Victorie. It was no secret that Bill and Fleur had struggled to have a child; they’d been trying since their wedding, so the name was fitting. She was their little victory. The way that they both looked at her told Harry that she would get anything and everything she ever wanted. Fleur asked Harry if he’d been taking his medication and it struck him that, even though she’d just gone through one of the most physically difficult things she would ever go through, she was still concerned about him. He knew that certain members of the Weasley family had considered her selfish and stuck up when they’d first met her, but she wasn’t. Harry saw her as one of the most selfless and caring people he knew. They stayed for a while longer, each holding the baby. He saw the look in both Ron and Hermione’s eyes that was equal parts excited and terrified that they would have one in a matter of months. He felt completely surrounded by love and once again there was a feeling of apprehension about moving away from this comfort to live on his own.
The next hour or so was spent comfortably sipping tea and chatting about this, that and the other. Weasleys from all over were flitting in and out of the house. Bill had come back from the hospital for a freshen up while Fleur’s parents and sister were visiting her. Charlie had decided to stay for a few more days to be an extra pair of hands if needed. George and Angelina had called in and decided to stay for tea. Luna arrived around five and her, Ginny and Harry went to sit outside in the garden. It was a cooler day than it had been in a while, though it was still hot, and the sun was still high in the sky, it was comfortable and pleasant. After a while of lounging and chatting, Ginny gave Harry a meaningful look. He cleared his throat and brought up the topic of Grimmauld to Luna.
“Well, I’ve had a fantastic little helper.” He grinned, ruffling Lucy’s hair. She giggled, swatting his hand away.
“Yeah, I’m just tired. It feels like I’ve done a marathon.” Harry’s muscles felt tangled into knots and he had a headache that was niggling at the back of his skull.
As the sun began to go down, the flowers that were entwined around the gazebo opened, revealing twinkling lights within them.
“We had no idea how to set up or run a business and, truth be told, we’re still learning. We actually have a lot of help from Blaise. He’s what you call an ‘invisible’ partner. That means that he helps us run the business and does all the business-y side of things, but it’s still ours and it’s only our names that are associated with it. That’s what he does for a living: helps people like us that have something that we want to, and can, make a living out of and helps realise that dream. He has a few people who work with him now doing the same thing, but we were one of his first projects.” Harry listened to what Seamus was saying, realising that if he had help like they did, that perhaps he could make this idea that he had a reality.
“Fine. Ron and Hermione on the other hand…” Harry trailed off as Ginny began hitting him. “Ouch! Don’t bruise me, I’m fragile!”
“Did you want to talk to me about anything Gin?” Harry asked, sliding back to sit against his headboard.
Draco Malfoy”
He awoke the next day to the sounds of people rushing about the house. Ginny ran into his bedroom and flung the door open.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked.
Get well soon, Mr Potter.
T/W PTSD
Charlie had arrived late into the previous night. Harry had heard him being greeted by his mother and father. He could see in his mind Arthur taking the luggage out of Charlie’s hands and Molly replacing it with a cup of tea. Harry fell to sleep with their indistinguishable chatter floating in and out of his ears. The morning after he was able to take in Charlie’s appearance. The last time he’d seen him was about four months previously and he was just a little bit more tanned, his muscles were a little bigger and his silky hair was that little bit longer. Harry’s fingers twitched at the thought of tidying it up a little bit and feeling the weight and shine of it in his fingers. Envy also flitted in the pit of his stomach. He loved cutting and styling others’ hair, but his was still an uncontrollable mop. Charlie was also clearly covering up yet another new tattoo. Harry thought that Ginny looked the most like Charlie out of all the brothers; both of them had a somewhat androgynous beauty and natural glow about them.
“I look forward to seeing you then.” Harry said after he’d recovered. “Do you want some help with those documents. You look like you’ve got your hands full.”
“There’s only one way to find out, right? And what’s a more romantic setting than a wedding?” Ginny groaned, pushing him.
“You should do it, you know Harry.” Neville commented, biting into an egg and cress sandwich. He chewed and swallowed before adding “It would be good for you too. You could rent a place in London to work out of and live at Grimmauld. I’d be happy to work on the garden with you, and I’m sure these guys- “He gestured towards Dean and Seamus. “-Would be happy to help you fix it up, and you’d have loads of volunteers to help clean and decorate.” Dean and Seamus nodded in agreement and Harry couldn’t believe how much sense it all made. It was like the idea had always been inside him, but he needed Neville to say it for him to realise.
This chapter isn't massively long, but it has got my creative juices flowing so hopefully there will be more to come.
“Sure Gin, I’ll ask her when she comes over today. I’ll have a the floo connected to here at some point too, so it’ll be easier for you guys to see each other.” Ginny smiled and gratefully took the mug of tea that Harry handed them as he sat down.
“I can’t wait for the food at the wedding. I mean, the food here is always lush but I’m sure Ron and his mum have outdone themselves with the menu.” Dean looked off into the distance with a faraway look on his face, as though he was imagining the food.  Arthur rummaged around in one of the cupboards for a while, letting out a triumphant “aha!” when he found what he was looking for. He held up a stack of large buckets so everyone could see them.
“We have a few speeches before desert, as I’m sure you all need time to let your food settle before you eat anything else.” There was a murmur of agreement. “So, without further ado, Mr Granger.” Hermione’s dad stood up, clearing his throat.
“I want you to cut my hair short. You’ve cut everyone’s hair in this house and it always looks awesome. Even Hermione’s, and you know she’s very particular about her hair, especially after the hairdresser that ‘specialised in black people’s hair’ messed it up so bad. I never thought she’d let anyone touch it ever again.”
“Who were you writing to?” He asked, deciding to breach the subject.
“Good, thought we’ve barely seen anything of one another with all the drama of you being ill, Ron and Hermione moving and the new baby. I’ve also been training a lot, and Luna has the quibbler to run. It’s been pretty mental to be honest.” Harry nodded his head then stood up, heading over to the kettle.
Harry almost dropped the tray he was holding when he ran into, almost literally, someone he didn’t expect to see there. Pansy Parkinson was carrying arms full of what looked to be documents towards the house. Her hair was cut into the bob that she’d always had it styled in while they were at Hogwarts and she was wearing a simple but expensive looking while blouse and black pencil skirt. She was wearing an almost burgundy lipstick that contrasted wonderfully with her pale skin and her lips were drawn into an easy, amused smile.
“So, how did the meeting with Malfoy go?”
After they’d eaten, they spent time taking the official photographs. When they’d been done Ron and Hermione had their first dance. Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes again as he watched them sway softly to the slow melody that was being played. He spent the afternoon dancing and talking and actively avoiding Malfoy. He didn’t get to talk to Ron or Hermione much. They were the centre of everyone’s attention and he wondered how exhausted they must be already. Everyone looked like they were having an amazing time, chatting to people they hadn’t seen in months or even years. As the sun went down the flowers that Neville had prepared bloomed, revealing the twinkling lights. A buffet of food that rivalled Hogwarts’ feasts appeared on long tables and everyone ate hungrily again, almost forgetting how much food they’d eaten before. Harry grinned as he saw Ginny and Luna sat off to one side, their hands entwined. He caught Ginny’s eye and winked, making them blush and turn back to Luna. He made a mental note to talk to Ginny about it the next day and ask how it had happened. His heart was full of love and joy. He turned around to grab some more food.
“The great Ginny Weasley, nervous. I never thought I’d see the day.”
“You’ll see tomorrow, but when you do, please behave yourself. She asked me and Ron first and we agreed that it was alright. Please bear that in mind.” Hermione’s words made Harry even more curious, but he dropped the subject. He gave Hermione a gigantic hug and told her that he loved her and that he would see her in the morning before making his way to the bathroom to shower. The water felt good on his skin; cool and refreshing. He melted into his bed as soon as he got in it. Molly had changed his sheets and it was one feeling he would never get tired of. He thought about living on his own and knew that he’d miss all of the creature comforts that he got to experience living with the Weasleys. He knew that he would find it hard at first not having them around; he’d never lived on his own before. He drifted off to sleep thinking about Gimmauld and how he could decorate it to make it look more like it belonged to him, and what he would ask Neville to do with the garden, and what his Salon might look like, if he got round to putting his plan into action. Blaise’s address laid folded up on his desk.
Not long after she’d gone, Ginny came back in from the garden. Harry, Percy, Audrey, Dean, Charlie, George and Fleur were all sat drinking tea and chatting. Seamus, Neville and Bill were out working on one of the Gazebos and the flowers that would be used as lighting. Ron and Hermione had gone to pick Hermione’s parents up from the train station.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
“Thanks for the muscle potion in the bath, my shoulders were killing me” She smiled at him before hungrily tearing off a chunk of bread and dunking it into the bright green soup. Harry smiled back and followed suit. The conversation flowed easily between the family. Ron and Hermione updated Molly about the finalisations of the wedding that was going to be held in three days’ time. Fleur and Bill were expected the next day and other guests would be arriving in the days after. Charlie was arriving late that evening due to an appointment he had that day. Arthur was thrilled that his garden had had a good watering and George was telling him about the breakthrough he’d had with a few of his products that day.
“Harry did it. He’s going to open a salon.” Ginny smirked and stepped out of the limelight as everyone turned their attention towards Harry.
“Pizza?” Ron’s question caused a flurry of excitement amongst the friends and they all gave him their orders for him to make on his outdoor pizza oven. The pizza was crisp, the cheese was gooey, and Harry was thankful that he was Ron’s best friend; the guy knew how to cook. After they were all so stuffed with pizza that they didn’t think they could move, Seamus conjured a fire pit and Ron went to look for marshmallows. They sat late into the night drinking and talking and being at peace with the world. They were all excited about the wedding and all of the things that were planned for after it, but after a while they all began struggling to keep their eyes open and decided that it was time to retire to the house, ready for the insane amount of work that they would be doing in the following couple of days.
“Are you excited Hermione?” Fleur asked, resting her glass on her bump and shifting to try and get comfortable again.
“Wow.” Fleur breathed out.
Percy and his wife Audrey arrived that day with their two-year-old daughter Lucy. Percy was head of the Transport Department at the Ministry and hadn’t managed to get much time off work for the wedding, so he was going to travel in from The Burrow the day after. Audrey had wanted to be there to help with the Wedding preparations for at least the full day before the wedding. She’d also thought it would be nice for Lucy to spend some time with Nannie Molly; an idea that Molly fully agreed with. As soon as Lucy saw Molly, she ran at full pelt towards her and Molly scooped her up in her arms. She was soon abandoned, though, when Arthur came in from the garden.
"No. I'm not leaving you to die. You left you for 45 years. I can't lose you again," Teddy frowned, walking over to him but stopping because of his shield.
Harry looked up and looked around frantically, "Where's Severus? And my son?"
Steve nodded, but the people from Camelot looked confused.
"Why? He still needs someone to give him magic." Harry said looking up from his son at Severus who was concentrating on his work.
"Department of Mysteries."
Draco cried a bit and held onto Harry tightly. "You don't hate me?"
"You're the son of a man I hate. But also the son of a woman I love."
Somehow, Tony convinced the Potters to come to a small Halloween party with just the Avengers and some close friends. There was alcohol, thank Merlin.
- Steven Rodriguez
"Wow, okay. Well, moving on. Who are they?" He pointed at the Avengers.
By the time Draco and Harry stood back up, nearly every wizard had their wand pointed at Harry.
"This is Harry Potter. You are in charge of him until further notice."
Harry turned to him and smiled widely, "So the Prophet wasn't lying when they said you took on Draco's hair and my eyes," He pulled Teddy into a tight hug before someone sent a stunner their way, though easily deflected by Harry.
A couple hours later, once everyone was fed, clothed in modern clothes and off doing their own thing, FRIDAY announced that Merlin was waking up.
"For us, it's been 100 years. For Sirius, he died three years ago." Harry explained.
"Remind me again, why are we harvesting basilisk parts?" Charlie asked, even though they never actually told him why.
The memories were projected onto the wall of the guest room. He showed the one of him getting shoved into his cupboard the day he spoke to that snake at the zoo when he was 11. The one where he had bars placed on his window when he was 12. The one where he had just been pushed down the stairs by Dudley and his friends when he was eight. One where he had to hold his arm close to his chest because Vernon had broken it out of rage and refused to take him to the hospital when he was six. One where he had to fight off Dementors then got beat up by Vernon when he was 15. The last one was the first time he was beat up at age three when he forgot to clean one spot of the kitchen floor and went without food for a week.
"Yeah, why?"
"Severus?"� Natasha asked as she was looking over Merlin.
Severus left Harry to his thoughts about the bracelet and began writing.
"He knows who we are. He called Draco 'Death Eater scum'. He's from our world." Harry explained.
Draco took Scorp into his arms and smiled at his son. "Thanks, Sev."
It was currently the sixth of November of 2016 and still no baby. He was due on November first but his son was being really stubborn (just like Harry, Draco thought) and didn't want to come out yet.
"We raided the Chamber and the Room of Requirement before we went on our run. And Gringotts."
"Draco Malfoy saved the life of the great Merlin? I don't believe it." Hermione crossed her arms over her chest.
Enjoy this really late chapter!
For a second, Harry thought he saw Snape's lips twitch upwards then he thought he was going crazy. "I will be back." Snape said before he stepped inside the trunk. From the inside, Snape saw some mountains of gold, silver and bronze. There were stacks of books with papers on the top, one for unread, one for read by Draco and one for personal. The smallest was the unread pile then the personal then the read by Draco.
"What'd you discover?"
"Who were you working for up until Steven Grant Rogers found you again?"
"Sirius" nodded and cast a couple spells to get rid of his glamours. Black hair replaced the blonde-brown. His skin became lighter, eyes darker, and grew a couple inches. He had more aristocratic features than he did with the glamours.
"If I don't get to Draco and Harry on time, tell them that it's okay. I'll finally get to meet my parents. And I can see Harry's parents. And Fred, Dobby, Dumbledore, my Gran, Aunt Cissy. I lived a good life. There's only one thing I regret and wish I could've done differently. I was an idiot for not telling you I loved you earlier."
"This is Lord Hadrian Black. He's here for his studies. Hadrian, this is the Physician, Gaius."
Sirius groaned, rubbing a hand across his face. "That means there are more of them?"
"Okay, yeah. But I want them to get along. Of course I'd want my godfather and my husband to get along." Harry said.
"Okay. I'll send a Patronus to get Severus over here."
Thor's eyes widened. "That is the symbol of Hela, the goddess of death. There were tales on Asgard of a man who could bend the laws of death at his will. He was called the Lord of the Deceased. The tale said that the man who held this power shall not be defeated by another. Only he shall lead himself to his own demise. The tale was always as such, just a tale. The symbol is known for the same reason. The line meaning power, the circle for lost love and the triangle for death."
Once they entered the house, Snape started looking around. He nodded in satisfaction before looking at Harry as if asking him 'where to next?'.
"I married my school rival. I know what its like hiding your feelings from someone because of different social classes, families, houses. Because of stereotypes. In legend, Arthur marries Guinevere, a serving girl. Who says he can't marry Merlin, the manservant?
Harry laughed, "Only you would think wrecking havoc is the nicer version of it."
According to George, it was the third of November of 2053. So that's what Harry carved in with runes in front of the Veil, along with the rest of the runes he put last time.
The heroes were punching all of the creatures in sight. Draco and Harry were fighting back to back, sending curses and hexes at any of the creatures. Sirius was doing the same while backing Natasha up. Steve was hitting all of them with his shield. Sam and Rhodey were flying over the site using their hand thrusters to take out a couple at a time. Loki used his illusions to be in more than one place at a time and cause more damage that way. Wanda was using her powers to bring the creatures crashing down in a similar way to how the wizards were.
"Yes, she was always good at healing gunshot wounds." Harry couldn't tell if that was sarcasm or not but he doubted this was a good time to ask.
. In old magic, or the magic of the Old Religion, it's
"Probably."
So, Merlin started explaining, "Your Veil of Death is what is to believed to be the High Priestesses greatest achievement. It not only would work as a method of death, it would work as a portal to other worlds. This was created long before my or the Lady Morgana's time. With the right runes, you could not only control the time and place it would land you, you could also control if the magical signature was shown. The High Priestesses would take their prisoners to the Veil and made them land somewhere where they would die, whether it be flames, in the front line of fire or whatever they could come up with."
Then the footage faded out. Scorpius wiped his tears before he stood up and walked to Pietro's room.
"When do you find out the gender?"
"Is there a reason for you pulling me away from my family?" Draco scowled.
Severus pulled his shirt up and looked at the wound. It looked like a normal stab wound, so why was it causing him to bleed so much?
"Hello, Gaius."
"I don't! A lot of crap happens on Halloween for me and Harry."
Once they were back just chilling in the compound, Harry pulled Draco into the bathroom.
Harry said goodbye then went through the Veil.
"I had just turned 16. My father made me get it. Since I didn't want it, it hurt so much. Even worse than the torture curse. When you consent it doesn't hurt as much, but you can still imagine the pain of getting a tattoo filled with dark magic."
"That's what he wanted. Thanos the Mad Titan." Bruce whispered.
"No." He said.
"How many did we win?" Tony asked.
"Severus said you have knowledge of everything that's happened in our world since the beginning. I don't know if he meant the Magical World or the normal world." Merlin explained.
"Yeah. I'm actually not even from here. Like this planet. I'm from a different universe, still Earth, but Earth-616, not this one. Well, technically I
"I know how to do this, Jay. Just get over here," Draco whispered as he made his way to the two men. Tiswer Syiltal and Keodor Hewion. Both worked in the Magical Law Enforcement section of the Ministry.
"Well, am I really that wrong?"
"Oh, my beautiful boy, Scorpius." Harry whispered as he held Scorpius.
15- Harry figuring out how to bring everyone back
"I was on my way to Camelot for some business I had to attend to but my horse seems to have run off when I stopped for a bit."
Teddy and Draco looked around. Sirius and Severus were looking directly at each other. When Harry looked up, he now saw two dragons, a wolf and two dogs.
"We're here." Clint called.
Severus quickly left the room (either eager to go catch up with his boyfriend or for the happy family to have some time alone), leaving only Harry, Draco and Scorpius.
Two weeks, a couple cups of coffee and a couple episodes of Criminal Minds later, this chapter is finally done.
Snape noticed something on Harry's left hand which left him confused. "When did you have time to get married between the War and the aftermath?"
"You're doing that thing where you push your glasses up your nose, except you don't have glasses anymore. You do it when you're nervous. James used to do it too. So, I repeat, what did you do?"
The game went on for a while. Draco stood up half way through and made his way to the bar. Harry watched him go with sad eyes, not noticing that Natasha was watching him.
"Who are you?" Draco asked.
"What?"
When Snape left the room, he found Draco in the living room playing a card game with Teddy. "Draco. It's good seeing you again. But I have to be going now."
"Thank you, Leon." Harry smiled. Leon smiled back. "You should really be thanking Merlin. He's the one who woke me up. By the way, Merlin, where's the neckerchief?"
"Sure."
The inventor followed the wizard and watched him pull out some books, placing them on a chair.
Severus nodded, "I can come with you if you'd like."
"Do you not feel it? The deaths?"
"Carina Lily Potter."
Bucky gasped, "They totally
"Right..."
"Yes?" Hermione Granger-Weasley said, pointing at one she knew to be Amerah Worogip, a writer for the Daily Prophet.
"Who'd you meet?"
It was going pretty smoothly. The slowest part was extracting the venom, which was expected. There were charms that made it somewhat faster, but you couldn't use too many or it would just drain the persons magic.
Romanoff seemed to be happy with her decision while Barton looked a bit remorseful.
Teddy crossed his arms in a playful manner then looked at Tony who had somehow been quiet this whole time.
"You wanted to talk to me, Professor?"
Snape looked at Harry with confusion written all over his face, something that was a rarity to see. He flipped through the pages and saw Harry's (slightly better now) chicken scratch in margins. There were arrows and small diagrams drawn. On the page with the Sectumsempra curse, the "For enemies" had a note next to it, "not for petty school bathroom fights". He chuckled slightly at that.
"You're 35. Your life barely just started." Romanoff said, putting her finger on the trigger.
"To be fair, that is one of the harder potions in that book, and you were always crappy with potions at school," Draco picked the paper up again, skimming through some of the news before stopping, "You said the Ministry controls the Prophet, right?"
Sirius hit Severus in the arm, "
"George!" Harry said running out to hug him. "You have no clue how good it is to see you."
His eyes glowed gold. No one in the history of the Wizarding World had that amount power since Merlin himself. Not Voldemort, not Dumbledore, not Grindelwald. Only those who had the power of all the witches and wizards before them had that kind of power.
"We need to go to someplace where we can get the stone out of Vision so it doesn't kill him to keep it safe."
That one stopped Harry for a second. "One."
" Peter said before he dusted.
"Why don't we just go inside to show you your room and our spell making slash potion making room?" Harry suggested.
"There was energy surge in the middle of London twenty minutes ago. I sent agents to check it out, but they say nothing was found besides some blood."
Draco smiled and kissed him softly.
"We're the Knights of Camelot, how do you not know who we are?" A fourth voice said.
"Fake your death, they said. You won't get caught, they said." The man mumbled. Draco vaguely recognized the voice but couldn't be sure until he saw the man.
"It was for a tournament. Me and three other wizards had to each face a dragon to get a clue for our next task."
"You? Help me how?"
For him to bring everyone back, the first thing he needed to make some runes on the floor. After that, he needed to combine that Hallows to make who knows what.
"Who are you?" the King asked again.
"Okay, Sirius, Severus, suit up. We're meeting at the QuinJet."� Teddy said, taking a sad glance at Harry before running back towards the Jet.
"Hunter?"
"Well, yes. But only because I couldn't."
"Merlin? You're King Arthur!" Teddy said.
"I'll pass." She said. "I prefer not kissing men who probably haven't kissed someone since the forties."
Harry pounded against the glass wall, pulling on his magic to get him out of the cell. "I need to get to Draco. Someone just broke into my house and killed my husband. Let me out!" He yelled.
Draco just laughed, "You get used to it. I was the same when we got here."
"About your suspicious person? Yes. He's been residing in a house close to the Potters for about 10 years. I asked JARVIS to keep an eye on the house see if anything suspicious happens or happened in the past. He said that once or twice a month a bunch of people go over, stay for a couple hours then they leave sporadically. JARVIS said that occasionally one less person leaves than enters."
Avengers: Endgame.
"Why did you want to see her eyes?"
Tony booed at him and threw popcorn at him.
"I'm right here, Harry. And if you could stop kissing in front of me, that would be lovely," Teddy spoke up.
Harry was slightly confused but he nodded. He moved the bracelet slightly down his arm and showed the tattoo that was on his wrist.
Merlin laughed, "I'm not actually Merlin, darling. This is a portrait that was made and spelled to have Merlin's memories. It just so happens that I know what is happening right now, and what will happen in the future."
Harry held his arms up in surrender, "One at a time please. I landed in Camelot. I met Merlin, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Yes, in a way I got what I needed."
The party was a success. The cake was amazing, seeing as Steve and Harry worked together to make it, and all the fun games ended up actually being fun, unlike most baby shower games.
"Hi Scorpius." Pietro said. He let Scorpius in before he went back to punching the punching bag he had in his room.
That caught almost everyones attention, especially Arthur and Gwaines.
Merlin was talking to Arthur and Gwaine when he heard it.
"Who are you?" Harry asked.
"Teddy."� Severus called.
"It's okay, Pietro." Teddy finally opened his eyes and stared into his blue eyes. "You'll be okay. I'll see you again eventually. Don't worry. Tell them I love them. Give a kiss to Scorpius for me, okay?"
"If he is, I owe Elyan some coins, so please don't be that." Gwaine whispered back.
He knew from wherever his parents were, they were proud of him. And he was proud of who he was, who he had come to be.
"What will you tell him? Why are you leaving?"
"Among other things, yeah."
George didn't know what to expect when he walked into Gringotts. He wanted to see what Harry had left him in the vault. A million galleons. That was a lot. Harry had always been a close friend of him and Fred's. It broke Harry's heart when he found out Fred died.
Pietro nodded and ran out of the room. He came back in five seconds. "Here."
Severus nodded and passed Scorp to Pietro. He looked at the baby for a couple seconds before placing a kiss on top of his head, "He said to give Scorpius a kiss from him. He accepted his death. He died with a smile on his face."
? Hmm? Call the security on us? On your best friend?"
"I think it's time you stopped underestimating me, Thanos." Harry said before he cast a single spell, "
Draco smiled. "Scorpius Leandro Potter. It's perfect."
Draco knocked on the door of his sons room.
Harry went on to explain the story of the Three Brothers.
"Wait. You said you've been on this Earth for a year, yet the Avengers didn't exist then. How could Loki know about us if we weren't a team yet?" Tony asked.
"Draco."� Severus said, causing Sirius to look up.
Charlie, being the only one able to act, grabbed the journal from the trunk, said the magic words and flipped to the end of the journal, to the last written entry and read out loud.
"You know, if I didn't love you so much I would've Crucio'd you at this point!"
"Pietro said he was going to propose when Teddy came back."
"We open the barrier." He said then spoke into his comm.
"Harper Torty… What kind of name is that?" Draco laughed (or tried to) a bit. It hurt how spot on that actually was. He probably would've gone crazy. Maybe kill himself a couple times just to feel something. He honestly had no clue how he and Harry had survived all those years on the run.
Then Tony, wrapped his arms around both Draco and Harry and smiled. "Your child is going to be spoiled rotten, both with toys and love."
Scorpius smiled happily before going back to eat his ice cream.
"No cursing in front of the child,
"What do you know?" Arthur said, narrowing his eyes.
Harry blinked a couple times, "Sorry. I have all this knowledge about our world and I can't keep to all to myself." He turned to Merlin, "You were a sick child. You never met your father until a couple hours until his death. Gwaine, you hid your nobility because you didn't believe in nobles, yet here you are. Leon, you were always a loyal Knight, always believed that Uther was right regarding magic, but your childhood best friend had magic. Elyan, you always thought it was your duty to protect Guinevere, even though she was always a tough little girl. Percival, your mother was a physician, she taught you a lot of things. You probably had a better chance of becoming of physician than Merlin. Lancelot, you had aspirations as a child to become a Knight of Camelot, and you were given the chance even though you weren't a nobleman. You gave up the chance at first because you believed you hadn't proved yourself. Arthur... you always believed that your father was right all the time. Even when everyone was against him, you stood by him. That is what makes you an excellent King. You stand by the people you believe in.
Harry and Steve found they had a lot in common. Both were war heroes who saved a bunch of people, but also lost people close to them. They both stood for mostly the same rights, equality, safety of everyone, health. Steve rather enjoyed the company of Harry after finding out about Bucky not being dead. They were both men out of time in a way.
"I'm gonna bring everyone back. But first I need to go somewhere."
Tony smirked and took a long sip of it. When he was finished, he grimaced at the taste.
This chapter was mainly a filler that I don't really like.
"But you can't tell him I told you! He'd probably throw me out." Steve laughed nervously.
Draco”
“I can’t wait to see your dress, I bet you’re going to look stunning.” Charlie grinned at her. Harry agreed. He wondered what kind of style she’d gone with. For her job at the ministry she usually just wore smart trousers and a blouse and comfy shoes that allowed her to be on her feet as much as she needed to, and around the house she either wore cropped capris and a tank top and cardigan or maxi dresses. She usually either had her hair braided to keep it away from her face or left it natural and wore a thick fabric headband. Comfort and practicality were Hermione’s style, but she always looked effortlessly wonderful.  She smiled back at them and tapped the side of her nose. Ron looked at her adoringly.
Harry”
“Brew?” Ginny smiled and gestured to the chipped yellow mug sat in front of them. They closed their book and leaned back in the chair, stretching as they did so.
Back at The Burrow a great Eagle Owl flew in through the open window and dropped a letter on the kitchen table. It was addressed to ‘Mr Potter’ in elegant handwriting.
“I did not. I’m ill Gin.
“Oi! Don’t break the best man.” Charlie quipped as he walked over to them.
“Right,” She said, “I’m on a laundry mission. Pop your hand up if you have anything to wash and I’ll go and collect it.” Most of them raised their hands. She sighed, smile still firmly in place.
“Cup of tea in the kitchen?” Ginny always knew what he needed. He nodded, grabbed his glasses and they made their way downstairs. When they got into the kitchen Harry noticed the letter that was addressed to him on the table. He opened it carefully, scanning the beautiful writing.
“I should, um, get back to the Burrow. I’d like to go and see Bill and Fleur and the baby.” He felt like he was making excuses. “Sorry.” He added quickly.
“None taken.” He laughed, drawing Ginny into a hug. “It might take some time to work your feelings out. You’ve not seen her for a while have you?” He asked. “Maybe when you see her at the wedding and speak to her in person it might help you to make sense of a few things in your head”
Percy can suck a branch if he thinks he’s going to upset you while I’m there. I’ll hex his balls off and make him wear them as earrings. Please don’t let jerks like that stop you from living authentically. You deserve to be happy and I will do anything and everything in my power to help you.
“Hermione, why was Malfoy at your wedding?” He asked.
“Potter.” He came face to face with the grey eyes he’d been trying to avoid all evening and his heart began to pound in his chest.
Thank you for your concern, I’m still not 100% but I am getting better. I think Fleur is a miracle worker with her Potions. It’s probably best if we meet at the coffee shop again as Fleur has just given birth so it’s somewhat hectic at The Burrow.
“Hermione will be joining us in about half an hour. She’s just spending some quiet time with her mum and dad.” Harry nodded, nervousness taking hold of him. He was so scared that he would mess Hermione’s hair up on one of the most important days of her life. “So, whose hair are you doing today?”
Hermione joined them not long after and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen her so excited. The usually perfectly calm and put together woman was a ball of eager energy and Harry was delighted to see her glowing like she was. She was wearing a simple sun dress in a Lilac that complemented her rich skin perfectly. Her dress was hung up in Ginny’s room where she’d stayed the night before. Molly had insisted that it was bad luck for the bride and groom to stay together the night before the wedding, so Ron and Hermione had humoured her. Harry hugged Hermione and they set about discussing her hair. They’d already decided that they would relax it slightly, so it dropped in smoother ringlets, but that was just a case of adding some products and potions to it. She was adamant that she didn’t want it straight like she’d had it at the Yule Ball, and Harry had agreed. He loved Hermione’s hair and didn’t want to take away the natural beauty of it. She’d already washed her hair and used a leave in conditioner, so her hair was still damp. Harry set about splitting her hair into half inch sections and applying a product that would help the hair to hang in tight ringlets, occasionally spraying the hair to keep it wet. This process took quite a while and it was nearing ten when they’d finished. It would take another hour or so for it to dry and fix under the slow drying spell before they could move on to the next step. Cho arrived not long after they’d finished, and she set her gear up in the space that Harry had set aside for her.
Blaise Zabini”

“Hey Harry, how you feeling today? Fleur’s having her baby!” The words all came out in a big rush and he sat up quickly. It didn’t make his head spin as much as it had the previous day, and he supposed that was a good sign. “Dad’s talking her and Bill to the hospital now.”
People split off and went to their respective rooms or hung out in the kitchen or living room when the sun had finally gone in completely. Harry went up to his room to read for a while. He enjoyed reading so much more than when he was in school. He was in the middle of a book called ‘The Magic Cottage’ by James Herbert at that point and he looked forward to reading it each night before bed. He found it to be a brilliant way to relax his mind and therefore fall to sleep easier. He also usually didn’t have nightmares if he read before bed. It was something that the mind healer that he’d seen after the war had suggested. That wasn’t to say that he didn’t still have nightmares; he often woke up in a cold sweat, shaking. Sometimes he could calm himself down, but usually he got out of bed and sat in his desk chair, looking out of his window and the moon and stars. A lot of the time he thought about Sirius. He sometimes wrote letters to him, trying to put his thoughts, feelings, confusions and worries down into words. It made him feel like someone was looking over him. Of course, he missed his mum and dad, but he’d never really known them. Sirius and Remus had been tangible. He’d known them and loved them and learned from them.
“Hey Harry.” Ginny plopped down next to him, offering him a drink which he accepted.
“Mr Potter, you’re looking much better than the last time I saw you.” Harry nodded. He didn’t know what to say. “Would you like a coffee? Or perhaps a tea?”
The last five years had been hard. The war had ended, and they’d all grieved in their own ways. Molly had tried to keep everyone as close to her as possible. She had cried for days when Fleur and Bill had moved back to the cottage; believing that they were abandoning her. After a while she began to understand that they needed their space to heal and to try and be a married couple again. Ron and Hermione decided to stay at the Burrow under the condition that when they were married, they would move out. They’d been planning and building a small bungalow not far from The Burrow. Hermione and Ron had done the planning (Ron had drawn it all out) and they’d had help with the building from Dean and Seamus who had formed a construction business, gotten married to one another and adopted an ex racing Greyhound called Noodle. Neville had designed and planted a garden and small orchard.
“Thanks mate.” He gratefully accepted the coffee before picking up a sausage and devouring it.
Dean and Seamus had put up temporary huts in the garden. Each one contained a bed, a sofa, a coffee table, coffee and tea making facilities, a mini fridge and a separate room with a toilet, sink and shower. As more and more guests arrived, they were assigned a hut each. When they’d settled themselves into the huts, they all threw themselves into helping or socialising. A lot of them were friends from Hogwarts and it was amazing to be able to catch up with them and see how they’d been doing and what they’d been getting up to since their school days. Harry admitted that he’d been a bit rubbish at keeping in contact with people and vowed to make he saw them more often after the wedding. The huge gardens at The Burrow had almost turned into a temporary village and it was busier than Harry had ever seen it. Molly looked frantically busy, but she also looked delighted. The place was running like a well-oiled machine; albeit a very noisy one, under Molly’s direction. Arthur, Ginny, Charlie and Harry took it upon themselves to keep everyone supplied with refreshments as the day went on.
“But it’s Malfoy, Gin. What the hell is he doing with a job anyway?” Ginny frowned.
Harry took the same route to the coffee shop as he’d done the previous time. This time his head was less foggy and he enjoyed the journey. As he walked through Grimmauld, he resolved to make plans to clean the house. He knew it wouldn’t be quick or easy, but he would just take it a room at a time. He thought he’d probably end up doing the kitchen, living room and one of the bedrooms first. It would give him space to sleep, eat and relax at least. He was sure he would be able to count on some of his friends to help him too.
“I guess you’re right Audrey. I guess I should apologise to Ginny.”
Harry sent a letter back, replying that he would like to have the meeting with Blaise’s partner. He then dragged himself upstairs and ran himself a bath, adding in some of the muscle potion that Ginny used. It helped a little, and the steam seemed to relieve his headache somewhat too. He laid back and let the warm water was over him. His eyes drifted closed again and his mind was filled with the events from the past few days. It was so nice to see family and friends and he knew that he could count on them to support him and help him with what he wanted to do. He wondered what the meeting the next day would be like. He knew that it might stop his dream before it even started, and nerves churned his stomach. When he got out of the bath, he took a pepper up potion and stared at his reflection in the mirror. Ginny was right; he really did look terrible. A knock on the door made him jump and he exited the bathroom. Ginny was there.
