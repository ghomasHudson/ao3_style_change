“No,” Draco pouted, returning to his mission of apparently getting-the-fuck-out-of-dodge before Harry had a chance to unwrap the layers of defense Draco’d built in the three seconds after waking up.
She stifled her relieved sigh too late, but looked unrepentant. “Yes! It is exactly that time. I’ll help. Draco, Harry, watch Scorpius and Rose, will you?” As if Draco needed to be told to watch his own son (which, admittedly, was the whole point of this week with Scorpius, but Draco could ignore reality when it suited him).
Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, confusion on their faces. “What about your father in the parlor?”
suddenly become a werewolf? Don’t shit on my enhanced senses. If I say I can smell happiness, then I can smell happiness.” She turned her probably-not-that-much-better-than-Draco’s-at-smelling nose up into the air.
“I should go shower and change,” He said, standing. Scorpius kept his gaze fixed on the plate, though he hadn’t taken any more bites.
To which, Draco had leveled a devastating stare. “Who do you think manufactured his week-long stay?”
“I never thought I’d see the day when Draco Malfoy drank boxed wine out of plastic,” Harry teased into Draco’s ear, his arm on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco cleared his throat, which suddenly felt choked. Misreading the sentiment, Harry leaned into Draco and said, “You’ve raised a really good kid, you know.”
It took several more glasses of wine before Draco could be coaxed out of his bingo-induced sulk. By then, Astoria had moved back to her original manipulation: Scorpius and the
Jealousy aside, he had to admit the garden designed for Harry made for a perfect dinner setting. Then, a soft breeze ruffled Draco’s hair, bringing back his envy. He stifled a groan and tried not to think of the Manor’s tendency for rooms to swing from freezing to boiling.
“You did this on purpose!” Draco accused Hermione Granger-Weasley, one of the most powerful witches alive, his boss.
We resolve the events of the last chapter, then an otherworldly friend comes to bring Simon and Baz home.
“It’s not like I don’t appreciate her ambition for me,” Draco explained. “But every job offer just showed me that I enjoy my job, and have zero interest in advancing further.”
When the last Bingo had been called, Draco excused himself from the table to use the restroom. Returning, he saw Harry in deep conversation with a stranger. A very attractive stranger.
Harry cleared his throat, but the next words sounded rough despite the action, “I guess, in that situation, I’d rather you Polyjuice into me.”
Harry had tried to stay out of it at first, leaving the arrangements to Ginny instead. Until he figured out it was Draco with whom they battled. Then, Harry took a lead role in negotiations. He relished the back and forth conducted second hand through lawyers. He picked fights over details he couldn’t have cared less about, to Ginny’s increasingly dismayed reactions. Perhaps his ignoring her wishes had been the final nail in the coffin of their relationship.
Scorpius shook his head, his hands tightening around his fork. He paused in his food hoovering,  shifting in his chair as if debating something. Without looking up, he spoke, “Maybe I could come back here sometimes? To visit you and Mr. Potter?”
Harry picked the book up, stroking the cover almost reverently. “You’re not a fan of this book, are you?” Harry asked.
,” The Headmistress repeats. “Mr Snow, while you are with us, I would like to investigate your transformation a bit more.” She clears her throat. “I may be in administration now but, as I said earlier, there is no age limit to education.” Her resulting smile warms my heart. It reminds me of Ms Possibelf, now that I think about it. I believe that she really cares.
Draco still couldn’t bring himself to look into those eyes. Instead, he bent his face to the base of Harry’s neck, dragging his nose up the contours, bringing his teeth to a silken ear lobe. Before he bit, he placed one hand on Harry’s chest, feeling the race of that beautiful heart beneath Draco’s palm. He brought the other hand to Harry’s waist, clenching a fist in the fabric there.
With the gentle press of a forefinger, Draco drew back Scorpius’s gaze by his chin. “I’m not good at this,” Draco admitted, staring into his son’s eyes, a perfect mix of his gray and Astoria’s bright blue. “It’s no excuse, but I will try to be better.”
Scorpius had no idea what to do with this information, so he settled on picking up his copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ and taking it to the living room with Rose. Harry watched the action with poorly disguised curiosity.
“As if I’d let him go on air in these clothes,” Draco gestured at Harry’s baggy jeans, t-shirt, and ratty trainers.
She hums but doesn’t respond; outside her office, she’s adopted a more commanding tone. Still, I’m sure she’s committing the fact to memory.
“Yes,” The Headmistress sits up in her chair. “You are welcome to stay at Hogwarts, of course. I have promised the Saviour of the Wizarding World that I would keep you under my protection.” She chuckles at this, but the joke is lost on Simon and me; a fact we acknowledge in a shared look. “Unfortunately, due to recent damage to the castle, I cannot spare a private bedroom. You may stay with Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy until we find a way to send you home. I assume the four of you are mature enough to come to a reasonable solution?”
“So,” She said, leaning over her desk. “After talking with you last week, about my fear of failure when starting this job, I started to think about all of the projects I’d wanted to tackle when I became Deputy Minister. And it honestly depressed me a bit. There’s still so much I want to accomplish. I complained to Ron, and he joked that I needed to double myself.”
The Headmistress sweeps out of her office and along the hallways with the confidence of a woman in charge. Again, I’m getting strong Mitali Bunce vibes from her, and I have a fleeting wish to see the two magickal powerhouses interact.
It hurt Draco’s soul to nod in assent, the pain deepening at the look of pity on the faces of his two closest friends. Pity that didn’t quickly disappear under a layer of practiced apathy or scorn.
Harry let out a deep exhale. “I spent a lot of those first months back wondering if I made the wrong choice.”
“Oh!” Potter finally caught the scent of a potential connection. “Do you want to tell me about the book you’re reading?”
“What’s going on?” She asked “You’re never late, and you’re never this angry, and you’re. Merlin, Draco, are you wearing two different shoes?”
“But why?” Harry whined, clearly having had this debate many times, never to his preferred conclusion.
will find.” Turning to Draco, “And of course we have your hair saved up, dear. We have for years.” She turned her nose up in the air. “You know I had a terrible pash on you in sixth year, and Blaise lets me roleplay where I turn you straight.” Then, the evil woman winked at him, “You weren’t kidding about your best asset. Blaise was quite jealous when he saw it.”
Draco released his breath in a gasp, then threw his hand over his mouth. The silence in the next room was deafening. If they heard him... Draco had almost turned back into his bedroom when Pansy spoke again.
Even though Draco knew Harry’d meant to come out anyway, the gesture made his heart tighten. “This is your choice; I’d hate to feel like we’re pressuring you.”
“I don’t know if I can,” Draco admitted. Looking at Harry, at his now-open body language, the kindness in his eyes, Draco felt that same twinge he’d experienced when envying Hermione and Ron’s child care routine, when enjoying the simplicity of breakfast shared with Harry and Scorpius, when witnessing his mother embrace sarcasm with her grandson.
Harry shook his head, “If only I’d come out sooner. I thought that op-ed was enough, but I was a coward. Not wanting the press, when, in this case, it might have actually done some good.” He slapped his fist against the wall.
Astoria leaned over and brought the card into the center of the table so they could both see it. “See,” She pointed to several squares. “When you complained about any of these items, we’d get a square.”
Harry took his elbow, and they moved to the stoop of Draco’s flat to Apparate. At least Draco had been able to teach Harry
I feel my own jawline, which has sprouted a rather bushy beard. Something I might expect after a month of growth, were I not completely annoyed by the feel of stubble.
Simon lets out a puff of air that ruffles Baz’s hair. “What’s it like? Being the Chosen One over here?”
Harry narrows his eyes. “There’s more to your story, but I’ll allow it. For now. What do you want to ask me? Or Malfoy?”
“Honestly, Potter, your manners clearly need work. So many projects with you! First, I’ll help you write your coming out statement—I assume you haven’t started this yet, given the way you approached the six years of schooling we shared. Then we’ll tackle your public address. Of course, we’ll have to manage your wardrobe as well, because, I mean, look at you. Last, we’ll start on your manners. Merlin, I should have known being friends with you would be such work. Really, you should be thanking your lucky stars Hermione pushed us together sooner rather than later. Imagine if I hadn’t come along, how lost you’d—.”
Hermione fixed him with her discerning gaze. “You’d better not have found a new job already. I’ll throw all of your newly filed papers on the floor if you leave me without warning.”
Draco tried not to look uncomfortable, remembering his own role in the whole affair. Lavender rolled her eyes.
Draco navigated the towering piles of fabric with the ease of having been to Guillaume’s Bespoke Tailoring many times in his adult life. He suppressed a smile at one overturned heap; the latest customer had obviously not had the same amount of luck.
Because for all Draco screamed about the lessons his father had taught him, the biggest emotion he felt when reflecting on Lucius Malfoy was absence. An absence of approval, of love, of time.
“Mr. Potter! You’re still here,” Scorpius said, his face flushed with the excitement of the outdoors.
As Harry shuddered and shook against Draco’s body, a surge of protectiveness gripped Draco’s heart. Given Harry’s enlightened attitude, it had been easy to forget the sheer amount of trauma this man had suffered. He’d done the best he could, worked hard to heal, but it didn’t protect him completely. Nothing could.
Then, he saw the mirth in her eyes and relented. He was getting too old for prolonged grudges, anyways.
Harry shrugged. “Given everything that happened during the war, should it surprise you that strength of spirit would be something I prized?”
A lock of hair falls from the blond’s styling. When he moves to smooth it back, the other man frowns deeper, and Baz and I laugh. The blond catches our reaction and sneers.
, as if sharing the burden had lessened it somehow. Circe, could one turn Hufflepuff from too many hugs?
Clasping his hand over his heart, Draco gasped, “Potter, did you use your celebrity for a short cut?” Because without his influence, there was no way he could have acquired a Portkey on such short notice.
He tried not to be offended at her hesitancy in revealing this. She knew better; obviously, Draco had evolved in his way of thinking on pure-blood and wizarding supremacy. But they’d both been raised in the same restrictive environment, stuffed full of prejudice until their insides were fit to burst with hatred. Astoria’s wariness wasn’t personal; it was ingrained.
Once Hermione and Draco had laid out the priorities of the day, Draco snuck over to Shacklebolt’s office to check on Lavender. Her face was more gaunt than usual, her hair a bit less curly, but overall she looked well.
The not-so-surprising revelation! Finally! Whew, this chapter isn't even all that long, but it feels like a lot happens.
Draco tried to ignore the hurt in Harry’s voice; this wasn’t something he could share. Not yet, anyway.
“You know, I almost regret sending him to a mind healer. And then I remember his drunken debauchery and I decide that Zen Harry is infinitely better than Repressed and Depressed Harry,” Hermione said. “Only, I wish he remembered that lunchtime healing sessions are never a good idea.”
“I hated the idea of it at first, but now I don’t know what to think of it,” Draco confessed. “Have you read it?”
Then, before Hermione could give him her sage but unwanted and likely to be unheeded advice, the evening took a turn for the strange when a crack of Apparition brought Harry Potter into the living room.
Harry nodded, and pulled out a wrinkled piece of parchment from his back pocket. Pansy sighed, and did her best to smooth the paper out, muttering about professionalism or the lack thereof under her breath.
Harry’s stomach lurches. He looks over at Draco who has, mercifully, fallen asleep. Plucking the near full tumbler from Draco’s relaxed fingers, Harry chugs it in one.
It was the most comfortable Draco had felt with Scorpius, and he didn’t want to dwell on the fact it was prompted by having Harry Potter act like a boyfriend inside Draco’s kitchen.
A soft whimper pulls Draco from sleep. He keeps his eyes closed, not wanting to move. Not able to, actually. His sheets are tucked tightly around him, the way his mother used to send him to sleep when just a little boy.
“Not entirely,” Draco explained. “It’s designed for muggles, but the location isn’t a coincidence. The Pub is under magic, a sort of wizard-repelling Charm. Muggles can see and enter without issue, but wizards have to use a special code to enter.”
Raising one eyebrow, “You sure you want to keep whining? You’re running out of buttons there, Potter.” He tutted. “I don’t know what gay clubs
give Harry Potter the complete ‘I-wish-you-were-my-real-dad’ stamp of approval. Draco would be jealous if the idea of having an emotion right now didn’t make him feel so incredibly tired. Instead, Draco sipped his wine.
With a wry smile, Harry complied, and Draco watched his face as The Pub popped into existence, a rainbow of colors that lit up the dark street.
Fully sated from their greasy pub meals, Harry and Draco rested in a corner booth behind a Disillusionment charm, watching Scorpius eat his butterbeer ice cream with apparent delight. It was all Draco could do to keep a dopey smile off his face. Until Draco saw a similar expression reflected on Harry’s, and he decided that if it was good enough for the Chosen One, it was good enough for him.
“Promise.” Draco held his son’s gaze for a moment longer, trying to express every ounce of determination on this effort. Trying to reflect every ounce of love he felt.
“It’s Zabini now,” Draco corrected. “And if it’s in ‘The Wrong Sider’, he knows. He’s only read the book 20 times.”
Pansy waved a dismissing hand. “I sincerely doubt that people will move on so quickly, but your logic isn’t bad. We can have the statement hit Thursday morning, which gives our reporters some time to dig into Potter’s past to see if we can give the story any juice before that evening’s press conference.” She glanced over at Harry. “Sorry about that. But you know it’s inevitable. You’re welcome to steer me in more flattering directions, if you’d like.”
“Goodbye, Granger-Weasleys, and thank you for a lovely evening,” Draco said, wishing he was laying on the compliments rather than actually meaning them.
And Draco didn’t push. Didn’t pry out the details he was dying to know. What had happened to the Boy Who Lived Twice? Why had he dropped out of the wizarding world?
“Potter!” His eyes widened with concern. “You realize what they’ll assume about you. What they’ll print. You hate this kind of press coverage.”
“Wouldn’t you have to appeal to the editor to shut down a story?” Harry asked. “And how can you leverage scandals against him, considering he chooses what to print?”
The Headmistress tents her fingers across her chest. “Mr Malfoy has also had an unfortunate role placed on him. I advise you to judge the man for who he is today, rather than what you might hear whispered in the hallways.”
Draco winced. “I’m not sure about that. We’re still.” He sighed, and decided to gamble. “It’s not easy between us, but it seems to be easier when you’re around. Would you mind staying?”
“Draco,” Hermione’s best mothering voice chastised him mockingly as she entered the office, scooting around Lavender. “You know the rules: no threatening Ministry Employees in my presence.”
Forehead kisses to my stupid boys who love each other, and to all my readers/commenters/kudos-givers!
She waved his grinning face away, her own face trying to hide her pleasure, as if she hated it. Draco felt a slight twinge, one he always felt at blatant affection between the couples in his life.
, Harry. And, no, he’s not the reason I’ve been away. I’m simply getting too old to stay out past 10 p.m. on a school night.” Draco rolled his eyes at Treasure’s responding pout. “But, he is the reason we came out tonight. As you see,” Draco leaned forward and spoke in a false whisper, “Harry has recently come out as bi, and needed an evening in gay London.” He leaned back. “Naturally, I thought of The Pub.”
“Honestly, I know nothing about wine,” Harry laughed as they sat down. “But it is better than I’d expected.”
“You know that doesn’t matter to me,” Draco said, giving his most sincere look. Thinking back on his earlier brainstorm with Hermione, “Have you told him yet?”
“Probably both,” She admitted with a smile before continuing. “And it just so happened Ron was watching this muggle television show I introduced him to, ‘The West Wing’, when it dawned on me: their presidents and vice presidents had whole teams of people to enact their legislative goals. So while you were out on Friday, I put together a proposal.”
“I’ve got a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore,” Harry said in a joking tone, though Draco didn’t understand the punch line.
Anyways I'll just be in a corner crying over Natasha calling Baz 'little puff' until I can't breathe.
Footsteps sounded down the corridor. “Don’t mind me,” Blaise remarked, grabbing a full flute on his way in and taking a seat on the kitchen counter. “Just here to watch.” He summoned a plate of pancakes, ate one off the stack. Waved for the show to continue.
“Well,” Draco drawled. “I was hoping you’d have figured it out by now, but if you need it spelled out to you in terms even a Gryffindor would understand: the reason your gay friends want you to come out so strongly is because we understand the shame of the closet and we know how much better our lives would have been if we’d had someone like you to look up to.”
She lifts her wand and moves it in prescribed, graceful sweeps, murmuring softly to herself. Some of the spells I can see: smoke-like spirals and colorful geometric patterns colliding over my skin. Some of the spells I suspect can only be viewed through her lenses. They tingle a bit.
Treasure smiled back, but there was no joy in it. “Yes, I was exactly like now. Came out of the womb like this, really.” He sighed. “I don’t mean to belittle Draco’s experiences, but in some ways it was easier for him. He’s like me, but he doesn’t
Draco groaned, settling into the ancient leather. Harry motioned for Draco to scoot over, and, with a powerful eye roll, he allowed Harry to take the seat next to him.
who said Luna deserves better and, you know what, I agree! I hope I've given her part in this story a good ending.
Draco took pity on his son trying to stay strong for appearances sake. “I know you’re not tired, son, but I am. It’s been a long week, and we have a full day ahead of us.”
“Oh Godric,” Harry laughed. “How did I ever doubt he was your son? That expression is the most Draco Malfoy thing I’ve ever seen.”
Finally locating the treats, Draco extended one to Winifred, who ate, hooted her approval, then escaped through the kitchen window.
Sending him a glare, “Oh really, Malfoy? How would you like being marked for death? Watching every single parental figure in your life die to protect you? Being called a liar by your government for telling the truth? Watching your secrets spill across the pages of the news? Spending an entire year living in a tent, hunting dark magic while being hunted along with your best friends? Having the weight of the whole Wizarding World on your shoulders? Knowing every day you live is another death on your conscience?” Harry’s chest heaves and Malfoy turns his face so Harry can’t read it. “I died,” Harry’s voice cracks. “I died, and they still haven’t enough of me.”
I can’t help but laugh; Baz has been sitting cross-legged in front of the mirror for the last thirty minutes. “If this is personally offensive to you, don’t watch.”
“...We’re entering hour fifteen of waiting outside the Acropolis Wedding Resort in Athens, Greece, where Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy Estate, and Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, were both dumped by their partners-to-be on their respective wedding days.
” Draco nearly tripped as he extricated himself from the barstool, grasping Harry’s arm. “This will teach those two-timing sluts to walk out on us.”
But Draco knew one thing for certain: Hermoine Granger-Weasley would never read such a book. Thus, lunch was guaranteed to be the one hour of Draco’s day when he wouldn’t have to think about ‘The Wrong Sider’ and its increasing legion of fans.
Harry scooted along the wall so his shoulder brushed Draco’s, the additional warmth almost intolerable to withstand. “About that.”
Harry’s staring at his hands when I give up gnawing on Baz’s finger. “You know I don’t care, right?” He looks up. “That you’re a vampire? That’s not something you needed to keep from me.”
the headline read. Underneath, a split screen photo of Ginny and Blaise, kissing as they boarded the Knight Bus, and the closed door of the hotel’s honeymoon suite. The room in which Draco and Harry currently resided.
Whistling, Draco planned his life for the next six months on his CL, marking down his ‘Scorpius Weeks’ with joy he’d not previously known.
Draco waited a moment for the pain of jealousy to kick in, but all he felt was a zip of anticipation. “You’re welcome to ask him yourself, Scorpius. I’d be happy to have him join us.”
, Pansy? We took Scorpius to Hogsmeade to give him a leg up on his future Hogwarts friends. It wasn’t some hot date. I didn’t even take him to Madam Puddifoot’s,” He tried joking.
Draco glared at her, which she answered by raising both her hands in the air. “Fine! Fine, no more teasing. But seriously, is someone going to tell me what’s going on here?”
Draco pulled out the charm, security lock releasing in an instant, almost throwing the two men to the floor. Harry managed to catch Draco merely inches from the ground.
“So, how long do you need to prepare to see me again?” Potter asked, his eyes glinting with mischief.
“Anyway,” Simon sends Baz a fond look then continues. “We were cast by The Crucible together.” At Malfoy and Harry’s confused faces, he explains, “It’s a spell from our magical boarding school to sort first years into roommates.” He smirks down at Baz. “We hated each other instantly.”
Harry gave Draco a look, the intensity of his eyes flared. “Fuck.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “
“Oh that’s the exception,” Astoria explained, eyes twinkling. “‘Arse’ is on the card for when you looked at it.”
With a sigh, Draco sent back his confirmation for meeting with Astoria, refraining from the impulse to ask after Scorpius. Did his son talk about him? Did he miss his father? Or was he simply grateful to have distance from his emotionally constipated genetic provider?
“You probably know them all,” He drawled, still reeling from Harry’s revelations. “My life seems tame in comparison. After the war, I spent a year in house arrest at the Manor; thanks again,” He raised his glass, which Harry met in another adorable clink, “For pulling the strings that kept me out of Azkaban. Then, I finished my schooling at Hogwarts a year after you. That’s how I met Astoria; she was two years behind us. We concocted our devious plan, graduated, got married. I started my probation at the Ministry, Astoria had Scorpius, we divorced, I was assigned to Granger, and I became a slut.”
Gripping Draco’s shoulders, Harry turned him to face the row of townhomes. It took Draco a second, but he finally noticed that there was a new house where one hadn’t been before.
“I mean,” Harry added, not willing to cease his teasing. “You said yourself you’re not ambitious anymore, you aren’t nearly pretentious enough to be a Ravenclaw, and I’m pretty sure you’d hex me if I implied any Lion-esque traits. That leaves only one house remaining.”
Draco smirked, his face a vision of triumph. This one battle had been real where the others were fabricated. From the day Harry learned of their shared wedding venue, the one thing he’d wanted was to secure the penthouse for his wedding night.
“Good,” Draco praised, delighted to see the flush on Harry’s cheeks for the compliment. “Are you currently dating anyone?”
Writing this fic is turning out to be more of a struggle than I expected, so I apologize for the delays. I really thought I'd move on this story faster. I threw in a reference from one of my favorite movies to cheer me up, so points to anyone who finds it. Also, I spent way too much time trying to figure out the perfect channel number for The Prophet news station.
A tapping at Draco’s bedroom window stirred him from thoughts of strong thighs and vulnerable hugs. He rose to find Astoria’s white owl, Snowy, waiting patiently with a small bundle at its feet.
“Potter!” Draco called from behind him. “Potter, what are you... wait up!” He heaved, his long legs having caught up to Harry but at a significant cost to his inebriated lungs.
Draco’s heart thumped. He examined Harry’s face, distracted by the way he bit his lip while gathering the courage to ask whatever it was he intended to ask. Salazar, since when did Draco find blumbling Gryffindors this endearing?
“Kreacher must apologize for not having more options, Master Draco. And for not serving you at the formal dining table. Kreacher was unaware,” Here Kreacher shot Harry a venomous glare, “That he would have the honor of serving a member of the House of Black today. In the future, and with better notice, Kreacher promises meals more fitting of your station.”
Only, they’d subverted all expectations. Draco by swiftly apologizing and seeking to make amends through hard work and results, Granger by giving him a clean slate to move forward and treating him as a partner rather than an employee. They quickly learned their skill sets were complimentary: Granger charged a path forward with a mission all her own, Draco worked on the sidelines convincing people it was in their own best interest to support her.
Draco’s eyes caught Scorpius’s, the weight of what he’d decided hanging at the back of his mind. Before he could say anything, the young boy launched into his father’s arms, much in the same way Astoria had moments ago. Overwhelmed by this impulsive act of affection, Draco raised his hand to the back of his son's head, gently stroking the soft, blonde hair.
Pansy placed a defensive hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t bring Harry into this. You’re upset at the book, Draco. And you have every right. From what you’ve read, something strange and possibly invasive is happening. But it’s hardly Harry’s fault.”
After an interrogation disguised as a conversation, I decide I like this Harry Potter. He seems to trust us, and he’s making sure I get breakfast, which is always an express pass to my heart.
The man looked so troubled, Draco took pity on him, regardless of poor manners. “It’s all right,” He closed his book and sat up. “Your presence is actually a relief.”
Finally, Draco found a quiet corner, and spun them back into his flat. They landed in his living room; Harry immediately broke from Draco’s hold and doubled over, panting, near sobs.
Nodding emphatically, she spelled her office whiteboard clean. Draco charmed his erasable quill to reflect his thoughts and Hermione watched silently as words and phrases wrote themselves.
Harry shrugged. “Once I became more myself again, I realized that I still shared many of my pre-war dreams. Not being an Auror, obviously. But wanting a family. Wanting stability.”
heart.” Harry paused to shrug. “Maybe I had, despite everything. In any case, Hermione was dealing with restoring her parents’ memories so she and Ron went to Australia, and left me behind.”
“Good morning, Scorpius,” Draco answered, not daring to lift his head, as if eye contact might startle this tentative truce his son offered.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Give it a rest, Hermione. I’m fine. It all worked out, didn’t it? Thanks to your plotting, I am now poised to be Harry’s Baby Gay Mentor.” He gave her a predatory grin. “I’m really quite excited about it. Do you think putting, ‘Helped Harry Potter embrace his inner queer’ is an appropriate line item on my resume? You know, the one I’ll use to leave you for the high-stakes ministry position that is my birthright?”
Scorpius, to his credit, only looked up from the dessert once, took in the two grown men staring at him, said, “You’re weird,” then went back to eating his ice cream.
Harry followed him out of the kitchen, completely oblivious to Draco’s internal turmoil. “You never picked a restaurant for tomorrow,” Harry said, when they reached the fireplace. At Draco’s blank expression, Harry prompted, “Dinner? To help me with my statement?”
“That’s amazing!” Lavender beamed. “It’ll have such an impact. Godric knows there are too many like me after the war.”
“Just getting you prepared for the ogling you're about to receive. Now,” Draco extended an elbow. “Are you ready to go?”
He could just picture The Prophet’s coverage. Their coincidental nuptials had already been front page news. Former death eater and heir to the Malfoy estate to be married on the same day Golden Boy Harry Potter finally tied down the star Chaser of the Holyhead Harpies? Tabloid gold.
“Draco,” Harry said, his hand reaching out to Draco’s shoulder. “You’re not forcing me to do anything I don’t already want to do.”
No matter; I school the confusion off my face and work with Simon to get the blond onto his bed (there’s a sentence I never thought I’d think).
“Oh Godric. I really am the worst house guest, aren’t I?” Harry moaned, throwing his head back on the sofa.
For a second, Hermione said nothing. Just stared at Draco, and sniffed? Did she really just smell him? “You’ve been to 12 Grimmauld Place, haven’t you? I can smell Kreacher on you. Oh, I should have seen this coming.” She rubbed her temples. “You let Harry mind-heal you over your lunch break, you poor, poor thing. He brought up Voldemort too, right?”
After ushering Scorpius into the Floo, Draco looked back at Hermione, Ron, and Rose. They waved goodbye, with Hermione looking rather pleased for having embraced her inner Slytherin for the day.
With his heart exposed, Draco could no longer resist denying himself what he had long sought. Not when the snitch glittered tantalizingly close. Turning to face Harry, Draco’s mind cleared as he raised one hand to the side of Harry’s head, cupping the stubbled cheek in his palm. Harry nuzzled into the touch, releasing a pleasured sigh that spiked Draco’s arousal. But Draco wasn’t ready to finish the game so soon.
, Draco thought, as a trickle of sweat dripped from his hairline. Nothing built to last started in a dark alley behind an overrated wizarding pub. But Draco refused to listen. Avoiding the traction of those damnable green eyes, Draco traced the features of Harry’s fine face with his fingers. The famous scar, bisecting one eyebrow. The imperfect nose, slightly crooked from their Hogwarts Express encounter. The prominent cheekbones, creased from years of digging metal frames. The heart-shaped lips, parted and perfect and inviting.
“And why would I do that? Not one ounce of me is Gryffindor. I doubt I’d make it over the threshold.”
“She didn’t know,” I squeeze his hand so hard that, without vampire strength, I think it’d break. I’m sending all the love I have through the gesture, hoping that works, like when I could share my magic. “She didn’t know how good it could be, being like you.”
“Now now,” Draco warned. “Don’t make me a relative. After all, I have many kinks but incest isn’t one of them.”
“I’d like that. Very much,” Harry said, his intense eyes burning holes into Draco’s. He cleared his throat. “But, not today.” He grinned. “You only have an hour, right. And last night, we spoke only about my problems. Didn’t you intend to chew Hermione’s ear off with complaints? Maybe you could use mine instead?”
“Don’t worry,” Harry reassured her with his temporary face. “His bark is worse than his bite. He’s basically harmless.”
Draco sighed. “It’s a weekly meetup of the former Slytherins. Mostly it’s me, Pansy, Blaise and Astoria. But sometimes others drop in as well.”
Harry chokes out a laugh. “Godric. I didn’t even think about that. I should owl Charlie.” Then, he gives Baz a curious look. “On second thought, that might not be a good idea.”
“Can’t,” Draco responded, grateful for the impulsive promise he’d made to his mother. “I’m taking Mother and Scorpius out to dinner.”
“Space,” Harry begged, his eyes wide, sweat dripping from his hairline, gripping his knees with white knuckles..
It was difficult to conduct a proper toast with plastic cups, but Harry charmingly said, “Clink,” when their two wines met. They each took a sip then walked to find an open table near the stage.
“It has, hasn’t it?” Draco smiled back. It occurred to him suddenly that he’d been allowing himself more than his weekly allotted extreme expressions lately. It occurred to him that maybe he didn’t care.
The resulting stare from Scorpius was so quick and disconcerting, Draco barely had time to school an expressionless face back at his son. “That sounds exactly like something Emil said, at the end of ‘The Wrong Sider.’”
“I am,” Harry said, kneeling down to address Scorpius at the same height, a gesture that did not make Draco want to swoon like a smitten schoolgirl.
“Sorry Deputy Minister Granger-Weasely,” Lavender apologized; their stilted interactions a remnant from sixth year. “I was chastising Draco for socializing without me and lost track of time.”
“True. But it doesn’t lessen your pain, knowing that other people hurt more than you. It’s like,” Harry sighed. “People are always trying to skip over the problem to get to the solution. And I get that, who wants to dwell in the bad, right?”
When we cease snogging long enough to realize we haven’t received an answer, we catch Harry and Draco in the most sexual tension-laden handshake.
“It’s not a popular opinion, I know, but sometimes I wish we’d all just paused for a bit after the war ended instead of moving straight to congratulatory dinners and Azkaban trials,” Harry leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. “What’s the harm in taking time to adjust to the new normal, before rushing in to define the next phase?”
Casual acquaintances often misread Astoria; thinking her more Hufflepuff than anything else. Moments like these reminded Draco that his ex-wife had more Slytherin in her bones than credited. She’d engineered a masterful plan. Manipulated Draco with expert precision. Merlin, he loved her.
“Someone cast a spell on me recently,” I explain. “It was meant to draw out my magic, assuming there was anything left. Instead, it made it so no one could cast spells on me. Not that I mind. I never liked having spells cast on me in the first place. But I am curious… as to what happened.”
“No,” Draco placed his hand on her shoulder. “I’m sorry. I really am touched. Only, sometimes I have to say things I actually mean in sarcastic tones so that my tiny heart doesn’t explode.”
I’d be a good father? Because, what, I’m a good secretary for Granger-Weasley? Because I have a werewolf friend? Because I don’t call Luna Lovegood, ‘Looney’ anymore?”
Huffing, “Of course he told me. I have a very trust-worthy face.” Draco dismissed Hermione’s raised eyebrow with a wave of his hand. “If you can’t be supportive of our new and fragile friendship…”
Draco allowed a sharp exhale at the way that confession punctured his heart. “I’ll talk to your mother, ok? See what she thinks.”
“You bitch,” Pansy said, stomping straight into the kitchen. She threw down a copy of The Prophet in front of Draco, her chipped crimson fingernail landing on the banner headline:
A pause, and then, so quiet Draco almost didn’t hear it, Harry said, “A son needs his father, Draco. A child needs both his parents.”
“I did, yeah.” Potter smiled. “Before I do, and don’t roll your eyes at me, Draco, I will tell you eventually, I promise. Before I tell you, I want you to know that only a select few people know this. Mostly, it’s the circle of friends and family I’ve kept around me these past years. Hermione and Ron, of course. The Weasleys, all of them, even Percy. Hagrid, duh. Luna. Andromeda as well—she’s your aunt, right? And Teddy, he’s old enough to understand. Most of the Dumbledore’s Army crew, at least the ones that come to our monthly pub night—”
The two of them brainstormed for an hour or so, sitting on the sidelines of the pitch where there was ample shade from the evening sun; even in the shade, the summer heat was overwhelming for Draco given he spent most of his time in magically controlled environments. They stopped briefly to have dinner with the boys; Teddy had morphed his hair into a perfect replica of Scorpius’s, which Draco could tell flattered his son. They were fast friends, and the flush in Scorpius’s face indicated that Draco might now be expected to purchase a few tickets for upcoming Quidditch matches.
Potter wasn’t completely invisible. He could be seen on rare occasions. At the weddings of various Gryffindors. At a choice few of the post-war charity events. At Platform 9 ¾ dropping off his godson.
This is seriously one of my favorite chapters I've written thus far. Pansy's a joy to write. Hope you enjoyed it!
Draco tried to scowl, but he always felt so pleased when people noticed things about him. Especially things that made him cute.
Maybe Draco was wrong, though he shuddered to admit it. Maybe it wasn’t being selfish to want time with his son. Perhaps the most selfish thing he could do was not take the opportunity to teach his son the lessons Draco had learned in blood and pain.
As we walk to their dining hall, I’m overwhelmed by how magic shapes their entire life. In a world like this, I don’t have to
“Hush, you,” She smiled over her mug. “But it also helped knowing I’d have you by my side. I couldn’t have done it without you; you understand that, right?”
, as he levitates Harry toward his bed. Harry sighs when his body lands on the mattress. Draco’s heart races as he lays the blankets over Harry, his sleep-warm body no longer twitching in anguish. If Draco allows himself a moment of delusion, he might believe it was his presence and not the soft bedding that coaxed Harry out of his nightmare.
“Oh,” Treasure looked at Draco. “He’s sweet, too!” Leaning into Harry, “It’s a dump, sugar, but I like it that way.” He patted Harry’s face. “Now, I’ll get some faces sent over, free of charge. And no more buying your own drinks!” He directed the last line at Draco before storming toward the bar.  “Trevor! What have I said about thinking for yourself? Draco Malfoy does not
Draco paused, his mouth half open. Taking another drink of wine, Draco decided to be brave. Even if just to spite his recent Hufflepuff-esque behavior. “Because I don’t have Scorpius.”
“Oh fine. You’re no fun,” Draco muttered. Stifling a grin, he pointed his wand at Harry, as if to comply with Harry’s wishes, and popped the top button off instead.
A brief review of previous events from Simon and Baz's perspectives, plus McGonagall helps solve a mystery.
That being said, he was looking forward to lunch in a way he hadn’t in years. Draco loved his job, but endless conversations about the book put him in a real mood. Especially when people seemed convinced that
Harry sat on that question for a moment. “Come to think of it, yeah. They bring it up every time we get together. Your point?”
Draco shot her a look of incredulity. “Do you really want to know?” He rarely brought up his family around Hermione. Not when she still had that souvenir from his crazy aunt carved onto her arm.
“Cheers.” Draco swallowed the shot with eyes closed. When he opened them, he addressed the ceiling with a sigh. “Did you suspect?”
Draco hugged him back, drawing his hands up and down Harry’s spine, almost as if to replicate the sensation Draco’d just experienced. They held each other like this, not quite flush, but pressed tightly enough for Draco to appreciate the sheer warmth of Harry. The hard press of his chest. The strong grip of his arms.
of him. For once, the sound didn’t fill him with that cold mixture of anger he’d always felt. Draco couldn’t help but silently respond to Emil’s unasked question: Would it always feel this way?
Harry watched the entire exchange with a bemused look on his face, while Draco tried to school his shock into an expression of gratitude toward the repulsive, though well-mannered, elf.
Draco very politely did not point out how little her story had to do with him, the person with a career crisis, and the one who had actually called this meeting.
Draco should tear off the sheets for washing. He should gather up the hand towel, wash down the bathtub, clear out the wastebin, and straighten the knick knacks on his shelves.
Me finishing The Epilogue: I've never felt so done with a story. I'm not coming back to this one for years. Maybe decades!
Draco closed the book and glared at his audience. Neither Pansy nor Blaise had taken another sip from their glass during his reading. Harry, on the other hand, seemed as if he’d finished a whole bottle of champagne on his own.
Draco chewed a piece of bacon. He’d been unable to eat more than a few bites of waffle, his stomach tight with the impending departure. It didn’t escape his notice that Scorpius’s question asked and half-answered had slowed his son’s appetite as well.
Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s not a competition. And if it was, I’d win every time, against everyone. Which I actually don’t want, believe it or not. Pain is relative. To someone who’d never been injured before, a paper cut would feel like the worst injury in the world. Is it fair to tell them they aren’t hurt, just because you’d broken a leg before?”
Harry pulls out the second bottle of clear liquor. “From Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” He adds, another reference over my head, then pours into each shot glass until full. “Now,” He sits up straight, “You drop the shot into the pint glass on my count and then drink it as fast as possible.”
“Well, Ron can tell you how long I spent wondering when everyone would find out I was just a little girl who made friends with someone famous and studied so hard everyone assumed I was smart. Then, he reminded me that Harry basically died to save the wizarding world and he thought I was clever, so that helped a bit,” Hermione smirked.
Only one more chapter left... then an epilogue. I can't believe this self-indulgent nonsense is almost over! Thanks to everyone who's enjoyed and commented on this fic so far. Y'all make me so happy, because I don't feel as alone wanting this weird Drarry-SnowBaz hybrid to exist.
“Of course I support it!” Hermione quickly backtracked. “You know I’ve wanted the two of you to become friends for ages.”
“Sins of the father, Potter. I’d know that story better than anyone. Trust me, Scorpius is better off without me.” Draco ran a hand through his hair, singing the tune he’d hummed for years despite not being sure if he still believed it. “I gave him clothes. I gave him books. I gave him Astoria. I even gave him the plausible deniability of my influence. He’s been well provided for. What more could he want?”
Draco has an encounter outside the Leaky that leaves him unsettled, finally finishes reading 'The Wrong Sider', and has problems.
“No, I...” Harry paused. “I want to tell you.” He took in a deep breath. “You know how I went into the forest?”
Harry growled in response, and that was about all Draco had patience for. He stepped into the living room, to Harry’s immediate relief.
“A spider?” Idiot boy Potter said to Draco while Draco slowly disintegrated into the cushions. Probably. Draco couldn’t really tell what cushions were at this point.
“Never,” Draco replied, eyes trained on the dark hair that traveled from Harry’s navel to disappear beneath the waist of his jeans. “Startling you is basically my new hobby.”
“You go,” Baz replies, leaning his head into Simon’s hands, letting his eyes fall closed. “I want to hear how you explain this.”
The sly compliment cracked open the door Draco had endeavored for years to keep shut. “I detected that my invitation missed a key element,” Draco said, holding the parchment to his chest.
She gave him an unrepentant smile. “Nothing, dear. Oh, look at the time.” She looked down at her wrist, which did not bear a timepiece. “It’s been so much fun, but I have some
Ignoring Simon’s and my baffled expressions, he waves his wand and speaks in Latin until four glasses, four shot glasses and a tray emerge on the bed. I raise my eyebrows; that’s one nifty trick. Draco waves over Harry’s bottles and places them on the tray in the center of the bed.
“Yes, I separated that out because it’d be helpful for muggle-borns and their families as well. Provide more help than just the headmaster dropping in for one conversation before asking your parents to send you off to magical boarding school for seven years, no context provided at all.”
“Could you transfigure my shirt a little bigger?” Harry asked, pulling at the shoulders. He was quite brawny for a recluse; Draco couldn’t help but admire his strong shoulders and defined arm muscles, perfectly exhibited in Draco’s shirt.
“That’s more like it,” Lavender replied, sweeping her hair over her shoulder. “Now,” She flicked her wand, sending a beacon down the hallway. “I’ve just summoned facilities to help construct your new office. Any requests?”
He couldn’t run from it any longer: the truth that his feelings had grown beyond a simple attraction. These pieces of Harry kept building and had been building for weeks. Any hope Draco could resist the gravity of Harry Potter’s star died the day Harry bent on his knees to address Draco’s son as his equal.
She laughs abruptly, then coughs to cover up her errant chuckle, “Go to class. I assure you, I am well-qualified to maintain their safety.” Harry stands, his hands clenching and unclenching at his side. In a softer voice, “Mr Potter. I promise. No harm has befallen a student this school year. I intend to maintain that record.”
“Babe,” I coo, and join him on the ground, bracketing his legs with mine and pressing my chest against his back. Given my wings, he’s become the default little spoon.
Harry shrugged. “I have nothing to hide. The worst of me has already hit the papers, and, if it hasn’t, I’m not ashamed of who I am or what I’ve done.”
“That’s actually why I invited you tonight,” Astoria said, twirling her mostly full wine glass in her fingers. “I want him to meet you. And Scorpius.”
“Draco, darling, I’m here to—“ His mother rose out of the fireplace, cutting off when she saw the occupants of Draco’s living room.
Resisting the urge to ask who ‘we’ included, Draco said, “Well, I expect a full tour at a later date, but I regret I came here with some other more important purpose.”
Draco wanted to object, but Harry raised his hand, and Draco nodded, urging him on. This was, after all, Harry’s secret to tell. Even if he was being a giant self-sacrificing wanker about it.
“You are too kind, Kreacher; the pleasure is all mine. I’m looking forward to an opportunity to see how well you’ve taken care of this esteemed home,” Draco said, taking joy in the way the house elf preened under Draco’s praise. At the rumble of his stomach, Draco decided to press his pure-blood advantage, an act Draco only used in desperate and, apparently hungry, times. “However, the tour will have to come later. For today, Master Harry promised that I will have the privilege of sampling your cooking.”
Draco nodded, not surprised that Ron worked late at Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes. Administrative roles at the Ministry typically ran 8 to 5, but stores on Diagon were open 10 to 7, meaning Ron took the morning shift with Hugo and Rose, while Hermione took the evening shift. It meant Hermione often had to work from home in the evenings to accomplish all the goals she’d set for herself in the day, but she confessed that she did her best drafting and revising while curled up next to her husband. It was the kind of family routine Draco might envy, if he thought about it long enough.
She smiled and wrapped her arms around him. He didn’t break down. Honest. But if there was a bit of a wet spot on Hermione’s left shoulder that wasn’t there before the hug, neither of them mentioned it.
“Obviously not,” Draco said. “But sometimes context matters. Knowing that other people have been hurt worse than you could help you manage your own pain.”
“Sure. Why not?,” Draco snorted. “Let’s pile on the absurdity. Lord knows a day like today deserves more crazy.”
It took Draco a second before he caught the meaning. “I could tell you stories about him, if you want. About Dobby.”
This pause allowed an even deeper melancholy to settle. Draco could tell that, greater than Ginny’s betrayal, feeling abandoned by Ron and Hermione had cut him deeper. Like a good friend, Harry didn’t elaborate on that heartache, but Draco felt it.
Malfoy clears his throat. Harry looks over, surprised to see Malfoy’s face nearly completely flushed red. He must be flushed from the alcohol.
Don’t even get me started on Draco. Of course, I may be a bit biased (body bind incident and all), but while the dining hall audience watches Harry with reverence, they glare at Draco with malice.
Shaking her head, “Pansy gets a mysterious new celebrity PR client, Scorpius can’t stop asking about the Golden Trio, and you start making expressive faces at an unknown messenger.” She smirked. “It’s always been Potter for you, hasn’t it?”
Harry gave a wry smile. “Technically, I wasn’t allowed until fourth year due to some issues getting parental permission.”
Pushing aside his inadequacies, Draco returned his focus to Harry. He had yet to stop his gentle backrub, and paused for a moment to give Harry an extra tight squeeze. He hoped the subtle movement would convey to Harry his friendship and care. The things he couldn’t brave speaking out loud.
“‘Our first official friend outing?’” Harry quoted, laughing. “I didn’t realize we were keeping track.”
“Oh. That.” The tension drains. “No. I guess not.” Baz tilts his head to the side. “Seems harmless enough. I brought the mirror from the Hampshire house, and you know how haunted that place was. I’m sure it’ll go away eventually. Just, you know. Don’t touch it.”
Draco entertained a flashback of their night at The Pub, and the sly smirk on Harry’s face betrayed similar thoughts.
“Sometimes, I wonder whether the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin was the biggest wasted opportunity of our lifetime,” Draco admitted. “Imagine if more people understood that pairing vision with cunning could change the world.”
Mother and Harry exchanged glances, then, after a meaningful head nod from Mother, Harry knelt beside Scorpius. “Did you know your Grandmother saved my life?”
Draco sipped his wine. “What I told Treasure.” At Harry’s unimpressed stare, Draco continued, “And also because the club scene gets old after awhile. I got old.”
“Of course, I should probably leave, then. Let you both have some quality father-son time,” Harry said.
Except Draco didn’t want to look at Harry’s face right now, lest he see pity. Or something worse. Instead, he dropped his eyes to the book he held in his hand. Looked at the front cover once more, having seen it so many times in the grasp of his son’s hand, on the bedside table in Scorpius’s room, on his own coffee table. In every bookstore he’d passed for the last several months. In the hands of countless witches and wizards.
Rubbing his arm gently again, “Honey, when it comes to Potter, you’re as transparent as Thestral hide.”
At this, Draco couldn’t help but interrupt. “You know those deaths weren’t yours. Nor was Hermione and Ron’s choice to help you. They aren’t your burdens to carry.” Salazar, Draco wished he could lighten the load that had settled on Harry’s shoulders at this conversation. When he asked for secrets, he didn’t expect for Harry to bare the soul behind his mask of self-assurement.
,” Lavender shook her head, amused despite herself. “And you’ll want to be nicer to me, considering I’m placing the request to create your new office.”
Ron kissed Hermoine sweetly on the cheek, “Hello gorgeous.” Her husband was the only person Draco knew who dared compliment the Deputy Minister on her looks.
“I’m not saying it’ll be easy,” Astoria said. “But Killian and I? We’re a speed bump in the road to your healthy relationship with Scorpius. Draco… the only real obstacle here is you.”
The sunlight glinted off Harry’s (still unfashionable) glasses, rendering his expression unreadable. “Right, Hermione.”
“Blaise was my last hope at an advantageous marriage. The last pure-blood willing to dirty themselves with the Malfoy name.”
Though he hadn’t quite come to a conclusion on what type of job would make him happy, he turned his attention to Potter’s other question. The question of whether or not Draco feared failure.
Draco shifted in his chair. “A little, but continue.” He didn’t risk a glance at Harry, choosing to take drag from the cigarette instead.
Harry gave Draco a crooked smile, and led the way into his home. Harry Potter’s home. That Draco was now visiting. To distract himself from the continued roller coaster of Draco’s week, as well as the view he had walking behind Harry into the house, Draco babbled.
“In the back garden?” Harry offered, not looking nearly chastised enough for Draco’s ad hoc etiquette lesson. He even had the audacity to move in the direction of his suggested location without first waiting for Draco’s approval.
I keep waiting for Simon to shift into Chosen One mode, but he doesn’t seem concerned in the slightest that we’re magic-knows-where with magic-knows-who and magic-knows-how we’re going to get home.
Returning his full gaze to Harry, Treasure continued, “You see, it’s not acceptable to be gay and be pure-blood. I was an abomination. So while Draco played straight and got to go to Hogwarts, I stayed home and got homeschooled.”
“All right, but I’m only letting him off the hook because I’m so very pleased you’ve graced us with your presence, Draco. Now, give us a hug.” The man commanded.
She blushed. “Sorry! I got so excited. It’s Director of Legislative Affairs, Deputy Minister’s Office. Kingsley’s position will be the same, but for the Minister’s Office. Whoever they pick, I’d expect the two of you will work closely together.”
Draco raised one eyebrow. “Are we stating our addresses for fun now? Should I join? Mine’s not as catchy, but I don’t like being left out.”
Delighting in Mike’s involuntary wince at Draco’s grip, he answered the handshake with a tart, “Pleasure.” To Harry, “Are you ready to leave?” It was well past midnight, and Draco had his meeting about career options with Hermione the next day.
Harry chuckled. “You’re about to find out. Just remember that when I say go, you touch the can of beans.”
“Wha?” Draco sputtered. He shook out his shoulders, attempting to put on a stern face. “To what exactly are you referring?”
Baz jabs his elbow back into my side, gently. “I told you; no more food in the bedroom. You get crumbs everywhere.”
Without stopping to say goodbye to Mike, or Treasure, for that matter, Draco exited The Pub. But he couldn’t help himself from glancing back inside as he turned to Apparate, the grip of his stomach tightening as Draco saw Mike lean into Harry, their laughter frozen in Draco’s mind as The Pub spun out of his vision.
Draco blushed. “They were my favorite foods as a child.” He tried not to dance with delight as he filled his plate with starchy goodness while eyeing a piece of chocolate cake he intended to devour later. “I can’t believe he remembered all of them. He must be a very good house elf.”
He followed her in, choosing to stand so they’d remain at the same height. “Were you afraid of failing when you took the Deputy Minister position?”
“Oh,” Draco’s face sunk, remembering he didn’t actually have a waffle iron. “I don’t actually have--”
Draco wondered for a brief moment how Hermoine knew to reach him through Harry, and then he remembered who he was dealing with and left the thought alone.
“Yeah, well.” He takes another large sip. “Old habits and all.” Sighing, “I am sorry, by the way. That I implied you liked being the Chosen One. I knew better. I
Trying to ignore the lump forming in his throat at the casual touch and reference, Draco nodded. “Of course, Scorpius. If that’s what you want.”
Draco’s CL buzzed. “And now, I’ll display more un-Malfoy-esque manners,” He said, pulling out the notebook, knowing it’d be personal rather than work. He flicked to his new messages.
Leaning against the door, Harry pulled Draco flush to him, letting Draco feel for himself the truth of the situation.
Harry responded with a shrug, the animal. Draco ignored the tingling sensation on his nose which was certainly from leftover butterbeer bubbles and nothing else.
With every ounce of disdain, Draco shoved Harry Potter aside with his elbow and stomped to a corner booth. “I am
Draco leaned back in his chair, wishing to hell and back that today wasn’t a full moon. He knew Lavender would be back tomorrow, but he needed her
They saw the master bedroom where Harry slept, the rooms preserved for brothers Sirius and Regulus Black, the latter an unsung hero in the defeat of Voldemort. They skipped the many guest bedrooms in favor of seeing the cellar where Kreacher conducted his business, the regulation sized Quidditch pitch the house had seen fit to build for Harry’s solitude, the room of Black heritage where the family tapestry and various ancestral portraits resided (including the infamous Walburga), and the house elf memorial which seemed a bit gauche until Harry explained Kreacher wouldn’t let him throw the taxidermied elf heads away on the threat of quitting.
Grey eyes turned toward the park where Scorpius was still swinging, still climbing the air, trying to fly.
Draco smiled, “No. It’s hard to stay mad at her for her blatant disregard of boundaries because I love
“It just, really pissed me off. To see their words echo the hate I’d been essentially directing to myself. Luna helped me write the letter.”
“Will you watch me?” Harry asked, following Draco to the Floo. “I’d feel better, knowing you were watching.”
“Perhaps,” The Headmistress considers. “Whatever that spell was meant to do, the one that resulted in your being immune to magic, I think your body reacted defensively. Mostly likely subconsciously. When I examined you earlier I saw a rather complex set of wards.” At my confused look, she explains, “Magickal protection spells. Of course, like Mr Grimm-Pitch’s magic, they do not work in our world.”
Draco woke up before his alarm, full of dread. He knew this day was coming, had even spent the first half of Scorpius’s visit eagerly wishing for it. But now that it was here, Draco didn’t want to let his son go. And he had absolutely no idea what to do with that feeling.
Draco’s stomach twisted. It was too much to handle. He spared a brief glance back at the pub, regretting he’d left the comfort of Lavender’s side. Regretting he’d come at all.
Draco quirked an eyebrow at this strangely emphatic response, but continued his prior train of thought. “So, you want to keep something just for you and your loved ones.” He paused, trying not to preen in how Harry kept nodding along, agreeing with Draco’s insight. “There are lots of secrets I’d support you keeping, you know. I’m not just pushing you to bare your whole soul for the sake of my enjoyment. Only, this secret you need to share because it matters.”
“Are we actually getting dinner? Or is this the continuation of your plot to make me befriend Potter?” Draco asked Hermione.
A corner of Harry’s mouth twitched. “Good grief? Silly sod?” He laughed. “How do you look 20 but sound 80?”
A small voice sounded from the hallway. “Father? What’s going on?” Then, Scorpius rounded the corner. “Aunt Pansy!” He screamed.
“They’re trying to make a baby, Harry. We’re not allowed to judge,” Draco said, quoting Astoria, weakly, because it’s all he could say, really.
Draco shot him one back, hopeful it didn’t contain the level of concern he felt. “Are you sure you’re ready for this?” He asked.
“Pick it up,” Draco commanded, and he watched Harry comply without complaint, his finger falling on the change that had upturned Draco’s life.
. “You’re basically one of the best things to ever happen to Hermione’s career. And they do actually like you, you know. They’ve been begging me to hang out with the three of you for ages.”
Blinking, “We’ll unpack all that later. How about we put you and your boyfriend to sleep?” Harry says.
After their embarrassingly Hufflepuff hug (Hugglepuff? Hufflehug?), there was no way Draco could get out of his scheduled trip to the Granger-Weasley’s. In fact, Hermione sent him home an hour early to collect Scorpius and a bottle of Malfoy Manor-approved wine, which his mother still delivered regularly enough for Draco to share with others.
Listening the whole time, his heart wide open in a way he hadn’t felt since childhood, Draco wished he’d brought a second bottle of wine to The Burrow II, and that he wasn’t one second away from crying.
, Potter. Keep your grabby hands to yourself.” He punctuated these words with a hand slap. “Salazar, your manners need work. Shame it’s not on our agenda for this evening. Now, where shall we eat?”
The look of confusion on Harry’s face would be adorable in any other situation. “But I thought—Hermoine said you and Astoria were close.”
Seeing Draco arrive home early shocked his mother, but she didn’t press. Most likely because she didn’t understand the nuances of working, and probably assumed some weird Ministry quirk sent employees home at 4 p.m. on Tuesdays. She released Scorpius reluctantly, and Draco pointedly did not notice the two of them got along better after two days in close contact compared to Draco’s and Scorpius’s relationship built over ten years of distant interactions.
The weight of his epiphany hit him with a dropping sensation in his stomach. He drained his glass in one gulp.
“Luna wanted to travel. To experience. We had a long talk about it, and split amicably. I know that’s a lie people often give, but it was real with us. I was the Man of Honor at her wedding.”
“Maybe if we’d had this back in our day, we wouldn’t have needed to resort to mud-slinging,” Draco elbowed Harry.
“Yes, yes,” Baz murmurs, settling deep into Simon’s lap. “You know all about repressed homosexual love for your archnemesis. Bravo. You’re the expert.”
“Come over for dinner tonight.” She posed it like a demand, not a question. The tactic nearly always worked.
Draco resisted the urge to reach out and take Harry’s hand. “You don’t have to answer; not if you don’t want to.”
Teddy had yet to arrive, which suited their purpose of a full house tour, as Draco imagined his cousin had seen it all before. Kreacher led the way, with Harry whispering snide comments for Draco’s benefit, his hot breath in Draco’s ear an unexpected delight.
The tapping of owls and CL buzzing haunted the rest of Draco’s day (it had only taken Hermione a day to figure out to allow personal messages through Draco’s work-do-not-disturb, and had sent the charm updates to his CL overnight. Without warning).
on how Simon hides his wings. I won't spoil the content, but just know in no way was this my idea. My brain is not that good.
Draco watched Scorpius pause for a second, give his father an unreadable glance, before tearing away from his breakfast.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but before Harry could elaborate, Scorpius and Mother returned from the park.
“No, the part where you said I’m right. This night has not at all turned out like I needed it to, so I might as well take something home for my wank file.” As tempted as he was to peek at Harry’s reaction, Draco kept his eyelids firmly shut.
Turning back to the rest of the room, “Simon gave me the message, and we formed a truce. Together, we helped figure out who killed my mother, and, along the way, fell for one another.” He leans back and pulls Simon’s arms across his chest. “It was my fifth year fantasies come true.”
Draco divested Harry of the next button, and Harry’s hand flew to the opening, clutching it closed like some kind of a virgin.
She blinks. “It is no trouble at all, Mr Snow.” She waves her wand and a clock rises out of its tip. “My goodness!” Glaring at Harry, “Mr Potter, you ought to have left for Transfiguration 15 minutes ago.”
“Ah yes, that,” Pansy said, a hint of disappointment in her voice. Sighing, “So, business it is. Well, lucky for you, I have the inside track to delay or shut down the article.” She turned toward Harry. “I’m a society reporter for the Prophet, which means I have dirt on everyone and the means to employ it.”
“Me either,” Harry reached across the table, grasping Draco’s arm and squeezing. “I’m proud of you.”
“Seriously!” Harry defends. “He let deatheaters into Hogwarts. Nearly killed two classmates, one of which was
He peaks around the corner of Harry and Draco’s bathroom with a sheepish grin. “Saw your hair, didn’t ya?”
She nodded. “I’ve only just arrived.” But, from the thoughtful look on her face, Draco suspected she’d caught more than just the tailend of their conversation.
In some ways, Draco’s counters to Harry’s points felt like the dying gasps of an opinion he no longer held. Seeing the look on Harry’s face about a boy needing his father… well. Maybe Draco related to that a bit more than he cared to admit.
Lavender’s CL buzzed, and she examined its message with a curse. “Shacklebolt needs me. Tell Hermione she can see him at 9:30, yeah?” She placed her hand on the door, and turned her head back. “And don’t think we won’t discuss this Harry Potter development.” Then, from the hallway, “And you owe me a drag show!”
“It would be cruel to keep two young men such as yourselves locked in a room for an entire week. However, given your magickal situation, it is unlikely you will enjoy all of our classes. That being said, there are a number of classes in which I think you may find enjoyable participation. Come with me.”
Simon looks up, like he’s forgotten the other two men were in the room. “Oh yeah. Well, his mom visited me.” After a beat, “As a ghost. She’s dead.”
Lavender nodded. “Truth,” She said. Then, she cocked her head, and gave Draco an appraising glance. “Something is different about you. You,” She sniffed. “You smell happy.”
“Of course!” The elf sunk into an impossibly lower bow. “Kreacher will bring the meal straight away.”
Most of the time, Harry acted like a soft uncle, with his baggy jumpers, unflattering jeans, and bed-rumpled hair. A less haggard version of Remus Lupin. But here, today, Draco could see the depth of pain and resilience that had allowed a seventeen-year-old boy to win over ostensibly the most powerful dark wizard ever to live. Draco shuddered in the gaze of such intensity, and wanted to surrender.
“Oh my ancestors. Master Draco has arrived with Master Scorpius. Kreacher has been dreaming of this day for ten years.”
“I was wondering,” Harry paused once more, and Draco’s heart threatened to pound a hole through his sternum. “Maybe, you’d like to go with me?”
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s unintentionally tight command of Grimmauld. Of course Harry Potter had earned the hard-won respect of the Most Ancient and Noble House, whereas Draco still couldn’t get the Manor to change the wallpaper in his childhood bedroom from anything other than a pukey shade of green.
Tucking my chin over his shoulder (it’s only when we’re seated that I match him for height), we watch the reflected pair.
Steeling himself for the Floo ride to work, he reminded himself that today was Lavender’s turn on the coffee rotation. Come to think of it, maybe
rabbit hole, “It turns out sharing trauma can forge some pretty deep connections. It was more emotional than anything. I don’t think they did anything more than kiss once or twice. Despite having broken up with Ginny, she did want to end up with me. Only, she wanted the Harry who left. Not the Harry who came back.”
Draco gave Harry a curious glance, and received a shrug that meant something like ‘I’ll tell you later’ or ‘don’t worry about it.’ They’d only known the new versions of each other for less than a week; Draco wasn’t very worried that he hadn’t quite mastered how to interpret the shrugs Harry used to communicate.
“Ooh, I like that phrasing,” Hermione said, opening up her CL to jot it down while Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Unaware of Draco’s nerves, Hermione looked back at the board. “‘Relaxing the Statue of Secrecy Rules’? What did you have in mind?”
Harry laughed. “Sorry, I thought—” He shook his head. “It’s a muggle movie reference. Remind me to show it to you sometime.”
He threw his hands up. “Fine! Whatever. I just wish everyone would stop insulting my clothes. They’re comfy.”
He beamed, and, for once, didn’t calculate the amount of wrinkle reducing potions the act would necessitate. “It’s real. Astoria and I have changed our custody plans.”
Draco had to suppress a gasp at this vulnerability: Harry’s green eyes, unguarded and earnest. Seeking Draco’s approval. If only his 11-year-old self could see this. “I do,” Draco responded, and he hoped Harry was too drunk to recognize the fond look Draco bestowed on him.
Relieved of parental duty, Draco settled into Hermione’s living room couch, and transfigured the cork out of the wine bottle and into a small duck for Hugo, who played on the floor in front of him. The little tyke obsessed over ducks, which Draco found ridiculous but indulged because Hugo was three, and three-year-olds deserved a little whimsy. Even if it came in the form of cork ducks.
Moonlight falls on Harry’s face, still furrowed and dark. The dream may have slipped but the memory is still there. Because it’s late and Draco’s still drunk he allows himself a slip or two. He rubs his thumb along the crease between Harry’s eyebrows. Traces the length of his set jaw. Finally slips his hands through the thick mess of hair, both softer and silkier than he’d imagined.
“Fine,” Draco sighed, as if it were a struggle to accept Harry’s fondness. “How do you want to do this?”
After her departure, Scorpius excused himself to change clothing, leaving Harry and Draco alone again in the living room.
Ten watercooler-side chats left Draco convinced everyone was reading ‘The Wrong Sider.’ The book had taken the whole wizarding world in Great Britain by storm. Draco wanted to believe that speculation behind the identity of its anonymous author drove its meteoric rise, but that was too optimistic for him. Best case, people were riding the wave to restart an anti-death eater bandwagon, and Draco could expect several months of howlers. Worst case, the public was starting to sympathize with those on Voldemort’s side. Draco didn’t need to explain the horrors behind that possibility.
.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Out as in the outside world. Out as in Harry Potter going to a gay bar before he officially comes out. Everyone needs a last ‘hurrah’ after all.”
Then Harry grabs a spare blanket from his trunk, sets a cushioning spell, rolls up his dirty robes like a pillow, and falls asleep.
Harry glared. “No, Draco. I do not still have threesomes.” He sighed. “Without Luna, it lost its appeal. After we split, I learned quickly that anonymous sex just doesn’t do it for me.”
“That my bride would leave with your groom on both our wedding days?” Harry let this laugh escape. “No, I didn’t suspect.”
With a deep sigh, Draco fingered the embossed invitation and leaned back against the Leaky’s exterior. The brick held the lingering day’s heat, but a cool breeze kept him from heading back inside despite the beads of sweat gathering on his forehead. He closed his eyes and counted each breath, in and out, as he relished the respite from laughter and conversations he couldn’t yet allow himself to enter.
Draco’s leg wouldn’t stop shaking as he waited for Hermoine to arrive. He’d accidentally shown up 10 minutes early to work, nervous as he was for Hermione to see the two additions to her calendar. It was possible she’d already seen them. Ok, it was 100 percent certain she’d already seen them—the woman could hardly breathe without checking her CL first.
She kissed him again, right in the spot he’d just cleaned, then settled back in her chair. “How about we alternate? One week on, one week off. That’ll give you a chance to build your relationship, while we ease Scorpius into my new one.”
Harry smiled. “As I pointed out earlier, you’re hardly elderly, but I get your point. There were several months where I spent too many nights out, remembering too few of them in the morning.” He paused. “Of course, you already know about that. You would have read it in The Prophet.”
“No,” Harry answered, the blush spreading for some reason, despite the fact Draco asked this question earlier.
Which is why it shocked him to realize something about that cover had changed. He brought the book closer to his eyes, noting the space beneath the title, the spot where an author’s name should go, the place that normally read ‘by Anonymous’, now said something quite different.
while Draco laughed and indulged his son’s wishes, some faceless partner smiling at Draco with warmth and love.
“Well then,” Draco smirked. “I suppose we’ll be off. Mother, thank you as always for your service. Scorpius, are you ready to leave? We’ll have to Apparate there instead of Floo.”
“Chocolate chip waffles!” Scorpius cried with a fist pump. It was hard for Draco to remember the sullen, quiet boy he’d been upon first arrival.
Draco kisses Harry’s forehead, right on that supid scar he loves to insult. Then, he scoots to the far edge of the mattress and returns to slumber.
A buzzing noise sounded from Harry’s pocket, and he pulled out his CL. Smiling as he read, “Hermione wants to know if Scorpius can come over to The Burrow II tonight when you go to your Friday Snake Up.” He turned his twinkling eyes on Draco. “What in the world is a Friday Snake Up and can I come?”
The wry look on Harry’s face revealed he knew exactly what Slytherin trick Draco’d deployed, but he allowed the change in topic. “Resilient.”
Harry sat up straight, his hand reaching for his wand, but Draco managed a swift head shake before Harry drew.
Harry nodded. “She saw the news articles and came to find me. After her own experiences in the war,” Here, Draco winced, “She went to see a mind healer, and practically forced me to go to one myself. I stopped drinking, started therapy, and went back to Hogwarts for my eighth year.”
Standing in line for his scheduled coffee run, Draco tried and failed to erase the memory of Scorpius’s empty room from that morning.
Draco paused in his steps. “You’re right,” He answered with a slight head ruffle. “I shouldn’t have called Auntie Pansy that word.”
Draco felt Harry’s intense gaze on the side of his face, but refused to meet it. Instead, he settled for the glow of his mother’s rare wrinkle-inducing smiles, and rose to hug her.
Draco examined the look of exasperation on Harry’s face. Then, he poured wine until their glasses were almost overfilled. “Change of plans. First, you’ll need to confess all of your secrets to me,
Draco smirked, “Think of it as a middle finger.” Ignoring Harry’s curious gaze, Draco led him to the X only Draco could see. “All right, Harry. Click your heels together three times and think of home.”
Scorpius gave him a doubtful glance, but calmed down with the new information. Mother relaxed deeper into the couch, her hand twitching around a glass of wine.
“We’re invited to the party?” I ask. Simon and I are wearing spare pajamas that hardly seem fit for public consumption; mine’s two inches short and Simon’s one size too small (it’s all I can do not to stare at his arse, which he keeps catching with a wink).
“I will end you,” Draco threatened. “I don’t care if it gets me sent to Azkaban. Compare me to one of those dirt-loving hippies again and I’ll kill you.”
“How do you burn a pancake?” Harry asked, his chin over Draco’s shoulder in an intensely familiar manner.
Draco cut off, almost running into Harry when their journey ended at a kitchen table. Somehow, Draco’s rambling had distracted him for the entire walk through the house. Harry turned, his face wearing an expression that might almost be described as fond. Feeling uncomfortable, Draco looked around the room, seeking refuge from his unexpected window into Harry’s emotions.
He clapped his hands in front of him and tried on a smile. “Let’s go introduce that boy of yours to the Three Broomsticks. He’s got to be ready for some refreshments after all of that swinging.”
. All right. I’m going to tell you something.” He sighed. “Only Ron, Hermione, Luna, and my mind healer know this.”
“I don’t know what homeschooling means to muggles, but in the pure-blood world it’s the equivalent to muggle conversion therapy,” Draco explained, while Treasure finished the cigarette, emptying the filter into a nearby ashtray.
The next day, everything went wrong. Draco woke up to the screech of his alarm. The Prophet’s owl tore up half of the international section. He’d run out of his favorite tea. He barely had time to make toast, not that Scorpius even left his room to find breakfast.
“What’s going on?” Draco asked, trying to adjust to the scene of his normally stoic son bouncing off the walls while his still stoic mother rubbed her temples delicately on the couch.
“Another thirteen years or so would do it,” Draco snarked, and braced himself for the resulting battle.
Snorting to himself, Harry shook his head. Who was he kidding? Here, in the privacy of his own mind, why was Harry still pretending to be something he wasn’t?
Draco looked down at his remaining cake, only the icing left, and felt his soul leave his body. He couldn’t tell what was more disturbing: that Harry Potter thought he was capable, or that Harry Potter was himself capable of pulling a truth from Draco’s mind that he had never considered.
Harry nodded. “I’ve already made my decision, and I’m not interested in sitting on it any longer. Plus, this way I can keep you and Scorpius out of the papers.”
Mother sighed, “Apparently he is visiting Harry Potter’s home today, and maybe there will be dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets, and also he is going to fly on a broom with his cousin who has purple hair. It’s a lot to take in.”
If you liked this story, and my writing, and you'd like to read more of my stuff, drop a comment because, sadly, nothing motivates me to write like external validation. I have about five WIPs (lol) so I need all the help I can get.
“Oh?” Scorpius said, joining his father in the walk to the kitchen. “Well, I think Mother might approve of your using that word if it’s in reference to Aunt Pansy.”
Harry smiled, and leaned forward. “All right, Draco. I’m going to tell you something very personal about me, and I’m going to trust that you’ll keep it a secret. Can you do that?”
Snowy flew off into the sunset. Well, regardless of how Scorpius felt, Draco could do one thing for his son, he thought as he placed the book on his coffee table.
Treasure groaned. “God, they say never meet your idols, but of course you’d be the exception.” He turned to Draco, “Is he really this noble? I mean, I thought your martyr act was bad, but his takes the cake.”
She smiled. “I should have known you wouldn’t stall on that front for long. Yes,” She took a long drink of water. “I’ve met someone.”
Speaking of, he noticed ‘The Wrong Sider’ had relocated itself from his bookshelf and onto the coffee table. A note on top in Astoria’s handwriting read,
, instantly,” Baz corrects. “After all, old family son,” He points at himself, “Mage’s Heir,” He points at Simon. With a dramatic sigh, “Star-crossed lovers.”
“Oh!” Draco exclaimed. “Right. Well, Scorpius and Mother will be home any minute. Maybe we could hold off? It’s Scorpius’s last night here.”
“Yeah, well,” Harry admitted, having the decency to look sheepish. “I haven’t gotten out much lately, and it’d be nice to see some old faces.” Harry grinned. “It’s been working well with you, after all.”
“We call ourselves wizards.” Harry catches the Headmistress’s eye briefly before turning back to us. “And witches. Wixen, if you prefer a gender neutral term.”
Draco looks up from the textbook he’s studying on his bed. Harry holds up two bottles of liquor in one hand, a six-pack of beer in the other.
Draco nodded. “Come to mine at 8. I’ll have breakfast prepared.” It was a little later than normal, but Draco expected that Harry, as an unemployed layabout, might prefer a bit of a lie-in.
“Come on,” Harry whined. “I’m still a Parselmouth. Surely that nets me an invitation to a gathering of snakes.”
Silence grew between them as Draco did not visualize the sexcapades currently underway at the Zabini house.
The way I figure, my story will come out sooner or later, and I get a good feeling about the Headmistress (or do I only trust people who give me food?) (I’ll unpack that later). Plus, I hate people speculating about my wings and magic and backstory. Now that I know we’re stuck here for at least a week, I have a plan.
Harry, more oblivious than Simon, skips over the unintended confession. “I rather like your mustache.”
She smiled. “Yes, the latest adjustments you made really helped,” She said, her head resting in the palm of her hand, one of her fingers absentmindedly tracing a scar, as they often did. “I can’t thank you enough for the help.”
Panicking that she could smell the bits of hangover the potion didn’t evaporate (namely, the guilt), he realized she meant Scorpius. With his head clear and his vision less foggy, he realized he
Hermione elbowed Draco, and he realized that this must be the part of the conversation requiring his participation. Verbally, probably, though he had no idea how to make sounds happen at the moment. It was, hopefully, a temporary affliction. One that would resolve itself any minute now. Any minute.
Astoria patted Scorpius on the back, but the boy didn’t let up an inch. Sighing, she walked with her new Scorpius-shaped growth to the kitchen table. “Chocolate chip waffles?” She observed. “Trying to steal him away from me with sugary breakfasts?”
Ignoring the accelerating heartbeat in his chest, Draco sputtered, “Well, thank you, Potter. We very much appreciate the consideration.”
They walked this way to the kitchen, before Draco released Scorpius in order to hunt down owl treats. He didn’t need them as much these days; most of his correspondence occurred via CL, except for the Zabini’s and his mother. As he opened cabinet after cabinet, Draco tried to tamp down the anxiety caused by how comfortable he’d become with his son, and the fear that his departure back to a life with Astoria might reset whatever familiarity they’d built over the past week.
“You know, you two are actually perfect for each other,” Treasure observed. “Neither one of you can give up your past mistakes.”
“Walburga?” Harry grinned. “Oh yeah, the old bat is still here. Permanent sticking charm. I doubt even the most experienced cursebreaker could get her off the wall, though we did manage to move her wall to a room outside of the main areas.”
And then, the funniest thing happened. Harry visualized the potential barrage of headlines and realized: he didn’t care. At all. Weeks of waking up in a cold sweat, wondering if he was doing the right thing. Avoiding Hermione’s perceptive eye. Hoping no one noticed he was falling apart.
Draco tried not to let it bother him that Scorpius’s current proximity was due in large part to Potter’s influence. “We went to school together. We met at Hogwarts.”
Harry woke in the morning to the familiar sensation of someone cuddled in his arms. He thought of Ginny and instinctively pulled back. But when he saw blond hair instead of red, Harry paused in his retreat. Draco snuggled deeper into the crook of Harry’s neck, releasing a sigh of content that Harry’s heart met with a clench. Not even trying to stifle the surge of protectiveness that surged in his chest, Harry brought his hand up to the base of Draco’s neck, carding his fingers through the silken strands, and bringing his lips to Draco’s forehead in a chaste kiss.
Draco leaned back in his chair. “Yes, well. Treasure and I have known each other for a few years now. I used to be quite the regular here.”
He realized he’d been in a quiet daze for too long. Draco seemed to have sobered up enough to finish most of the chips. Harry reached out for one, and caught Draco’s hand instead. The other man pulled back as if burnt.
He let out a breath of relief; Harry wasn’t mad at him, then. Not that he thought Harry would be. Not at all. Still, Draco found the message reassuring and wrote back promptly.
As Harry reached for their drink delivery, his smile grew with Draco’s. “That’s amazing, Draco. You seem really pleased.”
Harry leaned back, fixing Draco in a contemplative stare. “You’re too hard on yourself, you know,” Harry said. Draco looked away, but Harry continued. “Do me a favor. Later tonight, when you have the headspace for it, imagine Scorpius in your situation. Would you allow him to say the things you say, if he applied them to himself?”
“Draco, I’m so sorry. I knew I shouldn’t have—” He cut off, looking sheepish when he found Pansy in the room. She responded by mouthing ‘Draco?’ to no one in particular. Draco wondered if going back to bed would erase this all from happening.
Especially when the Baz in the mirror smiles and the Baz in my arms leans deeper into my embrace. It’s like I have two of him, but it’s still not enough.
“Fine, it’s.” Harry mussed his hair and shrugged his shoulders as if that could stretch the fabric. “It’s fine.” He inhaled. “Well, how do I look?”
Hermione started making apologetic phrases with her mouth, but unapologetic expressions with her eyebrows, and Draco was beginning to suspect the two of them, Potter and Malfoy, had been
Baz smiles. “He followed me around our whole fifth year. Convinced I was plotting and up to no good.” Shaking his head, “Instead, I was trying to wank away my gay feelings for him.”
Draco didn’t feel embarrassed at the overflow of emotions he’d spilled at Hermione’s feet. Worse than that, he felt
“Draco Malfoy, open up your wards, you enormous shit; I’m coming through,” Pansy shouted through the fireplace.
“Ah, Fidelius charm. Neat,” Draco nodded, not at all focusing on the fact Harry’s warm hands had yet to leave Draco’s shoulders. He shook them off. “All right, now show me inside. Chop chop.”
Because one misstep rang loudly through all of the bullshit Harry conjured to separate himself from the mess he’d landed in. That, through all of Harry’s denials and deflection, he’d never once taken the time to learn the name (or gender) of Draco’s betrothed.
Exactly fourteen minutes later, Draco ventured back out of his bedroom, stopping before he rounded the corner to the living room when he heard Potter’s voice switch from normal conversation into confessional tones.
Draco huffed. He knew Harry was right, but he didn’t want to admit he’d been cooking the muggle way in order to impress Harry. Now that he’d failed, he certainly wasn’t going to admit his misguided attempt at showing off.
“Potter,” Pansy breathed. “I’m impressed!” Then, she shook her hair. “And a bit dismayed I’m not the staffer you’ve bribed.”
Sighing, “Can’t an established gay man flirt with a newly bisexual man without the blushing virgin routine?” Draco asked.
intimidating?” He tried to straighten up, puffing out his chest like that would add to the imposing factor.
to fall into a mass of textiles. He had yet to remove the glamour that transformed his face and hair into someone unrecognizable, which added to the surreal nature of their encounter.
I have no idea what a body bind is; the magic here works differently than back home. Like in America, I’m not sure my spells will fire. Luckily, the blond doesn’t know that. Under my threat, he releases Simon (and secures himself another moment of life. I may not have my magic here, but I still have my teeth).
“Salazar, Potter,” Draco interrupted. “I don’t need a whole laundry list of the people who love you. I get the picture. Your friends and family know, former childhood rivals don’t. So, come on, tell me the secret.”
Draco frowned, not sure why his proffered answer upset Harry so much. Shaking his head, he moved onto the next question. “Have you dated any men we might know about?”
“Darling,” She cooed, reaching across the table for his arm, which he allowed at the sound of contrition leaking into her voice. “It’s not character assassination if it’s true.”
In the excitement of their greeting, Harry crossed the living room to Draco’s side. “Is it hard to stay mad at her for appropriating our likenesses to have weird kinky sex because she loves your son so much?”
Suppressing what would have been an embarrassingly high-pitched squeal, Draco demanded, “Do you regularly leap out of invisibility cloaks to startle your guests, or is this a courtesy you’ve only extended to me?”
When the whimper turns into a pained moan, Draco releases himself from the stranglehold of his blankets with a sigh. He sits up and turns toward the source of the noise. It’s Harry Potter, bane of his existence, having a nightmare on the floor.
Convinced that his son’s presence wouldn’t be a burden, he agreed, “Sure, Scorpius. You can go.” Mother would be disappointed not to have the extra time with Scorpius, but Draco resolved to give her some grandson time on Saturday to make up for the last minute change.
“Luna Lovegood?” Draco should have been surprised, but after she wrote to him offering her forgiveness, unbidden, for the atrocities committed against her at his childhood home, he’d long since learned not to expect anything but the unexpected from his cousin.
Draco shook his head. But who was he kidding? If he were a wizarding house, he’d be charmed by Harry, too.
A flash of red tints Draco’s ears but it’s hard to catch it when he leans over to pull a handful of rocks from his bedside table.
You see,” She paused and Draco peeked through his fingers to confirm that, yup, based on her quirked lip and nearly empty glass, she was about to truly and royally fuck him. “
“Draco, you should really read the book,” Ron said, giving his best parental ‘it’s for your own good’ face.
“Oh, well, carry on then,” Hermione said, gathering up her documentlings as normal. “Draco, come see me when Miss Brown has finished delivering the verbal smackdown you so richly deserve.”
“Thank Astoria. She’s the one who gave me the revised recipe,” Draco said. “Her lab is really producing great work, thanks to their muggle pharmaceutical partners. With your help in the study, she’s hoping to roll out a public version in a few months.”
Thanks again for taking this journey with me. I may have said it before but this fic is 100% wish fulfillment, written only for myself, and I'm so glad you guys all wanted to see the same weird shit I did! Drarry is so fun to write but SnowBaz will always hold my heart.
Leaning in, Draco whispered, “You realize, of course, that he’s going to sell this story to the Prophet the instant we leave this bar.”
He grinned, following her into his office with a rediscovered pep to his step. “I already have a few ideas, if you want to hear them.”
To Scorpius’s credit, he appeared to be more awed than repulsed by the saggy, elderly house elf worshiping at the feet of his young master.
But instead of a fight, Potter laughed. A genuine, Potter-grade laugh. The kind Draco used to witness from a distance. The kind that was never directed at him. Never
He even enjoyed the work-life balance he’d carved out of his current job. His work never followed him out the office door and it didn’t keep him up late at night. Then again, if he found a more challenging job, he might be willing to give up some of his sleep and time at home.
With that in mind, Draco Malfoy invited Harry Potter to lunch. An invitation that Harry Potter accepted.
“I’m not promising anything,” He warned, one finger raised. “But,” And here, Draco thanked Merlin he’d been recently in the company of Gryffindors; he needed an injection of the bravery he’d been born without, “I might be persuaded to increase my time with Scorpius.”
with Potter.” Only Draco’s sentence took more time, and the extra words hung in the room like a bubble ready to pop.
actually done bad things (which he had), instead of begging them for a second chance (which he hadn’t deserved, but required anyway).
“Well, I didn’t actually grow up with parents at all, so,” Harry deadpanned, tearing off the head of one of the dino nuggets with his teeth.
“Really,” She drawled, crossing her arms across her chest. “Who’s this no one who makes you blush like—oh my stars.”
“He does, yes,” Draco said, with all the restraint he could muster. If he used any more of his restraint, he was definitely going to end this night burying his fingers in Potter’s hair.
Potter smirked, and joined Draco on the couch. The proximity was in no way unsettling, and Draco planned to deal with it in a decidedly grown up manner.
“That’s what I was finishing up this morning. Anyways, I took it to Kingsley and he loved it. Actually, he loved it so much he’s thinking about enacting the same thing. He asked us to put together a list of legislation you would work on, and then he’ll approve my hiring a new assistant, for both of us.”
Draco raised one eyebrow. “I’m not the one coming out inside the Honeymoon Suite of his schoolboy nemesis.”
Draco sent back unconvincing messages that he was fine, didn’t want company, and would let someone know if he needed anything. With a bottle of Malfoy Manor Pinot Gris and an Auror-themed romance novel, Draco hoped indulging in time-tested vices might start to ease the creeping loneliness of his newly empty flat.
Pulling out his own CL, Draco penned a reminder to himself about cancelling with Mother, noted the many missed messages from Hermione (she always failed to remember that, unlike her, he didn’t check his CL while out of the office). He made another note to ask Hermione about charming the notebooks so you could silence work messages while allowing personal ones to buzz, which would be an interesting project for her—.
He relaxed his jaw a fraction, then poured himself a cup. Pansy raised an eyebrow at his detente, which Draco ignored by flopping down at the table with a dramatic sigh and throwing Scorpius’s copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ face down at Pansy. Then, he waited.
Laughing despite himself, Draco draped an arm around Scorpius’s shoulders, nearly stopping himself when he caught the casual embrace. He looked down at Scorpius, who seemed unperturbed by the act.
At that lovely thought, Scorpius and Rose entered the kitchen, the thrill of a summer’s evening spent outdoors with new friends followed by a Molly Weasley dinner radiating off the two of them (as well as a not underwhelming scent of child sweat, which Draco tried to ignore).
Sorry for the delay between chapters 5 and 6. I got distracted by my own brain and wrote two full fics and started posting another WIP because why live in sanity? Anyways. All I want to do is write smut lately so hopefully no one is offended that I added some to this previously teen-rated fic.
Draco smirked. “I spelled cushioning charms onto his pants, transfigured a parachute into his jacket, and made him wear an invisible but well-protected helmet on his head.”
“Turns out Ginny wasn’t exactly faithful while I was gone.” Harry paused, then answered the question Draco didn’t ask. “Neville.”
“Well, uh,” I clear my throat. “I mostly just meant the tied up part.” I press my hips against his to prove my point.
“Exactly!” Draco exclaimed, as he stopped writing to review his list. “We could eliminate so much fear and anxiety by just having more conversations. More information. More trust and transparency.” He turned to Hermione, for a brief moment wanting to defend the novelty of this train of thought coming from Draco Malfoy’s mouth, but Hermione gave him a brief smirk, before waving him on.
He nodded, “I know, but we’d have a lengthy application process, possibly interviews, maybe even a contract. I’d also like to propose educational workshops, to help with reveals.”
“Of course you have the right,” Harry said, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “It’s never too late to fix the things we’ve broken.”
Harry ran his sweaty hands over the wool of his muggle trousers. Caught Malfoy doing the same on his formal Wizarding robes. Harry removed his jacket an hour ago, but finally succumbed to loosening his tie. Then, he rolled up the sleeves of his fitted white button-down. Malfoy watched with some expression of envy maybe, but he refused to allow one measure of comfort into his ensemble. For some sick reason, Harry found the obstinance endearing.
“I don’t have a good answer for you,” Draco smirked, wiping the self-satisfied grin right off Potter’s face. “But I believe it’s because sometimes you deserve to be Harry, and sometimes you piss me off enough to be Potter.”
“You guys can take my bed. I’ll spell the floor comfy.” When Simon opens his mouth to object, Harry silences him with a raised hand. “You’re our guests and I’ve slept on worse.”
Draco paused, not knowing how to respond. Harry continued, “You don’t have to share anything with me that’d make you uncomfortable. But I can’t help but be curious.”
“Oh,” Harry blinked, as if remembering he’d visited for a reason. “Pansy Owled me that the Prophet accepted our proposal.”
Turning his head, Draco opened his eyes and swallowed when he saw Harry’s returned-to-black hair. Searching for any excuse not to dig his hands back into that mane, now that it was once again the color of his Hogwarts fantasies, he smirked, “Was your short stint as a blonde too much fun for you?”
“Well, yeah, Draco,” Harry said, as if this was an obvious conclusion to draw: Hermione Granger-Weasley and Ronald Weasley talking about Draco Malfoy, often enough that Harry Potter, current and forever Wizarding World Saviour, called him
Later that night, after a horrible, awkward family dinner where Scorpius pretended he couldn’t hear or see his father, Draco sloshed the amber liquid of his Firewhiskey around its glass tumbler. In his haste to get away from his father, Scorpius had left his copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ on the coffee table in the living room. Draco stared at the book. Could a book glare? Could it mock you? Was it capable of judgement?
“Have I gained a new assistant without knowing it?” Hermione asked, her confusion growing when Lavender passed out Hermione’s large black coffee with a splash of coconut milk on Draco’s behalf.
“Well,” She said, flicking her eyes from person to person until she’d cast her gaze on everyone equally. “Mrs. Zabini, Mr. Potter, what an unexpected pleasure.”
“She wanted to try, despite it all. But I was so angry. It was the only emotion I could feel in the aftermath. I stupidly thought, ‘I’ll dump her, and she’ll realize what she’s missing, and then she’ll come crawling back to me.’ Only, what she was missing was better than what we’d had.”
“Well,” Mother said, looking around the room once more. “It appears I’ve stumbled into something, and I’d rather remain unaware of it. Scorpius, would you like to go to the park?” Though she spoke to Scorpius, her eyes caught Draco’s, and he nodded his approval.
Harry’s face relaxed. “That sounds like Hermione. Always trying to push the people in her life toward greatness, whether they seek it or not.” The rueful smile on Harry’s face indicated that he had often found himself on the receiving end of Hermione’s not-so-gentle shoving.
Smiling, once again unable to hide his pleasure, “I’m Hermione’s new Director of Legislative Affairs. I haven’t started, officially, but I’ll be helping her enact laws and promote her agenda.”
I?” Mother said, with more of a hint of sarcasm than Draco’d ever heard in her voice before. “How kind of you,” She added, leading the boy out of Draco’s flat, turning back at the door to give her son a brief wink before leaving.
“No,” Draco admitted. “It makes perfect sense. And if I could call Ginevra Weasley one thing, it’d be resilient.”
Harry grinned. “Well, I did have an invisibility cloak and an enchanted map of Hogwarts’ secret passageways. It’s possible I may have visited a time or two before I had permission.”
“I’ve been demoted to my maiden name?” She asked, her tone sharp but her hand trembling on the champagne flute.
“Just, you know, close your eyes and think,” Pansy cooed. Draco found his eyes closing as well. “If you had one night with Draco, and you could only have him one time, one way, would you rather take it like me, or give it like Blaise?”
In so many ways, he was no longer the boy from Hogwarts whose father bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team. After all, who’d have guessed he’d ever work for
Somehow, that broke the spell building between them. “You promised a personal revelation?” Draco sat up straight, which both improved his mental state and increased the space between them.
“Yes,” Draco’s grip on his wand faltered; that’d been one proposal he’d feared introducing. “You see, I think part of the reason pure-bloods fear muggle-borns is a watering down of wizarding heritage. I thought it might be nice to create an exchange of traditions. To help preserve our past while embracing our future.”
“Almost done,” Harry responded, spelling the last of the now clean pans into Draco’s cabinets. There was a world where Draco asked why dishes should be cleaned by hand but put away by magic, but this wasn’t one of them. “...And finished!” Harry clapped his hands together. “All right, Scorpius. Are you ready to see Hogsmeade?”
Sure, their Glamours and Transfigurations accomplish the same tasks as our spells, but they feel kilometers apart. In our world, magic is modern art: flashy, but with nuance and layers and context that changes person to person. Their magic is elemental. The body bind washed over me like a wave, the ropes grew like roots, Harry’s Glamour settled over my wings like a ray of sunshine, and Draco’s robe transfiguration felt like a soft breeze.
I guess I’ve been missing that bit of mystery since The Chosen One Debacle. That big ol’ adventure chase. Because when the strange man reflected in Baz’s and my bedroom mirror turned solid, I couldn’t help but reach out to touch.
Draco ignored Harry’s rolling eyes, and thanked Kreacher sincerely. Once the house elf left, Draco and Harry sat at the table, surveying the options.
“A bit,” Draco admitted, pouring wine in their waiting glasses. “But now I can hire someone else to manage her calendar.” Honestly, giving up that task was one of the biggest perks of his new job. He flashed back to scheduling time between Hermione, five department heads, seven ICW delegates, and the Minister, merely days before the winter holiday break. He shook the thought away with a shudder.
being tied up on a stranger’s bed in an alternate dimension, held captive by people whose capacity for evil we haven’t gauged, with no idea how to get home?” He finishes his statement with a piercing glare.
He wandered the hallways, adjusting to the silence of his flat. Not that Scorpius had added much to the ambient noise. Still, Draco felt a stale quiet that made him feel empty deep inside. How could one person, and such a tiny one at that, take up so much space?
Pity would be a welcome reflection in those green eyes. Instead, Draco saw the fear of recognition that painfully reminded him of that day in the Manor; the day when a stinging hex and a small lie changed the course of Draco’s life.
with a piece. Normally, I end a story with some semblance of where the characters are going, and an itch to keep telling their tale. This feels really wrapped up to me, and there's a lot of peace with that feeling.
A crowd of rambunctious 20-year-olds piled into the bar, filling up the empty seats with shouts and laughter. Draco ran his hands through his hair, tousling it from its normally immaculate state. Eyeing the setting sun, he said, “Perhaps we should go home. It’s been a long day, and I could use the solitude.”
“Hmm?” He answered, looking back at the two staring faces of his friends. “Oh, sorry. Did you remember I was here?”
They split the Italian Draco’d purchased: eggplant parmesan for Harry, chicken florentine for Draco. Then, they negotiated sides, and Draco allowed Harry the extra garlic roll (apparently he didn’t need to be a wizarding house to be charmed by Harry, after all). Harry had pulled a bottle of pinot noir from the Black cellars, and poured generous glasses.
Harry smiled. “If you’re anything like now, I definitely would have noticed you. Admired you, even.”
Hermione shook her head vehemently. “Even if he had asked, I would have said no, but he trusts my judgement. The job is yours, if you want it.”
“Never asked,” Harry smiles. “Oh! We ought to take you to Honeyduke’s this weekend. They have blood-flavored lollipops they sell just for vampires.”
His chest heaved with the effort. It occurred to Draco that he’d been rubbing his left arm as he finished his rant. He crossed his arms in front of his chest.
The lift dinged, and two Aurors joined them. Distracted by the newcomers, Lavender handed Draco the hangover potion without further delay. He downed it, shuddered, and chased the foul potion with another sip of coffee. The Aurors gave him knowing glances, one judgmental and the other sympathetic. Draco smiled at the sympathetic one.
Hermione leapt off the couch. “Well then, no sense in dallying when my husband needs me. I’ll just leave you two to, um.” She stared at the mess in her living room: Draco, looking indignant and slightly drunk on the couch, Potter, seeming confused but somehow amused by the turn of events, her three-year-old son, licking a cork duck like a popsicle. “Harry, you said you were ready to make a decision? Why don’t you talk about that with Draco? And, Draco? Listen to Harry.” She sprinted to the kitchen. Hugo looked up at her departure, gave the cork one last lick, then dropped it as he waddled out of the room.
“It sounds like you were perfect together,” Draco said, taking a sip of wine, the jealousy winning out in his heart though luckily not in his tone. “What happened?”
Hermione smiled. “Admittedly, Dumbledore’s explanation to my parents was somewhat lacking in detail. I’ll never forget the looks on my parents’ faces when I came back after coming of age and could do magic in the house. I swear, they had no idea what they’d gotten into.”
And immediately regretted it. Pansy and Blaise turned to each other with mirrored expressions of glee. “Pottah!” They shouted in unison.
But Harry ignored the olive branch, though he did help himself to a pitiful slump on Draco’s couch. “I’ve been doing this for years because I hate Flooing so much. I always just redo the wards when I leave. No one’s ever complained before.” His small, etiquette-oblivious world appeared to have been fully rocked.
“Hermione, I’m ready to make a decision—” He started, before looking up to realize Hermione wasn’t alone.
Harry’s face fell, and Draco felt compelled to lighten it again. “Don’t give me that kicked-crup face, Potter. I only meant I’m
There’s a good chance Draco’s going to suggest to Hermione that their first joint legislative project should be to outlaw the broad grin this confession brought to Harry’s face.
“Really,” Blaise drawled, ignoring his wife’s rude comment and Harry’s flushed face. “You’re about to witness quite the entertainment. Draco-rants are rare, and beautiful.”
Releasing Simon with a sigh, I lean back on my hands. I want to say, ‘It’s not my fault you two can’t get your act together,’ but it’s not my place.
“Right,” Harry nodded back. “I never intended the break to be permanent.” He laughed. “Seems a bit shit now, to think I had the right to press ‘pause’ on our relationship without first consulting her, but I knew our connection would put her in danger. To be fair, she didn’t really fight me on it. She knew I had a mission, even if she didn’t know what the mission was, and she wanted me to be successful.”
“As much as I couldn’t deny it, I wasn’t comfortable with liking men at all,” Harry said. “My muggle caretakers growing up… well, they weren’t the most enlightened people. Honestly, it was just a few solid months of self-loathing and self-destructive patterns.”
The Headmistress leans back in her chair with a sigh. “You’ll have to forgive Mr Potter. Up until now, he has had an undeserved and inappropriately adult role placed on him. Not unlike the one you were forced to play, Mr Snow, if I can be so presumptuous. But he is a good man. You are lucky to have found yourself in his bedroom, of all possibilities.”
Astoria fixed him with a probing gaze, then leaned over to take his hand in hers. “I’m really proud of you, Draco. You’ve come a long way from the man who spent his midday break cowering in the Ministry Owlery, too afraid to eat lunch in the cafeteria.”
Then, Harry’s face exploded into a smile and he wrapped his muscular arms around Draco. “Thanks,” He whispered, his hot breath sending shivers down Draco’s spine.
At lunchtime, Draco Apparated to the coordinates Harry sent, arriving in the shade of a tree among a stretch of muggle townhomes. Looking up and down the street, Draco tried to determine where exactly he’d found himself, when Harry suddenly appeared beside him, whipping off that damnable invisibility cloak of which he was so fond.
“Sorry, I’ve been trying to figure out why one glass of wine was affecting me so deeply, and I just remembered I didn’t eat lunch.” Draco swallowed. “So, you see, mystery solved.”
“How Blaise and G-Ginny knew each other.” Harry hoped the crack in his voice at Ginny’s name went unnoticed. The way Malfoy downed his ouzo after Harry’s statement left him with the impression that Malfoy had fallen too deep in his own sorrow to notice Harry’s.
Blaise shook his head, his normally dark skin pale and grey. “I read the book twice, and there was nothing like that…” In a whisper, “Are you saying that really happened?”
, Hermoine. It’s the ethics! It’s the morality! It’s putting a golden spin on an evil man and the evil men who followed him!”
At 9:58, he could no longer stand it. With a dramatic flourish, he dropped a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and called out her address.
Draco dropped his pointing hand, not willing to continue exerting the effort. “I could befriend a thousand werewolves, apologize a million times, and none of that would ever erase what I’ve done. Only I know the weight of my mistakes and I’d never inflict that on my son.”
Harry shrugged. “I may or may not have bribed one of the employees to give me a heads up whenever a story about me is going to hit.”
Scorpius’s eyes dropped. So did Draco’s heart. But he could continue being brave. For himself. For Scorpius.
“Um, Hermione? Not that I mind, but you didn’t tell me you had company,” Potter said, running his hands through that awful rats nest on his head he called hair. Draco ignored how badly he wanted to touch it. Thirteen years was not nearly long enough to erase the fact that Potter was, and continued to be, stupidly attractive. Draco wondered where all of the wine in his glass had gone.
“I don’t care; I need to know,” Draco pouted, convinced now that it would, in fact, be a very boring answer. What a waste of his Slytherin impulses.
Harry smirked, pushing more confidence into the act than he felt. “It’s Harry, remember?” He corrected. Then, when the lift doors opened to the top floor, “Besides, I’ve never minded what they print about me, when it’s been the truth.”
And when dawn rose on Sunday morning on an unslept bed and an increasingly unhinged Draco Malfoy, it was all he could do not to storm the Floo to Pansy’s.
With a wave of her wand, she conjures two shiny, gold bells and hands them to us. “If you need anything, please ring. Someone will come at a moment's notice to help.” She gives them another smile. “Welcome to Hogwarts. I hope you will enjoy your stay, and that it is as brief as we can manage. Oh, and the password is, ‘Unity’.”
“So. What to do with you, two?” She leans back in her chair, waiting. “I do not suppose you would want to attend class with Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy?”
“No!” Draco shouted, a bit too loud for the indoors. “No, I’d like to keep my, uh, big boy moves where they are.”
It shouldn’t affect him so deeply, the way Harry remained still under Draco’s explorations. Pliant. As if waiting, but for what? Still, the control was heady. Having Harry, here, under Draco’s spell. He drew in a deep breath, then exhaled against the now damp skin of Harry’s neck.
Loud enough so the bartender could hear him, “All things considered, Draco, I really think you ought to call me Harry.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Draco called out half-heartedly as Harry cleaned the pans and dishes by hand. He’d never admit it, but Draco didn’t actually want Harry to stop cleaning, even if he played muggle better than Draco ever could.
Harry spells their cups clean and sets the pint glasses aside from now. Malfoy transfigures the shot glasses into tumblers. Pouring a few fingers of Firewhiskey for each of them, Harry considers Baz’s prompt.
Leaning in, Draco continued. “Yes, she said that the way the main character had been described... Well, she said that he sounded like quite the dish.” He leaned back, mission accomplished.
,” Harry sighed and reached over the table, swiping a bit of beer foam off the tip of Draco’s nose. Then, he sucked the offending finger into his mouth.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Are you a complete moron today or have you also forgotten, in addition to the existence of muggle bars, that you are, in fact, a wizard?”
By now, their plates were clear, the bottle of wine almost empty. Harry summoned another bottle, and Draco welcomed the additional alcohol as Harry continued to weave his sad story.
Harry interrupted Draco’s rambling with a kiss. “They’ll finally see me, for who I am, with someone that I care about.”
“Anyway, I couldn’t be happier for her. Although, I do think it’s funny that we broke up because I wanted a family, but now she’s married and here I am. Still single.” He shook his head, as if not actually finding the thought all that funny. “But, what about you? What skeletons are in Draco Malfoy’s closet?”
Rose barely registered their arrival, but Draco could tell Scorpius tracked their movement from the moment they stepped into the room, even though he hadn’t moved his head a millimeter from the game he and Rose were playing. It only took about five minutes before Scorpius cracked and sauntered over to Potter.
A few minutes before their scheduled meeting time, he arrived at their favorite Thai restaurant, a muggle place around the corner from the Ministry. Seated comfortably in a booth with a view to the front door, he watched Hermoine’s hurried arrival. The egg piece was gone from her hair (Draco’d removed it before she’d met with the Minister), but Hermione had newly acquired ink marks all over her hands and forearms.
,” He sighed. “Tell me about this bingo.” At least his outings at The Pub meant he understood the general game, if not the point of this Slytherin-specific version.
He walks over and peeks through the drapes. “I’m setting a silencing spell. It’ll hold as long as the curtains remain closed. So. Uh. Goodnight.”
Harry’s eyes widen. He wouldn’t be the first to pity me, but it stings a bit. Coming from him. “I didn’t know who my parents were,” I explain.
,” He added, though at the moment he felt like taking back any expressive face he’d ever gifted her.
“Lavender said the same thing,” Draco said. It took him a second to realize what he’d inadvertently done, and less than a second to turn the tables and revel in the awkwardness he’d introduced to the table: Hermoine trying not to look petty, Ron trying not to look guilty. Draco pressed his luck. If he was going to be forced to talk about this book, he might as well have some fun with it. “In fact, she thought the main character sounded kind of steamy.”
“Oh, well,” Draco paused, then noticed Harry’s horrified expression. “Oh! No. No, I don’t plan on quitting. In fact, quite the opposite. You see, for the past year or so I’ve been getting quite a few job offers, and I found out today that Hermione was behind it.”
“Oh Harry,” Draco drawled. “Two inches makes a world of difference.” To which Harry flushed beautifully, as expected.
“Oh no, Draco. This one’s for you,” Hermione winked, pausing outside her office door to switch coffees with Draco. “I figured you’d earned it, given your two big boy moves last night.” She looked him up and down, catching Draco’s leg jiggle before he had time to still it. “Unless you want to take it back?”
“Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said, striding toward her. “It’s so good to see you again.” Then, took her hand and kissed it in greeting.
Treasure stopped by the table again, hands full of bingo cards. He set them on the table and, with a wink, pulled out his wand and slyly muttered an incantation at both of their cups. “There,” He said, a satisfied grin on his face. “That’ll keep you boys tapped up for the duration of the show.” Then, he sashayed away.
, Potter?” Draco took another sip while watching Harry make increasingly frantic gestures at his own face. “Merlin, use your words. Whatever is the matter with you?”
The plot accelerates. Harry makes his debut. Hermione starts to embrace her inner Slytherin. Scorpius needs to know how his father knows Harry Potter. Draco just wants to drink his wine in peace.
Scorpius looked Harry up and down, giving him a very obvious but still Narcissa-esque scan of judgement. He completed the act with a nod; like there was a world where Scorpius
This answer both pleased and displeased Draco. So, he did what he always did: he focused on the bad part. “How come you didn’t want to hang out with me?” Draco was convinced he didn’t sound petulant at all in asking the question.
“Heathen,” Draco smiled, knowing Harry would see right through any attempt to feign disgust. “Let’s start with a few opening volleys.” He rolled his shoulders and sat up straight, trying to slip into the role of reporter.
“Mmm,” Harry hummed. “Definitely yes.” He leaned over the table, a wicked gleam in his eyes. “But I do like to live a bit dangerously.”
Plus, unlike our world, their magic seems limitless. Is their magic not something that can run out? Circe, what would the Mage say? (Scratch that; I really don’t care).
Before Draco could respond in kind, a hand gripped his shoulder. “Did you pay for those drinks?” A familiar voice demanded.
“I told you, Story. I’m happy for you. You don’t have to convince me; if he’s your one, I’ll stand by whatever decisions you need to make.”
The looks of joy fell from Blaise’s and Pansy’s faces. Turns out, the Zabinis had found their line, and it was mocking Draco’s attempts to become a better father.
“Hmm. Technically, I’m Master of Death, you know,” Harry said, licking a spoonful of pudding in a most obscene manner.
Hermione broke the silence first. “I should have known you were in an existential crisis. You only file when you’re trying to work something out.”
“I know now that I could have leaned on them,” Harry continued. “But at the time it already felt like I’d taken so much of them. Their last year at Hogwarts. Nearly their lives. On the back of all of the other deaths in my name…”
Harry elbowed Draco. “I’m pretty sure he cooked every recipe from Julia Child’s ‘Mastering the Art of French Cooking’ in order to impress your son.”
Surprise! Early chapter. Surprise! Epilogue on its way. Ended up with more content than I expected, so yay? I mean, did you think I was going to finish this story without forcing Harry to attend his own Coming Out Ball?
They did as commanded, their eyes drifting over mismatched chairs, wobbly tables, a slightly-slanted stage, and lighting that faded from too bright to too dark throughout the bar.
Harry shifted his gaze to his feet. Draco’s pondering of this uncharacteristic shy display was interrupted by a tug on his sleeve.
“Never,” Draco waved his hand in the air. “As I said, always a pleasure.” To the chagrin of his fifteen-year-old self, he meant it.
It wasn’t Imperio that spurred the movement. No, he knew what that felt like. Still, he saw his hand move on someone else’s order other than his own.
She crumpled up a spare strip of parchment and chunked it at his head, which he dodged easily. If he were 10 years younger, he’d claim Seeker skills, but it’d been ages since he played and by now his muscle memory came mostly from dodging Hermione’s parchment balls rather than bludgers.
When their Headmistress pulls us by our metaphorical ears to her office, I’m again floored by their brand of magic. So is Simon, who watches Pranking Parkinson
“Potter,” She breathed. “I’m so glad you asked, and, to reward your curiosity, I’m going to let you choose. Although, you should keep in mind that Blaise and I keep our traditional ‘positions’ when Polyjuiced into other genders. If you know what I mean.”
Which was not something that should make him grin this wide, especially with Pansy in the room. Especially since this was Pansy and she knew Draco, and fuck. The look on
“Ooh, I love a good Malfoy-rant,” Ron said, rubbing his hands together. “What’s on the agenda today?”
“Well, maybe. We hadn’t seen each other in quite some time before last night.” Again, Draco reached into his heart and pulled out a bleeding thread. “But I hope we’ll be friends. I hope he forgives me. For my mistakes.”
“So,” He started. “You have news?” Only after he finished his inquiry did he take his first bite. Delivery food aside, he couldn’t erase all his Malfoy breeding.
“But he’s committed to his work, and he’s kind. He knows about Scorpius, and you. It’s not his plan to get in the way. He has his own kids, actually. Two daughters, aged three and five. And he’s
Harry shook his head, his own urge to laugh stifled. “I really don’t think you do.” Draco scoffed, and Harry scowled. “Get your ass back in bed.”
They found a decent spot for the show, close enough to see the stage but far enough to avoid being in the spotlight. It may also have been strategically within the pathway the night’s talent had to take to reach the stage.
Ron stood to leave, giving his wife another kiss on her cheek. “I’ve gotta get back to the store. See you at home.” When he reached the restaurant door, he turned back and yelled, “Love you!” The whole restaurant looked up at the public declaration; it was hard to ignore it.
lost so many people. And Ginny? I mean, she lost Fred. They were really close, you know. I think,” He ran a hand through his hair. “I think she expected a hero to return, and that’s not who I was at the end.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “So it’s serious. I’ll need to meet him, of course,” He commanded, picking up the remaining egg roll to use for emphasis, before disappearing it down his throat.
Draco pulled back from Scorpius’s embrace, leaving his hands on the boy's shoulders. “You know I love you, right?”
Draco scoffed. “You’ll need my help with more than a statement, Potter. I expect you’ll need press conference prepping, and an entire new wardrobe as well.”
Ten years ago, maybe even five, Draco might have been able to keep the righteous anger flowing. But he’d been up all night. And there was a pot of coffee on…
“They can write the books when we’re done making history.” Hermione waved her hand in the air, dismissing the idea she’d ever need the help of a Ravenclaw.
Draco closed his eyes and laid the book back down on the table. He covered it briefly with his hand, then slid the novel across the table. He opened his eyes and dared to look where he couldn’t before.
Harry leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms. The movement sparked its own defensive reaction in Draco.
Draco briefly rested his hand on Harry’s, not daring to meet his gaze. “I guess I should know that better than anymore. Having broken so many things.”
He looked both ways down the hallway, then pulled her into his office. “Ok, but you can’t tell anyone.”
“She’s the reason I came to terms with my sexuality, too. She’s the first person I told. One night, after a particularly vivid dream, I confessed. She was wonderful about it. Too wonderful, maybe,” Harry laughed. “She took me out to gay bars, and, um.” Harry blushed. “We’d take home men together. She made me see it as something beautiful, not shameful.”
“Well, it’s a muggle phrase. Basically, it means feeling like you’ve accidentally ended up somewhere you don’t belong. That you’ve misrepresented yourself as someone with more skills than you actually have. In short, you feel like a fraud,” Hermione explained.
“Your guy’s new, he didn’t know the rules,” Draco drawled, leaning back to smile. “Please don’t fire him. He’s very cute.”
Draco could think of a lot of people, himself included, who might disagree. But he ceded the point, “Right, who’d want that?”
“No,” Draco objected. Then amended, “Well, half of it wallowing in wine, the other half at a drag show. Though, wine was involved there, as well.”
Though Draco couldn’t see the broad width of Harry’s smile, he hoped the resulting hug would embody it. “Come with me.”
Draco thought. But he ceded the point. It was a good one, and Draco appreciated that Hermione sometimes forgot the time when everyone on the right side of the war, and not a small number on the wrong, rooted for Draco Malfoy to fail.
He rolled his eyes. “Salazar, Granger-Weasley. I consent to this hug. Now come over here and mother me properly.”
Harry and Draco (finally) get down to some press conference prep. Also, some fun backstory is revealed.
Entering his living room, he rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands. Despite his anguish, no tears would come. His CL buzzed in his pocket, and he silenced it. Then, he blocked his Floo against everyone except Astoria. That was one door he wouldn’t close today.
Before Draco could stop himself (he’d lost all impulse control for the night, burned it all up in the first five minutes of trying not to touch Harry’s hair), he reached out to hold Harry’s wrist. “It’s ok that you didn’t consider that; it’s why I told you.” Draco smiled and shook his head at the expression on Harry’s face, reading its intention easily. “If you knew that was a factor, you’d have come out ages ago, wouldn’t you?”
“Except you just casually dropped your orphan status into a complaint session where I’m upset I’m not more interested in all the jobs I keep getting offered,” Draco said. “If I kept on, I’d be the most insensitive person in the world. And, well, I’ve been that, and I’d prefer not to regress today.”
“I think I remember reading about that in the Prophet.” What Draco really remembered was how, even blurry with some sort of Photograph-Me-Not charm, Harry looked handsome.
“Yes, well, as Pansy implied I tend to ration my facial expressions,” Draco replied, and he could just bet the tips of his ears had turned red. “Glad to see the sacrifice has paid off.”
Draco’s cheery mood slipped for a moment as he stood outside his Floo, take-out from Frankie’s in hand. Harry’s CL flirting had reassured Draco somewhat; he didn’t expect there to be much fallout from their strange outing to the Leaky. Still, Draco could hardly be blamed for facing their meeting with a bit of reticence.
Catching Harry’s frown, Draco crossed the room to his perch on Harry’s reclining chair. He squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “You’ll be fine, I promise.”
“Well, you’re right that I’m not going to tell you about my project, I can’t go back in time to force the entirety of Wizarding Great Britain to head to Greece, and I’ve had enough mind healing to know I’d prefer to manage my own orphan-related trauma and not have people walk on eggshells around me because of it.” Harry picked a bowl of pudding for his dessert. “I guess that leaves us with only one problem to solve: why doesn’t Draco Malfoy want to be king anymore?”
“Now,” Hermoine turned her intense gaze on Draco, shifting suddenly from lovestruck wife to on-a-mission Gryffindor. “You have Scorpius this week, right?”
Draco looked at Harry, needing guidance for some reason. Harry provided, “Apparently Rose has been begging to see Scorpius for days. She’s the spitting image of Hermoine; I wouldn’t dare deny her something she wanted this badly.”
“Here,” Draco said, pulling out a chair, pushing down his emotions to where they couldn’t overwhelm him. “Have some breakfast. There’s plenty left over.”
Why did I ever believe Simon could avoid a mystery? He’s been friends with Bunce for far too long to walk away from any problem that may need his help solving.
Harry continued, “Plus she never took on my burdens, not like Ron and Hermione would. Sometimes, they took my pain too personally. Like it was Ron’s fault for letting me date Ginny, or Hermione’s fault for not helping find the Horcruxes sooner. But Luna? She just held my hand, told me she was sorry for my pain, and helped me move on.
Hermione tapped her finger against her chin. “Yes, but change the world into what? Perhaps we need a Hufflepuff in there to keep us grounded.”
“No. Not you, too!” Draco closed his eyes and sighed. Re-opening them, “I thought I’d at least be safe with you two.”
“One can only wonder, Potter, why you continue to underestimate me so?” Draco drawled, his hand lightly resting on Harry’s shoulder, until Draco noticed and pulled it away.
He cursed himself. Laid aside for so many years, Draco’s best sword still knew exactly how to pierce the weakest part of Harry’s armour.
“They don’t call him the Saviour for nothing,” Draco drawled. “The man hasn’t met a cause he didn’t want to champion.”
I watch my love hit the floor and before I can stop myself I have the blond man we’ve watched (and pitied) up against the wall.
“I didn’t know he was my father at the time. But I killed him all the same.” I pause and Baz finds my hand with his. Tightens. “All I did was ask that he stop hurting me. And it killed him.”
I sigh. “Fine. Let’s get this over with.” I push Simon up against the headboard and wiggle my way into his lap. Pushing his hands into my hair, I command him to, “Untangle.”
We spent nearly a week watching our strange mirror counterparts before joining them on the other side. I should be grateful we lasted
Also also, is anyone still pretending to care about The Wrong Sider anymore? Don't worry, it'll make a come back in a chapter or two.
Baz’s eyebrows furrow, reflected in the mirror. “How come?” He takes the black spade tip between his index finger and thumb, stroking gently.
“The current rules only allow sharing our world with muggles if we’re in intimate relationships. I think we should extend to platonic ones as well.”
“Of course,” Mother said, kneeling down to take her grandson in her arms. “I’m always here for you, you only have to ask.”
She gave him a knowing stare. “I suppose for some people that’s especially true.” Then, she sipped her tea. “But even though I had Harry’s, I needed my own approval to feel truly ready for the job. So I put myself on trial in my mind and cross-examined myself until I felt objectively sure I would accomplish great things.”
Note: I've finally written an end chapter on this story, so only two more chapters to go! I've been waiting for the next two main events for so long now, it's exciting to almost be finished.
The boys play a drinking game, Baz and Simon reveal their enemies-to-lovers backstory, and no Draco's not taking notes why do you ask that?
“The…” Draco flicked back and forth between them, not seeing any recognition. He turned to Harry, his normally expressive face a wall of stone.
“I’m sorry, my lovely,” He said, allowing her to perch on his shoulder while he headed to the kitchen for some owl treats. “But your owner is a real bitch with bad timing.”
Draco’s eyes flicked to Harry’s in a heartbeat, but instead of invitation they held hostility. “You don’t mean that.”
