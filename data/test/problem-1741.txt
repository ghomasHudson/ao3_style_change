He thinks he was right after all. Malfoy was indeed
“Oh, it’s you,” Draco says, blinking up at Potter.
“Open sesame,” Remus says to the Luggage, and it obligingly unzips itself and flips itself open. He picks out his flannel PJs and his toothbrush, and when he comes back out of the bathroom, Sirius is already changed and in bed. He’s turned down part of the blankets invitingly, smiling winningly at Remus as he pats the spot on the bed next to him.
Harry chuckles. “Yes. Well then,” he says, knocking on the dungeon walls. “We’re here. So.”
The scent hits him again, stronger now that he’s standing right in front of the cauldrons, and he breathes in deeply, trying to identify what it is that he’s smelling. For a long moment there’s nothing but the quiet hiss of the flames as the potion simmers.
“I would
It comes uncomfortably close to the truth, but Harry plays it off. “Right,” he says, snorting again in an attempt to cover up how his heart beats a little quicker.
Potter sighs at that, running a frustrated hand through his messy hair. He knows as well as Draco does how the Ministry works. All the Departments that produce flashy press and political goodwill get almost unlimited funding, while the smaller divisions that deal with issues that the majority of the general public aren’t bothered with tend to get overlooked and ignored.
? You’re the one who just said you wouldn’t—with me. You said that it was all the potion, and I don’t understand what you want!"
For a panicked second he tries to remember what Snape taught him about Legilimency and Occlumency, but those lessons were almost a decade ago and nothing comes to mind. He tries to empty his head, but it’s already filled with panicked internal screaming, and he’s pretty sure if Malfoy actually were rooting around in there, he would know all of Harry’s deepest, darkest secrets by now.
“It strains our diplomatic ties with our allies!” Harry had said heatedly, but strength of conviction alone that Malfoy was
,” with emphasis.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Grimster says. He flips a page of his book.
“Thanks,” Potter says suddenly, and Draco blinks at the unexpected change.
There’s silence after that, a silence that stretches uncomfortably long until Cheng Wu abruptly changes the topic, and talks about the latest potion enhancing scandal in the Asian Quidditch League. Potter stays unhappily quiet, but Draco grateful takes up the mantle, talking cheerily as they eat their food. By the time they all finish their meals, Potter’s sufficiently recovered enough to join back in on the conversation, and they walk back to the Ministry together, chatting companionably away. Potter bids the both of them farewell by the lifts, a strange light in his eye, and Draco’s relieved that they part on relatively good terms.
“Mhmm,” Harry says absently.
"You’re amazing," he says, still breathless, and reaches for Potter’s jeans.
It had
“What do you mean?” Harry says, surprised. It had never occurred to him to ask where Malfoy had picked up all the different Portraits, although he had wondered at the seemingly mishmash of the different time periods and styles of painting.
"Robards said no," Potter says by way of a greeting when he spots Draco coming in through the doors. "He said, and I quote, ‘that we’ve got enough of our own problems to worry about, they should just be grateful we stepped in last night.’"
, it feels like he’s constantly got coffee on his mind. He smells roasted coffee beans everywhere he goes, even when he’s deep underground in the musty basement of the Ministry packing away his files. It happens all week, and it drives him crazy to the point where he asks for a Healer to check if he’s been Cursed. The Healer unhelpfully pronounces him in the pink of health and sends him on his way.
"Nice to know your manners haven’t improved the slightest, Malfoy," she shoots back, just as Potter slips back into the room, looking both pleased and nervous. He stops when he sees Draco and Hannah glaring at each other, and Cheng Wu coughing and laughing at the same time.
“Well?” Malfoy says once Harry opens his eyes again.
apologising to
“Remind me again why we let the Hufflepuffs host this year’s Christmas party,” Draco says, which is when Pansy pops up next to them and says, “did you
“Oh. You’re welcome. How did you come by the dragon anyway?”
Potter snorts, amusement dancing in his eyes. “Why would Nott kill you?”
“Let it dry, and then chuck it in the wash. A good bit of old-fashioned detergent should take care of any stains.” Malfoy’s already turned away with a beaker in hand, and has started placing handfuls of the lavender and white roses in the Amortentia. He fusses over the placement of the flowers until he’s satisfied with the arrangement, and Harry watches him and forgets that he’s supposed to do the same with the dried petals.
The room, when they find it, is old and shabby. The lights are dim, and the wallpaper’s peeling. But that’s not the biggest problem-
Potter smiles again, a quick flash of teeth, before his mouth envelopes Draco’s cock in hot, wet heat. Draco’s head falls back against the cupboard with a thump, his mouth open in a soundless moan as Potter deep throats him in one smooth motion, his lips sliding down the entire length of Draco’s cock, until Potter’s nose is pressed against Draco’s stomach. Potter pulls back slowly, deliberately, until Draco's cock slips out of Potter’s hot mouth with a wet plop.
“It tastes funny,” Harry insists, giggling madly at his own joke. He wipes tears of laughter out of his eyes. “Grimster, I would like you to ring for the manager, please. Especially if that manager is Malfoy.”
"You’re brilliant," Potter says, awe in his voice, and Draco can’t stop himself as he leans in again, as he captures Potter’s mouth in another kiss. He doesn’t know whether he’s doing it because of the potion, or because he wants to, and he thinks that maybe it doesn’t matter, as long as he can have this moment: Potter holding him, Potter’s hands on him, gentle and tender like Potter’s handling a lover instead of–of whatever this is.
?" Potter says, staring at Cheng Wu in a manner that could almost be called unfriendly, at the same time that Draco says, "Erm, we’re not–we’re–we work together. In the same Ministry."
He doesn’t expect to see Potter again, so it’s something of a surprise when he comes in early the next day, only to find Potter waiting for him at his desk again. Potter’s got a blank expression on his face, twirling one of Draco’s quills idly between his fingers as he stares out at the empty office.
“That’s alright. I’m already here. What do you need help with?”
There’s a lot of work to be done and Harry throws himself into it. It’s menial, repetitive labour, and just the thing to take his mind off the way Malfoy touches his arm when he squeezes past Harry, or the way Malfoy’s arse looks in his jeans when he bends over to grab a handful of petals from the overflowing sacks on the floor.
future drink of choice before every job interview or major presentation. It’s taken me ages to get the Ministry to grant us a license to brew a Restricted Potion like this; I only got the final approval yesterday. It’s one of the more dangerous potions, this one, because the base of the potion is so volatile.”
“I’m a simple man,” Harry says, shrugging. “I call it as I see it. And that’s red.
It’s a large, airy store, and the tinkle of the bell when they push open the door is completely drowned by a wave of screeching, yeowling, and hooting. A harassed looking clerk comes up to them, wearing oven mitts and clutching a large, struggling cat who clearly does not want to be held. He directs them down an aisle when Harry explains about the collar, the dragon standing regally on Draco’s shoulder the whole time. Its wings are extended to the fullest as it eyes the rest of the animals in the store disdainfully, turning its head to glare as they go past, but none of the animals take any notice of it.
“Will you come with me to the broom shed? There’s something I want to show you.” Potter’s eyes are gleaming, and he looks excited.
“Then I am forced to leave bad feedback!” Harry declares, and bursts into hysterical laughter. It’s not the most useful threat, but it’s the only one that he can think of right now in his state of temporary madness.
"Won’t say no to that," Potter says, his face brightening. Draco gets Potter another cup to go, and make their slow way back to the Ministry, still talking shop.
“It’s a stupid name!” Harry guffaws. No one pays him any attention.
"That’s probably for me," Potter says, and casually destroys it with a quick wordless
Fossey doesn’t quite believe it until Robards grumpily sends over the paperwork for her to sign off on. Potter’s paycheck is still coming out of the Aurors’ departmental budget, and Fossey is over the moon about that. She assigns him to Draco’s case, and Potter promptly takes over Cheng Wu’s vacant desk.
That triggers a memory of something Malfoy said, and Harry asks curiously, “What did you mean when you called the Manor a traitor earlier?”
Potter nods to the warehouse directly in front of them. "The exhibits are in there. They must have dumped them and left."
They maneuver Malfoy back onto the bench and Harry gingerly runs a hand over Malfoy’s left shoulder to check for bumps. It doesn’t escape his notice how Malfoy goes quiet and still under him, body tense against his touch.
.) “Delighted to,” he says, “when shall I drop by?”
“Or lunch, if you want. I’m flexible,” Potter says.
late,” he sniffs, eyeing Harry’s outfit as they set off, before muttering, “not that you’d know anything about it.”
. And then you turned down my offer of friendship, so naturally I had to declare you my lifelong nemesis. Although, look at how well that worked out.”
“What in the seven hells of damnation,” Malfoy says, staring.
“Life skills,” Malfoy had said, a terrifying glint in his eyes, and made Aiden duel Harry until Aiden was flushed and sweaty and about to drop from exhaustion. Harry had gone easy on him too, had pulled his punches and held back on his casting.
It doesn’t escape his attention that this is the most civil that he and Harry have ever been with each other, and he’s vaguely surprised to find that he’s actually having a decent time. Distantly, he wonders what it would have been like if they had started out friends instead of enemies in different houses.
“Well, getting a shower sometime today would be good, yes,” Malfoy drawls, and it’s not fair that he looks vaguely amused while Harry’s suddenly flustered at the idea of Malfoy and too much skin. “And here is fine. It’s as empty as it’ll ever be.”
“I know
“Your hair’s still wet.” Harry points out the obvious.
“Enjoy,” Graham says monotonously as he slides a mug over the counter to Harry. He doesn’t even bother ringing Harry up, just goes back to his book and ignores the money that Harry leaves on the counter.
Potter doesn’t say anything else other than to cast another wordless
Malfoy says nothing as he leads Harry into the back room and past the wards into the secret room. Harry’s heart is pounding double time, and he isn’t sure if it’s because of what he drank, or because he’s finally getting past the velvet ropes and stepping foot into… a laboratory.
“I will
? Potter, have you forgotten that we are
, and now it’s ‘oh, the potion made me do it’?
Potter’s babbling gives way to a faint moan as Draco’s hand slides up the length of Potter’s cock until he’s thumbing the tip, stroking Potter in the same way that Potter’s stroking his hips. Everything seems to fall away, the world constricting until it’s just Draco’s hand on Potter’s cock, slowly stroking him, Potter’s cock leaking precome, and Potter’s still got his hands around Draco’s hips, his fingers digging into Draco’s hip bones as Draco picks up the pace, his hand twisting on the upstroke, Potter moaning straight into his ear.
Potter pulls off just long enough to say, "Keep talking dirty, Draco, please," and then goes back to sucking. He looks up from under a layer of hair that falls into his eyes, his lips wet and tight around Draco’s cock, and Draco abruptly blows out his breath in a noisy moan at the sight.
Draco puts the apple down on the table, right next to Harry’s hand, and turns to walk away. Except that Harry says, “wait, you
Draco stops, swaying where he stands, and Harry takes two quick strides and is immediately by Draco’s side, his heart pounding. He tries to be discreet, because he knows Draco hates drawing attention whenever it happens.
Harry’s nursing a cut on the fleshy part of his palm where the dragon’s sharp teeth have sliced through skin. Draco rolls his eyes, slipping his wand out of his robes as he reaches over to take Harry’s hand and casts a basic healing spell. The bleeding stops immediately, the edges of the wound knitting together, Harry’s skin painted a soft golden under the glow of the spell. Harry’s hand is warm in his, and he can feel Harry’s pulse rabbiting under where his thumb rests gently on Harry's wrist.
So Harry says it again, “I do, too,” his voice gone soft as warmth blossoms across his body, laughing as Malfoy begins to smile back, bright like the sun.
“Fine,” Harry says, “then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if I bottle some of your sample fusion brews and bring them back to the Ministry for a review.”
“Hello to you too, Potter,” Malfoy says coolly. “Did you pay for this, or did you count on your
read his mind after all, and partly due to the absurdity of Malfoy’s performance.
. (Evil deeds, no doubt.) And he had found nothing, and life had continued on, and Malfoy had remained a whispered legend on the gossip pages.
“Right,” Potter says, wiping his hands in a somewhat nervous fashion against his trousers. “This is, erm. For you. And Teddy. And me, in a way. Er. Merry Christmas, Draco.”
Malfoy coughs some more until his entire face is pink, and doesn’t reply. He’s still not looking at Harry, but it doesn’t matter. Harry knows he’s right. Still, he has to summon every ounce of his Gryffindor courage to say, “Because I feel something for you, you dolt,” and it’s worth it, to see Malfoy’s gaze snap up, to see an expression of wonder spread across his face.
,” Draco snarls, whirling around.
“Thanks, Potter,” Malfoy says. He turns around, pushing his wet hair out of his face, and shoots Harry a lopsided grin.
"Oh." The animosity leaves Potter’s face, and he belatedly sticks out a hand and introduces himself. "I’m Harry," he says to Cheng Wu, although he’s looking at Draco, and there’s something loaded in his expression.
“Work here? Potter, I
“Does it have a name?”
“Why didn’t you tell me about this?” Harry cuts him off, voice low. It echoes oddly against the slick titles of the locker room, and something catches in his stomach as he looks at the marks on Malfoy’s body, at the new bruises that layer on top of old ones like a bad tattoo. It’s more vicious than worry, this strange feeling gnawing at him, and it squeezes the breath out of him. Harry has to fight the urge to break something.
“I’m going to get another drink,” Blaise announces to the general vicinity, rolling his eyes. Neither of them pay any attention to him as he flounces off with a huff.
They go back and Potter spends an inordinate amount of time considering the baked goods on offer, before following Draco’s lead and picking up a rosemary focaccia. They spend a very enjoyable fifteen minutes sitting outside at the same table as the day before as they eat and talk. Potter’s table manners are even worse this time– once he’s done draining his coffee with loud gulps, he reaches over the table and casually filches Draco’s cup. Draco stares, outraged and with his mouth full of food, as Potter brings it to his mouth and takes a long, casual swig.
Once he’s clear of the Ministry wards, Draco Apparates home, and almost immediately crashes into bed and into sleep. He sleeps for ten hours straight, the deep, dreamless sleep of the exhausted and overworked.
"Great," is what Draco is about to say, when a faint wind abruptly blows through the warehouse, smelling strangely reminiscent of rain. At the far end, the dragon scales clink gently against each other, moving in the wind. A sharp shiver runs down his spine at the same time, fierce and unexpected. The glass vial slips out of his suddenly leaden, nerveless fingers, and smashes against the floor with the lightest of tinkles.
Draco walks to one of the windows as Fossey talks to the bored secretary sitting behind a desk, trying to wrangle a last minute meeting with the Minister. The enchanted window shows a bird’s-eye view of the Thames; of London spread out below. The buildings are tiny and grey as the river winds its way through the centre of the city, glistening faintly like a jewel. Draco watches the clouds drift lazily across the sky and breathes in the beauty of the city painted gold under the late afternoon light, feels the tight bands around his heart loosen a little.
“Can I try it?”
“Oh my god,” Harry moans, as passerbys shoot them scandalised looks, “please, for the love of Merlin, stop talking about it!”
"Alright, alright," Potter interrupts, with a desperate glance at his wristwatch. "There’s no time. Look, we’re staging an ambush. We got a tip-off that your offices are going to be broken into and that someone’s after some exhibits in the evidence storeroom, so could you just get into this cupboard with me and stay quiet?"
she was a weak link! It isn’t Weasley is it?” Draco yanks his arm out of Blaise’s grip and whirls around, scanning the room for the Slytherin traitor, and finds Daphne holding hands and beaming at Parvati Patil, who is stunning in a red and gold outfit.
, even though the words are right there on the tip of his tongue, and he doesn’t ask where the hell Potter’s been the last couple of weeks and what gives Potter the right to look at him like that, because
. (Even if a small part of him is starting to believe that Malfoy’s probably
Draco dives to the left, and tucks and rolls out of range. He doesn’t get a chance to see where Potter’s gone, because a well-aimed curse flies dangerously close to his left arm and rips his sleeve. He throws up a shield that shatters almost instantly when another curse hits it, which buys him just enough time to duck out of the way–dodging a second curse that had been going right for his heart. They’re outnumbered, too many faces snarling out spells all aimed in his direction, and he falls back, still casting wildly. It’s all defensive spells now, just trying to buy themselves some time.
Draco looks at Harry, at the cheerful smile on his face, and says in a low, pleased voice, “anywhere you want.”
There’s a moment when Draco thinks they’ve been caught, when it seems like Dean’s turning around to see what Potter’s looking at, but then Dean carries on and swings his other leg over the bench and gets up. They both watch as Dean exits through the double doors of the Great Hall, and then finally,
, that’s the turning point right there. Draco blinks in surprise at having Weasley on his side for once, and then almost instantly, they both turn on Potter.
Harry’s head snaps up. “
, and not because of his name, or his money.
“Version Nine, actually.” Malfoy shrugs when Harry gives him an exasperated look. “I wasn’t going to risk trying it out on anyone else until I knew I had the mix stabilized. And you know you would have done the same, so I don’t want to hear anything about it, Potter,” he adds, and Harry closes his mouth with a snap. He mines zipping up his lips, which elicits a small sigh from Malfoy, though he finally sets about putting together Version Nine.
"Yes?" Draco says, and in the darkness he can feel Potter nodding, saying, "Oh Draco,
"Alright, well, I guess since there’s an open investigation,
It’s the small grunt of pain that echoes through the empty locker room that gives Malfoy away.
This is fine, Draco decides. It’ll be fine.
At Potter’s alarmed look, Draco adds, “But I’ll have to see if Aunt Andromeda approves, of course, although I can’t imagine that she’d object. I had my first broom when I was seven. Used to spend my summer zipping all over the countryside around the Manor on it.”
. And you expect me to bathe there? Are you
“But where’s the fun in that? ‘Break the Oath and lose your life’ is all fine and dandy for some people, but me? I personally like to ensure that the traitor’s around so that I can watch them suffer. And what better way than to push them into bankruptcy, ensure that they remain physically hideous several days a month for the rest of their lives, and guarantee that their future child will hate them?” There’s a twinkle in Malfoy’s eye, and he looks positively gleeful as he says it.
“Oh, he did,” Draco says, as Blaise nods in affirmation. “Long lectures about making sure not to give Muggles
“Not much to do today, Potter.” Malfoy looks deranged and frenzied as he dashes around the laboratory with an armful of roses. All of the cauldrons are going at full tilt, and the air is heavy with the overwhelming scent of coffee and treacle tart and broomstick polish. “I’m going to be spending most of it finishing off the flowers for the wedding tomorrow. You can leave if you want to.”
. He glares back equally fiercely, trying to cover his disappointment with anger. “You’re mental! Why does it always have to be so
“What?” Harry says, and he’s too confused to be offended. “Susan said it was on the house.” He nods to Susan behind the cashier, and Susan gives him a smile and a little wave back. The coffee shop’s almost empty. It’s early, the sky still an inky grey despite the dawn, and the uncaffeinated zombies have not yet arisen to descend upon the shop for their daily dose of caffeine.
Potter’s smiling as he twines their fingers together, as he says softly, “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
.” Malfoy says excitedly. “Potter, your illness last week gave me a brainwave. Now, what do people get during Christmastime, besides disappointing gifts from friends and relatives who can’t be arsed?” He doesn’t wait for Harry to respond before plunging on, “
call my Slytherin names. Second, that’s brilliant. Third, I have not been ‘holed up in here’, I have been working. You know, it’s called a job? Most people have to do it in exchange for money? Fourth, Vicky alerted me to a commotion on the premises. Fifth, this is my lab where I work, and sixth, I’m going to need you to sign this settlement deed, please.” He slides the paper on the table over to Harry with two fingers. Harry grabs it and scans it quickly, his eyes narrowing as he reads.
Draco smiles. “I’m only joking Potter, lead the way.” A thrill runs through him again as Potter grins back.
“Careful of the cauldron,” Malfoy says once Harry steps past the wards into the laboratory.
Potter comes in at about ten in a whirlwind of excitement and energy. Someone claps him on the shoulder, and Draco looks up into Cheng Wu’s grinning face and a "missed me?"
“Not this one,” Harry says, very gently. “Have you been trying to fix the Confidence Coffee?”
"Look Potter, it’s fine." Draco interrupts, and the sick feeling settles back in the pit of his stomach as if it had never left. "You didn’t want to, and you wouldn’t have done it if not for the potion. That’s fine. Me too," he lies, and Potter looks suddenly upset.
He closes his eyes and leans forward, and then he’s pressing his lips against Malfoy’s, feeling the shape of Malfoy’s mouth under his. Malfoy’s lips are slightly chapped from where he’s been nervously chewing on them all morning, and for one terrifying second Malfoy doesn’t kiss him back. Then Malfoy’s lips part. Harry’s hand still rests on Malfoy’s jaw, and relieved, he slides it to cup the back of Malfoy’s neck, to pull Malfoy closer to him. Harry kisses him hungrily and wonders why he hadn’t done this earlier, wonders why it had taken him so long to figure out that what he wanted had been sitting in front of him all this while.
Potter does so, laughing. The flurry of snowflakes that flew in with him melts on the doormat as he stamps his shoes. His cheeks are pink with cold, and the lower half of his face is hidden under a mountain of a scarf that he begins to unwind. He looks adorable, even bundled up as he is, and Draco turns away to hide the sudden flush that rises hot against his cheeks.
Draco’s laughing so hard he’s wheezing, and they have to stop so that he can get his breath back, and so that Harry can slowly untangle the dragon. Draco’s absolutely no help at all in that regard; he just leans against a tree and snickers every time Harry accidentally pulls on his own hair. At the end of it, Harry’s hands are all scratched up, and his eyes are watering from the pain of the dragon’s sharp teeth. He thrusts the dragon in Draco’s direction with an unceremonious, “here,
“Now?” Draco says, even as his internal voice screams,
When he opens his eyes, it’s to see Potter with a vague look on his face. Draco watches as Potter’s gaze drifts down to Draco’s mouth, to where Draco’s biting on his lower lip, worrying it between his teeth. Potter’s eyes dilute, and his lips part soundlessly as he breathes in deeply. There’s the faintest whisper of Potter’s breath on his cheek, and for a second, Draco thinks Potter’s about to kiss him. Which is when the dragon suddenly turns its head and sneezes.
“Like what you see?” Harry says, and is surprised when his voice comes out a little deeper, a little more husky. He’s equally stunned as Malfoy is when he follows that up by giving Malfoy a wink.
,” Harry says indignantly, “and I was told that there was an amnesty declared for the party today. Came to see if it was true.”
"Are you a new hire?"
Cheng Wu laughs too, dimpling handsomely as he rakes a hand through his black hair and winks. The journalists all collectively let out a faint sigh of appreciation, and Draco and Potter are forgotten in the next instant, which is exactly how Draco likes it.
It’s a losing battle, and Potter finally says, voice rough, "Draco, may I?"
“Quiet, Zabini,” Draco says, and holds his cup out for a refill. “No nagging till I get my coffee. You know the rules.”
. No one expects anything to get past Ministry security, not with the Aurors there, but it happens anyway. And at the worst possible moment too: they’re in the middle of yet another fight about whether Draco should continue being an Auror, and they’re unhappy and aren’t speaking to each other, and this is obviously the
Draco just stares at him, bewildered. "This is where I work," he says, extending a hand to sweep over the space, as if inviting Potter to view a fancy apartment.
Remus just sighs again, eyeing the bed. It’s past midnight, they’ve been travelling for over six hours, and he’s too exhausted to argue the point. At least the bed is a double, so they’ll just about fit.
“I’ll... see you around.” Harry looks slightly uncertain as he forces the question into a statement, but Draco nods.
“I do,” Malfoy says, perking up. “We used to be regular visitors when I was young, and I remember quite a bit of the layout and how the rooms look like. The house should still remember me, I think. Old memories, you know, and anyway, I’m related to a Black. Grimmauld should recognise loyalty, if nothing else.”
poison your Butterbeer. You’re quite safe, Potter.” After a moment’s deliberation, he selects Bilshen’s Firewhiskey - aged for thirty-nine years, with a strong smoky flavour, and an aftertaste of figs and peat and smoke - and pours it into a new cup and hands it to Harry.
"Which is why I told you to wait for backup. Do you understand English?" Cheng Wu says slowly, as if talking to a child. He shakes his head and mutters to himself, "Is this truly Britain’s finest? Is English their second language?"
"Uh," Potter says, looking up at Draco, their faces barely inches apart. Draco doesn’t pay him any attention–his gaze is fixed on something beyond Potter’s shoulder. Potter turns to look and swears softly when he sees what Draco had spotted: a thin grey webbing that crawls up over the door and the walls, pulsing with magic and almost invisible in the gloom.
It doesn’t take long for Draco to get used to this, to Potter waiting for him in the mornings with a grin and a "breakfast?", or to Potter chewing on his quills and spinning around on his swivel chair as he flips through the case files, idly throwing out ideas. This becomes Draco’s new normal, and he even grows used to the way Potter steals his coffee and buys him another one to make up for it.
"So, what department are you in? What have you been working on?" Cheng Wu asks, and Potter glances at Draco, something unreadable in his expression.
Of course Harry would deny it, no one wants to admit that they have unusual sexual kinks when the entire Wizarding World has an idealised version of who they should be. They stroll into Hogsmeade, still arguing over whether Harry enjoys pain, sexually or not.
“So, you’ll be your usual self then,” Harry says, looking down at his cup of Butterbeer suspiciously. He tilts it this way and then, watching the liquid slosh inside the cup, then abruptly sets it down on the table and takes a careful step away from it.
“You look highly distressed,” the Admiral says when he catches sight of Harry’s face. “Is the courting not going well?”
He blows his breath out in a sigh–and directly onto Potter’s face. "Oops, sorry, sorry," Draco whispers, as he tries to move away so he isn’t breathing onto Potter anymore. Except there isn’t anywhere for him to move to, with the sides of the cupboard pressing in on either side of them, and all he ends up doing is rubbing himself against Potter’s chest. One of his legs has somehow gotten entwined in between Potter’s, and Draco twists like a salmon in a net as he tries to carefully extricate himself.
needs some coffee if he’s going to power through the rest of the files Fossey left for him on his table.
Malfoy’s darting around the room as he speaks, picking up vials and filling them and pulling out half-filled glass flasks from a small fridge standing next to the cupboard. He’s a blur of activity as he mixes and pours, and finally he presents Harry with five glass flasks, each one neatly labelled from one to five. Unsurprisingly, the liquid in every one of them is a dark coffee-brown.
He watches Malfoy’s face change, watches Malfoy go pale and drop his quill, and laughs.
Draco lets loose a stream of creative swear words at the spot where Cheng Wu stood, but it’s said with a lot of affection and fondness. He turns around, still thinking—and meets Potter’s gaze where Potter’s standing by the door, hands awkwardly stuffed in his pockets.
"Tell me," Potter says again, his eyes dark and intent, before taking Draco in again.
It’s Malfoy who breaks the kiss first, Malfoy who pulls away. “Potter,” he whispers, eyes huge and startled.
Draco can only watch through half-lidded eyes, grunting unwillingly every time his cock hits the back of Potter’s throat. Potter looks absolutely wrecked in the dim wandlight, his hair even messier than usual with Draco’s hands carding through it, his face smeared with drool and precome. Draco watches his cock slide between Potter’s lips, gleaming wet with spit, and the absolute wanton enjoyment on Potter’s face when his cock pushes obscenely against the inside of Potter’s cheek.
It takes a long time before Harry finally feels the potion loosen its hold. As soon as he does, he grabs the potion cleanser and drains it dry in one gulp.
Then Malfoy had told Aiden off for trying to start a fight with a trained Auror, and had ended his lecture with a practical demonstration on how to gain the upper hand over a more powerful opponent.
“Not to be accused of being a prude, but unless you intend on scandalising half the Ministry, you might want to get changed first,” Malfoy says, mirth in his voice as he gets up and turns away. “I’ll give you some space so I don’t impinge on your virtue, shall I?”
"I thought you took the wards down," Potter says, still staring.
In the short time that they’ve been talking, the room has filled up, and over the general noise of chatter, the soft strains of Christmas music fill the air. Across the room, Blaise catches Draco’s eye, one eyebrow arched in a query that could be interpreted as either
Malfoy wags a finger at him. “Uh uh uh. Not so fast. If you want to know that, you’re going to have to sign this.” He heads back to the cupboard again, and roots around in there for a few moments before coming back and slapping yet another piece of paper down in front of Harry. “Standard non-disclosure agreement, you understand. I can’t have you selling my trade secrets off to my biggest competitors.”
The first time that Draco finds Harry Potter hiding in a cupboard is unexpected, to say the least.
the riffraff that just walked in. Honestly, these Hufflepuffs. The one year we let another house host, and this is what we get. Can’t trust them to do anything right.”
So Harry gets his coffee, stops to say hello to Vicky, and then heads off to work. He occasionally comes in for an after-lunch coffee, but he doesn’t bother to stake out the shop anymore. Malfoy’s forever holed up in his laboratory, which Harry is sure can’t be healthy for him, but he knows Malfoy won’t be prised away from his work.
Harry obliges. “Malfoy, you’re deranged. What have you gone and done now?”
“I don’t,” Malfoy says, his smirk broadening, “but the
“This?” Harry says doubtfully, picking up one in a fire-engine red.
“You have, erm,” Harry gestures to Malfoy’s face.
“Of course you weren’t,” Draco says, and tries to look disdainfully down his nose at Potter. He fails, because Potter’s standing up while he’s sitting down, and he goes a bit cross-eyed in his attempt at trying to glare up at Potter. Potter’s lips twitch, as if he’s desperately trying to hold back a laugh. There’s a general air of amusement about Potter, and he looks at Draco consideringly, as if he’s trying to make up his mind about something.
"And why am I only being informed about this now?" Shacklebolt asks, very calmly, but Draco can sense that they’re all treading on thin ice, with or without Potter present. They all exchange a look, and Fossey hesitates, trying to think of a better way to spin it.
“It’s nothing you haven’t seen before, Potter, there’s no need to concern yourself with protecting my maidenly virtue,” Malfoy says, huffing out a laugh. But he winces and stops, his shirt bunched up around his chest. His face is strained with discomfort. “I think you might have to cut this off me. I can’t lift my arms up.”
"Right," Draco says a little desperately, because he’s ridiculously hard; had been since the moment Potter pushed him up against the wall, and he absolutely cannot wait for another hour. "Know any deserted corridors where stray Howlers won’t find us?"
Then Potter starts going, “psspsspsspss,” which Draco can’t help but laugh at, and which, incredibly, seems to do the trick. The dragon gets up and shakes its wings out grumpily before climbing onto Potter’s palm, where Potter transfers it to his shoulder.
“Oh I see.” Pansy shudders, her mouth twisting into a grimace. “In love with a Gryffindor. What a disgrace.”
“Thanks,” Malfoy says distractedly, and reaches out to absently pat Harry on his arm. Harry bites back a sigh.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” Malfoy says, and goes over to a cupboard at the far end of the room that Harry hadn’t noticed. He comes back with an unlabelled flask that he shoves at Harry and a piece of paper that he places on the table. “Drink this.”
“Go ahead. You can touch it if you want,” Malfoy says, decidedly warmer now, and Harry glances back to see him smile. The star that Harry’s fingers brush against abruptly flares up, before the words ‘Sagittarius A’ appears next to it in spidery writing. As Harry watches in wonderment, the words melt away to be replaced with basic information about the constellation it belongs to, the right ascension, the declination, the mass, and distance.
“First, don’t you
“Malfoy, you are such a prat,” Harry says, but instead of getting angry, he’s laughing, the corners of his eyes crinkled in amusement.
A month ago, everything had been fine, and he had actually allowed himself to entertain the possibility that he had friends. Friends who seemed to genuinely enjoy his company, who seemed to want to be around him because of who he
Harry glances into the cup, then looks up at Draco, his mouth twisted into a small smile. “Are you asking me to trust the word of a Slytherin?” He takes a swig nonetheless, deliberately holding Draco’s gaze over the rim of the cup the whole time, and suddenly the room feels hot and crowded.
The smell of treacle tart wafts all around the room until his stomach growls. There’s a familiar aroma underlying it that Harry
They go down to the living room, the lights flickering on and lighting a path before them as they move from room to room. The fireplace obligingly roars to life as Malfoy collapses into an armchair, and Harry takes a chair opposite him.
"Be careful," Draco murmurs, as Potter slips inside cautiously, wand out. Draco remains outside, keeping guard until he hears Potter’s whispered "all clear" float out from the door. He takes one last look around the dark, deserted alley before slipping in, pulling the door firmly shut behind him.
Draco watches him go, but doesn’t follow him. He just sits at his desk and flips through a file without really seeing anything, trying to think through the events of the past month. Trying to figure out how they went from barely speaking to him giving Potter a handjob in a cupboard within a month, and then back again to barely speaking.
Malfoy scowls. “Yes, I’ll confess that I’ll appreciate it if you wouldn’t distract my staff, Potter. They have a job that I’m paying them good money to do, and that doesn’t involve gossiping about my trade secrets with you. Now, if you don’t mind!”
“How can I help?” Harry says finally. “What do you need?”
“Here?” Harry says once more, looking doubtfully around the empty locker room again. At any moment, anyone could walk in and see Malfoy in all of his naked glory, and Harry could not conceive of any universe in which this was an acceptable proposal in any way, shape, or form.
Potter kisses like he’s desperate, like he’s starving, his mouth hot and demanding. Draco kisses back just as fiercely, like his life depends on it, until he feels Potter begin to falter, his lips a question under Draco’s, and abruptly, Draco stops. He tries to pull back but there’s just hard, unyielding metal behind him and Potter’s hands clamped around his wrists, anchoring him in place, so he sees it when it happens, when Potter finally pulls away, when Potter’s face finally clears. First, the horror, slowly creeping across Potter’s face. Then Potter abruptly loosens his grip on Draco’s wrists and steps back, shaking his head wordlessly, looking sick.
Malfoy pauses to look up. “Your tastes. They’re so… mundane.” He smirks, and goes back to writing. “Who knew that what the saviour of the wizarding world would find most desirable is broomstick polish, treacle tart and coffee.”
“Evil never sleeps,” Harry says, distracted. Draco’s long fingers are curled around his cup, his head tilted back as he drains the coffee, his slender throat exposed. Harry swallows hard, his gaze tracing the curve of Draco’s neck.
"It’s so nice to see everyone’s getting along with each other," Potter says pointedly, and the two of them settle into a sulky sort of truce.
..."Mini-fic" HAH
"I’m on probation for yelling at Robards. Apparently, he wasn’t too keen about me going on at him about sharing resources. He said that since I kept banging on about how we’re ‘one Ministry, one team’, he was going to let me have a chance to put my money where my mouth was. I said fine, so he’s put me on probation and transferred me over on a temporary loan for a month, or, as he said, ‘until I worked this out of my system’."
He pauses before taking the first sip, looks Malfoy dead in the eye and says very seriously, “Just remember, if I die, there are people who love me who know where I am and who will stop at nothing to hunt you down.”
“You think you have a bathtub in one of the bathrooms,” Malfoy repeats, deadpan. “Potter. That’s… there’s so much to unpack right there. First of all, haven’t you been living there for, oh, I don’t know, the last three years? Why haven’t you gotten the house on your side yet? Secondly, yes, there is a bathtub in one of the bathrooms. In two, actually, if I remember correctly. But now I’m wondering what the house has been offering you if you’re not even sure. Third, I seriously doubt the cleanliness of your bathroom if you aren’t even sure of what’s actually
“Oh, come off it, you made badges announcing ‘
"I got the alert too, you idiot," Cheng Wu says, releasing him with a shake. "I told you to wait for me, but no, you’ve got to go off and be an absolute idiot, didn’t you?! We could have killed you!"
here?” and he sounds so surprised that Draco can’t stop himself from turning back.
"Go on, Potter, come for me," Draco whispers into Potter’s ear, his hand pumping furiously, and then Potter does, messy and hard, all over Draco’s hand, and all over their jumpers. Draco strokes Potter through it, through the shudders that wreck Potter’s body, Potter’s panting breath hot on his cheek, until Potter finally stills.
“Does he, though? It’s hard to tell when he’s constantly vomiting on me.”
“And the Manor thought that it would be best if you… showed me your room?” Harry says slowly, trying to work it out.
, but just can’t place. Malfoy hears his stomach complaining and looks up.
“Okay, first up. The Focus Pocus Double Espresso.” Malfoy looks at Harry expectantly, and Harry takes a deep breath before lifting the flask to his lips. This was what he wanted, and now that he’s gotten it, he can’t find a good reason not to drink exactly what he had asked for.
Potter’s frown softens even further until he just looks puzzled, but he obediently bends forward to give a dragon a cursory once-over. “Yeap,” he says, “it’s definitely mine.”
“Wouldn’t mind poking a bit more, to be honest,” Harry says without thinking, and it isn’t until Malfoy stares at him that he realises what he just said. “Oh. Oh! No! Not what I meant.”
“Greengrass? I always
Then Draco’s shoving him back forcefully, his hands curled into fists against Harry’s robes. “Oh, why can’t you just leave me alone,” he snarls, thumping Harry on his chest. Then Draco turns and flees down the corridor, leaving Harry behind, his heart pounding, stunned.
"Fossey, sir. Diana Fossey, Director of the Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division. We’re a small division under the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And these are my colleagues." She introduces them one by one, and the faintly puzzled look leaves Shacklebolt’s face when they get to Potter.
“Yes?” Malfoy says, setting down the plate and sliding into the chair, and Harry stares at him. Malfoy’s hair is washed in gold by the late morning sun that slants through the windows of the shop, and he smells exactly like everything Harry has ever wanted.
It’s only when Potter begins to swell with indignation, two flushed spots of colour beginning to appear on his cheeks, that Draco realises that Potter thinks Draco’s insulting him. They haven’t spoken since Potter testified on his behalf at his trial, glaring out at the Wizengamot as he told them how Draco and Narcissa had both saved his life, twice. It hadn’t impressed the judges.
“It’s the damn peppermint. It’s throwing everything off,” Malfoy moans in despair. Harry swallows and shifts in his seat at the sound. Heedless of the ink on his hands, Malfoy scrubs a hand furiously through his hair as he pores over his notes, while Harry takes a healthy gulp of the potion cleanser.
Until now.
“Ugh, this is what I get for hiring Hufflepuffs,” Draco says, but despite his annoyance, there’s no heat behind his words. “Well, you’d better treasure this apple Potter, cause it’s the last free one you’re going to get.”
“Fine. Then I’ll be happy to try a sample of what you’ve been mixing into the coffee. Since it’s
“I could, erm. I could help you with that if you want.” Harry doesn’t know why his face heats up, and he isn’t sure whether he’s blushing, but Malfoy shakes his head.
“You’re hopeless,” Draco says, shaking his head as they continue on. “What would you have done without me? Just let the wound fester, and wait until you die of blood poisoning? So this means that I’ve saved your life, right ? Do you owe me your firstborn now? Because if you do, that would actually be helpful. Takes a lot of the pressure off my shoulders to produce the next Malfoy heir, you know? Although I’m not sure how Mother might take to it once she learns that the latest Malfoy came from the loins of a Potter. Though I’d say she’d hardly have cause for complaint, not after that entire debacle with Father. Oh well, I’m sure we can work it all out.”
He leaves as the morning rush begins, ducking hurriedly out the door to a flurry of sudden whispers, but he already knows he’s coming back.
"It’s far too early in the morning for anyone to be this happy," Draco says, and Potter looks up from where he’s idly doodling on a piece of paper to grin at Draco.
“Oh yes,” Harry says in relief. “Yes.” He escapes the workroom in a bundle of jittery nerves, wiping his hands on his jeans as he heads out to the front of the shop. Thankfully, the table under Queen V’s Portrait is free, and he slides into the seat, burying his head in his hands. He can still smell the damn treacle tart, even over the smell of the coffee roasting.
"I—yes, absolutely, please," Draco breathes back, nonsensical in his desire, biting down on Potter’s thumb, "Merlin,
take it!”
“And maybe you need bigger glasses. Anyway, as I was saying, we’re the world’s first magical fusion coffee shop. The concept of this brilliant idea was, of course, conjured up by yours truly. How, you ask? Well, let me tell you! Most potions taste awful and take too much time to make, so why not infuse a potion with something delicious that you can not only purchase everyday, but also start your morning with? Hence, Espresso Patronum! The big secret is
Then Draco sets his cup down and meets Harry’s eyes straight on. Startled, Harry quickly looks away, then down at his plate of untouched food, and hastily picks up his fork. He shovels in a few mouthfuls of food, chewing mechanically and tasting nothing. When he looks up a few moments later, Draco’s turned away, imperiously beckoning to Blaise for the coffee pot.
kick you in your sleep.”
“Oh, of course you have,“ Malfoy’s saying, waving his hands around, and Harry’s heart stops beating for a second before Malfoy continues, “in hindsight it’s obvious, isn’t it? You copied my every move, right down to having two minions at your beck and call. Ooh, this is one for the papers, this is. I can see the headlines already, Boy-Who-Lived Confesses to Stalking Former Schoolmate. Exclusive interview with the harassed victim on page 2.”
“Next?” Draco says, slightly surprised. He hadn’t thought of anything beyond completing their errand, and now that that’s settled, he realises that they don’t have a reason to hang around each other anymore, but Harry’s face is bright and open and the dragon’s nuzzling Draco’s cheek, and Draco can feel himself being pulled into their orbit.
"Potter!" Draco yells, panicked, and the sound echoes strangely within the bubble.
. "My guess is Robards finally got wind of the transfer. We sort of did go over his head about it."
“Malfoy, you’re a genius,” Malfoy proclaims, and looks expectantly at Harry, waving his hands in encouragement.
“Malfoy, you are
“Don’t you have another bathroom?” Harry says.
, and all they want is the details of where the Hong Kong press conference is going to be held before they rush away to organise Portkeys over.
. This is new. I think–I think these are wards to keep us
When he finally steps out, a blast of hot steam curling outwards from the open door and a towel wrapped around his waist, it’s to the quiet dripping of the taps and a deserted locker room. He takes a quick glance down the row, but the doors to each shower stall are open, and there’s no sight of Malfoy.
,” Harry breathes, and can’t stop staring at Malfoy. He feels unexpectedly defenseless, sitting here in Malfoy’s coffee shop decorated in Slytherin colours and crowded with Slytherin baristas and Portraits on the wall, and
"Well?" Fossey demands once the door’s shut and they’ve cast multiple Silencing and Repelling charms on every conceivable means of entry.
“Start scooping some of this out into those beakers over there. We’ve got to start testing how long the effects of an infusion lasts. We’ll try for an hour, and work it out from there.” Malfoy points out the equipment standing in a row at the end of the table, and Harry gets to work.
“What is this, a Ministry inspection?” Malfoy huffs. “Are you happy now?” Harry’s attention is drawn back as Malfoy throws up a glamour over the crates of coffee. “Now, if you’re quite done with having a poke around!”
“He’s not wrong, you idiot,” Malfoy hisses. “Did you check the expiry date on the bottle before serving it?”
“Where is it,” Draco says, tapping his foot against the floor. His arms are crossed, and his mouth is twisted into a small frown - not exactly the very picture of excitement that Harry had hoped for when he told Draco that his present was hidden somewhere around the flat.
What happens after that is a blur. The last thing that Draco remembers clearly is Potter telling him to
“Alright,” Harry grins. He never does sign the settlement deed.
“Yes. Not to drink, mind you,” Malfoy adds. “This is Pansy’s great idea for her wedding. She wants me to soak the flowers and the petals in Amortentia so that the guests will smell all the things that they like during the ceremony. ‘Should make for interesting drama’, is what she said, but who is the one that has to pull this all together? That’s right,
“Very undignified of you,” Draco informs him absently. Behind his glasses, Harry’s eyes are a bright green as he picks up the apple and bites into it, holding Draco’s gaze the entire time.
“Didn’t Potter fight a dragon like that?” Blaise says neutrally.
Harry stops short, staring. All the ingredients have vanished off the shelves, and in their place, flowers fill every available surface. Bunches of wild lavender line one shelf, while white roses fill another. There are multiple sacks full of flower petals that take up half the lab, and in the middle of it stands Malfoy, calmly monitoring the potions simmering in Cauldrons Three, Four and Five. There are double the number of wards over the cauldrons today, and the air is thick with a hazy golden shimmer as the steam of the potions mingles with the wards.
signing it.”
Harry blinks, and realises that all of his senses have been heightened. He looks at Malfoy scribbling away in a notebook with that ridiculous peacock quill of his—really looks at him for the first time in years. The harsh overhead light in the windowless room should have washed anyone with Malfoy’s complexion out, but Malfoy looks annoyingly normal, albeit slightly pale. Time has softened those features that Harry would have once called pointy, and now that Malfoy’s distracted, his mouth is one soft, generous curve. Harry finds himself watching that mouth, waiting to see if it would curl up into a sneer or a smile.
Secretly, he thinks that Harry might be wondering the same thing too. Harry keeps looking at Draco as if he’s never quite seen Draco before: surprised and amused and slightly wary all rolled into one. But they continue talking: about Quidditch; about Draco’s conspiracy theory that Professor Trelawney’s secretly a functioning alcoholic; about whether Professor Binns realises that he’s dead or whether he still tries to use the loo, and if so, how that would go - “I
Aiden had been sure that Harry was trying to steal something from the back room, and Harry had utterly failed to convince him otherwise with his argument of, “But what do you even have for me to steal? Mouldy coffee beans?” Which wasn’t very fair, because, as Malfoy had told him crossly when he came out to break up the fight, there were Statis charms layered over all the coffee beans to stop them going bad, and further, some of the beans were rather exotic and quite expensive.
Draco nods. “Teddy would love it.” It’s a sidestep from what he truly wants to say. There’s a slight pause. Draco takes a deep breath and picks up his courage and forges ahead.
Potter laughs as he gets in and says, "Draco, do you want to get your dick sucked or not?"
“Keep your chin up, boy, it can’t be all that bad. Why, you’ve never known the agony of being rescued from a charity shop. A charity shop! Can you imagine? A painting of my pedigree, and not even afforded the dignity of an open auction!” The Admiral says comfortingly from the frame next to Queen V’s.
"No, Malfoy," Potter says, impatient, "I mean, why are you still here? Doesn’t your team usually leave by seven?"
The bathroom is large, and done up in lots of muted greens and greys. A large pond with numerous lily pads is painted onto the walls, and a tiny frog hops off a painted lily pad and into the pond with a splash as they walk in. Harry’s gaze is immediately drawn to the tub, which takes up the length of one wall. It’s a soaking tub large enough for two people, and deep enough that he thinks he could swim in it, with steps cut into the side and leading up to the tub.
The idea of the tiny dragon getting chopped up into parts horrifies Draco, and he inadvertently locks eyes with Potter as they exchange a grimace, the both of them pulling a face. There’s a moment of stillness while they both process the fact that they just had an unexpected moment of camaraderie. Then Draco makes another face, sticking out his tongue at the same time that Potter does, and they lock eyes again.
A distant part of his mind wonders how Potter’s faring. Potter, with that beautiful tanned skin and lean muscled body of his, hadn’t had the time to shield himself. The smoke that enveloped the spot where Potter stood is tinged with hints of red; bright streaks of red flashing in and out as the smoke pushes up against the shield. Which is exactly what Draco wants to do to Potter right now—push him up against something solid, and firm, and then… and then...
"How do we spell your name?"
“I— But—” Harry stares at Malfoy helplessly. This is wrong. Harry’s the one who should be apologising to Malfoy, not the other way around, but he doesn’t know what to say that would change the set expression on Malfoy’s face.
Harry growls, but a little part of him is pleased that he’s the cause of Malfoy’s mirth. The third one goes down better, but still makes his hair stand up on end. The fourth and fifth versions eliminate the hair-raising and the steam, but turn Harry’s face an incredible shade of red. The sixth one sends Harry choking and grabbing desperately at the glass of water that Malfoy always has on standby.
Malfoy hesitates. “Potter, I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”
Draco says, eyes narrowed dangerously, “what were the names of your relatives again? I promise it’s not because I intend to hunt them down and turn them into little cockroaches and stomp on them.”
Potter’s hands settle on Draco’s shoulders, and then he’s pressing closer, pushing Draco up against the side of the cupboard—and Draco’s absolutely sure of it, Potter has a thing for pinning. Potter’s lips are hot on Draco’s neck, and he licks a long, slow stretch up Draco’s neck. He follows that up with a bite, sharp enough that it makes Draco jump, but not sharp enough to break skin. Potter closes his mouth around the wound and sucks, hard enough to leave a bruise, and Draco has to bite back the moan that crawls up his throat and fills his mouth.
Harry blinks at him in faint surprise. “Hang on. There’s been an annual inter-house party for the last fifty years? Why is this the first time we’re here for this then?” He frowns, thinking, and Draco can see when the moment of clarity hits and his face clears.
Now that Harry’s gotten a good look at the back room, his interest in Malfoy has skyrocketed. He can’t fathom what Malfoy’s up to: illegal coffee smuggling? Money-laundering in coffee beans? Is that even a thing? None of that makes sense. Annoyingly, the popularity of Malfoy’s shop continues to grow, which suggests that for all intents and purposes, he’s running a perfectly legit operation. And yet, Harry can’t shake the suspicion curling in his gut that Malfoy’s
“Potter, why are you brandishing the towel at me like it’s a threat?”
They part ways in the lift, with Potter giving Draco a friendly nod. Draco nods back, briefly wondering how they’ve managed to go from five years of silence to sharing friendly nods in the span of less than a day. He writes it off as a fluke, as one of those panic-induced pseudo-friendships, and carries on with the rest of his day.
At his yell, the Aurors have started to spring into action, their wands out and working their way through the crowd towards Harry and Draco, trying to form a defensive perimeter. Distantly, Harry wishes Ron and Hermione were here to back him up, but Hermione’s in her third trimester and Ron’s with her at home, doting on her every need.
“Luna,” Harry yells, completely throwing Draco’s desire for discretion to the wind. There’s no point in being discreet if Draco’s going to be dead. “Neville! Get over here!” He presses two fingers to Draco’s neck, checks for a pulse. It’s there. It’s weak, but it’s there. Harry let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding in.
Draco has to fight not to laugh at the sight of Potter scolding a tiny, unrepentant dragon, who just shakes its head haughtily, and snorts out a puff of smoke at him in reply.
Harry’s impressed. It sounds insanely brilliant and difficult, and yet Malfoy’s not only doing it, he’s doing it
. And I’ve combined two things that people love in December: peppermint, and Pepper-Up Potion. Potter, this is a
“Version One,” Malfoy says brightly. A quill is already in his hand, poised over a fresh page of his notebook.
He’s so giddy with elation that Harry can’t help but get caught up in it too. “Malfoy, that’s brilliant.”
Malfoy’s expression doesn’t change, but he goes still and watches as Harry approaches.
“I haven’t, I don’t,” he begins nervously, which is how Harry knows that things aren’t right between them. Malfoy’s never nervous.
Harry’s eyes are a bright, brilliant green, and for a wild moment Draco thinks that he actually
“Hmm, intriguing,” Malfoy says, and his long fingers reach out to gracefully pluck a quill out from thin air.
Then Potter comes to a halt in front of a blank wall, and he looks up to realise that Potter’s walked him all the way down to the dungeons. Belatedly, Draco realises that he’s cold, and that he’s been cold for a while now, and that they’re also right in front of the Slytherin rooms.
“Oh,” Harry says uncomprehendingly. He stares at Malfoy some more. “You were?”
“For fuck’s sake, Potter. It’s a general antidote for expired potions. Look, I’ll go first, you paranoid freak.” Malfoy takes a large swig of the flask, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand once he’s done, and shoves the flask at Harry once again.
to his division, what the hell is that all about–and then pulls up short as a thought strikes him. He stares at Cheng Wu, eyes narrowed.
And just like that, Harry’s annoyance evaporates like it was never there. “It’s okay. We’re good,” he says, and means it.
It’s the odd placement of the horns and fangs and claws that catches Draco’s eye. It takes him a moment, his eyes flicking over the scales that make up the majority of the dragon parts that fill the wall, almost like a background, almost like a filler...
. Not sure he knows any other defensive spell, to be honest."
Potter stops him, takes Draco’s hands in his and says, carefully, "I thought I had to wine and dine you first." There’s a long pause, and then Potter says, "Erm, that was me trying to ask you out on a date  by the way. In case that wasn’t clear."
Malfoy overhears this anyway, and shrugs his uninjured shoulder. Harry’s scowling now, worry thrumming through him like a live wire as he looks at Malfoy and sees how tired he looks. He doesn’t know what expression his face makes, but Malfoy’s eyebrows knit together, and he’s overly cheerful—
of the bulbs drowned out only by the sudden flood of questions:
Minister Shacklebolt looks harried, as they troop into his office—more plush carpeting, coupled with gilded gold furnishings on the furniture—and gets up to shake Fossey’s hand as she strides forward confidently.
"Ready?" Potter asks, offering his arm.
been on his mind. Besides Mother, Teddy and Aunt Andromeda were all he had left of family, and he was determined to spoil Teddy—at least, as much as Aunt Andromeda would allow him to get away with.
Draco shrugs, sipping at his drink. “One never knows with that man. If he had a sense of humour, he was perfectly deadpan about it.”
Harry doesn’t say anything though, just kneads his fingers down Malfoy’s scalp, circling his fingertips against where he thinks the pressure points are on the nape of Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy’s skin is warm, and he doesn’t want to stop touching Malfoy. Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind. He tilts his head slightly to the left, giving Harry better access, and Harry keeps at it until the shampoo suds in Malfoy’s hair begins to dissipate.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, and then smiles. His smile is like a burst of sunshine, radiant and warm, and it almost hurts Harry to look at him. Then Malfoy says, “Me too.”
. No, I’m talking about Starbucks. Those greedy corporate bastards will stop at nothing to get their hands on my formulas.”
Harry’s startled laugh stirs something unexpected in the pit of Draco’s stomach, and his cheeks grow warm. Draco looks past Harry to survey the crowd, because Harry’s looking at him with something almost akin to amusement instead of scorn, and he doesn’t quite know what to do with that.
“So you’re basically making potpourri,” Harry says slowly, and starts laughing when Malfoy pulls a face.
At that, Potter presses the entire full length of his body against Draco’s, sliding a leg in between Draco’s. Draco can feel Potter burning up like a phoenix even through the layers of clothing, his body hot like a fever and the shape of Potter’s arousal pressing urgently into his thigh.
“I see,” Harry says slowly.
" Potter says again. They both ignore him. By the end of the lunch, they’re not exactly friends, but they’re not exactly enemies either.
“Draco,” he says, and is equally surprised as Draco when it comes out as a plea. Draco’s face shifts from anger to confusion, and for a wild second, Harry thinks he’ll give in. Draco’s eyes are silvery grey beneath those long lashes, and they dart wildly from Harry’s face to where he’s holding onto Draco. Still.
A shock murmur runs through the crowd when they see Draco collapsed in Harry’s arms, and Harry gets his wand out. Everyone hastily takes three steps back.
"No speak English, you wanker!" Is the last thing that Cheng Wu says, laughing like a demented little goblin as he reaches the Port point and fishes the Portkey out of his pocket. He gives Draco a cheeky wink, and Ports away still laughing, the remnants of his laughter echoing oddly around the Port point before it fades away in the next second.
Potter frowns and stops eating. "Alone?"
, not be Scourgified like a common dish towel! Ugh, this is foul. I don’t feel clean at all, and if your spell mucked up my hair, there will be hell to pay.” He runs a tentative hand through his hair, scowling.
“Good night Draco,” Harry says quietly, taking a step closer to Draco and looking up at him through dark lashes, the light casting shadows against his face. “And Merry Christmas.”
Draco goes for lunch alone. He heads to Cheng Wu’s favourite pub, where he orders his usual and takes the table under the tree. It’s an overcast day, and there’s no one outside in the garden, which suits his mood just fine. He finishes his lunch and stretches out like a cat, head tilted over the back of his chair until he’s staring up at the branches of the tree, watching the weak sunlight filter through the shifting leaves.
And Harry’s sure that he wasn’t, not really, but now that Malfoy’s said it…. “Come here and let me dry your hair,” Harry says, laughing as Malfoy backs away, eyes wide.
When Malfoy looks up again some minutes later, there’s a large streak of ink across his right cheekbone. “Okay, I think I have it,” he announces.
They end up standing in front of a long row of collars in various shapes and fabrics and colours, and Draco immediately zeros in on a tasteful green leather collar trimmed in shimmering silver, which Harry vetoes on the spot.
"Good, good," Fossey says, smiling in satisfaction. "I know this is your case, Draco, but we couldn’t keep you in the loop on this. Robard isn’t going to like having the rug pulled out from under him. I wanted to limit the fallout to the people who can get away with it when the shit hits the fan. You, unfortunately, aren’t one of them, so I thought it was best to keep you out of it until everything was settled." She shrugs apologetically at Draco, who, mystified, just nods back. "Right then, it’s about time for me to have a long chat with Minister Shacklebolt. Good job, team, now let’s go claim our pound of flesh."
“They’re aren’t my
“Yeah?” Potter says.
that he can almost smell it.
After that, Harry makes it a point to stop by Espresso Patronum every day. At first it’s to keep tabs on Malfoy, but it seems like Malfoy’s hardly ever there. The few times that he does see Malfoy is when Malfoy either goes in or comes out of a mysterious door leading to the back room of the shop, looking frenzied and clutching a notebook in one hand as he mutters to himself and scribbles notes. No one else seems to find that odd, which raises Harry’s suspicions.
“You mean ‘brilliant’,” Malfoy corrects, smiling serenely. “Of course I am. That is both my gift and my curse, to be brilliantly underappreciated by the common folk. I have learnt to live with it.”
“Potter!” Malfoy says warningly, but he’s laughing too. He allows himself to be cornered and dragged to sit on the edge of the tub, then proceeds to loftily issue instructions on how exactly Harry should go about drying his hair.
"Minister, sir," Hannah says. She’s blushing all the way to the tip of her ears and darts a nervous glance at Cheng Wu. Cheng Wu gives her a smile that makes her fumble and drop her papers and clipboard. Draco catches Fossey’s eye, and the both of them roll their eyes simultaneously.
“We are fine, Malfoy, I just think a bathtub would be easier than both of us standing under a shower. Look, I’m fairly certain I have a bathtub, and whatever its state, I’m sure it’s nothing a few cleaning spells can’t fix.”
"Heavens, yes," Potter says as he grabs the cloak slung casually over the back of Draco’s chair. "I’m starving, and I haven’t eaten in twelve hours."
, his brain screams,
“Oh that’s easy. She’s one of the Portraits outside. Old Woman With Folded Hands, you must have come across her before. I call her Vicky, after Queen Victoria, although no one knows her real name. She won’t tell, you see. Says a lady has to take some secrets to the grave, although I told her, look Vicks, you’re long dead. Besides the immortals, no one else you know has been alive for the last few centuries. Then she called me a very rude name, that saucy tart. But she’s my favourite, she’s very good at making people cry, and fantastic at rallying the other Portraits for a round of good mocking. She’s the reason no one likes to linger around—which is how I like my shop. Empty of customers, and full of money.” Malfoy beams, as if they were discussing the weather and not deliberate cruelty to customers. And
Harry nods encouragingly. “So let’s try out Version Two.”
“Your usual?” Graham says, not even bothering to look up from the book that he’s reading.
He’s going to have to fight, Draco thinks, because Potter’s going to be useless; Potter’s not in the right frame of mind to think about his own safety. A distant part of Draco’s mind is already formulating plans, reminding himself to tuck and roll out of the way before casting, and running through the long list of defensive and offensive spells that he knows.
When Harry raises a baffled eyebrow, Malfoy sighs and elaborates, “Potter, you
“Something you want to confess to, Malfoy?” Harry says lightly. Malfoy’s dressed in a green jumper that brings out his eyes, a shade of grey so striking that Harry can’t quite look away once he’s caught Malfoy’s gaze. Something about the sight of him makes Harry’s heart pound that little bit faster.
It had taken another day of Potter testifying, and half a day of closing arguments and deliberations, but in the end, Potter’s dogged insistence won out. The political outcry at their acquittal was far more muted than Draco thought it would be, but everything was still too new, the political landscape too fragile for anyone to make any big moves against the Boy Who Won the Entire Fucking War On His Own Back, and they knew it.
A spell zings by, dangerously close to his face. He’s–
They make six more arrests over the course of the day, but no one that Cheng Wu identifies as a major player. Nevertheless, it’s still a win. They spend two hours dealing with paperwork so that Cheng Wu can take the triad members back to Hong Kong under the international extradition treaty, and then another two hours working with the Aurors on the papers for the magical trace evidence. The warehouse is overflowing with magical residue, and nobody's happy about having to sort through the residue for evidence of the use of illegal curses.
“Are you hungry? Do you want to grab a bite first? I’ll finish up and join you in a second.”
"Hey!" Potter says.
“I thought it would be nice if we could play a game with Teddy,” Potter says quietly. He pauses, then adds, slightly hesitantly, “Together.”
They Apparate into the grounds to see Malfoy Manor light up like a Christmas tree, lights twinkling one by one up the drive. Gravel crunches under their feet as they make the short walk up to the Manor from the Apparation point, and the heavy double doors swing open silently to reveal the parlour, brightly lit and empty. The rooms beyond that are dark, and there’s the feeling of an expectant pause as they step over the threshold, as if the whole house is holding its breath.
"Alright, but can I get my files first? I’ve got an international meeting in three days that I need to prepare for."
“We were seized by the Ministry and put up for sale when our owners disappeared after the war, except that none of us sold. Most wizarding folk didn’t want us in their homes when they learnt who our original owners were, and the ones who didn’t mind were all in Azkaban. So it was the charity shop, or the fire. Draco bought us.” The Admiral says it as a matter of fact as he smooths his uniform down, as if he were talking about the weather and not the end of his magical existence.
"Potter," he says, voice low, and Potter turns to him, swinging his wand. The light spills over Draco and off a row of the stolen dragon scales, each one palm sized and strung up neatly on a thin metal wire that spans the entire length of the warehouse. Potter takes a step back and lifts his wand higher, and the light runs down the length of the wall to illuminate the entirety of the stolen exhibits, a multitude of dragon fangs and claws and scales and horns that glimmer iridescently under the light.
"I’m with the Aurors. I… was actually sent undercover for the last three weeks–it was a very last-minute assignment, so that’s why you haven’t seen me around." Potter rubs the back of his neck, as if trying to work out a knot, and although he’s replying to Cheng Wu’s question, his entire body is turned to face Draco, an earnest expression on his face. "I’ve only just got back really, and I was walking by when I saw you two."
“Hey, none of that now,” Draco says scoldingly, and holds up two fingers for the Horntail to land. It does so to a murmur of
Cheng Wu blinks innocently back at him. "I’m sorry, but I don’t understand English," he says in perfect English, and laughs uproariously when Draco pulls a face of utter disgust and scowls at him.
So it’s completely unexpected when Harry finds himself catching the crook of Draco’s elbow and pulling him to a stop.
“I— Wait. Why are
They make for the door as one, but Draco sees it just before they get there, and grabs Potter’s arm just in time to stop him. He yanks Potter back with enough force that Potter turns and stumbles right into him. Draco automatically catches Potter, his free hand gripping Potter’s shoulder and holding him steady.
“Well, yeah,” Harry says, shrugging. “That isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind when your name is mentioned.”
“That’s the Slytherin house colours,” Harry says flatly, and refuses to listen to any arguments about how the green beautifully complements the Horntail’s black scales.
"Uh huh," Draco says, turning to face Potter. The corridors are mercifully deserted at this hour, so close to the end of the day.
,” Harry says, “that isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind when your name is mentioned.”
He hurries into his clothes, still sleep-muddled and clumsy. By the time he’s done he’s woken up enough to send off an urgent owl to Potter, but completely forgets that Potter had worked his own ping into the tracking and tracing spells. He startles when the owl comes back less than five minutes later, carrying Potter’s chicken scratch of a scrawl informing him that Potter’s waiting outside the Malfoy gates, because the wards won’t let him in.
was why Potter had disappeared for three weeks without a word. He doesn’t know what to make of it—why Potter would care, why Potter’s doing this. He looks up when Potter comes out of Fossey’s office, but Potter avoids his gaze; just snatches up his cloak and leaves the office without a word.
“There’s only one bed,” Remus says, and he sounds more tired than exasperated.
terrible," and Draco nods back and says, cautiously, "See you around." He’s pleasantly surprised to discover that he does actually mean it.
And now here they are, meeting for the first time in five years, and Potter’s already getting cross with him. It almost feels like they haven’t left school behind.
got a love life doesn’t mean that we all have to partake in this scandal!”
him.”
“Lean forward,” Harry says, as he picks up what’s left of the pitcher of water. He rinses the shampoo off, watching as the soapy water runs down the curve of Malfoy’s back. Malfoy’s all bony and bruised, the marks on his body somehow even starker under the glow of the bathroom light. It makes Harry’s heart clench painfully.
Before Harry knows it, he’s walking down the rows of empty lockers and over to the next aisle to where Malfoy’s locker is.
Draco chases him all the way down the corridor and right into the Port rooms, yelling, "You insufferable git, stop right there! Cheng Wu! Get
It happens so frequently that Harry’s sure that Malfoy’s got to be doing it on purpose, and looks up in outrage when Malfoy’s left hand brushes up against Harry’s arm again when he reaches past Harry for an empty beaker. But Malfoy’s not even looking at him—his head is bowed over his notebook as he frantically scribbles away, while his left hand gropes blindly around the table. Harry helpfully slides the beaker into Malfoy’s empty hand.
“Tomorrow?” Draco repeats, mentally scrolling through his very empty social calendar. “Well Potter, it’s your lucky day. I just so happen to have an open slot in my busy schedule for you. Shall we meet by the Great Hall after breakfast? Say, eleven?”
“Well if it’s legal, then you won’t mind if I bottle every single one of the potions you’re brewing. Just to check, you understand,” Harry says, and reaches into his back pocket to pull out his wallet. He flashes his Auror badge at Malfoy, whose smile doesn’t falter one bit.
On Saturdays, Harry comes in for a quick breakfast, and once he’s done, he lets himself into the back room and taps on the lab door for Malfoy to let him in. Malfoy won’t give him access to the laboratory wards, which he assures Harry that Harry shouldn’t take personally, because no one else has access either. None of the Slytherins bat an eye at the arrangement anymore, not after he and Aiden had a yelling match about it that had nearly brought the shop down one Saturday.
seeing him like this, wrecked and disheveled, love bites on his neck and his pants shoved down around his knees, his cock out and begging for attention.
“Oh. I thought—”
“What have you purchased there today?” One of the Portraits coos when Harry settles back into his table. It’s his least favourite Portrait, one of an elderly lady with a ridiculously huge ruffle fastened around her neck and her hands folded primly in front of her. The brass plate on the bottom of her frame says, very aptly, ‘Portrait of an Old Lady With Folded Hands’. Privately, Harry’s taken to calling her the Queen Elizabeth. She’s the one that all the other Portraits listen to, the one who launches the harshest insults and makes the most customers cry when they have the temerity (or stupidity) to sit beneath her frame.
Adding fuel to his mistrust is that the shop mostly seems to be run by a bunch of younger Slytherins that were below his year in Hogwarts and whom he doesn’t recognise, although they all certainly know who he is. Logically, he knows that not all Slytherins are
“Hi,” Harry says quietly, and is startled when Malfoy gives him a welcoming smile.
Draco shoots Cheng Wu a confused look, who just smiles enigmatically back at him and mouths a silent ‘don’t worry’. They take the lifts down to Minister Shackbolt’s offices, and the lift doors open to miles of corridors of plush carpeting, and an almost oppressive silence. One wall is taken up by a massive row of windows that have been enchanted to overlook the city.
He ups his visits to twice a day: once in the morning before work, and a forty-five minute stakeout during lunch. He’s running out of excuses to turn Ron down for lunch, but that doesn’t deter him. Nothing does, not even when it’s Graham the Grim manning the counter on a Saturday morning. Harry looks forward to Saturdays with a particular kind of thrill that’s normally reserved for when he’s hunting down criminals: Saturdays are when he can stake out the shop for a few hours on the pretext of having his breakfast.
He supposes he shouldn’t really be surprised. Still, as he stands alone in an empty office staring at Potter’s empty desk and chair neatly pushed in, there’s a part of him that can’t help but wonder what went wrong.
“Let’s go see what the Portraits are gossiping about and test how far your heightened senses can reach.”
Harry makes a strangled sound.
“Er—” Harry begins, except that Malfoy keeps going and
“Wow, your house-elf is fast,” Harry says, impressed. “I couldn’t even feel their magic.”
?" Draco says again.
“Wow,” Harry says, but he’s smiling. “Has anyone told you that you’re slightly manic?”
He doesn’t know how he makes it through the next hour with Malfoy bustling around the laboratory, reaching up for things and bending over, while constantly smelling a reminder of Malfoy, but somehow he does. And then they’re done for the day, and Harry quickly makes his excuses and hurries out of the shop and away from everything connected to Malfoy.
Potter this morning, eyes downcast and face shuttered closed, unwilling or unable to even look at him.
“Where did you get it,” Theodore asks for the third time.
“And have you poison me, the only witness to your
The shopkeeper has an amused smile on his face as he rings them up and instructs Harry on how to summon it when it wants it: “Just think of it and it’ll come,” the shopkeeper says. He hesitates, then adds a little bit too quickly, “or at least it should anyway. Dragons have a mind of their own, you know, and they’re not easily tamed. Not even miniature ones like these.”
“Why is this our problem, exactly?” was Robards’ exasperated reply when Harry burst into his office, waving the newspaper.
“Did you lot say anything?” he asks, and Queen V titters.
“Yes,” Draco echoes, “so.”
Potter just rolls his eyes at that and doesn’t bother replying, though there’s the hint of a blush on his cheeks. They have just enough time to grab their breakfast to go, and Draco gives in to the inevitable and orders himself two cups of coffee. He hands Potter the second cup while they’re in the lifts back in the Ministry, "so you don’t go around acting as if you’re deprived," and Potter gives him a smile that lights up his entire face. It sends something stirring in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
“No!” Harry exclaims too quickly.
That stops Harry just as he was about to pull out his wand. “I wasn’t going to,” he lies.
“Selling my secrets off to the enemy, Bones?” Malfoy drawls from behind them, and Susan jumps, flushing guiltily. Harry’s ears prick up at the magic combination of ‘secret’ and ‘enemy’, and he turns. Malfoy cuts a tall figure of suspicion as he eyes them, arms crossed against his chest.
“Why didn’t I notice this?” Harry says, more to himself than to Malfoy. He frowns as he tries to replay the events of that day, but he can’t recall the wards going off, and he certainly doesn’t remember Malfoy ever indicating that he was in any way injured, which, he supposes, really says a lot about his observational skills.
, exactly, but intentions of their own.”
Pansy flaps a dish towel at him, but she’s smiling, and once Potter’s divested himself of his truly lengthy scarf and coat, he heads towards the kitchen. Draco watches Potter’s arse over the rim of his glass of Firewhiskey, and therefore misses what Blaise says until Blaise turns around to follow his line of sight, just in time to catch the back of Potter disappearing into the kitchen.
Harry doesn’t realise until he says it, but somewhere along the way, he’s lost the conviction that Malfoy’s
to do so, as you say.” He smiles at Malfoy, certain that he has Malfoy cornered.
Harry stares back at him, puzzled. “Erm,” he says slowly, “
Potter shrugs. "Won’t know till we spring it," he says, but he waits for Draco to make a decision, and this– this is exactly what Weasley was talking about, Potter charging in with no plan except
They’re both silent for a long moment, then Potter says, voice low, "Well, looks like you were right. It is a trap."
Malfoy flushes and doesn’t answer immediately. He tries to cover it by taking a sip of his drink, but there are splotches of pink rising high on his cheeks. “Ah, I didn’t think you’d pick up on that.” He clears his throat several times, and Harry waits him out. Finally, Malfoy says, “Sometimes, the Manor acts in what it thinks is best for the inhabitants of the house. It is not always correct, mind you! But these magical houses tend to have a—well, not a
one of them.”
He comes in the next day expecting Potter to be there, but there’s no one waiting for him. Draco’s surprised to find that he’s a little disappointed, but he doesn’t take it to heart. The meeting is today, and he buries himself in re-reading over the information on the Sun Yee On, a Hong Kong triad with ties that stretch over almost every single continent. They’ve been in operation for over a century, and they’re well-organised, powerful, and ruthless.
into hurting myself! Sexually or otherwise! And it’s
“What?” Malfoy says, rubbing his cheek and getting more ink on it. Then he looks at his hands. “Oh, Merlin’s saggy tits.”
“No,” Malfoy says firmly. “Absolutely not. If it’s a bathtub that you insist on, then fine, let’s head back to mine. Unlike you, I’m absolutely sure that: one, I have a tub, and two, that it’s of an acceptable standard of cleanliness, because
That’s how Potter stumbles over him an hour later: sprawled face down on the staircase, his head turned sideways and resting on the step next to the dragon, watching it sleep. Draco has timed his breathing to sync with the dragon’s, and a hot mist fills the air every time they exhale in tandem.
“Ugh, this is what I get for hiring Hufflepuffs,” Malfoy says, his eyes rolling heavenwards. But despite his annoyance, there’s no heat behind his words. “Well, you’d better treasure this apple, Potter, because it’s the last free one you’re going to get.”
, please.”
, and honestly, Draco’s amazed that Potter’s made it this far. Privately, he thinks that he needs to have a proper talk with Potter about the importance of having a proper plan once this is all over.
“Hello to you too, Potter,” Draco says coolly. “Did you pay for this, or did you count on your fame to get away with free stuff again?”
“Which are?” Harry asks, yanking the door open, and Malfoy blinks at him in an astonished sort of fashion. Harry prompts helpfully, “Your trade secrets, you were going on about them, and just about to spill.”
. Just not exactly the

“You look mental,” Malfoy says as he wipes his eyes. “So, so mental.”
“No, I’ll pass on that drying charm that you’re clearly thinking of, Potter. Have you learnt nothing? Charms like that are far too crude and interfere with my shampoo, and then where would I be? Back to having dry straw for hair, and maybe some people would be fine with that, but I hope you have come to realisation that I am
Draco is not one of them. He ignores Harry in favour of concentrating on what Blaise is saying about brooms and presents, but then gets distracted again when, down the hall, Ginny pokes her head out of the kitchen. She waves a flour-covered hand at Potter, and he grins and blows her a kiss in return, which makes Draco’s heart do a funny little dance to see. Ginny just laughs and ducks back in. She’s replaced by Pansy, who sticks her head around the doorframe to shout, “Harry, did you remember to bring the port that we asked for?”
“Will you show me what you’ve been working on?” Harry asks quietly.
"Tell me what you want," Potter says quietly, still kneeling, still looking up at Draco with something dark and unreadable in his face. The dim wandlight casts long shadows across Potter’s cheekbones, makes them look sharper than they are. He looks almost unnaturally handsome in this light, and Draco has never wanted him more.
They get the warehouse cleaned out in under half an hour, and then they wait. An hour passes, then another. In the end it’s anti-climatic: five goons come strolling in shortly after dawn breaks, clutching cups of coffee and clearly unbothered and unsuspecting. They’ve obviously relied on the wards to do their work for them, and are completely unprepared for the group of wizards waiting for them, or for when they get Petrified one after the other in quick succession.
Beside him, Potter laughs. “Yeah, that happened to me the first time as well,” he says, chuckling. “Sorry, should’ve warned you.”
"Come on, Potter," Draco says, his voice coming out broken, his hands drifting down until they’re nestled in Potter’s messy hair, "get my cock wet with that pretty mouth of yours. You like this, don’t you? Getting down on your knees to suck me off."
"When you are," Draco replies, and links his arm through Potter’s for the Side-Along.
The corridors on the walk back to the dungeons is blessedly empty and quiet for once, except for the occasional creak of metal as the suits of armour shift around. Draco tells Harry how the Slytherins found Peeves trying to possess one once, and how strange it looked, with Peeves trying to make the suit dance and the suit jerkily counteracting all of Peeve’s movements and complaining all the while in its metallic, creaking voice. Harry laughs at the story, and then laughs again when Draco tries to imitate the suit dancing, all the way until they reach the dungeons.
“I was thinking about getting Teddy a racing broom,” Draco improvises. It’s not a lie: that
After a while, Draco comes to the slow, dawning realisation that he'll have to quit. He can’t sit there, day after day, across the table from Potter and not think about how safe he felt in Potter’s arms, while Potter looks away and flinches everytime they accidentally touch each other. As much as he wants to, Draco can’t chalk up that moment in the cupboard to the sheer insanity of the lust potion. That moment has left him too flayed open to be able to lie to himself about it.
? Potter,
Potter knows that this is their secret entrance is right there on the tip of his tongue, but then Potter cleverly distracts him by gently untangling the dragon from his hair, and holds it out. It doesn’t like being separated from its snoutful of hair, and makes its displeasure known by roaring at Potter.
And then Potter’s hands are on him again, deftly pushing him down to the floor as the cupboard door bursts open to a shower of spells, Potter casting madly the moment he gets a clear shot.
They sip their drinks in contemplative silence, until the ball of ice melts and Malfoy finally says, “Potter, I don’t mean to pry, and you’re more than welcome to tell me to fuck off, but do you… do you need any help with Grimmauld Place?” Malfoy sounds tentative, and Harry catches Malfoy sneaking a glance at him over the rim of his glass.
“Oh,” Draco says, delighted, and tries to look at the dragon out of the corner of his eye without turning his head. He can feel the Horntail nuzzling at his ears; feel the scrape of its scales against his ear lobe.
"I’ve been transferred to your Division," Potter says in lieu of a greeting, and Draco stops dead in his tracks and stares at Potter.
“If I tell you, that defeats the purpose of a treasure hunt,” Harry says. Draco scowls at him.
It makes one large circle around Draco’s palm, sniffing suspiciously at Draco’s fingers as they curl protectively over the dragon. The Horntail doesn’t like that, and demonstrates its displeasure by suddenly darting forward and taking a chunk out of Draco’s little finger.
@justletmebeokay prompted: "Sirius and Remus, oh no, there's only one bed..." which is one of my absolute

. I don’t even know what happened. You still owe me answers.”
Malfoy plucks the quill neatly out of his hand and signs as well. As soon as he lifts the quill from the paper, their twin signatures shine golden for a brief moment, so bright that Harry has to squint against the glow. He looks at Malfoy expectantly once it fades away.
Potter looks like he wants to laugh. Draco schools his face into a stony expression, crosses his arms disapprovingly and tsks at him.
Neville and Luna appear in an instant, and Luna just takes one look before she shakes her head. “He needs St. Mungo’s,” she says, digging into her robes and passing Harry a small vial of something viscous and blue. “Two drops into his mouth.”
“He is, yes,” Draco says, watching the dragon flop to the table in an apparent food coma, its lizard eyes half-closed in contentment. “But he always looks as if he’s on the edge of murder. It makes one distinctly uncomfortable to be alone in a room with him. I never quite know if this will be the moment my short life tragically ends with Nott plunging a knife into my back.”
“Wait, what,” Harry interrupts, thunderstruck.

They don’t make it out of the cupboard for quite some time.
, aren’t you? Do the Twiddledees know? What am I talking about, of course they must know. Wait, is it
“Fuck,” Harry says, panic growing in the pit of his stomach. Draco’s face is pale, and his skin is cold and clammy. The poison’s working too fast, and there’s still an assassin in the crowd.
"Well done, ten points to Gryffindor," Draco says dryly over his shoulder, not bothering to turn around. Harry laughs, a soft, pleased sound that sends a warm, prickly feeling rippling through Draco. He ignores it, and keeps his focus on scanning their surroundings.
Harry fully expects that to be the end of whatever friendship he and Malfoy have begun to strike up over the months. He stays away for a couple of days, until he realises that Malfoy might misinterpret that as Harry believing that what he said was true after all. Finally, he steps into the shop on a Friday evening, which is when they’re at their slowest, and is surprised to find Malfoy behind the counter instead.
The Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division is horribly underfunded and understaffed: they’re a tiny Division, but even with their limited numbers they barely fit in the space provided. There are six cubicles crammed into the small space, and every single desk is overflowing with stacks upon stacks of files. Still, despite the mess and the close quarters, it’s cheery enough: Latika had put up some tinsel formed into the shape of a Christmas tree on the spare wall for last year’s Christmas do, and none of them had bothered to take it down again. For New Year’s, David had enchanted it to change colours ever so subtly, and they liked having it slowly rotate through all the colours of the rainbow.
Next to him he heard Draco swallow before he asked. "A fair … and what exactly does that entail?"
That didn't stop him from reaching out, though, his pale fingers hovering over the golden skin of Harry's cheek that he couldn't touch, reddened now from his shouting, from the strain and agitation. And, even as silence once more settled around him after the cruciatus curse was broken and Granger's and Weasley's terrified whimpers were once more hidden behind a privacy spell, he knew that Harry was thinking about killing this man, not with the delusive righteousness of an executioner, but with the despairing hopelessness of someone who didn't have a real choice. Someone forced to commit an unspeakable atrocity for the greater good.
Harry manages to overcome the dagger's power that continues to draw from his magic by pushing it out of his body entirely. He immediately loses consciousness from the ensuing magical exhaustion. Taking the form of a black stag and hundreds of birds his magic tortures and kills everyone present except Taide, who is hurt only when he tries to reach Harry in order to stop the killing spree. Blaise and Draco try to apparate to the manor with the House Elves' help, but it is warded against House Elf apparition. They land somewhere close and Blaise takes Alfar and Draco Giallina and they fly up to the manor. There they find everything destroyed and in ruins, and several corpses burnt beyond recognition. Giallina finds Harry in the middle of a tornado of burning birds and flies towards him (as he sae Taide unconscious but alive in the carnage and theorized correctly that Harry's magic can differentiate between friends and enemies). Blaise, not knowing what Draco does, fears for him and has Alfar attack the birds before Draco can reach them. They scatter and regroup and attack Alfar, killing him, but recognize Blaise as an ally, leaving him mostly uninjured. Meanwhile Draco, trying to help, tries to reach Harry in order to calm him and his magic. He is intercepted by the stag and taken on its antlers but it recognizes him and ceases its attack. With Alfar dead, and Giallina hidden the magical beasts go quiet again. Blaise reaches Harry and recognizing the leech dagger he tries to transfer magic to the other boy. When that doesn't work he puts the emergency portkey on him and Harry is immediately transported back to Britain.
Nonetheless, Draco determinedly forced the images from his mind and told himself to focus: none of this would or could ever happen, if he didn't find a way to set some boundaries to the mating bond. He couldn't be emotionally and mentally naked in front of Harry, he just couldn't.
Then his gaze settled on the wide, curved windows behind the desk on the opposite side of the room, flooding it with golden sunlight. They overlooked the garden he had just left and, as the room itself was parterre, it was unfortunately at the same level with the terrace where Zabini, Malfoy, and himself had just partaken of their noon meal - or not quite, seeing as Harry had left before really eating much; a shame, that. The fruits had been delicious and he was still hungry…
With deliberate slowness, both Zabini and Malfoy stood from their chairs and stepped closer to the mirror. It might have been more intimidating if said mirror had been larger than Lockhart's trashy novels.
Harry's eyes narrowed, as if sensing a trap, unable to believe that it could be so easy. Of course he was right. It was time to find out, whether Blaise's suspicions were correct.
It was the night after his son's engagement party, the night after The Submissive had appeared out of nowhere and fledged - Lucius really couldn't bring himself to speak of the Potter brat by his name and simultaneously think of him as the future bearer of his grandchildren yet; that was ... it was just … gross.
"Still," Tassi insisted, "if the submissive had thought him an enemy, he'd have just been another corpse."
Still, as if his uttered words had provided him with the necessary incitement, Draco recovered his bearings and his expression evened out into a polite mask, still friendly, but closed. Harry almost sighed: obviously he had once again breached some etiquette rule no one had bothered to tell him about. His unrest took shape further, when Draco kept silent and his eyes averted.
And once he was at the top, he wanted Harry Potter to be there with him. He was Draco's, even if the boy didn't know it yet.
In the hospital they have a short hassle with some agitated Weasleys before they are taken to Harry's room by Healer in charge Andrew Cowan and Mediwizard McAuley. They find Harry terrified and confused and generally in a horrible condition, with his wings bound together and his arms and legs tied to the bed, emitting warning calls unconsciously. Infuriated they refuse any hospital staff to accompany them. Then they help Harry regain his senses and take him to Italy.
At least none of them were Gryffindors and could lie in wait for Harry in his dorm or common room where neither Blaise nor Draco could protect him.
“I was asked to come here in order to tend to Potter once they sent him through.” He said. ”They suspected he’d be injured.”
His hands twitched at his side, one with the desperate desire for his wand, one with the need to hide the sudden heaviness of his one and only escape plan – or perhaps to use it? A word fell from his lips, involuntarily and almost too low to be heard, barely more than a gasp. "Three…"
"If I may hazard a guess..."
The way that Adler leaned back, resting his weight with one elbow on the leather padded armrest so he could comfortably brace his chin, had Draco immediately sit up, and he watched with flagrant suspicion as the long-haired man hid his lips with one hand, the thumb under his chin and the forefinger against the septum of his nose. Especially when the elder Malfoy took a deep breath, Draco
Weakly, Severus waved his hand in an indefinite gesture.
Then, his wings were complete, though they were shorter as he remembered them being, Harry thought, with almost neat edges, and sharp tips. And they
And Severus gave her that tiny, insignificant courtesy and remained silent. He was still contemplating what words might calm her in any case.
Pugna aerea was played in groups of three, as Draco explained to him once they had climbed into their chariot: a charioteer steering the Pihassan horse, a scorer who was allowed to attack the players of the other teams with slowing charms that worked for about a minute and the shielder who could throw up shields with a diameter of about two feet to defend their teammates and horse – which  the Battellis apparently counted to their teammates, something Harry only noticed when Tore had slowed down their horse that Harry had left unprotected and he turned to Blaise with an incredulous "can he do that?". After that Draco had switched places with him, making Harry the scorer while taking over the position of shielder. Not that that was necessarily fair but since Harry did enjoy the position of scorer more, he wasn't about to complain.
"Don't get your knickers in a twist, Potter; does this seem as if we tried to harm you in any way?" Malfoy asked with his tell-tale smirk, pointing to the room's luxurious interior with an indefinite sweeping gesture that seemed to include everything and nothing at once, as if he wanted Harry to read into it whatever would be most beneficial for him.
"Mr Potter is not allowed to leave the grounds." He heard Zabini's imperious voice and stiffly and very slowly, he turned. Zabini had stood finally, bracing himself against the tessellated table with both hands, leaning forward menacingly. His hard gaze bore into Harry as he addressed his servants without even sparing them one glance. Next to him, Malfoy watched him with a carefully neutral expression but Harry thought he saw the corner of his mouth twitch suspiciously and that made him want to scream and rant and shout at them.
The pale witch herself was in an unusually dishevelled state and Amalyne took her in with harsh, unflinching eyes, the hastily donned trousers of fine dragon leather that would protect her from carelessly pricking herself on the Damask Roses, the pale blue linen shirt, wrinkled under a grey, tightly fitted vest, also of leather.
Draco didn't ask what his ancestor was talking about. It was clear to him that the other man was referring to Ives' opinion of what had become of the Malfoy name. And of course Draco knew that the little anecdotes that the submissives had shared over breakfast were all too true and that there were neither excuses nor explanations that would make the stories any less atrocious. But one didn't speak of the black pages in the family history – which every family had. Shameful secrets should remain just that: secrets. It had been wrong of Ives to use them to entertain Harry. Was Adler so besotted with his red-haired submissive that he would take his side no matter what? Besides: he hadn't come to Adler for another lesson in humility over their family.
"Well, I of course do not know the dominants in question," Mrs Palmer added for consideration, "and since well over two centuries have passed since the last Vykélari mating, and the society nowadays is much more liberal than it was during that time, this is more something of a worst-case scenario; but generally Mr Potter would be expected to submit himself to a mating without much resistance. He would need to establish the bond himself and share his magic over it. In time, a dominant would expect him to give birth to at least one dominant, male heir to continue the family name. His husband or – as it might turn out in this case – husbands could forbid him to associate with certain groups or individuals that they found to be dangerous and thereby dictate him his circle of friends and they could give certain limits to his job choices as well, even going so far as to forbid him to work at all.
"I wouldn't expect such good manners from a Half-Blood anyway." The comment didn't hold any sting, not from him, not anymore. He had fought hard for Cygnus Malfoy's respect and he knew he had it.
"Harry, how are you, really?" The bushy haired brunette asked, the tightness in her voice betraying her anxiousness.
was wrong with Harry at the moment. But this went further than the trauma he’d gone through. This was… unnatural. Wrong. And it scared him, because Harry
Hermione and Ron might die if he sought out Draco and Blaise for help.
The younger one, Adler, shook his head. "I didn't feel it. I
Harry, though, seemed still too befuddled, too amazed with it all to give it up just yet. Or he was simply still crap at Occlumency. Hadn't Severus told them that the Gryffindor had never mastered the art?
"Yes, signore Tassi?" The minister prompted, when the answer didn't come quickly enough.
“Come on, it’s not as if they would miss us.”
Without those things, he definitely felt better, or at least more familiar, more like himself and he was able to relax a little bit; it seemed that Malfoy and Zabini had not lied to him: he could change back.
He ordered.
There, just past the circular drive, was Harry.
Gryffindor's safety, even if Harry grew to hate him for it. Draco wouldn't force himself to endure the torture of standing back and watching Harry throw himself away, his life, his happiness; Harry couldn't expect him to.
Then Harry turned his gaze upwards and really, he could almost see the slight flicker in the air; in any case he could feel them if he concentrated enough: A persistent pressure that prickled against his skin, that caused him to recoil. The wards. Which he wasn't allowed to pass. Which he had been
Uselessly, Harry's hand clenched around the thin air at his hip where his wand should have been. The emptiness made his stomach churn uncomfortably. It wouldn't be the first time he'd have to face a potential threat unarmed, though.
Damn it, didn't he ever
The rage he felt over that injustice filled his very being, ripping through his chest like a knife, squelching every voice of caution and thusly loosening his tongue until words spilled forth that never would have left his mouth if not for the combined agitation at this whole fraught situation and the Italian's harsh words.
So all-consuming and cold was the fear that took him that Draco whipped around unthinkingly, expecting to see his lover’s dying body fall from the sky, a shadow against the stars framed by the gleaming copper of his wings…
Everything fell into place then, snippets of long forgotten conversations and texts he had read at some point or another assembling to form a whole, like the pieces of a puzzle once their frame was complete and their layout known.
As it obviously did Harry. From the look of it, the brunet was still trying to process all that had been said and slowly, Blaise's own conscience was starting to make itself felt. He knew of Harry's past with the press, of course, who didn't? And he also knew that despite being the damned Saviour of the Wizarding World (multiple times at that), the Gryffindor Golden Boy was rather self-conscious. God, he still remembered his discomfort and clumsiness in those horrible meetings of the Slug Club… the few times Harry had been there at all.
Then suddenly the grin diminished as Harry turned serious again. "And you really needn't worry about me: My whole childhood and a good portion of my youth was sacrificed for 'the greater good'. This is my life now and I won't let myself be pressured into doing something I really don't want."
It certainly wasn't anything dramatic, nothing that most people would find suspicious or remarkable anyway. But in a manner it was like the sudden cacophony of flapping and screeching caused by a startled flock of birds that might or might not herald a lethal, hunting beast.
than heard. And within a moment he had wriggled his hand out of Blaise's loose grasp and taken a step back.
A wizard with those genes will not always transform however, although the genes themselves are dominant. That is because the transformation itself is very exhausting and a weak wizard would not survive the rebuilding of his magical core. The genes therefore only activate when the wizard has a chance to survive."
"Yes, of course." Blaise smiled indulgently and laid his arm around Draco's shoulder, squeezing shortly to reassure the blonde that he knew what he was doing. "I will arrange for a meeting. Let us say the day after tomorrow?"
Suddenly, Harry went still and Draco could see the muscles of his stomach and his ribcage working, drawing in a deep breath, then another as if in preparation for a great exertion before Harry reared up, bending his torso backwards so that he was facing away from his captor. In the same moment the green wings spread away from him, starting to beat even before they were fully grown.
Valerio might be dead and gone but they would not grant him any kind of victory, would not let him have any part of Harry, least of all his life. That was not something they’d let him claim!
And seeing Piero's exuberant joy at having won would be worth quite a few losses. That and the Slytherin's excuses had been growing much more colourful and, well, absurd (and therefore entertaining) by the minute.
Damn it, not now! This couldn't be happening just now!
"I know," Draco smirked, "that's why I did it."
But against all his hopes, the magical tools had not given any proof to the cussedness of their owners. On the contrary. After dousing them with a potion designed to prolong the effects of a Prior Incantato, and watching a long line of phantom images that replayed the latest spells performed in reverse order, Ettore had to admit that there not only was no evidence for any kind of abuse, but that in fact everything indicated to the three British Vykélari being in a consensual relationship. At least, it seemed as if they were courting or dating.
For a moment Narcissa felt her knees go weak. She could have sunken to the ground as the heavy tenseness fled from her limbs. It was as if someone had cut a too tightly laced corset from her body after she had worn it for years, only to realise that she didn't have the strength to keep herself upright on her own. But by Merlin, each breath was free and sweet, because her son was alive!
Of course that didn't excuse his behaviour, but in time Draco would understand and forgive his father, even if Narcissa had to mediate between her family for a while.
"I really hate to say this, but neither the headmistress, the minister, the guardia nor the Aurors will be inclined to be accommodating if you came along, not with your history. Besides you cannot even speak Italian!"
They were mad! Utterly insane! He was no submissive whatever that meant, he couldn't be. And why the hell would other males try to mate with him anyway? Especially purebloods? There was no better way to end a bloodline than to marry someone who was unable to bear children. It didn't make sense that they would, and even if they were: he had escaped Voldemort's supporters, he would always escape.
It didn't interest Harry, not really, though he generally disliked such power plays. His eyes only hushed over the luxurious furnishings and rested for a moment on the burning fireplace that seemed to be magically partitioned off from the rest of the room as it was not radiating any warmth.
Suddenly the fire was back in the leaf green eyes, in his posture and the way he carried himself and Harry looked up and crossed his arms, stubbornly and defiantly staring at them. "I won't witness for your father or…"
Maybe it had something to do with the grim silence of his fiancé, with how fiercely the Italian looked ahead, his jaw set and the ligaments of his throat protruding.
But now the article really became interesting. Crane undeniably used the Mediwizard's statement to affiliate Harry's plight to the ruthlessness and power of purebloods. 'Purebloods can't keep on trampling over the rights of everyone else just because their families forged the laws and political structures our society is build up on now to their advantage.' She wrote there.
"This is so clever, Harry. She didn't even come here to interview anyone, knowing that we would become liable to prosecution if we even admitted that you were a submissive Vykélari. The Mediwizard she interviewed remained anonymous and I doubt that his colleagues would rat him out, not after the way this article will influence the public. And that historian does not really know if you are a Vykélari or not, her information is given only hypothetically and on hearsay. So the only one that Crane woman endangered is herself and after making you the tragic hero, the public would become a lynch mob if Lucius Malfoy tried to turn her in. As it is, I don't think he'll be acquitted in his trial after all. His reputation won't recover in time and now every pair of eyes will be directed towards the Wizengamot. They just cannot afford to let him off easily now... this changes everything, Harry!"
And with that she stepped forward, gathering her dress. "It is such a beautiful night, let us speak in the garden." But from the way she pulled the front door to the Manor close behind her, it was obvious that she merely didn't wish Blood Traitors to pollute her home.
Adler admits to Draco that he used Severus Snape's spying potion on Harry, so that all his memories are copied into a Pensieve. Using this Pensieve, Draco sees Harry's memories of the date and realises that all three of them were about to fall for each other. He witnesses Harry being blackmailed by an unknown (probably polyjuiced) man and how he tortures Harry's friends. While he can't really reason Harry's whereabouts from that memories, he is confident that once he reaches the fresher ones from after Harry left the manor, they will probably reveal where he has been brought to. Meanwhile Blaise tries to convince some of his Italian acquaintances, including the Battellis, to help them, but they refuse out of fear of Blaise's relatives.
Amalyne welcomed the crisp cool and quiet, felt it sharpening her hearing, her very awareness, the reduced impressions of her other senses heightening her alertness until she felt that every single thought was precise and clear. It broke her fear and worry down to a manageable level so that she could look at her family's safe house with a cool head while she waited for Narcissa to arrive, instead of trying to barge in without so much as ascertaining that it was still uncompromised.
"I think we should strive to mate him." Blaise deadpanned, really not having the patience right now or the nerves to be more subtle.
Annoyed, Harry swatted at them, leaving it to Draco to keep himself from being scratched. This was really taking too many liberties.
When they had finally returned to the beach, Harry had felt rather exhausted from swimming for so long and he was glad when he felt the sand under his dripping feet again. But he had decidedly rejected the concerned offers for support when he had dragged himself towards the three sun loungers that the house elves had brought and gratefully sank down on the fluffy towel that covered one of those on the side.
"Well, to put it in a nutshell, no, you haven't." Ron said but Hermione leaned forwards even more, her eyebrows practically invisible beneath her bushy hair.
And damn it, the room was warded against apparition … except for the house elves.
"Come on
The liquid was cool upon his skin but oddly dry and insubstantial, more like cold, thick air than any substance he knew, but at the same time it enfolded his fingers tightly like water and when he carefully sent his magic forth, feeling out the patterns and streams within, the silver thoughts swirled and danced merrily – danced for him. They felt oddly familiar, like a magical signature that he knew by heart and suddenly he realised with a shocking clarity, his pulse fluttering like a dying bird and his throat closing up, that this mass of liquid silver was the only token left from their time together; if they failed, he might never again have more of Harry than these memories, these fragile, fleeting, wispy ghosts, pathetic images of lost dreams that would never have a chance of being repeated, that would fade over the years to come until Draco would never be sure any more what had really happened and what his mind had orchestrated to comfort and entertain him. These were more precious than his own memories, though, because they were filled with Harry's lively spirit, his bright emotions, his own sensations – and he was nearly overcome with the greed to have them, especially if he should never have anything more.
"Oh, Draco, no. I mean yes, but no." Harry blinked, maybe he should order his thoughts before speaking. "Well, I mean I know that many of the rumours came from you, but damn it, so many of the wizards were stupid enough to listen to the prattling of a fourteen year old teenager! No offence." He added as an afterthought. "But your lies were just so obvious…"
Blaise shook his head. "I don't want a repeat performance of yesterday, but I have to say this: You won't be able to settle down with Ginevra Weasley or with any other woman. They will not let you."
That still didn't make it any easier, knowing his fiancé was undergoing such torture, knowing that Harry was
the brat had his undivided attention.
"Oh, be quiet!" Narcissa said before turning to her son and soon-to-be son-in-law with a smile.
Right next to him, Blaise's lips curled into a trace of a snarl and he drawled a "No" at the blonde man in the mirror, deliberately letting his annoyance bleed into his voice. After all, merely two days ago all of them had agreed that it would be better to court their submissive gently instead of pressuring him and he had vowed in front of all of them that he'd never force Harry.
"I'm not your guest, though." The brunet pressed out, and really wasn't that the core of all the disputes between him and the two dominants? That he was indeed their captive and had no choice at all, no matter if it concerned staying at the manor or interacting with them or having them teach him.
Blaise raised one hand in a placating manner. "Don't feel obliged to do so, Harry. But if you have questions you don't feel comfortable asking us, Ives, being a submissive himself, would surely be able to help you."
Therefore, Blaise carefully reached out to squeeze his lover's, his fiancé's hand. "I nonetheless should have been there."
It was the 9th of July, 1998, just a few days past the two-month mark after the Battle of Hogwarts, as wizards and witches in all of Britain had already started to call it in the euphoria that drowned the wizarding community after the Dark Lord’s fall.
"But why did it happen?"
Whether that meant that a Malfoy would never willingly indulge in such behaviour or that he could not because it would harm the praised Malfoy reputation and (therefore) pride beyond repair, he didn't specify. But he didn't need to, either; Blaise knew that it was a bit of both ... but to an astoundingly large proportion the latter. It was always a source of amusement to him that his prim and proper fiancé, Draco Malfoy, pureblood heir of such an illustrious family, was just as much a pervert as everyone else, even though he usually pretended to be so superior and sovereign.
Apparently the Wizengamot thought that idea to be ingenious and immediately passed a law that stated that every wand needed to be charmed with the Wespenzauber. It might have even been an improvement to the security in Britain, if not for the fact that the common wizard did not trust in the Ministry to protect them any longer.
Draco blinked in disgust at himself but still couldn't help but let his eyes roam freely over the half-naked form laid out in front of him, taking in the lines drawn in the same emerald colour as the markings on his face that trailed over his naked, pale sides in elegant, arcing curves; starting above his ribcage and running down his sides, along his slender waist, crossing themselves playfully to vanish … somewhere beneath the waistband of horribly washed-out jeans that he really shouldn't think about.
respect him and he wanted his name to be recognized not only by their pureblood circles but by those of mixed blood also who were now starting to gain the upper hand after the war. Draco wanted his family not only to survive those changes but thrive in them.
"Stop that..." he moaned.
Only one false answer to any of these questions might shatter it all. And that made him feel uncomfortably vulnerable.
Draco snorted softly, bitterly disbelieving, but said nothing and even if he or Blaise had known what to say, it was to be doubted that they would have gotten the chance, seeing as Harry grasped both of their sleeves and forced them to a sudden halt in the long stretched corridor.
"God, Blaise, untie me!"
But he should probably not judge him for that, these were somewhat extraordinary circumstances right now and Potter had only his tactile sense to guide him. He remembered that phase of his own transformation well, how irritating he had found it; but he had known what was happening with him and hadn't been afraid. The Wizarding World's saviour was probably entitled to some irrational fear and doubt at the moment.
"Fine, then. I'll ask her but maybe she won't agree, Harry. You have to understand that she obviously put herself in danger in order to get this article printed. The only thing standing between her and a charge from Malfoy is your image as the tragic hero in need of saving."
With a certain satisfaction Blaise watched their submissive leap to their defence. Such a fierce sense of justice, what a strong personality.
. Why was it his fault now? If they didn’t want to hear him out, why did they bring it up in the first place?
“He almost died, Narcissa.” He continued with a softer, more serious voice, their gazes meeting for a few moments over the still body between them. ”He must have been unconscious for a while before the portkey was put on him. Just in time, I'd say.”
After that dive, it took Harry forever to calm down enough to even take note of his surroundings again let alone take part in the lunch that Draco and Blaise had brought along in shrunken packages.
"Do you like them?" Blaise smiled widely at him, already knowing the answer.
Slowly, he straightened up in one smooth movement, his spine stretching one vortex after the other, his shoulders squaring in proud defiance, his chin raising at last.
"I know how your hands wander when you
Half of the page's surface was covered with a collage of three images, the left one showing that awful photograph of Lucius Malfoy in the rough attire of an Askaban prisoner that had been published in this very newspaper only two years before. It did not bode well that the article's author had chosen this specific picture, for every reader would forcefully be reminded of the Malfoy patriarch's history as a Death Eater; a not very subtle attempt to further discredit a man who was already treading on more than thin ice where the public's goodwill was concerned.
And behind him the vulture like man in the mirror swung his wand-arm back as if he were cracking a whip, a maniacal, gleeful grin on his face; Harry could see him aim and his entire being just stopped for that one horrible second. As the crimson light sprung forth from the tip of that thin wood, Harry jumped up mindlessly, abandoning his hostage and running, rushing desperately towards the mirror, his magic breaking from his chest dashing against the shiny surface, reaching for it, trying to follow the mirror's magic along the connection to its counterpart.
Determined, Harry reached out into the direction where he had heard Blaise’s voice coming from, feeling for him. His wrist was grasped though, before he had encountered anything but thin air.
Anyway, it was probably of no importance right now; there were more pressing matters to attend to.
"Narcissa…" She said hesitantly, speaking slowly with carefully chosen words, "it might be better if you stayed here and secured Potter for Blaise and Draco. Let me deal with my late husband's family and the guardia."
. And he could pull it forth and unleash it purposefully just as quickly, yield it like a weapon to enable himself to do things he'd never thought himself capable of.
That only left to prove that it was mutual, Blaise thought as he considered Harry, who was growing serious again in front of his eyes as he locked his intense green eyes on Draco.
Contrarily, it was the greatest reassurance that Severus was able to give her under the circumstances and Narcissa was smart enough to recognize it, to look at the few puzzle pieces she had been given and see the rough outlay of the entire picture.
Next to him, Draco squeezed his forearm soothingly and answered a little bit guiltily for both of them. "I'm afraid, we could have handled it better."
That didn't mean he wasn't afraid or didn't wish there was another, an easier way. But there wasn't and that knowledge burned in his throat and made his hands tremble and sweat.
“Was it even true?” she spat, her anger gaining more momentum, and she let the basket fall to the ground with the loud clinking and rattling of glass bottles, only to reach into her pocket and pull out the crumbled remains of a piece of paper that she flung at him.
Startled Harry looked up from where he stood not three metres away from the door to his study, encountering Blaise's tall form, the dark eyes regarding him concernedly. How long had he been standing there? It surely couldn't have been more than a few moments at the most…
"I am. All my senses returned and I only had a bad case of magical exhaustion afterwards but Draco and Blaise said that was normal."
He had never been away from the British Islands before and this … this was peaceful and serene and beautiful and exotic and … and as he looked at the bight and the endless sea beyond it he found he really loved that cerulean blue.
"Just 'somewhere'." Potter said, tartly. "What do you care, anyway?"
To his astonishment, his father pulled forth his wand and with a harsh gesture he levitated an issue of the Daily Prophet from one of the side tables towards the mirror, so rapidly that it clashed against it with an audible thud, the front page pressed flush against the reflective surface.
Even though he had never taken an active role in the Second Wizarding War or the events leading up to it aside from the one incident in the Ministry of Magic that had led to his imprisonment. And Harry knew that the Death Eaters that day hadn't been as vicious, as deadly as they could have been towards a few children, otherwise, frankly, they all would have been killed. But that might have been because Voldemort didn't want Harry to be murdered by anyone but him, and for the sake of keeping the prophecy safe and whole. In any case the fact remained that Lucius Malfoy had escaped justice far too many times.
. At least, while there, Harry wouldn't be forced into a mating.
Then Malfoy shook his head slightly and continued. "Not an animal. I also dislike the term creature. We are human magical beings and therefore allowed to use wands just like wizards and have the same laws, well except those for mating, there are some additional rules and some liberties we may presume because of Vykélari mating habits. Not that they were enacted during the last 200 years…"
"That is good to hear." Draco said calmly, inwardly relieved and pleased beyond measure, almost as if someone had cast a cheering charm on him. Of course, he knew that this was only one of many, yet unsolved problems he was facing and also that he could not always keep the connection closed - he even suspected that for the bond to function properly they would have to actively keep it open from time to time; but there was the
Taide was alive because the Gryffindor’s rampaging magic had recognized his aura, remembered it belonging to someone who had helped him, who didn’t wish him ill. Therefore, while it had made sure he wouldn’t interfere, it had not harmed him past that point… he was untouched by fire and even in the fumes he was breathing without difficulty it seemed.
“He’s not… I can’t transfer magic to him.”
And all the while those images and sensations popped up in front of his mind's eye like flashes of a dream.
Releasing a deep breath as silently as possible, Blaise relaxed his posture and lowered his shoulders, softening the tenseness oozing from every pore of his being.
"I don't want you to leave either." The words were breathed against Harry's ear, tickling and almost succeeding in making him squirm. "I want you to stay here and let us help you."
Just letting Blaise finish his little speech, Draco took his hand and, with a last glare at his parents and Blaise’s mother, he tugged his olive-skinned fiancé into the direction of the reception room and the fire-place there, without so much as a glance back at their guests. He was positively seething.
"What, Ferret? Need your lover to defend you now?" The Weasel sneered, foolishly ignoring his girlfriend, ogling Draco and Blaise's elegant dress robes, probably in pure envy. "Someone hexed your balls off? Didn't think that you'd miss them, bloody ponce!"
For a moment Harry wondered if he should tell the git to take his hands off his body, but after a moment's contemplation that didn't seem worth the effort it would take him to form the words. And it started to feel … better: Harry had no idea what the two Slytherins were doing but gradually the overheated feeling of his skin receded until the aching of his muscles was at least bearable and the nausea a mere echo. A relieved sigh escaped his lips and he closed his eyes again, enjoying the remission of his pain.
Still, Blaise himself very well knew that the outcome of such a confrontation was more than just uncertain. He himself was no experienced fighter and Draco would probably be busy enough trying to keep Harry from handing himself over.
And as if to prove it – his independence and his stubborn will – and of course, to show off a little bit as well as sating his own nagging curiosity at what he looked like, he demanded his magic to answer to him and bring forth all the other Vykélari traits that he hadn't allowed his body to show since the full moon. With a lazy head-shake, silky, emerald feathers burst through his thick, black locks, as if they had hidden beneath and between his tresses and the single shaking of his head had made them fall from their hiding places and reveal themselves. They mussed up his hair even further, disrupting what little order he and a brush had enforced on them earlier that morning, and made the skin on his head tingle pleasantly with the magic that had gathered there and from the new physical presence of each feather.
"But then again," Draco continued, his voice hardening to cold steel for but a moment even though his expression remained carefully pleasant "the hypocrisy of that Mediwizard blaming us for supposedly mistreating Harry after the way they handled him in St. Mungo's is nothing less than rich. And the irresponsible attempt to set off a movement that would lead to more power being handed to the ministry directly after we saw in the Second Wizarding War that the power structures within the ministry are too open for abuse should at least keep us all in suspense for the next few weeks – or years if Crane is successful."
Still he refrained from voicing the obvious consequences of the effects of a bonding. There was after all something like too much and too blunt honesty and right now it would do none of them much good if they kept dwelling on concerns that might never come true the way they now thought they would.
More and more details appeared, and Harry stared and stared, unable to look away as the dark shadows in the eye areas formed into elaborate, half-translucent masks covering the brows and cheekbones; pale white gold crowning Malfoy’s silver eyes and dark bronze lining Zabini’s pools of onyx. Both masks were decorated with swirls of lighter or darker shades; Harry had never seen anything like this.
“Hello Narcissa.” He said quietly and had the dubious pleasure of watching the witch's usually so impassive face draw into a truly impressive sneer.
"To begin with, Harry, it is your fault that you were not given more information. If I remember correctly, you were the one to run away before we had the chance to tell you more" Draco drawled, his voice like ice, cold and hard and relentless. "So don't you dare accuse us now!"
It wasn't the delicate beak of a falcon, or the strong elegant one of an eagle or even the useful tool of a crow. No, if anything, theirs could be likened to the beak of a vulture, with what seemed to be one large nostril stretching through the horn and bone from one side to the other.
It was not as if he expected a warm reception.
For a moment, Harry was simply and utterly shocked. His stomach churned so violently from the sudden drop that he felt unable to breathe for a moment or two and he pressed himself against Blaise’s body as flatly as he could, reeling from the intensity of the experience as the two Slytherins turned the three of them around so they plummeted headfirst towards the foothills, gaining speed with every second.
Blaise wasn’t even sure he knew the name of the young Elf taking him side-along, but its magic felt strange to him, wild and untamed as it encompassed him with a whirl of colours, much like a regular apparition, but even more dizzying and unsettling – though maybe that discomfort rooted in that disturbing feeling of utter helplessness crawling through him, nourished by his need to
But still, he shrugged with a for-your-sake expression and let the matter rest. Merlin, he was tired of fighting.
, because rage he could drown in dark pools of ice, could ignore even easier than fear and terror, to plan and scheme and keep a leveled head and do what was goddamn
Severus did not even dare to imagine how the Vykélari’s magic might react to offensive spells being thrown around in his vicinity.
His head held high, Draco turned towards Harry once more "Of course that would normally include the study, too. If you want to, we could have the portrait brought to one of the parlours…"
"Wonderful news..."  Hermione grinned at him over the newspaper.
Before Harry even had the chance to look up or prepare himself for the familiar lurch of side-along apparition that always left him feeling queasy and disoriented, the man had tightened his hold on his arm and the darkness around them dissolved into a flurry of whirling colours and lights.
"That's it!" Draco said with evident eagerness. "Now you are properly equipped. And so we finally get to the fun part: the flying." Draco harrumphed slightly and automatically Blaise and Harry raised an equally exasperated look.
For now it crouched as if it wanted to climb down from its pedestal, the claws of one large hand already deeply embedded in the front side, and its long, spike covered dragon-tail wound around the stone as if to stabilise itself during its descend.
The submissive. Someone like Harry.
"Oh, you didn't mean it like that?" Draco raised his eyebrows and tilted his head, a hint of mocking tinging his voice and Blaise had never heard it like this, so full of bitterness and hurt and accusation. Then it picked up both in passion and in volume and he stood again, unable to stay seated on the bed.
A mere moment later the gargoyle rose from its crouched position and Amalyne fell back and retreated a few steps. Intently the two women watched as the claws of its paw tore themselves away from the hidden door and its long dragon-tail uncurled from the socle, slithering back into the darkness. Clefts appeared in the previously seamless rock and a narrow but tall door slid open with the sound of stone grating upon stone, revealing a narrow staircase spiralling ever downward, illuminated by a flickering orange glow as if from dozen of candles.
Just like the snitch when it was only a few meters away…
Slowly the dark skinned Italian turned around, an oddly neutral expression fixed on his face but just like a filigree masquerade mask, it didn’t manage to hide what lied beneath: a kind of hopeful anticipation that lit his eyes from dark chocolate to honey amber, softening his angular face.
"Such a touching love-story..." Amalyne pondered with a hint of derisiveness, her gaze wandering over both her son and son-in-law, and Blaise knew his reaction was closely monitored and judged as she spun her web of lies around them. A black widow, indeed.
But neither did he want the brunet mindless, a slave to his magic, so instead he hastily pulled it back into his body with a conscious effort, letting it seep away into his wings like water into sand, but the feathery appendages he left where they were folded around Harry's body.
"Those are storybook symptoms of a submissive Vykélari transformation," confirmed Jennifer Palmer, renowned historian and scion of the Brown family, who specialized on the history of pureblood families in Britain, France and Germany. But since there are several differences in the appearance and powers of submissive and dominant Vykélari, and submissives were thought to be extinct, the Healers remained with their first diagnosis. "I suppose they were understandably hesitant to go to the responsible authority" admitted Mrs Palmer, a justified guess since all Vykélari related matters are to be put forth to the head of the Vykélari community, who until this day is none other than Lucius Malfoy, known Death Eater whose trial is still expected at Monday, the 27th of July. "Just imagine it! The Boy-Who-Lived in the hands of a former Death Eater..."
But she halted at the door and threw him a look over her shoulder, her eyes blazing as she saw him observing her.
It was only a dim ray of hope, but when had that ever stopped Harry? Of course agreeing to a risky act of recklessness like this would look like nothing short of an act of desperation, but then, Harry was desperate. At least if he did this, he could honestly claim that he had tried everything. And fortune favoured the brave.
The healers fear he won’t survive the night. You can repay your debt by bringing him here: between you and Blaise, you should be able to control and guide his raging magic and keep it from lashing out against everyone else.”
And then there was the fact that his father would usually hold mirror-meetings in his study and not in the parlour the foursome currently occupied. Though Draco guessed that might have something to do with the amount of portraits hanging on the far wall, there would never have been space enough for them in his father's study, stuffed with book shelves as it was. Merlin, there must have been more than a dozen pictures of varying sizes…
"He is rejecting his inheritance!" Blaise pressed out, resting his chin on his arms that were folded on the edge of the spacious pool. Draco watched him with a grimace, seeing the way the Italian's jaw muscles worked tensely. That must
What a heady feeling, all that magic vibrating within him, waiting to be used, clamouring for it!
"You did
"Always turn into the headwind!" he said, the huge appendages flapping almost lazily, the muscles flexing with well-practiced ease as he prepared to take off. The fabric of the shirt he still wore and which he had magically cut two slits into to make room for the two new limbs, stretched with every movement, every steady beat of is wings.
"These are the last seven Malfoys who mated with submissive Vykélari and of course their husbands." Lucius answered with a self-congratulatory half-smile. "I thought we might as well leave the mirror-connection open so that you can consult them whenever you have a question concerning your charge. How is he, by the way?"
Malfoy cocked his head, his gaze boring into Harry. "They are not related to you."
They were blessed enough to have escaped an arranged marriage, and be allowed to be with the one they loved. Their relationship had not always been easy, as Blaise and Draco were naturally dominant – not only because of their heritage – but they had been coping just fine. Forcing an unwilling third partner into a mating bond might destroy all the peace they had fought for and they were not too keen on the strife that was bound to erupt if they didn’t keep a tight leash on the submissive, which was not at all what they wanted.
And how Draco was enjoying his very not-emasculated lover wasn't a visual he really needed to have, Harry thought as he palmed his scarlet face, the sound of Blaise slapping Draco's arm a satisfying and welcome distraction.
"Maybe." Harry said, not quite successfully hiding his grimace. "I think you are right about the thing with changing something and complaining about it and knowing the difference and it is time someone started to do something about all those problems. But me? I really can't see myself working as a ministry official."
In either case, only someone who had already been made into the prey of the cruellest, most heinous monsters hunting in the Forbidden Forest really learned to react to such an early warning signal – whether it still occurred in that accursed forest or a small piece of woodlands or a marketplace – with a momentary freezing, a mental shutdown after which, if the threat proved real, one panicked and fled mindlessly; but there were also those whose existence reduced itself to logic and cold blooded reason in such a situation – a mind running at full speed – processing the never ending influx of information from adrenaline heightened senses.
Immediately Potter's form, frozen in the same position in which the stasis spell had caught him, slackened, sinking into the soft mattress. His chest moved with the first breath he had taken in almost an hour, a small fluttering like from a dying chicklet.
It was no wonder, that Harry had seemed so approachable today, that he had yielded so easily. He was playing his part so that eventually he could flee from Blaise and Draco. By Morgaine, how could a Gryffindor sustain a charade that encompassing, acting the whole day long… if he wasn't so angry with Ives, he might have been able to admire that feat favourably with the appropriate attentiveness. Right now, though, he was ... not amused, to put it lightly.
But after a few failed attempts, and much frustration on Harry's part, he managed to really leave the ground of the roof garden for the first time.
But nonetheless he couldn't help but wonder if Hermione was right and Crane would refuse to publish Harry's statement. And did he even have the right to ask this favour of her, when she had ventured so much for him and she might end up in prison for it?
Bewildered at the seemingly disjointed statement, Blaise raised a questioning eyebrow at the younger submissive. "Pardon?"
Subconsciously he made a step towards the door, intrigued. This was an Italian summer:  hot and dry; and that meant that this fire was not lit for the purpose of warming.
"I never questioned, never doubted that you'd be there for me, if I needed you." He finally said. It was the truth, though Blaise had rarely thought about it, confident in his ability to overcome most of his problems himself. 'Please believe me…'
It was a necessary lesson for all of them, another challenge that Blaise was now confident they could live up to; they could do it now, they
Idly, Blaise wondered if Potter knew that he could ask for quite literally anything short of taking a life - Draco's or someone else's. Probably not, or he would have used the debt to make them give him a portkey back to Britain.
Granted, he and Draco didn't really know that much about submissives aside from the fact that they were very powerful and very desired. It had never been an issue after all as they had never expected to actually
"I'm not… I didn't…" Blaise fell silent when he realised how badly he was stuttering, how at a loss for anything to say he was. The genuine, passionate outrage that had literally exploded into his face had stunned him beyond reason.
Pressing his tongue against the smooth row of his teeth, Draco tried to rein in his irritation. "I don't have time for your peculiarities, Adler!" He snapped. "You know what just happened outside. I need you to tell me everything that might even remotely pertain to Harry's current whereabouts."
The situation might have escalated, had not Narcissa intervened at that moment, her calm, authoritative voice slicing through the boiling atmosphere. "Lucius! They do not know."
Viewed in this light he should maybe search for another term to call bloodtraitors: maybe they had just anticipated these changes decades before the traditionalists, which then would be a truly commendable example of forethought, instead of the atrocious betrayal of pureblood values that his father had always declared it as. Although Draco doubted that something else than pure love for all things muggle had turned Harry's Weasleys from the 'path of virtue'.
He shuddered and began his struggles anew, weakly at first and nowhere near as desperate or as panicked as before, but still: he’d be damned if he let them molest him just like that!
Exploiting that defencelessness, the young Gryffindor jumped up nimbly, throwing himself onto his liberator, straddling his waist, his knees ramming painfully into the downy feathers, fragile bones and strong muscles with bruising force, making the man groan out and convulse in pain. Harry almost cringed – he hadn't wanted to hurt him – but he didn't allow himself to be distracted and before Taide had even managed to get the dirt out of his eyes, Harry had his deadly talons at his throat, gleaming with cold sharpness and sizzling poison in the dark night, threatening the fragile skin that moved with each swallow, each too fast heartbeat.
Now, after securing the Manor as best as they could, Draco and Blaise had only one more thing to do in their attempt to take care of the factors that made Harry vulnerable; a last precaution which, to Draco's endless irritation, pertained fully to Harry's friends.
For a moment, nothing happened and only Harry’s rapid panting permeated the cool air in the hospital room, before Harry reared up, pressing back against Malfoy’s chest, gritting his teeth against the unbearable itching in the back of his eyes where his magic re-grew his retina.
"Still in denial, I'm afraid." Blaise said with a sigh. "We had a small … incident … yesterday. Upon hearing that he was a submissive he lost it and tried to escape the manor via the floo connection."
Most grotesque of it all was the misshapen head, with the harsh contours of a dragon that someone had forcefully pressed into the form of an ape skull. Too short was it, too broad; but covered with scales and with longer and sharper teeth than even a baboon possessed. It displayed them well too, it's large mouth frozen in a fearsome, never-ending snarl.
It was very unlikely. With the wards still unbroken the only ones who could have entered were Severus and the bearers of the emergency portkeys. As the former had retreated to Spinner's End and Narcissa knew that her son and son-in-law never took off the invisible bracelets, she didn't allow herself to entertain the hope that it might all be some cosmic misunderstanding.
He was a Gryffindor with Slytherin tendencies, suppressed but there, and ready to apply himself like a Hufflepuff and intelligent enough to be a Ravenclaw, even though he often seemed to refuse learning when he didn't see a practical utility, which probably related to a gryffindorish/hufflepuffish Ravenclaw. He was the heir of a pureblood family who was a halfblood and a muggleborn by upbringing. He knew nothing about what it really meant to be what he was and yet, he instinctively understood certain concepts that were the foundation of old wizarding families and the world Harry would now live in, willingly or not. Even the age old principle of vengeance and family honour and loyalty. He didn't like them, but in the end he would understand and learn to accept what he couldn't change while changing whatever he could…
His eyes flitted towards his fiancé and there must have been some form of silent communication between them, because Blaise gave a curt nod before standing himself and pulling Harry to his feet. "I'll accompany you to your rooms."
That determination stirred his magic and it felt like a burning, living entity within him, grim and unyielding, churning in his veins as if it wanted to split him open and burst forth so that it could take over.
Laughing, Blaise shook his head and pulled his lover closer. "I was so angry…"
They had objectified a great young man as a powerful tool, marginalized him in the worst way possible. The consequences of their actions were equally real as they were tragic and the horrifying sense of rightness suffusing this screwed kind of justice burned hotly through his throat.
Alfar’s shrill cries still echoed in Blaise’s mind even after the small body had vanished in a flurry of burning wings and dagger-like talons and beaks as if he never had been.
That in itself didn't sound so bad at all but Harry really couldn't believe that Draco and Blaise would simply allow him to pursue whatever goal he wished to achieve. It was more likely that they would try to use him for their own interests.
It took another couple of panicked, tense seconds before Narcissa finally noticed the slight rise and fall of the boy’s chest. She breathed out a sigh of relief, her eyes fluttering close. Her free hand rose automatically to press down on her chest, as if it could contain the furious beating of her heart.
"Stop!"
"I … thank you."
Harry's arms flew out to encompass his chest as if he could hold in the powerful force, because it would slaughter Taide as well, and it was wrong and it would not reach the man holding Hermione and Ron captive, leaving them at the mercy of someone who had been ordered to kill them if anything went awry.
And the fact that they were asking Pansy to give up her mirror, when she
The grip on his forearms loosened and he was being led forwards a bit, away from the wall so that whatever was sprouting out of his back wasn’t cramped up anymore. Harry almost sighed in relief, he would have, too, had not slender fingers at that very moment started to push down his jeans once more; only on the right side of his hip and just enough to bare the angry scratches he had inflicted upon himself, but still he felt even more uncomfortable than he had at the beginning of the second task in the tri-wizard tournament as he had stood in front of the whole school in his wet clothing, being laughed and stared at; then at least Harry had been sure that most eyes would be on Fleur and Cedric who in his opinion had cut much more of a fine figure than he could ever have. True, that had made him quite self-conscious but still…
"Many Slytherins fought on his side during the last stand at Hogwarts, Blaise! If they had known him for years, befriended him… they would have fought with him from much earlier on! It's unfair to judge them like this. It is unfair to judge
I'm updating everything I have today. After that it's going to be slow updates.
"You are late." He said, because it was the first way coming to his mind to get to the bottom of their unrest without having to directly reveal the article in front of Mione and Ron if Blaise and Draco did not yet know of it. Surely they wouldn't appreciate having to learn of this newest debacle with such an audience.
Had one of the three henchmen his father had employed to keep an eye on the Aurors tried to blackmail them? That certainly would enrage the Malfoy patriarch. But no, no that wasn't very likely; apart from the fact that they, too, had been given that mild variation of a love potion, this was not a matter that money couldn't resolve, nothing that could ever truly succeed in unbalancing Narcissa Malfoy.
It was difficult to keep it all imprisoned when it made him feel as if he was the one caught in his prickling, too tight skin; so alarmingly hard and arduous to not attack the mirror as his eyes found the man standing there two mirror connections apart from him so close and yet unreachable, but he wrapped it up in a coat of iron and thorns and held the parcel of rancour close to his chest, his very being. This wasn't a battle magic could fight. Not yet.
