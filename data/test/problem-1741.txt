, which they’ve started using in brutal defensive measures. It’s the toughest resistance they’ve faced since their final push into Africa, home of the world’s most powerful wandless magic users. That was years ago. Is there anything that can give them an advantage? If they don’t make progress soon, another tantrum from their illustrious Dark Lord is imminent.
“It’s ever so nice to see you after you’ve been ignoring us for so long. Don’t you dare go anywhere while I get dressed, or I shall beat you about the head!” Draco fusses, on his way out of the study.
The moment they cross the threshold, Draco bursts into silent tears. Harry pauses to wipe them away and hurries him along.
The crying continues for only a brief portion of their journey. Draco’s flushed color gradually recedes in the chill London air, and by the time they are safely inside the gates of St. Savior’s house, he has calmed considerably. He accepts Harry’s kiss with a little sigh. Harry presses their foreheads together, gently stroking his cheekbones. He grips Harry’s wrists tightly.
Before Draco can reply, Pansy rushes back in with one of Draco’s notebooks in hand. Harry has amusedly watched her and Draco marvel over their efficiency when compared to parchment, and now they can’t seem to get enough of them.
Finally, I know that wonky consent kinda comes with the territory for A/B/O fics, but writing anything with non-con as the main focus is my biggest no.
“It’s too fast, Daddy,” Draco whines. His traitorous cock twitches a moment later, though, and when Harry slides a third finger inside, curling his fingers up for a single-minded assault, he moans and thrusts down onto Harry’s hand.
Scorpius, who’d been extremely close to trying out Aunt Ginny’s beloved bat-bogey hex, immediately sits back on his knees. James wipes the dirt on his hands off onto his jeans, like that’s any less incriminating.
“You can rest assured that the filth who put your child in danger are being punished for their transgressions. How far along are you?”
“I’ll take you the next time you’re free. I used to love going to Diagon for school shopping. We can,” he pauses, hesitant. “I can show you where we’ll take our children when it’s time for them to attend Hogwarts.”
Foolishly, Draco feels his face heat the moment they lock gazes. Harry will look so intently at a person talking to him, a direct kind of interest that always makes Draco feel like the only person in the world. He frustratedly shakes his head, at a loss for words.
Draco lets out a rumbling growl. It’s not a noise Harry’s ever heard from him, but he’s abruptly craving hearing it again.
There’s a huge gap in their statuses--Draco outranks her in every conceivable way--but she has a way of stripping everything he’s ever known down to a system that looks desperately petty. He knows that she doesn’t mean to. Her heart is pinned firmly to her sleeve--he’s never met a more earnest person, save Harry. But he is starting to resent her all the same, and he doesn’t trust himself not to snap and shout her down.
“Oh, I know what I’m missing,” Harry purrs. Then he backs away and gives Draco’s arse a playful smack. “Now get dressed, naughty boy. You’re going to be late for your visit with Lucius.”
“This is hardly a punishment, sir,” Draco tells him, pink lips curling up into a smile. He does so love correcting other people.
Daphne comes sliding across the floor and slams into Draco’s legs with a pained grunt, her robes a mess of bright yellow around her legs. He has the brief, nonsensical thought that her mother would be dismayed to see her with her garters exposed like that. He bends down to pull her up, and Pansy immediately tugs her into a frightened embrace.
“Your husband recently suggested to me that I consider loosening the restrictions on the magics that Omegas are permitted to use. Harry is a valued servant of mine for his creativity and power, and I must admit that I have been lenient with his contrarian nature over the years because it amuses me. But such a question… it reminded me just how much he has to learn.” The Dark Lord says, sharply.
“Do you know, this morning Dad asked him if he wanted to see muggle London with him on the way to get some supplies for the restaurant, and he yelled for Kreacher and asked him to bring him the Prophet, like he hadn’t heard Dad at all.” Al confesses, guilty amusement pulling a grin onto his face.
She gives them both a small smile, curtseys, and then quickly walks away, though not before Harry glimpses her covering her mouth with her hand.
Harry scratches his jaw. “Didn’t really have a choice. I’ll never know the truth, but I reckon I got the assignment as a punishment. Back at the orphanages, you’re taught a variety of skills and then they test you for work aptitude as a teenager. Well, they used to--according to Hermione, they’re starting early these days?
“Thank you, sir,” Draco answers, nodding his head. “Is it alright if we leave a little early? Only, we have a free period and I'd like to get some studying in...”
,” breaking his voice apart. Harry rewards him with another heavy thrust, spearing him open. He kisses the sensitive spot behind his ear, and then settles on his haunches, pressing one hand between his shoulder blades, popping his arse up. The slight change of angle sends him scoring over Draco’s prostate, and Draco arches his back with a low cry, whimpering and rolling his hips back into Harry’s.
He’d watched the many bonfires with wide-eyed fascination, complaining when Mother shielded his eyes from the specially designated areas for newly wed couples. He’d heard their cries, and felt the reverberations of their magic, and wondered what it was like to be a part of it all. The morning Maypoles made all of the frustration and tensions worth it, because he could release the pent-up energy dancing himself dizzy, hand tight around a brightly colored ribbon.
He undoes Draco’s fly, and Draco barely has time to murmur his name before Harry draws him into his mouth, savoring the heat and the salty taste. Draco slides a hand into his hair, and moans lowly as Harry bobs his head, dedicated to his task.
“Sit,” Father commands, pointing towards a chair pushed up underneath a tall window. “We will be speaking for some time and you shouldn’t stand overlong in your condition.”
“I met some people when táta moved us to London a few years ago. He got that Ministry position in International Magical Cooperation, you remember. They were very passionate about changing things for the better, and I was so
Scorpius leans forward. “I also smell Nan’s perfume. I think, erm, the garden? The wood polish Lily uses on her upright. All the tall grass in the Burrow. That stupid jasmine rice Dad’s so obsessed with,” Father laughs, and Scorpius grins, “smoke from King's Cross. The potion Al tried to use to fix his hair all first year. The muggle salve you used to rub on our chests when we got sick, the kind we hated because it was all tingly? And something else. I can’t place it. Did I make the potion wrong?”
It’s always been a quiet point of contention for Scorpius. Nan made every effort to get to know them, had babysat and spoiled and corralled them as much as any other person in their sprawling family, dividing her time between them and her husband. She hadn’t been able to bring herself to say anything bad about him, and clearly he loved her, if the way his magic is failing after her death is any indication. But Scorpius has always been the most kindhearted of all of them, the most protective, and hasn’t ever been able to wrap his head around the power of Pureblood convention--or the way Nan had broken so many of those to be in their lives, however much they began to wane following the war.
A few white-robed servants are rushing about with their arms full of clothes and food and new decorations--no matter how large their load, they pause to bow to the Dark Lord on their way by. Other temporary occupants stare openly, and a few audacious people approach, each of them stopped short when the Dark Lord wordlessly raises his free hand to dismiss them. It’s a strange relief, considering the way some of their eyes glide over to Draco and light up with a curious gleam.
The dull roar of his thoughts is interrupted by an insistent knocking on the door leading into the meeting room. Voldemort’s face shadows with displeasure, and the door swings open. The young man on the other side stumbles inside, red-faced and panting.
Harry immediately thinks of the resistance. Judging by the rare, blanching looks on the faces of his older counterparts, they are feeling the same way. But that wouldn’t make sense. Members of the resistance had been either killed or sent to Azkaban on the vague chance of rehabilitation--Harry’s own godfather, Sirius Black, has been there for the majority of his life. War orphans were regularly reminded of their bloodlines and their parents’ failings, but Harry hadn’t even known Black existed until Pettigrew showed him his small photo album from before the resistance fell. So how could anyone even remotely related to them do something like this, in their time of high security?
She'd been the one to talk him through suppressing after his first heat, tutting about how Purebloods were coming into themselves later and later because of their families' pressures. That'd been right before sixth year. Draco remembers laughing hysterically in her face, which she thankfully chalked up to the hormone cocktail of his body aggressively reminding him he was ready to carry. Very few Pureblood Omegas could say their parents were asking them to use their wands to kill instead of chase down children and run an estate, but then again, old Riddle hadn't been a very reasonable man.
“It’s too much, Daddy, it’s too much,” He whimpers, pressing against Harry’s wrist with an almost kittenish weakness.
“It’s true. I taught Draco a few offensive spells for my own peace of mind. We’re newly bonded and I like to know that he’s safe. I taught him the spells without expecting that he would ever need to use them, but evidently, my instincts were in the right place.” Harry says. “Is this going to be a problem?”
Aurors sweep back into Draco’s room like birds of prey while he’s in the washroom, well before visiting hours. It’s not the first time, but Harry doesn’t have the energy to be angry about it. Bar those from rich families, few employees of any establishment would refuse an Auror’s orders.
All of them began seeing less and less of Theo with each meeting with the Dark Lord his father brought him to. To be given the opportunity to prove oneself to the Dark Lord is a great honor even with the best possible connections, so they hadn’t questioned the way he threw himself into his planning and preparations. It just seems, oddly enough, that he has moved some of the planning to Draco’s home. It’s not uncommon to find Theo curled up in one room or another, nose buried in his books or his strange, rotating gadgets.
Draco flushes defensively. He brings one foot up and thumps Harry on the back. He freezes minutely, afraid that he’s crossed a line, but Harry only lets out a theatrically pained noise.
If Draco were wearing lip rouge, Harry’s cheeks would be completely red from how often he swans over to ask, “Can I have this, Daddy?” or “Do you like this, Daddy?” and then delightedly kiss his cheeks in thanks at the inevitable yes.
"Um, I. Er, I'm sorry," Al babbles, as Draco leans forward and nuzzles his face against the seat of Al's trousers.
At the same time, the birds fall abruptly silent and then break formation in a stunning burst of tiny black shapes, zooming in all directions across the sky. Harry stares after them with wide eyes.
Harry’s tongue plunges into his mouth, drawing a keen from his throat. The remains of the potion are still bitter in his mouth, but Draco doesn’t care, because it feels like he might lose his mind for want of being closer. Their hands are still linked between them, tacky with blood and no doubt soiling their expensive robes. They don’t pull away until Draco’s lungs are burning.
A few quiet seconds pass, with no reply from Draco. Harry glances up to find that Draco has fallen into a doze, knees folded, journal open on his chest with his other arm thrown over the back of the couch. It can’t be comfortable, but he looks perfectly content. Harry rises and seats himself on the other end of the couch, just watching him for a moment longer. Then, curious, he gently dislodges the journal from Draco’s grip.
Harry takes a deep breath, and gets back to work. The latest reports on the Russian leg of their eastern invasion look bleak. Each time they push forward into a new nation, they are faced with a unique challenge. The Death Eaters announced themselves to the world a few years after Harry was born, and by then they had conquered all of western and central Europe and a considerable swath of northern Africa. Though intimidation will always be a strong tactic--the magical community at large, conquered or not, kowtows to Britain on the regular--it also gives people time to prepare. If it were Harry, at the top, he would have crept up on the world, and not said a word until he made the progress he wanted to make. If anything will be the Dark Lord’s downfall, it will be himself. In fact, Harry’s been privately hoping for that to happen for years.
They set their tents up in the plot of land Lucius reserved for their immediate family, and Draco is quickly enveloped by relatives who have scarcely seen him in his last few weeks of self-imposed hermitude.
Draco’s nostrils flare. He feels the magic rising within him like a tidal wave, pooling warmly in his belly and rushing outward. Thicknesse’s face is briefly illuminated in a familiar purple glow, and then the two of them are skidding apart. Draco rights himself with his arms spread wide, but he can see that Thicknesse has fallen to the floor. He is cradling his smoking hand to his chest and staring up at Draco with wide eyes.
Dad carefully says, “I think... I loved him for a lot longer than I thought I did. But, no, to answer your question. For the longest time we were worlds apart. It took time to even make it to friendship. There was a lot of unlearning for both of us to do. Why do you ask?”
“You really like green. Slytherin pride, yeah? But you love purple, in just about any shade you can get it.”
he mouths, climbing onto Harry’s lap. Harry leans up on his elbows to pull him into a deep, toe-curling kiss, rumbling contentedly as Draco nips at his lips. Maybe it’s the magic, or the potion, or the feeling of Harry’s cock heavy and damp against Draco’s slick thighs. Or maybe it’s the feeling of so many hungry eyes on them, but Draco cannot contain the deep moan that builds up in his chest.
He goes on to tell her about other little incidents--about trying a cleaning charm on a spill and stripping the wood clean off the surface of a table, about the way the letters on books he’s reading start to dance if he stares for too long without processing anything, about the way the house staff has begun to announce themselves to him if only to avoid being badly stung for shocking him. He wants, more than anything, to mention that night with Mr. Thicknesse--that familiar purple light, and the smoke rising from pale skin. He hopes that the examples will serve as a fitting replacement.
Harry doesn’t even know what to make of the look on his face, but it melts into a relieved smile as Harry sidles up to him.
“What if I mess it up?” Scorpius frets, as he lines up the ingredients before them. Such a powerful potion for so few ingredients.
“I just--I thought you might like it,” He says, staring up at the ceiling. “I didn’t think you’d be back today, so I just wanted to get used to wearing them.”
“You just got dressed an hour ago,” Harry says, a weak protest if ever he’s heard one. Judging by the victorious smirk on Draco’s face, he feels the same way.
Lily is staring at him with her keen gray eyes. She’s always been able to suss him out pretty quick. “You think we should do it, too.”
“Uncle Rodolphus’ favorite house elf makes these sinful red velvet cakes,” Draco answers. “I’d always beg to visit him and Aunt Bella last so I could savor it.”
They roll around on the bed for a bit, content to grind and grope and explore, and Malfoy pulls away only to reach for his robes and draw out his wand, throwing up silencing charm after silencing charm, muttering about how Harry won't let him hear the end of it if he wakes up to this particular kind of noise.
She never once lost her temper, kept her mouth shut, and continued to do the work he assigned her. Draco would tell his friends about it in their common room, and they’d sit in a circle and laugh. When they’d gotten a glittering Outstanding grade for their work, he’d taken all of the credit for it. He wonders if Tracey ever told Anezka about the things he did.
It’s a slow, sweet kiss, more a press of lips than anything. Harry murmurs sweet nothings into Draco’s skin.
Harry purses his lips, then raises the bottle back up to his lips for a long pull. “It’s powerful magic. It binds Muggles to whoever they serve. It’s kind of like the bonds we have with house elves? But Muggles don’t have the same freedom of movement. Move too far from where the runes say they should be, and it starts up with the stinging hexes until it finally just follows up with the killing curse.”
With a shudder and a wordless shout, Draco spurts his release into his robes, his head falling forward. Some of the sweat gathered at his temples falls down his face, pulled by gravity--it pools in his eyes with a sting, and drops onto the floor out of sight. Harry works him through his orgasm, telling him that he feels so good, that he’s such a good boy. He whines and comes again, completely untouched for the second time. Harry leans forward, molding his front to Draco’s back so he can nip at his aching bondmark.
“I’d like you to start learning how to run the estate,” Harry says, drawing him out of his scattered thoughts.
“Because it’s true. You wouldn’t believe the gaffes I made here at your age. I was so naive. Absolutely dreadful.” Mother says, frowning mildly.
Sometimes they talk before bed. It's a holdover from a tradition they started in the early days of their relationship, when both of their nightmares were too heavy for them to stay asleep.
. It feels like she paces for hours on end, fear growing in her chest. And then, just as she sees the curling imprint of the door materializing into existence in the castle wall, Nan calls her name, the same way she did that day, with so much fear in her voice. She hears it from behind her. Just as she’s about to glance over her shoulder, she awakens.
“Are you going to assign me an essay? Two feet of parchment on why I’m not that special after all and everything I’ve ever known is wrong?” Draco snipes.
He jolts in surprise, and then settles. None of the house staff would dare disturb him without announcing themselves first. Sure enough, Harry climbs in, still wearing his heavy, dark Death Eater robes.
“I brought him to London because I asked if he wanted to and he said yes, what else is there to discuss? I know your standards are ridiculously high for me, Lucius, but I won’t tolerate you blaming me for something none of us could have anticipated. I’m ‘free’ with Draco because he’s a person.”
“Yes! By the Wild, yes! I just didn’t think this would happen. I didn’t think--when I asked--well. I’m surprised. I’m scared, as well. I’m so scared.” Draco whispers.
Harry does, and then he kisses each of Draco’s fingers for good measure, drawing a giggle. He gets like that, sometimes, when he knows he’s done well. Harry kisses him, sliding his hands down to the lacy fabric on his hips. Though he squawks in mournful protest when Harry rips his flimsy underwear, he settles easily enough, squirming as his erection bobs towards his belly.
Draco sighs, and then breaks off into soft giggles when Harry presses playful, staccato kisses along his neck and jaw.
-Draco is assaulted, in that someone touches him (non sexually) without his consent and makes him fear that he is in danger. It's just a creepy and invasive interaction all around
He pulls away, and before Draco can even begin to complain about their lack of contact, he’s pulling Draco’s chair from out from underneath the table. He sinks to his knees, smiling when Draco’s thighs part easily for him. He trails his hands up Draco’s thighs, tutting at the slickness he finds there. The flush on Draco’s cheeks deepens. Harry dips his head, trailing his tongue through his slick, tongue hot like a brand. The moan Draco lets out is loud even to his own ears.
They kneel before the little altar Draco put together in one of his nesting rooms for the month of February, his own private Imbolc celebration when he was unsure if he’d have the energy to attend group celebrations.
“How dare you!” Sonja hisses. Draco tenses in fear as the woman’s icy blue eyes snap towards her with a cold swiftness.
He eats a light breakfast in the gardens after bundling up to protect against the chill, hoping that the cool air will soothe him. If nothing else, he is glad to see a clear blue sky, and charmed by the simply built picnic table he has largely ignored in favor of eating in the personal kitchen with Harry.
“No,” Harry says, amused. “You’ve been fantasizing about this place for days and you’ll hate it if we got this close and you didn’t get anything.”
Bashful, Draco burrows his face into Harry's collarbone. Harry presses his hand down, where Draco's still hard and twitching, and he bucks up into the movement with a whine. Harry laughingly coaxes him out of hiding, and then they work together to unbuckle his trousers. The moment his pants come down, Harry is letting out an appreciative groan. Without preamble, he's spreading Draco's thighs as widely as his chair allows, taking him in with greedy eyes. Draco can't resist the petty little urge to kick at him, but Harry catches his ankle with a casual strength, which makes another stupid whine fall from his lips.
Harry was able to secure permission to take Draco back to the Potter Estate for Ostara. He had been working diligently to get it done, apparently, and took advantage of the Dark Lord’s leniency around the Wheel of the Year. Draco is so relieved to be leaving London, even for just the short three days they have been allotted, that he spends the entire morning of their departure holding back grateful tears. It only gets worse when Harry happily informs him that they'll have leave to move back in full once the trials of the Wizengamot come to a close.
Grateful that Draco has chosen to nap in their bedroom for today, Harry wards the room and opens the first one. Lucius Malfoy’s familiar voice fills Harry’s study.
He hadn’t wanted Draco to attend, but he’d insisted, saying that he cared more about supporting Harry than being a source of scandal. It’s a decision that no doubt took a lot of courage, considering all the gossip and their high chances of encountering some of the most frustrating people in their lives, and Harry loves him for it.
“Put those in the closet,” Draco scolds him, around a laugh. Harry playfully brandishes the shoes at him, snickering when Draco kicks at him underneath the layered blankets. “And leave the closet door open while you change.”
The bed is neatly made when he returns. Harry hits himself with a round of cleaning charms so powerful that it makes his skin ache as if he’s been bruised.
In this relatively unoccupied corner of the castle, it is easy to follow the trail Viktorovich left behind. It leads him through archways and past trashed classrooms piled high with bodies, and then finally down a steep stairwell.
“Yes,” Draco gasps, the word growing into a pitchy moan. “I want to be good for you. Want your knot, your baby—”
Then she marches away, back straight, and somehow loses her footing on absolutely nothing while passing through the aisles. She holds her tray high, evidently hoping to save it from her fall. Harry sets his tray down, rights her with a few wandless flicks of the hand, and then turns his head before she can look back at him.
“No,” Draco says, a hint of confusion in his voice. “No, I was panicked. I didn’t even think to use something more powerful. I wish I had! Maybe we wouldn’t have been so worse for wear.”
“The plan was just--I didn’t know they were going to do that! They said they were going to kidnap us and hold us so that the Dark Lord would hear their petition. They said they were going to try to make a statement! I just had to help them corrupt the wards on Sonja’s house. That's how they were able to, to do--it.” Anezka stammers. "They have a lot of friends in high places. I was one of them."
Finally, she leads them to her personal parlor, where a group of smiling people are assembled excitedly by the door. Draco takes in the particular make of their robes and dresses, catches a hint of their calming scents, and knows that they are all Omegas.
“And who is it you work for?” An Omega from the crowd calls. At his side is an adorable child the absolute spit of him, down to the cupid’s bow. Draco swallows his jealousy. Now is certainly not the time.
Draco lifts his hips to help Harry pull him out of the lacy underwear he’s grown a fondness for. At least Harry didn’t rip this pair. He lets out a delirious giggle at the thought.
“Why on Earth would you want to see one of those?” Harry asks, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders.
It’s not exactly a surprise--the Death Eaters have been systematically toppling Eastern Europe for months now. Still, it’s a scary thought. Draco swallows. Harry gives him a sad little half smile, like he read Draco’s thoughts. He places their finished plates on the little work table in the center of the main kitchen, and then he’s smiling and helping Draco down from the counter, hands firm on his hips. It’s a tiny little thing, something he’s done time and again, but as Harry sets him on his feet with a smile, Draco realizes that he might be falling in love.
“Okay, sweetheart,” he says, and he props his right hand up over where Draco’s hand is clenched into the sheets, slotting their fingers together. The other worms underneath his belly, cupping his drooling cock. and just the touch alone has him twitching and shuddering.
He complies, and as Harry takes his place at the headboard of the bed, he gives him a hungry look. His pupils are blown wide, the thin ring of gray left behind darkened with want. Harry pats his thighs in invitation, and he crawls over. He takes Harry’s cock in hand and gives it a slow pump, clearly delighted. Harry grunts as his cock twitches in that soft grip, precome gradually easing the way of soft strokes.
“Me either, Scor. But it’s the right thing to do, don’t you think?” James says. And, it’s a low blow, but he adds, “Let’s do it for Nan.”
Harry’s breath catches. Draco’s worried he’s said the wrong thing until Harry gives him a trembling smile and kisses his cheek. “That’s so sweet of you, Draco. I don’t think it’s a good idea, though. You know, what with everything that happened. Not to mention she was Muggleborn. The baby doesn’t deserve the kind of things people would say. But I love you so much for thinking about it.”
A little hormones and he became an absolute menace. Harry is going to be sucked dry before this pregnancy is over, he thinks, not that he particularly minds.
The meetings in Sonja’s parlor are refreshing. He learns of torrid affairs and audacious politicians and Aurors accepting bribes. He listens with wide-eyed, half-scandalized wonder as the older Omegas laugh raucously about their relationships and uncensored accounts of sex. They crow in delight the one time he haltingly tells them about his wedding night (carefully omitting the fact that he’d been crying his eyes out right up until they retreated to their bedchambers), and the trysts he and Harry had in semi-public spaces.
He approaches like Draco is a frightened animal, and he supposes it’s not too far from the truth. Harry takes his hand and guides him over to the chair he once occupied. He helps Draco out of his shawl and urges him to sit. Then he kneels, hands smoothing warmly over Draco’s thighs.
“But anyways, there’s a waiting period while your caretakers deliberate. Then you get this list and you’re told, pick one or someone’ll pick for you. In the weeks leading up to getting my list, I’d pissed off Matron for backtalk. She’d been terrorizing my girlfriend at the time something fierce, and I thought, well, I’m leaving soon, why not say the stuff I always wanted to say? So one day I got my list and the only choice was ‘assistant cook.’ Drove me right spare.”
The dummy slams against the wall in a great woosh of sound. Draco, startled and suddenly deeply afraid of being caught, yelps out a silencing charm. The world falls completely silent, and Draco’s stomach drops. He does not know if anyone else can hear the sound of the dummy hitting the wall, but he can feel the way it rattles, strong enough to last several pulses beneath his feet.
Harry pulls his fingers out completely. Draco thrashes against the bed, letting out a dry sob of frustration. Harry molds himself against Draco’s back, rubbing a hand up and down his flank, shushing him in low croons against his ear.
Draco shudders apart a few moments later, gasping wheezing onto Harry’s skin. The stickiness between them only spurs him on, makes him desperate for it.
, dead thirteen years younger than Harry is today) as he’s never seen him before, small and knobbly kneed and just as bespectacled as Harry himself, grinning brightly all the while. He sees his grandparents standing side by side on their wedding day, and several other black-haired, smiling relatives. Trisha Potter was a famous Quidditch player. Barnabus Potter, with his rakish grin and charming curly hair, had children with not one, not two, but
A cool, frantic puff of breath hits Harry’s skin, and then Draco relaxes the tiniest bit, tongue working the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry cups his face, and begins a quick, shallow rhythm. Draco’s tongue swirls over him as Harry fucks into his mouth, eyes fluttering closed into a truly blissful look. His faint moans vibrate along Harry’s sensitive head, his length twitching in response.
Of all the Aurors Harry has had the displeasure of meeting, Beauregard has always maintained a careful veneer of calm. At the most, Harry’s seen her snappy with irritation. The rage is unfamiliar.
Sirius slams in, burying himself deep, and now that he's gotten a taste of what it feels like to let go, he follows up with quick, shallow thrusts, his brief worry gratified by the keening noise that tumbles from Malfoy's kiss-swollen lips. As he goes, it gets harder and harder to pull out, his knot pulsing forth with an almost painful burst of pleasure. He tugs Malfoy's rim one, twice, three times, and then with a delicious squirm and a squeeze of those shaking thighs, Malfoy is coming, twisting over the head of his cock as it spurts between them. He's still clenching rhythmically when Sirius pushes his knot in, and that's it, Sirius is coming and coming and coming, for what feels like ages but is probably just a few intense seconds, his forehead pressed against Malfoy's.
Harry waves a hand, desperate not to be on the receiving end of Draco’s legendary disappointment. “No, I do! I just thought… you know, all Purebloods are such sticklers about Omegas keeping it long.”
“It’s no trouble. I was,” and here she pauses, giving Harry an abruptly considering look. “I was... glad to be helpful.”
He sees the look on Harry’s face shutter the smallest bit, but it’s quickly replaced by a smile when Draco asks him if he’s okay.
It pauses long enough for Harry to wave his hand and banish it. When he looks back up at Draco, intent on congratulating him, he finds his mate staring at him with wide eyes, one hand covering his mouth.
“Er,” Harry says, “Don’t you think he would be unsettled if I just up and told him that he needed to have more than the two required of us?”
“It’s like there were… two Michels,” Theo says, gesturing wildly with his hands. “In some pages, he’s joking about seducing Omegas and making his mother mad by tracking mud on the carpets just so he could watch the house elves clean it all up. Then, he’s talking about, um, murder, with all the clinical distance of a Healer discussing medicine with a patient.”
Mother warned him that he’d be sleepy during his first trimester, but he hadn’t believed her right up until the fatigue caught up to him. It doesn’t help that he’s still recovering from magical exhaustion, either. Harry forbade him from using all but the simplest of magics in a fit of protective worry pretty much the same day they settled into their temporary home, so he spends most of his days in the Citadel tired, bored, and on edge. And now that Harry has started leaving their quarters before he wakes up, Draco scarcely knows what to do with himself.
Harry laughs at Draco’s buzzing excitement as they are being fitted for the light clothing customary of the festival. “I’ve never had a proper Beltane.”
“So wear cologne,” Draco complains, knowing well that there are few colognes powerful enough to hide the very distinct smell of a pregnant Omega. “Can’t you see I need you?”
“So what is an Omega supposed to do if they’re trying to report domestic abuse?” Harry remembers asking, horrified.
Scorpius pushes over some neatly cut carrots, starts on the chives. Plock, plock, plock, a soothing rhythm, the smell rising to his nose. “I feel like every time we talk, I turn his world upside down.”
This morning, the rumbling purr that sounds in Harry’s throat as he noses along Draco’s neck goes right to his stomach. He’d paused on his way to his outer robe, kneeling half on the bed for a kiss and a few moments of soft nuzzling, clearly on his way out the door.
He can only endure a few more minutes of the teasing before the pleasure-pain tips into the unbearable, so he gently pushes at Harry’s head. Harry surprises him by lifting his hips and shoving a pillow underneath his hips, the careless show of strength driving a dreamy sigh out of Draco’s throat. Harry presses his hands under Draco’s thighs, opening him wide, thumbs sliding down to his slick entrance to part him for a leisurely stripe of the tongue.
Draco nods, kisses him goodbye, and makes his shaky way inside. The hostess’s eyes widen--no doubt at the distinctive color of his hair--and ushers him to a private table at the back. When they see him, his friends crow with delight, and Draco doesn’t know why he was ever worried. Pansy is the first to rise from her seat and give him a hug. Then she pulls back and brushes his hair away from his forehead, observing his hairline with a critical eye.
“Hey,” he says, reaching out. He runs a hand up Draco’s back, over the curve of his neck. “What’s wrong?”
She reaches out for him, and he winces as her dust-covered hand brushes against his skin, sending a frisson of pain shooting down the side of his face all the way to his neck. She withdraws her wand and uses a healing charm on him. The pain lessens into something less sharp.
been a rather long morning. He wasn’t planning on it, but he slides under the covers as well and pulls Draco close, his back to Harry’s front. They doze for what feels like an eternity but likely isn’t that long, Draco shifting and muttering in his sleep. He’s been having all sorts of strange dreams, which according to Healer Ouedraogo is not so uncommon. So when Harry hears him ramble softly about muses and destruction and arms, he narrows his brows in affectionate amusement and pulls him closer. He kisses the faded pink of their bondmark until Draco settles with a contented sigh.
Then he sobers and squeezes Draco’s arm. “Take it or leave it, Draco. I’m serious. If you can’t agree to that, I forbid you from attending, ever. Okay?
“You’re not supposed to leave refrigerators open for very long, sweet boy,” Harry says, though he doesn’t sound angry.
“Makes sense to me,” Harry says, like it’s the simplest thing in the world. “Ask whenever you want. I’ll always look after you, okay? For as long as you’ll have me, Draco.”
Harry circles a thumb over the peaked nipple poking through the gauzy fabric. He kisses a line down the elegant column of Draco’s neck, over his collarbones, down his sternum. He replaces his thumb with his mouth, savoring the way it makes Draco squirm against him.
The chorus of voices starts up again, indistinct and questioning gibbering, and he winces, swaying forward. He wipes furiously at the tears that spill forth.
He and Harry have avoided Hyde Park because everyone who’s everyone knows it’s where the gossips like to congregate, and Harry has a short tolerance for entertaining Purebloods’ battle-like conversation. He’s too unblinkingly honest to consider coddling someone’s feelings or holding his thoughts close to his chest about something he finds unfair. And Draco, equal parts fascinated and scandalized by it all, can’t ever seem to hide his amusement. They’ve been photographed giggling together at many an event, much to Father’s chagrin.
“I understand that you were shocked, darling, but please be more careful. Imagine if that was another wizard.” Mother whispers in his ear.
And then he smiles, reaching up to cup Harry’s cheek. Harry turns his head to kiss his wrist, and snuggles back close again, rolling his hips into a slow grind, mostly to gauge where his knot is at, and also for the dreamy sigh that falls from Draco’s lips. Being knotted makes him adorably lightheaded and chatty from the endorphin rush. By the time Harry’s knot goes down completely and he pulls out, Draco has drifted off to sleep. Harry cleans them both with charms, then the bed, and kisses his forehead.
They may have prolonged the inevitable, but there is no avoiding meeting Harry’s peers. It’s Dolohov who calls them over. He’s flanked by Aunt Bella and the Carrow siblings, with Greyback standing uncomfortably behind them. As they approach, he doesn’t bother to hide the way his eyes trail over Draco’s body. Beltane robes are so light and gauzy as to be see-through in good light, if only for freedom of movement and ease of removal. Harry’s arm tightens around Draco’s waist. They endure several agonizing minutes of Aunt Bella’s unsubtle digs at Harry’s blood status, with her fellows gleefully interjecting.
Draco silences him with a round of short, chaste kisses, and then burrows his face into Harry’s neck, the soft swell of his breasts pressing warmly into Harry’s chest as he clings as tightly as he can. Harry laughs again, mostly just because he can, and maybe a little bit because he’s never felt so much love.
Theo sighs as he comes in, the diary cradled gently in his hands. After a moment’s hesitation, he closes the door to the study behind him with his foot and makes his way over to the desk.
Then he patiently explains how to use some of the Muggle invented contraptions that Draco is unfamiliar with: retractable showerheads unlike any he’s ever seen in the opulent, marble-floored bathrooms; a deep-seated tub that comes alive with roaring hot waters when turned on, placed within the pool that dominates the center of a floor dedicated entirely to lazing about; baffling plastic squares placed low on walls that delivery power any item powered by electricity. He’s the most fascinated by a magically powered projector, complete with sound. He’s heard of this technology, of course. It’s been used to record events like the Quidditch cup, but only in real time--he never knew that it was something that could be made small enough for use in one’s home, to display dramas like the ones Mother might have dragged him to for socialization.
There is a sizable crowd outside of St. Mungo’s when Harry arrives. He’s not proud of it, but he drops his name more than once to make his way through, and thoughtlessly locks one of the security guards that approaches him under a powerful body-binding curse. His messy hair and glasses are iconic by now, though, so it only takes an apologetic nod to the guard’s partner for him to be waved through.
“I’ve been home for a little while,” Harry admits, sitting down on the bed. “I was speaking with Ginny, actually. She told me you were upset when you came home.”
“The word is that the Dark Lord wants him to advise on different kinds of warfare, or suchlike,” Crabbe says, scoffing. “Wishy washy nonsense, you ask me.”
," and then he's clenching around Harry's tongue, hips rolling in Harry's hold. Harry slides a finger inside of him, meeting a little resistance and rolling through it, determined to take him apart. He crooks his finger up, searching, and hums in satisfaction when scoring his fingertip over Draco's sweet spot has him gasping into the desk.
“Merlin fuck, Draco, what did you put in that? I still feel like I could just eat you up.” Harry says, kissing at his bond mark.
a little nervous, but he quickly decides not to mention it. It’s difficult for any Omega to be transported to a new place for a long period of time. Unfamiliar scents can be unsettling.
Viktorovich is walking around the back of his desk, and Harry quickly raises his wand again. The headmaster laughs and pulls out a glass bottle of clear liquid, two shot glasses, and bizarrely enough a jar of pickles, which he twists open with relish.
Caught, Draco covers his face with hands. Harry laughs, a calloused hand worming beneath his hips to briefly rub warm circles on his belly before he reaches over and pulls the canopy closed. Draco peeks out between his fingers.
It isn’t until Draco raises a soft hand to Harry’s face that he realizes tears have been streaming from his eyes. Draco wipes them clean, and then gently knocks their foreheads together. Harry strokes the back of his hand, grounded by his warmth and sweet scent amidst the chaos surrounding them. He’s got to watch those memories. He has to. It might be the last thing anyone will ever have of Fred Weasley.
When he’s done, Draco playfully shoves him onto the bed, snickering at Harry’s curses. He rolls onto his back, still in his robes and shoes and everything, but Draco’s already shed his school robes, leaving only a sheer pink nightgown behind. He’s fiddling with the vial, smiling secretively down at Harry.
A lull of silence befalls them. Harry realizes that there is never going to be a right moment to ask the questions he needs to ask. So he steeples his fingers and takes a deep breath to ground himself. Fred looks at him with eyes narrow with amusement, an expression so scarily similar to Viktorovich’s that Harry finds himself staring up at the ceiling to escape it.
He doesn’t fight it when Harry coaxes him out of his clothes, but he does blush to the roots of his hair when Harry pauses at the lacy red knickers stretched tight over his growing erection.
Draco raises a hand to stroke Harry’s hair, then tilts his head for a chaste kiss, pink lips curling up into a smile.
Much of what he sees on the papers he sifts through is lost to him. Reports are heavy with jargon, others are written in some incomprehensible cipher, and one even startles him with a stinging hex so powerful it aches all the way down to his elbow and leaves him curled over the desk, hissing in pain. He waits until the worst of it passes, and decides not to risk the top of the desk any longer.
Harry looks down to hide his amused smirk. He pulls out a chair for Draco to sit in, gently pushing him towards the burnished wood table set in the center of the private conference room.
The conversation they have is one of the least frustrating ones Harry has had to endure in the past few days, even through the language barrier. Anton laughs outright at Harry’s attempt to speak Russian, so they stick to English. He clearly adores his twins, warm green eyes going soft each time his gaze settles on them. He’s curious about Harry's work as a Death Eater, fascinated and disgusted with descriptions of England’s weather, and sympathetic when Harry admits that he and Draco have been trying to conceive for some time.
“Certainly not. I can call my wand to me, or stir a cauldron, but I’ve never done anything like he does.”
Even under a disillusionment charm, Harry considers turning around the moment the squat building comes into view. He is about to actually do it when a woman with a familiar head of curly hair steps out of the door with a wreath in hand. His breath catches as she stands on tiptoe and affixes it to the rusted hanger on the top of the door. It’s a simple band of interlocking branches with a bow at the top--that is, until the woman takes her wand out and conjures several delicate lilies.
Draco whispers an affirmative and rolls onto his side, not wanting Harry’s worried face to break his resolve. Harry briefly rubs his back and leaves the bed. Draco closes his eyes. When he opens them again, the sun is in a different position in the sky. He shoots up, hissing through his teeth as his body aches in protest. His joints feel tender, and there’s an uncomfortable fluttering in his stomach.
“Good boy,” Harry purrs, watching with satisfaction as Draco shivers in response. “Such a good boy. You’re so pretty for me. Doing alright?”
After that, Draco hates the raids that take Harry away from their estate less and less. It always brings him home in a rare mood. The next time the Dark Lord hosts a soiree, he makes a wry, passing comment about how surprised he is that Draco isn’t heavily pregnant, yet. Father looks like he’s an inch away from screaming, which tries Harry’s composure. They find a quiet room and howl with laughter.
“I love you, too! So much. Neither of us wanted this at first, but look at us now. Do you get what I’m saying?” Harry says, reaching out to tilt Draco’s chin up.
“Yes, but it’s nothing for you to be concerned about. Just know that you have to speak with Weasley today. He’s going to be sent to Azkaban tomorrow to await the next trial before the Wizengamot.” Beauregard says.
He can feel Harry’s laugh rumbling against his back. “I’m glad you gave me a chance. It’s just everyone else’s turn now, I reckon.”
Draco says the last bit as calmly as if he were remarking on the weather, and Harry feels a small bit of pride at the subtle reminder. He can see several members of the Wizengamot shifting uncomfortably in their seats. Of all of the people attending Sonja’s party that particular day, Draco is the only one with Death Eater family in the inner circle.
Harry just nods and takes his seat, glad that it effectively breaks Blishwick’s line of vision. The moment he sits down, Draco reaches for his hand, squeezing tight. Harry sighs, hackles lowering the smallest bit.
to, at any rate. If I can’t continue living vicariously through you I won’t have any reason to keep going.”
Aunt Bella has not lost this competition for some ten years. Every opponent that follows seems determined to be the one to best this new champion. They all fail. The attendant, shocked and wide-eyed, declares Harry the winner of this year’s Beltane duels. He bows before them, sweat dripping from his hair. The setting sun casts an eerie red glow behind him, and he has never looked more beautiful.
“Gorgeous creature,” Thicknesse agrees, bringing Harry out of his thoughts. “It’s a shame he was given over to that half-breed cretin.”
Harry pulls out slowly, hissing through his teeth when Draco squeezes greedily around him, and then pushes back in.
He brought the family diary, mostly to have something to occupy himself. He’s mostly skimming, occasionally pausing to scoff and roll his eyes over especially ridiculous passages, before a charmed drawing of the moon cycle catches his attention. It’s drawn in loving detail and is so mesmerizing to look at that he stares at it for a little while in silence. He turns the page and blinks at the peculiar title before him.
He sat at a chair beneath an arched window, and pauses to spell it open with his hand, sighing at the gentle breeze that sways through. This particular room is set up with small bookshelves and work tables and one of the Muggle televisions set up on a high table. Draco had fiddled with it only once, pausing to watch in muted fascination as reporters for the Prophet gabbed about the local news. He’d cut it off in a huff when the topic at hand turned to his disastrous day at the Wizengamot, and hasn’t used it since. It really was a mistake to integrate Muggle technology into their society--the gossip rags are diabolical enough on their own without being accompanied by sound and dramatic close-ups of Rita Skeeter’s face and Diagon Alley advertisements.
To his horror, Harry is sitting in one of the living room reclining chairs with thick reports in hand, brows furrowed at what he’s reading. He adjusts his glasses and looks up with a small smile, only to set his papers aside and rush over at the sight of Draco’s distress.
I feel the need to point out that I've taken serious creative liberties with the Wheel of the Year and altered some things to fit the world. I think one of the biggest changes is that technically the only deity that wizards who follow the Wheel celebrate is magic itself, which is commonly referred to as the Wild Magic here, with subsets of it given set names (light, dark, necromancy, blood, etc). I encourage you to do your own research to learn more about the Wheel of the Year if you're interested in its real world equivalent--this fic is in no way indicative of how these celebrations actually work!
The Dark Lord gives him an indulgent smile. “She expressed her good wishes for the health of your child.”
The Confirmation is a particularly old-fashioned ritual, designed to ensure the consummation of a Pureblood’s marriage, and the expeditious creation of an heir. They plan to do no such thing tonight, of course--Draco is a deft hand at contraception charms and will not be having children until he feels ready for it--but Father had been clear. No Confirmation, no marriage. It would be foolish to ruin all of their hard work by refusing one night of humiliation. Every spectator is under an Unbreakable Vow. There will be now sharing memories of this night with the press, and rumor is restricted to vague terms that will frustrate the nosiest of wizarding society. Still, it grates at him. Draco wants to gnash his teeth. He knows that half of them are here for the spectacle of witnessing the Boy Who Lived knotting the Malfoy scion until he cries. He knows the rest are here to gain the right to call in favors from his father. A good many of them are just here for a show. He hates them all, passionately and intensely.
Hermione makes thoughtful interjections about ingredients and scales and proportions, and offers suggestions that seem promising enough for him to make scribbled notes in the margins of his ever-changing recipe.
“It’s a nice day… I’ll take a walk, shop around. It was good to see you,” Draco says, smiling. Then he kisses Harry’s cheek and adds, “Thank you for lunch, Daddy,” before releasing his arm, reluctance in every line of his slender frame.
exhausted. A shower and a nap will make us both feel so much better.” Harry says, voicing rumbling against Draco’s back. “Will you come with me?”
“Retire the heels from now on or I’ll go into the closet and repeat the process with every pair,” Harry says, cupping his face for a quick kiss.
Draco flushes, gesturing softly with the folded blanket he has hooped in one corner, the needle pointing halfway out of the in-progress design. It’s a mess of green and brown at the moment, but he’s hopeful it will turn out favorably.
“No, I want to. I’m just trying to think of a way to put it into words. Er, I guess I should start with how I ended up where I am? I was born in Godric’s Hollow, in secret. My dad had joined the resistance after… refusing the Dark Lord when he was called to service. It was his last chance to redeem himself after marrying my mum.”
They are briefly locked in a staring contest before Sonja huffs and takes her seat, crossing one leg over the other. After the preliminary questions are over, the story that Sonja tells aligns perfectly with what Draco has shared with Harry, save for what she saw beyond her door: one of her servants kneeling over the bloodied form of another with a knife in hand. When pressed, she reluctantly confirms Draco’s use of a curse. Shocked gasps ring out. Even Lucius and Narcissa look over at Draco, who has squared his shoulders and is looking straight ahead.
This is how Scorpius finds him, kneeling along the snakes by the valerian sprigs. His twin surprises him by hissing out that he caught Dad and Father making out and he doesn’t know how he’s going to cope. Al snickers at the truly green look on Scorpius’ pale face, and also because he recognizes it as an attempt to cheer him up. He was definitely listening. The garden snakes curl around his ankles as he approaches, bringing him into the fold, asking his perspective on stupid human family politics.
In the end, it’s Goyle’s knockback jynx that ends the battle, of all things. It is overpowered enough to send their remaining enemies sailing into the air and then falling down with a sickening crunch. He stares owlishly at the heap of bodies. Only Crabbe thumping him soundly on the back is enough to break his stupor.
Celebrated on the tail-end of Lammas celebrations in August, the Day of Victory commemorates the day the old Ministry fell to the Dark Lord’s power. The Dark Lord will invite guests to the Citadel to accept his blessings, or awards for good service. An award from the Dark Lord on this day is more cherished than any Order of Merlin.
It’s not a long walk, so they catch up on the way there. Mother is extremely relieved to hear that Harry is still treating him well, which makes Draco’s chest tighten with guilt. He ought to be more deliberate about staying current with the people in his life. Radio silence doesn’t often mean good things in their society.
They work together in comfortable silence, Theo gradually relaxing as Draco pointedly faces away from him to focus on his work. It feels like the simpler days of their childhood, before they had to think very hard about war or the dizzying ins and outs of adulthood.
, not for another five hours at least. But then, Harry is no ordinary wizard. It’s something that’s easy for Draco to forget. He’s become used to wandless magic and levitating reports and complex transfigurations done as easy as second nature. His ineffective spell just makes the guilt he was already feeling much worse.
Harry clears his throat and then tamps down on the sorrow creeping into his mind. “No torture, I’m afraid. Just lunch and a conversation.”
As titters and scandalized gasps sound out into the tense air, Harry grins at him. He hadn't been happy, to hear about this, but he'd accepted it with such grace. Draco loves him for it.
Draco nods softly, eyes fluttering closed. He sighs deeply as Harry pulls him into a proper hug, taking his slight weight and rocking them slowly back and forth. This is how Anezka finds them several minutes later, escorted in by one of the maids, who announces her, curtseys a farewell, and then steps out of the room. The door shuts firmly behind her. Harry nods at her in greeting, which is returned by a hesitant smile.
Those words, combined with the almost predatory look on Draco's face, sends a hot wave of want rolling through him. He's on his knees, looking soft and diminutive on his shining marble floors, and Al knows he's completely in control. He always is. He loves it when Draco takes control.
Draco is standing by the open window of the sitting room they’ve chosen for Anezka Newman’s impending visit. He hadn’t been thrilled about the idea of the last day of their short holiday being interrupted, especially by Anezka. However, it would have been foolish to pass up the privacy the Potter estate offers.
Feeling especially petty, Draco says, "Because we're trying for a baby. Did you know? I hear gossip travels fast in the Ministry. In case you haven't heard, Harry and I are trying for a baby. I am in heat and I'd like him to come home and get me pregnant. Possibly on multiple surfaces. Would you like me to be more detailed?"
“Take a little more, sweetheart,” Harry says, pressing gently, and Draco breathes in, lowering until his throat spasms in protest.
“English is a struggle for him,” Anezka says, smiling affectionately down at her white-knuckled hands. “He has to try very hard, and he doesn’t like feeling like he’s not in on the joke. So it’s just always been a rule. One day I saw some of our staff arguing being the most obnoxious muffliato and tried a counterspell. And they were so distracted that it came down, I suppose. They were fussing with each other about how they’d messed up their mission, and now how were they going to get info on the Death Eaters if they couldn’t get their man sponsored for the duels?”
He leans down for a kiss and laughs when Draco immediately turns his head away from Harry’s slick-covered face. They’ve kissed before after putting their mouths all over each other, but he supposes the novelty of the moment has unearthed some of the shyness they’ve been working to bury. He mutters
“You’re a show-off,” Draco grumbles. And then, when Harry bites down gently, a giggle tumbles from his lip like it was stolen from him.
Harry snorts, which has Draco snickering into his hand. They do an impeccable job of fixing their faces when Father glowers at them. Before any more words can be exchanged, a pair of nervous looking servants invites them inside, guiding them through. They pass still painting after still painting, dark tributes to the great works of the people they have conquered. In the throng of bodies, Draco spots Daphne, who waves excitedly over at them. Astoria follows her eyes, and waves as well. Draco has smiles and waves back. Their light-hearted enthusiasm for life has always been soothing in its predictability.
Flushing, Draco looks down. Those deep green eyes will never fail to make him both taller and smaller than he really is. “I’m glad. I feel the same.”
And then he bursts into tears, borne more out of mixed exhaustion and relief over finally saying the words than any other pressing thought or feeling. Harry, despite the shell-shocked look on his face, immediately pulls Draco close.
The door is open when Draco arrives, but it’s not the relief it might be in a different circumstance. Lately, it doesn’t matter how quiet he tries to be. Harry can always seem to tell when Draco is nearby.
He slides one warm hand up, calloused fingers squeezing briefly over the column of his neck, and then cupping the underside of his chin, tilting his head back. Draco lets out low purr, and Harry meets him with a croon, lowering his head to press a kiss on his forehead.
When Harry tells him to touch himself, he’s quick to comply, one hand gripping Harry’s arm as the other takes himself in hand, pumping quickly.
For once, I didn't think there was anything worthy of warning for. Endnotes for this installment are just housekeeping. Enjoy!
“Mr. Pettigrew, hello,” Harry says, smiling. It may be odd, but Peter is one of the few people he does enjoy seeing, for better or worse. He’s squirrely, presumptuous in one moment and sniveling the next, and doesn’t cut a very impressive figure as a squat little man with balding hair.
June 2021 Edit: This began as a gift for a friend of mine who doesn't have an AO3 account and then quickly spiraled into this strange little world of my own creation! It is about as AU as an AU can get, so please just roll with big changes.
Then he starts speaking French a mile a minute, and the Healer turns to face him with delight in her warm brown eyes. Harry hasn’t a clue what they’re saying, but the conversation is a lively one: she laughs heartily every other sentence, and Draco smiles right back.
This gets him a chorus of agreeing hisses from the snakes below, startling him into the realization that they’d been talking in Parseltongue the whole time. It gets hard to tell what language they’re speaking when they’re all doing it. They’ve done the same thing when Father gets frustrated and starts fussing at them in French. When they have nights at the Burrow they often get into side conversations with Victoire, Dominique, and Louis, which usually takes Dad intervening in his awful French to get them to stop.
His eyes sting abruptly, so he laughs to mask the old worry. “The Dark Lord asks for a great deal. Sometimes I don’t see Harry for months on end. But we have each other. I like to think I make it a little better.”
“Sorry, that happens sometimes. It’s--well, that is. Yeah, anyways,” and she goes back to playing, feeling like she’s under a microscope.
“Why didn’t you ever come see us?” He asks, which is probably the question he actually wanted to ask anyway.
Fred shrugs a shoulder, pursing his bottom lip in a show of guileless confusion. “Why did Moldymort decide to conquer the world? Why have you helped?”
He runs his knuckles along Draco’s cheekbones. After a few moments of this, Draco snuffles, then turns his face into his pillow with a whine.
And the thing is, Harry can’t give his word, not really. He has the Dark Lord’s ear and his hard-earned trust, but all decisions on his part are final, and Harry’s already irritated him by asking for too much as it is.
“Yes. I’ll be back, though,” Draco says, standing with a yawn. He walks over to the desk and leans down for a kiss, humming at the feeling of stubble against his chin. “You need to shave.”
“Let’s walk home, hmm? I think the fresh air would do you some good,” Harry says, covering them both in a disillusionment charm. He’s so angry that even the slimy sensation of the charm gliding over their heads doesn’t shake him.
Draco complies without second thought, staring up with wide eyes. After a beat of silence, he reaches for Harry’s trousers, but Harry grabs his wrists, gently guiding them behind his back. When his wrists are crossed over each other, Harry draws his wand, and casts
Harry rests his head against Draco’s collarbone with a groan. His cock had been pressing insistently against his trousers, but now it throbs with need. “You’re going to be the death of me.”
He’s wearing the newest robes Harry bought him on a whim, mostly because he (rightly) assumed that the lovely pastel pinks and greens would suit Draco’s pale skin. He’s got a thin blanket thrown over one arm and his ancestor’s journal tucked under the other. He looks cozy and happy and
He can’t be persuaded to talk any further, and sends Draco through the floo with a tight squeeze on the shoulder.
But then Harry is spreading his cheeks and sticking his tongue into his hole, and all thought leaves him. The wet, smacking kisses he places over his rim are loud, dirty, and then his thumbs are pulling Draco even further apart, questing tongue pushing forth in rhythmic waves. Draco sobs into Harry’s tunic, his hands curling in it tightly enough that he can feel himself pulling grass up in desperate handfuls. Just as he begins to sway back into the movement, Harry pulls away, and he whines at the loss. Harry pauses to soothe him, cooing and running his hand over his back. Then he holds Draco in place with his hand on the back of his neck and impaling him on his cock. The stretch is tender and tight and delicious, and he’s sure that anyone walking on the grounds has certainly heard him cry out. He doesn’t care.
He walks slowly towards the table, pulls the chair out, and stares down at the tray. Harry, feeling weirdly like he’s taking up too much space, takes a seat on the cot. Fred’s back is to him at the table, and Harry can see his shoulders shaking as he dips his head. Hermione’s hair had been streaked gray when he went to see her, but Fred’s hair is still as vibrant and shiny as it was the last time Harry saw it. He wonders if Ron is the same way, if Ginny and George are.
“How do you want me?” Harry asks. He’s still not entirely convinced that whatever prayer Draco did hasn’t shocked him somehow. He’s seen Purebloods all but butcher themselves with ceremonial knives on each and every single day of the Wheel of the Year. He worriedly glances down at Draco’s arms, but they’re unblemished. Still, Draco’s determination to avoid the subject is clear.
If he knew it were a muggle’s composition, Scorpius bets he’d want her to stop immediately, no matter how lovely it is. The thought makes him laugh.
Draco huffs and pouts and looks about two degrees away from a truly spectacular tantrum, but he does listen. Harry could absolutely show him how to use any of these things with words alone. It’s not like he isn’t an expert, from his time with the Dursleys. He still uses Muggle methods of cleaning at Grimmauld Place. Cleaning clears his head, and if his aunt taught him anything useful, it was self-sufficiency. He can’t resist the opportunity to press himself along Draco’s back and guide those soft hands into the right position, squeezing briefly around the broom just once, imagining he’s guiding the boy into doing something else.
“Mr. Potter, we’d really like to speak with your husband,” Auror Davies says, breathless. “We’ve spoken with the other people who were in Richmond that day and we need to corroborate a couple of things.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, cradling his head once more. “You can’t imagine what a relief it is. Maybe I’m overreacting, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.”
“As you know, both of my parents are from families with a history of Dark affinities, my lord. Perhaps my baby is following in the footsteps of their ancestors,” Draco suggests, weakly. Erratic magic is a well-known feature of pregnancies. It’s the sign of a child building their own in the womb, drawing from the Wild Magic’s gift.
He has heard Mother complain about uppity London Omegas for years, but the moment he recognizes the signature of the dowager Sonja Avery, all of her warnings vacate his mind with swiftness. He has been given a standing invitation to attend her afternoon gatherings.
They walk back to the tent in silence. Draco finishes the danish in about three bites and downs the gillywater like he’ll die if he doesn’t consume it all. When a harried looking serving boy passes by, Draco stops him, apologetically hands over the vestiges of his impromptu meal, and then asks Harry for a few galleons for the trouble. The boy’s frustrated expression quickly smoothes over once he’s been paid.
EDIT: There was an inconsistency in the timeline I set up for this fic!!! In this AU, Voldemort has been in power since the 1980s. In the original version of this chapter, I indicated that the month was March, but that's wrong. It is currently November 2014, NOT March of the next year. I'm sorry! I'd been thinking to myself that Harry and Draco married in February, when Draco was eighteen, and have just been married for most of the year. Yet another weird mistake that you make when you write and edit as late as I do.
Draco blushes to the roots of his hair when they pass the cafe along the Serpentine on their walk, where their first heat together began. Harry waggles his eyebrows over at him, which earns him an unfairly powerful smack on the arm. Their small group pauses to watch a group of young people perform a traditional dance. Draco’s family takes turns kissing him on the cheek in farewell and then disperse to mingle with their peers, leaving Draco to explain the different parts of the dance to Harry.
He glances around the room and quickly picks up on the tension in the air. He schools his expression into something appropriately solemn, but it’s clear that he did it too late. Hermione sighs lowly and glances out of the window, visibly containing her frustration. Ron reaches between their chairs to take her hand in his and gives Draco a look that Harry doesn’t at all appreciate.
I understand that the conversion of the place is kind of anachronistic with the setting of this story, but just roll with it LOL I got really excited about the different elements of worldbuilding I was working with. I’m excited to get some more worldbuilding in and push this plot along (in a teeny tiny way).
According to the Aurors, precisely timed explosions went off in a number of Greater London locations, tearing through Pureblood dwellings with protections so multilayered that the should have been impenetrable by all but the most powerful magic users. Efforts to contain the blasts were severely impeded by unnaturally aggressive birds, likely conjured and controlled by magic.
“I’m going to fall!” Draco whinges, for what must be the fourth time since he’s hopped on the training broom today.
“Me, too. I’m terrified.” Harry says cheerfully. Draco’s face is quickly overtaken with comical horror, so Harry hastily follows up with, “But I’m so happy, baby. I’m over the moon to be starting a family with you, you know that.”
“Your Dark Mark, that’s what.” Black says lowly. When Harry does not move, rooted in place by shock, he shouts, “SHOW ME YOUR DARK MARK!”
He cherishes these moments, Harry using his body, hands greedy and proprietary. It sends him into a pleasantly floaty headspace. By the time Harry comes, filing him up, his knot locking him in Draco’s rim, he’s almost completely under, and unable to contain quiet moans.
Harry could get used to this--the quietude of it all, sharing warmth and wishes away from the world at large. The peace it brings him even carries him through the time they spend with Lucius and Narcissa, though to be fair the visit is not as frustrating as it could have been. The Malfoys seem to be soaking in the tranquillity of the holiday as well. They bring several gifts with both of their names on it, though Draco was the one to select them all, and the Malfoys accept them with effusive but genuine thanks. They spend a few hours together, trading stories of Yuletides past, and taking turns sharing their wishes for the future. The mid-day feast is appropriately excessive and delicious. Draco pinches him in the side each time his eyes start drooping.
“It’s not my fault Umbridge will do anything to brown nose,” Harry says, which sends Draco into another fit of laughter.
I cleaned this chapter up faster than I was expecting to so I figured I would go ahead and post it early. Thanks for your interest and comments! They're a big motivator to keep writing.
“Oh yeah?” Harry says, delighted. He drops kisses along Draco’s sternum and then takes a pebbled nipple into his mouth. Draco sighs and arches into him, fingers sifting through Harry’s messy hair. “Did you use it?”
“Why are there so many Muggle things in this house?” Draco asks, tearing his gaze away from the beige-colored drop-down screen.
The comment might have filled Draco with comfort, once upon a time, and no small amount of vindication. Now, he’s sure that the small smile on his face looks bitter.
“Of course I want to, sweet boy,” Harry says, kneeling on the bed. Draco hasn’t even seen Harry’s wand this morning, but his clothes are falling off of his skin like water, slithering lazily to the floor. He can smell the magic in the air, Alpha and ozone. “But you’ll have to take what I give you this time.”
“Although… listen, I don’t mean to put words into your mouth. Or, er, thoughts in your head. But baby, you said what you said with
“How can you not hate him?” Draco asks, feeling his face flush in anger--mostly at himself. If he’d known any of that, he wouldn’t have dared to thank Pettigrew in front of Harry. It is not as though Harry’s parents could have stayed in hiding--the Dark Lord’s power is too vast to suffer disloyalty--but an irrational, protective part of him still chafes at the thought.
Harry lets out a huff of laughter. He runs a palm up Draco's thigh, soothing the ache that's no doubt set into them from being spread so wide. "Oh, yeah?"
Harry gently guides Draco into the seat nearest the window and then sits down beside him, wrapping an arm around his slender waist. Smiling, Draco links their fingers together and rests them on his small baby bump. There’s a little while yet before they’re meant to be expecting any kicks, but the firmness of that growing belly is the sweetest kind of reassurance for that at least something is going well.
“Mind yourself, Kain!” The one on the right says, in a thick Highland brogue. “That’s Draco Potter!”
He squeezes Harry’s arm as they continue on. Harry can’t seem to contain his smile, even through the rather shell-shocked silence between them.
Draco laughs, and then he pulls back and gawks up at him when he realizes Harry is being serious. “How are you going to tell? Are you going to do legilimency on the contestants to see what they’re about to do next? You’re mad.”
3.) I’ve strayed from my usual structure by including both Harry and Draco’s POV in the same chapter, so this installment is long. It was about 31 pages in Google Docs! Usually, I hate, hate,
Draco very determinedly contains his shudder. Touching through the barrier of clothes is one thing, but the Dark Lord’s unnaturally heated skin feels searing against his flushed face. He averts his gaze, watching in muted fascination as the sunlight glitters on Nagini’s deep green scales. As if sensing his gaze, she lifts her great head in a preen, an uncanny amount of intelligence in the singular eye facing him.
. From where I was sitting, it sure did sound like you meant it. Did you mean it?” Harry asks, gently.
“But,” Theo says, placing the diary down on Harry’s desk. “Some of the things this Michel wrote about are disturbing enough to turn even a Pureblood’s stomach. And that’s just what I’ve skimmed. If nothing else, I can’t imagine it’s good for Draco to read it while he’s pregnant. The Malfoys have always been especially traditional, but this is a bit much.”
To his surprise, Scorpius adds, “We can tell him a bit about how we’re doing in school. And the restaurant,, and Father’s potions.”
