Harry stared at it, unused to seeing creatures from the Woods come this close to the House. He had been watching his mother wander outside, wary of the setting sun and what that would mean for them. He’d have to get her back indoors before dark, or he wouldn’t be getting her back at all.
”I wanted to come and see this place one more time,” Harry said with a shrug. ”I told you, closure. You hate magic, but I’m grateful for it - it got me away from here.”
The doors and windows were sealed shut at night, though whether it was to prevent the Woods from entering or the House from exiting, it was hard to tell. It certainly wasn’t a place that would allow for midnight wandering or late-night celebrations.
”That is fine,” McGonagall said. She understood, Harry knew that. And he appreciated her saying what she said, her tone dry and understanding, but not particularly sympathetic. She said it as if there was nothing to be sympathetic about, and for the first time since Voldemort died, Harry felt a spark of satisfaction at something. ”How are the three of you holding up?”
Harry huddled closer to the chimney when he saw his mother walking outside - the last thing he wanted was for her to see him up there. He watched her, and James, and tried to remember what they had looked like before James had died. They’d both been so… happy, despite where they lived. They’d been strict with many things, but had done their best to balance the darkness of the Woods and the House with their own laughter and life.
“They’re looking anyway,” Lestrange sneered in response. “Let them look! Their clocks are ticking and their time is running out whether they know it or not.”
‘Is she there?’ Harry wondered, doubting himself more and more with each passing minute. And yet, he couldn’t quite overcome the knowledge that though he had heard Lily sneak back towards his room, he hadn’t heard anything - including the sound of her sneaking
Harry was careful to not show any of his scepticism. The barely contained anger that oozed out of Bellatrix wouldn’t be tolerant of disagreements - especially disagreements concerning her precious Dark Lord. Harry was certain of that, and he didn’t want to test it. She reminded him of the Woods. Their silent and dark hunger, barely containing itself within its physical boundaries, ready to lash out and devour anything it could reach.
Harry wasn’t sure what she meant by that, but didn’t dare to ask her to clarify. Instead, still feeling awkward, he reached for the copy of the Daily Prophet on the table. On the cover he could see a picture of none other than Draco Malfoy, accompanied by an article discussing how Malfoy had been forced to serve Voldemort, and that though he had been forced, he was willing to contribute to rebuilding the community. ”I didn’t know the Daily Prophet was still in circulation... or that someone would bother to buy a copy.”
“I really wanted to spend the day with him,” Lily said, rubbing the back of her head with a sudden grimace. “But my head hurts. Would you really do that for him? I could… I could bake a cake. For him.”
things, but he couldn’t do the things Harry did. Then again… nothing out there was like him. The Woods weren’t like him, the House wasn’t like him. Ellis Nott wasn’t like him, and most probably the other teacher wasn’t like Harry either.
Necromancy. A word that Harry rarely used himself, but felt comforted by whenever he encountered it. Necromancy. That was his thing. He may not have two good parents or a safe place to rest in like other people in books did, but he had
Eventually walking into wakefulness like a painting quietly bleeding its colours away, Harry opened his eyes to a darkness that wasn’t like that of the Woods. Disoriented and confused, he tried to make sense of what had just been happening. Hadn’t he
He had once – fleetingly – thought about going with his godfather. Just stepping into that fireplace and leaving, but the whole idea had been so unrealistic. He had never done such a thing before, didn’t know if it was even possible for him to leave. And the one time he had dared to approach the fireplace – just to
Uncle Tony had led them to a small, beautiful building with white walls and red paint. Harry didn’t know what they were in this particular place for, but it looked more like a teahouse than anything else, with floating teapots and comfortable seating. A handful of cats were lounging around, basking in the sunlight seeping in through the windows.
“Fine, but I will pick his tutors and arrange for his schooling outside of Hogwarts. You will not interfere with any of it, and will not be hindering our schedules.”
Merlin, he was tired of having people hate him. He was tired of fights and arguments. He just... he just wanted some peace and a handful of friends and no quarrel with anyone, anymore.
”I think that’s good,” Ginny said encouragingly. ”Neville told me that tending to the garden he has at home helps him stay productive and feel better. Maybe fixing up the house - well, as much as Malfoy will let you - will do some good for you.”
– his mother had screamed through her own delusions, nearly losing her breath as she chased Harry away.
he felt fingertips grazing his knees through the floorboards. “Keep your eyes closed. Take deep breaths, and describe everything around you to me.”
”Potter,” Malfoy snapped, clearly struggling to not follow that up with an insult. When he continued, he sounded unintentionally defensive: ”I’m here to sell a cottage my family no longer has a need for.”
“I’m already imagining a cozy Christmas in there,” Ron sighed. “Your very own place, mate. That’s amazing. Even with Malfoy being involved, it’s still amazing.”
“The Imperius Curse,” Uncle Tony started, his voice low and steady as he spoke, “is unique among the three, as it is that only one that can be defended against. When correctly cast, it places the target completely under the caster’s control, which can last for decades. I could have you eating your own arm and you wouldn’t even hesitate.”
“All right,” Harry said, feeling partly nervous, partly excited. He wasn’t sure if he could really do anything about the sleeping part, but showering and eating? He could do that. He’d even done that today, even scrubbing behind his ears and drying his hair with a towel rather than just letting it dry on its own. “I promise I’ll do that.”
,” Lestrange replied, rolling her eyes. “I’m not afraid of that old bastard. Remember, baby necromancer, don’t trust anyone at Hogwarts. It’s a bad, bad place for people like us.”
“I’ve already asked him to spend time with me,” Harry interrupted. “I mean, I said I’d tell him about all the things we did at Hogwarts. I didn’t… I just wanted to be his friend, then. It’s changed quickly.”
Bellatrix – who had told him twice to call her Bella, but Harry simply couldn’t – led him through the chapel, letting out a cackle as she walked past the seats and towards a large door in the back. Harry ran after her, seeing no one else but
”Too many neighbours,” Harry said. ”And too many memories, I guess.” And though he loved the Weasleys greatly, he just couldn’t stop blaming himself for the deaths of George and Fred. He didn’t know how Molly could stand to look at him with no anger. He didn’t know
”That’s... I understand.” And he did, even though his relatives were the way they were. Ah, the Dursleys. Should he go back to Privet Drive? Just one more time to... to... say goodbye, or something. Make sure he had left nothing behind.
“Don’t look down, baby necromancer,” Bellatrix cooed. “What’s down will look up, and you won’t like that.”
"Yes," Bellatrix said sourly. "That little vermin. Him and his parents - they'll be the first to go, I promise you. And oh, it will be painful. I will make it painful for them. There are scores waiting to be settled."
creature can tell that there’s something different about you,” Nott said. “But whether or not they can tell what it is… I suppose it depends on whether they’ve encountered a necromancer before or not, and if they still remember that feeling well enough to identify it now. You’ve noticed how house-elves act around you, haven’t you? And that portraits tend to leave their frames whenever you’re near? There’s something deeply unsettling about you to any creature that is more aware than mere human beings are. Even wizards more attuned to death, such as myself, can tell that there’s something about you that is interesting.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he really understood what was at play here, but also doubted that Nott could give him a better answer than the one he had already received. So he simply nodded, and refocused on the cadaver. He tried to muster up a smile, feeling sorry for the invisible pain of the body on the table.
“Isn’t that good enough, for now?” Ron asked. “If you two will already be meeting for other purposes aside from fixing up the cottage, won’t that be giving you more time to sort out your thoughts?”
Lily had been angry. Angrier than Harry had ever seen her. Right after James’s passing and resurrection, and before things had become
Harry turned away from the allegedly hand-painted cabinet doors to look at Malfoy, who was standing right by one of the windows in the kitchen. “Yes?”
”Of course he is,” Hermione said. ”But we’re no longer eleven, Ron, and there’s no need to keep fighting. Now, Harry, you said you liked the cottage?”
Nott’s eyes widened, and the smile that appeared on his face was larger than Harry had ever seen it before - almost too wide to fit into his face, but that was of course impossible. The man positively glowed, though he still didn’t take a step away from the cadaver when he said: “Excellent observation!”
“There will be muggle-born students who only recently learned of their admittance to Hogwarts. Besides, not many students even from half-blood or pureblood families care to study school materials as diligently as you have. That said - everyone struggles in the beginning. You must keep in mind that demanding constant excellence is cruel.”
”Right,” Nettlewick said, somehow sounding both positive and judgmental at the same time. ”How about this - I’ll give you this portfolio of available houses, and you browse through them in peace. Then we set up the next appointment, and discuss the options you liked.”
He made sure that his door was locked when he went to take a bath and change into clean clothes to appear somewhat presentable before his godfather’s arrival. He had a frightened house-elf deliver his breakfast up to his bedroom, and ate in the safety of his domain. He didn’t know
Uncle Tony let out a sigh, before proceeding to walk through the rooms of the first floor, Harry trailing behind him. They found Lily and James in the kitchen — Lily, digging through the pantry, and James, his remains standing still behind her. The stench was awful, but somehow waved away by a flick of a wand.
“I also broke into the ministry, interrupted a hearing, knocked out Umbridge – she deserved it, let me tell you – stole a necklace off her neck and escaped while polyjuiced as someone else,” Harry added, hoping to somehow make Malfoy understand that for him to become an Auror wasn’t… as obvious of a choice as some people believed. “And that was just last year.”
Harry told himself, trying to not hope. Before James’s death Lily had made sure to have him read many of the boring, dusty and dry books they had in the house. She had told him that he’d need to know more than other children because other children didn’t need to
“Well, I suppose for a future Auror forgiving all criminal activities would’ve been a bad thing,” Malfoy said, turning back to the cabinet handles, and dismissing all but three. “Good to know there are things even you can’t forgive.”
“Yes,” Harry said. He had been unsure about the money needed for him to do his purchases, but apparently that wouldn’t be an issue – his godfather had kindly offered to pay for everything, as Lily clearly was in no condition to go to Gringotts and allow them entrance into the Potter vault.
“Britain’s magical heritage centers around sacrifice and summoning, though they won’t readily admit that,” Antonin explained. “It’s why there are so many strange creatures here, and also why the rules to control wizards and witches are so elaborate - they developed alongside the need for them. This applies largely on the whole of Europe, not just Britain. If you find yourself interested, you should read about the Sirens of Switzerland.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of what the woman had told them, and was grateful when Uncle Tony once again took on the task of asking questions.
“Maybe not,” Harry agreed, “but it’s better than nothing, right?” Because even these small improvements mattered, and he wasn’t going to overlook his budding, hopefully not entirely one-sided, friendship with Malfoy.
“He’s focused,” Antonin replied. “Though I’m surprised you’d even consider allowing a necromancer slip from your fingers like this.”
”The floors and the pipes are fine, but the walls will be painted white,” Malfoy said, leading him into the house where a team of five goblins were already working. ”The fireplace will be redone and then connected to the Floo Network, if that’s what you’d like.”
Explaining that seemed to tell Nott enough, and the man muttered something under his breath, before speaking again to Antonin. “I can teach him
”Maybe?” Ron said hesitantly. ”I don’t know if I can return right away... there’s so much for my family to do, and...” Funerals, Harry realized. Ron must have been thinking of Fred and George, and the funeral, and how on earth could he keep going on when Harry, who didn’t have family members dying in the final battle, was barely functioning?
Harry, who had been about to ask for a cup of tea and something small to snack on, couldn’t quite push the words out. The mundane request crumpled into a barbed tangle somewhere in his throat, and the only thing he could think was:
Feeling tendrils of excitement, Harry did as told. He had barely managed to get a hold of the stick, before they were spinning away, into a city he had never even heard of before. The thought that by the time he’d return here, he’d have his wand, gave him an immense feeling of relief. A relief that only deepened when they reached their destination, and Harry found himself standing right outside what appeared to be a wall surrounding the town.
Harry, who hadn't really thought about practice wands before, didn't really care one way or another. Instead he stared at the picture of a man Bellatrix had hung on the wall in front of them. The picture appeared normal in every way - standing still, even, unlike portraits. It resembled the anatomical illustrations that Nott always had around him.
“When will we go buy my school things?” Harry then asked, changing the subject entirely. “I need a wand.”
Uncle Tony had promised to help, but he had also said that there was quite a bit that Harry would just have to learn on his own. Harry hadn’t discussed the issue further - it was difficult to talk about things his godfather didn’t wish to talk about - but suspected that there was a lot that Uncle Tony wasn’t telling him.
”The moment he died, we could all feel it,” Hermione replied, reaching to take his glasses and wipe them clean. ”His followers started apparating away, but some already— Ron, were you in the Great Hall earlier? Bellatrix is dead—”
”It’s fine if you want to visit,” Dudley insisted, and Harry could hear a choked sound escape Petunia. Piers was observing the whole situation with the shifty-eyed awkwardness of a person stuck in a scene that was clearly none of their business. Harry walked past him, and headed towards the front door. He didn’t fancy staying any longer - not when Petunia wasn’t feeling sorry in the last.
“These don’t notice everything you need to be aware of,” Bellatrix continued, her red mouth twisting into a grin. “You’re right,” she whispered. “There’s a woman in the box. And a man by the door. And another hanging from the ceiling. I can’t see them anymore, but I know they’re there - I was here when their bodies were put up to dry.”
“It’s a good taste,” Harry replied, not knowing what else to say, and not really seeing an issue there.
“Vurney,” Harry called, his voice barely above a whisper. He pushed himself up to a sitting position, feeling cold. A shaking house-elf appeared in his room a moment later. He looked at it, once again resenting its fear - why was it scared of
”Nonsense,” Hermione said instantly. ”Malfoy will hardly try to trick Harry now! Not when he has so much to lose! Besides, he owes Harry his life.”
“Mum’s there,” Harry replied. “She’s alive. Dad’s there too, but he’s been dead for a while. I don’t think he’s going to be moving for much longer.” Harry expected Crabbe to latch on to that, and was relieved when the man didn’t.
”We can go to the Burrow for that later on,” Ron said. ”I doubt they left our dorms undamaged, and even if they did... maybe it’s better to shower at home.”
Harry let out another annoyed sigh, before climbing out of the bed and heading towards the closed door. From the corner of his eye he saw the house-elf sweating and tearing up, its fear almost tangible. He hated it. How many years had it been? Harry had never hurt anyone -
“You’ve both taken a vow of secrecy,” Uncle Tony said, and Harry, who didn’t quite understand the exchange between Nott and Lestrange, felt relieved when he knew what that meant, at least. “The longer Harry’s abilities are kept secret, the better. Meanwhile we will make sure all of his practicing will be done here in Russia – consider it a loophole of sorts, if you must. I’ll also need someone to teach him the etiquette his parents never cared much about.”
"Solar plexus," Bellatrix then said. "Hard to hit, but effective in knocking the wind out of your opponents. Great for cutting curses - aim here to make sure they won't stand up again. The liver is also a good place to take aim at, especially if you wish to cause long-term damage. The groin is excellent for immediate distraction, although if you wish to make them hurt while still leaving them with hope of survival, a cutting curse there too will do a trick - and not just for men, baby."
, you could’ve owled me at any time,” Uncle Tony replied, watching Lily with an expression that revealed the barest hint of disgust. It was funny, Harry had always thought, how despite being his godfather, Uncle Tony and his parents never acted like they were
“Oh yes, absolutely,” Harry said, touching a cabinet handle made to look like a curled dragon’s tail. Merlin, it was beautiful. “Draco, this is… exactly what I need. It’s perfect. It’s better than anything I had imagined.” The whole cottage was filled with light, rays of sun dancing across wooden surfaces, reflecting off the white walls and adding life to every corner that they reached.
, and no one could make him feel like he didn’t belong. He had grown up here, and didn’t have a single memory of the other house his parents said they’d lived in before - somewhere in Godric’s Hollow, apparently. Lily had spoken so highly of the place, and so had James.
Well, now… that wasn’t something Antonin wanted to get into. “Your parents had no strong political affiliations at all. They chose to simply remain aside throughout the war and focus their energy on raising you and maintaining a peaceful existence.”
was quite like Harry. It was one of the few things that Lily and Uncle Tony were in agreement of, and they both had told him many, many times that should he ever encounter other people, he’d have to keep the things he could do a secret. Other people would fear him, he’d been told. They’d hate him. And while Harry didn’t know what exactly that entailed, he didn’t think he’d want to experience it.
“Little baby necromancer,” Lestrange cooed. “You’ll be absolutely wonderful, won’t you? Auntie Bella will teach you exciting things to show off at school.”
“I asked Nott why people are scared of dying,” Harry said, “but isn’t living like that scarier? Wouldn’t it be better to die fast rather than be… like mum.”
It didn’t seem believable, and even after he held back the assessment wand, the thought that anyone could – just from that – somehow figure out what kind of a wand would be perfect for him… it just didn’t seem possible.
“Partly,” Uncle Tony replied. “But mostly it is about this talent that you have - this talent that you would have regardless of whether or not you’d have chosen to bring your father back. You have a splendid gift, but for it to serve you well in life, you need to learn things ordinary schools cannot teach you. Do you understand me so far?”
Malfoy’s shoulders hunched up for a moment, in a clear gesture of discomfort, before he turned to Harry with a sneer on his face. “I suppose Saint Potter would forgive someone who treid to kill him. Repeatedly. You’d forgive… you’d have forgiven him too for what he did, wouldn’t you?”
Not that he had been to Hillcrest often. Even when his parents had been both present, he had rarely been allowed out of Mordred’s Mend, easily spending years never stepping a foot into another place. He had certainly never visited his godfather’s residence enough to get used to the large, dark place with its warm torches and wooden walls.
”It’s nice,” Harry said. ”I like it. Say, did you ever live here? I mean, did you ever visit the place?”
Meeting Malfoy again, and on purpose this time, was such an odd experience. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about it, other than that he felt
had gotten worse. His mother, too. Where before she had been sadly flitting from room to room, crying and trying to make sure Harry was well, James’s return had done something to her.
“You’re not wrong, but do read about them, it’s an interesting case that shows how stupidity blooms in grounds fertilized by greed and ignorance,” Antonin replied. “People are criminally uneducated when it comes to history, not recognizing how important it is to understand how the world we exist in today came to be, and why is it the way it is –
“Let’s forget normal, then,” the witch said. “Let’s just figure out what makes us happy, and focus on that. And try to do the right thing whenever we have the strength for it.” She was nowhere near ready to tackle the issue with her parents, and Harry desperately wished that he could help her somehow. Make it easier for her to deal with.
“In theory, it sounds possible,” Nott said dryly. “But how would you attach the soul back to the body? It has never been done before. At any case, you won’t be doing anything with souls until you learn the basics of body preservation at least.”
Harry thought, still watching his mother outside, now circling the fireplace Uncle Tony had connected to the Floo. There was no powder for her to use, however, and so Harry didn’t worry about where she’d end up.
“So you wouldn’t dismiss the tears in your eyes as bright-eyed enthusiasm,” Malfoy replied, before sighing and swaying forward. “Potter… you’re not happy. And you know what guts me the most? I don’t think you’ve ever been happy, for as long as I’ve known you. I thought that I had… I thought I understood you. ”
Association with those people would cast Harry into a lifestyle the boy would likely never understand. Unlike other pureblood children, Antonin knew that Harry had been kept away from political discussions of all kinds, knowing only the barest of versions of how the First Wizarding War had ended with the fall of the Dark Lord and the survival of the Longbottoms. He didn’t grow up knowing how their kind hand been wronged and how their power had been chipped away bit by bit.
“Okay,” said Harry again. He thought about what he’d like to share about himself, and thought about Bellatrix’s aggressive and hostile resentment towards hesitation, and said: “I’m… I’m Harry?”
At noon he was ready to leave. He left the house, walking the few steps from the front door to the fireplace, and carefully avoided looking too deep into the Woods. He clutched his bag tightly against his chest, and Flooed to Hillcrest.
"And then another one of my favourites: the knees," Bellatrix said, now moving the knife lower on the illustration. "Relatively easy to get to - people often forget to protect their legs - yet can throw your opponent off-balance and leave them crawling for safety, unable to attack you or defend themselves against you. They become little more than flies in your spider's web, trying in vain to struggle their way out. Now - questions?"
“Whatever, Potter. Come on, now, let’s test the fireplace to make sure everything works as it should, and then I need to ask you a bit about colour schemes.”
“It’s olive wood,” the witch told them. “It’s very strong, easy to work with. Known in myths and legends as a symbol of peace and friendship.”
“I thought the letter would arrive on my birthday,” Harry continued, picking at the fish on his plate. They were in Manchester, in a restaurant owned by a man Antonin knew to have sympathized with the Dark Lord back in the day. The restaurant was frequented by former Death Eaters, which had kept drawing Aurors for unannounced drop-ins for a long time. Eventually, when nothing suspicious was ever found, the Aurors moved on to other places - or at least became more subtle in their snooping. “But I suppose that wouldn’t make sense, right? I spoke with Mr. Crabbe about Hogwarts a few weeks ago, and they’ve got these Houses— Bellatrix thinks I’ll be a Slytherin, and—”
Harry thought. He didn’t know for how long Lily would keep James around, but didn’t think she’d let go anytime soon. He’d have to figure a way to coexist with the stench, somehow.
“You son will eventually be leaving to attend school,” Uncle Tony reminded her. “Despite what I suggested last time—”
'Yikes,' Harry thought. He didn't really feel one way or another about the Boy-Who-Lived, but then again... he also didn't feel much about the Dark Lord or any of the people Bellatrix kept hissing about.
Of what his parents had told him about Hogwarts – and the Gryffindor House in particular – etiquette had never really been mentioned. They’d spoken to him about Quidditch and the library and lessons and the Hospital Wing, but never about
Harry thought then, but didn’t dare to voice that question. Bellatrix spoke as if him being able to revive - in some meaning of the word - his father made him part of another world altogether, which was just… absurd. “Okay,” he ended up saying in the end.
He didn't know if Lily would try to look for him - if she was going to do that, then checking under the bed was surely the first thing she'd do. Merlin - he'd really have to figure out a better hiding place for the future, just in case. It couldn't be anything obvious, like the wardrobe or under the bed where he was now.
Harry thought, looking at his bare feet. They didn’t hurt, which surely was an indication that he hadn’t walked for a long time before reaching this place, right? The ground let out wet squishing sounds as he hesitantly moved a few steps before stopping again. He could barely see clearly two feet in front him, the treetops shielding away the moonlight that perhaps could’ve helped him figure out where to go.
understand what the two were saying, he couldn’t help but feel that there was something in the conversation that he hadn’t grasped. He just… even after all this time, he just wasn’t used to following conversations between other people. He wasn’t used to that.
“You’ve done a brilliant job with all of this,” Harry said, moving out of the kitchen area. “I’m… this is amazing.”
“Who else is with you there?” Crabbe asked. Harry wasn’t sure if the man knew the answer, but, well… he
It stood all by its lonesome deep in the Northern Woods, where the trees were dead, and the roads were alive. Sunlight could never quite reach through the branches to warm the icy creeks and hollow burrows, leaving everything in a permanent state of early winter. The silence that reigned in these woods tapped the windows of the house at night.
“—and look,” the man said, pointing at the patches of skin still hanging on to the cadaver. “Touch it. The give of the skin is different from the fresh ones, you see? So if you want to keep a body going, you’ll have to nourish it. Just getting it up and running isn’t enough. Now look, this other one - she's
“I told him about the basilisk, too,” Harry said over pints of butterbeer to Ron and Hermione. “You should’ve seen his face! I didn’t know how little everyone had been told about our shenanigans.”
“I’m not in a joking mood right now,” Harry said. “You’re not… you can say no. I’m not expecting anything of you, you know.”
“They don’t have the magic you do,” Uncle Tony had told him once. “Their lullabies do nothing. The darkness around them is empty. They have the peace of peasantry – the ignorant and the fool, lulled into a false sense of safety. You’re free of that, Harry. You’re not asleep.”
Saturday was a few days away, and all Harry could do was patiently wait while doing his best to not see either one of his parents. He desperately missed fresh air, but didn’t dare to venture out when he knew there’d be no one inside to call him back if he couldn’t return on his own. The Woods were almost as hungry as the House, and he didn’t wish to become nothing but a trail of fading footsteps in the ground.
“But it matters to Bellatrix so much, and even though Crabbe tried to be neutral about it, he also definitely wants me to end up in Slytherin,” Harry pointed out. Antonin sneered.
that that’s how trees were supposed to be, and yet… their stillness felt temporary, as if they were simply imitating ordinary trees, waiting for Harry to no longer be wary of them.
”I’m not surprised,” Malfoy sniffed. Harry wondered if Malfoy thought his feigned displeasure was somehow convincing, and decided to just leave the matter be. Malfoy had always been a bit quirky in his own way. ”Fine, I’ll take care of the small details, which you will then ruin with whatever decor ideas you decide to implement.”
”There will always be people willing to believe in the innocence of purebloods,” Ginny replied with a grimace. ”Because no matter what, there will always be people who have nothing else to value about themselves aside from purity of blood. To them, purebloods can do almost anything and they will be excused. I don’t think Malfoy will escape the consequences completely, however. There’s too much evidence against him and his dad.”
Eventually Draco felt his heartbeat slowing as he focused on Harry’s beautiful eyes and on the warm, calloused hands resting on his cheeks. Draco’s breath became deeper and more even as he accepted the facts. Harry, the best thing about him, was finished with him now. It had been nothing but an impossible dream.
Well, Draco had had a delectable sampling of it the other day, anyway. Harry had become more reserved, it seemed, but was still as kind as ever. Almost shy, in some ways. A little awkward, a little unsure of himself. Draco didn’t want to dwell on how he felt about any of that; he only knew that it had all been enough for him to ask the man (
“Because I’m in love with you,” Harry said quietly. “And the people I love tend to have a fifty-fifty chance of staying in my life.”
Suddenly Harry sat up again and shimmied down Draco’s legs, placing his fingers on the button of Draco’s trousers. Mercifully Draco had forgone a belt as well, and Harry quickly and dexterously undid the button and pulled the zipper down. Even though Harry was nearly naked, his jeans bunched up around his thighs, Draco couldn’t look away from his face. The desperate, hungry way that Harry stared back at him made his cock leak.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and groaned. “This is the only thing I can come up with, but I actually think I’m right about it. Please don’t be offended, and just hear me out?”
“Of course I don’t, Potter!” Draco spat out. “I meant what I said at my trial. The things my family stood for became abhorrent to me as soon as I was old enough to understand better. That wasn’t a lie I told just to keep me out of Azkaban, despite what the general public may have believed.”
Finally Harry veered left into another room, yanking his jumper off as he entered. Draco stopped himself at the doorway and realized that this had to be Harry’s bedroom. The canopy bed, stately grandfather clock, and huge armoire looked like they belonged to anyone but him, and yet he flung his jumper over the dark blue wingback armchair in the corner as if he was very much at home here. The room was untidy, but not as dishevelled as Draco had imagined. Not that he’d ever imagined Potter’s bedroom. Obviously.
“I’m into skinny blondes with angelic faces, as it seems,” Harry muttered, dragging his fingers softly over Draco’s back, up and down. “The paler the better.”
“Allow me,” Draco volunteered, and Harry couldn’t help but look over at him upon hearing the gravely timbre in his voice.
“‘Mr Potter appears to be not only delusional but paranoid,’” Draco pretended to read from his notes. “‘He also demands constant attention, the obvious conclusion being that he’s been permanently damaged by years of overexposure.’”
“Are you ill?” Draco immediately summoned him a glass of water without waiting for an answer. “Drink this.”
When Harry’s chest was almost flush against his, Draco let go of his hands and snaked his arms around Harry’s neck, hugging him even closer. Harry let a small ‘mmm’ escape his lips as he wound his own arms snug against Draco’s back, and Draco drank in the sound.
“No, you were at four, I was at six, and now seven,” Draco told him. “Though I daresay it should only be six and a half; that one hardly counts.”
to get out of there. He just wanted to go home, and he wanted Draco to be there with him. “And thanks for having us.”
‘Or maybe it’s because you need to pick up my quaffle for me,’ Draco desperately wanted to say. ‘And maybe I really, really want you to.’
“Better than yesterday,” Harry replied, taking a gulp of tea. “Though I did receive an interesting owl this afternoon.”
“Thank you, my darling,” she said, and she kissed his cheek. “Come, let’s get you something to drink.”
He nodded eagerly. “Yes, I understand. I’ll send him an owl straight away. Thank you, ma’am. Really, thank you.”
“You know you can come,” Harry said, turning and walking out the bedroom door before Draco could answer.
He knew Harry had gone by now, and he couldn’t bring himself to go back inside and see nothing but his empty house. And Harry somehow belonged in that house now. He could feel it in his very core. Yet, once again, his fear had dictated the course of his actions, something he had always vowed, without success, to change about himself. Perhaps cocking things up was one of the many things that were so 'very much Draco’ of him, as Harry had said. Harry had always had the mark of him, after all.
Harry knew that the Dursleys had already been moved back. Their temporary relocation had been chalked up to the house being renovated, which had been provided for them to make the story more believable. Harry had been told by Arthur that the Dursleys had been very satisfied with the house, which was hard for him to imagine. He hadn’t ever seen them satisfied with anything, as long as he was still around.
He knelt down in front of the window and rested his chin pathetically on the windowsill, taking in long breaths of chilly night air until the nausea had ebbed and his body had cooled down some. The disturbing image of little Rose’s ghost still danced behind his eyelids.
“Look, Harry,” Draco sighed. “I don’t hold it against you. Our feelings for each other all came about so quickly that maybe we did prematurely rush into a relationship.”
“Fine,” Harry sighed, smiling indulgently. “We went to school together, which I’m surprised you didn’t pick up on as soon as I called you a Slytherin.”
in his mind. He wanted to kiss Harry. Wanted to do more than kiss Harry, if he was totally honest. Somehow, in the course of just one evening, Draco had fallen into something very significant with his former enemy. Denying it would be foolish, at this point.
“Perhaps we should just shower together from now on,” Draco suggested with a smirk. “To save time, of course.”
“I’m sure it goes without saying, but I’d rather no one know about any of this,” Harry said softly. “Ron and Hermione know. The Weasleys know some of it. And now so do you.”
Draco gasped and tossed his head back, reveling in the sensation. Slowly he began to move his body, feeling Harry’s cock sliding inside of him. It felt… Merlin, it felt beyond incredible.
His throat burned, and he was unable to look at her again, unable to add anything else to his woefully feeble apology. To his surprise, she reached over and squeezed his hand for only a brief moment before pulling it away again. It was so strange… but he didn’t hate it at all.
“Yeah, likewise,” Harry mumbled, rolling his eyes teasingly. “You’re just as domineering as you always were.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Really?” He almost admitted that he hadn’t either, but Harry shook his head and continued talking before he could muster up the courage.
Draco sighed. “Will you resolve whatever tension has arisen between Harry and yourself sooner than later? Though I can’t for the life of me understand why, fighting with you causes him pain, and I don’t want him to suffer unnecessarily.”
“Someone who fought in a war alongside the person who killed Fred Weasley,” he said tentatively, staring at Draco with cautious eyes. “I guess… maybe there was some truth to what you were saying earlier.”
Harry’s voice broke and Draco pulled him against his chest. They were both crying now, and Draco knew these tears were pent up from the emotional stresses of the past two days, for both of them. Releasing them now felt like a cleanse, and Draco hoped they were having a similar effect on Harry. He hated seeing Harry sad, no matter what he had implied earlier.
But, most tellingly, if this had been his own bedroom, there wouldn’t be someone breathing softly against the back of his neck. No, that, in particular, was a beautiful novelty.
He and Potter walked in silence for a few minutes, inconveniently going against the grain, as most people were heading towards the pub that he and Harry had just exited. Draco noticed the throngs thinning the further they walked down the streets, however, eventually trickling down from bustling crowds to groups and couples to the odd straggler, until finally he and Harry were quite alone on one of the side roads some distance away from the Leaky Cauldron. It was still fairly early, but the sun was drifting lower in the sky, and Draco felt a peaceful hum in his belly that was altogether pleasant. Probably the alcohol. Definitely the alcohol.
Harry burst out laughing. “Remember how I said you look cute when you’re nervous? I amend the statement to: You look cute but slightly unhinged when you’re nervous.”
Draco chuckled and raised his eyebrow at him, but he said nothing. He wasn’t sure whether Harry meant it as a compliment or not, but he considered it one.
“You were so quick to let her go, without really considering your own future. I mean, you knew it wasn’t right, but you stayed. You waited for her to leave, because then you knew, at least, that she was happy, because it was her decision. You’re so quick to let others’ happiness come before yours. It’s part of your savior complex. It’s why you pick up other people’s quaffles, as it were.”
“Well I’m very glad it wasn’t a complete waste of your time,” she said kindly. “Is there anything else you need from us?”
Before Draco knew it, he was coming too, releasing stream after stream onto Harry’s bedding as he groaned indecently, his eyes squeezing shut with the pleasure of it, and he knew, without a doubt, that he would never recover from Harry James Potter.
Dammit, Harry was frustrated and tipsy and horny as hell, and in his experience, that was never an ideal combination. He could only assume that throwing Draco into the mix would result in some uproariously stupid decisions, and he didn’t have it in himself to care which particular stupid decision he would end up making this time around. When it came to Draco Malfoy, all bets were off.
“Of course not,” Draco muttered. If he hadn’t known any better, based on that experience, he would’ve assumed Harry had sucked off every man in the country. “You told me as much. Last night, remember? You told me you’d never been with a man, you gooseberry.”
“No, I’m not angry, Harry, I’m…” He didn’t finish the sentence, and Harry felt a sick sense of guilt in his stomach as he watched Draco take a long sip of tea.
“You remember what my glamor charm looks like?” Harry asked, instead of answering him. He couldn’t help but smile back at Draco. It was simply too much
“Very well,” Draco nodded, refusing to rise to his teasing. “Thank you for today. I know it was a long one.”
“Or, you know, for the foreseeable future,” Harry amended softly into Draco’s ear before kissing it.
“Oh come now, Potter,” Draco huffed. “Are we really going to descend to that level of immaturity again?”
“How does noon work for you?” Draco asked him, desperately trying to remain professional, even as it hit him with overwhelming clarity that this was Harry’s bedroom, and this was Harry, in it, in the bed, looking up at him, smiling… Oh fuck, Draco had to leave.
Hastily he stepped into a pair of his comfiest jeans and shoved his journal, a pen and some money into his rucksack. He didn’t think anyone would be up and about at this hour on a Thursday morning, but, nevertheless, he cast a quick glamor charm on himself out of habit. Without giving it much thought, Harry apparated to the alleyway behind the only place he knew to be open at this time of night: a 24-hour muggle coffee shop just outside of Diagon Alley.
“I’d heard that she… that Tonks was a metamorphmagus. That’s interesting, that he is too.” Draco smiled, lost in the wistful and rather depressing thoughts of all the fun he could’ve had playing with her as a child.
“When have I ever claimed to be a romantic, Potter?” he grinned. Harry pouted at him, and he rolled his eyes. “Cummy sheets.”
Draco couldn’t articulate his feelings. He needed another list. Being back here again, particularly when he hadn’t expected to feel anything at all, was…
“Not yet,” Draco answered, rolling his eyes. “I’m only wondering why you didn’t tell them sooner. I can only imagine how they felt, once you finally revealed that I was the one coming over.”
Draco reread the letter three more times before quickly taking a piece of parchment, ink and quill from a drawer in the kitchen. He willed his hand to stop shaking as he dipped his quill in the ink, but before he placed it to the parchment, he paused once more.
Harry screamed and writhed in pain on the floor, but his tortured cries were entirely drowned out by piercingly loud, sinister laughter. Draco looked over at the Dark Lord, but he was no longer there; the laughter had been Draco’s.
Harry had stopped pretending that he didn’t miss Draco. Not even the storm was enough to distract him from it.
Harry may have been feeling apprehensive about this, but he couldn’t help snorting to himself; so much for casual. He flopped himself down onto the couch. Perhaps Ron had been right about the potential floor show.
“Safe travels?” Harry mocked him, folding his arms in front of his chest, and oh dear, those muscles looked more appealing than ever. Draco was damn near convinced that Harry was doing it on purpose, just to toy with him. Mission accomplished.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. “I think I’m just getting less and less willing to put myself out there as I get older. Haven’t had a shag in like eight months, either.”
“There were a thousand times I wanted to kiss you that night and I just lost all my nerve,” Harry continued.
“The rivalry,” Harry clarified. “You and me, bitter opponents, and all that. I’ll deny ever saying this, not least because it makes me sound ridiculously arrogant, but you were the only real competition for me on the pitch.”
“You’re gonna tell me what happened?” Harry asked, taking his wand out of the pocket of his joggers and summoning Draco’s cup of tea from the counter. He held it out for him to take.
“You’re welcome.” Harry smiled sweetly at him, pushing the problem aside for later. “Little consolation prize for you losing at quidditch today.”
“I suppose I must acknowledge the possibility of that, now that I know you like Pearl Jam,” Draco said. “Ten is one of my favorite albums of all time.”
“You should always be naked, Malfoy,” Harry replied, eyes raking salaciously over Draco’s body as they both stood. “And anyway, your garden is fairly private, who’s going to see you?”
Harry flexed for a moment, just to mess with him, and he was delighted to see that Draco licked his pretty pink lips in response. It was kind of a fun game, really, a game that Harry always won.
He could feel Harry’s breath against his lips, feel the body heat from his chest, his legs, his groin. Draco swallowed as he felt himself grow stiff beneath his pants, Harry’s pants, really, and he gasped as Harry cupped Draco’s cock in his hand, rubbing it gently.
“Sorry, is it bothering you?” Harry said, pausing momentarily. “The Healer said it might help with the pain--”
Although… they had a point, didn’t they? Draco didn’t want to hurt Harry; more than that, the thought of hurting Harry made him physically ill. But they’d both ventured far enough towards each other now that a little bit of hurt was inevitable, wasn’t it? Draco was a reporter, and Harry was the subject of an interview. End of story. He knew he’d allowed his feelings to blossom out of control, but he’d somehow foolishly convinced himself that he'd been doing it alone. If his two best friends were saying these things now, surely Harry had also tumbled into something with him, somewhere along the line? He felt equal parts worried and ecstatic about that.
Draco had declined the offer to participate in an after-dinner pick-up quidditch game with Harry and Ron, opting instead to remain as professional as he could this evening (finger-playing under the table notwithstanding), and to ask a few questions of Hermione one-on-one. He’d gotten as much as he thought he was likely to get out of Weasley during dinner and their subsequent clean-up session, so all that was left was to wheedle a few slightly meatier answers out of his wife. Though he hated admitting it, he was nervous for this part of the meeting. After all, if anyone's hatred of him was justified, it was Hermione Granger’s.
“And drink some water when you get home,” she instructed. “Hangover potion isn’t something you want to become dependent on.”
“This is Webster,” Draco answered smoothly before Harry could reply. “Roger Webster. We’re old schoolmates. And as I said, we were just about to leave, so if you’ll excuse us--”
Draco didn’t bother to answer, because he knew that Harry would be able to read in his face just how sure he really was. Instead, he stared directly into Harry’s eyes as he reached down to grasp his own hard cock, breathing out a deep moan of relief at the touch.
Harry didn’t quite see how the two things were related, so he waited for Malfoy to elaborate. When he didn’t, Harry slowly reached across the table and gingerly began to pull the folder towards himself. This time Draco didn’t try to stop him.
“Yes, well,” Draco said. “A general report card must include positive comments as well as complaints, no? And I have several positive comments about you, Harry, one of which is that you snore. And yes, I do like it.”
“Not at all naive,” Harry replied. “And now that I know how serious you are about being professional, I would never dream of taking advantage of you.”
As Harry’s pleasant giggles echoed down the hallway, Draco sighed. He tossed down his floo powder and tried his best to ignore the fact that leaving Harry felt utterly and completely wrong.
“You’re… you’re gay?” Draco asked, completely taken aback and fumbling for words. “But… the Weaslette…”
“Come on,” Harry said, groaning as he clutched his hair in frustration. “Why won’t you just flirt with me again, dammit?”
“Actually, Andrea, your timing is impeccable,” Gareth told her. “Harry, maybe it’s best if you just go; this is obviously too personal.”
“Oi, I’m here to collect my partner,” Andrea’s cheerful voice bellowed through the doorway. “Harry, you ready?”
“We did,” Harry replied, clapping him gently on the arm before hovering casually over his desk. “What are you working on?”
Harry glanced down at the card, and his heart stuttered. The very first thing Harry saw, winking up at him from the small card, was the Daily Prophet crest.
“Yeah.” Harry smiled sadly back at him. “I reckon it’s selfish of me to say this, but one of the things I miss the most about him is that he’s not around to tell me about my parents.”
“Well, if we’re done here for today,” Nott said, “I’ll take my leave. Potter – I’ll see you on Monday. Dolohov… we’ll keep in touch.”
“Okay.” Harry’s little face was serious, and it was impossible to tell what he really thought of the things he was hearing. “In the letter they listed things I’d need to buy. Probably from Diagon Alley?”
”I’m looking for something smaller,” Harry said, pushing away the picture of a castle half the size of Hogwarts. ”I live alone, after all. I don’t need much.”
to Hogwarts, it would be a disaster waiting to happen. You don’t need to understand, Dolohov, but you do need to accept. You trusted me with his education – do you really think that I’d do something to harm him now?”
“Only this once,” Lily relented with a sigh after a moment of contemplation. “But you have to find him first. I don’t think he went into the forest - he knows better than to trust the trees.”
Antonin nodded again, a hint of a smile appearing. “I’ll tell you, but you must remember to not discuss these matters with
”Living a sickly life in solitude is amazing to you, Potter?” Malfoy said, too bewildered to come up with an insult. ”Really?”
“You’re absolutely sure that you’re fine with having my taste all over your home?” Malfoy asked, strangely insistent on his point of conflict. “Are you certain?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Ellis hissed. “If you want him to pull through in the long run and not end up like Bellatrix toeing the line of lunacy, you’ll have to train his mind where you train his magic and body as well. His living conditions are atrocious - are you
It was funny, perhaps, in some way, that it wasn’t long after his encounter with Petunia that Harry bumped into Draco Malfoy.
“I like this plan,” Harry said, nodding. “I feel like Hermione wouldn’t like it, though. She’d just… deal with all this in some sensible way.”
"Neville Longbottom, right?" Harry asked, vaguely remembering the name that had popped up here and there as he'd studied history or read the Daily Prophet. "Will he be at Hogwarts?"
Harry thought, forcing himself to bypass the moments of contemplation during which he would’ve thought of any underlying meanings or missions. Instead he simply did what Bellatrix asked of him: describe everything he felt, heard, and smelled. And when he ran out of the obvious things - the cold air, the sounds of her breathing and the wind outside, his own discomfort - he latched onto the stream of thoughts he had lost control of.
“It’s fascinating,” Nott - who kept telling Harry to call him Ellis and then sneered whenever Harry did so - said. “All these people. How hard they fought to live just a moment longer. Can you hear them scream in agony? Can you taste their very presence in the air?”
“This isn’t stone,” Harry said, touching the wall. It was firm and solid, rough to the touch, and yet he could tell it wasn’t made of stone.
“I don’t think that’s to be taken for granted, you know,” Harry said, turning towards Malfoy, and taking a few steps towards him. “Why so much light?”
”Careful, the stairs were caught in a blast, so parts are missing,” Hermione said, still leading Harry forward. As they kept walking, they met more and more people. Some tried to talk to Harry directly, but Ron was there, quick and ready to shield him from them. He was grateful - Harry really didn’t think he could talk right now. He kept thinking of Ron’s brothers, and—
Luckily he was with Uncle Tony, who led him towards a table that was fairly secluded, and pushed him to sit down. Moments later a piece of paper with a list of food and drink options - written in Russian, allowing Harry with his limited grasp of the language to recognize only a few - appeared. Occupying himself with making sense of what was written made it even easier to push any thoughts of the morning into a small corner, temporarily stored away.
”No, don’t take him to the Great Hall,” someone said, and Harry felt a wave of relief wash over him when he realized it to be Professor McGonagall. ”The hospital wing is full as well. Take him to my office. You know the way, Miss Granger. The password is feather duster.”
is to teach him as much as possible before anyone catches on to what’s happening. Because the moment Dumbledore or one of his pesky little lions hear a peep of what Harry here can do, you best believe they will interfere.”
Antonin Dolohov didn’t care for the boy’s parents, but he did have a place in his heart for his strange little godson. And it what that place that flooded with apprehension as he thought of the people he would have to introduce Harry to. It was necessary - allowing the gift of necromancy to remain unharnessed would be a blasphemy - and yet…
Well, he knew instinctively how to make his father move. He knew what he’d read about what necromancy
”Good morning,” Ginny said, as soon as he stumbled his way into the kitchen. Her red hair was in a braid, and she looked composed and content. Well, as content as grief would allow her to be. When she gestured towards a covered plate, he could see that her nails had been painted in different colours. ”Well, it’s almost noon, really. Everyone else is out, but Mum left something for you to snack on.”
. His losses were older than that, weren’t they? He had lost the people who were a family to him well before the battle even began, and though Professor Lupin’s death had been a shock and he was sad, he had never been that close to the man.
The voice that broke the silence in the office was dry and low, like a hiss, yet it chilled Harry to his very bones. He twisted on the chair, expecting to see an evil creature of some kind, but was surprised – all he could see was a man whose appearance showed nothing that justified the wariness he inspired. The expression on his calm face spoke of some underlying amusement that seemed to be somehow etched into it. His round eyes were an odd mix of grey and gold, the thick-rimmed glasses doing nothing to hide them. His hair, beard, and mustache could have been once black, but were now a darker shade of grey.
“Okay,” Harry said again, not doubting her. He wasn’t sure what absence of hesitation really was, though, and it worried him a little. What if he just wasn’t good enough? He didn’t want to end up in a well somewhere - especially considering that aside from Uncle Tony, it wasn’t as if anyone else would actually search for him.
”And you... like the place?” Ginny said, lying by the fireplace in the Burrow. Harry, resisting the urge to fall asleep, nodded.
Bellatrix kneeled in front of him, to get to his eyelevel. She then poked the corners of his eyes with her sharp nails and said: “don’t trust these.”
“We’re some fifty miles North of Banchory,” Malfoy said. “This area is called Taernsby. Not that many know of it - not many live in this area, as you probably guessed by now.”
He would have to call her back soon. Or send a house-elf to collect her. The sun was setting, and it wouldn’t be long until they ran out of time. He didn’t much care about leaving James’s remains out for the night - what could befall someone already long dead? His mother, on the other hand…
wouldn’t be able to live with. The most common expression he has on his dumb little face is that of confusion. He’s startled too easily, he’s fatigued and has clear signs of exhaustion. His physical health is bad, he’s too thin and too pale and too fragile. He has difficulties concentrating. He’s anxious and afraid, withdrawn to the point of – for fuck’s sake, Dolohov, the boy is a hermit! Does he even talk to anyone but us?”
“What kind of a wand is it?” Uncle Tony asked, eyeing the almost cream-coloured wand with its dark, curling grain. Harry had never seen a wand like it before.
”Harry, how are you feeling?” Hermione asked, and she sounded so concerned that Harry almost managed to respond. To his relief, however, Ron spoke up first.
In the end, Antonin didn’t have any words with Lily. When he came to Mordred’s Mend on that Saturday morning, the witch was nowhere to be found.
Harry clenched his eyes shut and shook his head. He led out a quiet little groan, before blinking his eyes open and forcing the grimace that had taken over his face to disappear.
“We lost the first time around,” he said. “I barely got unscathed, and he fact that the Lestranges and the Malfoys are still free is nothing short of a miracle.”
“You’re weird like that,” Malfoy said, though it came across a bit too fond to be an insult. “Everything here creaks, even after the renovation. Hell if I know why, but it’s good that you’re fine with it.”
He wasn't going to leave his hiding place unless he'd absolutely have to, and if that meant that he'd be skipping out on his lesson with Mrs. Goyle, then so be it. With any luck, Uncle Tony would come and fetch him and somehow fix this situation that Harry had found himself in unexpectedly. And if Uncle Tony didn't realize that Harry hadn't attended Mrs. Goyle's lecture, surely Mr. Crabbe would alert him to Harry's absence.
“Antonin,” she said, the sweetness of her smile twisted by the rest of her appearance. “We’ve missed you! You haven’t been here in so long—”
“I honestly don’t know,” Harry said. The two fell into a silence, focusing on their ice creams, until Harry spoke again: “So, there’s something weird that I want to kind of… tell you about?”
Resentment, deep and dark and angry, splashed inside of him. It felt simultaneously like a deep, bone-rattling ocean of rage, and a small, barely blooming little flower inside of him.
"Okay," Harry said, once again not really liking whatever lifestyle Bellatrix was apparently imagining for him. "Thank you."
Harry, feeling anxious all of a sudden, nodded. What if he ended up unsuitable for any wand? What if he didn’t have enough magic in him for a wand?
“Good luck with that,” Harry muttered, immediately feeling guilty afterwards. He was getting along well with Malfoy, and talking ill about him didn’t seem as fine to do as it used to be. Besides, Hermione was right, and it was fairly easy to see that Malfoy was struggling with his own demons as well.
“That’s a unique approach by his parents,” Ellis said. “Though I’d like to suggest including regular therapy in his pre-Hogwarts curriculum.”
”Considering the situation his mother was in at the time, he couldn’t possibly refuse,” Hermione countered. ”And trust me, I’m not particularly fond of him either. However, we must put conscious effort into moving on from past grievances. I think it’s fantastic that he’s taking such an active role in fixing the house for Harry before handing it over to him.”
“We’re looking for Harry,” she said, voice just barely loud enough for Harry to hear her from his hiding place, even when carried up to his ears by the Woods. “It’s his birthday.”
"No one," Bellatrix replied, before pulling out a knife and using its sharp tip to gesture at the illustration. "I'll show you where to aim your little spells to get the best out of them, baby necromancer. You see - it makes a hell of a difference if your little jinxes hit someone in the leg or the neck. And that difference can really safe your life some day."
“There’s someone under the floorboards,” Harry said, his heart beating fast. “There’s someone else by the door. And a woman in the box. There’s a
Harry nodded. He wasn’t sure if he’d be actually able to understand everything, but how could he predict that when he didn’t know what Uncle Tony wanted to tell him in the first place?
Draco rolled his eyes and rubbed his thumb against the top of Harry’s hand. “I was obviously lying, you nutter.”
“So you hated me as well?” Draco asked him, looking comically pleased about the fact. “Then surely now we can call it even?”
No. Harry knew that wasn’t true, and he hated himself for even thinking it. He hated that he was unable to trust people, even people he cared about. Most of all, he hated that Draco Malfoy wasn’t sitting on the armchair across from him, primly sipping his tea, tapping his quill on his lips and making Harry fall for him.
”I’m not really looking to live in a crowded area,” Harry admitted awkwardly. ”I just want a small place in a peaceful neighbourhood.”
”That will cost you extra,” Malfoy instantly shot back, and then turned to look at Harry with yet another look of suspicion. ”And no refunds if you don’t like it.”
odd. His glasses went a long way in distracting people from his strange eyes, and the way he dressed spoke only subtly of his wealth and status. He wasn’t aggressive, gloomy, or unpleasant, but neither was he chipper or welcoming. His face was often a mask of polite indifference, with a hint of a smile fading in and out of existence. There was nothing alarming about him, and yet—
”It’s all right,” Harry replied. ”It may be better for everyone to wait until the house is done, before visiting. Just to make it a nice surprise.”
In Hillcrest, Harry was led to his godfather’s study again. Walking through the dark corridors was now more familiar than it had ever been, and he had become quite good at ignoring the things no one else could see or hear either. It was even easier to ignore the empty portrait frames and the disappearing house-elves.
There were some truths he knew about the House, though he had never questioned why they had remained despite it all. It was as clear to him as anything - the sky was empty, the woods were dark, and the Potters lived in Mordred’s Mend. And just like he knew that, he knew that the birds with bent necks were looking at him, and that the house-elves were scared of him, that the portraits were empty because of him, and that the corridors in this House weren’t safe.
He stood up on shaky legs, picking up a black jumper from the floor and pulling it on. His inner Hermione cautioned him against being up so late at night when he had a mountain of work to contend with in the morning, but he didn’t want to stay in this house a moment longer, and he really didn’t want to be alone. He was sick to death of being alone.
He’d been writing for a short while in the silence of the coffee shop when he heard the door swing open, followed by a vaguely familiar voice at the counter.
Draco’s eyes followed them suspiciously; Merlin’s sake, Gryffindors were not exactly subtle, were they?
“Amazing culinary skills, eh?” Harry tried to tease Ron, but it came out more than a bit breathless.
“You don’t have to be in control all the time, you know,” Harry said softly, and the words burrowed their way into Draco’s every cell.
He hadn’t kept up with much wizarding gossip over the years, and he was positive that he’d heard next to nothing about Malfoy’s sexuality, but he wouldn’t be terribly surprised if Malfoy wasn’t straight.
“No, I suppose not,” Draco sighed. “War is a lot for anyone to handle, but it must be near impossible for a teenager who carried the fate of the entire wizarding world on his shoulders.”
Harry sat down on the couch across from him and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees and staring intensely into Draco’s eyes.
“If it makes you feel any better, I’m sure most of what you said had at least a grain of truth to it,” Draco acknowledged. “Harry tends to have blinders on, where I’m concerned.”
They stopped at the small bench beside the rose bush and turned to face each other. Draco reached for Harry’s other hand so that he was holding both.
“Tell him never to mention silver eyes, romantic letters, or absolutely anything having to do with French, ever again, under pain of death.” Ron gave him an honest grin then, and it made Draco feel surprisingly hopeful. “At least not when I’m around.”
“Mmm,” Harry muttered, nodding slowly in agreement. “And what about your father? And that’s not my third question.”
“I imagine you and I in the same House, in the common room after everyone’s gone to bed, and you’re alone, and you’re jerking off, and I come in and see you and just watch for a while,” Harry spouted, wanking slowly.
Draco wasn’t too confused to let the compliment settle on him like a fresh spring rain, calming and delighting him at once. He felt a shy smile creep onto his face.
“Don’t worry about it, Ferret.” His voice came out like warm syrup and Draco felt every part of him shiver in tandem. Harry purposely nudged him, shoulder to shoulder, as he passed by him to the bar. Draco wished he could stop smiling. He wished he could ignore the heat in his arm at Potter’s friendly touch.
implied that there would be more, didn’t it?--and Draco opened his eyes, and he smiled nonchalantly, but there was a hint of bashfulness there, and he was too pretty, and it was all too much. Without allowing himself to consider it, Harry leaned down and planted the tiniest kiss on Draco’s cheek; Harry’s concerns about hurting him were all that stopped him from doing more... but oh, how he wanted to. That face simply demanded to be kissed.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, too focused on him to notice the commanding presence on the opposite side of the room. “You look well. Sorry I’m a bit late, work was mad. Where’s Ron?”
Draco’s senses were immediately inundated with bright colors and loud, boisterous sounds, seemingly coming at him from every direction. He gradually tried to take in his surroundings, but it would’ve been impossible to see everything; everywhere he looked was an explosion of color. Merchandise seemed to spill out of every corner in a chaotic fashion, nearly overwhelming him. A vibrant display of fireworks was going off sporadically overhead, showering the shop with effervescent bursts of light.
“Maybe. Anyhow, it makes me think that I gave you too little credit when you told your parents yesterday,” Harry continued, fixing Draco with his piercing green eyes. “The way your father reacted… Well, that was probably even harder to deal with than Ron. And if I didn’t tell you this yet, then I’m really, really sorry you had to go through that.”
Harry smiled at him. “Well… I’ll owl you when I get back, okay? To confirm Friday. I know how much you love confirming things.”
Sure enough, he kept talking. “I was only thinking that it’s rather humbling to be the one listening to all of this. And that you trust me enough to be that person for you. It’s an honor.”
“Exactly,” Harry told him in a chipper voice, giving him an enthusiastic thumbs-up. “Now that we’re older, I’m sure we can handle a couple weeks in each other’s presence without committing murder.”
“It’s alright,” Malfoy said quietly, glancing over his shoulder to make sure they weren’t overheard by the barista, but he had disappeared into the back room. “I’m a wizard as well.”
“Of course,” Hermione said, shifting her glance between Draco and himself. “You’re more than welcome. Please, have a seat.”
Harry nodded immediately and squeezed his hands. “Okay. That’s fine. For now we’ll just sit here and think about nothing, yeah?”
Harry pushed him roughly onto his back and crawled on top of him, and before Draco knew what was happening, he was being kissed as if the world was seconds away from ending. Harry’s tongue was everywhere, his hands everywhere else. Draco could barely breathe.
“Like I already told you, I almost was,” Harry laughed. “And it just seems really unfair that I’m telling you every single thing about me, and you’re sitting there all close-lipped and stoic.”
“Would it help if I told you my type now?” Draco ventured, rubbing his fingers softly on Harry’s t-shirt clad chest.
Draco stared at Potter’s hand, still held up for him to shake. He was right, of course. They had been through a lot. Too much, really. And as much as he hated admitting it to himself, Draco didn’t want to count Harry among the overwhelming number of people who hated him. But he simply wasn’t sure if it was possible for them to move on from the sheer magnitude of what they had done to each other. Agreeing not to be enemies didn’t just cancel out the fact that they used to be.
Harry read it four times before he allowed himself to breathe out a deep sigh of relief. At least Draco was alright.
They looked at each other for a few seconds, until Draco spelled Harry’s empty glass full of water, and then did the same to his own ridiculous mug.
“I fought against them in a fucking war, Harry,” Draco interrupted him angrily. “A war that led to the death of their fucking child! Your best mate’s brother!”
Harry didn’t hesitate. He set a glass of water and the plate of two cheese toasties haphazardly on the coffee table and folded his arms firmly around Draco.
Draco shrank a little at the insufficient word, but then he realized it was the truth, if not the complete truth. Before anything else had happened between them, Harry had become his friend first, and despite what they were to each other now, that friendship was a fixed cornerstone in their relationship. He smiled, bolstered, and looked up into the shocked face of his father.
Draco lifted his head and rested his chin on Potter’s chest. “You remembered that, did you?” He smiled softly at Harry.
Draco finally shed his jacket and took a seat at his desk. Though he kept himself busy with various mundane tasks throughout the morning, his thoughts tiptoed again and again to that elusive, mysterious Stranger. Who on earth had it been?
“No,” Draco said quickly. “I have loads more questions for you. Plus we still haven’t even touched on the war, remember? I was merely pointing out how much material you’ve given me already.”
“Actually, you’re probably on to something there; I think maybe me and Patrick didn’t work out because we were a bit too much alike,” Harry continued pensively. “Go ahead and insert your jokes about our idiocy here.”
“Only white lies, Potter,” Draco assured him. “That you were the very picture of propriety, that your advanced years had mellowed your blatant disregard for the rules, that you had finally tamed your chaotic hair, etcetera.”
Draco wasn’t sure why, but he felt slightly embarrassed, as if he had just revealed too much. Harry finally looked ahead as they continued walking on.
The sight of Harry’s stiff cock, as always, nearly stirred Draco into madness, but he tempered his desire, wanting to take his time savoring and worshipping Harry’s prick. He nudged Harry’s legs wider apart and took his cock in one hand, kissing his way along the inside of Harry’s thigh.
Finally admitting defeat, he set the book aside with a huff, shot back the last of his now cold tea, and wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. He brought the empty cup into the kitchen and shuffled up to the window, curious to see if it was raining yet.
Draco nervously waited for Potter at Florean’s, a massive cup of coffee in front of him, and fiddled with his quill. It had been a chilly day, so the shop was fairly deserted. They would have privacy, at least.
“Harry, we knew this was a likely scenario,” Draco said, panic coursing through him at full speed. “But I refuse to let you give up on me at the first sign of discord. Particularly when I haven’t even done anything wrong, might I add!”
lovely. You deserve to be praised. You’re smarter than just about anyone I know; you’ve been through hell and allowed it to help you grow as a person; you’re good at fighting with me; you’re sarcastic and maddening and mean and it’s undeniably sexy. You’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. You smell glorious. And I want to be around you. And it scares me too, just so you know.”
“I don’t do it on purpose,” Harry fired back. “I mean, not usually. And anyway, neither of them really cared.”
“Well, to be fair, you did say that a reporter was coming to talk with us,” Ron reasoned. “You just failed to mention that it was Draco sodding Malfoy.”
Draco was about to lie down on Harry’s chest again, but Harry sat up, spreading his legs and pulling Draco against him. Draco folded himself up in Harry’s arms, and Harry cradled him against his warm body.
Draco couldn’t possibly describe to Harry how appealing that offer was. He nodded nonchalantly. “That’s fine by me.”
He held his arm out and patted it twice; Ariadne obediently flew to him a moment later. Draco went inside and nudged her onto his kitchen windowsill, feeding her a few pellets from the ceramic container he kept nearby.
“Alright, talk to me, then,” Harry said. “You went awfully quiet. Did you puke up your voice box in there as well?”
They spoke about flowers as they entered the dining room, which is when Draco felt himself becoming skittish again. He was outrightly panicking a moment later as his father entered the room in a flurry of billowing black dress robes, panicking as the three of them sat down wordlessly at the dinner table, panicking as he felt his parents’ eyes on him.
Harry had already pulled on the pair of navy blue boxer shorts that Draco vividly remembered tossing onto the bed post at some point in the last few hours, and he was now turning in circles in an attempt to spot the rest of his clothing.
