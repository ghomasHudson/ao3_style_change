“It doesn’t matter.”
“Potter,” he growled. “What the hell do you want?”
“Well, tell that to Proudfoot.”
“And how come you didn’t tell me about all this?”
The Parkinsons came forward to hug Draco and Theo, and to introduce themselves to Lavender and Harry. Of course, they fawned over Harry, assuring him that they had believed him from the start and that they had always been behind him. Harry, to Draco’s relief, smiled graciously enough, accepting their compliments before suggesting that they all sit. As everyone took their seats, Draco looked around the table. This was perhaps one of the oddest assortments of people he had ever been a part of.
“Did you not erase it?” Draco whimpered. “Why can I still remember? Everything—I can remember
“It’s not my place to say. And stop trying to distract me. This isn’t about Blaise; it’s about you.”
Suddenly, Potter sat up, frowning. “Does it seem quiet to you?”
Draco’s heart stopped for a moment. “Is the Room still working?”
“I’m going to try to go deeper, if I can. It might hurt.”
“Millicent!” Daphne cried. “Why would you say that?”
Harry glanced over at Draco. “This is my, er…”
“We practice loads,” Harry insisted, leaning forward to plant a kiss on Draco’s shoulder. “All kinds of things.”
Potter frowned at his wand; it stayed lit.
“Really? You bought us time. You confused them. They didn’t know what to think.”
“What about? Not…not what happened last year, surely?” Theo shifted nervously. “That’s all been cleared by the Ministry…he must read the papers…”
“Be nice,” Pansy hissed.
open the package. I’ll write you shortly.”
“No, you don’t,” Harry mumbled, still rubbing at his eyes.
“Brilliant,” he said, smiling ruefully. “Of course, it’s a bit odd, isn’t it, being married at a time like this…you want to be happy, and start your life together, but then there’s so much work to do…so much happening…”
“Maybe not.” At the other end of the class there came a great burst of laughter. Draco looked up, annoyed, and watched as Weasley pushed Harry aside playfully. And that felt…strange. He had the peculiar thought that
“Quiet, here they come!”
“They’re better. Coote ditched his girlfriend, so that’s been a big help. We’re getting there. And you’ll be at our first match, right? Gryffindor versus Slytherin?”
“I had a choice.” He turned to Proudfoot, looking down at him, and for some reason he hated the man’s sympathetic face. “We all had a choice. And I made mine. And now I need to make another one. The right one, maybe, this time.”
“Deeper,” Draco groaned. “Go deeper. I’m fine.”
Harry sat down, watching Mr. Dawson as he bounced away. “That went alright, I think.”
“It bothered me a lot,” Harry said quietly. “The first memory we saw—Hermione said it was something about my aunt shouting at me. So that didn’t really matter.”
“Oh, is that how it is, now? Are you a professor, Potter? Do you wander the castle making sure everyone’s behaving? Or are you working as Filch’s understudy?” Draco smirked as Potter’s face turned red. Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Draco cut him off and spat, “I’m headed for my meeting with Slughorn, if you’re so concerned.” And with that he spun around and stormed down into the dungeons, urging Potter to hex him. He was suddenly so furious, so affronted, that he would have been happy for a reason to fight Potter, wands or not. But he heard nothing but silence as he headed towards Slughorn’s office. In his bad mood he was about to bang on the door, but he paused, took a deep breath, and forced himself to knock politely.
“Alright, I’m done.” He stood and gazed down at them with all the dignity he could muster. “You two keep discussing me. I’m going to bed.”
They were quiet for a moment, Draco looking up at the canopy above them, Potter still studying the Mark. “Is it weird?” Potter asked. He spoke so quietly that Draco almost didn’t hear him. “Not being able to remember?”
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know.”
His heart leapt in his chest at the sound of Potter’s name—did Proudfoot know? Was he in trouble? “They’re going well, I think.”
But Theo went on: “Draco’s never willing to see anyone as an equal—have you ever noticed? He’s only ever known how to look up or down at people. He's spent the last few years being bossed around by You-Know-Who, and otherwise he fancies himself superior to everyone else.”
“Maybe now that you have a new wand, the old one has no allegiance to you?” Harry suggested.
deserve it. You tell me.” He turned to Harry, barely seeing him. “You know everything. You always know right from wrong. You have since day one. God, it’s so fucking annoying. So you tell me, tell me now: does he deserve it? Did I?”
“It’s weird, hearing you curse in your poncy accent.”
Draco had never seen Daphne fly before; she wasn’t particularly graceful on her Cleansweep, but she kept up with them well enough. Nott and Zabini, like Draco, had been flying since they were young children. Pansy was outright dirty—she had no qualms with blagging or cobbing other players. Once in fourth year, she had given Draco a particularly nasty blow to the face, and he had been wary of flying with her ever since. Millicent was uneasy on a broom. She stayed low to the ground, hovering around the pitch as the others raced past her. Zabini found a Quaffle in the Slytherin changing room, and they spent an hour lobbing it back and forth. On his Firebolt, Draco was able to soar through the air with ease, turning with barely a touch of his handle. The wind whipped through his hair and cut across his cheeks, but it was bracing, and his fatigue seeped away as the frigid air cleared his mind. He even laughed outright when Daphne sent the Quaffle hurtling past her intended target, Pansy, and instead caught the side of Theo’s head.
“It was the Chocolate Frog card!” Daphne said. “I was up late, I couldn’t sleep…it’s been bothering me, thinking about what the others said, about Dean…so I was up sorting my Chocolate Frog cards, when the Harry Potter card started waving at me! Jumping in the frame, flapping his arms everywhere, it was actually quite funny…and the portraits in the cards can’t speak, you know, but I realized he was mouthing something to me: your name!”
Harry’s hand twitched, and for a second Draco thought he might reach for him. Instead he stood, a funny look on his face as he said, “Come on, let’s get going.”
“Well, that’s better,” his mother said as she set down her cup. “Gifts, then, I think?”
“You look tired.”
“This was nice,” said Lavender.
“Would you stop? You’re acting like my mother.”
“I think…” Harry sat back, considering him. The tip of his wand still rested on Draco’s Mark. “I think I just find it weird, seeing you with your friends.”
good, he’s so talented…”
“Oh, here we go,” Blaise muttered as Lavender returned to their table with the other Gryffindors in tow.
“I do have them sometimes.” Sniggers from the Slytherins.
“I’m fine,” he said without thinking. That response had become automatic to him, as natural as breathing. When Potter said nothing, he reiterated, “I’m fine.”
“Everyone in the castle,” Harry said. “I got it from Fred and George in my third year, but it’s my father who made it…my father and his friends.”
“Mr. Goyle,” Proudfoot snapped. “I’ll thank you to leave us to it.”
Draco shook his head. “If you haven’t found it, it isn’t there.”
Lupin winced. “Still nothing. We have no idea where they’ve fled to.” Draco held his breath, expecting Lupin to interrogate him again, but the moment passed.
“Oh, I’ll be supervised, don’t worry,” he muttered. “Potter’s teaching these bloody lessons with me.”
“You might be interested in the latest issue of the
When Draco arrived in the clearing, Potter wasn’t at his usual spot. Instead, he was standing off to the side, hands in his pockets. Frightened that something was wrong, Draco edged towards him. “Potter?” he called, sounding braver than he felt.
“Dobby?” Draco frowned. “He was my parents’ elf. He rescued you, at the Manor. Does he not work here anymore?”
“You know how Potter is,” he said. “He’s only happy if he’s playing the Auror. He probably thinks we’re all up to something.”
Draco stood in front of the little mirror hanging on their wardrobe. Blaise was already gone—he wanted to send a letter before breakfast. After all these years at Hogwarts, Draco still found that he needed to look in the mirror to arrange his tie. As he straightened the knot, pulling it to lay at the base of his throat, he considered his reflection. Between yesterday and today, he was unchanged. And that was what he couldn’t understand. He had spent all night awake—not upset, not scared, but pensive, dragging his fingers through the filmy green curtains surrounding his bed as he tried to digest what had happened.
, but his legs still felt heavy, his arms stiff.
“Yeah, it was...yeah.” Trying to regain his composure, he asked, “You’re sure that was your first time?”
Harry cupped Draco’s face and rubbed his thumb across his cheek. “There’s always a chance.”
“Really?" Draco couldn't help but grin at that.
“They’re going to France, to meet Fleur’s family. I think they want to get away…first Christmas without Fred, you know…”
As the students around him shouted and clapped, Draco felt dizzy. He knew at once what was happening—another one of his episodes. He gripped his knees, trying to concentrate on the match. Pritchard had just made a spectacular save, earning himself a loud cheer from the Slytherins. Draco tried to bring his hands together to clap, but they were shaking. If only everyone would shut up for a minute. Their screams, the sound of their feet pounding against the wooden stands, Longbottom’s voice droning on…it was too much. He felt as though he was going to be sick. The voice in the back of his head had returned, warning him that something horrible was going to happen, that he was in danger, that there was no escape. Nott was yelling something next to him, but he couldn’t hear over the sound of his heartbeat pulsing in his ears.
They were walking through the grounds, bundled tightly in their winter cloaks. Draco illuminated his wand so that they could follow the path to the Great Lake. Thanks to Harry’s Warming Charm, they were quite comfortable, and Draco enjoyed the gentle breeze against his face. It felt good to be outdoors.
But Blaise was still smiling in the direction of the Hufflepuff table. Looking up, Draco saw Kevin Whitby wave at them.
the memories. But it’s better that they’re there.”
“It’s really not—well, alright, it
“Really, Potter? A bit forward, aren’t you?” He tried his best to sneer, but his heart wasn’t in it.
“That she must have spoken to me, too,” Draco said dully. “That she must have offered to make me an appointment.”
“Draco…” Harry trailed off. He sounded as lost as Draco felt.
Draco doubted very much that he would be able to make the trek to the castle in this state. He barely had the energy to sit up. Annoyed, he growled, “Just go, Potter. I’m fine. I’ll catch up.”
“I told you, I’m trying to help my father.”
dropped neatly next to Pansy’s plate. “Oh, look, Draco,” Pansy said, smoothing out the front page. “Some of the Death—er, some of the defendants will be appealing next month.”
“Where is everyone?” he asked, slumping down next to her.
“Do you need help?” Harry asked, jumping up from the sofa.
“Draco.” Harry gently touched his shoulder. “Your mother.”
“Dinner?”
“How’s your Mark?” Harry asked.
“Everything hurts,” he said, and it was true. The very tips of his fingernails throbbed.
“Do you want to say goodbye to your father?” Harry asked, coming to stand next to him.
“Is that why McGonagall and Proudfoot chose you to lead the study groups with Harry?” asked Goldstein.
Draco sat back and listened as Lupin droned on. It seemed that the Dark Lord was gathering all kinds of followers—the Dementors, giants, and werewolves were particularly concerning to the Order. Draco stared into his teacup as Potter listened with rapt attention. Finally, as Lupin took a moment to inhale, Potter asked, “Are those our letters?”
Draco held up his hand to quiet her; he had expected the skeptical looks on their faces. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but you need to drop it after that. Alright?”
They walked back to the castle in silence, Draco holding his Firebolt tightly in one hand as though it was a talisman. Not for the first time, he wondered why he didn’t just mount his broom and fly somewhere far away. There was nothing left for him here. He looked over at Blaise, whose expression was as indecipherable as ever. In a sense, he was glad that Weasley had interrupted them. He wasn’t sure how far he would have gone, but he felt so disoriented, so adrift, that he might just have used Zabini to try to chase away his unhappiness. And that would only land him in an even bigger mess.
“You two haven’t been fighting, have you?”
Draco pulled out his wand, gathering his thoughts in preparation.
Harry looked up at him, surprised. “I mean, there’s Ron. But he’s barely keeping it together as it is.” Giving him a rueful smile, he added, “He’d kill me, if he knew I was telling you all this.”
She looked very much as though she wanted to say something, but Blaise—thankfully—dragged her away. For the second time in the last hour, Draco felt everyone’s eyes on him. He followed Harry down the stands, telling himself to ignore the whispers. He expected Harry to lead him onto the pitch, where the Gryffindor team was still loudly recounting the highlights of the match, but instead they headed for the teachers’ box.
Draco knew he was as red as Harry’s robes. Although Lovegood hadn’t pinpointed who exactly Harry was looking at—it could have been anyone—he still slunk down between Blaise and Pansy.
“We will?” Draco muttered to himself.
“Borrow mine, I’m not even taking Potions this year,” said Nott.
After a moment, Pansy and Blaise finally retreated, shuffling out of the classroom along with the others. Draco wanted badly to sit down—he felt as though he was going to collapse at any second. Instead, he swung his satchel over his shoulder and leaned back onto the desk, forcing his face into what he hoped was a look of detached boredom.
?” Draco demanded. “I’m trying to
happy. God, you’re so stupid sometimes. Can’t you see how happy I am?”
“How very noble of you.”
“But we already saw that one! And my Mark looks the same. It didn’t bother me, I swear.”
“I’m going to ask you something,” Harry said quietly. Draco noticed that his eyes were trained on his lips. “And you need to be honest with me.”
Draco remembered very clearly, although he didn’t enjoy reliving the conversation. “You said you were…anxious.”
“It’s just practice,” he grumbled.
Harry smirked. “You know the answer to that.”
“You just need a rough chop,” Draco advised. “And start with your onions, you’ll want your jewelweed as fresh as possible.”
“But…but…” He was lost for words.
“Can I touch you?”
Draco had gone cold. He didn’t want to write a quiz—not today, when his nerves were on edge. He cursed himself for eating nothing at breakfast. Vector swept through the rows, passing them complicated numbers charts. “You will complete the chart,” she said, “and then you will provide me with an explanation of the magical properties of the numbers you derive from your calculations. You have one hour.”
“Don’t you find it odd? That all of a sudden Potter is so
, I said. Why’re you always holding yourself like you’re about to be hexed?” He took Potter’s hand irritably and spread out his fingers. “And who taught you how to hold a wand?”
Coming to his senses, Draco held back up his wand, pointing it at the doorway. Finally, when it seemed that Proudfoot was truly gone, Draco let his arm fall. “Thank God you were here.”
“I barely understood last week’s reading,” she moaned. “I’m completely hopeless at numbers charts.”
“What’s the point of it, then?”
The moment he felt himself sucked into the roaring whirlwind, Draco recalled how much he hated traveling by Floo. Squeezing his eyes shut, elbows tucked in, he grimaced as he spun. Around and around he went, everything he had eaten for dinner turning in his stomach, until finally he felt solid ground beneath his feet. Stumbling out of the grate, Draco glanced upwards—they were in the Atrium. Harry was already running ahead of him towards the lifts. Their footsteps echoed loudly on the polished wood floor. Draco had never been inside the Ministry after hours before; the enormous, empty hall was rather disquieting. The Fountain of Magical Brethren—and, Draco thought bitterly, the bloody Magic is Might monument—had been replaced by a gleaming white pyramid carved with the names of those who had fallen during the war. Having passed by the memorial countless times over the summer while attending his hearings, Draco knew nearly every name by heart.
“And what about your boss? Is she still awful?”
Draco glared over his shoulder at him. “I don’t need your bloody money, Potter, for fuck’s sake. Just leave me alone.”
sketching! And it was very good, I’ll have you know!”
“Milk? Sugar? Lemon? Honey?”
“Er—yeah. Last night I was working on levitating things nonverbally.”
“What?” Pansy asked. She glanced between him and Draco. “Your test?”
for years, could be
Draco was quiet as he watched Harper yell at the Slytherin Beaters, who were utterly hopeless. One of them had managed to slam a Bludger into the other, setting off a massive argument as the other players begged them to stop.
“It wasn’t nothing,” Harry said quietly. “I thought…I don’t know, that the Ministry had gotten you, or somehow your father had done something awful…”
That was it, then. They wanted him gone. The realization only strengthened his resolve. As politely as he could, Draco said, “I understand, sir. There won’t be any more problems.”
Draco turned the scroll over in his hands. For a moment, he thought of chucking it—perhaps into the Great Lake—but, giving in to his sense of duty, he unravelled it. There was a single line:
He didn’t know what to say. There was no defending himself, and he couldn’t think of any excuse he was willing to share with Slughorn.
Sighing irritably, Proudfoot raised his wand again. “I do regret this. But you’re leaving me no other option.”
Draco nodded stiffly. “Will that be all?”
“Right,” Theo said skeptically.
Oddly nervous, he said, “So, I just…I’m calm, confident, I think of the spell as I cast…don’t make a big production of it. Go in with intent and keep it simple.”
“Alright, Blaise? Draco?” Theo reached out and clasped their hands. The sight of him was startling: the last time they had seen each other was over the summer, as Draco attended his own hearings and Theo accompanied his father to his. He had been thin and gaunt back then. But now, he greeted them with an easy smile. Tall as ever, he stooped down to kiss Pansy’s cheek before pulling out a chair for her.
“And you looked fine,” Draco snapped. “Smiling and clapping and cheering Gryffindor on.”
Draco felt a silent scream rip through his throat. Terrified, he looked over at Harry, who was staring at Madam Webb defiantly.
At that, a low buzz of whispers erupted among the eighth years at all four tables. “You will,” McGonagall said, voice rising, “be meeting with your Heads of house tomorrow to discuss your career plans after Hogwarts, and to the fullest extent possible, we will be organizing opportunities for you to complete some basic job training in addition to your coursework.”
Relenting, Potter turned towards Draco. He took a deep breath, steeled himself, and then: “
Fuming, he replied, “I’m not tired. I’m fed up with all this.” Realizing that he could just clean the spot with a Scouring Charm, Draco took out his wand, but he was too shaken to manage it. It terrified him to be fighting with Pansy like this—he hated conflict, hated arguments, hated disagreeing with one of his only friends. But now that he had started, he couldn’t seem to stop. “You think anyone really cares about the Sacred Twenty-Eight?”
“It was working last night,” Potter grumbled. “Let me see you do it.”
He looked up. “Staghorn. That’s for tumours, right?”
“None.”
“I’ve had a bit more information about where we’ll be headed,” he pressed on. “Your mother’s quite happy, somewhere in the south of—”
“Do they…know? That you like blokes?”
Very gently, Harry reached up and pushed the hair from Draco’s face. “They’re not nice,” Harry admitted. “It won’t be great. But you can do it. If anyone can do it, it’s you.”
“Dunno.” Draco shrugged. “We shagged once. Ever since then he’s been rather keen on me.”
Potter had that serious look on his face again. “I wouldn’t even try, if I thought it would hurt you. But I trust Hermione. And it worked fine when we tried it on me.”
Draco couldn't meet Potter’s eyes as he came back down. Silently, they gathered their things. It was clear that Lupin could sense the tension between them. In an overly cheery voice, he said, “And you’ll be able to see Hedwig again, Harry! She’s at the Burrow waiting for you.”
Just surprising.” When Harry hesitated, he said, “I’m fine. Go on.”
The house-elf named Kreacher looked up at him with his pale eyes. “Draco Malfoy,” he said, a note of awe in his voice. “You are Miss Cissy’s son. And a cousin to Master Sirius and Master Regulus.”
As they headed down the stairs to the dungeons, Daphne telling him all about her plans for the holidays, Draco mulled over the happy thought he had used to conjure his Patronus. Resigning himself, he knew what he needed to do.
“Draco, I…” Potter trailed off. He reached up and traced a finger along Draco’s lips, studying him. “I just want to…”
“What happened in class?”
He felt giddy as Harry shifted to sit by the edge of the bed. He placed his hands on Draco’s knees and he understood, letting his legs fall apart so that Harry could settle between them. This was intimate on an entirely different level. He couldn’t help his embarrassment as Harry gazed at him, running a hand along his inner thigh. He had never felt so exposed before. The sound of the stopper as Harry uncorked the vial was very loud in the quiet bedroom.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, his voice husky. He came to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair, tipping his head back ever so gently.
“You don’t have to have a relationship with your father,” Theo said. “If you want to cut him off, fine. But do it on your own terms. Not because you’re afraid.”
“Stop glaring at your wand. Why do you always look so angry? You’re not squaring off against the Dark Lord; you’re performing first-year magic.”
Annoyed, Draco swung his satchel over his shoulder and strode out of the library, deliberately ignoring Cauldwell. For a moment, he allowed himself to wonder what Potter had wanted to say, but he put it out of his mind. He had a massive amount of homework to get through, and he had promised Pansy he would help her with her Potions essay in exchange for the chocolate truffles her parents had sent her.
They laughed as Weasley’s face turned an unflattering shade of red. Draco smirked at the memory of Weasley and Lavender snogging around the castle…Weasley, he recalled, had all but eaten Lavender’s face.
Potter.
“Where do you think we are?” Potter asked him.
“Did they beat you?” Draco asked quietly. “I’d heard that…it was a rumour, going around.”
As they wove through the crowd, Theo asked, “Who do you still need to buy for, then?”
Draco studied the cards. They were indeed very old—several of them were worn at the corners, and one in particular looked as though it had been folded several times. “Which do I pick?”
Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map. After scanning it for a second, he said, “Fifth floor. Come on.”
“A scorpion,” Harry said, sounding rather amused.
Harry scoffed. “It was more than ‘a bit.’ And we talked about it and I thought, well, maybe now that Voldemort’s soul isn’t in me anymore, I’m not so miserable. And I think that might be true. But I’m also so…numb. And to be honest, I make myself that way. Just to keep it all under control, you know, to try not to feel too much.”
“Coming to Hogsmeade tonight, Draco?” Pansy asked him, flipping through the
“You’re okay,” Harry said. “Let’s get you out of here.”
“I’m really glad you could make it, Mr. Dawson,” Harry said.
“I’m one of the few people who’s still bothered to give a damn about you,” Zabini said quietly. “Don’t come crawling back to me when you have no one left at all.” And with that, he swept back to the castle. It was so dark now that Draco could hardly make out his retreating figure. He sat by the lake for at least another hour before heading back to the castle himself.
“You’ve been gone all night!” he pressed. “Who were you with? Go on, tell us.” Nott shot a sly grin at Zabini, who said, “Yes, Draco, tell us, who was the lucky lad this time?”
“Oh, no,” said Granger. “Neville’s doing his eighth year, too, and so are Dean and Seamus.”
Nott shook his head, smiling. “You and Potter, teaching classes together. That’ll go over brilliantly, won’t it?”
“Just going to follow me around, are you?” he teased.
“Stomach problems, too. And wound healing.”
They clinked their bottles together. Harry took a deep swig, melting into the comforting embrace of the firewhisky as it pooled into his chest. He sat back, aware of Seamus’ eyes curiously studying his wrist. Pretending not to notice, he tugged his sleeve down and slipped his arm under the table.
She shrugged. “Neither do I.”
Finally, they stopped in front of the Potions classroom. Pansy tapped the door once, muttered something Draco couldn’t hear, and then pushed her way through. Instantly, a bitter smell hit him. The room was filled with thick, green smoke. Covering his mouth and nose with his cloak, Draco took a cautious step forward. As he looked around, he noticed several upturned cauldrons on the floor.
” Potter spluttered. Draco would have found his reaction rather funny if he weren’t so irritated.
“I asked Slughorn on Friday, and he said it’s all being arranged,” said Pansy. “But Draco…” She leaned forward, lowering her voice. “Why
” she gasped, beating her chest as she coughed. “God, Draco.”
He shook his head. “No. I don’t.” The sombre tilt of his mouth was proof enough that he meant what he said.

As he regained himself, Harry shifted over to take Draco in his arms. “Are you okay? Did it hurt?”
“Not nearly often enough.” He pulled off Draco’s bottoms.
Draco found himself bristling. For some reason, he was offended on Harry’s behalf. “He told the truth. That’s all. If anyone deserves to spend the rest of their life in Azkaban, it’s my father.”
Draco stood abruptly from his chair. He swore he saw Slughorn cringe back, as though afraid of him, and that only fueled his anger. “I understand, Professor.”
Harry grit out another one of those dizzying moans as Draco reached down to grip his cock. It was warm and heavy in his hand. He stroked slowly, watching as Harry’s head fell back.
“I found it when I was reorganizing,” his mother said. “Do you remember that day? You wouldn’t smile. You wanted to be serious, like your father. But I got you to laugh.”
“I know. I’m so sorry.”
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, voicing Draco’s confusion.
“That stupid look on your face really gives you away,” Blaise noted, returning to his box of chocolates. “Maybe you should work on it, if you plan to continue on as though nothing’s happened.”
Harry turned to Vanish the blanket and pillow, a furtive smile on his face. “That’s a funny thing to notice.”
“Just tell him, Draco,” Blaise said. “Tell him the truth.”
“No. Or else how would you remember?”
“I’m not going home,” Draco scoffed. “I’m staying here for Christmas.”
,” Harry insisted, gripping Draco’s arm. “For Dumbledore. And to make sure Voldemort didn’t get suspicious…once Snape killed Dumbledore, he trusted him completely. And that way, Snape could protect Hogwarts, protect the students…”
“We should get going,” he whispered.
“So tell me.”
“Draco, it must be so exciting, having front row seats to their practices,” Lavender said.
“I hope not. It’s important for the other students to see you getting on.”
“Look at Potter go!” someone said behind them. “He can really fly, can’t he?”
Harry gave a deep, weary sigh. “Hermione doesn’t like the idea of me becoming a professional Quidditch player. She thinks it’s impractical. People get injuries, and they retire early…She wants me to get a proper job at the Ministry. And Ron, he’s…”
he protested. And this was true: as Zabini had started to unbutton his shirt, Draco had pushed him away and retreated to his own bed. Things had been tense between them for weeks after.
Nott and Zabini sniggered. “He’s had half the blokes in the castle,” said Nott. “You’ve never fancied a turn, Blaise?”
“I know. I can’t seem to finish it, though.”
“Right.” Draco stepped up to the Pensieve. He felt rather like he was about to be executed.
He snorted. “Anyway, tell me about Millicent.”
Sitting at his desk, rolling the parchment back into a tight scroll, Draco wondered whether his mother had redecorated the sitting room after all. Perhaps, after that, she might move on to the dining room. Draco took up his quill. He should write and let her know that he was fine, that his classes were going well, and that he wouldn’t be visiting Azkaban with her. But he was still angry. So very, very angry. And he couldn’t allow himself to feel all that, because once he began he would never stop. There was so much to be furious about, so much to rage against and to question and to grieve. It was best for everyone, then, that he reinforce his carefully-constructed dam, lest the barrier break open and he be forced to feel the full extent of his revulsion towards his parents. Draco reached for his wand, meaning to light the letter on fire, but he found himself incapable of doing even that. Shame and guilt mixed with anger as he threw the parchment back into the drawer, slamming it shut.
“I meant what I said, earlier. I keep thinking about…last time. And the night of the party.”
“He brought us to Shell Cottage,” Harry continued. His eyes were trained on the table. “That’s where Bill—Bill Weasley, Ron’s older brother—and Fleur live. And I buried him there, in the garden. It’s right by the sea…it’s really nice…but anyway…”
“No!” she said, glaring up at him. “Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of them.” When he gaped at her, she added: “Go on, Draco. Tell them what you said the other day.”
“Anyway, I guess it doesn’t matter. I think it’s advice for the future. You need to be willing to give a bit, and to take a bit. There's someone important coming into your life.”
“Not really, no.”
“Yes, you need to write back,” Pansy said. She reached into her bag and rummaged around. “This has gotten out of hand.”
“Er—I don’t know, really. I just always saw my nan do it.”
“Yeah. Just four more days until the holidays, right? And then you can bring your father the Portkey.”
He would have happily been sucked into the floor if it meant he didn’t have to have this conversation, especially in front of Harry and his friends. “Er. Thanks.”
“For...this? Or to practice?”
Potter frowned. “It’s not getting any brighter.”
“My mother…” He rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling, trying to decide how to respond. “She’s an interesting woman, my mother. She’s never said it, but I’ve always thought she wanted more children. I know she and you had your…differences. A lot of differences.” Harry chuckled next to him. “But she was a very good mother. Especially before everything fell apart like it did. She’d bring me places all the time. We traveled loads. Being an only child, I guess I didn’t really have that many friends growing up. My father’s friends, some of them had children, so we’d play together when we went on holidays or when they visited the Manor. But really…most of the time it was just my mother and me. But it wasn’t lonely. It was quite nice.”
“I know that. But still. It’s nearly gone. I’m worried that I’ve become
, Pansy. Been through awful, terrible things. You think I care that he’s a Gryffindor and I’m a Slytherin?”
“They’re doing it tonight, behind Shacklebolt's back,” said Blaise darkly.
“And?”
“I’m full,” Draco groaned. “And tired.” He thought longingly of Harry’s bed, warm and cozy and calling for him from the seventh floor.
to start with only one finger—Potter’s patience would nearly snap at that point. They hadn’t done this in a few days, and Potter was quite tight around him as Draco gently coaxed him open. When he suddenly keened, arching his back, Draco abruptly added a third finger. He felt Potter melt beneath him.
“Because you refuse to practice until I’ve spent the morning nagging you.”
Draco glanced over at Patil, whose expression had hardened.
you,” Pansy cried. “She’s worried, Draco! Your mother’s not this awful person you make her out to be.”
Several people had turned to look at them. In a low voice, Draco said, “Fine. I’ll go to this bloody party. Happy?”
His mother shrugged. “Things have changed. Your father and I agreed. You need your independence…To start a new life, if you want.” As he opened his mouth to speak, she held up a hand. “
As Draco walked into the Great Hall, he couldn’t stop his eyes from sliding over to the Gryffindor table. Harry sat near the end, between Weasley and Granger. There was something so strange about seeing Harry in the Great Hall, with his friends, casually eating breakfast with no outward sign that he and Draco had kissed last night. It was almost too surreal to imagine. Taken aback, Draco froze in the doorway; he only moved when someone ran into him, squeaking, “Sorry! Sorry!” Embarrassed, he pulled his satchel up higher onto his shoulder and headed towards Pansy and Blaise, who were pouring over the
Draco told himself.
Draco had perhaps never seen Harry’s face so cold. That word rung in his ears.
Draco rubbed a hand over his face. “It’s weird, hearing about something I can’t remember anymore.”
Harry looked very guilty as he whispered, “I’m so sorry. Here, let me heal it.” He began to reach for his wand.
“Right then.” Potter squared his shoulders, paused for a moment, and then cast, “
“It happens with you, too?” she whispered.
“Very well,” said McGonagall in her usual no-nonsense tone. As the applause quieted, she went on, “Some notes before the feast begins. The Forbidden Forest is, as always, out of bounds to all students. And our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that you may find a list of all objects forbidden inside the castle in his office. You may have also noticed that we have some new additions to our faculty this year.” She turned to the High Table and said, “Our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, William Proudfoot.” A tall, dark-skinned man rose from the table to polite applause. Draco knew his name—he was an Auror at the Ministry; Father had spoken of him once or twice. He had black, curly hair and wore thick-framed glasses. He raised his hand briefly to the students, gave a tight smile, and then sat back down as McGonagall continued. “And our new Transfiguration teacher, Fleur Delacour.”
“Draco,” Harry shouted over the wind. “It’s Pansy Parkinson.”
“Your money isn’t good here,” she said. “Get out. And don’t touch anything else.”
“Yeah. Alright. I’ll ask her if she can come next week, give us some pointers. What do you lot think?” He turned to the assembled students; several of them were nodding.
“No, it’s fine,” he growled. “It’s my mother’s stupid owl. It doesn’t like me, because I never return her letters…” Finally, he ripped the parchment from its leg. “Go on, then! Go to the Owlery!”
Draco looked down. The Mark might have been a bit paler than before, but it was hard to tell. “About the same.”
Draco was only half-listening as he read the letter. From the script, he could tell that it was written by his father, which was odd; it was usually his mother who wrote to him.
“What!” Pansy leapt up; the wine sloshed ominously in the bottle. “But you can’t leave! You need to help us finish this!”
“Very well, see yourself out quietly when you need to leave.” She turned back to her plant, dismissing him. Irritated, Draco took a seat between Theo and Pansy. Sprout focused much of their lesson on revisions, bringing them through the care of plants including fluxweed and sneezewort. Draco constantly checked his wristwatch. He was anxious to escape Greenhouse Three: the hot, humid air was more oppressive than ever, and before long he felt rivulets of sweat dripping down his brow. Finally, it was one-thirty, and he decided that was a reasonable enough time to leave. As he packed up his things, Pansy shot him a curious look.
“I certainly am.”
To Draco’s horror, he leaned closer until their noses were nearly touching. He muttered, “As I said before, you were much nicer all those nights you wound up in my bed last year.”
George waved his hand dismissively before pulling Hermione in for a hug. “Forget it, forget it. Alright, Hermione?”
“They’re fine,” Draco called. “Would you get inside? If you die of hypothermia the Order will kill me.”
“Helping Sprout,” she said glumly, deflating somewhat. “I told them I want to work in the dragon reserves, but right now my Herbology grades are too low.”
“Have you finished this essay already?” he asked Potter irritably.
“It costs a fortune,” Lavender said, shaking her head. “The Cannons have ordered seven.”
He stared down at her, scandalized.
“Mmm.” Draco was only a bit disappointed when Harry took his hand away to refill their drinks.
She said nothing as they pushed through the oak door and into the evening air. A group of Hufflepuffs stood huddled by the entrance, playing Gobstones. Pansy dragged him down the path to the lake.
Draco peered inside the empty Great Hall. Soon, it would fill up for dinner. The hall looked magnificent as ever, with snowflakes fluttering down onto the single large table and the usual twelve Christmas trees gleaming in the soft light. He was almost sad to be missing it. “Should we tell someone we’re going?” he asked.
kissed Potter. Sometimes, when Draco was reading, the words blurred together and he wondered what would have happened if he had agreed to go back to Potter’s dorm the night of the party. In Transfiguration yesterday, he had missed most of Delacour’s lecture on trans-species transformation as he gazed at a spot on the wall, lost in thought, remembering the feeling of Potter’s hands on him. It was a dangerous game he was playing. Potter could ruin him—or at least, ruin whatever credibility he had left. And that was another reason to leave Hogwarts: to get away from Potter. Otherwise, he seemed impossible to escape. Draco noticed him wherever he went. It was maddening.
“What good is it going to do, getting rid of it, if you end up dead? Or…or mad, or something?”
The pivotal question: whether or not to inform his parents. Draco didn’t want to add to his father’s worries, and in all likelihood he was just being paranoid. But still…if there was even the slightest chance that Proudfoot was working for the Ministry, or informing the Wizengamot, his father would want to know, wouldn’t he? In the past, his father had rarely appreciated his insights; he generally preferred that Draco do what he was told without meddling. Once again, he found himself desperate for someone he could trust to guide him, someone who had his best interests at heart. There had been Severus, of course, but—no, too painful, still too painful to think about. Looking out at the lake, he wondered, as he so often did, if everyone else had such a complicated relationship with their parents…did other people have to constantly ask themselves whether they should be honest with their parents, and to what extent? Of course, it could be worst...he could have parents who didn’t care at all…or no parents, like Potter…
“And there goes the Snitch…well, they did their best,” Lovegood said. “And now, let’s see…oh, there’s the Quaffle, Natalie McDonald has it…or no, that’s Demelza. They both have brown hair. It would be so much easier if they chose players who didn’t look alike, wouldn’t it?”
“Anyone could have predicted it,” Dean agreed.
“I need you to focus, Draco,” he hissed. “Listen to me: your next Hogsmeade weekend, meet Rochefort in Dervish and Banges. You’ll know him when you see him. Be there Saturday around noon. Bring the package back to Hogwarts, and keep it safe. Do you understand?”
“And no one better than our Hermione to do it,” Harry said fondly. Granger blushed and took a sip of her drink.
“Right. I don’t mean accept what they did—because it’s awful, like you said. But accept that it happened. Accept that those are your parents, and no matter what, you can’t change that. You can’t change
“What does it matter?”
“Ask Granger.”
, for fuck’s sake. You can’t just—you—”
“Well, that’s not very fair!” Daphne cried, indignant.
He donned his dragon-hide gloves and then used his knife to carefully scrape through the dried skin. The tough, scaly hide eventually gave way to the brown flesh beneath. He had worked with Boomslang skin before, but for some reason the sight made him nauseous. Bits of dried flesh clung to the blade, while the larger pieces settled in a clump on his cutting board.
He was silent, running his hands up and down Draco’s arms. He felt oddly self-conscious in front of Potter, who was looking at him like a lion appraising its prey. He hugged his arms around his stomach, to cover himself, but Potter pulled his hands away; Draco swore he heard him whisper “no.”
Draco laughed. “That was the least of my concerns. And I don’t really think I’m Nott’s type, so you have nothing to worry about there.”
Draco was all nerves and tension as he traipsed across the grounds. It was dark; the moon was no more than a soft sliver in the sky. Muscle memory guided him as he wove between the trees, stepping over thick roots and avoiding stray branches. It was time to talk to Harry. The very thought sent a veritable tidal wave of anxiety bursting through him, but he needed to know. He thought he might go mad, analyzing every little thing Harry did in an attempt to understand how he felt. And what if tonight his mind offered up a different memory, and they were able to erase his Mark? What if this was the end of their meetings? He couldn’t bear the thought of parting without at least trying, as best he could, to convey his feelings.
As they settled back in, Lavender tilted her bottle towards Granger and Weasley. “I knew it would happen,” she said, winking at them. “Theo and I, though, we never spoke at school. I think even
“Will
“So why did
“Seeing each other,” she repeated, more slowly this time. “As in…they’re together. They’re dating.”
While the room around him was noisy with the sounds of students conversing, the slow bubble of stewing lacewing flies, and the thwack of knives coming down on wooden cutting boards, Draco could hardly hear anything. It was as though his head was being held underwater. Struggling to take a breath, hands shaking, he stared down at the knife in his hands. He needed to get out. Now. He thought of just running out the door, but he had enough sense about him to know that he would have to explain himself after. His panic mingled with the anxiety of someone looking over and noticing the state he was in. He was terrified of drawing attention to himself. And yet he desperately needed fresh air; he could hardly breathe. Without thinking, he peeled off his gloves, cast them aside, and sliced deep into his index and middle fingers. At once, blood welled up, swelling into a bead and then trickling onto the steel. Rather than the nausea he had expected, he felt the most surreal sense of relief.
“It has to have been at least an hour,” Draco said. Potter’s wand was quite bright, now, casting a white light that illuminated the room. “Try to extinguish your wand nonverbally.”
“It’s because of me,” Harry said carelessly. “But I don’t mind. I’m used to it.”
“Oh.” He could feel himself turning red. “Forget it.”
The concerned look on Harry’s face, coupled with his words, sent Draco’s stomach into performing a complicated gymnastics routine. To cover his embarrassment, he gave out a long-suffering sigh. Harry said nothing. He just sat there, waiting. Finally, Draco grumbled, “If you must.”
Draco felt a strange warmth spreading from the top of his head. It was almost as though someone was gently pouring a cup of water onto him; he shuddered as the warmth trickled down to his shoulders. The base of his skull tingled. It should have been unpleasant, but it wasn’t, not really—on the edges of consciousness, he found himself uncharacteristically unbothered.
he thought to himself, desperate to assuage his guilt.
Draco tensed as Blaise came to sit next to him. They tied their shoes in silence, until Zabini said, “If your father finds out his son’s gay…They still don’t know, do they?”
“A Healer?” At the thought, Draco felt ill.
“Potter,” he grunted, shouldering his satchel.
“That’s just like you, Draco,” Theo barked. “You think you’re so much better than everyone else. I’ve about had it with you this year.”
Draco released a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding when Harry kissed him. Immediately, he responded, turning so that he could grip the front of Harry’s cloak.
Harry led the students in a round of applause, beaming at him. Draco could hear Daphne shouting, “Very well done, Draco!” But he didn’t care, because he had done it. He stood there and watched as the scorpion reacted to the sudden noise, holding its tail erect and hissing. A corporeal Patronus. And he thought it rather pretty, too, gleaming as it scurried about nervously. As Harry’s stag disappeared, so did his scorpion, drifting off into a silvery mist. Draco glanced at Zabini; to his satisfaction, he had a sour look on his face.
“A bit,” Harry whispered. “Hermione, er…gave me a book. And so I learned, er…”
“I don’t want you to see it.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” she said. “I’ve spoken with Professor Proudfoot and he tells me that you’re willing to lead the practice lessons we’re organizing.”
“Hi, you,” he said quietly. Callidus landed gracefully on the wooden bench next to him. As Draco untied the furled parchment in silence, he thought that even Callidus looked morose. “Cheer up. I’ll bring you some treats tomorrow.” Callidus nipped at him affectionately but stayed perched by his side. Giving him one last stroke, Draco took a deep, bracing inhale and then unfolded the parchment.
Potter shifted on the bed. “Maybe. But it doesn’t matter, does it?”
“This morning, before class.” Potter gave a tired sighed. Draco heard him shift. “The problem now is…well, Ginny, you probably know…she was my girlfriend, at one point.”
“If you say so.”
“Ready?” Harry asked, reaching back for his wand.
“Well…” Draco racked his brain, trying desperately to recall a pleasant memory of Dobby. “The summer before our first year, we had family staying with us, from Strasbourg. They were awful. So I used to hide in the kitchen, and Dobby would give me sweets, little pastries, stuff like that. I would watch him cook.”
“No.” Harry frowned. “Because they love me.”
“Yeah?” Draco settled onto the pillow, urging himself to relax. The last time. Those words were not as encouraging as they might have been months ago.
He sat there, flummoxed, feeling the others’ eyes on him. Even Zabini looked up from his work.
“We’d better not use a Snitch,” Harry said. “We’ll never find it.”
Draco rubbed his eyes, suddenly drained. “I’m fine. I knew this was coming. My father heard rumours from the Ministry.”
Draco rolled his eyes and let the spoon fall into the bowl. Daphne and Pansy exchanged a look, but he pretended not to see them. He had never really been queasy before, but nowadays it was as if he was perpetually nauseous. Tonight, the smells of clam chowder and freshly baked bread turned his stomach. He wrinkled his nose at Nott, who was lathering a thick slice of bread with what looked like an entire cup of butter.
“He’s an idiot,” Draco growled.
“Don’t be a prat,” Harry said, reaching down for him. Draco relented, sighing loudly as he took Harry’s hand.
Proudfoot pursed his lips. “That doesn’t concern you.”
“No, no, no,” Pansy said. She stood up and collected her things. “Come
“Why?” Draco asked, scowling.
“Everything’s fine! Everything’s fine!” Slughorn called, coming out from the cupboard. “Just a vial, nothing more…I’ll remind you to put your empty vials at the
“Your father,” he said curtly, “is an old friend of mine. Many years ago, he helped me when I was in a difficult situation. Now I’m repaying the favour.”
“He…he tortured you, didn’t he?”
“Loads of times.” He shrugged. “You need a happy memory, right? And…I guess I don't have anything good enough.”
“Why are you so angry?” Harry asked, stricken. “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“I want to taste you,” Harry said at once, any inhibitions he might have had now long gone. “Please, I want you in my mouth. I need you in my mouth.”
“I didn’t really have another option,” he said, still wondering what the point of this was. “As everyone loves to remind me, my family name means nothing anymore. Worse than nothing.”
“He’s still your father.”
“Of course. Patronuses, then, until the holidays. And we’ll meet again in January to discuss your plans for next term.”
Draco blinked at her. “Alright?”
“Eleven.” He hesitated. “Father…”
“You two act as though I have any insight into the strange mind of Harry Potter,” he sneered.
“No, you won’t,” Harry said at once.
Callidus took off. Checking his wristwatch, Draco saw that it was nearing four. Surely he could make it to Wiltshire in time. The question was whether his parents would understand his hidden message. With a sinking feeling, he realized that they might not even read his letter at all. And then what would he do? Keep writing them? Surely the Ministry would be suspicious. But for now, there was nothing else to be done.
he found the Chocolate Frog card Daphne had given him in Hogsmeade. Draco snorted, turning the card in his hand. That trip to Hogsmeade felt like it had happened a decade ago. He couldn’t help but smile as the miniature Harry Potter depicted on the card looked up at him, brows furrowed.
“Let him be!” Blaise said, shooing her away. “Let him concentrate.”
“I have some letters to send. I was hoping Callidus could do it.”
Draco nearly vibrated with outrage. There were loads of students at Hogwarts whose grades were worse than this—Finnigan’s marks in Transfiguration couldn’t be much better. But he doubted their Heads of House were threatening them with expulsion. “Will that be all, sir?”
But Draco couldn’t smile. It was almost impossible to imagine a world in which Harry Potter had died, in which his face wasn’t plastered over every newspaper and every magazine, in which he wasn’t fooling around with his Gryffindor friends and making a nuisance of himself in class. In which he wasn’t now looking at Draco anxiously, the moonlight reflecting off his glasses.
“I know I shouldn’t complain,” Draco said. “I know that. Because I have parents, and you don’t. So it makes me sound like a spoiled brat to complain.”
Winky squealed with excitement, wrapping the scarf around her neck so tightly that Draco feared she might suffocate.
Draco reached for his wand, knowing he wouldn’t be fast enough, when they suddenly heard a deep voice: “Get out of here.”
“Go see Pomfrey,” Draco advised darkly. “I think you’ve lost the plot.”
“You were great, Draco,” she said. He scoffed.
He had expected Blaise to be impressed, or at least surprised. Instead, he frowned. “What have you gone and done that for?”
“Malfoy. Why didn’t you say it was me? At the Manor?”
Harry protested, but it didn’t seem to matter. Winky and Kreacher led them to the furthest table, ensuring they were comfortable before heading off to rummage through the cupboards.
“We’re going to my parents’ afterwards,” Theo informed them. He brought his arm to rest around Lavender’s chair. “And then Lav’s tomorrow, for Christmas morning.”
“Fine.” Draco shook his head, focusing back on his memories. “I think my mind can put the pieces together, because I can remember everything that followed. I know he asked me to do it. And I know…or maybe I’m just guessing, or it’s logical reasoning, I don’t know…but I know it was at the Manor. And that I was terrified.”
As they picked up into an enthusiastically cheery tune, Draco grimaced. “I don’t like Christmas music.”
“That’s not Pig,” Harry said.
“Try to get some work done while we’re gone! I’ve made you a timetable for revision, just check my desk—and try not to stay up all night—try to get some rest while you can, next term is going to be
Potter’s expression remained unchanged. “I just asked why you did it.”
Harry looked up at him. “What?”
“Yes.”
I bet we could make the front page.”
“It always hurts, Potter.”
“No way. Mum and I had a huge row over the summer about Runes. I can’t go through that again." She took a deep breath. "And, er…how are your parents, then?”
“Where are they going to send you?” Draco persisted. “Abroad?”
“But it’s true. I know it is. The person who told me, they would definitely have the right information. And they have no reason to lie to me.”
They limped down the path in silence, until Harry said, “Of course I like you. I thought you knew.”
“Mr. Malfoy, we don’t have
To Draco’s amazement, it was Weasley who turned around and barked, “Piss off, Seamus.”
“Let’s meet tomorrow, then.”
“I-I’m sorry,” he rasped. He made to reach for his wand, but Harry pulled him somehow closer.
"You haven’t testified for my father,” Draco sniffed. “Because you think he deserves it.”
“I’ll write to you, Theo!” Pansy said, giving him one last hug before scurrying after them. Draco was utterly humiliated as they limped along in silence. He needed to get a hold of himself. Loads of other people had suffered during the war, during the Battle, but they weren’t fainting in front of the Three Broomsticks. His work with Potter had never seemed so important.
As the week went on, Draco received three more letters from Gringotts asking for his authorization to withdraw various large amounts from his account. Each time, he signed the slip of parchment and sent it off with the bank owl before someone could pry. He knew that Pansy in particular was suspicious, but he said nothing to her. She glared at him whenever Potter was around, which seemed to be all the time lately. Wherever Draco went, there he was: watching him as he left the Great Hall; glancing at him in Potions class; hovering around as he studied in the library with the other eighth-year Slytherins. While he had avoided Potter as much as possible during their Thursday study group, practically jogging out of the Great Hall the moment it ended, Draco grew increasingly uncomfortable with his constant presence. And the others had started to notice.
“And where are we headed?” Harry asked breathlessly as they broke apart. “After Hogwarts?”
happened, although he didn’t really understand it. Over the last couple of days, he had started to wonder if he was being too harsh, if Harry’s naïve curiosity was really worth pushing him away. Especially after the last night they had spent together. A lump formed in his throat as he tried not to think about that night. After everything they had shared, it seemed petty to cut Harry out of his life over one mistake. But now that Weasley had no doubt told him what he’d seen…and he knew Harry was a jealous person…he remembered clearly his reaction when Zabini had simply touched his arm, in front of everyone…as sick as he felt, he couldn’t stop the way his stomach clenched when he thought of Harry’s possessive fury, the way he had impressed upon Draco that he was
“It’s a lost cause,” Harry told Blaise. “Believe me.”
Before he could change his mind, Draco signed the letter and called Callidus. Still ruffled, he hopped over and held out his leg, though he wouldn’t look Draco’s way. He was too well-trained to refuse him, but he showed his displeasure with the sharp click he gave before taking off. Well, that was done. Draco suddenly remembered that the Ministry was reading his parents’ mail, and the thought made him smile. Which poor Ministry official would be assigned to read that letter? And what would they make of it? Perhaps they would think it was some strange code. Good, let them stew over it.
“What?” Harry said, surprised. “You can’t be serious.”
“Both. You should know...if you’re going to keep teaching me nonverbal magic, we’re going to end up like this more often than not.”
Draco’s heart clenched painfully at that. “I know,” he muttered. “But you’re Harry Potter. Nobody’s going to bother
“Right, well, er…” Diggle looked around, as though hoping someone would tell him what to do next. “What time is it? Oh, my word, look at the time! Off to dinner with you, off you go…and don’t forget that foot of parchment on counter-spells next week!”
“No Warming Charm?” Proudfoot asked lightly.
“What?” Surely he must have misheard. How hard had he fallen to the floor? Had he knocked his head?
“Draco!” she said, looking up from her textbook. “Is everything alright?”
“Do I what, Potter?” he growled.
“Yeah,” Harry said, a guilty grin on his face. “That was me.”
Potter. It’s a mouse.”
By the time they left the castle for Hogsmeade, Draco was in a foul mood. He had made no progress at all on his essay, and although he had read though the chapter again, he hadn’t retained much at all.
“Mr. Potter and I have hardly been on friendly terms,” his father said. “Perhaps he hopes to trick us into doing something stupid.”
Draco took out his wand and, slowing tracing a pattern, started to suck the fumes out of the air. “Have you got the recipe?”
“You could try.” Granger closed her book and set it aside. “Who knows? It might change. Try thinking of something else, Draco, some other memory. That might bring something new to the forefront.”
“It’s alright,” Harry muttered into his hair. “It’s alright. Just breathe.”
“I’m not being like anything.”
“I’m not trying to make it weird,” Potter said. “I just…yeah. We thought it might help, to come here. Where the part of him in me, where it died.”
Draco refused. He kept his eyes fixed on the scarlet sheets until he felt the mattress shift next to him. When Harry reached out to turn Draco’s face towards his, he flinched.
Draco shrugged. “Dunno.”
“Nobody’s going to see.” Sighing in exasperation, Harry stuffed the jumper into his hands. It was soft, well-worn. “I thought you said blue sets off your eyes.”
Abruptly, Draco stood. In his haste to swing his satchel over his shoulder, he knocked the head of a sixth-year girl seated in front of them. She shouted several rude words at him, but he ignored her as he made to squeeze past Nott.
Harry shrugged, grinning. “Are you having the chicken or the beef?”
“I don’t think I care anymore,” he muttered. “About the Mark. It doesn’t bother me like it used to.”
“We have to do something.”
“That’s fair.” Oblivious to Draco’s dismay, Blaise sat up and stretched. “Well, Pansy’s going to be furious with us. We were supposed to finish that Potions paper.”
“Never mind,” Draco said hastily, but before he could hide his card, Nott had reached out and snatched it.
“It’s not that.” Draco took a deep breath, sitting back in his chair.
Lavender set down her glass of wine. “I’m not going to pretend I know everything that’s happened,” she said quietly. “But you had a shock, last year. We all did. So they can’t act as though everything’s normal.”
“What have you made her cry for?” Theo sat upright in his chair.
go, just for a while. An hour, at most. He would go for an hour, see his father, engage in the usual trite conversation, and then leave. He would refuse to stay a moment longer. And then maybe he would find Harry, and they could work on his Mark together, or maybe they could just talk. And if Harry wasn’t around, there was still Pansy, and Blaise, and they would try to understand, because annoying though they were, they did
“Er. No.” Harry shrugged. “I just use the same one for everything.”
Potter’s eyes were closed. Draco saw him smile faintly. “Haven’t. Just thought a lot about it. All the ways I’ve wanted to touch you.”
All at once, Harry’s wand burst to light. It took a moment for Draco’s eyes to adjust. Blinking at the approaching figures, he took out his wand, gripping it warily. He doubted very much that his father would be brave enough to come to Hogwarts to fetch him—and anyway, how could he leave the Manor?—but perhaps he had sent someone else in his stead. Or maybe it was Proudfoot, come to confront him again...or maybe Nott had contacted the Ministry after all, and those were two Aurors, coming to arrest him...
Potter was staring at him expectantly.
“But Draco,” Pansy started up, “she’s just worried. You haven’t—”
“I've noticed.”
He nodded. “I don’t know why it bothers me so much, erasing the memories. It’s stupid…I’m just laying there, doing nothing…”
, it just went on and on and on, and he didn’t want to watch as his skin stitched back together in the form of the hideous black Mark, but he couldn’t look away…
“Oh, Draco,” she sighed. She had a look on her face he had come to detest over the years, as though she was speaking to someone very stupid or very naïve. “Just watch yourself, alright?”
“It says here that your father had some rather dubious dealings in Bulgaria, Draco,” he drawled. “Something to do with illicit artifacts. Things aren’t looking very good for him, are they? It says he’s lost most of his fortune trying to stay out of Azkaban.”
Uncomfortable, Draco pocketed his wand. “How observant of you.” He leaned back against the wall, folded his arms, and nodded at Potter. “Go on. And relax, damn you—you’re all tensed up again.”
“You’d better find somewhere to sleep,” he warned, looking up at the sky. “It’ll be dark soon, and there’s bound to be owls around, hunting.”
