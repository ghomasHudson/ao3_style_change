"You know," Draco drawled in that tone of voice the always meant a little bit of trouble, "Father is really good with money. You should let him invest for you. He'd make you twice as rich three times as fast."
They only wanted their dad to be happy. Draco made him happy, they could tell. They just didn't understand how come their dad and Draco stopped seeing each other.
"Most of my money is," Draco conceded. "I get a hefty galleon from my shop in Diagon, and other bits and bobs I get up to." Harry didn't bother asking what “bits and bobs” entailed exactly. He figured it was best not to know. "The Malfoy fortune has always been large, but when my father inherited the Lordship from his father it wasn't really all that impressive. The fortune was about a sixth of what it is now."
"Mum!" Hugo bellowed across the table, his flaming red hair bouncing as he jiggled in his seat with excitement. "Can I have a pet snake?"
"Yes," he said feeling no sympathy for the lecture his son was going to get from Hermione. "I was worried out of my mind. How could you just run off in the middle of Diagon Alley like that?"
"You can call me, Draco, now," the man said with an amused smirk. "Wouldn’t want to get confused with my Father."
“No, of course not,” Narcissa agreed, rolling her eyes in commiseration. “They always have to ask us, their wives, first. You know, I’m quite sure Lucius would never be able to get dressed in the morning if I didn’t find all his little missing items for him.”
Letting some the tension drain from him, Draco finally returned his smile. "Well, in that case, then, yes. I do have an interested in dragons. I have always been fascinated with dragons of every kind. As a child it was only natural considering which constellation my mother named me after," he responded in a much friendlier tone.
"Thanks for coming with me," Harry offered him sincerely. "I really appreciate you doing that for me."
Harry watched in mild fascination. Ron had taken to cooking dinner since he mainly worked as a consultant for the Aurors now and often got home before his wife. Consequently, he'd discovered that he was a literal genius in the kitchen. Which was surprising considering just how horrid he'd been at Potions.
” she cut in eagerly. James hissed in the affirmative. She gave a snaky chuckle and curled a little tighter around him. “
"Of course!" Lily sniffed haughtily, for a five year old. "She's very clever. Remember? Draco said so."
Ron just watched him stumble around his explanation and sighed resignedly. "I'm going to have to be nice to him, aren't I?"
They made their way into the Breakfast Room following a helpful house-elf that had been waiting at the parlor’s entrance to guide them. Stepping into the surprisingly comfortable sunny room was surreal.
The secretary in the corner was still watching him like a rabbit watched a fox and the lift doors remained open so that someone could get off.
Shrugging, Harry tried to smooth his hair down again and began leading the way up the stairs toward Lucius's study. "I wouldn't have expected it either. He sort of pushed his way into my house that day he returned Albus and took over everything before I even knew what was happening. The kids love him though, and he's really not like what he used to be. He's matured, you know."
At this, Harry frowned in confusion. "Why is that? I wasn't aware that the Ministry kept tabs on private business arrangements."
"I wouldn't have missed it for the world." She smiled at him before looking around. "It's lovely out here. Did Cissy run herself into the ground doing all of this?"
James hissed something to Nova who had been stationed at the top of the stairs. After receiving an answer he looked back over his shoulder. "They're coming up the stairs to take us back home."
And so he did, give or take a few minor details here and there. After that, though, it went a little unpredictably.
"You are not going to win against Narcissa and Draco together, Potter," Lucius drawled, sensibly tossing his lot in with his wife. Always a wise choice if you want to maintain a happy marriage. "It is better to admit defeat and suffer accordingly." Truer words.
Feeling his heart do a little loop in his chest, Harry squeezed Draco's hand in return before pulling away and whispering, "Goodnight, Draco."
"He's the one that got you looking like something other than the living dead." Ron nodded in realization, then asked, "He's really changed?"
"Alright," he said as he vanished the wax and stamp back to his desk drawer in his study. "Let me call Artemis and we can send this to Headmistress McGonagall."
"How will Miss Lovegood find her way here if no one, but yourself and the Ministry can floo in?" Lucius had inquired disdainfully.
They lurched to a gut wrenching stop in front of a vault numbered 145. Harry had to close his eyes for a moment before the stalactites stopped spinning.
He raised a knowing eyebrow at the elf, but nodded. "Very good. Well, Mr. Potter," he drawled standing from his seat at the head of the table, "shall we send you and the children on your way?"
Hermione made a high pitched sound in the back of her throat before she turned her eyes on Albus asking a silent question.
Tilting to one side thrown off balance with laughter, the words were out of Harry’s mouth before could think about it. "You know, I'm one third owner of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes."
Lily gasped and busied herself with making it look like they'd been playing a wizarding board game instead of plotting their parent's down fall into love. James and Teddy retreated from the door with their snakes and flung themselves into their original spots in the circle.
"Lucius," she’d sobbed, staring at her husband with dead blue eyes. "Lucius, she's not... she didn't..." She choked and gasped through her tears, sounding desolate.
Potter was being surprisingly easy going about letting his children hang around Draco's parents. The wariness on his face when he had first stepped into the room had been obvious, but he’d adapted quickly and Draco was relieved.
The children were giggling and munching on chocolate chip pancakes -Teddy's favorite in honor of his birthday- while the adults smiled at them indulgently and cleaned them up when needed. Lily had begged and pleaded the night before and when backed up by her brothers finally convinced Harry to let them bring their snakes to the Manor to spend the night.
Draco took a step forward and stared at it in puzzlement. They didn't have anything like this at the Manor. All of their bread was toasted on the stove. He was just getting a closer look at the heated coils on either side of the waffles in the slots when they suddenly jumped toward his face with a shocking
“It seems that the children are much more capable of executing machinations than we give them credit for,” Andromeda drawled.
Turning back to the two hopeful looking kids Draco smiled apologetically. "I'm sorry, but no. We do have tons of candy and sweets, though, and a trip to the stables later to ride on the horses."
“Well, you should,” Draco instructed with all the confidence of a man that knew exactly what he was talking about. “You’re his father and he’s turning eleven. A big milestone for wizarding children. He’ll be at Hogwarts in September.”
St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands was beautiful. Snow white sand, crystal clear waters, burning hot sun, and trees so green they’re Technicolor. It was an amazing vacation spot, serene, relaxing, and peaceful. It was embarrassing how long it took Harry to figure it out. After all, Ginny had been begging to get away, just the two of them for the last year. St. Thomas brochures had even been littering their coffee table for months.
"Now, none of us could have ever thought our Ginny would do something like this." Her face was still angry, but her voice held strength that said everything was going to be okay despite the sadness leaking through. Harry just wished he could believe it.
It had been one of the best nights Harry'd had in a long time. He wondered what Draco would have done had Scorpius been the one making an utter mess of himself. Probably encourage him.
Most Pythons, unlike most other snakes species, will actually stay with their egg-clutches after laying them until shortly after they hatch. Female Pythons will curl around the eggs and "shiver" to generate incubation heat. Usually they wont leave their clutches except to bask in the sun or drink water.
"My lord! The Minister is coming?" Narcissa looked positively inconsolable. "We can't have that! I haven't even taken out the Poison Poppies yet! Dipsy! Dipsy!!!" she shouted running around like a peahen with its head cut off.
"I won't leave, Lily," he promised with such conviction it surprised him. "I promise. You and your brothers are the most important things in my life. I wouldn't leave you for the world." It was the God’s honest truth.
"Come back, again," Draco invited stepping back and absently stroking a hand through Scorpius’s messy hair. "We enjoyed your visit."
Harry grunted and nuzzled his nose underneath Draco's ear. He just could not get enough of him. "In the beginning it wasn’t for lack of opportunity," he murmured absently as he flicked his tongue over Draco's earlobe, "but she pointed out that when we have sex she gets pregnant."
Nova and Stella had slithered under his door hours ago and were now curled together on his belly fast asleep. When they'd first come back to him, they'd hissed and sighed and swayed in elegant, harmonizing ways. Teddy just knew they were trying to be comforting and reassuring. He appreciated their sympathy even if he couldn't understand them.
"He's right, Dad," James said earnestly, apparently he’d made himself their unofficial snake spokesperson. "You're just going to have to give into to our irresistible cuteness." On cue all four of his children, Teddy included, turned the worst puppy dog faces on him that he'd ever seen.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were due in a few hours, early for the party, but wanting to offer any help they can. It would only be Molly and Arthur so he figured his mother could find them something to do. Ron and the rest of the Weasleys, children and all, would be coming just as the party was set to start.
“What’s with that face?” he gasped through his rolls of laughter. “You look like I just suggesting sacrificing a bunch of puppies to heathen gods.”
Still giggling from the children’s game, Teddy stood up and hopped toward her before collapsing on a deep blue cushion next to hers.
A small smile flicked at his lips before melting away leaving behind a calmness, if not happiness. Harry thinks of him like a son. Well, that's good because Teddy loves him like a dad, too. That’s a good thing. Maybe he can call him “Dad” now for real.
"I see you have neglected to teach my grandson manners while I was in France," she commented pointedly.
"That is yours, Mr. Potter. The copies are just as binding as the original. Should it become destroyed or lost it will not be an issue." Harry nodded in understanding. "I will keep a copy for my own records and the other will is to be filed with the Ministry."
Cassiopeia sneered at her. "It was my home before it was yours, my dear. Remember that." She turned her eyes back on the room at large and smoothed her twisted expression. "Who are your guests, Lucius?" she demanded.
When Harry's tongue brushed against Draco's lips, he gasped and paused to whisper, "I missed you too, Harry." Then he pressed back in and eagerly seized Harry's mouth once more.
Sighing, he dropped his toothbrush next to the Slytherin green one in the sterling silver cup next to the sink. He knew this was going to be a hell of a lot harder than it sounded.
He guessed he deserved it for missing most of the last couple of years with them. Didn't make it hurt any less, though.
Draco frowned at the kids' odd behavior. "Really? Lily was beating all of you at Magical Trivial Pursuits Genius?"
A young woman came up to them and smiled mildly. Either she didn't recognize him or just chose discretion as the better part of valor.
"He did inherit his fascination with everything murderous and morbid from her, didn't he?" Draco commented wryly as he poured himself another cup of tea and stirred in a spoonful of sugar.
Draco smiled down at him where the boy was walking by his side. "All of the old pure-blood families and most of the older half-blood ones as well have they own libraries." It didn't occur to him that they wouldn't necessarily understand about blood purity, but they didn't ask so he didn't feel the need to elaborate.
Blowing a heavy breath, Harry nodded and ran a hand through his hair. "It's alright, Draco. We'll come visit the Manor again soon. She just took me by surprise."
"The children like waging war on him and I'm inclined to think he likes it too.” Harry bit his lip. “Did you know Teddy was listening?"
"No, not complaining." Draco grinned at him as he watched their kids run around the yard shouting happily and playing with their snakes. "Just pointing it out. You do realize that for former enemies we spend an inordinate amount of time together."
There was a chocked sound at the other end of the table and a muffled laugh, but Lucius ignored it. He also ignored the heated blush starting at the top of his ears, but that's neither here nor there.
"Cassiopeia," Narcissa returned just has frostily. "You seem to make a habit of showing up in my home unannounced," she commented, causing a sharp intake of breath from her husband.
"How lovely!" she exclaimed and turned to look over her shoulder. "Arthur? Arthur! Did you hear that? Draco brought us a host's gift."
"The research we work to fund is geared toward discovering why that is and finding ways to rectify it," she said soberly.
"Thank you, Turnby. That will be all," Lucius dismissed as he flipped through the envelopes reading the addresses absently.
Draco knelt in front of his son buttoning up his nice causal set of dress robes with shaking hands. Butterflies were holding a riot in his belly and his palms were sweating the likes of which he'd not experienced since his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts.
He could have had the children himself. Done things the muggle way, with sperm-donors and turkey basters or some such nonsense, but he couldn't bring himself to do that. He didn't want some nameless man's seed. He wanted a parent for his child.
Harry snorted in agreement and popped a gape in his mouth. "Do I even want to guess at how much money you have?"
Days after the ice cream disaster James still wasn't speaking to him. Harry sighed tiredly and resisted the urge to bang his head against the kitchen table after another awkward silent breakfast.
Nodding in agreement, Draco twined his fingers with Harry's and they walked together out to the garden.
Harry looked off to the side, considering. "He knew that his dad was a werewolf and knew that the Wizarding World still doesn't view them in a favorable light, but everything about his grandparents not approving of his dad and about your family was new."
The older man just looked highly amused by that. "I’ll draw up a contract now, shall I? I assume you wanted all of your investments legal to the nth degree." He sounded as if that was a short coming.
Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. This did not sound like the type of place that Lucius Malfoy would ever be caught dead in.
"What do you suppose this is?" he asked, running his fingers over the smooth twists in the staff, his eyes fastened on the huge blue marque shaped stone caged in fingers of wood at the top
"Of course I do!" he snapped. She was treating him like a child, like he was that angry, reckless teenager again. Harry wasn't going to put up with it. "Draco's done more horrible things to me than he ever did to you, Hermione. I was there, remember? I saved his life in the war. I had visions of Voldemort taunting him and torturing him. You didn’t. You don’t know him, so don’t tell me I’m the one that’s wrong." He hadn’t spoken so angrily to her in years, since the war really. Hermione just stared, shocked at him as if he'd slapped her.
The little boy couldn't have been more than three with bright blue eyes, light golden blond hair, and a face that so resembled his father's that Draco had no problem pinpointing who this little boy belonged to.
Harry grinned back and shrugged. "It wasn't very different from interrogation. That I learned in Auror training."
Narcissa tried the red tea without the sugar and cream and found that it wasn't quite as grotesque as it had been previously. She could live with it for just this once, but she eyed her son with a speculative eye before she shook it off and continued on with their conversation.
"It was my fault really," Draco continued when it seemed that Harry wasn't going to be able to finish his sentence. "I didn't make it absolutely clear what was expected of her as my wife and mother of my child before she signed the marriage contract. Father had negotiated a deal with her family and we assumed it went without saying that I expected a mother for my son not just a brood mare." He snorted self deprecatingly. "My fault."
"What's so funny?" Draco asked as he stepped into the room. The laughter abruptly died and his parents schooled their features into pleasantly bland masks. He looked around the room with suspicion.
"We hadn't spoken in ten years,” he rushed to explain. “Then when Albus ran away that one day after Ginny left, he hid out in Draco's shop in the Alley until Draco was able to bring him home. We got to talking and,” he shrugged helplessly, “after that we just kinda kept seeing each other."
"I want that for my kids,” Harry said. “I want to leave them an empire that they will have to work at to keep running, that they'll be proud of, and feel privileged to have a hand in. You already have that in spades, so I figure you’re the man to help me achieve that as well."
They headed out to the backyard. Soon enough, Marianne was seated comfortably in a lawn chair transfigured into a cushy recliner and Harry's kids swarmed their cousins eagerly, showing Eddy and Chrissy their new snakes. Of course, Harry spent ten minutes reassuring Dudley and his wife that the snakes were not poisonous and that the kids had them under complete control.
The heavy scent of incense hitting his nose and the sound of a bell above the door marked Harry’s entrance. The turban wearing Indian wizard at the counter looked up at him and smiled welcomingly.
Draco turned and frowned in confusion. "Yes. Didn't Harry explain that the Manor was located in Wiltshire? I thought you knew where you would be coming to."
"Yes," Lucius drawled sardonically. "My grandson, bribing house-elves to lie to me. I'm so very proud."
"Mostly shelters for woman -and men- abused by either their families or spouses," Audrey answered with a sobering voice. "There is a rash of abuse in mixed homes and we find that there just isn't enough help going out to those people that need it."
Draco had seen his mother lying exhausted in bed, holding a frighteningly still bundle in her shaking arms, just crying. Her sobbing racked her whole body until she lifted her head and her face had looked nothing like his mother. It had looked old and haunted and twisted with unimaginable grief.
Maybe that was why Harry felt such a strange connection with the Manor. It had been tainted with Darkness, but hadn’t bent to it, hadn’t fallen or succumbed to it. It’d taken its scars and still held onto itself.
Draco was happy to see him so open and playful. Scorpius has always come off as such a reserved, quiet child and it was wonderful to see him lose some of that shyness.
Teddy stopped reading and lifted his head, a bright grin on his lips as he met Harry's proud smiling face. "I'm going to Hogwarts!" he shouted bouncing up and down excitedly.
Draco gave her an understanding smile in return and gingerly released his hold on her once she'd regained her feet. "You must be one of Harry's cousins," he commented politely. "I'm Draco Malfoy, welcome to my home."
If she didn't know any better, she'd think this whole thing was engineered. She felt a small amused smile curl her lips as she caught Scorpius flashing a relieved grateful look at Shotzy.
Lifting his head he felt his heart break a little more at the sight of his daughter's auburn hair falling around her flushed tear stained face.
Draco turned to face Harry with a hand pressed tight to his mouth and pure mirth dancing in his eyes. "Our parents are bonding, love," he giggled.
That made Harry blanch. "God," he croaked and pushed himself off the wall, shaking his head to rid himself of that thought. "Right, let's continue," he suggested, not leaving room for argument.
"Um, yes? Kind of?" Why did he feel like a twelve year-old again with Lucius looking at him like that?
"Scorpius doesn't really remember her." Draco crossed his arms over his chest suddenly uncomfortable with the subject but ignorant to Harry’s anger. The sound of the children's laughter floated up to them on the wind soothing both men’s roiling emotions. "I have complete custody and neither of us has looked back." He shrugged and tucked an errant strand of silver blond hair behind his ear.
He tapped his chin in thought as he leaned closer squinting at the rubbed out carvings something about them nagging at him, but he still did have any clue what they meant. "Pick it up," he instructed dismissively. "See what happens."
Harry paused his mouth open mid scold suddenly reminded that they had an audience. His eyes shifted from his red faced son to his old school rival, bits and pieces of Malfoy’s words filtering in through the haze of shock from seeing the blond man on his front stoop.
"Where are Lucius and Narcissa?" Harry asked as he sipped his cool minty alcoholic beverage and leaned back on his hands. The kids were once again tormenting the ducks and geese down by the pond. He and Draco were leisurely sitting out of the way on the grass in the shade of an ancient tree watching the action.
"Tipsy requested half the choco-balls as compensation for the extra workload," Draco told him with a fierce grin on his lips.
"Is that so?" Draco smirked wryly then stroked a finger over Belle's head. "She must be really clever."
Taking a deep fortifying breath, Lucius decided to take one for the team and wade into the utter madness that was his wife's idea of party preparation.
Harry was very displeased. Granted he didn't trust Lucius's completely aboveboard policy when it came to his own money, but it was illegal and an insult to Harry's judgment seeing as he was the one that got the bastard pardoned, to demand copies of any kind of his financial information. Not to mention an invasion of privacy of everybody that does business with Lucius on top of it.
Narcissa quirked an eyebrow amused at him as she snapped for a house-elf to bring tea. "Sometime in the coming months. You'll have to ask your father, dear. I never could stomach to correspond with her like he can."
"Did you and Andromeda say anything you didn't want him to know, or hadn't already told him?" Draco asked curiously and somewhat worried. He didn't care that everyone knew about his family's past political allegiances, but he was worried that if Harry's kids didn't already know they would react badly to the discovery.
"Daddy said he was sorry that we got his hair, but I don't mind. He said it's the color of my grandma-Lily's hair, so I like it."
Harry stood with his two youngest children staring at their empty entryway. He felt as if he'd just been rolled over by a freight train again.
"It's too luxurious for you, Harry," Draco scoffed teasingly. "You wouldn't be able to appreciate the sheer amount of comfort it affords."
"Quit moving around so much, Potter. I'm trying to sleep," Draco murmured against his shoulder. Harry could feel the vibrations where Draco's chest was pressed against his and his skin broke out in goosebumps.
Lucius just rolled his eyes, ignoring the confused and wary looks from Molly and Arthur. "Narcissa, either the children risk getting sliced to bits and poisoned or they risk scraping their knees on the gravel if they fall. You can't have neither, so pick one."
Harry watched as the women at the table traded pointed looks and small approving smiles while they continued to watch Draco lavish Bill's son with attention. He seemed to have won everyone over. That is, except for Hermione. Harry nearly had to stop himself from sighing.
He cringed and hunched his shoulders, focusing a bit more attention on snapping the beans than necessary. "’M sorry, Molly. I didn't really want anyone to know. When everyone found out about me, it was like I was going to be the next Lord Voldemort at the age of twelve. I didn't want that for them."
"Good grief!" Lucius sighed in exasperation and pointed his wand in the house-elf's general direction levitating the bleeding creature to the patio so that its comrades could patch him up. "This is beyond ridiculous. What is that woman thinking? None of those plants will come out of the ground until they're damn good and ready."
Marianne looked a little taken aback by having to actually speak to one of the creatures, but was soon asking a few questions about their magic and how they lived. The answers she received seemed to satisfy her.
Harry’s lips quirked up in amusement. Despite the upheaval in his life he couldn’t deny that the situation was bizarrely serendipitous. "So your son, Scorpius, has adopted my Albus."
"Okay." He took a deep breath. "Alright, well, what a lot of people don't know is that Voldemort used the Manor as a kind of headquarters during the Second War. He kept prisoners in our dungeons and let his Death Eaters stay in our house."
The boy shook his head and collapsed back against his dad. "No, it just scared me is all. I thought it was going to bite me."
A snort of made him turn around to see his father watching the chaos out in the gardens with amusement. "Your mother is going to kill the poor house-elves at this rate. When is the boy's birthday? Surely it can't be this afternoon."
"I see." Lucius leaned back in his chair again, but kept his hands resting on the armrests, his eyes never leaving Harry. The intensity of his gaze made him feel twitchy. Harry checked his Occlumency shields just to make sure they were still in place.
They both nodded to him as they stepped up to the door. Harry pulled out the key and slid it into the lock. He tried to turn it, but found it stiff and jerky as the mechanisms grinded like rusty bolts. Finally, he had it turned all the way and a reverberating clang signaled the end of the revolution. Harry waited for the kinds of sound that had followed at the Potter vault, but he heard nothing.
"You mentioned wards around in the gardens," Molly continued, interrupting the silent pissing contest the two men seemed to be having off to the side. "Why would that be necessary?"
A snort escaped before Draco could stop it. "No wonder you two had an argument. You know how much Father hates that magazine."
Harry hummed distractedly as he continued to peruse the letter. "Teddy and Scorpius are trying to learn Parseltongue. It helps to have the snakes to focus on." He mumbled something to himself and tapped his chin in thought.
Finally, they made it into the bank without any trouble both relaxing fractionally as they entered the doors.
“Of course.” Harry nodded, then, about to add something more, to offer another apology, he was stopped by a small voice coming from the doorway leading into the rest of the house.
Her laughter coming to a natural end, Narcissa reached out and grasped Lucius’s hand to get his attention. “What was it you wanted, dear? You were growling about something when you came in here.”
"Mother, how many times do I have to tell you? Harry said he just wants the family and a few friends. The Weasleys, Longbottom, Hagrid, McGonagall, Minister Shacklebolt and his wife, and a few others." Draco sighed and scrubbed at his face tiredly.
Everyone broke into excited smiles and darted off toward the garden tables to get ready for the story.
Harry looked around at the scene dazed. The last time he had seen all three of the Malfoys in the same room had been at their trial. Before that in their drawing room while Bellatrix tortured them in the middle of the war. Now, his kids followed Draco around like ducklings and Lucius and Narcissi were amused watching them get covered in syrup.
"Draco." He turned to see his mother looking haunted and worried, her hand grasping tightly to his father's.
Lucius just stared at her incomprehensibly for a moment before he fell back on his aristocratic manners and nodded politely. "Thank you, Miss Lovegood. I'm- glad that you find it to your liking."
By all rights they should be sworn enemies and yet they are the complete opposite of what Draco and Harry were when they were kids. Their sons had become best friends in the blink of an eye where Harry and Draco had become dangerously bitter rivals after one conversation.
"This floo is broken. Fix it," Lucius snapped at the quivering creature. He may have mellowed in his old age, but he could still instill fear in every house-elf they owned.
A mirthless, hoarse laugh was forced from Harry's lungs before he could stop it. "God. You heard about that?"
"What?" Harry stuttered feeling a sudden flip in his belly, his cheeks heating up of their own accord.
"It's a muggle thing, a hollow paper figure they stuff with candy then beat with a stick until it breaks and the candy goes everywhere," Ron explained with a bashful hand rubbing at the back of his neck.
"I know," Draco said soothingly as he stroked the back of her hand with his thumb. "I think it will help if you talk about it with him, though. It will help both of you."
and Luna had the money she and her father needed to do the research and reporting on another conspiracy within the Ministry. It had turned out to be a pretty good day so far. If only it would stay that way.
“Yes,” Andromeda nodded, continuing on. “I- was horrid,” she admitted looking back down at her hands. “I shouldn’t have let my old angers and insecurities take control, but I did. I said some awful things that neither you nor your family deserved. I’m sorry for that.”
Harry suppressed his blush and looked back down at the contract. Scanning it one last time he handed it back with a nod. "Yes. I think you covered all of our bases." He received a blank look at that and he fought an amused grin. "You've covered everything," he clarified.
Harry chuckled at the look on his face and climbed into bed too. "Well, I wish my bathroom looked like that."
“Yes,” she agreed slowly. “I didn’t know him well apart from school, but Draco told me he was one of the only competent Defense professors he’d had. Harry still speaks very highly of him as well.”
“Oh!” Narcissa jumped in surprised, pressing a hand to her chest as she looked down at the nervous house-elf standing next to the table. She’d been so
"So those are the muggles you didn't tell me were going to be in my home," Lucius drawled, suddenly appearing next to him.
Lucius felt an irrational surge of anger inside him. The Potter children weren't his blood by any stretch of the imagination, but he'd grown rather horridly fond of them since they began to invade the Manor. It made him burn to think of their own mother abandoning them like that. Like Astoria abandoned Scorpius, he thought old remorse adding to the seething inside him. If he weren't under such scrutiny, watched for that single toe out of line, he’d be tempted to risk Azkaban to hunt the Weasley girl down himself and give her a piece of his unforgiving mind.
Finally, they reached the wall filled with books and Harry just stared at it totally baffled with the idea of even choosing where to start. "What do you suppose is in them?" he asked lamely.
"Harry?" Luna's whimsical voice called from the kitchen. "Harry? Did the Nargles make you deaf again?"
It wasn't hard to do. The kids loved him and their cousins were quickly learning to like him as well.
"Well," Harry shrugged. "I did, but before that I was having a rather interesting conversation with that python about how he wanted to travel to Brazil and visit his homeland."
It was as they were standing by the floo and Harry had just ushered Teddy and James through that Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder to get his attention.
"Oh dear!" she exclaimed as Draco helped her right herself. "Thank you. I'm not usually this clumsy even with this big belly, but those fireplaces really make me dizzy," she said with a pleasant smile on her pretty face.
Albus, seeing his friend's unhappy expression, came up and sat next to him again. "It’s okay, Scorpius. You can play with my snake and I'll teach you Parseltongue so you can get one of your own."
The young shop clerk blinked in surprise then took a second look at them all. Her eyes landed on Harry and she peered closer and her eyes widen before she composed herself.
Teddy was busy trying to make nice between his three pets while the other children talked and chatted with their snakes and each other, translating when need be. Really it was the strangest breakfast he'd had in a long time. Not that he minded much.
Ice cream paid for and handed out, the Potter family commandeered one of the tables on the outside patio to sit and devour their snack. Harry enjoyed himself immensely listening to his kids chatter, bickering with each other over childish things and making outlandish battle plans for the next offensive against the garden gnome in the backyard.
Sighing, Harry rubbed at his eyes tiredly and fell back on his butt on the kitchen floor. He heard a miserable sniffle from the general direction of his daughter and could have kicked himself.
"Don't worry about it, mate." Ron chuckled and nudged Harry playfully in shoulder. "As long as you vouch for him and he stays on his best behavior everything should be fine. I think you'll have to wait awhile for Lucius and Narcissa though," he added with a wry smirk.
"Alright, Harry," she was the one to break the silence. Her voice sounded strangled and she seemed a little shaky as she stood from her chair. "I'll just collect Teddy and we'll go."
"Oi!" Ron scolded, slapping his hand away from the food. "No picking, you! She's finishing up at the office. Babbled something about Lethefolds encroaching on Centaurian territory before cutting the connection, so that's all I got on her. Should be home in a bit, though."
"Well, it's all aboveboard now. Back before the Dark Lord returned he would dabble in some not so savory deals here and there, but now for reputation sake everything he does is legal." He glanced down at his hands still fiddling with his straw. "It wouldn't take much to get him thrown in Azkaban again, so he's trying to keep it clean as humanly possible."
Things didn't seem like to get any better in the near future. Despite all the help, wanted and unwanted, he had pouring in from all sides it was an uphill battle.
"It frightens you," she murmured understandingly. Like all mothers she could hear what her son wasn’t actually saying aloud. He was very nearly in love and it scared him silly.
Harry stepped out of the fireplace into his kitchen at Grimmauld Place with Lily on his hip, James and Albus already waiting for him. He looked around at the kitchen and tried not to wrinkle his nose at the smell coming from the food caked dishes stacked in the sink. There was a thin layer of dust covering every surface. It was times like this when he dearly wished he still had a house-elf.
The tilt of his head, the way he absently tucked a lock of silver blond hair behind his ear, the amused glint in his intelligent gray eyes. It was all really distracting. Considering he couldn’t for the life of him keep his gaze from sliding back to Draco it seemed like he didn’t actually mind the distraction all that much.
Before they stepped into the floo, Molly and Arthur bid them both good night with hugs and handshakes.
Ginny hadn't been heard from for two weeks. None of the Weasleys knew where she could have gone. After questioning the children it was discovered that not only was this not a surprise, but Ginny had been increasingly distant and withdrawn while Harry was away on assignments. They had told their grandparents that Ginny was always sad, would stay in her room for hours, and often didn’t cook or clean when Harry wasn't around. She only tried to seem like her old self when Harry was home.
Soon, they were growing weary and if they wanted to make it the Black Heirloom vault that day they were going to have to stop.
"If they fall in love then Scorpius can be our brother too and Draco can be our Mummy, or our second Daddy, and then we can have more brothers and sisters and we could all be a family!" She smiled brightly and hoping that the boys wanted this as much as she did.
"Yeah," Harry breathed in no small parts amazement and large parts absolute certainty. "Yeah, I love you. More than I would have thought possible." He pulled back and looked into Draco’s eyes. "More than I could have imagined."
The kids all giggled louder, their mouths mostly full with syrupy pancakes, while Ron and Hermione stared at him gobsmacked and Harry and Draco failed to completely control their amusement.
Draco watched her rush off, completely bemused in the wake of her panic. He didn't even think any of their house-elves spoke French.
They made it all the way to the Magical Menagerie without a single person wishing to give their condolences about his marriage severing or wanting to shake his hand. So far, it was a pretty good shopping day.
James watched them with growing frustration. "What we really need is to talk to Scorpius. He knows more about his dad than we do. If we could just ask him, we'd know when Draco works in his shop and we could get Dad to take us to Diagon Alley to see him."
If anyone had told him ten years ago that he'd be sitting in Malfoy Manor having tea and scones while listening to Lucius and Draco Malfoy tease each other, Harry would have gone ahead and put them out of their misery.
Snorting, Harry muttered, "Right, nothing catastrophic if you're anyone, but me." Still, he ignored the warnings in the back of his mind and curled his hand around the surprisingly warm wood of the staff, lifting it off the ground.
Marianne looked about ready to faint for a second, before she shook herself and peered closely at him. "How old are you?" she asked suspiciously as if her eyes were lying to her.
Ron sighed and rubbed tiredly at his eyes. "I don't know, mate. She's been like that for weeks. Snapping unexpectedly, getting angry over almost nothing, overreacting to things. It’s been nearly constant. I'm about ready to tear my hair out.” He snorted mirthlessly and shook his head. "She even yelled at Crookshanks the other day."
They sat in silence for a few more moments until the children started to clamor wanting to go out and play in the gardens.
Lucius shot Harry a scolding look, like Luna’s eccentricities were entirely his fault, before he followed her out of the sitting room and toward the floo. Harry just sighed, already dreading their lunch and shuffled off behind them.
Draco just chuckled at him. "If you have any ideas on how to do that without getting sliced to bits, be my guest."
"You're staying, aren't you?" he asked softly so his voice wouldn't carry to the sleeping children in their beds.
"Oh." He blushed and glanced down at the snake draped in his lap. It was watching him expectantly. He turned his eyes back to the other kids and rubbed at the back of his neck nervously. "Um... He can. He can have babies."
"Missy Hermione is being in the library, Mistress," Frilly said with a solemn look on her elfin face.
Hermione didn't say a word, but a flash of frustration skittered through the anger in her glare. With a stiff nod she just turned and walked away soon joining into a conversation with Audrey who was helping her daughter, Lucy, try a bite of caviar.
"However," Lucius continued moving his eyes to the side to give the children a reprieve from his stare, "your research is incomplete, as you know, and I do not take kindly to the idea that you thought you would be allowed to snoop around in my study." He frowned with disappointment at his grandson.
Pulling back, Draco stared at her stunned before stuttering a choked thank you of his own. Molly just smiled sweetly at him and patted his cheek before moving away letting Arthur take her place.
Among the wary passengers there was a frightened secretary that had pressed herself into the farthest corner away from him and proceeded to flinch every time even one of his fingers twitched. Lucius couldn't decide whether to be amused or insulted. Of course the tubby balding bureaucrat on the other side of the car was openly staring at him like he was some sort of exotic fish in an aquarium.
Teddy remained quiet for a time, just looking into her yellow eyes and petting her silky soft feathers. "Ruby," he murmured after a long moment. "Her name's Ruby."
Potter groaned miserably and tilted his head back to stare at his kitchen ceiling blankly. "I hate the fucking
She stopped and stared at him for a moment before another smile broke over her face and she grabbed him up in a hug once again. "You are just the sweetest thing, but please, dear, just call me Grandma-Molly."
The children’s roots in Gryffindor troublemaking and Slytherin cunning start to show themselves. Of course it’s at their fathers’ expense… or benefit. That is yet to be determined.
Looking out across the beach, Ginny was easy to spot. Her fiery red hair was a blinding beacon against the white sand. Harry slowly trudged through the sand toward her, his Auror robes and long sleeves were hot under the sun, his hair was already sticking to his head in sweat.
"Sure." Draco slowly pulled away, missing the feeling of closeness already. It wasn’t important at the moment, but he promised himself he'd take a closer look into his suspicions later. Right then they were about to walk into a room full of five sugar crazed children. He was going to need all of his concentration for the situation.
Draco fiddled with his glass sullenly. "Well, now that you mention it, I do remember hearing something like that at the end of that year."
Draco sighed and turned toward an uncomfortably flushed Ron. He tilted his head apologetically. "I'm sorry, Ron. I shouldn't have done that."
Harry watched the whole thing in amazement. Lucius Malfoy has lived in this Manor his entire life, generations of Malfoys have lived in it before him and he didn't know he had a doorbell? Well, he conceded, that could be a bit understandable.
The other boy groaned and let his head fall to his hands dramatically. "What's the difference between the big ‘S's and the little ‘s's again?"
Albus sobbed in pain and fear. He realized that he didn't have any idea where he was and he looked around frantically for somewhere to hide. To his right he saw a bright storefront with trinkets and shiny things in the window. He darted for it and pushed the door open hurriedly shutting it behind him hard as the bell above it jingled shrilly.
Blinking back tears, Andromeda held him just as tightly for a long moment. Pulling back she cradled her hands against his pale cheeks and told him, "I love you too, Teddy." Then she stepped away and took a pinch of floo powder from the jar sitting on the mantle. Slipping into the fireplace she spared a look at Harry and a reassuring smile for Teddy. "Be good for Harry, and I'll see you soon."
They settled back together in each others arms and just laid quietly for a time staring into their dimly lit room, different things on their minds.
"This is my wand. It helps me focus my magic and give it direction. Now, what I want to see is if you all can make a bit of magic with it. Alright?"
"I must admit, Minister, that I'm at a loss as to why you would request a meeting. Your letter did not exactly specify," Lucius began, feeling that he'd rather get to the point than trade false pleasantries for the next fifteen minutes.
"Oh tosh." Sipping more of his drink, Draco sounded just a little too nonchalant for the subject matter. "Father has declared himself too old for a young man’s foolish hobbies like genocidal blood prejudice and violent revolution."
Some men would have been positively traumatized by this conversation, but Draco found that he wasn't. Maybe it was because he was a matris and had, consequently, done mountains of research himself into pregnancy, fertility, and the like.
Kingsly shook his head dismissively and stood up to shake his hand. "That's alright, Harry. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. But if you want you can make it up to me by having dinner with my wife and I sometime in the near future. Bring the kids. You know how Margret adores them."
Harry grinned at him then tilted his head back and relaxed. It was late afternoon and soon the sun would start to set. Already a specter of the moon was low in the sky. The breeze was pleasant and the temperature comfortable.  It had been a nice day.
The children had been taking care of themselves off and on for months while Ginny had been nearly catatonic. James had fed his siblings with omelets and cold sandwiches when they weren’t at the Burrow. They’d lie about having their mother’s permission to floo to Molly and Arthur’s. Albus and Lily traded off chores and did their best to keep the house livable until either Harry returned or Ginny could force herself to be functional.
"Mother and Father decided to take the day off." Draco grinned at him then sipped his drink through a bright pink twisty straw with an audible slurp.
He glanced out to the field with Molly and grinned when he saw Scorpius watching Dominique in fascination as she instructed him and Louis on making a grass whistle with their hands. Harry was glad that Draco had agreed to let Scorpius join them for their weekly outing to the Burrow.
"Oh, I can from the sounds of it." Harry chuckled and stroked his hands up and down Draco's back. "Has Narcissa been running herself ragged getting ready for this?" he asked, a touch of concern wrinkling at his brow.
"The very same." Narcissa nodded calmly. "Harry's godfather was the Black heir and when he died, Harry inherited him." She smiled rather viciously at Cassiopeia. "I believe that Draco mentioned something about it this morning."
Draco shook his head and smiled absently as he sipped his tea and watched little flashes of bright pink, blond, black, and red hair pop in and out of the garden foliage.
Draco popped another oyster cracker in his mouth to abate his sudden hunger and watched the organized chaos happening around him. His mother really knew how to put the house-elves through their paces. She had every elf that wasn't laid up with injuries scurrying around the gardens levitating tables, laying out cushions, pruning bushes, and doing any number of things he would never have thought needed doing for the party that afternoon.
Draco and Scorpius nearly split themselves open laughing at the unlikely parade that tumbled into their receiving room. Their guests nearly knocked each other to the floor when the traveling pairs didn’t jump out of the grate fast enough.
Harry sat in his study on the ground floor of Grimmauld staring out the window and watching the muggles passing by unawares. He hadn't taken the kids to the Manor since they'd been forced by suspicious circumstance to spend the night, and he hadn't issued an invitation for Draco and Scorpius to come to Grimmauld.
"Hello, dear." She smiled kindly. "Tell me, Teddy. Do you know where you got your Metamorphmagus ability?"
"Yeah!" Scorpius cut in hoping to dispel the odd vibes coming off of the adults. "He was brilliant. Just started having a conversation with it."
Hermione didn't protest, but stalled before following Narcissa from the room. Looking back at Draco, she met his gaze, considering. "There is-... I'm not sure that I trust you or your feelings for Harry, yet," she said quietly. "There is too much history, too many bitter memories between you and us for me to just blindly accept this. But," she paused, thinking through her words before continuing. "But you
Draco snorted in amusement earning himself some disapproving looks from the women at the table. "Perhaps you should wait to write it until after breakfast. Neither of you have finished your pancakes and Claude made them especially for you, Teddy," he said in a teasing admonishment.
Tipsy shifted from one foot to the other, shooting a wary glance at Narcissa and Lucius who were looking on with practiced expressions of aloof curiosity.
Seeing that her adopted son had once again fallen into his brooding pose even as he expertly peeled potatoes for her, Molly decided to move on. "Have you decided what you're going to give Teddy for his gift yet?"
Draco sighed and leaned over to kiss her on the forehead and tuck some flyaway hair behind her ear. "Nothing really. Just thought of something ridiculous."
Yes, Lucius decided staring into the dark and trying not to think about what his son and Potter might be doing right then. Life was going to become a lot more interesting.
Harry sputtered in indignation, or sheer incomprehension, he couldn't decide. "Malfoy, what are you-?"
Sighing, Harry tightened his hold on Draco tilting his face just enough to smell the clear herbal scent of his soft blond hair. "Yeah, I wouldn't mind waking up like this again either."
Draco watched the ensuing chaos and sat quietly trying not to attract attention to himself. He felt like a rabbit in a den full of foxes. Unfortunately, his little pocket of peace didn't last for very long and he jumped when a pile of mashed potatoes was dropped onto his plate.
Lucius was much too pleased with the stunned silence that had descended upon them. Still smirking, he tilted his head inquiringly. "Tell me, Peters, how is your wife these days? Still hasn't left you for her greener pastures, I see." Over the sound of Peters’ sputtering, the lift dinged announcing the Minister's offices.
"Aw, Lily, love. I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to yell," he murmured wretchedly. She just sobbed and nodded her head keeping her face turned down. "I'm sorry," he repeated standing up. He held his arms out to her. "Come on, Lily. Please, stop crying."
Harry sighed and rubbed at the back of his neck. "Yeah, sometimes they're alright with visiting, but if I even suggest that I leave them there alone for a bit they get all dodgy and protesting. Teddy being with them has made it better, but it's still not good."
"Alright, guys. Why don't you go upstairs and get washed up while I..." He glanced around the kitchen again and sighed tiredly. "While I work on getting us some dinner."
Lucius was busy staring as his wife intently. He knew that look in her eyes. She only ever got that look in her eyes when she was plotting against someone. He had a healthy dose of wariness of that look on his wife’s face. Life was about to become a lot more interesting, he just hoped it wasn’t at his expense.
Harry glanced over his shoulder and gave them a stiff smile. "Hey, come on in guys. I ordered Chinese from Wan Fu's so it should be popping through the floo in a bit. Why don't you pull out some plates and silverware and set the table?"
Draco sighed and pulled his face from Harry’s shoulder eyeing him wryly. "I guess we should be glad it wasn't my parents catching us snogging. Now, that would have been truly embarrassing."
A frown stole over Harry's face. "It's- It's kind of intense, Molly," he said. "We haven't even really done anything more than flirt and cuddle a little and it already feels..." he trailed off trying to find the right words. “We haven't been friendly with each other for all that long, but already it feels more comfortable and more... right. It feels like it could be everything.”
Draco shot him a wry smirk. "That's what I thought. Harry's and his cousin's mothers were sisters, it could very well be recessive considering the wife has no magical history in her family."
"Dad, this is Albus," Scorpius introduced with a smile. "He just came into the shop and he skinned his hands."
"Oh yeah." Teddy nodded eagerly. His hair brightened to an outrageous pink and his eyes darkened to a warm amber. "My grandma told me my mum was a Metamorphmagus. She loved to keep her hair pink like this. Grandma said it used to drive her nuts."
"Hm." She seemed to look down her nose at him, like Lucius had the first few time's they'd met and clashed. "Well, Lucius, a Potter, a Weasley, a mudblood, and a whole gaggle of uncouth little children and their pets. Have the Malfoy standards truly sunk so low?" She spoke casually, but with a malicious curve of her lips.
Lifting Belle up as her dad came to a panting stop in front of her, Lily grinned innocently up at him. "Look, Daddy! I found her."
Harry met Draco’s eyes over the celebrating kids and they shared a smile filled with warmth and other things Harry wasn’t sure he understood.
"I remember when my Bill started his first year at Hogwarts." Molly smiled absently as she looked off into the field watching her grandchildren and one extra Malfoy blond head running and playing. "He had his heart set on this one broom. Good lord, it was so long ago I can't even remember what it was called, but he was so excited when he opened it up, I could have cried."
"I'll tell your father after he's finished with the gardens," she acknowledged a little distractedly as she sipped at her muggle raspberry blinger -or something or other- tea.
"Well, look at what the cat dragged in." Draco smirked from his place leaning against the counter, sharp gray eyes riveted on Harry's handsome face. It felt almost like a lifetime since he'd seen those green eyes and he hadn't liked the separation one bit.
Harry just shrugged. "I didn't know that's what it was until the Second War. Then I found out that Voldemort was searching for the Elder Wand and Dumbledore gave me the Resurrection Stone and well." He shrugged again, the journal still clasped in one hand. "Voldemort was stupid enough to not want all three." A cheeky grin flashed over his face.
Peters just went on grinning. "Getting back into politics, then, are you?" he commented boldly, earning himself a panicked look from the man directly behind him. "That can't be easy to do after the war and all that business with You-Know-Who, can it? Must be hard in society for you former Death Eaters now," he remarked almost resembling sympathetically.
Ginny had dropped their children off at the Burrow three weeks ago while Harry had been on assignment with the British Ambassador for Wizardry at a summit in Egypt. She promised to pick them up in a couple of days, but she never came back. Two weeks later Harry portkeyed back to the Ministry then flooed home in exhaustion hoping to finally spend some time with his family. He'd found the house empty with no sign of anyone being there for sometime.
"Now." Narcissa turned her attention on the very tentatively amused children. "You know, it's very impolite to eavesdrop, children, but for curiosity sake, what did you overhear?"
The boys looked like they were going to protest, but then Rose, in true Hermione fashion, grabbed Albus's arm and began dragging him toward the door, her little brother's arm in the other hand. Of course there was nothing else for it, Rose was her mother's daughter and if someone didn’t listen to her, she made them.
Narcissa made a strange sound in the back of her throat. "Nymphadora Tonks," she breathed seeming not to have heard him past the first word.
Draco had never before nearly vomited from smelling roasting bird before, but he nodded anyway. "Perhaps." He would think on it later. "Is the cake finished?"
He had thought his son was the most perfect child known to man, but it seemed that Harry's children, Teddy included, were right up there with him. They were all so charming and bright in their own individual ways. Each was already showing signs of great magical strength, which wasn't surprising considering who their father is.
Lucius gave a rather tense humorless smirk. "Under normal circumstances they don’t and they won't be 'keeping tabs' on any further progress of our business together. The Ministry does, however, demand copies of legally binding contracts and business agreements made by formerly convicted criminals, fully pardoned or not."
"Good morning." Draco chuckled as he and Scorpius came forward to greet them. "Well, Potter, at least I can say you never cease to amuse me."
"No," he answered slowly. "I'm not insane, Hermione. I wouldn't be wasting my time with him if I didn't believe that he'd changed, or grown up, or whatever."
He peeked over the top of his newspaper to make sure no one was paying attention to him as he turned a page in the magazine. He would never live it down if Potter found out he'd bought a subscription after their meeting with Miss Lovegood.
"Oh, it is our pleasure, Harry." Margaret Shacklebolt grinned at him, her dark skin shining beautifully in the fairy lights. "I just can't believe that Teddy is eleven already."
Draco and Harry greeted each other each day with increasingly familiar kisses and parted with the same, but didn't go much farther beyond that. They resolved to continue moving slowly, but neither of them really minded.
"That's quite alright, dear," Molly assured him with a smile. "It's always very stressful putting on such a large gathering like this."
They landed smoothly in a large hearth and Draco gave his son's hand one last squeeze before they stepped out into a homey kitchen filled with redheads and a hodgepodge of cookware.
Draco flicked a glance at him from the corner of his eye. "I bet they took that really well," he commented sarcastically.
Harry looked like he was thinking seriously through something. Hesitantly, he began to speak. "You know, if we stay together, if this works out, Teddy, and James, and Albus, and Lily will kind of be your kids, too. Like Scorpius will kind of be mine."
They sat in silence for a few more moments watching their children stalk the one lone garden gnome through the tall grass near the fountain in the far corner of the yard.
A shrill ringing echoed through the house and Harry nearly jumped out of his skin in surprise. The telephone was ringing he realized.
Looking at all the children he told them, "You're not in the least bit scary. Parselmouth used to be a very rare gift, a sign of a very powerful witch or wizard. The first notable Parselmouth was Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts."
Lucius didn't seem to mind his rudeness, simply chuckling darkly as he followed the younger man through the seemingly endless rows and piles of old magical things.
"She didn't want to be around Scorpius at all?" It wasn’t really a question and it wasn’t tactful. Draco didn't seem to mind.
The shop attendant led them toward the back of the store where they found a huge tank literally teeming with snakes. They slithered over each other, sunbathed lazily on the rocks underneath the miniature magical sun, and hung sleepily from the spindly tree branches stretching out across their environment.
Both adults spun around to see Teddy standing just inside the kitchen with Nova and Stella wrapped comfortingly around his neck, his face pale and sad. His hair was an ashy gray and his eyes were a dull, flat brown.  Both Harry and Andromeda’s hearts ached at the sight.
"You're eleven now! I can't believe it. Happy Birthday! You don't look a day less than sixty-five," he teased making the little boy blush and his hair go bright neon green.
Lifting his head he caught everyone's attention just by sheer force of will and the table fell silent. Narcissa frowned in worry and placed a hand on his arm once more. "Lucius?"
It was Molly's habitual day to watch all of her grandchildren and give their parents a break. Harry had made a point of joining her on these days seeing as his kids still felt uneasy about him spending long periods of time away from them and especially leaving them at the Burrow.
“Of course, many more also hate me because I was a Death Eater and, at one point, one of Voldemort's best." He looked at Teddy then. "I'm sure your grandmother hates me for all of these things."
The elf whimpered and began slamming his head into the stone repeatedly before pulling himself up and heading toward the foul tempered fowl.
"Well, it is quite lovely," Molly repeated, gaining more confidence in the conversation. It was very odd to be having such a civil conversation with Narcissa Malfoy after years of feuding and disdain, but not particularly hard.
Harry’s swallow of tea went down square, but he had to grin at her directness. It was kind of refreshing. "Blunt as always, Andromeda."
"Actually," Harry hedged, "I would rather the meeting be with Luna herself. She handles most of the actual business for the
"Well, I'm about to tell you," he teased continuing on with his story. "We were supposed to 'disarm only', so of course we threw every spell we could at each other, as did everyone else, as well.
She stiffened. "I do not think Andromeda would want to hear anything from me. We shall leave things as they are, alright, Draco? It is enough that I know she is well."
, by definition, and Draco had been surprised to discover that he was one. Malfoy Matris were never only children. That was just how the trait always manifested in the Malfoy family.
Harry frowned, trying to put it in words, all the things he’d been feeling. "This feels somehow stronger, deeper. Just more," he explained haltingly. "What we have feels really comfortable and so..."
Draco gave her a wan smile and gently released her hand. "The party was already over," he replied. "And it's better to do this at an inopportune time than to let it fester."
"Not really," James replied truthfully, shrugging. "They've always been nice to us, and Dad wouldn't let us near them if they were dangerous."
Harry and James entered the stables to see Draco and another wizard apparently in charge of the stables telling the other children about the creatures in their care. The manager had pulled out a mild mannered mare letting Albus and Lily tentatively pet her while Scorpius was off on another story about something or other pertaining to that particular horse.
"Great. Thank you so much." Harry smiled at him again and pulled his money pouch from his robe pocket. He counted out his galleons and paid the shop owner before saying his goodbyes and stepping out the door. The heavy scent of incense still clung to Harry was walked down the street.
"Traitor," Draco grumbled before he snatched a plate from the stack on the counter and dropped the hot waffles onto it before placing it in front of a flushed and happy Lily.
"Meaning," like the smug git he is, Draco looked at Harry with slyly glinting eyes, "he's decided it's much more politically beneficial, not to mention lucrative, to be seen as having 'renounced his old ways'. He’s even begun investing in a number of promising businesses that had once been 'unacceptable'. With the added benefit of promoting his newly reformed image, of course."
had come to an agreement, Draco could still feel the weight of sorrow on his shoulders. He prayed with all his might that he never had to go through what Hermione and his mother had. He prayed all the way back down to the garden.
She nodded and turned to smile brightly at the pregnant muggle. "I am being Frilly, Miss. What can I do for you?"
In a way, the building reflected its occupants. The Manor had never quit, never been beaten into submission, just like the Malfoys. They’d made bad decisions, been punished for them, suffered for them, and still they had survived and were better for it.
"Mm." Draco smiled and leaned forward to place a tired satisfied kiss on Harry's lips. "I love you," he whispered against his mouth, gray eyes regarding him nervously.
Lucius chuckled lowly to himself and rolled onto his back as he pulled his wife to him, stroking up her delicately curved back. "Cissa, my sweet, one of these days I'm not going to be able to keep up with you anymore."
A shuddering breath escaped him and he didn't waste any time. He scooted up behind her and wrapped his arm around her waist, comfortingly covering her clinched hands pressed to her chest with one of his own. He buried his face in her hair and just pressed her close against his chest.
If Harry had grown up in a loving family, would he have been more willing to give Draco a second chance after he'd acted like such a spoiled brat? If he hadn’t been an arrogant prat would Draco have approached him out of friendship instead of superiority?
“I don’t understand, Ginny,” he said, because he truly didn’t. Leaving him he could understand. He hadn’t been much of a husband for years now, but leaving their kids…
Harry laughed mirthlessly and ran a shaking hand through his hair. "I know, Ron. I'm sorry," he repeated anyway. "I haven't loved her, like I should have for years maybe." He leaned forward and propped his elbows up in his knees looking a little hysterical. "We hadn't had actual sex since Lily was born, for fuck's sake! I just- I just-"
is a pretty good paper." He cringed then conceeded, "Once you get past the Snorkacks and Wrackspurts.
James smiled at him the turned back to running his eyes over all the snakes trying to find the perfect one.
Draco finds out that meeting the family is a lot more nerve wracking when you actually care about making a good impression.
Cassiopeia sipped at her tea seeming completely unaffected by the past few moments of conversation. It was easy to see who Lucius got his intimidation techniques from.
Harry and George followed the house-elf out to the gardens where they were supposed to find the kids and Draco.
Chuckling, Draco shrugged. “When I was eleven I loved it. Got to show off my new gifts and mingle with society's elite.”
Shaking her head, Narcissa primped herself one last time before stepping through the doorway and, for the first time in years, was face to face with her eldest sister.
"Well," Hermione said once the children were all playing outside and the adults were seated at the kitchen table with Raspberry Zinger tea in their cups. "That woman was one of the foulest creatures I have ever encountered."
Lucius scowled around the table at all the smiling faces only making them laugh harder. Finally he just gave up and pushed his paper away to start on his breakfast. A familiar hand on his arm had him look up to see his softly smiling wife.
"I know because I've been through this four times," Narcissa answered her, voice distant and toneless.
Leaning down he grinning cheekily at a smiling Lily. "Well, Lily dear. It is a pleasure to see you again. You are looking extra lovely this morning."
Draco's eyes popped open, wide and blown with lust. "Wait," he gasp reaching over to the nightstand where they'd both tossed their wands. He scrabbled for his a moment before he finally snatched it up pointing the tip at his belly just below his navel and murmured, "
Harry gave a surprised little chuckle, then he took a deep breath and scrubbed his hands over his face. “I’m sorry. I’m just… It’s just that Teddy’s turning eleven later this month and I don’t know what to do.”
Exposing muggle-borns to wizarding society before they’re thrust into the deep end would certainly make the transition from muggle to wizard be a lot smoother for everyone involved.
"Luna Lovegood would be that loony girl with the long blond hair, then?" he asked in affected neutrality. He did remember that girl. Brave, but frighteningly spacey, he recalled. Not a bad witch. Of course, she'd also spent quite a bit of time in his dungeon.
They were both shaken and kissed and hugged like long lost relatives, all the while Harry and his children watched with wide smiles. The only hitch was when Bill stepped forward with Fleur.
Fighting down the uncomfortableness of being under such scrutiny, Draco nodded. "Yes, I make some jewelry as well. Mostly simple pieces with some charms or other little spells on them. Protections and luck and things,” explained.
"Let's see those hands, now," he coaxed and examined them gently when the little boy presented his hands palms up. He hissed in sympathy. "These look like they hurt. How did you skin them?"
Draco fought down the small feelings of hurt he'd been nursing since he realized that Harry was avoiding him. "Hello Harry," he replied just as softly letting his eyes do most of the speaking for him.
Looking up at him she nodded morosely and got up taking James' hand. "Goodnight, Dad," she called quietly before they disappeared out of the kitchen.
"So, you wouldn't mind if one of your kids was in Slytherin?" he clarified, distracted and languid the longer those fingers worked on him.
Albus had heard his friend's scream and came out of the bushes at the same instant Draco appeared further down the path, just in time to see the snake make a warning strike toward Scorpius.
"You don't have to leave, Malfoy," Harry said surprising himself as much as Draco. In all the years they’ve known each other they'd never had a kind word to say and all in one day, one disastrous ulcer inducing day, they have tea, a civil conversation, and their children bond.
Hugo stopped his futile eating attempts and scowled at his sterling silver forked pancake like it had personally insulted him. The child was nearly a spitting image of his father, in looks and in nature. It made Draco want laugh all the way out of his chair.
"Ah. Now that is a more difficult question." Lucius gave him a small smile. "Narcissa and I have realized sometime ago that family is more important than blood purity. She wants to get to know her grand-nephew, and perhaps, in time, make amends with her sister."
Rolling his eyes, Draco moved his hand from Harry’s shoulder into his hair, tugging at it lightly. “Alright. So, what’s the real problem, then? Because it’s obviously not something normal people that aren’t Harry Potter would understand without having to ask.”
, when Dorian stabbed his friend, Basil, to death and left him locked in the room with the Portrait.
Draco smiled understandingly at him, but had to stomp down on the surge of disappointment. "Come along, then. I'll help you collect the little heathens."
She teetered off, suddenly feeling the temperature drop and the air thicken. It was easy to forget that they had been on opposite sides of a war. It was easy to forget that Andromeda had lost so much and Narcissa relatively little. It was so, so easy to forget that she had ceased to have one sister for over twenty years.
"They have not discussed as much that I know of," she replied diplomatically. Her own suspicions aside, she would be very surprised if either young man had even thought about bonding.
After he let the kids wander off to get acquainted with their snakes, Harry set up their habitat in an empty bedroom on the third floor, the floor below the kids’ rooms. The large tank gained a few twisted tree branch perches, a couple large boulders for some lazy sunning, a floating miniature sun that put off heat almost like a real one. He put the spelled rats in a locked cabinet in case any of the snakes got out and decided they wanted a midnight snack.
"Whoa," he breathed, giving Lucius an impressed look that was met with another roll of his sharp gray eyes.
A warm hand slipped into his and he turned to find Albus had snuck up next to him without him noticing. A small smile touched his lips and Scorpius gave his friend’s hand a thankful squeeze. Albus grinned at him happily and bumped their shoulders together in reassurance.
Harry sighed reluctantly and pulled back to meet Draco’s gaze. "Speaking of ice cream and cookies, we'd better check on the kids and make sure they haven't destroyed anything."
Frowning, Harry nodded. He had to think about that. Getting it all done in one day would be enormously ideal, but leaving the kids at the Burrow, even with Teddy, wouldn't really be an option for a day that long winded. He could leave the kids at the Manor with the Malfoys, but who would he take to the vault?
Flicking guarded gray eyes toward him, he shrugged. "My dad actually told me what it was like, during the war. What Voldemort made him do." Pausing Scorpius began to fidget with his fingers until Albus reached over and grabbed one of his hands and squeezed it reassuringly.
"I guess I need to get the kids back and put them to bed," Harry finally said reluctant to end his visit. "It's past their bedtime as it is."
"So, you get a third of the profits,then," Draco surmised with a lingering of amusement in the upward curve of his lips steering them back to their lighter conversation.
Lucius listened to, what he was sure, was a much less insulting version of the a supposed fight that Potter had with his wife's disowned sister. Then, with much interest, he listened to the boy explain how they went searching for information on his own involvement, and that of his son's, in the war attempting to find a link between their past and Andromeda’s animosity.
George was discussing the current value of the galleon with William who, Draco discovered, worked as a curse breaker for Gringotts. Audrey, Percy's wife, was chatting amiably with Angelina about their children and Charles was telling his father about the new dragons they'd just gotten in the preserve in Romania.
Narcissa just rolled her eyes. "You know Draco hasn't been really happy for a long while, Lucius. I'd be overjoyed if a hippogriff made our son smile and laugh the way Harry does."
"Since its founding," Harry answered. "I gave Fred and George Weasley the money to start the business and in return they made me a third owner." Lucius's clinched jaw looked painful.
Teddy looked at him from his place next to James and immediately morphed into silver blond hair and cool gray eyes. "I'm Teddy Lupin." He thrust out his hand eagerly.
Soon they were back in the cart flying upward on shaky tracks, then they were stepping out of the bank into the evening sun.
Harry grinned down at him still curled up against his chest. "I'd only ever heard that all the dark wizards came out of Slytherin and then I met you and you were the snottiest kid I'd ever met. You reminded me of my cousin Dudley, actually," he muttered absently then continued, "I saw you get Sorted into Slytherin and I just didn't want to be there."
It didn't escape anyone at the table, except for Draco and Harry, that he'd said "our boys". Ron and Hermione traded a look before glancing back at the rest of the group. "Are you having any success?" she asked Scorpius, her analytical tone of voice very familiar to her two best friends.
Teddy glanced around him with a serious expression on his young face. He looked at Harry who was smiling proudly at him and at Draco who was holding Harry's hand and watching him with a pleased grin on his face. He looked at James and Albus and Scorpius and Lily remembering their scheming and their adventures and their hopes for the future of their family.
"Good." Scorpius grinned at Albus then glanced at the door where James and Teddy were keeping a lookout. "How are we doing?" he called to them.
"I have to tell you something." Draco lifted his head and looked Harry in his beautiful curious green eyes. "I can have more kids," he told him, then realized that didn’t really explain anything.
Harry was dwelling on the thought of having to go through his heirloom vaults with his once sworn enemy at his side. While Draco was worrying over the apparently upcoming dinner at the Weasleys'.
Narcissa sensed something off about her tone, but answered her anyway. “Yes. Scorpius loves them. He was so excited when he met Albus Severus and was absolutely intolerable after he’d gotten to know James Sirius and Lily Luna,” she said, amusement coloring her words. “Of course, we have grown quite fond of them as well. Lucius, especially, lets all five of them practically get away with murder.”
"That's great!" Teddy smiled brightly, relieved. "So, my grandma was upset because she thought you and Miss Cissy would be mean to me?"
Draco nodded, a worried frown creasing at his brow. "I think the stress is getting to her." He munched on a cracker gaining a raised eyebrow from his father. "Maybe you should take her upstairs to get dressed. Let the house-elves finish their jobs. I can handle everything from here."
He scoffed at himself. His kids already had snakes, before too long he’d be running his own zoo if he let it get out of hand.
Harry shifted uneasily and frowned defensively. He felt like a five year old under Lucius's unwavering stare. "I did say that."
With a sigh, Draco turned his attention back on the garden and watched their children chase each other in some game that only children were allowed play.
Shrugging, George leaned back in his chair and continued rattling WWW products off from the top of his head. "Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, Headless Hats, Pygmy Puffs, Daydream Charms," George wiggled his eyebrows at a still impassable Lucius, "Shield Hats, Cloaks, and Gloves. All sorts really."
All the children looked equally frightened of the prospect and Lucius thought it rather amusing that Potter's children didn't seem to realize that he had no real authority over them. He didn’t see the need to disabuse them of that just quite yet.
The little boy was just short of a year younger than James and stepped forward with more confidence than his little sister had before him. "I want green sparks," he announced decisively.
Draco took a sip of his lemonade before answering. "Just this and that really," he hedged nervously. "I brew some custom healing potions from my own recipes and sell a few packaged baked goods that I make as well."
Later, Draco wouldn't have been able to recall how exactly they got up a flight of stairs and their clothing completely discarded, but he knew it had taken way too long anyway. Finally, they fell together on Harry's large soft bed, bare flesh pressing to bare flesh and lips and tongues kissing and licking every spare inch of skin they could reach.
"Sure." Harry grinned at him and stroked a finger down the bird's ruby feathered head. "She'll get to make her maiden flight all the way to Scotland and back."
Draco, shrewd man that he was, just grinned at him and nodded. "Yes, they were curious about the story after this afternoon."
When he got close enough to the floo room to hear the children's excited chattering he sped up his pace. Opening the door he smiled brightly as the children screamed their greetings at him.
There was some banging, a loud rattle, an ear splitting squeal of surprise, and a small avalanche of soot before the house-elf reappeared. His once pristine pillowcase was smudged with dirt and his floppy ears were dusted with soot.
"I figured Potter could use a little help after that," Draco replied to the original question nonchalantly ignoring his father's disparaging comments. "I understand some of what he's going through," he finished softly.
“Indeed,” Lucius agreed dryly. “As it is, our Scorpius and the Potter brood have been sickeningly successful with Draco and Potter. I can’t decide whether to be wary or proud.”
Albus glanced around and saw that the shelves were filled with all sorts of different things. Potion bottles, colorful candles, tins of candies and cookies, charmed jewelry, and other odds and ends he didn't recognize.
Harry huffed out a tired breath and rubbed at his aching neck. "How do you think we can take all of these back out with us?"
A house-elf was called and lemonade was ordered, Narcissa and Andromeda were seated next to each other, and then there was nothing more to distract from the years of silence between them.
Harry would be popping out to pick up his cousins from Grimmauld and floo them to the Manor and the Minister and the other guests would be filtering in after that. Draco smiled to himself even as Fritz tripped over his own feet and sent a wrought-iron table crashing to the stone paved patio.
Harry and Draco are moving along swimmingly, and the kids are basking in their accomplishment. But an unexpected visitor will throw a shadow over their happiness.
They stepped into the library to find it dark and unlit. It didn't particularly surprise them, but they lit their wands instead of the lamps and ventured into the cavernous room. The sound of quiet sobbing lead them to her.
"Nope." Harry shook his head. "While my godfather was on the run, I would get letters from him carried by toucans and pelicans and every other exotic bird you could think of. Once, he even sent an albatross."
Slowly and more or less silently, they moved until Scorpius held up a hand signaling them to stop. He looked up the hall and down the hall before pointing at the door they'd stop by. "This is it."
He made a big production of planting his feet shoulder width apart and holding his wand in a firm grip. "Now, most magic is done by saying a spell," he told them. "Saying the words
"Yes." Draco nodded not understanding her surprise. "Malfoy Manor was built by my ancestors when they come to Great Britain from France in the 1300's. Grimmauld Place, I believe, was relocated to Grimmauld Square when the area was developed a few hundred years ago, but the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black itself has been standing since sometime in the 1450's."
"I think we should get Draco and Daddy to fall in love," Lily announced suddenly. The boys all looked at her incredulously, but she continued undaunted.
"Really? So, you had him before you married Ginny?" Marianne continued trying not to seem nosy but still really curious.
Almost faster than Harry could watch, a stream of fire burned all the way around the room completely contained in its stone gutter and lighting every object inside perfectly.
Narcissa spotted him as he drew nearer and practically threw herself at him. "Lucius! Thank goodness! None of those awful plants will cooperate. I've lost four elves from work to debilitating injuries already this morning. We can't let all those children run around in the gardens with those vile things still out there. It's alright with Scorpius, and Teddy, and James, and Albus, and Lily, but we just can't watch all of the others at once! I won’t have any of those little babies injured while in our home! I couldn't live with myself!" She burst into stressed tears and wrinkled his lounging coat with her clutching fingers.
All the boys paused and stared at one another with wide eyes. "Uh... Lily," Teddy supplied when no one seemed able to think of anything to say. They hadn't even looked at what game they were supposed to be playing.
Nova and Stella were Teddy's brother and sister dwarf snakes. They reminded Harry of a couple reptilian beach bums. He was informed that their Chameleon was a very righteous little dude and that they were very psyched about his "skin shedding" ability. Harry couldn't help, but think they fit Teddy perfectly.
Giving up on getting more sleep, Draco cracked his eyes open and lifted his head enough to meet Harry's gaze. "Nope, you're the first. Then again I haven't shared with anyone recently except Scorpius and with him I'm usually beaten to the very edge of the bed by razor sharp little knees and elbows."
Deciding a change of subject was probably in order, Draco patted Ron on the shoulder. "It'll be alright, Ronald. Why don't you ask Dipsy over there for a drink and grab yourself a handful of those chocolates from that bowl. You'll feel better."
Lily stared at her wide eyed. She'd never heard Belle sound so angry. It made the fact that her mum was gone even more real. Laying her head back down on Draco's shoulder she sighed, partly in sadness and partly in pleasure when he lifted a hand and began combing his fingers through her hair gently.
Then Harry noticed the little blond boy standing on the other side of Malfoy staring at him with something akin to awe.
Pulling away, Draco looked up to find Harry eying him with a happy smile on his lips. "Do you want one too?" Draco asked him teasingly.
They sat in companionable silence for a time until Harry decided to bring up the possibility of dinner at the Burrow.
Lucius scoffed. "I highly doubt the Weasleys would be impressed by any finery or offering we could bestow upon them."
Draco looked from his mother to Harry's godson his stomach knotting apprehensively. He scowled at her. "Mother, if you have a problem with Teddy being here then I suggest you-"
"Yes, Miss Lily?" she returned pleasantly setting her tea down to give all her attention on the little girl standing next to her.
The little boy clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter before he slid from his chair and padded over to the head of the table. He expertly lifted Tal from Lucius's lap and hissed something to the snake.
"In that case, Mr. Potter, I will be glad to accompany you," Lucius said with a formal nod of the head.
Lucius just stared at him scarcely believing that the man was really that tactless. Of course it also sparked his memory of who the man actually was. Peters was a Ministry liaison for foreign dignitaries. He was also inordinately stupid.
"Mr. Potter," Lucius began after a long moment of silence. "Why is it that you would choose me to approach with such an offer?" he asked sounding genuinely curious, or as genuine as Lucius Malfoy could ever be.
Draco felt a pang, echoes of memory begging his parents for brothers and sisters reminded him of his bitter disappointment at Astoria's apathy toward their son.
Lucius had the good grace to blink somewhat owlishly, or as owlishly as he could get, before coming back to himself. "Why in heaven's name would you want to invest your perfectly good gold in that imbecilic and asinine rag?" he sneered.
Narcissa leaned forward giving him a kiss on the cheek then bent down to give Scorpius one as well. "Yes, tomorrow, dear." She smiled then threw in a handful of floo powder in the grate and shouted out "Number 12,Grimmauld Place!" before Draco could protest.
The bushy headed woman shot a glare at her husband then turned it up a notch and moved it to Draco. "You're serving alcohol with children around?" she questioned indignant while she looked scandalized at the sight of the house-elves in their uniforms carrying trays.
Waking up with Draco in his arms had felt scarily good. Continuing to cuddle with him while they flirted with each other had been, in hindsight, positively frightening. He hadn't felt that contented since the early years with Ginny when everything was still new and wonderful and nothing hurt. He hadn't felt that happy in a long time.
Dudley sat staring at him with wide eyes seeming to try and decide on the proper response when hearing about something like that. "Wow, Harry. I'm sorry."
Stiffening in outrage, Harry glared at him heatedly. "Luna Lovegood is a very good friend of mine. She was with me at the Ministry, in the Final Battle, and she believed me when no one else did," he reminded Lucius none too gently. "She and her father may have some far out ideas, but they still print the truth when it's called for. Or did you forget that they were the only paper to print the truth during the war as well?"
Hermione's breath hitched painfully and she pulled away to look at Narcissa through teary eyes. "Four times?" she repeated, horrified.
"The wife is pregnant with their third child, but other than that I don't think there is anything we should watch out for," he replied. "You might want to have Father ward some of the more unorthodox magical items we have in the house, however. The muggles wouldn't know not to touch something that might be cursed or charmed."
” she hissed quietly to the snake when a panicked Harry popped out next to her dodging around a fat apple shaped wizard.
Sucking in a surprised breath, the Lady of the House pressed a steadying hand to her chest again and tried to shoo away the nervous flutters that had appeared in her stomach. Standing up she quickly patted at her hair and smoothed her dress.
"Tipsy is sorry, Master, but I was not knowing that we was to be having guests. The floors are being waxed and there is no more available rooms."
Neither he nor Harry saw the covert silent high-fives the children exchanged or the handful of Chocoballs Scorpius discretely passed Shotzy on his way out of the room.
"Dueling Club second year wasn't actually the first time I'd ever talked to a snake," Harry said grinning at the assembly in front of him. Seeing the complete lack of negative reaction on the Malfoys and the eager smiles of his kids made him feel a whole lot better about their secret being revealed.
"Eat, dear," Molly urge from where she was brandishing the serving spoon in her hand like a weapon. "You're much too thin."
Narcissa reached over and placed her hand over one of Andromeda’s giving it a reassuring squeeze. “That’s alright, Andromeda. I’m sorry, too. It took a great deal more than it should have to teach me that family is always the most important thing. When I finally realized that what we did to you was awful, I-…,” she trailed off with a sad grimace. “Well, I had already lost poor Bellatrix and I had completely burned my bridges with you.” She paused to swallow back the lump in her throat. “I was without either of my beloved sisters and my loneliness was of my own doing.”
He squeezed her hand comfortingly. “I don’t know, my love. Perhaps he wants to warn me away from fleecing Potter blind or some such nonsense.” He lips thinned in irritation at the very notion. He may be Dark, and corrupt, and generally hated and mistrusted, but he was a damn good businessman.
Harry laughed again tilting his head back down he ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. "Yeah, you could say they're not taking it well. They're not taking me well, either."
Ron snorted tea up his nose and went into a coughing fit. Hermione just rolled her eyes at him and pounded him on the back.
“You’re anxious about Teddy leaving for school, as well, aren’t you?” Draco’s voice abruptly pulled him from his thoughts.
Draco nodded and walked into the kitchen, coming to a stop directly in front of Harry. "That was-... a very intense argument," he commented cautiously. "Was it what you expected from her?"
"I'll never get used to that," Dudley muttered rubbing at the back of his neck as Harry just grinned at him and picked up the stick of dark green wax.
"You sure did," he assured her as he shot Dudley a meaningful look. Dudley just stared at his daughter with something akin to awe on his face nodding to Harry in understanding.
Teddy laid awake in bed that night, his bedroom window open to let in the late spring breeze. He stared out at the dark night sky and looking at the bright full moon.
"I didn't even think about the gardens," Harry murmured worriedly. "How are we going to keep the little ones from hurting themselves?"
Albus on the other hand was hot and cold. One moment he would seem almost forgiving, then something would happen or Harry would say something and he'd fly off the handle and stomp away angrily.
Lily grinned at him and began hissing to her companion again as she leaned against Draco's chest comfortably.
"Enough stalling, Harry. Tell me how you all have been now that Ginevra is no longer in your lives," she ordered sternly.
Despite these sad recollections, Draco had the ability to give Scorpius more siblings. He'd just chosen not to. He asked himself if it was selfish that he'd held back because he was wary, scared of romance now, but he couldn't come up with a definitive answer.
He was about to step in as the food started flying through the air when a turbaned man at the door to the Manor caught his eye. Harry turned and grinned as he saw Mowgli smiling in the children's direction and carrying a large covered cage.
Turning his earnest green eyes on him, Harry nodded. "After the floo broke I was pretty out of it. I was helping her look after the grandchildren one day and she dragged it out of me."
Harry thought about that for a while. He liked the idea of getting Teddy an owl. Hagrid had bought him Hedwig and she’d been one of his best friends. But he couldn’t just get Teddy any old owl. He’d have to pick out the absolute perfect one.
"I think so." Lucius nodded then the two of them began strolling their way toward the other end of the Alley, attracting no less attention than they had when they traveled in to begin with.
They spent an hour more in the stables petting spoiled horses and indulging the children's curiosity then they moved out to a pond the size of a lake. Narcissa called a house-elf to supply them with old bread and the kids started trying to peg the ducks with bits of crust completely ignoring the bread’s intended purpose.
"I will if you want me to," Draco responded just as quietly, his heart suddenly thundering in his chest.
Tal, Albus's snake, was somewhat of an aspiring intellectual. He was quiet, polite, and had a sharp mind to go with his calm disposition. Harry thought he fit Albus pretty well. Tal was still young and had some growing to do before his personality was complete. Much like Albus.
He glanced over to see James staring at him with a reluctantly curious look on his face. "Yes, James. We have a large stable on the property where we house our horses." The boy's face suddenly lit up with interest, and Draco knew he had him.
"You know what, don't tell me." Harry chuckled feeling more amused at that information than he thought he should. "I don't want to know what constitutes 'retirement' for Lucius Malfoy."
His bedroom door creaked open and Teddy looked over his shoulder to see James in his snitch pajamas standing nervously in the doorway.
Watching the exchange, Harry had to suppress a shiver. He could have been watching Lucius Malfoy, Draco exuded so much cold aloofness and superiority. He couldn't even be mad at Malfoy for disciplining James himself. Harry had been trying for days to get James to drop the attitude. Draco had accomplished it in a matter of minutes.
Lucius made a pained sound in the back of his throat and fell to lean heavily against the bookshelf, Esther Potter's journal still clasped loosely in his hands. "You had two of the three Deathly Hallows?"
"Ron," Hermione sobbed into the darkness, wishing, hoping, praying for him to know what she was asking.
A funny kind of twist curled at her lips. "No, no. I'll meet you at Malfoy Manor and we can all floo over together."
Draco pushed himself up and captured Harry's lips in a bruising kiss. "I love your kids, too. I can't imagine our lives without them anymore." He pressed kiss after kiss to Harry's smiling lips. "This is completely insane, Potter. We tried to fucking kill each other and now we're talking about having kids together. The world's gone insane."
"Fix us some tea then return to your regular duties," he ordered then turned to find Potter had planted his forehead on the table and was rocking it back and forth miserably as his arms hung loosely at his sides.
The other curled her body tightly around Teddy's wrist and flicked her tongue out tasting his skin. “
She laughed at him, but continued on, not wishing to make him uncomfortable. "We find that the muggles have a much more in-depth understanding of the human body than we do. They have not had quick-fix healing magic, so they’ve done scads of research into the way the body works. We lobby to integrate their knowledge with our own. Not just for the benefit of women, but hopefully men and everyone else as well."
That was the third time he'd caught himself staring at Draco. He couldn't seem to make himself stop.
It was all homey and comfortable and Draco found himself invested, fascinated by the their opinions on various things and what they had to say. He could hear the childish giggles and exclamations from the children's table and smiled. This was nice, he decided, he was glad he'd come.
He sighed heavily and leaned back in his seat, his fingers twirling his teacup idly. "He got upset with me at Fortescue's," Harry admitted. "Shouted at me in front of half the Alley then bolted. You know a boy his size just disappears in a crowd of people."
Draco let out a humorless laugh that hurt to hear. "Trust me on this, Granger. I have not come to gloat." He stepped forward and seated himself comfortably on the floor next to her. Surprisingly his mother did the same on Hermione’s other side, folding her legs in her pencil skirt dress and heels daintily to one side.
"Don't apologize, Harry. The more the merrier." Waving it off, Draco looked back to the little boy still eerily wearing Malfoy features. He grinned wryly. "Welcome to my home, Teddy. You may call me, Draco. This is my son, Scorpius." He placed a hand on top of his son's head.
Harry considered that for a moment before making up his mind. "Could you check them for Dark curses and stuff? I would like to take all of them, but not if they'll suck out my soul or drink my blood. And I want to take this tapestry with me and study it a bit." He fingered a diamond and smiled absently at it.
Lucius stared blankly at the thought, then chuckled wryly. "Yes, it would, by marriage. All pureblood families are related in some way."
Coming up to the secretary’s desk, the bored woman glanced up from filing her nails and promptly did double take when she recognized Lucius.
How long had it been since he'd really had a meal with his children? Too long. He barely knew them anymore.
Before Ron could even think to catch her, Hermione had disappeared into the massive manor house and Draco doubted very much that she would be easy to find if she didn't want anyone to find her.
Lily bounced onto Teddy's bed and curled up against his side. Her eyes drooped tiredly, but there were more important things to worry about than sleep.
Audrey rolled her eyes and nodded. "The department was named by sexist old men with long gray beards that knew little to nothing about 'feminine issues', as they're termed. We've tired to think up another name, but nothing really sums it up like the current one."
"Oh, he is," Draco agreed with pride. "He's got Mother and Father wrapped around his little fingers."
"Lily!" he shouted panicked, launching himself off the front steps of Quality Quidditch and giving chase. James, Albus, and Teddy followed close behind him.
"Why do you say that?" he asked, perplexed and curious. He had never thought that Andromeda had anything against Ginny. The woman didn't seem to have a problem with any of the rest of the Weasleys.
"Oh! He didn't go into details or anything," Scorpius reassured them. "Just told me stuff that wasn't put into any of the newspapers or history books."
"Dad?" The three adults looked over to the kitchen door. James was watching them with a sad weary expression. "When can we go home?" he asked without meeting his father's eyes, choosing instead to stare at the old kitchen floor.
Heaving a very heavy sigh, Lucius nodded and began pulling out various papers from the file he kept all of Harry's information in. "Very well then. I suppose we'll have to have a meeting with Xenophilious as well."
Draco just snorted and rolled his eyes. He turned back to Harry and gave him an amused grin. "What's this? A new child, Potter? Do they just grow on trees at your house?"
Harry apparated away without another word. Ginny sat on the beach staring out at the ocean with tears rolling down her cheeks until the sun disappeared from the sky.
Once they arrived home, Harry extracted promises of loyalty and allegiance from every single snake. They were eager to agree and Harry was able to get a feel for what kind of trouble he'd just gotten himself into.
"Scorpius, your grandfather is kind of scary," Teddy murmured, as he ran a soothing hand over his agitated snakes.
Teddy reached for a cookie still nodding his head distractedly. "It's Andromeda. She said she was named after a constellation."
"We understand, Harry. It is the right thing to do," Arthur said quietly. "We just hope that you don't think you are unwelcome in our family after this. You are still our son, if you want to be."
Harry had wasted no time and began searching high and low for his wife. He had sickening ideas of what he might find. He just hoped he was wrong and it was all just a misunderstanding.
"Ah, yes, but you're so much feistier than I am." He lifted his hand and began gently combing through her tousled blond waves.
"Yeah." He stared down at the grass, toeing at it with his boot. "I’m not angry anymore, but I don't think I'll ever forgive her for what she did. I know I'm not a saint in all this, but I couldn't ever imagine deserting my kids like that."
Truly, he was amazed at the lengths the children would go to answer their questions without adult intervention. Then again, he was ever aware of how he himself would withhold details from his son when he was asked uncomfortable questions.
"Well, kind of, yeah." He shrugged awkwardly and began absently tearing at a green bean with his thumbnail. "Ginny and I hadn't really felt like husband and wife for a while before she left, but I still feel like it’s too soon to get over a decade long marriage.” He looked uncertainly at his adoptive mother.
Coming out of her thoughts, Narcissa continued into the room and pasted a pleasantly bland, attentive smiled on her face. Her hostess skills were so ingrained that they would bend for no one.
“She knows that. Andromeda wouldn’t disappoint her grandson, I’m sure. She’ll come around.” Draco placed a chaste kiss on the corner of Harry’s mouth then pulled away, returning to his afternoon tea.
He nodded. "Alright. Sounds good." It surprised him just how good it sounded. It sounded like he was actually going to be doing something. He'd been painfully static since he’d quit the Ministry and Aurors. His idleness had started to rankle.
Of course, he smothered it the moment she turned her highly put out scowl on him. He had no wish to focus his wife's ire on himself. The children held a measure of immunity by age and dearness. He, on the other hand, had no such advantage. After so many years of marriage, a husband learned to be justifiably afraid of his wife.
He was glad his grandma let him stay because he liked spending time with Harry most of all though. Smiling he darted out from his hiding place and lunged behind a small mountain laurel, his hair fading to a mix of pink and white to match the blossoms.
"Too right I am," Dudley huffed sounding amazingly like Uncle Vernon for a moment. "Fucking birds’er like’ta peck your bleeding eyes out."
"If it's alright with your parents, of course you can." Draco grinned at him then ushered both children away to go play in the gardens with the rest of them.
Harry is stumbling over the wreckage Ginny left in her wake and all he can do is try to pick up the pieces. He gets some help from a surprisingly familiar face.
Lucius didn't say anything to that. He just stood before her stiffly. His own mother frightened him in ways that the Dark Lord never could have.
“Of course it is!” Draco gasped, sounding scandalized. “It’s the beginning of their journey into adulthood. The they are finally able to attend school. Of course it’s important. When I turned eleven, Father gave me my horse, Lightning, and Mother gave me my eagle owl.”
"I'm sorry, we haven’t met," he started, falling back on his lessons in etiquette his mother instilled in him. "I'm Draco Malfoy. I-"
Lucius didn’t fool himself into thinking he didn’t feel the exact same way. He couldn’t deny that he would do anything for his son. Even if it meant he’d have to put up with Harry Potter.
"I still should have seen it, Andromeda. I was her husband and her friend." Agitated he ran fingers through his hair and pulled.
Surprised, Draco gave a small chuckle as he quickly caught the little girl and hoisted her up into the air. "Lily-flower! How are you doing this afternoon? Gosh, you're prettier than the last time I saw you." That seemed to be their cue because the rest of the Potter children rushed toward him as well.
“’M not!" Albus exclaimed sniffling miserably. He turned his head to dry his runny nose on the shoulder of his blue striped t-shirt. “’M not crying."
"I'm also going to need the rest of your financial information, Mr. Potter, so that I may begin to outline a long term plan for your expansion and diversification. Do you have any other requests for investments I should look into or prospects to stay away from?"
"I think what scared me the most, Draco," Harry started softly, "was that this feels nothing like it did with Ginny."
They continued talking as the afternoon turned to evening. Just as the stars were starting to peek through the darkening horizon, the charmed yard lights popping on one by one, Artemis swooped down from the sky and landed smoothly on Harry's shoulder.
"That's alright, Harry." Kingsley waved him off. "Take all the time you need, but remember there's always a place for you here at the Ministry." The tall dark man stood from behind his desk and held out his hand.
Harry and James began to pile food on their plates neither wanting to risk Lucius’s displeasure if they disobeyed. Draco watching the entire thing with amusement.
"Teddy's been a joy just as much as James, Albus, and Lily," Harry said, still smiling. "I've always wanted to have more kids, though. Maybe it stemmed from not having any true family growing up, but I always wanted a huge family of my own. Like the Weasleys," Harry rambled absentmindedly, twirling a lock of Draco's silver blond hair around his fingers.
Molly was heartily ashamed of her daughter, no matter what Harry said about forgiving Ginny, ashamed that she would leave her children like she had. That she would give them up. She thought she’d raised her better, but she wouldn’t say anything to Harry. He was determined to try to understand and forgive her.
The little boy looked up into his eyes for a second then quickly looked back down at his feet, shuffling shyly. "Hi, Harry. I'm glad you're here," he murmured quietly, tentative gray eyes peeking up at him again through silvery blond hair.
Harry remained silent as he listened to his godson stomping up the stairs. Leaning back against the kitchen table with a heavy sigh, he looked down at the two sad snakes around his neck. “
It was true. When Harry had knocked on his door for dinner he'd ignored him and gone without. Reminded of that now, though, he was kinda hungry and wished he hadn't skipped it.
of the children. If you are going to continue saying horrid things about them then I’m going to have to ask you to leave and not come back until you’re not stuck in the past any longer." His words echoed into a thick silence in the kitchen. Andromeda realized she'd finally overstepped her bounds.
Harry was expecting her to jump in and start arguing back at him, but she didn't. Hermione’s expression turned hard and stiff. She shot to her feet and stalked out of the room without another word.
"Ah, Harry," Mowgli greeted, his accent lending his words and intriguing lilt. "She is ready for you. Are you taking her today after all?"
Shaking herself from her maudlin thoughts, Molly picked up another handful of green beans and continued to snap them into a ready bowl in front of her. She glanced over at Harry seated with her at the picnic table. He was just as practiced at snapping and she was glad for the help. Sometimes it felt like she didn’t see him enough, she enjoyed that he came and stayed to help look after all the children.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her, but Harry blushed and answered before he could dissect everyone's strange behavior.
Harry chuckled and seated himself at the counter on one of their mismatched barstools. "Sounds pressing," he ventured dryly.
"Hey, Ron." Harry grinned at him. "How are Rosie and Hugo doing? I assume they’re in the yard since that's where my kids ran off to."
Instead of seeming rebuffed, Charlie just threw his head back and laughed. "I meant nothing by it, Draco," he assured the aloof man with a smirk still on his lips, his hands held aloft unthreateningly. "I sometimes get carried away when it comes to dragons." He grinned playfully. “I like my job a lot.”
Draco knew exactly how he felt. He didn't presume to believe that he could continue his relationship with Harry if the whole of the Weasley clan didn't approve. There had been too many years of rivalry and feuding that he didn't know if they would ever be able to accept him,
“I’m not necessarily worried about Teddy actually going to Hogwarts. I’m more… anxious about him growing up.” Harry shifted so that he could look into Draco’s warm gray eyes. “I don’t think I’m really ready for my kids to grow up and leave home. I keep remembering Teddy when he was a baby and his hair was puke green the entire time he was teething, or how James would just run headlong into a wall while he was learning to walk because he hadn’t gotten the hang of stopping yet.” He chuckled fondly at the memory.
"Yes." Narcissa nodded as she lifted a hand to comfortingly sweep tear damp hair away from Hermione's face. "After Draco was born, I wished for another child so sincerely. Lucius and I tried and tried, but every time it was the same." She paused to swallow back the lump that had started to squeeze in her throat. "Every time they would die before they even had a chance. Three times I miscarried," she murmured sounding choked.
Lucius nodded and strode forward pushing the heavy door open. Stepping into the office, he glanced around and noted that nearly the whole room had been redecorated. The only familiar thing was the ostentatious desk that Kingsley Shacklebolt was sitting behind.
It was different with James, Albus, and Lily, though. He didn't resent them for having to share Harry's attention. They were like his siblings and they loved him like he loved them. Now, that he would be able to visit Harry and his cousins whenever he wanted that ache like something was missing had almost completely gone away.
"Perhaps young Mr. Potter would like to be introduced to Lightning." The drawling voice demanded their attention. Lucius stood next to them with his snake head cane in one hand his other tucked neatly behind his back.
Now that, Harry thought wryly, sounded exactly like something Lucius Malfoy would do. He could see the old bastard being more of an opportunistic businessman than a true raving fanatic.
"Well, you've met his family haven't you? Why shouldn't he have to suffer through the torture of meeting yours?" Ron was really having way too much fun with this.
Lucius flicked his gray eyes from the barrel shaped man and his pretty wife to the two charming children staring enraptured up at his wife. "Interesting. Recessive gene, perhaps?" he inquired blandly as he sipped at his tumbler of scotch.
Sighing, Draco turned to him. "If she really bothers you that much, Harry, then you don't have to come to the Manor while she's there, but she's really only that horrible to Mother after her first day."
"Harry," Draco breathed as he sat up and moved closer to him, pressing their faces together and squeezing his eyes closed to the fear and sadness he felt.
Draco watched him leave the gardens for the floo room and shook his head. This thing with Granger was getting out of hand.
Her husband huffed and tapped his cane on the stall gate in irritation. "Yes, quite lovely and quite unpredictable."
"Yeah, we all had fun today," Harry agreed shifting his hold on his sleeping daughter, his two sons nodded their heads in agreement leaning most of their weight against their dad’s legs.
A few days before Teddy's eleventh birthday party at the Manor, Harry stepped into a rather eclectic shop called Mowgli's Menagerie
Molly blinked for a moment before returning the smile. "Yes, it was fine. You do have a very lovely -um- home," she complimented hesitantly, glancing around at the enormous Manor house and the vast exotic gardens, eyeing the white peacocks strutting across the grass arrogantly.
The man didn't notice his tone. "I'm Herbert Peters IV." The portly man grinned self-importantly and held out a hand for a shake.
Harry had the very surreal experience of watching his shy and often times withdrawn son blush with pleasure and grab the other little boy up in a tight hug.
"I will give you all credit for gumption and neither I nor your grandmother will let on to your little machinations," he said, "but I draw the line at spying on your fathers. No matter how inventive and cleverly it’s done." He tilted his head toward the small snake watching the confrontation intently from in front of Draco's door.
Narcissa had heard some of the women in her garden society raving about her books, so she’d paid the one galleon and two sickles
Harry watched the children reuniting with a sense of guilt for the long separation until a familiar drawling voice stole the entirety of his attention.
"Nah." He lifted a hand to sift through Draco's disheveled hair before continuing. "I was almost in Slytherin, so I can't really complain if one of them gets Sorted there."
When Harry lifted his head again he caught sight of Scorpius crawling toward his father asking in a quiet voice, "Dad, can I have a snake, too?"
Ron and Hermione turned simultaneously incredulous looks on him. "You bought your kids pet snakes?" Hermione asked in disbelief.
. Have it your way." She flicked some crumbs from her fingers and sipped at her tea wrinkling her nose in distaste once more. "It's been five years since Draco's wife disappeared into obscurity and he now just happens to be friends with the Savior? There is more to this, Narcissa."
He shouldn’t have been surprised that out of every wizard in England, Draco was the one most likely to be accepting about his family's gift.
The three of them were quiet for a time until Hermione spoke again. "After it happened, I thought I would die too," she whispered, her shoulders still hunched and head bowed deeply. "I couldn't bear the thought of telling Ron. Of telling anyone."
With gargantuan effort, Harry pried his fingers open and the staff fell to the ground with a clatter, the stone blinking out into darkness.
"Lily, your face is just too pretty to hide," he declared slipping his hands underneath her arms lifting her away from the relative safety of her father and gave her a little toss in the air.
Harry thought about her words. "What if there might be someone else?" he continued almost reluctantly.
"Hey," he replied with a smirk as he curled his fingers into Harry's messy hair. "You can't imagine what chaos it's been around here today."
"Are you sure about him?" James asked. "You'd have to tell him about Dad and Aunt Dromeda's fight," he warned.
Draco blew out a breath and tried to process this information. He'd never liked the littlest Weasley, but he wouldn't have pegged her for the kind of woman that would just give up like that. Then again, isn't that pretty much what his own wife had done if completely voluntarily?
It was meant as a way to spare the children something unpleasant, but Lucius could see that in some cases it was better to be entirely too blunt than to give them edited, sugared answers.
"Alright." Harry nodded keeping his revelation to himself, though he guessed that Lucius knew he'd seen through him. "I'll owl her when I get home. She'll know you're going to contact her."
Harry felt a smile curl his lips as he nodded and ushered his boys toward the floo. "Good night, Draco."
"Yeah, you too. Thanks again for letting us come," Harry returned with a smile of his own over Lily's shoulder. She'd starfished herself to him again and had summarily fallen asleep nearly before he had her settled on his hip.
Draco looked at the next Weasley and instantly recognized him as the eldest son, the son that Fenrir Greyback had savaged during Draco’s sixth year. There were five scarred slashes across his face, but that did nothing to diminish his handsomeness or, apparently, his friendly smile.
"This is an extremely large house," Marianne whispered in astonishment as she walked with Chrissy holding onto her hand. All the Dursleys were staring around themselves in awe.
Molly remembered that. He'd fire-called the Burrow in a panic saying Albus had gotten lost in the Alley, asking if he’d somehow shown up there.
A growl rumbled in Harry's chest as he slid his mouth from Draco's, brushing damp lips along his jaw to his neck. Wrapping his arms around him tightly, Harry pressed his face into Draco's skin and inhaled deeply.
“Thank you for coming, Draco dear,” Molly whispered into Draco’s ear as she gave him a tight squeeze ever mindful of his little girl burden. “And thank you for taking care of Harry and the kids. It’s easy to see just how happy you make them.”
Then it was a blur, a red, and green, and blond, and black, and sunset, and garden blur. Before Draco knew it he'd been pushed and prodded and smiled at and joked with and finally seated at the garden picnic table large enough to seat thirty with room to spare, Harry on one side and George on the other. There seemed to be a pause where everyone stared at the food positively layered on the table before, suddenly, they all reached.
Harry shook his head and schooled his completely devastated expression. “I do not!” He rubbed at his messy hair, frowning at his lover. “It’s just that I like the Manor. Some rooms I could perhaps live without ever having to see again, but the Manor itself is just…” He got a slightly dreamy expression on his face and sighed again. “It’s wonderful.”
"I just wish I hadn't been so bloody blind," he said his tone subdued. "If I hadn't been so bloody wrapped up in my job, she wouldn't have felt like leaving was her only option. I would have tried everything to help her if she’d just asked." He looked at Ron sadly.
The little boy blushed and pulled his hand away from Draco's robe to press it to his mouth in a little fist. Out of the corner of his eye Draco could see Fleur watching his every move like a hawk.
, he added silently, “like I should have, but there is nothing I can do about that now. I am your father, like it or not, and we have to work as a family to get through this. And if I hear one more unhelpful word come out of your mouth you are grounded for a month. Do I make myself clear?" He stared into his son's angry hazel eyes partially covered by a fall of auburn hair.
anything, Cassiopeia," Narcissa retorted. "He is twenty-seven. Draco is free to do as he wishes. As for Harry being a blood-traitor, if it was not for Harry Potter your son would be in Azkaban, your grandson would be dead, your great-grandson would not have even been born, and our entire world would be crumbling down around us."
, now. I believe Mr. Lovegood spends most of his time searching for their -uh- Crumple-Horned Snorkacks."
He thought about Harry. He was cool and smart and funny. He knew everything about Quidditch and catching bad guys. And he made his dad laugh.
"How curious." Cassiopeia hummed, looking off toward the floor to ceiling windows that looked out over the gardens. "It is normally so difficult to grow close to a child," she reflected absently.
Flicking a glance at a suddenly anxious looking Harry, Ron just smiled down at the boy. "Yeah, he thinks you’re something special," he told him causing Scorpius to flush happily.
"He has a son?" Molly inquired happily. That was a good sign. There was more of a chance Harry’s young man would be good to the children if he had one of his own.
. The staff described is the one Merlin got from a pair of evil Sidhe. According to the show the runes on the staff are Ogham, an ancient Celtic language, and are meant to spell out: Abas ocus bithe duthected bithlane, which supposedly translates to: “To hold life and death in your hands”.
Molly gave her an understanding smile and nodded her head sagely. "Well, that's quite alright. With the wards I doubt anyone will get more than a skinned knee. Your mother-in-law planted them, you say?"
Narcissa scoffed and draped her arm around his toned stomach. "Lucius, you act like you're so much older than me. There’s only a year between us."
A suspicious scowl wrinkled Draco's brow and he glanced over. "You heard about what the Weaslette did to him and his children."
Lucius stiffened. "Yes, he was, Mother. However, he turned from a revolutionary to a narcissistic sadistic mass murderer rather quickly after his second rise to power."
Draco watched him with a sad frown on his face until he felt a hand on his lower back. He looked over and smiled at Harry.
George had watched in some fascination the familiar banter between as his brother-in-law and their once sworn enemy. "Malfoy. What a lovely home you have," he complimented with a cheeky grin.
"You were saying earlier that Harry had a guest list already finished," Narcissa reminded while she picked up a cookie from the tray. Mm, she thought as she bit into it, the orange-cream dipped ones, Draco didn't usually like these.
Taking the document back, Lucius looked over the signatures, frowning disdainfully when he saw Harry's horrid handwriting, and pulled out two more sheets of parchment. He spelled two copies of the contract onto them and gave the original to Harry.
Besides, Lucius Malfoy was rich enough for ten people he must be doing something right. It was worth having to put up with him to listen to the man’s suggestions.
An unexpected but very welcome guest comes to stay with Harry and the kids. Then while the whole family is off visiting at Malfoy Manor again, serious conversations are had and family secrets are revealed.
Before Harry to continue with his scolding, Albus stepped up, distracting him. "Hey! Look! This is Draco's shop!"
He told the story about accidentally vanishing the glass around the Boa Constrictor's tank and how the snake had thanked him as he set off on its journey to Brazil.
Lucius pulled out a solid gold featherless quill that resembled a muggle fountain pen and a sheet of heavy glossy parchment.  He began dictating the terms of their agreement while the quill jotted everything down without missing a word. It made Harry distinctly nervous given his history with Quick Quotes Quills.
When the boy seemed to run out of words, Lucius simply sat watching the children fidget while he collected his own thoughts.
"No," Draco replied with a frown. "I didn't see him until just near the end, but I think he'd been listening from the start."
They talked for the rest of the evening about Harry and how the children were holding up. There was a tense moment after Harry had asked if anyone had heard from Ginny. No one had. After that, however, they returned to more pleasant topics.
Harry nodded. He didn't have the energy to even question the fact that Malfoy had a shop. "Well, thanks," he repeated softly, pouring some milk into his tea. "I've been searching for him all afternoon. I don't know what I would have done if he'd-" his voice faltered and he just lifted the cup to his lips and sipped not daring to even finish that thought.
Suddenly his cousin looked so very troubled, his massive shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. "I think Chrissy is a-a- has magic," he finished worriedly.
"That's fascinating," Draco said, truly meaning it. "That's not just women specific, though," he commented shoveling more mashed potatoes onto his plate. God, why was he so freaking hungry?
Standing back to get a better look she placed a hand on her chest as if overwhelmed by the sight of them both and gaze flicking from stunned father to stunned son. "Dear me, you look just like your father. So handsome." Which one of them she was speaking to, Draco didn't know.
Grimmauld had been completely different, however. When Harry had stepped into it the first time in fifth year the whole house radiated menace. It felt sickly and crippled and Dark beyond recognition of what it once was. It felt like the hair standing on the back of your neck, that sudden uncomfortable chill in the air, a mysterious creak on the floor boards of an empty room.
"All three of them?" he asked dubiously, stuck on Harry’s apparent lack of family planning. Of course the delicious things Harry was doing with his mouth were distracting. There was a renewed stirring in his groin. He shifted his hips encouragingly.
Slowly turning his head, he caught Hermione's eyes and held them, the warning plainly clear. She didn't open her mouth again, but the sour expression on her face remained.
Scorpius, Albus, Lily, James, Teddy, Belle, Tal, Mischief, Nova, and Stella sat on fluffy cushions up in Scorpius's play room. They were circled around the little low table covered snacks, a bowl of candy, a tray of sweets, and a pitcher of pumpkin juice. The adults were downstairs drinking tea and talking about boring adult things so the kids were free to plot uninterrupted.
Surprise flashed across Draco’s face for a blink then it was gone replaced by a pleased grin. "You know what, Harry. I think I'd like that. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, friends at last." He laughed and leaned back in his chair sipping his drink contently.
"I really don't know all that much." Scorpius shrugged as they all sat around on the floor of his playroom. "I don't know how I can help you."
Lightning’s gaze past over all of them but paused on James. He leisurely ambled toward them and nudged at Narcissa's outstretched hand with his nose. His eyes, however, never moved from James. That alone made Harry very nervous.
"Whichever you want, Dud,” Harry chuckled. “So, what's up? How's Marianne?" he inquired sincerely. Marianne Dursley was a surprisingly sweet woman and Harry had often wondered what exactly possessed her to marry Dudley in the first place.
"Yes," was all Draco said on the matter. He didn't feel like getting into that issue with his father. "I need to go and check on the main course." He slipped away into the crowd only pausing to greet Mr. and Mrs. Granger when they stepped through the doors following a uniformed Shotzy.
Draco privately thought it was a very modest gathering, but didn't say as much. Harry's eyes twinkling with amused understanding were enough acknowledgment for him.
!" he called as forcefully as he could and grinned brightly when a volley of green sparks shot from the end of Harry's wand.
"They choose to be in servitude?" she asked incredulously, a bit of an angry glint in her eyes. Draco could tell that she was becoming quickly disenchanted with the Wizarding World. Dudley didn't need to see the unpleasant truth. He'd been forced into hiding during the war and attacked by Dementors. He knew it wasn't all charms and lights and old magical things.
"He failed to kill Albus Dumbledore, as you read, but he succeeded in helping Death Eaters enter Hogwarts. Because Severus Snape completed his task for him he was spared." His eyes fell on Albus for a moment, thinking back on the boys namesakes. "Severus Snape was a spy. Dumbledore engineered his own death with Severus so that my son would not have to commit murder." He paused seeming lost in his own mind for a moment then shook himself and returned to the present.
He'd sent off an owl to George to warn him of Lucius's request for information and had promptly found the redhead flooing into his kitchen to badger him with questions while bombarding him with manipulation detection spells. Harry just batted him away, sat him down with a cup of tea, and started explaining everything.
"That's what prophylactic spells are for." Draco sighed in pleasure and tilted his head to give Harry better access.
Her hair was done up in a tight twist and held in place with a charmed mother of pearl comb. Her jewelry was all real and all much too ostentatious to be anything less than exorbitant. The temperature in the room dropped a good five degrees and Lucius actually sank down into his chair seeming to try and make himself as small and unnoticeable as possible.
Turning back to the other visitor in his kitchen, he smiled as she pulled him into a hug. "Good morning, Harry." She smiled and squeezed him.
Draco watched her for a moment before murmuring, "I'm sorry, Hermione. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
