“Wonder what she just admitted,” Harry murmured, watching intently. Draco chuckled to himself. Cheers and applause broke out when another girl reached across the table and kissed her.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Draco laughed easily, something Harry had only seen in the Great Hall when Draco was with Pansy or Blaise. Pride swelled in Harry’s chest at the accomplishment.
“Was in Hogsmeade... Got attacked again… Had to spend the night at St. Mungo’s,” McGonagall was perched in her chair, listening with a raised eyebrow and her mouth set in a firm line.
“I accepted a teaching position for DADA, that’s why we wanted to meet you, so I could tell you in person,” Harry said quickly before more on the subject could be said. Ron’s jaw dropped comically, and he clapped him on the shoulder.
When Harry James Potter was wheeled into St. Mungos on a stretcher for the third time in four days, Draco nearly quit on the spot. A string of Potter’s friends and co-workers at Hogwarts had recently been targeted by an unknown assailant, which had put the entire wizarding community on edge and had made Draco’s work life a living hell.
“Isn’t true
“Destroyed it. Moral of the story, now you guys know why I make such a big deal about researching spells before I teach them to you,” Harry glanced at his watch again. There was barely enough time for him to teach how to cast episkey.
Harry’s reply was affirmative, even though most of it was muffled by Draco’s chest.  Draco climbed out of the bed and quickly got dressed in presentable clothes. Harry wolf-whistled appreciatively when Draco swapped his pajama pants for trousers.
“I was planning on doing it for you two after everyone returned from Christmas break. But, I’ve realized that since Quidditch matches are about to start, I can’t possibly be running two houses at the same time,”
“Thank you,” he said quietly and Narcissa stepped back slightly, keeping her hands on Harry’s shoulders. He flushed as she studied him with a faint smile on her face.
“Not all of us are saviors of the world,” Draco said tiredly. “If I were to go, something bad would happen,”
“What? Of course, it’s that big of a deal, Potter!”  Draco sat up fully, taking his feet off of Harry’s lap. He instantly missed the contact. “For all anyone knows, you could be as powerful as Merlin himself,”
“I’m serious, you prat,” Harry grinned at Draco, who rolled his eyes. “When's your next class start?”
“I’m so glad you’re awake!” She exclaimed, nearly toppling him over with the force of her hug.
“Well, did it at least work?” Draco asked. Hermione rubbed her face, smearing the ash even worse.
“Whatever you say,” Harry muttered, letting the silence between them remain this time. Harry finished his plate and levitated it to the closest countertop, leaning back on his elbows.
in this damn castle for a long time.
“That warms my heart, Potter,” Draco teased and Harry flipped him off. They finished their butterbeers just as the clock chimed four.
“Not my fault,” Harry said innocently. Before anyone could reply, Madam Pomfrey’s voice sliced through the hospital wing.
“Alright, Profe- Minerva,” Harry tried to be agreeable, despite knowing that he and Draco were the center of one of her notorious schemes. She smiled warmly.
Draco watched Harry read through a book, but it seemed like he wasn’t actually attempting to read it. After a few minutes, Draco decided he wasn’t going to continue to torture himself any longer by watching him.
“I haven’t seen one since my third year, but it was a dementor back then,” Harry said carefully. “There’s one in the cupboard behind me, but we’ll get to that after I teach you the spell,” Most of the class looked at the cupboard suspiciously. “Does anyone know the spell?”
“Not even Dumbledore could do both at the same time. Your magic has got to be way stronger than you realize if you can do wandless and silent without a second thought,” Harry fidgeted.
“Are you going to file a report?” Harry shook his head silently. “Okay, but if this guy ever tried to lay a finger on you again, I’ll hex his balls off,”
Harry woke to sunlight streaming through his curtains and painting his room in a peaceful brightness. He got dressed and curled up in his chair, watching the pictures on his desk move. Birds sang a cheerful song outside, and Harry cracked his window open to hear it better. Despite his date last night, Harry felt content.
“We were all awfully worried about you. Had an easy time managing your classes though,”
“Skeeter’s here,” Draco whispered as soon as he saw Harry. Harry’s jaw clenched and he looked around the store, trying to locate the reporter. Her back was turned to them, but she was in the next aisle over.
“Did you need something?” Harry asked.
Harry hated being alone for this reason. He knew he relied on other people too much, and that only tore him down even further. He wished Hermione was here.
“Sod off,” Grinning, Harry stepped into the crowd of students and was soon pointing out mistakes and praising good performances. Once his half of the room was doing well, Harry glanced at Draco, who was demonstrating the proper wand movement to have the strongest shield. Harry watched him fondly until his attention was brought back to his students. As Harry predicted, his class ran nearly to the bell, but not close enough to get him out of his deal with the Slytherin girl. Draco sat in Harry’s swivel chair, and Harry plopped himself on his desk. With an audience of his class and Draco, Harry sniffed the Amortentia delicately.
“Oh geez, your shelf
“But the look on her face was worth it,” Draco replied.
For some reason, Harry was waking up in the hospital wing again. The white lights burned his eyes, but he ignored it and sat up.
“Okay, Hermione,” Harry retorted, and Draco laughed indignantly.
“Is it safe to assume you two can work professionally without getting into childish debates?” Something told Harry the only acceptable answer was ‘yes’.
“I didn’t really,” Adam grinned, finally appearing more relaxed. “I’m sure they had their beliefs about it, but in all honesty, that newspaper was the first confirmation that anyone got,”
“By all means, I won’t reject your help,” Draco headed into the cluster of students, immediately helping a boy who seemed frustrated. With both Professors helping, the class finished the five shields quickly and looked at Harry expectantly.
“How long?” Harry asked, almost scared for the answer.
“How? I think it would have made things worse for me to be in Slytherin, honestly,” Harry said.
“Yeah, and I did expelliarmus with the first year class I had,” Draco snickered. “Sod off, it’s useful,” Harry grumbled.
“I- Uh..” Harry couldn’t form a sentence in his brain, and he was vaguely aware that he was gaping like a fish.
“You were almost a Slytherin?” Harry was expecting something different from the awe in Draco’s voice. “Why didn’t you get sorted in?”
Harry walked to breakfast in high spirits, even though Draco was still asleep when Harry left. He was greeted at the staff table with smiles and waves, and he poured himself a steaming mug of coffee, even though he didn’t usually drink it.
“Be my guest,” Harry replied.
McGonagall seemed to have ended her speech, as the staff members all broke out in conversation, and some headed in the direction of their classrooms. She made eye contact with Harry, then beckoned him forward near where she was now sitting.
“What was that, Malfoy?” She set the book on the table and flipped it open, brows furrowed in confusion when she saw a handwritten note in the front cover. “Merlin left a warning in this book,” She whispered.
“Is he teaching Potions?” Harry blurted, surprised. Draco hadn’t mentioned teaching at Hogwarts to Harry. McGonagall nodded.
“I don’t mind teaching you at all, but it’s a very long lesson and it’s basically impossible to accomplish it all in one day,” Harry said. “You’ll need to be at a mental center with yourself and the more frustrated you get, the more difficult it becomes,”
“One would assume I would know all about this,” Hermione snorted a laugh and closed the book.
“Your neck looks awful,” Harry gingerly touched the area, halfway expecting it to hurt.
“You brought biscuits last time,”
Harry apparated to Diagon Alley in search of the clothing store he frequented when he needed new clothes. It was a mix of informal and semiformal, and for the first time, Harry walked to the semiformal section.
“That’s bull,” Harry jumped when Draco whispered in his ear. “The defense classroom is easily repairable, and so is the potions,”
Harry stood in front of his class, twenty faces looking at him excitedly. Third years, at least, had gone to school with Harry for a bit so he knew some of their names.
“Oh really? How interesting, I didn’t know that,” Harry drawled, sarcasm dripping from his voice. Draco chuckled.
“Just thinking about cleaning all this up makes me tired,” Draco considered this for a moment.
“I’d like to know how bad Merlin’s was, and if he had more after the first one,” Hermione sighed.
“Harry,” McGonagall stood and strode toward him, gripping him in a hug as soon as she reached him. “I’m very pleased to inform you all that Mr. Potter has agreed to teach defense against the dark arts,” The other teachers applauded enthusiastically, and McGonagall sent him a proud glance.
“We’ll see you later, then,” Draco said politely, turning on his heel towards the door.
“I ended up having to use fiendfyre to try and burn this thing, and it exploded in my face!” Harry scratched the back of his neck, trying not to laugh.
“I wanna go somewhere. Let’s go to Hogsmeade!” Harry stood and started looking for presentable clothes.
“I’m already going to be out of town on Hollow’s eve,” Harry said. “Since it falls on a Saturday, I’m spending the day in Godric’s Hollow,” The remainder of Harry’s sentence went without saying, and Slughorn smiled sadly.
“It’s not like Draco knows Harry talks to his mum that much,” Ron’s face flushed at the fact that Hermione had used the ferret’s first name.
“Wanna help clean up Veritaserum?”
“Harry,” Teddy whined, dragging out the end of Harry’s name for an impressive amount of time. When he determined he had received Harry’s undivided attention, he pointed at the floor. Harry sighed and put Teddy on the floor, helping him balance while he got used to supporting his own weight.
“I have more muggle money than I know what to do with. I’ll get you a box of chocolates,”
“Oh, couldn’t resist it,” Draco nibbled on another biscuit and the two fell into silence. Harry itched to have a conversation with him.
“How’s it going in here?” Harry hadn’t even noticed that Draco had come into the room.
“We’re teenagers too,” Harry whispered back. Draco pulled his hand off Harry’s knee, and Harry instantly missed it. McGonagall finally walked in, a crowd of tiny eleven-year-olds following her. Excited conversations broke out, but they all fell silent when the Sorting Hat appeared.
“Harry, dear, it’s so good to see you,” she hugged him tightly, the smell of vanilla lingering even after she let him go. Harry always thought she was an exceptional hugger.
“She did that to me this morning, saying she wants me to be head of Slytherin,”
“Well I mean, a lot of the support I got was because I was opposite of Voldemort in a lot of ways and me being a Gryffindor was a big differential thing,” Harry crossed his arms over his chest defensively.
When Harry woke again, he was absolutely starving. Pomfrey gave him a once-over and let him go. Harry immediately headed for the kitchens, stomach growling loudly the whole way.
“How’d your day go?” Harry asked before shaking the water out of his hair. Draco definitely didn’t use the opportunity to further appreciate Harry’s toned upper body, that would be crazy.
“If we have enough time at the end of class, I will,” Harry extended his hand, and the girl shook it, sealing their deal. “Good thing we’re working on nonverbals and I expect this lesson will stretch very close to the bell. The girl huffed in defeat, tucking the vial into her bag and drawing her wand.
“Well that’s all fine and good, but that doesn’t excuse you for literally breaking into my room!” Harry shouted. Draco drew his wand.
He was leaning against the building, his expression a mix between annoyed and sad. Harry wordlessly handed him one of the chocolates he’d bought and Draco accepted it.
“Back off my mother, Potter. She’s married,” Harry choked, much to Draco’s amusement.
“I did. I didn’t know what the spell would do, but I cast it anyways on one of my classmates, and I nearly killed him. Luckily, that healing spell saved his life. I don’t know what I would have done if he’d died. I honestly might not have won against Voldemort,” Several students cringed at the name which Harry chose to ignore.
“You would have died within your first week,” Draco decided. “From the absence of light. Is that a thing?”
“You knew about that?” Harry’s head shot up.
“At least thirty,” Harry said, sitting back on his heels to think.
“Good afternoon, Sleeping Beauty,”
“I fell asleep,” he admitted, much to Jason’s amusement.
“That’s one of the lectures I remember rather vividly,” Draco murmured. “That man scared me shitless already, and that stunt he pulled with that spider didn’t help,” Harry chuckled dryly.
“I’ll see you again soon. Draco, would you please show him out so I can get ready for the dinner?” Draco nodded, walking out of the room and Harry followed. Neither of them spoke until they got to the ornate front door.
“Narcissa… Malfoy?” Ron asked carefully. Hermione cringed at how quiet Ron’s voice had gotten. Harry swallowed, half expecting Ron to blow up at him.
“I was at St. Mungos. I got attacked at Hogsmeade,” Slughorn scowled, indiscreetly checking over his shoulders for listeners.
“You owe me a date to Hogsmeade,” Harry said cheekily, starting to pull the blankets off of him. Draco managed to save one blanket and wrapped it around himself tightly.
Thinking about healing spells made Harry’s mind go back to Draco, and it was difficult for him to get through the lecture without saying something he didn’t mean to, He kept thinking about the stark absence of the healer when Harry was getting discharged. He still felt a pang of guilt about how he’d behaved, and seeing Draco’s completely shattered expression twisted Harry’s heart.
“This is a trap,” Draco muttered to himself. “I suppose I’ll go. Butterbeer doesn’t sound too horrible,” Harry beamed at Draco, and Draco decided he’d never tire of seeing that smile on Harry’s face.
Nevertheless, he rushed into the intensive care unit, readying his wand. Potter was lying half-conscious, trying his best to stumble out of the room to prove he was ‘perfectly fine’.
“It’s awfully boring by myself over there,” He said as a greeting, handing Harry one of the mugs.
After just one look at each other, they both burst out in hysterical laughter. Harry could barely catch his breath long enough to order them both butterbeers. After several minutes, Draco finally spoke.
Draco didn’t realize that teaching classes would be so tiring, but he felt dead on his feet by the time his last class of the day was dismissed. He walked to his portrait, ready for a hot shower and sleep. He only had two classes scheduled for tomorrow, and they were both O.W.L. level classes.
“Yes, that too,” Draco said. A sudden outburst of laughter and cheering drew everyone's attention back to the Gryffindor, where one girl sat surrounded by her friends, beet red.
“You heard perfectly well what my question was, Harry. Why did you leave knowing the attacker was after you and still on the loose?”
“Alright, alright,” Harry couldn’t resist saying no, and he was curious himself. Harry unlocked the cabinet again, and it seemed to be several minutes before the boggart appeared. Ron stepped out of the cabinet, and confused whispers broke out across the room, but they fell silent when he began to speak.
“Okay,” Harry leaned back, snapping the textbook closed. “I have a class starting in a few minutes. Why don't you guys talk about what the best memory would be and come back here in a couple days after lessons?”
“I didn’t mention this to the other staff members, but since we had to move your two classrooms, we don’t have enough staff dormitory bathrooms. You two will have separate sleeping quarters but will have to share a bathroom,” In Harry’s opinion, she appeared to be half remorseful, half mischievous. He glanced at Draco, who had an ‘I told you so’ expression on his face.
“So, the first thing we should check is any gift books Harry has received from a woman with a son around his age,” Hermione said offhandedly, drumming her fingers on her chin. Draco sucked in a sharp breath, standing up so quickly his chair toppled over.
“Harry went on a date with a stalker,” Draco said and Harry rolled his eyes. Hermione glanced at Harry, questioning if Draco was exaggerating. Harry only shrugged.

Draco ended up choosing Poppy as his (which caused rather a big uproar among Pansy and Blaise. Luna didn’t mind. "The best view is up front", she'd told Teddy).

“I always do,”
“Miss Muerello,” Harry said politely, already fearing her shenanigans. She was a fifth-year and a well-known snoop, rival to Pansy Parkinson, according to Draco.
“We should go get biscuits for your mum,” Harry said as they walked out of the pub.
“It’s not that big a deal,” Harry said, leaning his head on his knees and looking at Draco.
“Sorry guys, I’m not really allowed to tell you where I was yesterday,” Both hands dropped back down. There were a few disappointed groans. “But, I’m alive and well so we can continue lessons per usual. Unfortunately for you guys, it’s a boring lecture about healing spells and we’ll see if there’s enough time at the end to go over some basic ones,”
“Oh, sod off. I only did that to you,” The waitress dropped off two large mugs of foaming butterbeer, and Harry grabbed his eagerly.
“Look,” Hermione opened the book and turned it so Harry could read it. “Merlin left a warning for the next owner,”
“I suppose,” Harry’s resulting smile brightened the whole room, in Draco’s opinion. “It’ll be crowded there though, are you sure you want to be seen with me?” Harry laced his hand in Draco’s and gave it a squeeze.
It was a simple black book with gold lettering reading ‘The Dark Arts & Their Effects: Teacher’s Edition’. Harry grinned at a beaming Narcissa and accepted her hug.
Harry swore loudly, and several different items seemed to be falling to the floor and shattering. Jason seemed to be chanting something, and as soon as he finished, the room fell silent. The only thing Draco could hear was his own breathing.
“If you go out through the employee’s exit, I’ll pay for the candy and meet you outside,” Harry whispered, watching Skeeter as she slowly moved through the aisle.
“Why’d you have to use it?” A different girl asked from the other side of the room, and Harry stiffened.
“I’ll be sure to mention that I’m grateful to them next time I see them,” Slughorn hummed his agreement but didn’t reply.
“So, how’s Auror work going for you, Ron?” Hermione asked after a silent moment passed over the table. For the first time, Ron’s flushed face disappeared completely and he dove into a tale about how they had finally rounded up the last of a particularly tough group of rogue Death Eaters.
A house-elf greeted him quickly, despite the fact that it was much past dinnertime and it was dark outside. The elf made a plate full of meats and fruits, insisting that Harry looked “very pale and sickly,”
“Follow me,” Harry said, turning on his heel towards the Gryffindor tower. He heard Draco’s light footsteps behind him eventually catch up to him.
“Is everything okay?” Draco asked, carefully stepping into the room. Both occupants whipped around to face him. Draco noticed the stranger reach for his wand while Harry’s attention was on Draco.
“I’m sure if we looked, we could find something about Merlin in the library. Ron, you don’t have to come if you don’t want to. I know you have things to do at work,”
“Let’s go set up your classroom,” Harry put his fork on his plate with finality and pushed the plate away from him. Draco followed suit and they walked to the potions room in easy conversation.
“Yeah? It was notorious,” Draco said. “Honestly,  I’m surprised she didn’t get caught,” Harry rolled over onto his back.
“Oh, you wish. Gryffindor doesn’t stand a chance now that McArthur graduated last year,”
“Let’s just keep looking,” Harry muttered, pushing his plate to the side. He suddenly wasn’t hungry anymore. Hermione reopened the book she had been reading before Harry arrived.
“She’ll see you,” Draco whispered back. He was glaring down at the back of her head.
In the end, most of his class got the concept fairly easily, and he dismissed them, relishing in the silence of an empty classroom. His head was pounding, and the ache in his lungs still hadn’t left, but he ignored it and reached for the small bottle of firewhiskey he’d stashed under his desk.
He’d been in high spirits since the book got destroyed, and his good mood had spread across the school.
“See ya ‘round, Slug,” Harry didn’t really know when he’d adopted the nickname for Slughorn, but he didn’t care to stop.
“I expect to see you both at every house match. I encourage friendly competitive behavior from all of my Professors in order to set a good example,” McGonagall held eye contact with each of them for a beat.
“It’s called ‘Magica Captionem’ and it's incredibly rare,” Harry blanched. “They are essentially seizures that grow a witch’s or wizard’s powers and the last time one that powerful has been recorded was with Merlin himself,”
“Take a seat, Miss Muerello, we have things to do,” She huffed in annoyance and plopped in her chair, but Harry didn’t miss the looks his class gave each other.
“I thought Granger had her?”
He had read through the least known magical creatures and how to defend against them. The list hadn’t been long, but Harry felt like his brain had turned to mush just after trying to memorize the spells.
Try as he might, he couldn’t even shake the thought of Malfoy looking completely hopeless. He’d only seen him like that once before, back when he was forced to join the other side of the battle of Hogwarts. He wondered what had happened to Malfoy last night to put him in such a fit.
“Who’s owl is that?” Ron asked as soon as it had flown off. Harry, still immersed in the letter, only replied with an offhand “Narcissa’s.” As soon as he realized what he said, he slapped his hand over his mouth and looked up to see Hermione and Ron staring at him.
“Oh, yeah. They all love you so much, couldn’t bear to do anything that might reflect badly on you,” Slughorn had migrated into the room, leaning comfortably against one of the desks.
“2:54. You got a date or something?” Harry cracked one eye open to watch Draco.
“Like my story, Potter?” Draco propped his feet on Harry’s lap, and Harry just rolled his eyes.
When nobody moved, he dismissed them and sank slowly into his chair while they hurriedly left. He knew Draco was teaching right now, so he propped his feet on his desk and closed his eyes, trying to clear his mind. It was moments like these when Harry was forced to look at his life as if it were a series of accomplishments.
As soon as he had stepped through the door, Jason cast a quick spell to declutter, even though there wasn’t much in the way. Harry perched on the arm of the couch, watching Jason shrug off his jacket and drape it over a chair. He then grabbed two beer bottles out of the fridge and used magic to pop the caps off.
“Well, I know, but-”
“But we all thought you were the one that was telling her a bunch of stories about me,” Harry said. Draco scoffed.
“Never heard you refer to me as ‘Professor Malfoy’ before,” Draco whispered as the students got back into their partners and began practicing. Harry summoned cushions and levitated them in front of his wall in case someone’s shield failed.
“Nothing,” Draco’s knee had begun bouncing and he wouldn’t look at Harry. Harry turned slightly so his head was resting on Draco’s leg. Draco finally looked at Harry, eyebrows drawn together in bewilderment.
“I was just looking at my new face,” Harry called back, stepping out of the bathroom. Ron was awake now, sitting up. Madam Pomfrey stood next to Ron, hands on her hips and an annoyed expression on her face.
“It’s nice to see them acting a lot more unified than we ever did,” Harry commented. There seemed to be a very intense game of ‘never have I ever’ going on between the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. Draco hummed his agreement.
“Unless you are very good at nonverbal spells, you’re more than welcome to watch me teach my class,” Draco’s face brightened slightly.
“S’pose. Dunno how my schedule’s gonna look and all that,”
“You’re getting drunk, we should-” Harry was cut off by Jason harshly crashing their lips together. Harry froze for a second, shocked. He grabbed Jason’s shoulders and pushed him back, sending him tumbling off the couch. Harry stood quickly, stepping over Jason’s form on the floor. He swore when Jason grabbed his leg and yanked it, dragging Harry onto the floor too.
“He just wanted to cast them, in my opinion,” Draco cocked his head to the side, scowling.
“You idiot. Come with me. I was inviting you to come with me,” Draco looked at Harry, but Harry wasn’t paying attention.
When Harry finally looked up from the book hours later, shadows had shifted across the room and his eyes burned horribly. He dog-eared the page and tossed the book on the corner of the desk, then ran his fingers through his hair.
“Whoever gets promoted first is the winner,” Harry said cheekily. “I don’t even know who the head of Slytherin is right now,” Harry hopped onto one of the desks, feet resting in the chair.
“I’m very sorry to hear that,” Harry replied, laughing at Draco’s dramatically affronted expression.
“Yeah, I’ve exchanged a lot of letters with her over the course of the year,”
“You’re one hell of a Prince Phillip,” Draco replied, letting Harry lay nearly on top of him. Their legs were tangled together in the blanket, chests flush with one another.
“And what?”
“You’re the one who almost bought the entire stock at Honeydukes,” Draco bit a chocolate frog delicately, pretending to ignore Harry’s comment.
“Did you see the face? What happened?”
“Too damn long,” He whispered, pulling Harry back in for another addictive kiss.
What do you mean you know?” Hermione exclaimed shrilly. Draco woke with a start. “How long have you known? Why didn’t you destroy it when you saw the letter?”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry interrupted, causing Draco and Flitwick to laugh while Harry rolled his eyes.
“Language,” Harry chided, much to the amusement of his class. Draco unscrewed it and smelled it, and his face lit up in a blush. Before Draco could start listing what it smelled like, the bell for lunch rang, and Draco quickly lidded the vial and handed it back to its owner. Once the classroom was empty, Draco turned to face Harry.
A dramatically staged gasp behind Harry drew both of their attention to the reporter, who was pulling her quill and notepad out of her crocodile-skin purse.
“Saturday,” Draco turned and looked at Harry, who was still rummaging through papers.
“What do you need me to do?” Harry blinked at Draco, surprised.
“How the hell did you get a job there?” Ginny blurted, taking earning surprised glances from her two friends.
“Two,”
“Good day, Potter,” She snapped, glancing around her to make sure no one had heard their exchange. She walked out of the store quickly and Harry paid for the candies and exited out the back in search of Draco.
“How many cauldrons do you need to set up?” Harry asked.
“You’re insufferable,”
“Very funny,” Harry huffed. “I always go over at 4:15 anyways,” Draco glanced at his watch. “Hey, you never answered if you were coming or not,”
“Would you help me set up? My shelves are a complete mess and I can’t get ready for my next class and arrange them,” Harry shrugged.
“It’s not that big of a deal. Night, Draco,”
“I just happened to see you walking into a clothing store, and then I just so happened to find myself desiring to spend time in a muggle park. How coincidental!”
As soon as Harry got to his dorm, he shrugged off his jacket and headed to the bathroom to run water on his face.
“What for? You haven’t even done anything to even mildly inconvenience that entire household,” Draco curiosity was piqued since Harry’s boggart wasn’t what he expected it to be.
“It’s very busy, even more so when big feasts are coming up,” She answered, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of him. “When it is empty in the school, we all love talking to visitors to the kitchen. We get bored sometimes but nobody likes to leave,” Harry nibbled a strawberry as he mulled that over. He followed suit, sitting on the floor next to her.
“Twenty more minutes,”  Draco said through a yawn, he still hadn’t even opened his eyes. Harry curled up next to him, draping his arm around Draco’s waist.
“You’ve put a lot of thought into this, haven’t you?” Draco asked, not expecting an answer.
Harry held Teddy on his hip while the toddler focused on changing his hair color to jet black. Andromeda had a ‘family emergency’, as she explained to Harry in a hurry. Not even Molly had been able to watch the poor kid, so Harry and Draco had to trade-off with Teddy-duty between classes.
“Don’t you know it,” Draco replied. Harry returned to his food, but he seemed to be pushing it around on his plate more than he was eating it. “And you say I’m the one that looks terrified,”
“I thought you’d died,” She said once Draco had pulled himself a chair. He smiled fondly.
‘I am very pleased to say that she indeed does miss me, she invited me for tea the weekend before classes start. Will you be there too?’ Harry refolded the paper and flicked it at Draco, who caught it in one hand, meeting Harry’s eyes briefly before opening it. Harry’s attention was snapped back to the lecture when he heard McGonagall mention ‘defense against the dark arts’.
“What happened to you? You look like you lost a fight with a phoenix,” Harry asked and Hermione sighed tiredly.
“I’ve determined that I’m going to get absolutely nothing done for the rest of the week,” Harry said. He and Draco joined the students on the floor, and Teddy immediately ran to Draco and plopped in his lap.
“I didn’t have a great first impression?” Draco only raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t like you,” Harry said, laughing. Draco chewed his lip, appearing to be in deep thought.
The group took this as their cue and slid into the desks, listening intently while Harry explained the process of casting the spell- and the mental barriers a student would typically face.
Ron stared at Harry and Hermione in a slight sense of shock, but more than anything, he could feel his temper rising. Getting upset was nothing to do in such a crowded place, with shoppers and waiters bustling around.
“Dramatic, are we?” Harry raised his middle finger to the general direction of the bathroom and heard a laugh in reply.
“I don’t know how she manages to do everything she does,” Harry said, and Draco hummed his agreement. Harry was trying to not get flustered at Draco’s close presence, and how he smelled like mint and metal.
“How do you think I’d know what it feels like to be under it that long?” He nodded at the last person with their hand up.
“Were you following me?” Harry snapped, glaring at her. She hummed innocently.
“Well, that’s not terrifying at all,” Harry muttered.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” McGonagall said, and cheers broke out at her words. “After the first-years get sorted, I have a few announcements, then the Feast will begin. Mister Jaxton Ashby is the first to be sorted,” She called several names, and Harry tried to keep up with memorizing them, but he failed rather quickly. Draco shifted in his chair when the last girl got sorted into Ravenclaw.
“What does it feel like to be under the Imperius curse?” Harry scratched the back of his neck.
“Where were you yesterday?” Presley was the unofficial leader of the group, and she strode purposefully into the classroom once Slughorn was gone.
“I officially hate teaching about the Unforgivables,” Draco’s eyes snapped up, and he tossed the stack of papers and his quill onto his desk.
“I’ll let you go prepare for your next class,” McGonagall said after a long pause. Harry silently left the office, heading for his classroom. He had the sinking feeling he’d be stuck
“I’ve put a lot of thought into a lot of things,” Harry replied, that sarcasm coming out again. “But, I think about the Slytherin thing a lot,” He admitted. A bell rang for dinner, and the two got up and headed to the Great Hall.
“I feel completely fine,” Harry begged, sitting on the edge of the bed. Pomfrey raised an eyebrow.
“Bloody hell, you sound like an elderly grandmother,” Draco commented. Harry gasped dramatically, pretending to be offended. Draco laughed again and Harry grinned broadly, proud of his accomplishment.
“It’s late, Potter, and you’ve had a long day. I’ll let you get to bed,”
“Sure. Haven’t had muggle alcohol in years though,” Jason smiled and extended his hand. Harry took it and they apparated to a dark alley. A small stream of light glowed across Jason’s eyes, and it was very difficult for Harry to bring his gaze away from them. As the pair walked, music poured out from a bar, and Harry could feel his stomach knotting with anticipation.
Their first stop was three broomsticks, after carefully scouting the inside to make sure Jason wasn’t working. They got a booth in the corner and went through several mugs of butterbeer, chatting and flirting animatedly.
Harry was getting tired of waking up in the hospital wing rather than his own bed. It took an immense amount of energy for Harry to grab his glasses from the table and put them on. For some reason, Hermione’s head was next to his knee, and she was fast asleep. Ron was sitting in the chair next to her, arms crossed over his chest and snoring lightly. Harry watched them for a moment before slowly crawling out from under the bedsheets. The room spun around him but he continued to stand until his head cleared. A set of loud footsteps approaching caused Harry to freeze until the curtain around his bed was pulled back to reveal Draco.
“When are you supposed to get back to work?” Trina asked.
Harry closed the book harshly, hands trembling slightly. Maybe that’s why Draco had been so surprised about the plate levitating. Harry took a deep breath to calm himself down and reopened the book. The logical side of him was telling him to find a way to destroy the book before something bad happened to him. But the other side of him wanted to know just how powerful this book could make him, plus it could have useful information inside. Besides, it’s rude to throw away a gift. Harry opened the book to the first page and began reading.
“Not particularly,” Harry said, kneeling next to Draco and the giant puddle of liquid on the floor. He transfigured an abandoned quill into a rag and began helping Draco clean the mess.
“I’ve never cast a failed silent spell in my life,” Draco said, smirking.
Harry had tried several times to get through his lecture on Grindylows, but it seemed that the toddler’s main goal of the day was to distract Harry in every way he knew how.
“So then how do you throw it off?”
“Sod off, It was that Creevey kid who made it,” Draco said. “The one who’s brother was the one with the camera who was obsessed with you,” Harry flushed and returned to cleaning the mess.
“Fine. You look terrified as fuck,” Draco gave Harry a halfhearted glare. He popped a grape in his mouth and chewed slowly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Noooo,” Teddy cried dramatically, reaching up and pulling at Draco’s hair. Draco made a face at Teddy, earning an exciting laugh from him. Teddy jumped out of Draco’s lap and headed for Harry, crashing into his chest and wrapping his little arms around the back of Harry’s neck.
“True, but Weaslette graduated too if you haven’t noticed,” Draco quipped.
“I dunno,” Draco stood, dusting off his trousers. Harry definitely didn’t watch him in interest.
Mail came a few minutes later, interrupting breakfast with hundreds of letters and copies of the Daily Prophet. A letter was dropped in front of Harry, and the writing on the outside was unmistakably Ron’s.
“What? No, I’ve been awake for thirty seconds,”
His scar no longer looked like a drawing o a lightning bolt. Instead, it now stretched across his forehead and eyes like an actual bolt of lightning. It branched over his eyes and the bridge of his nose.
“I haven’t given you your gift,” Harry saw Draco glance between the two of them quizzically. Narcissa grabbed a book that Harry had failed to notice from the bookshelf and presented it to him.
“I’m just hungry,” Hermione nodded sympathetically before she spoke.
“It’ll go away soon enough,”
“Did you do that wandlessly and silently?” Harry looked at Draco in confusion, suddenly embarrassed.
Harry’s week was filled with rebounded spells, several students tearing holes in their robes, and one particular student who could not say a complete sentence without cursing. For some reason, Harry found himself drawn to Draco’s classroom after the final class on Friday evening. Draco appeared to be scrubbing the floor, and Harry cleared his throat to let him know he had company.
“You must be really daft if you thought that,” Draco said, closing his eyes and settling closer to Harry.
He slowly sat up, crawling so he could see Harry. Harry was on his floor, blood dripping from his temple. His glasses were shattered and his shirt was in scraps, but he appeared fine. Jason was nowhere to be found.
“Riddikulus!” Ron’s hair and freckles turned green, and his words all turned to gibberish. The more he tried to talk, the more the laughter in the room increased. The boggart grew more hysterical and dove back into the cabinet.
“I don’t want to run into Jason. He works at three Broomsticks,” Draco dropped Harry’s arm quickly, looking over the top of Harry’s arm in mild alarm
“I need to borrow Mister Malfoy,” She said, and Draco got up gracefully and followed her out of the kitchen, leaving Harry alone. He sighed and stood, dusting off his pants and shirt.
“Like if I would have shaken your hand all those years ago,” Harry grinned cheekily when Draco rolled his eyes.
“You don’t know that for sure though, plus it would be in your best interests to get some sunlight, you vampire,” Harry finally found the shirt he was looking for and put it on.
Harry had to let himself be dragged out of the pub because Draco insisted “No, I’m not going to buy the entire stock of chocolate frogs, I just like Honeydukes,”
“And here I was thinking you’d go pick a fight with him,” Harry snorted a laugh.
Hagrid ended up retiring earlier than he was scheduled to, due to an injury from a creature Hagrid wouldn’t name, although Harry was fairly certain it was something illegal. Charlie officially joined Hogwarts staff after Christmas, and Harry really couldn’t be happier for him.
“Have you heard that from my sixth years?”
“I can’t believe you actually convinced me to come here. This place is tacky,” Draco commented and Harry smacked his arm.
“Good! Five points to Hufflepuff. There’s no specific wand movement, so once you know the word ‘riddikulus’ you know the spell,” Several students muttered the word to themselves. The cabinet containing the boggart rattled violently, tipping over. Harry barely managed to levitate the cabinet before it crashed on the ground. He righted it and placed a steadying charm on it.
“I think Hermione has that spot reserved. McGonagall said she wanted her to take over the position of headmistress,” Ginny sounded cautious, gauging how Draco regarded her as she spoke.
“What’s the matter with you?”
“Tiring. Six classes, four of them back to back,” Harry gave him a sympathetic look. “My third years were talking about Boggarts though, is that what you did?”
“We just have to figure it out quickly, the students get here in five days and lessons start the day after that,” Draco grabbed the books about Merlin and set off to return them from where they had come from. Hermione wandered off to the restricted section.
“The entrance to your dorm is the painting of a field of crups,” She turned to Draco, “And the entrance to yours is the painting of three lads sharing a butterbeer. They are located in the hall next to the one that leads to Gryffindor tower,” Harry nodded while Draco grumbled something that sounded mysteriously like ‘bloody Gryffindor common room’.
“Fine, I s’pose,” Harry mumbled and Draco raised an eyebrow, an expression of ‘Is that so?’ etched on his face.
“I think it would be a nice surprise for your mum,” Harry said, half-heartedly glaring at Dracos back. `
“The bloody hell just happened?” Harry met his eyes, trying to gauge if Draco was upset. His eyes were wide, and that was the only thing Harry could focus on.
“He’s annoying as hell,” Harry said, and Draco snorted. “Like, seriously,  you’re twelve, now shut up and do your work,” Draco had stopped cleaning and mimicked Harry, sitting back on his heels.
Of course, Harry was in the shower when Draco arrived. Draco knocked on the door to let Harry know he was there, a system they had established earlier. The water shut off right as Draco finished brushing his teeth, and Harry stepped out wearing pajama pants and a towel slung over his shoulder. That was definitely new and unexpected, but very much appreciated.
“This is definitely not stressful at all,” Draco muttered. He had owled Hermione as soon as Harry had the seizure, and she had arrived at Hogwarts within the hour. Draco wasn’t sure how she had convinced the Headmistress to let her stay, but he was relieved. Draco put up the last book and headed off to find any books helpful in destroying cursed objects. Almost half an hour later, he returned to their table and plopped the stack of books he had gathered next to Hermione.
“I did,” Harry rolled his eyes. “But, in my defense, I was like fourteen and-” Draco stopped his sentence abruptly and Harry glanced at him curiously.
“Will you be around here a lot?” Harry sipped his butterbeer before answering.
“And why on Earth would you do that?” Harry shrugged and tossed the towel on a drying rack.
Harry used the opportunity to sneak away and head to his dorm
“You can barely go two days without all the attention,” Hermione teased, even though Harry couldn’t miss the relieved glint in her eyes.
“Shut up,”
“Professor, what’s Amortentia smell like to you?” Harry looked at the girl in surprise, noticing her clutching a small vial of liquid close to her chest.
“That has got to be the fastest I’ve ever seen him fall asleep,” Draco said as Harry eased into his chair, watching Teddy for any signs of him waking up.
“It’s not bad, and we won’t be there too long you big baby,” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and apparated them again. Draco immediately stopped complaining when he smelled the baked goods. Harry found Narcissa’s biscuits quickly, and found his own after that. Draco had wandered off to the chocolates section.
“Can you tell us the story about the green dragon?” A timid voice in the back of the house-elf crowd asked. Draco looked for the source, trying to hide a blush.
“Fourteen. They’re brewing skele-gro for Poppy and I need them in pairs so they don’t screw it up as bad as they usually do,” Harry nearly choked on his drink, and Draco couldn’t help laughing.
“Ugh, that’s so boring,” Harry grumbled. “I hate grading essays,”
“You are such a Slytherin-” Draco started, then cut himself off, face growing an even deeper shade of red.
Harry took the plate to the library, he knew without a doubt that Hermione would be there. He found her and Draco nearly hidden behind a mountain of books. Hermione appeared to be working while Draco was hunched over the table, asleep.
“Harry? Where’d you disappear off to yesterday?” Slughorn was hovering in Harry’s doorway, something he’d picked up on doing since the first day.
“Why wouldn’t you want to go?”
“My mum gave him a book when he came over for tea about dark arts,” He whispered, eyes wide.
“Do you want to go back to the castle or stay out here?” Draco pretended to consider, pulling Harry close to him.
“Now, Grindylows are incredibly rare, as I’m sure you’ve learned from Professor Weasley and-”
“I heard that, Draco,” McGonagall said from Draco’s right. Both boys erupted in laughter again and McGonagall ultimately failed in concealing a smile.
He picked out some black jeans, remembering advice Hermione and Ginny had told him ages ago. ‘You can never go wrong with black pants unless you’re wearing a black shirt. And even then, it’s hard to mess up.’ Not knowing where to go from there, Harry headed over to the t-shirts and picked out a deep green one, ignoring the irony. He grabbed a black denim jacket he had seen in the window and took his stuff to the counter. The cashier gave him a knowing look but didn’t say anything about it.
“McGonagall’s been asking about you,” Harry said, meeting Draco’s grey eyes for the first time.
“I’m sure you know that my annual Hallow’s eve party is coming up in a few weeks,” Slughorn finally said after a stretch of silence.
“I’m bored,” Harry said. Draco smirked and set down whatever he had been holding.
“We are on good terms now,” Harry said, and McGonagall smiled. “He’s not half as bad now,” Harry joked, and neither of them could hold back a small chuckle.
“See ya around, Draco,” Harry said just before the door swung closed. He barely caught a flash of a smile.
“How can Miss Stormi help Mister Harry Potter?” the house-elf asked in a squeaky voice, her hands clasped behind her back.
“You started screaming and you froze up. Your magic was freaking out, I couldn’t even touch you until you passed out,” Draco was still staring at Harry's face in the mirror.
“No, I didn’t. It was dark and I was slightly more focused on not getting killed,” Harry said, knowing Slughorn would chuckle and say something along the lines of “that’s ‘m boy,”
Large groups of students began migrating across the Great Hall, some leaving, others finding their friends from other houses and joining them.
“Well, boggarts live in dark, closed spaces and they take the forms of a person’s worst fear. However, they can be banished with a very simple spell,”
“What time does that match start?” Harry asked as the portrait door swung closed behind him.
“Then I’ll start with the desk,” Harry nodded and watched Draco upright the desk and begin repairing everything that had broken around it. After a few minutes, Harry stood and began collecting papers off the floor.
“Did he? I’ll have to check that out,”
There was noise on Draco’s side of the bathroom and Harry desperately wanted his company but Harry couldn’t find the motivation to get out of his chair. He knew he scattered papers and upturned furniture in his room should be his first priority, but despite his brain yelling at him to get up, he couldn’t move. The bathroom door opened slowly and Draco walked in once he saw Harry was awake.
“Oh Merlin, you didn’t cast it, did you?”
After deciding he wanted a treacle fudge, Harry returned to the chocolate section only to find Draco staring at a random spot on the shelf, looking like he was trying to keep his temper.
“This is Jason,” Harry said, not bothering to hide his annoyance. “He’s the one I went on the date with,”
“If anyone can pull off that shit, it’s Granger,” Draco said, casually leaning back in his chair. He pretended not to notice the half-smile from all three of his companions. He ordered a drink.
She smirked. “Well, when
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?” He asked innocently.
“Ah, Potter. You know, when Draco told me you guys were shagging, I wasn’t all that surprised, but when he told me you guys were
“Because you never do your homework.” Hermione said, rolling her eyes and taking his hand in hers.
Harry didn’t turn around. “You should, too.”
Draco smiled. “I can handle it, Harry. I shared a house with him for a year.” Draco looked at the ground, not meeting Harry’s gaze.
have. This is your final warning.”
“And why can it not come off
Draco smiled in gratitude and they continued to walk in comfortable silence.
“Hey, sweetie. It seems as though we’re the talk of the town.”
“What can I get for you?” Harry asked as he made his way behind the counter, but he already knew the answer. He just wanted to hear Draco say it.
“Oh, come on, Blaise. How many fantasies have
to split up the Sacred 28. I don’t care how. Just… make it not a thing anymore.”
“So, I can’t have used Legilimency.”
Harry rolled over Draco until he could reach his alarm and sighed in relief at the silence that followed.
Harry could barely focus on what Malfoy was saying, because his head was spinning. The bastard had kissed him.
Draco gripped Harry’s hand tighter, trying to hold back a snort, and Harry held back a smile. “I’m terribly sorry. I wouldn’t normally ask, but that charm will show some rather… private things, and I’d like it if you could erase the footage from today? I don’t think you’d want to see what’s on there, anyway.” He smiled sweetly.
Malfoy looked down at the table. “You mean, you thought
“Why didn’t you take her to the ball?” Harry asked, glad to be distracted from the tattoo for a few moments.
She nodded enthusiastically. “Take all the time you need. Just let me know how it goes.”
“Like we said, you need to go get him, Harry.”
Harry was exhausted. He had been sharing communal areas with the Slytherins for seven long days and he was
He turned to face her and saw that her expression was serious. “Nothing.” He said, although he knew he couldn’t lie to them for much longer.
But, he loved them even more when they came back from their classes, their hands full of pastries they had stolen from the kitchens.
it wasn’t his fault. But that didn’t fix anything. Nothing could fix this.
Hermione sighed. “I suppose you’re right. But, the Slytherins? Really?”
Harry had learnt to eat fast when he was a child, but now his friends were learning to do the same. If the noise started back up again, everyone had approximately five minutes to finish their food before they were sent up to their dorms again. Even McGonagall couldn’t get a handle on it.
.” He spread out his arms as though to prove his point. “It’s luxurious. You’ll have to teach me that charm.”
They lay for a few minutes in silence as they both woke up slowly. Begrudgingly, Harry pulled himself out of bed, then had to pull Draco out of bed, as well, when Draco had said, “Five more minutes”.
Malfoy unlinked their arms and placed his hand on the small of Harry’s back. Harry allowed himself to be led by Malfoy’s sturdy touch to a small private booth.
“Well, okay, don’t laugh. Please?”
“As if you wear pyjamas, Draco.” Pansy said, her tone bored, but Harry found this information anything but boring. In fact, he tried to tell himself it was boring, but his brain seemed to be very sure that it
They stared at each other for a moment.
I hope you enjoyed!! I'm sorry, I feel like this fic was quite rushed - the truth is, I've been rushing through as many of my WIPs as possible so I can start on a long fic I have planned! <3
“Merlin, don’t worry, I can’t.” Draco breathed, his smile taking up half of his face.
Hermione’s voice was quiet by this point and everyone leaned in to hear her better.
McGonagall shook her head and breathed in deeply. “If this
Hermione couldn’t contain her smile. “I told him I didn’t want to stay home, and he told me that he had been wanting to take care of the baby anyway. He had already written up his notice for work. He’s so excited.”
Ginny shifted slightly in her seat, but Ron nudged her and said, “Go on, Gin. It’ll be fun!”, and she nodded reluctantly.
“Sort of. It keeps the nightmares away.” Draco relaxed down onto the bed slightly, shimmying until he was fully lying down.
Draco nodded. “It’ll be a tough one.” His mouth turned up into a small smile. “At least you’ll be with your family.”
They sat for a while, only talking about happy things, about their friends. When it was time for class, Harry felt calm, and extremely grateful for Draco.
He lowered his voice so only Harry could hear. “I guess it’s showtime. Are you ready?”
That was when Harry had woken up. He woke up still seeing Malfoy’s eyes. Far away, but clear. It was terrifying and exciting all at once, and Harry was cursing himself yet again for choosing to go to class today, because he could still see Malfoy’s eyes in his mind.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy’s smirk. He supposed being famous wasn’t all that bad. After all, the news of their newfound ‘friendship’ would be all across Wizarding Britain by tomorrow.
“Oh, nothing.” Their voice was chirpy, almost
Harry laughed. He really had missed Draco’s voice. “My time away from you has been tragic.” Harry said, decidedly not thinking about the fact that it
“Holy shit, Potter, this is amazing!” Harry tried not to think about the fact that he had never heard Malfoy swear before, and adamantly ignored the fact that those words sounded so good in his posh accent. Instead, he focused on Malfoy’s grin. “Is this on the menu?”
They chuckled as they made their way from table to table. “You keep the place open for him.”
Everyone’s eyes widened.
?” Seamus asked, his eyes narrowing.
Seamus had just finished talking about the job he had lined up for summer - apparently being an active part of the war was good work experience for… well, every job available in the wizarding world - and finished his story with a loud, “Let’s hope they don’t fire me! I’d like to last longer than a week!”
He waited for a while, wondering what was taking him so long. Draco was never late. He was always early. He stood up and began to pace.
Draco laughed. Harry wanted to live in the feeling of it. He was silent for a few moments before he spoke again, his voice steady but quiet. “I hope you know I’ve forgiven you.”
She rolled her eyes. “I just heard you make another one of your deals with Tracey.” She walked towards him, and Harry resisted the urge to back away. “Although I have no clue why you’d choose
Harry looked down at the scars he had left on Draco’s chest. “Because we’re the same. And to get better, we’ll have to trust that the other can get better."
public with him.
. He passed the bottle to Draco and he took a sip, a smile still on his lips.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He wanted to hang up or scream at Draco or cry. “Oh.” He said, unsure of what to do next. “Okay. Yeah. If you want to.”
Draco was the first to speak, clearing his throat before talking. “Is… is that a real story?”
space.
Hermione’s voice snapped Harry out of his daydream. They were sitting in the library, where she was trying to help Harry with his Potions homework. In actuality, he had long since given up and was instead keeping her company as she studied.
“Oh.” Harry said, frowning slightly. “So, you were asleep, too?”
Pansy smirked at that.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Where’d you hear that from? Draco’s bed?”
Draco led Harry towards his bed. It was a single bed, of course, but Harry didn’t care. Because, Draco held him close, and he let his fingers run through Harry’s hair, and Harry found himself crying more because of it.
“Hey.” He said, his eyes focused on the glittering hall surrounding them.
Draco laughed. “Yeah, it’s all a bit extreme, but I’d rather not see you dead, Harry.”
Harry awoke slowly, his eyes opening heavily until he could make out the shapes of his room that were shrouded in darkness. He blinked groggily a few times before reaching for his wand to cast a tempus, but quickly realised he was being weighed down. He looked down at Draco, who was half laying on top of him, and was still sleeping peacefully. Harry sighed and decided that he could find out the time later; he didn’t want to disturb Draco.
Harry felt Draco inhale sharply, and he seemed to move closer to Harry, closing the distance between them, and resting his arm against Harry’s. He stayed like that, the warmth a gentle assurance for both of them.
Hermione’s outburst left Harry shocked and unable to speak for a moment. “Oh my god.” He said slowly, goosebumps rising on his arms. “He wants me.”
“What an astute observation.” Draco’s smile was apparent in his voice. “You know, I’m educated in both muggle and wizarding literature. That’s just common sense. Even when I lived with my father, I would still read the muggle classics.”
Hermione sighed. “Yeah, we did say that.”
Draco started laughing. “Harry, you have to tell me what happened.”
Harry’s heart melted. “Draco…” He wanted to do something - to sit next to Draco and tell him he would be okay.
“They love you so much. It’s nice to see.”
Sam smiled. “I knew it. It’s a fake story, right?”
Malfoy had been telling Harry stories about his summer in France spent with Pansy and Blaise. He was a good storyteller, Harry thought. He added a dramatic touch to his stories that left Harry wheezing, and he told every little detail as though it was the most important part, running his sentences together until he’d almost forgotten what he was originally saying. He had already heard about Malfoy’s time spent at the nude beaches, where he found himself burnt in the most painful places possible, as well as his dinner with a most respectable French pureblood wizard who insisted on Malfoy staying the night and kept on trying to get into the guest bed with him (Harry almost pissed himself at that one - Malfoy’s French accent was spot on), as well as about ten other stories, each of which Harry loved as much as the last. Malfoy was currently talking about one of his nights out with Pansy and Blaise, and Harry was intently listening, his hand propping up his head as he leaned in to Malfoy to ensure he heard every part.
Harry visited for a week, and he spent the majority of it with Ron, Hermione and baby Rose. He laughed with them, stayed up until the early hours of the morning to take care of the baby with them, and eventually cried with them when Rose refused to stop screaming. Of course, he also checked up on Sam in the cafe, finding it to be busier than ever. Luckily for Harry, that didn’t stop Sam from sitting down with him, at he and Draco’s table, and catching up on what they had missed in each other’s lives. It was wonderful. But, what was even more wonderful was knowing what he would be returning to in France.
Ron stood next to Hermione. “When you’re feeling up to it, some of the Slytherins are downstairs.”
He felt dozens of glares on him and he wanted to wrap this conversation up fairly quickly. Just because he had no issue with the Slytherins didn’t mean the Slytherins had no issues with him. He was currently standing in the Slytherin common room, a place where he was most certainly not welcome, and he felt as though he was about to be hexed or punched rather hard. When he had walked in, everyone looked at him as though he were mad, and he was almost hexed into oblivion when he had told them that he had found out the password from Theodore Nott in exchange for another favour.
Whilst writing this, I realised that we never actually see Hermione receiving a Weasley jumper, which I thought was crazy!
“Hey.” Draco said, forcing a smile. Harry didn’t know if he was performing yet, or if he really just couldn’t bring himself to smile.
“However,” McGonagall’s voice grew louder, just slightly, “it
“It’s okay. Later.” He turned his head back to a more comfortable position. When he spoke again, his voice was quiet and muffled. “I’m much too tired for forgiveness right now, Harry. Would you be satisfied with a half-arsed ‘goodnight’?”
Harry’s heart stopped for a moment and his breath quickened. He nodded and whispered back, “I want to let him sleep for a bit more. Can you leave it on the desk?”
Draco squeezed him even tighter. “You did it, Harry. This is the best present you could ever get me. You can’t top this one.”
Harry groaned. “But the bed is so comfy.”
“Let me run with you.” Harry said, his voice firm.
And Harry didn’t know how to react.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. But, surely I didn’t go searching through his mind for it.”
The song ended and Harry breathed a sigh of relief as Malfoy let go of him.
“Okay, in the spirit of inter-house unity,” Draco flashed Harry a smile and Harry rolled his eyes, “We’re playing a muggle game tonight.” Draco grinned as he placed a vial on the table in the centre of the room. “But with a wizarding twist.” Harry frowned. Surely, that wasn’t - “This is Veritaserum. We’re playing Truth or Dare.”
They each shook his hand with wary politeness, smiling at the other people in the room as they did so. Bill and Fleur were already sitting in one of the armchairs (both of them had small smiles on their faces, which Harry was endlessly grateful for), and Percy was sitting on the sofa beside them. Percy wasn’t smiling at the Slytherins, but Harry knew that he rarely smiled anyway, and took his neutral expression as a good sign.
After a few moments, the room erupted in murmurs, and Harry pulled away just slightly, keeping his forehead against Draco’s.
“No questions asked.” She said, looking around the room nervously.
"Where are your parents, Hermione?" Harry had asked her as he watched his breath form a cloud in the cold air.
Looking up from his food, he was met with Hermione’s furrowed brows and Ron’s rushed stress-eating.
Pansy rolled her eyes, and gave him one last hit for good measure. “Oh, yeah? Did you get him a thong, too?”
“He’s not here yet.” Hermione said.
She sighed. “You two are idiots.” She looked between the two of them before she spoke again. “Occlumency only protects you from the people you don’t
be finding a replacement for your job. After all, I did it with the last Minister.”
Once inside the castle, Harry and Draco sat down at the Gryffindor table. Harry thought this was rather unnecessary, as it would have been perfectly reasonable for Draco to sit with the Slytherins. They listened to McGonagall give her back-to-school speech and Harry thought about the unfairness of the situation. He had finally,
“Do your friends know that we’re back together?” Harry asked.
Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny had said goodbye to the rest of their friends as they left the train station and made their way to the Burrow, none of them commenting on how, even through all of the noise of the Weasley family, the house would be quiet and still without Fred.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, and Harry shook his head against his chest. “That’s alright.”
“No, you don’t understand. I protected you at the Manor so that I wouldn’t have to deal with Voldemort anymore. It was selfish.”
Harry turned to him, excitement filling him. “I’m getting Narcissa’s assets back. And I’m getting Draco back, too.”
Mid-laugh, Malfoy spoke again. “Listen, I don’t usually talk about it. But, I’ll talk about it with you.”
“Ugh, get a room.” Blaise said, tying his tie effortlessly as he spoke, though his voice held no malice.
Harry nodded slightly. "Whatever you're comfortable with."
“No questions asked.” Harry nodded.
“Are… Are you alright, Hermione?”
Ron nodded. “Of course. She’s meeting with him on the day after Christmas.”
“I swear to Merlin, if you two don’t shut the fuck up, I’m kicking you out.” Draco said, looking directly at Harry and Pansy, who both responded with a snort and a “sorry”. Draco continued speaking. “Everyone pair up.”
“We have to be back to the castle before dinner according to McGonagall. Did you hear her mention having a meeting?”
“That’d be because I was her favorite student,” Draco said with a half-smile, earning a snort of laughter from both Harry and Ginny.
“Well, I couldn’t help myself since he holds such a high opinion of me-” Draco teased.
“Would you rather just worry about it in the morning?” Draco could see the exhaustion on Harry’s face and body. Harry nodded and Draco walked out of the room and closed the door behind him. Once Draco left, Harry tossed his glasses on the nightstand and flopped into his bed. He didn’t understand how Draco’s presence was so calming and almost warm. Harry rolled over, wrapping his blanket around him. He’d deal with everything in the morning.
“But I would like to,” Stormi insisted, grabbing a plate down from a shelf. “If you don’t tell me what you’d like to eat, I will have to make you a plate based on general favorites,” Harry didn’t reply for a moment, surprised at how educated she sounded compared to the other house-elves he’d had conversations with. She took his silence as permission and started filling the plate with pastries, biscuits and a variety of fruits. She handed the plate to him and he accepted it gratefully.
“Goodnight, Draco”
“I wanted to read the book first,” Harry said and Hermione laughed.
“My next class starts soon. I’ll see you at lunch,” Harry kissed Draco, then headed back to his own classroom so he could prepare himself for a repeat of the Unforgivables lecture.
“Merlin’s ‘Magica Captionem’ seizures came in a set of three, and he reported his power growing each time, but he delved deeper into madness with each passing day. He claims the cause of the seizures was a cursed book given to him by his eventual husband’s mother,”
“McArthur was decent. He’ll be easy enough to replace. Hell, Ginny was a better chaser than him,”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. He grabbed Draco’s hand and apparated them both to the entrance of Hog’s Head. Draco opened the door and they both walked in, neither of them saying anything until they were seated.
He got up and headed for his dorm. Trying to think about Harry right now was just making him tired. Plus, what Hermione had said about the book was making his brain hurt. Once Draco reached his portrait, he could hear arguing on the other side of it. He hurried in, but his dorm was empty. He curiously walked towards Harry’s side, where he saw two figures yelling. Harry was one of them, and he didn’t recognize the other guy.
“She has a serious gambling problem,” Harry said, watching Draco fake-pout dramatically.
“Oh please, call me Minerva,” Harry laughed and nodded, but he didn’t see himself breaking a habit of seven years any time soon. “Once Mr. Malfoy arrives, we can begin the formalities part of the meeting,” she had a twinkle in her eye as she spoke.
“What happened?” Harry asked quietly.
“And what do you propose you do about that?” Harry shrugged.
“Well, yeah, but that was almost two weeks ago. Plus there’s only one place I can get them and I need more for my personal stash,” Harry argued.
“What the hell happened in here?” She asked, finally breaking the silence. Harry and Draco shared a look.
“St. Mungos. We work together,” Draco nodded in Trina’s general direction.
“Does it say anything about how long he owned the book before the seizures started?” Draco asked when Hermione looked at him. She shook her head.
“Does it work on animals too?” Harry paused at the question, thinking for a moment.
“Shit,” He whispered as soon as he closed the door behind him. “Shit, shit, shit,” He plopped into his desk and ran his hands through his hair. Draco grabbed a quill and parchment and started a letter to his mother. Well, he tried to. For some reason, he couldn’t get Harry off his mind.
“You’re in my classroom,” Harry replied. He tossed the vial to him, knowing he wouldn't let perfectly brewed potion go to waste.
“I haven’t been to Hogsmeade since sixth year. I’m not welcome there,” Harry finally turned his attention to the blonde, who looked slightly embarrassed.
Draco knew instantly he’d never get used to this, feeling Harry’s lips on his own sent his mind whirling crazily. Nothing Draco had ever known felt this natural, this right. When they finally pulled away for breath, both of them grinning childishly, Draco met Harry’s wide green eyes again.
“No, it’s not,”  Draco crossed his arms over his chest, watching Harry’s confusion in amusement.
“You’re as white as a ghost,”
“Had to make green the good guys huh?”
“That’s awesome, mate!” Ron nearly shouted while Hermione smiled warmly at the two friends sitting across from her.
“I have no clue. I couldn’t let go of it,” Harry loosed a shaky breath. He ran a hand through his hair and tried to smile reassuringly at Draco. “I’m fine now,”
“Almost noon,” Harry replied, brushing the hair out of Draco’s eyes. “And I actually thought you’d be an early bird,”
“You’re just everywhere, aren’t you?” Draco asked, glancing away when one of the elves nudged him with a full plate. He accepted it with a quiet “Thank you.” Harry only shrugged innocently and ate another strawberry.
“Well…” Harry smelled it again, fighting off a blush. “It smells like wood, chocolate, and mint,” He glanced at Draco, then screwed the lid on the vial, extending it to Draco.
“I don’t-” Pomfrey interrupted him.
“Wait, where do you work?” Ginny looked baffled, glancing at Trina, then back at Draco.
“Are you just saying that? Cause you’re welcome anywhere you’d like to go,” Harry glanced at his bed, then back to his clothes. Draco pretended not to notice.
Jason saw Draco finally succeed in standing, and sent Harry’s desk flying at him. Draco yelped when the desk hit his leg. His leg instantly buckled under him, and he knew it was broken.
“Bastard,”
“Okay, whatever. We were wondering about the requirements for casting a Patronus,”
“Have you seen your face?” Draco blurted, staring.
“Not your fault she’s a snoop,” Draco said quietly. “Don’t worry about it, if she does publish an article, it’ll be based on her imagination,” Harry snickered.
“Let’s head to my place. I’ve got a few bottles over there and there won’t be any drunken bar fights,” Harry quickly agreed, followed Jason out the door and to the cool, empty streets of London. Stars and lights alike twinkled overhead, and Harry felt at peace.
“When I give Harry a book, it usually stays in his trunk until he eventually forgets it, but I have a feeling that that’s not the case here,” Draco nodded blankly.
“I’ve heard of it, and it’s commonly associated with cursed objects,” Hermione replied. Ron stayed quiet.
“Can we not just burn it?” Draco asked after he had finished reading the warning. Hermione shrugged.
“Expecto Patronum!” He pointed his wand forward, watching in pride as a stag the size of a car galloped around the classroom, and out the door. “Now, we’re gonna have to sit down and do some book research,”
“How many house points did you take from that Alex Raas kid for swearing?” Draco asked, laughing at Harry’s dramatic reaction.
“I have no idea what you’re referring to,” Draco speared another apple slice and bit it off his fork while Harry laughed.
“Two hours,” Draco said. Narcissa’s brow furrowed, then she shrugged, which surprised Harry because it was such a casual movement.
“I was getting chocolates. My sixth years are learning about dementors and patronuses soon,” McGonagall sighed to herself, taking off her glasses and rubbing the bridge of her nose.
“The eighth years that went back are very close now, Ron,” Hermione said gently, grabbing one of his hands to relax him.  “There weren’t very many of us, and we all agreed that the past is past and there’s nothing we could do except apologize and move on,” Harry nodded his agreement and Ron sighed. He rubbed his eyes tiredly.
Harry glanced around her shoulder, glad to see that Draco had vanished. Skeeter had paled and her notebook and quill had made their way back into her purse.
“A stag. Like my dad’s,”
“Might be a bit too late for that,” He pointed over Harry’s shoulder, and Harry whipped around to see the man in question storming towards them.
Harry got up, leaving a few galleons on the table alongside the small pile left by Hermione and Ron, and headed off into the crowd. Several people turned as he passed, but he only flashed a small smile and continued on his way to the entrance to muggle London, which he found was much quieter and much less confining.
“Well, never would've guessed you’re the one with a sweet tooth,” Harry joined Draco looking at the expansive chocolate display.
“But, dying is quicker and easier than falling asleep. Are there any other questions?”
“Sod off,” Draco replied as they walked in, the bell tinkling daintily overhead. Draco immediately headed for the chocolate section while Harry wandered around the store, picking up various candies and cakes.
“Oh, come on! This is like that book in sixth year!” Hermione exclaimed. Both Harry and Draco went silent. “And we all know how that turned out,” She gestured at Draco, who shifted in his seat.
“Well, either way, it’s causing issues for you so we have to destroy it now,” Daco said after Hermione had finished laughing.
“There are many bad people out there, Mister Harry. House-elves are kidnapped all the time and made to work in conditions much worse than this one,” The kitchen door swung open and another elf walked in, ears twitching. Draco walked in behind the elf, and several other elves swarmed around his feet, chattering excitedly. He greeted them all by name, faltering only when he saw Harry there too.
“If you say so,” Harry replied, closing his eyes. “What time is it?”
“She shouldn’t bother us for a while, at least,” Harry said bitterly. “I’m sorry I dragged you out here and that happened,”
Harry’s attention was drawn to the window, where his new owl was perched on the windowsill, holding a copy of the daily prophet. He wasn’t sure why he was subscribed, but sometimes it was funny to see Rita Skeeter try to get her fanbase back by publishing ridiculous articles. But nothing could prepare Harry for what the headline for today read.
As soon as she was out of sight, Draco loosed a shaky breath. He’d done research and homework with Hermione many times, but none of them were about something this serious, plus Harry was in danger.
“Okay, let’s start off with this- who here has heard of a boggart?” Several hands shot into the air, but a notable amount stayed down.
“Well, everything in your mind just gets really quiet, except for one single, strange voice that isn’t your own telling you what to do. And you just want to listen to that peaceful voice and do whatever it tells you, no matter how little sense it makes to you,”
“Mind if I chat for a while? I’ve been bored all day,” Harry glanced around the restaurant, which was more empty than Harry initially realized.
“I wasn’t the one to actually heal, I was the one that caused the injury.” The atmosphere in the room changed from mildly bored to suddenly intrigued.
“I just finished setting up my classroom and I started wandering around aimlessly,” He wasn’t really lying, but the waiter got a spark in his eyes.
“We’d be glad to,” Draco said smoothly, tucking his hand in his back pocket. McGonagall smiled proudly.
“Er, well,” Harry drummed his fingers on the table. A loud crash to his right drew their attention to two men getting close to a full-on fistfight. Workers and other members of the bar had crowded around, trying to record them or break them apart. Jason looked at Harry, seeming a bit uncomfortable at the ruckus.
“When?” Harry asked. He was acutely aware of Draco looking at him.
Harry heard Draco moving about in his room, even though both of their connecting doors were closed. He was tempted to go over there to talk to him, but he was rather comfortable in his chair. Besides, Draco wandered over here all the time, he’ll do it again eventually. As predicted, Draco wandered in minutes later with two steaming mugs of tea.
“I know I can’t forbid you from leaving the castle, but don’t be reckless like that. You gave everyone a scare, myself included,”
“Ron was saying how I betrayed him and all the Weasley’s and stuff like that.” Harry tried to sound indifferent, and he was proud that his voice didn’t waver or crack.

VIVALAPLUTO: 20 galleons it will be Pansy
PatsthePan: im dead now
The maid… err… man of honor, Ron Weasley, stood next to Teddy, looking far more nervous than he should.
Theotherspinnet: did that just happen?
He blushed redder. "Shut up William."
This time, the response was clear. "Yeah and I'm Britney Spears what's new?"
Juan: so if its not a poodle what is it
Pork: but we do learn about them right?
Teddy grinned devilishly. "I'll do better than ask. I'm gonna prank him back."
Prada: liar
FordAngliaPotter: 10 galleons theyre gonna ask Hermione next
McDonald: hey
"Yes." Draco replies. He calmly takes a sip from his hot cocoa. "I believe he reffered to the whole ordeal as a 'bit of fun' to spice up his boring life."

His godfather had uncovered his dad's old wedding robes. They were a sage colour that brought out his eyes, with golden embellishments around the edges.
Pork: to talk about our boyfriends? Hello?
Theotherspinnet: fine
Wallahi: you arent allowed to answer
Moldywart: off topic but us pixie juice made OF or BY pixies cux im vegetarian and I think pixies would come under the meat category
Victory: nope
BritneyBitch: your son peed on my carpet
Teddy smirked and pointed at Wahim, who was apparently having a serious conversation with one of the goblins in attendance. A pink blush spread across Poppy's cheeks.
Teddy felt rather important, handing the ring to Harry.
"Another word, William MacDougal and I will mark you absent and inform your mother."
TJ: it was a romantic moment fuck you

Professor Malfoy is in the kitchen, stirring a cup of hot cocoa. "Exellent question. But pray, why waste all that magic when you can simply petrify whoever it is you're so keen on making inanimate?"
Billybutton: :(
PerseusWeasley: its funny
BeTrAyaL: just like that
Almost all of Harry's magical friends had come to attend, starting from the smallest bowtruckles to a rather teary Norwegian Ridgeback dragon and her pup. Hagrid stood by them, giving the bay dragon little treats.
Pork: it was mums fault. She wanted to get her nails done.
T.Lupin: fine
"You guys are hugging without me? Not fair!" came Draco's voice.
Moldywarts: idk… living with him????

It lasted a second, before Harry grabbed his husband and pulled him in for another, deeper one.
TJ: may the virius protecc you from teddys wrath
BeTrAyaL: that’s how she expresses… what can I say, affection
Harry smiles. "Of course I do, silly." He opens his arms wide. "Come here, Tedward."
Theotherspinnet: this has more chemistry than Wahim+Anastasia
PotsthePan: ofc u can luna :)
Moldywarts: youre supposed to be dead
Draco looked royally flustered in his blue robes, the silvery designs swirling every time he moved.

A disjointed voice answers from somewhere. Professor Malfoy nods. "If you guys can hear me, please write a message. I need to mark your attendance." His face is a bit close to the screen, but otherwise he's doing pretty good for his first time.
BeTrAyaL: I thnk im gonna puke
Professor Malfoy raises a brow. "Thank you Mr Jefferson. The same warning applies to you."
TJ: thanks
But it was the softest of drizzles. Tiny pitter patters that couldn't soak an ant.
"Sorry Ted." He doesn’t sound sorry at all.
Victory: nope
Mr Malfoy's face turned a bright, Gryffindor red. "Back to attendance."
Wallahi: and I need a detailed account
McDonald: TEDDYS NOT JOINING IN CAUSE HE LIVES WITH PROF MALFOY. TEDDY HAS THE TEA
PotsthePan: wait really???
McDonald: does anyone want to hear my suggestion?
Teddy pulls into the hug, not caring if Harry squeezed him to death.
"Yes, Poppy." He deadpans. "If anyone were to cast the killing curse on you it would result in you having a very much magical corpse. That is what we will cover in the Asphodelius Law next term."
McDonald: TJ and I would be happy to join you
Victory: side eyes

Despacito: you are tho poppy
McDonald: me too
"How does it feel to be a married man?" Teddy asks his godfather later that day. Harry was busy trying to steer Draco away from the bowls of pixie juice.
"Okay but why would you transfer so much of your precious magic to someone else when you could do the same thing with a lot less magic?"

Despite Draco's prior reluctance, Harry managed to convince him to let all their students attend. The look on TJ and Will's faces was worth it, really.
Moldywart: ikr

Then comes Ginny and Luna. Neville and then Blaise. Victoire, Dominique, Fleur, Louis and all the other Weasleys. Poppy and her parents. And then the rest of their friends join in.

McDonald: nowhere that demands formalwear pls

"You guys don’t mind if I go grab a snack right? This is more entertaining than the time Buckbeak scratched Draco and he pretended to die." A pillow hit professor Potter square on the forehead and he went off frame.

“I’m coming back here later when I actually have muggle money,” Draco said, putting a box back on the shelf. Harry picked it back up.
“Granger, I don’t think-” He abruptly stopped his sentence as the library door swung open and a thick book flew right into Hermione’s lap. She looked at him with a smug smile on her face.
“I see,” Draco said. Before anything else could be said, Draco was sent flying back into the wall. Jason grabbed Harry’s waist and yanked him to the floor, tearing a gash in his t-shirt.
“Oh my god, are you going to marry Harry?”
“The only cursed objects I’ve had to destroy were Horcruxes, and I don’t know if this would be any different,” Draco sighed.
His class watched with great interest as he struggled to find a better explanation, but the boy who’d asked the questions seemed satisfied. Only two more hands were up, Harry told himself that he could handle this.
‘for enemies’.”
“I suppose that starts rather soon doesn’t it?” Draco nodded, finally tearing his eyes away from Harry’s.
“It appears I’ve been spotted,” She said in a false tone of regret.
“What happened this time?” Draco asked the intern, who was splitting her time between filling out paperwork and trying to wrangle Harry onto the hospital bed for an evaluation.
“I’m not really allowed to tell you. It’d cause a whole bunch of issues,” Harry said apologetically and Presely frowned, brows furrowing.
“It’s today,” McGonagall said when Harry failed to come up with an answer. “I will make the changes to the staff roster and inform Gryffindor and Slytherin before the match,” Harry nodded.
“Well? What is it?” Draco and the girl asked at the same time. They glanced at each other and grinned.
Harry walked into the Great Hall and the small crowd of Professors turned to him, most of them smiling broadly at his entrance.
“Almost as unfortunate as this decorating scheme,”
“Did you kill mum?” Draco looked for a reaction, a bit chilled when Lucius only grinned widely.
Finally, the two were walking the all too familiar path to Hogsmeade. The sun shone brightly overhead, drawing many students out of the castle and in various spots across the black lake and courtyard.
“I’ll get Pomfrey to look at it after I have breakfast, okay Princess?” Draco’s face instantly turned red.
“Have you started setting up your classroom?” Harry asked, using the opportunity to watch Draco’s face without being seen as weird.
“Mister Schroeder, what can I help you with?”
“Professor!” Harry smiled, beckoning for the small crowd of students to enter. It was a small group of standout students that often came for extra work that wasn’t in the curriculum.
“Of course ‘m boy,” A knock on the door startled Slughorn so badly he nearly fell off the desk.
“That doesn’t make it any less appealing to look at. Especially since you didn’t want it,” Harry sipped his tea.
“Why did you leave the castle?”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Harry snorted a laugh. “Are we ever going to go to three broomsticks?” Harry stiffened when Draco said that.
“Something the matter?” Harry asked innocently. Draco stood from the chair, sending it spinning wildly. He walked around the desk so he was in front of Harry, who was watching with a racing heart.
“You also hate
“Unfortunately for you guys, I have to lecture about something very boring and I almost fell asleep making the lesson plan, so humor me and at least pretend to be excited about the Unforgivables,” Harry grinned wryly as his class immediately perked up.
“I’m glad you were able to get that job,” Harry said earnestly. “Do you know where you’re gonna start with lessons?” Charlie shrugged, finally swallowing his mouthful of food.
“You’ve been out for a good four days,” Draco said. “You Gryffindors do have a flair for the dramatic,” Harry only offered an indignant. “Shut up, Malfoy,” as a reply. Hermione appeared around the corner of the doorframe, only hesitating a little when she saw his face.
“I’ll only do it if you’ll go to Hogsmeade with me again,” Harry leaned back in his chair, watching Draco’s cheeks turn pink.
“That’s horrible,” Harry said between laughs. Professor Flitwick, sitting on Harry’s other side, looked over at the two.
“It’s not a story I’m particularly fond of,” He said, hoping it would satisfy them but also knowing that it wouldn’t.
“I’d say it started with looks and developed into me just not being able to see myself wanting to be in a relationship with a woman in general,”
When Harry apparated in front of the Malfoy Manor, he could feel in his gut that something was different this time. Not necessarily bad, but something seemed just out of place. He knocked three times and stepped back when a house-elf swung open the door for him. He followed the house-elf into the personal dining room, where Narcissa stood with a pleasant smile on her face.
“She's definitely up to something,” Draco said, just before they reached Draco’s portrait. The three lads in the picture all waved at the two, and the door swung open. Harry only hummed in reply
“Alright, fine. When I was in sixth year I found an old copy of advanced potion-making. There were tons of notes on how to make perfect potions, and the previous owner had even created several of their own spells. I got perfect potions grades with it, and I was completely fascinated with that book, and I found a spell the owner had created that was
“Skeeter, we don’t want to talk to you,” Harry snapped, and she only glanced at him and sent him a falsely-sweet smile.
The room was spinning wildly around Draco, and he tried and failed several times to stand. The only thing Draco could really comprehend was that Harry needed help.
It was several days later when Draco decided he’d had enough of lying around doing nothing. He’d owled Trina earlier, asking her to meet him for a drink. He was surprised when she replied saying she was with Weaslette and Potter, but they’d be willing to let Draco join their group.
“Having a Slytherin hero instead of a Gryffindor hero for once would not have made things worse for us, you bimbo,” Draco replied, halfheartedly rolling his eyes.
“Your sarcasm would make any Slytherin jealous,” Draco said. “I still can’t believe you were almost a Slytherin,”
“Where’d he go?” Harry sat on the edge of his bed.
“I thought Gryffindors wanted everything they could get their hands on,”
“I hope he hasn’t started dragons yet,” Charlie said thoughtfully. “Do you know if he has?” Harry shrugged. Charlie finished his breakfast, then slipped out of the Great Hall. Harry peered through the window and saw him nearly skipping towards the hut through the half-melted sludge.
“I know this bar in muggle London, is that something you’d care for?” Jason asked. “They can get you wasted fast,”
A speckled black and brown owl flew up to Harry, landing on his shoulder with a soft hoot. Harry smiled fondly and broke his fry in half to feed it to the bird. While the owl ate, Harry untied the letter and opened it.
“Where’s the place then? Don’t tell me it’s in muggle London,” Draco sighed when Harry only kept walking towards the Hogsmeade apparation point.  “I haven't been to muggle London in ages, Potter,” Draco caught up to Harry in two long strides.
“When it hits you, it’s like ice,” Harry walked to his desk and leaned on it, arms crossed over his chest. “And your mind instantly knows that something is wrong, but everything is moving so slow, and suddenly you’ve hit the ground and everything’s just dark,” His class watched him with wide eyes, and several students had gone a few shades paler.
Harry knew it was going to be a long class when a large group of Slytherin girls walked in giggling giddily. He knew that these sixth-year Slytherins had potions with Gryffindors right before this class, but he had no idea what happened in Draco’s class that could have set them all in such a good mood. Once the last of his Gryffindor students trickled in, Harry walked to the front of the room to start class.
“Thanks, Filius,” Harry said as soon as he realized he was done talking. A few minutes passed before McGonagall ordered prefects to lead the way to their respective House.
“Can’t be really sure. Antony is supposed to be in here any minute,”
“Let’s move on to nonverbal offensive charms. We’ll start with the blasting curse. Sound good?” He got general hums of agreement. “I still want you guys shielding, but instead of sparks, it’ll be a little bit tougher to hold, and Professor Malfoy and I will be helping,”
“How did you tell your friends?” Harry chuckled fondly at the question.
“I was being followed by Rita Skeeter,” He grumbled into the blanket. Footsteps approached the bed and it sank down a beat later.
“Dammit, I owe her ten galleons,” Draco fished the coins out of his pocket and handed them to the Headmistress.
“Fuck off,” Draco smiled softly. Harry entertained himself by playing with Draco’s hair until he had apparently fallen back asleep. Fifteen minutes came and went, but Harry decided to let Draco sleep. Besides, he was comfortable. They laid there nearly an hour until Draco finally woke up on his own. He rolled onto his back stretching and yawning while Harry watched.
“I actually don’t. However, since I listed off what I smelled in mine, you know exactly how attracted I am to-” Harry stopped his words as soon as he realized he was still talking.
“Shut up,” Draco said between laughs. “Pomfrey could probably heal your neck in a heartbeat,” he said, turning serious again. Harry glanced at it in the mirror and saw a red and purple spot forming at the base of his neck.
“Hermione, go on home and get some sleep,” Harry said. “You look like the dead,” She glared at him but stood anyway.
Harry was proud of how smoothly his classes had been running, and he’d fallen into the rhythm of his schedule quickly after returning from the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey still gave him concerned glances across the staff table at meals, but he couldn’t be bothered.
“Hey ‘Moine,” Harry said, gently wrapping his arms around her.
“Well, it’s something rather personal,” He paused, fidgeting. “How did you figure out that you liked guys?” He blurted, face turning red immediately after. Oh.
His personal bag had only a few books, pictures, and letters he had saved. His favorite picture of his parents soon found its place on his desk, soon accompanied by pictures of him with Ron and Hermione. He watched the pictured for several minutes, fondly remembering the times when they had been taken. He knew he would miss them terribly this year, this being his first time without either of them with him. Harry sighed and set the books down on the desk, then set off to see how his classroom looked.
“I just want another chance,” The stranger pleaded. “I’m a nice guy and it’s not every day-”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said quietly, looking at his palms.
“For some reason, I think you’re bluffing,” Harry shifted in his seat, turning to face Draco more.
“What did it take?”
“Nasty one,” Harry said under his breath. “Along the wall is outlines of a boggart’s shape. Once you have practiced casting the spell, you can cast it against the boggart,” The room filled with the scraping of chairs and quiet conversations as the students split off to practice casting. A few minutes later, Harry called them back to their seats.
“There’s no way that thing is cursed,” Harry protested.
“How was your weekend?” She asked knowingly. Harry sighed and had to fight back a sarcastic eye roll.
“You look as white as a sheet,” Harry said to Draco, who seemed to be intentionally ignoring Harry.
“Two visitors!” Stormi exclaimed happily, indicating Draco to sit on the floor next to her and Harry. Draco obliged, and the small crowd of elves followed him and sat down too.
“Sounds like you had a fun time with him in your class,” Harry flipped him off, earning a smirk.
“Oh, I can grab something myself, you don’t have to worry about helping me,” Harry replied.
“The first thing was the Quidditch pitch,” Draco said quietly. “Then it was treacle tarts and then it was your damned shampoo,” Harry could barely breathe, the air seemed thick.
“So, what brings you to our neck of the woods?” Harry shrugged. He definitely wasn’t staring at the gorgeous face in front of him. His eyes were strikingly blue.
“I could never accept you like this! My mum can’t believe you would betray her like this, I mean falling in love with-”
“No that’s not right,” Harry mumbled to himself. He swore softly when he bumped into a desk as her name popped into his head.  “Stormi,” Harry’s footsteps echoed down the hall, but he found himself in the kitchen quickly. Stormi appeared again, teeming with joy as she brought him a plate piled high with treacle tarts.
“I’m fine, just shaken up,”  Draco glanced at Harry’s neck and raised an eyebrow. Harry sighed. “He did that while I was trying to summon my wand,” Draco blinked but didn’t say anything else on the matter until he was satisfied with his cleaning job of Harry’s arm.
Although Draco seemed to be talking, Harry couldn’t hear anything he was saying. Harry carefully reached out for the book. The book seemed to be calling out to him, and he couldn’t stop himself from grabbing it and opening it gingerly.
“Why wouldn’t you like to leave?” Stormi’s big eyes darkened.
Harry stepped outside, smiling when the sun hit his skin. It was perfect weather outside, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to go back to the castle just yet. Instead, he apparated to a muggle park near the entrance of King’s Cross and sat on a bench. It was a relief to sit in plain sight without anyone recognizing him. Until he heard the click of a camera. Harry’s attention snapped to a bush nearby, scanning it accusingly. It looked like there was a disillusionment charm in place. Harry scowled, whispering the countercharm, and revealed Rita Skeeter standing a few feet away from him.
“Yes?” Draco walked up next to Harry a second later, and Harry felt himself stiffen this time.
“Harry said he knew about Merlin’s warning in the book from your mum,” Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry huffed in annoyance.
“No kisses on the first date, Potter,” Draco said with a smirk, walking towards his own room. Harry scowled at his back but didn’t reply. He jogged to the bathroom to check his hair even though he knew it was not going to be tamed. He ran his hands through it a couple of times, then headed towards Hogsmeade.
Draco was sitting in his chair, absentmindedly sucking on the tip of a quill while he stared at a stack of papers.
“Er.. alright,” Harry said. He could feel his ears burning. Jason laughed, then threw Harry a wink while he got up and waited on another table nearby. As soon as he was gone, Harry picked up the napkin again and studied it. Jason definitely wasn’t a bad looking guy, and he had been nice enough to Harry. He cast another tempus charm, which revealed it to be 2:13. Harry sighed, and finished his butterbeer. He left a bigger tip than he usually did.
“He’s just awful at potions,” Harry couldn’t help but laugh at his blunt statement. Harry finished cleaning the mess, and tossed his rag to the side.
“She’s the one who reached out to me,” Harry said in defense, though it was half-hearted. Draco chuckled and opened the door for Harry, who found himself strangely satisfied with how the time at the manor had gone.
“Okay. See you later,” He planted a kiss to her forehead and headed towards the doors in the opposite direction of the library. Draco and Hermione walked to the library in silence, and they split off to cover more of the library in less time. They had done this method several times over the course of last year and pored over the books together at the same table they always had. The duo burned through several candles before Hermione excitedly smacked Draco on the arm.
‘Still trying to court my mum? She misses you quite terribly’. When Harry glanced at Draco, he appeared to be paying perfect attention to the lecture. Harry tapped his wand to the parchment, letting his own reply show.
“Tell you what,” The wither grabbed a napkin and transfigured another napkin into a pencil and began writing furiously. “I get off at seven. I’ll hang around for a bit after and if you wanna come to grab a real drink with me, you know where to find me,” He pushed the napkin toward Harry, which had the name Jason scrawled across the top, and a muggle phone number under that.
“I have no idea. He just vanished, and I think I caused it,” Harry replied miserably and Draco paused. That was the last thing he had expected to hear, but the events of the past few days wouldn’t make it unlikely.
“She has better things to worry about,” Harry said. Draco only rolled his eyes.
“Well, hello,” the clerk handed Harry his change, giving Draco an indiscreet once-over. Draco wrapped his arm over Harry’s shoulder, giving the clerk an innocent smile. His eyes widened and she handed the bag to Harry silently.
“That wasn’t necessary,” Harry said once they left the shop. Draco grabbed the bag from Harry and started to dig around in it for his chocolate.
“Has Greyback found you yet?” Draco didn’t answer, instead taking a half step towards the door.
“Well, we’re in a class, and that’s the respectful thing to do,”
“If you really want me to go, I’ll go,” Draco said, laughing quietly, and Harry felt himself blush. Harry realized Draco had a really nice laugh.
“Hermione probably knows,” They said in unison. They met eyes, both grinning. The kitchen door swung open, and McGonagall walked in, a floating feather in front of her. She raised an eyebrow after seeing them sitting on the floor.
“We know,” A voice chimed in from the back of the group, and several others quickly agreed. “And we’d accept that it might take more time or more practice or whatever,”
“Ten,”  Harry countered, and Draco finally cracked his eyes open. Harry grinned and winked at Draco dramatically.
A crowd of students passed by his door, heading away from the potions classroom. Harry leaped up as soon as they’d passed and headed for the room.
“I’ll be back after I’ve had a nap and some food,” She warned. Harry wasn’t sure it actually was a warning, but he thought it would be safe to assume it was. As soon as she had left, Harry and Draco both reached for the book. However, when it touched Draco’s hand, it started glowing red-hot and he promptly dropped it, swearing loudly.
“We’ve been going over stuff on cursed objects. We have to destroy the book that Narcissa gave you,” Harry glanced at the mentioned book, which was resting next to her elbow.
“Once upon a time, there was a green dragon named Chubs. Chubs was bullied in dragon school because he was green and because he was smaller than the rest of the dragons in dragon school.” Theatrical gasps went up through the crowd of elves. “One day, Chubs was at home cooking for his mum when a big, scary red dragon burst into his house and kidnapped his mum!” Nincy curled up on Draco’s foot, head resting on his shoe, and he smiled fondly at her. Harry watched in fascination. “Chubs decided to go after the big red dragon, but no one else in dragon school wanted to go help him save his mum. So, Chubs had to go to the big mountain where the red dragon lived in order to save his mum alone. Once Chubs got there, he realized that they had his mum hidden in a heavily guarded forest and he would never be able to fight all the guards. So, once it got dark, Chubs snuck into the forest, but one of the guards saw him!”
“Let’s not make this a big deal,” Harry said, folding the letter and tucking it into his coat pocket. Ron sighed again, and Hermione seemed relieved that Ron stayed quiet on the matter.
-----
Harry woke to soft rustling near his head. The sun was streaming through the window, and Harry jolted up, casting a tempus charm. Harry and Draco both swore at the same time, Draco looking at Harry, and Harry looking at the golden numbers floating in front of him. He summoned his shopping bag with the clothes in it and threw them on, not caring if Draco watched.
“Uh oh…” Draco muttered, glancing at the two Gryffindors in front of him.
“She just knows
“Minerva has high hopes for you two,” Flitwick said as if he was sharing a dark secret that nobody else knew of. “I do too, quite honestly,” He scooped a small bite of pudding onto his spoon and ate it daintily.
Harry nodded. There was a pause and Draco looked at Harry as though he had grown another head.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. Last night was really fun. They were… welcoming.”
Draco let out a snort beside him and Harry elbowed him lightly in the ribs as the kid declared loudly, “Harry Potter, truth or dare”.
Harry did as he was told as soon as the common room door shut.
Harry was explaining this in a letter to Draco, writing what he couldn’t say out loud. His writing was awful and he knew Draco would comment on it, as he always did. They had been talking on the phone every day (a muggle practice which Draco was surprisingly familiar with) and regularly writing letters to each other, but Harry was still missing Draco terribly. He had thought the space from him would be good for him and would allow him to clear his head slightly, but all it was doing was making him realise how much he was in love. He had just finished signing the bottom of the letter when Ron burst into their room.
Harry breathed a laugh. “You wish, Malfoy.”
the problem here?” He didn’t yell, but he said it loudly enough so that everyone could hear in the silence.
he care about anything else?
“If they tried it, they would change their minds.” He said with a smile. “How are Granger and Weasley?”
“Um… No. I think she’s going with… I’m not sure, really.”
Harry entered the library and took a deep breath, scanning the room until his eyes rested on Malfoy, sitting tucked away in the back corner, barely visible unless you knew where to look. And, well, Harry supposed he was just one of those people who knew where to look for Malfoy. He convinced himself it was a side effect of Malfoy’s suspicious behaviour in sixth year, but he really knew it was a product of his obsession. But he was past that.
Harry laughed again. “I’m happy for you guys.”
He plopped down on the bed next to Harry, defeat evident on his face. They sat in silence for a few moments.
He had already seen it. He just hadn’t remembered before.
Harry was done. He was sick of everything. He was sick of having the same dream over and over, he was sick of seeing Malfoy’s eyes every time he closed his eyes, and he was sick of thinking about their damn kiss.
to catch up to Malfoy. He just wanted to get back to his room, that was all.
“Hello, mother.” Draco said as he walked to Narcissa and kissed her cheek. “Did you sleep well?”
on my way to study with Pansy and Blaise, but I suppose Charms can wait a little while longer.”
“The dark mark. It’s still there.”
Seamus breathed out a laugh. “Yeah, you’d better sleep this one off.”
“So, really, the Sacred 28 is now the Sacred 14.” Harry said, looking at the list warily. “That’s still a lot of families.”
Harry nodded slowly. Even Hermione wasn't sure. That was bad.
Harry could tell he really meant it. And that hurt so bad.
They stood silently for a few moments, the lack of noise surrounding them heavily and awkwardly.
