“We’ve never exactly gotten along, we were rivals back in school. I thought we could put all of that behind us though. I tried to be friends with Malfoy, but he not-so-politely turned me down,” Harry supplies.
"Because I'm trying to be your friend despite some of you're misplaced opinions of me. We had a good time last night and I figured you'd want to do it again sometime, unless you had your fill and want to go back to just being my customer?"
“Sorry, my artistic sensibility is getting the best of me. Never pleased with my work,” Aby tries to cover, before letting go of Harry’s arm.
Once inside the house, Aby walks them straight to the kitchen to deposit their booze and he begins to scan the crowd for people he knows.
“Two whole weeks? Merlin, how are you still alive?” Harry gasps sarcastically. “Try three months, Aby. I’m in a bit of a dry spell unfortunately.”
“I guess it’s a good thing that I’ve got something pretty to look at while I feed my addiction,” Harry shoots back with a smirk, glancing over at Malfoy just before the man begins to ink his skin.
“Oddly enough he didn’t curse you last time, even when he mentioned you poisoning him to test out your charms,” Harry replies, leaning against the counter as they spoke.
"Luke is just protective of who he considers his pack. He'll be hard to win over but he's a good man even if he's terribly straight," he huffs. Luke was very tactile just not into men much to Aby’s ire early on. "Now let's go eat whatever Luke ordered and maybe you'll start having proper meals not in your office."
Aby stays quiet. He knows most people see him or see the covered mark and think that of him, but from the past few hours, he thought perhaps Potter wouldn’t consider him one. He knows he tells himself the same thing, but Luke and Michael are constantly telling him off for saying it because he was never convicted and in Jane's view he was what she called a child soldier, for whatever that was worth.
“Right, that’s all done. Just going to place the transfer and you tell me if you like how it looks,” Aby announces, breaking Harry out of his thoughts.
“It’s just Harry, and I was just getting off work unfortunately. Which explains the suit as I was stuck in a terribly boring meeting today,” he winks, making the witch blush.
“I feel the same way though,” Harry continues as he boards the train. “I’ve had a hard time in our world and it’s hard for me to find someone who isn’t just with me because of my fame.”
Luke frowns a little at Draco’s announcement, eyeing Harry closely. “Are you sure he’ll fit in with us and that he’s okay with...our afflictions?” he asks warily.
“Well let me finish the anchor points so you can get on with your day. I promise you can admire it as much as your want when you’re all done,” he teases.
“That’s very sweet, he seems like he was very good to you,” Harry says supportively, closing his eyes as he holds Malfoy close, taking a chance as he presses his face into the crook of his neck.
“Well you are more than welcome to experiment on me any time you want to try out a new technique,” Harry offers, not thinking about how open ended that sounded.
Harry’s mouth falls open a bit at that information. Every time he reacts on an assumption about Draco, the man contradicts him.
“You mean just because we’re getting along while he works he’s pushing me away? That’s a sort of a logic I guess, seeing as I’m part of the past he doesn’t talk about and has been running from,” Harry says, frowning as he tries to follow Malfoy’s thought process.
Aby smirks at the reply and continues to walk until they reach the nearest underground station. As they descend the steps, Harry takes in the surroundings, realizing it had been a long time since he’s ridden the tube. “You know, I don’t think I’ve taken the tube since I was still in Hogwarts,” he admits.
“I’ll take it,” he replies, before casting the patronus, the room filing with light before settling down into the shape of a stag.
Aby notices Potter and some bloke make their way into the crowd, and doesn’t stop Liam from leading him to the front of the stage. He catches Potter snogging in the middle of the set at a point but does his best to focus on the music, dancing and jumping to get his energy out.
“Of course. If anyone asks, I'll respect your wishes for privacy,” he agrees as he gathers his belongings. “Thanks again Malfoy, really,” he adds as he backs toward the door.
“Alright,” Harry nods. “They it is. But regarding the other night at the bar it helped that he was already drunk, so it made it easier to talk to him.”
“I don’t think I could get a tattoo based on those stories,” Harry begins as they leave the store, away from muggle ears. “Too close to home really.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll make time. Thank you!” she squeaks, and runs off to her station leaving Aby alone at the front desk.
“Sorry Aby, Michael closed the floo last night and forget to set the charm to reopen in come morning. Here’s coffee for his crimes,” she offers, passing the mug to her employee.
"Whoa that’s neat. Not sure what it is, but looks great,” Leo offers, and reaches out to skim Harry's arm, letting his fingers linger.
“Alright, I’ll stop by after work tomorrow if I get out of the office before you close,” Harry offers, thanking MAlfoy quietly as he serves them breakfast. “Never would have pictured you being able to cook but this is good,” he compliments as he begins eating, winking playfully at him from across the table.
To Harry it was clear. Lucius had been the last person to see Malfoy and with the information he learned from him that night outside the club, he knew that the elder Malfoy wasn’t keen on having a gay son. He also knows now that there was a lot Narcissa didn’t say about that night, because she’s let hints slip here and there, but every time Harry tries to push the woman begins to blame herself and he can’t bring himself to press her.
“Why are you so angry about it though? Normally if someone doesn’t want to be in your life you just say ‘fuck ‘em’ and forget about it,” she points out. “And in Harry’s defense, he hasn’t mentioned his fame or tried to use it to his advantage once since he came into the parlour. You know how people like that usually are though - sleazy and trying to milk the life out of who they are.”
"Will do. Goodnight Potter," Aby yawns, and soon passes out, his mind imagining that this was something more than simple platonic affection.
“I’m sorry. He just looked at me with those pretty green eyes of his and I couldn’t help but look at his muscles. He probably could have asked me to murder someone and I would have,” Jane jests, wrapping an arm around Aby as she continues to wax poetic about the good looking customers they sometimes got.
"Michael I'm certain flirts with you enough that you married him and as for me...I'd rather not, no offense. You're not my type and you're more like a sister, who has by circumstance, seen my cock.”
“Sure,” he agrees, picking up on the flirtatious tone in the man’s voice as he lifts his shirt to show off the snitch. But before Harry's shirt could get all the way up, Aby grips his bicep, murmur the stasis charm and glares at Harry.
"Perhaps. Though I'm angling for a bit more if I can manage it. Haven't been laid in two week," he grimaces and walking them up to the door.
The first band of the night comes on stage, and people begin to make their way to the front. His eyes scan the crowd, his friend talking into his ear to tell him something over the music, only to have his gaze land on a rather fit bloke leaning against the bar who looks like the type he might hit on once he knew the guy was properly beved up so he might not hit Aby if he wasn’t into blokes. But as soon as the guy turns to face the stage, Aby frowns - because of course Potter was here.
“Aby is right. Plus, my godfather was Sirius Black, the biggest wanker of all,” he jokes, ignoring the sensation he felt when Malfoy uses his first name.
“It’s not a name I go under. It’s my name. I haven’t used my former name in years, but that’s not the point. Just pick someone else please.”
“Well I’ve grown and matured since then Malfoy. I also am not fighting the terror of the wizarding world so I have time to slow down and think,” Harry replies with a frown, running his hand through his hair.
Aby tries to recall the conversation and remembers the throw away line. "I was under the impression that I misheard you or that you misspoke. I value privacy Potter so I didn’t wish to make assumptions," he explains, his haughty self coming out a bit more after a drink and some weed.
Harry didn’t bother with any reading material, content to just look around and take in the station, while Malfoy ate. His fascination only lasts so long however, and soon he was breaking the silence with a question.
"Ah I met Aby around shows. He did a poster design for my band once as a favor when I found out he could draw. So usual ways. But it's nice meeting you," he smiles, leaning into Harry a bit.
"So stay for breakfast, let me get a proper meal in you before you go back to work tomorrow. Then owl the shop this week if you want the patronus tattoo soon. I'm interested in working that charm out," he says and wanders back to the kitchen to make breakfast for them.
“So do you often ride the tube to see the men you shag? And what deems a guy worthy of a shag?” he inquires.
“I thought maybe you had grown up in the last decade! And what do you mean strutting about? I won’t apologize for being more confident in myself!” Harry yells back, grabbing his pants following Draco to the floo, leaving Jane in stunned silence.
"No Potter I didn't know any of that aside from the cloak but I just thought it was a rare invisibility cloak not THE cloak. I just always heard the Dark Lord go on and on about those things around the manor and that is a kind of magic I just stay away from."
“You want me to enjoy getting my dick pierced?” Harry responds in anger, cutting Jane off who is trying to tell Aby that he is misreading the situation.
Harry didn’t really know how to respond to that because it was the truth. Harry didn’t know Draco now. He still thought of him as the 18 year old he spoke for at his sentencing and trial and not the man before him. It had been eight years after all.
Luke is on the other side of the floo sitting on the threadbare couch, expecting his roommate to come home and debate what takeaway to get, when he sees the flames spit out the Auror whose been coming into the shop lately.
Aby works in silence for a few minutes until the room’s quiet was getting to him. Wiping Potter’s arm, he put his wand down and grabs his own wand from inside his desk, swishing it to put on his record player in the corner, filling the room with muggle punk music at a low volume. Murmuring the words under his breath as he works, he’s grateful that Steph was clever enough to take the music from the shiny discs the Muggles use and put them on the records Aby could use around his magic. This particular mix was of queer punk bands his ex enjoyed and Aby had it on heavy rotation.
“So he’s interested in Muggle things? He’d get along with my mate’s father. He has a collection of Muggle things. Just finds them fascinating, which I guess they are in their own little way,” he agrees, smiling over at Aby as he spoke.
Of course the moment Harry is in his boxers, the station door down the hall opens and closes, and Aby makes his way towards Jane’s station to close up for the night. Turning to look in the door, Aby takes in the sight of Jane smirking and Potter in his drawers. "Oh, um, sorry for interrupting. Enjoy" he murmurs, reading the situation incorrectly, his chest tightening.
Harry is already awake by the time Maofy starts stirring, his headache lessened by the fact that he is in bed with him. He makes a small noise of contentment as he feels the blonde nuzzle closer, followed by a soft whine when he backs off. Opening his eyes when he feels the other man stretch, Harry rolls over onto his other side and watches him for a moment. “G’morning,” he mumbles softly.
Harry felt his stomach swoop as he watches the other man immediately curl up with Malfoy. “I don’t know. Jane told me to come here,” he answers simply and shrugs his shoulders, turning to look expectantly at the woman.
Harry’s body breaks into some goosebumps at the man’s touch, but didn’t pull back. “Thank you, I think it’s pretty neat as well. Aby did an amazing job,” he praises.
"Potter believe me it would be difficult. Just trust me. And don't dwell on our first year. You were right to not take my hand then," he assures, deflating a little. "So just let me finish so you can enjoy your art.”
Harry shakes his head and sighs, looking at Malfoy silently for a moment. “Well I suppose that I appreciate you respecting my privacy. You’re one of the few people from the magical world that knows that I like men too,” he replies, having to bite his tongue in order to not point out how Malfoy’s tone had changes with his intoxication.
Harry goes home that Monday night, but the next day, he finds himself staying late once again at the office, this time, pouring over Malfoy’s cold case file, making adding private notes to what he’d gathered before.
“Yeah I can do that, do you want me to cast one right now so you can make some modifications? Then maybe we can grab dinner?”
“Wait...is that seriously why you think I want to be your friend? Would I like to fuck you? Oh yes, you are definitely my type. But I also like you as a person. I have fun with you and I feel like I can be myself around you,” Harry confesses, not quite believing that Malfoy thought that of him. “And I don’t want to go back to just being your customer, I did have fun last night. That was the most fun I’ve had in months, and I’m really glad that I found you in that shop so that we could have another chance,” he answers honestly, watching Malfoy carefully.
He forces himself to look away and pay attention as they go over his design again, nodding once they had done all the tweaking and it was perfect. “Oh, I can’t wait for this one to be done,” he admits excitedly.
Harry plasters on a smile as soon as he sees Jane, trying to not be bothered that Malfoy doesn’t want to interact with him. He gets that he’s a customer, but their history has to count for something - right?
“Yeah I’ll try not to do any shirtless sunbathing in the next few days,” Harry jokes as he pays for his work as well as the aforementioned generous tip and hands all of the money to Malfoy. “So I’ll see you in a week then Malfoy?”
Jane’s eyes glint wickedly, always loving the chance to try out her craft on someone new and adventurous. "The shop is technically closed but I'm certain Michael wouldn't mind me coming round late," she grins and hops off the stool. "What do you have in mind? Simple ear piercing perhaps? I can get you the list of charms I can imbue," she explains walking him back to her station that was at the very end of the hall past Aby’s.
“Yes, I did see her then, and I still do every now and then,” he answers, leaving out the fact that he lunches with Narcissa one a month, a holdover from when the investigation was in full swing. “She’s a lovely woman.”
"Nonsense, you're my guest and I shouldn't have been so bitchy earlier. But apparently just standing around looking like you, got us invited for a foursome if anything," he remarks.
Harry laughs and rolls his eyes, shaking his head at him. “I don’t want that though. I’ve had enough of being treated like I’m some weird god. I just want a relationship that’s an equal partnership honestly. If frequent sex comes as part of the package that would be ideal, but not needed.”
“I hope if I ever manage a patronus it’s not the same a Lucius’ - that would mean I have a peacock following me around and I don’t care for those horrid things.
Once he found the location in Horizont Alley, he’d walked in, asking the big man behind the desk how he’d make an appointment with an artist. The man had instructs Harry too look through the provided artist portfolios and once he found a style he like he’d be booked with that artist. He found it interesting that names the artists were kept off the portfolios, but the man had explained that it was to prevent bias. After perusing the options, Harry lands on the artist in the blue album - the one with the snitch flash - and books his consultation and session.
“No tell me. The DMLE doesn’t fine shops for hiring werewolves,” Harry states, a fact that causes Malfoy to snort.
“Mmm yeah. Luke’s not gonna glare at me is he?” Harry asks, grabbing Aby’s hand so that he won’t accidentally lose him on the walk back.
“Oh? Well that’s even juicier. He’d be lucky to have you honestly Aby. If things weren’t getting serious with Charlie I might try my hand at snagging you again,” Liam teases, leaning against him a bit. “I say you should go for it. You haven’t tried to settle down since Marley, love. You could at least use a steady friend with benefits,” he suggested.
Walking into the parlour, Harry expects Draco to be back at the front desk, but was instead greeted by a short, curvy witch with cropped hair, and more piercings than Harry had seen on a person before. He recognizes her as the witch who’d come into Draco’s station last time asking about food and poisons.
“He does have a talent. I’m really, really glad I came to see him,” Harry replies honestly, as he pulls out his wallet for this session’s payment, and another tip.
Making himself a strong drink, Harry stands beside Malfoy, and before he knows it he’s being introduced to one person after another.
Aby shakes his head fondly at the mention of Michael’s hobby. "He enchants them when he's done so they fly about. They're, what do you call them, aeroplanes? Fascinating things."
Aby leaves Harry by the door and walks to his drawer to pull out some joggers and a t-shirt. "Look Potter your offer is generous, and I know you mean well in your own way, but it's a lot to process in a matter of days at this point," he mutters, pulling off his shirt to reveal his very tattooed chest and pierced nipples.
Harry pauses for a moment before his curiosity gets the better of him. “Can I ask why you and, um, Marley, broke up? You just seem to think so fondly of him still.”
Harry relaxes as he is passed the box and takes a slice of his own. He likes this - just sitting around and talking while sharing a pizza. It was easy, simple, and he can’t help but hope he’ll get the chance to do this again.
Harry scowls as she tells him the news, shaking his head at her. “No thank you, Jane. As much as I’m sure Luke is capable I’d prefer Malfoy to finish what he started,” he insists. “Look, he and I...exchanged some words, so I know he’s avoiding me. I know I may be a bit oblivious at times but I can tell when someone is trying to get rid of me.”
It’s for the better, he thinks, but can’t help to ask after her. "Did you see her then? After it ended?" he asks, missing his mother more than anyone else, rubbing at his chest where his tattooed narcissa blooms were.
"I'd suggest putting out an ad for a flatmate but I see the issue in that, given who you are," he commiserates. "Also congratulations to Granger and Weasley. Didn't know they had a family.”
“Ow...fuck,” Harry murmurs, wincing a little as Malfoy starts. He frowns until he looks down and watches the blonde work, becoming entranced for a moment. He has to admit that watching the look of concentration on Malfoy’s face was captivating in its own way, still not used to seeing the sight of his former nemesis not only alive, but tattooing him. He smiles as he realizes that the face Malfoy makes when tattooing, is the same he had back in school when he was concentrating on brewing potions. “You were right, this does hurt a bit more,” he tells him softly.
"Oh yes! I was able to get six charms into one piercing!” Jane exclaims, but seeing Harry’s confused face, she clarifies. “You see these earrings?” she says as she motions to the case below her. Most have some kind of charm in them. Some simple, some more complex. Anything from protection, translation, to some cheeky and sexy,” she winks.
Harry shakes his head, bristling at the fact that Malfoy ignored his comments on the shop. “No, what you and I decided on earlier in the week is still what I want.”
A week goes by without Potter coming to chat and bother Aby. The absence strangely bothers Aby, even though it had only been seven days and he would see him in a week. But as that thought enters his head he reminds himself it’s best to not get attached as after next week Potter wouldn’t be coming back whatsoever until he wanted a new tattoo.
When Luke arrived back at their flat that night, he tells Aby that Potter missed their appointment and rescheduled. “I didn’t see his name on the ledger so I don’t know if he’s with you or not, just a heads up,” he says, sitting down on the sofa next to Aby in commiseration.
"Well sometimes it helps if I know if my friends have slept with him. Reviews of sorts and whatnot. Also a lot of them like to whisper ridiculously filthy things into my ear as the night goes on and most of the time it lives up to the hype," he avidly explains as he stands on the platform.
"I wasn't in the mood to put in an effort beyond 'why yes I know you and know you're fun in bed, want to shag?' so there's that. Besides, nothing a wank can't fix," he shrugs, vanishing the butt of his cigarette and stepping out of the alley.
“No, your schedule is fine. Honestly, you might just become my regular artist now, I’m so in love with it,” Harry grins as he retrieves his wallet from his pocket while Malfoy pencils his appointments in.
“All done,” Aby breathes, the process leaving him exhausted. Potter stands, searching for the points and frowning when he doesn’t see anything.
“I just want to see you happy,” Harry offers as he sits down on the  edge of a well loved armchair, looking around the apartment. “But apparently that makes me a bad guy,” he adds, glancing over at Malfoy and the other tattoo artist, Luke. He wasn’t even sure why he cares, or why he’d come here. But he does care, he cares very much about what happens to Malfoy.
"Potter you kept looking over at me. They probably thought we were together. Next time I'm leaving you to flounder alone," he grouses and goes to the kitchen for another drink.
Harry came to terms with his sexuality about three years ago, finally comfortable with the idea that he was attracted to both men and women. His close friends and family know, but it was more of an open secret with everyone else. He wants the freedom to date and experiment without it all becoming a tabloid article in the Prophet. He found Nellie’s about a year ago when a blind date he’d been set up on took him here, and he comes back every once in a while to listen to the music and find a distraction for the night. When he arrives he goes straight to the bar and after a quick scan, sees a petite blonde guy and begins to chat him up. Turning to the bar to get him a drink, the blonde crowds him in, leaning close so he could chat into Harry’s ear above the music.
Aby notices the auror keeps looking around and surveying the apartment, as if he wants to commit it to memory. His gaze thought eventually leads him to Luke, who is glaring at the brown-haired man.
“I agree. It definitely suits you,” Harry replies with a smile, reaching up to run his fingers through the longer hair on top.
Seeing as the fic was inspired by the song Common People by Pulp each chapter will be given a song title name.
“Fair enough. But really, it was a pleasure to take care of him. I hated that asshole,” he admits, his thoughts turning to Remus for a moment.
"I turned him down for good reason! Look at him strutting about! He is going to call attention to me after five years of doing a rather good job of hiding. So yes I turned you down Potter but I can assure you that you'll only remember it when you lunch with my mother!" he screams, unable to keep his mix of emotions in check and turns on his heels to go to the floo.
Harry raises an eyebrow to that answer. “So I take it to mean that they’re in places not meant to be seen by everyone?”
"Just this," she says, sliding over his final receipt and follow-up packet. "Now if you need anything or if you damage your tattoo in the field we can touch that up here no problem. I also put in a few business cards. We used Aby's design on the last batch - it’s a wand that when activated cast a spell onto the skin," she beams proudly. "He's such a smart boy."
“I do. There’s this little diner not too far from here that makes a killer burger,” Harry offers, having a craving for something greasy. “Does that sound good to you?”
"Give it time. Tattoos are addicting believe me. I even thought of another one for you if you ever want to add,” he muses and lead him out the front door, grabbing his coat and wallet as he goes, checking for muggle bills.
Harry laughs incredulously at that news. “We did? By your friend? Are you going to tell me that you accepted on my behalf? But for what it’s worth you weren’t being bitchy, I am pretty damn awkward,” he admits.
“Ah so it’s sentimental as well. It’s not bad music actually,” Harry admits. “Is this what you normally listen to?”
"Yes, just three of us now,” leaving out that that while now it's only the three of them in the flat he had at one point been the fifth person sardined in there when Steph found him sleeping rough. “I bet you live alone,” he snarks.
“I just...I just think you’re...nevermind,” Harry stammers, feeling like an idiot for thinking that he’d seen an opening. Forget their history, Malfoy is out of his league is so many ways.
"I'll try harder next time Potter. But for now you'll just have to settle for my company," he teases, leaning back into him in return.
"I think you're asking for too much," he laughs sarcastically, butting his shoulder against Harry's playfully.
“I’d rather not. I’ve seen your work and I like what you do. I promise I’m a generous tipper,” Harry replies, taking a step closer to the counter.
“Why would I want an out?” Harry asks curiously. “You assume that I wouldn’t want you to do this just because it’s you?” he adds as he follows along behind Draco to the back of the shop.
“That’s fine, eat all you want. I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the day,” he assures as he shrugs off his robe and suit jacket before unbuttoning his shirt.
Aby moves slightly away from him, not entirely shoving away but enough to say no. "I'm sorry if you thought I was inviting you back for a fuck...I get that I'm easy but I don't want to cock this up," he clarifies, taking the kettle off the stove.

"I'm convinced your flirt with the world Potter, honestly," he sighs fondly, working on the antler carefully, thankful that the auror could only see him peripherally - he would be able to hide his blush that way.
He shakes his head and smiles as he mentions Hermione’s baby. “No, not yet. She’s not due for another two months or so, but that doesn’t mean anything,” Harry admits, sighing softly as he presses their foreheads together. This definitely feels like something more than platonic today.
Jane and Luke sigh in agreement, looking sympathetically at their friend. “So that’s what set you off then. You miss your mum and he’s willing to help you” Luke voices.
Harry rolls his eyes as he approaches Malfoy, not flinching as the smell of weed permeates the air. “Not hardly, I don’t care what you do in your free time. And you could have come up and spoken to me you know, I already told you that I liked men at the shop.”
“Yeah, there was a search for you for nearly a year. Your Mum spearheaded it and my department even got involved trying to find you,” Harry informs him, glancing over at him, thinking back to the file on his desk.
"Very funny Potter. Do what I do and just stick to muggles. Less likely to disappoint in the end," he replies, figuring Potter was just trying to get a rise out of him - not that Aby wouldn’t mind seeing Potter on his knees, but that was just wank fodder as far as he was concerned.
“And you’re the only snack I feel like going for right now,” he tacks on, silently thanking the alcohol for giving him some courage.
Aby begins to cackle and cheekily makes a star on his wall calendar. “Sorry just marking the date that you finally admit my brilliance.”
"Yes well I don't recommend askin' any weres that question unless you're doin' your job or about to get in bed with them. But thanks for taking care of Greyback at least. He didn't get me but one of his arseholes did," he mutters.
On Thursday Aby is finishing a client at the front counter, when Harry walks into the shop. It's amusing to see his customer recognize Potter and go wide eyed. "Potter I'm ready for you," he calls out, his hair freshly cut with the sides shaved down and the top left long.
"It doesn't matter. It's the same reason I’m weary of being his friend. He's Harry Potter...and I'm dead to the wizarding world. I'm not about to go breaking my heart or my body like that."
Harry walks over to the mirror and looks as the snitch flutters around his body, his eyes wide with amazement. Waiting until it flits into his hand, he closes it. Lifting all but one finger, Harry sees that the golden ball is still there, struggling under his grip. Turning he thanks Malfoy, beaming.
"No Potter I can keep being the person who does your art if you want a consistent style but that's it,” Aby replies, wanting to end this exchange before it grew into another argument.
Harry chuckles at that and looks over at Malfoy. “They wouldn’t come looking for me. They’d probably be throwing a party since their team leader would be out of the office.”
“Huh, your bed really is pretty comfortable,” he muses, wiggling a bit before he settles down, his breath hitching once he realizes that he and Malfoy are touching.
“Are you going to see the next band?” one of them asks Harry, making him look at Malfoy for an answer. Malfoy just nods after downing a shot, and leads the way down to the basement.
"Honestly Jane, you're married," Aby griped as she touched up her lipstick. "Oh Aby, you know as well as I do Michael and I do our own thing. Besides he's a bit young for me but I do like flirting...and you're so terribly gay," she pouted.
"Because Aby wasn’t happy before you came around, is that is?" Luke challenges, pulling a blanket down around his friend who doesn’t seem to want to talk. "You ever stop to think that maybe Aby doesn’t want this fixed for him because his life before now wasn’t all that great? You might mean well but you've been around less than two months - we've been here for years," he states bluntly, turning his sharp gaze onto Potter.
“He doesn’t like me...yet,” Harry mumbles, trying to keep up with Malfoy’s long legs as they walked.
"Harry we should get out of bed and eat," he whispers, not knowing what the other man is playing at. Sure Aby is there, an easy target for sex and experimentation but he can’t do that.
Harry snorts and falls into a seat with Aby, leaning heavily against him. “Mmm yeah, Aby. Didn’t get laid though,” he laments, though he grins at the blonde.
The morning was rather uneventful as the only people who came in beside Steph, who was on shift, walk in looking for directions or to just gawk at the art on the walls. Regardless of why someone walks in, Aby has his usual greeting on his lips - “Welcome to Magus Atramento, do you have an appointment or walk-in?” It was automatic at this point whenever the customer charm went off.
Harry was making his way to Draco’s bed to sit when he catches sight of the other man shirtless, and stumbles. Catching himself, he takes a seat, doing his best not to stare...but finding the view of tattooed and pierced Malfoy hard to look away from. Eventually, he gathers his thoughts, and hopes the other man hadn't noticed his gaping. “I didn’t mean to overwhelm you Aby,” he murmurs,still getting used to the name. “I just wanted you to know that the option was there if you ever wanted to take it. I’m sorry for dumping so much on you at one time.”
“Well during the war I learned the Tale of the Three Brotehrs is certainly not a tale. I encountered, the stone, wand, and cloak - the cloak I still have actually - and I most certainly used it to greet Death like an old friend.”
“Thanks Aby,” he murmurs, stealing another glance at him before he downs the potion and heads back into Malfoy’s room to grab his clothes.
“Well the coloring is all done, take a look in the mirror before we move onto the anchor points,” he instructs, sitting up and stretching.
“Of course I like it, you did it after all,” he replies softly, glancing up at Malfoy in the mirror, smiling fondly at him.
"I’ve been trying to get the ink right for a patronus tattoo. The animal would be mostly stationary, but the ink surrounding the glow would move. I think I have most of the mechanics and spellwork worked out, so if it’s something you’re interested I’d be grateful for a canvass.”
"She's getting a mural done based on the Beedle the Bard tale Fountain of Fair Fortune so it's intricate. Not much movement but more art" he explains, pointing at the liquor store across the street.
“Oh I’ve been waiting to hear that all my life, Aby,” Harry says loudly, flirting with the man a little as he walks down the hallway, admiring the man’s new haircut. “Love the new look,” he compliments.

“Yes and no in a way. My ex made me a muggle CD and Steph, my flatmate, made it into something I could play around magic. Besides, plenty of bands still make music on records, not just CDs.”
"Potter is just dramatic I can assure you of that," he scoffs, the name coming out of his mouth as it had when he was younger. "He mentioned that after this tattoo that he wouldn't be coming around again so I don't know what he's making such a fuss about. Luke is more than capable to do his movement as he's more experienced than me. Besides...he agreed with me earlier that I was a death eater so I figured an auror like him would appreciate the distance," he shrugs, turning his eyes from Jane who was scowling at the comment.
"Rising the ranks at the DMLE already, not surprised. Congratulations," he offers, and moves to steady Potter so he won’t mess up the design. Aby tries not to think about the differences between his and Potter’s life. Potter’s the first person he's seen from his old life since he'd run off and it stings in some ways. He begins to get lost in his thoughts, focusing on just the task before him, until a knock comes at the entrance to his station that pulls him up.
“Now take those as instructed,” she continues, handing the vials over, “and we'll see you in two weeks!” sending Harry on his way.
"I think I retain enough Slytherin self-preservation to do anything with you Potter," he shoots back, standing as their station approaches. "Come on. Let's go to the chippy enroute so we can line our stomachs for proper drinking."
“Wait that was Luke, the one who the customer turned down earlier?” he asks, trying to mentally take in the ways Luke might have looked werewolfish to be profiled by his customer.
As Aby steps outside he sees Potter against the wall of the bar, snogging the blonde he’d been chatting up. Not wanting to interrupt, he ducks into an alley to pull out the weed cigarettes he smokes now and again. He knows it’s a horrible habit but he only indulges every so often. From where he’s standing he hears a goodbye and the close of a car door, and thinks nothing of it until he hears footsteps coming down the alleyway.
“No, you don’t have to do that. I mean, I can crash on the couch if you wouldn’t be comfortable sleeping in the bed with me?” Harry suggests as he leans against the kitchen counter.
Just nodding as he walks out, Aby let out a large sigh of relief, and wanders to Luke’s station to ask him what the hell he was thinking booking Potter for him.
“Why wouldn’t you be able to trust me?” Harry asks with a frown, genuinely not understanding. He thought that he had more than proven himself to be trustworthy during his life.
“Take off your shirt and sit down with your chest to the back. I should be done within the hour," Aby said without looking at Harry, causing the auror to frown at the way he was spoken to.
"Rough day love?" Jane asks as Harry walks in and she sees him looking worn out. "I've got you in for two but Aby had to call out today. Luke can finish you up. Movement charms are pretty standard and he should have you wrapped up in an hour or so," she offers.
Harry follows Aby to his room, not expecting what he sees when the blonde opens his door. It was certainly not the decor of the Malfoy he used to know. Inside is a modest bed and dresser, with the only visible personal items being Malfoy’s record collection and a stack of what looked to be second hand muggle books.
Harry feels a small bit of relief when Malfoy goes right back to the floor, ignoring him, but there is another feeling there too. Hurt, he realizes. He doesn’t know why he feels that, so instead of following that line of thought, he goes back to the bar to find his potential pull for the night. He orders them another round of drinks and resumes their conversation, trying his best to forget that Malfoy is even here. It’s apparent that the blonde doesn’t appreciate his being here and he isn’t going to try and let that bother him.
Across the room, Aby is back at his booth with just two of his friends. He must look distracted when Liam, his occasional friend with benefits, loops an arm around him. "You look wound up," he hears them say," to which Aby replies that he is. Liam smirks at that and leans in to mouth at Aby’s neck until the next band starts, and Aby murmurs that they are a tease before pulling them into the crowd to watch the show, doing nothing to stop them from continuing their playful touches.
“I need to just quickly eat my lunch before we get started if you don’t mind. Use this time to go to the toilet if you like or just peruse some of the pamphlets.”
"Sorry not my type both because of your bits and professional," he replies, eyeing the way the auror is looking at his friend.
“Classy, Aby, real classy. Maybe I’ll hit on you to test how open minded you are” Harry remarks, wondering vaguely where his sudden infatuation with Malfoy was coming from.
The war had been hard on Harry, as it had on everyone, but to him it felt as everyone around him was finding a way to move on and cope, whereas Harry just had his job. Sure he was moving his way through the ranks at the DMLE fairly quickly, but at 25 he was still at a loss as to what to do with himself other than take on another case or put in another long night. His friends were getting married, having kids, travelling, but Harry hadn’t found anything that sparked an interest.
Nodding, Aby puts him in and hands him the potions and receipt for this session. "Be sure to take those and try not to expose yourself to the sun too much until I seal it. They say it's only for muggle tattoos but I know that it affects magic ink as well."
"Yes I can assure you that I won't be running off to the Prophet to expose this particular part of your life. Now where was that twink you were hanging off of all night?" he asks looking about.
“So how many tattoos do you have? I can only see a few,” he inquires, watching Malfoy eat and look over his notes.
Aby begrudgingly gets up and begins to walk to his room, gesturing at Potter to follow him down the hall and to his bedroom.
“God, maybe I just need to take you home with me so that you can take care of me,” he replies, not thinking of what he just said. “Hopefully I’ll just be able to go home and pass out or maybe I’ll go get drunk after this to help with the pain,” Harry muses, shutting his eyes and lying back. His day at work was nothing if not tedious and exhausting.
Something in Harry’s chest flutters a bit as Malfoy let out the guffaw, surprised by the sound. He had never heard such a genuinely happy and amused sound come from the man. “Oh sorry. I didn’t know. You just spoke so highly of her,” he corrects quickly, blushing furiously.
"Apology accepted. And I'm sorry for being... mercurial," he sighs not knowing what else to really say, as he slips on a t-shirt that shows off what is left of his Mark. The snake and skull is faded and covered in ivy and blossoms. Changing into his joggers, it was a contrast to see that his legs had almost no tattoos in comparison to the other half of his body.
“Yeah it’s difficult to find a flatmate who’s a wizard and would respect my privacy and I can’t find a Muggle one because I might have to use magic to protect myself and my home one day. So I guess I’ll just continue to be lonely,” Harry replies with a dramatic shrug. “And thank you, I would tell them that you said that but they still think you’re dead. Hermione is pregnant with their second child now though, a boy, his name is going to be Hugo,” he rambles.
"House show. Friend’s band is putting it on, which means the house will be full of miscreants. Now said miscreants are of varying sexualities, so don't hit on everyone assuming they'd be into you. Bands are downstairs in the basement and the entrance fee is some alcohol."
“I wish I could say the same, you annoyed the hell out of me,” Harry jokes, smiling at the two men and watching as Aby eyes Matthew, ignoring the strange sensation that’s rising inside his chest again. Turning away to smile at Leo, Harry sees that he wasn’t a bad looking bloke. “So how do you know Aby?” he asks them man curiously.
Harry smirks at the comment about Voldemort, glancing up at Malfoy, blushing slightly when he realizes they were very close to each other. “Well are you surprised? He hated all muggles and anything to do with them, so it’s no wonder he didn’t think anything of Muggle ingenuity.”
“Oh so I would be a disappointment now? Or maybe you’re worried that you’d disappoint me? What I think is that you’d be too chicken to do anything with me, Aby,” he challenges.
Harry begins to laugh too and nods his agreement. “No you really are, mark away. I didn’t know you could do that with tattoos.”
“You know as well as I do that I was actually ill. I forgot, again, not to try and keep up with a werewolf post-full moon when it comes to drinking," he sigs, leaving out the part that he coincided that binge with the day before Potter’s appointment. Across the room, Luke sniggers, not helping the argument.
Aby had been dreading that question. Shaking his head he explains that he’s never been able to master it.
“Nah, I don't have anything to do tomorrow,” Harry answers, hesitating for a moment before finally slipping into bed with Malfoy, sighing happily as he gets comfortable.
"I'll think about it...shame you're off the market for a bit. Such a brilliant shag," he laments, playfully swatting his arse. "Go find your man. I'm going to see the show and maybe take something other than a bottle home."
Settling into the gentle hum that comes from the wand, Harry begins to let his mind relax, and feels himself unwind in the chair, despite the minor pain. He comes to only when he hears someone walk into the station.
“S’alright. I like your company and at least you’re fit and fun to look at,” Harry quips back, laying his head over on Aby’s shoulder as they lean against one another.
"Well I don't know you life,” he points out, laying his hand back on Potter’s bicep to keep shading.
“Tea is so complicated to make though,” Harry whines a little, finally letting Malfoy go, lolling his head to the side to watch as he walks to the kitchen.
"What happened to Aby?" he asks, almost growling the question, taking steps towards Potter, until a moment later Aby comes through with Jane and he settles a tad.
"Nope, just trying for you to have a good time.” As the next band comes on, Aby is pleased to find Potter staying for the show, even jumping around to the music as the night went on.
Turning to Aby, Jane suggests, “And why don't you change and go chat with Harry a bit and see if you want him to stay for dinner."
“Thank you, Draco. And I promise that I won’t,” Harry agrees with an eager grin, and rolls his eyes as Aby refers to his friend group as degenerates. “I think you might be the only degenerate, I like Jane and I’m not too sure about Luke yet,” he admits, brushing off his comment about saving his life.
"I'm afraid we've gotten you properly addicted," he teases as he places the transfer onto Potter’s skin, hoping to get the outline at least done today.
Aby has to stifle his laughter. "Yes Potter brilliant small talk. Start by asking the man you just met a question that's potentially too personal," he cackles. Luke smirks only because Aby is laughing so hard at his question. "Thank you Aby for pointing that out, as it is extremely personal. But for your information auror, it happened during the war so about seven years ago."
Harry watches sadly as Malfoy leaves, inwardly cursing himself. Why had he done that? He’d probably just fucked everything up. He heaves himself out of the bed a few moments later, following Malfoy to the kitchen as he tries to think of some way to smooth things over.
Aby apparates to an alley he’d been blown in a few times before, and makes the walk to Nellie’s. Greeting the bouncer, he asks if the music tonight was dance music or if he was lucky and a band was on, and to his great pleasure it’s the latter. Walking inside, he bypasses the bar for not to head to the stage area to see if he knows anyone there tonight. Spotting some familiar faces he goes to say hellos and sits down with them before the set starts. A cute guy with his friend hands him a pint within moments of him sitting down and he figures it’s a good start to the night.
"I thought I did until I saw a muggle artist in action. My main chest piece isn't magical. My ex did it for me actually. Michael sent me to a shop he was working at to apprentice for a bit. Owner was a squib and lucky for me, Marley, my ex, has a sister who is a witch," he explains getting a hair tie from his dresser to knot his hair up again.
Aby gets home and decides he doesn’t want to remember that night, or the weekend in general, altering for the next 48 hours between fits of melancholy and heavy-handed drinking. He certainly hasn't learned to cope well over the years when things didn't go his way, but lucky for him Luke knew him well, and upon seeing him Sunday morning, picks the blonde up and takes time to his room, where they spend the next hours curled around each other like an odd pack, coming down from the emotional highs of the weekend.
“Not at all the norm,” Harry agrees and pulls the blonde a bit closer, looking up at him again. “I’m glad that you had Severus growing up. I don’t know what I would have done had I not had Arthur to be such a good influence,” he admits.
"It’s nothing painful or tragic. He got an offer to go apprentice under someone in Germany and we'd only been together a few months. He's a great artist and I wasn't about to put up a fuss about that kind of an opportunity. I see him when he passes through London. It ended well," he explains and put his shirt back on, trying not to blush under Potter's gaze.
"Leo, Matthew this is Harry. Just finished a tattoo on him a few weeks ago and he didn't entirely annoy me on the chair," he begins as an introduction, eyeing Matthew a bit.
Harry flinches a little at Draco’s tone, feeling a bit inexplicably hurt. “I don’t...I didn’t think it would be that difficult Malfoy,” he admits honestly. “I just thought that maybe we could start over. That maybe I could shake your hand this time instead of pushing you away like I did in our first year.”
By the time Thursday afternoon came, Harry’s a nice mixture of hurt and pissed off about the entire situation. He wants answers from Malfoy, but he has a feeling that the man is going to make getting answers very difficult.
“That’s really impressive Malfoy. I take it that you’re fine with muggles now considered the apprenticeship and whatnot?”
"Heard you were here gorgeous. Been too long," Liam leers and got right up in Aby’s space. Aby always enjoys Liam's company. They were tall and built, but that comes with being in a gay rugby league he assumed.
Aby sits with his thoughts for a bit, and then just has to know. Moving across the room, he throws in a pinch of floo and calls Jane.
“It’s been less than a day. Now sit and let me show you what I have done. I don't think we can start today but if you like the design we can go write you down in the book - it’ll be after hours mind you," he added.
“Aby I’m getting food for tonight. Chinese or curry” Jane asks, interrupting, Harry’s blank state of mind.
"Thanks. I wanted something different and I thought it suited me. Combination of sleek but punk," he grins, and ushers Potter to the seat reaching for the design to going over it him one more time.
Harry sits up and goes to the mirror. “Holy shit,” he breathes as he looks at the new additions to his body. The gold swirls around the snitches body, giving the tattoo and ethereal quality, especially on the wings.
Once inside the house, Aby walked them straight to the kitchen to deposit their booze and Draco began to scan the crowd for people he knew.  Making himself a strong drink, Harry stood beside Aby, and before he knew it he was being introduced to one person after another.
Harry can’t help but smile as Malfoy leaves the room, his heart fluttering as he thought about the other man. He doesn’t know what he’s feeling exactly but he knows that it's certainly more than lust. He gets dressed before wandering back out into the kitchen, fixing himself a cup of coffee.
It was around 12:45, right when Aby was about to grab his lunch before his session, that the chime when off and he began his usual salutation. "Welcome to Magus Atramento, do you have an appointment or..." but the remainder of his welcome trails off as he sees who’s standing in the shop doorway - Harry Potter, the sodding saviour of the wizarding world.
“I’m sorry our professor had to deal with that and I know I wasn’t exactly...sympathetic. It's my understanding Granger's legislation has helped some though, even if people are still arses."
Aby sits at his station trying to get in a meal as usual, eating some leftovers at work rather than waiting to get home.
“When are you free to start the tattoo? This week?,” he asks as he sits down at the table, ignoring Luke’s glares.
“Look, I get that you don’t want to associate with me but you don’t need to hide in an alley to smoke in order to not run into me,” Harry calls out into the dimness.
"That’s a pity you’re learning it now. Sex and magic are quiet compatible as it's raw energy fueling magic. Jane knows of a few good magic sex shops if you want something to experiment with,” he winks.
Aby chokes a bit at the question again, not used to so many inquiries about his personal life during a session, especially not ones that require him to come out, even if it was just Potter. "What is with the interest in who I’m shagging? And for the record, no. Luke and I just live and work together. I make his wolfsbane potion because his old apothecary started charging him a lot...and he couldn't afford it. Got dangerous...and well I have the skills," he shrugs. “I make it for his whole pack.”
When Malfoy doesn’t reply Harry can’t help but ask, “So are you and him a thing, you know since you brew his wolfsbane?”
“Yes, stops. I put anchor points on your palms and the back of your hand, so when you close your hand, if the snitch is in it, the tattoo stops moving, like it’s really there. Open your palm and it goes zipping over your body again,” Aby explains. “Depending on where you want it to fly is where we put the other points but the palms are the showstopper in my opinion. Took me ages to figure out the magical theory behind it, pity we don’t have academic journals for tattooing,” he laughs to himself.

"Border. Makes it easier to keep it low profile and most of those flats are run by either squibs or muggleborns," he explains, and begins to walk alongside Potter who seems to be going his way. "As you can see, the shop is in a pretty dodgy part and I'm not too far from it."
Harry frowns as Aby said that he had been looking over at him, not knowing what to say. Maybe he wasn’t so good at this whole party thing after all. He sighs and makes himself another drink as well, swallowing hard and glancing over as someone energetically bounces over to Malfoy, picking him up into a hug, calling him gorgeous.
Harry knows he should think about this more, but the high from the tattoo is egging him on, as was the thought that he wouldn’t see Malfoy again unless he keeps coming back for more. “Cock it is then,” he decides. “What can I expect?”
"I'm pissed at you because you come here barging in, being all charming and making it seem like everything is fucking alright," he spits trying to shove his way past Potter and meeting a block of muscle. "As if in any realm we could be friends, or that I could have a piece of my old life back. Draco Malfoy is dead Potter! He died when his dad tried to kill him for being a poof and he had to trade sex for a bed. Abraxas doesn’t need you waltzing in, but here you are trying to fix things because it's what you do. So yes I'm bloody pissed and tired Potter, now move!"
Harry turns to walk out and go home, pausing when he realizes that he wasn’t ready to go yet. “Actually Jane, do you have time for a piercing right now?” he asks suddenly.
“Huh? What are you talking about? I’m telling you because you know me and my history,” Harry replies, looking confused as he stops alongside Draco
“I’m not drunk,” Harry scoffs, rolling his eyes before getting up to wander over to the small kitchen. He finds Aby staring at the kettle, waiting for it to boil, and places his hands on his hips. “Are you sure all you want to do is cuddle?”
“I know that prat. I speak highly of plenty of my friends without wanting to shag them you know,” he replies, sticking his tongue out at Malfoy playfully.
“No I don't think you'll hit on everyone, merely just saying that unlike a gay bar there isn't a way to almost guarantee who will be offended or not by being hit on but most punks that these shows are pretty open minded.”
Harry gapes a bit as Malfoy shows him his tongue piercing, his mind automatically repeating what Ginny says those piercings are good for. He was about to ask more, but a curve in the inking made him wince. “Do I actually have to feel the pain from this? Aren’t we wizards? Can’t we make this go away?” he asks through gritted teeth.
Aby always enjoys sleeping in when he can, and finding himself wrapped around a warm body is even better. Nuzzling into the man's neck he takes him a moment to remember it’s Harry in his bed and he backs off a bit, opting instead to roll over on his back and stretch. He'll need a slight hangover potion soon, but he could be worse off.
“There’s nothing wrong with that though…” he trails off, even though he knows Grimmauld Place was in a more than respectable area. “Do you live with roommates then? You mentioned you had the flat alone to yourself tonight.”
"You mentioned that you work too much which leads me to believe you're the sort who eats whatever is on the trolley in the office if no one is inviting you around," he deduces, moving to leave his room.
Aby goes about eating his curry, trying to not look at Potter undress, turning to his desk to look over a muggle tattoo magazine he'd picked up a day ago. His ex is featured and he’s a bit proud and a bit jealous.
“No, I don’t have to go anywhere. I just tried to hit on you and I was even going to kiss you. Why would you want me here?,” he asks,
"I'll let him know. Michael was dragged into something similar back where he grew up so he knows what that's like for Aby. I do hope you come back for more work and maybe you'll let me fix you up with a piercing or two," she winks.
Is that really what he assumes Harry thought of him? Nothing could be further from the truth. Draco Malfoy is a completely different man than he had been during their school years, and it only took a few minutes of talking to him to make that clear.
“Thank you Jane. I’ll...I’ll see you two there,” Harry nods, unsure of why he was willing to go to Malfoy’s place. He takes one last look at Malfoy and steps into the floo, calling out the address, and a moment later coming out the other grate.
“Yes thank you for that. I do get quite a lot of compliments,” he grins. “So I guess just schedule Potter.”
“No. I’ve been testing similar charms on other pieces, but the ink is a pearlescent kind of color that would take some creative charm work to blend magically, as well as to get the wisp-like movements right.”
"Well feel free to send them to me. Do plenty of charmed piercings. Language, anti-jinx, and more. Honestly if you can think of it, I might be able to imbue the metal to hold the charm.”
"No matter what I decide don't punish my mother. She probably enjoys her time with you. Always went on about you after the war.”
"Seeing as you brought booze that's a good start. But honestly just coming around and hanging about is just a great way to meet people. You said Aby did some ink on you recently? Mind if I take a peak?" He asks, a hint of flirt in his voice.
"As delicious as that sounds I don't think if I slept with him it would just be for a shag. Had a horrible pash on him back then and it hasn't died unfortunately."
Harry nods, following obediently, considering himself lucky that he’s still being invited to stay. He just hopes that he doesn’t do anything else stupid to embarrass himself.
"Potter plenty of customers come in, chat, ask questions. I'm treating you like I would any other customer. You come in for a service, I provide it, and you leave. I don't chat with customers after hours, I don't walk home with them, and I certainly don't discuss my personal life with them," he grouses. "And as for who I am, it doesn't matter. Because being around you brings attention. And that is the last thing I need if I want to keep being alive."
It didn’t take long for the silence to get to Harry again. “So brewing? Still doing what you love in your spare time I see. You were always really good at potions...”
"I don't have my ledger on me so either owl or come in," he suggests, getting together some eggs, beans, and toast for everyone, leaving a plate under stasis for Steph when she wanders home.
“Who’s to say that you’d be breaking your heart or your body Aby?” Jane asks, giving him a sad smile. “Personally I think he’s good for you. You haven’t looked this happy since you and Marley dated,” she points at, moving about the front of the shop to close up.
“Good night Aby,” Harry replies, not minding that he is the little spoon as he settles back into Aby, quickly falling asleep.
"Yes he does have that sort of aire of annoying virtuosity about him but I can assure you that Harry Potter has more friends and admirers  than he knows what to do with so I'm certain he'll get over not becoming friends with the man he's paying to mark up his skin. I'm not friends with any of my other clients Jane, so I don't see why this is such a big to do?"
“Did getting your nipples pierced hurt? Do they have Jane charms on them?” Harry rushes to ask, wanting to change the subject from his ex.
Jane leans over, pulling him into a hug. “I’m sorry Aby. I’m sorry you can’t let Harry reunite you with your Mum. But...I don’t think that you should push him away. For some reason he seems to think like us, and I’m sure he doesn’t hate you and he wants to be around you,” she murmurs as she looks down at the tattooed blonde and smoothes his hair back from his face.
Harry takes in the words and frowned. “Do you not want me to come back to you then?” Harry asks softly, a look of sadness mixed with frustration on his face as he stands before Malfoy.
“Apology accepted,” Harry replies flatly, his gaze still on the blonde. What was it about Malfoy that had him unable to keep his eyes off him all of a sudden? “No tattoos on your legs?” he asks suddenly, as he realizes he’s been staring shamelessly.
“You seriously think I would hit on everyone? I’m not that kind of person, if that was the case I would hit on you,” Harry notes, dumping Malfoy’s shoulder in return.
Aby ignores his tone and pulls his stool closer to Potter’s arm to inspect the design, poking it a bit, before getting his tools out. He’d be doing the more gold detailing today as well as some anchor points. Dispensing the ink into his cup, Aby murmurs a spell over it, tapping the liquid, making it shimmer. “This gives it the beautiful swirling effect you saw in the photo,” he explains before beginning.
“It’s been less than a day. Now sit and let me show you what I have done. I don't think we can start today but if you like the design we can go write you down in the book - it’ll be after hours mind you," he added.
"Potter I'm not trying to get rid of you, just merely trying to get you off my ledger like I would any other customer. No need to spend your time waiting around the parlour," he shrugs.
Coming into the parlour, he starts the fire to get the place warmed up, and begins to prep for the day. He lays out the artist portfolios, charms the flashes on the wall to move, and looks over the bookings for the day. He’s on desk duty this morning and knows he’ll be dealing with a few random walkins who think a school holiday is a fantastic time to get something inked or pierced, despite their strict age restriction. The shop might be off of Knockturn but Michael and Jane prided themselves on running a respectable shop - well as respectable as they could given who works here and what they do for a living.
“I wasn’t going to ask, but I’m fascinated. I honestly never knew it was possible to do so much with magic involving pleasure until I listened to Jane go on about it,” he admits sheepishly, wondering if it would have made parts of his sex life better.
"Thank you. I had Luke do this one for me. It's for Severus. It's the first potion he ever showed me how to make and the script is his handwriting," he smiles fondly, missing his godfather.
“While I’m ready to see the finished product, I do like coming here. Everyone is nice and it’s an awesome shop,” Harry began, ignoring how clinical Malfoy was touching him.

Aby waves his wand to turn the music on, laying back to lounge on the floor, as Potter grins, being welcomed into their fold.
“Fifteen?” Harry whistles in astonishment. “That’s impressive. Do you plan on getting any more?,” he continues, fascinated that so much art was decorating someone he still views as rather traditional.
He nods at the blonde’s question and opens his eyes again, taking in the admittedly attractive man hovering over him. “Yeah, I’m ready. Do your worst, Malfoy,” he dares with a smirk.
"I think it'll be nice to have Harry around more," Jane adds with a smile, "now that Steph is usually out with Jocelyn. Pizza should be here soon and we can eat, by the way"
"Potter I essentially branded your skin. It’s going to hurt, magic or not,” he snorts, turning the page.
Harry walks into the shop on Wednesday around sunset for his rescheduled appointment. Seeing Jane behind the counter he smiles at her in greeting and leans against it before asking, “Does he know?”
Harry turns to face Luke upon being called out, and tries his best to keep his eyes off of Malfoy as he sits back down, putting the pizza boxes in the middle, to avoid pissing Luke off and ruining his chance at making new friends.
Harry doesn’t know how to respond, but turns his head a bit and catches sight of the record player in the corner. He doesn’t know much about muggle record players, but he knows enough that they don’t lend themselves to mixes.
“I don’t think I’d appreciate the snitch going over my prick, but other than that I think I’d be fine,” he chuckles.
Aby always enjoys sleeping in when he can, and finding himself wrapped around a warm body is even better. Nuzzling into the man's neck he takes him a moment to remember it’s Harry in his bed and he backs off a bit, opting instead to roll over on his back and stretch. He'll need a slight hangover potion soon, but he could be worse off.
“Well maybe he likes your work and he trusts you to take good care of him during the process,” she counters. “You know as well as I do that it’s important for you to trust your artist and have some sort of connection with them. And I haven’t known him for that long, but Auror Potter doesn’t seem to be the type of person to hold anything against you. He, well, he seems to be almost sickeningly good,” she admits. “Either way, he seemed very hurt that you were pushing him away.”
Aby begins to shake. Now his mother was standing up to his father, but not when it counted most, back when Lucius was trying to force him into a loveless marriage for status. “Just go Potter,” he states, pointing to the door, and turning away.
"Well it's going to hurt, not even magic can stop that. Depending on the kind of sex you have is what kind of piercing I'd recommend. For instance I tell guys who top other men to avoid some rings because it just doesn't work for sex," she explains, tapping the wall to reveal a diagram of his choices. "As for charms I can do anything from a contraception charm to lubrication to disease prevention.”
Aby dips his wand as Potter strips, and once he lays out, Aby start pricking his skin, starting at the snitch. He dots the anchors over Potter’s body, tracing a magical line between each point, giving the snitch it’s map. He has to keep a steady hand, making sure that nothing strays from the intended path. Once he gets down to his left foot he works his way up the right leg, using his navel as a central point for his lower body. Soon enough he’s having Potter turn over, repeating the process on his backside until the web is placed. With a final tap of his wand, his web disappears, the ink settling into Potter’s skin.
"No Potter I didn't think you'd enjoy getting your cock pierced but I didn't know your were doing that,” Aby spat back, ignoring the fact that his misconception was cleared up, and opted to run headfirst into an argument. “Just figured you two were having a moment alone and I was interrupting. After all you brought up how you're looking to date since you’ve got a lot of alone time. Playing the field and such playing the field, which you should certainly know Jane."
“You’re right Potter it isn’t any of your business. It’s been years, no one but her cared what happened to me, so let it rest. My mother wouldn’t want to see what her son became.” Aby doesn’t know how to respond rationally, especially because he didn't hate Potter anymore, not really, but the man was butting into things that he had no right to, especially if he was just planning on walking out of his life.

“Why? This is nice though. Why...why do you keep pushing me away? I know I’m not your type but I thought I was decently attractive at least,” Harry asks him, sounding a bit petulant.
"You are more than decently attractive Potter believe me. But we just started becoming friends..." He begins, and wonders if Potter just thinks this is an easier route to get into his pants since Aby has said he fucks his friends.
Harry frowns a little, shaking his head at the blonde, his mind fuzzy. “No...no, I didn’t think you wanted to fuck me. And you won’t cock anything up,” he assures, biting his bottom lip in anxiety.
“Yes well, I er, was worried that if I told you how often I saw you mum you’d get angrier. I meant what I said about your Mum being a lovely woman who could keep a secret. Her lunches with me is one of her ways of standing up to your Father nowadays” Harry replies, smiling fondly as he thanks about Narcissa.
“So again, where you do want it to flit? When I did Ben’s tattoo, it was just across the shoulders and down his arms. But I can do it wherever you like.”
“A combination? I usually go to release energy whether it's through jumping around like a lunatic or getting a blowjob in the backyard," he smirks.
The first band ends, and the blonde is still at his side, clearly pleased that Harry was decently fit and buying him drinks. He excuses himself to the loo, but the blonde follows him, pressing him into a wall for a quick makeout. He pulls off to catch his breath and catches the eye of the man passing them to get to the toilet, and the colour drains from his face. He gets pulled back to attention when the man presses against him and says he’ll meet Harry back at the bar, leaving Harry to walk into the toilet to face Malfoy. Luck is on his side though as the bathroom is just a series of single stalls, and he can maybe avoid Malfoy until next week if he was lucky.
“Right before we get started where do you want it to go? I don’t know if you read the blurb that came with the flash but it does more than just flap. It flits about, and it stops.”
“Yeah, Hermione really is trying to make it easier for people like your friends,” Harry says, not mentioning the resistance she was meeting from some of the older generation.
As soon as Potter walks out of his station, Aby cast a muffliato over his station and begins to sob. He misses his mother the most and to think she was moving on without him was bittersweet. To know she lunches with Potter, stands up to his father for Potter but not Aby when he needed it, was heartbreaking.
Harry eyes the man that Malfoy led out of the back, frowning at him for a moment before turning back to give Jane a wink. “She wasn’t corrupting me. I can deal with a little flirting, Malfoy,” he teases as the blonde walks back to his station.
At the end of the night, Aby walks Harry to the floo. "Get home tonight Potter and you know where to find me if you want to chat or hang out. And perhaps you can think for a moment before you let Jane attack your cock with a needle."
Aby waves them off hoping they don’t actually try and take Potter home as it would be rather annoying. Though the image of Harry between two men certainly did something for him as he wanders down to the basement.
Harry balks for a second as Malfoy calls him charming, but snaps out of it as he continues to yell. “I’m not trying to get you caught by Lucius, I want that motherfucker in Azkaban where he belongs. I want to help you and your mum both be free,” he shouts back. “I don’t care that you’re a poof and I don’t care about your bloody past, I just want to be around you. I don’t know why I do, because you haven’t been anything other than nasty to me, but I want to be your friend, and I know I won’t get you caught,” he insists.
"Dead? Ah well Lucius did want to kill me so I take it if he couldn't do it physically he'd do it so I couldn't have a claim to the vaults. Fair enough," he shrugs, though it stung a bit to think that most people he once knew thought he was living six feet under rather than down the road a ways in London.
Aby hates that he pinks a little upon seeing one very fit, shirtless Auror in his station. Clearing his throat, he instructs Potter to sit down, and discusses placement with him, settling on his bicep.
Aby is thankful he is already the kitchen already for that compliment as he could feel the blush taking over his face, despite how corny it is. "As sweet as that is Potter, you're rather drunk for us to do more than cuddle," he balances, not wanting to turn Harry down completely unsure of how drunk Harry reacts.
He hated that he wasn’t able to interview Astoria back then, knowing that she would have been the piece that tied it together perhaps, but her parents put up barrier after barrier, and by then it was just Harry tracking down leads.
Jane playfully swats at him from across the desk at the wink. "Oh you, stop. Now off with you and I'll talk to Aby. See if he'll at least finish your tattoo if nothing else."
Out in the front, Harry walks to the counter, feeling dejected. “Hey Jane, I need to pay. He’s done. How much for the last session?,” he asks, barely sparing her a glance as he opens his wallet and begins counting out money. He wants nothing more than to go back in there and demand that this not end now. Problem was, he doesn’t even know what this is. The blonde has given him no indication that he wants to be friends, all Harry knows was that he really likes spending time with him and being rejected fucking sucks.
"No problem," he shrugs, not genuinely minding, turning on the ceiling fan to keep Potter cool during the night before slipping under the covers. "My shift isn't until noon so if you need to set an earlier alarm I don't mind."
“Thanks again Malfoy. I’ll see you in two weeks then I guess,” he murmurs, giving him a small smile before he excuses himself.
It took a second for Harry to process, his eyes widening at his conclusion. “Wait...Seriously? You all can charm tattoos like that?”
He smiles as he walks into the shop, greeting Jane before checking that Malfoy wasn’t busy with a customer before heading back to his station.
Aby waits for the protest but none comes. Instead Potter was pulls a small diary from his robe pocket, looking at the weeks ahead. “Yeah I think I can make that work. I mean how far apart do they need to be?”

“I don’t think I’ve done anything to give you the impression that I want to be out of the parlour...or at least I hope not,” Harry replies quietly. “I mean I come a bit early to talk to Jane, I ask questions, and honestly, you’re not the Malfoy that I remember. It’s weird and intriguing. You’re Abraxas now and I find myself wanting to get to know you, despite you clearly not wanting to,” he continues, blushing slightly as he makes eye contact with Malfoy.
Once inside the topic of magic tattoos dies down, focusing on what kind of alcohol to get, settling eventually on a bottle of whiskey and vodka so that they would both have something to bring.
“That was oddly thoughtful of him. Sorry, I just sometimes wrap my head around your Severus and my Professor Snape,” he admits. “But can’t you just cast one of your own as reference?”
“No, he swapped it for his usual. Another one that I made, mind. Cheeky slag,” she tacks on, playfully, not noticing the way Harry turned red at that information.
It was about an hour after he opened that Jane wanders downstairs, yawning and holding a coffee out for him.
“Cheers. Tell him if he does it again I’m going to leave snow in his office,” he threatens, through sips of the warm beverage. “Or worse make him deal with customers. By the way I’m on desk until one it seems, then I have a three hour session. But I was wondering if you have time tonight to work on our project? I brewed the antidotes,” he grins, to which Jane immediately shakes her grogginess to jump and hug him enthusiastically.
"What's going on?" he murmurs, instinctively pulling his friend to the couch to curl around him, once he sees his wrung out demeanor.
"I guess I can allow it...” he begins with a small smile, before leveling a stern look at Potter. “Just please don't bring up my old life unless I do first. I need time to think about everything and I don’t like thinking about things out of the proper space. But I understand what it's like to feel alone, and you mentioned you haven’t exactly had a social life lately...so if you want friends, even if it's with degenerates like us, who am I to tell you no. After all you saved my life."
Aby leans into Jane letting her comfort him as it seemed to be the week for his friends to do that. He never showed his much emotion growing up but learned that was not the way to do things any more. "I doubt he thinks like us, but if you want me to do this tattoo so he stops being a nuisance I will. Just to show you that we won't be seeing Harry Potter here again."
“Look, I just wouldn’t even know what to ask for,” he insists. “Not all of us have had the experiences that you apparently have if you can just go in there and ask for what you want, Aby,” he teases.
“This is going to be wicked once it’s all done,” Harry compliments, still staring at the ink as Malfoy leaves the room.
"No I don't mind. I've shared a bed with plenty of friends just because that's all the space there was. Also sometimes because cuddling is great," he adds, walking towards his room and gesturing for Harry to follow.
“Jane when did Potter reschedule?” Aby asks, looking at her seriously. “Luke said he did but that he didn’t see him on the ledger.”
"No, only the mild pain potion from earlier I’m afraid. Don’t feel particularly keen on you passing out or worse,” he drawls, looking up at Potter, who looks confused. “I can’t have you block the pain entirely because I need to know how your body is handling it. Things like shock, low blood sugar, or just a bad reaction can happen with more than a mild potion. I need to be able to monitor you,” he explains, remembering the lessons from his ex, a muggle tattoo artist.
Aby laughs, not feeling much beyond mild disappointment, but understands. "Yes, yes you slag I understand. Thank you for the snog as always. Enjoy Charlie tonight. I'm heading out as I’ve got no one to pull for the night,” he sighs dramatically.
"I offered, but he's at home tonight working on these muggle toys he likes to collect. Tiny models you glue together and paint. Very tedious but he enjoys them, bless."
"I was with just Marley for a bit. And there have been times where I've gone out on dates with a guy a few times in a row, but I haven't found anyone that makes me want to settle down," he shrugs. "I don't really need to and if it was with a muggle I'd have to give up a lot. Though I certainly considered snapping my wand once or twice and just integrate into the muggle world."
Wiping some of the blood that rose up again, he pauses to dab at his face and cast a cooling charm in the room. It was comments like Potter’s that makes Aby to never roll up his sleeves during work hours. It didn’t matter how stuffy it got, he didn’t move those buttons until the doors were closed for the day.
It was a week later that Harry walks back to the shop, taking a deep breath as he steels himself for the consult, only to have his world turned upside down when he sees Draco Malfoy standing in front of him.
"Alright I'll get started on that. Going to start with the stasis charm so you can go about in the muggle world without breaking the statute,” he narrates.
“Thanks for the offer to have Michael do it, but honestly I’ll just move it to another day,” he chooses, feel a bit dejected. “I don’t know what happened,” he begins, feeling the need to talk to someone about it since his friends don’t know about Malfoy, and if he brought up even his name, Ron and Hermione would give each other a knowing look Harry wasn’t fond of. “We both wound up at the same bar Friday night and ended up walking out together. We talked, I called him out for avoiding me, I mentioned his mum and he ended up saying that he didn’t want me to waste my time with...someone like him,” he paraphrases, the epithet ringing in his ear.
Harry slips back into silence, until he heard the clack of the tongue ring again. The stupid bit of metal was driving him mental. Add on what Jane said earlier and Harry finds himself blurting out, “What other piercings do you have?”
“Friends?” Aby parrots back, putting down his wand. “We couldn’t be friends Potter. Nevermind the whole war thing, and the years of animosity,” he begins, “but how do you even think that would work? Seriously Potter, think about it? You can't loiter here and I certainly can't be coming to yours. Sure there is muggle London but I have my own life and it's worked so far. I think you could do a lot better in terms of friends than someone like me and the people I hang around," he spits out.
"She's a very good friend of mine and is more like a protective sibling than anything else,” he clarifies, trying to steady his hand so he could get back to tattooing. "Someone can speak highly of their friends without wanting to shag them Potter."
"Potter your history indicates otherwise," Aby points out, remembering each time in school Potter ran head first into something.
"It's fine, we've both had a lot to drink,” he assures, passing Harry his steeping tea. “Just crash on my bed. I promise it's comfortable enough. If you want, I can even sleep in Luke's bed. Goodness knows that were has used me as a teddy bear enough times."
But now, with his informant, he’s been able to amass a nice collection of data on the illegal trade Lucius has now been participating in to keep the Malfoy estate a float. A few more months and perhaps one more witness, and he knows he can put Lucius in Azkaban where he belongs.
