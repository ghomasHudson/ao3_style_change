His plan worked until he put foot on the other side of the lava lake. Once again, he felt a sting in his neck and suddenly something was flying in a circle around him before disappearing somewhere in the very big chamber. A moment later, the ground was shaking. The lava was rising, fire balls spurting wildly out into the air. Harry quickly ran forwards to Carpet who still was waiting with Abu on it. As soon as Harry had jumped onto the carpet, they were all speeding back through the cave, heading to the exit. Behind them, they could constantly hear the fire crackle behind them, quickly spreading after them.
He doesn’t know. He needs to know. I open my mouth to break the news, but no words come out. Instead I feel tears start trailing down my cheeks, an overwhelming sadness filling me up and it gets hard to breath. I sob and cough.
Harry didn’t even find it in himself to answer. He still had to let the view of the prince in front of him sink in. Had he thought the man was beautiful
Smiling, he tilted his head slightly upwards and pressed his lips onto Draco’s. When they broke apart, Lucius was nowhere to be seen. They were alone. Draco initiated another kiss, and when that ended, another one followed and then another one. Until they are interrupted by some jealous chattering. Beside them, were Abu and Carpet, and they both wanted to know what had happened after Harry had run into the palace to save everyone.
“We are here because we’re searching for something. An old oil lamp. Do you know where we can find it?” The carpet nodded frantically, happily waving for Harry to follow him before speeding off further into the cave. Then it was gone. Harry sighed to himself, before shouting into the tunnel for the mat to come back.
Tentatively, Draco started to push his fingers through Albus hair, and he felt the child immediately relax a bit more. The haunted expression started to slowly — extremely slowly — melt away.
Jafar’s smile was cruel and in his eyes glimmered a fiery hatred. Despite the fear that this put in Harry’s heart, he took a small step forward so that Draco stood slightly behind him, protected.
That was what Harry found when he apparated into Draco’s little house. Albus sleeping with a smile on his face, and the notes of his favourite lullaby coming out of Draco’s mouth. Suddenly, it wasn’t just Draco’s heart that had melted that evening.
, and they left Draco standing in the doorway with his mouth hanging wide open as they started up the movie.
, he’s having a moment!” I shout and rush out of the room. Obviously, Potter apprehends exactly what I mean as he’s quickly following me. Frantically we run through the castle. We look through every room and alcove, desperately trying to find our friend. We have made our way through half the school when I hear Potter shout ‘I know’ behind me before he turns and sprints the other way. Without skipping a beat, I do the same and dash after Potter.
At once, all Jafar’s evil spells were lifted. Draco and Genie were free of their chains, and Lucius was once again wearing the turban of a sultan. The sun shone in through the grand windows; the dark clouds that previously shadowed the palace had dispersed and everything was back to normal.
“I already know,” Lucius interrupted. “Jafar accidentally told me in one of his grand monologues. About how he had gotten rid of the diamond in the rough, the street rat that pretended to be royalty:Harry Potter.”
“I know I’ve only met him once, but it’s something special about him. I think… I think I’m falling in love with him.”
“No,” Harry said. “You can do that yourself. Because I told you from the beginning, I was going to use my last wish to set you free. And that’s what I’m going to do. Genie, I wish you to be free.”
Suddenly it all stops. At first I think it’s because I’ve finally passed over, I have died. But then I realise that I feel the pain of all the stinging hexes and I’m still laying on the floor of Malfoy Manor’s Dining Hall. I open my eyes… and I meet a pair of blue eyes.
him.” He put his hand on the lamp and rubbed. Just like when Harry did the same, there was a small explosion which was followed by Genie appearing in front of them.
“Yeah so… this is Abu. He’s my… comrade and my best friend. And I’m Harry, but I guess you already got that figured out since you heard the palace guard before. And yeah… what’s your name?”
taking off the hood, it was nothing compared to now. No shadows hid his silver eyes or his porcelain skin. The light rays that shone through the doorway bounced upon his cheekbones, illuminating perfect angles and Harry was doomed. A thousand thoughts rushed through Harry’s mind and he couldn’t make sense of any of them. Still confused, he let the guards cuff him and then lead him off towards the palace dungeons.
Harry blushed and nodded, before letting go of Draco’s hand so that the prince could run his errands. When he was out of sight, Harry decided that it was time to go inform his friends what had happened. He went out to the back garden where he found Abu being cared for by several servants. The little monkey seemed to be enjoying his situation immensely, but as soon as he saw Harry, he jumped to greet him.
“I’ll never get used to that.” Harry muttered to himself. In fact, it really scared him to even think about ever being able to marry Draco if it meant he would become a sultan. He shook the thought out of his mind in order to be able to focus on his present situation. He asked Abu if he knew where Genie was, but when the monkey shook his head in response, the two of them proceeded to walk around the palace grounds searching for him. That’s when everything suddenly turned black.
It’s been two months since he got “stable”. Since they said all that could be done further on was wait. Wait and wait and wait even more.
welcome that. He clung to the pain, in his mind reaching forward to it, not ready to let it go as the pictures started to appear in front of his eyes. The physical pain left him, and he was left cold, helplessly falling through nothing until...
But now that he thought back on it, he realised that he had recognized the voice of the prince. It had been Harry. But that didn’t make any sense, because Harry was no prince and Jafar had said that Harry was… dead. Yet, Draco was sure that the voice had been the one belonging to the young man that had saved him two days before.
He wasn’t scared of spiders, not really. If he was, it would’ve been pretty stupid to get one as a pet. But now here he was standing in a dark, dark, dark room, with a locked door somewhere behind him, and everywhere around him, tiny hairy legs prickled back and forth, completely losing his mind.
Harry found Draco in the grand lobby, where he was playing around with Rajah. Without knowing why, Harry was taken over by a strong urge to hug the prince, so he crossed the floor in long strides and promptly embraced the other man. When Draco asked what it was for, Harry just shook his head and kept his hold on him. What would he have answered anyway? He didn’t really
The guard did as he said he would. After casting a warning glance at the newly dehanded man, he led Harry and the stranger out of there. They kept walking until they came to a less busy part of the street.
“Yes.” Draco’s father answers simply. “Draco has told me that you have ordered a man arrested without consulting me about it. That is not acceptable, Jafar.”
“Mister Harry Potter, sir. What will your pleasure be? Please believe me when I tell you, you ain’t never had a friend like me.”
“Do you know how many dark spells and potions and books I had to dig through and use to get you back?!” Draco’s voice was acidic, it was hard to imagine he was actually happy that he had saved Harry.
When they got closer, Harry asked Carpet to slow down. They’d need to sneak inside without being seen, or they’d have no chance in saving Draco and his father. Or the rest of Agrabah’s population for that matter. They had to be extremely careful.
“Harry Potter, I’ve come to take you to your destiny,” he said, his voice incredibly deep. It sent shivers down Harry’s spine just to hear it, and it made him sick to try to understand the meaning of his words.
“Yeah, you see those wristbands? They’re actually magical handcuffs that bonds me to the lamp, and by that, to whoever temporarily frees me from it. But even then, I’m still bound to the lamp. The only way I can be truly free is if my master uses one of their wishes to make me free.”
“No! But father, I have found someone. I have chosen Prince Harry!” Draco desperately tried to beg to his father, but his eyes were blank, unresponsive. Draco sprang forward, placing two trembling hands upon his father’s chest, fiercely looking into Lucius’ eyes.
“Aah, hi there Abu. You alright, buddy?” he greeted the monkey who swiftly climbed up to sit on Harry’s shoulder.
Suddenly, the shouted insults are drowned out by a loud crash. The boy had run up a pile of wooden boxes, and in the rush accidentally sent a barrel falling onto the guards.
Jafar snarled and shoved Draco onto the ground. “Genie! I wish for you to make Draco fall in love with me!”
Harry kept telling the man stories about his life, different adventures he had experienced with Abu, as they shared the fruit that Abu had knicked before. In return, the stranger opened up little by little, told more about himself but still without really telling who he was. Every word he said though sent warmth into Harry’s heart and he just couldn’t find it in himself to stop watching the other man while he spoke. His voice was soft, and his words enchanting.
Harry’s expression darkened slightly, but he still answered. “No, I didn’t. My friends had learned how to sleep through them when we still were at Hogwarts and before that… no one cared enough about my wellbeing. So I’m making sure Al never feels that way. But I’m not sure I’m succeeding.”
Harry grabbed the man’s hand and turned to flee the scene. But. His path was blocked. By the palace guard.
If possible, everything around him got even darker, he couldn’t see anything. The darkness felt heavy upon his shoulders, crushing him to the ground. His knees buckled, once. Twice. Three times before they gave up completely and he fell to the ground.
Suddenly, Harry wasn’t falling anymore. As he slowly opened his eyes he saw that he was sat on the magic carpet once again. But Abu was nowhere to be seen!
At last, his words seemed to have an impact for suddenly he was overthrown by a… flying mat! Harry let out a small laugh as he watched the carpet. It acted so incredibly happy to have met Harry, it made his heart melt a bit.
“Great!” Blaise says cheekily. “Hurry up. Potter and Draco went out ten minutes ago. We wouldn’t want them to be alone out there for too long, now would we? And we can’t really expect Dean or Seamus to split them up…”
It's ironic, because when my gaze finally meet green eyes, I cry again. Those green eyes that are what I’ve been waiting for. Those green eyes that show me that everything will finally be alright. Those green eyes that are perfection.
“Draco, my darling, I understand that you are upset, but so am I. I, however, am not upset about some incorrect arrest. Right now, I’m mostly grieved by the fact that you
“That was beautiful,” Harry whispered, causing Draco to jump slightly. “Seems you don’t need my help after all.”
That was the only thing he regretted, making Draco hurt like this. But he also knew the hurt would pass, that Draco would be better off without him.
“May I kiss you, the way I’ve dreamed of before?” He asks, and I nod even before he has finished the sentence.
I sit by his side day out and day in. I forget to eat, so it’s a good thing Mother comes by every other day with a small basket. I forget to sleep, but there’s nothing she can do to help me with that.
Without warning, the flying carpet spun around him and made Harry fall upon it and then they were flying off together. All the turmoil had Abu fully woken up and Harry suddenly had to calm a very confused and scared monkey as well as try to keep his balance upon a flying carpet. Once he’d mastered the flying, it got a lot easier to explain to Abu what was happening and soon after they were both profoundly enjoying the ride.
Soon after, he heard the rustling of Abu following him. The monkey once again took its place on Harry’s shoulder.
Soon, we’ve accidentally started a full on snowball war, three against three. Me, Blaise and Seamus versus Harry, Malfoy and Dean. By now, it’s long since everyone else left us to finish the work on the igloo as it is almost done anyways. And our playful fight probably scares most of the other students off. No one – except maybe Neville, ‘Mione and Ginny – dares to have a fight with any of us. We’re the ultimate war heroes, after all. At least us Gryffindors. The Slytherins are just scary as hell.
“This is where you live? Alone?” When Harry only nodded in response he continued, “Where are your parents? You don’t seem to really be old enough to live on your own.”
By the time they returned, the entire palace had woken up. Servants were running about, taking care of bushes in the gardens or pushing trails of food through the corridors. Draco and Harry just ignored it all as they sneaked through the palace in to Draco’s room.
a coward. He is one of the bravest people I know. And I know you, so that’s saying something. He is also very strong. I mean, he braved literal hell, and still kept his kind soul. Yes, it’s tainted from that
When I finally realised that this wasn’t true, I cried for days on end. It didn’t matter how many food baskets Mother brought, I wouldn’t eat. Couldn’t do anything but let my tears fall and my sobs shake through my chest.
Finally, Draco relaxes. He leans into Potter’s touch and I let out the breath I must’ve been holding for a moment. I’m feeling lightheaded and I
Hermione hasn’t been here more than a handful of times. Probably because, just like me, she thinks Harry looks too lifeless, and she can’t bear the sight.
, I find myself feeling small, only because I know that Ron is towering over the rest of us if he’s in the room. And despite it causing me to feel vulnerable, I am drawn to him in a way I can’t explain. I
He slowly paced forwards along the street, curiously watching the goods and foods each stand was selling. Whenever something piqued his interest a bit more than normal, he’d stop by and make sure to buy something. With his wealth, he was determined to give some of it to people that clearly needed it more than he did. Dinner and clothes from India: a common sari jama, a deep bandhgala suit, an angarkha, some handmade jewellery.
It lasted half a year. Then he died again. And he simply didn’t let himself wake up again, because he had failed. He betrayed him. He didn’t deserve the happiness he had started to feel by Draco’s side the past months. So he chose the right thing; to leave him behind.
The hurt that cut through Draco’s heart at these news were completely unaccounted for and Draco quickly sped out of the room to hide in his quarters and let himself cry out the pain without anyone watching.
“I, what?” the man drawled, clearly not seeing who Harry truly was. Quickly, Harry came up with a reply to save the moment.
The man snorted in response to show his disdain in Harry’s displayed self-confidence, but something in his eye told that he didn’t quite believe what Harry was saying.
Harry slides one of the silver bands onto my finger. I put the other one on his, smiling as I can feel warmth even in his fingertips.
He hated himself for it. He saved the world, he was the youngest Commander Auror ever, he was the Chosen One, and he couldn’t even handle a bunch of spiders.
He lost all sense of time as he walked along corridor after corridor, the pathway constantly surrounded by different kinds of treasures. But he still hadn’t seen the lamp. He felt Abu stirring beneath his vest, a telltale sign of the monkey being close to waking up. But that wasn’t the only sensation he got. Harry also had the feeling that someone was following him. When passing an alley of expensive-looking mirrors, he quickly snatched a silver hand mirror which he used to watch behind his back while he still kept walking through the cave in search of the lamp.
He would’ve loved to help with this, only he and George would surely have built in several unknown traps and other pranks. Then, when it was done and the first person went in…
However, now that I am the only one who knows, Potter has made it his mission to drive me mad about it. Constantly. And right now is no exception. We are alone in the Common Room, he, Draco and I. Though, the two of them aren’t sitting too close to each other, knowing that anyone can come in through the entrance door at any time, Potter still fires off enquiries every other minute to hint at what only I know. What’s even worse, Draco has started to do the same! And worse still, they’ve taken to
But Jafar’s question had made Harry realise something: he wanted power. There was nothing that mattered to this man except power. Now Harry just needed to come up with how to use that against him.
“Well, he did ask for you,” Draco hummed, “but it took some time for you to come, so he asked me to sing. I didn’t know that… you never had anyone help you through your nightmares…?”
each other, they are actually really cute, and Potter clearly cares for Draco a lot. In the way he touches Draco’s shoulder ever so lightly to get his attention while doing homework together, or the way he watches the blond with soft eyes when the latter has fallen asleep on the loveseat in front of the fireplace, it shows that all this isn’t just a casual affair to him. It isn’t something he’ll be sure to drop as soon as he can – or as I first had feared, as soon as it’d hurt Draco the most to lose him. It’s real to him. And to Draco too.
“You better ask him about it. He’s the one that found you. He’s the one that spent months searching for the right spells and potions. He’s the one that preserved you, kept you safe. He’s the one that reached out to me when he couldn’t cast the spells because he couldn’t stand losing you. That’s not something you do to someone who’s just your partner.”
what it was for. It was just something he had to do. By just standing there, so close to Draco, Harry felt all tension leave his body. He was with Draco and everything was going to be fine. Draco had promised that, and Harry trusted him.
“Yes, it’s exactly that obvious!” The two of them share a look, before Draco promptly stands up from his armchair and they leave the room together. Naturally, everyone misses the quick peck Potter puts on Draco’s cheek, because they are too busy watching me die of embarrassment. Those bloody lucky bastards.
Harry whistled a short tune and all of a sudden they were standing next to a hovering carpet. He smiled at Draco, grabbed his hand firmly.
He was back. Back where it all started, where his pain did nothing to save the lifeless body of his older schoolmate. Back where the voice he hated became constant in his life. He was back in the first moment he blamed himself for someone’s death.
Christmas is here, at last, and it's time to meet Draco and Harry some more. And the Weasleys. Merry Christmas everybody!!!
In the dining hall all the other Death Eaters are assembled around the grand table, The Dark Lord sat on the very end of it. He turns to me when I enter.
“Yes, I know all of that, my son. But you’ll turn nineteen soon, and I’m retiring, which means you’re about to take over as sultan, but to do that, you’ll need to get yourself a marriage!”
I don’t know what his hope was, who his hope laid upon, who he believed could save the world. But I know that I was too late to let him see it, to make his dream come true. So I owe him. I’ve made up my mind.
Chuckling a bit over that thought, I answer, “No, I suppose we wouldn’t. That would be quite disastrous. Let’s hope they haven’t hexed each other into oblivion already.”
As the sun sets, we finally let ourselves fall onto the soft snow. All of us are completely exhausted and I happen to know that Dean is completely drenched from all the snow that Seamus
“My apologies, your majesty,” Harry said as he took a small step away from Draco, “I should have kept my distance. It won’t happen again.”
They all went to Harry’s room and sat down on his bed. Then Harry and Draco told their stories and ended them with telling their two dear friends that they’d be wed the day after.
Lucius immediately called for his guards to arrest Jafar, but merely had the guards got their hands on Jafar’s shoulders before the man threw a vial at the floor. The room was suddenly filled with smoke and when it dispersed, Jafar was nowhere to be seen.
Time went on, the sunrays burning Harry’s skin until he felt as grilled as the scorpions they sold in the market. But the closer the day got to night, the less Harry felt the burn. He was consumed by a much greater pain. The past couple of hours, he had entertained himself with thoughts about what Jafar might be doing to Draco and his father. He imagined one horrible fate after the other that Draco could possible be living through, and it made Harry hurt more than anything.
Ron was lying, surely. Draco didn’t care about him. Besides, it couldn’t be true, he hadn’t been dead for
Seamus is for not having used the opportunity he was given that night in the snow house, because obviously he and Dean like each other, but they’re too blind to realise it. I snicker a bit to myself and roll my eyes because, really, it’s Ron who is too oblivious to realise that they already are a couple, only that their dynamics are such that they’re no different from how they were before they got together. I see a knowing expression on Potter’s face and I know he’s thinking the same as I am. Strange, isn’t it, how similar he and I are in some ways? How alike our trains of thoughts are?
The three friends flew as fast as they possibly could over the dunes, across the desert. The wind whacked Harry in the face but he didn’t care. All that mattered was coming back to Agrabah and Draco as soon as possible. Even though they were far away from the municipality, Harry could see the dark, ominous clouds that floated above the palace. Must they not be too late.
Barely had he gotten a couple of roofs away when he noticed a shadow quickly approaching him, causing him a brief sensation of fear to strike through his chest. After a quick glance towards it though, he immediately calmed down as he recognised it.
“It’s not that I don’t want to stay here with you. But, my father… I have to go back to him. I don’t really hate him. Or Agrabah, I just hate being locked inside the palace. To feel so trapped. Though I have a feeling that wouldn’t be as horrible if you were there with me.”
Out of the cloud of dust that followed the explosion, a man emerged. The man looked like any other man, except for the fact that his skin was tinted
He was shaken. Forcing his eyes open, he met a storm cloud grey glare, steely eyes looking at him angrily. He groaned.
At first Harry didn’t understand what the prince was referring to, but when he turned his head slightly and looked into those silver eyes of Draco’s, he realised it at once.
I take a breath and look down on the floor before starting. “You might or might not have noticed that Draco has some provoking characteristics, but I’m certain that you can understand that there are also other,
Yet, there was something in his heart that told him to not lose hope. It wasn’t the sound of the old man that had helped him as a kid, and it wasn’t the voice of his own head. The voice had a tone that reminded him of Draco, but it wasn’t quite right. But he trusted it. He trusted the voice, for it was all he could do. All he could do was hope, dream. Even when there was nothing left.
I end my monologuing there, knowing that throwing a curse mid sentence is the only way I can catch him off guard. I let the hate I have for him fill me up and I shout out the words.
Harry was stuck in chains beneath the palace. Ironic, wasn’t it? He finally got what he always wanted, he had reached his dream, yet it had turned into a nightmare. Everyone knew only the worst criminals got into the palace dungeons and they never stayed there for long. It was too dangerous for the sultan to have murderers in his home. No, they were quickly taken care of, and Harry feared what was about to happen to him. Sure, he wasn’t the most honorable man, but he wasn’t evil. He was still just a kid, he didn’t deserve to
It couldn’t be true, because if it was, Draco was running headfirst into his own grave. People who loved Harry ended up dying, being tortured, being hurt worse than what most people could imagine. He had to make Draco realise he couldn’t love him.
I plan to ask him to stay with me, but as my mind and mouth really doesn’t want to cooperate today, what comes out instead is, “Protect me.”
“Yes, sir, now, I demand you to let this go as well as giving me an answer. Who. Ordered. Harry. To. Be. Arrested?”
The man proceeded to tell Harry about different things that he could grant Harry, if he only wished for it.
He made the mistake of meeting Ron’s eye again, and he realised he was the one that was lying to himself. And he hated himself even more. He hurt Draco. Badly.
“It’s okay, my dear, no need to apologise. Come here,” Draco gestured for the boy to take place beside him on the bed. “Now, I’m not gonna ask you to tell me about the dream, because I don’t want you to relive it. But I have something I want to ask you. Do you want to go home? I know Scorpius would understand. And it is okay to want to go home and sleep in one’s own bed after a nightmare. I’m sure Po– Harry would be alright to come get you no matter what.”
“No, that’s alright. I don’t want to go home. But… maybe it would be nice to talk to him…? Dad, I mean.”
The man, who was walking next to Harry, once again looked bewildered at Harry. “Me? What would I wish for? In all my years as a genie,
“Actually, I don’t have to do anything. You have trapped yourself in this, you see. Because when you became a genie, the prescription came with a side note, but I don’t suppose you read that, did you? This is how it is: A genie can only grant the wishes of others. A genie can only obey its master, not itself. A genie is
After dinner, they had all settled to watch a movie. This was when the two youngsters once again surprised Draco. Draco had expected them to argue with him about seeing some action movie with lots of fighting in it that they were too young to see. But they immediately chose to watch
hopeless! And ironic. Almost all his life had been about finding enough food to stay alive, to not starve. He had gotten good enough at stealing to not really have to worry about it too much. And now he was about to die from starvation anyways. Or dehydration. Ironic.
After dinner, I find myself once again sitting at the window in the boy’s dormitory. It’s still snowing. I still like it. It still numbs the pain a bit, it covers the scars. Then I hear Malfoy and Harry enter behind me, bantering as they always do. I turn towards them and smile. Snow may numb the pain, but friends and family heal it. And even with my loss, I have still gained even more. Fred isn’t here, me and ‘Mione didn’t work out, but I’ve got more friends now than ever anyway. After all, I can even get along with Malfoy for ten minutes without cursing him. Who would have thought, eh?
The footsteps came to a stop and Harry hesitantly raised his head to see who had come to see him. It was a tall man wearing a black turban and black drapings, decorated with wine red adornments.
At first, it worked, they got inside the palace without encountering any of the patrolling guards, and they quickly ran through the rooms to find the evil sorcerer. He was in the main hall, proudly residing on the throne while watching Lucius clean the room, and Draco was sitting on the floor beside him, holding out a tray of fruits for Jafar to eat. Draco was bound to chains that were attached to Jafar’s wrist, causing Jafar to control every move Draco made. Maybe it was jealousy, maybe it was the wish for vengeance of maybe it was just a sense of justice that made anger boil inside Harry at the sight.
“Won’t do that, twat. Only way you’re getting out of here is by me escorting you away. And I won’t let you do that until you’ve given me my saber back.”
“Alright, it’s your choice to believe it or not, I guess. But let me tell you. The story about this lamp is true, and you’re loss to not buy it.”
Before Harry could react, he was launched into the air by two heavily built guards who then started to drag him out of the building. Harry could hear Draco call after him, but he didn’t get the chance to answer before the doors to the room slammed shut between them and then he was outside the palace. He was thrown into a large cage placed on a wagon behind a horse. Right as he was put in the cage, the horse started forwards and all Harry could do was watch as the palace grew smaller and smaller the further away they went.
has ever asked me that. But it’s an easy question. There’s only one dream I’d ever want to come true. I want to be free.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Jafar said, though he didn’t sound sorry at all, “It’s already too late. Harry Potter, the street rat you’re talking about, was instantly sent away for his sentence. I’m afraid there’s no way he’ll ever come back.”
Closing his eyes, Genie raised his hand and snapped his fingers. Lightning struck through the room, from the entrance all the way through the air until it reached Jafar. A loud bang followed and then you could see that Jafar’s skin had gotten a new tint of purple in it.
Without skipping a beat, Draco reached for his wand and sent off a patronus to Harry. Then he looked back at the small boy next to him. He still looked a bit scared, with hunched shoulders and a look on his face that reminded Draco of how Harry had looked after the war. The look one gets from carrying the fate of the world on one’s shoulders. Draco felt his heart beat faster and heavier for every second that went by. Why did Harry’s child have that face?
“Hey, that’s cheating!” I hear Blaise shout behind me. I just laugh and continue to run out to the school yard. The rumor that Gryffindors are above cheating is just a rumor after all.
, you evershining star, you're the best for sticking with me on this and encouraging to keep writing and correcting errors and just being an amazing friend. thank you sooo much!
Lost in thought, the man didn’t notice the large man that approached him on his right side until the man was over him and snatched his small, black and gold leather bag.
do. I want to disappear, and silently curse the anti-apparition wards that the school has. Then I see Draco’s pompous smirk and I feel even worse. How dare he be content with this situation?! Potter starts to laugh deeply behind me and I groan. Can this even get any worse?
Over the day, every single one of my year-mates come and help with the snow-house. What started with just me, Malfoy, Harry, Blaise, Dean and Seamus, turned out to be something everyone wanted to be part of. Though not everyone stayed the entire day, it was still nice to see that everyone contributed with something. Some made snowballs, and some cast cold stasis charms to keep the walls intact.
“Who’s that for? Didn’t see you make it,” Ron says quietly, eyeing Harry a bit perplexedly. It isn’t like him to do things like this.
Now, this was something more interesting. You are never one to turn down a great story. You nod and settle down on the sand next to man.
“Just a little snack guys… and my name isn’t ‘street rat’, it’s Harry!” the boy shouted back nonchalantly before jumping onto a rooftop and speeding away from the scene.
give me that! Can we please have this argument sometime later? You have to speak with Jafar about —”
Harry felt his jaw drop, but he didn’t care. In front of him stood the prince of Agrabah! Clad in his famous golden turban as well as beautifully decorated thawb. Everyone knew that contrary to most royal families in the Arabic Countries, the Sultan of Agrabah loved to add swirling streaks of gold onto their otherwise plain thawbs, and the evidence of that was now standing right in front of Harry.
“That’s better,” he smiles, “I’ve always adored your high cheekbones, that tight jaw… would be a pity to let them face the ground where I can’t see them, wouldn’t it?”
What Harry found through the reflection had him stopping in his tracks immediately, though. He turned around but the
“Bullshit!” the man said. He snapped his fingers and a moment later they were all standing above the ground, in the desert with no cave walls surrounding them. “There you go! Now, you have two wishes left!”
“Yo, Weasley!” Malfoy shouts. “No time for daydreaming. You can’t just lay off and expect the rest of us to do all the work!”
Draco swung his leg over and climbed off of Harry. “Get up. We’re going to St Mungo’s. That charm should not have lasted this long.”
The sip he’d been about to swallow went down the wrong pipe and he coughed and spluttered, trying to clear his airway. Even striving to get a fresh breath, he still didn’t miss the firm slaps on his back. Finally, Harry was able to suck in a lungful of air and he glanced over to the same blond man as earlier, who was settling into a relaxed pose against the balcony railing.
“Lifting a pint from the table to your mouth doesn’t count as a workout, Harry,” Hermione accused, laughing.
“Normally he would be outside of your proposed budget, that is for sure,” Harry agreed. “But as I said, the fortuitous timing of him having two new television shows debuting provides us with a unique opportunity here. I have a contact in the Channel 4 marketing department and they have indicated that the channel would be open to negotiating a joint marketing venture that would split the costs.”
Draco crowded Harry against the wall, pushing him in against the layer of squishy loads. “Look at your pretty new trophies.” Draco reached over to squeeze one of the condoms between his fingers, distending it as he slipped his other hand down to slip down Harry’s crease. Harry hissed when Draco’s finger met its mark, the wrinkled rim of flesh puffy and raw from all the friction it had endured over the past few hours. “Are you ready for your reward now?”
Hermione and Harry exchanged a look and Harry nodded, indicating Hermione should share the next piece of information they’d managed to gather.
“None of the companies we contacted that are hosting the native ads was willing to provide us with the information of who purchased the ad, however, we did discover that all the articles eventually traced back to one of three websites that are stated as sources within the advertisement,” Hermione explained.
I let my phone write the dialogue bits in this one. I'm a little nervous posting this and admitting that some of this is what my phone predicted I would write...
“To help overcome this fear of the unknown, we give people something familiar: a celebrity chef endorsement. We will hire one of the most familiar faces in the culinary industry to develop a collection of brand new recipes.”
“Closer than mine, so your place it is.” Before Harry could say anything, Draco had stepped into the street to hail a taxi. Harry was just about to say that cabbies never stopped around here and they’d have more luck if they walked one street east when a taxi pulled over and stopped to pick them up.
“No, that’s our web designer… How do you know Lettice?” Draco asked, looking almost as confused as Harry did.
The box was wrapped in an iridescent purple wrapping paper that shimmered in a rainbow of colours as he moved the box in his hands, with a gauzy orange ribbon wrapped around it in both directions. Harry was pretty sure he knew who it was from, and his suspicions were confirmed when he flipped open the attached note to see the following in a large, loopy script:
“Good good,” Slughorn cast an assessing look over at Malfoy, who was currently biting the corner of one of his nails and then pulling back to study his progress. “You’re quite lucky to have Mr Potter here as a partner, Mr Malfoy. He’s got a real aptitude for potion-making.”
“Hey! I work out!” Harry protested. Well, he had a gym membership anyway. True, it may have been a while since he had actually used it.
There was a breakout of low sibilant sounds peppered from around the room as the members of the client party leaned over to speak to each other in low whispers. The head of the British Kale Growers Association, the BKGA, leaned over a fraction of an inch to listen to something from the young man beside him before nodding brusquely. “Say you
“Ouch! Relax! I’ve got a treat for you right here!” George sucked on his finger, easing the pain from the nip that Harry’s large white owl had just given him. Flipping the lid open on the box on the bookstand by the window, he grabbed a couple of treats and put them in the palm of his hand, holding it out to the impatient owl and letting it retrieve them at its own pace.
Ron nudged Harry with his elbow, wagging his eyebrows in a comical, suggestive way. Harry snorted. “Believe me, neither did I. I’m still not entirely sure how it happened. One thing I was standing here trying to order us our pints and the next thing I knew I was in the middle of a bridal bacchanalia.”
The rest of the elevator ride couldn’t have been more than a minute, but it felt like an eternity as Harry’s fingers pushed the plug deeper into the other man’s body, his back arched to present his arse for Harry’s desire. The doors slid open on the twenty-third floor and Harry was so focused on that thick plug that he didn’t realise at first that it was theirs, until the elderly woman turned towards them and said, “Is this your floor?”
“I hope neither of you was thinking of taking a holiday in the next few months,” Kingsley said. “Good work, you two.”
Harry struggled to get a hold on himself. He’d spent months wondering about who this man was and wishing he had a way to contact him, and now, here he was, delivered straight to Harry’s doorstep. Well, technically Harry had delivered himself to Draco’s doorstep, but no point quibbling over the minutiae.
, if people don’t take the time to actually read the article, then they’re not going to be inclined to pick up a bunch of kale when they’re doing their weekly shop,” Hermione added.
“Look at me.” When Harry didn’t comply, Draco repeated the instruction. Harry dragged his head around to meet Draco’s stare, his eyes already slipping into the look of animal need they took on when they played like this. Draco took hold of Harry’s chin, pinching the skin between his thumb and finger and waiting until he had Harry’s attention locked on him. “You’re not to come yet, do you understand me?”
Harry’s head appeared floating in midair as it emerged from that blasted invisibility cloak of his and then fell as the prat doubled over in laughter.
“A little assistance?” Draco asked, his voice silky as Harry realised that he was staring unabashedly at Draco and cleared his throat. Draco turned his head and leaned closer, bringing his face close enough that Harry could reach out and touch.
Turning back to Harry, she said, “I know a counterspell that should do the trick and then you and your husband can get back to your celebration. How does that sound?”
Harry turned back around when the yanking pull on his arm finally ceased and he found himself face-to-face with the bride, who was definitely blushing, but that was more than likely because of the alcohol they’d been consuming.
Harry jumped back in, hoping that even though they didn’t yet know who was behind the attack ads, Snape would be appeased by the new plans that he and Hermione had come up with for getting the sales numbers back up enough that he didn’t fire the firm. “I assure you that we’re working on tracking down the source of the websites and counter-ads, but in the meantime, if you’ll just give us a few more minutes, Hermione and I can share with you some of the ideas we have to counteract the drop in sales.”
Harry could hear the whooshing sound of Hermione letting out a long breath through the earpiece, but eventually, she said, “Well no, obviously that is highly unlikely. Still, you could have at least let me come with you.”
Harry groaned, shifting closer to the warm body in front of him. He’d only managed to catch about thirty minutes of sleep before being awoken, yet again, by his demanding erection. They had spent the last four hours fucking in so many configurations that Harry was beginning to lose count.
Harry nodded sheepishly as the women congratulated him and he tried to excuse himself from the ruckus. A large hand clapped on his shoulder and he turned with excitement, hoping to find the alluring man from earlier, but instead, he found Ron giving him a look of surprise.
“Yes, can you take these and take care of them?” Draco gestured to the bowl which now had a pile of tied-off condoms in it.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked. When Harry licked his lips and nodded, Draco smiled. “Good. Come give your Daddy a kiss and then we can get started.”
Harry groaned again and didn’t move for a minute and Draco wondered if Harry was going to fall asleep right here, but then he finally sat up and slipped on the jeans and sweater that he had worn to the club. Draco stood up, adjusting his eager erection before holding his arm out for Harry, who cuddled into his side, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
He grinned to himself as the escort’s hand slipped down to pull on his own cock; the man wasn’t quite as tired as he wanted Harry to think. “That’s it. Be a good little whore and make yourself come.”
“None of this is new,” Mr Snape looked unconvinced. “Though high in goitrins, it would require the consumption of at least one kilogram of raw kale a day for several months to consume enough to result in thyroid function disruption. And cooking or steaming the kale before consumption eliminates that risk.”
Forcing that thought aside, Harry wound his way through the crowded pub and towards the bar on the far side of the room. There was a crowd of people standing around, vying for the attention of the barkeep who, as Harry watched, tossed a bottle of clear alcohol in the air in an impressive spin before catching it upside down and running it across a line of shot glasses that were arranged on the bar. A rowdy hen do party squealed and clapped at the trick, but all Harry could think was that it was a shame so much booze was being wasted as it spilt over the top and between the shot glasses and left a wet puddle on the bar.
“Well, we’re still trying to get to the bottom of it, but it appears that someone may be launching a counter-campaign,” Harry stammered out. His confident swagger was long gone and he’d gone from expecting a promotion a few weeks ago to hoping beyond hope that he managed to keep his job.
Harry figured the Healer didn’t need to know all the specifics of the particular fantasy they were fulfilling as part of that celebration, so he left out the minutiae of the evening. “Since it was a special occasion, I decided to use a Priapo charm—I’m not as young as I once was,” he added. “And it doesn’t seem to be wearing off.”
“I guess this is my lucky day,” their final stud said, grinning. “Word’s spread around the club that you’ve got a hot as fuck little piece in here and everyone’s desperate to get a taste for themselves.”
“But I’m never going to do that. Do you know why?” Harry shook his head, bouncing against the springy wall. “Because I’m the only one that’s ever going to paint your insides with come. I don’t share my toys.”
Harry managed to control himself as they made their way up to the hotel room on the twenty-third floor that he had rented...mostly. An overwhelming tide of desperation and disappointment rushed through him when the elevator door that was just about to close and give them a few moment’s privacy reversed course and began opening again to allow an elderly couple to join them. They eyed Harry and his blond companion as they entered and Harry wondered what they were thinking, whether they could read the illicitness of their relationship all over their faces. But then the woman smiled kindly at him and he smiled back, realising he was being ridiculous: they were just two men standing in an elevator together.
“Aren’t hen nights generally, you know, women-only?” Harry asked as he used the napkin he’d been given with his drink to wipe off his own cheek.
Draco just sniggered. “That will teach you to challenge a Slytherin. It could have been worse; at least you’re a boxer man.” Draco pointed his wand at Harry and cast a warming charm that caused Harry to stop shivering before casting one on himself. “Come on. Let’s put that handy cloak of yours to use and team up on Granger,” Draco grabbed the front of Harry’s robes and pulled him in the direction of the castle.
“I’m aware. Do I need to remind you that you started it?” Draco said as he pulled himself up off the ground and began dusting off his robes.
Even with the dark lighting inside the pub, Harry was pretty sure his flushed cheeks must be visible to anyone that took the time to look at him. If there was any doubt about who she was talking about, it was dispelled a moment later when he felt Draco’s soft, slender fingers slip between his own as Draco turned and led Harry away without deeming to answer Pansy’s question.
“1:30?” Harry felt tension slip into muscles that had only moments ago been loose and pliant with satisfaction. “Harry, have you had that erection the whole time?”
“Fuck! Harry!” Draco shouted as he came for a second time that night. Harry was right behind him and he sprayed the back of Draco’s hand with yet another release as his engorged cock poked out from between Draco’s slick thighs.
Harry’s eyes crawled up that finger and along the attached arm, all the way up to the pale, perfect skin of the man’s face to find a wicked tilt of lips greeting him. Harry looked away quickly, clearing his throat, but he could still feel the piercing gaze of those eyes on him. Steeling himself, Harry hailed down the bartender once more and placed his order.
George held up one finger, holding off his brother as he scanned the contents of the letter. He frowned in confusion for a moment before his brow smoothed out and he laughed. “He says here that they didn’t work.”
They waited together in silence for a few minutes until the click of the door announced that they had their first taker. Draco eyed the man, who was probably a few inches shorter than him and looked like a surfer that had spent long hours out in the sun, his strawberry blonde hair long and slightly curly.
Draco realized he’d have to be cunning about this, and bucked up beneath Harry, making it appear as if he was trying to shake him off as he covertly slid his wand out from the holster on his forearm while Harry’s attention was distracted. As the wand slid into his grasp, he slowed his writhing and played the submissive, casting a wordless Wingardium Leviosa spell on the snowball he had dropped during Harry’s dirty attack on him.
At the words, the other man groaned, the reverberations travelling up Harry’s cock and his eyes rolled back in his head at the sensation.
“That’s the problem with these Muggle clubs. It will raise questions if we just disappear from the room without anyone noticing,” Draco said. When Harry just groaned in response, Draco chuckled. “Come on, sweetness. We just need to make it out into the alley and then I can Apparate us home.”
“You love this, don’t you, you little whore?” the man snarled as he jerked Harry’s cock in time with his own thrusts. Releasing Harry’s cock, his fingertips curved around Harry’s hips and dug in as he pulled Harry back to meet each of his pounding thrusts.
“If it will shut you up, I suppose. Your voice is like fingers down a chalkboard to me.” Draco stood up from his stool and jostled into Harry as he reached across to grab the small package of berries that Harry had collected.
Harry took another drink of his beer before grinning back at the other man; if he thought Harry was scared, he was about to find out how wrong he was. Harry took a moment to adjust himself before standing up—the last thing he needed was to broadcast his state of arousal with a tent in his trousers—before swaggering over to the other side of the bar.
“Nice to see you too!” George called after her before pulling shut the window. Carrying the wrapped parcel over to his desk just as a concerning cloud of black smoke came out of Fred’s cauldron from where he was working on his own desk, which faced George’s.
Suddenly Harry’s legs were clamped tightly around his waist and the world spinned as Harry flipped them both and straddled Draco’s prone body on the cold ground. The world around them grew fuzzy as the invisibility cloak slid down, draping across their bodies and shielding them from any prying eyes.
“Millie, take care of her, alright?” Draco turned to address the woman sitting closest to them, a dark-haired woman who looked much less thrilled to be there than the rest of the party attendees. Judging by the glass of what looked like ice water in front of her, Harry guessed that she was the designated driver for the evening.
“Or we could take both take the afternoon off and go back to your place and I can show my gratitude in another way,” Draco suggested, his lips brushing teasingly against Harry’s. His warm breath smelled of mint and Harry wondered whether he’d taken the time to brush his teeth when he went inside to get his coat.
“You’ve missed a spot. Just there,” Harry offered, pointing to Draco’s right cheek where there was still a streak of red lipstick smeared across the sharp cheekbone and making it appear as if Draco had broken out in an appealing blush.
Harry forced his head up to smile at Draco, his face relaxed and peaceful now that the intensity of the evening was ebbing. “I’m never too fucked out for you.”
“One of our biggest obstacles is getting people to overcome their fear of the unknown. Lettuce is comfortable and familiar for people, but they don’t know what to do with kale. It has a very different texture to it that could be an impediment to getting people to put that bunch into their trolleys on their weekly shop.”
“Ah, you’re right,” Draco said, raising his voice to be heard over the cacophony of voices filling the pub. Draco veered off to the left, pulling Harry in his wake and over to a banquet on the far wall where Harry recognised several women from the hen night crowded together around the table. There was an impressive collection of empty glasses scattered around the table. Pansy was now wearing a headband with a long, thin plastic penis on it, making her look like an erotic version of a unicorn, while her friends tossed rings at her, trying to get them over the penis horn.
The man gave Draco a quizzical look, as if he was trying to work out whether Draco was messing with him. “That’s weird, mate. Why?”
Their next fuck was rougher and wanted to spank Harry, who nodded his permission. Harry’s cheeks were pink with flush when the man penetrated him and gave Harry a hard, brutal fuck. Harry jostled forward into Draco’s chest as the other man drilled into him, the sharp slapping sound of skin on skin filling the room with each pump of the man’s hips. Draco watched for signs of distress from Harry, but there was no sign of their safeword on the other man’s lips.
“You’ve been such a good boy for me, taking all those cocks. You just have to hold on for a little while longer. Can you do that for me?” Draco leaned forward and ran the tip of his nose against Harry’s as, over Harry’s shoulder, he could see the man push on Harry’s back, getting him in a better position to hit his prostate.
Apparently Harry’s theory was right then. He blew past Ron’s not-so-subtle innuendo. “Right, cheers. I think I might hang around for a bit here. Have one more pint.”
“Mmm, yeah,” Harry murmured, shifting against his husband and letting the sensitive head rub against the smooth stretch of Draco’s perineum. Draco pulled away and Harry was about to protest until Draco turned around to face him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and swung them so that Draco was lying atop him, their cocks—Draco’s still not quite recovered—trapped between their bodies. “And it’s ready to go again if you are.”
Lucius took one last fortifying breath of Narcissa and then he reached up and pulled her clenched hands loose from his robes. Bending down, he gave each of her knuckles a soft kiss, ignoring the impatient shuffling of his Auror guards, and then lifted her face up to look at him.
Harry scrambled off the bed and started pulling on his pants when he heard the rushing sound of water. Walking into the bathroom, Harry found his husband standing beside the large walk-in shower, gauging the temperature of the water. “What are you doing? I thought we were going to the hospital.”
“Mmmmmm,” came a moaned response to Harry’s exploratory shifts. “If you think you’re sticking that thing inside me again, you have another thing coming.”
Harry was intentionally vague, waiting for them to take the bait. He didn’t have to wait long. A woman at the other end of the table, who was sitting beside Hermione, leaned forward in her chair, hands clasped together and she leaned on the glass-topped table. “Who were you thinking?”
He raised his head to gaze at his son. The boy—man now, he supposed—was still sitting on the bench, back rigid as he nervously picked at his nails. One of Lucius’ biggest regrets was the effect his terrible decisions have had on his son, but even as he watched his son wilt while the Dark Lord had stalked the halls of their family home, it still always felt like it was impossible to turn off the road he had set them down. He had been wrong of course, and his wife and son had been smart enough to change course. He was glad that their 13th hour redemption had bought them leniency from the Wizengamot and they would only have probation and not spend any imprisonment time.
“Yeah, well how about I do you a favour and stop talking and you can return the favour?” Harry muttered as he pointed his wand under their cauldron and started the fire.
“There’s nothing I would love more than to see you keep your mouth shut,” Draco said. Harry knew that Draco always had to get the last word in, so he just bit his tongue and focused on the potion. It wasn’t until he’d completed the first part of it and was at the stage where they had to let it simmer for an hour that Harry remembered the Reversaroons.
“You did a great job, Harry,” she encouraged as she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. “But maybe try to avoid calling our potential clients fools in the future?”
“Yeah, I know all of that and it’s all fine with me. From what I hear though, this little cockslut hasn’t come yet, and that’s going to end with me.”
“It’s okay. I know you’re going to be a good boy for me, aren’t you?” Harry nodded and bit his lip as the man behind him set up a steady rhythm, sliding all the way out and letting Harry’s well-used hole begin to close again before pushing back in.
“Please...let me say goodbye to my family,” Lucius asked, straining to keep his composure and remain strong for Narcissa and Draco’s sake.
“I promise that the next time I go off on a quest, I’ll have the taxi swing by and pick you up first,” he said as he reached up and knocked on the door using the knocker, which was an elaborate silver piece that was shaped like a snake curled around itself and forming an infinity symbol.
“That answers that mystery,” Harry said, laughing as he pulled out his mobile, which was ringing yet again. “Yeah, hi Hermione. No, everything’s fine. I just ran into an old friend. I’ll tell you all about it later. I might be a little late with your salad though; he’s going to take me out for lunch. Okay, bye.”
“Yes, I understand that, but unfortunately people aren’t always rational about things like this,” Hermione said.
“Yes, Pansy. And when your soon-to-be-husband asks how you know Harry, should we just explain that Harry here saw you in your knickers and used your body as a shot glass?”
“I’d rather be paired with an enraged pixie, Sir,” Malfoy drawled, looking bored. He went back to biting at his cuticle again.
Harry sighed. As much as he always disliked Potions class when Snape was their professor, somehow this year Slughorn’s class was worse. It had started out marvellously, with Harry becoming the dark horse that suddenly raced ahead to become the star pupil thanks to the help of the Half-Blood Prince’s old textbook. But that had quickly backfired on Harry when Slughorn had assigned him to be partnered with Malfoy, whose scholarly descent was in direct contradiction to Harry’s ascent.
“Take care of him, my love,” he instructed and a fresh round of tears started their long trek down Narcissa’s beautiful face.
As Harry bent his head to climb in, Draco said, “It’s my magical skill. I never have trouble hailing a taxi.”
“Yes, I’d pieced that together,” Harry said, trying to be polite, but his eyes shot over to Draco when he snorted at Harry’s remark and the two shared a knowing look before Pansy continued speaking, completely oblivious to them.
Fortunately, it only took them a minute or so to make their way out of the pub and then they were once more in the fresh evening air. “Sorry about that,” Draco said sheepishly. “When she’s been drinking, she becomes a little...uncouth.”
That head turned and the jawline was so sharp that Harry thought it could cut him if he gave in to the temptation to reach out and slide his fingertips along it. His eyes followed a path down Harry’s body, taking him in from head to toe before his lips thinned and he turned away, giving Harry his profile once more. “More than you can afford.”
Harry held his breath as he waited for Snape to say something. The other man just glared at him for long enough that Harry was sure that their chances of keeping this account were dashed, but finally, he spoke, “Are you waiting for an engraved invitation?”
The Healer turned towards Draco and inspected him for a few moments before shaking her head. “I can’t say the same for you.”
“Too many frog toes,” the twins said in unison, sharing a wide grin as Fred waved his hand in the air, dispelling the smoke.
“What?” Fred asked, potion momentarily forgotten. “I know for a FACT that they work. It took three weeks for the hex burn that Angelina gave me when I told her she looked fat to heal.”
Harry startled as a cool, dry voice vocalised the very thought that had just been crossing his mind. He spun around to find a ridiculously fit man standing behind him. His short hair was arranged in a stylish faux-hawk and was so blonde that it almost appeared white, seeming to pick up and reflect the scant lighting in the bar, like a beacon. He was a few inches taller than Harry, which gave Harry the opportunity to appreciate the man’s trim physique and the way his lavender-coloured dress shirt hugged the muscles beneath, the top two buttons open and loose revealing a mouthwatering long neck that made Harry want to lean in and run his tongue up the length and around to whisper in his ear.
The other man groaned before shifting, straightening his legs and shifting his upper body forward a bit. “Use my thighs.” The instruction was groggy yet still managed to be imperious.
“Yeah, says here that Malfoy swiped them when Harry’s back was turned and Malfoy was just as much of an obnoxious git as usual.”
Professor Slughorn’s chest puffed up and Harry interjected before Slughorn could fawn all over him again, “Sir, I think Seamus might need some guidance.”
“Be careful where you point that thing,” Ron smirked at Harry from his spot next to Hermione. “One slip of the wrist and Harry might lose his willy.”
“Thank you, sir,” they said in unison as Kingsley turned and made to leave, but a moment later he turned back around.
“All those men in that club wanted you. I bet I could make a small fortune if I auctioned off this beautiful hole of yours to let someone else come inside you, do you know that?”
“Yes, well, as the man of honour, it’s my obligation to help organise the hen night,” Draco explained.
Harry shook his head. “No, fortunately, the officer had a sense of humour about it. She felt so guilty about it, though, that she sentenced herself to 20 hours of community service to make amends.”
“Is that so? Well, as they say, fools rush in, so we will need some time to consider your proposal.” Harry nodded, giving the intimidating man a terse, close-mouthed smile. “You will hear back from us next Friday.”
Harry crowded into the man’s left side, letting the hard line of his cock, which was tucked into the elastic band of his pants, graze the escort’s arm. Harry could tell that the man’s suit was expensive, made of a high-quality material, and Harry couldn’t wait to strip it off him. “How much for the whole night?”
Hermione sighed and regarded Harry with a stern look. “Harry, this is serious. I really need you to pay attention.”
Harry gave himself one small moment of weakness and pressed against Draco, the kiss just as amazing as he remembered from all those weeks ago, before pulling away and taking a step back. “So you can disappear on me again? Nope, this time we’re going out on a date so that you can get to know me and realise what a catch I am.”
Harry wasn’t sure whether it was the taunting words or his own insistent lust that gave him the strength to do it, but he threw back a large gulp of liquid courage and turned his body to face the other man. “You.”
With a wicked grin that went unseen by his gorgeous companion, Harry reached up and pulled the other man’s cock between his legs so that he could suck teasingly on the head before lavishing the same attention on each of the man’s testicles. When Harry heard the sinfully erotic sounds coming out of the man, he pulled back, returning to play with the sparkly toy.
Lucius kept his chin high, more out of habit than pride, as his two Aurors took hold of his arms and began to lead him from the courtroom. Narcissa, her lips trembling as two tear streaks ran down her cheeks, stood up from the bench they were sitting on and rushed towards him before one of the Aurors stepped in front of him, blocking her way.
“Alright, but come find me later, ‘kay?” Pansy pulled Draco’s head down once more, placing another bright kiss on his cheek, the other one this time. “You can buy us another round of shots!” Turning to Harry, she said, “Draco will buy you a shot too!” Then she waved and spun around, staggering towards the patio door and back into the pub.
Hermione turned her head to smirk at him. “I would imagine you would be flailing around trying to optimize the SEO results.”
All the air seemed to be sucked out of the room as every head but one turned towards the far end of the table. Harry tried as hard as he could to maintain his confident facade as Severus Snape stared down his hook-nose at him. The silence stretched for what felt like an interminable amount of time, but Harry refused to back down from the man’s icy glare.
“You’re so beautiful, baby,” Draco whispered. “Just this one more cock and then we can go home and you can come.”
That sexy smirk that Harry remembered as if it was just yesterday that they’d met graced Draco’s face. “I must have drunk more than I thought that night; I don’t remember you being this daft.”
Harry grinned at his best friend as he leaned back and looked up at the building. It was a white brick, three-storey building. The unit that Harry was interested in was midway down the street, sandwiched between two others. Across the street was a private, gated park which was a sure sign that the price tag for this particular piece of real estate was far beyond Harry’s salary. The door for number 5 was painted a deep pine green colour and above it was an elaborate array of windows which resembled a spread-out peacock’s tail.
“Yes, Master Malfoy, sir. Tweaky will wash these and attach them to the wall right away, sir!” The small elf scurried over and took hold of the bowl and held it against his body with one hand so he could snap his fingers with the other hand and disappear with another pop.
Draco dropped his head and groaned, the sound muted by the soft fur and the padding filling the giant teddy bear. When Harry had insisted on winning the over over-sized prize at the Muggle carnival they’d gone to tonight, Draco had stood impatiently, arms crossed in front of his chest and toe tapping as his boyfriend had dropped what must have been half his Gringotts vault on the silly ring toss game. Draco had needled him for his ridiculousness the entire way home, but it wasn’t until the door had closed behind them and a familiar twinkle had shone out of Harry’s eyes that Draco had suspected there was more to Harry’s attachment to the bear than he’d first thought. Clothes had been banished with a hastily cast spell and Draco had soon lost track of how long they’d been here, his body stretched between the soft pillow of the bear and the hard pounding body behind him.
“But father,” Draco said, but Lucius didn’t seem to notice his son’s interruption as he simply continued to speak in his new, odd voice.
Perhaps it’s good that they aren’t apart very much anymore, because if Draco and I are together on our own more than we are now, I would most certainly go completely bonkers. Every other sentence he utters is about what Potter said earlier or whatever kind of secret date they are going on in the upcoming weekend. Strangely enough though, I’ve found that I very often start to smile to myself whenever Draco gets on with one of his rants. I don’t have to listen to every word, because the liveliness in his voice is enough on it’s own to bring me joy. And it gives me time to think about other stuff.
“Draco, wait–” I start, but my friend is already at the door across the room and he leaves without looking back once.
“What do you think you’re doing, street rat?” the guard in question spat. “Isn’t stealing enough of an offence for you? You have to go and assault a guard as well? Just wait ‘til we get ya!”
Draco stormed through the palace doors, loudly demanding to see his father. When the tall man strode into the hallway, Draco immediately started to rant about what had happened. He told his father about the amazing day he had spent in the city streets, how good it had been until he had been snatched by that awful man. Then he told him about the brave man named Harry who had saved him, going out of his way to get Draco out of the man’s grasp. And he told his father about the residence Harry lived in and the cute — but fierce — monkey who was his best friend. Lastly, Draco told him about how the guards had just barged in and demanded his arrest, ignoring the fact that at that moment Harry had still been the hero of the day.
— the guard to get them out of there. Dear Allah, did he wish that no one would bring this up in the future. So embarrassing!
He didn’t need to say anything else. Though his eyes showed he was as angry as Draco, they also showed something Draco’s did not: expedience. Draco’s anger had been mixed with futility.
On the second anniversary of that first night, Draco knelt down in front of Harry and asked him to share his last name. Harry didn’t get to answer, because all the kids in the house; James, Lily, Scorpius and Albus shouted it out for him:
Everything was deadly quiet. No one made a sound. Like the calm before the storm. Like the silence before a child starts to scream after stubbing their toe. Harry knew that things were about to get a lot worse if he were to stay, so that was something he didn’t plan on doing. But first, he’d need to help the hooded stranger out of there. Quickly, he shot forwards to help him stand up.
I know she hasn’t given up on him, she has just never been very strong when it comes to emotions. Her forte isn’t feelings, because they can’t be tamed by logic, by the mind.
There is still a long time until he’s fine, until he’s healed. But at least I’m not on my own anymore. And I don’t spare another moment before I ask him to marry me.
?” he asked. “And I’m sorry too. I know what you heard and it was wrong of me to say that. But… I thought that was how royalty spoke…”
“What? What were you talking about?” Ron asks, already having forgotten about his dramatic problems with Seamus and Dean’s love life.
get used to hearing Malfoy say Harry instead of Potter, but it’s been going on for weeks, so I’ll just have to get used to it, I suppose. And it’s not really that bad to hear him use the name. He always says it very softly. As if it’s a delicate word that he cherishes more than anything. It’s weird. But he’s Malfoy, he’s always weird, just like every other Slytherin I know. They’re weird, but not
This certainly wasn’t the place or time to have a breakdown, he knew that, but... it wasn’t as if he could actually plan when his world was going to fall apart. It wasn’t as if he had known when he woke up this morning, or that he’d decided “ah, today is the day I will lose my sanity in the middle of a battlefield of spiders”.
The sky was a dull blue, dimmed by the high heat that was the result of the sun shining brightly on the sandy ground. Any wise man would make sure to keep still for the time being, spare the energy for later activities and draw back to the shade and stay at ease. And most people did so. Imagine the surprise these people felt when a young boy clad in ragged clothing suddenly burst through the street, followed by angry shouts of ‘Stop him!’, ‘Thief!’ and ‘Riff Raff!’ coming from a swarm of palace guards. Though this did make a lot of villagers peek out of their homes, it didn’t help the guards to catch the boy — he was out of reach before anyone had realised what was going on.
I’m still not sure if I want to join them, because… the pain, but then Blaise Zabini comes up to me. He pats me on my left shoulder and asks me what else I’m planning to do today if I don’t come. He has a point. Since there wasn’t enough time or staff to schedule all Eighth Year students to study all their necessary classes, it has been decided that our year would be extended to a two year long education, but with only half the classes each year. This, naturally, left us with a lot of extra time to kill. I don’t mind that any more than I mind the snow. It feels safe to be here so it’s good to know I’ll stay for about another eighteen years.
While Harry had spoken, the two wristbands that showed Jafar’s boundary had appeared and at the very moment Harry finished his speech, Jafar’s new residence fell out of thin air and onto the floor: a black oil lamp. As it came to a still on the floor, Jafar was instantly pulled into it. His protesting screams filled the room, but no one came to his aid. Instead they all watched as he became smaller and smaller and then disappeared within the lamp.
Back to Blaise. And Draco/Harry shenanigans. And an impromptu confession - which leads to... early Christmas?
“Well, this is kind of stupid, don’t you think? We survived, but we’re still gonna die because we can’t get out of here. And for what? For a favour for some old man? He got what he wanted, we get to die and we don’t even know what that dumb lamp was for anyway. He got everything and we got nothing.”
“Of course, my lord, but this man is a criminal, and he is merely about to be punished for his crimes.”
While walking back to Agrabah, Harry continued to communicate with Genie, getting to know him a bit better as well as trying to get some help with figuring out what two wishes would suit him the best. However, it wasn’t long until Harry lost track of the subject and he was talking about the prince. He had already told Genie about how he had ended up in the cave, and he had told him about the incredible encounter he had had with Draco.
He reaches over his right hand and lets it follow the shape of my face. His touch isn’t as light as Potter’s on Draco’s skin, but firm and grounding. Evident, certain to be there. I sigh and lean towards him. With unsurprising strength, he suddenly hauls me to my feet. Intent eyes scour my face, a hand slides through my hair, pushing my head backwards so that it’s tilted to make me able to see him.
“Don’t say that! You might accidentally use up your last wish! And you promised you would use it to set Genie free.”
At first, Harry looked confused, but then he seemed to understand and he nodded. Draco instantly moved to make enough space on the bed for Harry to get in.
“Oh yeah?” I let a smile play on my lips. Malfoy sure is an irritable pointy git, who more often than not, doesn’t think about what he says. But he
“Then I shall go and tell that to my father. I will also tell him that you will be joining us for dinner this evening.”
With each word I come closer and closer to him. I grip my wand tighter, clench my jaw only to force it to relax so I can keep talking.
The man’s reply clearly provoked the guard a lot, for he visibly clenched his jaw and raised his hand. Harry quickly understood what was going to happen, and before knowing it, he had once again grabbed the other man’s hand and dragged him away. They ran through alleys and back streets. Harry navigated them around corners and along house walls, up over roofs and under gates, until finally they halted outside a makeshift door made of a simple cloth hanging in front of an opening.
As Harry had ran to follow Draco, he stumbled into a man. A man which he recognised immediately. It was the man who had brought him to the Cave of Wonders and then thrown him to his death!
? My dad always does that when… when I’ve had a nightmare. He says it’s because that’s what he would’ve wanted someone to do to him whenever he had one of his. And it helps. Sorry, I’m rambling…”
While rapidly ranting out the last part, seemingly out of nowhere he manages to produce a small stand with loads of trinkets that he’s obviously trying to sell. Your interest in the man immediately starts to dissipate — he’s not nearly as curious as he first seemed to be if he’s only a salesman — when he continues:
In one of the corners of the room, a stool was placed. Right now, that chair was occupied by one wary-looking monkey.
A tear falls down my cheek, but I don’t bother removing it. Why should I? Why wouldn’t I be allowed to cry? Why shouldn’t I be able to cry over this pain? No, I am allowed to. Anyone who says otherwise will be on the receiving end of a rather painful hex.
Those green eyes shine with happiness and life, and he whispers yes. Ron arrives a few minutes later, and I ask him for the rings I know he got me after the first week I spent at the hospital. His grin grows impossibly wider as he brings them out of his pockets.
“Don’t do that!” This time, the chastisement came from across the table, where Hermione was sitting. She had set her Daily Prophet aside and was giving Harry a disappointed look. “Don’t make the House Elves clean up after your mess.”
Hermione rolled her eyes as she unplugged her computer from the projector. “You know I’m not foolish enough to ask you to.” She leaned down, pulling up her email and scanning the list in her inbox, quickly and efficiently filing them away in the variety of nested folders she had set up. “If only there was some way to extract a binding promise from someone,” she mused. “Some sort of...unbreakable vow.”
His third had been quick, trickling down the curved skin of the other man’s arse and pooling in the Dimples of Venus in his lower back as Harry squeezed those soft cheeks together and fucked his cock between them.
Draco was relieved to see that Tweaky had already completed his assigned task and the twelve new additions were affixed in place. Not wasting any more time as his arousal, which had been steadily building and clawing at him for the last few hours, surged again at the sight, Draco pulled out his wand and vanished both of their clothes before crowding Harry up against the soft cushion of the wall.
“I’m getting married!” This proclamation was met with a round of cheers from the rest of her party that made Harry want to cringe and cover his ears to protect them. “Wanna do a shot with me?”
Draco’s top leg slipped forward and Harry followed him, wrapping his arm around the man that he’d been in love with for over twenty years and holding him close.
that it would work. He tipped his chin up, marshalling up the stray strands of confidence that had begun to leech away. “This campaign will make kale just as vital as lettuce. You’d be a fool not to sign on with Media Magic.”
Harry laughed. “Hermione, this isn’t some movie. They’re in advertising, they’re not secret agents. Unless you’re suggesting that MI5 is behind this somehow?”
“Ugh. That kale monstrosity?” Harry asked. “You know, just because we’re trying to hawk the stuff doesn’t mean you have to buy into the hype.”
“Yeah. Maybe you’ve seen the advertisements around? We’re doing a big tie-in with an upcoming cooking show.” Harry watched as understanding dawned on Draco and he regarded Harry with amusement.
“Damn, I really thought I had him there,” the stranger chuckled as he pulled his softening dick out of Harry’s arse, holding the condom in place. He tied off the condom before holding it up for Draco to see. “Shit, that was a huge load. Thanks for the ride.” He gave Harry a slap on one arse cheek and winked at Draco before climbing off the bed and dropping the used condom in the porcelain bowl. “I sure hope I see you guys around again. I’d love another go at him sometime.”
Draco reached down and encircled Harry’s wrist with his long fingers. His hands were cool, sending a chill up Harry’s arm as Draco began steering him towards the door into the pub.
Harry was about to turn back around, embarrassed at being caught out, but then a burst of bravery came over him and he took a step closer, their chests almost touching. “And if I do?”
Harry shivered. “Nee—,” he began, the words barely a whisper. Clearing his throat, Harry tried again, “Need his cock. Need to be filled.”
Harry let out a low groan and then crashed his lips down on Draco’s, his hot tongue sweeping in to stroke against Draco’s. It took all of Draco’s concentration to focus on directing the snowball to slip unseen beneath the cloak.
Draco slipped his hand over Harry’s cheek and turned his face upwards. “What do you need, my sweet?” Draco asked in a sultry tone.
“So that’s ‘Pans’?” Harry asked, still trying to wrap his head around the confusing encounter. Draco snorted as he began wiping away the lipstick marks on his cheeks.
“Draco, darling! There you are! I thought you’d snuck off and gone home.” Harry spun around to see the bride from earlier step up and throw her hand around the man’s—Draco’s—neck and pull his head down to place a kiss on his cheek. When she released him, a fire engine red stamp of her lips stood out against his pale skin.
The too-long taxi ride was followed by questing tongues, fumbling hands, hastily shed clothing, and sweat-slicked bodies. Once they were finished, Harry collapsed down onto the bed and sleep quickly overtook him.
But his favourite design project was still in progress. Here, in the playroom that was hidden in the back of one of their closets thanks to an Undetectable Extension Spell that Granger had helped him master, was Draco and Harry’s naughty DIY project. Lining about one-third of the wall was a textured installation: hundreds of squishy condoms in a variety of colours, all filled with come. Washed clean and then fortified with a spell of Draco’s own devising, each condom was attached individually to the wall. This was their trophy wall—their ‘Cock-cent Wall’, as Harry liked to call it.
“Well, we don’t actually know that yet, but our IT department is working on that,” Hermione said, her shoulders shrinking into herself when Snape let out a very loud and prolonged breath through his nose, his displeasure obvious.
“Yes, sales are still growing, but the rate of growth is dropping. See?” Hermione pressed a few buttons on her keyboard and the monitor switched over to an Excel window where a line chart showed the upward curve of sales. “The sales are still going up, but if I look at rate of growth, “ she scrolled down to show a new line chart, this one with ending with a small downward curve, “it’s started to decline.”
“Too bad it wasn’t a stag do instead, huh?” Ron said, winking and nudging Harry with his elbow again.
As usual, Hermione’s data analysis had been spot-on and the drop in numbers had not been a blip like Harry had hoped. For the last few weeks, they had been scrambling to figure out why their campaign was falling to pieces and trying to figure out how they could stop the bleeding and resuscitate it.
“Oh, ummm…” Harry trailed off as he swallowed, then raised his hand still holding the napkin and used it to wipe away the streak of red on Draco’s cheek. The moment lingered, Harry reluctant to break the contact as his hand slowly dropped away and Draco leaned back.
Hermione looked like she was about to say something, but then her eyes darted to the right and she stood up straighter, smoothing down her skirt. Harry turned just in time to see Kingsley finish his walk past the wall of windows lining the conference room and round the doorframe. “Nothing’s official yet, but I think you two are going to be busy making sure every kitchen has a bunch of kale in their crisper next year.”
“Once this campaign is complete, kale will be the talk of the town and chefs of every level will be scrambling to shake things up in their kitchens,” Harry finished as he clicked through to the end of the presentation he’d prepared. He looked around the room and studied the faces seated up and down both sides of the long conference table. There were a few smiling nods being exchanged amongst the junior members of the Kale Growers of Britain—it was made very apparent during the first meeting between Kale Growers of Britain and his employer, Media Magic, that they did not appreciate anyone using their rather unfortunate acronym—but the bolus of nerves sitting heavily in his stomach was refusing to go anywhere since the look on Mr Snape’s face, the head of the Growers association, was less than reassuring.
Harry slid his underpants back off and stepped into the shower. When Draco gave him a confused look, Harry shrugged and grinned. “May as well take advantage of it while we can.”
Draco slid his non-wand hand beneath the cloak and shook off Harry’s grasp, bringing it up around to Harry’s back and lifting his shirt. Harry let out a hiss between his teeth as Draco’s snow-chilled fingers rubbed against the bare skin of his lower back, but he didn’t stop Draco’s questing hand. Draco felt the cold snowball bump against the back of his hand and he withdrew his hand from Harry’s warm flesh and grabbed the ball. He ended their kiss and gave Harry a brief, wicked smirk but before Harry could react he smashed the snowball against Harry’s lower back and pushed as much as he could down the back of Harry’s pants.
“It did,” Draco confirmed, nodding. “The Lettuce Grower’s League were quite concerned by their recent drop in sales.”
Pansy’s face sort of melted and went all wobbly and she looked like she was going to cry. “You won’t tell Neville, will you, Drakey-poo?”
“Oh, um...Harry. I’m Harry.” Harry held out his hand to the raven-haired bride, but to his surprise, she crossed over to him and greeted him in the same way she had Draco.
Narcissa stepped forward carefully, not wanting to make any rapid movements in front of the tense Aurors, until she was so close that the brought her hands up and fisted them in the robes at his chest, burying her face in his chest as a sob shook her torso. Lucius slowly brought his arms up and rubbed her back soothingly, making sure to keep his hands visible to the Aurors and not giving them any excuse to make this any worse for his family.
“If people actually took the time to read the full article, most would probably come to those same conclusions since all of those points that you mentioned are in them,” Harry said, casting Hermione a quick apologetic look before returning his attention back to the intimidating man sitting across from them. “Unfortunately, a surprisingly large percentage of people will either just skim the article, will only read the first few paragraphs, or will even just read the title of the article and not even bother to read the rest of it.”
Draco grinned at hearing exactly what he had expected Harry to say come out of his mouth. “That’s what I hoped you would say. Tweaky?”
Draco sat back in the chair he was seated in with a furrowed brow as he tried to place the woman, who turned back to Harry and gave him an expectant look.
Malfoy shrugged and continued chewing the last Reversaroon. Harry contemplated warning Malfoy about what had happened, but he was worried that people would think he’d done it on purpose. After all, it was widely known that he and Malfoy didn’t exactly get along. He was sure that more than one person in this school would happily lay down bets that Harry had done it on purpose just to get a break from Malfoy’s sharp tongue.
“Potter,” Harry spit out without thought. At Draco’s confused look, he explained, “My last name. It’s Potter. I realised after last time that I didn’t even learn your last name.”
Draco smirked at the man. “Too bad for them, but lucky for you.” He began to give the man the spiel that he’d already delivered eleven times now, but the man interrupted him.
“Harry, you can’t be serious?” Hermione’s voice pitched up as she chastised him. Harry switched the mobile to his other ear as the taxi came to a stop in front of the address that Harry had supplied. Leaning to the side, he pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and began pulling out the fare as he held the phone to his ear using his shoulder.
Draco rolled his eyes, but a small smile tugged at his lips. “Yes, I love you. Now I think you should get back to your hen party and let Harry and I get to know one another a little better.”
I did as she said. I lived. I did whatever I could to honor the memory of my hero. But it wasn’t glorious. For years, I helped with anything I could, I gave what good I could to the world. But it wasn’t enough. I know that if what Granger said was true, then Harry would’ve wanted me to be happy. And I could never be that without him here. I had to be with him. So I was going to be.
Harry held on to Abu as tightly as he held onto the carpet, and felt the headwind grow stronger as they sped up. Up ahead, he could see that the Tiger’s mouth was about to close, and he leaned forwards in an attempt to help the magic carpet fly faster. There was only a few dozen metres left. They could do it!
He hated himself. No matter how much good he did, how many crimes he stopped, how many criminals he put away, it was never enough. He was never enough. He hadn’t saved them. He failed.
“First one to get out gets to decide which color the fairy lights inside should be!” I shout as I sprint out, not wanting to ponder anymore – not about the pain or about what Blaise’s expression could mean. I’m ready to build with snow!
“What would that be?” he asked, a tinge too naive and oblivious to understand. The larger man laughed a sickening laugh and took a step closer, sneaking a hand onto the smaller man’s hip, only to snatch him towards his large body.
“Now, if you will not be of any help, I will have to go.” Harry said hurriedly, then rushed off to where he thought Draco had disappeared to, not daring to look back at the man.
’ the old man had said. Harry had always had that line in the back of his mind. It kept him alive on the days that were a bit worse than others, the days that were filled with more hunger than most. He had always held on to his dreams and hope. But none of those days had been as bad as today. Because Abu was gone. None of Harry’s previous experiences with pain had prepared him for this. For the first time, Harry was ready to give up on his dream. It was obviously not meant to be anyways.
Harry shook the memory out of his head and focused on the young brother and sister that were still watching his bread hungrily. He didn’t need any more pondering. He cooed gently to the two children, reassuring them that he would do them no harm, and he offered his piece of bread to them. Next to him, he could hear Abu chatter disapprovingly, just like he had always done whenever he saw Harry giving away his food. Harry ignored him, and firmly gave it away before walking out of the alley.
He was back. Back where it all started. Or where it ended. The dark forest towered around him, casting frightening shadows upon the way he was walking. Back where the green curse hit him, the pain that followed, the death that wasn’t enough to save everyone. Back where he sacrificed himself but didn’t save
There is a collective gasp coming from the table, but I don’t care. I barely even hear it. All I care about was the snakelike man who I have glued my glare onto. I walk slowly towards him.
Before the man could react, Harry danced around him, slashing with the sword back and forth, up and down, here and there before taking a few steps back. He’d gotten some nice cuts in the man’s rich but dirty clothing, yet not harmed him in any way. Except for one thing. His hand. The hand which had previously been holding onto the smaller man was now laying on the ground.
He was back. Back where it all started. Back where he tried to leave everyone behind and go end everything on his own. He didn’t want to, but he had to, because everyone that stayed around him ended up dead. Or hurt. Back when he realised everything was his fault, because he hadn’t actually stopped the Dark Lord when he was a baby.
Jafar. Draco saw him now, standing lurking behind an olive tree. Draco had never liked the advisor, had always thought him too mysterious and dark. It wouldn’t surprise him if Jafar turned out to be even more evil than Draco had imagined and that all this was his scheming. And that meant that Harry needed his help.
There was no use in arguing, because if they did, Ron would convince him he was wrong, and he couldn’t let that happen. Because he didn’t
It was a dumb question, really, for Harry could see the fruits laying on the table below the windowsill, but he still asked in an attempt to soften Abu’s mood. The monkey just huffed annoyingly and snatched an orange which he began to peel, ignoring Harry’s sorrowful looks. Harry hated to upset his best friend. But for now, there really wasn’t much he could do. So he turned back to their new guest.
The horse stopped, and the coachman jumped onto the ground. Together with another man, he unstrapped the cage from the wagon and they carried it down on the ground. Then they jumped onto the carriage again and went off, leaving Harry in the cage.
He takes out a rather dusty, old oil lamp and though something about it sparks your interest to flower again, you do not let it show.
I cast an eye over the crowd still in the room. They are all still laughing and playing around as if nothing has happened. Except for Potter. Potter is standing still, as if struck by lightning, exactly in the same spot he was before. He hasn’t moved at all and he is visibly very confused by what just happened. I sigh and rise from the chair.
