“Yes.”

“Sure, buddy! Where do you want it?”
“No thanks to you.”
“He’s not
“Tough luck,” Draco said shortly. “But if you keep me any longer, it will be too late for my patient.” He wheeled the cart into the treatment room and closed the door in Greyson’s face.
“Like what?”

ago. That we would somehow manage to get me to play.”
“Fine, then I’m taking it back now,” Draco said and before Harry could react, he had opened the drawer again and taken the wand out. “How do you like that, hm?”
He clapped Harry on the shoulder that wasn’t in a sling, even though he knew it was just part of his disguise and both of them didn’t really hurt.
Harry didn’t seem convinced, but he did swing his legs up onto the bed, which indicated that he was going to stay and listen.
, this was
would they do that?”
Pig was the only owl that could enter the house now. Everything else was redirected to Samantha, who personally delivered their post once a day.
Also, it was almost Christmas. Draco couldn’t say that he would be sad to hear that Blaise and Potter hadn’t seen each other all that much lately.
“Merlin’s fucking–!”
“Come on, this house is derelict. It won’t improve on its own, it’s only getting worse.”
” Harry’s voice went unnaturally high at the end, and his eyes were huge when they found Draco’s.
Draco massaged his chest lightly. “I’m about to do something nice for all of you, so I’d appreciate it if you’d apologise for assaulting me.”
“Yeah, right,” said Candace pointedly. “Is that your way of distracting from yourself?”
And for once in his life, Potter didn't talk back at him.
“That one looks alright,” he said pointing at it.
“Hermione had her baby this morning,” Harry said carefully. Maybe he thought that would cheer him up. “It’s a girl ... they named her Rose.”
“Alright, what’s wrong with my pants?”
“Maybe they think it could be traced back to them? If we knew when this was taken, we could try to find out who had access to the changing rooms at the time.”
. Draco had seen it before, when he had made Potter strip in his kitchen, and then when Potter had stripped in his bedroom, completely of his own accord. But he suddenly remembered something else – another instance when almost the exact same thing had happened.
Draco just picked a direction and walked.
“Yes.” He smiled – a real, genuine smile – and picked up his book again.
“I’m guessing you’re
Tabitha shrugged. “Doesn’t mean anything. Didn’t he hate
“That’s me!” Never had Harry seemed so excited to be recognised.
Casually, Draco pulled the left sleeve of his pyjama top down to make sure his scar was covered properly. “Definitely not.”
“At least that explains why Matt’s been so different lately.”
you’re telling me our Healer has been biased for over a year?”
“And if somebody else enters, you sense that as well.” It wasn’t a question. The house-elves had
Draco held Harry in place with a hand on his shoulder before he could fall flat on his face from the impact. He gave Greyson a very pointed look. “I
Draco nudged Harry’s naked chest with his chin. “I thought you took a shower before coming here?”
Robinson used the distraction to throw the second glove at Harry’s head. He caught that one too, without even looking, and then simply kept it so that she would have to come over to retrieve it, which was definitely more of a power move than chucking it at completely uninvolved bystanders.
“Too bad we don’t know the code to unlock it,” Harry said pointedly while Draco fixed Cuffe’s eyes again.
give interviews?” Somehow Draco found that very hard to believe, given Potter’s less than ideal history with reporters.
,” Draco objected. “I’ve got a dog.”
Draco leaned back against the wall and worked on catching his breath. He really needed to do more exercise. And maybe find a man who wasn’t in constant peril of getting injured.
Draco shrugged. “That wand was the Dark Lord’s downfall.”
Draco had never thought that Angelina Johnson would be someone he ever saw again after Hogwarts. He hadn’t even really seen her
“I thought you wanted to get done with this as fast as possible?”
Draco went over to the table to see what the fuss was. There was a cutting board on the table, on which Olivia had placed, rather neatly, five strings of spaghetti, which she had braided for about half their length. There was about half a pot of spaghetti still standing next to it.
at him unexpectedly. He climbed over the back of the sofa and sat down beside Draco, draping one arm around his shoulders and kissing his cheek.
“Oh shit,” they whispered in unison. And then they were running.
. Harry was right – compared to what they’d gone through in the last months, this really wasn’t too bad.
Blaise gave him a tired smile. “Well, she was furious about your intervention. And apparently

“You reek.”

Every fibre of his body wanted him to keep a calm, controlled face. For the first time in his life, Draco ignored the urge to seem aloof and let his face do what it really wanted to do – show the panic he was feeling inside.
Draco nodded along, even though his suspicion was growing deeper by the second.
“If you’re messing with Harry –,” she said, trying for a threatening tone and failing.
“I’ll heal it.” Ginny’s wand was out in a heartbeat. “What’s the spell?”

had refused to leave Draco’s side, and the
Harry ignored him. He turned around, seized his bag and grabbed Draco’s upper arm. “You’re taking me to see her, right?”
Encouraged by the fact that Potter hadn’t pushed him off yet, Draco made use of his now-free hands by grabbing Potter’s neck with one of them and squeezing the other arm into the hollow between his back and the wall so he could pull him even closer.
Who? Draco? But who
He wished
Draco didn’t even want to think about all the other horrible factors that played into his despair, but his mind started to point them out anyway. Male, in his twenties, Gryffindor, curse scar, Quidditch, impaling accident involving a footrest, reckless behaviour, ignoring his Healer’s advice ...
Draco was more hesitant. The last party he had attended hadn't ended all that pleasantly and he wasn't too keen on witnessing any more of the love triangle between Potter, Blaise and Ginny.
“My mistake,” Harry grumbled. “I thought that hat was a Wheezes knockoff, not the real deal. Must be a new design.
tried during Draco’s home assignment after the New Year’s Eve poisoning! But none of them would just throw him under the bus like that.
Draco had projected all his frustration and desperation and fear onto him. If Harry hadn’t survived as a baby, then the war would already have been decided a decade and a half earlier and Draco wouldn’t have gotten into that whole mess. If Harry had finished the Dark Lord off for good, everything would’ve been fine. If Harry had been dead, maybe the Dark Lord wouldn’t have been as hell-bent on disposing of the one man who had been keeping him safe.
Draco was a bit nervous about that.

Draco and Harry looked at each other, a kind of understanding passing between them.
“I liked you better with my tongue down your throat,” Harry complained with a full mouth.

“That’s wild,” said Draco, completely floored.
“Nah, I wouldn’t go that far.” Harry slung an arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him so that they were both squeezed together in the armchair. Then he pressed a kiss on his cheek. “I’ll just have to keep you down to earth some other way.”
“Sorry, Oliver,” said Harry absentmindedly. “I’ve already got plans. Another time?”
write that down!”
want to be forgettable, you could always give your position to McCarthy, right?”
It only took Draco a minute to splash some water at his face, arrange his hair a little more neatly and put on his dressing gown.
Something inside Draco was starting to crack, but he still returned the gesture and said, as pleasantly as he could be, “Mother, why are you here?”
Draco was on his way to the library when somebody grabbed his arm and dragged him into an empty class room.
“I don’t even know who ‘

Also, time was running out. Draco had left Harry five minutes ago and he wanted to be there when he woke up.
? I don’t think so.”
No sense in trying to get out the full sentence in one go. Draco felt like he would never be able to stop laughing. Maybe it was a side-effect of Potter’s Walkman; that would be just like him, to not tell him about the dangers.
If Granger hadn’t even
There was silence for a while. Then Harry shook his head.
Draco crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow to show that he was listening and couldn’t wait to hear the garbage Potter was about to spout.
“It was a spontaneous thing. It’s not like I carry stealth wear with me at all times.” Potter glared at him, as Abby eyed his hoody like she was seeing it for the first time.
Merlin, merely thinking about them made his stomach turn. Draco pushed the tin of sweets as far away as he could reach and groaned.
Harry grimaced and pushed his plate away. “Alright, new idea: You could write me a sick note, right?”
Draco
In a haphazard move, Harry pushed one of the mugs over onto Draco’s half of the table. The liquid sloshed menacingly. “Please. Everybody knows I can’t die.”
Harry just grumbled, but then he seemed to notice the owl now perched on Draco’s shoulder and the unhappy look on his face turned into confusion.
“We will be hearing arguments for both sides and cast our votes afterwards. If you feel you have something to contribute, please raise your paddle – blue side for pro and bronze for con – and you will be added to the list. Are there any questions about the proceedings?”
“It’s in the living room. On the coffee table. Is somebody hurt?”
“Let’s go,” Marc muttered in Tessa’s direction.
“Mhhm …,” made Potter and then his eyes closed completely and he was silent.
“I don’t know,” Harry said distractedly, “Magpies?”
“Your boyfriend’s name is
“Fine,” Greyson ground out, fists clenched at his side. “The rest of you, back in the air. Now.”
And what did he mean
Blaise, on the other hand, had seen Potter several times and for hours on end. They were still working on the Lightning Blast together and Blaise had been waxing lyrically about their progress over Wednesday Dinner, which had taken place at Draco’s again. Blaise had been almost forty minutes late. Draco didn’t want to know what had made him forget the time.
look out for you, doesn’t she?” Draco said ostentatiously.
Pembroke let go of his hand as if he suddenly realised he was still holding it and sat down. He seemed a little lost for words, and his eyes kept darting back to Harry, like he didn’t want to stare but couldn’t help himself.
sort? Overprotective. Let me see that.”
“Yes, I think we get it,” Potter said while his two best friends tried to contain their giggling. “Let’s eat this lasagna and then all of you can start congratulating me on my mad teaching skills.”
He put away his quill and went out into the hallway, where he came face to face with –

“Potter, I fucking swear, if I have to take another single drop of Skele-Gro because of your bag crammed full of nothing but twenty pounds of Chocolate Frogs, I’ll show you where you can shove them.”
There were footsteps and then light from the hallway spilled into the room as Abby opened the door, illuminating Harry like a spotlight.
“Alright,” Potter said, putting the empty map down on the coffee table. “I need a quill. Did you bring one?”
Draco shook his head to clear it of stray thoughts. “Who,
After another minute or so, Harry turned around abruptly and strode over to him, a blazing look in his eyes.
Pansy paused and looked at him expectantly. Draco merely sipped his whisky and held her eyes. She finally leaned back in her chair and tapped her fingernails against the armrest.
Adonis was evidently not in the library on Wednesday night, but Draco still did a double take when he swept the study space with his eyes. Because Potter was there. What was more: he was alone at a table meant for six. Draco didn’t know how he had managed it, because all the other seats were taken.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I don't fancy staring at your face all evening,
“How does that work during Quidditch?” Draco asked thoughtfully. “I’ve never seen you pulverise a Bludger.”
“No, you don’t,” he said, aiming his wand at Potter's ribs. “
Harry glanced over his shoulder and winced. Draco didn’t comment on the increase of speed, even though they were bordering on jogging up the slope now.
Both Ginny and Draco glanced at Harry, who simply shrugged as if to say

was that the potion again? Draco should have petrified him as soon as he took off the Cloak.
“Why?” Harry turned to look at him instead of the tapestry. “You’re the one who’s been glaring at that bloody thing for the last four years.”
Harry had nodded, brushed a hand through his hair. Draco had waited for him to say what he was working up to.
“Or we’ll help you find a
He soundproofed the sitting room, sat down on the couch in front of the fire place (which was burning like always) and concentrated. What was his happiest memory? He considered the moment he had realised that the Dark Lord was dead, but that was too closely related to his worst memories. Better play it safe.
In the end, Draco realised he was a wizard and somehow found enough courage to shake his wand from his sleeve.
Harry sighed softly. “Alright, then imagine if

Potter kicked him under the table, hard. His legs were definitely back at full strength. Draco kept a straight face. Barely. His shin was throbbing quite a bit.

This didn’t seem to pose a problem for Harry, as both his arms were pinned against his body and he was barely conscious. Maybe because one of his ribs was broken.
“That reminds me!” Ginny rummaged in the pockets of her jacket and produced a total of

? Picking this appearance had definitely not been a coincidence. Harry never reused his disguises – usually.
Jenkins frowned, stared at them for another ten seconds and, when neither of them elaborated, cast Priori Incantatem at Harry’s wand, which revealed the Incendio he had cast last.
Draco was left to speculate what had happened next – Harry must have regained consciousness sometime after the crash, enough to send his Patronus and call for Olivia. And then the Muggles had taken him away.

Potter took a very deep breath and then got back to his feet. “Come on, I’ll give you something dry to wear and then we’ll have tea.”
Draco started with the one he was still holding and unwrapped a black apron with a white cartoon pirate on the front and the words
Draco sighed theatrically. “Just tell us the name so Harry won’t have to hex you.”
“No! And if you must know, nobody even saw them. I was wearing a t-shirt long enough to cover my knees.”
This set Potter off again. Of course. “Why? Because I’m not jumping at the chance to
a secret?”
When Draco opened the door, Potter had just lifted a second glass, ready to throw it. The first lay shattered on the floor next to the young therapeutic Healer, who was on the verge of tears.
“Harry came in last weekend,” she said suddenly, though she didn’t look up from her note pad. Maybe she wasn’t unhappy about McAllister’s

“What can I do?” he asked because he couldn’t take the silence any longer.

That one curly lock of hair that usually guarded his forehead had decided to obey gravity after all and Draco was awarded – no, assaulted – by the sight of that wretched scar, several shades lighter than his tan skin.
Draco narrowed his eyes as Harry messed up his hair quite thoroughly. “So what? Want to have it back right now?”
Narcissa was looking around too, a look of distaste on her face that only deepened when she caught sight of his fridge. Draco used the distraction to sort out his hair, which wasn’t that easy if you didn’t have a mirror at hand.
Harry’s answer came almost instantly.
“What’s wrong
Draco cleared his throat anxiously. “Accidentally.”
“We get along,” Draco allowed. “Doesn’t mean he’d
He was on one knee beside Draco immediately, pressing the hot tip of his wand against Draco’s chest.
Draco couldn’t help but scoff. As if Harry ever would have let a stranger into his home. Less alone Dayal. “Fat chance.”
“No? What do you mean,
?” he demanded roughly, a wild look on his face.
at us, living and breathing – the whole shebang,” and Harry nearly tripped in his hurry to reach him.
“No sign of the Snitch yet?”
“Merlin help me, Potter, would you please, for
And then, there was the Snitch. Potter had seen it too – he was speeding up rapidly, shooting past McCarthy, who was caught completely by surprise. There was just no way he could catch up to Potter in time. But suddenly, there were the Tornados’ Beaters, blocking his way to the Snitch, their shoulders almost touching. Potter would have to swerve, losing valuable time. Only he didn’t – Potter flattened himself on his broom, rotating in a kind of corkscrew motion. There was a loud bang and Potter was just a silver blur, cannonballing through the tiny gap between the Tornados, knocking both of them nearly off their brooms. Their drenched capes were flapping behind them furiously.
And then – Draco’s brain did a somersault – Harry actually clapped Liam on the back in what could only be called an approving gesture, and beckoned Draco to follow him to the next floor.

“If I ever find who did this,” he growled, “I’ll tear them apart with my bare hands, I swear.”
“Don’t I?” Draco asked in disbelief. “You are such a self-absorbed prick, Potter. What do you think the Prophet did when the Wizengamot acquitted me? Completely ignore it? Sing my praise? Think they
” Some fourth-year hissed. “Show some respect.”
Potter snorted again and then took stock of the study space. Several people glared at him, which seemed to actually confuse him. Draco nodded his head in Maybe-Adonis’ direction and Harry scrutinised him and then shrugged.
Out of his bag, Blaise pulled a small pink bottle with the cork thankfully still secured. There was a handwritten label pasted across the Wonder Witch logo, reading
“Chaperone,” Draco cut in, making no move to touch Harry, whose confusion was clear on his face. “Hello, Potter. Mathews.”

And Draco flicked his wand before Harry could even begin processing, causing all the buttons to open at once. He leaned over, slung both arms around Harry’s waist and kissed him deeply.
“Is that better?”
“Merlin help us,” muttered Draco as he numbed the area around the scar with essence of valerian. “Alright, I need to see you’re really out before I start.”
He could practically hear how Harry leaned against the door next to him, and Draco doubted that he could make him stop this behaviour and leave. Also, Draco didn’t really

and still looking at Draco over Lauren’s shoulder.
The next article of clothing, which was a glove, she threw at Harry instead of the basket. He caught it easily and threw it back at her in one swift motion. It missed her head entirely and hit her fellow Beater Easton Haynes in the chest. He merely glanced in Harry’s direction, who instantly tried for an innocent expression.
Draco took his chance and cleared off. He found himself some food, sent a waitress over to Potter with the greasiest food she had and then joined Luna and Thomas in a game of Exploding Snap to keep his mind off things. And if he was procrastinating, who could blame him?
“Mrs. Capitelli never does that,” muttered Draco under his breath as they watched Olivia bend over backwards into what was apparently a wheel.
“Hey!” Harry gave him a scandalised look and actually stepped away from him.
“You’re free to switch,” Ella said, indicating the other couches.
When the final piano notes faded away, Potter pressed another button and the Walkman stopped whirring with a click. Draco could only stare at it for a few seconds before abruptly looking up at Potter, who was watching him expectantly.
Draco was getting the impression that he was downplaying his injury so Draco wouldn’t feel too bad.
Or maybe he said
“Er,” said Harry, laughing nervously. “I’ve actually never done Chinese. I also already
“I am very much still into this,” Draco interrupted before Harry could go on a tangent and stray further from the making-out part of the night. “I’m just having a hard time concentrating on more than one thing at once. Your tongue is very distracting.”
Draco stumbled towards the drawer that was closest to him and yanked it open. Was this what being under the influence of Confunding Concoction felt like?
But Harry shook his head, even though it made him grimace in pain. He was also shaking Draco slightly.
The effects were visible almost immediately. McCarthy touched the back of his head gingerly and then blinked at his team mates.
“Maybe he thinks if you ever meet in just your pants, you’ll be
“Potter looks ill. Any minute now he will faceplant into his toast. Anyone want to bet?” and
Goldstein shook his head. “Pritchett has it.” He seemed to realise that this was less than ideal when Draco frowned at him, and added, “But we already ID-ed him. His name’s Barnabas Bones.”
Harry grimaced. “Guess we’ll see which side he’s on when the Prophet comes out tomorrow morning.”
Draco raised an eyebrow expertly, finding solace in the fact that he was neither too drunk nor too freaked out to not be able to still do this. “Your
Draco made a short (and slightly harsh) note in the library catalogue.
A cold hand had taken hold of Draco’s insides and, for a moment, it felt like his heart had stopped, but then it picked up again at twice the usual rate, hammering violently. His hands felt very clammy all of a sudden.

Odysseus was flying some distance away, his head turned in Harry’s direction, as if telling him to stop already. If you knew what to look for, you could even see the tiny scroll of parchment in his talons.
Please consider leaving a comment if you have time. Thank you!
Harry tossed Cuffe’s wand in the general direction of the front desk and then joined Draco at the heap of glass that had once been the front door.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “Yes. We already talked about that.”
Since it was already getting dark outside, this was rather pointless. Draco shook his head, still concentrating on the wounded animal on his table. Potter said something to the serpent and got up, his wand already drawn.
“Save it. My decision is final. I need someone who treats my team like patients, not like their ...
“How is that even possible? We followed the recipe
“Fucking Potter,” he groaned, propping himself up.

“Hope you brought your best quill, Potter,” said Draco as a means of preparing him for what was to come.
Draco stared at her, lost for words. He wasn’t sure he had heard her correctly. Theo giggled and made no attempt at hiding it.
Draco slid to the side, so that only half his body was lying on top of Harry. He propped his head up with a pillow, so he could look him in the eyes properly. His left hand found its way into Harry’s soft (albeit catastrophic) hair.

Though he was anxious to leave Blaise alone with Mulberry, there was nothing Draco could do about it.
“I’m not feeling it,” said Ron at the same time as Draco exclaimed “I don’t think I want to watch a children’s movie after all.”
“That will be the day,” said Draco wistfully. He propped himself up and pointed at the smallest of his scars, just above the navel. “I think you’d best do that one. It’s furthest away from the heart and relatively minor.”
Draco made a detour to the gents to splash some water in his face in an attempt to regain enough of his focus to Apparate home safely. When he came out, he nearly had a heart attack.

“That’s the one,” Draco said, still extremely casually.
Draco had been given a glass of Firewhisky as soon as they arrived and he hadn't let go of it since. The glass was charmed to refill itself constantly, which was a blessing because Draco had taken to have a sip whenever he thought of Potter or his stupid bright eyes or his stupid not-quite-curly hair or his stupid, thoroughly fit body.

Draco immediately grabbed his shoulders again and then steered him right back to the kitchen island, practically forcing him onto the barstool. “Stay. I think Harry has something to apologise for.”
“I see now the damage has already been done. But I must implore you, Draco. Think about what you’re doing with your life. And if you come to your senses, return home.”

Chang was already there, wearing a red, skin-tight dress and sitting at the tiniest table they had, which meant she and Harry would have to sit very close to each other. Perfect for trading secrets.
“You like reading,” repeated Draco.
All of it felt like some remote dream somebody else had told him about, but he felt no small amount of satisfaction at the thought of Dayal dying painfully and all alone.
Then the man cast a look over his shoulder – probably to check out all the surfaces that were available to them – and froze. He turned his back on the woman, blocking her from their view with his body.

Teddy looked like he might faint from pure glee, clutching the grey fabric to his chest for a second.

you or something.”
Potter was looking at it to see what it said?” Draco wasn’t sure if Blaise could see it, but he still rolled his eyes for good measure. “If we’re looking at it that way, then I’m just as much a suspect, because I had a look as well. I’d wager
Two mediwitches rushed in after them, levitating several bottles of Blood Replenishing Potion.
“When you got poisoned on New Year’s Eve and there was an Auror on the suspect list, you said that you trust them because Ron does. What happened to that?”
“Second of all: let's get to the point of this meeting.”

“Yes, thanks,

Draco’s next patient was an emergency, and she didn’t have any time to ask Draco anything, because she was too busy trying not to bleed out. Draco really liked that about her, almost as much as the fact that she
He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to be seeing. Harry was in it, shopping bags in one hand and the other stretched out in front of him. But he was alone, so what had that to do with his girlfriend?
getting hate mail for almost permanently killing the Golden Boy.
Draco cast a diagnostic spell on Harry while Tabitha crouched down next to her own patient. “Comfortable, Jackson?” she said with what sounded like a big, dirty grin on her face.
Harry started a last-ditch effort and yelled, “Draco?”
“Well, then I’d have to break in there every other day, wouldn’t I?”
“Do you access the attic through there?”
He clicked it several times before he was finally ready to take notes.
“You know, Malfoy …” Potter paused, maybe searching for words. “I’m trying not to use spite as my motivation for everything, these days.”
He knew that, as a former Death Eater, he had to act extra carefully at all times. But even his self-restraint had its limits and he drew the line when it came to meddling in his personal affairs.
And besides – McAllister seemed to have found something. Didn’t that validate Draco’s decision?
“Your elbow bone and radial bone are both broken in several places.”
He was already at the stairs when he heard Harry yelling “Draco!” and scampering after him.

Blaise clicked his tongue sharply. “I’m not talking about homework. This is about the
“Your presence will only distract from my brilliance,” Draco said loftily, rubbing his left arm absentmindedly. “Also, I was going to wear those robes.”
“No, please!”
And even though Pembroke promised to keep an eye on Cuffe, who that person was remained a complete mystery.
“Shut it, Malfoy. You know what I mean!” Potter said, putting his arms across his chest. His fingers dug into his upper arms, the knuckles white. It rather looked like he was clinging to himself. So much for his good mood.
“Involuntary!”
There was a loud
There was nothing else for it – Draco Apparated home.

Draco grabbed both of Harry’s shoulders, acutely aware that the tattoo had to be right there, covered by the fingers of his right hand. He leaned down, pressing his lips against Harry’s, who surged up to meet him, knocking him back half a step and tipping him against the bricks.
“Or I’ll haunt you till the day you die.”
red now. “Thanks for the offer, but I’m meeting some friends tonight. Maybe another time?”
There was silence for a few seconds, then:
“Now I understand why my parents did it. Hide all these dangerous artefacts behind glass, I mean.” He took a deep breath. “Feels almost liberating to seal
“Maybe they miscalculated,” Draco thought out loud. “I mean, you were pretty distracted, right? Maybe they thought that would cause you to lose and they didn’t think about whether or not the opponent would dare catch the Snitch.”
“It was spontaneous. Just a short practice to get to know the new guy. We

“So, you could come here, let’s say once a week, tidy up, and if you
He seemed upset, so Draco decided to keep his remarks to himself and unrolled the parchment instead. The writing was neat and even, typical for a Quick-Quotes Quill.
Harry just shrugged, as if he Apparated without a wand all the time. Which, admittedly, he had also done when he had mentally scarred Draco for life by Apparating him to St. Mungo’s a few days ago.
mistake me for your Not-Boyfriend” instead of something wittier, something equally flirtatious.
“I'd never give up blackmail material that easily,” Draco said, waving his hand in dismissal.
“No, it wasn't,” Draco disagreed. “He just led you to believe that it was. As far as
ground?
“I do!” Draco protested. “Aurelius is waiting for me at home!”
“Notify me if you hear anything,” Draco said, and with a half-hearted wave of his hand, he was gone.
Then he placed his wand on the coffee table, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. He knew that it was safer not to give them any reason to attack him.
“You really rained on his parade,” Hermione said, this time with a small smile. “You didn’t care about Greyson’s plans for the team and he started losing bets again. Even worse: other people inside this cartel lost as well, because Greyson couldn’t keep his end of the bargain. So he focused on getting rid of you.”
When the door finally opened again, Harry stuck his head out carefully. It was hard to tell in the dim light, but Draco could have sworn that his face slipped for a split second when he saw him sitting upright in bed.
“Like I didn’t just imagine things. Like you want me–”
“So, how did you keep that from happening to your girlfriend?” Draco asked casually.
And the rest of the morning was spent accusing one another, though nobody at all thought once to look at Draco. He was too relieved to be offended.
Draco washed the blood and dirt off his face and arms while Potter tried to get his own situation under control with a series of cleaning spells. By the time Draco had mended and straightened his clothes, Potter’s face looked like he had scrubbed it with a dandy-brush.
“You must have offended him,” Harry said, grinning. Draco assumed that he was enjoying this immensely.
“No.”
Draco accio-ed a jar of arnica and began dabbing it onto his temple.
“You’ll never know if you don’t test your theory. There’s never gonna be a guarantee.”
“Sounds reasonable so far.”
“God,” groaned Harry, both hands clenching around Draco’s shoulders almost painfully. “You’re killing me.”
“There’s an MMM in bed number thirteen,” she said with a derogatory look over there. “He even asked for you specifically.”
It took another minute of fading laughter and randomly emerging giggles before Draco managed to compose himself and Potter reclaimed his seat.
The other Healers were still trying to subdue Harry, who seemed to have forgotten about Draco again.
“Come off it, Malfoy, we
This had to be a bad joke.
It felt like several seconds until Tabitha looked away. She didn’t say anything after that.
“I’m currently on the fence about
“Why is the light not working?” Potter said, leaning into the fridge and tapping the glass tube at the top.
There was a faint thudding noise and then suddenly, he felt her cool, smooth scales against his bare arm, which was still wrapped around Potter. Draco flinched massively and made a very unmanly noise which he would have described as a whimper, had it not come from him.
. I need to know what he’s like as a Keeper. Focus!”
Harry got to his feet at once and she took his arm and led him out of the pub.
“They’d have to catch us first. We’ll be in and out in no time. Trust me.”

Blaise raised an eyebrow, which was
“You don’t belong together.”
“Did you not notice that?” Draco whispered, looking up into Harry’s face.

Harry had given Samantha a fifteen percent raise and she had graciously offered to handle Draco’s post too, from now on.
“All right, good luck. I would say to break a leg, but don’t,
Ginny grinned as Blaise put a hand inside his pocket and pulled out a small package. Harry’s groan was even louder than Draco’s.
been a favour.
Georgina Thompson chucked a marshmallow at Potter, who caught it in his mouth and grinned at her. “Thanks!” he said and she rolled her eyes.
Up until 9:17 pm on Friday night, Draco’s day had been largely uneventful. He had attended his lectures, he had gone grocery shopping, and then he had even brought himself to go for a jog, despite the constant downpour.
“What? This will tell us who had the opportunity to sign you up. It’s only a very short window of time. They did it during curfew, I’d assume. If we look at the map...” Blaise pulled two of the pages over. “Look. The Hufflepuffs’ common room is closest, then the dungeons. The Ravenclaws and Gryffindors are pretty far up, but I timed it, and it takes about five minutes for both of them, if the stairs align. That’s doable.”
So Destiny had brought her entire collection of Quidditch action figures, which were now flying all over the trauma ward. Draco had tried to tell her parents that the Healers needed to concentrate on saving lives, but all he had gotten in return were unimpressed shrugs.
“He’ll probably be busy for some time,” Draco said numbly. “Once they hear about the Royal London ...”
Oh boy, those were a lot of comments on old and new chapters. I really hope I got you all 😉
“It’s the off-season! Your first game isn’t until January.”
“Good.” It was difficult to be casual about draping a blanket around his naked torso while his secret gay crush was watching, but Draco managed to at least not hit himself in the face doing it. “Am I going to see you in the library on Monday?”
Something bounced off the ground right next to his face, emitting faint sparks, and Draco grabbed the hawthorn wand Harry had taken from him eight years ago and staggered to his feet.
“Uuh, is she fit?” Callum asked, wagging his eyebrows.
, though. Which is

“Haven’t I suffered enough already?” Harry said melodramatically, which was
“Ooh, this is going to be interesting.” Pansy leaned forward and folded her arms on top of the two empty seats in front of her. “Damn, I really hope she’ll release both of them. This is perfect.”

“So,” Lauren said in between bites. “You would tell us if you were secretly assassins, right?”
“Mmh,” said Draco.
There was a slightly different note at the bottom. The parchment was of higher quality and the ink a bright red. The sum at the top must have been a joke, because it was just insanely high. Not just buy-a-racing-broom high. More like take-six-months-off-work high.
Nobody answered.
Harry pulled the other chair a little further away from the table, probably to give her some space. She kept smiling and held her glass up, waiting for him to do the same.
“That’s

from our department, less alone a Marc.”
Draco, who seemed to be much more worried about getting caught, shushed him with a stern look.
He’d been planning on telling Harry that he wouldn’t be able to make dinner because of an extensive emergency healing or something, so he wouldn’t worry needlessly. But
“Don’t you feel that?”

“Please, tell me again.”
Draco drew the Cloak closer around himself and shifted in the chair until he found a more comfortable position. His consciousness was already slipping away from him again.
“God, please don’t ask me that,” said Harry with a groan. “That was either Sarah from Myths or Meghan from Drama. It’s really hard to tell with her hair open like that.”
“Unsure as of now.” Her voice was warm and uplifting.
.” She smiled again, and it was a bit stronger than before. “He’s been keeping vigil at your bedside for the last thirteen days.”
Blaise shook his gavel, as if to strengthen the pointing. “Silence, Malfoy.”
“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
“I’ll do you and you’ll do me.”
“When they stop, we’ve left the grounds.”

Where did Potter
Maybe he could Confund her? But Harry wouldn’t like it and Draco was already on thin ice with the Ministry after what he’d done on the day of Harry’s accident, Order of Merlin or not.
The chair scraped across the floor as Harry turned to face him full-on. “Then why did you do it?”
“You call your parents
But he didn’t explain what all those detours were about, deciding to escape into the kitchen instead. Draco took another minute to compose himself before following him. He definitely needed a cup of tea now. His stomach was in a considerable uproar.
Pansy moved into Draco’s line of sight. “Volunteering ends at ten.”
him to snoop around,” muttered Draco. “I only showed him the signature Potter faked in the library catalogue. The rest was entirely Blaise.”
“What about you?” Harry asked cheekily while Draco shone a Lumos first at his left and then his right pupil. Who would have thought that he ever would get paid to stare at Harry Potter’s eyes?
“That one doesn’t fit, though. The Cannons could have won, but they

long enough and then took a step back. Draco let him go reluctantly. He was all for more contact, not less. Less was a stupid idea.
“Before that,” Draco interrupted. “Olivia was so absent-minded. She kept badmouthing me, and it was so uncharacteristic for her. I saw it in your Pensieve. She called me
“I can
Draco didn’t attempt to stop her or accompany her to the door, which shut audibly a few seconds later.
The Healers had to purify Potter’s blood three times over as many hours until the poison was completely cleared out. Since they did not know how or with what Potter had been poisoned, it was hard to tell what the long-term consequences would entail.
Yeah, I'm posting daily now!
Potter groaned, which he took as a good sign. Conscious and not overly hostile – he could work with that. Draco put a hand on Potter’s shoulder, testing the waters. He flinched slightly, but at least Draco got to keep his hand.
. I stayed in bed for over a day. That should be proof enough, shouldn’t it? Also,
“Oh, shut up,” Draco grumbled. “Know what your official statement will be?”
So, since yesterday’s chapter wasn’t that long and the next one is rather short too (and also, I can’t wait to post chapter 17!), here’s the next one already.
“I didn’t know it was

“That bitch!” pressed Harry out through clenched teeth. He jumped to his feet and whipped out his wand. “I’m gonna –!”
“Alright, not St. Mungo’s,” Potter said (without even complaining?) and let go of him again. “Then let’s take the tube; there is a station in your area.”
Ron just shrugged, still grinning like the bastard he was.
“You seem to be forgetting that you assaulted me on
,” whispered Blaise desperately. “He only turned back into himself a few minutes ago. That’s why I decided to get you.”
Draco felt like turning around to glare at Harry, but he was worried it would look more like a child seeking reassurance from its mother. It couldn’t be so bad, right? Harry had done it at the age of thirteen! And he would be safe from Nivaria’s talons and beak, at least. There was still the risk of falling, but that didn’t scare him that much – he’d been only five years old when his parents had hired his first flying instructor.
The only thing Draco’s gut had to say about the situation was a traitorous rumble.
She looked from Harry to Draco and back. “Oh, so you

people.
Draco stood up and gestured at his seat. “There, you can sit here. I need to find something to eat anyway.”
Blaise caught his eyes and motioned with one hand to stay seated.
The resolution was this: Regular exercise, focus on college, and keep out of trouble. Well, the third part was about to get royally fucked, but that was hardly Draco’s fault, was it? He was only focusing on the first part right now, and that was already miserable enough.

Draco did have a theory, but it involved actually

Well, this certainly wasn’t self-explanatory. “What did

Draco frowned. “You’re going to meet in London? I thought she

“Because she

“Bloody Slytherins.” Nash sighed and bumped his shoulder. “Props, though. Now,
He put on his Invisibility Cloak as soon as he reached the staircase and Disapparated just outside the building (where only three of the reporters’ tents were still standing).
Draco pushed the wheelchair through a small gap between two tables, which magically widened to let them pass and narrowed as soon as they were through. None of the Muggles took any notice.
...” Draco muttered, but there wasn’t much to follow it up with that Harry couldn’t disagree with. “Cortez will probably kick me out.”
Draco shrugged half-heartedly and managed to make his voice sound bored instead of hesitant when he said, “Guess so.”
“I’d like to kill him all over again,” Harry pressed out, flexing his hands. “Only more violently this time.”

Then she glanced at both her partners, who didn’t seem to have noticed anything besides the obvious rage, and then at Draco, who didn’t have to use Legilimency to see that she had noticed it too –
watching that!) and said, “Debateable.”
Draco craned his head out from the bottom bunk and found Courtney Nash looking down at him from the top one.
“Sanders has been excited about getting to work with you since Friday,” Draco objected.
“Oh, Dean and I broke up,” Luna said lightly, smiling at Dean, who was sitting right beside her. Several people made noises of protest and disbelief.
Something was trying to wriggle its way to the forefront of Draco’s mind, though he couldn’t quite grasp it.
hold a Council meeting!” said Blaise urgently, looking over at Pansy for support. “We have to find out who signed you up!”
“It was nothing,” Potter said half-heartedly. Draco just raised an eyebrow, inspecting the scar. “
I think I saw him in the library earlier.”
Draco hadn’t trusted computers before and he certainly didn’t after that incident. Unfortunately, his professor still wouldn’t accept handwritten papers, no matter how much Draco argued.
This seemed like something he could handle, so he took off with just a nod in her direction.
Disappointment washed over him when he opened his eyes and saw only the same faint mist he’d already produced on his own. “That’s pathetic.”
“So, did you get somewhere with that?”
When Weasley’s general flying evaluation was over, there were only two sixth-year girls left to try out against Potter as Seeker.
Draco inhaled deeply and told himself that it was exactly like that. It was time for him to relax. These were his last few moments in solitude, and then the others would return from dinner and start their weekend full of hours upon hours to bug him. He had until the morning to get enough of a grip to be able to face his housemates, and another two days until he had to face Potter again.
Not that Draco would recommend them for children, American or not.
Harry was still lying on his stomach, so Draco turned him onto his back with massive effort. The ropes around his torso fell away, limp and unmoving, severed cleanly.
This seemed to be a dumb question, because the laughter intensified again. Lauren’s long, dark hair, which she was wearing in a bun, was starting to come undone from all the shaking.
“Can’t –” Harry pressed out, completely out of breath, “My wand!”

clear him?”
Harry shook his head immediately. Draco’s eyebrows rose to heights he wouldn’t have thought possible before.
Draco searched the pitch for Potter and found him standing right beside Weasley. They both were pointing at different fliers and arguing about them. It all culminated in Weasley stomping her foot and pointing at a spot on the other side of the pitch. Potter threw his head back in disbelief and then, completely out of the blue, hugged her to his side for a second and then willingly went, all the while laughing to himself.
“Still. It’s only nine. What do you want to do?”
“I’ll just eat yours, there you have it.” Draco smirked to himself as he searched.
“About?” Draco got started on the Frog’s remains. His eyes stayed fixed on Potter’s neck, which was overstretched so he could stare at the high ceiling and avoid Draco’s eyes in the process.
For a moment, Harry did nothing. Then he closed his eyes, a small smile on his lips. He raised the hawthorn wand wordlessly and a bright, silver stag broke from it. It pranced around the two of them once, orbiting them like their own personal moon, and then turned to mist.
“Still better than those look-alike pin-up calendars, isn’t it?”
“Okay?” Harry was still rubbing his arms, but slower now.
“Oh, I’m not –” Harry tried to clarify.
?” Harry stood in front of their tiny, round kitchen table, one hand buried in his hair in a rather confused gesture. He turned to Lauren for an explanation.
Somebody was knocking at his door. Actually
It was the Room of Requirement all over again, only now they were caught at the bottom with no way to escape the masses raining down on them, striking them in the side with pointy edges and heavy bodies, burying them underneath.
with him? It was probably because he had seen so much of Potter lately. He would just try to keep out of his way tonight and everything would go back to normal eventually.
“He’s dating Kimbrough, though,” said Draco helpfully. It was the least he could do for her.
Still shaking his head, Draco gave the password and left Blaise to his empty corridor. He’d just have to hope that he would give up before midnight, when Harry was supposed to come.
“Owlery.” Draco held up a slightly crumpled letter. “To thank my mother for the sweets she sent.”
“You didn’t look all that peaky when we met at the Manor. You were a hot mess, to be honest.”
“Come again?” Draco said, dumbfounded. “Didn’t you use the ‘

The snake ladder was already fully formed when Draco caught up with him. They climbed it and approached the Pensieve, which came to life immediately.
“Okay,” said Draco, who never had anyone confess their romantical love for him before. “Good.”
“Rude,” said Draco, but he took the proffered chocolate, placed it by the edge of his table (just in case he should be in need of ammunition later) and then mimed locking his mouth.
Draco just nodded dumbly, not sure if his voice would even work right now. Harry kissed him again for a moment that wasn’t
“Greyson clearly wanted it to look like an accident, so he blew up the gas stove. We searched for you, but found Aurelius instead. I told Kreacher to take him to the Scamander Centre and bring Ron to my house afterwards. I thought maybe you had gone there to hide. I didn’t think
” he shouted, and immediately something dark and mishappen burst forth, landing on its legs – though Draco couldn’t say how many it had, because it kept shifting and twisting, and looking at it felt like using Legilimency on a dementor.
“Well, the mats are comfortable.”
Potter was waiting for him outside the library. By the way he was holding on to the straps of his backpack, Draco deduced that he was nervous. At least that was something.
“Mr. Potter,
“That’s not what the Sorting Hat said,” Potter said.
“Listen –,” Draco said shortly, glancing at her name tag, “Sarah. We’ll talk later, alright? But this is a business meeting.”
If they hadn’t been forced to memorize Potter’s fucking birthday for their History of Magic exam in second year, Draco wouldn’t have known it either. And then they’d just gone and
“Oh, did you bring him?” she said excitedly. “No, I haven't seen him at

Did that mean that Draco’s obsession – no, that was a bit much, let’s call it a curiosity – about Potter and Blaise’s
empty after all. Draco looked into it and watched a younger Harry, fourteen at most, trying to slam the door shut before a very big, very angry man could get at him. It was no use – the man slammed against the door so hard that it knocked Harry right over.
. Under no circumstances can you throw anything away, understood? And if you sense anyone in here, you come directly to me and tell me.”
“Hey!” Harry protested, crossing his arms. “I’ll have you know I’m an excellent Apparater. The odds of getting Splinched were never even ten percent. I never Splinched
want you! But not right now and not like this!” Draco wasn’t completely sure why he was screaming.
He was shaking (probably from anger) and barely managed to pull the glamour over his head one-handedly.
Ah shit.
Potter looked down at it as if seeing it for the first time. “Oh, I do. Thanks.”
And then he got out of there as fast as he could and Disapparated from the first side-alley he could find.
“Don’t bother, Teddy,” said Harry, smiling at Felicity nastily. “Reserve players don’t get cards.”
Draco’s mind was working overtime. It would certainly not do to have an invisible Potter running around the house while under the influence of Confunding Concoction. What he needed was a distraction.
“I haven’t had anything since this morning,” he told himself as he unwrapped it.
“Draco?”
“How did you –” the man spluttered.
Oh, boy, here they went again. Draco glanced at Harry, whose smile had turned a little strained. There was the flash of a camera and Harry flinched a little.

Theo seemed puzzled. “Did Potter just run from you?”
“I’m confused,” said Draco finally, which was also the first sentence he had gotten in since Potter had started. “Patroclus is Achilles’ … brother in arms, basically? And what’s
“After the Ministry? You don’t mean after what happened at the Department of Mysteries, right?” Draco knew for a fact that Granger had not had a license then. None of them had been seventeen.

Draco went down onto the pitch. If the Aurors had been here, it seemed rather futile, but he pointed his wand toward the forest nonetheless.
Draco only realised he’d let go of Ron’s arm when both he and Hermione grabbed one of Draco’s arms from either side, keeping him on his seat.
“You are not gay,” Draco pointed out.
“That’s because you’re a Gryffindor,” said Draco matter-of-factly. “And Olivia –“
Somebody sneezed next to him and Draco opened his eyes. Feathers were slowly sailing down upon them, covering them like a thin blanket of snow.
”. Then they rounded a corner and were gone.
Blaise followed him to the door. “That bad?”
Draco crossed his arms. “I’ll not encourage such childish behaviour!” Then he crossed his legs too, demonstrating that he was not going anywhere.
Draco decided to omit the fact that he had tried to avoid Potter at any cost. It wasn’t relevant and might have looked suspicious.
“You get used to it,” Draco said. “He mostly does it in the winter. Blaise reckons he’s curious about the lights.”
, of course. Be glad you don’t have
Draco checked to see if Brankovitch was watching that debacle, in case it was something he needed to rub in later – provided Harry’s earlier behaviour wasn’t enough to tease him about.
“I think so ...”

with my parents.”
“That buffoon,” Goldstein muttered. “Who picks a fight with a whole Quidditch team?”
“I wish.”
“Chin up,” said Draco in an admittedly futile attempt to cheer him up. And who was he to talk, anyway? He had been crying at least once a day until only a week ago. But Draco was trying to forget about that. “It’s just half an hour of stunt-flying, right? You do that all the time at practice.”
“Okay, ladies.” The attention was back on Olivia without her so much as raising her voice. “Partner up, please.”
“Come off it, Blaise,” said Pansy, not even looking away from her own reflection. “Nobody here is sneaking Gryffindors into their dormitory.”
of us do have integrity, you know?”
“Well …”
Potter kept his head down and said in a faux-natural tone, “Sounds like the same one.”
“Should’ve put that in your vows,” Draco said with a grin of his own.
“This was Sheila’s costume party last Halloween, yes?” asked Abby.
Everything was sorted by category and then by colour, and Draco felt like he had just stepped inside the storeroom of Twilfitt and Tattings. He could see instantly that these clothes were high-quality and fashionable – safe for a small section that seemed to consist of leisure wear. Draco recognised almost everything from
“That’s incredibly sad.” Granger clicked her tongue and then turned around and left him standing there without another word or any kind of explanation.
He cleared his throat and managed to say, “I don’t think he’s up to something.
“I’m sorry, Healer Malfoy has taken the rest of the night off. I’ll find you another Healer.”
“What else would I be doing?” said Draco drily.
. To hide was to admit defeat.
Draco just nodded along. “Yes, I heard …
of December. And
“Don’t know,” Draco whispered back, even though his spells should still be up. “Make a light.”
And so they went inside, Hermione, Ron and Draco with his shadows, both with their hands placed on their wand holsters. Draco wasn’t sure what they were expecting him to do, wandless as he was.
“How would she find out about your lack of a license?” If she hadn’t somehow managed to eavesdrop at the window.
“Always telling it like it is,” Slughorn said with a chuckle. “Just the other day I told one of my students, Gwendolyn Worthington, how refreshing it is to talk to you. You might know her mother, Glenda Worthington? She’s lead-designer at Spudmore Brooms. Practically developed the Firebolt Gold single-handedly, you know.”
Instantly, goosebumps erupted all over Draco’s arms. His stomach was a nervous mess. Who would have thought his first 'real' kiss would take place in the
He was so damn tired. Draco couldn’t help but close his eyes. He’d just rest for a moment ….
“He asked all those things outright?”
“No, believe me, I’ve definitely got some good memories.” Draco threw his wand on the coffee table. He was frustrated and also horny from reliving all those sex scenes.
Finding Potter’s friends wasn’t hard at all. As soon as they entered, several people at a huge table in the back cheered. Potter waved at them eagerly and then took Draco by the arm and dragged him over there. As if Draco would flee if the opportunity presented itself. Which, admittedly, he was still thinking about.
“Yeah,” Potter said thoughtfully, brushing a hand through his hair.
“I'm assuming you
The knocking was getting so loud that the dog from upstairs began to join in to the ruckus, so Draco forewent underwear and just pulled them on like that. The bottoms were roomy enough to hide pretty much anything.
too nosey for him to handle.
Only after unwrapping the Chocolate did Draco realise that Potter had made him do it. Well, it was too late now. Draco stared him dead in the eyes and bit the Frog’s head off.
“Well, it seems that he obtained a sample of Polyjuice Potion containing Squib hair at an illegal Polyjuice Party.” If Ron noticed the look Draco and Harry exchanged, he didn’t show it. “Maybe he thought he wouldn’t leave a signature that way. He was just lucky that we didn’t have it already and he wasn’t a suspect to begin with.”
Draco could feel it getting stuck inside his head the moment the two met.
“Oh. As your guinea pig,” Potter said, taking a step back. “The scar thing. I’ve got a few cursed ones you could practice on.”
And before either of them could say anything else, she grabbed the third box, opened it and took out grey and white Quidditch robes, the Falcon emblazoned on the front and Potter’s name and the number seven embroidered on the cape. The robes looked much cleaner than the ones Draco had seen him play in, the white of it almost blinding.
“No. The second time didn’t leave a scar.”
“You can’t wear the
Draco took several calming breaths and flipped through the magazine until he found Chang’s picture smack in the middle.
Harry leaned over and took something out of his night stand. He held a simple silver ring up above their faces.
Draco took his time strolling over to bed number thirteen.
from Potter. In short: he was doing this for his sanity. He wouldn’t even have to look at Potter while he was in there.
Potter dropped the backpack in the sand between the swings and then took his seat again. In his hands he held a small grey apparatus with dials and buttons at the side. He pushed one of them and the thing started whining in a high pitch immediately. Potter made a discontented noise and rolled his eyes.
“You deserve that,” Draco said unperturbedly. “How else will a Gryffindor ever learn?”

on the lookout for people watching him.
“What’s eating you?” Potter had put his diagrams down and was watching him from his place in front of the fire.
All he got in response was Harry shaking his head and muttering, “Nothing. Let’s
“You have no idea.”
“And how long do you think
And then there it was, at last. Potter was entering the sixth-floor boys’ bathroom, where Draco stood at the sink, a nervous wreck. Was it shock that showed on Potter’s face when he saw him there? They were looking at each other in the mirror, his own face contorting furiously. Draco was attacking, Potter defending himself.
Draco grabbed his arm before he could take so much as a step forward. “I don’t give a fuck about the Patronus! Get rid of it!”

Two tiny Ravenclaws took one look at him and skedaddled, which told Draco’s battle-honed survival instincts that he should probably be running too. Maybe in the other direction, though – he’d probably get into trouble if he scared them even further. Draco looked back just before he reached the corner, but thankfully, the corridor remained empty.
There was panic in her eyes now, which Potter chose to ignore in favour of finishing his speech. “That’s why I want him for the team. I don’t trust anyone else to have our best interests at heart.”

To Draco’s disappointment, Harry didn’t even flinch when Draco flung some water at him. “
“I don’t think I will be able to make it to lunch,” Draco said tonelessly, trying to fight the sense of impending doom that was overtaking him. Abandoning his post was a pretty good reason to get fired. “You’d better take the Floo home.”
“Yes, I’m aware.” Potter rummaged through his bag, produced

“Fuck everybody,” Draco said. “You don’t have to care about everybody. The people that really matter won’t take these things seriously anyway and the rest can piss right off.”
“Why?” said Draco in near-desperation. “You
The grin slipped off Harry’s face as Teddy looked up at him nervously.
“Malfoy!” Harry growled, clutching the snake sweater to his chest.
“–before the holidays are over.”
Somehow that didn’t make him feel better.
“Anyway!” Harry interrupted quite rudely. “Oliver wouldn’t
“Damn it, Draco. Stop distracting me! I’m trying to carry my anger into the morning, when I can finally go and find that bitch!”
“And how would I have done that? Did I throw a match at her too?” Potter was really surging up now.
“Well, my money’s still on Potter,” Pansy said viciously. “Do you think it could have been him?”
“You’ve made your decision, now you’ve got to live with it.”
that was because of the dementors,” Harry pressed out. “You try flying while Voldemort murders your parents and your mother pleads for your life.”
It took nearly twenty minutes until Harry was finally allowed to leave the scene. He looked even more exhausted than after a six-hour match. He was dragging his broom over the grass and looking all around pathetic.
you wouldn’t believe it.”
Harry’s hand stopped moving and there was a moment of shocked silence. “When you say you don’t date … Bloody hell, Draco. There were so many filthy rumours about what you Slytherins got up to in your dungeon. Are you telling me those were all utter rubbish?”
?” somebody yelled.
Then there was another shout of “Giddyap!” and Harry shot by them not a second later, sitting atop an enormous hippogriff with feathers as dark as his hair. Nivaria let out an indignant cry and followed after them immediately.
I had a really, really good time reading all about your misery, thanks! 🤗 Also, those were the most comments any of the chapters ever got, I think, which tells me what you really want is to see Harry half-dead all the time? 🤔 I’ll keep that in mind!

fired!” Harry growled, clutching his broken arm again.
He sat down at the kitchen table and ate one of the fortune cookies, chewing it slowly. Aurelius lay down across his feet, which felt nice. Draco unfolded his fortune.
“Alright,” said Potter, looking back at him. “But that one’s Muggle.”
Draco really wished Harry wouldn’t brush a hand through his stupid hair right now. This was the exact opposite of a casual reaction. Nobody

The witch paused and adjusted her glasses before continuing to read from her file.
“We’ve got a search warrant for both your houses,” said Jenkins sternly. She pressed a roll of parchment into his hands. “Where is he?”
“I learned from the worst!”
Draco said none of that, pulling the blanket up to his chin. “Do you know where they are now? The Muggles.”
But Draco never got to know the answer, because suddenly, the guy was kissing him. Draco's mind was moving a bit slower than usual, which was why he froze on the spot, one hand still on Aurelius' head. Not-Potter backed off almost instantly.
Harry just yelled “Bye!” and then they were out of the door before anyone could stop them. In silence they walked down the busy street until they finally found a deserted side alley.

Potter cleared his throat and lowered his wand. To Draco’s great relief, he didn’t react to the blunder and said instead, “Hermione will know.”

“We really do, and not just because you’re with Harry. Though that’s also a pretty big part of it, of course. You go well together. It’s a relief to see him happy again, opening up a bit. We never knew, you know? About his childhood. He never talked about it before. Hermione mentioned something about his parents once, and of course we know he has nightmares, even though he tries to hide them; but that was about it.”
McCarthy groaned, opened his eyes just a little bit and then promptly sickened up. Draco, who had seen it coming, pressed a bowl into his hands just a second before it happened and then vanished it afterwards.

“Well, I’ve got to say, you have seen better days,” said Draco, leafing through the topmost stack of papers while he came over and sat down on the chair next to her bed. “So, what the hell happened? Don’t tell me you just fell off your broom.”
They were silent for a minute, save for the sound of their footsteps on the stairs.

” one of the girls called after the child, which had dashed away to look for empty seats. Draco glanced at Potter, who had tensed up all of a sudden, but kept his eyes closed.
When she let go of him, she was smiling more easily. “See? I keep telling people you’re not nearly as cold as you’d like to be.”
them?”
“Who are you?” he growled, closing his free hand around the other’s throat. He wouldn’t get an answer like that, but Draco wasn’t going to take chances now.
Draco nodded and pulled him down again to steal another kiss. “You could have warned me, you know?”
“Shut up,” said Draco. He let go of Potter’s wrist, tried for a second to untangle the other – Potter held on stubbornly – and then pulled him closer with just one hand at his neck.
“Shame,” muttered Harry, and then his hand moved again.
Draco thought it would have been kinder had Potter just beheaded the elf straightaway. Kreacher was close to tears, his tiny hands fisted into his toga with the Hogwarts crest on it. His mouth was opening and closing but no sound came out and Draco was rather certain that, at some point, Potter had forbidden the elf from arguing about this.

He knew that Harry had suspected something in the memory he had given Draco, but that was just as gone as the kitchen drawer he had put that in. Or his whole kitchen, for that matter.

“So, I treated the most spoilt child in history today,” Draco said when they were alone again.
“I didn't know Dean Thomas was from an old wizarding family,” Draco said suspiciously, ignoring the second part of Potter's sentence.
He tried to convince Meadows when he finally showed up.
He had trouble thinking with Harry’s hair smelling like mint and his mouth tasting like those cherry-flavoured shots. And then there was his hand at the back of Draco’s neck and his body pressed against Draco’s and – Merlin, Draco was on fire.
“Oh, is that what it is called?”
Draco frowned at Tabitha. He wasn’t really interested in playing guessing games. He had patients.
“We’re moving in together,” Harry rushed out all at once.
“Master is being attacked. Kreacher has to defend his Master!”
“What?” said Harry.

“What the hell?”
Harry stood up and went over to the window, looking out at the obligatory crowd of fans and reporters hoping to catch a glimpse of him. In an instant his posture was rigid, hands curled into fists at his sides. He didn’t seem to know how to answer the question.
to know what this was all about. But Draco was no Golden Boy. He had to think about his future, which was already looking far from peachy.
David turned around with his wand in one hand and a whistle in the other. He blew it and the number seven flashed across the empty scoreboard at the same time. The Bludgers froze in mid-air, as did most of the players, all of whom were looking down at them.
over the years.
He summoned a set of vital vials from downstairs and charmed them to float in the air above Potter. He was just attuning them to him, when suddenly –
“I just heal very fast!”
“Thanks,” Draco said sheepishly, picking up his fork again. “What’s with you; are you in a hurry or something?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It took Draco about a minute after Potter finally left on the stroke of ten to realise that he had left the glittery Snitch on the edge of Draco’s table.
“I will hex you; I
it any minute now.”
“Draco,” she finally said, clearly unimpressed.
She looked at Harry again.
Potter's healing process was advancing according to plan, but two and a half weeks after his accident, he had still not woken up. They had lifted the magically induced coma and were waiting for him to recover his consciousness on his own now.
Harry was glowing too, but it was very different. His tan chest stood out against the blinding white of his toga. The golden laurel wreath in his hair contrasted magnificently with his black curls. He wasn’t wearing glasses and his green eyes were just doing their usual thing, and that was maybe the most infuriating aspect of them all.
Aurelius wagged his tail excitedly. In front of the couch, he had placed not one, but three pairs of shoes despite Draco still wearing his hospital trainers.
Sighing inwardly, Draco pointed his wand at a torn-up page and watched as it repaired itself. “Then why the fuck do
Lauren picked up some kind of miniature mat, which was certainly thicker than the ones Olivia had.
“That doesn’t count; you were completely helpless. I can’t even remember if you fought back at all.”
There was a knock at the door before Harry could reply. They disentangled quickly, sitting up to face the door. It was Nash, accompanied by a mediwitch who was levitating their breakfast trays.
“Quit fishing for compliments. It’s embarrassing.”

Draco grinned and said, “I really need you to take off those robes, though.”

“Thanks for reminding me.”
Now Harry hesitated. “You didn’t?”
to treat me. Where’s Lyster?”
Draco made a noise that could have been mistaken for a
Draco took a swig of his water to make sure his mouth was completely empty before saying, “That sounds slightly …”
The muscles in his arms twitched dangerously and Draco wasn’t sure if he could hold him back for real if it came to that.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat at being addressed like this by Potter. He grimaced, a look that was immediately mirrored on Potter’s face. That was what instant regret looked like.
“I’m not a private investigator,” he said firmly. “Keep your gold.”
“There is no one on the other side,” Draco said. “Granger looked like she was going to pull an all-nighter, so Weasley will probably stay up late as well, right?”
It was already half past eleven when Draco could finally end his shift on Ella’s birthday. He stopped by his house to change (desperately wishing he could just wear something short-sleeved for once – it was just
you went down to the shore, alright?”
Draco’s heart was racing and his mind was spinning fast. What had they been thinking? That they could forget everything that had happened between them? That their past didn’t matter because they weren’t trying to kill each other any longer?
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” said Liam, winking at Draco, who managed nothing more than to stare back at him, completely startled.

“Great idea,” Draco said sarcastically. “Tell me, which scar do you want me to use?”
Draco put up a hand to stop him before he could begin. “Yes, he may be very knowledgeable when it comes to his creatures, but he has no idea how to convey any of it. Also, his methods are downright dangerous.”
“Well, keeping quiet never got me anywhere!”
Maybe this wasn’t exactly the right song for the occasion.
Harry didn’t look amused. “This is worse! It’s spreading across the pond! Now some poor American children think I’m some kind of picture book protagonist!”

“I don’t know, mate.” Ron gave him an apologetic grin. “They looked pretty … stiff, you know? Definitely overkill.”
“That was the loudest movie I’ve ever watched,” Draco said to get his involvement in the conversation out of the way. Harry snorted, for which Hermione put her hand on his foot discreetly and pressed down. Harry pulled his foot away and shut his mouth.
“You must be Draco’s friends, right? Theresa and Max?”
Draco had a closer look, feeling the scar tissue with his gloved fingers. “What got you?”
“I … don’t know what that means,” said Draco honestly, frowning down at the torn page in his hand and then back at Potter.
“Where is it?” he simply said.
When Draco unpacked his food, he discovered that they hadn’t given him two fortune cookies, despite him having ordered two dishes – there were eleven. Jian had probably stuck both her hands inside the box and given him as many as she could grab.
“Can’t hear,” Draco mumbled, sitting up slowly.
Theo’s hands remained frozen in the air. Blaise couldn’t hide his disappointment at having failed to intimidate him. Draco smiled.
There were footsteps and then somebody slung one arm around his waist. Draco pulled off the hood of Harry’s Invisibility Cloak and kissed him.
“Don’t even joke about it,” Harry said glumly.
“More than I already did?”
. Also, Potter
But then Narcissa went on, and it wasn’t what he’d thought she would say. “We didn’t defy the Dark Lord so you could turn your back on us. We did it to save our family, to ensure that the bloodline continues.”
“Malfoy!” someone called across the room and then Weasley was at his side. “Have you come to give your statement?”
“Tell me you did
She stopped when harsh voices reached them from the hallway, and then the door was pushed open and Greyson rushed in, Felicity close on his heels and talking at him insistently.

. Excellent.
He had entertained the possibility of testing the spells on himself, but he wouldn't be able to use his magic properly if he was wounded. No, it had to be someone else. And he knew perfectly well
“What’s that got to do with
Draco took a moment to think about it, savouring the feeling of Harry’s arm draped around him and their bodies pressed together.
“He does now, but you can never know for sure. His condition could shift in an instant. Do you think you can get Greyson to pull him from the match?”
“I don’t –
. So, I wouldn’t exactly call us
Nivaria and Draco overtook them in less than three wing beats, and she let out another cry, which was echoed several times from down below. There was a commotion and when Draco looked back, all of the remaining hippogriffs took flight as one. He looked over to see Harry grinning broadly, and then Maggy caught up to him on the biggest hippogriff Draco had ever seen. That one was definitely more alpha material!
coincidence that he had come across Harry six times already, and they’d only gone to the pub afterwards like twice!)
“That’s fine,” said Draco before anybody could protest.
“What’s that?” asked Theo and Draco snatched up the tie in a flash, stuffing it underneath his mattress.
“No,” said Harry hotly. “I’ll answer that stupid question alright.” He glared at Houghton so intensely that Draco wouldn’t have been surprised to see him burst into flames.
, alright?”
Of course he would. Draco didn’t get to reply, because then it happened:
“You could catch up with us on Christmas Eve,” Potter said suddenly.
Title: The Phantoms – Watch Me
“Maybe she would have reacted differently, had the situation presented itself more favourably?” Draco suggested, squeezing Potter’s arm lightly.
“You made me wait,” Draco said pointedly, pulling him over to the stairs.
“Come on,” said Draco calmly. He tried to take Harry’s bag from him, but he wouldn’t let go. Draco sighed and placed a hand against Harry’s back instead, more pushing than guiding him towards the door. “I’ll take you home and tonight I’ll tell you everything I legally can.”
sure you want to do this tonight?”

“Er – no,” said Potter, sitting on the bed in what appeared to be joggers and a short-sleeved t-shirt. Not exactly his Quidditch get-up.
Nash, who was standing at Draco’s head, stepped aside and then Draco saw him – Harry fucking Potter, still alive after all
“Seems like Cuffe knows he crossed the line again,” Draco said casually.
, a small voice in the back of Draco’s head supplied. This was a real opportunity. And also a chance to see less of people like the Swans, who were just horrible excuses for human beings.
“Alright, tell me.”
“Flew off with one of the younger hippogriffs. Just stole it from right underneath my nose. Don’t do that, or I’ll sick the herd on you.” She drew her wand from somewhere inside her braid and twirled it with an exaggerated glare.
“Finally!”
Harry still had his system, a place for everything, but Draco had learned to live with it and rarely misplaced things nowadays.
The whole right side of Potter’s face was black and blue, as was his arm. At least the part of it that Draco could see. The lower part of it was bandaged excessively, making it appear twice as thick. The sleeve of his shirt had been cut open at the side and it was quite dirty and also somewhat bloodied.
And it was hitting him square in the chest, slicing him open. And his blood was mingling with the water from a smashed sink, painting the floor red where he was lying, while Potter was dropping to the ground beside him, horror in his eyes.
“Australia,” Potter said shortly, grabbing his shot glass and gulping it down. He looked rather miserable. Draco’s stomach twisted oddly.
“Hey, no name calling!”
Potter laughed. “You lot can’t even remember my team’s name; I think nobody is queuing up anytime soon.”
She swayed lightly, staring at him unblinkingly like always. Then she hissed something, an answer maybe, but of course Draco didn’t understand.
There were no new list entries for the whole week. Draco would’ve thought that this would reassure people, but the Slytherins seemed to be more and more on edge the more time passed.
I don’t think that!” Harry turned around now. “Patronuses are good for a lot of things! Let’s say there’s an emergency. You can’t send an owl, that would take ages.”
“But it’s
Draco looked up at him and said generously, “In that case … I guess you can keep that one.”
He pulled out another clipping, which was basically a full-page photograph of a young woman lying in bed and sleeping. The picture was obviously taken from above, probably through a rooflight.
does everybody keep calling her that?”
“Oh, that’s smart. That’s exactly how I got you.”
Draco didn’t have time to answer. Bones made a grab for Goldstein’s wand, which the idiot held loosely at his side. Draco acted fast – the wand flew from Bones’ hand as the Expelliarmus hit him.
He needed a distraction, and fast.
Something odd washed over him, like another, much fainter pressure wave, and Draco opened his eyes.
Draco didn’t miss the way his hand twitched towards his pocket where his wand was likely hidden.
“That bloody snitch!”
Her fist slammed into his chest instead and he stumbled and slammed against the wall behind him.
“You’re Harry bloody Potter. Not
They went down to Trafalgar Square with their pizzas and sat down on the steps to eat. The night was clear and warm and there was a pleasant breeze going. Draco watched Harry stuff his face with four cheese pizza and tried to think of a time when things had ever been as easy as this. Then Harry looked at him and smiled happily, and a warm feeling spread out from Draco’s stomach. He doubted it had anything to do with the pizza.
For a second Draco didn’t know what to say. He hadn’t even
“Thanks,” said Harry, and then he stepped up, got on his tiptoes and placed the wreath back on Draco’s head. “That really suits you,” he added with a smile, and Draco’s protest about dirty streets died before it was born.
The headline read
“I haven’t the slightest idea what the fuck you’re talking about, Potter. As per usual. But it’s alright, it’s probably the concussion talking.”
“You seem happy,” said Draco drily. “Did you get Potter? Heard he doesn’t really live up to his reputation.”
me?” Draco tried to sound outraged, but he couldn’t help but be amused by the blunt statement. “My Order of Merlin would like to disagree.”
out.”
Harry cut in immediately. “Puff.”
Draco couldn’t help but flash him a cocky grin and Potter grinned right back at him.
It did no good. The wand was pressed against his temple even harder. The arm around Draco’s throat was so tight that it felt like his windpipe was about to get crushed.
with all this? He usually ate some cereal for breakfast, but that was completely missing from Potter’s pantry. All he managed to find was some bread and jam in a plain jar.
She grabbed the back of a chair for support. Her messenger back slipped from her shoulder and Draco only just managed to catch it. She didn’t look like she would be able to hold it, so he leaned it against his chair.
“See,” said Harry with a cocky grin, “Not cursed. Would you
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “You’re giving them a lecture for arguing about the fucking

revenge plan when he actually came up with it. Until then, the fear of retaliation would keep Potter on edge.
Harry groaned and sat up on top of Draco so he could see the kitchen window over the back of the couch. Even from down there, Draco could tell that he was glaring.
The essence had to be vaporised very slowly until only a few crystals would remain, which he would then crush and mix with aloe vera juice. Draco had at least an hour to kill until that point would be reached, so he followed Aurelius upstairs into the sitting room.
Schuster made a face and beckoned him to follow.
“What did you mean last night?” he whispered, searching for an answer in Potter’s face. Potter looked up at him questioningly, cocking his head. “You said I could
He relayed what Granger had told him and then went to tell Greyson in private that Potter would be out of action for at least two months. The coach did not look happy.
“Okay, now picture all the things you can't do right now.”
It was weird. He never knew where he stood with fellow Slytherins. They usually could be divided into two camps: The first tried to distance themselves from former Death Eaters as much as possible, for fear of being associated with them. The second group seemed to think he hadn’t changed at all and admired him for all the wrong reasons. At least she had greeted him – Draco seemed to rank above Harry, if nothing else.
As far as Draco knew, all owls were being redirected to Potter's assistant, so he was hesitant to open the window. Who
He was in the dungeons, wearing a glowing, bright green badge, and Granger was hit by his spell, causing her teeth to grow rapidly.
“Don’t these things directly influence the game?”
“Don’t fool yourselves. I don’t know what you think connects you, but it will be the exact same thing that drives you apart in the end. You are too alike. You never could stand each other for too long. I always knew you’d be each other’s undoing. And I’ll be watching.”
When they came back, Potter looked oddly pleased and did not object to taking the Floo home.
“Draco,” said Tessa heavily. “You didn’t take
don’t you let him come back here now and then? He could tidy up, make –”
Draco wasn’t nervous about that, though. What made him nervous was the entire Gryffindor team occupying the top row of their stand. And Potter wasn’t even
Draco placed her chart and his report on the bedside table and took out his wand. “I’m going to examine you now, alright?”
“Fine,” Draco relented. Not that there was any way for him to get out of this. “But I'm bringing Aurelius.”
A groan escaped Draco. “Merlin help me. She was one of the people who saved your life last month. Have a little faith, would you?”
wouldn’t take Potter outside with them.
When he opened his eyes again, the sky was gone. He was looking up at the living room ceiling instead – not that he could see much of it, as a fuck-ton of people were crowded around his sofa and staring down at him. His head was throbbing, but at least the caffeine buzz was gone.
The sun was shining down on the suburb of Richmond. Most of his neighbours had already left for work, but Draco had a nice little chat with Mrs. Maloney, who lived a few houses down the street and was pushing her baby girl in a stroller. He invited them back to his place for a cup of tea and she accepted gladly, but as soon as they reached his front door, she suddenly remembered she still had lunch to cook and excused herself. Shame.
“And his
“Hey!” Harry yelled, obviously in a rage.
“Yes, I can see that. And you didn’t heal them, because …?”
Draco shook his head, deciding that it was safe to look at him again. “Not the book. That song you were humming.”
If Harry didn’t want to look defensive, he shouldn’t have crossed his arms at that point. “So?”

“The mediwitch from yesterday. I fire-called her to tell her you’re staying home this week. She told me what happened. It wasn’t your fault.”
Robinson and Haynes used the timeout to help Harry turn his broom over again. The wind had gotten so intense – and he was so light – that he had serious trouble getting back on top.
Draco wanted nothing more than to shove his hands under Potter’s t-shirt and touch his stupidly fit body. Sadly, he already needed his arms to prevent Potter from being crushed under the full weight of his body. He settled for fisting his hands in Potter’s soft, curly hair.
When Draco next saw Harry on a Thursday evening in December, he was asleep – which sounded like a good time, but actually wasn’t, because it took place in the library again.
Kreacher was still trying to take in the room. His eyes came to rest on an impressively large collection of cobwebs, and when he started to shuffle his feet nervously, a cloud of dust rose from the musty carpet. Draco tried not to think too much about how he had just been lying there, only a layer of clothes separating him from
and the Ministry already had a sample of him from his trial after the war. He wondered if that made him an automatic suspect.
“I know.” Harry sighed again. “Emerald told me. It’s my fault for not checking it was closed properly. I must’ve slurred the words in the hurry.”
and had actually left his own mat a few minutes ago so he could continue their hushed conversation more easily.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually fell off his broom. Five Galleons?” and
“Don’t tell me you just walked out because of me.” Harry’s voice was almost a growl and he gripped his arm even tighter.
“And nobody saw you?”
“Maybe what she

Draco couldn’t tell if people even cheered for the Cannons, because right then there was a massive crack and the sky broke open. Literally. People shrieked and shielded themselves with their banners. It was like someone was pouring out a bathtub right over the stadium. Immediately Draco was soaked to the bone.

Draco sighed and said, “I really hope they haven’t dropped him on his head. I’d like to get home sooner rather than later.”
“Seems to be pretty entertaining,” said Woods out of the blue. She gestured at his book when he didn’t answer and only stared at her, startled. “
“I – what? I’m not
Without any warning whatsoever, Potter took off his t-shirt, displaying his unfairly toned body. The tiny wings on the thread around his neck fluttered slightly and Draco felt his concentration slip considerably. A distant memory was struggling to get to the forefront of his mind, but Draco couldn’t grasp it.
What was he supposed to do? It clearly would not go away on its own – waiting had only made it
Harry opened one eye so he could squint at Draco. “So, what you’re saying is that you’ll let me buy the pasta machine?”
“Definitely after ten. Maybe a quarter past?”
“But somebody here has good news.” Luna looked surprised, like she only came to know it as she said it.

Harry Potter was a hurricane of all the things Draco knew he shouldn’t want, and wanted nonetheless, and could never have. Not even a month of being stranded in the impact zone, and Draco was already a wreck.

Harry just shook his head and said nothing for a few more minutes. When he finally turned to look at Draco, there was no life in his eyes.

“Could be worse. At least they didn’t try to
And then he had passed Harry in the hallway and not felt the urge to run the other way. Harry had been looking better – not as worn out and thin as when Draco had last seen him in passing three weeks prior.
“You have got to be kidding me,” said Harrington, who was lying on the Cannons’ Healer’s bench. “How the hell is that fair?”
Draco shook his head. Maybe he was off his game too? He blamed the overwhelming Gryffindor influence.
“I know, mate,” Ron said carefully. “But you already got him good. Practically broke all his bones and then he got impaled on some steel beams – right through the stomach. And you know how much rubble we had to dig through to find him.”
“Well, we don’t want to keep you,” Olivia said quickly.
That certainly seemed to take Harry’s mind off things. He gave him a look that Draco couldn’t read and then started to unbutton it. “So … you want me to take it off?”
“Could be,” said Harry tonelessly. “We also started having more accidents, more serious ones. I guess that’s when Matt’s temper started. Probably he’s just stressed. Can’t exactly be easy mapping out a strategy when the line-up keeps changing unexpectedly.”
Mother looked him up and down, eyes lingering on Draco’s sweater with the falcon on the front. They didn’t know about his Patronus, but they certainly knew about Harry, and the distaste on her face was palpable.
There was more than just a moment of hesitation.
“I told you not to play!” Harry protested. He was sitting on the arm rest at Draco’s feet, glaring down at him. He’d probably chosen that place just for this specific purpose.
Several seconds went by until the information had filtered through Draco’s muddy brain. He felt like he should probably read it again, just to make sure he had understood it correctly, but there was no way he could stomach it a second time.
He got up slowly and put on his pants and trousers. When he turned to face the bed, Harry was looking at him.
“She did. She left for France, switched to Trauma there. She’s been back for about a week now.” Nash paused for a second. “Wow, seems like a

Harry laughed and shook his head, dragging his messy hair through Draco’s face in the process. Draco took his face in both hands, keeping him in place.

“Oh no,
“Not really,” Draco said.
“Yeah.” Harry was silent for several seconds, and when he talked, it was obvious that he was eager to change the topic. “So
He turned around and there they were – both of them waving at him from inside Olivia’s very small, very red car. They pulled into Mrs. Capitelli’s driveway and got out.
There was an endless coming and going of Weasleys and their
They reappeared in Harry’s hallway, which was dark and quiet. As usual, Harry immediately went for the kitchen to check the post. Draco grabbed his upper arm and spun him around, pulling him in closer by the neck.
No, that wasn’t quite right. Coach Greyson wasn’t watching Draco, either, but – “Potter!” Greyson’s magnified voice carried through the whole stadium. “Would you do your damn job?!”
Potter said something to her and she hissed back. Potter grinned at him, apparently satisfied with her answer.

“Poor boy just wants to get laid,” whispered Harry.
A warm hand on his shoulder pressed Draco deeper into the chair.
Though Draco took a step forward, he still stayed out of grabbing distance. “Are you sure you can manage to take us back? If we end up integrated into the tunnel wall, I
It felt like Draco was being subjected to an obscenely strong warming charm – heat blooming inside his belly, racing across his body, setting fire to his neck, his ears, a certain area that was thankfully hidden by his flowing toga (and who cared if it even was one or not?).

“Don’t worry, there’s already somebody there to heal him,” Samantha reassured him.
Harry reduced his eyes to slits as one final glare, probably to make it clear that he wasn’t giving up, just leaving, and strode past him to the fireplace. He threw a handful of Floo powder into the fire with way too much force and roaring green flames shot up.

It wasn’t the delivery boy in front of his door. In fact, there was nobody at all. Draco looked up and down the street, but the only person he could see was Mrs. Capitelli, who was clipping her rose bushes. The Jones’ boys had probably played a prank on him again.

“Fine,” said Blaise cooly. “You all get the night to think about this. Whoever might have heard anything at all can tell me in private. I'll post the new password on the noticeboard, so check that before going to breakfast tomorrow morning. That concludes this Council meeting.”
Draco held eye contact for a second and then shrugged too. “Alright.”
Nash and Harry had a silent staring match that lasted several seconds, during which Draco phrased every possible variant of

“That’s in less than twelve hours.”
“I’ll take the red curry tofu and a Coke, please,” Harry interrupted. Then he used the menu to clock Draco on the head before handing it back to Jian.
None of the women turned around, but Draco could still see how ten pairs of eyes latched onto the two of them in the mirror immediately. Only Lauren, who stood in the first row, wasn’t watching them but everybody else instead, grinning like a human shark.
“Come on, I’ll show you the rest.”

His only option was to find a better memory, figure out who was behind it all, so he could warn Harry. Preferably before all of the memories evaded the Pensieve.
Draco snorted. “What about Abrams?”
Another shoulder bump. This was starting to border on assault. “Pretty much, yeah.”
“Don't you celebrate Christmas with your parents?” Potter fork hung in the air uselessly, half a sausage in imminent danger of dropping onto Blaise’s pristine table cloth. Blaise really should’ve known better than to have Sooky lay that out when he knew Potter was coming too.
“Er – no, right. We didn't, of course,” one of them answered while the other two exchanged nervous glances.
“Mr. Swan, your daughter is in perfect health. I looked her over and there is nothing wrong with her.” Well, at least not physically.
In the few seconds it took Draco to pass the cafe’s window front and open the door, Harry had turned around three times. He seemed nervous and twitchy, and he noticed Draco almost immediately, which resulted in a relieved expression upon his face.

Draco nodded. Yes, that actually didn’t sound half bad. “How dead would you be if it had not been for Granger?”
Harry elbowed him in the ribs. “You said you’d take me home,” he hissed.
“Somebody has to keep an eye on you,” Draco hissed as he did a quick health check spell, grimacing at the sudden flare of pain in his wrist as he performed the wand motion.

“But?”
The witch closed the file and sat back down. Several camera flashes went off at once.
They hadn’t really talked about what had happened apart from the brief summary the trio had given him the day before. They hadn’t even gotten out of bed all day. They’d just slept and cuddled and talked about trivial things with their visitors and then slept some more.
Had Draco had any breath left, he would have asked something along the lines of:
Draco tried a mild cleaning charm first, but that barely scraped off the first layer and also dusted his desk with what seemed to be rust. Not knowing what it was, Draco quickly vanished it before it could damage any of the other books (or, Merlin forbid, him
Draco helped Olivia stand up from her wheelchair and walk over to the nearest couch, where Aurelius was already waiting for her, wagging his tail excitedly.
Behind the noise were Tessa and Marc. Well, Tessa was making the noise, and Marc was hiding behind Tessa, so that counted.
“That’s the guy who broke Marc’s heart,” she said.
The Hogwarts players were just going for it, shoving and elbowing each other. Madame Hooch’s mouth must have been dry from shouting so much after only half an hour. The players didn’t even seem to register her lectures; they just kept glancing over at Harry.

It was the middle of the night and Draco was tossing and turning. He had yet to get used to sleeping in the same room as Harry fucking Potter. He kept imagining waking up in the middle of the night and seeing Potter standing over him, similar to what Blaise had undergone – even if he

Draco slipped a hand down and opened both their jeans. Getting them off would be a problem, because there wasn’t enough space between them to fit a piece of parchment and Draco wasn’t intend on changing that any time soon.
At one hundred and thirty-six, Draco dropped his hands and opened his eyes.

Should he even ask what Potter was doing? Draco didn’t know anymore. This whole thing just kept getting weirder and weirder. Was that what associating with Harry Potter was usually like?
Draco sighed and resumed sifting through his bedding. “Can’t find my tie. I swear, if Blaise took it again, I’m going to hex him.”
“Are you expecting someone?” Potter asked, glancing at the kitchen window.
“You know, rumour has it you can’t cook,” Potter said bluntly.
“Yelling?” Abby looked up sharply. “Did you get caught?”
“Why do
Draco broke off, staring at his feet. His hands were twitching nervously, so he folded them in his lap.
When they finally drew back the curtain, Pomfrey nearly had a stroke. And who could blame her?
and a wizard appeared a few feet away, holding his left arm (which was not attached to his body) in his right hand. It didn’t seem to be a serious matter, since the wizard was neither bleeding nor in obvious pain as he set off towards the entrance, looking back at them curiously every few steps.

“So you wouldn’t slip through our fingers, of course,” Potter seemed massively proud of himself. “He’s waiting to ambush you at home.”

He was scanning the list for something interesting, maybe even challenging. There was a witch whose arm had apparently been bitten off by an undisclosed pet, but just as Draco was about to touch her name with his wand, Nash’s initials blossomed beside it. Damn it!
Draco shook his head. “She’s just had a baby. I can’t ask her to do that.”
One bed over, Rose Zeller giggled and blushed, which couldn’t help with her bleeding head lac. She was looking at him, completely ignoring her own Healer. “You work for the Falcons.”

“Malfoy!” With her free hand she gestured for him to join her at the table. “Could you take a look? I want to make sure this doesn’t scar.”
Draco snorted. “So, who do you think I am?”
“Trauma,” Draco pressed out impatiently. “There was a car accident. They flew him in.”
“Harry claims it’s because of the nostalgia,” Olivia said conspiratorial. “But really it’s because –”

Draco was painfully aware that his hair was a mess, and that Harry’s looked like it had exploded. Harry also wasn’t wearing a shirt, and Draco’s scrubs were about as straight as he was. Then there were the matching necklaces. Also, they were breathing heavily and Draco just knew his face was flushed.

He really had to get a grip. This was just pathetic. He knew he was doing the right thing for both of them.
“Also isn’t beneficial to my will to live in freedom,” Blaise muttered shakily. He took a deep breath, which seemed to steady him somewhat. “Good thing there isn’t such a thing as bad press, right?”
Strictly speaking, this was a case for the Potions Ward. But since this happened on such a regular basis and the cure was fairly easy, Trauma usually just handled these cases too. Easier than listening to the Potions people bitch about the transfers.
“And how exactly will me knowing about your schedule change anything about your players’ health?”
Armstrong grinned. “What happened to you two? Did he drown you?”

Two things registered for Draco before it happened. One: It was completely dark inside. And two: it was weirdly damp and cold.
“You keep saying that like that makes it true!”
“Like trying to charm it to stay down. You’ll only offend it and make it so much worse.”
Ropes shot from his wand, binding Draco tightly. His whole body burned as the metal part was pushed further into his body, and for a second, his vision was overcome with black.

,” Draco said, casting at his own eyes. He focused on Potter's heart first and the obstructing body-parts vanished before his eyes.
Greyson seemed strained as his eyes swept the room, but then he spotted Harry half-way out of his jeans and his face lit up in apparent relief.
Draco shook his head just the tiniest bit.
Draco lost his grip and only just managed to catch his wand again before it hit the ground. He straightened up quickly and smoothed down his toga. Harry looked startled and he took a second to pick up Draco’s laurels, which had fallen off when he had bent down.
Harry swept a pile of clutter from one of the beds, sat down in the middle and shut the curtains from the inside. Draco didn’t have to be asked twice. Who cared what the rest of the dorm looked like? In the end, they were all the same. Four-poster bed, night table to the right, trunk at the foot. Most of them didn’t have Harry in them, though.
“Right.”
The air felt static. Harry shot him a questioning look and Draco nodded sharply. He was ready.
“Three jumps, no matter where you go?”
Potter opened his mouth to ask another stupid question, but Blaise cut him off. “Let it go, Harry. It's been like that for years.”
“Then what did she do?”
“That sounds like healthy coping,” Draco said, looking around to check out the Squibs (and keep himself from asking how Potter was in bed). “Which ones did you sleep with?”
back then) been at that time? He wasn’t there with them, so where did this memory come from?
Harry pushed his chair back forcefully and left through Draco’s hallway before anybody could even register he was going. Without even looking at him, he grabbed Draco by the upper arm and pulled him along.
“Nah, I saw it in a movie once,” Ella chimed in. “Exposure therapy works for some things.”

“Let’s see what we’ve got,” Draco said, putting the chart aside and getting back to his diagnosis. “The Tornados certainly got him good. The clavicle and his right wrist are broken. And ... yes, also two ribs. Also, it looks like ...” Draco cast at his own eyes to see inside the body. “Yes, the spleen is ruptured.”

Draco shrugged and forced his eyes to focus back on the pitch. There wasn’t a single player anywhere in his line of sight and he realised he’d been staring at a tiny golden dot hovering a foot above the ground.

“Well, I don’t know about edible ...” Draco answered. “Potter really isn’t the best instructor. More like the worst.
He was almost there when he suddenly noticed the sound of footfalls behind him, mostly covered by the rain. But when he looked around, nobody was there. Draco gripped his wand tightly and turned around to face the deserted street.

“It’s December,” Draco finished for her. “And he’s too cold to switch pubs every few hours.”
“A cast,” Potter said as if that were obvious.
“You’ve got a

“Do you want to hear it or not?” Blaise waited for a second and then, when Draco didn’t say anything else, continued. “So, after the war, nobody wanted anything to do with Pansy. Which is why she went to France. She used the remainder of her parents’ money to start a small business, and it was fairly successful –”
He tried his best to keep his eyes on the other applicants, and he mostly managed. But whenever Potter appeared in his field of vision, it was near-impossible not to sneak a glance at his wind-tousled hair or the tight fit of his sportswear.

There was the glare again. Did he really think that making out with a Potter-look-alike wouldn't seriously hurt Draco’s image? He could already imagine the rumours it would spawn. They'd say he was a creepy stalker. And he had been a Death Eater, of course. The public would never tolerate him lusting after Potter. They'd want his head. Pitchforks would be involved.
Her voice was steady and pleasant when she said, “

“Probably a
biographies are enough for somebody under thirty.”
“You will die now, Harry.” The Dark Lord lifted his wand placidly. He was smiling, and it was the most horrible thing Draco had ever seen.
“Not right now, Merlin’s beard. I need to brush my teeth at least three times before I can think about it. You too, by the way. You smell like Honeydukes on a very hot day.”
Draco’s voice sounded strange and broken as he yelled, “Harry, stop!” and then staggered to his feet, both hands flying up to massage his sore throat. Fuck, he was dizzy and completely disoriented. He had to face Harry, but Merlin, he couldn’t even remember to which side he’d been. Fucking Invisibility Cloak.
“No.” Harry didn’t elaborate at once, busying himself with untying Aurelius from the lamppost instead. He led the way around a corner and onto the high street. “It was because you touched me inappropriately.

“Right,” said Harry, sounding a little disappointed. But then his brows unfurled and he jumped to his feet, actually clapping his hands. “We should go down to the pitch and try it!”
“Can you believe her?” muttered Harry as they stepped onto the pitch five minutes later and the lights went on all at once.
“We had training.” Harry’s voice was oddly calm, almost impassive, as if this didn’t interest him anymore. “A Bludger hit my head. I think there was something wrong with it. It was behaving very oddly. Like the one in our second year.”

Harry exchanged a look with his friends. All of three of them seemed surprised.
Draco summoned the ring from the far corner. Then he came closer until he was standing directly before Harry, and dropped it into his bag.
The door flew open suddenly and Felicity came strutting out, grinning deviously and eyes sparkling.
Greyson nodded, crossing his arms. “I’m Coach, I decide what is best for this team. And that’s keeping him.”

Harry didn’t offer up any encouragement. “I’m going to let it out and you’ll try to keep it up, alright?”
Merlin, why did they do this to him? He had to help, he had to do something, he couldn't just sit here and wait.

“And what do

Quidditch star who’s on their way here.”
“Can I have a look?” Potter asked. “Maybe something will catch my eye.”
“Don’t be so sure.” Harry smoothed down Draco’s hair. “So, I’ve been thinking –”
If Draco was lucky, Flint had been buried with it. Not that he would put it past Blaise to come for it nonetheless.
“No kidding,” Harry breathed, fanning his face. “What did you substitute with the chilli?”
“Not really.”
“Lockhart?” Harry’s fingers were tapping against the briefcase in an impatient rhythm. “The combination,
“Try growing a beard – maybe then I’ll flirt with you.”
Harry shot him a quick look and allowed his friends to help him up. Then he leaned against the nearest wall to massage his right leg, grinning at Draco half-heartedly.
They looked at each other for a second, taking it all in. As if on cue, they both reached for each other, meeting halfway, and then the Cloak was gone completely and Draco was wrenching Harry’s t-shirt over his head.

“My things are not
Shacklebolt said something else and then took out his own wand and pointed it at Draco’s chest, which felt like it would burst open with the erratic beating of his heart. There was a flare of heat and then a slight tuck at his shirt.
The hallway was filled with down feathers, hanging in the air motionlessly, frozen in time. They were illuminated by the golden light emitting from Potter’s bedroom and the flicker of the sitting room fireplace. It felt like stepping inside a snow globe. Draco nudged one of the feathers and it drifted away from him in slow-motion.
“You will sit your arse right back down and let me examine you properly. Blaise, you can go get his stuff,” Draco commanded, pushing Blaise through the door before slamming it shut. “And you’d better knock before coming back in!”
“It was creepy,” Ella agreed. “He wouldn’t leave Olivia alone and he was rambling on about how she should take him back because he’s

“Was that the hedge as well?” Draco asked drily.
Draco grumbled and pointed his wand at the cheese. It soared over gently, closely followed by the grater, which had much more speed and whacked Draco in the forehead with its plain side before he could so much as duck. He touched his forehead gingerly and felt the already developing bump. Potter laughed loudly.
“You’re both out of breath. Sweating.
“Thank you, Potter. Care to help, Healer Malfoy?”

Draco added a
Draco shouldered his bag a little higher and kept walking across the lawn towards the castle, not once looking at Blaise. “And why the fuck would you do that?”
“It is psychological torture,” Draco countered. “You are forbidding him from properly serving his master. You are keeping him from his home, where countless of his ancestors served the Blacks before him, I’d imagine. How would

“And what did he do to give you that impression?”

of contentment. Potter had seen reason and given up –
“We should just do it today,” said Harry suddenly. He stopped walking and turned Draco around by his hand so they were standing face to face, directly underneath a street lamp.
“Let’s not go there,” he interrupted and then quickly changed the topic. “A wand can’t serve two wizards at once, can it?”

“Potter, why did a

She grabbed Draco’s arm before Slughorn even finished saying, “I haven’t had the pleasure yet,” and dragged him towards the door.
“Don’t worry, Draco,” she mumbled. “It’s going to be alright. You saved Harry and we are going to look after you.”
He couldn’t focus on that, though. Right now, they were trying to solve Harry’s problem. Who could have found out about Harry’s lack of licence? And How?

Draco’s limp hand fell away from Potter’s arm when the latter pushed himself up with a loud groan.
He was also younger than Draco had ever seen him.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and Draco wished that his brain wouldn’t supply him with the helpful information that the movement would almost certainly make his

Title: Simon Curtis - How to start a war
Harry snatched it away just as Draco managed to decipher the headline. ‘HARRY POTTER DATING MUGGLE WOMAN!’
Draco knew bloody well that he was just searching for ways to avoid looking at him. Some Gryffindor he was.
Harry opened his mouth in indignation, gasping once and then huffing out, “Nobody’s ever called
Draco laughed. “You can’t do magic. I think I can take you on.
back in August. Did you forget that?”
The smell of booze hit him as soon as the doors closed behind them. Both of the Tornados were swaying noticeably, and Draco would’ve bet his license that McCarthy was drunk too.
Potter sighed but lifted his shirt obediently. Draco suspected that maybe he did it to get him off his back and also lift his spirits a little. Truth be told, Draco didn’t really care
There was nothing interesting about a red dot, vaguely human-shaped. Not even if his posture was as good as perfect, for once in his life. Draco was

“Oh. Right. No, I won’t. I was just… you know… checking up on you.”
Sighing, Draco dropped the last note
Still, did Draco trust him to Apparate them somewhere?
too?”
Draco grabbed the door handle as they flew around a corner, and, to his horror, it yielded. Potter flung himself across the backseat again and grabbed the door, slapping Draco’s hand away in the process.
Harry gave him a fleeting look. “
He could barely face the Chocolate Frog card underneath his pillow, but in the end, he managed. (But not for much longer than an hour or two.)
Potter didn’t go. Potter turned his head and looked at Draco. His eyebrows were drawn together. The arm around Draco’s shoulders twitched repeatedly. Draco could feel Potter’s warm breath ghost over his face.
Potter mimed locking his mouth and then swallowing the key, which didn’t even make sense.
A wave of his wand created a glowing field around Harry’s body. Golden threads indicated the flow of his magic, most potent in the centre of his body. Though Draco had never seen a magic field glowing so brightly, his attention was focused on something else – there was a patch of darkness around the scar, of which the golden threads steered clear.
“They’re throwing their merch at one of the Cannons’ Beaters.”
All of them frowned at him like they were worried about his sanity. Draco struggled to sit up and Hermione helped him by charming his bed in an upright position.
“Harry, no!”
Samantha’s eyebrows vanished underneath her pink bangs as Potter snorted in an attempt not to laugh. “Didn’t you say you two were

category, having seen Potter in practically nothing else
Harry still did his three jumps when he Disapparated from unsafe locations. But honestly? Given what had happened, Draco thought that was reasonable. So much so, that he had started doing it himself.
The light was behind her, so Draco couldn’t see her face, but she definitely crossed her arms. “What the hell are you doing down there?” Then she looked up, maybe following the path of light across the room, and came to face Draco. “Oh, you’re not alone.”
“Shut up!” he bellowed, stomping his foot for good measure. “Harry is definitely

She turned around and went back into her office. Draco used the opportunity to ram his elbow into Harry’s side.
The remaining Weasley twin was made Seeker and Draco was appointed as Chaser along with another Weasley brother, who was already pulling arm braces over his hands, which had burn marks all over. Thomas was given a bat.
Maybe they
In light of recent developments, it was entirely fair for Draco to laugh at him. “You
“I was there, I didn’t stop you.”
Draco pushed up the sleeve. Almost instantly, like he suddenly remembered, Potter tried to wrench his arm away again, but Draco held his wrist in a vice-like grip. There were no fang marks on his arm, but several bruises in all stages of healing. Draco looked up at him in disbelieve.
“And he’s so aggressive too!” Draco chimed in, half annoyed and half happy that Harry was finally agreeing with him.
Harry had told him that computers could tell you practically everything, but what if that had been a lie too? Also, he would have to read up on how to operate a computer first. And then he would have to find one. Maybe he could ask Granger instead.
Since Potter at least had the common decency not to ask Draco why he was even looking for Myrtle, Draco refrained from asking Potter why he had put so much effort into doing the same thing. Some things better remained unspoken.
The only thing that happened was that he realised how often they seemed to fight. Was that healthy? And if it wasn’t, what then? They would

“Where’s my wand?”
“Why didn’t you tell me that it hurts? We can put some more arnica on these bruises.”
Jenkins didn’t answer and inspected Draco’s wand next, which showed a pair of pants disintegrating rather fabulously. Jenkins frowned and then had a look around the room. Both her male colleagues turned red.

Harry snorted. “Well, nobody called me
“Oh goodness, no. We hated each other,” Draco said matter-of-factly.
“I swear to God, Draco, if you tell him that he was asking for it because of his hairstyle, I’ll have to cut you.”
“The Golden Trio is up to something again,” said Pansy in her most gossipy voice as she sat down beside Blaise ten minutes later. “Look at them whispering their precious little secrets.”

“That would be the concussion,” Draco said to cover the awkwardness. “Let’s take her to the hospital wing. Some rest should do the trick.”
“How can you not know who David Beckham is?” Olivia said finally.
A chill travelled up Draco’s arm, and he tried desperately to shake it off before Potter could notice. What the hell was

No, that was too dangerous.
As every avid Quidditch fan knew, there were thirteen Quidditch teams competing in the British-Irish League. This meant that there were thirteen Healers, seven of which were present, as not all of them were on the same shift. Draco’s seventh espresso shot was already in front of him. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to drink it without spilling all of it.
“Am I going to see you at the Weasleys’?”
Harry nodded rapidly and made a grab for his sleeve. He froze in mid-motion, eyes widening.
“Er –” Harry said, looking at Draco helplessly and then back at Lauren. “You didn’t
He didn’t mention that he was secretly very impressed with Felicity.
She handed them the menus with a broad smile. “Time you had a proper meal, then.”
Lauren sighed deeply and shot a wistful look at the apartment door. She muttered, “Should’ve gotten Liv to do it,” and then turned back to him. She took his left hand and squeezed it. “I’m not talking about Harry. You can talk to us too, you know? About anything.”
of them are!”
birthday last month had only come off when he’d excused himself to go to the bathroom and used magic.
“It doesn’t,” Harry said. He didn’t elaborate for at least a whole minute, stroking Draco’s arm in circles and wavy patterns. Then, finally, he said, “They retroactively cancelled the whole season and it’s unclear if the new season will start as scheduled. We’ll have to see who else is involved, I guess.”
Nivaria approached. Draco froze. The hippogriff seemed to be glaring at him, and he was sure that one of her talons was twitching nervously. There simply was no way in hell that he was going to expose his neck to that thing.
Potter snorted again. “Sure, just tell her that you will teleport yourself home, I’m sure she’ll let you go then.”
“I just want to know how he managed to kick

Standard dosage …? How much was it? Draco knew this in his sleep, but he didn’t
“We don’t read that rubbish as a matter of principle,” said Draco incidentally, though he had to say that he was interested now.
When Patil came back with the papers, Granger signed them reluctantly and then helped Draco transport Potter to the next fireplace. They had decided that this would be the safest way to get Potter home, as he was definitely not fit to Apparate.
There was his voice, harsh and angry; his voice, calm and steady; his voice, singing his favourite songs, forever stuck in Draco’s head.
“Nothing,” said Nash, grinning even more. “Only Tabitha asked me several times if I knew anything about your

Harry stayed still. “Why would you want to get used to it?”
Pembroke pulled out a newspaper clipping. It was from the Prophet’s Quidditch section. The title read
“Merlin,” Draco muttered to himself. “Poor bastards. And how does Blaise fit into this? I doubt the Muggles think he produces brooms for your weird, boring sport.”
, it became glaringly obvious to him.
“Read the article,” Ron murmured glumly.
“I think I
Draco wasn’t watching the Gryffindor table at dinner. That simply wasn’t something he did. And if he
Draco nodded carefully.
He took hold of Harry’s arm, which was a very big mistake. They turned and reappeared somewhere outside. Draco only got a fleeting look at some trees and then Harry grabbed Draco’s arm, preventing him from letting go. They turned again (Draco’s stomach right along) and ended up in another dark alley. But Harry was not done yet. The third jump was even more brutal than the last and Draco fell against Harry’s hallway wall, trying to keep the popcorn where it was.
“Want me to bench you for a whole week?” Draco said threateningly, poking Harry’s bruised rib, which caused a sharp inhale.
“Tessa!”
Potter was already in their section of the library, which had been cordoned off by Pince somewhere between their second and third evening. He had pushed the sleeves of his shirt up as far as they would go and his tie was sticking out of his bag. Despite all this, his shirt was still clinging to his back, which was simply absurd in mid-September.
Draco had to scan the crowd three times before he spotted his target sitting at a small table in the far corner.
“Dream on, Malfoy.” Harry grinned. “You don’t have

“Yeah, you do.”

“Fine, you were right and I was wrong. A boomslang is the perfect pet.”
? Was Blaise
doing here?”
Draco took his sweet time with the buttons. “You are always starving, by the looks of it.”
Granger was watching him again. “So, how’s it going with the two of you?”
The Matrix was wildly different from Mean Girls and Draco understood it even less than The Incredibles. He looked over at the other Pure-bloods from time to time, to see how they were holding up. It seemed that they had received some crucial information in the years before he had joined their group, because they seemed to be following the overall narrative. Only Ron seemed just as clueless as he was. His mouth stood open in confusion and his eyes glazed over a good fifteen minutes in.
“Really?” Potter perked up at that information. “Maybe he’s doing research for whatever task Voldemort gave him.” Potter must have seen Draco flinch at the name, because he frowned up at him. “Get over it already. Alright, let’s see.”
“Leona suffered a convenient concussion just a day before the next match,” said Ron solemnly. “It’s embarrassing, but nobody ever stopped to consider that Harry wasn’t even the target. He just always
He turned around, heart racing, and saw the least likely person standing in the exact middle of his sitting room, as if she was trying not to touch anything.
Through Blaise’s eyes Draco looked around and realised he had definitely gone to last night’s underground Poly-Party. And then, without further notice, Blaise was snogging a handsome young man with short blond hair who looked exactly like at least forty of the other wizards present in that club. He was also wearing the same outfit
Draco cut his potatoes and then, for something to do, drowned them in a little more gravy than was strictly necessary. “I've got all the afternoon shifts.”
Several of the girls opened their mouths at once, when suddenly the wall slid open, revealing – absolutely no one. They all stared at it in silence for a few seconds.

The song after that started promising – upbeat and fast – but it became clear that Potter wouldn’t be joining in on it either when he abruptly wrenched his ear bud out and flung it at Draco. (It was called that, right?)
Or you could check out the

Harry was on top and there was no momentum left. He had both of Draco’s wrists pinned to the ground, one knee pressed against his chest and a victorious grin on his face. Draco struggled for a second or two and then gave up. There simply was no way he could muster enough strength to overthrow Harry, who was all muscle and determination.

“Come on, you know what I mean!”
“Okay.” Potter slapped both his hands onto his book, which released a cloud of golden glitter to which he didn’t pay any heed, and fixed Draco with an intent stare. “Did you know that physical activity improves memory and mental capacity? So Quidditch would actually

The lift arrived and they stepped inside silently, only talking again when the doors had closed behind them and they were on their way down.
“Of course they do,” Draco said. “And who can blame them, really?”
“The answer is no. I want to do this right or not at all. We can talk in two weeks
There was a sudden shift in the mood. Granger and Weasley exchanged worried looks, Ginny, Thomas and Longbottom stopped handing out their various beverages and Abbott glanced at Potter nervously, who looked like he had just been hit with a Bludger. Only Luna seemed to be completely unconcerned, which, admittedly, didn’t mean a lot.
He could barely make the man out anymore, his vision mostly black. His arm was slick with the blood that was pouring from the wound.
Somehow, they ended up squished onto a bench with three other people again, even though they weren’t as many people as the year before. The Granger-Weasleys were at home with their baby and Dean was spending Christmas with his new Muggle girlfriend.
“I’ll never understand why you don’t just call him Brad,” said Harry.
But she didn’t let go and only squinted at him some more. “I don’t like you.”
“It’s called a mixtape. Well, it’s not a

Great. Draco couldn’t
“Come on, Harry. You don’t have to play in them. So what if they’re a
“Which means it’s probably locked!”
Harry didn’t react. He was glaring at a woman who stood in front of the shelf next to theirs, shielding her child’s eyes with both hands and giving them a scandalised look.
The rest of the team was already inside, doing stretches.
“We agreed not to tell her,
“Don’t worry. Teddy is easy to please. He tends to only remember the nice things people do for him. All he’s going to remember by tomorrow is that you bought him that Chocolate Snitch with Phaedra’s card.”
Draco sighed and checked the time. Quarter to eleven already. He really should have known something was up when Blaise had rounded up the first- and second-years in their pyjamas.
“So, she hasn’t been in touch?” Olivia asked. “I tried texting her, but she must have changed her number.”
There was no humour in Harry’s burst of laughter. “Sure, I’ll just
Draco leaned over to Harry so he could whisper, “What’s happening?”
Piece of cake, right?
The new songs mentioned in this chapter are:
Harry sighed again. “The whole neighbourhood knows about the gas explosion. I

“Great. Just when Matt’s not here for once in his life.”
“There’s
Why wouldn’t Harry tell him if he wasn’t attending this ridiculous party? He was the only reason Draco was here, for fuck’s sake! And in costume, no less!
Well, if that wasn’t a brand-new sentence.
“Alright ... Hey, do you remember how we got ‘home’ yesterday?” Draco said, illustrating the quotation marks with the hand that wasn’t holding his fork.
What Draco didn’t want to do was
Robinson pretended like Draco hadn’t said anything and instead waved her hand at Harry in clear dismissal. “That’s not information, Harry. That’s trivia about his style of captainship. Which he doesn’t have. He’s not even on the first team; he won’t get to decide
“Splendid!” Draco exclaimed, “I really wouldn't want to report you and get you expelled from school. Not fun at all.”
Draco just gave Greyson a short nod and followed. Harry was waiting for him at the end of the hall where the back entrance was. He didn’t exactly look strong enough to hold on to Draco for a three-jump Apparition, so Draco took hold of his upper arm and twisted.
“You’ll never hear me admit to that!” shouted Harry from the hallway.
That mediwitch he was still looking at giggled and then turned completely red. Draco held the door open for them. Two of the witches left reluctantly, but the one cleaning Harry’s wound stayed put. Draco raised an eyebrow at her.
what I had in mind. What a coincidence! You’re a mind-reader, Draco.”
“You’re not serious.” All three of them nodded. “So, the incident with the Lightning Blast –?”
Draco tried to wrench his arm away, but Harry held on. “Ugh. Why is that wet? Is that your

Draco shrugged nonchalantly. “Last night and you don’t know him.”
“Movie night at our flat, first thing next year!” she decided, looking at Callum, who nodded.
“I’m sorry,” she muttered. “I wished people would be nicer to you.”
I should’ve invested in the keyboard manufacturing market. You guys must be getting close to wearing yours out. 😄 But honestly, I was laughing over your comments. Just so good. 👌🏻
The good thing about being at St. Mungo’s was that Draco got the good stuff. He took the offered potions and slept like a rock – one of those special river rocks, that otters liked to collect and cling to in their sleep.
She fixed him with a very stern look that reminded him oddly of McGonagall. “Cut the crap, Draco.”
pain.
“Maybe it is fair, maybe it’s not.” Draco squared his shoulders, trying for a more dignified posture. “You still shouldn’t get involved.”
He wasn’t sure if McAllister, who was scanning the menu now, was of Muggle descend or had any Muggle money. It was essential that Draco got into his good graces. Seeing how badly their meeting had started out, Draco was prepared to pull out all the stops.
Draco faltered. He definitely hadn’t thought this through. Would they believe that Draco had wanted to try and make peace with Potter? Definitely not. He also probably shouldn’t make up a lie about wanting to take revenge. Blaise would be furious with him and Pansy disappointed that he hadn’t achieved anything after two and a half months.
The waiting room was full to bursting. As soon as they entered, a myriad of ginger heads turned to face them. Granger was there too, her tan skin and bushy hair standing out noticeably. She got to her feet instantly, but seemed unable to ask what all of them were dreading. For a second, the whole waiting room was holding its breath. Meadows smiled at them mildly.
Something squirmed against his neck and Draco pulled Emerald out of his hood. Her chances were much better without him.
“Well, quite frankly, I wouldn’t know, because you keep bitching at me instead of talking about it like the fucking adult you’re supposed to be.”
weird, Malfoy. I'm pretty sure unicorns don’t go around trying to impress you.”
Draco pulled away and gripped his lower arm with his right hand, facing it away from her. And her eyebrows drew together in sorrowful confirmation.
“Because you’re sixteen and still in school, of course.”
, actually.”
“I can’t believe I actually have to spell this out for you. Draco. You
She looked up at Draco, who indicated McAllister by rolling his eyes in his direction and then shook his head slightly but firmly.
Harry returned a few seconds later and threw something at him. Draco managed to catch one of the items, but the second completely missed him and hit Lauren in the chest. Both girls shook their heads in silent criticism of Harry’s non-existing throwing skills.
The air felt hot and static all of a sudden and Draco fought hard not to take a step back and further away from Harry. Harry needed his support right now. And besides – Draco had the necklace. He was safe.
Draco snatched his jacket from Harry. He was definitely not ready to fabricate a completely Muggle-worthy childhood without supervision. Also, his love life was way too pathetic to tell anyone about. People usually thought that something was wrong with you if you told them that you only had one relationship in the last five years, which hadn’t even lasted a full two months. Or that your last casual hook-up had practically begged you to never contact them again when they finally recognised you in the morning. He hadn’t even told Blaise about that one.
Draco vowed then and there never to mention a word of this to Blaise. The last thing he wanted was to give him any more ideas for his stupid Council.
“In light of everything the Wizengamot has learned about the events that took place on the twentieth of August 2006, it could only come to the conclusion that Draco Lucius Malfoy was determined to save Mr. Potter’s life by any means possible and only directed his magic against non-magical individuals as a last resort. It is therefore the decision of the Wizengamot to drop all charges against Mr. Malfoy and order him released at once.”
Draco thought he looked pretty pathetic.
“What for?” Draco asked. “We’re invited for dinner, remember?”
What had he done to deserve this? Alright, there was no need to answer that question. Draco was just retroactively thankful that he hadn’t cared this much about Harry when there had been a madman actively trying to kill him.
“It’s nice,” said Draco, leaning forward until their noses were almost touching.

Draco laughed. “Well, I
“But you’re not drunk
“Wanker!”
“You know? A friend with benefits.”
Draco held still as Harry undressed him by hand. He was glad that he wasn’t trying to do it with a spell – he wasn’t sure if he could have stood the feeling of Harry’s raw magic crashing over him when his own was completely depleted. Draco looked over at the door as it clicked shut. The mediwitch was gone.
“You’re very fit Harry,

“I only had that stupid coin,” said Ella.

Draco started to wonder halfway through if Potter had somehow deduced that Draco had invited themselves and if this was his way of punishing him for it. Nobody could be
Then he let go immediately and went to sit on the windowsill. Something was definitely not right – Harry was avoiding looking at him.

still in a bad mood.
“That’s not your birthday,” Draco said, pushing him back down and ignoring that his heart seemed to have abandoned sinus rhythm just a second ago. “That’s
“Shots!” Harry yelled, pushing Draco towards the edge of their bench so he had to get up. “Let’s go,
or anything like that. He just needed to find something to take the edge off and make him less … susceptible.
… but maybe something … not teen-girly, if he could help it. This was his first shift since the article, after all. He was expecting at least some kind of trouble.
He felt
There was some furious whispering the second he crossed the threshold. He really wished he could hex somebody right now. Stupid Statute of Secrecy.
“I don’t want your pity snogs,” he snarled, trying again to push Potter off.

“How do you feel?”
doesn’t like me.”
He must have slowed down, because a second later he was next to Draco. “Next left, then Disapparate – my bedroom. Okay?”
“Please, be my guest,” Draco said, smirking. He pointed his wand at the floor. “
“You got off easy!” Harry laughed.
“I asked for your help buying
Draco turned to look at her. “Cortez

Nobody else had even noticed his slit-second mishap. The implications of

“That’s true.” Potter leaned his back against the wall, forcing Draco to follow if he didn’t want to be left without the Invisibility Cloak. “So, the map says to tap one of the barrels. Do you want to do it?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Sure, if you think his idea of a good time is spending three evenings a week buried in damaged and dirty books and driving me slowly mad with his fidgeting.”
was standing right next to Draco and it felt as if His sheer presence was sucking the warmth and light out of the room, as if He were a Dementor, only much, much worse. So much worse. The giant snake was there too, circling them, hissing at Harry, flicking her tongue. And Draco couldn’t look away, too terrified of what she might do if he dared let his guard down.
With both a question mark and an exclamation mark and all that.”
Also, I don't exactly speak Spanish, but I think I got the gist thanks to google translate, so feel free to leave comments in any language, really! :D
Draco scoffed. “I have a feeling that even Greyson’s new-found regard for his team’s health has its limits. Besides, what do you think he’d do if you got injured during your next match and none of his Seeker were available? If he’s finally trusting my judgement, I certainly don’t want to take advantage of it so soon.”
“– so you can snack on them later.”
that must’ve been audible throughout the whole house.
“Yeah, look who’s talking!” he said while chewing. “Literally.”
Draco grimaced and made a casual gesture with his hand to show that it was nothing. “Unhappy patient at the hospital. It’s fine.”
Ginny pointed her wand at him, but he couldn’t exactly drop the baby to defend himself. One dead family member was enough for one day.
to that.”
“I don’t care if the song is four minutes or four seconds. I don’t dance.”
Harry grabbed his hand even tighter. “Deal.”
Abercrombie just shrugged. “A curse or something. No big.” He glanced at Zeller, who was busy getting her head wound cleaned. This seemed to disappoint him greatly.
don’t?”
, right?
Valdez just gave him a strained smile and Draco left before any one of them could bring up anything else.
Harry kissed him softly, but only for a second. He draped the second scarf around Draco’s neck and said, “Unfortunately, I don’t have time.”
This was the first time either of them mentioned Olivia, and Harry was obviously eager to leave the topic behind. Draco wasn’t really keen on talking about her either. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to look him in the eyes. He was definitely dreading their joint therapy session scheduled for Thursday.
Draco only just managed to hold on to a fence post as his whole lower body went over the top and landed on the other side. Still clinging to the post, he glared at Harry, who just grinned at him.
Pansy grabbed Draco’s arm as Potter completed an insanely sharp somersault and shot up directly in front of the girls, snatching the Snitch from under their noses and avoiding collision by a hair’s breadth.
“Name your terms,” muttered Draco in defeat as Blaise finally turned around to face their table again.
Draco had thought that Vince and Greg had been his friends, once. But then the Malfoys had fallen from grace, Greg had rebelled against him and Vince had nearly
“Y’all were great!” Maggy said, patting Nivaria’s beak. “I thought we wouldn’t even get ya
When Draco peered through the space between them (taking note of their drawn wands), all he could see were scarlet robes, just like the one Ron was wearing.
He disregarded his wand, inaccessible as it was, and charged the impostor rashly, throwing off the Cloak in the process so he wouldn’t get tangled up in it. The impact knocked the breath out of both of them, and they crashed to the floor.
Draco sighed and beckoned a waiter over. He definitely needed a drink now.

He had more pressing matters – like what he was planning to do once he was inside. He probably couldn’t knock the Muggles out all at once without hurting Harry too.
“You avoided me for

thought he was having me on when he told me the two of you are friends with Potter.”
“Are we in trouble?” Blaise blurted out, like an idiot. Way to seem unsuspicious. Draco stepped on his foot to keep him from saying anything else.
“Hell yes,” said Harry before Draco could even consider it. He took the laurels from Abby, stood up on his tiptoes and placed the green wreath on Draco’s head. Then he cocked his head, squinted at Draco and adjusted his hair so that some of it was tucked to the side.
Blaise waited for both of them to grumble and lean back in their chairs before addressing Draco. “So, where were you?”
Draco was used to this behaviour on those occasions when patients made it crystal clear that they didn’t want to be treated by a
He looked out of the window while pointing his wand at the Snitch almost incidentally.
He handed Draco the tart instead and disappeared again, glancing back at them over his shoulder. Hermione looked after him as Draco studied the tart.
“Why didn’t they use this photo?” Harry asked in a horribly hollow voice, watching it for the third time. “That’s actually worse than the one they published.”
“She should be resting, getting settled,” protested Draco, though his heart wasn’t really in it. “Not working on correcting my mess.”
Draco was dead on his feet, and it was only half past eight. He felt so drained that he couldn’t even muster the energy to Apparate. He took the Floo home, which really was saying a lot about his condition.
“Squibs don’t have a signature?” Potter asked confusedly. “So, one of them could have done it and we would never know they even

“Lee!” Draco shouted, unable to form any more words.
