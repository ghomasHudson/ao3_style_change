After a night’s fitful sleep, the barely rested group of friends reemerge above ground for breakfast. Wisps of cloud are stretching over the ceiling of the Great Hall like so many persistent cobwebs and Harry can’t help but to reflect on the streaks of pale grey obstructing the blue of the summer sky as foreshadowing the autumn days to come, and soon.
”Great, really great…” he says.
Head of House
Harry realises with a pang that he doesn’t exactly know
”You…” Draco doubles over, clutching his side. ”Hang… on…”
Harry feels heavy, like someone’s poured lead into his limbs and can’t bring himself to meet his dad’s eyes when it’s time to say
”Yes, Sir.”
”I don’t feel
Draco gives an involuntary headshake, but opens the paper up nontheless. They all lean over to read, but Harry stops almost immediately. He feels rather sick.
Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Harry nods. Together they pull the hangings aside and then sit side by side on Harry’s bed, facing the other boys who are all in their own beds still, but judging by the lack of sleep in their eyes, Harry thinks they must have been up for ages, waiting for Harry to wake up. There’s a sense of austerity inside the dorm, confirmed by the serious expressions on the boys’ faces. Even Seamus lacks his usual grin.
”This is the same man who made you pretend to be a werewolf, isn’t it?” he growls.
”Harry Potter… my name is John Dawlish”, the older of the two Aurors introduces himself. ”And this is my partner, Hubert Williamson.”
”Come on, birthday boy…” the blonde leans in to murmurs against Harry’s lips and plants a brief kiss there, before slipping out of the room.
The blonde huffs dramatically, then twirls around and stalks off across the courtyard.
he tells himself. But the monster inside him has other ideas; it’s still coiling tensely in the pit of his stomach, still grinding its’ teeth, still
He’s always thought of Draco as being his best friend. But that’s not been true for quite some time either. Their friendship, which was never
”So, Harry…” Blaise says casually, smirking coolly at him. ”What was the best gift you got this year?”
He trails off, flustered and shifts his feet. He’s aware of how it sounds, there’s no way the Headmaster is going to believe him…
”There”, Remus says. ”Now we can all breathe while we get your books…”
Unfortunately, the schedule that his dads have devised with the help of Professor Snape won’t allow him to take the potion every night, so every third night he has to face his nightmares and the first time, after having had two blissfully Dreamless nights, is almost worse than ever before… he wakes up screaming in panic after only an hour’s sleep and then cries uncontrollably in Remus’ arms for a good twenty minutes, until he manages to calm down.
”T-Thank you”, Harry gasps sincerely.
”Don’t let go, now!” she cries. ”Don’t let him get you, Harry — don’t let go!”
”Ingenius, I thought! To summon your broom like that, what! And — imagine — Krum never thought of it!”
On the morning of his birthday, Harry is woken up by his dads’ off-pitch singing and grins sleepily as he sits up and rubs the sleep from his eyes before reaching for his glasses.
”Pretty boy”, Draco corrects drily, and then sniffs in his best Narcissa impression, but there’s no hiding the blush in his cheeks and for some reason it makes Harry angrier that the blonde would try to appear unbothered by it, when he
”Not him?” the girl frowns.
”No”, Remus says shortly, without looking at the Headmaster.
Harry turns away as Draco hands over the silver and scans the wall of tiny glass bottles with mild interest… Seems like a lot of silver for such a small amount of liquid, he thinks. But what does he know.
”Night daddy…”
”Mother has made up one of the guestrooms for you…” Draco says quietly. ”But it’s on the same floor as mine, so I can sneak out to see you after they’ve gone to bed… I mean… If you want”, he adds shyly, blushing a pretty pink and Harry grins. ”What?”
There is a flicker of darkness in front of Harry’s eyes, like he’s about to faint.
Ron looks genuinely surprised for a second, but he quickly recovers and starts telling Harry about a tank of brains with tentacles that attacked him. Harry frowns.
As they trundle into the Great Hall the next morning for breakfast, the Enchanted Ceiling is a gloomy grey and flickering sligthly as sparse raindrops fall from the blanket of clouds and then fade into nothingness just above their heads.
He hears the other boy rummage for his wand and efter a mutter Silencio, he feels him begin to move down his body, trailing soft kisses down his chest and belly as he goes.
Remus smiles kindly at him and strokes his hair, ”Well, we’ll never have to find out…”
This is what happens with Gryffindors — you give them your pinky and the next thing you know they’re asking for your hand in marriage! I mean, the audacity! To approach us — in the Great Hall — in front of everyone!”
” Slughorn calls, sticking his balding head through the doorway to check if the coast is clear before waddling back into the room with a beaming smile.
”I know”, he mutters. ”But we might need to start thinking about our options, anyway. I might get the sack any day now — it’s not like they’re not aware of my association with Dumbledore!”
”I’m feeling a little under the weather”, Remus says cryptically. ”I rather not risk Side-Along Apparation just at the moment. It’s okay, we can floo straight into The Leaky Cauldron.”
— a hand suddenly slaps him across the face and Harry snaps his eyes back to Moody and stares in shock at the man’s eyes…
Not that he would need any here, he thinks, turning his head to squint into the bright sunlight streaming in through the window next to the bed.
Harry winces as she dabs a purple liquid into the wound that immediately starts hissing and smoking. But then she flicks her wand over it and Harry feels it heal instantly, both the trobbing and the stinging fading away completely.
Harry nods and raises his wand, taking a deep, steeling breath.
”I remember every wand I ever sold, Mr Potter”, Mr Ollivander says and fixes Harry with another intense stare that makes Harry’s stomach clench. ”And it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather — just one other — and it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand, when its brother
”Which one?” Ginny snaps.
”I couldn’t hear, but you were muttering… It was cute…”
Harry wishes he could keep sinking into his seat, below the desk or even further than that, just sink into the floor and disappear entirely. He feels beyond chastised, mostly because Professor Snape made it seem like he’d been enjoying his special status. He does enjoy learning his special lessons, but it’s more that he’s relieved that he doesn’t have to repeat lessons than enjoying the attention of being better than everyone else.
Granger’s eyes dart all over his face and her eyebrow twitches, but Ron is luckily unaware. Harry ducks his head to hide the blush that is clearly breaking out all over his face, but not quickly enough to miss the knowing smirk Granger sends his way.
— there’s nothing to
Further dowm the Head Table, Ludo Bagman grins jovially and winks at various students, whereas Barty Crouch looks almost bored with the proceedings, Harry notices. He keeps looking off to the side as though wishing to escape, snapping back to himself when Bagman claps him on the shoulder to give the other man an unimpressed and almost tense look.
”Professor Snape said he’d talk to the Headmaster”, Draco says.
a left, and then he should be at the bottom of Slughorn’s stairs.
rather not hear about!
Harry pulls away from the older man again and follows Dumbledore towards the doorway to the Space Room. Anticipation and fear are running up and down his nerves, his toes and fingetips are tingling with it as they all count down the seconds…
”How are you guys?” he asks lightly.
”So he’s… he’s getting stronger, then?” Harry says hoarsely.
told the Hat that I didn’t want to choose, but then I also…”
”Mustard? Really?” Harry says sceptically, barely refraining from scrunching his nose up.
”Blast-Ended Skrewts!” Hagrid quickly corrects, but the reporter doesn’t seem to have heard him.
”He wasn’t dead”, Harry snaps angrily. ”But yeah, he’s returned —!”

No, Harry thinks desperately.
lodges itself in his throat and he blinks quickly, hoping to bat away the stinging sensation in his eyes…
”If you’ll remember the box of stolen items that he kept hidden in his room?”
”Why? Because she’s Granger. Put a note of it in the invite.
!” Draco says with a eye roll that speaks volumes.
”Oh it was wicked — Hey, Finnigan”, he says casually as he drops down on the ground next to their Flobberworm. ”We got to face a real life Boggart! And — this is the best part — Neville went first, right? And —” Ron snickers. ”His biggest fear is Snape…”
”Sir?”
, and so, despite feeling like his boots have suddenly filled with lead, he manages to put one foot in front of the other until he gets into Hogsmeade.
So, Harry thinks, a little selfishly. If I’m going to feel awful anyway, might as well let Draco stay and at least enjoy a bit of a cuddle.
”Right”, the younger boy mumbles.
pour instant darkness powder into the nearest cauldron. Granger’s, presumably. Or, anyone’s. Anyway.”
”Yeah, but… you hadn’t eaten”, Harry argues feebly. ”Madam Pomfrey said… vitamin deficiency…”
…” Sirius growls in warning.
”And you’re only telling me all of this, because you want to get into the Slytherin party.”
”I don’t care — it’s the new moon, I can take him!” the girl replies loudly, her eyes never wavering from Harry’s.
The next thing he’s aware of, he’s lying curled up on his side, snuggly tucked in under the covers and sunlight is streaming in through the arched windows, just visible over the top of the privacy curtain pulled around the bed.
anymore… Draco just wilfully got himself into detention and had his hand carved up for Harry,
”I guess…”
It’s not until later that night, when he’s trying and failing to sleep, that it hits Harry. She must think
As soon as the doorway is wide enough to squeeze through, he does and runs the rest of the way down the dungeon corridor to Professor Snape’s door and pummels it with his fist.
”You’re staying?”
Draco staggers back in shock as Harry nearly mauls him over in his excitement to embrace him and Harry lets out a wet chuckle, shooting him an apologetic look and reaches out for him again — less aggressively this time — but the blonde flinches back for a second time and just stares at him, wide-eyed.
I don’t know! I don’t know what happened, I just woke up here and everything is different — you guys are different! I’m sorted into Slytherin! All my friends are different! I DON’T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING!”
Harry purses his lips in annoyance, but at Snape’s sharp look he begins to speak again.
Draco nods.
”Shower”, Draco says. ”Come on, get up. I’m starving.”
”Have you had coffee yet this morning?” Draco asks, smoothly changing the subject. ”You’re very grumpy. You should go have breakfast.”
Sirius snorts harshly and storms out of the room. Harry watches his daddy’s face closely as he stares after his husband, his eyes suspisciously misty and throat working desperately for a moment before he starts to speak again.
Sirius Side-Alongs Harry to the Apparation point around the corner from the Ministr’s visitors’ entrance, concealed inside a muggle communications’ cubicle called a ’fone-box’ and once they’ve crammed themselves inside it, Sirius lifts the top off the clunky muggle contraption and then carefully turns a dial halfway round, until his finger reaches the number six. He then lets the dial roll back to the beginning with a whirring sound, before he turns it again, this time to number two.
Harry’s heart stutters in his chest. Something is nagging him at the back of his mind, just out of reach —
” Seamus exclaims happily, as they all thunder inside the Common Room. “
This room is dimly lit, but Harry can still make out the high, vaulted ceiling and the rows upon rows of high shelves, each of them crammed full of dusty glass spheres… Harry’s heart is now beating so hard, he fears it might just burst out of his ribcage…
that is amazing… if I can just tune this right…” he adds, frowning with concentration as he fiddles with the knobs on the radio.
Harry shrugs his should awkwardly.
”Okay”, Harry says breathlessly as Sirius keeps pushing him to walk faster, until finally he’s running alongside him, clutching his hand desperately so as not to lose him in the late morning crowd.
The hard look in the Weasley’s eyes melts slightly and they nod.
Harry shakes his head — Ludo Bagman
”What is it?” Remus asks, glancing at the parchment with a frown.
”That’s a phoenix”, Riddle mumbles, frowning at the bird.
— and Harry can’t help but wonder if the other boy’s dreams are somehow plagued by whatever might have happened between him and his father, like Harry’s own traumatic memories are haunting his dreams… that’s all…
”Whoa… hang on”, Seamus says, pushing back into his seat warily. ”What kind of services we talking here, cause I’m not even sure I swing that way, that one time with Blaise was just—”
”Mmm…”
”Harry?” Sirius says. ”What —?”
”No”, Harry says quickly. ”Nothing. Come in, come in. We’re not doing anything.”
”Your dad went and made a withdrawal yesterday, to save us some time”, Remus says. ”Do you have your list?”
Harry concentrates on putting one foot in front of the other until he finds himself in the middle of the Slytherin common room. Blinking, he looks around. The room is unsurprisingly deserted. He makes his way to the dormitory, but there’s no sign of Draco anywhere there either.
”Sure”, Harry mumbles, hugging himself.
Draco’s lips twitch a little, ”Harry, crying doesn’t automatically mean sad. I cry when I feel frustrated, and angry, and scared, and—”
The door to his daddy’s office is left wide open. There’s a soft light spilling out of the room, but no sounds can be heard from inside.
Huffing out a frustrated sigh, Harry closes his eyes for a second and takes a deep breath to calm himself.
okay, you’re my dad — you’re
Scanning the faces around him in a panic, Harry feels his blood run cold… The Weasleys are crowded together on the left side of his bed and on the right, next to Professor McGonagall, stands Madam Pomfrey and Hermione Granger, and they’re all exchanging looks of worry and alarm.
what my parents are like”, he says quietly. ”We can be together, but we have to be discrete…”
”Oh it is
Harry barely resists scrunching up his nose at the man’s overty cheerful tone and forces himself to focus on the cauldron closests to their table instead. What looks like plain water is simmering inside it. Leaning forward slightly, Harry gives mist of steam rising from it an experimentative sniff, but he can’t smell anything.
”Gryffindor”, Ron says heavily. ”My whole family have all been in Gryffindor. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not… I don’t suppose Ravenclaw
”At least it’s not a Howler…” Harry murmurs.
”I was thinking about that actually”, Sirius says, frowning at the others. ”Draco, do you think your parents request could have something to do with your attacks?”
Harry frowns, wondering what the whole story there is. If it was in Diagon Alley in the summer, or on the Hogwarts Express, or later at Hogwarts.
They’re sitting in the Common room later that evening when a shooting pain suddenly erupts in Harry’s scar. He gasps and clamps his hand over his forehead, focusing on his breathing until the nausea subsides and the pain gradually simmers down again, and only then does he become aware of Draco’s arm around his shoulders and everyone in the Common Room staring at him in alarm.
Finally, the blonde moves back a few paces and leans back against the opposite window frame. Harry can finally breathe properly again.
”Well then”, Seamus shrugs. ”Shower?”
”Fucking Hell”, Harry chokes out quietly. ”Maybe this
”Yeah, that’s… good…” he nods, swallowing again.
”Come on, boys”, Professor Sprout hollers from the front. ”You’re lagging behind! Longbottom’s already on his third pod — come on now!”
”I can’t believe Granger would blackmail anyone!” Daphne says. ”She’s got a lot more nerve than I’d’ve given her credit for…”
”What’s that, Ms Granger?” Moody says, reining in his grin.
”No, I can’t take this anymore! What is going on?
he thinks.
He shoots Harry a questioning look and Harry nods in agreement.
Harry swallows thickly and, not quite trusting his own voice to behave as it should, nods quickly.
” Draco exclaims and lurches forward again. ”It’s a
“Harry?” Pansy murmurs warily. “What’s wrong?”
”Y-Yeah, all right…”
, Harry thinks with a scowl.
Harry thinks as he swims closer to the choir and looks around apprehensively, searching for a familiar object but seeing nothing but more and more merpeople watching him curiously, whispering amongst themselves and pointing at his webbed hands and feet.
Something fluid and silvery grey tumbles out of the wrapping and lands in a small pile on the floor in front of Harry, it’s many folds gleaming in the light from the Christmas tree. Through the corner of his eye, Harry sees Remus sit up a little straighter in the sofa and he can hear Sirius gasp softly.
Seamus lets out a derisive snort, but just shakes his head when Harry shoots him a sharp look.
They continue to make their way through the pile of presents until Remus and Sirius have opened all of theirs and Harry only has two more left, one with Remus’s handwriting on the label and the mysterious one without a label at all. Harry gives Sirius a questioning look as he picks it up, after having unwrapped the copy of
McGonagall gives him an unimpressed look, ”Well, you can’t. Professor Dumbledore left for London ten minutes ago.”
”Oh — right”, Harry mutters. ”Well, I don’t mind if you have a seat… Hey, do your family know you’re here?”
”Then maybe something will happen”, Blaise consents. ”If enough parents get together and protest, that will put some pressure on the Ministry… or if the
On the other side of the wrought iron gate, just below one of the winged boars, with his long black robes rippling in the breeze, stands Harry’s Head of House, Professor Snape. His sallow face, framed by greasy hair that hangs like a couple of heavy, black curtains, is contorted in a deep scowl as he glares back at Sirius.
”And?” Draco says breathlessly, his voice aquiver with hope that makes Harry want to smash something to pieces.
perks…” he says with a wry smile, then wraps his robes and arms around Harry’s smaller body and hugs him close, rubbing his back.
”I kind o’ don’t want her to get sacked”, Seamus says. ”At least not yet — not before we can carry out our prank!”
Feeling his cheeks flare up with a hot flush, Harry swallows thickly and looks around to see everyone else getting set up. He stares at the empty cauldron in front of him desperately and tries to will his body into action.
”Draco…” Harry says carefully. ”Sorry, I’ll let you sleep, but… are we okay?”
the way Harry means it. But since the professor didn’t question
With a horrible sinking feeling, Harry peers over at the statue on the bed — except it’s not a statue at all, he realises — it’s the gryffindor Colin Creevy.
He lets it spring back into a roll and tosses it onto the table, then gives it a petty nudge when it doesn’t roll far enough away from him. He’s aware of his friends watching him curiously, but avoids their eyes.
! They
”B-b-but Severus, I —”
They make it out of the dungeons and outside the castle in record time, then wait restlessly in line to have their names ticked off by Filch at the gates before they can finally start the trek down the winding path into town.
”Hey, you’re getting taught by someone you beat in the Triwizard Tournament”, Seamus comments quietly, while they wait for their names to be called.
”What did Pansy say?” Harry asks, aiming for casual.
The third time he startles awake, shivering with cold seat and choking on his own laboured breathing, Harry decides to get up. So he peels his soaked pyjamas off and changes into a pair of slacks and a tee, then follows the soothing sound of his dads murmured voices out into the kitchen.
” Remus says, his voice growing a little harder with suppressed anger.
Draco doesn’t say anything and he doesn’t laugh either, which makes Harry feel even worse. But they both try their hardest to pretend everything’s fine and by the time they’ve finished their breakfast and are strolling towards the greenhouses for double Herbology with the Ravenclaws, Harry’s almost convinced himself everything actually
Next morning, Draco accompanies Harry to the owlery so that he can send his letter to his dads off before they head to the Great Hall for breakfast. He’d debated with himself for hours the night before, while he lay curled up next to Draco, unable to fall asleep, whether it was really a good idea to tell his dads about Mr Crouch, knowing how much they’ll worry… but finally, he’d decided that if they were to hear about it from someone else and he hasn’t told them, it will be a lot worse.
”There’s nothin’ in tha’ forest that’ll hurt ye as long as ye keep on the path, and you’ve got me or Fang with ye… Now, I reckon we should split up —”
”I’ve missed you too”, Harry says and tightens his arms around the man’s neck.
over the first one and
”Yeah — no — I don’t feel too great”, Harry mumbles, clutching his head with one hand and squeezing his eyes shut.
”Okay…” He says in a small voice. ”I love you…”
”Professor Snape told me everything
”No, no…” Parkinson says, studying her nails idly. ”Remember back at Half Term when they’d
”Thank you”, Krum says. ”I vas vatching you fly at the first task, you are also very good…”
He makes a beeline for a chintz armchair and sinks into the seat, letting Professor Trelawny’s misty voice wash over him… as long as he doesn’t actually fall asleep, Harry doesn’t really have to pay attention in Divination anymore. He can just let his mind wander freely and still get top marks, since Trelawny has begun to view the faraway look in his eyes as a sign that he’s contemplating his own dark destiny and coming to terms with it… Draco keeps shooting him unimpressed looks, but Harry doesn’t care.
”I dunno…” Draco mutters again, forcing his head up and blinking some focus back into his eyes. ”It probably means nothing, that you’re here, but… I dunno, I feel like… As long as I know
The centaur lowers himself on his front legs so that Harry can clamber on top of him, then starts galloping through the forest so quickly that Harry has to hug him tightly so as not to fall off.
He points Harry sternly towards the spiral staircase behind them and Harry nods, dragging his feet towards it, thinking he’ll meet up with Draco in the Common Room instead. When he gets there, he’s the only one there but he is soon joined by the rest of his house, including his boyfriend and all their friends, everyone talking excitedly about the scene they’d all witnessed in the Entrance Hall.
His musings are interrupted by the low creak of the doors opening again and he tilts his head back down to see the stern-faced Professor McGonagall come striding inside the Hall, herding the small group of first-years like a mother duck might lead a line of ducklings. The thought makes Harry smile.
”Sorry, but not even a bet will get me across that threshold again”, Draco says shaking his head. ”I went with Pansy once. The woman was insufferable. Kept coming over and making cooing noises… I’ve never been so embarassed in my life.”
me — as though he could, when I have
”Yes, mother”, Draco sighs.
Harry’s dads has made their way down from the Slytherin stands and jog up to him and his teammates. Remus eyes flit over his body quickly, clearly taking inventory of any injuries.
”So has he stopped calling you ’Weatherby’ yet?” he asks lightly.
Remus swiftly shakes his head and looks away.
”Where is the wardrobe? Harry, you promised—” Pansy says, twirling around anxiously.
, he thinks surlishly and looks around for something else…
”You don’t have to explain”, Draco says quickly and looks away. ”It’s a holiday and you want to spend it with your family, that’s… That’s absolutely fine… I understand—”
The bludger keeps whizzing after him and soon, he’s got Bole and Derrick on either side of him, swinging their clubs madly at the persistent bludger, and nearly whacking Harry himself at one point, and between the rain splattered on his spectacles and his teammates flailing arms, it’s impossible for Harry to see anything else.
Harry frowns, then looks around. He meets the shocked eyes of his friends who have all realised the same thing.
The blonde ignores him and keeps staring at Umbridge, his eyes glinting with some barely repressed emotion and chest heaving with quick, shallow breaths.
Harry’s heart lurches. He glances over at Blaise and the other boy gives him a quick nod. Together they bend down and grab each of the boys by the arms and drag them bodily apart, literally kicking and screaming, especially Draco, as Ron grabs him by the hair once more, before Blaise manages to pull him away.
”Oh, okay”, Harry says, mouth suddenly dry.
He thinks about Ron and the twins, who are all in Gryffindor… Well, Ron has yet to be sorted, but Harry is sure he’ll end up in Gryffindor with his brothers, and Harry is sure he’ll make friends with them all if he ends up in Gryffindor with them… Friends, he thinks longingly…
After a short but passionate discussion, the family decides on the name Selina for the cat and after much begging and imploring puppy dog eyes from Harry, Selina is allowed to sleep in Harry’s bed with him. Remus tucks Harry in and then carefully moves Selina out of the way so that he can sit down in the side of the bed. He smiles down at Harry and gently strokes his head.
” Lupin exclaims.
I’m coming!” he hollers, then grumbles to himself for a good five minutes, before he realises he’s still sitting on his bed, so technically his dad has a point.
”Draco.
Harry realises then.
”Did it say who’s giving the lessons?” Harry asks.
Harry quickly ducks his head out again and tries to slide the door shut as quietly as possible, but before he’s managed to, Snape looks up and bellows, ”POTTER!”
When he gets towards the end of the street, the two rows of buildings on either side stop but the street itself continues winding up a small hill and the top of it, sits a stone house. Harry smiles a little to himself. He can see now why the address didn’t need a house number. It’s the only house here.
”Oh-oh, it’s finally happened”, Sirius says. ”He’s ashamed of us!”
Harry hears echoing footsteps approaching suddenly and looks up in time to see a man dressed in all black robes round the corner. At the sight of Harry he stops dead and for a second that spans at least an hour, Harry’s heart seems to have stopped as well.
”Calm down!” Draco says again, even shriller.
”Thanks very much”, Remus adds quickly. ”Could you leave it here on the desk for me, please?”
”I said I’ll get someone to help me”, the blonde says swiftly. ”And I will.”
”Great capture, Potter”, Flint says. ”Really spectacular!”
”Professor Flitwick”, Remus clarifies. ”He’s on patrol duty tonight.”
A subtle tint of pink creeps into Draco’s cheeks and he ducks his head a little, but smiles happily.
”Define… Sex…” he says hoarsely.
… With a soft sigh, he gently eases the door shut behind him and makes his way back to the Slytherin common room and even though sleep is the last thing on his mind, he goes to bed early like he’d told Draco he would.
”If you mean Professor Lupin, he’s the best teacher we’ve ever had”, Pansy says loudly and Harry feels a surge of gratitude to the girl, but it’s not nearly enough to put out the bonfire of
”Will do, Harry—!”
Draco frowns slightly, but doesn’t question the explanation and by the time they’re making their way to Transfiguration he seems to have forgotten all about it.
He turns to Draco to comment, but his voice gets stuck in his throat at the thoughtful expression on the blonde’s face. Sensing Harry’s attention, he tears his eyes away from the notice again and returns his stare.
”That’s okay”, Harry says sardonically and gives him a pinched smile. ”I don’t really want to speculate about it, anyway.”
”You’re already exhausted”, Harry mumbles. ”You… you know you’ll make the team if you try out, so you really shouldn’t unless you really want to be on it. I won’t be mad if you decide to drop quidditch. I’m sorry I’ve been sulking. Of course you should focus on school—”
he’s dads have given him, but Sirius shakes his head.
”Y-yeah, one sec!” Harry calls back and scrambles to hide the two books and the bottle of lube under the the pile of wrapping paper.
”What, what?” Harry gasps in panic, trying to crane his neck to catch a glimpse of Draco’s face. ”Draco, what? What’s wrong? Did I hurt you?”
”, Draco spits the words out.
Snape raises an eyebrow, but doesn’t comment. Instead he starts striding towards the doors, his black robes billowing behind him.
”Yeah, he wanted to know what’s been going on with you, Harry…” Granger says and shrugs. ”I told him, ’you should ask Harry about Harry’ — I wouldn’t hold my breath though, because he looked mortified when I suggested it…”
Snape clamps his hand down on Harry’s shoulder and steers him into the classroom, then more or less presses him into the nearest seat and stomps over to his desk, pulling at the drawers until he finds a small phial that he places in front of Harry without another word, then turns to the rest of the class and starts barking out orders for today’s lesson.
And he also remembers talking to Draco and Ron a little while later, the two of them telling him his daddy had been livid when he’d stormed into the Hospital Wing.
Harry nods.
He lowers himself down to bring their bodies together again cautiously, vaguely aware of his own weight and trying to angle his body slightly to the side and leaning most of it on his own arm propped up next to the blonde’s head, but just as he’s managed to find his balance, a pair of delicate (and surprisingly strong) hands slither down his back and pushes his hips down. He feels an unmistakable hardness press against his own and gasps at the sensation.
”Barty Crouch?” Madam Bones interjects.
Sirius puts the top of the muggle contraption back and then helps Harry pin the badge to the front of his robes, as the woman’s voice continues to speak slowly and tonelessly.
Sirius studies him silently, critically. Finally he lets out a sceptical noise, eyes narrowed in thought and tells him to focus on the feeling first.
Lockhart claps his hands twice and a sidedoor opens next to the Head Table, through which a dozen dwarves walk in, all of them wearing golden wings and carrying little harps… Harry gapes.
”But —”
Malfoy shakes his head furiously, still laughing helplessly and waves a hand towards Harry’s face, shushing him.
It turns out that the blonde had been right. Harry is the only Slytherin back early from the holidays and it’s the strangest feeling to have the entire Slytherin Common Room to himself. He curls up in an armchair in front of the big fireplace and stares mesmerized as the flames lick the inner wall. He is just about to get up and go to bed, when the door to the Common Room slides open and Professor Snape strides in with his robes billowing around him. Harry startles and sits up straighter.
”But you know”, Harry insists. ”
A soft gasp escapes Remus as the silvery ferret tumbles through the air and scurries around the legs of the chair behind him curiously. He wheels back around to stare at Harry in astonishment and after watching the ferret evaporating into thin air, Harry meets his eyes grimly.
”Ow! What—?” Harry jerks upright and sends the other boy a glare, but quickly schools his face into what he hopes looks like a relaxed one as he becomes aware of Trelawny towering over him.
Harry skims the article until the words
As if she’s heard him, a soft, misty voice suddenly slithers out of the gloom towards them, ”Welcome… How nice to see you in the physical world at last…”
”I’ll put the coffee on…” Remus says behing them.
”I’m afraid I can’t promise that”, Remus says with a kind smile. ”But we’ll see…”
Harry isn’t sure why, but he gets the feeling that the professor is being defensive.
he thinks.
”I haven’t”, Harry says quickly. ”I don’t care about winning, honestly!”
of metal against stone, as Arthur Weasley throws himself at Lucius, knocking Ginny’s cauldron out of her hands and sending it crashing to the floor in the process. Lucius is knocked backwards into a bookshelf and dozens of books thunders down on all of their heads.
”Anything at all”, Dumbledore adds with a twinkle.
you, Potter —”
The look Draco gives him would suggest he’s not inclined to believe that, but he joins Harry under the cloak anyway and wordlessly grabs his hand. Harry smiles at him and gives his hand a gentle squeeze.
In one swift movement he swings the dagger through the air and chops off his hand at the wrist. A piercing scream is ripped from him and the dagger falls from his hand as he grabs his bleeding stump and hugs it to his chest. His whole body convulses and he seems to focus all of his remaining energy to stay standing. Then with a shuddering breath, he bends to pick the dagger up from the ground again.
On a silent cue, all the wedding guests push to their feet and start milling around, taking turns to congratulate the newlyweds while they wait for the chairs to be magicked away and replaced by a dance floor surrounded by little round tables. A handful of waiters appear carrying trays of food and drink, just as the band begins to play a merry waltz.
, Harry muses later as he lies curled around the other boy’s body and catching his breath.
Finally the bell rings and Harry gratefully shoots to his feet, grabbing his books and fleeing the classroom without a backwards glance.
”Right”, Harry mumbles. ”So do you want to play, then?”
memory! Why would it
Hagrid grabs his crossbow again and flings the door open again.
”Thank you”, Remus says.
”But… but… I don’t understand… That’s a
”I know, cub…” Remus says soothingly. ”We heard.”
Finally the pain begins to subside slightly. His head is still pounding and his scar stings, but it’s not so bad that he can’t think… Sitting up cautiously, Harry blinks his eyes open. A sudden weight slams into his chest as Krum’s lifeless body on the ground next to him registers and he stares at it in mute horror…
Harry feels his stomach drop, as he suddenly realises that his dad must know exactly what this feels like for Draco.
”Harry,
”It wouldn’t be the first time”, Harry says.
”There’s this party…” Harry trails, feeling his cheeks burn as the look on the other boy’s face morphs into scandalised shock. ”Yeah, okay, that was probably a bad idea…”
Remus’ eyes are flashing dangerously and they zero in on Professor Dumbledore at once.
But first, he has to venture out into the rain for Care of Magical Creatures… the only silver-lining being that at least the oaf Hagrid isn’t taking the lesson and putting them all in danger, rather when they reach the paddock next to Hagrid’s old hut, Professor Grubbly-Plank is waiting for them next to a trestle table with what at first glance looks like a small pile of sticks, but at a closer look turns out to be —
Harry thinks, trying to remember if he’s ever seen the girl laugh before.
He shuffles further in, to give his dads room and immediately feels his knee knock into something solid next to the door.
”Well, if you didn’t kill that girl all those years ago —?”
”How did you sleep?” Harry asks again.
, this one actually helps to ease the tension between them somewhat. By the time they reach the Hospital Wing, their seething anger has simmered down to a stubborn sulk.
”I — I see — myself and my — my dads — and Draco —”
The waning gibbous moon can be seen just over the tops of the trees and in its pale light, Harry suddenly sees a large silhouette moving steadily towards them.
but is surprised to find a different Quidditch publication called
”Where am relocating to?” he asks. ”Here?”
Harry almost drops the book again.
”Mr Potter”, Umbridge says, all traces of sweetness gone from her voice. ”As High Inquisitor I have the right to supervise any and all official meetings between the teachers and the students of this school—”
”He can’t be serious”, Harry says flatly.
”I didn’t know… My dads, they never said anything about… About anything like that — I had
He thunders into the lounge, barely noticing the frowns on his dads faces or his dad dabbing at a growing wine stain on his shirt front and Remus taking the dripping wine glass from him and placing it on top of the coffee table.
”I’m not leaving him. Not until he’s awake. I don’t want him to wake up and I’m not here.”
Somewhere in the near distance, Harry can hear the
”Who are these from then?” Sirius asks with slightly more enthusiasm than the situation requires, obviously trying to distract Harry while Remus gets a hold of Draco’s parents.
Ron looks extremely uncomfortable suddenly and the awkward silence stretches out between them again.
Harry follows the sound and walks over, holding his wand aloft. In moments, the shimmering outline of a ghost appears in the darkness in front of him. It’s the ghost of a man, and a very portly man at that, Harry thinks.
”No…” Harry groans quietly.
”No”, Draco says.
He leans back and holds out his arm. Harry scrambles to his feet and hurries around the table to eagerly snuggle into his daddy’s waiting embrace.
”Wh-what?” Harry croaks, feeling slightly winded.
Draco makes a gagging noise and Harry chuckles. Behind them, Pansy Parkinson lets out a high-pitched giggle as well and Harry immediately feels his hackles go up, but he quickly smoothes the scowl from his face when he sees Draco’s proud smirk.
”, Riddle hisses.
Harry frowns. It’s not that he doesn’t understand, because he does. But he just doesn’t like the idea that his dads’ are keeping secrets from him. He’s not a little child anymore; he’s eleven; he goes to Hogwarts now!
”— when you call her Nymphadora!” Harry says, grinning. ”I
”Yes, I want to—”
look funny. But knowing that Umbridge is treating Hagrid like this because of her own predjudice towards so-called half-humans helps him keep a straight face. After all, it certainly wouldn’t be funny if she were to talk to his daddy like this.
Harry thinks,
He doesn’t seem to really expect an answer though, because when Harry shrugs he’s already looking away with an absent-minded nod.
to the
”Shut up…” Harry mutters, blushing slightly as he throws an apologetic look at the affronted French students.
”What? What?” a haggard-looking Remus hollers as he hurtles inside the lounge, his sleep-swollen eyes flicking wildly around the room before they land on Sirius and Harry kneeling together in the middle of the floor. ”Harry!”
Sirius laughs and ruffles his hair fondly, ”Yeah, you’re right. We’ll find a way…”
Draco doesn’t return from the Hospital Wing for several days and Harry’s worry is slowly eating away at him, so when the blonde suddenly struts into the Potions Classroom halfway through Double Potions with the Gryffindors on Friday morning, his arm in a sling but otherwise in perfect health and smirking, Harry almost forgets they’re supposed to be on bad terms and perks up. At the sound of Pansy’s squeal however, he perks right back down then…
”Mister Malfoy, is this true?”
As if reading his mind, Madam Pomfrey asks him if he wants to stay the night in the Hospital Wing. But Harry quickly shakes his head. He wants to go back to his dorm, so he can see Draco… Even though the other boy will probably be sleeping already when Harry gets there, he just needs to be close to him… Needs to have that reminder that they both made it out of the Chamber in one piece…
”Right”, Professor McGonagall says, all business-like and starts herding everyone else out of her office.
Feeling the familiar prickling sensation of being stared at, Harry glances up and catches Umbridge staring at him with a gloating smile stretching her podgy face. Harry grits his teeth and returns his focus back to the book with determination.
in the morning, will be serving detention every night for a week!”
and slumps down in his seat sullenly.
”You did…”
Just as Snape predicted, every slytherin who had attended the duelling club — and a few who hadn’t — are sitting around in the common room when Harry enters. They all start chattering excitedly when they see him, asking a hundred questions at once.
”Yep, it’s part of the birthday ritual”, Sirius says. ”Open your presents already, I want to see what you’ve got!”
”Can ve talk? In private?”
That evening, as Harry is helping Lupin clear the table after dinner, there’s an unexpected knock on the front door. Harry looks up to see the two older men share an urgent look. Then Sirius immediately strides out into the hallway.
”Why, what did he want?” he demands.
Harry swallows thickly, feeling his stomach coil with dread. He’s not sure he’s up for another round so soon. All in all, the experience was wholly unpleasant, regardless of bumped knees… a headache is already building behind his eyes. But he nods and raises his wand once more, letting his eyes flutter closed.
He kicks off his left shoe and peels his sock off, then puts the diary inside it.
”No.”
Draco purses his lips and glares back at him.
”I’m going to go get ready for bed…” Harry mumbles.
”What was it?” Harry asks Draco again as they’re getting ready for bed later that evening. ”Come on, you can tell me!”
”You’re welcome… I’m sorry, I’m so used to Harry’s monstrous appetite”, he adds. ”You don’t have to finish the whole slice, if you’re full…”
”He’s
Several ideas fly through Harry’s mind, each filthier than the next and he nods eagerly. He feels the lips pressed against his own twitch into a smirk and then disappear completely as the other boy shimmies down the length of his body, pulling down his pyjama bottoms and pants as he goes. Draco settles between his legs and Harry instinctively spreads them a little wider to give him room. When Draco begins to trail kisses and little licks down the thickening length of Harry’s prick, he has to remind himself to breathe and he he presses his eyes shut, focusing on nothing but his own breathing and the sensations that spark up inside him.
When some of the Slytherins spot Harry and Draco in the doorway, they forget about the drunk Irish boy and swarm around them with renewed cheers.
”Pass me a dry one, Sirius”, he says quietly.
Sirius blinks, the traces of his beaming grin still clearly visible around the edges of his face as he turns back to Harry.
Draco knocks his shoulder against his, and Harry glances over at him. The blonde smiles thinly.
— you’ll all get expelled — and my father will have your parents fired—!”
Nodding curtly, Snape strides out of the room. As soon as he’s gone, it’s as if Harry isn’t even in the chamber anymore. Dumbledore asks McGonagall to walk Diggory to his Common Room and then turns to Madame Maxime and Karkaroff and politely asks for their patience while they try and sort everything out.
Feeling slightly reassures by this reaction — after all, if what’s inside seemed at all dangerous, surely the girl’s reaction would have been a terrified scream rather than the noise you make when you step in something nasty — Harry starts approaching the crates as well and leaning forward, he peers inside the nearest one.
”Of course you do, you’re not the one with a bite mark on his chest—!”
”No, Sir.”
”And… and you can do that?” Harry asks, gazing at the other man in wonder. ”You can read minds?”
Once again the house-elf makes a choking sound, but Harry firmly holds onto his when he tries to grab the lamp off of Harry’s nightstand,
Harry startles, staring at the old Headmaster in shock. As if to illustrate, his scar gives the tiniest of twinges.
”I know”, Harry says. ”It’s all right. It’s all over now.”
”It may have escaped your notice, Seamus”, Draco says icily. ”But outside these walls, there’s a bloody war on and
Sirius quickly sidles up to them and steals a hug as well, then quickly backs away with a wary look in Madam Pomfrey’s direction.
as they say — very good, quite right.”
An insistent bug keeps flitting around Harry’s head and he swats it away and accidentally catches Granger’s eye briefly over the blonde’s shoulder — the girl stands with one foot in the doorway to the third train carriage, ready to board, but she’s stopped dead and is staring at Harry with slightly unfocused eyes — he frowns uncomfortable and looks away again, focusing on Draco.
”Professor…” Harry says, feeling sightly breathless with excitement. ”Do you know any simple summoning spells?”
”Good news?”
He sighs and tilts his head back, staring up at the blanket of grey clouds and breathing in chilly autumn air, feeling it cling to his face like dew on his skin. Taking a deep breath, he tilts his head down again — catching sight of Ron walking up towards the castle from the greenhouses, accompanied by Granger and a Hufflepuff boy whose name Harry doesn’t remember — the redhead’s eyes meet his suddenly and when he lights up, Harry feels slightly better again. He smiles back and lifts his hand in greeting.
”Yeah, I’ll get it for you before you leave… But I think ten galleons should be more than enough.”
Professor Trelawney begins to rock back and forth where she’s sitting on her trunk, hugging herself and crying uncontrollably.
Looking at his watch, Harry realises he really will be late for Transfiguration despite the free period and swears loudly. He grabs his book bag and starts running down the stairs from the owlery, taking the steps two at a time and almost slipping on an icy patch.
Some of the Snitches in his stomach drop heavily when he spots an unexpected flash of pain in the other boy’s eyes.
… just… come here…” he sighs and stretches his legs out again before reaching for the other boy.
”Why do they even bother staying together”, Harry says, shaking his head.
The owl hoots in reproach.
bullied
Harry thinks numbly.
”Oh. Don’t worry about it, I wanted to work it out on my own anyway, so…”
”So, you think this is it?” she asks Harry, eyes glittering with excitement.
”S-sir—”
”Fine by me”, Harry mutters, struggling to stand on his shaky legs.
”But—”
was in fact his friend Theo’s father, but he doesn’t tell Theo that. Instead, he tells him that Rita Skeeter had said that if she was going to write up the interview then it would have to be there and then (which is true) and so Harry had had no way of checking with Theo (which is, kind of, true) and the only reason he could check with Draco was because he was there with him.
”Sorry, Hedwig”, Harry mumbles, twisting his feet further apart to make more room so he can fit the trunk into his lap.
”Of course you can, Harry…”
”Why?” Draco mumbles, jotting down another note on the parchment next to him.
”It would be a shame to just get rid of them though”, Pansy says. ”Some of them might be positive. You never know.”
”Yes, Sir…” Harry mumbles, holding his hand out. ”Thank you for coming—”
”So, then, why does Dumbledore think it’s so important that I learn this?” Harry asks, dreading the answer even before the words are out of his mouth. ”Sir?”
Then it strikes him.
The familiar scent that is just
The others’ eyes are round as saucers by the time he’s finished talking. He huffs out a small chuckle and rubs the back of his neck.
He feels feathery soft kisses flutter up his abdomen and sternum, like a little butterfly making its way up his body. Blinking his eyes open, Harry catches it between his nipple and his collarbone — or rather, he grabs Draco’s head and brings it forcefully up to meet his own — capturing the other boy’s mouth in a bruising kiss.
”Yes”, Lucius gasps. ”Yes, my Lord—”
Firenze bows politely at Hagrid then turns around and gallops into the darkness of the forest again.
they are. They haven’t talked about their relationship at all, and apart from a quick peck when they saw each other again on the Hogwarts Express heading back to school after the Christmas holidays, they haven’t repeated that kiss either… That doesn’t mean Harry hasn’t been thinking about it though.
”Do you want to talk about it?”
”Well, you
Harry imagines the taste of blood in his own mouth and swallows several times.
Just a heads up, everyone: I'm in Sweden for the month of August and super busy (I have a writing deadline plus working as an actress on a week long writing lab) which means this might be the last update in a while. (But maybe not!)
Harry hesitates, then shakes his head. But at the look of hurt that flashes in his dad’s face, he sighs and says, ”It’s about sex, all right?”
”Yes”, Dumbledore agrees humbly. ”It’s been a week, but I don’t see any cause for alarm. We don’t know for certain where Harry has ended up, but I would say it’s almost entirely likely that he has ended up in a parallel dimension also, maybe even the one that, this mister Potter here, is from… So we know that he’s safe—”
”… No”, Snape murmurs. ”I lifted the spell.”
Harry lets out a huff of frustration.
”Well, I tried to stop him”, Draco says. ”But he’s the most stubborn person on the planet.”
He’s helped to his feet and escorted out of the Great Hall by a well-meaning Professor Tofty who insists on escorting him to the Hospital Wing.
When it’s time to go to Hogsmeade, Harry is one of the first students to queue up in front of Filch, more or less bouncing on his feet in excitement, much to Seamus and Blaise’s amusement. The three of them make the trek together, stopping by Honeydukes and Zonko’s before Harry waves goodbye to them outside the Three Broomsticks and makes his way to the other side of the small town.
and Professor Snape earlier when he walked him to the tent —
But again, nothing. Just the rundown old pub and the massive oak tree…
”Sir, I just wanted to talk to—”
On the other end of the chamber is a wooden door, the only door in the whole chamber and obviously the way forward.
”He’ll be here in about two hours. You might want to clean your room a bit before he gets here…”
rather I take to the Ball then—?”
… He watches the dusty sunlights splay across the blonde’s hair, making it glow…
”Er… no?”
He tries to twist his arm and look at the place where Womtail dug the dagger into his flesh, and promptly stumbles over his feet. He would have fallen flat on his face, but Moody keeps him upright.
”Thank you, Seamus, the situation needed someone to point out the obvious and make it even more awkward”, Harry mutters back in a dead pan that earns him a few snickers from the others and Seamus simply shrugs with a grin as if to say
”Longbottom, what is this supposed to be?” Professor Snape says sharply.
he thinks.
deny it. Problem solved — except there isn’t even a problem
”Yeah, well…” Harry says, feeling exhausted all of a sudden. ”I think we all want that. But I doubt it will happen.”
”What?” Cowe pipes up at the other end of the table. ”What’s going on? Potter?”
In the next moment, Sirius waltzes into the kitchen. His wide grin falls as soon as he catches sight of Professor Snape and instead he scowls darkly.
”What other story?”
”Harry, Harry, Harry”, he says, shaking his head. ”Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I? Gave you the
”No, I’m not”, Harry agrees and lets his smile stretch out completely.
maybe —”
The other boy merely shrugs with a grin and then immediately starts tucking into the food that suddenly materialises on the plates in front of them. Harry gasps and stares down at the many dishes crammed together on the table and immediately starts filling his own plate with roast potatoes, chicken, chips and Yorkshire pudding, then finally scoops some peas and carrots onto the edge of the plate when he realises what Remus would say if he was here.
”What do
”Students will raise their hands, if they wish to speak, in my class!”

They walk in tense silence, but Remus’s arm never leaves Harry’s shoulders and although it felt slightly awkward at first, Harry is starting to take some comfort from the contact…
”Mister Potter, do hurry up…” Snape says silkily. ”We don’t want to take up any more of your classmates’ time than is absolutely necessary, do we?”
from my
”The Ministry…” he says. ”They won’t make me move, will they?”
Harry attempts to shoot the Irish boy a glare, but he’s not sure if he’s succeeded.
Harry lets his hand slip away from under Draco’s and steps back, allowing the blonde to take over.
His daddy bends down to brush a feathery kiss over the scar on his forehead. It’s not until the pain suddenly stops, that Harry realises his scar has been hurting this whole time…
was Harry’s idea, as well”, Remus tells Sirius in an under-tone and gets a quick kiss in response.
” Harry adds passionately, pointing a determined finger at Seamus’ face and recieving nothing but a couple of owlish blinks in response. ”If he thinks he can just waltz in and usurp me from my own life,
Hurry up, please!”
”Tom…” Remus greets and raises a hand in greeting. ”We’re just passing through, I’m afraid.”
”Well, thanks to Ginny actually… Little Ginny has been writing in my diary for months and months, telling me all of her pitiful worries and woes, how her brothers would tease her, how embarassing it was to come to school in second-hand robes, how she didn’t think the famous, good, great Harry Potter would
”I don’t know what
”You do?”
”I’m in … ”
”Outside”, Harry says simply. ”I got something for Christmas that will help us sneak out unseen, I promise… Then we’ll just have to make sure we’re far enough away from the castle so we won’t be seen from the windows…”
”Ahhh… Shame…” Slughorn says, but doesn’t seem all that surprised. ”Well, I should know how time consuming it is, Harry here has missed more of my little suppers than he’s attended on account of his Quidditch practise, and that’s just
… if I did, I would tell you that, even under the most ludicruous of circumstances in which Mister Malfoy’s affections for yourself were to waver due to the attentions of another, an eventuality as unlikely as it is laughable, then that
”Ready?” Hagrid says excitedly, looking around at them all as if expecting cheers. ”I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the Forest for yer fifth year, see… Thought we’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y person in Britain who’s managed ter train ’em —”
Harry Potter smiles to himself as his fathers’ muffled voices can be heard from the other side of the door and he wriggles back under the duvet and burrows his face into his pillow, squinting one eye open until he can see the doorhandle turn and then he quickly pretends to be asleep.
with just the Keeper ahead and it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper Weasley—”
”How d’you know?” Seamus demands.
”Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch have both worked tirelessly over the past few months on the arrangements of the Tournament and will join myself, Professor Karkaroff and Madam Maxime on the panel which will be judging the three champions… Now, the casket then, if you please, Mr Filch.”
”Did you do what?” Snape says slowly.
When most of the students have finished their pudding, Dumbledore stands up again and directs them all in another whimsical rendition of the school song. Harry moves his lips half-heartedly, silently begging for the song to end as soon as possible and hoping that the Weasley twins haven’t chosen a slow funeral tune again as he’s struggling to keep his eyes open now that his stomach is full and it’s getting late… Luckily, the twins seem to have gone for a quick foxtrot this year and finish before everyone else. After that it’s only a matter of minutes before the last few people round off their final tunes.
Silence grows thick between them. Harry fidgets with the textbook in front of him. Glancing over at the large clock above the exit, he sighs.
Suddenly, the outline of something huge and curved lying across the tunnel comes into view and Harry’s heart leaps into his throat. Draco’s hand clamps down on his shoulder painfully and he stops dead in his tracks.
It takes the men a moment to notice it, but even without looking up Harry can immediately tell when they do, because the very air in the kitchen seems to freeze over around them.
”Very good”, Voldemort says mockingly. ”Lesson two… we bow to each other…”
… Now he really wishes he hadn’t left the egg to the last minute. He spends every waking moment mulling it over in the next few days — and some sleeping moments as well, since his dreams have started to feature dark waters as an on-going theme.

together… usually, people experiment, or date other people, or they do get together but break up and… and… sometimes, you get lucky and you make up again…”
”Not in writing”, Remus says. ”You’ll have to wait until you see him on Monday…”
”Now, I don’t want to put you through too much embarrassment, Harry”, Remus says with an apologetic look. ”But I really want you to know that you can talk to me about… anything you might be feeling, or ask me any questions you might have… ”
“I’m not doing all the work.”
”Ministry wizards arrived, shooting Stunning spells everywhere… one of them hit me and Winky where we were hiding behind the trees. I was still under the Invisibility Cloak, but Winky was found… of course, my father knew I must be close by and as soon as the coast was clear he came back for me and put me under the Imperius once more and took me home… he’d dismissed Winky for her failure to keep me under control, so it was just the two of us in the house… just two people in one big house, never saying a word to each other… I might as well have stayed in Azkaban… but then…”
going with him — oh, that makes me feel
Draco’s fingers dig into the muscles of Harry’s arms, hard enough to bruise and it anchors him.
”Come on… I want to see who puts their name in the Goblet…”
”— I’ll soon have you back to rights!
When Harry goes up to the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning, he notices that the other students have all forgone their house tables and are sitting together at the far end of the Hufflepuff table, joined by Professor Dumbledore and a handfull of teachers, including Snape. Harry sidles up to his Head of House and cautiously slides into the seat next to him.
”So … So we should go this way …” Harry mumbles, pointing towards a staircase heading downwards. ”Towards the dungeons.”
Harry nods in understanding.
”Because —!” Harry says loudly, then immediately lowers his voice again and looks around carefully. ”
”What second prophecy?” Harry says excitedly. ”Why haven’t you told
”My subject is History of Magic”, the ghost professor says in a dry, wheezy voice. ”I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends… In September of that year, a sub-committee of Sardinian sorcerers —”
”Not for lack of trying…” Seamus mutters and the other boys snicker good-naturedly.
”You will address me as
It’s the evening before Harry’s twelfth birthday, but for the first time in his life Harry isn’t insisting on going to bed really early so that morning will appear to come faster and he isn’t feeling the least bit excited either. In fact — there’s no better word to describe it — Harry is sitting at his desk
… knowing how close he came to
”I don’t get it…” Seamus says quietly, looking between the others.
”Right… Of course… And when you say… I mean… You said they raised you together…?”
His high spirits last all day — especially when Draco receives a second note from his mother at lunchtime,  informing him that the necessary amendments have been made to the decree concerning methods of discipline to exclude the use of blood quills and related equipment — But they come crashing down on him again in one swell swoop, when a timid-looking Second Year scurries up to him in the Great Hall at dinner and hands him a pink roll of parchment that stinks of lavender.
Harry nods.
”Will you please… Go… Please?”
All it says is that they’re both happy that he’s made the Slytherin quidditch team and
”I’ve already named the owl Hedwig”, Harry announces proudly putting the cage down on the table. ”Because she’s just mine, but since the kitten will be all of ours, we should come up with a name together!”
He stares helplessly across the thread of light leading from his wand to Voldemort’s, right into the other wizard’s face. The scarlet eyes are burning more than ever, but there is a hit of panic around them now.
”Harry, please… Let us help you…” the old man says, his voice barely above a whisper and trembling with some emotion.
”Mr Crouch, are you all right —?”
”Now what?” Ron says.
Harry whips his head around to stare at Remus. The man is eyeing his husband with a doubtful frown.
and you’re
”Kill me?” Harry says doubtfully. ”But if he’s been Ron’s pet rat this whole time, he’s had plenty of opportunities to kill me and he’s never even tried — Okay, ow, you’re
”Oh, he does”, Quirrell says casually. ”Or — well — hate is a strong word, I suppose… He certainly wasn’t pleased when you were sorted into his house, though… He was at school with your father, don’t you know — all of your fathers, I should say — and ah… ha ha… Severus does hold a grudge, I’m afraid…”
my classes now, you know, while it’s still true!”
Bemused, Harry takes the letters from the owl and watches as it takes flight again and soars back out of the window.
”Well, I… I was asleep in my bed… and I was dreaming, something different, it doesn’t matter… but then the dream changed and…”
”Don’t make it worse”, Remus mutters with a pained look at the bird’s nest on Harry’s head.
She begins to turn away from them, but freezes when Draco’s whispered
He doesn’t necessarily think he’s better his classmates anyway and he definitely hadn’t meant to
”Well it… It can assume whatever shape the person is frightened of… It kind of lives off fear.”
”I told you, they needed to get me to the graveyard. They needed my blood.”
”I have t—”
”—There’s nothing anyone can do! —
He gently massages the salve into the abused skin on Harry’s hand, his face a mask of intense concentration and his breathing shallow. Harry finds himself unconsciously matching each breath and getting slightly light-headed.
”N-no, no… I c-can’t… I mean, I’m not… I don’t need…” Harry stammers, trying to pull away from the surprisingly strong wizard. ”I don’t need the hospital wing — please —”
”Well,
When he opens his bedroom door, the smell of coffee and fresh-baked bread hits him and his stomach gurgles happily.
”I’m afraid Mr Crouch isn’t well, not well at all”, Percy says with a melodramatically pained look on his face. ”Hasn’t been since the World Cup — well, no wonder — overworked, of course! He’s not as young as he used to be, after all, though still brilliant, of course! The mind remains as great as it ever was, but the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry and being the great man that he is, Mr Crouch felt personally responsible, which is of course absurd,
showering together. There isn’t time”, Draco says, leading the way out of the dorm.
”Okay…” Harry sighs. ”Do you really have to go away for your transformation, though?”
”Yes, let’s go!” he says, spinning her around and steering her through the crowd.
the water?” Harry continues. ”…floating?”
Heart pounding furiously in his chest and blood rushing to his head, Harry hears a thumping noise in his ears and tears his eyes away from the wound on the back of his hand, that’s already started to heal over again, and looks up to meet the woman’s eyes that blink at him in feigned innocence.
”I know”, the house-elf mumbles, rubbing his head.
”Now, Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby, but… Dobby had hoped that if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him then… he might not want to go back to school, sir…”
He quickly turns the map around and scans it. His daddy had been looking at the ground level of the castle, with the deserted Great Hall and Entrance Hall side by side… And outside the castle he can see the lawn and the lake, Hagrid’s hut with Hagrid and his bloodhound Fang inside it, the Hippogriff Buckbeak tethered outside… The Forbidden Forest… The quidditch pitch and the Whomping Willow…
”Thank you, Headmaster”, the toad-woman says in a simpering, high-pitched voice that makes the hairs in the back of Harry’s neck stand. ”for those kind words of welcome…
live with the threat of assassination or the very real probability of having to join a war after graduation constantly looming over them.
Harry says nothing, but it doesn’t sound like a coincidence at all to him.
”Well, never mind that”, Draco says and grabs the hand in his and starts to pull on it insistently. ”Breakfast is ready and father has said we need to leave in half an hour—”
”I’m telling you now”, Sirius says with another pointed look and Harry immediately snaps his mouth shut again. ”I went to have a look at the shelf in question, of course. And… Yeah, there it was. Not the original prophecy that had somehow got misplaced, like Croaker seemed to think. I knew it couldn’t have been anyway, unless Harry or You Know Who himself had put it there. This was a new one, made in ’94 — so whatever the ’81 prophecy meant, or Dumbledore
”Ehm, I — I think I’m okay — thank you, Sir.”
”No!” Harry shouts.
Remus sighs and holds out his hands, ”Let me see the letter…”
”How many times?”
Harry gives a watery chuckle and wipes his face on his sleeve.
”In the summer term”, Professor Trewlawny continues as though she didn’t hear him. ”We shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with the fire-omens, that is — Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us for ever.”
”How are you feeling, pup?” Remus asks him gently, carding his fingers through his sweat-damp hair as he hands him the steaming mug.
”Well?” the Potions Master prompts.
At the end of their first day of classes, they have a subject that they’ve all been looking forward to — Defence Against The Dark Arts — but it turns out to be the biggest disappointment yet. The lesson and Professor Quirrell himself are both a bit of a joke, Harry decides as he and Draco make their way out of the classroom again. The Professor had told them that the turban he favours had been a gift from an African prince to say thanks for getting rid of a zombie, but when Seamus asked him how he’d fought off the zombie in question, Professor Quirrell had immediately blushed a faint pink and started stammering about the weather.
”Now, shall we discuss the matter at hand…” he suggests kindly. ”I have discussed the matter at length with various experts and we are all in agreement that by falling through the doorway between the Space Room and the Time Room… at the exact same time… as the other Harry… a portal was created and the two of you landed in the other’s dimension.”
”Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their books?” asks Hagrid with fast faltering enthusiasm.
saying to
The door swings open with a sigh behind him, but Harry refuses to turn around. He can feel his daddy’s presence like sunlight on his back and it’s a little comforting but not nearly enough.
”Who?”
He suddenly catches sight of a dead rooster dangling from one of Hagrid’s massive hands and recoils so suddenly he trips backwards and loses his footing again.
the voice persists.
”But Professor—!” Draco blurts out, but immediately cuts himself off again when Harry knocks their knees together under the desk.
ferrets!”
Harry turns his head and looks up at his Head of House, frowning in confusion at the smoking goblet in the man’s hand.
”I’ll be
”Sir, you don’t understand—!”
”Yes, that’s great”, Harry says quickly. ”But where did you see the eyes? And could you see anything else? A face? Body?”
And as he drifts in and out of a fitful, half-doze, he is haunted by images of a lonely and frustrated wolf bumping between the trees of the Forbidden Forest, clawing at itself and howling at the full moon…
”What are you two making eyes at each other for?” Draco snaps suspisciously.
”Impressive…” he grunts and then looks between Harry and Draco. ”Very impressive for a second year, actually. I’m going to have to go with Potter, Malfoy… You can be the reserve seeker, though.”
”That was very poignant…” Pansy comments idly, as she claps her hands together slowly a couple of times.
”Excellent”, Bagman exclaims. ”Well, good luck to you all… Now, Harry, could I have a quick word? Outside?”
”Sit up straight”, Pansy hisses at him from across the table, while Harry whispers, ”Snape’s watching!”
”How it must pain you then… to see your flesh and blood in the arms of a filthy blood-traitor…” Voldemort says finally, as casually as if he’d commented on the weather.
”Fine, I promise I won’t ever
As soon as the door slams shut, the circular room begins to swirl around them once more and Harry squeezes his eyes shut in frustration until the rumbling noise dies down.
”Thanks so much”, Harry says, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
”I’m sure Harry is heartbroken to hear that… now, now, it’s the boy last few moments on earth, after all… surely you won’t let him die without your blessing, Lucius? Come now, show some mercy…”
”They’re fine”, Sirius says. ”Everything’s fine. You just get some rest, okay?”
”Draco…”
”Then let’s go back to my office…” a soft voice says suddenly next to him.
”Yes… And as I watched, the petal sank towards the bottom of the bowl, but… Before it reached the bottom it transformed into a goldfish. It was incredible magic.
fine.
”Harry!”
”You and I will speak again, at length, I assure you”, he continues somberly. ”But first, I want to pay another visit to the Ministry and the Department of Mysteries.”
Harry just groans in reply and shoves his face back into his pillow.
”Oh, shut up”, Sirius says. ”How many times do I have to tell you to call me Sirius?”
Harry inhales deeply through his nose and shoves his fists into his pockets, counting backwards from five.
”No, no, I know
”Harry? What’re yeh — is that Draco Malfoy?”
Aaaaaand scene.
Harry watches him fondly now, thinking he looks completely deranged with the remnants of his nosebleed smudged all over his face.
” Snape hollers.
”Good evening, Professor”, Harry says and shuffles inside the office.
Groaning in pleasure, Harry wraps his arms around the other boy’s lithe frame and hugs him closer, thrilled to feel the embrace returned.
”Why would you be in trouble, mister Potter?”
? En-Enchant Ginny? But Ginny’s not… Ginny hasn’t been… has she?”
After half an hour, he can hear the library start to fill up with other students but the large row of bookcases that blocks him from view allows him the privacy to keep working without having to deal with looks or whispers.
”And you have some punishments in mind?”
”Well you won’t like this then…” Blaise says drily. ”The Weasley girl and Longbottom are also in the club…”
He doesn’t think Draco’s mysterious dreams about the ocean will necessarily answer all of these questions for him, exactly. But curiosity is clawing at him all the same, so when he’s sure the blonde isn’t looking, Harry reaches for his copy of
Lucius quickly shakes his head.
”Ehm, yeah, almost… where’s daddy?”
”I don’t know”, Professor Snape says. ”Harry says he’s found Barty in the Forest.”
Harry’s eyes flood with tears as the pain gets stronger and stronger, but he forces himself to stay present, to keep Quirrell talking — anything to buy him time —
”Well, at least now we know what’s happened to Draco’s letter, don’t we…” Remus says with a smile and rubs circles on Harry’s back. ”Let’s floo the Malfoys tomorrow morning and explain everything, and then we can arrange that outing in Diagon Alley as well.”
” he snaps angrily, wheeling back around. ”Can we go already? I want to get out of here!”
”No”, Harry says in a strangled voice, willing himself to believe it.
”—and, of course, his friend”, Slughorn adds, gesturing to the tall and handsome man standing next to Mister Worple and looking slightly bored about it. ”Sanguini.”
”That means no”, Draco mutters sullenly to Harry.
A wave of relief washes over Harry and he relaxes back against the pillow again. ”And my dad’s … okay?”
”Yeah, what?” he repeats.
The next day — Friday the 30th, the day of the arrival — trickles past at a snail’s pace and Harry, like the rest of the students, finds himself throwing furtive looks at the clock or out the windows every other minute to try and determine how much longer until six o’clock… Finally, in their second to last lesson of the day, Defence Against the Dark Arts, they’re all sufficiently distracted however, when Professor Moody clears a big space in the middle of the classroom and tells them he’s going to put them each under the Imperius Curse so that they may know what it feels like.
Shaking his hands once more, Harry sucks in a deep breath and walks out of the tent…
Looking at the young men in the illustrations on the front of the two romantic novels, the word springs up as simply and easily as anything —
”—brother of Beaters Fred and George and a promising new talent—”
”Tom, Tom, Tom…” Slughorn booms in his usual dramatic voice, wagging a sugar-coated finger at the boy playfully. ”If I knew I couldn’t tell you, you know that! Now, I’d like to know where you get your information from, my dear boy; more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.”
”I’ve been growing stronger and stronger, feeding off her deepest fears and darkest secrets… In fact, I eventually grew stronger and more powerful than little Miss Weasley and could start pouring some of
guardian. I’m hardly going to fight about
Dumbledore falls silent and studies Harry’s face patiently for a moment, then gently asks him what he’s thinking.
Harry frowns down at the photograph of the glowing box briefly then looks up at Draco again, trying to determine if the excited glint in his eyes is genuine or for show. To his utter bemusement, it seems to be real. Draco looks up and meets his eyes with a grin.
”Learn some tact, Finnegan”, Blaise retorts. ”Draco’s fine, Harry. Madam Pompfrey just wanted to do a check-up…”
Next to Harry, Draco lets out a small scoff and whispers incredulously, ”Some people got a ’D’?
”That’s what you said five minutes ago! And five minutes before that! Now get up!”
”I … I don’t … I don’t understand.”
Remus snorts, but immediately swats at his husband’s head playfully, He misses him by an inch however, because Sirius leans away from him just in time and shoots him a teasing grin. Harry beams, happy to see that his dads have made up.
He attempts to push past Potions Master, but Professor Snape takes a step back so that he is still blocking Remus’s path even as he gives him an apologetic look. A soft growl escapes Remus and Harry can tell that he’s more or less vibrating with barely controlled rage at this point. Something that might be fear flickers in Professor Snape’s black eyes, but despite this he puts a calming hand on top of Remus’s shoulder and murmurs his name quietly.
Parkinson and Malfoy pull identical faces of disgust and Zabini raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him. Then they all go back to ignoring him again. Harry shrugs to himself and chugs the last of his pumpkin juice and gets to his feet again.
”Yes, well —!” Remus interrupts loudly. ”We really must hurry you, we still have a lot of stuff to buy!”
”It’s very
She hoots lightly and nips at his finger playfully.
”Mum, you remember Harry and Draco from school”, Seamus tells her and she nods at each of them in turn, eyes narrowed in consideration.
. The prophecy says it’s you or him—”
school boys are like”, Voldemort says lightly, to a chorus of laughs.
”Hey, Harry…” he says and collapses in the chair opposite him. ”Did you have a good day with Draco?”
?” Sirius muffled voice calls up from the kitchen. ”
”Please, Sir—!” Granger’s voice pipes up from the Gryffindor side of the room and Harry glances over to see her hand twitch eagerly in the air. ”We’ve done Boggarts, Red Caps, Kappas and Grindylows, and we’re about to start —”
”Well?” the blonde demands. ”What have you got to say for yourself?”
going to stay there…
”Yeah, I know… But…”
He stands off to the side, fuming silently as Remus pays for the robes. Madam Malkin waves good bye to him and he gives her a quick wave back, still scowling to himself.
scrape a passing grade in his Defense O.W.L.?” Draco grouses suddenly and Harry follows his narrowed gaze to the other end of the corridor where the Gryffindors are lounging. ”I swear, these Gryffindors, they’re like a social strain of the dragon pox and not even Gunhilda de Gorsemoor can save me—!”
Their first lesson, according to their new timetables, is Transfiguration and for once Harry is eager to delve into the tough subject. If anything is going to take his mind off things, is the stern teachings of Professor McGonagall and the immense focus required in her subject, second only to Potions with Professor Snape.
… What are you doing out of bed? Have you any idea what time it is?”
”Draco, we have to wait our turn”, Harry whispers.
No-one can help him.
Remus hands the card to his husband and the two exchange a fond look.
Draco blinks and tears his eyes away from the window again, meeting his gaze.
They’ve been inside for several minutes already when Harry realises there’s another person there. A woman about the same age as Morfin, with the same eyes. She’s wearing a dress so dirty it made her blend in with the stone wall behind her, which is why Harry didn’t see her until Gaunt introduced her to Ogden as his daughter Merope.
Harry looks up as well to see a red-faced Ron and an apprehensive Granger stopped halfway towards the Gryffindor table, glaring back at Draco.
Harry assumes he’s still upset —
Unless they’d been given the same stuff that Professor Snape had given
, Harry’s inner voice panics and his heart hammers in agreement.
”Oh what now…” Remus mutters.
”Oh, bravo!” Professor Tofty exclaims happily when Harry demonstrates a perfect Boggart Banishing Spell. ”Very good indeed, young man! Very impressive!”
when he said
”Piece of cake?” Remus offers Snape with a smile and the other man shoots him a half-hearted glare.
”Sooo…” Seamus says slowly, looking expectantly between the two of them. ”What’s the status…?”
”It’s called culture, dorcus…” Daphne says in a long-suffering voice.
He feels Remus scramble for his wand and in the next moment, all the lamps along the hallway walls are lit and Harry can see Sirius tugging desperately on an old moth-eaten velvet curtain, trying to pull it back into place in front of a massive portrait of an elderly witch…
Pansy lets out a small sniff and looks away, clearly happy to go with that plan. Draco, on the other hand, keeps blinking at him. Harry huffs, watching him impatiently. After a moment, the blonde’s mouth begins moving as well, but no sound actually come out of it.
” he hollers.
Suddenly the door of the broom cupboard flies open and, blinking in the sudden sunlight, they both turn to see Professor Dumbledore standing outside, peering at them curiously over his half-moon spectacles and smiling serenely.
Remus looks over at Harry thoughtfully and Harry gives him a pinched smile.
”Now, Harry”, he says, pushing and pulling on him until he’s standing in the perfect spot. ”When Draco points his wand at you, you do
Harry follows Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall out of the Hospital Wing and down the Hospital Tower across to the main castle, feeling like a lost duckling trailing after them, especially as he almost has to jog to keep up with their quick pace.
Grinning madly, Harry dashes forward and launches himself at the other boy, nearly knocking him off his feet as he throws his arms around him. Draco lets out a breathy chuckle and returns the embrace.
”If you would just
”What?” Harry frowns.
Harry turns to meet his gaze and smiles, feeling the other boy’s fingers brush circular patterns on his arm.
The fluttery warmth in Harry’s belly trickles down and pools in his sternum and he rolls over on his stomach and groans into his pillow.
”Inter-Departmental memos”, Mr Weasley says. ”We used to use owls, but the mess was just not manageable…”
Remus has prepared the biggest breakfast spread yet, the dishes of which take up not only the entire kitchen table but continues to dot the side of the stove and window sill. Anywhere there is available surface space basically, Remus has put a dish of something. If Draco’s glittering eyes and relaxed smile wasn’t evidence enough that he’s having a really good Christmas, possibly his best one yet, then the fact that he doesn’t panic at the sight of all this food, and the social expectation to try some of everything, surely is. He just keeps grinning happily and when Remus finally joins them at the table and tells them all to
When he’s accumulated about twenty inches of notes, Harry puts his quill down and flexes his stiff fingers with a grimace. He looks over his scribbles with a sigh. Each one of his theories is as outrageous as the rest. But the truth is, not even this world’s Remus, not even
Then with surprising speed, the man had leapt forward and snatched the Map from him. After inspecting the parchment quickly, he’d floo called Harry’s daddy who, Harry found out later, had been searching for Harry on the fifth floor of the castle.
Riddle pauses with a cold smile, then continues as if Harry never spoke at all, ”Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Salazar himself… But—”
… a lot of the time!”
” Harry splutters.
Eventually, he gets his breathing back under control and his tears run out.
As if hearing Harry’s thoughts, Draco’s gaze flits over to him and he gives him a sour look loaded with challenge. Harry swallows thickly and says nothing.
private—”
”They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry without my help lately…” Skeeter retorts, then gives Harry another sideways look. ”How does that make you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstoo—?”
”Oh Merlin…” Harry murmurs and lurches forward to lean his hands on his knees.
He waits until his dads’s voices quiet down out in the kitchen, then ventures out of his bedroom again. He finds Sirius sprawled out on the sofa listening to the Wireless, but there’s no sign of Remus anywhere.
Harry heaves the trunk off the Hogwarts Express and it almost lands on his foot, but he just manages to move it in time. He straightens up and wipes his forehead with his sleeve. You don’t appreciate magic until you’re not allowed to use it anymore…
”What?” Harry and Ron say in unison.
Heart lodged in his throat, Harry follows the now unmistakable sound of someone crying to the boys bathroom at the end of the corridor. The door is left slightly ajar and Harry inches closer to the crack. Someone —
”Yeah, I suppose…”
He gestures towards the small opening in the hedge.
The smile on Lupin’s face falls away and he frowns with worry instead.
”I’m not”, Draco retorts. ”We’re not playing any childish parlour games!
Harry thinks. The girl famously dropped the subject last year. According to the rumours, she called Trelawny a miserable bat and then threw a crystal ball on her foot before storming out of the classroom…
”Yeah, I remember what the book said…” Harry says and nods.
”You mean it wasn’t those… those Death Eaters who did it?”
”And what happened?”
Ron instantly falls silent, but his ears are still burning bright red, as is the rest of his face now.
”N-no, Sir!” Harry says.
”Please, let us at least
”Er — thanks, I guess”, Harry mutters. ”What — what are you doing in my room, though?”
— your
around him and the bizarre sensation as it
Everyone turns to stare at him in varying degrees of shock and incredulity, as if it never actually occurred to either one of them that that might be the case, except for Snape who’s eyes are still shuttered. Harry swallows thickly, giving his head a small shake.
, he thinks.
Harry thinks sadly.
Hermione Granger is backed into the far wall of the bathroom, her entire body shaking like a leaf as she stares up at the gigantic mountain troll slowly advancing on her while knocking sinks off the walls with his club.
”Okay”, Harry says dully and slips inside the shop, his belly fluttering nervously as Remus waves to him through the glass door, before disappearing from sight.
Later that night, Harry lies in his bed pretending to sleep as he listens to Remus tell Sirius all about it.
”Hello, Harry…” the young man says importantly. ”It’s good to see you again…”
They’re halfway through the game when Blaise saunters into the Common Room, looking particularly smug as he sprawls out on the rug in front of their table.
Harry thinks, but what comes out of his mouth is, ”Yes…”
? Please, just — before we go — just make sure your dad’s not home?”
”That will do”, he says sharply, sounding almost alive for once. ”It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story — we will return — if you please — to
”FIGHT BACK YOU COWARD!” Severus cries, lunging after his wand as he goes flying out of his hand and manages to snatch it out of the air before it reaches Sirius.
The Aurors turn back to face him, frowning seriously.
, if there
”Fine”, Harry mutters and stands up, looking around.
”Right you are…” the grisly old wizard says curtly and promptly goes back to ignoring Harry.
His prediction isn’t far off the mark.
”You went there with Pansy?” Harry asks casually, feeling a ghost of his old jealousy flare up inside his chest. ”When you and I were… you know… in Third Year?”
”You sure you’re okay to play?” Harry asks him.
and they hop inside hurriedly. Harry scans the numbers on the buttons quickly, thinking back to theat day in the summer when he was here with his dad and pressing the button with the nine on it. With a stomach-jolting jostle, the lift begins to descend rapidly into the darkness below them. Harry feels Draco inch closer to him, his hand clambering to grip his at his side and Harry gives it a reassuring squeeze.
”Yess…” Snape murmurs quietly and Harry feels a shiver run through him. ”And you should probably also inform your dorm mates of the situation.”
A miserable hiccough is the only warning they get before the ghost begins to sob dramatically. Harry sighs. He reaches out and gives Draco’s wrist a gentle squeeze.
of their hearts beating together… he recalls the
They both dissolve in another bout of giggles, clinging to each other happily.
have?” Remus asks lightly, walking back to the stove to resume baking. ”Harry and I had the deal that he could study to become an animagus sooner, if he passed all his O.W.L:s and got at least two Os—”
And he can’t very well name the other Death Eaters and omit Lucius, just because he’s in a relationship with his son, either.
Harry thinks as they return to the surface and both men visibly relax next to him.
Harry blinks.
, since the lesson just before lunch is in fact double Defence Against the Dark Arts with the Gryffindors — and he makes sure to grab a seat at the very back of the classroom, hoping to hide as much as possible without skiving off the lesson altogether, so that Lockhart won’t embarrass him further in front of everyone.
”Well, where else do you have in mind?” Draco whispers back.
”Yes”, Harry mutters, nodding to himself. ”I don’t think it’s true that she, er… Doesn’t know you exist, I mean, she asked you to come see her right?”
sorry, Harry”, Sirius says with a sigh. ”I forget sometimes what it was like to be twelve, thirteen… I didn’t mean to suggest that what you’re feeling isn’t real or…”
”That won’t be necessary”, Professor Snape says and finishes whatever sentence he’s been writing with a flourish and puts the quill down. ”Mister Potter, I believe I asked you to take a seat.”
For a second it looks as though Bagman is debating with himself over whether to object to this or not, but Harry turns around before he’s made up his mind.
”That’s not an argument”, Draco insists. ”Saying things could be worse doesn’t alter the fact that they’re still quite awful as they are!”
and curls up on top of his bed, hugging one of his pillows to his chest as he closes his eyes and thinks back… a rush of images erupts inside his mind and he remembers hearing voices, howling voices but filtered as though he’d heard them from below the surface of the water in the lake… none of it makes any sense to Harry, but he remembers feeling a surge of pure rage when the pain shot through his head and
”Yes”, Snape says curtly.
”Harry, do you want some coffee?” Sirius asks suddenly, rudely interrupting Snape but acting like he didn’t notice.
Harry looks over at the next table, where Ron takes his seat next to Hermione. The red-head meets his eyes and gives him a pinched smile.
”, Voldemort snarls. ”
”What similarities are you even talking about?” Harry demands, still boiling with annoyance. ”I’m
He scans the paper quickly, and Harry steps closer to him and peers down at the parchment over his shoulder. It looks like a riddle to him and he frowns. They don’t have time for riddles, any minute now Snape will have his hand on the Stone!
” says aghast.
But it’s obvious to Harry that the Bulgarian Seeker had had no choice, since Lynch had already spotted the Snitch, but he also thinks Krum might have realised that the Irish Chasers were too good for his own team to ever catch up and simply wanted to end the match on his own terms. And Harry admires him all the more for it.
When he unrolls the parchment however, he immediately recognises the handwriting as Sirius’ and not Remus’ and all the short message says is to go see Dumbledore and tell him everything.
”The Hogwarts champion”, Dumbledore calls out. ”Is Cedric Diggory!”
”It was”, Draco insists, resting his head on his hand and smirking at him.
” Harry calls after him, then mutters to himself. ”I’ll just stand here and wait…”
Finally their carriage comes to a stop below the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors of the castle. Harry hops down and immediately bows his head, covering it with both arms against as he runs up the stairs. Not until he’s safely inside the massive Entrance Hall does he look up and shake his wet hair out of his face. Draco performs a quick drying charm on himself, then does the same to Harry who grins his thanks.
”I hate this castle sometimes”, Pansy mutters.
There’s a flash of realisation in Potion Master’s dark eyes and he presses his thin lips together.
”At the end of your first year at Hogwarts”, Remus adds and Harry’s heart does a double tap, as his mind flashes back to the moment he woke up in the Hospital Wing, after his run-in with Professor Quirrell and Voldemort.
Harry is reminded of the chairs in Dumbledore’s office that were fluffy and comfortable. Snape’s choice of furniture is fittingly the opposite of Dumbledore’s. It makes Harry smile, but he quickly schools his face into a serious frown when he catches Snape’s eye.
With a horrible hiss, the Basilisk’s jaws snap shut and Harry just has time to let go of the sword and throw himself backwards before they close over him — but not fast enough… One of the fangs pierces the flesh of his arm and he lets out a shout as waves of indescribable pain courses through his arm and rapidly spreads throughout his body… It’s the poison, he thinks in a panic… I can feel the poison spreading…
”He’s talking to Dumble — er — Professor — Headmaster Dumbledore”, Sirius says, then glances past Harry to where Draco is still sitting hunched over. ”Hey, Draco! You feeling better today?”
”From a lily?” Harry says, feeling an odd pinch in his chest.
The moment they enter the Great Hall for the Hallowe’en feast however, all thoughts of detentions and homework are immediately put out of their minds. The entire Hall has been decked out with lavish Hallowe’en decorations and a thousand live bats are fluttering between the walls and the enchanted ceiling, making the candles inside the pumpkins flicker eerily. And just as it had done at the Welcoming Feast, food suddenly appears on the table from out of nowhere and they all begin to tuck in excitedly.
”Hurry — up —” Harry gasps, as a particularly thick tendril wounds around his chest and squeezes hard. ”Can’t — breathe —!”
”That’s it”. Dumbledore repeats happily. ”Time to go!”
, he tells himself.
Harry hardly needs telling twice. He jumps up from the chair as if burned and scampers over to the door, but then he hesitates, looking back over at Snape with a questioning look. Dumbledore’s eyes are twinkling again as he looks between Harry and Snape over the rim of his glasses.
is definitely misleading, Harry thinks. Barty Crouch informed them that the first task will be taking place on the twenty-fourth of November, but the only thing he told them about the actual task was that he wasn’t going to tell them anything about the task, because apparently
”I will”, Sirius says and gives him one last squeeze before leaning back again. ”I’ll see you at Christmas, okay?”
Harry immediately shrinks back into the shadows and pulls Draco with him, hugging him close… They hold their breaths… Harry can feel Draco’s heartbeat against his own…
As much as Harry and Sirius sometimes make fun of Remus and his overconfidence in the magical powers of chocolate, on this particular occasion he’s right. A few sips of chocolate, with his dads’ arms around him and Christmas carols playing on the Wireless, Harry actually begins to feel better.
”Yeah…” Harry shrugs. ”I don’t think I’ll have to sit an O.W.L. in it our anything though… it’s kind of a secret.”
”Grape —?” Harry frowns in confusion.

It thrashes its horned head nervously and paws the snowy ground with its golden hooves as they approach.
”What made you change strategies then?”
”No, I — I don’t know what you’re talking about, I didn’t do anything to your dad, okay? I—”
Harry rolls his eyes, ”There’s
and the blonde shoots him a knowing smirk, pressing his knee into Harry’s.
and he leans forward to cross his arms on top of the table with a sigh.
”All right, pup?” Remus asks carefully.
, to avoid being trampled by excitable children and their stressed out parents…
”Coffee for me”, Sirius says and gets to his feet, his arm automatically shooting out to catch Harry when he trips over the duvet and almost falls face first to the floor. ”Careful… Maybe it’s time you start drinking coffee, as well…”
He bounces slightly on the balls of his feet as he waits impatiently for her to check the book out for him and as soon as it’s back in his hand he legs it out of the library and doesn’t so much as slow down until he’s back inside the Slytherin Common Room.
Taking a deep breath and then releasing it again in a rush, Harry turns around. Draco is fidgeting nervously, an ink well clutched in front of him. As Harry looks up and meets his eyes finally, he hurriedly holds it out like some kind of peace offering.
Remus is watching him closely again, while Sirius’s eyes dart between the both of them uncertainly.
”Barty sent him to Azkaban. Didn’t even bat an eye—!”
”How did she find out about what happened in Divination, though?” Blaise whispers next to Harry. ”She wasn’t there! She can’t have been! Do you think someone in our class talked to her?”
he thinks and chugs his cup before reaching for the pot for a refill. To think he would have overslept and had to run to potions without any coffee at all if it wasn’t for Draco. He knocks his knee into Draco’s under the table to say
Sirius snickers behind him as he recoils with a blush.
The whole front page is taken up by a large photograph of a patch of sky with a weird, moving cloud shaped like a gaping skull and from inside of its mouth slithers a giant snake… Harry doesn’t know what it means and still it makes the hairs in the back of his neck stand. He tears his eyes away from the picture and reads the headline:
”What are you thinking?” Harry asks, feeling a small thrill of excitement at the idea that they might be getting somewhere, but the girl shakes her head.
The lid of the casket opens slowly, the gentle creak eerily loud in the silence as everyone seems to be holding their breaths. Reaching inside slowly and deliberately, Dumbledore lifts a large wooden cup from inside the chest, filled to the brim with dancing, blue-white flames. Then closing the lid of the chest again, he places the Goblet of Fire on top it.
When Sirius pulls the motorcycle off the ground, Harry slowly walks over to Professor Snape but doesn’t tear his eyes away from the steadily shrinking silhouette of the bike until it’s merely a tiny black dot on the horizon.
”By the end of the year, she’ll go on a rampage and kill us all”, he murmurs darkly.
”That’s you done, dear!” Madam Malkin says, interrupting him.
— it’s just that the prophecy said neither can live while the other survives —”
”I did warn you…” a deep, amused voice says from above them.
Harry nods hurriedly and leans in again. This time, Draco doesn’t resist.
Lockhart stops his long rant immediately, and Filch’s breath hitches as he wrenches his face out of his hands and stares up at the Headmaster.
Granger throws her a napkin across the table with a contemptuous look and the witch begins to blot the front of her robes, while staring at Granger. Harry can tell there’s a hint of reluctant respect in her eyes now, that hadn’t been there before.
While Remus and Professor Snape take their glasses and gingerly sinks into an armchair each, sipping carefully, anxiously, Sirius slumps down on the sofa next to Harry and drains half of his drink in one determined swig, then puts his arm around Harry, all without meeting his gaze at all.
”Or hot chocolate?” Harry adds.
grab your wand. Let’s go into the lounge.”
”It was just a nightmare, Harry”, Remus says gently.
They make their way back to the dungeons in tense silence, each of them lost in their own thoughts until they hear the telltale cackle of the castle’s most notorious poltergeist, Peeves, and quickly duck behind a suit of armour at the top of Slughorn’s Stairs until the coast is clear. Once the malicious ghost has swept past them and disappeared through the wall into the Great Hall, they stand up and share a look.
Harry clamps his teeth down on his tongue to stop himself from snapping again. Dumbledore has an infuriating ability to ramble on. Ask him a straight forward question, a yes or no question even, and you can expect a sonnet in response.
”I’m fine”, Harry mumbles and leans away from his daddy’s touch. ”I just didn’t sleep very well…”
”Hi”, Harry mumbles, watching the other boy warily.
Then Harry
Harry stares in wonder at the broomstick-shaped present at the bottom of the pile, then turns his wide-eyed stare on his fathers.
Harry’s dads are waiting to greet them just inside the door, Sirius shaking hands with Draco while Harry hugs Remus. But when they switch, Remus darts forward and envelops Draco in a hug instead of shaking his hand. The blonde stands rigidly in the embrace, but if Remus thinks the reaction is odd he doesn’t show it, he just pulls back again and claps the blonde on the back, smiling at him kindly.
Harry thinks desperately.
”They’ve been drinking too”, he counters feebly. ”It will be fine!”
The old man seems to be weighing his words very carefully.
Not for the first time, Harry finds himself regretting his impulsive decision to help that house-elf, but he immediately feels bad about it and tells himself that he did the right thing and the right thing is always the right thing, no matter how much the consequences suck…
His worst fears are almost immediately confirmed when Draco flattens the paper on top of the table and they can see that, except for the headline, the whole front page is taken up by a large photograph of a frowning Harry, trying to move out of the shot but being pushed back in by a couple of mannish hands with long, sharp nails. Harry remembers those nails digging into his arm. He was even left with four small bruises as a souvenir.
The shadows inside the Foe Glass have sharpened further, Harry notices. He can make out the outlines of four figures now.
behind The Boy Who Lived—”
Harry glances up and follows the girl’s line of sight. Krum is slouched at the end of the Legal Section, throwing surreptitious looks over at the table where Granger is studying with Ron and Longbottom, apparently oblivious to the small herd of giggling girls lounging half a bookcase away from him.
“You may retire if you wish”, he continues. “Or, if you would prefer, you can join me for tea before bed. It’s entirely up to you.”
, then I’d feel a lot better about everything else… and I know we’ll have to be more careful from now on — though I’m sure Rita Skeeter won’t be able to come inside the Hogwarts grounds again — still — I know — we’ll be really really…
”But… How did you know that?”
When the thunderous scowls on the other two Slytherins’ faces morph into alarm and shock, Harry frowns and mentally repeats to himself what he just said.
He curses silently and whips his head around, looking for another seat.
”You don’t trust me”, Harry mutters after a moment’s tense silence and barely refrains from pouting.
”I suppose”, Harry mutters. ”What are we going to do about the dragon?”
Harry glances over his shoulder and sees the blonde hurry after him, but he doesn’t say anything. Just waits for him to catch up, then sprints across the Entrance Hall and up the large marble staircase. They slip into a deserted corridor on the third level and start making their way to the nearest girls’ toilet when they suddenly hear quick footsteps behind them.
He is a minor! That means he cannot enter into a magical contract without his legal guardian’s consent! Well guess what,
He shrugs.
The man chuckles coldly. Then with a snap of his fingers, ropes spring out of thin air and wrap themselves tightly around Harry’s body, pinning his arms to his sides and squeezing the air out of his lungs.
Harry swallows thickly, and nods. Another pause stretches out between them.
Harry watches his moustache twitch around his a grin, but immediately looks away again when the old man favours him with one of his winks. He exchanges an uncertain look with Draco and Blaise, then looks over at
The blonde has been unusually nice to him all day. It’s almost as if he’s forgiven Harry. But, in order for him to have done that, Harry would have had to ask for his forgiveness and Harry hasn’t. He’s been wanting to, ever since it happened. But he hasn’t been able to get the words out.
”Harry!”
If the threat of expulsion and Professor Snape’s reprimand, which reminded Harry of his promise to his dads to stay out of trouble this year, weren’t enough to strengthen his resolve to keep his head down and stay off Umbridge’s radar, then these nightly detentions surely are… as Harry averts his eyes from the woman’s wide, cold grin and slumps into the straight-backed chair for the third night in a row, feeling like he’s stuck in some nightmarish vicious circle, he can help but think that he’d do anything not to have to come back here again —
”So are you”, Harry says.
”What’s the rush?” Harry mock-whines, but obediently sits up and reaches for his glasses.
”Well… Think maybe they started it without you?”
”All right, well…” Sirius says, clapping his hands together and backing towards the open door again.
As springs draws to a close, the Fifth Years are beginning to really feel the heat — and not because the days are getting warmer, but because the dreaded OWLs, that they’ve been warned about and preparing for all year, are now no longer the cautionary tale told by teachers to get them to do homework, but an actual reality looming on the horizon.
”Well, this is
”What’s that, my dear?” Trewlawny says directly behind him and Harry startles.
”I mean… yeah, that’s… yeah”, Harry says, frowning. ”But why are you telling us? You’re asking us to join your study group?”
As soon as the door of the classroom opens, the Gryffindors hurry inside and fight over the seats at the front of the class, while Harry and the rest of the Slytherins hang back, more than happy to claims the tables at the back of the classroom.
”I’m not — I wasn’t — I’m just saying, that’s
”What?” Draco says. ”I know — I’m tired too!”
”That’s alright, we can meet you in
”Finally…” a voice whispers behind him.
The fantasy is still fresh in his mind when he wakes up the next morning, and even if it wasn’t, sitting across from Draco at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall would surely have reminded him… Harry can’t help but to stare as the blonde helps himself to a bowl of plain yogurt and then proceeds to finish said bowl one half-spoon at a time, more or less licking the white creamy substance from the golden spoon… and then getting a drop of yogurt on the side of his mouth… within minutes, Harry is embarrassingly hard under his robes and can only blush and blink when Draco gives him a funny look.
It’s okay, he keeps telling himself. It’s okay, it’s okay, there is no Dark Mark on his arm, he’s unharmed, he’s here, he’s safe, it’s okay, it’s going to be okay.
Pansy, never one to back down, immediately joins in and clutches Harry’s arm in a bruising grip.
”Did you just use Granger as a verb?” Pansy asks with a lightly raised eyebrow. ”I like it.”
”So, what made you decide to enter the Tournament, Harry?”
are punctuating the silence and hooded figures approach him slowly through the mist. As they get close enough that Harry can see their masked faces, his hope sinks like boulder from his chest and lands heavily in his gut, so heavily it seems to pull his entire body down and he hangs limply from the ropes, like some abandoned puppet…
Professor Dumbledore’s pale blue eyes flicker from Draco to Harry and for a terrifying moment, Harry is sure the old man can see right through him, right into his very core and read his mind… But then the man’s eyes flicker away again and come to rest on Filch instead, ”Innocent until proven guilty, Argus…”
”I am
Harry covers his face with his hands and groans, arching his neck over the back of the sofa.
Remus chuckles and combs his fingers through Harry’s hair fondly.
”I’ll see you in a bit then, Harry, yeah?” Sirius says, with an attempt at a smile twisting his lips even though his eyes are still troubled. ”I’m just going to have a word with the Headmaster…”
Draco swallows hard and takes a deliberate step back from him, his cheeks flaring up in a nice, rosy blush that he quickly ducks his head to hide… Harry smiles fondly and reaches out to brush the boy’s hair out of his face…
”Is that what they are? I thought you were just amusing yourself by finding new and inventive ways for your pawns to get massacred—”
As soon as the door has clicked shut, the other boys stop pretending to sleep and sit up eagerly. Harry looks between them and feels slightly amused despite everything.
how I feel about her—!”
”Never you mind…” Blaise retorts.
The Slytherin Common Room is completely deserted, but Harry can hear muffled voices coming from one of the girls’ dormitories. The boys’ side seems quiet though and Harry is immensely grateful for that. This is just what he needs right now: peace and quiet — and a bed.
”My name is Dobby, Sir… Dobby the house-elf”, the small creature says in a high-pitched squeaky voice and immediately jumps down from the bed and gives Harry a bow so low that his tiny, pencil-shaped nose brushes the carpet. ”It is an honour to meet mister Harry Potter, Sir…”
But then a subtle scent hits him and even though he can’t put his finger on where he’s smelled it before, it feels familiar and safe, like coming back to Hogwarts after a summer at the Dursley’s …
Harry goes to bed with a huge grin on his face and is just drifting off to sleep when the bed dips next to him and startles him awake again. He just has time to see a flash of blonde hair in the gloom, before his lips are captured in a searing kiss and a warm body is pressed flush against his own.
”No”, he says, his voice scratching his throat as he forces it out. ”Nothing.”
Karkaroff jumps and spins around to see Professor Moody standing right behind him, his good eye glaring up at the Durmstrang Head Teacher while his magical one flits over to Harry.
Harry suddenly remembers everything Sirius said about Divination before Remus made him be quiet and wonders if it’s too late to change to Arithmancy…
”What?” Draco murmurs, frowning in confusion.
— he hurtles around the whole of the second floor, trying to strain his ears and listen for the voice over the pounding of his and Draco’s footsteps and their panting breaths.
”There are colours other than beige and brown on your plate”, Pansy comments lightly on his other side. ”Are you feeling well?”
He has just a moment to marvel at how warm it feels in his hand, before a cool voice drifts out of the shadows towards him…
— I don’t…”
Remus pushes the dry t-shirt over Harry’s head and guides him to push his arms through. Pulling the material down, Remus rubs Harry’s back swiftly to warm him up again.
”Blaise — Harry — oh, and Draco, too — welcome, welcome!” Slughorn booms happily as they all approach, the red tazzles on his hat bobbing happily around his head. ”Come in, come in! There are so many people I want to introduce you all to — but first things first, let me greet your guests — who do we have —?”
”That’s fine”, Snape mutters. ”I’m sure you will fill them in later… Harry Potter here, has something to tell you all.”
”He doesn’t want to talk to you!” Pansy’s shrill voice echoes in the Hall behind him as he turns around and walks out.
Harry waits outside the Potions Classroom with the rest of the Slytherins until the Gryffindors have all disappeared round the corner of the dungeon corridor, before approaching the hidden entrance to the Slytherin Common Room. Then hurrying to their dorms, they deposit their book bags and grab their cloaks and hats, before heading up to the Entrance Hall, where the four Heads of Houses are waiting for them.
”Master, I crave your pardon”, he croaks, without lifting his head.
She called him extremely dangerous”, Harry exclaims, heart thumping excitedly in his chest as anger and adrenaline begins to rush through him once more. ”And she said he isn’t even human!”
