of the penises currently in his office, as it was striped in red and blue and looked more fake than any but Sparklepenis. Harry stared at it, unwilling to touch it, waiting for the trick.
when I didn’t receive a response in twelve to fourteen business days I immediately submitted form 129-Q.”
“But you’re not the one filling it out, are you?” Malfoy said, snatching the stack of papers right out of Harry’s hands. “What the fuck did you do to this?”
Then again, all of Harry’s friends were arseholes. Maybe it made a strange sort of sense that Malfoy should eventually join them. Although, when Harry’d thought to himself he needed new friends, this wasn’t quite what he had in mind.
“Is that entirely necessary?” he demanded as Malfoy hummed thoughtfully and stroked the shaft again.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Hermione wiped her eyes and took a breath, looking distinctly not-sorry. "How long did you have to wait at the groomers?"
At the sound of his voice, the flowers rustled ominously. Harry clenched his jaw and stared resolutely at the ceiling. The witch with the Venomous Tentacula peered curiously at the bouquet, but Harry didn’t make eye contact, and she exited the lift before she could ask him about it.
His half-panicked brain took that last thought and ran with it; his hands opened, the smoldering box dropped to the ground and, to Harry’s horror, the penis flopped out, a bright jet of sparks still shooting from the tip. Then there was screaming and confusion as everyone tried to put as much distance between themselves and the sparking penis as they could in the confines of the lift. One particularly brave woman kept her head about her and doused the burning box with a firm Aguamenti. The penis twitched when the cold water spreading across the floor touched it, flopping over to shoot sparks in the opposite direction, and there was more chaos as everyone scrambled to get out of its path.
The four of them just shrugged, “it’s his name, he wanted to be known as Voldemort to get rid of his muggle father’s name. So we use that name.”
“Sirius, Remus, Cissa, you guys,” Harry said. Draco nodded. “Oh,” he said turning to Draco, “McGonagall as well.”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, he smiled, leaning into Draco’s hand. Draco nodded, his eyes sincere. “I think I know what you mean. Do you think Sirius and Remus will be upset if we move out?”
‟I would still marry you if you didn´t have a penny to your name,” Draco tells him seriously, ‟I don´t care about your fame, and don´t need your money.”
He sat down at his desk, grabbing the letters he had gotten and begun reading them, formulating replies. He wrote a letter to Narcissa as well, they had started corresponding more after he had asked if she would mind it if he had a snake. He was happy about it, it was fun talking to her as she would talk about all kinds of things Draco had done as a child. Every once in a while he looked over to Draco. He was reading every letter he had received, writing replies as well.  Harry wrote another letter to Molly, asking her to forgive him for not telling her in person first, and hoping she could accept them. After he finished, he turned to Draco.
When they entered Harry’s room Draco was sitting on Harry’s bed while Sirius was spinning around on Harry’s desk chair. The moment the two men walked into the room, Draco stood striding over to Remus. “Professor Lupin,” Draco said, “I wanted to say how sorry I am for how I acted in third year. I blindly believed my father and his ideology, not thinking for my self. I can’t express how sorry I am, and I hope I can make it up to you.” Remus looked over at Harry and Sirius, both looking at Draco with a bewildered expression. “I am also really glad I can stay here for a few days.”
Harry looked around him, seeing no one around he gave Draco a quick peck on the lips, “they said they would love to come with us. Told me to tell everyone of their cute nose if that would help.” He looked back at the snake fondly, seeing them watch him and Draco. They went up in the store. “I want to ask the owner what kind of snake they are. And ask them if they could maybe hold off on selling them till next week Friday at the most.” He smiled.
‟Yeah,” Harry mumbles, ‟I´m not feeling well, so I´m going to go take a nap,” he walks away quickly, off to the eight-year common room. When he´s sure Ron and Hermione aren´t following him, he takes another turn, off to the seventh-floor corridor.
“I think it was love that saved me.” The answer was vague, he knew that, and the two of them looked at him as if he had grown a second head.
“Though,” Draco said, “how can you expect me to say anything against you living here, when you told me you wished you could. And I promised him,” he told Remus, “that we could do anything he wants after the war, and if he wants to live here he can, not that he needs my permission, though.”
“Oh, Remus, remember when Harry was like one year old, and he was hissing at this stuffed snake he had?” Sirius said, “was that Parsletongue? Was he speaking at the animal, but did we just think he was hissing?”
“Indeed, however, I do not think he made seven. I think he intended to make six, he wanted seven pieces, which meant that one piece would stay inside his body.”
Harry stepped behind Draco, his tie slinging around his neck and wearing his waistcoat. He looked in the mirror to his hear, sighing. “You going to help with this mess?” he asked. Draco handed him a box before moving to stand behind Harry. “What’s this?” he asked.
Harry did as the letter read, and after a week of Harry telling them how dangerous it was to stay, they decided that leaving was the best option. They would be taken into a protective detail of the Order. They would be taken to the safe house a few minutes before Harry would be taken to Grimmauld place.
Harry looked at him with his mouth hanging open. “You are going to let him kill you?” Harry asked. Both older men looked at him while Draco was looking at Dumbledore in quite the same way Harry was.
“Nah,” Dean said, “sure, they’ll be hurt you didn’t tell them, but they’ll get over it.” The group had arrived in Hogsmeade, “this is us,” Dean said, pointing at the three broomsticks, “have fun you two!” he called after them.
‟Harry, you gotta wake up love,” Harry blinks his eyes open lazily. The world is blurry, and it takes some time for him to realise it´s because someone took his glasses.
When everyone sat down the food appeared on the table, Lucien standing behind Harry and Draco. “Thank you, Lucien,” Draco said, the elf bowing and disappearing. “Well,” Draco said grabbing the glass of wine, “thank you all for coming and I hope it tastes well.” He raised his glass the others following.
‟At least there´s some truth to it,” Draco says, ‟she could´ve said something about you setting the trend of wearing rings and me following it. Or something just as ludicrous.” Harry nods.
With a venue in mind, the four of them started to plan. Harry and Draco even helped to plan their honeymoon, which they would be spending in a small house the black family owned not far from the chapel-like venue.
“I actually have a thought about how to open it,” Harry said. “But I think that there will be enough spells to kill us all if we do it without the sword ready to give the final blow.”
The door was next to the fireplace, showing a spiralling staircase. They stepped into a large circular room, the light bright inside it. There was a bench in the middle, where scraps of random materials were present. Though the scraps were all neatly placed, showing the room to be clean. Harry looked around, trying to figure out what his father had done here, but he only concluded that it indeed had been a workroom.
She paused, “though there are many smiling faces here with us today, I can’t help but remember those who should have been here with us. Those who died during the war, who fought so bravely.” She paused again giving people time to remember their loved ones.
Harry drops the fork laughing. He climbs out of their bed casting a quick cleaning charm on his clothes before putting them on again. ‟Come one,” Harry says, ‟I´ll show you how to make scrambled eggs.”
‟It´s mine,” she says pushing open the gate. Harry and Draco follow inside into the garden. ‟And you´re right by saying no one's lived here in over a decade.”
When he walked there he met Slughorn and Sprout, they were talking about some plant, Harry did not really care, but when Slughorn was alone he felt the need to reveal himself, so he did, pulling off the cloak and calling out for the Professor. They talked for a while, and when Harry mentioned that he was going to visit Hagrid to bury his acromantula, Slughorn decided that he would come with Harry, but he would bring a bottle of some. So the professor bound back to the castle, and Harry went down to Hagrid’s house, who was very happy to see him.
“Morning,” Draco said, his hand cupping Harry’s cheek. “You are doing an awful lot of thinking so early in the morning.” He kissed Harry lightly.
“Well,” Harry said, “there was a war going on and no one really accepted that Draco was even an actual part of the order. We didn’t want to shake things up too much to tell you guys as well. Sirius and Remus knew.” Harry shrugged, “and we didn’t feel it was necessary.” Bill nodded in understanding. “Also the fact that your wedding was the day after, and that was more important.”
‟Purple?” Harry says later, ‟can´t believe not only the rooms will be either Hogwarts colours or gender colours. Purple and white are the only colours left.”
“It’s okay,” Harry said, “I can do tomorrow,” he paused looking at the kitchen door, “will it also be about the forest?” he asked, he knew he sounded cryptic, but he didn’t want to outright say it. The minister nodded, “then I think Draco should be there as well. He actually knew and helped with the mission Ron Hermione and I were, on so he should be there regardless.”
“Maybe,” Draco turned on his side to look at Harry, “I’ll have to talk to Hermione first.” Harry nodded. “It might be a nice side project,” Draco wondered out loud, “the classes are becoming a bit boring with all the revising.”
She talks to Draco, she takes some effort in getting to know him, and see who he really is. It took some work, but she has accepted Draco. It was a relief to him, which shocked him, because since when did he need the approval of a Weasley. Though, one look at Harry, and how happy he looked to see her back in his life, tells him why.
“I never thought of it like that,” Narcissa said, standing next to her son, “that does sound much better than purity will always conquer.” She grabbed the case lifting it from the mantle. “Do you know what this is Harry?” she asked.
“You know,” Remus said, “you three are not subtle, at all.” He laughed lightly, “it’s a wonder no one has figured you two out already. But, as it is the last night Draco is here, why don’t you two go do something fun, Sirius and I can finish cleaning up.”
“That’s the original Order of the Phoenix, I don’t know all of them, but you can see Sirius and Remus there, with my mum and dad,” he looked at the group of them, resentful at the small man standing next to them, “and Peter Pettigrew, the fucker, is also there. Don’t know if you recognise them,” he said pointing at a man and a woman standing proud, they’re Neville’s parents. They were tortured by Bellatrix after Voldemort fell the first time. They don’t recognise him anymore.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, “but you should know that what your brother did was brave. I will tell you the impact, how important it was when I can. After he is dead.” Sirius just nodded.
They took no time before they arrived in their room. With it being on the top floor, they had to climb some stairs, and Harry had to hold back to not push Draco against the walls they passed. Especially with Draco walking up the stairs before him, hips swaying lightly.
“Who is that?” Draco asked. Walking closer, as if he was inspecting a wounded animal. Though Harry knew he recognised him.
“No, I think Kreacher was right,” Hermione said, “we need to open it before it can be destroyed.” She grabbed a book from her bag. “But we still don’t even know how to destroy it.”
“Every word,” he said, “I still want to ask Cissa if she knows a way I could keep it, but if she doesn’t then we aren’t going to risk your family. Then I’d merge our families and take your name, no doubt in my mind.”
“My turn?” he said looking at the three of them, they all nodded. “Okay then.” He did what he was told, causing a blood-like substance to pour from it. Though the object did not fight as the diary or the locket did, it did give out a wailing sound.
“In our defence,” Harry said, “everyone was out of the house, and Kingsley hadn’t told anyone he’d be coming to the house. But well, we were on the couch in front of the fireplace he came out off.”
Astoria scowls, ‟there are enough options that don´t involve me getting pregnant,” she shakes her head, ‟besides, if Narcissa Malfoy accepts her son getting married to another man, then she doesn´t care about bloodlines anymore.” Astoria tilts her head, ‟though I guess she and my parents could come to an arrangement about me possibly carrying your child.” She lights up, ‟that could solve both problems in one swoop.”
They walked in silence, they sat on the floor by the lake, using the cloak as a makeshift blanket. They sat next to each other, Harry still leaning on Ron.
This Malfoy answered as well, “He doesn’t think I will be able, that is why I got the mission. Then he has a reason to kill my mother and I.” He looked up from his persistent stare on the floor, locking eyes with the potion master once again. “Please, don’t let him make me kill Dumbledore, don’t let him kill my mother.”
They ended up in a small lake, it was cold out, and part of the lake was frozen. The Patronus disappeared into the water. “It’s here,” he said, “down there.”
He doesn´t dare look at them when he says it, instead, he looks at his hands. He sees the ring and smiles again. ‟It´s Malfoy.”
‟We didn´t either,” Harry says rubbing the back of his neck, ‟it has something to do with the compatibility of our magic?”
Harry and Draco go on daily walks with Scorpius after two weeks. The people around the town fawn over him as well, asking his name and making small talk. Jen drives herself, Theo and Leo, down to Everton the same day most of their friends are over. They´re in the park, which is a plus because it´d be a hassle to remove all the magical things.
“Dumbledore is dead,” Harry said. The whole room fell silent again. It seemed only Ginny knew. People slumped down into the chairs they had stood up from.
Draco pauses, his back straightens, “I can’t keep running away because your friends are coming over. I can’t just leave my own home for them. I can´t stop living my life because you won´t tell them.”
“Did you forget you are the heir to the Potter family again?” Draco said jokingly. “Love, have you ever really looked into your vault?”
“Is this the time?” Harry asked, when nothing happened but them gripping each other tighter Harry raised his voice, “Oi! There’s a war going on outside!”
The two of them chased their impending orgasm, Harry grabbing hold of Draco’s shoulder with one hand, the other one travelled down to his own leaking cock, moving up and down in time with his movement on Draco’s cock.
She handed the Malfoy family Sceptre to Blaise and the Potter family nair temple sword to Ron. Both stepped towards the two, the sceptre was placed over Harry’s forearms and into Draco’s palms, the nair temple sword over Draco’s forearms and into Harry’s palms.
Narcissa nodded, “let’s go then,” she motioned the boys and the house-elf to the drawing-room, stepping through the floo first. Harry and Draco following her, Pihu apparating there the moment Harry stepped in.
It’s just after dinner when there’s an owl tapping on the window of the common room. Harry opens it finding a reply from Narcissa attached. He gives the owl a pet and opens the letter.
Harry turned on his side, looking at Draco. “I never expected to have so many people I care about. Never expected that I’d be buying over 20 presents for people. All of them caring for me.” Draco mirrored his position looking at Harry. “It’s nice, having so many people I care about. It was just me before I was eleven. And then my whole world changed, and now there are so many people.”
“That nice,” Draco said, “they did have awesome products, even let me in when I wasn’t even part of the order yet.” He looked through the other scrolls grabbing another, “this one would be the properties.”
They all go to the dining room, thinking it was the best place to eat. The closer they get the more the smell entices them. They round the corner to see the table set, with dishes on top of it. “Master Harry,” Pihu says, standing in front of the room, “I made lunch.”
“With this taken care of, should we go look for your mother?” Draco nodded, and took Harry’s hand again, moving towards the quarters of the Lord or Lady of the house.
Remus looked over at the boy, and saw that his eyes were completely sincere, and held out his hand for the boy, which he took gladly. “You are forgiven Draco.” He looked over at Sirius, who motioned for the two to come in and close the door. When he did Sirius put a silencing spell around them, making sure that no one would be able to listen to whatever was happening in the room.
But not only that, but the exams were coming up, and though Harry knew the Exam wouldn’t go on. No one would expect students to take an exam while their headmaster was dead. He still had to study for them. Especially when they were taught things that Harry thought he could use next year. Hermione was pleasantly surprised with his focus more on school, proud that he finally worked hard.
‟I,” Draco falters, ‟we both wanted kids, and yeah, it´s soon, but he already has a godson, who´s being raised by his grandmother. So, he was already kind of a father, so it wasn´t a big leap for him. I want a kid, and I don´t care how it might look.”
“Did you get one from mum?” he asked Harry, who shook his head. “Nope,” he looked through the letters, “though the twins did send me a letter. Though Fred already knew.”
“So,” he concluded, “those are the people that I know that are in the Order. There are more than that, but those are the ones I actually know about.” Harry wanted to ask about the death eaters Malfoy knew, but he felt he should wait a bit before bringing that up, maybe do that tomorrow instead of tonight. They needed to form a bond first.
They went to Draco’s room, he saw that Darsh’ terrarium was already placed on his bureau. Harry walked in behind him, sitting down on the chair looking at Darsh. “You okay?” he asked, sitting down at the desk. Harry shook his head. “How can I help?” he asked.
The three were rounded up, with a sickening feeling Harry recognised one of the snatchers. It was Fenrir Greyback, the scum that had killed a little boy and had turned Remus when he was a kid. The group identified themselves with fake names and they were brought to two others that had been caught by them.
Harry stopped in his tracks, causing Draco to stop as well. Hermione and Ron looked up, seeing Harry.
‟Yeah, next week we´ll visit Queenstown,” Draco says, ‟and the week after Everton. They´re the closest without any need for apparition. We´ll see if we like them, and if not we´ll have to start looking a bit further. But McGonagall will be escorting us.”
“No,” Draco said, “the title is given to someone. Either by right of birth, through marriage, or through appointment to the House of Lord’s and Lady’s.”
The two house-elves left them alone when the three of them had taken their seat. “They call you both master,” Narcissa noticed, “even though both only are loyal to one of you.” She nodded at them, “that is not something that is common,” she clarified, “usually that only happens after a revealing ceremony, and even then the elves are only needed to call the head of the family master.”
‟If you want it, it´s yours,” she says. ‟I haven´t been here since my husband died, and I won't ever live here. I´d rather have people I know, that will love this house as much as we did, than no one living here.”
Harry received many gifts, though only a few were of actual use. Though his gift from Molly and Arthur had moved him, as they were usually given only to family members. The fact that it was a family heirloom touched him even more.
“He stole Morfin’s wand, killed the Muggles, and brought the wand back, taking the ring with him.” Harry opened his mouth, but Dumbledore continued, “we need to move to the next memory,”
“Professor,” Harry started, “Do you remember, when, at the start of term you said that I had to look out for my friends, but also think about other people? I did what you said.” Harry sat across from the professor, wringing his hands on his lap. “I think, I found a way to help Draco Malfoy become a spy for us. I am certain that he is part of Voldemort’s army, but I overheard something, that made me see that he did not want to be. That he was scared, because there was no one to protect him. And The order can help him, we can help him.” Harry looked at the man before him, he looked curious.
“I did,” Ron said, “you won't believe what they said,” he paused taking a quick look around the board before making a move Harry forgot was even possible. “They said they had wanted to ask me if I would want to lead that! Ask me!” Harry smiled, “I thought I was going to have to beg them for even just a job there.”
Draco shrugged, “I won’t be able to hide them forever. Besides, they showed theirs, I might as well show them mine.” He rolled up his sleeve, showing the place where the dark mark was clearly visible. The black bright on Draco’s arm. The group sucked in a breath, though it wasn’t much for the mark itself, but for the scars littering around it. “I tried everything to get it off my arm,” he explained, “turns out that whatever you try won’t help.” Harry pulled Draco into his side. Draco rolled his eyes.
Lucius nods, a small smile on his face, ‟as long as I get to see my grandson.” He gives Harry another long look, before turning to Draco, ‟I want what´s best for you, nothing more.”
He knew Draco must be doing the same, though he was much more discrete. Harry saw Hermione’s eyes widen when she saw the ring. Ron and Ginny were gaping at him. He stood, no longer wanting to stay. Not wanting to wait till the two went on moving. “I’m going to adopt my snake now,” he said.
Draco smiles at Teddy, who´s currently sitting comfortably on Draco´s lap. Harry reaches out ruffling Teddy´s hair. The boy looks up with bright green eyes. ‟Oh,” Harry says softly, his hand softly brushing Teddy´s cheek. ‟You´re very cute like that Teddy,” Harry tells him.
“The password is now abstinence,” McGonagall said in lieu of hello, the group thanked her and walked towards the tower. On their way over they met Hermione, who had arrived a little earlier.
Harry turned around, leaning against his desk. He looked at her. “Do you know what a marriage bond really means?” he asks, she hesitated, never happy to show she didn't know something but shook her head. “When you are bonded with the one you love, you are connected with your mind and your magic.” He paused, trying to remember how Draco explained it, “you can feel each other's feelings in the back of your mind, and you can feel each other’s magic in your core.” She looked up surprised.
It felt like weeks before Harry heard something from Draco, even though it had only been a few days. It was mostly their change in routine, that had made Harry feel like it had been such a long time.
“Well,” Draco said, “I kind of asked him to do that when I was a kid, and now every time I’m gone he takes care of the stuff I own. And I can take them by summoning, but no one else.” He paused, “when I was a kid he did it because he thought it was funny, but now it’s more because of the death eaters. Because I ordered him to never let my stuff go, or move away from what I own until I order him different. And well, that meant he only came when I ordered him to, not with just me calling him.”
Harry nods, ‟the door should also be repainted, but I thought we could keep it blue. I kind of like that.” Draco nods, ‟we should ask Andromeda to help with Teddy´s room, she knows the most about him.”
“No, no, I, uh,” he seemed embarrassed by what he wanted to say, “it’s just, I didn’t want our first real date to end with us having sticky pants again.”
“The last one then,” Harry concluded, to which Pansy just laughed. The two girls they were talking about came over to them, Luna plopping herself down on Pansy’s lap. Ginny taking the arm off the couch they were sitting on. “I think that’s my cue,” Harry said, moving away from the three of them.
,” the snake said. Causing Harry to laugh, he uncurled himself on the palm of Harry’s hand, moving up Harry’s arm, moving up to his shoulder. Harry felt the snake move to his shoulder, curling around his neck.
Draco nodded, looking at Harry. “You can try,” Sirius said, “but ask yourself, what are you ready to lose? You should talk to your mother,” he said, “she might have other thoughts than we do. Who knows, maybe she’s heard another way?”
“Hey,” Harry said cupping Draco’s cheek to make him look him in the eyes, “that’s not on you. You didn’t do anything but find a way to survive. And even then, all was done under the orders of Dumbledore, he wanted it to happen like that. They’ll forgive you because they know that you aren’t a bad person. I don’t think they’ll be mad,” he adds hastily, “they don’t have a reason to be.”
“The last time we made out on this couch,” Draco said, his breath hitching when Harry’s mouth moved over his pulse point, “the minister for magic walked in on us.”
“Yes,” McGonagall said, “do sit down, both of you.” She turned to Remus, “you got anything for them? That was a powerful display of magic, they need to eat something with sugar in it.”
“So,” Sirius started, “today we're going to continue what we were doing last week. Just recount the transfigurations you have all done before. Try them till you succeed, move on to the next.” He looked around the room to see the others doing as he said. People were speaking loudly, others just practising their spells.
‟It seems to fit you both very well,” she says with a smile once they´re in the dining room, steaming plates of pasta in front of them. ‟And did you really make this Draco?”
Around 9 the team went back to the common room, it gave harry enough time to just look through some of his homework. He would have to do some of it when he came back from his meeting with Malfoy. He could not afford to fail this year, though he had a feeling that the end of the year would be a little more hectic than anyone would expect now.
Malfoy was looking annoyed when he walked into the exam room, but his face positively lit up when he saw Harry waiting for him. "Oh, wonderful! I was just thinking I needed to see another dick today."
"I…. But…. She…. No. You. I know what you're doing. You're trying to distract me." Harry shoved the cock back in Malfoy's face, ignoring the frantically awkward expression he saw there. "You
Ginny came to the table a bit later, bringing with her a fresh round of pints. She slipped into the seat beside Harry and greeted him with a quick bump of her shoulder against his. “How’s life in Apparition treating you so far?” she asked, nudging one of the pint glasses over to him.
Rosemary smirked. "Yes. Yes I have. It was sitting tall and proud on your desk for several hours this afternoon."
He blushed. Because joking about a disembodied cock with Ron and Seamus was one thing, but discussing the particulars with
be all those things. He'd seen it. But she also terrorized the floor with her charts and schedules and
And indeed it was a bloke; the evidence was lying right smack in the middle of the Apparition Point.
Harry watched as they made their way down the long aisle between Auror cubicles and then slipped between the massive doors that led into the briefing room. As much as he wanted to find joy in Rosemary getting dragged into whatever was happening over there—at least as much glee as she'd shown in sending him to fetch the fake cock—he couldn't quite manage it. Getting called out by name was never a good sign when it came to situations like this. And if the situation was spilling over into Apparition, there was a chance Harry himself might be at risk for getting pulled in. He turned away and headed to the kitchenette to get a kettle going for when Rosemary returned.
Harry found himself wishing he could take a holiday of his own when he got back to the office that afternoon and discovered that someone had been by in his absence. They’d taken the replica of Harry’s cock and stuck it to the seat of his chair with a Sticking Charm that Harry spent a good ten minutes trying to unravel before he sighed in defeat and tossed his wand aside, resolved to just grab a chair from the small guest seating area near Rosemary's desk.
Another glimmer. Harry looked back at his drink and, yes, those were ripples. What the hell was shaking it? Harry hadn’t bumped the desk, he was sure of it this time. Moving slowly and carefully, he sat back in his chair. Barely a minute later came another ripple and… a brief buzzing sound?
It lay quiet and passive, no buzzing, no sparking, and Harry could feel his dread growing by the minute.
With that, Malfoy tipped the penis out of the Receptacle, and leaned forward, examining it closely. Very closely.
Harry clutched his box a little bit tighter—he had a brief and mildly horrifying vision of what might happen if he dropped it and its contents flopped out onto the floor in front of everyone—and joined the end of the queue.
“Hm,” Harry said. “Maybe I could hold it in front of my face. That’d probably make the picture worthless, wouldn’t it? If they couldn’t tell it was me.”
“It’s cocks, Potter. Fake cocks,” Pansy said, tapping her fingernails on the tabletop. “And I’ve already bought you a pint. You owe me.”
"Take the box. I'll sort out a more formal briefing once you've had a chance to compare the two… items."
He tucked the paper into one of the evidence envelopes he’d brought with him and rifled through the stack of paperwork until he found a Request for Magical Analysis. He clipped that to the open envelope to send off later, then turned his attention to the instruction card.
On the fourth floor, Harry was directed to exam room 9. He set the vase of flowers on the counter, considered unloading the cock from it, but figured what the hell. He sort of wanted to see the expressions Malfoy’s face would make if he had to do it himself.
Of course, when Seamus made the connection, he announced it loudly. In front of Ron. Who looked liked the Christmas Train of Piss Taking had arrived early.
"Much better after a pint in me, thanks. I still can't believe any of them will be in any shape to pass their Apparition Exam next month, but I'm surviving them at least."
It was a relief when Malfoy took off his gloves and glowered at it. "All right, Potter. It's all yours."
“Possibly because I am,” Harry said, letting his head thud against the back of the chair. “This case is cursed. That’s the only explanation.”
He couldn’t look at the people around him. Instead he stripped off his outer robes—the Standard Auror Safety Spells with which they were charmed would prevent them from catching fire—and flung them down over the penis, bundled it up inside them, and frantically jabbed the door open button.
“Not to worry,” Malfoy said, setting the cock aside. He pulled open a drawer and produced a fresh copy of the paperwork. “I’ve got it here.”
At that point Harry was rescued by Malfoy sliding into the seat beside Pansy, and Harry’s irritation with her was swept away in a wave of gratitude for the timeliness of his appearance. Then Harry realized he was feeling
Ron cleared his throat pointedly. “Not the time, Hermione,” he murmured, making a shoddy attempt to use a cough to disguise his words.
Together, they lingered near the doorway and watched the bustle for a few minutes. Harry was just about to go back to his office when a red-faced young Auror came running over.
Harry shrugged, placing the cock on the shelf and then crossed to his desk, closing the folder in what he hoped was a casual fashion. "I don't know who'd want any of these."
“I’m keeping them, by the way,” Malfoy went on. “Just so you know.” He looked Harry up and down and a slow smirk tugged at his mouth. “I mean, a handsome bloke brings me flowers at work, it’d be rude not to accept them.”
“Regarding item B-5 for case number 187-245-M-72 submitted for Magical Analysis nearly two months ago via request 7258-12,” Harry said. He’d written the bloody numbers so many times in the past few days that he could probably rattle it off in his sleep.
The only cloud on the horizon was large and penis-shaped. Because he had to at least make his search for whoever sent Bartram the Vicious Cockmonster seem convincing.
A muscle in Kingsley's jaw twitched, and he cleared his throat. "And as we've an Auror already familiar with the…items in question due to his current assignment in the Apparition Department, we are turning over this case to him."
“Yeah, all right,” Harry said. He lingered for a moment, looking around his blessedly cock-free cubicle, then followed Ron down the hall, feeling better than he had in a long time. Aside from his arsehole friends and a new boyfriend who apparently thought that eighteen fake cocks was an acceptable way to woo someone, Harry’s life was entirely back to normal.
And if Harry didn't make it before Ron's pot was gone, he'd probably be stuck with the stuff that Robards brewed. Rumor had it he used water straight from the Thames. It certainly tasted like it. Harry's stomach rolled at the very thought.
Still, no matter the reason for it, Harry had to repeatedly suffer through watching Malfoy’s long fingers wrap around cock after cock and wank them firmly. He tried and failed to avert his gaze as Malfoy stroked, frowned, and stroked some more.
“Oh,” said Harry, anticipating a long and awkward visit as Healer Reynolds poked and prodded and filled out the mountain of forms.
“—for Acute Preservation of Accidentally Splinched Specimens. Yes, Potter, I am familiar with it,” Malfoy cut in. He flicked his wand again and the specimen rose neatly from its packaging, hovering in midair. He blinked at the box, and reached out to close the lid. “Why are there holes in this?”
Malfoy waved him off, his quill skritching quickly across the papers spread over the table before him.
He’d only been waiting in the exam room for a minute or so when Malfoy slammed in, looking tired and grouchy. His cheeks and nose were pink with sunburn.
He took the lift up to the fourth floor, sharing the ride with a young lady who had large bunches of broccoli sprouting from her ears. They exchanged awkward smiles when the doors opened, and Harry gestured for her to go first. He let her approach the desk before him since she was suffering actual spell damage whilst he just had a cock in a box, and while the Mediwitch tried to explain to her that she needed to fill out paperwork before she could be seen by a Healer and the young witch asked "What?" a lot and cupped her palm round the green florets blocking her ears, Harry stared idly around.
Malfoy gave him a flat look. “That is what the Containment Receptacles are for, aren’t they? Containing specimens?”
Harry held out the stack of parchment as Malfoy carefully deposited it back in the box. "68-J? It's not a Splinching."
Harry blinked down at the box in his hands, then the door to the tearoom. Rosemary sighed. "Honestly." She flicked her wand, and his box sailed out of his hands and through an open doorway on the other side of the department. "Tearoom. Three sugars and a splash of milk. Get your head together, we can have a gossip, and I can catch you up for your class tonight."
But before she could continue, there was an apologetic tap on the lintel. "Sorry, but Harry, you need to get that form signed off before Kingsley starts asking questions."
Reluctantly, Harry did as he was told and took the box. His hands left smudgy fingerprints on the glossy lacquered surface as he tucked it securely beneath his arm. Rosemary was giving him a desperate sort of look, and Harry gave her a small shrug in sympathy as he turned his back and made good his escape.
Harry pulled back. "Flowers are a reasonable present to send to someone you fancy. Booze. Tickets to Quidditch."
Hermione sighed. “Well. We can talk later, I suppose,” she said with a nod to Harry. And yes, they’d definitely be having words later if Harry had his way about it. “I’d best get these to where they’re supposed to be.” She gave Harry a purposeful smile. “Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll take care of everything. You needn’t worry about this case for another second.”
Harry heaved another sigh, and Hermione came around his desk and gave him a quick hug. "Have fun with your cocks. Good luck at St Mungo's. I'll see you at the pub this evening."
“I am jealous. Incredibly jealous,” Harry said. Inside the box, the cock stopped buzzing. That made him nervous. “Well. Best get this back to the office. Enjoy your holiday. And, er, sorry about the tea.”
He pulled out his paperwork and began to copy down the details of his case so far. Ignoring the cocks on his desk went mostly okay. Sometimes he'd catch movement out of the corner of his eye. The big one throbbed from time to time, and the smaller one sometimes shivered eagerly. Harry angled his chair away from them, fixed his gaze firmly on his papers, and did his best to pretend there weren't two very erect penises sitting on his desk.
“Well,” Harry said slowly after a few long seconds. He took a deep breath. “I figured we’ve reached the flowers stage of our relationship. Maybe in a few more cocks I’ll buy you a drink next pub night.”
It was a mistake, encouraging her. Harry really should have known better. Did know better, in fact, but if an enormous fake cock wasn’t an excuse for his temporary lapse in judgment, Harry didn’t know what would be.
"Deal." Pansy raised her hand above her head, snapping until the barkeep rolled his eyes and sent a pint her way. She slid it across the table in his direction before leaning forward until his vision was filled with her face and cleavage, and grinned at him. "Spill."
Harry sighed and tossed the file back onto the desk. “Are you doing anything useful here or are you just bothering me?”
Ron snickered into his pint glass, and Harry aimed a kick at his shin under the table, missed, and hit the table leg instead. Which, really, he should’ve expected that. It was pretty much how his entire day had gone.
“Bartram,” Hermione muttered angrily, pitching the cock in her hand into the box with more force than strictly necessary. Which, if she was going to toss around cocks, at least she’d picked the one most likely to enjoy it. Harry could see BDSM cock’s excited twitching from across the cubicle.
“Knew it was only a matter of time,” Malfoy said, glancing up at Harry. “As you said, you’re bringing me cocks several times a week. I knew I’d wear you down eventually.”
“It’s just sensitive, I think.” Come to think of it, the previous cock had perked up a bit more than Harry expected when he touched it to transfer it from the Containment Receptacle to the end of the growing line-up decorating his desk.
"No, I can't spoil it for you." Rosemary rubbed her hands together in glee. "Everyone should get to have their first experience with Mrs Periweather unsullied by expectations."
Mrs Periweather glared at him and sniffed, cuddling Persimmon closer before turning back to Li. Harry pointed at a Receptacle and waved at Rosemary before snatching it and ducking back out.
Hermione burst into laughter at that, and Harry threw a napkin at her. "I hate all of you. I'm never buying you birthday presents ever again."
"Well, not when you put it like that." Harry coughed, imagining mountains of sex toys: vibrators and strap ons and plugs and beads and needing to bring them all to Malfoy. He did a twitch of his own at that. "But gotta show a strong face when someone sends
“You,” he said faintly. “You do realize that the purpose of bringing it to me to examine is to ensure that it doesn’t actually belong to anyone, right?”
Though that might’ve been the amount of bickering they did. Honestly, at this point in his life Harry wasn’t sure he knew how to have any sort of relationship with another person that
The biggest lead he had to work with was this new cock. The only way Harry could think of to explain that level of accuracy was the use of polyjuice. Someone had snagged a hair of his, mixed it up with polyjuice, and… gone about it from there. (Harry was sure there were some very complex and sophisticated steps involved in duplicating his penis, and he was perfectly happy not thinking about any of them in any great detail.) Unfortunately, none of the ingredients used to brew polyjuice were regulated by the Ministry, and most of them were very commonly used in other potions as well. Which didn’t bode well for that avenue of investigation, but there was still only one Harry Potter. Which meant Harry had a starting point. He inked his quill and began a list of all the places he’d visited in recent memory.
"Fine. I'll summarize." Kingsley gave Harry a flat stare. "Your stunt last night leads me to believe you need to reacquaint yourself with Section 12C-2 of the Auror Code. I’m transferring you to Apparition, effective immediately, where you will remain until you've administered the Hogwarts Apparition Exam in May. You will also be taking over the classes. Thursdays after dinner."
"What," he said, blinking at the cocks, eyes darting helplessly from one to the other and back again. "What the hell."
"Afraid so." Malfoy looked positively gleeful. "Terribly sorry, really," he continued, sounding about as not-sorry as Harry had ever heard him. "Unless, of course, you're doing this yourself. These are all looking rather similar. I wonder if a
“If you want to be technical about it, then yes, I’m only talking to you because I’m the Healer on duty up here and it’s my job to deal with you,” Malfoy said loftily, then smirked. “But more often than not it does turn out to be the best and most exciting part of my day, frightening as that may be.”
“I’m telling you,” said the wizard blandly, “that we’ll contact you when we have more information regarding your request.”
Malfoy snorted but didn’t elaborate. Probably for the best, that way. They’d been having a relatively nice conversation. Civil. Friendly, even. Malfoy’s dry tone had edged dangerously close to teasing at one point.
Harry backed quickly out of his cubicle, but it was too late. Sixteen cocks perked up, the hat flew off his chair from the force of his cock's sproinging; Vindaloo vibrated hard enough that the specimen jar holding the creepily clingy CopyCock nearly toppled off the shelf, Sparklepenis started shooting sparks five feet in the air, the new penis, which Harry
Harry said nothing, as he eyed the shadowed specimen jar closely. He simply opened the Containment Receptacle and tilted it toward Seamus.
"Because wishing for something better to come along is like that Chinese Curse. The one about living in interesting times? And I don't want to deal with anything more interesting than Tuesday."
Harry was increasingly suspicious that Malfoy was fucking with him. “I am most certainly not inclined,” he snapped.
"Careful, Potter." Malfoy's voice still managed to sound arsey, even as he gasped for breath. "I understand it may have been a while since you handled a real live cock and not a toy, but you can do me actual damage if you squeeze too hard."
Harry glanced between Dean, who gave him an innocent expression, and Pansy, who looked ready to eat him alive. "Has Malfoy been—"
Harry dropped the forms and, more carefully, the shoebox on the exam table and shoved his hands in his pockets, wondering how long Malfoy would make him wait.
Harry grinned, and Malfoy's gaze sharpened. His fingers were back, working on the line of closures running the length of the front of Harry's robes, keeping up a steady stream of muttered complaints; "don't know why I even bothered with you," and, "all you do is stop halfway through," and "fucking Gryffindors."
He spent his walk through St Mungo's feeling rather grateful this call came in late enough to head immediately to the pub after.
Harry’s hangover tapped out a staccato pulsing against the inside of his skull to match the sharp clink of silver on porcelain. “They’ve decided to stick me in Apparition for a while. It’s supposed to teach me a healthy respect for the rules or some rubbish like that, I think. Kingsley was too busy giving me stern looks to really explain his reasoning.”
This cock was at 10 Downing Street. Charmed to the fucking front door. Apparently they were moving on to Muggle political statements. Harry was so entirely done with all of this.
Malfoy, flushed and gasping. His hair was a mess and his lips were cherry red and swollen. Harry rocked his hips forward, his hard cock rubbing against an answering hardness, and there was a thump as Malfoy's eyes drooped and his head dropped back against the wall.
“Right,” Harry said, casting a quick spell to dry himself off before taking up the proffered items. “Thanks.”
“Bugger,” Harry muttered when he saw that his lamb vindaloo had leaked on the inside of the bag and the newest cock was now smudged with sauce.
Then he tucked the box securely beneath his arm once more, picked up the stack of parchment by the corner, and Apparated to St Mungo’s.
Rosemary did not, in fact, believe that skipping form 68-J would go over at all with, as she put it, the ‘twats down in Filing’ and handed over the familiar stack of parchment. "I don't see what your problem is, it's not like
Peter the Penis. The Vicious Cockmonster. Harvey Porter. Willy the Weiner. BDSM Cock. Vindaloo. Sparklepenis. And a note charmed to the frame indicating all the room on the 'Bottom Half of the board for More Cock!!'
And in any case, Harry figured that as a Healer, Malfoy had probably put his hands on far worse than penis paper. “Right,” he said. “Carry on.”
Rosemary shooed him off with a rather threatening promise to keep in touch, and then Harry dropped the hat over his penis and wheeled the chair out of Apparition and down the hall through DMLE.
“After you brought me the form that’d been partially lit on fire, I thought it best to be prepared,” Malfoy said, inking his quill and starting in on the first page.
Harry snorted. “I’m in here several times a week bringing you penises. I’m sure they’ve already got all sorts of ideas.”
"It's apparently part of my job description to Apparate Mrs Periweather and Persimmon to and from their grooming appointment every Tuesday."
"Yeah, okay." Ron wandered into his cubicle, peering at his desk. "Where are the others? You had more."
Harry glanced back just in time to see Seamus had picked up the box and was reading the top. "Accoutrements? Ha, nice. Sounds pretty classy for a cock in a box."
What followed were forty of the longest minutes of Harry’s life. Malfoy was exceedingly thorough in his examination of this newest cock, laying down his quill every few pages to poke and prod at it with his gloved hands, while making exceedingly annoying little thoughtful humming sounds before returning his attention to the form and filling out each section. Harry had never cared much what Malfoy had written before, but this time he felt his curiosity rising higher and higher every time Malfoy finished a page.
“Oh,” Harry said, “because well, he’s my godfather, wasn’t the one that told Riddle about my parents home and I liked him.” He shrugged.
“How does having a Lord impact someone’s life?” Dean asked, “I mean, you said you give them money if they need it. But is there something else?”
“It’s not something bad,” Harry said, looking Draco up and down, “I did fall for someone even more snobbish than them. How about we get me some new clothes Saturday, I’ll even let you pick one outfit out for me.”
“That’s smart,” Remus said, “They never told us what they did, but giving the task to Pihu does make sense. She would be able to sense the Potter magic and she would recognise you, as she was there when you were born.”
“About time,” he said, “even I saw you two dancing around each other, and that was only in the few days I saw you guys before the war.”
Harry felt Draco tense, he himself tensing as well. Harry wanted to answer, tell him that he probably shouldn’t mention the manor when Ron and Hermione were here. But it was too late. They hadn’t heard the door open, and they hadn’t noticed Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Molly walk in.
Sirius and Remus arrived together with Narcissa, they were ushered to the garden together with the other Weasleys. Together with them, some order members were invited, including Andromeda, Kingsley, Diggle and Hestia Jones. They were all there, talking fondly and getting into lively discussions. Percy had even brought his girlfriend, Audrey, something not many people had expected.
Sirius hugged the three, wishing them all a good term. Moly cried while hugging them, Ginny whispering encouraging words to her.
Narcissa smiled, “that is a great idea,” she said, “maybe we could get another cabinet for my paint.” Pihu nodded, looking at Draco who nodded, letting Pihu know he wanted that too. Seconds later a similar cabinet stood next to Draco’s.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Ron said, trying to defend his friend, “this isn’t any of your concern.” Harry could hear Dean and Seamus try not to laugh.
He saw Malfoy looking over to Harry multiple times, especially during the lunch period. It was nothing different to how they used to look at each other, searching to find something to yell about, something to sneer about. But now whenever they locked eyes there was no real fire there, it was all for show and both boys knew that.
It´s a lot of work, a baby. Harry and Draco both knew that, but there´s a very big difference between knowing it and actually having the kid. They´ve told their friends and family all about the birth but also asked them to not visit yet.
‟I thought I wouldn´t even be alive,” Harry says softly, stopping Draco in his tracks. ‟Let alone find someone to love and get a kid with.”
They combined all their knowledge, writing it all down. Ron knew the most about all the different magical departments and how the ministry worked. Harry was most knowledgeable about the courtroom and some about the entrance hall. Hermione, who had obviously read every book about it, could add even more information.
‟It seems that you are pregnant, mister potter,” she says softly. She stands opposites him and Harry doesn´t know what to do. He looks towards her with wide eyes, unsure what to say.
Harry nodded into the kiss, breaking away, “I’ve wanted you to fuck me since before I pulled you into that stall,” he said. He let himself fall on their bed, pulling Draco on top of him.
With that, the group decided that they had done enough in 4 days, and with one vacant room, there would be enough space for Hermione to sleep as well. It was Christmas evening and the group celebrated. The next morning, on Christmas day, Harry walked downstairs to find a huge pile of gifts under the tree. They waited till Hermione had arrived before unpacking the gifts. Everyone present got the Weasley sweater as they all had suspected they would get. Harry also got some sweets from Hagrid. Remus and Sirius had given him a notebook, one that protected whatever he wrote in it, one that no one could read unless he gave it to them with permission to read.
Suddenly the door opened, and Draco walked in. Everyone with a wand in hand pointed it at him.  Only the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville and Luna didn't lift their wand. “Don't do anything,” Harry called at everyone. He saw people hesitate, but they dropped their wands. “Draco,” he said turning to the boy, “what is going on?”
“Well, that and your ass,” Harry said, winking. He walked over to the counter. “Good afternoon!” he said, smiling brightly at the witch behind it. She looked startled by the smile but ringed them up quickly. “Thanks!” Harry said when she handed him the bag with his items. “Have a great day!”
“There are two offices,” Pihu supplied, “one for the head of the house and one for their spouse.”  She paused, “they face each other, and the wall between them can be removed and placed back at will.” Harry and Draco both looked surprised. Pihu just smiled, “most Lords and Lady’s had working spouses. Master James wanted to be able to see Mistress Lily when they worked unless he had to work on something confidential.”
Harry flushes with how casual Draco said that. He huffs linking his foot around Draco´s.  His friends haven´t spoken a word the whole time, looking at them. They´re eating and watching like they´re a show to watch. Harry grabs a pot with potatoes and starts piling his plate with them. He grabs some green with a pointed look at Draco, and also piles that on his plate.
Because Harry is fucking strong, so it seemed right. I wanted it to be a form of a snake, at first, but seeing the Occamy, a snake-like creature from India seemed the best fit! Draco's is obviously a Dragon, because well obviously. Draco means both Snake and Dragon.
Harry shrugged it off, “We are not,” he said turning to her, “I told you, I’m not interested in you. I have never been, not really. Stop acting like we are dating.” His voice was loud, and faintly he knew that the people in the Great hall were all listening to him.
‟Yeah,” Harry says with a smile towards Draco, he reaches into the pocket of his cloak, ‟this is him.” He says giving her the picture.
“I want to thank you,” Harry said to Hannah. They were once again sitting on the floor, as the benches were full. She looked at him with a confused expression on her face. “You said something on the train ride home during the holiday,” he clarified, “about me being a good teacher?’ She nodded in understanding. “I thought about it, and decided that I was going to try! So thank you for telling me that!”
He saw Lucius and Bellatrix running, leaving the room just on time. Not being harmed by him. Then he saw him pacing, the Snake slithering over.
‟How are you so chill about that?” Harry asks, ‟I mean, I was already overwhelmed when everyone started saying Ginny and I would end up together. And we were dating at that point.”
“How are we going to get there?” Harry asked at breakfast. “We can hardly apparate somewhere only I know the address of.”
Draco nods, ‟my thoughts as well, are you ready for that?” he asks, pulling Harry in an embrace, his back leaning on Draco´s chest.
They arrived at the vault not long after. The goblin put his hand, grabbing Sirius hand and placing it on the door as well. “Show the vault that you are of the Black family,” the goblin ordered. Harry saw Sirius concentrate.  He only guessed that Sirius was pushing his magic to the surface.
“Let’s take a nap,” Draco said, his eyes already drooping. Harry just chuckled, but flicked his hand, turning off the lights, and closing the curtains.
Harry feels his heart fill with love, turning over to kiss Draco fully. Keeping their linked hands on his small bump.
Neville gives a short nod, walking towards the door. ‟Malfoy,” he says when they pass each other in the doorway.
Today when they entered the room smelt delicious, he had no idea why, but he had a feeling he would find out. The class was gathered in front of a big cauldron, the lid was placed on top of it.
Ginny seemed to start to say something again, but Harry pushed through. “We should not because there is a war brewing, there are too many things that we need to focus on that isn’t a relationship between us. My focus will be on this war because that is what my life is now focused on. There is a man out there, trying to kill me and almost any wix that isn’t a pure-blood.”
Harry snickered, “The Harry Potter?” he asked, “didn’t know you already thought about me when you were younger.”
“He wanted to come with, said it was boring without anyone.” He moved over to Draco, hissing something to the snake. “You guys wanna see him?” he asked Seamus and Dean. They nodded, and Harry thrust out his arm, the snake uncurling and moving up his hand. He heard the snake hissing, and Harry laughed. “He wants me to tell you two that he’s cute and you should admire his snout. He’s very proud of it.” The little guy sat on his hand looking at the two humans in front of him.
Remus nodded, “exactly,” he looked to the woods, “you need to walk up to the road, till you can’t anymore, then do what you did in Gringotts. Push your magic to the surface, so the barrier can recognise you as a Potter.”
“But who were the Peverell’s? You’ve mentioned them twice now, both when mentioning prominent people in a family.” Hermione pointed out.
“Malfoy,” comes a voice from behind Harry. “Sorry, he’s confused. I’ll take him off your hands now.”
“Neville Longbottom,” Neville answered, “and I will never join your army. Dumbledore’s Army!” causing the others to cheer.
The minister had furiously apologised that he didn’t send over an owl before arriving, the boys had, in turn, vowed to never make out on the couch in front of the fireplace ever again. Well, unless they knew the floo network was closed.
Pansy moves away from Draco, standing in front of Harry. She holds out her hand, though it’s not for a handshake. He sees the glint in her eyes, waiting for what he does. He doesn’t hesitate before he lifts her hand, kissing it lightly. “Miss Parkinson,” he says, “pleasure to meet you.”
Harry moved in on himself, both from the loud crack and from the elf. Malfoy had his finger in front of his mouth, hoping the elf would understand that he needed to be quiet. It seemed that he did, as he only looked expectantly at Draco. “Could you bring us two cups of tea?” he asked, “and maybe some treacle tart or chocolate?” He didn’t know if Harry wanted it, but he rather has it here, than not.
“Yeah,” Draco said, “Gringott’s doesn’t like what they call wand carriers, so if they do employ them it is safe to say they are the best out there.” Harry nodded, remembering the time Griphook used that phrase.
Draco chuckled, “well, when has your life ever made sense.” Harry shrugged. “This scroll is about your vault,” he said, pointing at another scroll.
“Well,” he said, “the headmaster had asked me to go to you, but you never heard me when I came. So now I’ve been waiting for you to call me.”
Draco shrugs, ‟that just gives us room to grow, doesn´t it?” He smiles, ‟we can buy plants and things we think look nice. Thinks we´ve wanted but never thought fit in our rooms.” He smiles, ‟besides, we have two rooms that will be filled to the brim with toys for Scorpius and Teddy. A guest room, and an office. We don´t need a lot of stuff.”
“We need to find where Riddle is, he’ll have the snake with him.” Hermione said, she turned to Harry, “Look inside him,” she said, “find him and find the snake.” Hermione and Ron stood at both sides of him, their backs turned to him, watching the other end of the corridors.
When it was 9.55 Hermione turned to Harry, now speaking loud enough that the others would hear their conversation. “Hey Harry,” she said, “shouldn’t you get going? You have your detention with Snape tonight.”
‟You can clearly see she´s your daughter,” Draco laughs, stepping aside so Harry can crouch in front of her.
Draco steps back as if Harry struck him, “And what am I?“ he shakes his head, tears are streaming down his face, “you’d rather stay with people who don’t even know the real you than be happy with me?” Harry opens his mouth to protest. “You can’t tell me they know who you are if they don’t even know you’re bi. If they can’t even see that you’re in love.”
“Don’t call me that, Ginny,” Harry said, anger welling up, “I told you, we aren’t together anymore.” He was done with her, he just wished she stopped.
Draco nods, he scans the rest. ‟We just have to state how much who is going to pay, since it´s a combined contract. Not that it matters a lot since it´ll all be combined when we get married.”
“What I was reading made me think of a story I once made up,” Harry confessed, “I used to do that a lot, you know, daydreaming.” Draco nodded, “probably because I wasn’t allowed to read Dudley's books, and I couldn’t watch tv, so the only way to keep my mind kind of busy was thinking about stories.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, “I didn’t do it as much as you guys, but enough times to know I’m good enough at it.”
“Would they know when another is in mortal danger?” Harry asked, Draco nodded in response. “would they die if the other dies?” Draco shook his head.
Harry shakes his head, ‟I don´t care if they find out,” he says, ‟it´s better than people questioning if our son really is ours or not. No one can refuse to believe he´s mine if people see me being pregnant.”
The group ate in silence, going to bed not long after. Even though there were enough rooms, Luna was sleeping in Ginny’s room. No one mentioned how that wasn’t necessary. Harry and Draco moved to their own, collapsing on the bed.
“Where will you hold the ceremony?” Narcissa asked. “I can’t imagine you would want to do it in here.”
“What can I say,” he told her, smirking, “normally we would be fucking by now. I thought it would be nicer to at least stay here with you two.” This turn Hermione laughed loudly, causing the other two boys to look over.
“You will tell them, that because during Christmas you have more free time and that because there are fewer teachers walking around, it is the best time to work on making the Vanishing cabinet work.”
Days went past, the food slowly dwindled, eating less and less. With the amount of food, they ate the way they were was affected. Harry, very familiar with the pains of hunger, ate the least of the three. Ron, who also knew what it was like to have little, managed on, though with little for his mood wasn’t very good. Though, the fact that he kept this strong might be because of Draco. He knew that the other was there and still alive. The others hadn't got a clue if the people they love were safe. Obviously, Harry was still worried about the rest, but at least he could feel that Draco was safe.
Ron was adamant that Molly didn’t mind, something that was repeated by Molly herself when Ron told her that Harry and Draco would stay for dinner. The group enjoyed the rest of the day together. Luna and Ginny were also around so together the group played some games and just talked. When it was time to get ready for dinner, Harry, together with Ginny and Hermione, helped Molly in the kitchen. Harry talked about the manor, promising to take them both once.
“I wouldn’t say a word about it, sir,” Riddle said, his eyes and features showing wild happiness that not enhanced his handsome features but made them less human.
Harry takes Draco to the living room, where Bill and Fleur are sitting. Fleur stands with a smile, ‟Draco,” she says, ‟I´m happy to see you.” Draco smiles brightly towards her. ‟It´s been too long.”
After dinner the group didn’t feel like having a get-together, everyone moving to do their own thing. Dean drawing, while Seamus and Ron played chess. Hermione was reading, as were Draco, and Harry. Neville was talking softly with Hannah. Daphne writing something in a book she always seemed to carry. Ernie was not found a lot in the common room, mainly because his girlfriend was in the seventh year, and he would spend a lot of time in her common room.
‟I think that should be doable,” Andromeda says looking towards the list. ‟And have you thought to where you want to live? There are many villages close to good primary schools, both muggle and wizarding.”
“Yes,” Sirius said, “I wish to see my family vault.” The goblin nodded, handing Sirius a piece of paper, with the name Black written in cursive. He did the same as Harry the same glow emitting from the paper after Sirius’ blood fell on it.
Theo whistles low, ‟that´s soon. He must be as hung up on you as you were on him. Though, I thought you said he hated you.”
“I’m not on trial?” Draco asked, confused. Did people not know he was a spy for the order, he was fighting at the battle for Hogwarts.
‟Hiya Harry,” George says, ‟Draco,” he says with a polite nod. ‟Mum´s making treacle tart tonight,” he says.
When it´s five, Harry and Draco say goodbye to Andromeda and Teddy, walking back to Hogwarts. ‟You really want to live around Hogwarts?” Harry asks, ‟what if you get a job in St. Mungo’s?”
They got dressed, casting the appropriate cleaning spells on themselves. When Harry opened the door he saw people glaring, stumbling around. They walked slowly, eyes only half-open. Harry and Draco sniggered, waiting on the couch for the others. They came down slowly, all still glaring.
Blaise and Pansy laugh while Draco scowls, ‟okay so I could fill the bookcases and probably more than those alone.” He shrugs, ‟we´ll just have to see.”
‟I´ve known it would happen since I was eleven,” Blaise says, ‟we all have. It´s just a matter of time before our parents would find a good suitor for us.” Pansy and Draco both nod. ‟I´m lucky that the woman my mother wants me to marry is Daphne.”
Harry sobered up, “we learned our lessons, don’t worry.” Kingsley laughed, uncovering his eyes. “What brings you here?”
Draco and Harry, who´ve been expecting them to since Monday both nod, grabbing their coats. ‟Where is it being held?” Draco asks.
Everyone had a few. Dean from getting caught and fighting snatchers. Luna from her time in Malfoy manor. Seamus, Neville and Hannah from the carrows. And that wasn’t even counting the ones they had gotten during the battle. Or the battle of the ministry. Hermione and Ron had numerous burn wounds, courtesy of the Lestrange vault. The scars from the brain from the Department of Ministry were still prominently visible on Ron’s arms, and many more littering his body from the years before. Hermione showing the bright word that Bellatrix had cut into her arm.
“What is it with you and green,” Draco asked, “you’d think you were a Slytherin if you keep buying all these green things.”
They were ushered to the dining room. Where a nice dinner had been placed, ready to be eaten. Harry chuckled and took the place he was ushered to by Pihu, Draco being ushered to the other side by Lucien. Narcissa taking the remaining seat with a smile.
The boy crawled over to the lanky teen, he was still sitting cross legged, but they made it work. They both leaned forward and hugged. Harry could not be any happier, hugging Draco was one of the best feelings ever, and he thought the other boy might feel the same, giving by the soft sigh and the way he melted into the embrace. It only was a few moments, but it was enough for both of them. When they both backed out of the embrace the boys both turned their bodies towards the fire, as if that could help. They didn’t move from one another again, sitting side by side, shoulder to shoulder. The closeness helped both of them.
After dinner Harry and Draco did play chess, Draco winning as he usually did. Though not long after, they also had some fun behind securely closed doors, protected by a locking and silencing spell.
Harry tells his friends the next Wednesday pub night they have. They´re surprised, that´s for sure, but when they start asking about Draco, Harry lights up. They all tell him they support him and Harry feels completely loved.
“You all look great too,” Harry said, looking around. The group was complete, so they all walked down to the great hall. There were a lot of people present already. When Harry and Draco walked in arm in arm, he could feel peoples eyes on them.
The next week they return, with Neville, Luna, Ginny, Seamus and Dean helping as well. It´s busy and fun. They paint all paint one room, and with everyone, they´re done with the ground floor and half the first floor when it´s time to go back.
When Harry and Draco entered the common room Harry saw Ron and Hermione engrossed in each other, not wanting to bother them he pointed at the table close to the window. “Wanna help me with the potion essay? I never was good in writing things like that,” he said.
They all nodded along. “If Lady Narcissa and Heir Draco could stand in front of the sceptre,” she motioned to the table between them. The two moved to their indicated places gracefully. “Both place one hand on the sceptre and link the other together.”
“I did almost get sorted into Slytherin,” Harry says absentmindedly, “but well, Draco was an ass to me, and I didn’t want to go where he was going to be.”
The rest of the group had walked towards them, now all staring at the building. “Wow,” Ron said, “this looks really cool.”
Harry was looking at the interaction, listening to Draco. He felt his eyes well up slightly. Even though he knew he meant much to Draco hearing him say so was touching. He turned around to see his snake lying there. He scooped his hand down, letting it slither up his hand, he turned back around, hopping on his desk. He petted the snake while listening to the interaction.
Harry looked through his bag, grabbing a book as well, though he was reading a novel. He liked learning about magical theory, but on days like this, he liked reading novels more. The novels he was reading was a muggle book, where nothing much happened, just everyday life. Sirius had read them when he was younger, trying to annoy his parents and he had given some to Harry in the summer.
He saw Neville moving forward, he flung a spell at the snake. A spell was cast by Voldemort, and Neville fell down. “And who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is won?”
“Turn around,” Harry ordered, “ass up.” Draco blushed, but did as he was told, a warm feeling in his belly. Harry kneaded the two round globes, pulling them apart. He looked at the small hole, moving forward. He licked a strip over it, Draco gasping while his hips moved closer to Harry. He continued, licking the small hole, circling his tongue around it. Then, slowly he pointed his tongue, prodding at it.
“Really,” Hermione said, “why do we not learn this in school. There is so much about the magic world that is just ignored because people expect us to know it immediately. Half the people in these halls don’t even know how the ministry really works.”
He tried to find any way to meet the other boy alone, but he was always either accompanied by Ron and Hermione or by Ginny, who had suddenly developed the habit of following the trio everywhere. It annoyed Harry a bit.
Draco laughs, ‟that he did.” Draco moves away from his desk, tapping his papers so they stack each other in order. ‟He might surprise us,” he says.
They come back with paintbrushes and all the paint they need. It´s already late when it's all there though, so they return back to Hogwarts.
“You think I like this?” Harry calls out, “you think I like going to a dinner with my friends and suddenly someone’s there for me to date? You think that is what I want?”
“Yeah, and we know Riddle knew that. I mean in our second year he even said that after he opened the chamber Dumbledore never let him out of his sight, he knew that Dumbledore never trusted him.” Harry said.
“I have to,” Harry said, “even Dean knows,” he said realising he hadn’t told Draco that yet, “he found out Monday I think?” He laughed, remembering the conversation, “I’m honestly surprised Hermione doesn’t know already.”
“Okay, so basically they just ignored what you said, which, honestly, doesn’t surprise me.” Harry looked at Draco. “Don’t blame yourself for this Draco, you didn’t do it yourself, and besides, no one got hurt. Now, yesterday we said we would actually talk about stuff today, so tell me, how do they get messages to you, I thought they checked all the owls?” Harry asked.
The others looked at them confused, “one of you going to explain it?” Seamus asked, the trio shook their head.
There Harry lay on his back, with only his briefs still on, his erection visible by the tent of it. Draco looked back in conformation again, “Yeah?” he asked, needing to hear the consent from Harry’s lips.
“I agree with Draco,” Hermione said, surprising everyone around the table, she continued, “I have never heard about Horcruxes before,” she said.
Draco continued the motion by circling the little muscle with the tip of his tongue. He moved around it, and over it. Harry moving his hips higher, back onto Draco’s face. Draco chuckled, the vibrations moving through his mouth onto Harry. Causing Harry to moan louder. Rewarding the sound Harry made, he pushed his tongue past the ring. He sucked lightly, moving in and out.
Last came Remus and McGonagall. They both explained their involvement during the battle at the astronomy tower. When asked if they had more to say, Remus said that Greyback was the werewolf that had turned him he was younger, and that he had been involved in the Werewolf army as a spy. Harry was shocked, as he had not known that. Remus told the court that Greyback had indeed lead that army.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, “but, I think, we need to wait till Sirius is back before we go in.” Ron and Hermione looked at him questioningly, “he told me that he couldn’t bring himself to do these rooms yet, I don’t think we should go in without at least telling him.” They nodded.
They looked at the last book, it was thin, only showing the drawing of the Deathly Hallows. Draco picked up the book, Harry moving into his side to read along with Draco. The book first repeated the story, but then it went more into the history and how much truths was in it. The book told about what the objects had done to others. There was even an attempt made to keep track of the three objects. Though the wand could only be tracked for five generations, there were some rumours written down, though no one that was alive was mentioned. The rumour about the cloak was easier to track, all the way to the last Peverell family member, though after that no one was certain what happened. The same for the stone. Of course, the boys knew better, as they knew that Harry possessed the cloak and that the stone was in the hands of the Gaunt’s. That was till Merope died in childbirth.
The two nodded, and Remus walked away, Hermione walked past Harry, “I think you need to think where we should be going first because I think it won’t be smart to go to Godric’s Hollow, I think Riddle might keep an eye on it.” She lightly touched his arm while leaving the door.
They kept dancing while they kissed, slowly. They moved around the room, they moved without intention, too caught up with each other. That was till Harry felt the back of his legs hit something. Their kiss broke and both boys looked behind Harry to see a big bed in the room. The room had given them a bed, something it hadn’t so far, not in any of the romantic dates, or trysts the boys had had.
They sat in silence for a moment, both men thinking about the trials and things that happened during the war. “How are you going to feel?” Harry asked, Draco cocked his head in question. “Seeing your father again,” he clarified, “even though you aren’t testifying I think you’ll still have to be there.”
Harry´s eyes widen in horror, causing Draco to laugh harder. ‟I think your friends were pretty worried. Seamus and Dean wanted to follow but Neville stopped them.” Harry groans, ‟what´d you tell him anyway?”
‟Yeah,” Harry says, his hands behind his back, ‟I didn´t want you all to find out about this through the Prophet, because I´m sure some students have already sold the story to Rita or something.”
When Harry and Draco arrived at the common room they went their separate ways, Harry joining the other Gryffindors, Draco sitting down alone, reading.
Draco came walking in, he looked calm. His eyes immediately landing on Harry. Inside himself he felt relief, they would get out of here alive. He also felt his magic getting more powerful, just because he was in the same room as Draco.
After that conversation it took no time before dinner was over and he would have to go to the headmasters office. Hermione and Ron offered to walk with him, but he refused, scared that they would see Malfoy and start asking questions. He told them that he wanted time to clear his mind, which seemed to make them back off.
“Hm, okay, but I do this reluctantly, that you know that,” Harry said, letting Draco get out of the bed. The boys got dressed and slowly walked down to the kitchen.
He cast the last spell that was needed to fix the cabinet. He used a bird, to be moved through the cabinet. When it came back, alive and well, he knew that he could move between them without being killed. It came back, after half an hour, intact and fluttering.
“Morning,” Harry said, pleased. “Hermione,” he asked, “would you teach me how to do eyeliner?” he asked. “I really liked it.”
“It was basically a gift for my birthday? But also for the bonding?” he said, not really sure how to explain it to them.
‟It´s actually not a girl,” Harry says, his thumb goes to his mouth, biting at the skin around the nail. He sees their eyes look at the ring on his right finger.
Harry didn’t waste any time, removing his own pants and briefs. He was achingly hard, coating his cock with lube and a protection spell. “Turn around,” he ordered, “put a pillow under your butt.” Draco did as he was told, his body positively flushed from arousal. “So beautiful,” he said absentmindedly. He lined up his cock, pushing in slowly the head of his cock sliding in.
“It’s a snake,” Harry said, without waiting for their reaction he continued, “he’s got this really cute nose, and it's nonvenomous for humans. They’re called hognose snakes, and he’s only one year old. He promised not to harm anyone, which makes sense cuz he’s the smallest thing ever and he won't get any bigger than 40 cm, probably.” He breathed in and looked at his godfather, who was laughing, “what?”
Harry felt the bench beside him go down and turned to look at the person now sitting next to him. “Hey Luna,” he said.
“Yes,” Draco says softly, “if your family won’t even accept that you love me if you don’t even think I’m worth the small risk of losing them.” He shakes his head, “I’m worth more than that, more than being your secret. I want to live and be happy, I want to be with someone who’s happy to be with me, for who I am. Not for what others think of them being with me.”
When harry walked back towards the Gryffindor common room, he was still smiling. He had not expected to end his night, with such a smile on his face. He didn’t even check if anyone was in the common room when he entered. He probably should have, because Ron and Hermione were still there.
Moving up and down Draco’s hands grabbed a hold of Harry, helping him. He too moved his hips, meeting each other. When Draco hit Harry’s prostate he threw his head back, letting out a loud moan. Draco took advantage of the expanse of his bared neck, kissing it.
No one has spoken with Draco, and it´s Dean who breaks first. ‟So, Malfoy,” he says leaning forward, ‟which sport is better, Quidditch or football.”
‟Oh,” Mrs Weasley says softly, ‟who´s the lucky man?” her eyes don´t flit to Ron as they´d gone to Ginny.
‟You´re right that I can´t yet,” she says, ‟but I can see that Harry has and that he loves you. I can see you love him as well. That is enough for now.” Draco smiles while she extends her hands, he takes it gladly. ‟Welcome to the family Malfoy,” she says.
She shows them around and Harry and Draco look around in wonder. If Harry looks in the distance, he can see Hogwarts. ‟I wonder what they see,” he says to Draco softly. ‟Instead of the castle.”
‟You were gone for half an hour,” Draco points out, pulling him towards the couch of the room, ‟what did Pomfrey say.”
Harry hummed, he moved so he was lying close to Draco. His hand reached for Draco’s hair, the boy humming softly while Harry carded his fingers through it. “Are you happy about it?” he asked.
“Good,” Riddle answered. “You will all move now, go to the astronomy tower, and call Severus from there.” He dismissed them with a few last words, “don’t make too much noise before Dumbledore is killed, he is the mission, Hogwarts is to remain intact, as next year, we will rule it.” The group cheered.
‟I know darling,” she says with a sweet smile on her face, but Harry can see that there is a lot of mischief behind that smile.
Harry listened, he looked at Sirius at the end of the story and saw tears running down his cheek. When asked where the locket was he burst out in tears. He had seen Mundungus steal it, but he had not been able to do anything, as he was told not to interfere in the cleaning of the house. Harry asked Kreacher to search for Mundungus, so they could finish what Regulus would have wanted.
The potions exam goes well, both practical as theoretical part. Harry crashes in his bed the moment he´s done. Draco joins him not long after. ‟He´s using more energy,” Draco notes.
“He raised you like a pig for slaughter,” Kingsley said, looking disgusted. “I remember Voldemort saying he killed you while you were running, but you went didn’t you?”
It all goes fast after. He and Harry are put in a room. Harry changes into a hospital gown and a screen is placed around his midriff. Draco is told to stand by Harry´s head. And two nurses walk in. Harry´s lower half goes numb with a wave of the wand and the operation begins. It´s done in under twenty minutes, his magical placenta and stomach sutured together magically.
They wound up in a little sandwich shop in the centre of London. “I actually wanted to ask you something,” Draco said when they finally got their sandwiches. “I know we discussed the Honeymoon, and said we’d go to India in a year,” Harry nodded, “but I also think we deserve at least some fun after we get married. Maybe a small trip abroad.”
Andromeda nods, ‟if you want, I can always go to some agencies and look for houses. If you write a list with the things you want, I can go out and look.”
‟I know we joke about that a lot,” Harry says, ‟but you don´t have to if you don´t want to. Hell, we don´t even know if you can get pregnant.”
“This was my room until I moved out,” Sirius said. “I didn’t want to impose on them, so as soon as I had the money, I bought my own place in London. They kept it empty though, for whenever Moony and I would visit. This one,” he said, pointing at the door beside Sirius’, “used to be where Peter slept if he visited as well.”
Harry moved his hand before his mouth smothering the small groans of pleasure escaping between his lips the other buried into Draco’s hair. It wasn’t long before he was coming, Draco knowing perfectly well how to get Harry off as quickly as possible. Harry hit the wall with his fist when he came, the sound rattling through the shared bathroom.
Harry laughs, ‟about the same with me.” He frowns, ‟I know we're out to our friends, but do you still want to keep it a secret from the rest of the school?”
“No, I said I wasn’t talking about that,” he said. “Can we please talk about something else now?” Ron nodded in agreement.
“Tattoos are a bit permanent right now,” Harry said, “but you do have something with the nail polish.” Draco looked at Harry, nodding.
She puts a hand on his shoulder, and he looks up. ‟There are some things we should discuss,” she says, ‟but maybe it might be an idea to tell the other father?” she gently suggests. ‟We´ll make an appointment for tomorrow, at noon,” she says, ‟bring the father if you want, but you don´t have to.”
“Technically that would be today,” Neville supplied unhelpfully. “Honestly surprised how not drunk we all are.” The group nodded in agreement. Though people were staggering when they stood. “Nevermind, when you stand, it hits different,” he said, clutching to Hannah.
McGonagall continued with Daphne, and then Neville, saying that the man who stood before her was a brave boy, from his first year right up till the end. How she could not be more proud to have seen him grow into a confident man, who wasn’t afraid to stand up to even the darkest of people. How his parents would have been proud to see him. She finished by telling him she can not wait to see him in two years.
“Sure,” Draco said, yawning, “but now I’m going to sleep.” Harry yawned as well. They both pulled off their clothing, Draco folding his neatly, Harry just throwing them into the closet. They climbed into bed, falling asleep seconds after their heads met the pillow.
“I’m not running away from this,” he whispered, the others were busy talking. “I love you Harry, but I can’t run like a coward, scared someone will hurt me. I need to fight, for you all. I’ll fight with Fred and Percy.” He said, “besides, most of the DA and Order knows I’m with them. You’ll win today, I know it. And If you don’t I’ll just have to come with you. If it means I won't be able to be a spy after this, so be it.”
“But,” Harry pressed, “are you going to mention it to McGonagall? Are you going to do something about it?”
Draco frowns, ‟already? Don´t you think that´s a bit too soon? 8 weeks is like two months time.” He pauses, ‟isn´t one month enough.”
“It is,” Draco said, “because they ended with the note that they would approve the curriculum we have if it was for another class. As in a change in class.” The group looked at the boy in confusion. “They basically said, we’ll approve this for Muggle Studies.”
“Well,” Harry stared at the glass in his hand, “I mean, we can’t really tell anyone, at least not while you and I are still ‘enemies’ for everyone. And I really don’t want to tell dumbledore or Snape, I don’t know if they would try to keep us apart.” Draco nodded at that.
Harry experimentally moved, lifting his hips slightly, sinking back down. Harry groaned, the feeling of being filled only adding to his lust. He moved around trying to find the right angle, wanting to hit his prostate. It took him little time to find the right angle. When he did he started moving earnestly.
Harry didn’t know what he expected, he just knew it wasn’t this. It was clean, the bed made, and no random clothes strewn around. It looked like no one had lived there for several years, which was true. He walked around, seeing no personal effects on the bedside tables or any other personal effects that someone might have had. No pictures, no anything. The room was nice, there was art hanging on the walls, and big windows were shining light into the room.
“Uh,” Harry paused, he has never been able to lie to Sirius and Remus, he looked over at Draco. His panic must have been evident, maybe it was the bond, he thought briefly, as Draco just laughed slightly.
In the castle Sirius, Remus and Draco had gone out of the hallway. Draco suddenly fell down, the two adults kneeling next to him. “Draco,” Sirius said, grabbing his hand, “What’s happening.”
“My father did want to send me to Beauxbatons, but mother wanted me to stay closer to home,” Draco joked, though only Fleur laughed at it. Molly, who wasn’t really interested, had stopped listening after she had voiced her question. The table fell silent after that, all the occupants too busy eating to talk about anything.
He saw Voldemort, standing in front of a death eater, he recognised him as Rowle. The man was withering in pain. “Again,” Voldemort said. “Do it again Draco.” Again the man contorted in pain. “He should’ve been there faster, should have been able to take Harry Potter. You called me back here, to tell me that you had not found Harry Potter, that he escaped again.” Voldemort turned to Draco, “show him how displeased I am, or feel the displeasure yourself.”
“I love you too,” Draco whispered back, and Harry looked in the mirror and only saw his own reflection staring back at him.
They are married! I totally freestyled the ritual. I wanted to use a spell, but then I remembered that I would have to make the spell myself and my mind just went blank, no thoughts at all. So ritual like this it is :)
“Harry,” Hermione said quietly, “remember how we cleaned the house in the summer before fifth year, how we looked at everything and threw out all the dark stuff?” Harry nodded, “there was a locket there, one that we couldn’t open. We passed it around. Do you remember it?”
‟Yeah,” Harry calls back. He cleans the floor and his clothes, before climbing the stairs. He sees Draco sitting in their bed, a book before him. His eyes are no longer puffy.
‟That means you going to take my last name when we marry?” Draco shoots back. ‟He should have the same last name as all of us. Either we all become Potter, or Malfoy-Potter, or Potter-Malfoy.”
Harry looked at both of them, having stayed silent during the conversation, “I would be happy,” he smiled, “maybe we could go tomorrow, take care of it as soon as possible.” Both Draco and Narcissa nodded. “We could go to Potter Manor after that since you haven’t seen it yet.” Narcissa smiled at him saying she would be delighted.
They left the house, Harry taking the books with him. “We’re going to the burrow,” Ron said, “we promised to come back before dinner unless you needed us till then.” Harry nodded, hugging them both tightly before they both left.
“Honestly,” Draco said, “I wish he’d go to Azkaban. The man might have been nice to me before the dark lord came back, but the things I saw him do during the war.” Draco shuddered, “No one should be able to get away with that.” He paused, “I shouldn’t get to get away with what I did.”
It was well into February when Hermione came up to Harry, asking him if the four of them could talk. Something Harry had not expected to hear. He told them to meet them that Thursday in the same room as they had met last time. When they arrived they all sat down expectantly.
‟Of course not,” Blaise says, ‟we are courting. Most people,” he says with a pointed look to Draco, ‟do that before proposing to be married. Or diving into bed with their future spouse.”
“Saturday,” he said, “they’re coming to Hogsmeade, so we’ll meet them there. They’re mad at Draco because he didn’t tell them we were dating, let alone that we are bonded now.”
The trio looked at one another. “We, uh,” Harry said, “we jumped off him before he landed, and we saw him drink before flying away again.”
“You want to?” he asked, “I think the story will have spread over the whole school by now.” Harry blanched at that, “we could make a small stop at Three Broomsticks, it’s already lunch time now, so we could eat our lunch there.”
The cafe, a quaint shop that was both for muggles as for wizards, was pleasantly crowded. Enough people to form a blanket of anonymity, but not so much that they had to work hard to spot Narcissa.
They spent the day together, Draco teaching Harry how to paint. Or at least he attempted to, Harry did not turn out to be the painter, or drawer. But they had fun in the end, which was the main point.
‟That would be great,” Harry says, ‟if we don´t find something before we end the school year, I don´t know what we will do.”
She turned to Greyback, “where did you get the sword?” The man who was known for turning innocent children cowered before her.
When Draco’s legs hit the bed he sat down, scooting slowly on top of the bed, Harry following him, crawling on top of the boy, straddling his lap. It took little time before both Harry and Draco’s shirts were gone. Draco took the small break, that resulted from the shirt being moved over the head, to take control again. Rolling the two of them over, so that Harry was under Draco. Harry in turn wrapped one leg over Draco’s waist pulling him closer to his body. Draco rolled his hip down, creating friction that made both boys groan.
“I’d like that,” Harry said, “I would like it if you were all there, maybe Hermione and Ron as well. I don’t know if I could go somewhere they’ve lived alone.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hand. They all smiled at him nodding.
“What have you been up to? People are saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“Yeah,” Ron said, “it’s hard. I still play chess, even though, sometimes when the knight goes down, I can feel what first year was like. I can feel myself falling again.” He paused, “It’s bad for me, and what you went through all those years, it's so much worse than for me and Hermione combined.” He looked towards the path, seeing Hermione and Draco walking over together.
Harry greatly disliked St Mungo's. The cool, dry air. The faint antiseptic smell that he knew would linger on his clothes when he left. The clean white walls and gleaming tile floor. As an Auror, he'd had his fair share of injuries that brought him here. He knew Malfoy had gone on to become a Healer, but by some entirely uncharacteristic stroke of luck, Harry had never encountered him. At least here in St Mungo's. He encountered Malfoy in other places much more often than he was entirely comfortable with. Especially when Malfoy insisted on showing up to Pub Nights. But in a non-professional setting, Harry could easily avoid him in the crowd. And alcohol went a long way toward making Malfoy more tolerable.
“Mishandling evidence!” Seamus said, tossing the cock back to Harry, who replaced it in line on the edge of his desk.
Rosemary snorted. "Just enjoy you've an actual office through the end of April, you wanker. Not sharing space with all those stinky gits in the bullpen."
cocks. But there might be a clue in there somewhere, some lead he could track down. And it was Harry’s job to find whoever was responsible for this and make sure they were punished to the fullest extent of the law. Sending the cock to Bartram? That was funny. But this? This was over the line.
"Yes, it certainly does," Malfoy agreed. "However, I can assure you that it's not. 'Is this a Splinching accident or a very realistic sex toy?' is unfortunately a question many Healers find themselves answering at one point or another in their careers. It's not the first time I've done it, and Merlin help me I'm certain it won't be the last."
The second one appeared on Wednesday morning. Both of the cocks were blessedly unfamiliar to Harry, and even though Malfoy had been the Healer on duty both times Harry visited St Mungo’s with a Containment Receptacle in one hand and form 68-J in the other, that turned out to be not quite so bad. Certainly it wasn’t any worse than what Harry had come to expect from him. Malfoy was an arsehole, and always seemed to be more amused than he should be by Harry bringing him cocks, but he wasn't going to question Malfoy's sense of humor too closely. He
“You don’t sound sorry at all,” Harry grumbled, though he couldn’t help smiling back. Malfoy’s laugh did things to him. Strange, fluttery, squirmy things to his lungs and stomach.
“That,” Harry began, and broke off. Because it really made a terrible sort of sense. “Someone’s doing this to me deliberately.”
he’d be retrieving. She’d told him to take a shoebox, so presumably whatever Splinched bit he’d been sent to collect would fit inside. Or, Rosemary had made a point of mentioning how the box was charmed, maybe it had some sort of extension spell on it, undetectable or otherwise?
“What’s going on?” Harry asked. He squeezed past Ron and found Hermione briskly packing away the cocks into a cardboard box.
It attracted a lot more notice than he wanted, as the chair had begun to squeak as soon as he crossed through the doorway. Heads poked out as he passed, but Harry ignored them as he continued on, pushing the chair and box and cocks along the hall.
When he walked into the Atrium, he found a small crowd of witches and wizards gathered around the Fountain of Magical Brethren. And, wonderful. Lovely. Looked like the areshole leaving the cocks around was back to making political statements.
Harry glanced back over his shoulder, her expression seemed to be caught somewhere between exasperated and amused. He smirked, shrugging lightly, and rounded his desk and sat in his chair. "Active case. I keep other bits of evidence on my desk. And it's not like they're
"It is a penis on a chair. Thanks to you, I had to steal a piece of office furniture from another department. I'm probably going to get a nasty memo from Furnishings & Utilities about it."
Then Harry turned and his smile fell. Ron was grinning like a loon, holding a cuppa in one hand and a plate of penis-shaped shortbread in the other. "You are a horrible person and I hope you get Dragonpox."
“Why do you always think it’s something I did?” Harry asked. “Okay, the vibrating vindaloo prick was my fault, I accept responsibility for that one.” When Malfoy gave him a sharp look at that, he rolled his eyes. “Promise I didn’t spill curry on this one. I found it like this.”
"Glad to see you back." He nudged Ron over and stole one of Harry's biscuits. Harry took another as the plate was beginning to look very picked over. Then he put it on his desk, standing in front of it, hoping to block the view.
After a moment, he pulled away again. "Normal people ask to meet up for lunch. Or dinner. Or whatever."
Seamus poked the Vicious Cockmonster, jumping back a step when it started to swell. "Holy shit! And someone Owled that to Bartram?"
"Apparition, yeah?" the Mediwitch cut in. She nodded toward the box and gave Harry a rueful smile. "We see a lot of you folks in here. Especially round holidays. Don't even get me started on Beltane. It's a madhouse in here, arms and feet everywhere! One year we had an entire box of ears. Had the devil's own time matching them up to their owners again. Somehow we ended up with one left over." Her gaze went a little distant. "I wonder what happened to it..."
"Did it by chance look something like this?" Kingsley placed a box on the table before him. It was white and appeared to be lacquered and very expensive, the sort of box Harry would associate with fine jewelry or fancy perfume. Harry pulled it closer and saw
And that was all right. Williamson was an arse, and Harry could be nice to people. He’d be very careful to be nice to Rosemary and not give her a reason to arse around with his schedule. That just left her tendency to be annoyingly cheerful, and the delegation. Which, as the witch in charge of running Apparition, delegation was pretty much her entire job description. But she had a reputation for going about it in the manner of an overbearing older sibling, and took great and obvious joy in sending her underlings off on tasks that she wouldn’t want to do herself.
Harry leaned in again, something about hearing words coming out of Malfoy's mouth filling him with the desire to Shut. Him. Up. Harry foresaw lots of arguments and snogging in his immediate future.
He snickered, then abruptly stopped when the cock redoubled its efforts at the sound, leaving the table to squeak ominously.
Which worked well enough, until a particularly enthusiastic twitch against the lid sent the cock popping up like a jack-in-the-box.
“Healer Malfoy,” the Mediwitch repeated with a smile Harry couldn't quite comprehend someone using while saying Malfoy's name. "Exam room 12. I'll let him know you're waiting and he'll be in just as soon as he finishes up with the patient he's currently seeing to."
Harry looked over to see Robards rushing across the room towards them, red-faced and fuming. He grabbed Seamus by the arm before he could duck away. By now, most of the department was standing on their desks or crowding out of their cubes to watch.
And that sounded perfect to Harry. He'd just ignore them for three hours, the problem would take care of itself, and Harry would never again utter the words 'Prestissimo Erectus' in his life. Lesson learned.
When he arrived at his cubicle, he groaned. There was a caseboard on his back wall, covering his poster of the Appleby Arrows, and on it were pictures of cocks. Seven of them. Filling the top half of the board. Each neatly listed in order found, and then numbered, labeled, and with locations marked.
Harry sent him a glare, and couldn’t help but notice how Malfoy looked much better than he had the last time Harry had seen him, though to be fair it might’ve been that the lime green robes and the harsh lights of St Mungo’s didn’t do terribly flattering things to his complexion. Made him look all washed-out and sickly. Sometimes Harry was surprised that Malfoy, vain as he was, had signed on for a profession that involved lime green clothes and harsh lighting. Or that he hadn’t had his father buy up St Mungo’s and change the uniforms. Or something.
Hermione made an odd noise when she looked in on his desk. "You're really just leaving two penises on your desk?"
"Alas, not mine to keep. If it wasn't for bloody Bartram, the whole lot would be off in Lost and Found by now. Only question is whether this manages to be enough of a reminder to get Kingsley breathing down my neck again."
Harry snorted. It read a bit like those stupid informational posters that plastered the walls at St Mungo’s, adverts for the Knight Bus and five helpful tips to recognize Dragon Pox. He idly wondered whose job it was to print up informational pamphlets and instruction cards, and whether the staff at St Mungo’s and Accoutrements had sent off to the same person to have theirs done. He flipped the card over, and found a list of instructions for activating the cock’s various functions.
“You needn’t look so cheerful about it,” Hermione said primly, pausing for a moment to cast a spell on Creepily Clingy CopyCock’s canister lid to affix it firmly in place, so that none of the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder could spill out in transit. “I’m very busy. Right now I’m in the middle of overseeing forms 76-D, -G, and -J, and it’s really quite…”
And that was all right until he got to the fourth page of the form that called for a verification of the filing of form 68-J. It took Harry a moment to place why that form sounded familiar. When it clicked in his mind, he put his head down and thumped it against the desk.
And because his life went like that, when he arrived at the pub, Dean and Pansy were sitting in the booth together, arguing about the placement of Orsino Thruston's wedding pictures in the special edition of the
Malfoy sighed as he came into the exam room. "You again? Didn't I just see you in here? Taking up residence?"
Malfoy opened the box and unceremoniously dumped the cock onto the exam table. It flopped for a moment like a fish out of water, its bollocks wobbling and flushed head peeping from the foreskin as it continued to shiver. Malfoy looked amused with the faintest touch of horror seeping in at the edges of his expression, and Harry didn’t blame him. It reminded him of nothing so much as a small dog so excited and eager to be petted that it couldn’t keep from quivering with anticipation.
"Merlin, Potter. Are you going to get naked or am I going to write this off as a loss and go back to work?"
"Hm," Malfoy said, leaning down. He gave it a little prod with his wand. The penis continued to lie there. He ran the tip of his wand up the underside from base to tip.
“Which leads me to believe that you’ve done something to it,” Malfoy went on, signing his name to the bottom of the first page with a little flourish. He leaned closer to the cock and poked it with his quill, then froze and sniffed. “Why does it smell like curry?”
It took Harry a moment to tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s hands to realize what Malfoy was asking for. “Bugger,” he said. “I left it back at the Ministry.”
“You,” Ron said, looking highly amused. “Learning a healthy respect for rules. I don’t think you’d know what rules are if they came up and bit you on the arse.”
Malfoy snapped on his gloves, flipping open the Receptacle. "Mm. And I could be calling you a dickhead. You'll never know."
Seamus turned green, and there was a round of laughter from the Aurors around them. Harry started off again.
Except. He should really stop thinking things like that. Because then it did get worse. It got much worse when Malfoy picked up the cock and gave it a few brisk strokes. Just like the others had, it began to firm up and. Harry felt his face go suddenly hot, and there was no way Malfoy wouldn’t spot his blush if he looked up. But thankfully, Malfoy’s attention never wavered from the hardening cock in his hands. He was frowning a bit in concentration, brows drawn and his lower lip tucked between his teeth.
Harry couldn’t imagine it being worse than the last, but he expected he’d be able to picture it quite vividly by the end of the day.
George raised an eyebrow at him, turning to look at the large Wheezes sign just beside them, and then back at Harry. "It's a sparkly penis. Next to my shop. Of course I'm here. The poor bloke who found the thing thought it was something of mine."
"Well." Malfoy coughed, gathering himself. "It was funny. You came in all red-faced and lost and, well, I couldn't resist messing with you."
Harry woke late Sunday morning from an extremely distressing sex dream in which Malfoy touched Harry with blue-gloved hands and each time Harry got close to coming, Malfoy would stop and make notes about his performance on a thick stack of forms, nodding thoughtfully to himself as he did.
"Of course. I don't talk to you for your brains." But the grin Malfoy shot him at that took the sting out of the words. Harry had no idea how he managed that.
Harry glanced over to see Rosemary waving at Hermione, still laughing too hard to answer. He sighed. "What's up?"
Harry made a face at him. “Different. New. What’s with you and completely underselling how entirely bizarre this whole thing is?”
Harry just grinned, pulling away as Malfoy's eyes slowly blinked open, pupils blown and dazed-looking. "I win."
“Because the Containment Receptacles aren’t fireproof, I just discovered.” Harry gestured at the jet of sparks, which had shifted from red to orange to gold. “And believe me, I’m going to write a strongly worded letter of complaint to the arsehole who designed them.” Maybe he’d get Hermione to help him. She was always on about safety and… paperwork. And things like that. He wasn’t entirely clear on what it was she did all day, but she’d never been one to turn down a good letter-writing campaign. Harry would bring her a bottle of wine tonight and they’d make an evening of it.
Which was exactly the same, except for one very important difference. Under the CARE section, the last letter now read:
The Patrolman coughed again, and Harry sighed. The cock didn't twitch. He leaned down slowly, placing the open receptacle beside it. Still nothing. He finally rolled it slowly, carefully, into the box using the lid, just in case his touch triggered… something.
At the mention of Bartram, Hermione appeared, as if by magic. It reminded Harry a little of how Crookshanks could be summoned from a dead sleep by the sound of a can opener. He looked morosely down into his pint glass at the two inches of beer sloshing in the bottom. That wasn’t nearly enough to get him through this conversation. He reached out with a foot and shoved the chair to his left away from the table just in time for Hermione to slip into it.
"And where are they going to transfer me? I'm already in Apparition. And Kingsley put me on this case specifically." He grinned. "He can hardly fault me for having case notes on my desk. It shouldn't be my responsibility to Apparate people places, anyway."
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he said, “heir to the Malfoy family, we used to serve the same psychopath,” he states calmly.
He heard the sound of the condom package ripping open. Draco poured some more lube over the condom, making sure that there was enough, that he wouldn’t hurt Harry. He held Harry still with his hips with one hand, slowly he pushed in, stopping every time he felt Harry tense, and only moving again when he relaxed again. It wasn’t long till he was inside, Harry speeding up the process by pushing back.
“No one was killed, Neville was pretty hurt, and Bill will have scarring from Greyback,” this news caused Draco to inhale sharply, “but he won’t turn into a werewolf at least. How are you?”
‟As Harry said,” he says, ‟I want for you to be with someone strong enough to stand up to you and me. Someone who isn´t going to be walked over because they´re married to a Malfoy, someone who is proud to be a Malfoy.” He smiles, ‟I needed to know if Harry is that someone.”
Harry also told him about Sirius, not only about how he wasn’t guilty but also about how he was the best mate of his father, how he together with Remus and Pettigrew were the marauders, the makers of the map. He told him, how, when he moved out, he wanted to live with Sirius. Just like he had been with Sirius for some of his summer this year. That was the only time he had really been happy during summer. He told him what he hoped would happen, what he hoped his life would be like when the war was over.
Harry kept his eyes closed even though he knew that she was standing in front of him. He didn’t know what he was waiting for really, but he felt like that is what he was supposed to do. It didn’t matter to him really, he knew Ginny would never do something to hurt him, he knew that.
Harry and Draco woke up that Sunday with only a small headache from the night before. With a busy Saturday, they hadn’t had time to pack their stuff yet. So after having breakfast together in the great hall they went to work. Harry, still very proficient with packing spells, packed their clothing into the suitcase. Draco shrank Darsh’ terrarium, adding it in his trunk, Darsh napping around his neck. They cleaned out their pictures and posters on the wall and cleaned out both their desks. Their trunks were full by the end, but with a quick featherlight charm, they had no problem carrying it down to the common room. From there on the house-elves would take it to the trains.
Walking inside the Room he saw Draco pacing in circles around the couch and table. He stopped immediately when he saw Harry coming in and went up to him. “Please tell me you found a way to warn Dumbledore,” he pleaded, almost shaking Harry by his shoulders.
“Sir, I want to ask you something,” he said, smiling politely at the professor, who opened his arm as if to show that he was always welcome to ask anything. “I wondered what you know about,” it seemed that he hesitated for a second before continuing, “about Horcruxes?”
They all shrug, ‟we´ve grown up knowing our family is important, and that their standing is important. Marrying well is important to that, especially for heirs.” Blaise frowns, ‟I´m more surprised Longbottom get´s to date Luna.”
‟I´ll take care of Scorp, and figure more out about myself.” He gives her a small smile, ‟I don´t really have any hobbies, so I might try to find some.” She smiles and nods. ‟And I might already look into some things for the defence position. McGonagall says I´m qualified for teaching already, but I might want to do research into something, like a normal start of an apprenticeship.”
They look over at Draco, who’s lounging on the couch with muggle clothing on, reading a book that Hermione recognizes as written by muggles. The man looks up and nods at them in hello. Harry folds himself into his side seamlessly and tells them everything he remembers.
Slowly he pushed in, Harry’s hand grabbing the blanket under him, the other pulling Draco in for another kiss. Slowly he pushed in, waiting for Harry to move before moving back out. The pace they set was slow, loving, passionate. No words needed to be used, no filthy words coming out of their mouth, they kissed endlessly. And when they weren’t kissing they were staring into each other's eyes. The pace slowly increased, Draco moving more forcefully, touching Harry’s prostate. Causing said boy to arch his back, letting out a low moan, again and again, and again.
Harry finds himself with Draco´s friends later in the week. They´re in Harry and Draco´s room, sprawled over the big bed that stands in the middle. ‟Can´t believe Draco is the first one of us to have a kid,” Blaise says with a laugh. ‟I´ve been courting Daphne since I overheard my mother speaking with the Greengrass´. I´d expected to be the first one.”
“It would be an honour,” she said, “but do you really wish for your mother to live in your home?” Both Draco and Harry nodded. “Thank you both,” she smiled at them.
Harry laughs, ‟of course he does, it´s what he uses to grow. Well, that and every nutrient that goes into my body.” He stands slowly, ‟only one more exam,” he mutters to himself as he stalks off to his bedroom to collect his notes. He looks longingly towards the bed.
I don't know if they are going to go much faster, but I will mainly focus on the differences in the story now that Draco and Snape are both in the game! The things we all know will be summarised because, well, it's boring to reread that shit.
‟It´s not that hard,” Draco says, ‟I did do some cooling before.” Harry lifts an eyebrow sceptically. ‟Okay, I helped Leo once, when I went over for dinner with him and his parents.”
Then suddenly he felt something on the back of his neck, he fell forward, seeing the brother and sister advancing on him, he yelled out, “Impedimenta,” he called. The jinx hit one of them, he sprang to his feet and turned around, Harry saw that Snape and Draco were almost beyond the gate, he saw that someone was attacking Hagrid, casting spell after spell. He decided that helping Hagrid would be acceptable, Harry would never let anyone hurt his friend, even if a murderer was running away. He ran to the two who were attacking Hagrid. One he stupefied, however, the other managed to move away, blocking his spells. Then he suddenly remembered the one spell, for enemies, that he had read in the book. He could try it, after all, who was more his enemies than the one attacking his friend. He called out “sectumsempra,” and watched as the brother was hurt, slicing his abdomen.
Draco looked through the clothing, “I think you are right,” he said, “or, I think these are the robes that have been passed through generations.” A lot of the robes resembled that which Harry and he had worn to the Yule Ball, but there were also muggle suits and western robes. He looked at Harry and back to the clothing. “You should wear something from it,” he suggested, “I was going to give you something of mine because you don’t have anything that you could wear to a formal meeting, but now you can.”
‟Yeah,” Harry smiles, ‟it´s all very interesting. It´s why I want to focus on that. Maybe look into writing a teaching book. One that can be used through all the years. We could really have used that in our hectic years.” Draco snorts nodding.
“And Voldemort self must do it himself, Severus." Dumbledore said, not answering Snape's question, "It is essential. It is the only way.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, smiling. She ushers him to the head of the table, sending Draco to the opposite side. The rest she let pick themselves. In the end, Sirius and Remus sit to Harry’s right, Hermione and Ron sitting to his left. Ron and Sirius sitting next to Harry.
After breakfast the group packed their stuff up, all shrinking their trunks and things they were bringing home. They technically didn’t need to bring everything, but there was no use in keeping anything here. Harry did let Darsh’ tank stay, as he had ordered one for Grimmauld place, one even better than he has at Hogwarts. A little before ten the group left for the station, the train leaving at eleven. They commandeered one of the last cabins in the back again. The group spreading out.
Ron´s eyes grow before he gives a short nod, ‟and he makes you happy?” Harry nods, ‟well then that´s all we need ain´t it. It´s your life Harry, and if he makes you happy then that´s the only thing that is important.” Harry stares at him, unbelieving. ‟If you´d told me five years ago I´d probably have punched you, granted. But, Harry, I´ve changed, you´ve changed. Everyone has changed, that I was too full of grief to see that for Malfoy doesn´t mean it hasn´t happened.”
When both arms were covered, they reached out to the other, hands connecting between them. They stayed like that for what seemed hours. Until the light of the string was so bright that they both had trouble seeing, but they kept looking into each other's eyes.
The wedding ceremony would take place in the gardens of the house. There was a beautiful wrought iron archway that had been decorated with Lilly’s and Narcissus’ on the top, dark green and Bordeaux red ribbons spiralling down.
Draco stood there, still, unmoving before Harry’s two best friends. Hermione was the first one to come to him. “So,” she said, “do you love him?” she asked.
“Oh,” Luna said, “I hadn’t thought about it yet. I do think it’s a good skill to have. Are the lessons any good?” Draco nodded. “Then I do, thank you for asking me.”
“I can’t believe we really just came in our pants.” He snickered, “like a couple of horny teenagers.”
They were led down steps, bringing them to a small room. It was dark, the lack of light making it harder to look at. Dean and Griphook were thrown into the room first, Ron and Harry followed.
“Do you want Ron and Hermione to explain as well?” he asked, the man nodded. “I am free till the beginning of the semester, but I imagine we could even find a way to talk during.”
The brunette hit him on his arm, pointedly ignoring the reaction of his friends, telling them they were only taking a nap. The others looked sceptical, and Harry just gave up.  “Did we miss anything interesting today?” Harry asked.
“It’s the old Black family townhouse,” Draco said, “though nothing is like it used to be,” he shuddered, “let’s say there used to be decapitated house-elf heads on every wall.” Luna looked at them with disgust. Harry nodded in understanding.
They once again went into the pensive, to see Slughorn standing there, though with an impressive amount of hair, as today's Slughorn had no hair on his head. Around Slughorn sat a group of mid-teens. Harry recognised Riddle immediately, he was the most relaxed of all the boys, his arm resting upon the arm of his chair. With the jolt, Harry recognised the ring on his finger. He had already killed his father.
“I know mate, that’s why it’s now or never,” Ron said, slightly out of breath. Harry knew what he meant but they could end that war tonight. He wished he too could kiss his husband, but that was not in the cards now.
Their kiss turned more heated on the bed, though no passion was lost in it. They pulled away for mere seconds when they needed a small breath. They soon lost their ties and shirt. Draco lying between Harry’s leg, much as they had their first date together. It wasn’t soon before both boys were only in their briefs, erections prominent.
Even though the two boys would have loved to stay for much longer, they both realised that they had to go back to their dorms. People would be too worried if the boys stayed away for much longer. Harry walked Draco back to his common room, they kissed softly before parting, both going to their respective friends.
“I’ll wear the locket, and your pouch,” Hermione said, “Ron, hold his clothes, we need to be able to run if something comes out of the dark” Harry nodded at this, handing the two things to Hermione,
Harry shook his head, “I’m going to sit with Draco,” he said. Seamus seemed to contemplate this for a minute but just shrugged at it. Harry followed Draco to the Slytherin table. He sat next to Draco, not long after Daphne and who he guessed to be Astoria sat in front of him.
‟Harry,” Hermione says cautiously, ‟don´t you think it´s a bit soon to marry someone you´ve been dating since January?”
“Remus,” it was Molly that broke the silence, “did you and Sirius manage to clean another room? Else Fleur will have to sleep in the same room as Ginny,” this caused Ginny to pull a sour face.
She gives him a smile, and Harry feels tears prick in his eyes. ‟Are you sure that you want to sell this?” Draco asks, ‟you´ve kept this for a reason.”
“I think that’ll change when we live here though,” Draco answered, “we’ll put up some art, buy a rug, make it more personal by adding our own things.” Harry nodded. “We’ll live in it, and the emotion will come from there.” Narcissa had moved away from the bedroom, looking through the other rooms.
The bushy-haired woman cocks her head before extracting her hand from the ginger and extending it. “Hey Harry, my name is Hermione.” She points at the ginger, “that is Ron. We’re your best friends.”
“I didn’t get to finish my potions essay, Harry said he’d help me,” Ron called out to Seamus and the rest, they nodded and went out.
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, keep the focus on my magic on the Malfoy family.” The scroll and their strings glow bright, only the light of the scroll dimming. Narcissa grabs it and places it on the side.
“Sue me for not wanting to see them snog all the time,” Ron said, “I know way too much about their sex life as it is.” The group laughed.
Only after boys calmed down did they let go of their strong hold of each other, but they didn’t move from one another, leaning against each other for support. When they looked at the table in front of them, they saw a bottle and two glasses had once again appeared, it seemed that the room not only thought they needed it but also thought they were allowed now that it was weekend. Harry filled both glasses, passing one to Draco. “Cheers,” he said, leaning over to give Draco a small kiss, “to a better life.”
‟Put it on the ground for now?” Harry suggests, and Draco nods, putting it between the speakers. Harry connects the chords and plugs them in. Draco picks out a random record giving it to Harry with a smile. It´s the queens greatest hits, ‟you know this?” Harry asks while he puts it in.
“It means handsome, but also when the moon just becomes visible,” Harry said, smiling. “It fits him don’t you think?”
It was early in the morning when he heard sounds coming from Hermione’s room. He heard Ron’s voice as well. They must have slept in the same room, not wanting to be alone. Harry walked down the stairs, the ones he had walked so many times. When he looked at one of the doors that led to a room that had not been renovated yet. In the dark, he had not noticed, and the many times he had walked past it before he was always walking towards something, rarely looking through the room.
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed a box from the pile. It had a star on the top and “Converse” printed in large letters on the side. “Er,” he said. “This is…”
“Just testing the reactions,” Malfoy said, but he did finally put the cock down and took up the quill again.
"It's pretty brilliant, really. I've been experimenting with sex toys. Nothing ready for the masses yet, though."
Harry laughed, working his own hand down the front of Malfoy's trousers and giving his cock a squeeze.
Malfoy looked between the two of them, then a slow smirk spread across his face, spelling trouble plain as day. “Well luckily for both of us, Healer-patient confidentiality doesn’t apply to fake cocks,” Malfoy said. He leaned back in his chair and stretched his legs out under the table. His feet bumped into Harry’s and he didn’t apologize.
Admitting his ignorance seemed to mollify Malfoy somewhat. “Well, I suggest when you get back you submit this Containment Receptacle for examination. Whatever blithering idiot,” And here he aimed another sharp look at Harry which was, frankly, uncalled for, “poked a bunch of holes in this may have damaged the charmwork.”
"Oh my god," he said, desperately scanning the rest of the card. There had to be some way to undo that.
“You didn’t save me a cup?” Harry was a little offended. He absolutely would have saved Ron a cup. Apparently he was a better best friend than Ron was. So was Hermione. She would have saved him a cup. Hermione could be his best friend from now on, Harry decided.
Harry sighed a bit to himself as she left. He looked at the cock. He looked at the stack of paperwork. He looked at the cock again. He looked at the clock on his wall. It was five til, and there was no way Harry was staying overtime to get this done. Everything would be waiting for him bright and early tomorrow morning. He would just take care of it then.
It gave him plenty to think about, back in his cubicle that afternoon. The way he figured it, one of two things was true. Either Malfoy had no idea he didn’t need to fill out form 68-J in its entirety for every fake cock, which Harry rapidly dismissed because Malfoy seemed to be remarkably fastidious in his work. Or, he knew he didn’t have to fill out form 68-J in its entirety every time, but did it anyhow as an excuse to force Harry to spend roughly an hour with him one on one with each new cock.
Luckily, CopyCocks Five and Six showed up on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and each one was increasingly excited to make Harry’s acquaintance. CopyCock Five shivered eagerly whenever he spoke; CopyCock Six liked him so much that the bloody thing maintained an erection simply from being in the same room with him.
Of course Arthur was happy. He hadn't just received a replica of his own penis. Because Harry had known at a glance that the penis in the hat was
A shrug. "Polyjuice. Easy enough to get your hair, or any Auror's really. Either you're laid up at St Mungo's or I see you at a pub night."
A slip of folded parchment in the bottom of the box caught Harry’s attention, and he lifted it out and unfolded it.
"Hm. How they expect him to find room for it with that stick shoved so far up his arse…" Malfoy's words trailed off as he reached for the box of gloves.
“You’re honestly trying to tell me that you Aurors are so concerned with being professional?” Pansy asked, rolling her eyes. “Please. I have met Finnegan, you know.”
Malfoy made a face. "Point taken. But it's true that I like big things… like… vo-cab-u-la-ry." And at that, Malfoy picked up the new stripey cock and gave it a brief wank.
When Harry got the memo from Rosemary on Tuesday morning, alerting him to a new cock at the British Museum, he pondered just leaving it there. The case was
. Her revenge on Williamson (a truly demonic bit of shift scheduling which the sods in WR insisted was legal but still left him unable to determine what day or time it was for a month) after he'd complained about her not getting him a file quickly enough was still the stuff of legend.
The cock came loose far easier than he expected, and Harry wasn’t braced for it. His wet trainers slipped on the bronze and he didn’t have a good handhold. Harry knew better than to hope that no one had captured a picture of him losing his grip on the wizard and toppling back onto his arse with a splash, CopyCock Number Four clutched valiantly in his hand. At this point, he only hoped it wouldn’t end up in the
"Sex on St Mungo's tables is a no-go. Got it." And then he blushed, because there was flirting and there was
A penis that was fucking with him, Harry, specifically, as it was laid out neatly at the Ministry Apparition Point. Right off the Atrium.
Harry just smiled. The vocabulary expanding kick had actually come about two years ago, and hadn’t gone much further than word-a-day calendars for everyone each Christmas. But Hermione’s vocabulary was formidable enough that the dictionary thing was entirely plausible.
After a short detour for a nice bracing cuppa, Harry set the box in the middle of his desk and closed his office door very firmly. He took a sip, then another sip, then decided it’d be best to get this over with. Dawdling only prolonged his misery. Harry set his mug aside and opened up the box. Removed the glossy instruction card and set it aside as well. Then with a swish of his wand he lifted the cock from its cushioning and levitated it gently to sit on the edge of his desk beside the other cock he’d found.
The call for the third cock of the week came in just before Harry left for lunch on Friday. Still blissfully ignorant of what was to come, Harry took it as a bit of well-deserved serendipity when the location turned out to be the Apparition Point near that new Indian place he’d been meaning to try. Even when he got there and realized he’d forgotten to bring along a Containment Receptacle, his good mood didn’t waver. He just took out the foil box his lunch came in and used the paper takeaway bag to pick up the cock and transport it back to the Ministry.
connecting with Ron's shin. Or at least he thought he had. Ron was clutching his stomach and tears were rolling down his face from laughter rather than from pain. Even Hermione was laughing, the traitor.
,” Harry snapped again. Really, how could someone possibly be this insulting and obnoxious without even realizing the full extent of it? Then again, Harry supposed he and Malfoy had always had a sort of sixth sense for getting under each other’s skin, a strangely preternatural ability to tell when a particular jab was hitting its mark and really pissing off the other one.
Harry could feel the blood rushing to his face, what blood wasn't headed south, that is, and he coughed, eyes skittering around the room. "You're the one mishandling evidence."
He rolled his head to the side as his gaze slid toward the cocks. The Cockmonster looked even more monstrous from this vantage point, towering above him like some sort of horrible throbbing monolith. He didn't think he had a shoebox big enough to transport it, and he was
Seamus whistled, and Harry glanced over at Ron, who had edged away from the cocks and was staring at them with an odd expression on his face.
Hermione snorted, and then she coughed and quickly smoothed her expression. "What a horrible thing to do."
Harry decided the best course of action was to ignore the both of them or they’d get caught up in a conversation about the outlandishly outdated forms that churned sluggishly through the Ministry’s official channels. Which, fair point. Some of it was ridiculously antiquated and the ones that required being filled out in triplicate especially were an astronomical waste of time. But. Mrs Periweather. Persimmon. Harry plunged onward in his tale of woe. “So there I am, neck-deep in paperwork when there comes a knock on my door. And do you know who it was?”
ask questions after the big fuss with Kingsley, and as far as Harry had been able to determine, his trace was lost somewhere in the Department of Mysteries. Only one thing was wrong. "Hermione's not an Unspeakable. She works on Level One. For Kingsley."
Cock now as clean as he could get it, Harry crumpled the paper napkin and tossed it into the bin before he began to distractedly shovel forkfuls of vindaloo into his mouth while shuffling through his paperwork, filling out his portion of form 68-J with the location the latest cock had been found and when the call had come in.
“Coriander!” Malfoy snapped at him, irritated, like Harry was supposed to know what the bloody fuck that meant.
Harry had a moment to be grateful that he'd managed to get Malfoy shoved up against the wall, because leaning in on him was really rather brilliant. Much better way of flirting, snogging up against the wall like a normal human being, than sending fake cocks by the dozen.
and refused to let it go. Harry managed to pull himself together enough to threaten, “If you do, I’ll be forced to give them an interview about all the cocks. I’ll be sure to mention the bang-up job the on-duty Healer at St Mungo’s is doing, examining them. Very thoroughly examining them.”
It was all a bit much to take in. Harry wasn't going to fool himself; the… camaraderie he'd come to enjoy with Malfoy would end if he stopped this here. And, he really didn't want to. Didn't want to lose it. Didn't want to stop.
The cock tapped forlornly against the glass side of the canister until Harry reluctantly took it from Malfoy. The cock pressed itself up against the glass that separated it from his palm. Harry sighed. Bad Cock Corner was nowhere near enough distance for him with this one. But he thought he had some Peruvian Instant Darkness powder that might do the trick. He could pour some into the canister. Out of sight, out of mind. Right? The cock began to rub itself against the glass, and Harry gave Malfoy a plaintive look.
"They don't turn off for three hours unless you want to… get them there. Which I'm not doing. Have fun with that."
Rosemary's shout brought his head up quickly enough his neck twinged, and he stood and raced around his desk to the door. Looking around the department, it all seemed completely normal, and he frowned. "What's up?"
Ron keeping his mouth shut was too much to hope for. Hermione would know, which meant Ginny. Which meant George. Which meant that by the time pudding was served, the entire table would know it was
Harry could only watch in horror as Arthur pulled a hat out from under his chair, reaching in and pulling out…. Oh, god.
“I’m not,” Harry began, still backing away. “I can’t, I don’t have gloves on.” It was fairly thin, so far as excuses went. But it might delay what Harry now miserably suspected was the inevitable. At least by a minute or two. He’d take anything at this point.
When he finished, he left the hot kettle under a Stasis Spell and returned to the doorway to take another peek across the hall. Still nothing much to see, just the continued scurrying of red- and blue-robed figures. Harry watched for a minute or so, then wandered back to his office and his pointless paperwork. He'd made it through another three pages when there came a knock on the door.
"Potter." Malfoy gave him the briefest of nods before crossing to the exam table and reaching for the stack of parchment.
Rosemary was nominally part of DMLE, one of the Secretaries to the Undersecretary or something. Ministry positions and hierarchy had always given him a headache. But she'd been shuffled to Apparition when the former Secretary had come down with Vanishing Sickness and they'd not been able to find her for six months, and by then Rosemary was as much a part of the Department as the Apparition Rings used in the Hogwarts Exams.
, yes, that was a nice safe word for it. And it seemed rather rude to be handling some other person’s bits without permission, even if he was handling them with the intention of reuniting them with their missing owner. Rosemary could’ve warned him about this. He’d at least have brought gloves. Maybe tongs. Or something. Didn’t the Apparition department have some sort of protocol in place for situations like this? If they didn’t, they certainly ought to. Harry might institute it himself when he got done here. Absolutely bloody ridiculous, sending him off armed with a shoebox and a stack of paperwork.
Harry looked around his desk, then around his office, but saw nothing that immediately leapt out at him as a potential source for the strange sound. He was just about to dismiss it as his ears playing tricks on him when the sound came again, and this time it didn’t stop. And the source of it…
Apparition was empty when he arrived, which, after years in the never-quiet Auror Department, made him feel off-balance and wary. He passed Rosemary's desk, and then opened the door to his office. "Arthur?"
“...a Containment Receptacle for Acute Preservation of Accidentally Splinched Specimens,” Rosemary said, staring him down.
Although, all things considered, Apparating Mrs Periweather and Persimmon to and from the groomers wasn't too bad a trade for weekend lie-ins, either. Especially when his bed was so comfortable.
listens to my Harpies gossip. And Seamus always tries to get info for the betting pool." Ginny took a big gulp of beer, turning back to Harry. "Did she hit you hard? Kneazle scars? Pooped on?"
After the flirting, it was pretty clear what his goal was. And Harry couldn’t deny that it’d rather worked.
“The frightening part is,” Malfoy said after considering that for a moment. “I’ve no idea if you’re joking or not.”
"Yep. And we wanted you to know, Harry, that we support you, and your cocks, completely. It's why I made you the cockboard. It's like a caseboard, but cocks."
He hadn’t bothered to ask Rosemary for more detailed instructions because if she hadn’t offered them, he figured he wouldn’t need them. And indeed he didn’t.
Rosemary sighed, shoulders slumping. "Be a dear and put the kettle on, would you? I've got a feeling I'll need it by the time I'm finished," she told Harry before nodding to the Auror and following him over to MLE, her chin up and her shoulders squared.
Ron and Seamus glanced sideways at each other, then broke out in laughter. "Cocks. Best thing that happened to Level Two in centuries."
"Wilkie Twycross has been Apparating Mrs Periweather and Persimmon to and from their appointments for the past thirty years. That's several generations, all named Persimmon, mind, and Mrs Periweather isn't going to let a little thing like a shift in employment stop her from going to her groomers every week.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh, and Malfoy aimed a sour look at him. It probably would’ve been a lot more effective if he’d been able to fight back his smile all the way. Eventually he gave in and chuckled, rubbing a hand across his forehead.
Was this flirting? It felt a bit like flirting. But this was also Malfoy. And Malfoy plus flirting just didn’t add up.
“Right,” said Harry, his desire for this conversation to come to an end outweighing his desire to argue with Malfoy. “I’ll be sure to do that.”
When he finally shuffled his way to the front of the line, he didn't even have time to open his mouth before the Welcome Witch flicked a bored glance at the box in his hands and said, "Spell Damage, fourth floor."
take over teaching the classes.” He picked up the kettle and found it empty. “What the hell? You just made this.”
“Know what else they’ve got down in Apparition?” Harry said, eyeing Ron’s mug and trying to work out whether he could get away with swiping it. “Rosemary.”
The Patrolman on the scene coughed, and Harry shot him a dirty look. He didn't want to say anything. He didn't want to touch it. The memory of the most recent cockhead pressed forlornly against the glass of the specimen jar on the shelf behind him, attempting to peer through the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, or worse, tapping for Harry's attention from its place in Bad Cock Corner whilst Harry sat very still and very quiet until it stopped, was enough to make anyone cautious.
“Imagine this,” said Harry, leaning back in his chair. He set his glass down with a decisive thunk. “I am in my office, my very tiny office. My very very tiny office that makes my Auror cubicle look bloody enormous. I am at my desk, trying to sort through Apparition Applications. Do you have any idea how ridiculous the application form is if you don’t get licensed through a school?”
He ran to the stairwell, ducking inside and hurrying up a flight to Spell Damage. The witch blinked at him, but before she could comment, he broke in "I need a room, this is on fire."
in charge of any sex toys coming to the Ministry." Malfoy’s foul mood took an obvious and swift turn towards giddy, and Harry had to quash the desire to punch the stupid smug expression right off his stupid git face.
He'd never realized how busy St Mungo's could be on a Wednesday morning. The Welcome Witch's desk was surrounded. There was a tired looking man holding a toddler who seemed to be belching fire every twenty seconds. An elderly pair of witches were supporting a third, who was clutching a viney plant and whose skin was beginning to turn green. A large family was standing to one side, each clutching a vial and with steam coming out their ears. A crup was barking and straining at its leash to make brief lunges at a pair of teenagers sitting on the floor eating pasties.
"You fucking wanker!" Harry pushed away, feeling Malfoy's fingers scrabble against his open robe. He gave Malfoy’s trousers a jerk, and stared down at the cock he'd seen eight times before.
Malfoy gave him another glare, then upended the hat so that the cock flopped onto the exam table. “Well,” he said, frowning. “It’s certainly quite a bit
"Hey, it's your job now. Take one of those, too." Rosemary pointed at the listing stack of boxes beside the door. "We keep them charmed with Impervius; we use them for specimen transport."
welcome to the department. Though I have to give you credit, you make my tea better than Twycross ever did."
She said that last part a little bit too brightly, and it set Harry’s nerves immediately on edge. "What's interesting about Tuesday?"
“So what you’re telling me,” Harry said, trying to force his hands to stop clenching into fists, “is that you’ve lost my evidence.”
, he remembered a drunken Hermione informing him and the entirety of the bar several nights previous), even
Luckily, he didn't need to wait on Ministry bureaucracy to tell him where Malfoy lived. He'd been there in the past, at a party that Pansy had thrown to celebrate Dean's promotion. He knew just the Apparition point to use.
Harry made sure he was at work on time Friday morning, bearing a mochaccino and muffin for Rosemary. He caught her mid-yawn, and she waggled her fingers at him before stretching a hand out for the coffee. "Offering accepted," she grinned. "How's Hogwarts?"
. Usually he gave the impression of arguing for the sake of arguing, but Harry wasn't going to underestimate just how universally hated Bartram was, so it probably made a strange kind of sense.
It was even worse now that Harry knew exactly who he'd be spending those few hours with. The only consolation was that Malfoy was the one who'd have to fill out form 68-J in its entirety. That was nearly enough to make Harry feel sorry for the bastard.
That earned him another slow blink. “Yes. Well. As you were told via memo, we’re looking into it. I see here that request 7258-12 was flagged for priority analysis and sent down to the Unspeakables for a trace. They tell me they never received it.”
Harry aimed another kick at him, and hit the chair leg this time instead. Even though Harry hid his wince this time, the amused look Ron sent him said that Ron knew exactly what had just happened.
Rosemary wasn't that bad, Harry told himself repeatedly as he carried a box of his things to the Apparition Department. She could be nice. Cheerful. Jolly. Perky. Ebullient. Chirpy. Harry grimaced and resolved to send Hermione a very sternly worded owl about the word a day calendars she insisted on giving him every Christmas.
The week after that he was called to collect yet another cock and found that it was identical to the previous two. Maybe a little quicker to respond to stimuli than the other two lookalikes, but other than being a little more sensitive it was the same in every way Harry could tell.
"I. You. No." Harry felt he should add more to it, a stronger denial, but his brain rather shut down.
He could literally watch the gears shift, as Ron went from arsehole best mate to trained Auror. "Makes sense. If it really was that exact. Unless it's someone who has been up close and personal with your bits. You think any of your exes could do it?"
Harry shot a Sticking Charm at the specimen jar to keep it from toppling to the ground, and then turned and walked away, feeling overwhelmed and done. Heads were popping over cubicle walls all over the department, and Seamus ran up breathlessly behind him. "What was that?"
Malfoy returned his attention to the matter at hand. He briskly filled out another page of paperwork, then took out his wand again and turned to the cock in the box.
“Not for a while. I’m on holiday for the next two weeks,” Malfoy said. “Any more penises you find before then? Someone else’s problem.”
"Sort of?" Harry tried to say, though it came out rather like a question. Technically he was new to Apparition, though not to the Ministry, and didn't feel like explaining the circumstances that'd landed him in this new (and temporary, Harry reminded himself, very
“Hm,” he said, turning to Harry. “This is very odd. Judging from how it reacted to simply being transported here, I assumed it was highly sensitive. But I’m not getting nearly the reaction… oh. Well. This is interesting.”
There was indeed a way to undo it, Harry discovered unhappily. There were three ways. The instruction card assured him that the cocks would respond 'realistically' to 'manual stimulation.' Which. No. No way. Option two was another charm Harry could activate that'd ensure the cocks would 'come' when he did. Which. Also no. Absolutely not. The third option was to simply leave them be. The card informed him that the Extra-Strength Endurance Charms would ensure him three hours of continuous use after which the cocks would return to their inactive states on their own.
There was, of course, another penis. A penis that, to Harry’s dismay, looked exactly like the line of six on his desk. A penis that looked like the penis in the darkened specimen jar in the Bad Cock Corner. A penis he’d
Malfoy sighed, and Harry felt a pang of sympathy as Malfoy summoned a quill and started filling them in. "As well you shouldn’t, I suppose," he said without looking up. “Granger’s rather difficult to ignore. And you…” He glanced briefly up at Harry before returning his attention to the stack of forms. “Well,” he said as if that was all that was to be said about that.
He could tell when Malfoy got close: his mouth went slack against Harry’s, and his hand on Harry’s cock stuttered and then stalled. Harry redoubled his efforts, sliding one hand between Malfoy's back and the wall and down, rubbing firmly down his crack to press against his hole.
Malfoy shoved the cock away from his face and laughed. "All right. All right. Yes I did. I didn't expect you to come here, though."
"What I don't understand is why they needed eight Obliviators. And why didn't anyone Obliviate me? I'm the one who saw Mr Smythe naked in his tub. Who takes a bath at half two, anyway?"
Harry sighed again as he waited his turn for the Floo. He rather wished Rosemary would do more explaining and less ominous cackling. One would be useful. The other was just annoying. Really, it was enough to make Harry miss Kingsley and his stern looks.
A bunch of daisies sat in a vase by the Welcome Witch’s desk. As subtly as he was able, Harry sidled up, cast a discreet Duplicating Charm, and then jammed the erect cock down amongst the blossoms. Muriel was on duty again this morning, and she gave Harry a sidelong glance but otherwise didn’t pause in directing a young witch with a Venomous Tentacula tangled in her hair up to the third floor. Harry fluffed the flowers around the CopyCock to hide it as much as possible, nodded good morning to Muriel, and walked to the lifts.
Harry was whistling when he arrived at the Ministry that morning. A visit to the tea room for tea for himself and Rosemary left him feeling ready to face the three-inch stack of Lost and Found forms, and an extra Cushioning Charm on his chair left him feeling sneakily decadent and like all was well with the world. He even grinned fondly at the cock on the corner of his desk. Telling his friends about it had kept them buying his pints all evening.
Seamus leaned slightly, before he reached around Harry and stole another biscuit. "Nah. You're nowhere near closing this case. It's fine."
“You can do that?” Ron asked, though he was smiling, “I thought there was only one person that should help with the ceremony.”
They went to Gringotts, Ron transformed into a more rugged version, Harry could see the Ron beneath it, but only because he knew how he looked. Harry and Griphook were under the invisibility cloak.
Harry hesitates, ‟yeah,” he says with a soft smile. His hand goes to where their son is growing, ‟we´re getting a son.”
Draco chuckled, “I think we do both deserve a nice nap,” he said. “Though you gotta stand up because we’re both still in our court clothes and that won’t be very nice after we had a nap,” Harry grumbled something incoherently but he did listen. He removed his clothes only pulling on a t-shirt, the air too cold to sleep solely in his briefs. He looked over to see that Draco had done the same, lying back on the bed so Harry can resume his position.
“It’s great that Sirius and Remus are going to be our teachers,” Hermione said when they sat down, “I can’t wait to learn from them. I mean Remus was the most competent DADA teacher we had all six years.” This god nods all around the group.
‟She mentioned he was her cousin once,” Neville tells Harry, ‟But I´ve never seen them interact before.” There´s a smile on his face, ‟he looks actually interested.”
“Draco,” McGonagall said, the boy in question standing beside her with a pleasant smile, though a mask, “you were a handful when you were younger. You have always been one of the smartest people I had the pleasure to teach. You showed leadership skills, you showed your ingenuity and your wit. Maybe not always at the best of times, and largely against those now your friends and husband. But you have and always will be a resourceful man. You will be a great leader for your family and your company. Surrounded by your friends and family I hope you will have a great life. And I expect you to visit our castle many times.” Draco smiled his true smile at that, nodding his head in agreement.
He knew he shouldn’t be avoiding Ginny, he should just talk to her. He just didn’t know how he had to explain it to someone and he needed advice, but he could hardly ask Ron. Asking Hermione was out of the question, as she would only use the conversation to find out more about what he has been doing. So it seemed he was doomed to just avoiding Ginny till he found a way to break up with a girl he never even dated.
Neville wasted no time, grabbing her hand to kiss it. “Lady Malfoy,” he said when he straightened his back, “the pleasure is all mine. I agree that these are not the most fortunate of circumstances.”
Sirius spoke up, “so, tell us, when did you guys perform the bonding? I do hope you two didn’t perform the bond at school.”
The group sat down. “I read the verdict in the papers,” Blaise said, “how you feel about that?” he looked at Draco.
They walked into the room dressed to a T like they always were. The group fell silent when they realized who had walked in. The two didn’t let it deter them, walking towards Draco and Harry, who had stood up to greet their friends. They kissed Blaise and Pansy both twice on their cheeks, pulling them in a short hug before releasing them.
Ron and Hermione walked in while Harry was reading the letter. When he finished, he looked up to see them standing there. “What you got there, mate?” Ron asked.
“Well, I saw this cute hognose snake in Hogsmeade, and I was thinking of adopting it? But I want to ask the others before I do, because, some people have very bad memories about snakes, for obvious reasons.”
The two feelings, conflicting as they were, made sense to him when he came back. He was lying spread eagle on the floor. The intense agony Draco felt, conflicting such pain, even though he knew he had to, was strong enough to come to Harry. But the anger was part of Harry as well, though he knew this was Voldemort.
“I need to find something. I hoped this could’ve been avoided. But Voldemort is coming. He is on his way. I knew he would come here, I wanted to be done before he came, but it seemed he is faster than I anticipated.” Harry said. “We’re here for something, we need to find it before Voldemort gets a hold of it.”
Draco nodded, “yeah, I just needed to actually process it. Thanks for helping.” Harry shrugged, saying he would always try and help. Draco smiled pulling him in for a soft kiss. They parted after a few seconds, Harry lying his head down on Draco’s chest. “We should probably go to the common room before the group starts to wonder where we are.”
“I agree,” she said, “a lot of our more valuable items are already in our vaults, but there are some things that couldn’t be in the vault, and some that were items we still used, or would be too insulting to remove.” She looked at her son, “so we agree, we have to go there.” Draco nodded, Narcissa turning to Harry, “would you come? I think Draco and I would both feel better to have you there. However, do not feel you have to if you do not feel comfortable.”
Harry had been distracted during the class, though his mind now wondering about other things than the darkness that had plagued him in the night. He was focused on the question Hermione had asked him. No, he didn't want to be an Auror, but what did he want to be?
‟A lady doesn´t kiss and tell,” she says. Harry looks towards her seeing the tight clothing. ‟But if you must know, I have a date.”
He was only really worried about all the Weasleys that were still working and walking about in the world. Throughout one week there were three dementor attacks, and they only seemed to increase. One boy, the little brother of some girls in Gryffindor, had been bitten and killed by Fenrir. And it only seemed to happen more and more.
“I hope Dumbledore works it out soon,” Harry says. “We need to talk with him about this now, especially since we need to at least find the Horcrux.” Draco nodded. “Next week,” he said, “we'll talk with Dumbledore. After all, we need to find a way to make it seem as you aren’t working for us, so we need to fight you all, but we also need you to succeed.”
When it was time for the count down Harry fondly looked at his family, everyone he cared about was present right there. Draco grabbed his hand, squeezing lightly, Harry squeezing back smiling widely. The group counted down loudly, most standing next to their partner.
‟Next week perhaps,” Harry says while he pushes himself up. He drapes himself across and amused Draco´s lap. ‟We have better things to do now.”
Harry looked around, seeing others doing the same. Some were staring hard into their hoops, people trying to concentrate. Harry looked at the stone inside the hoop, working hard to focus. Trying to think of nothing else besides the hoop.
“Family vaults,” Harry repeated. “If I didn’t have access to my family vaults, then what did I own?”
“Maybe,” Harry said, “because my first friend said they were going to be in Gryffindor. So, I wanted to be in there as well.”
This jump-started a story about the lessons they had, Hermione giving them copies of all her notes of the day. She summarized the lessons. When Hermione moved on to the lessons only Draco followed he turned to Ron, only to see the boy curled up, sleeping Crookshanks lying on his lap. He gave an amused smile, turning to his other friends.
“All that’s left is payment,” the man said, walking back to the counter. Harry paid, before thanking the shopkeeper again. “It was great meeting you mister Potter. I hope you are happy with your purchase.”
“Who knew that the great Harry Potter was a sucker for cuddles,” Draco laughed, turning to encircle Harry with his arms.
“What are you two talking about?” Remus asked hearing his name. He sat the pan with Curry on the table.
"So Harry is traumatized by kneazles and Ron's snorted his beer in the first hour being here. Sounds like a party." Ginny held her glass out to Hermione, who rolled her eyes but grinned as she clinked it. "Seriously, though. This is so much more entertaining than the usual Auror gossip you spend the first hour with."
Harry spun around, taking in Hermione's amused expression from where she stood in the doorway. There was a thunk, and the volume of Rosemary's laughter increased and Harry closed his eyes and took a breath, wishing once again that this wasn't his life.
“It’s all right, mate,” Ron said, misinterpreting Harry’s wince. “I’m sure you’re doing very important work in Apparition.”
Harry groaned, and Hermione shot him a questioning look. "68-J. An inch-high stack of parchment I need to take to St Mungo's sot some poor healer in Spell Damage can tell me that the cock isn't real. Supposedly for Splinching cases, but apparently for suspected and potential Splinching as well."
