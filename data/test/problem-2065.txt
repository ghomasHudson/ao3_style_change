"I am not a charity case!" Astoria snapped sharply. "I came here with a proposition. One that benefits us both! You are well aware that your chances of courting an eligible witch are slim to none. And I certainly have no desire to become trapped in yet another marriage, where I am nothing but a trophy wife and target of my husband's ire if he feels so inclined! The Malfoy name needs an heir, and I need a purpose beyond looking pretty."
The Malfoys seemed downright shocked by the number of Gryffindors, and the Ravenclaw on their doorstep and Harry too had trouble swallowing around the lump in his throat. Weakly, he protested, "Guys, you don't have to …"
Somehow, even years after attending Hogwarts, the reprobative look of the school librarian had all of them scramble to obey. Harry nearly fell out of the floo, and only thanks to his partner's fast reflexes did he not faceplant on Narcissa's blue carpet. Shuddering, Neville whispered, "This feels too much like gran's rooms. The only difference is everything being blue instead of beige."
"That we could make it work. That we could put time and effort into creating the life we had always wanted. And then we decided that it was not what we wanted any longer. She's happy as a chaser, and now she is even happier with Justin. Her life is so much better than it could have ever been with me and that's okay. I want her to be happy more than I want her by my side."
"This feels a lot like Morgana's magic," the last descendant of the Pendragon and Emrys bloodlines mumbled, after entering. He frowned, looking around the room that had served Voldemort as his base of operations the last few years of the war.
Hermione clenched her jaw. It was horrible to see the once so proud Lord reduced to begging. Yet, she was well aware that Lucius knew of at least two cells they had investigated, so all was not lost. Still, she had to coax him out of the soft, warm bed, whispering comfortingly, "It's okay, Lucius. Harry is here. We just have to help him to find us. Let's take the blanket and relocate you to the other mattress."
"Between 7:30 and 10:40, is this when … this happened?" Harry gestured towards the split lip the young Lady was sporting.
"But …" True, languages were powerful and Latin the most versatile to suit the European witches and wizards' needs. However, chances were good that Andromeda was right, so … "We'll try alone then."
A cold, deep voice had him pull his wand instinctively. "How dare you invade our dungeons, Gryffindor?"
Draco's glanced to the side before smiling as he tilted his head. "You are welcome. It is easy to find the correct answers if the right questions are asked. You have learned a lot since Hogwarts."
That was actually easy. After a shaky breath, Draco admitted. "Because it was either Astoria or Rosier. And she did not deserve to die. She was innocent in all this, and he was a sadistic bastard!"
"I got him out. Lucius, I mean. It's possible that I made a mistake there, but you should have seen Draco when he asked me for help this morning. He was falling apart. Maybe Lucius Malfoy, the Death Eater, deserved the Dementor's Kiss, but Draco's dad didn't. He made mistakes in the past, violent, horrible mistakes, and he needs to pay for them. But killing him would achieve nothing. Certainly not for his family. And I refuse, after everything he had done in the end, to believe him beyond redemption.
The elf's glare made very clear what he thought of the wizard with the knack of saying the obvious, before carefully placing the child in Harry's arms. It was about the size of a new-born kitten, and for a second the raven-haired was scared that he would squish it or hurt it in some way. But when Kreacher simply adjusted his hands to accommodate the tiny thing, he relaxed. "How? … When? … Why didn't you tell me?" Harry stammered, unable to tear his eyes away from the adorable, tiny face.
Then they could not keep their composure any longer. The moment the little she-fox jumped into a heap of snow, only to return to her new owner excitedly moments later, shuffling some snow along to play with, both burst into laughter. After hugging each other, Harry stated, "Thank you for taking the time. Ron said Inari is nigh unmanageable when Draco is not around."
The situation from last night seemed to have resolved itself naturally. Neither did Lucius glare at him over the breakfast table nor did Draco act notably subdued, on the contrary. The blond had an animated discussion with his mother, about a book on blood-magic he had found in the library. On the one hand, Harry asked himself how much time the Slytherin actually spent on the task he had set him upon. On the other hand, for all he cared, Draco could spend his days reading the entire library, as long as that kept him entertained and away from the Manor. The last week had done the young man a lot of good because although he was still pale, his face had lost the pasty complexion and the rings under his eyes had vanished.
Prepared for his sneaky elf, Harry had kept his back to the door. Now he pushed off and composed a small note. "Give this to Lucius please."
"I need to know what kind of poison this is about," Draco stated one evening during dinner. It was one of the rare occasions that Harry had actually been on time for them to share the meal. Apparently, the week leading up to Yule was high time for smugglers, and the Auror Corp was working themselves to the bones.
,” he gestured dismissive towards Lucius, “out of your sight for even a heartbeat, I’ll fire you faster than you can say Expelliarmus. Are we clear?”
All his life, the patriarch of the Malfoy family had learned to only submit to power. Yet after choosing the wrong side, the former Lord was willing to bow to someone with less money, less social standing − apart from fame − and maybe even less magical power, because he finally understood. There were more important things in life than power. With but a little ambition, Harry Potter would be able to become the leader of their world, and though Lucius doubted that the young wizard had an accordant desire, their world would surely be better off with him as Minister of Magic.
Smiling, Draco explained, "Emerald is convinced that tea should be sorted by the colours of the leaves on the tin. So, I spelled flowers onto the packages. In the beginning, being served tea had a fifty percent chance of receiving chamomile, since she liked the tiny white blossoms so much."
"Not really," Draco shrugged. "The annuals of Malfoy Manor are much more impressive. But I wanted to rid you of the illusion of Grimmauld Place always having been built the way it is now."
"Emerald, …" was the last thing Harry heard from Severus, before the door closed. He wondered how long his partner's spell would hold. Neville certainly seemed irritated enough with him so his magic would trap him far into the night.
Looking from one person to the next, Neville could see their determination to have this threat dealt with. Finally, he looked at Harry. It was a high price he was asking his friend to put on the table. They would do everything in their power to protect Draco. But they both knew, in their line of work, nothing was ever certain. If their positions were reversed, if Luna's life was on the line, Neville was not sure if he could handle that. But his friend, once more, proved more durable than anybody Neville had ever had the fortune of knowing.
Wondering how he had let himself get caught up in such a surreal situation, the former professor leaned over until he was nose to nose with the little girl. "I am a part-time tooth-fairy. I don't need wings. During the day, I work as a Potion Master."
Deciding that it was time for bed, Harry straightened his patient's covers. He barely kept himself from straightening Snape's hair, before he turned to the door. When he passed Draco, he put a gentle hand on his shoulder and contradicted softly. "No, it wasn't. Not for me."
After thorough planning, Neville and Alexander Pince headed for the Ministry. Since nothing could happen before sundown, Leewood requested to analyse Harry's ritual space, giving Severus the opportunity to get the young wizard alone. "Are you available?"
Sneering, the Potion Master replied, "Help a former Death Eater and a convict? No offence, Narcissa, but I can't really see that going over well."
After repairing the hourglasses, McGonagall had called for a staff meeting, where they had decided to separate the Quidditch cup from the House cup. The student body, the Slytherins especially, had been more than pleased.
"Thank you, professor," the couple replied. Handing over the unicorn-hair for safekeeping, Ron chuckled, "You know, most of the time, I forget that Flickwick is part goblin and then he says things like that."
Flinching ever so slightly, when being reminded about the amount of freedom he had been given until now, the blond looked over the journals. He was here as a servant; he had to remind himself once again. And if his master was giving him a task, he ought to be grateful that it was an interesting one. Reaching for the first volume, he leaved through the pages, slowing when he took in the handwriting. "Where did you get these?" He asked quietly but instinctively pulled back when Harry stated coldly, "That is none of your concern. Can you read these or not?"
To say that Narcissa Malfoy was worried would be an understatement. In the beginning, she had been delighted to have her medical expertise requested. It had been a challenge to catch up to the current developments in the field of the treatment of squibs. Also, it had increased her family's reputation in a few circles, thus improving their situation overall. She had studied diligently. Had done everything she could think of to be a good host and had used her mended relationship with her sister to help start up the first day-care for little witches and wizards, be they muggleborn or not. It was a slow-going project. But with the interviews Harry had given to the Daily Prophet and The Quibbler, along with his monthly 'newsletter' in the Lovegoods' magazine, where he mentioned the childcare facility regularly, the popularity of that publication and their service had mounted steadily. By now, they had eight children under their care. Of course, four of them were Weasleys and one her own nephew Edward, but it was a work in progress.
"Are you sure this is what you want?" Molly Weasley inquired, shifting Rose on her arm. "I mean with Hermione and Angelina pregnant … and she and George have just come back from India …"
Lucius groaned blissfully when the hot water loosened muscles that had been knotted for years. Potter had ordered him to follow Neville, while he was talking to one of his colleagues. Though the former Lord was miffed to be cast aside so easily, he had to admit that the first hot shower in nearly four years was unbelievably relaxing. Of course, he hated to be made a vassal, but at least this time his Lord was sane and not hell-bent on ruling the world. Surely Potter had no intentions of harming his family. However, he had boasted about Draco pledging his life to him, and he had taken obvious delight in sharing Narcissa’s fragile state of mind.
"No." Taking a deep breath, calming himself forcibly, Harry explained, "I forced myself into his mind when he tried to teach me Occlumency. It is one of his worst memories because of what happened after."
"Because I am talking to my best friend; more than you are talking to the brother you spend time with ten hours a day."
Not the reaction the young pureblood had expected. Yet Harry looked so relieved at the moment like a huge weight had lifted off his chest. "Do you," he probed, "Do you want to know how I did it?"
"All around?" Harry wondered, "How do we get rid of a spell so huge that blankets the entire building?"
"I have enough money on me. But I can hardly walk into Olivanders with her. No matter how little I like him, Jenkins is right. Narcissa is a convict, hence not allowed to buy a new wand."
Turning around so they could look at the imposing façade, Hermione forced a smile. "No. Come on." Before tugging him towards the door.
Since Pince had banished him from the Ministry for the next two days, since, "Nobody can think straight after staring at the evidence for nine consecutive days. This is a team effort, so go home, get out of your head. You can return Friday morning, nine a.m., and Longbottom, Potter, you're in charge of breakfast," Harry sat in his office.
Nevertheless, aforementioned arrangement revealed itself, when Draco woke in the middle of the night, covered in cold sweat, faint noises permeating the haze of his nightmare-plagued mind. The young man hesitated at the bottom of the landing that led to the third floor. Yet when a distressed whimper came from Potter's bedroom, Draco climbed the stairs and quietly pushed open the door. He did not plan to snoop, merely care for their patient, and leave again. Yet he was rooted on the spot when a clearly naked Ginny pushed herself up. She had slept on her stomach, one arm still under the pillow, turned away from Harry. The moment she raised her upper body, turning towards her friend, her long, red hair covered her alabaster skin while the blankets pooled in the small of her back. Gently, she placed a calming hand on Harry's trembling chest and whispered soothingly, "It's all right, Harry. Voldemort is gone. It is October 2003 You are at number 12 Grimmauld Place. Everything is all right, Harry, we won."
"That's not what I meant," Draco sighed. "I mean there is no struggle as to who makes the decisions; who the one with the power is. They treat each other as equals."
"I know," the other replied swiftly before looking up. The raven-haired looked seriously concerned, so Draco assured, "I promise, I know. I just had an idea during dinner and want to think it through before calling it a day."
Eyes going impossibly wide, Harry whispered, "Oh … OH! I'm beyond stupid. I'm an idiot!" Kreacher's mumbled, "That's what Kreacher said," was drowned out by a screamed, "Neville!" Jumping to his feet, the young Auror collided with his colleague, who had just entered the observation room, only mildly irritated by the collision.
"No," Draco shook his head, finally tearing his eyes away from his 'not dead' godfather, and towards the wizard who held both of their lives in his hands. "Why is he here? I thought you two hated each other."
Summoning another bottle of beer, serving the blond, Harry shrugged nonchalantly. "It's not as if this was my fault. If only you had waited for me to explain the dish, before goring yourself, you would have heard me advising you only to take a small bite, to judge if it is too spicy for you. Should that be the case, yoghurt is available. The cornbread is there to balance the taste, but if the dish is too hot, it will only help a little."
"It's been nearly two months, but we still have no clue as to how to find them. Robarts will slim this team down soon, if we can't produce any leads."
With a small tilt of his head, Severus confirmed Neville's suspicion. Yes, he had known that during their last year at Hogwarts, every other student of sixth and seventh year had carried around a bottle of the healing drops, hidden away from the Death Eaters that had roamed the castle. They had healed Cutting Curse wounds before they could scar, eased nerve-damage from over-exposure to the Cruciatus, though the potion was not inheritadly meant for that. Yet with the few ressources the students had been able to acquire, they had done their best. As residential Potion Master, he had brewed cauldron after cauldron for the infirmary, never allowing himself to think about sending more vials up, than Poppy had ever received.
This could be a problem, but on the other hand, Kingsley had not said anything. Not when Harry had returned to work the next day, nor at a later date, when they had passed each other by at the Ministry. "Did he mention it to you?"
"Could you and Teddy please join me? Draco, you too." Her voice had a dreamlike quality common only with Luna. Worried for her baby-sister, Andromeda pushed back her chair and took her grandson by the hand.
Straightening in his chair, the young wizard shook his head. "No, I'll go, of course. It'll be alright." Closing his eyes, Harry was not sure who he tried to convince, Narcissa or himself when he repeated decisively, "It will be alright."
In a matter-of-fact tone, the Lady of the House had explained to him, what she thought of Harry running off for seventh year, leaving her grandson to fend for himself and the younger years, at Hogwarts. She detailed the trials and tribulations her boy had gone through and pointed out the magical strength and leadership skills he had gained in the process.
Her composure was admirable. Only her eyes gave away that she had been crying. Harry wondered if it had been tears of relief, maybe even joy, but shoved that thought away, as soon as it came up. He had to act like a professional! Personal feelings had no place in this investigation.
'I'll try to come back tomorrow, and you can help me plan the lab.' Had he somehow been involved in the planning process? But that did not make any sense, as he had been in a coma. Someone had been concerned about poisons and love potions. The question was: who?
By Friday, Harry was ready to tear out his hair. When Neville asked him to accompany him to the Leaky Cauldron, he acquiesced. Fridays had been his favourite day of the week in the past, but since Draco had re-entered his life, he had begged off from the shared lunches with his friends and family more often than not. Today, he hoped to get the chance to talk to Hermione. If Lucius were not willing to share his troubles, maybe his best friend would enlighten him.
They all sat together for breakfast the next morning and once Harry had sufficiently woken after a cup of coffee and porridge with fresh blackberries, Narcissa had placed before him, he pondered, "We'll start removing the dark artefacts today. Considering your families background, I doubt Tom's diary was the only one."
When Ron hit Harry at the back of the head at his non-challant question, the raven-haired sighed, "I get it … revenge for me. Geez … Ron, that hurt!"
The four young people that had watched this spectacle fascinated could only gape when Andromeda sagged in defeat, admitting, "Yes, you won. I will give you the recipe for grandmother's gingerbread cookies. But holding the baking ransom is hardly playing fair, dear sister."
"Yes," the other wizard snapped. "One of them got kidnapped, and the other has a 'saving the whole world' complex! I could hardly trust them to resolve this situation on their own."
When he left a few minutes later, Harry felt satisfied with his chosen hiding-place. No, Severus Snape could not do anything in case someone ransacked his sanctuary. However, the young Auror was convinced that the scroll, that transcribed the spells cast by Draco's wand was safer there than anywhere else.
The 'golden trio' and Draco were the last to lounge in the living room. Only when the final embers of the fire sparked out, did Ron sigh, "I guess it's time to go to bed."
"No," he whispered hoarsely, "No!" he repeated louder as his entire body started to tremble. Frantically, he looked at Harry. "No, … Luius, dander. No! Down! … No! Lyar. … Loyal. Alwai. …
Rising from the floor, Hermione started to explore their prison cell, trailing her fingertips over the walls. It was crude, only a few feet in any direction. But at least it was dry and moderately warm. "That's not true, and you know it."
"Maybe you can't. I do! I studied transformative spell-design for years and wrote my Master Thesis on Analytical and Layered Magic. While we can agree that
from starvation. Nowhere near enough to care for a coma patient! But of course," the young man sneered, "I forgot the Ministry. You were a government employee after all when we put you to sleep. I am sure they would have taken excellent care of you. Maybe even given you a bed beside Lockhart at St. Mungos to keep you entertained."
"Harry can. And considering that they are most likely held behind wards, we boosted his search a little, so to speak."
is what it means to be truly rich: to have a family. Because no matter how many galleons you have, no amount of money can ever buy you love."
When tears rose in his godson's eyes, Harry opened his arms and hugged him close. "She wasn't angry with you, cub, but with me."
Turning towards the carpet, the older woman slowly started to connect the dots. "Sirius is not part of the family, so Harry can't be either … not in the eyes of magic, never mind that his claim is entirely legal." It all made sense now. All the times Harry had spent on erecting new wards. The begrudging acceptance of the house elf that refused to call him 'Master'.
Despite Narcissa reporting but another failure with the carpet, Harry was not overly bothered. In a way, it was good to know that a former member of the Black family shared his determination to get Sirius back into the fold. The fact that it worked with little success, at first, helped to make Harry realise that he had not been ignorant of an obvious solution.
Somehow, Draco felt the overwhelming desire to run and hide; anything but be present when he was let down in a second-hand conversation where Harry explained to his godson that the child had gotten it all wrong. Still, he stayed, because somehow, he needed to hear this, to move on. No matter how painful it was going to be.
"But that is the point, Harry, it did not. Not at the beginning. Lord Voldemort wanted to separate our societies, to keep us safe. World War I and II were eyeopeners! True, some spells can kill, but a single muggle bomb can eradicate an entire city block. Muggles are dangerous and have the tendency to destroy everything they do not understand or fear. If we separate us from them, preserve our rules and remember our traditions from an early age, we can keep our children and us safe.
"Mr Potter," Severus interrupted in his best 'professor's' voice. "Don't tell me that Mr Malfoy and I need to give you the 'wands and holsters' talk."
“Alright,” Aware that his superior could read him by now, the young wizard admitted. “According to Lucius, this can go two ways. Either he finds some hard evidence for us to use, or he discovers his ‘brother-in-arms’ to be innocent. In that case, he will try to persuade me to let him go.”
After the boy's saddle had been secured, Harry put a comforting hand on Draco's arm. "Don't worry. I think, today is the first day in over thirty years they can just enjoy without having to worry about Dark Lords or social standing or getting enough food on the table. Let them. Luna and Neville won't let anything bad happen."
"Severus," Snape corrected, an ongoing dispute between the two, since Draco did not seem willing to give up the childish name. "What … did you … make?" The Potion Master inquired, accepting the notepad that was put into his lap with a surprised gaze. The pages were filled with his godson's even script, detailing the development of the potion he was now presenting. "It is a muscle relaxant, … but only for a specific group of muscles," the older wizard mumbled to himself, not even realising how much easier and clearer speaking was for him, when he did not put his full force behind it.
"What can Gringotts do for you?" A nasty looking goblin glanced down at Harry and Severus as they stepped up to the teller's stand.
A twisted noise from his usually so grumpy and disapproving house-elf, had Harry transfer Emerald back into his arms, before he pulled both close, hugging them carefully. For a few moments, he felt Kreacher lean against him, snuggling close before the elf seemed to recall his dignity and pushed away. "Baby needs to eat now. Master will excuse us."
Emerald eyes met silver-grey orbs that were filled with desperation. The young man noticed that the blond was trembling nearly imperceptibly, very much like the last time Harry had seen Malfoy in the great hall, after the battle. Fear was prominent in the young man's tone when words were spoken, the chosen one had never, ever imagined hearing from his former rival. “Please, help me.”
"Hm, hm, …" the boy replied absent−minded, sorting through his backpack until he found what he had been looking for. Inspecting the round, grey stone, that had veins of gold running through it, he looked at the kitchen and back at Harry, before chewing on his bottom lip. Timidly, he asked, "Harry, would you be sad if I gave this to Draco, so he isn't sad anymore?"
In the beginning, Harry had wondered if his patient was even still alive and not a breathing corpse - and hadn't that been a creepy thought - since the man's hair hadn't gotten any longer, and his nails hadn't grown. Yet after consulting the responsible medi−witch, aptly named Poppy, he had learned that for a wizard a coma was something akin to being frozen in time. His metabolism was slowed down to an absolute minimum, making it possible in the first place to survive on nutrition−potions and nothing else. With a sigh, because despite Hermione and Ron's help, they were no closer to finding a cure, Harry checked on Teddy before making his way downstairs again.
Teddy was sniffling in Harry's arms a while later, protesting weakly. "But I don't want another tree. This one is perfect. All special and ex..., extra…, extraordinary!"
Sighing, gesturing at a hidden passage, the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World' shook his head. "I know. It's just … I hate to be made into a public spectacle."
"I don't know," Lucius replied angrily, irritated that she would force this knowledge on him. "His body, it would seem."
Harley appreciated working with muggleborn. They did not cling to their wands in the same way purebloods did since they had learned to live without them for the first eleven years of their lives. Hermione Granger-Weasley, however, was another matter entirely, since he doubted very much that she even needed it, to ruin this poor sod's life. Sure, Stephen Sandorn deserved to be punished, but he had the feeling that once this witch was through with him, he would be burned and lucid enough to know it.
Pondering the offer, Astoria shook her head. "He knows that he was … quite rough tonight. He might get suspicious if I don't have a mark on my body come morning. I only came here because … because it hurt," she whispered after a second.
was the one making it. Yet before he could try and stop himself, panic raced through his system. The Shack. Voldemort. Nagini! … It all came back to him. By Merlin, he was dying!
As his mother had taught him, Draco offered a deep bow after entering the living room. He was pleased to notice that Astoria looked significantly better than during their last encounter. Though the black garment made her uncharacteristically pale, there was a light in her eyes that had been absent before. "Mrs Greengrass, it is a pleasure to see you."
When Harry rose from his chair, fetching the tool despite his sulking, he groaned when Neville patted his head, "Good, boy."
Trailing the edges of his glass, Harry mumbled, "It was all politics and power-play and taking advantage. It was … I know that the purebloods work that way, but I thought …"
An hour later found the four men in the kitchen. Lucius and Harry had returned to their work so documents littered half of the kitchen−table. On the other half sat the toddler in his accustomed high−chair, bent over a long scroll, explaining to the blond, who was stirring a smoking cauldron on the stove. "And he was the guard of the pear−tree …"
A near overwhelming magical force appeared out of nowhere, and while the cultists cried out for their goddess' protection, the Aurors realised that they would have no chance of winning if people started attacking them from within
When Lucius looked at him puzzled, the young man smiled again. "And you don't understand either, do you? Even though it is
Pondering that theory, Neville inquired, "Are we absolutely certain that those we have discovered all the only books they have at their disposal?"
The pureblood shuddered, "That does not seem very secure. Just imagine, your entire money, all your family values linked to one, little card."
The Potion Master wondered for a heartbeat, how he could have known that this armchair was fit to make a bed for his two former students. But inevitably, thoughts of Lucius Malfoy warred for his attention. Despite everything he had heard, not for one second did he believe his former friend shackled and leashed. Lucius was too proud, too Slytherin to take anything like that without an agenda of his own. That was simply not how the pureblood worked. So, Severus found himself once more with the duty of protecting Harry Potter from his own naivete. And this time, not only Harry, but Draco as well, since he had seen in the boy's eyes how much he wanted to believe in his father's redemption.
"Here we are," Pince shared, "All notes on the books and our victims can be found here. Why don't you familiarise yourself with the evidence, Lady Malfoy, while I care for some tea?"
Once he left the burrow, he found the rest of his family lounging around the huge bonfire, spreading over transfigured sofas and loveseats. Easily slipping down beside Draco, he pulled the blond close, so he could cover them both with the quilt Molly sent over with a flicker of her wand. At first, his companion resisted the gesture, but after a minute, when nobody seemed inclined to comment on their proximity, Draco relaxed into the impromptu embrace. Neither he nor Harry noticed the meaningful glances George threw his sister, and the sly smile she offered in return.
He wouldn't … couldn't allow that. With Lucius Malfoy prancing around Grimmauld Place, he had to get better and fast. Because, every day he was not able to keep an eye on that foolish boy, was one where his fellow Death Eater could sink his claws further into Harry. The young Auror was in danger and not even willing to acknowledge it. True, the pureblood was bound to him. Severus had to give it to Hermione Granger to find the most efficient solution to that particular problem. But being physically not able to attack his liege certainly had not rendered Lucius Malfoy harmless. Far from it!
Having taken his wand back, especially from the hands of Harry Potter, had brought back memories. Memories of the day the 'Boy Who Lived' had taken it from him, and since there was no work to be done any longer, Draco had nothing to keep them at bay. He would have loved to brew but knew that he was not in the right state of mind to do so, and Severus had taught him too well to waste ingredients.
"Yes, but I couldn't conjure a corporeal Patronus then, only a shield. I always wondered if I was simply too weak to produce an animal."
Pulling a change of clothes and some toiletries out of the horrible bag, the two wizards were in the process of putting on their dress-robes, when a realisation hit Draco. "That was the reason for you sleeping in my room. Am I right? Not some weird sense of proprietary!"
Looking at the stars, the young man shrugged. "I guess that depends, is the upcoming change good or bad?"
Pondering that on their short way back to Grimmauld Place, they had only walked for 10 minutes prior to their debate after all, Draco nodded reluctantly. "Maybe. He might be angry with aunt Andromeda. Do you have any idea why?"
At the continuous encouragement of his family, the raven-haired sighed and finally shimmied out of his shoes and trousers, trading them for the dragon-hide garments. Once he closed the zipper of the jacket, he felt protective magic settle around him like a hug. Caressing the fabric, admiring his reflection, Harry took half a step back, when Hermione drew her wand on him. Instantly raising his hands, he looked at her questioningly.
"If I remember correctly, I might even have the recipe of a herbal pain reliever. I would need murtlap essence to brew it, but it should be safe for you to take."
The two Potters looked around, then at the crib where the baby was still breathing evenly under its star blanket. Slowly they approached the frame. As before, Lily's eyes were impossibly tender, as she watched her best friend comforting her son. Severus wanted to say something, to apologise. But despite the many hours he had spent in front of this picture, and the numerous speeches he had written in his mind, nothing would come out. The Slytherin had always feared that Potter's malicious gaze would cower him. Despite all the years that had passed, his former tormentor made him feel no more than 11 years old. Yet, when he looked at his former nemesis, warm, brown eyes met his.
The young witch pointed at an old galleon on her vanity. Picking it up, Augusta read, "Be ready at sundown." Looking up, she pondered, "This is your 'DA' coin."
Harry, on the other hand, was pacing the length of their office, trembling from barely suppressed rage. His magic was whipping around him, stirring up papers as he passed.
Suppressing a smile, since Harry was still hovering at the head of the table, like a scolded school-boy, Kingsley took Narcissa's hand and hinted a kiss. "The pleasure is all mine, Lady Malfoy." After greeting a much more reserved Lucius, he returned to his breakfast. After the second cup of coffee, he had to admit that he developed a liking for the spiced beverage.
"As arrogant as ever!" Snape sneered. "You are not Minister of Magic … still, you think yourself res… responsible for the entire world."
Approaching Draco, Luna and Charlie, Harry heard the witch's protests, "But you need this plant. It helps with the gnomes and fairies! Without it, they won't return come spring."
on spoiled Slytherin first-years who considered themselves 'mistreated', because they did not receive private rooms with en-suits upon their arrival, despite being heirs to ancient and noble houses.
Twisting around, hitting his friend with his elbow involuntarily, Harry managed to dig his keys out of his trousers pockets. During the last fair he had visited with Victoire and Teddy, the girl had won him a tiny flashlight, covered in violets. It was barely big enough to hold its battery, but until they decided to let off their shields, this would have to do.
Severus had been appalled … had felt betrayed by his own body when he had realised that his fingers would not obey his commands as they used to. At his first intended correction on the research Draco had presented to him, he had nearly destroyed the entire page when losing control over the quill. Embarrassed, his godson had claimed the feather, promoting his godfather to dictate his thoughts.
"And you think tonight will be dangerous?" She returned to spelling Luna's hair to stay put, no matter the amount of running and dodging about to happen. Augusta only hesitated for a heartbeat, when the girl nodded with an unusually severe expression. "Follow me, child."
Since 2013 I have attended NaNoWriMo every year. That's actually how Sententia started as well. Since I was determined to pick up a new hobby this year (painting/drawing/etc.) my writing somehow took the back-seat. But this November I want to give my everything once again. 50.000 words for a story of my choosing, and for the first time I will have started a fanfic during NaNoWriMo and hopefully be able to end it the same way.
"Harry, you won't receive any help from the general public, if you don't learn to ask for it. I know your family is very supportive, but you will need many more on your side if you want to have any hope of succeeding."
"But you don't want to bind your fate to that of an inquisitor? Do ministry workers live too dangerous for your taste?" It was a valid concern. Marriage was all about producing enough offspring to carry on the family name. A hazardous occupation was diametral to such an intent if the bride-to-be would not retire to care for the children.
Drawing strength from the green eyes that looked at him with such concern, the young pure-blood finally admitted, "He scared me. He spoke of his mistress and him sharing certain … tastes. That he expected someone like me being exactly to their liking." After a moment of hesitation, Draco admitted quietly. "He did not hurt me, but I think he wanted to."
As it turned out, the family-tree looked exactly the same, with the Lady Malfoy brooding in the armchair. The sewing kit sat open on the small table beside her, obviously having been used. Confused Harry wanted to know, “Are the tools not sufficient? Do you need anything else?”
Seven hours later, the two enjoyed a light snack in Severus' room. The Potion Master had been ensnared, enchanted and appalled in equal parts when he had gone over the research Draco and Harry had brought back from the Manor. Most days, he was so lost in it, that he forgot all about meals, and only ate and drank when Emerald pushed a freshly brewed cup into his hands and forced a sandwich or biscuit into his palm.
With a sigh, the older wizard waved his hand, "Buzz off, Potter," As the raven-haired turned to leave, Robarts called after him, "And tell Longbottom, I want a transcript of that interrogation! I need to know if your strange methods have merit."
"And do what?" Harry asked drily. "I have had the darkest wizard of all time out for my blood pretty much since I was one. What exactly can anybody do that would live up to that?"
"The opposite, in fact," the raven-haired smiled broadly. "The 'Remus Special' is something Andromeda and I invented not long after …"
Having a computer for himself would increase the knowledge database he could work with exponentially, since, in a few weeks of downtime, Hermione had taught him a digitalising charm of her own making and he had gone to town on every law book he could get his hands on; both from within the Malfoy Library and at the Ministry. Volumes, he now found already stored on the laptop for his convenience. It still amazed him, that libraries full of books could be made available on such a small piece of technology. Lovingly, he brushed his fingertips over the keys as Arthur claimed a stool beside him, admiring the muggle technology. "Justin promised to set up an internetwork at your home, so your laptop and Hermione's can communicate."
"Actually, Mr Potter," Severus set down his cutlery and entered 'teacher mode'. "A Fidelius is a rather complex ritual anchored to a specific object, meant to target all living things in the vicinity. It is, technically, mind-altering magic, as the charmed object is not physically displaced from this realm, but rather hidden from everyone's mind."
Ron interjected, "And if these traditions were that important, the families of the purebloods would teach them to their kids anyway."
Then, they hovered, nobody saying a word. After a minute, Harry spoke up softly, "I won't make it an order. We have talked about this. It is your decision. You know Draco. But if you feel that you do not want to trust him, we will arrange for something else. There is enough room in the basement."
Following the unexplainable draw that pulled him into the jungle, he stumbled out of the greenery at the foot of a giant pyramid, that felt like the people living there had only abandoned it yesterday. When he set foot on the premises, he realised that it had not been abandoned at all. People with spears and nets had forced him to his knees, and though he had sensed dark magic surrounding him, he surprisingly had not felt threatened. He had gotten to know true evil and these people, though afraid of him, had not been evil. He had allowed them to go through his pockets and his bag, knowing that they wouldn’t be able to unlock the expanded compartment since they weren’t magical. He had been more than surprised for one of them to shout out when they had pulled out his wand. He had made a grab for it, and surprisingly they had relinquished it easily.
Briefly chewing on is bottom-lip, Harry nodded in confirmation before he hurried towards the Atrium.
The man raised his hands to interrupt him. "Don't, my … Harry. It was presumptuous of me to claim a drink, without consulting you. You have nothing to apologise for. You merely reminded me of my place."
Ron was helping, as was George. In their sparse free time they were cooking up variations of known antidotes. George had been brilliant at potions, and Ron had become rather good at it too since the majority of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' products were cooked up one way or the other. Hermione was a downright genius and could master any subject she put her mind to … usually. But potions were different. To brew you needed more than knowledge, you needed the heart to become a true master. For Severus Snape, potions had been his entire existence, his knowledge and understanding more in-depth than anything Harry could ever hope to achieve. Neither of the four had a chance to succeed in this, but Draco … maybe he could do it.
All three laughed, when Ginny cast a stinging hex at her brother, refolding the clothes with the dark promise, "We will talk about this later!"
'That's not true!' Harry wanted to throw out, but he could not because … because it would be a lie. For years, … nearly an entire decade, he had been told that destroying Voldemort was
the time, and dark wizards are …" At Severus' tiny smile, the young man relaxed ever so slightly. "You know better than anybody. I just … it would not be right for you not to have one, when all the others, even Justin, do."
"But he betrayed you," his godson forced out from behind clenched teeth, fighting down his tears of anger. His wand arm was shaking by now, directed at empty space - at least in the world of the living. "He is the reason all of you are dead! He took you from me! This is All. His. Fault!" He tried to veer forward, to step around Remus' ghost to reach the whimpering teenager. But a surprisingly firm grip around his wrist held him back. Whipping around, emerald eyes met black ones, and after a heartbeat, Harry lowered his occlumency shields.
Holding the witch back before she could open the doors to her domain, Harry wanted to know, "The project … did you ask him why?"
After a moment, there was a knock on the door. Someone actually remembered to await permission to enter.
A part of the former Death Eater was reluctant to believe that his master would let him off the hook that easy. But since he had no way of predicting Potter’s actions, he complied. “As a future Lord, I have been trained from a very young age to be familiar with our laws. My father was steadfast in his belief that the leader of a family knows the base of our justice system, down to the last paragraph. That, combined with my personal experience in You-Know… Voldemort’s service grants me a unique insight into a dark wizard’s mind. If there is anything to this man’s claims of having been forced by a curse or potion, I might be able to find it. If not, I have the knowledge to help you build a case against him, so he will never set foot on the shores of Britain again.”
This journey is coming to an end and while DarthKrande and I might polish up the first few chapters, nothing new will be posted.
Gazing briefly at his bleary-eyed companion, Draco merely shrugged. "I have an idea. Anyway, what has you up after so little sleep? I never heard you come in last night and I was in the lab until after eleven."
Surprised, Severus turned towards Harry," He trapped you in a vault with an active Gemini Curse and took the Sword of Gryffindor from you. Why would you trust him with your money?"
"Oh, hey, Harry!" Charlie looked up after having finished his last charm to make the cage indestructible. "I'm sorry for having been so short with you, in the morning. But little Inari here ate very little since Yule. I was fresh out of ideas, and since she seemed to like Draco, I hoped that he could convince her."
"Really?" Kingsley seemed surprised. "I was under the impression that the relationship between Mrs Greengrass and Regina Charlton has been more or less stable for the past two years."
With a sigh, because this was something he simply could not keep to himself, Harry had turned towards his two best friends. "Sorry, guys, … could you …?" Vaguely he gestured towards the door.
Harry glanced at his former professor, but the wizard merely shrugged. "Magic is all about intent. I highly doubt that you would want any harm to come to your parent's portrait. You merely want to include them in your home."
Even his son had been around again, investigating their books. Though Lucius did not feel entirely comfortable with the choices Draco had made, he would let it slide until the boy gave him reason for concern. Years ago, he would have encouraged him to further his position by providing 'potions' for his master that could help (or not). But these days, Lucius knew that Draco would rather cut off his own arm, than harm their liege in any way. That, and the boy had made it very clear where his loyalties lay. He had to be content with that.
Four days into his recovery, his mind finally made the connection: What was Draco Malfoy, a former Death Eater doing in Harry Potter's home? And it was clear that he was not around to visit on Severus' behalf, since he barged into his quarters every hour of every day, in various states of dressing. Once he had even en-tered in his pyjamas, shouldering Potter aside, who had woken him from his latest nightmare, pouring dreamless sleep down his throat. The former spy had not been able to puzzle out the relationship between the two, too grateful to get at least a few hours of undisturbed rest.
Relieved, the young wizard watched as the ring resized itself to fit Narcissa's finger. "Great, that's … great. Thank you."
Laughing slightly hysterical at the absurdity of the situation, the raven-haired challenged, "You know how I feel about your future husband, yet what you chose to chide me about is my crude language?"
The need for popcorn had increased significantly, or so Irma Pince had told Harry, when he had accompanied her back to Hogwarts. There was even a betting pool between the other librarians if they would rather kiss or hex each other into oblivion.
Shaking his head, James had contradicted her, defending his best friend, "No, Sirius loved Harry. He would have never given up that easy!"
"At 3:52 p.m. the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has registered the use of magic at Malfoy Manor. Since the local residents are either forbidden or not in possession of a wand, we can only conclude that a violation of the rules of Mistress Narcissa Malfoy's house−arrest has occurred. Hence, under paragraph …"
A slow smile spread over Charles' face, when he finished, "So if a tracker is not supressed, chances are good that the book taken leads us to our victims." After a heartbeat he added, "Or to someone who flinches books from libraries, but then we can put the fear of Merlin into them by storming their apartments."
Hesitantly reaching out, as if he was unsure if he was even allowed, Harry covered Severus' trembling fingers with his warm, steady hand. "For the same reason I did everything else: So, you would have a choice after you woke. It's no different from this room, Draco's 'inheritance' or the Order of Merlin. If you want to brew again, I knew you would never be content with pepper-ups or dreamless sleep. Given the time, you can create something amazing, I know it! You only need the tools of your trade. In this case …" he gestured over the magazines, "a jump-start to get up to date on recent developments. When you feel confident enough to step in front of a cauldron again, we'll find a way to make that happen."
"You will …," she gapped for a second, before turning towards young man by her side. "Mr Fairchild, why don't you return to headquarters and start on the paperwork. I will be with you momentarily."
Ignorant of the hustle and bustle around him, Harry only woke when Narcissa put a plate of food in front of him and Kreacher topped off his coffee.
Massaging the bridge of his nose, Severus counted to ten. In Latin. A most useful trick for a head of house, or when one had to deal with the Boy-Who-Lived, seven days a week. Secretly, he suspected that Mrs Granger-Weasley used it herself. Otherwise, her non-violent temper was hard to explain. Or maybe having had learned to deal with Harry Potter's 'good ideas' since the age of eleven had her develop nerves of steel. Regrettably, he was not there yet. He sighed deeply before inquiring, "How many people at the Ministry know?"
Today, however, bad had come to worst. As Emilia Nightingale had explained, his surviving on a few nutritious potions and nothing else had made caring for his body's needs quite easily. Now, however, he was given solid food again. And by solid, he meant whatever mush Kreacher could come up with. And by 'given' he meant being fed like an infant. True, the medi-witch was all quite matter-of-fact, regarding the whole business. Him refusing to eat, as long as his godson was present, had made her send Draco out on short notice. Still, he had not factored in the bowel movements regular food would cause. For now, the witch casting charms to … empty his body of all waste three times a day had been enough. But today, Severus had lost control, as Potter had been in the room to check up on him before work.
These journals were brilliant! Every Potion Master in the United Kingdom would kill … well, maybe not kill but seriously maim or injure to get their hands on them. And Draco - an Ex-Death Eater without a wand - had the honour of reviewing them. Draco knew that this knowledge was wasted on him. Still, he was too selfish to reveal that to Harry. He had only been instructed to do research. He certainly did not need a wand for that.
Instantly, the young Auror was on alert. Who was bleeding? This was supposed to be an easy ritual. Well, not really easy, but not so perilous as to make someone bleed!
Looking around confused, only catching a glimpse of Emilia as she left the room, Harry shook his head. "Excuse me, Sir, but what brought this on? Is there a problem with your medi-witch? She took really good care of you, but if you don't like her, I can probably find someone else …"
The room around them started trembling, while the 'Saviour' stood in the middle, head bowed, fists clenched.
Severus, who had looked up from his notes, watched the scene with a detached form of amusement. "You are aware that I am familiar with most of my godson's research?"
Grouching, Griphook inquired, "Do you want to see your vault now, Master Snape, or would you prefer to continue discussing your take on goblin psychology with Lord Potter-Black?"
Watching the pureblood share such uncharacteristically emotional details, it was hard for Harry to hold his tongue. But he knew that not all secrets of this house were his to share. After a while, he asked quietly, "If you could see Professor Snape one last time. What would you say to him?"
Then the pure-blood, who had spent his entire Hogwarts career antagonizing this boy to get any kind of reaction, finally decided to take what he wanted, consequences be damned. So, he pulled Harry close and kissed him.
Snape was surprised to see the beaming smile the house elf - who somehow still sat on his bed - gave her master, before climbing into Harry's arms, who then sat her on the floor. "Oh, and you should be really quiet … shhh … we don't want to wake Kreacher or Draco. Right?"
Looking up, confused for a second, since his thoughts had gone into an entirely different direction than finding a god for himself, Harry shook his head. "Not really. I don't know enough about this stuff to make an informed decision."
With a huff, the other sank into his chair, offering despondently, "Well, the three of you did not have Severus' journals. Nor did any of you have a Potion Master for a godfather."
And he did, so he opened the book at the appropriate page and started, "There were once three brothers, who were travelling a lonely road at twilight …"
Saturday evening, Rose and Victoire had a nice sleep-over at the burrow. At Ron and Hermione's request for a babysitter, Molly had promised the children a girl's night, and promptly the idea had evolved into a slumber-party for several young and not so young Weasley witches. That gave her youngest son and his wife an evening to themselves. To Hermione's amusement, Ron had developed an addiction to soap operas, after watching one at the Grangers' home. Yet, no matter how sophisticated Hermine's runes and spells had been for her laptop, the telly still flickered out if you cast as much an an Accio in the vicinity. They had broken three models before discovering that. So, they had built a small pavilion, away from the main house. The current television set at least worked while still within the wards. But the muggle entertainment had no place in their plans for tonight.
Slowly, unsure if she should or not, the Lady Malfoy turned. There, in black robes with neatly pulled back hair stood Severus Snape. A man who she had buried and mourned nearly five years ago. "Severus," she breathed, flinching when Irma Pince was suddenly by her side, claiming the teacups.
utterly ordinary. Their children, however, are anything but. What does that say about their family?"
When Harry did not immediately reply, instead hugged his knees to his chest, his mother probed gently. "What happened to Sirius Black, darling?"
"If this works out the way we plan, it will make us even," she stated calmly, and Draco could only agree.
"We'll make do," Harry nodded, unsure if he was trying to convince himself or his colleagues. "The others can erect anti-apparition wards, blanketing the area. You and I can cast a one-way shield, making it impossible for them to hit us full force."
When Narcissa did not confirm that optimistic estimation, Harry looked at her, apprehensively, "What are you not telling me?"
"Are you out of your mind?" Draco interrupted, wrestling the bottle from his weak grip. "There is no proof of the beneficial properties of such a brew, Lovegood. The last thing Potter needs is being poisoned by your imaginary potions."
Finishing her spell, smiling at the photographic evidence of her grandson's adoration for his godfather, the elderly witch replied unperturbed, "You can't afford to sue me, Harry Potter." She had become aware of the muggle technique of expressing someone's ire when Harry had uttered the empty threat the first time, a drooling Teddy chewing on his robe making an adorable picture for the child's photo album. In her opinion, nothing beat a swift hex to make one's displeasure known. Still, she had begun to enjoy their little game, so she always replied appropriately.
"Do you think he will go in there?" Harry inquired curiously. He really could not see the shy animal confine itself out of its own free will.
"It's okay, Harry," his godfather assured him, and James added, "Don't worry, son, everything will be alright. Now do as your mother says."
"I … but …," Harry could hear his colleague stutter, but it would need a much stronger man to contradict Molly Weasley on a mission.
"And so Death took the second brother for his own," the redhead finished for him. "You know the entire tale by heart, don't you?"
With a sharp look, the witch replied, "Since this visit was nearly a fortnight ago, I do not see how my sister's and my personal affairs are any of your business."
"Knew what?" Luna seemed confused, turning her head this way and that. After a moment, she held out her arms, so he could help her down. After a brief hug, he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and started picking leaves out of her hair, while they made their way back to the Manor.
"I know that Dittany is not meant for the eyes, but I had to do something. So, I poured everything I had over her eyes and …" Neville cleared his throat, taking another sip of the now cold tea to calm himself.
Shrugging, darkness clouded his face. "After Greyback … what do I really have to be afraid of? Becoming a monster? Bloodtooth … he's all bark and no bite. We don't even work in the same department."
Seeing his son pale, with sunken in eyes, sleeping fitfully on the couch, Lucius had frozen. Once again crushed by the visible evidence of his mistakes. All he had ever wanted was to help the Malfoy name to greatness, as his father had always expected of him. How could he have gone so wrong about that?
Realising that nothing he could say would be of any comfort, simply because Draco did not want to be comforted but sulk, Harry suggested, "Why don't you sketch up the basic construction you have in mind. Tomorrow, after you have tended to Inari, we will go to the hardware store and buy the necessary supplies. Also, some varnish, so it won't rain through it."
Faced with these facts, the pure−blood stammered, "But Arthur Weasley is a minor employee at the Department of Abuse of Muggle Artefacts, and Molly Weasley is a simple housewife."
Insulted the elf crossed his arms. "Kreacher is the Black-family’s … the Potter-family’s elf." he corrected himself with a grimace, "He knows what happens in his house, as is expected of him!"
When two colleagues appeared at his side, Harry watched them putting the Death Eater into bindings, before he finished his sentence. "… even bad form I can ignore. However, you have touched what is mine, and for that, you are going back to Azkaban. Take him away, gentleman."
"No, they won't," Draco whispered, digging his fingertips into the faded Dark Mark. "Even if my house arrest is lifted and you release me from my vow, this cursed thing will always be there, chaining me to my past like a slave's brand."
"Actually, it was the other way around," a composed voice, with a core of steel, interrupted the trio.
"Bet Granger does not like that," the blond mumbled, trying weakly for a joke while following Harry downstairs.
The moment Sandorn had taunted her before fleeing the scene, blaming the 'near' divulging of secrets on Lucius Malfoy, she had been confused.
Rising from the stairs, Ron and Hermione approached him. While Hermione reached for his hand, Ron folded his arms before his chest. "We've been here together," she started, letting Ron finish with the obvious question, "You didn't really think that we would let you do this alone?"
Stirring her tea, the older witch studied the young wizard before her for several moments, before revealing, "Nobody of course. Hogwarts sealed them off after Severus … left."
"No, Draco," Harry interrupted calmly, reaching for the other's wrist to turn him back around. "You heard Ron. He will be back tomorrow. The two of you can tackle the antidote, then. Merlin knows it's complicated enough to brew. So, the second set of hands will not go amiss. And, as strange as this may sound, with all the experimental potions for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, Ron is the best brewer of the three of us."
Instantly, Lucius pulled the pregnant witch even closer, shielding her with his own body from whatever intruder had entered their cell. A sub-vocal growl emerged from his chest as he tried to pull the mountain of covers aside that had been heaped upon them, to see the potential threat.
Toying with his glass of pumpkin juice, the Harry nearly startled when his former teacher inquired, "Did choosing these links really take up most of your day?" The young man looked dead on his feet. Apparently the sleep he had gotten at George Weasley's had barely been enough.
However, both were relieved when Narcissa arrived just after breakfast the next day, bringing along a staggering amount of paperwork that promised a tiring but ultimately quiet day.
So, no, Lucius Malfoy was not nervous when entering the courtroom. He would act in accordance to the expectations placed upon him and, without a doubt, make his master proud so that the entire Ministry would see that Harry Potter's faith in him had not been misplaced.
Shuffling into the room, vanishing the used dishes with but a snap of his fingers, the elf bowed, "You yelled for Kreacher, Sir?"
"But not less powerful for it." The witch agreed. "Harry sent me this book on earth-bound magic from Australia … no, New Zealand. The natives there have a much more 'down to earth' approach for their magic. It was quite a fascinating read."
"Well, I got a detailed antology of the achievements of the women of the Black Family; an overview over the hexes and jinxes she is able to cast, some of which she was kind enough to demonstrate, and the friendly reminder that her daughter was an Auror before my time, hence Andromeda still has friends in that department."
Outside, the pair met with George and Ron, who had stayed behind. While the later offered a candy-bar to Lucius, something the ravenous pureblood accepted gratefully after a confirming nod from his liege, the former wanted to know, "What about Hermione?"
The elf, however, straightened to his full height, nearly reaching Severus' belt. "Me has been given permission! No other house-elf needs permission to punish himself, only Kreacher! And Kreacher has been given permission, yesterday!"
"It does not have to be big to cover a great surface." Bill lectured. "Think a glass of water. Even one cup can soak an entire table."
The pile of kids shifted, and at the other end of where Draco would have expected it, Harry appeared.
"Don't worry," she straightened and buttoned up her robe with a sweet smile. "You will make it up to me."
"What are you doing here?" The portrait wanted to know, but before the Lady Malfoy could answer, the woman frayed, "I hope you are here to claim your son and what's left of the Black inheritance. You wouldn't believe what that half−blood Potter dared to do!"
After side−along apparating the Malfoys to Grimmauld Place, Harry had directed them towards the library, before retreating.
“As have I,” a certain redhead announced, taking position beside Hermione. “Ronald Weasley, your honour.”
"Exactly," Andromeda confirmed. "It is not about the laws. It is about the people!" She felt more than saw her sister freezing by her side. Looking at her with worry, the oldest noticed her mouthing, "It is not about the law, it is about the people. It's about family!"
"You may not know who catered to Hermione's whims, but from what you've mentioned, you have already met the one belonging to Lady Blackwood."
Confused, his friend wanted to know, "Why someone you hate? Most children grow up with their betrothed. They get to know each other and are given a chance to become friends. Otherwise an arranged marriage would be quite difficult. And if it's clear that the kids really can't stand each other - something that rarely happens because they learn what is expected of them from a young age - the families usually find another way. One where everybody can save face. Did you know, for example, that Lucius was promised Andromeda? Yet when she eloped, Narcissa stood in for her sister. From what I have gathered their marriage is one of the few things in their lives the Malfoys rarely had problems with."
Collecting a round of drinks, sighing at her pumpkin juice, Hermione shrugged when Harry asked. "It's Stephen Sandorn. He was on paternity leave for the last few months. His wife was injured during a raid, and his twins were born prematurely."
It always came back to drinking games. And though the famous Gryffindor courage had abandoned them on occasion, especially when faced with Slytherin cunning, nobody was prepared when Ron challenged, "Favourite scar," after draining his third beer, in addition to the two shots he had already had.
"Accio Fred's sock," Mr Weasley mumbled, allowing his wife to fill it up, before hanging it on the mantlepiece.
"Harry prefers to believe, that our lovely daughter came into being by a burst of magic, rather than intercourse. Though Hermione says, it ought to be the stork."
"No, but you still took every chance to prove to Ron how inferior you thought him to be, at school."
Looking at the others, Pendragon sighed and deflated when the other four nodded their consent. "Fine!" He grumbled, "but then I get the Lady Malfoy in return!"
"That's great," the other Auror interrupted the word-flow, turning towards the fourth wizard, "Welsh?"
"I can't tell you," the curse-breaker admitted. "I can give you a detailed explanation of what has to be changed. But the method you have to figure out by yourself. I know too little about parselmagic to be of any help in that regard."
Doubtful, Pince considered, "An abducted witch, two thirds through her pregnancy, and you expect her to do enough magic for you to locate her?"
Neville felt like the Dark Magic that had ruled, had sunken into the grounds and it angered him. He and Harry were working so hard to extinguish even the last remnants of Voldemort, but over their task, they had forgotten that humans, wizards and other magical folk were not the only living things that suffered.
Exhaling relieved, Lily sagged against her husband, so the young wizard continued. "Ron, Hermione and I decided not to return to Hogwarts for seventh year. Well, mostly, I decided that it would be too dangerous for the students if I returned. They simply tagged along. I had my backpack ready ever since we left Surrey. Yet when Death Eaters attacked the Ministry and the Burrow simultaneously, I did not even have time to grab it. Hermione … she just reached for Ron and me amidst the chaos and apparated us away. We ended up in muggle London in dress robes, and all we had on us was her velvet pouch. You know, those tiny handbags where girls usually carry lipstick and tissue and powder compacts and then it's basically full."
For a moment, nothing happened, then the residing Potion Master slipped into the room, claiming a place between the two Aurors. "Proceed."
Offering a courtesy, Astoria replied, "The pleasure was all ours, Lord Potter-Black. We are looking forward to the meeting with the architects from Gringotts."
"Because it was the right thing to do," the 'Chosen One' whispered. "All your life you … things were supposed to be different after Tom's defeat."
Shaking his head, Neville continued in a solemn tone. "Katy, … Kathrine Bartmond … she was three years my senior, and … well, long story short, her family was attacked. They survived by the skin of their teeth, but she decided that she wanted to do something. To make a change. We tried to brew the Draught of the Living Dead, after hours, but she was careless, let three poppy seeds slip in instead of one."
Surprisingly, Kreacher was not around to lend a helping hand, still, within half an hour, Harry served eggs with sausages, grilled tomatoes, toast, and pancakes that were drowning in syrup. Once everyone had been served a hearty meal, the young wizard inquired, "Not that I am not delighted to have you over for breakfast, but what's the matter, Neville? Is something wrong with Lostrife?"
Sampling the wine he had been served, finding it to his liking, Lucius took another sip, before joining the dinner conversation. "Those were the only times you were allowed to use a goblet instead of your usual water-glass, Draco. You insisted since you were allowed a 'grown-up-drink' as well."
Gratefully accepting the steaming cup of coffee Kreacher had placed at his elbow, Severus exhaled contentedly when the caffeine hit his system. These two stubborn boys would put him into an early grave. He wondered if it was too late to lock them in a room together and have them scrub cauldrons until they talked through their differences.
"Close, gentlemen, but not quite. Mr Pince, Mr Leewood, Mr Longbottom and Mr Potter, since you have passed through the entrance with your hearts free of maliciousness, greed or a thirst for power, be welcome to the Arthurian Library. And since I am the librarian of this place, let me introduce myself as well. Christopher Pendragon, at your service."
Smiling at his friend, because - as always - Neville knew what to say, Harry drained his cup. He winched when he scalded his tongue but readily took the suggestion. "Let's do that. Maybe we have been looking at this from the wrong angle, anyway. While it's important to find their suppliers, let's start at the beginning: Where in Albion do Unicorns live?"
"Lucius," the former Death Eater replied with a barely there tilt of his head, acknowledging the other Lord. "You are not the only one who knows how to work the system. Though you have certainly found yourself the more famous patron." Gently brushing a stray lock out of Draco's face, the convict smiled predatorily. "I have just complimented your boy here. He has really grown into his inheritance. A body and face like this could earn you a lot of favours if you knew whom to talk to. For old times' sake, I might consider offering my assistance in that endeavour. My Mistress and I share a similar taste and Draco here, would just be to our liking."
The times when Ginny had shared his bed - just for sleeping, after their amicable breakup - had become less and less over the years. Still, Harry knew that she kept a few essentials in 'her' drawer in his bathroom. Guiding Draco upstairs, he nudged the trembling man to sit down at the edge of the bathtub and soaked a little cotton-pad with make-up remover, "Close your eyes."
Gathering himself, Severus shook his head, "On the contrary. A family would considerably increase their chances of marrying into one of the sacred twenty-eight families if they showed themselves interested in you. Your situation is - after all - temporary, and the Malfoy name still carries weight."
"Doesn't matter," Teddy explained. "Harry says a bad word, I get a sickle. When I have enough sickles, Nana, Harry and I get ice−cream." At the surprised look he received, the child continued, "Ice−cream is not good for me, so I don't get it very often. The more Harry swears, the more often I get it. Nana calls it insen…"
She needed a few minutes to bundle up the pureblood, close to the door, wrapped in as many dry layers as she was able to provide. Then she concentrated on the middle of the bed and performed some first-year magic.
For that question, the young man offered no immediate reply. Only when Severus tilted his chin up, forcing Harry to meet his eyes, the boy offered quietly, "Because you loved your mother. I … I thought you would appreciate the choice of taking her name over that of your father. I thought … I thought with a new name; you could start a new life. For real this time. Free of the burdens of your past. Also, they asked me right after the ceremony where I stood in for you receiving your Order of Merlin. I did not want to give them the chance to change their minds."
Tonight, the golden trio stood at the marble steps, staring up at the impressive front of Gringotts.
Evidently, this display of meekness satisfied the attending wizards, because after giving Harry a brief overview over his rights and responsibilities, which were limitless short of killing his vassal on a whim, they left the courtroom. Once the last member had gone, Neville peeked through the door. Watching the former Lord struggle to his feet, he approached his friends and asked, “So, what happened?”
Not able to help himself, Bill rose from his seat and hugged the woman. "Thank you! This is brilliant!"
Nodding, the young wizard confirmed, "I think he's all alone with no one to hunt for him. He seems to have been born offseason. I don't know what's up with that."
"Harry," Neville reminded him, "You have some pretty radical ideas for the future of our people. And no matter how much we stand behind you, you will need a far bigger support group than us if you want to succeed."
Looking at the three wizards, Kreacher slipped from the chair and bowed deeply, as Harry offered a half-hearted, encouraging smile. "Yes, Master."
"No," the older wizard had growled, glaring daggers at Hermione. "You don't know what you are talking about, young Lady! You are all too young to know what happened. Sirius would have never betrayed us. He was my brother in everything but blood. By Merlin, my parents practically adopted him, after that hag Walburga threw him out. No, Sirius Orion Black would have rather died than betray our family!"
Thunderstruck the witches and wizards of the council gazed at the war heroes that had had their hand in defeating the most dangerous threat their world has known. The Head of the Wizengamot was the first to recover. “This rite has not been revoked for several hundred years. You would need a liege for Lord Malfoy,” he spat out the name, making his distaste for the man audible. “A person who would be personally responsible for everything his vassal does. Where do you plan on finding someone who would take legal responsibility for the actions of a former Death Eater?”
"Where are you going with this?" His partner asked, trying to catch up. Neville was right. This did not make sense. Everybody who had minimal dealings with the wizarding world knew about Narcissa's status as a 'Malfoy' and her house-arrest and lack of contribution to overall matters of society.
As you can understand there is a good chance that I won't be able to edit during the time of recovery. I'll certainly try my best, but my main focus will be elsewhere and I don't want to write this story with half a heart. Sententia deserves better than that.
"Voldemort," Harry and Ron stated in one voice, ignoring the flinches from the others, with Neville as the only exception.
The calm and collected Slytherin-façade was back in place, but the raven-haired still remembered the tender looks Draco had given the neglected and starved animal. Following him into the burrow, Harry wondered if his former rival had ever had a pet like Hedwig. At Hogwarts, Harry had believed the Slytherin to be incapable of caring about anything but himself. Now, things were … different. He and Foxglove had a mutually beneficial relationship. But Harry would hardly call the owl his 'pet'. He nested in the garden of Grimmauld Place, as per his own decision, and was occasionally agreeable to transporting letters in exchange for treats.
Half an hour later, Snape joined them. The sun had yet to peek over the horizon. "Have you slept at all, Mr Weasley?"
Breathing through his nose, Draco concentrated on not throwing up. He could not make a scene. This bastard would leave him alone soon enough. They were at the ministry. Everybody had seen him enter with Potter. In a minute, all this would be over. He could return to the other Slytherins, and at home he could take a shower, to scrub off this bastard touch. All he had to do, was to keep it together and not make a bloody scene!
Harry's shrug could be more felt than seen. "Ron, Hermione, Neville, even Luna, really anybody but the boy who had been groomed to become a cold-blooded murder since he was eleven years old."
Since everybody and his mother and seen pictures of the 'golden trio', her question was no admittance to guilt. Every newspaper in Britain had covered their story after the Battle of Hogwarts. However, the redhead would not let himself be deterred by her innocent act.
Harry could not help but smile when the door to his office opened, but nobody announced himself. Foxglove turned his head, inspecting the stranger, but decided that he was of no interest and departed again. Turning a page, Harry in-quired, "Do you need something, Lucius?"
"Of course," Harry jumped at the chance to do something. He wanted to help Astoria so badly but knew that his hands were tied as long as the young Lady offered no official complaint. "Biscuits?" He inquired, before vanishing through the door, as soon as the young witch agreed.
"The one Potter inherited from his father." When Draco had shared that tale, Lucius had hardly believed him, convinced that the stress of the war had gotten to his son.
"Draco sold his life to me, in exchange for my intervention. Am I a horrible person for being glad that he did that? At least I can keep him here now, instead of sending him back to that horrible place. You should have seen him when he talked about returning to the Manor. It was not even 'home' anymore. I had only seen him this distraught twice, once when I saved him from the fiend−fire and before that … well, you know what happened then. You saved his life after all. Did I ever thank you for that? I always thought that using your spell made you responsible. Now I know that I was just like my dad … like James Potter, careless, even cruel without any concern for the consequences of my actions. I understand now why you hated him so much. Still, I was but a stupid child and had you not been there, I would have become a killer. So … I'm sorry and … thank you, for saving Draco. And for looking out for me, I guess."
"Shut up, Potter," the blond yawned. "It's after two, and you really can't afford to lose any more beauty sleep."
"You came back," the blond reminded. "The moment Harry needed you the most, you were there, and that is all that matters." When the redhead did not reply, Draco put a gentle hand on his shoulder. "But now you should go back inside. Hermione does not like sleeping alone."
The two steamrolled wizards traded another shrug before Draco instructed, "The overnight-bag is in the bathroom. Just throw in my toiletries, and I'm good."
"Ginny, open all the windows, George you'll care for the fireplaces. Clean them, then light them up. I doubt there is much corpse wood around, but I am sure Draco can point you towards one tree or the other that can be chopped down. Luna, you have the herbs we will burn later, I trust?"
With a raised eyebrow, Michael Welch, the Librarian of the Westminster Abbey inquired, "So the Malfoy family is currently not under your care, Mr Potter? Somehow the Daily Prophet left that impression."
Not knowing who was on the other end of the floo-call, Snape made a few swift steps into the room and closed the connection. Then he advanced on the former Death Eater, anger burning through his veins. "How dare you?" He whispered, then continued in a roar, "
For the next day, a group from Gringotts had announced themselves. To make room for his current and future roommates, Harry had jumped at the chance to get the goblins to take a look at his house. That way, he could actually gather an accurate estimation on how expensive the remodelling would be.
Still, Pince and Leewood eyed the treats with suspicion, even as Snape took a jet-black one and bit into it.
"We will," the former Death Eater promised with conviction. "We're not alone anymore. I swear, Narcissa, we will do everything in our power to save your family."
Harry nearly tripped over the kitchen bench, in his haste to reach his godson, pulling him into his arms almost desperately. He remembered how it had felt not to be wanted, and he never ever wanted that for his cub. "Teddy, no! My god, what makes you say … what makes you even think that? I love you. So much! I thought you knew that."
At that, the elf chuckled. "Of course not, Sir. What good would a blind elf do? They would have to be put down for being useless."
Whimpering pitifully, Harry covered his ears, repeating a mantra, "Lady Magic, Lady Magic, Lady Magic!"
Biting his lips, to hide a grin, the young wizard replied smoothly, "That and your family relations to his favourite uncle. But you will win his undying devotion if you let him brush your hair tomorrow. Teddy's obsessed with hair. He goes through dozens of colours and styles each day."
It had been here … somewhere. This corridor was half-way between the Slytherin common-room and the potions classroom. Harry had already walked its length several times, realising that he had no idea where Snape's quarters had been. Somehow, he had always gotten the impression that the man lived in his office. But that was out of the question.
Lucius and Draco looked like a burden had been lifted off their shoulders. Not exactly happy, but better than before. Narcissa hugged her son before allowing her husband to pull out a chair for her. Though he tried to contain himself, everybody could see how much joy Lucius took by being able to perform that simple task.
"Hell, if I know," Harry mumbled, "You're here, your parents are at the Manor, and my friends would use the floo."
The last thing Harry saw were the worried faces of Draco and Narcissa as he fled the room. All of a sudden, he felt like suffocating. He had to get out of there.
Contemplating that for a minute, she then picked a berry from her dessert and dropped it into the rest of his porridge. On guard, Lucius spooned it up and ate it. He visibly relaxed when the dish did not punish him for the action. A piece of potato was presented next, but the fork seared his lower lip as he touched it.
“Fine,” Harry relented, folding his arms, smiling down at the man wolfishly. “then I expect you bright and early on Saturday. Let’s say seven-thirty, with the cleaning supplies at hand. We have a lot of ground to cover before I can put Mister Malfoy to work on Monday.”
“I hope this isn't going to give me another snake,” said Malfoy, pensively, as Harry pulled out of him.
Harry obliged, doing his best to keep up a steady rhythm despite the awkwardness of Malfoy's enourmous – but oh, so exciting, so wonderful – belly and the discomfort in his own packed stomach, which had suddenly started cramping up. Malfoy came, throwing his head back in bliss, and the sight of it made Harry came too, hard and long, great jets of come spurting up Malfoy's ass.
“I'm going to kill you,” he tells Potter, as the latter hands him a smuggled turkey sandwhich. “Just you wait. As soon as I stop waddling.”
The voice was stronger now that Malfoy was, unbeknowst to him, closer to Harry – almost as if had come from Malfoy himself. Malfoy hadn't opened his mouth, though, but merely winced and pressed a hand to the front of his robes. He looked so miserable that Harry, in spite of everything, felt a vague twinge of sympathy.
“Shut the hell up, Potter. I hate this thing almost as much as I hate you,” says Draco, unconvincingly, and he pulls Potter in by his tie for a kiss.
“Ugh,” said Malfoy, hoisting his enormous belly over the shelf of Harry's back, the blunt tip of his cock pressed against Harry's eager hole. “It better be worth it, Potter,” he added, and he pushed in.
“Count yourself lucky, Potter,” he says, wincing as a sudden sharp pain shoots through his taut belly. “Ouch.”
Draco has to repress a smirk. Potter -- and who would have suspected! The Chosen One, a sexual deviant -- appears to be struggling to keep his composure when confronted with the reality of Draco’s suddenly enormous belly. Not that Draco minds -- he’d sooner die than admit it, of course, but he’s had his fair share of begrudged sexual fantasies about Potter over the years. He just never imagined that the key to actually seducing his bloody nemesis would be a sudden transformation into some sort of blimp.
“Then what... whoa, look at your stomach! It's changed shape completely. Does it mean that that stuff came from... ?”
“Relax,” repeated Harry, soothingly. Malfoy's belly was changing shape at an alarming speed, the bottom part rounding out until it was almost perfectly spherical. Shamefully enough, Harry felt his dick hardening at the idea of what was about to happen.
“Did Malfoy just belch?” asked Ron, apparently very entertained by the possibility. “Gross! I hope he's coming down with a case of the slugs.”
“Mate, has my mum imperiused you?” asked Ron, snickering at the pile of food in Harry's plate. “That's like a week's worth of shepherd's pie.”
“I'm not particularly good with runes, so don't take my word for it, but I'm starting to think that the incantation works by making you want to fuck whoever you're with when you're in front of the special fire. Magical compulsion would certainly explain why I'm lying here with a bellyful of your come,
“Professor, can I be excused?” Malfoy asked, in a weird, strangled voice – one, Harry felt, that was definitely tinged with panic.
“That's a pity,” said Malfoy, pulling a face. “I was, ah, quite looking forward to having you stuff things up my ass again.”
“I wish you'd just spontaneously combust, Potter,” hissed Malfoy through gritted teeth. He was ridiculously bow-legged, the snout of the snake hanging between his pale thighs, his dick huge and purple with the almost unbearable pressure the emerging reptile was putting on his prostate. “You bloody wanker. This is... this is
The next morning Harry, who had woken up at half past six feeling like he was about to starve, scarfed down a breakfast of five waffles and three sausages before heading over to the Room of Requirements to check on Malfoy.
“Nnngh,” cries Draco, as he feels one of the masses drop inside his rectum, painfully filling the narrow space between his hips. He drops into a squat.
Draco, bewildered by the sudden and rather anti-climatic development, opens his eyes. Potter is lying on his side, looking shaken but relatively unscathed, except for the fact that his stomach is so swollen that he looks several months pregnant. Draco looks down: he’s in the same exact situation, his jumper-clad belly so big that he can’t see his feet. He blinks a few times. It’s an absurd sight: five minutes ago, his stomach was perfectly flat. He carefully presses a hand to the hard surface of his gut -- his poor insides stretched to his absolute limit by whatever it is that expaned inside them, the pressure almost unbearable.
to be a solution, a counter-spell, anything to stop whatever is expanding inside them before they both…
“Wait, do you mean that the snake got inside you because you fucked Zabini in front of this fireplace?”
Malfoy's stomach was as pale as the rest of him, the skin so taut it was almost shiny. The huge swell, Harry realized, was in the upper part, jutting out uncomfortably from beneath Malfoy's ribcage, while the lower part of his abdomen was mostly flat, to the point that he had been able to button his school trousers over his narrow hips. Malfoy groaned again, leaning back into the armchair with his eyes closed and rubbing his distended organ.
“It's not,” promised Harry, caressing the back of Malfoy's hand. “You just need a few minutes to adjust, a nice bath and a good night's sleep, and you'll be as good as new.”
“Why do you still have a belly?” inquires Potter, cornering Draco in a deserted corridor. “I thought you were going to, er, get ri–”
“Well, actually, Potter,” said Malfoy, looking down at Harry with a pleading look in his beautiful eyes. “Actually, I was wondering if there were, er,
“Here,” he says, handing Potter the jumper. “Hurry up, I can’t wait to change into something that fits.”
Potter has rolled to his back, the naked swell of his preposterous stomach sticking out from his bony frame. His shirt’s buttons, it turns out, were no match for his sudden expansion.
“Well, you're missing out,” said Harry, trying to mask the excitement he was feeling. “Especially considering how – judging from how hard your dick is right now – you seem to really enjoy having things up your ass.”
“Go ahead,” says Draco, and in a matter of seconds his trousers are around his ankles and Potter’s warm hand is wrapped around his slick erection. “Make me come.”
“It will,” agreed Harry, his stomach groaning ominously, and he bent forward as best as he could to finally give Malfoy a kiss.
?” gasped Malfoy, horrified, staring at the reflection of the situation between his spread legs. “My ass can't stretch more than this!”
“Is that all you have to say?” hisses Draco, glaring at Potter in the darkness of the fifth floor's broom cupboard. “Don't you think we should find out what's wrong with me?”
“I sort of miss it,” said Malfoy, rubbing his gut pensively. The huge lenght of snake curled up inside him made him look pregnant with twins. “I was getting used to the pressure.”
Under Harry's hand, the snake had given a sudden lurch. Harry let go of Malfoy's erection and used his fingers to explore the situation between his legs: Malfoy's hole, he realized with a jolt of excitement, was starting to bulge with the very tip of the snake's nose. Malfoy was starting to shift uneasily, so Harry resumed his sucking.
“I bet,” said Harry, whose enormous breakfast was making it harder than usual to bend down. “Ok, let's get you out of your trousers. Merlin, Malfoy, I can't believe we're going to do this.”
It was now painfully clear that Harry was, once more, the only one in the room who could hear the voice at all.
“Rest it over my back,” said Harry, bending a bit more. His stomach felt like there was a stone inside it, but at the moment he was far too turned out to even remotely care about the implications. All he knew was that he wanted to get fucked by Malfoy's big cock, and that he wanted it to happen while Malfoy – his asshole dilated to unbelievable proportions, his gut racked by cramps – was struggling to give birth to an enormous snake.
“You're... you're so bloody good at this,” mumbled Malfoy, grabbing a fistful of Harry's hair. “Merlin's balls, Potter, why haven't we spent the last six years in a bed somewhe–
“Do you want me to fake a coma?” offers Potter, looking up from between Draco's legs. “You just have to say the word. Or I could break a leg.”
“You can,” insisted Harry, feeling the snake's sizeable tail move around inside Malfoy's intestines. The pressure of the other boy's body against the hard mass of his stomach was both painful and exciting –
“Did it, now?” said Malfoy, studying Harry with a very pleased look on his face. “I guess that explains why your belly looks so bloated, then. I filled you up properly.”
“Well, because of the ritual,” explained Malfoy, as if it should have been obvious. “The snake conjuring ritual that Blaise and I tried.”
“We’re going to die, Potter,” he groans, clutching at the  rapidly swelling mound with both hands. “Your fucking spell is going to kill us both, you stupid prick.”
“I bet,” said Harry, flashing back to the feeling of Malfoy spurting up his ass. “It felt like a hose when you came inside me.”
“That's impossible,” said Malfoy, rolling his eyes. “You weren't here when Blaise and I cast the spell.”
“Oh,” says Potter, redoubling his exploratory efforts. Draco undoes the straining buttons of his shirt. One of Potter’s hands moves lower, following the sharp slope of Draco’s stomach. Draco unbuckles his belt.
” he yells, a bulge forming in the seat of his trourses as the first of many eggs manages to escape the tight confines of his arsehole. “Potter, this time I am
“Of course,” said Harry, smacking his forehead. “He must be in the room of requirement! I'll take the Cloak, go see what he's up to.”
One, he’s not in his bed, or in his dormitory, for that matter. Two, he’s still sporting an enormous, rock solid stomach, jutting out a good foot and a half from his torso. Three, he’s naked, and lying next to Potter, also naked, also sporting a gigantic belly, mercifully still asleep.
“It doesn’t matter whose fault it is,” he says. “We just need to find a way to fix it as quickly as possible. It’s not… it’s not right,” he concludes lamely, trying and failing to keep his eyes off Draco’s bloated form.
The voice was definitely coming from Malfoy, Harry concluded, baffled. Was he possessed? Was he secretly a ventriloquist? He had no time to ponder the issue, because all of a sudden Malfoy – evidently unconfortable in the very warm Room – began disrobing, and a shocking development presented itself to Harry's eyes.
“I think you're enjoying having a belly, actually,” says Potter, grabbing Draco's cock. “Almost as much as I am.”
“No,” agrees Potter, contemplating his bloated gut with a sigh. “I’m not in much pain either, though. Do you think it’s dangerous?”
Harry had indigestion – which wasn't particularly surprising, given the unusually big meal he'd recently had, but was certainly an annoying hinderance in his quest for a solution to Malfoy's problem.
Harry contemplated his options. The idea of fucking Malfoy – of sinking his whole erection into the intoxicating tightness of his virginal hole, and feeling him buck and moan underneath himself – was unbelievably tempting. On the other hand, a literal snake (a temporarily placated one, for sure, but a literal snake none the less, and a huge one at that) was lurking inside Malfoy's guts, just out of sight, possibly ready to strike at whatever body part Harry decided to insert into its territory. With a shiver, he withdrawn his fingers.
“Sod off,” replies Draco, embarassed. It's true that he's been flying terribly: it's hard to dive properly when your unfamiliarly full belly gets in the way.
Malfoy's belly was so full that it was impossible for Harry to get his dick into his mouth without pressing his forehead against its round surface. Malfoy let out a small moan that went directly to Harry's dick and grabbed a fistful of his hair.
“WHAT?” he said, franctically grabbing his distended stomach. “It can't come out now, I'm not ready, it...
“You know,” he said, getting to his feet. “I don't think we should try and get the snake out until we figure out how to do it safely.”
“Maybe later, Potter,” he says, arching his back to push his giant stomach out even further. “Provided you behave.”
“Open your legs,” orders Draco, suddenly overcome with the desire to see firsthand what’s in store for himself. An ominous pain in his gut makes the issue all the more pressing.
“Are you sure?” asks Potter, placing one hand on Draco's teardrop-shaped belly. “You're already so full, maybe I could suck you off or som–”
“Restless,” answered Malfoy from the armchair, with a groan. Despite the fact that he had his shirt on, Harry could see the way the snake moving inside him distorted the shape of his belly. “I think it's trying to turn around.”
, remarked a small, disquieting voice inside his brain. He squirmed uncomfortably, his erection trapped between his flat lower abdomen and Malfoy's back. “We just need to wait for the whole thing to be over.”
“I sucked you off and now there's a snake inside of me,” repeated Harry, represssing the urge to punch Malfoy's haughty face. “A bloody snake inside my stomach!”
“How exactly am I supposed to fly with this thing?” complains Draco, cupping his swollen stomach while Potter looks for his trousers. “It's bloody
Malfoy winced again, leaning against the wall with his free hand. He seemed to be in a great amount of pain.
Malfoy's ass was clenched so tightly, Harry thought, that despite all the lubrication he'd have had an easier time trying to slide an egg through the eye of a needle. Inside his swollen gut, the snake was starting to grow restless.
“It doesn't surprise me,” said Harry, tracing his fingertip over Malfoy's bulging perineum. “Don't push, though. I don't think that would help.”
Malfoy didn't answer. Harry grinned again and went back to sucking, eager to make the other boy orgasm. Malfoy's balls, he could feel, were drawn up tightly in anticipation.
