Now she just seems tired and far too old for her years. Her hair is limp and unwashed, knotted up in a half-hearted bun. Her Auror uniform is wrinkled. There are deep shadows under her eyes like bruises.
That evening he decides to go to the address on the card. Being in Muggle London makes him feel itchy. Like there’s something he’s forgotten to do, or like he’s late for an appointment. He follows the directions he’d scribbled down hastily after consulting a conjured map of London, trying to work out whether the crowded footpaths feel familiar but it all seems weirdly abstract. He looks at the rainbow flags adorning the windows of a shop and thinks about the last time he went out. The wizarding community is too small to have a wealth of gay bars, so when he feels like a drink or a dance or company, he comes here to Soho. Or he did. Harry shakes his head and stumbles on an uneven curb, looking around again. He’s definitely been out for a drink, been clubbing, recently. He just can’t remember where...or...when.
Hermione swallows. “Before we...before I...”
Harry finds himself entering the room behind Zabini and Malfoy.
They step into the dark. The door closes.
“I thought you’d abandoned us for greener pastures,” Draco says, passing a clipboard to the woman in dismissal and walking toward him. “Jack’s been missing you all week.”
“Tell me about the Mark,” he asks, as they walk together past the outbuildings to a creek that meanders through the property. And Draco tells him about the spellwork, and the way the Marks summon, and the dark blood-curse he used on his own arm to sever the connection when he ran, leaving the skin scarred and burnt-looking. And none of that is the answer Harry wants. None of it answers,
The speech is blessedly short. A few inspiring paragraphs about the long history of the game and its importance to the wizarding world that Harry actually believes, followed by an exhortation to support the new, vital,
Which is how Harry finds himself trying to carry on a sensible conversation with the Head of Hotel Security, Marvin Masterson, while the hunched little man’s eyes keep darting to Harry’s shoulders. He’s clearly dying to ask why the country’s most famous Auror is
Hermione, seemingly vindicated, is all business now, patting his hand and drawing up his blankets.
Draco is speechless. His mind is thundering, trying to make any sense of what she’s saying and completely unable to.
“Aurors do vital work,” Potter insists, tugging at his necktie as if it’s too tight. His expression clouds, as if he’s struggling to reconcile two inconsistent ideas. “I’m just trying to get my class ready for O.W.L.s, Malfoy.”
“Lacking anything else to do, I set to studying the rings. With the help of a lot of very expensive solicitors, we were able to get the Ministry to return Father’s ring. Eventually I worked out how to stabilise the magic, and sort of… equalise the power in the bond. Mother wears Father’s ring on a chain around her neck. And the house magic is satisfied.”
“Some of these kids look like they’re still in school,” Harry says, anxious to derail that train of thought as quickly as possible.
It’s hard to imagine, sometimes—if it all comes together the way he hopes—what it will be like to leave the Aurors and have to deal with the likes of Percy and whatever bee he has in his bonnet day in and day out. But it will be worth it, Harry thinks confidently. It’s been over a decade since the War and it’s time the wizarding world faces up to reality and does what it needs to do to make sure something like that never happens again.
. He waits for Malfoy’s inevitably snide remark taking credit for saving him from himself.

“Who says I can’t finish?”
“Right,” says Harry. “But someone else here did. Someone
. Harry slumps down on the sofa, running a hand through his hair tiredly. They’d been in a little velvet bag. He remembered Draco holding it as he explained the work he’d done.
Of all people, Molly Weasley opens the door at Grimmauld Place.
Harry suddenly feels like his head is swimming, and he needs to lie down. He grabs his coat and heads to the door, but the floor tilts a little, and his hip wrenches. He feels a horrible sinking sensation like he’s falling, but then there’s strong arms around him helping him to get his balance again.
Grimmauld Place has altered a great deal since Draco’s last visit to his dreadful great aunt’s home. As the Fidelius allows the townhouse to stretch into view it feels familiar, but when Granger opens the door any similarities come to an abrupt end. The long dark hallway he remembers from childhood is now light and airy. The hideous portraits and stuffed elf heads gone in favour of smiling photos and framed children’s art. He’s taken aback for a minute, wondering if Potter has kids of his own, before remembering the details of the patient file. Single. No next of kin. Granger’s maybe. Or, the werewolf’s child his mother told him about.
, Draco Malfoy. You love Christmas and you wish your mother was well enough to celebrate it with you. You came home from France because you don’t trust anyone else to save her, even me. Probably especially me. You hate surprises, which is why you read the last page of a book before the beginning. Why you need windows in your Advent calendar and why you vanish the wrapping on a gift. You never want to be surprised again, in case it turns out as poorly as it did when we were kids.”
Harry sighs and accepts the freshly ironed robes. They are, at least, relatively simple-looking. He’d had them made at Madame Malkin’s last season, when the fashion was for some truly ridiculous frippery. Wide lapels, lace inserts. He’d stared the little tailor down and insisted on the plainest, most somber set she could make. As he straightens the fabric in the long mirror behind his bedroom door, he’s grateful for it.
Some of them still do.
“I can’t...” she starts but trails off.
“I am. I was. I might have solved it though,” Harry says excitedly, striding toward the lifts.
“And I came back here for the wedding, and it was like going back in time. Everyone wanted to talk to me about the same stuff, and they seemed to presume all the same things about who I was, and who I
At this, Ginny tips her chin up and stares at her brother with a curiously blank expression. She draws her hands out of the pocket of her hoodie, turning them over to show the room the vivid red stains across both palms.
“Brilliant!” Harry says, swinging the enormous volume towards himself and flipping it open. “So I can just find the page with Mr. Malfoy’s name—”
Harry’s heart sinks. He’d felt so relieved to have the political pressure come off his mind, and so glad to have Draco at his side and no longer under threat, that he hadn’t noticed the memories hadn’t returned as well.
“Wine, darling? Or are you casting again this afternoon?”
…” The last word curdles from him, sour.
“No different from yesterday,” she confirms, resting Potter’s hand gently back on the sheet. “The change in location hasn’t made anything worse.”
Hermione, now down to her underwear, touches the fabric with her wand and lets it shimmer and shift into a plain black swimsuit.
Wood’s mouth drops open, and he looks at Harry for back up. The thing is, Harry usually looks the other way when Oliver gets a bit exuberant with the team. He’s the captain, after all, and he’s extremely experienced, and he cares about the game as much as Harry does, so it seems weird for Harry to chastise him.
He knows, of course. He’s been dreaming about it for weeks. Hadn’t known what it meant or why, but the words that come out of her mouth are no surprise. It’s why he knows he’ll say yes even before she asks.
“What?”
He feels uneasy and paranoid. He doesn’t want to tell them both about his fears because they make absolutely no sense. No one has been in his house. He has the specialist Auror ward diagnostics he’s repeatedly cast to prove it.
“I don’t understand.”
Malfoy gives his outfit a critical look and seems about to say something, when he gets distracted by the floor behind him.
He actually has no idea what Malfoy’s living situation is like. Would he have rented here while playing in Prague, or does he own a home? Did he sell up to move to London? Harry realises with a start that he’s not even sure where Malfoy is staying in England, and thinks uneasily about the day the Ministry declared the Manor off-limits and the Aurors burned it to the ground.
When they get to the ride, Hermione takes one look at the spinning coaster and her face turns a little green. “Rock, paper?” she asks, turning to Draco.
Dennis Creevey, who followed in his brother’s footsteps and became a photographer for the
— threw an arm around his shoulder and smiled for a photograph.
“I think we should talk,” he offers, unable to think how best to start. “About… us.”
Draco’s heart sinks. Of course he would think that.
He’s about to rush into the room when that scent hits him again, and he draws back, slamming the door closed and leaning over to take a deep breath.
Prompt Twelve:
He takes a deep breath, consults his notes again, and begins to cast.
“Mother, let’s go upstairs at once. We can—”
“Complainant index - M.”
Draco pulls a disgusted face. “She would
Harry glances at Luna, nattering away about mushrooms. “He’s been learning so much: it’s fascinating. Did you know Muggle trees are connected, underground, by fungal networks? They use them to talk to one another,” she says. “It’s like magic, really.”
“Come and sit up beside me for lunch.”
Suddenly the situation gets significantly worse.
Draco gives him a dismissive wave. “The odds were long. Besides, I am very much a minority owner. Jim Cranswick and his friends are the ones we couldn’t do it without. That, together with today’s prize money for coming second. It was enough to put us over the edge and surpass Puddlemere’s offer.”
Harry swallows it gratefully and, as his head clears, he sees a note saying that the team is at breakfast and Harry should pack and join them. Malfoy’s side of the hotel room is neat and empty, his duffle zipped up on the bed.
before.”
Harry’s chest feels too tight, like his lungs don’t have the room they need to expand.
“I don’t care how you and your little friends celebrated,” Malfoy cuts him off with a dismissive wave. “I just don’t understand why someone would think it amusing or intimidating to do that. Someone wants our paths to cross. And I don’t understand why.”
“Wow, Draco this is—”
Hermione’s shoulders tense.
Harry’s mind races, trying to accommodate this new information. “What?”
They have only a week until their semi-final against the Harpies. Harry refuses to get his hopes up because the Harpies are a truly first-class squad, but the Arrows are really playing well together.
“Well, we’ve earned lunch,” Harry decides, dragging Malfoy into the Floo to the Red Lion before he can disagree.
“Where?” he breathes, thinking about just tugging Malfoy to him and Apparating them right back to his room at the Leaky, although that seems a bit obvious. And really who can wait that long, there’s got to be a perfectly good toilet somewhere in this pub. But Malfoy just smirks and walks away, toward a door at the back of the bar marked
Harry feels oddly exposed. He feels like he needs to explain himself in some way, but he doesn’t know how. Draco continues to move slowly around the room, examining the books and photos and artifacts with unrestrained fascination. He comes to an abrupt stop at the shelf nearest the door.
“When we restore the castle tomorrow, you’ll be able to do whatever you want as well,” he says earnestly, and finds he genuinely hopes that it’s true.
Hermione emerges from the house with her liquid first aid and pours glasses for Draco and Ron. Luna takes the bowl of bread and shows the children how to roll long worms of dough around the sticks they’ve prepared. She produces a bag of currants from somewhere, and they stick eyes in the top so that their creations look a little like snakes.
Potter shakes his head again mulishly, crossing his arms.
Ron brings in bowls of leftovers from the night before and starts to arrange them on the table. He gives Hugo a soft roast potato, and the baby starts mouthing at it happily.
“Did you think he was dead?” Cassie asks, the quill dancing across the parchment in front of her. “Did you check?”
, with Casey. Two times if you counted that orderly the year before, which he doesn’t because they were interrupted by a medical emergency that resulted in the potions cupboard being flung wide open and Harry Apparating away with his trousers still open.
“Harry, you can’t protect us from everything. There’s any number of things that might go wrong tomorrow. The roof of this foresaken fucking castle could fall in on us in our sleep — nothing is guaranteed. But I promise you I’m going to do my best to make sure we
talking to Malfoy and finding an attractive wizard to work out the week’s frustrations with is sort of appealing. And so before he can reconsider he’s wandering past a new Wheezes branch and round the corner into a charming little street he’s never seen before called Equal Alley.
“Really?” Draco asks, a small smile playing on his mouth, his eyes full of hope.
Harry always flies with his wand, but everything about the idea of
“I don’t know yet,” he says. “Do you want ice cream? It’s a little bit melty.” Hermione is immediately distracted when he shows her the repaired pantry and gets lost in an explanation about how to improve the spells for the chiller shelves. By the time they leave an hour later Harry’s pretty sure they’re okay, even if Ron is still looking at him a little suspiciously.
“He doesn’t
Harry takes a second to ponder the incredibly strange direction his life has taken, to find himself here, sharing a personal moment with Luna and her — was he
On the shelf are few adult titles. He reaches for a copy of
“I’ve done everything I can to keep you at arms’ length. And you just crash about the place, barrelling into my office, bringing me my favourite pastries and telling me I’m
“Outside of work, then. What does he do in spare time?” Draco waves a hand around at the modern kitchen. “Home renovation?”
His meeting takes less time than he fears, though it leaves him a bit clammy with anxious sweat, and he’s glad for the chance to spend his final afternoon chasing down another lead in Shropshire. He’s even more delighted when Padma makes a last-minute breakthrough and they find their missing witch suffering under a badly-cast Obliviate, working as the receptionist for a Muggle taxi company with no idea where she’s meant to be.
Prompt Eleven:
Luna looks grateful for the change in subject, and that twists in Harry’s gut a little. She really does seem to want them there to help her celebrate, which makes the whole thing even more awful. She launches into a discussion of colour schemes and flowers and the Malfoy family chapel. Hermione sinks back in her chair, momentarily defeated. Harry is not fooled, however. There’s a steely set to her eyebrows that gives away the fact that she definitely does not intend to let any of this go.
Weasley has grown as tall as Draco, but twice as broad. His outrageous ginger hair is spilling all over his face, and he has an actual human baby propped on one hip. The sight would be comical, but he’s wearing an expression so threatening that Draco takes two abrupt steps back.
“I want you to stick around to find out how it ends.”
“You said he’s back because of his mother?”
It’s too much, all of a sudden: this life his parents lived and had snatched from them. This life he was
Harry’s so startled by the idea of Draco Malfoy knowing what an airport baggage scanner is that he loses his train of thought.
naked torso wrapped in nothing but Christmas lights, one hand cradling a bunch of bulbs suggestively to preserve his own modesty. Like a very tacky Roman sculpture.
“What do you think will happen, after?” Hannah asks, looking around the common room.
Draco wakes feeling worse. He looks ghastly, skin colourless even by his own standards, and there’s an ache in his lower back that twinges as he gets out of the shower. He must be coming down with something. He thinks it will be best to refer Granger to Bernard, a French oneironaught who’s almost as good as he is. That way he can leave this whole mess behind him and go home. He sends a message to that effect, wards his room, and goes back to sleep.
he be like that? Nothing for him has ever lasted. Everyone died, everyone left, every glimmer of hope he had was always snuffed out within hours. He was let down left and right by adults he should have been able to trust. And in the end, he learns that he wasn’t even supposed to survive at all. He was supposed to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms. So he did.”
“Me neither,” Potter huffs out, running a finger back and forth along the gold lettering spelling out
“I understand.” Draco doesn’t really want to hear it. He wonders if he can save the charity by signing it over to someone else. Blaise, perhaps. He wouldn’t
Harry swallows hard.
He’s making himself a bowl of pasta when a Hogwarts owl arrives. At first he’s worried that McGonagall has had to hold the students back for some reason, but it’s just Hannah saying that she has the evening off and will bring the students down herself.
He wants to make excuses for it, or point out that it’s not normally this bad, obviously, but Malfoy seems focussed only on the advent calendar.
Luna lets him snack on a pile of something called “no-bake bliss balls” that probably retail for more than he makes in a day, while he tells her about his grand plans to host Christmas, Kreacher’s disbelief at being pressed into service in such an outrageous way, and the run of extremely bad luck he’s been having.
Draco takes a long swig from his bottle of water, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes.
giving up. I thought I’d cracked it, you know.” He gives a self-pitying smile, running a hand through his mop of hair. “If I didn’t let anyone get too close to me, then I didn’t have to go through the pain of losing anyone ever again.”
. Harry stares at it in confusion.
Lucius Malfoy only deigns to join them when they head into the formal dining room for the meal. Harry is shocked at his appearance. Somehow Harry had imagined he would look more or less the same as he had the last time he’d seen him, perhaps more gaunt from spending a decade in prison. But Malfoy Senior looks like a completely different person. He’s gained weight, and lost his hair, his pale features seeming pudgy and unhealthy. His fancy robes pull tight across his abdomen, and his eyes seem beady. He doesn’t bother to greet anyone, even his son, as he takes his seat at the head of the table.
Harry realises he’s staring.
Harry doesn’t, really. But getting Ron to talk about the Wheezes store is like trying to get blood out of a stone. Even when he asks direct questions, Ron gives him one-word answers, usually with some dismissive gesture. As if there’s no possible way Harry could genuinely be interested and is only asking to be polite.
The founders look at one another, as if they’re carrying on an unspoken conversation. Rowena looks at Harry briefly, and then back at the other three, before she nods. He sees her step forward, right into the very space that Luna is occupying. Luna gasps, suddenly flooded with a bright light, her skin glowing. Before Harry can say or do anything, he feels a surge of energy unlike anything he’s ever experienced. He looks down at his own hands, fiery and illuminated from within.
Harry finds himself gaping at her.
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Draco can’t hear it. He’s too weak, and he knows as soon as Harry makes some sort of filthy suggestion he’ll be tugging him through the Floo himself, all his resolutions to the contrary be damned.
“You know what? I used to think — I still think, sometimes, that you and I drifted apart because you can see it. You can see

If Harry does a sort of victory wiggle as he walks down the corridor, no one needs to know.
Now he can see the little elf weighing his next words carefully.

He tells them about the progress he’s been making with Leila, and about how good Draco had been to work with since their trip to Prague, and tries to ignore the slightly smug look Ron and Hermione exchange, as if he isn’t right there and doesn’t know exactly what they’re thinking. He wants them to feel exactly as betrayed as he did when he tells them about the charm on the broom.

“Huh.”
Prompt Twenty Three:
Draco wakes to a stabbing pain in his abdomen, surrounded by chaos and noise.
“So dumb,” Harry teases, digging around in Draco’s drawer for a pair of socks. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asks, waving a pair over his shoulder. It ramps up Draco’s irritation.
Harry thinks back to Malfoy’s extremely bad mood when he arrived at Harry’s bedside.
since his return.
Potter looks to be fifteen or sixteen, maybe. It’s hard to tell because he’s not as thin as he was in school. He’s in Gryffindor robes, but has a bright blue Ravenclaw scarf looped around his neck. The glasses are the same ones he’d worn in the field. There’s still no scar.
Two days after
“You don’t understand, Draco. You left Britain and didn’t look back. You carved a new path for yourself. Put yourself back together.”
Sure enough, Ron is limping in to the room a little cautiously, but looking well-rested and not at all like he’s suffered from any particular lack of things to eat over the last few days. Hermione immediately bursts into tears, dashing across and launching herself at him, and he scoops her up into a kiss.
“Here it is,” Hermione finally announces, triumphant. The glass case is dusty, and she fumbles with the ornate lock on it for several minutes, before reluctantly turning to Harry. He touches his wand to the keyhole and it clicks open. The little diary seems unassuming but Hermione handles it with great care, slipping it into a soft-looking cloth bag that she pulls from her pack.
“You just let him go?” Potter asks, curious.
, Hermione. He was sliced to ribbons. We need to go.”
That’s a name Harry hasn’t seen or heard in a very long time.
“Quidditch scores,” he racked his sluggish brains trying to imagine a social conversation with Malfoy. “That show about the people stuck on the island with the polar bear. Where he got that sweater from with the really soft blue wool.”
He slaps the folder closed and shoves it away from him. The pile of papers slides a little, and Malfoy’s latest shiny invitation is right there where Harry had tossed it. He thrusts his hands under his thighs, staring at it. The anxiety inside him feels like a living thing, moving around in his gut. He
“Regardless. I need to go to your house.”
“It’s not….” Harry starts to protest, but then he realises he’s not really sure how he’s going to finish that sentence, and Ron has winked at him and disappeared off to the bar in any event.
Draco pulls an indignant face. “
Luna doesn’t seem to notice, patting him comfortingly on the arm as she waltzes away, singing, “
“Oh, Harry this is brilliant, this is...those ingredients are so heavily controlled. God knows how he got his hands on them, but he’ll never have been able to cover his tracks completely. We’ll be able to find him.”
Malfoy takes a deep breath, as if steeling himself for battle. He certainly doesn’t look like someone in possession of

Hermione gives him a practised eye-roll. “Please. The last time you completed a case report, Robards said—and I’m quoting here—
“It won’t be like that,” Harry says sadly, reaching into his jacket for his wand. Draco panics.
“My mother’s scared to use cleaning spells,” Nott shrugged uncomfortably. “It’s been in her family for generations and she can’t bear the thought of it not working any more.” Draco spent a week with books open all over his sofa, and the runner laid out on a sheet on the floor as he used delicate needlepoint spells to unpick the design and heritage-grade restoration charms to clean the fabric. Nott’s mother was so delighted she mentioned it to every single one of her friends and somehow it ended up in the
No one has anything to ask.
“Molly knits them every year,” he explains, tugging self-consciously at the bobbly wool of one baggy sleeve.
Neville nods thoughtfully. “Minerva—Headmistress McGonagall—has some ideas about it, too. The Hogwarts rolls only complete themselves each year immediately before the admission letters are to be sent in July. We think that’s so the books aren’t full of the names of children who might never actually attend the school because they move away with their families and so on. Historically children didn’t always survive until schooling.” His face twists into a grimace. “Plagues, dragons, venomous plants and so on. Anyway, she believes she can work back from that roll magic to identify the children earlier, when they’re younger.”
“Yes, but at least if I’m here, we can head straight to the restaurant,” he reasons. “Besides, my house is a bit of a warzone.”
Granger looks up from her lunch, studying him with a curious expression.
“Especially you, Hermione,” Luna continues, tucking her knees to her chest and rolling up to sit. “I know it must be hard to take the time to try a different path not knowing where Ron is.”

Suddenly, Harry’s sixteen all over again watching blood bloom across Malfoy’s white shirt. There’s an impossible,
The door to the Room of Hidden Things is closed, but it’s still right there in the wall. Blackened around the edges, soot stains spreading out from it across the pale sandstone.
Ron looks around at the others wildly. “This is ridiculous! Ginny obviously did not kill Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy’s cast the sodding spell wrong or he —”
Harry’s replayed the raid in his head almost constantly for days. He feels like the answer is just beyond the reach of the tips of his fingers.
Which isn’t true, of course. The Ministry had tried again and again in the early years. Teams of professors. Experts from Europe and North America. And when those attempts failed, they were followed by fortune-seekers and fame-chasers, before the Ministry ruled that the next generation of Gilderoy Lockharts weren’t going to make a name for themselves getting badly injured at the school and sealed the grounds up like a vault.
“Why are you here?”
“THANK YOU for your assistance,” he calls a little too enthusiastically to the clerk who gives him a bemused look, and Harry drags him out onto the footpath before he embarrasses them further.
, Draco thinks but doesn’t say.
“Dinner’s through here, apparently,” Neville points, and Harry joins him. The doors in front of them open onto yet another dining room, but this one is much smaller than the others they’ve been in over the weekend, with a family-sized table set for only five.
“I brought bread and ham. If a sandwich isn’t beneath you.”
, Draco thinks.
The witch on stage is winding up into a tuneless wail.
“Fuck, I’m sorry. Sorry.”
“Rough luck,” Neville says sympathetically, stacking a pile of ivy in a corner. “For her I mean. I mean, also for you. You know what I mean.”
Harry hugs her tightly with one arm, trying not to squash the flowers. “Thank you,” he whispers fiercely against her hair.
Gasnard gives him a supercilious smile, revealing an ugly and misshapen row of sharp teeth. “Oh, no, Mister Potter. Now that we have received your account opening identity and magical lineage verification requirements, we will need to process your application. You can return tomorrow at this time.”
And each year, Harry just sort of assumed eventually it would be his turn. It was true that being an Auror didn’t exactly make dating easy and being the Saviour of the Wizarding World complicated things further still. So, yes, he was a bit prone to picking up Muggle men who had no idea who he was, because that was just simpler. But it wasn’t as if he was
Harry’s bursting with questions. He wants to know what Malfoy could have written that would have convinced Neville to go in the first place, and he wants to know why Neville let him apologise when even
“I don’t want to talk about it. I
“There’s a list of spells inside. You can change the colours as much as you like. Have them match the music you’re playing even. Bloody brilliant.”
“I think Lewis Carroll may have been a wizard after all, Belle,” he sighs, putting the bookmark back in place and closing the novel.
Harry sputters in protest.
Nothing happens. The dark water laps slowly below them.
. The breeze in the park suddenly feels chilly. Draco rubs at his arms.
“Suspended Auror.”
“What are you doing? I know Dawlish gives you a free reign for campaigning but you’ve left me with a tonne of paperwork.” Ron doesn’t seem that put out, just curious.
swanning around wizarding London someone would surely have said something by now.
“Draco knows quite a lot about spells,” Luna says, pulling rocket leaves from her salad and arranging them along the edge of her plate like little green soldiers. “Tell them, Draco.”
Harry looks up in surprise when he realises Teddy’s addressing the question to him.
Harry ducks his head, hoping his own smile doesn’t give him away.

permission.”
Harry’s startled by the change of subject, but he supposes it makes sense if whoever is behind this is trying to get him to drop out.
“Ron can rest here tomorrow while we make sure the path through the third floor is clear. We might as well make this our base of operations. It seems as safe as anywhere.”
Harry doesn’t seem annoyed as he tucks the covers around Rose and waves his wand to sweep away a particularly spiky plastic dinosaur before Draco steps on it.
Malfoy’s imperious rap on his front door shakes him out of his reverie. Malfoy hasn’t changed out of his well-fitted work uniform, which does absolutely nothing for Harry’s equilibrium. A situation that only worsens when—having stepped carefully across the last of the ice to the sitting room—Malfoy removes his outer robes and rolls up his shirtsleeves.
Harry feels his face heat. He smiles back.
Harry goes to draw his hand back, but Draco takes it and holds it, looking him in the eyes. His expression is sincere and open.
“Or what’s coming next,” adds Malfoy, reaching past him and taking the spoon.
“How did you —”
“Come on, Parkinson,” Harry finally splutters out. “It’s not like we’re squabbling over house points. I disagree on a fundamental level with the way he plays the game, the way he teaches the game, even the way he communicates with the players.”
She’s wearing a daffodil yellow dress and a necklace made of seashells threaded on red twine, and her hair is fastened up with what looks like matching coloured pencils. It’s a lot for Harry to take in all at once.
to see what we’ve been reduced to.”
One Wednesday Draco finds Harry bending a length of copper pipe outside the stables even though Jack is away in Spain on holiday, so against his better judgement he invites him inside for lunch.
“Yes! And I said that they call them
Later, as Harry shucks off his jeans and slides into bed, he thinks about the last time he’d seen Draco Malfoy. Right here on the school grounds. He’d watched his mother clutch at him desperately as his parents hurried him away. He remembers the way Draco had glanced back over his shoulder at Harry just once, and he remembers the look of relief on his tear-stained face.
“I didn’t think you had it in you, son. I’ll say that now it’s done.”
Harry straightens up with a start. “What do you mean?”
“No, you were right,” she cuts him off, waving his protest away before he can even voice it. “He’s clever and committed. His spellwork is incredible. And even if
“What?” Harry’s startled by the segue.
this?” asks Draco, giving him a slightly bemused smile.
“You should get out of here,” Ron says, frowning after Dawlish. “Until we know who’s involved in this mess. Merlin knows what they might make you do.”
“It’s not a real unicorn,” Neville mumbles, around a mouthful of toast. Harry wonders where he got it from. It seems much more practical than the pastries.
“Potter?”
“I didn’t ask her to hire you. I don’t need your help. Tell your little Auror friends about the garden if you like. They’ll know it has nothing to do with last night, but it’ll give them something to charge me with. Weasley will be delighted.”
Lucius flushes a dark magenta, his wine-coloured cheeks suffused by rage.
“He does, and that’s the end. She’s doomed to stay down there forever. He’s doomed to leave her behind. The way it’s told, his mistake was doubt: he should have just trusted that she was behind him and she could have come with him. But what if his mistake was expecting her to leave in the first place? The past is the past, Harry. I mean, look at us! But it’s okay if you can’t leave it all perfectly behind. It’s okay to look back at the darkness, and remember what you lost. That’s not the darkness following you. That’s just how you move forward.”
That brings Harry up short. “What do you mean?”
McGonagall begins to fire off a succession of Patronuses: to the Ministry, the Hogwarts Governors, St Mungo’s. Soon they’re surrounded on the school steps by people and it feels overwhelming after so many days of isolation.
Harry reckons he could have lived without hearing a glowing spectral dog say, “This better not be a kinky sex thing, mate.” An owl arrives moments later with the written instructions for the counter-charm. Harry’s room falls blissfully quiet and Harry falls into an exhausted sleep.
Harry glances quickly at Ron, but he doesn’t react at all.
, Harry. If Robards finds you here he’ll do his nut.”
“I don’t know.” Harry tries to keep his voice patient.
He looks up at Harry, incredulous.
“I’d share,” he says, with an unapologetic shrug, “but I seem to have finished this one. First one back to the picnic makes the martinis. Coming, Weasley?” He turns and strides off through the trees, humming a few bars that sound suspiciously to Harry like a refrain from
“It might be nothing, I don’t know. There’s a whole bunch of hoops to jump through before I can get it sorted and go home. Bill needs to sign the whole thing off.”

“You created gay marriage,” he says, wonderingly, out of nowhere, pressing a kiss to Draco’s bicep.
Harry tries to work out if he’s asking because he wants Ron to leave or to stay, but Malfoy’s motives — as ever — remain opaque.
“No,” Luna replies. “I’m a little sad that we had to kill the plant, though. If we’d had a little more time —”
“Listen, I’m knackered,” Harry finally sighs, what seems like hours later. His eyes are swimming and his neck aches, and there’s a weird lump in his throat about the idea of discussing sleeping arrangements. He needs to be somewhere Malfoy is not, so he can stop thinking about how ‘hot scholar’ is definitely a look that suits him. “I’ll leave some pyjamas and a towel in the guest room.”
Draco nods, looking awkward but pleased.
It’s an ugly thought — prioritising where their Healer should be. Harry thinks again about the teaspoon in Hermione’s pocket and feels a fresh wave of irritation. He shoves his chair back with a scrape and goes to recheck his pack.
“I should go,” Potter mutters, and whatever this strange moment was seems to have come to an end. Draco rubs clammy palms on his robes and gets back to his feet, but Potter doesn’t move. “To America, maybe,” he continues, looking up at Draco. “Have you been there?”
“That fast drop at the end was pretty good,” Harry muses.
“Not very inspiring?”

Hermione gives a start and turns to face him. She can’t have slept. Even her lips are pale, and her eyes are dark and hollow with exhaustion.
There’s a sudden snort from their left. Harry turns and looks at Lucius Malfoy in surprise. He hadn’t been aware that anyone else was listening to them.
The gold-edged invite sits propped on the mantel, oddly bright in the dim light of the sitting room, and it catches Harry’s eye every time he walks past. It means he has to keep
The French doors to the patio stand open in the spring sun, and Harry’s relieved to find an urn of hot coffee waiting. He loads up a plate with tiny, fussy-looking pastries and glances around for a seat.
“Do you think it was a heart attack?” Bulstrode asks. “He did seem pretty angry last night. Maybe it was just all too much for him.”
have all done. We should have done a lot of things.”
. Harry always managed to find a new one to break, half the time without even trying. Even Ron eventually resorted to gently (and then not so gently) suggesting Harry take the Auror Manual home with him on the weekend to brush up a little before their chances of promotion were permanently affected.
Harry hadn’t thought to warn Ron in advance that he was bringing Malfoy, which seems like a colossal error in judgement once Ron catches a glimpse of him and gives Harry the smuggest grin he’s ever seen in his life.
“Right, let’s go.” Neville takes the lead as they turn back to the door. “I’m ravenous and if Ron has eaten the last of the —” His ankle catches on an overturned chair, which knocks into the bookcase beside it. Harry watches as a very large, very old-looking book rocks back and forth on the top shelf and then falls.
“How did you learn all this?”
Harry’s mouth falls open.
“I can’t promise you I can clear his name,” Harry warns. “But I will find out what happened.”
, with your
“Our best-case scenario has us in and out in a day. I have absolutely no confidence that’s going to happen.”
“If you were an Animagus, what animal would you be?” Child Potter asks him, eyes bright and curious.
It’s an idea that makes Harry unaccountably irritated—vengeful cretins wasting valuable Auror time. He leaves Hermione with a tin of gingerbread biscuits, and heads to the hospital.
what we had to change to send the ghosts on downstairs, you didn’t even have to look anything up. You were able to work out how to combine magic with me just by experiencing it, I didn’t even have to teach you. You can do this, Draco. I know you can.”
Draco finally relaxes again, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Trust you to be a sodding romantic. Anyone else would be up for frantic, desperate, end-of-the-world sex.”
Kingsley had left him bound in. Harry had thought back, to whispering “I am about to die” before continuing into the Forbidden Forest, and knew then and there that there’d be no question of Draco being cast out. Not on his watch.
,” Draco snaps his fingers. “But it makes no sense to her on the page.”
Molly opens her mouth and closes it again. Ron looks like he’s about to say something but Hermione elbows him fiercely in the ribs and so he just reaches for the roast potatoes instead.
They spend two full days this way, working with a rotating cast of Malfoy’s friends and former teammates, who open up a whole new world of positions, wandholds, passes, and plays. The unsanctioned players balk at the rules the Arrows have to follow governing which spells they can and can’t use in the League, and Harry finds himself having to be the fun police more than once when they try and teach moves that would be firmly out of bounds. But in general he’s delighted. The team seem happy and motivated, and if he’s being honest, playing better together than they ever have.
Harry tries not to think about that final day of the war very often — about the lurid, deformed little creature he saw at Kings Cross, or wherever that place really was.
“Why cast the hex from under the broom like that?” Morgan asks.
“So you can see why,” Harry presses on, “it looks a little like it would be in Malfoy’s interests, that his father isn’t around any more.”
It’s only just lunchtime but Harry’s so furious and out of sorts he tells Luna she can have the team for pilates and Floos straight to Ron and Hermione’s. One of the advantages of having a best mate who’s a stay-at-home dad is that he’s around for Harry to rant at in the middle of the day. He finds Ron in the sitting room. Hugo’s crawling around with a stuffed dragon and Ron is poking intermittently at a charmed pair of knitting needles.
“And you
, Draco thinks.
“But it was just a civil ceremony. You made it mean something.” Harry rights himself again and manages to get the jeans up over his arse, leaning over to dig around on the floor for his shirt. He emerges triumphant, tugging it over his head. Draco’s disappointed to see the stag tattoo disappear beneath his sleeve.
“Some sort of practical joke, mate. Has to be.”
Hermione, meanwhile, unzips her jeans.
“I live in Vienna.” He says it as much to himself as he does to Potter. The time for subtlety has passed.
“The protective magic was triggered when a Slytherin — Voldemort — breached the sanctity of the castle during the battle. The ritual to restore it requires sacrifice. The magic of the person standing for Slytherin powers the rest of the spells, and it’s not at all clear that person will survive.”
There are a few Ministry bigwigs in attendance, but mostly the crowd is friends and family. Harry ushers everyone into the school hall, a room with high arched windows that must have been a chapel when the school was first built. They sit on new bench seats that have presumably replaced the pews.
“It was unexpected, it wasn’t… unwelcome.”
“So I went,” Malfoy agrees. “And it was the usual rubbish. More of what you heard at dinner, really. With the added affront of
Draco, be reasonable. What are you going to do, hide away here and let Viktor take care of you for all that time?”
Harry feels defensive and more than a little foolish. “Whose side are you on?” he complains, but without any force behind it. “I thought you wanted me to do any job but this.”
Harry starts to venture, “Maybe you could—”
And there, sitting on the table in front of him, magic humming pleased and whole, is Lily Potter’s ring.
Draco is staring open-mouthed at Harry, but he’s on a roll and can’t stop now.
“What is this?”
Luna stops folding the pile of charmed bandages she uses for basic sprains. “I don’t think there’s any
“It’s none of your business,” he manages with a sigh, kicking off his boots and lying down to face the wall.
Ron pulls a face.
Harry swallows over a lump in his throat. He hasn’t thought much about his stupid cat in the last few weeks, but he feels unaccountably emotional at the idea that she might be gone.
“Then I’ll Side-Along you,” Draco says with a laugh. “Get a bag from the pantry to put them in.”
He watches as two junior hotel staff members sort out a pile of Christmas decorations for the Muggle storefront that hides the Langley from view. Harry admires the enormous heap of tinsel and golden bells. Nothing's exploded in a few days, but he figures he should stay well clear, just in case.
Draco laughs, and Harry is so startled by the unfamiliar sound that he blinks in surprise before the pain catches up with him, turning his reaction to a hiss and a wince.
“Can we double?” he shouts at Draco.
“Who turned up?”
“There’s nothing wrong with the way that Malfoy cast the spell.” Ginny’s voice is quiet but clear. “It worked. My hands are red because I went to Lucius Malfoy’s study.”
“Yes, absolutely. Everyone will be free to leave at that point,” Cassie assures them.
“Were they yours?” Harry asks, his voice coming out too loud in the thick silence of the small room.
Still annoyed about Harry’s attitude, Draco orders a bottle. “I’ve done enough for the day,” he says with a scowl.
proposition that it forced Harry, unaccustomed to political life, to rise to the challenge.
“This is…” he trails off, confused.
“You’ll be able to play,” Leila nods, her expression cautious. “But you won’t be able to
Ron just seems flushed and irritated. Harry thinks back to the night before and how incredibly awkward this must all be for him now, given his dalliance with Parkinson. Harry would almost sympathise, but really, there’s nothing about his own nighttime run-in with Malfoy that he wants to consider too closely at the moment.
“Well, Dawlish for one,” Ron insists, as if that ought to be obvious. “He’s the Head Auror, Harry. And he’s been your number-one supporter politically. He doesn’t want you to drop out.”
, but can’t bring himself to ask.
haven’t wanted you at the dinners because of the charity,” Draco says softly, taking Harry’s hand in his again and lacing their fingers together.
A whistle echoes around the ground and the players swoop into the air. Harry realises the shaky video Parkinson showed him and the owners of the League weeks ago barely did this game justice. In fact, he half wonders if it might have been filmed at a slower-than-normal speed. The players are so quick they’re almost a blur, and he finds himself constantly glancing at the giant replay screens to properly appreciate a feint or pass. The teams seem to fly almost without patterns, players appearing right where needed to catch a Quaffle and then gone again before a hex can catch them off guard.
“Why dinner parties?” he asks. His voice, after so long, is a surprise. Pitched lower than Draco was expecting. More grown up.
Eventually, Harry tires of the whole thing. The feeling of peace he had when he first entered the forest has long since given way: he keeps getting tangled in flitterbloom or stung by nettles, and at one point he disturbs a nest of fairies in a thicket and they rise up angrily and follow him, buzzing around his head like angry hornets. He slumps against a nearby trunk, breathing heavily, and thinks he should head back for a hot shower and join Hermione in the library after all.
Draco frowns a little. “What do you mean?”
They sit and warm up for a moment, the children chattering excitedly about their Christmas plans and what gifts they’re hoping to get. Malfoy and Luna get lost in a conversation about some new potion she’s working on, and Harry excuses himself to use the loo. He glances in at the bedroom as he passes it, admiring the brightly-decorated little Christmas tree at the foot of the bed, and the soft folded rugs hanging neatly against the wall. The two of them have made such a home for themselves together here. It makes something ache in Harry’s chest.
here, like, specifically her house. He just meant wizarding Britain in general. Either way, he seems to have broken their truce. He casts about for a more neutral topic of conversation.
Draco leans heavily against the wall, rubbing hard at his eyes with the heel of one hand. “Your absolute lack of understanding of even basic magical theory will never not astound me.”
Malfoy shoots forward in his seat, staring at the wizened little elf in earnest. “What do you mean,
He scowls at Malfoy and looks where he’s indicating. Underneath the closed door of the Potions classroom, a slick, shiny-looking substance has started to leak out, barely making its way into the corridor. The surface of it bubbles slightly.
Harry’s grateful for the sentiment, but he shakes his head. “No, I know. I’m not apologising for that, exactly. But that was your weekend, and all it did was cause drama and upset some people.”
Cassie gives him a considering look. “Puts you in a bit of a bind, doesn’t it?”
"He's no more capable of killing than you are."
“We need to find a way through the third floor classrooms so we can get up to the library,” Hermione points.
Harry nods, grateful for the change of subject.
As the weeks pass, he spends a couple of days a month in Hogsmeade and an unreasonable amount of time back home in America with his head in a fireplace at the school in Long Island, making plans with Neville. Whenever he’s in Britain, he tries to get down to London to have dinner with Andromeda and Teddy, but he’s always careful to make sure it’s not on a Sunday. Andromeda never mentions Draco, and when Teddy does, she seems to be quick to change the subject. Harry supposes it’s for the best.
He lets out his breath.
Harry feels his face heat.
Draco struggles to remember who she is.
He hears a wolf-whistle from somewhere below him and is pleased to see Draco flying up to join him. They’d spent the weekend celebrating extensively, dividing their time between the bed and the bathtub and working their way through a case of very expensive wine that Parkinson owled over with a card that read “
rings?” She looks horrified. “Oh darling, no.”
“You’re off the hook for Fridays until after you win.” Ron reaches around Draco for the marmalade. “But you both better be there the week after, or Rose will be unimpressed. She’s been learning more ferret facts.”
Harry forgot to notice the colour of the front door again. Really, who thinks to look? At least the bed is right there, and—
As a teenager, Draco had always affected boredom with the whole endeavour, but looked forward to his friends coming over, tucking themselves away in Draco’s rooms with smuggled flasks of firewhisky and, later, joints of gillyweed, their parents none the wiser downstairs.
“We continued to write to one another, while Draco was studying in France.”
Draco shakes his head. “All of us.”
He tries to snap himself out of it. No point in being maudlin. Harry has one Christmas Eve tradition of his very own and that’s to take treacle tarts to the War Orphanage. He orders them weeks in advance from the Hogwarts house elves and they came through the Floo yesterday, boxed up and tied with pretty green bows.
Draco feels his face heat and glances around for a distraction. He looks at a photo on the wall that seems a little clearer than the others. In it, Potter stands with his arm around a witch with red hair. The face is still indistinct.
Draco tilts his head slightly. “You really asked for permission.”
Harry decides the conversation is straying into territory that makes it far too dangerous to continue and closes his playbook, putting it on his nightstand and extinguishing the lamp. He hears Malfoy come out of the bathroom a while later, moving around and fiddling with his duffle again, drawing back the covers and sliding into bed.
Draco nods and gets to his feet. “Mother, you should come with us.”
Ron’s eyebrows hit his hairline, as if he can’t believe his luck, but Cassie is the one who steps forward. “This is a pretty unusual situation,” she says.
“Don’t —”
Harry pauses to draw breath, thinking about Draco spinning over him upside down in the sky.
“I didn’t mean you. You should stay here,” he says softly, but she blows her nose and shakes her head. “I need to be active. Take my mind off it,” she tells him.
“Pans will be fine. She’s a big girl. She’ll take all the credit she wants when she needs to.”
“My…” His brain races. He didn’t
“Real animals?” Millicent Bulstrode turns up her nose. “No one who was anyone ever hunted
while you were fixing my mother’s ring?”
“We’ll make a joint statement, you don’t need to do it on your own” he says, quietly, pushing Harry gently back against the sofa and curling to lie beside him, one hand smoothing down the stupid sweater and fixing his collar. “Pansy’s been nagging me to do regular press anyway.” He presses his cheek to Harry’s chest, revelling in the way Harry’s arms come around him, holding him close.
“Wrong way,” he mutters, pushing past her.
Malfoy sucks in a sharp breath and scrubs his hand through his hair. “What…How did it…” He trails off as if he doesn’t even know how to ask.
Leila gives him a fierce nod and a smile, before swooping in to gather her things.
He takes Draco’s trembling hand in his.
It doesn’t make any sense. Draco feels his heart racing. There’s no reason for Potter to know what he does for a living. Granger’s never given any indication that she’s told him. He shakes his head to clear it.
Luna frowns.
“Really?” she pulls a face. “I think I’ve only ever seen them cooked. They’re weird.”
“Ron works
The profile is exactly the sort of trash Harry’s come to expect from the
spell. Assuming it succeeds, Harry and Draco will concentrate on getting the oak doors at the top of the stairs open while Luna dashes up as quickly as she can.”
“Harry!” The bartender is not the same one who served him earlier, and he seems delighted to see him here. “It’s been weeks. What have you and that boy of yours been doing?”
“I mean look at this.” She tugs a plastic packet out of her bag. “Someone bought me this in the Secret Santa.”
it’s not Obliviation. And you should count yourself lucky you can go to a hospital in this country at all.”
But Malfoy silences Harry before he can finish his sentence with a kiss that borders on vicious, walking him a few steps backwards until they hit the bed. Harry tugs at the stupid tasselled belt of Malfoy’s robe, shoving it off his shoulders and grabbing a handful of his silk pyjama shirt, before pulling him down on top of himself as they tumble back onto the covers.
And so Draco had thrown himself into his study and his work and tried to put it all behind him.
She looks down at her plate, as if trying to work out how much she should say.
. Whatever happens to me here, it can’t be worse than what I’ve already been through. It can’t be worse than realising I lost any shot at a moral compass before I even came of age. It can’t be worse than having pure evil move into my home and embrace me as a son. Living every day trying to avoid my deranged aunt or a psychotic werewolf. Having to go on the run because the alternative was life in Azkaban. Watching my mother cry herself to sleep every night over my pathetic excuse for a father. Struggling to earn enough money just so we can eat in any given week.”
“Harry, you know memory is never reliable when you’ve been knocked out. If I’d thought it would offer us anything I’d have made you look sooner.”
Neville is starting to look extremely confused and so Harry starts to pace in front of the fireplace as he thinks of the quickest way to explain. “Something’s happened to our memories, Nev. Or, maybe not our memories, but our minds, certainly.”
Teddy has a shower and manages to clean off most of the grass stains. Draco pulls out clean clothes for him and fetches a bottle of wine from the pantry.
and tucks it under the edge of his plate, smiling at Pansy’s latest glowing column, full of blind speculation that among last week’s guests at Draco’s dinner there had been a full Veela who was
“It’s the principle of the thing,” Hermione insists. “Celebrating that kind of imagined cruelty is barbaric.”
“I mean, that
Ron ignores this, looking down at his notes. Harry glances back and forth between the pair of them, wondering how Ron is going to deal with this awkward situation. He’ll need to record that the two of them were together the night before, but Harry’s pretty sure he’s not going to want that to play out right now, in front of Harry and Cassie.
“You’re not that remarkable, Potter. Your cock hasn’t had that profound an impact on my life,” Malfoy retorts.
“We’re just having some trouble finding a prosecutor to sign off on the arrest, what with it being a holiday,” Cassie explains, gathering her notes together on the coffee table.
have to say seriously,” Harry insists. Malfoy scoffs.
“Take Teddy?” she finishes, with a smug little smile. “I’d be delighted. We’re heading home after this; I’m not going back to work.”
“No way. He’d be in Azkaban if he was.”
“You’re still visiting the hospital?” Hermione asks, always one to pick up on the smaller details.
Hogwarts is decorated for Christmas, bowers of holly hang in the archways, and snow is thick on the windowsills outside.
Harry wants to be exasperated but it’s a neat trick.
“But I kept looking because the stories were so lovely. That little girl you helped who was allergic to the spattergroit potion. And that memory reordering spell you made for the witch whose Muggle mother had Alzheimer’s.”

. That I wave my wand around and sometimes hit paydirt and pass that off as a speciality, but I assure you if you had concentrated at all during training you might have understood that it is both more complex and
“How much money?”
Out in the corridor, he realises he has no idea which way Malfoy will have gone. He makes a guess, and heads toward the West Wing of the Manor. It turns out he doesn’t have to go far. Malfoy is leaning against a wall in a long hall lined with old and slightly menacing-looking suits of armour.
He dresses quickly and sends a Patronus to Ron telling him he’s going to be a little late and not to worry. If he tells Ron that Malfoy’s here he’ll be over in a heartbeat with Dawlish and Merlin-knows-who-else hot on his heels. And Harry just needs a little time before that happens. Time to work out what’s going on.
dress,” she says, as she turns her attention to Hermione, who flushes in what Harry can only assume is annoyance. “Wasn’t McIlvoy a pill today?”
She gives him more potions to swallow, and the colour starts to come back to his face.
“She said as much this evening,” Potter agrees, topping up his own glass. “And she said that
He’s expecting some sort of sneering
The honour of hosting the final goes to Puddlemere, ahead on points for the season. Harry longs for the comfort of the battered Appleby stands as he looks around at the shiny away changing rooms, haunted a little by the memories of playing here so long ago. He’d thought he’d reached the pinnacle back then—everything he’d wanted to achieve in Quidditch. But now, looking at the faces of his extremely nervous team, he realises how wrong he’d been.
“I think we should discuss this, Hermione,” Neville argues. “This whole trip has turned out to be bloody dangerous, and now Ron’s been badly injured. I wanted this to succeed as much as any of us, but we need to be realistic about this.”
Hermione eyes their lopsided eaves with a smile. “You know, George sells one that—”
. Give me some Pepper-Up, I’ll be fine.”  His throat does feel thick, and his limbs are tired. The nosebleed is annoying: his sinuses must be inflamed.
Harry feels conflicted in her presence. He hasn’t seen Narcissa since he spoke on her behalf at the trials all those years ago. He will always owe her a debt, he supposes, even if most people would consider it repaid by keeping her out of prison. But Harry’s always been conscious of the fact that everything she did, she did for Malfoy, not out of any broader sense of right and wrong. Certainly not out of any desire to save Harry. And here she is, a decade on, still married to Voldemort’s right-hand man. It’s hard to muster much in the way of kind feelings toward her.
Harry studies his profile. His bright blond hair falling softly across his face in the breeze. His stupidly patrician features. The long, lean lines of him — tall and strong and unbroken, even after everything.
An ugly silence descends on the kitchen. Harry puts the plate of eggs down on the table with a noisy thunk.
. He has been so convinced he understood what Draco wanted, what they were doing, both of them. As the pieces of the weekend rearrange themselves, he is beginning to think that he doesn’t understand at all.
“You’ve gone pink,” Potter says quietly, stating the fucking obvious the way only a drunk person can. And before Draco can splutter any kind of excuse, he’s reaching out a curious finger and tracing one of his cheekbones. And then Draco can’t do anything at all. His throat dries up, and he doesn’t seem to be able to draw away, which would obviously be the sensible thing to do. It’s like a bodybind gone wrong, and given their history, that seems strangely appropriate. He wonders if Potter is about to take the opportunity to break
He turns to find Luna and Malfoy cleaning and remaking the other beds. “We might as well stay here,” Luna explains, passing a pile of pillowcases to him. “Ron’s not going to be up to moving.”
“Thank you,” he says, sincerely, as he hugs each of them in turn.
“Let me explain,” Harry says, stepping in front of Ron and raising his hands placatingly until Ron lowers his wand, never taking his eyes off Malfoy.
“I hired it,” she says, as if that should have been completely obvious.
“Well, if you’re not going to leave, then I will.” Malfoy snaps, getting to his feet and sweeping past Harry and out the door before he can protest any further.
, Harry reasons. He’d been in Britain long enough, really. It was time to come home. Sure, it hadn’t been nearly as outdated and stifling and old-fashioned as he feared, but it wasn’t
“Affinal,” Bill corrects. “And there’s only one person I’d recommend.”
It doesn’t feel like much of a plan, but it’s what they have.
Luna is undeterred, crossing her legs underneath herself and smiling. “No, that wasn’t a problem.
Teddy comes barrelling down the stairs and gives Draco a hug, his hair automatically settling from a muddy red to the colour of Draco’s own. “You missed the best episode!” he complains dramatically. “Zuko confronted his father and
“Not in Intensive Care. Not unless you’re next of kin.”
Harry’s chest feels tight. He doesn’t even know where the words came from and now all he can think about is the busy little sandwich shop packed with the lunchtime rush and maybe-Tom looking at him like Harry was the one pulling the prank.
Harry feels his mouth opening and closing but no sounds come out. In the end he gives up and looks at Luna. “I’m here to visit Belle, Draco said I could.”
,” Ron sing-songs as he clomps noisily downstairs to the kitchen with the food. Harry goes upstairs to the library. Hermione won’t leave unless she’s actually dragged out, even for dinner.
So Malfoy and his father had been fighting about his inheritance? That sounded about right. It wasn’t as if Malfoy had ever worked an honest day in his life. Harry supposes he might need the extra Galleons to keep him in his expensive wardrobe and to help him pick up Zabini’s bar tabs.
“Good morning to you too,” Malfoy sighs, sounding exhausted. As if he’s too tired to even reform his patrician features into a sneer.
They wait while he looks for a seat.
“His what?” Ron chokes out.
“Ron’s on assignment, he’ll be away for another week or so. Rose is staying at the Burrow for a bit so I don’t have my hands too full looking after Hugo.”
“Yes. The first year or so was pretty dreadful. I couldn’t sleep; I suffered terrible anxiety attacks. She was a little old Austrian witch with a hunchback who stood for absolutely none of my nonsense.” Draco laughs a little at the memory. “Once my father was arrested we had to leave, so,” he shrugs.
He figures it must be. Hermione has set all sorts of mail-related wards on Grimmauld Place to redirect or destroy fan-mail, howlers, offers of marriage, suspicious packages. The fussy, expensive-looking invitations that the Malfoy owl brings once a month apparently don’t fit into any of those categories. Harry refuses to get a treat in the hopes of pissing it off so it never comes back.
Bill makes a strangled sort of sound. “That’s not the… Look, Harry, regardless of whether you
“Can’t,” he says, glancing at his watch. “School pickup.”
“Harry,” he corrects quietly.
. They seem smaller than he imagined, having loomed so large in his imagination for the last few weeks.
“But they are hunting a
When he gets home that night the house is still absolutely frigid, so he sends an owl to Kreacher asking him to clean the Floos on the weekend. Harry pours himself a generous finger of Firewhisky and opens the box of Christmas lights. Following the instructions on the spell card, he waves his wand tentatively and the string of tiny glass orbs sweeps smoothly out of the box and encircles the tree, gently weaving in and out of the branches and coming to rest.
“I signed my own death warrant when I left, Potter,” he’d said quietly when Harry released the
“Uh, hello.”
“Draco Malfoy.”
And instead, Draco thought he was only there for a shag.
“That’s because you think tradition is meaningless,” Parkinson retorts, though she’s scowling at Hermione as she says it. “And you’ll always be the poorer for it.”
Although he did end up
“Thank Rose for me,” Harry sighs, tossing the Skiving Snackbox back in Ron’s direction. “She should get useful sweets confiscated more often.”
Ron sits up a little straighter. “He’s right. George took great delight in only telling me about it after the War.”
Which is how Harry finds himself gathered with his friends and Draco’s around two small round tables, packets of crisps open between them, a bottle of champagne chilling in an icebucket, and Draco’s leg pressed against his own. He’s not sure he’s ever been happier.
Harry nods, turning out the light and softly shutting the door as they leave Teddy’s room. He pauses on the landing and gently catches Draco’s arm. “Is it too dangerous?”
“I have to go.” Hermione gets to her feet with a sigh. She glances at her watch. “Fuck practice turkeys. I’m buying everything from the Harrods Food Hall on Christmas Eve, Muggle crowds be damned. And I guarantee she doesn’t even notice. She’ll be too busy rearranging the way I’ve set the table.”
“We will keep in touch,” she promises.
“She’s young and healthy. That’s a good start. And Hermione got you both here very quickly.”
“Well, that’s weeks away. You’ll be finished by then, I’ll be back home. You can give him something from me.”
. If they know, then
Harry waves absently at her as he leaves. He doesn’t have any intention of
what it feels like, and he doesn’t know why.
“No, I’ve had this for ages,” she lies, and Harry figures two can play at that game. She frowns up at him. “Look, obviously it’s too awkward to confront Luna tonight, but tomorrow we really need to sit her down and sort this out.”
“Why, is it getting under your skin, Harry?” Draco chuckles, dropping the paper again. “You really don’t like being linked to me?”
Draco doesn’t think he has much hope of stopping the tears now. He swipes at his eyes again.
“There are steaks in the fridge,” Potter says, trying to regain his relaxed tone. “I thought we could barbecue them, the weather is so good.”
“I know, but if there’s a link, it’s relevant to our case. The information might be important, and even if it isn’t, it ought to be investigated properly.”
“How long has he been living here?”
Potter nods cautiously, as if he’s waiting for Draco to trip him up or mock him for his lack of understanding. As if Draco could be bothered, after all this time. After everything that’s happened.
Draco nods. “I would have murdered you that day, but I was too tired.”
Teddy nods rapidly, eyes still glued to the figure rocketing around above them. He holds his arms out from his sides, fidgeting impatiently while Draco casts the rubbery layers of protective magic over him. His hair turns bright white, like a marshmallow, as if to prove a point.
“No, no, that’s okay, on my way,” Harry interrupts quickly, stepping through before Molly can even finish the thought. The kitchen in the Burrow is warm and smells like baking. A wreath hangs on the back door, and little star-shaped lights twinkle in the windows. For one horrible moment, Harry feels guilty that they’re
“That’s enough now,” Draco calls to Teddy, who is flying a few feet away, attempting some reckless manoeuvre that looks like it mimics the rollercoasters he went on for his birthday. “We’ve got to go and get cleaned up before dinner.”
The press conference is splashy and well-attended, with an open bar and loud music reverberating off the walls, where silent videos of Quidditch players showing off impossible trick manoeuvres play on a loop. Harry helps himself to one of the event’s signature cocktails: some sort of frothy gold concoction with a tiny Quidditch figure firing little sparks from the stirrer. He stands against a wall trying to work out how to drink it without the sparks striking his lip, and eventually gives up, taking the stirrer out and sticking it in a nearby plant.
Draco nods. If there’s one thing Ron is capable of, it’s a truly idiotic overreaction.
“A wooden one, with little doors. There’s pictures behind each door, of the things you’re supposed to do. To celebrate Christmas, I guess. Baking, decorating the tree, that sort of thing.”
“Are these the same kids Luna had in the other week?”
“Your patient, Belle
“He needs to take on less fieldwork,” she shrugs. ”Particularly now, with Hugo. But he’s on track for promotion to Deputy Head this year, so it’s all a balancing act.”

Statute of Secrecy be damned.
Their friends have all tumbled away and the green flames are empty, leaving them alone. He reaches for the Floo powder and says his address.
“Sorry. There’s still plenty of seats, I can find you some down in the stands?”
“I...uh...I’d like to look at a file.”
Harry scowls across at him as he attends to Luna. Not with the affection of a lover, exactly. Although Harry’s not sure he’d recognise affection in Malfoy, even if he saw it. But he certainly makes an elaborate show of being protective of her. Always checking to make sure she’s comfortable, has a drink, loading a plate with food to hand to her.
Malfoy tilts his head and stares at Harry as if he’s grown an extra one. “I’m not helping you
Harry scoffs. He’s tired of this argument. Tonight isn’t the first time they’ve had it.
Harry approaches him tentatively, kneeling down in front of the stupid gilt chair and putting a tentative hand on Draco’s leg. Draco’s expression is so guarded it’s impossible to know what he’s thinking. Harry hates it. He wants to get back that open joy he’d seen on Draco’s face before he messed all this up.
Prompt Thirteen:
try,” he chokes out, feeling a sudden unexpected wave of anger crash over him.
“That he’d disinherit you?” Harry asks.
“I’m a very good doctor, Harry. But from what I understand, you wind up in hospital a lot.”
Her countenance swiftly changes from sarcastic to sympathetic and she puts her china cup down to take one of his hands in both of hers. “Draco, you’d never have killed him. I know that. Everyone who knows you, knows that.” She arches an eyebrow at Harry.
“Simple things didn’t seem to work very well,” Luna agrees. “None of us could cast a
CRACK, CRACK,
“It’s okay,” Harry cuts her off. “Or it will be. I think.”
Hermione looks around the gathered group again, hugging her book to her chest protectively. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen her look so cornered.
. You’re the one always telling us this whole stupid plan could be dangerous, and now you want to bring
to Luna.” Malfoy asks, coldly, his lip curled and his eyes fixed on Harry.
It was the right decision, leaving. Now he can focus on doing what he does best. Following his gut instinct. Helping people who need it. And there isn’t a single form that needs to be filled out at the end.
“Magical limits?” Harry asks.
“These are for the chapel,” Jack explains, as they walk past the stable to a part of the main house that seems almost like a ruin. “The wood was so damaged, I took them out and scarfed them.”
He always knew Draco was clever. But he hadn’t ever been confronted with the reality of it. The piles of research neatly stacked around his flat that could rival Hermione’s. The rows of neatly labelled notebooks representing years of work. His truly formidable accomplishments. It all conspired to make Harry feel unqualified. Inadequate. Draco needed to be with someone who had a giant brain like his own. No wonder he was happy to see Harry as nothing more than a shag.
He carefully studies the picture of the little ice skaters as if it were one of his crime scenes. A man and woman are on a frozen pond surrounded by tall trees, holding hands as they turn in a circle. Harry feels slightly annoyed that appeasing a calendar seems to mean he has to pretend to be straight, but he reckons he’s got this one beat.
Draco immediately gave the money to the Shout Out fund for the Pride float. He didn’t want to keep a single coin.
Harry briefly considers going to the pub where the team will be to at least buy them a round in congratulations. But his stomach is in knots and he’s so agitated he doesn’t think he’d be able to keep a polite smile on his face, so he goes home and drinks half a bottle of Firewhiskey, Casper purring contentedly on his lap. He keeps thinking about Draco, laughing delightedly as Harry had managed to turn sharply in front of him as they flew together the night before in the dusk. The joy he’d felt then feels like poison.
Hermione pats his hand. “It’s not a big deal, Harry. He wrote after he moved to Paris. Apologised and so on.”
Nigel and his partner, Thomas, had an apartment in a gorgeous brownstone on a street lined with trees, and their friends were magical and Muggle alike. The British obsession with the Statute of Secrecy had melted away in Manhattan. Wizards were careful, but they hadn’t taken themselves completely out of the world like some sort of misplaced aristocratic elite. It was exactly what Harry needed.

“It was a weekend. He seemed confused about who lives there.”
Quidditch coverage steps up a notch. On Monday, it’s

Among the many reasons Harry didn’t want to come to the game, seeing just how ridiculously good Puddlemere are was certainly among the top ten. Their opponents, the Magpies, are a class act, but Puddlemere is in a league of their own. Disciplined, unrelenting, and utterly unforgiving of any mistakes. It would be depressing, except that Harry’s quickly swept up in the energy of the crowd cheering for Montrose at home, their black flags and banners flapping like Dementors all around the stadium. While Draco takes copious notes, Harry finds himself just enjoying the feeling of being surrounded by thousands of excited fans, united in their love for their teams and their love for the game. Parkinson really has achieved something remarkable, he realises.
“Wait.” Granger’s voice cuts clearly through the chaos, with all the imposing power of an Auror giving a command.
“I can’t believe he’s actually
Harry doesn’t think it’s going to help much. Ron will presumably side with Hermione. He wonders how much of this Ron knows about. Did he willingly help her trick the rest of them into thinking this whole thing was legitimate, or has she been pulling the wool over his eyes as well?
“Okay, okay,” Scary Magda clears her throat, and everyone falls immediately silent. “Why did the mechanic sleep under his car?”

An earnest little boy about Teddy’s age is sitting opposite, trying to glue a pinecone on the end of his small log. Harry reaches out to hold the wood steady.
“You’re a sight for sore eyes,” she says as she hugs him. Her buzzed hair and piercings make her seem much tougher than she is. Elsa is a giant softie. “Was it as awful as you thought?”
“My dorms are along here,” Luna says when Harry comes out into the corridor to find them waiting for him. “We thought we’d set up in there.”
“I need to speak to your friend the squib chef,” Draco said to Blaise over drinks a few weeks later.

“We’re not starting over with some second-rate frog,” Weasley snorts, hitching the child on his hip. “I can’t stand you, but I can stand the thought of losing Harry even less, so get your shit together and let’s go.”
Draco’s mouth twists. “Although, if I wanted the Aurors off my back, getting the details of the murder I’d committed wrong while trying to confess would be a move worthy of Salazar himself.”
When Teddy’s raced off up the stairs, complaining loudly that his hands are clean and that washing them again is a waste of water and bad for the environment, Draco turns back to find Potter staring at him.
“Weasel…” Draco coughs and quickly corrects himself. “
“Draco, let me in.”
He repeats what Draco showed him, the diagnostic test results and the similarities with Belle’s condition.
“Have a good Christmas, Harry,” Draco says, offering one leather-clad hand to shake.
more hot.”
He puts his cup down again, balancing the file on one knee and taking a notebook and pen out of his coat pocket. Ignoring Potter entirely, he peppers Bill with questions.
“Mr Potter,” she says quietly, by way of greeting. “We’re very glad to have you here.”
“It’s okay,” Harry assures him. “It’s not like I have any leg to stand on, do I? I mean Draco and Parkinson are basically peas in a pod.”
. We opened the Advent calendar hours ago.”
“He figured it out?” Harry yelps. “That you were planning to —
the way his heart is pounding. He waits for Potter to say something, but he just sinks to the curb, running a tired hand through his hair as he reaches for last book that has tumbled out into the street.
“Come ice-skating with me,” he says as soon as Ginny answers her Floo. The good thing about Ginny is that she’s pretty much up for any physical activity at any time when she’s not training, and she doesn’t ask a lot of questions.
The group shares a sombre meal on a floor rug that Neville took out into the corridor and gave a bit of a beating to. Hermione shows the path that she’s marked out for the following day, which will take them up past the kitchens and into the Great Hall.
Potter’s face twists into something that might be on the way to a smile. “It’s fine, you two go ahead—”
“Your parents, Harry, and your father, Draco, would both have been very proud of you today as well,” Andromeda says, standing between them, an arm around each of their shoulders. “Together we’ve managed to raise a remarkable young man.”
The Mayor then makes a big flourish of introducing the tree-lighting celebrity.
Harry is undeterred. “You reworked Fiendfyre, one of the most terrifying spells I’ve ever seen. You knew
Ron gives a shrug. “It was still pretty dark. But the moving staircases shifted into position just fine. I walked right up here, no ghosts, no knives.”
“That seems sensible,” Harry nods encouragingly. “And when you were outside the door, could you hear what it was they were fighting about?”
And sure enough, the broom handle displays a final, purple rune that Maxwell’s broom does not.
There’s a long pause, like maybe Malfoy hasn’t heard him—or is pretending he hasn’t. Or maybe he’s drifted off to sleep.
“We’re not all bad,” Harry attempts as a joke, but Ginny just frowns.
Harry shudders at the thought.
“And congratulations to be offered on the personal front as well,” says Robards, giving Kingsley a horrifying wink. “If the number of questions Potter had for me this morning about the Force’s policy on interpersonal relationships is anything to go by.”
“Haven’t even had dessert yet, mate,” he chuckles, though even he clearly doesn’t find the situation funny.
She rubs the back of her neck. “This castle is my life’s work, Harry. Just as hunting Dark wizards is yours, and —”
“Oh, yes,” she says, straightening the cover on his bed, and tucking her quill into her hair, where it joins another knot of tinsel and something that might be a candy cane. “He’s been working in France, but Narcissa needs him home now. He’ll be here tomorrow.”
Harry’s delighted to find that the house is toasty warm, with decorations hanging from every portrait and curtain rod. He finds Kreacher in the kitchen to thank him for all his hard work, but the grumpy little elf just pulls a face at him and goes back to the hams he’s preparing.
the reason she’s here. So, if you’ll excuse me—”
He sighs. “I want to see Belle at the hospital but Malfoy won’t let me.”
“I’ll give a press conference, first thing,” Harry offers quickly. “Withdraw from the race, renounce everything I’ve said. Whatever you need.”
“You certainly seem to have darned yours,” Draco mutters beside him.
be in the future.”
“Impressive,” Draco says, watching the way Diggory’s arms flex to arrest the manoeuvre. “I’d have let him practise his broomwork with me any day.”
or no. He reaches out impulsively and grabs Malfoy’s sleeve.
Malfoy glances at the ceiling as if praying for strength. “Some of us have work to do, Potter.”
“What is this?” Malfoy calls out. “A lock of your own making?”
“She told me, ‘bout how your shields were the only thing that saved you all. Guess those Auror spells are good for some things after all.”
Narcissa opens her mouth as if to say something, but then chokes on a sob and flees the room.
Incredibly, Granger rolls her eyes.
“There’s one near the Burrow,” Ginny says, already wrapping a scarf around her neck. “Meet you there and we can ransack the back shed for skates.”
Harry digs around in the drawer of his desk and finds a bent paperclip he can transfigure into a hook. He casts to fasten it, and boosts Rose up a little, arms around her waist, so she can hang the wreath in pride of place. The green leaves look glossy and festive against the blue paint of the door. Harry supposes hardly anyone will see it, given his house isn’t visible to the neighbours and his friends all arrive by Floo, but he’ll know it’s there and it makes him unaccountably happy.
“I really want to kick this programme off at home, Harry. Set up a feeder school for Hogwarts,” Neville says, an earnest expression on his face. “You don’t need to move or anything. Just consult with me by fire-call to start. Maybe come over and stay in Hogsmeade a couple of days a month. Whatever time you can give us, really.”
hated me. His subconscious is always going to doubt what I’m telling him.”
a favour and wouldn’t each have sacrificed a limb to be there. “This evening, our chef is Jonathan Stone. He specialises in reinventions of classic British fare, proving there really is a rich culinary tradition right here at home. Tonight I’ve asked him to indulge me a little. The tasting menu is a reinterpretation of a meal that holds a very sentimental place in my heart, and I’m sure in some of yours: the welcome banquet from my boarding school.” A murmur of appreciation spreads around the room. Draco finds Potter looking at him, his eyes bright and expression curious.
The group has spread out further and far faster than Harry was expecting. He catches a glimpse of red hair at one point that might be Ron or Ginny, but they’re gone before he can really even change direction.
The pub is warm and busy, with groups of people clustered around tables and around the bar. The crowd is younger than Harry was expecting. Two boys who look like they’re still Hogwarts-age walk past him holding hands. The taller one is wearing a t-shirt that reads
“Oh my god.”
Potter seems surprised. He drops to sit on the grass beside Draco.
“What, we only do this when it suits you?” Malfoy is smirking now; taunting Harry is giving him energy. “You only want to fuck when
Harry pulls out a small Mokeskin bag from which he digs out a broken shard of glass. “It’s part of a pair. I broke mine, unfortunately, but it still works. You just say my name into yours, and we’ll be able to talk to each other.”
“Saturday night,” Cassie helps, and the elf nods.
Malfoy sighs and turns back to the room, leaning against the sill. He finally lets his arms fall to his sides, and Harry catches sight of the twisted and faded grey lines of his Mark. Harry’s mouth goes dry.
you. That’s the only thing I do know.” She wipes her eyes with her sleeve, her face red and embarrassed as if she wishes she’d said nothing.
Saturday morning Harry wakes to the sound of Kreacher clattering around in the attic and hopes that’s a positive sign about the Floos. He pulls on Muggle clothes, retrieves Hermione’s list, and heads straight to the closest Woolworths. The strings of lights on sale there might require electricity and not respond to spells, but they’re also not going to set fire to his tree and they cost less than ten pounds.
“What is it, Mum?” Rose asks, wriggling onto her mother’s lap and reaching for the little troll pin. “It’s so ugly.”
,” Hermione corrects, assuming her lecturing voice, all too familiar from their planning meetings over the last few weeks, “that there are wards that will allow us to use some spells and not others.”
The plum pudding is dry and uneven. Harry gets a clump of unmixed flour in one bite. The three of them stare at each other as they gamely try to chew and swallow. Hermione folds first, spitting her last mouthful out onto the plate with a sigh.
. Harry’s mouth drops open in horror. He had completely forgotten.
Harry’s aware of mobiles from films, but they’ve always seemed a bit inefficient compared to a Patronus.
liability along?!”
“I mean, he was obviously a dreadful man,” Zabini points out unnecessarily, tipping a slug of whisky into his coffee. “But I didn’t wish him
“I’m not sure it’s the goblins who have been keeping him occupied.” Blaise winks at him as he brings their drinks back from the bar. “Rumour has it you’ve been leaving the Wand every week with the Boy Wonder.”
Harry rubs at his wrist, still aching from the curse damage. They only have a couple of healers, and they’re so overworked he doesn’t like to ask. He tries to imagine going back to Grimmauld Place and leaving Draco here and … not returning. He swallows bile.
Harry does as she suggests, and takes a moment to send a Patronus to Padma letting her know that the Auror security team can return. Then he heads out into the lobby. The heels of his boots click loudly on the marble floor. Harry glances around until he sees Malfoy, sitting on a padded bench near the reception desk.
The guestlist is flawless, but Draco’s still acutely aware of the people who are missing, the ones he’s never brave enough to invite. He always invites Potter, of course. He’s the most important wizard in Britain, and he’s always,
Harry nods, still confused.
“Well, it’s a bit like Bertie’s Every Flavour Beans, isn’t it? You’re just as likely to get a nice piece of chocolate as you are to get double bed-pan duty for the month.”
, don’t you think I’d have doubled the size of the house by now?”
Granger nods, encouraging him to go on.
family.”
“A specialist….” Harry hopes she means someone at St Mungo’s, because Hannah works there and is always very nice to him.
“Okay, so we meet here Wednesday morning. You have your supply lists. Don’t overlook anything. If you can’t locate something on your list, owl me and let me know.”
about courage.”
Hermione is still disappointed with Draco for insisting on staying out on the grounds. “You’ve worked as hard as Neville on this,” she says with a frown. “You’re just as important a guest as any of us. You should be at the dinner tonight.”
,” Harry gasps in shock, the force of the thought almost knocking him backwards.
“It worked!” Harry claps Malfoy on the back, delighted, and then crouches down to run his hand over the dry, undamaged floorboards. Even Malfoy seems pleased, allowing himself just the smallest of smiles.
“So, what now? We can’t be everywhere at once — are we supposed to dash about in the hopes we see someone behaving suspiciously.”
But then a blink and all he could see was his psychotic aunt flinging books in the air and using them for target practice, Nagini curling her body through the rungs of the ladder.
“Ancient and noble, blah blah, yes,” Harry cuts him off before he can wind up into a pure-blood tirade. “So the house will be
Then she leans over and kisses Harry on his, giving him a wry smile. “Return her in one piece at lunchtime.”
Outside the window he can see Jack loading tools in his van. He always stays until last, even on a Friday.
“Master Harry’s bed is just upstairs,” she reproaches, twitching her duster at him as he stretches the kinks out of his spine. He tries not to make a habit of it. Sometimes, he just gets lost in his work.
“So when you said he was doing this because it would have a
Ron is laughing so hard tears are starting to run down his face.
“Just give me until Wednesday,” he pleads and hopes it sounds convincing. “I’ll have shaken this off cold by the party, and then we can concentrate on the final push.”
Draco can’t quite keep the look of disgust off his face as she drifts out of the room, and he’s surprised to hear a snort from Granger.
Kreacher seems to be rearranging every single item in the dark and dusty space, his ears flapping in frustration as he shoves a large box out of the way and leans so far into the next that he almost disappears inside. All the while he keeps up a steady stream of muttering: “Two weeks’ notice. Expects Kreacher to be ready in that time. House full of
Harry nods quickly. “This isn’t official. I’m not an Auror. I just want to understand what happened,” he trails off, trying to think of a reason that will be persuasive. “Luna is a very dear friend of mine,” he finally manages. “This is just terrible for her.”
“Look, your private life is your own.” Ron can’t exactly disguise the distasteful expression that has nothing to do with who Harry is and everything to do with his choice of partner. “But not when it’s smack bang in the middle of my murder investigation.”
“How many of us had the calamari?” Harry groans, a fresh wave of cramps gripping his stomach.
“It might be a bit confused,” Luna says. “It hasn’t been used in a long time. Why don’t I try?”
Harry’s grateful when Ron appears at his shoulder saying it’s time to take the kids home and saves him from Hermione's perceptive stare.
. Draco’s hoping to take the memories out, alright, but he’s not going to put them in a Pensieve. He’s going to use them to plug the holes in the magic of Lily Potter’s ring. The places where
“I think it’s broken, Rosie,” he says.
Draco sighs. “You’re right. I was a spoiled little shit when I was young. And the truth is, your more conservative approach worked well today in places. The way you managed to get Morgan and North to pick up the pace in the second half was really something.”
“It’s
Just the words alone have Harry letting out a small groan and adjusting himself in his jeans. Malfoy pulls back, grinning wickedly at him. This whole moment is absurd. Unthinkable. Harry can’t possibly go through with it. But Draco is the brightest spot in the room and he can’t look away.
better than your flat.”
So he goes to a fancy department store on Oxford Street and lets a bored-looking sales assistant choose him a new outfit. A dark well-fitted suit, rich emerald tie, and a crisp shirt with a collar that doesn’t feel starchy. He stares at himself in the mirror, shoving his spectacles back up his nose. He doesn’t recognise the man looking back at him. Dark shadows under his eyes, unshaven. A haunted, unhappy figure trussed up in expensive clothes.
Harry tenses. “Is that… did it
“A Curse Breaker, Harry,” Alicia punctures his hopes with a laugh. “I understand you probably work with a few.”
here?”
,” he mutters icily, buttoning his shirt cuffs. “Neville’s put a great deal of work into this.”
“Well, she was right,” Draco muses, which only makes Harry laugh harder.
“I’ll stay here,” Malfoy offers with a shrug, and Harry suddenly finds it hard to get a full breath into his chest.
By the following week, Harry’s arriving at work each morning with his headache already firmly installed. He sits astride his broom, watching Malfoy force the Beaters into ever-escalating patterns, slinging enchanted training Bludgers at them left and right at an outrageous pace.
“No, I’m serious, Potter. Teddy is an amazing, bright, capable child. But he’s had to deal with a hell of a lot in his short life. Losing both his parents before he remembers is an experience
“Why didn’t you bring Malfoy?” Ginny asks, as they head back out onto High Street.
He wants to ask her if Malfoy knows she’s doing this. But he suspects the answer is definitely not, or he’d be here protesting. There’s no way he’d readily accept Harry’s help in this, or anything else. Somehow that’s all the more reason to do it.
It’s been six months since his discharge, and there are still some days where his recovery seems slower than others. Luna visits them at the school regularly for his check-ups, and she assures Draco everything is going well. But he still worries.
he hurt. Someone who
“I’ll share with Draco,” Luna announces, holding back the flap of her tent and making eye contact only with Malfoy. He hesitates for a brief second, but his impassive expression doesn’t so much as flicker. He picks up his pack and heads inside.
, something, I forget the name. But it did the trick!”
“Doing
houses are here to heal.”
As Harry and Hermione round the corner, they hear raised voices from the room where Ron and his partner have set themselves up to interview everyone.
Potter shovels another mouthful of food in while he absorbs this information. Draco is staggered that he still eats like the starving orphan he literally was as a child. He hasn’t even completely swallowed when he starts talking again, which Draco is horrified to discover he finds repulsive and bizarrely attractive in equal measure. There’s something captivating about the passion with which Potter still throws himself at everything. Devouring the world around him.
His office is cramped and on the wrong side of the building, so it gets basically no natural light, but Harry’s always insisted he doesn’t care. The important thing is that they use all of the wizarding space they have available to them for the players’ facilities. He only needs enough room for a giant blackboard to draw diagrams on and a television to watch game videos. He’s grateful the wizarding world adopted so much Muggle technology after the war. The idea of having to spend half his work days with his head in a Pensieve, the way coaches used to, has always seemed unappealing.
The Arrows are limp and uninspired in the air. They’re all clearly unsteady and still suffering, easily beaten to the Quaffle over and over again. Morgan and North are doing the best they can, but the Bludgers get through repeatedly. And Iyer looks like she’s just clinging to her broom, doing the best she can to hang on. It’s devastating to watch. Harry feels like he needs to peer through his fingers as the Harpies score on them for the umpteenth time. Ginny swoops close to the stand as the teams reset, and gives Harry a very apologetic shrug.
. You said it yourself. It’s a set of rules I have to follow, so it doesn’t work if I’m not doing it properly. I need to ice-skate with a bloke.”
Rose is absolutely over the moon when Harry takes her out to the back garden and shows her the path he’s charmed through the grass to the stout little treehouse in the bowers of the old oak.
the whole thing, and I don’t want to. I don’t know why anyone would want to.”
Draco pulls a face before he can help it. “He got you a room at an
“At my place, too,” Draco says glumly, sinking into a soft armchair. Harry perches opposite him on the sofa looking agitated.
“It may not be the answer you want,” he says cautiously.
Harry’s mind goes blank.
Grimmauld Place had moved past drafty, through cold, into actually freezing. There was frost on the inside of the window panes and as Harry stepped into the front hall he realised to his horror that the wooden floorboards were covered in a thin sheet of ice. Conceding defeat, he Accioed an overnight bag and Apparated to the Red Lion.
Harry thinks about Belle, lying in that bed by herself.
“Clean up, the rest of you,” Malfoy finally mutters. “We’ll discuss it tomorrow.”
He orders them a bottle of Perrier-Jouët and Pansy’s favourite crab and rock-shrimp dumplings, while she launches into a bitchy and hilarious re-telling of some scandal that unfolded at Paris Fashion Week. Draco could care less about the people involved, but Pansy’s tales are always hilarious and just on the right side of mean-spirited.
“A cup of coffee isn’t going to get me to change my mind. One of your Weasleys is a Curse Breaker. Get him to help. Maybe you’ll take what he has to say seriously.”
Silence. Lovegood looks at them both and then quietly leaves the room.
“Malfoy was in my room from about two a.m., for an hour or so.”
“The answer is still
Harry finds a stash of candy and holds it up, desperate to change the subject.  “Do you think this is still edible?”
“You could get your own rug, you know. Nap on your own floor.” The sunlight is spilling in through the picture windows, and Harry closes his eyes, curling into the warmth like a cat.
The screen changes to video, a very clever spell that Harry thinks for a second he should get Parkinson to teach him for team briefings before he manages to shake himself out of it. She’s a predator. Who, it seems, is not only trying to ruin his life, but also the sport in general. He’s not going to ask her for magic tutorials.
Harry frowns, confused, concentrating on his wand tracing another complicated pattern in the air. “My list?”
“Come on,” Harry wheedles again, and in the near-darkness Harry’s hand reaches his hip, fingers tracing intriguing patterns on the skin above his pyjama waistband. “I can see a giant bed through there. Why don’t you fuck me through it?”
“The Manor. I have a couple of books I want to find.”
Ron screws up his face and thinks. “I’ll just send him a Patronus —”
Harry says, “
sparkles across the top of the box above an illustration of silver and gold baubles that appear to be singing to one another.
“But—”
Harry expected Malfoy out of uniform to wear poncy ornate robes like the kind his dreadful father used to flounce around in. It’s terrible to discover that instead Malfoy looks like a fashion model who has wandered off his billboard and gotten lost, winding up sitting straight-backed and serious beside his Aunt watching a primary school play. Harry’s so distracted by Malfoy’s soft dark scarf and thick green sweater that he misses whatever denouement the meandering advent tale has, and is forced to join everyone around him bursting into overenthusiastic applause. When he glances back from the stage, Malfoy has gone.
Draco feels the silver anchor around his wrist start to burn. His body must be starting to fail.
in me. I could never fight hard enough, run far enough, fly fast enough to leave him behind. I couldn’t catch you up, Harry. Believe me, I tried. I hoped it would stop dragging on me when he died, but it didn’t.
He pushes a trolley through the crowded aisles, filling it with boxes of lights and baubles, loops of tinsel and gold beads. Candles and napkin rings for the table. A berry and pinecone wreath for the front door. He’s pretty sure the Grimmauld Place crockery will work just fine and he doesn’t need something called a table runner, or lanterns shaped like Santa, or a festive incense. But he does throw in some cookie cutters in Christmas shapes, and a gingerbread house kit that promises to be “easy to assemble".
“No,” Hermione shakes her head quickly. “I don’t want to run the risk that we … alert the castle in some way before we’re ready.”
Harry nods, noticing the warm feeling he gets when Draco pairs them like this.
“I want him to
Harry agrees, washing his hands in the sink while Andromeda waves her wand at the kettle. Teddy is standing on a low stool to put him at the height of the kitchen bench, and already seems to have more flour on his hands and face than can conceivably be involved in biscuit dough.
“It’s
Harry’s ears are ringing. He feels a headache coming on. “You and Kingsley Shacklebolt were sitting around swilling champagne with
“I finished the book I was reading Belle,” he hurries on, by way of explanation. “I wanted to get another one.”
That should be the end of it. Hermione’s been like a drill sergeant with them all about preparation. They’ve practised over and over, for weeks. There’s no way she can realistically suggest they substitute
“I wish you’d called,” she says, and from anyone else it would sound like an apology for the state of the cosy little house, with buckets of baby clothes washing themselves on the kitchen bench and piles of tedious-looking books stacked all over the dining table.
Fleamont doesn’t so much as flinch. He tilts his head to one side, looking Harry up and down. “Obviously I’ve seen it more recently than you.” And then he calmly walks out of the frame.
“Not so fast,” he hears behind him, in a voice that chills him to his core.
“Merlin, Hannah, of course, I’m sorry.”
Prompt Fifteen:
Harry stumbles to a confused halt. He was pretty sure that when he left yesterday Draco wasn’t mad with him. Tired. Resigned, maybe. But not angry.
“Wait, what?!” Ron splutters at the same time. “We’re attacking one another?”
Luna is on her knees, having dropped her torch on the ground. Beyond her, roped to the wall, is a battered and bloody Dean Thomas and a barely conscious Griphook.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, squeezing his knee.
“Not on purpose,” Harry sighs. “It was a misunderstanding. Anyway, the point is—”
Harry’s just turning off Upper Street when he sees him, stopped in the middle of the footpath, looking up at a sign. Malfoy’s tall: long limbs; blond hair falling in his eyes as he glances back down at a piece of paper clutched in his hand. He takes up space, indifferent to the way the sea of early-morning commuters is having to part around him. Arrogant as always. It flares rage at the edges of Harry’s frayed nerves and all of a sudden he’s pushing past people to get to him, grabbing at Malfoy’s shoulder before he can think about what he’s doing and shoving him up against the brick wall of a fish restaurant.
She seems distracted. “Hmm? Oh, no, it was fine. Good to stretch my legs, I guess.”
“The kids say you’re banging the
“Fine. When can we move him?”
“What’ll it be?” The witch behind the counter interrupts his train of thought, and he orders quickly so he can leave before Malfoy sees him. Not for any particular reason. Just that then they’d probably have to make awkward small talk and Harry can’t think of a single thing he’d want to say to Draco Malfoy that isn’t, “I guess I’m glad you were too young to face trial.”
Draco thinks about Luna Lovegood, sitting hunched in the dark of the Manor’s cells. He rubs tiredly at his eyes. The last of the light is fading and he feels heavy, like there are weights around his ankles and across his shoulders pulling him down.
“So, these doors that are lit up. These are things that you’ve done?”
“Harry, did you come into the office while suspended—again—for the express purpose of letting me tell you off?”
“Hello Harry. Draco’s not on duty today.”
No one says anything. In the extended silence, Harry is painfully aware of Draco. His shoulders are tense and raised, he’s coiled, upset — furious. And Harry knows this is about him; it’s about
“Well,
Malfoy doesn’t
? Since I left?”
“Know what?” Malfoy asks, sounding tired and exasperated. “What the fuck is going on?” He shrugs off his jacket and tosses it on the chair, leaving him wearing only the damp white undershirt. Harry stares at the faded lines of his Dark Mark, inked in all around with other tattoos. Geometric designs. Flowers. Magical creatures. Like it’s possible to surround such evil with other things and suddenly no one will notice it’s there.
Lunch is a roaring success. Hermione’s dining room is a triumph, and there’s absolutely no sign of any of the Harrod’s packaging. Just a table laden with a giant golden turkey and all the trimmings.
Draco replies coolly, “And no one seems to have a better idea. The magic will work.”
He doesn’t express it as a question. Malfoy will only read doubt into that. He blinks up at Harry in surprise, whatever cutting remark he’d planned clearly discarded. But almost as quickly his expression shutters, becoming carefully blank.
Room 43 is at the end of a corridor and the room itself feels like a tiny oasis compared to the noise and bustle of the hospital outside. A large charmed picture window shows a snowy garden with an iced-over fountain at its centre.
On Monday, Bill owls Harry to say he’s making good progress and that it will be another day or two at most before he’s finished with the vault.
Harry experiences a strong surge of adrenaline. There’s an answer here to a question he can’t quite force into shape.
On Tuesday, it feels like absolutely nothing goes right.
He figures it’s probably good to draw some boundaries, though. He can’t be available literally every time Harry suggests a shag. Even if all he wants, after the week he’s had, is the palm of Harry’s hand against his back, pressing him down. Draco’s feeling pretty pleased with himself and his own personal restraint when someone drags the chair out next to him and sits down.
“We have to take him back to the hospital.” Weasley gets to his feet and starts pacing. “We tried this, Hermione. But it hasn’t worked.”
“It’s a horrible feeling,” Malfoy says, pushing back his empty plate. “Knowing that we somehow met and got to know each other and…” He trails off, leaving the end of the sentence heavy with suggestion. “And now I have no idea what that was like.”
“What the hell, Nev?”
Draco inhales deeply and nods.
Harry looks over at him and sees just a hint of humour mingling with the sadness in his silver-grey eyes, and thinks that it looks like something new between them. Something that might even be trust.
And the gall of Draco fucking Malfoy hosting a
“You’re back early,” she frowns, looking up at the clock. He’s not, which she must realise as she takes in the time. “I should just —”
And so they fall into single file again, making their way through the scrubby undergrowth and down towards the lake.
Obviously, the wedding can’t go ahead, but Harry’s forced to admit to himself that if it did, Malfoy would play the part of the doting husband to a tee. It unsettles him, watching this performance. He’s used to his own far more antagonistic interactions with Malfoy — at least those feel genuine.
“I didn’t agree with you, Harry,” she shrugs.
Harry has a sudden and very vivid memory of the Lestrange vault and the endlessly multiplying, searing hot metal. He sucks in a short breath. Malfoy gives him a curious look, but Harry can’t bring himself to explain.
Ron frowns. “Harry, you know protocol dictates that—”
“You sure you don’t want it delivered, mate?”
“Are you going to go,” she asks, looking up at him as they wait their turn in front of the hearths. And that’s the troll in the dungeon, really, isn’t it? Even if Luna is safe and well and just throwing a cocktail party, she’s picked a location that absolutely none of them will be falling over themselves to revisit. And it puts him in a completely impossible position.
“I knew you were stupid, Potter, but I really didn’t take you for a complete fucking idiot.”
“What about Neville,” Luna suggests. “He just got back from Australia, he might know something?”
“Yeah. It’s real.” And then, feeling a blush slowly colour his face, “Will you patch things up with Pansy?”
Harrison helped with the connections after that first dinner, introducing Draco to all the right people as the representative of some individuals who closely guarded their privacy. Most of the chefs and sommeliers seemed unfazed, used to being hired by celebrities or Middle Eastern royalty whenever the price was right. And with the current galleon-to-pound exchange rate, the price was definitely right.
Draco nods. He’s dealt with the goblins often enough to know how those conversations have probably gone. He finds he’s relieved that the awkwardness didn’t have more to do with
Hermione had become one of the most successful policy makers in the Ministry of Magic, swooping from department to department and rousting out underperformers. She was responsible for a truly impressive slate of post-War legislation, enshrining a raft of creature rights, reforming Azkaban, and adjusting the inner workings of the Wizengamot. She had a fearsome reputation, but no one could question her achievements.
“And I find myself saying things that I don’t actually believe. I keep telling people that I think it’s best I move back to Europe. I’m half-way through a sodding university degree, for Salazar’s sake! Why would I want to go back to France?”
“Draco.” Harry’s tone is so low that he leans in to be heard. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know why I didn't stop to talk to you, that first night. I should have, but you’re right, I didn’t think. Maybe if I had, I would have realised some… things. About you. And also about me. What I was really doing — and how it really felt, being with you.”
The day they finally complete the incantations, Minerva gathers all the staff for a celebration dinner and opens some very good wine. Draco's not even sure the country it's from still technically exists. A huge new leatherbound book rests on a side table, quill hovering over the slowly turning pages inscribing the names of all the children of magic in Britain. Draco feels so proud and delighted that it’s only hours and several wines later that he thinks to ask Neville where Harry is. Neville pats him on the arm in an oddly misplaced gesture of comfort and says that Harry’s packing up his flat in Brooklyn. Draco swallows hard against the finality of that idea and immediately changes the subject.
carry out the ritual if our magic doesn’t work.”
the one who’s overreacted, and he’ll be damned if he’s saying sorry.
“Why are you starting with Bulstrode?” Harry asks, after Ron has dispatched an elf to collect her.
“It will be okay if we win,” Draco corrects, taking their empty bowls and casting to send them back to the kitchen. Casper curls up on his lap and he scratches behind her ears absently.
“There has to be more to it than that. I wore the stupid festive sweaters and the door barely glowed. Yesterday, I made a snowman, wrapped presents,
“Malfoy!” Harry launches himself forward, trusting the strength of his shield to rebuff the flying wall of destruction. He tackles Malfoy bodily, flinging them both to the floor, and hears the ringing clatter of the chandelier striking the ground behind him. Wreckage rains down around them and then — silence.

Harry stares at him. He’s tall and thin. Too thin. His face is gaunt and tired looking. His bright blond hair is chopped short, in a haphazard sort of way that might be stylish, but Harry wouldn’t really have a clue. He’s wearing plain, dark Muggle clothes that make him look even paler than Harry remembers.
“I don’t know for sure that anything bad will happen,” she starts weakly.
Harry nods, and Rose promptly descends and begins to drag her little temporary step ladder across to the other wall, making a dreadful noise on the floorboards that Harry is sure will send Kreacher into conniptions. He twitches his wand to speed things up.
“Luna, this
“What are our other options, Harry?” Luna asks, her arm around Hannah who still looks devastated.
showering in his bathroom or sliding between his sheets.
It’s infuriating.
And that was when Neville Longbottom got in touch.
Draco displays his arm without shame, and Harry’s fingers twitch because he wants to touch that damaged skin and
” From Pansy Parkinson, it seemed like a moving farewell.
The question sounds innocent enough, but Pansy never really
“Neither,” Harry says, getting into bed. “Goldstein was just far hotter.”
“I just don’t want it to be like
“Still mad, huh?” Harry says, and steps even further into his personal space. “Come on, you know you’ve always wanted to fuck me at Hogwarts.”
Harry had been planning to just hold his breath, but he’s forced to admit this idea is more practical and ties the scarf around his face, hating the scratchy feel of the musty wool against his skin.
“Do you want coffee or something?” Granger asks, clearly awkward with the idea of him being here. “Water?”
“Anyway, I don’t think she’s really even that aware that it’s Christmas, so I imagine Draco just hasn’t bothered with the decorations and so on. He works very long hours at the hospital, there wouldn’t be much point.”
“Ron, I —”
The sea air feels amazing, and Draco takes several deep breaths, even as he knows it isn’t real. A gull arcs overhead as he walks up the path to the door of the cottage and knocks. He takes a stumbling step backwards when one of his father’s former house-elves answers the door.
Hermione’s jaw tightens. “You’ve been gone a long time, Harry. Draco has done more than enough to not only make amends, but also to establish himself as one of my dearest friends.”
Draco greets his guests at the wide double doors to the Barn, thanking them for coming and directing them to help themselves to glasses of chilled champagne waiting just inside on an oak bar, decorated with jars of fireflies and twisted bowers of greenery.
“Improving, thank you.”
Malfoy eyes the picture behind the seventeenth door carefully, and then looks at Harry’s little stack of gifts, which, admittedly, look a little lumpier than he remembered from yesterday.
Padma is out for the morning chasing down a lead in Shropshire, and when she returns she looks exasperated. “What are you wearing?!”
“Bags-not being that,” Ron snorts, as a long-empty kettle whistles unhappily on a hob.
He’s walking through the concourse to the pitch and finds old Jim Cranswick talking animatedly to Draco, who, incredibly, has a broad smile on his face.
“I’m going to the Langley,” he says to Padma, grabbing his coat from the rack behind the door.
Teddy and Rose take off outside to explore the half-size Quidditch pitch and an animal area where there are some chickens and piglets for the children to help look after. Draco keeps an eye on them from the driveway.
“I know, I know. I give you a hard time about it and it’s not fair.”
“Flourish & Blotts to begin with; possibly the Ministry library. There’s a book I might need from Hogwarts.”
this spell you’ve found,” Neville asks, “how do we break it?”
Harry will be damned if he’ll practise a basic spell in front of this lot, so he just nods at her and leaves his wand holstered where it is.
They close the door carefully behind them. It sags a little on its hinges. Harry doesn’t look back.
“It was,” Draco bites at his lip, trying to decide how much of this to explain. “When I was a child, whole ballrooms would open up for the entertaining season and be gone again when the hunting lodge sprung up in August.”
“Poor Draco,” Pansy says, looking pale and already wearing black. Harry realises with a start that all of Malfoy’s friends are, as if there was some memo he’s missed about coming down to breakfast in mourning dress. There’s a part of him that will always feel like he’s half a step behind when it comes to wizarding traditions. Always a little out of place.
A whiteboard on one wall is absolutely covered with Granger’s cramped script. Lists of potions. Lists of spells. Lists of symptoms. Lists of names.
The ghosts turn their attention away from Harry abruptly, and he thinks they’re about to leave through the walls, but then he realises that they’ve regrouped to circle the heavy chandelier like a whirling dervish above the teacher’s desk where Malfoy is sheltering Neville and Hermione.
Potter turns around suddenly, as if he’s felt Draco’s stare. His relaxed smile turns positively wicked when he catches sight of Draco. Harry Potter always stampeded through Draco’s life like a wild animal. Why should now be any different? Draco joins him at the bar.
“You’ll pass easily,” he assures him.
“Was he there?” Ron asks, his voice no louder than a whisper.
now,” Blaise arched a sarcastic eyebrow. “You’re back on this idea about the dinners?”
“Mr Harry Potter sir,” the elf says, blinking wide eyes up at him.
She Apparated away before he had a chance to explain.
Draco laughs. “Come on then, are we going up to show him how we Blacks do things?” The family name is one they use with each other sometimes at home. Teddy had been so delighted when the Grimmauld house magic repaired the embroidery on the family tapestry, and both of their names appeared, stitched together in gold.
“Nah,” Ron shrugs, “We’d rather hang out with you, even if it means sitting with the Ferret as well. Right kids?” He jiggles Hugo on his hip and gives Rose’s hand a squeeze.
Two days before the dinner the owl is back, bearing instructions. Apparation coordinates for the edge of the property. An explanation of the secure wand storage cabinet guests will find there. A reminder that the waiting staff are Muggle, and that conversation topics should be considered with this in mind. And at the bottom,
The bartender nods. “Hogwarts lets them Floo down for the evening. It’s an approved extracurricular. Draco over there takes responsibility for getting them back afterwards.”
For the pair, the chance to spend time at this elegant historical property is a chance to step out of a world in which they are instantly recognisable. It’s a place of stunning beauty, and for the owners, it is comfortingly remote. “The privacy is nice,” Mr Malfoy agrees. “We get enough attention when we’re in the city.” Mr Malfoy keeps a stable of horses, and Mr Potter has turned one of the medieval barns into an enviable woodworking studio. The pair have certainly earned their peace and quiet. The Rotherhithe Trust made grants last year totalling more than fifty million galleons, and now employs a full-time staff of six.
“How’s your mother?”
Eventually, it’s as if his act of pretending he’s unaffected starts to succeed. His friends don’t seem to dance around the topic any more, and in many ways that’s so much worse. Dinner at Ron and Hermione’s inevitably results in him accidentally complimenting some dish that Harry had given them the recipe for. Teddy’s quick to show off a new feint that Harry taught him. When Harry finally does grace Hogwarts with his presence for dinner—on a Monday, when Draco is in London, naturally—even the sodding portraits want to tell Draco how lovely it was to see him. Harry looms even larger in his absence than he had done when he was part of Draco’s life. Draco has to work so hard to keep his fake smile plastered on that his face begins to ache.
Draco gives a disbelieving sort of hum, but his hands slide to Harry’s hips and Harry forgets what they were talking about for a bit.
not expecting him to laugh.
“Fuck,” Neville mutters under his breath as they sink back against the wall. “Harry, you better teach the rest of us that shield or we’re not going to make it through their next run.”
“About that night at the Wand,” Harry starts.

the press. He hasn’t spoken to a reporter since the War, despite the very best efforts of every single media outlet.
. Harry doesn’t really care how hard it’s been for Slytherins in the years after the War. Theo has a good job and he’s obviously trusted enough to be involved in all of this, so his life can’t be that bad. Harry just finds it a bit insulting. Theo’s been coming here to his home for over six weeks now and he still manages to look as though Harry might curse him through the floorboards at any moment.
Malfoy gives him another bored shrug. “Suit yourself.”
He bites his lip. “I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.”
Draco leans in and kisses him briefly on the forehead, squeezing his arms gently before breaking away and leaving the room.
Hermione pulls her wand from where she’d holstered it on her arm and casts a
“Only I seem to remember them going to the Yule Ball together.”
It takes Harry a lot longer than it should to get to sleep, listening to the even sound of Draco’s breathing in a bed a few feet away.
“House lights,” he says, pointing at the sixteenth door and desperate to think about something else. “Only I don’t have any, or a ladder.”
“He’s in his office,” Luna says, without looking up. And Harry’s about to object, because he could have been going to finish that sentence any number of ways, but she’s moved on, drifting off down the hall like a sentient spruce.
Second, Harry’s finally beginning to understand that maybe it wasn’t the same for Draco. That for him it was — maybe not something more — but maybe the
“I’m not breaking in, it’s your car.” Malfoy says reaching over to flip open the glove compartment. He pulls out the contents and lays the things out on the bonnet for them both to look at.
But one night his then-boyfriend Luca — an advocat with a crooked smile and an encyclopedic knowledge of wine — lay tossing and turning next to him in his sleep, and before Draco fully understood what was happening, he found himself standing next to him as Luca trembled in the face of a particularly cartoonish oversized rat in a dream version of his bathroom.
“Right,” Malfoy says, sliding to a stop beside Harry and showering him with an obnoxious spray of ice. "Before you hurt yourself, what do we need to do?"
“I need to show these to the Aurors. Find out what magic was used to make them.”
The parchment trembles a little in Harry’s hand. He takes another gulp of wine.
Hermione’s expression seems far away as well. Maybe they’ve both had too much wine. “Oh you know. It must have been last month some time. I bet it’s his.”
“You have to help me clear her,” Malfoy insists, leaning forward, elbows on his knees, looking at Harry with a pleading expression.
If Malfoy had wanted Harry as an alibi he’d have been singing it from the rooftops as soon as he was questioned. That he’d kept silent makes something twist uncomfortably in Harry’s chest.

” he sobs. She lies unmoving, all the potential in the room flying into her as anchor.
“Magic is absolutely wasted on you, isn’t it?” he sighs, waving his wand at the calendar and popping open doors thirteen, fourteen and fifteen in one obnoxious flourish.
He draws back briefly to catch his breath, but Malfoy is on him, impatient, his hands slipping inside the waistband of Harry’s boxers. Harry lets out a small groan and decides he can’t really be bothered arguing any further.
“What are you talking about?” Harry interjects, confused.
“I’ll arrange to have him taken home this evening. Luna is the Healer looking after his day-to-day care. You can join us there tomorrow. Number twelve.”
“I’m just stretching out a little before my Portkey home,” she calls. “Fly with me.”
Hermione glances at her watch, as if to say that mid-afternoon is a little early without saying anything at all.
“Had to be forced to take the Dark Lord’s mark, instead of recognising the absolute

Draco’s not sure what possesses him the following week, but Harry’s just finished stacking a whole pile of lumber offcuts at the back of the barn that they’ll use for firewood, and it’s not like he’s
. He supposes that’s something to be grateful for. Though the idea of Malfoy having school-aged children of his own is a lot for Harry to process.
“There, Mr Harry Potter, sir,” Banny says, and before Harry can ask anything further, he has scuttled away, back toward the house.
Luna strings her magical Christmas lights up around them. Hermione tries and fails to dry a patch of stone and so Neville unshrinks a large square of plastic tarpaulin. Harry sits gratefully, tugging off his wetsuit and drying himself with a towel from his pack. Warm clothes help a little, but still no one seems to know what to say.
“I got suspended,” he admits with sigh.
Harry doesn’t think there’s much use in pointing out he’s
Leila shakes her head. “I am overdue back in Prague, but I want to see them play. Would you like to fly a little?”

“December
Now, Draco lives in a fourth floor flat in Vertic Alley. A new building, completed after the War as the more traditional Diagon was being restored and wizarding interest in Muggle ways of life was at its peak, with stainless steel appliances spelled to never show thumbprints and high charmed skylights even though his flat isn’t on the top floor. It’s not particularly spacious, but it doesn’t really matter. When Draco starts to feel claustrophobic he heads to the Farm.
“From the Appleby club. I’ve been working on it for most of the season. The Puddlemere offer was a terrible shock because it accelerated the whole timeline, but at least it also put a number on the table.”
“Well that’s a fucking horrible sensation,” Ron complains, spitting out a piece of lake weed he’d almost managed to swallow. “Let’s not do that again.”
“Draco, while you were starting these dinners—bringing these amazing groups together, and showing them how extraordinary Muggle culture can be, and connecting these influential people in service of doing real good in our world—I was doing

. And I let them into our

been doing the same thing.”
Draco glances around the sitting room. “I’m just lucky Viktor’s in Argentina and was happy for me to stay for a while.”
The Arrows look shaken and seem to be steeling themselves for a lecture, but Malfoy just casts a spell to project the recording from his Omnioculars into the air. It’s Leila who addresses the team.
“That should do it,” Malfoy announces, a little too loudly for the serene surroundings, dropping Harry’s grip quickly and skating backwards a few feet. Harry feels like his breathing is suddenly too loud and he doesn’t know what to do with his hands.
“It pulses, but I’d say a similar teal to what you see under diagnosis with consanguinal curses.”
,” Harry mumbles, thinking about the tendency Draco’s fair hair has to fall across his face when he’s concentrating in a way that subsequently makes Harry’s own concentration impossible. Nev raves on and on about the spells Draco’s taught him, oblivious to Harry’s discomfort.
Draco seems as startled as anyone. He looks around at them, unsure. “Shall we...”
They squeeze into the red telephone box outside the Ministry together, and Harry dials the number.
The boy in question comes out with his class to sing Away in a Manger. He’s dressed as a shepherd, with one of Andromeda’s best tea towels on his head, and a big fuzzy fake beard.
The next day he goes back to the Farm, and as ever when he lands and takes in a deep lungful of air he feels all the tension inside him starting to uncoil. He walks up the path, startling a squirrel that shoots up a tree beside him, and he finds himself smiling. He’s surprised to find the house is a hive of activity, catering vans crammed into the turning circle and staff carrying racks of wine glasses to the barn. It’s been a month, he realises with a start. Draco must be about to host another dinner.
on as a coach.”
“You’re a sodding cheat,” he seethes.
Harry gathers his scarf and his jacket and is about to step through the Floo when there’s a sudden angry flapping noise at the front door. Grimmauld Place is warded against unwanted mail—a hangover from the days when Harry’s admirers were a little too ardent—so he draws his wand carefully as he eyes the way the mail slot is starting to bulge and rattle. The noise starts to increase, and the tiny screws holding the metal surround of the mail slot pop free, as the flap folds back in on itself and an absolute torrent of envelopes and small packages begin to pour through the door.
Harry hangs back a bit while planning his attack. He recognises Magda, who’s sitting behind a towering pile of patient files, but she stands for even less of his nonsense than Hermione and will probably just turn his clothes back into pajamas right here in front of everyone for the fun of it.
Harry’s eyes are filling up with tears now, and Draco suspects his own are as well.
“I need to talk to you …”
“Harry was always a very good teacher,” Lovegood says, scratching more notes in her chart.  Draco chances another look at him. Potter’s skin seems even more pale, tending toward a sickly sort of grey.
When he returns to the sitting room he’s trying to work out how to explain Ron and Hermione’s imminent arrival, but he finds Malfoy pacing back and forth in front of the windows.

The ceremony itself is spare. Less grief-laden than those held in the early years. No one wails any more, though a few quiet tears still escape.
“What even is this?” Elsa asks, rummaging in his grocery bags as he tries to unpack around her.
They perch at a stools in the window, half-watching the witches and wizards hurrying past in the cold outside, chatting about the kids and the plans for Christmas.
He thinks back to the very first time he did this. Still mourning his mother, he sat listlessly at her desk, turning the pages of her diary. Hoping for some sort of insight, some way to understand why she’d left him after everything they’d been through. But her handwriting seemed stilted and foreign to him, the notes of a stranger. He flipped ahead through the blank pages until an entry caught his eye.
Once inside, Malfoy’s all business, pointing his wand at the floorboards and the walls, casting rapidly.  Harry sinks to sit on the stairs and watch him. It’s not as if he can help, exactly, and it’s pretty overwhelming to have the golden flair of Malfoy’s magic up close and personal in his home. Malfoy, naturally, does not explain what he’s doing at all.
And if Draco finds himself spending more time at the Farm, that’s got everything to do with the decisions that need making about the rooms in the East Wing, and the plans for the next dinner, and nothing whatsoever to do with the unseasonal heat wave that means Potter is occasionally shirtless. And he tells Blaise so over martinis when Blaise suggests otherwise.
Her mouth presses into a thin line, but she nods.
“Hello, Harry dear, how are you? Oh, doesn’t the tree look marvellous!”
“Fire and plants don’t really mix,” Neville explains. “Well, other than Fire Seed, obviously, and there’s a reason we keep them in a cave.”
“Doesn’t last long,” Zabini notes, adding ruefully, “but it’s absolutely impossible to disguise. Believe me, I’ve tried.”
“Explain.”
It’s not entirely the team’s fault. They’re young, is all. Last season, the Arrows had several key retirements, and the fresh faces need time to learn how to play together properly. The sad reality is, it wouldn’t really matter if the team

“Nothing,” he chuckles, eating his own off the end of his stick. “It’s just you cast the most precise magic I’ve ever seen, but you haven’t the patience to wait an extra couple of minutes not to burn a marshmallow.”
“For your tree!” she exclaims. Harry thanks her profusely, thinking sadly that Kreacher will never allow it to see the light of day.
Harry makes his way through the gathering crowds in Diagon Alley to ‘Wheezes. The store is jammed with pre-Christmas shoppers elbowing each other out of the way to get to the newly released gingerbread houses that assemble themselves. Little gingerbread men trot back and forth on a display shelf, lifting iced beams and walls into place, indifferent to the
coffee.
“But —”
Ron and Cassie join them all in the drawing room after a few minutes and make the very unwelcome announcement that they’d like everyone to remain at the Manor for another night.
“You disagree?” Harry asks.
, Harry. Were you
Draco’s heart rabbits in his ribcage. He hadn’t expected the conversation to go like this at all, and he has no idea how to respond.
“I’m going to look around,” Harry decides, pulling his scarf up over his nose. “We need to work out where that came from.”
Harry tugs at his lower lip with his teeth. He wants to, of course, but his relationship with Ron feels mangled in a way that doesn’t feel as straightforward to fix. “Yeah, of course.” He’ll cross that bridge when he comes to it.
to realise what sort of danger he was putting himself in?”
Her mouth is a thin, disapproving line. She doesn’t look remotely convinced.
, calm down,” hisses a blurry figure, his palms raised in surrender.
Today, as they talk, it starts to feel natural again. Like there’s space to tease one another a little. Room to be a little more honest with each other.
Harry puts the page down. As awkward as it is, this seems like as good a time as any.
Harry knows just enough Muggle music to know that’s a band, but finds himself shocked that Malfoy, of all people, would be able to identify it.
“I don’t know,” Harry replies honestly. “I suppose it’s possible.”
to happen from the very beginning. If he stops the ritual incantation, he can help Draco. He can —
“Well, at least whoever’s pranking you has a heart, I guess,” Ron says.
Harry closes his eyes so he doesn’t have to think about whether the scratchy feeling behind his eyelids might be tears.
, we literally just cast Luna’s diagnostic trace. Every person who fell victim to the last spell will show the copper rune. And every person who doesn’t…”
It’s much worse, the second time. The ghosts are louder, screaming bloody murder, and they seem to be kicking up even more destruction around them. Harry squeezes his eyes tightly shut, unable or unwilling to look as he feels the strong wind buffet at his shield and all manner of rubbish fling itself at them with deadly force. The attack feels more violent and it’s harder to hold the shield this time. The minutes stretch by agonisingly until finally the last of the rubble drops around them and the ghosts are gone.
Malfoy ignores him, sticking a hand out for a surprised Ron to shake.
His tent is packed neatly in a canvas backpack, his clothes and toiletries in his dragonhide overnight bag. Harry, as ever, is being petulant about the whole thing.
The atmosphere is, unbelievably, even more tense than when he’d left.
Malfoy seems just as keen to brush off the attention. “Quickly, before they come back. The spell.”
Granger seems to be looking around the room as if she’s seeing it for the first time.
Draco looks down. He’s wearing a suit, but this version of himself is younger than he really is. Maybe five years or so.
He passes the changing rooms and Luna’s little infirmary, then rounds the corner past Neville’s broom workshop and the training gym. Finally, at the very end of the corridor is the door to his own office, paint peeling and its little plaque listing to one side.
Malfoy runs a hand through his hair in frustration as the Wasps score again. “I don’t think it’s the music that’s the problem.”
“I’ve been thinking about that little copper rune that was showing up in our trace diagnostics. At first I just assumed it was something standard that I’d overlooked but I’m very good at diagnostics so that didn’t really make sense.” Luna says this without a hint of bravado. She toys with her earring.
Draco looks like he’s about to start in on a tedious explanation for why ancient festival magic doesn’t involve backsliding, so Harry Apparates them both before he can.
He thinks about going to the shop, he honestly does. But he then he decides it can’t hurt to try once more and Floos to the hospital instead.
Draco pinches the skin on the inside of his wrist to force himself to focus.
“Oh, come on,” Harry snaps, surprising both himself and Hermione with the strength of his reaction. “We don’t know anything yet!” he tries to explain. “His father could have had a bloody stroke for all we know. I just don’t think we should jump to conclusions any more than Ron seems to be.”
“I can understand you not wanting to tell Ron, but did you really think I would be awful about it?”
He stretches—his toes skating down Draco’s calves—not wanting to disturb him but also very much wanting to wake him up immediately so they can carry on from last night.
“It’s not a curse,” he and Hermione find themselves saying in unison. Harry laughs. “But I hope these biscuits will make the calendar happier, yes.”
She lets out a sob, sinking to her knees. “Oh, Harry, it’s an
Malfoy runs a hand through that bright blond hair, and looks tired. More uncertain than Harry’s seen him.
not going, are you?” Hermione, like a Crup with a bone, confronts him as soon as sits down again.
“Did he come to you so that you’d provide him with an alibi later?”
“Is this about the team?” Draco asks, his jaw clenched and his tone defiant, his eyes fixed on Harry’s hand on his knee. “Do you want me to come back so they’ll win?”
When they get back, the little fans are still running and the air smells clear, but Malfoy immediately moves around the room casting his sealing spells at the heating vents.
Harry’s not sure he can blame them. What they’ve seen of the castle so far is so depressing, he can’t imagine any portrait with a choice would stick around. Still,
“Well, at least you won’t be facing that pile of paperwork alone,” Harry says to him with a small smile. It does feel like a relief, to be staying in a role he knows he’s good at, Ron at his side. It’s a small consolation, given all the things he apparently won’t be getting back.
Hermione comes over to join them. She hugs Harry tightly, forcing him to drop Draco’s hand, but then she reaches over and hugs Draco as well, prompting a slightly startled look.
. The awful part is he doesn’t even really recognise such a relaxed and happy version of himself. Lately it’s felt like his life has consisted of nothing but his Auror cases and the campaign. More recently it’s just consisted of feeling exhausted and paranoid all the time.
“Not a qualified one, no.” He taps his pen against his lip, still thinking about the rings. “But there’s some overlap with my work, so it helps to understand the basics. I’ve done some training.”
At this, Harry spins back to him, his mouth a surprised and delighted little O shape. Draco very much wants to snog him senseless, but the Hogwarts regulars have long memories and he will never live it down.
“You need to come ice-skating with me,” Harry announces, undeterred.
The diagnostic spells wash over him like a gentle breeze, the feel of Malfoy’s magic cool and refreshing. Harry bites his lip. The last thing he needs is to have to explain away getting aroused in the midst of a curse examination.
Her levitation charm is a medical one, nothing as clumsy as the ones they learned at school, and Ron’s prone form floats gently into the air. Neville immediately casts a sweeping spell that shifts the broken glass back to the wall like a crashing wave. It’s only as Hannah delicately lowers Ron back to the ground that Harry realises to his horror that there are several shards of glass protruding from him. He feels sick, and he pulls Hermione closer.
“I’d say you owe me one, but the list is so long now we’ve left traditional methods of counting behind.”
“What life?” Draco looks back at him, staring him down, voice cold and even.
“What?”
“What are you doing here,” Malfoy says, his voice sharp as he stalks into the room, snapping Harry out of his Christmas tree daydreams. He’s wearing dark suit trousers and a crisp white shirt, but the cuffs are unfastened and the top button undone. It makes Harry’s mouth go dry, as if he’d appeared in some state of indecent undress, even though there is literally no more of him on display than there normally is at the hospital.
Harry stands up slowly, raising his palms. “Only making sure medical attention wouldn’t help”. He doesn’t say,
“C’mon mate, it’s not that vital,” he hears Ron call from the other room, and wanders back to join them, still studying the foreign bit of paper.
Harry knows that Ron is right, even if it feels faintly ridiculous. Auror protocols require it.
Draco levels a look at him as if he’s being a bit dense and waits for Harry to catch up. Harry’s not sure what he’s getting at, unless,
“I’m fine, Luna. Let’s get on with it.”
Draco’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise, but he doesn’t laugh or say no, so Harry forges on.
fault,” he spits out. “
“Harry! Draco!”
. And then there was silence.”
“Perhaps you could call me Draco,” he says with a tired sigh. “I’ve had enough of my father’s name this weekend.”
Draco lurches forward, seizing the front of Harry’s robes and dragging him into a wholly unexpected hug.
“Let me show you where we’ve gotten to.”
“Heard you weren’t well, lad,” he says, eyeing Harry carefully.
“Showers it is, then, Wood. The rest of you, I’ll fly the Keeper position. Let’s go.”
“How?” Hannah asks, which is an excellent question.
“You didn’t ask me,” Luna points out, handing Harry three vials of anti-inflammatory potions. She’s been monitoring his health and fitness carefully and, like Leila, is insistent on him not pushing himself farther than his body can handle.
“Merlin only knows.” Malfoy waves his wand and the liquid retracts back under the door like a startled animal. He starts to cast again, sealing the edges of the door to the floor and the surrounding walls with a thick, rubbery strip.
Malfoy says nothing, but a faint flush rises on his pale cheeks.
“I’m saying I don’t think we should let it go this time,” Harry says earnestly, leaning forward to grab both of Draco’s hands in his own. “She doesn’t get to spoil this, Draco. You’ve made something incredible, and you’re doing really important work, and she doesn’t get to shit all over it.”
Draco holds his breath. There’s no way Potter read that.
“When she told them to sod off and threatened to report them, they attacked her. They didn’t have the formulation right yet, so her exposure wasn’t fatal.”
Harry’s chest feels tight. He realises Draco might be the only person besides Ron and Hermione who doesn’t see him as the caricature of a
Well, that makes a certain kind of sense. The old family properties were presumably spoils of war. Maybe all the heroes were handed new houses. He has an absurd moment picturing Neville Longbottom as lord of his childhood home, which is funny for only an instant before he starts to think about what the Manor was like in those final days. A shudder runs down his spine.
Luna smiles serenely. “I was waiting for him to be ready, Draco. There’s no hurry.”
Harry nods. He understands all too well the seriousness of what’s happened here.
“You quit?” Ron whispers, incredulous.
“You know what what this is about then,” he grimaces. He thought he’d left the Golden Trio keeping secrets long in his past.
“Righto, campfire,” Harry announces, refusing to let them slip completely into negativity before they even begin. He begins to wander around the wooded area behind the tents, picking up handfuls of kindling.
“It’s a good point,” Ron says. “How do you get Muggle mail at an unplottable house?”
