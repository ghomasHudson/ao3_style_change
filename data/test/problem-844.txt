,” Half took over, pointing at Holle's Pond, “is the entry. They say if you get real close to the edge, inside you can see a silver castle surrounded by a garden full of flowers, fruit and vegetables. Fun fact, one part of that actually belongs to Berchthold. He has his herbs garden down there. But aside from him and Holle, no one can enter the pond. That is, if you want to come out again: Anyone falling into the water will travel to the underworld immediately. So, I wouldn't recommend taking a swim.”
However, the next chapter will only be out in the new year, since I'm taking a two-week Christmas break. Expect it around January 11th.
Then, last week, I talked to my mother about something long ago and she used a phrase she'd said often before: "That was when you were still in the big pond." O.O Mindblown.... the subconcious is a scary thing.
Seeker, who could hardly believe his luck, stumbled after Anguis as they made their way towards the more populated park areas.
There was a moment of silence during which Draco looked desperately between the two teachers, hoping that, even if they mysteriously couldn't quite recall Potter, they would at least want to save a person in need of help.
I ran into him, out there. He couldn't see me and all, but he probably figured out this is a Hunt area or something. I think he's rather smart, yeah.”
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but didn't get a word in.
“You must really like him,” she said with a thoughtful expression.
As Draco had learnt, the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare was a hobby Granger had taken up back in their school days. Now, due to her status as war heroine, the movement had evolved quite a bit, so that it kept Granger rather busy with charity events and promotions.
“Visitors from up at the castle. Look, it's Harry, last year's champion.” She pointed at Draco's head and the geezer squinted his eyes. “And this is Malfoy. They got lost down here by accident.”
Also, I raise my hat to umbrellaless22, a hero in their own way. Thank you!
It was an April afternoon and the weather had decided to be stormy, rainy and wholly unpleasant. Draco cumbersomely folded his umbrella and knocked. He was right on time.
“Oof, don't use the big words now, Harry, you'll make Ron dizzy,” Ginny teased and shoved at her brother.
, but they are not set in the same story-line-universe. If you want to know more about The Wild Hunt though, go check out Storm Chasers ;)
Farewell wishes echoed from the crowd as the six of them made for the Pond.
Acquitted. Huh. Draco let out a long-held breath. Who would have seen that coming? Not him, that's for sure. Right up until the end of the trial he had been certain that he would spend the rest of his life in a cell in Azkaban – whether that would have been a long solitude or a short dread till receiving the Dementor's Kiss.
While they were whispering and prodding at the thread, Harry detected that each of them were similarly wearing a string-bracelet around their left wrists. All of theirs were red though, while Harry's was – “White! It's white! Do you see that? It's really white!” BraveHeart nearly pressed his nose into the cotton with agitation.
“Yeah, I, sure, okay, you're right, yeah,” Seeker ran a hand through his unruly black hair and smiled sheepishly. Of course, going back now would mean leaving his friends behind. His heart felt torn. Yet he had made up his mind the moment his eyes had met the other boy's. Seeker simply needed to speak with Grey Eyes; even if that meant saying goodbye to his gang.
At the following reception (which had included even the new-born Weasley of Bill and Fleur's), Draco had danced with Harry, the way he'd wished at the actual wedding, and Harry had dutifully stepped on Draco's toes in the process. It had been terribly romantic and Draco hadn't minded his hurting feet one bit.
“Er, do I know you?” Harry choked as the young man enthusiastically strangle-dragged him along, back into the centre of the crowd.
Draco gaped at him. “What? But that, that doesn't make any sense!”
“Draco, what are you talking about?” He waited a moment for an answer that didn't follow. “Where is that coming from?”
She was right of course. Harry had noticed it instantly, the moment he had met Half. All of them – Wolfe, BraveHeart, Half, even Ember – were not just around his age, but also glowing with that inner light. Not the horses though. Harry mused for a second if horses couldn't glow in this world.
He turned to leave the memorial site, when a sudden movement in the fifth line made him jump, wand at ready.
The last pages of the scrapbook were still empty; the final picture showed Harry in his Quidditch uniform, an arm around Draco and in victory pose.
“I'm throwing you off,” Draco grumbled and was secretly delighted to see Potter's small smile before he drew himself back up.
“Get a grip! I don't want to see that!”
snapped Harry between gritted teeth, anger flaring up. “The mess
“Oh, you don't know yet, Seeker, do you? Just wait and see, it's like super!” BraveHeart beamed and took Wolfe's hands to dance in a tight circle where they were shortly joined by Half.
Seeker's thumb traced idly the rather blunt edge of his small axe. They were part of the game since forever, he'd been told, and mostly just decoration. But he still didn't like the idea of carrying a weapon. Yet marking and using hiding spots had won his team many victories and he was not about to lose this round.
They were all but back to normal, however Seeker wasn't ready to let go of the conversation just yet. “What about Dreamer then?” he almost yelled over the carefree commotion.
Something indistinguishable flitted over Malfoy's face. He very carefully took one step back. That was definitely not a good sign.
“That's it!” Warrington cut it and beamed, looking so much like a little boy Hermione had difficulties to align the image with the mean point-docker she thought he was.
It only took Draco one trip to move everything he owned from the gatehouse to Grimmauld Place.
Then he lifted his wand.
The revised copy of a thick tome came sailing through the air from Headmistress McGonagall's bookcase in the farthest corner of the sitting room. Draco caught it with the ease of a former Seeker and took a nearly threatening step towards the hairnetted woman.
This time he was cut short by the exultant husband: “Knock it off, Ferret. You're at our wedding. Time to grow up, don't you think,
Harry could feel Malfoy's chest rise and fall with each breath, the blond hair tickling his neck where the Slytherin's head rested on his shoulder. It was surreal to have this kind of conversation in such an intimate setting as theirs.
done this a few times already and Draco was impressed by the others' resilience, especially since he was sure that by now both of them had completely forgotten about the original reason for starting the research: Potter.
Without preamble she had come in, sat down across him and declared that Harry Bloody Potter, War Hero Par Excellence, was going to be witness for the defence, because (she had used air-quotes here) “it's the right thing” and that poor, helpless Draco should just state the facts, be remorseful, stick to the sob story of a misguided child, appear pitiful (no problem there, incarceration did nothing for Draco's looks) and let Potter handle the rest.
“Can't what?” Harry snarled back and tugged more vehemently while simultaneously trying to force Malfoy's hands off. “Would you leave off already?”
Tillie shook her head, her bat-like ears flapping restlessly. She pressed Harry to her chest. “Dolly! Tillie's dolly!”
Seeker tugged at the handkerchief around his wrist.
Harry felt a prick of pride as he took in the mended walls, the clean hallways and fixed windows. The Patchers had really done a splendid job here. Even though there were still minor repairs afoot, the school as whole had reattained its functionality so that starting  tomorrow, first of September, students could once again walk the venerable halls of Hogwarts.
Draco huffed hot air. “Wow, that's really something.”
Finally, the coughing subsided, leaving an utterly wrecked-looking Malfoy in Harry's arms. “There, all better now.”
“What's with the haste?” Harry was half-dragged, half-pushed towards Lightning.
“I made the Hallows hoping that someday a worthy person would come into their possession, making them the master of Death and, when they once would die – not by another's hand but of their own volition – they should shoulder the burden and become the leader of The Hunt. Until the next master would come along.” Her hair floated in the breeze as she turned to look at the masked man behind her. “I just wanted to end your curse. You've served long enough.”
don't like
Harry sheepishly shook his head.
“Alright, alright, we get it, we love you again. Now go in there and take care of Goyle and then let's all grab a drink or something. Er, non-alcoholic of course,” Greengrass said, pointing at the door from behind which loud expletives were shouted their way.
Good memories indeed. In the scrapbook was a sunlit shot of the three of them. Right next to birthday celebration pictures of both Harry's birthday parties.
“Of course I know it,” Slytherin Harry tutted condescendingly and curled his upper lip. He tilted his head to the side and eyed Malfoy thoughtfully. “Should I break the spell so he'll  finally leave,” he bit his bottom lip in a startlingly sexy way, “and we can be
“I'm not ready!” Malfoy's tense voice was way too loud in the stadium. He had whipped around. “I can't, alright? Not yet. I...” His features softened. “Can you tell her though? To wait? Just a bit longer.”
Draco stayed silent, his fingertips playing with the handkerchief on Harry's wrist.
“Jam?” Tillie had taken a big bite out of the EAT ME cake and chewed with full cheeks.
He wasn't! He was–
“It was only for your own good!” Half shouted back, rubbing his face, ugly blotches appearing on his cheeks. “You should thank me!”
“I'm Alice,” confirmed Alice, “and this is my Anglo-Saxon March Hare. His name is Haigha.”
the snake sniffed.
She feigned a bow and the audience erupted in wild hoots and applause.
So they'd buried the truth between the two of them. So that the families of the dead would have the time to grief and let go; the way they needed it.
It was pointless to wonder about his deceased friends. The Hunt had moved on and they had gone with it to who-knew-where. They would not meet again. As it should be. The living and the dead were of separate worlds.
“Just take it!” hissed Harry. He wanted to get out of here. The suppressing feeling of the well's walls and the weird house-elves was getting overwhelming.
“Harm... I thought The Hunt is a funny group of dead beings continuously frolicking while chasing an unreachable goal?” Harry turned to Half, who felt somehow like the resident explainer of the gang.
Ding.
He swallowed, holding the opened ring box higher. “You must think I'm insane. We're barely out of our teens and have been dating for less than a year. But I just, Harry, I know I want to wake up next to your mop head in the morning. I want to share the last strawberry. I want to fight about who takes out the trash. I want to watch the sunrise with you. I want to hold your hand. Every day, for the rest of my life. ...do
Picking up happy tunes when he thinks he's found something...
“Indeed, Master Harry,” Death agreed.
-assed jokes?”
“Everyone but Draco. He could still remember you because you once were the owner of his wand for a short time and that made up the most powerful connection.”
Anguis agreed calmly and darted his tongue in and out when Seeker arched an eyebrow.
Draco cleared his throat to interrupt the taut silence. “Why would you even want to work with me?”
Christmas time at The Burrow was separated into two big events: family Christmas dinner on the 25th and friends Christmas lunch on the 26th. Last year, Draco had been invited to the latter. This year, as partner of Harry who was practically family, the two of them would attend the former.
Draco looked away. Half-breeds. These grimy water dwellers were even worse than he had thought, not even real merpeople. And yet (and that gnawed at him quite a bit), he was somehow touched by their tragic story. Well, not
Wiping tears from his face, Harry straightened up. “Draco, I know how to find the baby. I know how to find The Hunt.”
“Yes. This is what we need to do: Ron, you take this.
! Draco, don't go! My name! Say my name!” Seeker pounded the division with his fists. “Please, take me with you!”
Potter's grip tightened in Draco's robes.
tell you though is this: The cloak has been an heirloom in your father's side's family for a long time. So long indeed that he had forgotten about it and I... let's say I made him aware that it was in his possession.”
we can use letters as well as numbers. Which means I can send word to him (and everyone else, but let's not dwell on that for now) and he can message back.”
He groaned and the other boy chuckled. “You didn't notice the wardrobe was a bit more cramped than usual?”
The rest of it had been a magical night, in more than one way.
“What is it?” he asked, mesmerised, one hand carding through the brightness, watching with delight how every movement changed the curly patterns.
“Obviously,” Ron repeated sarcastically, but Hermione was already lost in thought.
“Never,” Malfoy rasped immediately and a shudder went through his body.
, warning everyone to look away.
Queen Harry's eyes glinted murderously. “Excellent. You go first.”
Seeker nodded and climbed up Lightning's back, holding on for dear life and feeling ill – and what's more, like he had forgotten to do something important. But The Hunt was moving on and his horse knew the way and why worry? He laid his head onto Lightning's neck and tried for a bit more sleep, another knot on his bracelet turning red.
The latter was of course the reason that Potter's sidekicks were currently hidden under a (gorgeous!) Invisibility Cloak. Pansy would give half her jewellery to possess such a marvel and the other half if she could tell Draco. He would be so pleased to finally get to know how Potter pulled all those stunts without getting caught. But alas, she probably wouldn't be able to disclose this to anyone, for that stupid secrecy contract. At least now they were in the loop of what had happened so far.
Harry still grinned as he opened the bathroom door and was flooded with thankfulness. Here was another thing he'd missed without consciously missing it: toilets.
Chess pieces started darting at them, hitting Malfoy and the wall behind them. Thud, thud, clank, thud. Harry was pressed, face-first, into the soft, painted bark of the summer tree and the dim part of his brain that wasn't occupied with howling registered that this was a pretty unique way of dying: being crushed and torn apart at the same time.
were the one who wanted to talk?”
“Ready when you are,” answered Harry and pointed his own wand at the entrance.
. So, why not? Harry reached for the handle with his right hand and took a long sip of what tasted like weak tea with cream in it. Not bad. He downed the whole cup in one go.
Still. If only... if only she had some boobs like Granger instead of her own flat country... Sigh.
Seeker shrugged. “He doesn't like losing, don't mind him.”
Death mounted Sleipnir and turned in the saddle to look down at Harry and Draco: “One last thing. Remember the story of this one,” he jabbed his finger at the bird, “stealing children and how they come back different?” Draco shook his head, but Harry knew what Death meant. “Now that she 'stole' you, Harry, you came back as a...”
He crossed the closed double doors to the Great Hall, slowed and finally stopped in front of them. He suddenly felt cold trickling into the heat that had been caused by the whole Potter business. Draco always got chills when he passed here. Carefully, with a measured gesture, he reached out to touch the left of the two copper plaques fixed to both sides of the heavy portal. His fingers traced the name,
Harry thoughtfully observed as the giant went to lay down beneath a single oak tree at Holle's Pond's edge. The tree looked just as much out of place as the man.
“Frigg is driving out to bless the harvest. It's about time too, after all it's already the end of July.” Wolfe dusted off her dress from powdery snow and turned around. “Ember, should we have Dreamer blessed as Frigg goes by?”
Head out of the gutter and into the game. “Alright, I'll put my hands on your hips and pull you up, yeah?”
Just, how to start...? Harry's thoughts about an opening move were interrupted when Malfoy, out of nowhere, grabbed a handful of Queen Harry's shirt and yanked him up, his pointy face an angry grimace: “
Harry shook his head. “No. He knows the way out.”
= "The airborne hunt, it's that, right?" (French)
To his horror, both his travel companions laughed at that (he did not let himself think 'at him'). They just didn't know what was what, those savages. Hmpf.
“The glow!” squeaked BraveHeart. “It's the glow! We told you!”
, he'd said. Harry sighed. “Get up, Lightning is strong. He can carry two.” He held out his hand for Ember to grab.
He growled. Time to sleep: Potter, green eyes, stupid glasses, black bird's nest.
The stairs they were trapped on were on the left side confined by a yawning chasm of darkness and even when Harry leant over the handrail as much as he could and peered down, he saw nothing but dust particles, doing a slow dance in the flickering glow of the only source of illumination in the stairwell. The light stemmed from two candles, respectively mounted on the left and right corner of an ancient-looking grandfather clock that had partly been built into the wall at around the height of the trick step.
Draco panicked. “I don't! I don't have to tell you jack! So, stow it!”
Horns and darker tones for Bertchhold, almost dangerous for those who fear The Hunt.
Ever since one random day in April, he couldn't recall Potter's given name anymore. At first he hadn't even noticed, as seldom as Draco used it, but when it hit him, he had tried everything to get the name back, to no avail so far.
Side by side they landed on the snow-covered shore of a midnight blue pond.
He tried to turn around, but his legs gave way under him and he sank to the ground.

The tea Half had given him. Oh God.
“Brilliant. A dead end,” Malfoy groaned and flung himself into a nearby armchair with fading blue satin fabric.
“What were you doing in Sirius' old room?”
Grinning from ear to ear, Harry ran a thumb over his lower lip. The tingling sensation was still there.
“I know what you're thinking.” Wolfe patted Seeker's knee. “But it's a good thing, really.”
Which was how Draco found himself here, on Christmas, fixing a wall with Potter.
Today was Monday not Wednesday, so... had to be something important.
“My father's tribe drowned whoever tried to flee to the sea. In the end, only a handful of us escaped.”
Granger sighed heavily. “Boys, really, we had that in class! Or I mean, parts of it. But it makes sense: Thestrals are ghost horses which left The Hunt for one reason or another. That's why they are connected to death and misfortune in people's minds. Same goes for Grims; they are ghost dogs that defected from The Hunt. What do you gather?”
“Oh, I do, too, it's just...”
“Headmistress,” he nearly screamed, making everyone flinch. “Did you by any chance bring some biscuits?”
of all people. Malfoy, who had truly been more than insufferable since he’d been given the Inquisitorial Squad power by that pink toad Umbridge after Dumbledore’s flight last month. That slimy git’s grin at catching sight of Harry had told him all the detention he would have to do – if he got caught that was.
“Death is part of life, you know,” Half offered carefully. “You can't help them now. But look at us: We are dead. That doesn't mean we can't still be happy. Alright?”
“Erm, sorry to interrupt, but I just need–”
“Your owl's name is... Pig...” Pansy couldn't help but remark and she exchanged looks with Cassius who shrugged.
“Hypothetically,” Draco said, his voice had a tone Harry had never heard before and which gave him goosebumps, “if Harry had... died... riding with The Hunt – what would have happened to him who is master of Death?”
“Well...” Weasley smirked and his freckles danced in the wand light, “we have our ways.”
Still, it had taken all of Draco to get out of bed that day and even more so not to crawl right back in once they had found out that the traditional appearance period of The Wild Hunt typically ended on January 6th. They would have to wait for the next Yuletide to come around to find the ghost riders again. Which meant, Potter would have to stay with The Hunt for a whole year.
“Or maybe,” Potter said in a low voice and shifted so he was facing Draco fully, “we can both sleep here.”
“Sorry, what now?”
All thanks to my cherished beta
What Draco needed was... something else. Something of which he wasn't sure himself what it was. Just that he needed to find it. Preferably alone. Because, while everyone else was trying to get over the war, Draco was still in battle. With himself, his own demons, his guilt.
“If you're keeping things from me–”
Draco glanced at the happy bridal couple. “Should we take this outside? No need to cause a scene.”
There was no more wind, no sound, no nothing. Only a face. A laughing face framed by tousled black hair, with piercing green eyes behind round glasses.
There were voices in the hallway and Harry made his way down to meet his friends.
“Hello, Gregory,” Draco said carefully.
He glanced Malfoy's way. Finding him here was a bit unexpected and Harry really didn't know what to make of it.
“Not chess!” Harry groaned.
Next he had sat down in a still intact room in the otherwise heavily destroyed Hogwarts, full of former schoolmates who mostly hated him, to take his N.E.W.T.s. The school had announced that despite everything, any of the seventh years who wanted to sit the exam should be allowed to. Naturally, everyone had come. Thus the tests had been ridiculously easy in consideration of half of the test takers' inability to partake in classes during the past year. Draco had passed all subjects with flying colours. Obviously.
Away.”
“It better be.” Malfoy turned left.
, as you put it.” He chewed his lip. “But thanks for, you know, reclaiming me. That was... nice... of you. Those three were just a bit too cuckoo for my taste.”
“The others?” Draco asked bewildered, which earnt him furious twin stares by the girls. He ducked. What the bloody hell was happening?
Draco could almost hear Potter blink. “Is there generally?”
Harry hesitated.
Merchieftainess Murcus swallowed hard.
Walking to the nearest fireplace, a song popped unbidden into his head. Being reminded of the window had prompted it. Draco slightly shook his head. What had he been thinking singing love songs to himself in the middle of the night?
“Cool, yeah, so, she said you were pretty good at, er, research and finding stuff and well, the thing is,” Thomas rubbed his neck, uncertain, “I'm looking for someone.” He produced a small paper covered in notes. “We were caught together by a gang of Snatchers. They took her somewhere else later. I don't know her name, but she was middle-aged, Muggle-born, brunette, average build. She said she had two kids at home. It's all on here.” He held the paper out to Draco. “She was nice to me and I never knew what became of her, if she's even still alive. Can you look for her?”
“I'm sure they will,” Death surmised, “but all in due time. Until then, we will continue the task. Voluntarily.” He winked. “It's something I've learned from you,
We've come a long way. I'm glad you all accompanied me.
Draco's heart skipped and then he grinned widely. “Is that so? Well, I don't want to seem greedy. You can pay for the wedding.”
“But now I remember everything and I still want you.”

Seeker's eyes went big as saucers when Draco started doing magic (what else could it be?), burning little doodles in the sand – a lightning bolt, round glasses, a heart...
Mabel laughed at their exchange as Draco harrumphed and eyed his lobster instead of answering. Like he wanted to
“Like my ass then, eh? I hope you got a good look because you'll never have that pleasure again,” Malfoy sneered, but he wouldn’t meet Harry's eyes.

“De...?”
It came from the bedroom, on the other side of the hallway.
“No!” The boy stamped his foot.
Draco fidgeted, unsure. Then he straightened his back. For Potter.
“What?” Pansy frowned.
He looked so vulnerable that Harry had the sudden impulse to wrap his arm around Malfoy's shoulder or take his hand again, like that one morning by the lake. Harry'd never allowed himself to think about it too much, but retrospectively, that had been odd. Holding hands with his old school bully as if it were nothing, as if it were perfectly normal.
“And you think Harry's there now?” Granger ploughed on.
“Great! That's settled then. You lads go and get your brooms down at the Quidditch pitch. Next!”
Not that they never cried to each other. Tears made guest appearances often enough. But it never went
Mr. Ollivander ought to have provided clarification on a good theory, instead it had ruined everything.
“If I parted with my feet, would I have to write them letters?” Alice mused, completely unfazed by the escalating argument. “Wouldn't that be funny? Imagine: Alice's Right Foot, Esq., Table, Helga's Tea Room, (with Alice's love).”
Sorry for the late chapter!
“Good morning to you, too, Malfoy,” was the girl's reply and she made to push past him, her boyfriend in tow, as if Draco had invited them in instead of producing incoherent stammering.
Sure enough: “If you're angling, Potter, I'm afraid you'll come up empty handed.” Malfoy crossed his arms in front of his chest.
“Sorry, it's just – weasels and ferrets are actually distant relatives in the animal kingdom,” Granger giggled.

.” Malfoy peered up. “Are you saying you've never heard of the Wental Mell?”
“Let's do this then,” Draco instructed, “Ember? Come over here. You too, Mr. Withane. Hold the bodies close together.”
“That's true,” confirmed Granger, though she didn't look as convinced.
(Aren't proofreaders just a-ma-zing?)
“Oh, I just realised it's Halloween this weekend. Ginny and I had thought of going to visit my parents' graveside together.”
He made a move to swim up and Mabel's spear was once again pointed at him. “No. It's not safe. I won't let you.”
glow. Isn't that so? We are glowing to you as well, aren't we?”
“Farewell,” said Death solemnly.
Draco cringed a bit. “Whatever,
“Oh, yes. But don't worry, we'll honour your wishes and won't call your real names.” Harry and Draco had talked about it on the way. “That way, you can stay with The Hunt and live happily. More so than if you'd know your identity but couldn't go back to your lives. Since you're dead and all.” That sounded sad somehow. Better add something uplifting. “Oh, but we have the means to visit whenever we want to now, so we'll see each other plenty, I'd wager.”
Potter gave him a taxing glower. “If you are thinking about complaining that I inherited your precious pure-blood heritage, don't. I had enough of that from your great aunt's portrait and let me tell you this,
in the Leaky Cauldron of all places?
They love us over there!”
“What's your name now, hm?” The owl flapped its wings. “How about I give you one, would you like that?” He received a tender nip on his index finger. “Alright. So are you a girl or a boy? Er, I think girl.” An affirmative chirp. “Right, so... how about... Snowdrop?” Snowdrop seemed delighted and rubbed her head affectionately on the boy's biceps.
As if reading his mind, Potter declared: “Well, it's late. I slept on the frozen ground for a year, I can sleep on the couch for now.”
“Malfoy,” Harry shrugged his left shoulder to unhinge the Slytherin currently leaning onto him to better hiss directions into his ear, “shove over and give me some room.”
think it would be best if we all took turns,” Wolfe interjected from her horse Binky's left side. She smiled at Ember. “You're one of us, we should all share."
Seeker growled. Perchta. Dormarth. Holle. Couldn't that woman keep one name like every other person? Maybe he should just call her Rolf indefinitely and be done with it.
: It's rude. Isn't that so, Draco?”
Harry was on the verge of zoning out, when Malfoy started humming. It was a gentle melody that made Harry feel at ease. After a while words were added here and there, quietly, in a language, Harry was almost certain, was French.
'Ugh, we're not
I would think, this is more or less Queen Harry's song. What do you think?

“Well, it's really not that difficult, Seeker, it's
“Chop chop, you lovebirds, time to work!” Granger clapped her hands. She'd just finished applying the enhancing spells. “We'll be down in the dungeons for your reply. You'll find us, right?”
Hermione smiled. “Oh, not you two. I was talking about your friend Malfoy.”
Hey ^^
Malfoy swallowed audibly. “That's... unique.” His eyes snapped to Harry. “May I have Potter back now?”
Hermione's mouth snapped open, but Draco, who feared another argument, quickly intervened. “Presents!” he yelled, making the other two flinch. “Time for presents.
“Only because I bribed her earlier to leave me alone,” Draco admitted, stiffly petting the skeleton cat between her ears. “Guess she never got a Christmas present before.”
For a hot second there he thought about explaining the Hunt thing to Thomas, but then he abandoned that idea. A boy he had wronged badly was asking for his help. Draco would find that woman and thusly clear a fraction of his debts.
Mounting their brooms, Draco couldn't help himself but voice a thought that had just occurred to him. “Is that why you're here so often? Because your family is shit?”
“Four-eyes!”
“That's old Mr. Frog and his mate Mr. Fish. They are going to meet their bingo group down at the east end of the lake,” Mabel said matter-of-factly and waved to the two passersby who promptly returned the gesture. She nudged Draco none too gently. “You are not very nice, are you?”
Impossible. It couldn't be. Or could it? Could the whispered stories of vanished or eradicated people really be true? That they never truly existed in the first place? Had Potter's life been erased when he'd been taken, like in the old tales?
“Lavatory flush pipe.”
Harry froze and he could feel Malfoy do the same, his upper arm still pressing against Harry's.
– or with you really, as we can see by the fact you're all alone out here.”
“Oh.” Even with simple beings like those it was better to be respectful towards the higher-ups.
“Very well, what is it you are inquiring about?”
“Rounds.” It was more like a grunt. “Inquisitorial... Squad.”
Weasley rolled his eyes and went: “You're a real
the snake snapped back.
Seeker said goodbye to the moss folk and took a last look around the clearing that had been his home for the last year. He felt somewhat nostalgic, as if he would never come here again.
Swiftly scratching a few lines onto Warrington's parchment, she topped the words off with a  familiar jinx and then proof-read her work with a satisfied nod. “That will do. Now, if you would please sign this?”
“From then on, we met every sundown. She told me about her life, I told her about mine. She revealed how she'd noticed me in the waves, how she had started hoping I'd come back.”
Aside from wearing a nice dress that practically screamed 'holidays', her appearance was in disarray, her bushy hair even wilder than usual. She looked livid.
Cassius frowned. “What does it say? Pansy, can you translate? My Old English is lousy.”
“That,” Harry panted, “was grotesque. I don't even look like that. What were they thinking?”
Draco huffed exasperatedly, but couldn't hide a smile. “Yes, yes, that's sweet. But I'd rather you would think about yourself first. You never worry about yourself.” He scrunched up his nose. “Guess that's my job now.”
Harry blinked, momentarily confused by hearing his own voice articulate words he'd never say in that way. Then something occurred to him. “But you know my name! You just said it.”
Unfortunately others seemed to have had the same idea and so, when Draco had first arrived to help, he had been put off by the masses of people.
“She's Huginn-Muninn today; thought and memory.” Berchthold's voice boomed through the Forest and made both Harry and Draco flinch back.
“They aren't friends,” Myrtle corrected, mirth back in her eyes. “They can never be just friends.”
“An Invisibility Cloak,” the witch had repeated, raising an eyebrow. “Why?”
While Draco treated Kreacher nicer than he had ever treated any house-elf, because Draco tried to turn over a new leaf, he secretly thought that rights for house-elves were nonsense (they liked serving, so what?). But he had taken to following Weasley's lead whenever Granger started S.P.E.W.ing and silently nodded along to her ramblings. He had even joined, albeit rather reluctantly and only because he knew that Granger could get any job she wanted, yet she had chosen to be without one for the time being to assist her parents, do S.P.E.W. things and last but not least, help him look for Potter.
Something that sounded suspiciously like mumbled swear words were the only answer Harry got.
“Evening.” Harry grinned as Malfoy flinched and spun around. “Nice password they have this week. Got good taste, this year's Slytherins.”
“Yes and there are scorch marks from bonfires all over,” Granger chimed in, holding her wand higher to illuminate a wider circle. “And, are those marshmallows?”
“I was, I am,” squeaked the addressee and hid her face behind her hands. “I forgot to send a replacement. Oh, Ada, do you hear the magical warning drums? The squid is close.”
Mabel ignored his protest, grabbed Draco's upper arm and –
“Can't we go five seconds without fighting?” Granger's voice sounded so annoyed Pansy could imagine her put-off expression. “It's a great plan though, Ron. Go on then.”
“I, er, would very much like my, hm, dolly back, if you please?” he sounded a tad shaky. What the hell was going on? What was a Wental Mell?
I came up with this: Muchness is having enough. If it's the right thing, on tiny bit is enough; then you have much.
Harry looked back at the school, its silhouette glittering on the lake's surface. The lights from the high windows danced on the water like specks of gold.
“Oh, don't we know it!” Half leered and decided to tip Wolfe over. She squealed and trashed as he pressed fervent kisses onto her face.
“Well, that was a flop, wasn't it?” Weasley dropped down next to the witch.
“Seeker–” BraveHeart started.
“Dragon?” Draco whispered.
“That's right. It is under the castle,” Dobby explained.
Draco turned to his right. “No biscuits for you, Thomas. You punched me,” the dark-haired boy's face went grim so that Draco couldn't help himself and grinned, “and gave me a mission. Here.” He held out an envelope to his sceptical bench neighbour. “It's all in there. Happy holidays.”
I added a few bonus songs, such as mentioned songs (
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. “You do that.”
Potter's tiny face appeared before Draco's eyes, hanging upside down. “What?”
Granger looked bewildered. “Go?”
Sorry about that. I tried to implement a date fairly early in each chapter or after a time shift, but I can see, how that could have been a bit much.
But the ever-rising cacophony of sounds made his words almost inaudible even to himself. “DON'T LOOK!”
“Look at that: Gold Harry and Pitch Crabbe,” Draco whispered the words so quietly into Harry's ear that no one else could hear. Harry snorted and shoved at him.
Zabini's face with the high cheekbones went even more ominous. “She had a nervous breakdown last week. Couldn't deal any more. Mother took her on a spa trip to quote unquote
“Aoife however was true to the meaning of her name –
Ron hummed non-committally and Hermione let it slide. Really, she'd spent too many years with these two troublemakers.
Malfoy sputtered and finally pushed away from Harry, to sit back in his own arm-chair. “He isn't!”
“It wouldn't help you anyway. Out there, in the world of the living, no one even knows you exist and you can't tell strangers because... You must have realised it on your trip: People can see us only during Yuletide since that is the time between years – one year ends, a new one begins – a crossroad of sorts. That's when Perchta's powers are strongest and between her and Berchthold they can make us all visible. But only then. Now, we are nothing but shadows, protected by the barriers of Hunt magic.”
“Fine,” she said flippantly, examining her nails as she spoke. “According to the rules, safe zones are either under flax stalks (good luck finding those in the forest). Or you can create hiding spots by cutting one to three crosses into a hollow tree trunk with your axe while saying
that he had been at Hogwarts... When Draco would finally get Potter back from The Hunt, Draco would forbid him to
“We won't. Cross my heart,” Wolfe promised and the others nodded, following her in motioning a crossing gesture over their chests. Snowdrop hooted and Scoffer gave a weak woof. “We will miss you of course, when you go, but we want the best for you, truly.”
He was in a good mood, humming the Bridal Chorus from Wagner's opera
He had only made it three steps down the corridor though when Potter's hand slipped under his elbow and manoeuvred him through the closest door into the very waiting room Draco had met his parents again after not having had seen them in weeks. The feelings of happiness about the reunion and trepidation on the prospect of maybe never seeing them again after today still hung in the air like invisible smoke and made Draco suddenly claustrophobic.
“That's not the only rubbing we've been doing,” leered the Weasel.
There had been a big official party in the Great Hall – and another unofficial one down at the Quidditch pitch in form of a Patchers match with Draco and Harry pitted against each other as Seekers of the opposing teams. It had been an epic game and even though Harry's team won by a smidge, he'd made it up to Draco during their own little, very exclusive after-party in their bedroom later.
“Too bad, break's over.” Mabel winked at Draco. “You'll have to try Caucus-racing next time then.”
“At the cliffs. When you looked at me. I saw your lips move.”
Hey, how are you all?

Draco hadn't
Hermione's head shot up, eye's glinting, but fierce. “What's with that tone? Are you on
He would miss all of them – Dreamer and Scoffer and Lightning and everyone. Harry closed his eyes. He had had no chance to say goodbye.
“He's devoured by flames,” said Ember gravely, who'd appeared at Harry's shoulder. “A bit like me.”
The boy leant back in his arm-chair and sipped tea from his cup. “You truly have no manners, Potter. If you ask for someone's name it is polite to give yours first.”
“Yeah, I could use one, too,” Draco wheezed, still clutching his stomach with one arm. That guy was
Death slowly clapped his hands, deafening like cracks of thunder. “Very good, Master Harry. Yet you missed one thing. Nosy people that call themselves knowledgeable often claim that the Elder Wand's core is a Thestral tail hair. That's only partly true; it's a tail hair from Sleipnir.”
I'm mindblown. Isn't it just incredible?
Harry laughed quietly, his low rumbles rippling through Draco's body. “Ah,welllll,” his fingers danced playfully on Draco's ticklish side, “that doesn't apply to
Replaying the scene in the bedroom earlier, Harry blushed. Coming to the realisation that he indeed had completely lost it for
castle.”
Apparently not. Probably Draco didn't expect the famous Harry Potter to look so shabby.
Grinning a bit, she put down her own name as return address and placed the 'pass' note on the front. Yeah, she was, wasn't she? “Stuff this one into the other one. This way, your brother can use the pre-approved envelope to forgo the screening. That should work.”
= It shall dry! [Latin]
Ron thrust the map at her and pointed at two quickly moving little dots, apparently sprinting down the third floor Charms corridor. “Code Ferret!”
Draco had realised the first time he'd seen that creature back at Hagrid's hut in sixth year that this was most certainly the very same animal that had attacked Draco in third year. Hagrid could call that beast any number of code names but it was still the hippogriff that should have been executed a long time ago.
Potter was the first to break the silence. “So?”
has taken more than just my daughter. As if there is another piece – another person? – missing. There are things that make no sense, as though parts of my memory were incomplete...”
“Guess not,” Longbottom agreed. His expression turned thoughtful. “Do you ever think it's wrong to have fun at Hogwarts when so many of our friends died here?”
. If we ever capture her, the world will start anew. A new beginning. The eternal circle,” Half's words carried effortlessly over the storm.
“We shall,” Pansy agreed.
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry rolled his eyes and shoved at the annoyer. “But I didn't sign up for cuddling so stop leaning on me and sit on the edge of my knees.”
Everyone had been happy with the little presents Draco had gotten for them – especially Millicent's eyes had shone at the sight of the framed picture of Howard. The big girl always had had a soft spot for cats.
So simple. And yet a thousand unsaid words.
“Sort of,” was the chipper reply.
Grumbling expletives about dirt and Harry and crazy house-elves and Harry, Malfoy got up just when the dim light from above was cut off with a screeching kind of sound: apparently had the barrel been pushed back to its original place.
“Why are you asking?” BraveHeart lay on his stomach, his mask riding on top of his mouse-brown hair. While he couldn't let go of the mask completely, there were more and more times when he openly showed his face. Seeker couldn't be prouder.
“She isn't!” proclaimed Potter vehemently and Draco secretly agreed. Well, not that he cared either way.
“It's not like that,” Draco growled, wishing himself very far away. Why, oh why, did he think of coming here?
Look he did though, when Potter lifted his wand and weaved a complicated figure into the air: left, right, diagonally across, upwards curve and tiny clockwise loops fizzling out towards the end.
“Then why,” Harry pulled in frustration and ended up with Malfoy toppling over and pulling them both down, with the final outcome of the blond boy being splayed half in Harry's lap, who groaned and sacked back into the chair, “don't you ask Perfect Potter over there how to undo this predicament? I'm sure a Slytherin would know the answer. No wait, maybe you should have imagined a Ravenclaw me.”
One of the tiny creatures wearing a skirt and a blouse with a matching blue hat looked vaguely familiar.
The gang dissolved into laughter, while the newly named man-dog Scoffer looked accusingly at them all in turn before putting his head back onto his paws with a huff.
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “...I think –
Harry blinked, then blinked again. “No way...” If Malfoy hadn't clearly also been able to see her, Harry would have thought he was hallucinating. Because
) and
The nice weather had attracted hordes of visitors and the park was packed with people. Draco studied a map and then ambled along the Long Walk, a pedestrian road that led like an axis through the middle of the park.
Harry shrugged. “Why not? If I'm the master, I can set my servant free. Like your father did with Dobby. Really not that difficult, I think. And didn't The Tale of the Three Brothers end with them as equals, the third brother and Death?”
The house-elf startled. “Of course. Kreacher will do as young Master Malfoy says.” He bowed.
As weary as Draco was of the Forest, others seemed to be even less inclined to do this work, so he had ended up marching out on his own on this crisp autumn day at the end of October (not super unusual per se).
“I like all sorts of mustard,” offered Alice from the head of the table. “Rumour is, the best mustard-mines are on the moon.”
“Ah, that?” Wolfe opened one eye and shot him a look, before closing it again. “Berchthold.”
I left you hanging with a sort-of cliffhanger on a literal cliff >.<
Draco started. He hadn't thought about that yet.
Harry flinched violently and blanched. “Wha-what did you just say?”
with him, somehow. For better or worse. Mostly worse.”
“Shortly before the start of the Death Eater trials this summer. Why?”
to hold my hand. That would be a nightmare for you, wouldn't it?”
“Did I miss something?” BraveHeart landed next to Seeker and wiped some sweat off his forehead, startling his friend out of his reverie.
“Fine,” the ginger grumbled and she heard the ruffle of the Invisibility Cloak, “want to hear my suggestion now?”
“It's okay, really.”
“Well~,” Death drawled, shifting from foot to foot, “we hoped you would find your will to live again
“Yeah, that's right, coward! Just run away. That's the thing you do best,” Potter spat as the gardener started gathering his things.
“I assume you'd like to try, Potter?” he asked nonchalantly. If Potter said no, Draco could still bail.
“Potter has to play. He's the one who accepted the challenge,” insisted Queen Harry petulantly and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
! Give my sister back right now,
“Spi-what-what-what?”
Finally, he stopped in front of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and took a deep breath. Through the shop's windows he could clearly see that the inside was packed with more people than should be allowed. But he still needed an uplifting gift for Greg as he was to stay in St. Mungo's during the holidays, although he was already much better. There was the chance that he could be released soon after New Year's.
“Looks like slogan ideas maybe?
Of course, Draco, Vincent and Gregory were close. How could they not be? After all, they'd known each other from an early age. However, His Majesty had been right about this part (duh, Draco had
Mabel jerked her head towards the children. “They are doing a Caucus-race.” Her lips split into a grin, showing all her yellow teeth. “Actually, wanna join in?”
“That's why you're both the leader of The Hunt,” Harry developed the thought further.
“Don't be such a pussy, Malfoy. If you don't want it, at least lift it up here so I can have a try. I'm a bit tired of being small.”
Uncharacteristically silent, the tiny boy handed over the sweets and sat down next to Seeker.
They made it through dessert and into the living room, played parlour games and exchanged gifts. Harry gave Draco a Muggle book named
“Anyway...” Harry started, unsure of what exactly he wanted to say but suddenly desperate to keep the conversation going.
Sometimes the redhead
Looking at the stuffed animal gave Harry pause. He had a Somewhen Thing that clearly belonged to a child. If there was a child waiting for him somewhere, shouldn't he put more effort into returning? Or maybe this was just something reminding him of his own childhood? Yes, that was more likely. He

which means hell and would fit the Mother Holle fairy tale where the Marys fall down into Holle's realm. But only recently I found out that Holle actually used to be the German adjective
“Are you okay?” Wolfe's voice was small and she looked concerned.
He had told Draco that he 'liked' him. How soon was too soon to rectify this statement, to confess deeper feelings...?
“Yeah, mate, cool idea.”
Draco glanced at Potter. “You're here, too.”
Draco opened his mouth in righteous indignation, but Harry elbowed him and shook his head. Better not let a razor-sharp Malfoy-tongue loose on Death himself. There could be severe consequences.
“Couldn't have done it if you had given me away at the Manor. If you'd identified me then, I would have been too dead to save you.” Potter managed to grin, that idiot.
Skilfully wrapped around Snowdrop's ankle was something that seemed to be a rolled-up leaf. Seeker carefully extracted it and unfurled the green sheet.
However, Malfoy interrupted him: “And there's another entrance, right here.”
Momentarily, it looked like they would start hexing each other, but both of their attention was drawn to the shaking girl in their midst who was holding her stomach and trying really hard not to burst into laughter.
How fitting. Trick stair, trick door... Maybe this was Peeves' doing...?
Malfoy sat up straight and nodded. “Yeah, this is all a mad, mad dream. I will laugh about it when I wake up.”
looked for Malfoy – or at him?”
It had been odd, like some sort of thinly-veiled presence: Ever since they'd rounded the corner and entered this particular corridor, the clock had tucked at Hermione's attention. Even with her mind focused on Harry's sudden disappearance, she had noticed the little rabbit statue on top of the clock-face.
A bell sounded from somewhere.
I had nothing
Greg had been released from St. Mungo's and the whole Slytherin gang had gone to congratulate him and celebrate his sobriety.
“So, all things I mentioned so far are related to ghost types of the mind or in other words, they are somewhat connected to character and personality. There is however also another sort of ghost-like apparitions that are linked to the soul.”
Draco frowned. That was just plain mean. What the fudge had those men been thinking? Simply because she...? His frown deepened. What was
“Righttttt,” the redhead agreed and then launched into a wild marketing sale that had Draco's ears ringing when he finally stepped back out onto the street (
He scrunched up his nose. Wow, yeah, that actually made a lot of sense. Hadn't BraveHeart/Colin said something about this? Seemed like Harry owed him an apology. The story hadn't been all that made-up in the end.
Draco looked at Harry as if he were the eighth Wonder of the World. “Can you do that?”
family.”
“Don't.” Ember's voice was low. “It might not seem that way but we are completely safe inside Berchthold's storm – Half told me so. As long as we stay in the middle of it, nothing will harm us. We are The Wild Hunt.”
the rule violations tonight, isn't it?”
“Oh, that's easy: You're glowing,” stated Wolfe after checking with a quick glance that a pale-faced Half wasn't going to answer. BraveHeart nodded eagerly.
“Of course. What else would matter?”
The pursuer collided with Harry's back in full swing, catapulting them both forward onto the dangerously creaking construct. All Harry could do was to grab the handrail with one hand and Malfoy, who was en route to smash his head on the stairs, with the other; yanking him close around his middle.
And with that she rushed forward to kiss a floundering Harry on both cheeks, while in the Entrance Hall on the opposite side of the portal, a hilariously hideous portrait of a goofy-faced Harry was unveiled and people started 'ooh'ing and clapping.
“Yeah, alright. Good job, you. Have at it then,” Draco sighed and fed the bird a piece of toast, which he happily munched while Draco unfurled the attached scroll with a frown.
Draco found his eyes darting this way and that. He couldn't look at Potter. Shit. This was definitely not the way Draco had imagined confessing. In fact, he had not planned on ever saying anything about that at all.
“No... idea. Never... seen... before.” The new yoga master swallowed noisily, then fell silent again.
How did all these people with their flock and wains manage to get in here? And how on earth would
Malfoy finally ripped his gaze from the walls (Malfoy watching Harry getting detention in Umbridge's class.) and faced him. “No. But I don't think it would help with this height anyway, Potter. Use your brain as long as you still can.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Hard. “Why don't
? And three: I know for a fact, that was a joke. But since he understands you so well and how nosy you can be, he planted your real gift here and I'm sure he would have told you that if you had asked him,” Draco chided sternly, “which you didn't, did you?”
Parkinson paled.
Harry however was momentarily distracted as Alice had unprompted started singing very loudly and out of tune:
when it didn't budge.
His aunt was so different from other pure-bloods that Draco often found himself wondering how she had become like this in the household she had grown up in. But he hadn't dared ask her yet.
That had everyone jumping up and scattering in bustling busyness.
What the hell.
Cassius rummaged a moment and produced the requested items. It was always interesting how many useful (and diverse) things found space in this boy's pockets.
What emerged though wasn't a girl at all. Rather it was a mountain of a boy: broad shoulders, thick neck, gorilla-like arms and a flat nose in an expressionless face under a pudding-bowl haircut. He was dressed in nothing but a singed piece of old robes, arranged carelessly around his privates. The most interesting thing about this newest addition to Harry's ever-growing assortment of weirdos though was the sooty skin that was interveined with dimly glowing red veins, making him look like a moving bulk of half-hardened lava. Ember, glowing ashes, of course.
The double meaning wasn't lost on Draco. “I'd like that.”
Draco shuddered. “That's disgusting! There must be another way in!”
...oh and, if you think I forgot something in the last scene. I didn't. Someone else did. And they will figure that out in the next chapter. So, just you know, it is deliberate.
Draco eyed it carefully for a moment, before opening it and unfolding the contained paper.
Guess that meant that Potter's stuff reappeared alongside its owner. How convenient.
, people! House-elves? DOBBY!” The last word was called in a whisper-shout.
Malfoy crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked down his nose at Harry as if he thought him to be the world's biggest imbecile (which was probably not far off in Malfoy's opinion). “Because
Harry chuckled. “Oh, of course we are, silly. All cemeteries are crossroads of life and death. And look,” he pointed at the location, “they're already here to pick me up. It's time for me to go.”
“Shit!” A crowned rider on a flying palomino horse missed Draco by a breath, the rider's legs brushing Draco's upper arm as he shot past.
Draco had never seen anything that looked less like a pig. He shelved that thought. Not important.
Seeming a bit taken aback, Harry's eyes went back to the nondescript cover. “Oh.”
Harry shook his head. “I even picked a pirate flag thinking of you – of this. You don't need to hide it. It's part of you.”
She so wished this would work. She wished to make people happy.
Shout-out to my magnificent beta, umbrellaless22! Thank you for your dedication!
He was cut off as Potter abruptly moved up and basically threw himself at Draco. Bodily. Draco lost his balance and fell backwards, landing on his behind, Potter half on top of him. The latter was now bawling his eyes out, hands tightly fisted into the front of Draco's robes. Wonderful, really

“Yeah,” Granger got up and smoothed down her skirt. “You'll be okay with everything, Malfoy?”
Well, when Harry came back from his runaway day in Windsor Great Park, he told them about Draco, the name. He himself slowly forgot again, but as the name Draco somehow belonged to Harry('s history), the others could still remember on a certain level and when they saw him face to face, the name came to them.
Her friend looked up, just as bewildered. “Huh?” He gazed around. “Didn't I just go in there?” Ron nodded at the portal.
he fell so hard for a bad boy in the beginning, all the million little reasons why he would keep on falling were very obvious to him in this moment, standing in their kitchen.
Malfoy halted abruptly. “Excuse me? Apologise? To a

But did Harry have to rub that knowledge in? Certainly not! Because who cared that Malfoy liked chansons better than pop songs and always ate the red Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans first? Right?

“We've stayed long enough,” elaborated Wolfe. “It's time to make new experiences. When would be better than now, leaving with our friends? The horses will come, too. They made that clear.” Some affirmative neighing was heard from Lightning/Invincible.
Names have power. That is old wisdom. Therefore here a list of names of the protagonists. Most names are rather self-explanatory, I think, but some might not have been so obvious.
“There are hundreds,” affirmed the leader and waved her hand. “First let's have a look at your bruises though. Those look painful."
Snowdrop cocked her head, eyeing first Draco then Harry. She hooted. It sounded like a question.
Then Pansy flung her arms around Draco's neck. “You bastard!” she cried, voice wobbling.
Finally Ada seemed to pity them (or maybe they just were too slow for her) and allowed Draco onto the back of her own horse, so he could hold on to her (something he decidedly did
“What do you mean, 'you let Harry save me now'? I did the saving!”
What his eyes found though, made him inhale sharply and he took an involuntary step back. Impossible.
This wasn't working. He might have been able to make them believe his story about The Hunt but they couldn't even remember Potter long enough to hold a conversation, how could they ever help him? He had to try though.

Draco was helped onto his horse and he felt he would totally ace this – until they sped away and he found himself tumbling down within seconds. Merlin, this was nothing like riding a broom.
“You're an asshole.” Okay. Not exactly the answer Draco had expected. “You always think you are right and that you are better than anyone else. You're a bully and petty and weepy. You have no backbone whatsoever and–”
“You're all awful!” But Harry couldn't suppress a gleeful giggle as he, amazed by the ease with which his owl Snowdrop kept up with his horse Lightning's speed, reached out to caress the former in mid-air. He was awarded with a delighted hoot.
On that matter, I re-set the updating schedule to bi-weekly (for now), since I just currently can't get any decent writing done in one week, what with my social life actually starting to exist again.

curious?”
“We cried and cried and cried, until the new lake was full and we could dive into it and hide and heal our wounds,” she directed a loving smile at Mabel, “and raise our children in peace.”
“Cat got your tongue?” the Irishman joked before suddenly turning stormy-faced. “You're not still thinking you're better than us?!” He thumbed Draco hard in the upper arm. Ouch.
“Tea!” the Weasel interrupted, making weird eye signs at Draco. “I'll make some nice calming tea. How about you all sit down in the living room and er, don't freak out meanwhile, yeah?” He rushed off.
It was nightfall when Draco left for the Patchers' party at Hogwarts, which he would be attending alone, since neither Ronald nor Hermione had ever really gotten into patching after their return from Australia and all those in attendance that were actual Patchers preferred The Burrow over the castle tonight. Draco could understand that. He would have liked to stay longer, but he had some people to meet.
Hullo~
“Yeah,” Pansy nodded, “
“I don't know.” Granger's bushy hair drifted in the wind and she watched the waves come ashore. “Maybe she was whisked over when her mother died and then just went with them. We can't say for sure. I mean, why did they take Paisley? Must be a reason.” She looked at him. “We'll find out, I'm certain of it. And... maybe we need to look into the animal spirits, too?”
Anyway, I think this one might be my new favourite.
His sister however quickly found her wits again and a storm cloud gathered in her face. “How
BraveHeart stared open-mouthed at Harry. “Amazing! That was like so cool! Did you just make that up on the spot, Seeker?”
Harry stared after her, barely noticing that the moment she had left, the noises around him had picked up again and colours had grown brighter once more.
“Fine, have it your way. See if I care.” Harry crossed his arms in front of his chest. He should have listened to himself. He generally gave himself very good advice (though he very seldom followed it).
The cry was answered immediately by the dog next to the group, with a blood-curdling goose noise of its own.
won't work if it's not an actual door.”
“No need. I'll help.” A black-haired someone appeared on Draco's right side. “Hey, Malfoy.”
“It's not!” Seeker gritted his teeth.
“You got Harry a present?” Ronald leapt to his feet and came over to look at the item. “When did you buy that?”
A thought struck him. Maybe not on earth... His gaze wandered upwards and soon found itself entangled in dark storm clouds, hanging low overhead and, while alight with an occasional bolt, gently dropping snowflakes onto Harry's raised face. No, flying in a storm would be crazy. There had to be another way.
Oh fuck. Malfoy would never do that. Harry was so screwed.
“Treacle?” This time, Harry was the echo. He just loved treacle tart, situation aside.
This story is for all the great writers out there that made life more bearable when things were bad this year, especially GallaPlacidia, WouldItWere and Ladderofyears. Thank you!
Now, if you feel particularly generous, how about leaving a comment as a belated Christmas present?
“Interesting.” Half leant onto Harry's shoulder, watching the brothers-in-law laugh and cry at the same time. “What just happened?”
“Er...”
“No, you're just in time. You'll be a captor today.” Seeker raised his voice: “Now, everyone, gather round! We got this. Let's win us a piece of forest. See you at the Pond when it's over!”
“No, she's...” Harry felt a bit helpless. “Malfoy, she is a book character. From a Muggle children's novel. She isn't real.”
Since the chatterbox wasn't all that strong, Harry had a few moments to survey him: He had fair skin, mouse-brown hair and equally brown eyes shining from behind a hand-painted mask that covered the upper half of his face and showed a breathtaking landscape.
mortal danger, unexpected romance, betrayal, confession(s), an escape, fun and games, an arrogant side character, lore, love, heartbreak -  and fairies (of sorts)!

Harry followed suit. 'A way out, a way out, a way out...'. After maybe thirty seconds of silent chanting, he squinted around the room. Nothing had changed. He sighed. “You can stop now, Malfoy. No such luck.”
Perchta! So, it really is her crown! Unbelievable. You are so lucky!” BraveHeart's eyes had become round like the moon and he gawked so unabashedly that Harry felt a blush creeping up his neck. Especially since the others joined in on the rapt ogling. Like he was some sort of carnival attraction; when they themselves were the weirder people here.
“Oh, that's alright. We're all mad here,” offered Alice and petted her March Hare. “I'm mad. You're mad.”
“This is so weird,” whispered Cassius, voicing exactly what Pansy was thinking. “I mean, I know that you're there,” he said to a spot of air, “but it's still strange not to see you and all.”
“Kreacher doesn't know why the Mudblood thinks she can talk to Kreacher freely, Kreacher doesn't know,” the creature whispered loudly.
Draco could feel his cheeks heat up, but he resolutely kept staring at the page in front of him. “Right. Between a whole library, The Burrow, Hogwarts and, I don't know,

His brain malfunctioned.
promise to be good from now on?” Harry simply looked at him and Draco sighed, suffering. “Then I'll come with you. I won't let you go alone again.”
But first things first. He could not forget his nightly ritual he had taken to doing every time  before falling asleep. He wiggled until he lay comfortably and then started the mantra: Harry Potter, green eyes, stupid glasses, black bird's nest, fondness of treacle tart...
At the head of the table, a little girl had appeared out of thin air.
“The press sucks. Best just to ignore them,” Harry said in a low voice.
. Harry Potter? They grabbed him,” he said imploringly.
“You do that.”
What?
Harry let his thoughts float. His gaze flickered back to the beautiful dragon. There was just something about it that made Harry's heart squeeze.
Draco gave up. “Only you have this effect on me.” He pushed himself up and caught Harry's lips for a second, before pulling away which earned him an annoyed groan from the other boy.
“So?” she finally uttered. “What do you suggest we do about this then?”
Harry heard his heart beat, slow and steady. His panic had subsided and left him with goosebumps and a vague feeling of awe. A life had ended in these seconds. Another one had been created. How breathtaking the world was, how cruel, how wonderful.
An unnerving thought. Draco wanted to say 'never' but images of a worn-out, grey-faced Potter during Hogwarts patches came to mind and as much as he tried to laugh at the idea that the Saviour didn't enjoy life, he knew better. “I'm not sure, but... it's not entirely impossible. I think he feels guilty a lot.”
If I'm not replying right away it's because I have a lot on at the moment. But I read them all and they encourage me, so thank you x100!!
“Hm,” hummed Draco. Now probably wasn't the best time to point out that Potter had barely ever spent time with his girlfriend anyway and that this break-up had been inevitable. Also, Draco had seen it coming from miles away. Good riddance, if you asked him.
Up, up they soared, air rushed through Harry's hair and his robes whipped out behind him – and in a rush of fierce joy he realised he'd found something he could do without being taught – this was easy, this was
Drawing apart for air, they stayed entangled.

Something.
Seeker frowned. “That still doesn't explain why Holle's Pond glows for me though.”
Draco huffed. “Sure, that is a fairy tale. Three brothers get three gifts from Death:  the  Cloak of Invisibility that makes you invisible even to Death himself, the Resurrection Stone that can bring back dead people and the Elder Wand that is said to be an invincible wand. Two brothers waste their gifts and die, but one doesn't and bests Death. Correct? But no one in their right mind would believe that things like that truly exist. I mean, except for maybe weirdos like Lovegood who spout nonsense saying that owning all three of the gifts would make you master of Death. Complete cock-and-bull story, that is. As if objects like that could ever be real.”
“In theory, yes,” Death agreed, “but it also works the other way round: Should The Hunt ever catch The Beginning, which is sort of an incarnation of Life, she would be freed and I with her. Theoretically.”
“Get! Off! Me!”
“You remember us alive then?” Ember interrupted Harry's musings.
Draco suddenly felt three pairs of eyes on him. He didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. What was that supposed to mean? Did Potter just insinuate that he had helped with the trial
the best.” She looked thoughtful. “And I think Harry could use some dancing. You look pale. Are you alright?”
That sounded doable. Seeker closed his eyes and tried focusing. He blocked out all distracting thoughts of Draco, Half's betrayal, his own fear and anger and finally, in the very last corner of his mind, he found a tiny glimmer of recognition. When he opened his eyes again, he knew where to go.
“Er, Ember do you also see those random animals in front of the chariot?” Seeker asked the big guy, while rapidly blinking to perceive the zoo better.
It had been bad enough that Draco hadn't been able to suppress his traitorous thoughts of minor infatuation earlier, when he had been holding Potter's hand over the teacup. Like hell he would openly admit to having (shudder) very unimportant, super miniscule, really irrelevant feelings... for Potter. Absolutely not worth mentioning.
He glanced over at Potter, who took this very moment to groan in frustration. “I need a break. Malfoy?”
“Winky,” Lovegood greeted the familiar house-elf friendly. “What do you have there on your belt?”
Yes, they
And Draco wasn't especially keen on a repeat performance.
The effect was almost immediate: His shins stopped hurting, his brain cleared up the fuzziness and his tired muscles ceased aching.
Mabel ignored Draco's answer and launched into an explanation instead: “It's really simple. First, you have to have a race-course, a sort of circle, and then all the party is placed along the course, here and there. Then the race starts when everyone begins swimming at their own pace whenever they like and it ends when everyone leaves off whenever they like. So, it's not always easy to know when the race is over.”
There was no home, there was no happiness
“I, as the younger sister, was so keen on proving myself that I swam right up to the shore, hiding behind a rock in the swell. I was curious. I'd never seen humans so up close.”
Draco stared down onto the broom unfocussed, his breath suddenly too shallow to draw in enough air. Fucking get a grip, Draco!
“Well, it wasn't so dark then, was it?” Potter harrumphed, cutting into Draco's thoughts. “But if this really is the lake then this is our way out – or better
“Right. Let's then.”
Harry ducked quickly into the entry and– nearly toppled over. Behind the door was nothing but a very narrow and very brittle-looking staircase that led steeply into the darkness, the bottom-half indeterminable in the shadows.
Wolfe had quietly started singing again.
Get it? Like, a

I like fleshing out side characters. But mostly, I wanted to give the dead a conclusion and some growth if possible. Ember/Crabbe gets softer and learns caring. BraveHeart/Colin lets go of  his fear (of Death Eaters). Wolfe/Lavender finds love. Half/Fred gets to reconnect to his brother and Snowdrop/Hedwig can say farewell properly.
The girl cocked her head and contemplated that for a moment. “I believe there is or more like, I know there is. See, when Voldemort” (Draco shuddered.) “tried to make himself immortal, he divided his soul to create so-called Horcruxes. That is indeed what we and Pickle did when we were on the run – search and destroy said soul pieces to make V–
It was only then that Harry noticed the old woman was accompanied by a pale palomino. Holle's aura (or whatever one could call it) really had suppressed all her surroundings; even a horse 16 hands high.
“Ah, right, look at this,” Draco quickly diverted, crossing the room to stand next to the shirt thief and ignoring the hot lump in his stomach that had formed when Potter had called him by his given name. “This Invisibility Cloak is yours, isn't it? I've been wondering about that.”
the way he had imagined the L-word conversation to go. Harry chanced a glance at Draco's scarlet face. He caught Harry's eye and reddened even deeper, but he didn't avert his gaze and right there, in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, in utter darkness, in the company of Life and Death and via words spoken by another, they
“I took her down, below the surface, to my home village. I introduced her to my father and told him that she was the one for me.”
Harry nervously looked himself over in the mirror for one last time. He had tried (and failed) to tame his hair and wore new dress robes.
There were thousands of tiny little rhinestones set in the walls and they shed a diffuse sort of dim glow that lit up the round, well-like hole they were

are also echoes of sorts, but like memories or more precisely, the ghost form of the way the owner of the Stone wishes the memories to be. To put it differently: They appear as the wisher wants them to appear, albeit invisible to others. I wonder if they could even be called afterimages at all, since they are copies of ideal images rather than real people and–”
The excited boy flushed scarlet. “Ah, I, er, I mean –
Harry groaned – because of the wording and because of the fact that Tillie's grip had tightened painfully. “I'm no one's dolly! Put me down!”

contributed Anguis who was still dozing at Draco's feet.
Meanwhile Harry was trying to get comfortable with the prospect of spending the night here and did his best to ignore the ever-mounting ache that the trick stair's pressure caused on his ankles. Blasted thing. If only he knew a spell to get out of this mess.
“Treacle?”
It stung only a tiny bit. He already knew those reactions.
Draco's heart pounded in his chest. Could it be? After all this time? “And would you... be willing to help me contact this Sir Patrick?” He held his breath and prayed.
Maybe it wasn't entirely terrible holding Potter like this. Not that Draco would ever say that out loud, although their closeness wasn't that unusual nowadays: After all, since that sunrise at the memorial site in August, Potter's casual touches had been rather frequent. No sense of personal space, that guy. But... they weren't
“No, you just assume.”
“Un! Believable!” Half pried the invite from Seeker's hands and stared at with eyes huge as his sense of humour. “Being asked to attend the moss folk celebrations is like the highest possible honour. Wow mate, they must really like you.”
“Third, technically,” Draco grunted and righted his body again.
“Don't be sad,” Half said comfortingly. “It's all going to be okay.”

as they called themselves). Those were people who came to repair things that had been damaged in The Battle. But he hadn't been the only one. Lots of folk had come to help. Mostly current and former students and parents, but also others. Everyone had worked together to make Hogwarts inhabitable again so that the school could open its doors in September. And with united strength they had managed somehow — only barely though, for Hogwarts' innermost resilience against outward influences was formidable.
