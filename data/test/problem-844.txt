So much for assuming the memory lapse was from head trauma. Harry needed Hermione. No one knew more about Obliviation and memory than her. Hopefully, she’d managed to restore her parents’ memories. If she could do that, cracking Malfoy’s brain should be a snap for her. At long last, Harry began to feel a spark of hope. Hermione could fix anything. Harry just had to make it to next Wednesday and she’d be back to pull him out of this mess.
“Emilia,” Harry tried his most winning smile, “I’m trying to help. I would like nothing more than to hear the truth stated plainly.”
“In turn,” she said, “our establishment ensures absolute safety and a clean, sterile environment for all patrons.”
He nodded his head sharply and moved past Harry. As he did so, there was an awkward shuffle where Harry tried to move back and Malfoy tried to turn to get by, and instead of avoiding contact, Malfoy’s waist brushed across Harry’s hand. The brief touch jolted Harry like lightening, flashing heat through him in a torrential rush. He heard Malfoy inhale sharply as he paused.
In that moment, Draco broke his only rule. He grabbed Potter round the middle and pulled him up to his chest, jerked his head to the side and kissed him, open mouthed and filthy. The new angle made Potter yell louder and Draco snaked his other hand down his chest to find his cock. He jerked it roughly while fucking up into Potter’s tight hole.
Malfoy didn’t move. Neither did Harry. They stared at each other, both silently willing the other to break the silence.
“Yes.” Harry frowned at her. “Hermione, we have magic. Muggles can't do what we do. They just can’t.”
“Dividing the spell patterns let me figure out how the overall design was meant to function. Once I understood the arithmantical approach taken I could further break down the patterns and discern their individual properties.” Malfoy prodded a twitching bit with his finger. “Obviously, the legs are used as transmitters, but the narrowness of the conduits alters the overall sound quality.”
Fleur answered, “zee theory hypothesizes zat, with zee correct combination of matrices, it iz possible to harness ambient magic and store it based on a running algorithm of consumption. Zee Egyptians tried and failed to use a more… primiteeve version of zee theory to keep zair pyramids intact in perpetuity.”
Mouth tightening, Malfoy said, “I want answers. I waited like a good little boy and now you’re going to tell me why the fuck I’m here.”
… he’d felt after agreeing to Narcissa’s terms. Malfoy must have felt the same jolt because Harry saw the same look of open-mouthed shock he knew must be on his own face.
Turning his attention to the letter, Malfoy unsealed it and read the contents. “It’s an invitation,” he said bemusedly.
As Teddy beamed at him, his hair rapidly flashed to black and then back again. Along with practicing to make physical changes on purpose, Teddy was also working on
“I see.” Her tone suggested that she very much did not. Harry was relieved when her gaze moved passed him to the doorway.
Harry threw his hands up. “Oh my God, Malfoy. Shut the fuck up and go drink more tea. If you fall down, I’m not helping you up.”
Lacking a better option, Harry headed for the loos. Even if he didn’t find Mary on his way, he could use a slash.
“I – er,” Harry blinked stupidly at not only his tone, but the glitter dusting his eyelids and his mesh top. Trying to regain a semblance of coherence, Harry said vaguely, “all sorts of things, really.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to let her give you clothes. You don’t have to hide from her.”
“Alright. You,” Harry pointed at Curly, “monitor the perimeter for any surprises. And Taylor, you go ‘round and watch the back exit. If anyone runs, I’ll funnel them toward you. I’ll approach from the front.” Both Aurors nodded and moved out of concealment to do as Harry had instructed.
Harry watched the people around the room closely. They seemed like normal, everyday people relaxing at the end of a workweek. Couples sat closely, gazing at each other happily. Singles lounged casually, watching the room, probably hoping to pull. Every so often, the back doors opened to let people enter or exit. Harry assumed one of the doors led to a bathroom. A small line waited outside it and no one stayed inside longer than a few minutes.
Taking a deep breath, he stood up. A Horcrux was still missing and he didn't know what it was. Nothing more could be done.
He went over to the woman, and left Harry to finish his food with the feel of Draco's fingers still under his hands.
There were sighs, and Draco deemed necessary show himself also. He opened his pants, and his dick popped out completely hard. There were more sighs when he positioned his cock between Potter's ass-cheeks.
He put his cock inside his pants again, and saw Potter slide against the wall until he was sitting on the cold floor, his skirt pushed and tucked into the waistband, showing off his abused ass.
Draco fucked into his mouth with force, didn't even let him breathe right. Then he turned to the voyeurs.
Harry had no idea where he had been, but he was coming back. He opened his eyes, looked around. Draco was dueling with Voldemort, and everyone was standing without speaking or doing anything.
This Saturday, Hogwarts would be taken. Draco had spent the week planning, and his time was running through his fingers. He didn't know if he would be able to complete the mission, but for Harry... He would have to try.
Potter's body was limp against him, only little twitches of the orgasm making him move. His insides were still milking Draco, coaxing him to another hard-on.
The children of the Death Eaters were going back to school, but only to avoid suspicion, and he had his trunk ready, eagerly waiting for his mother to come and get him. It was already 8:30, and she still hadn't shown up.
"Crazy. Dumbledore is still looking for you. Black was nearly arrested twice for breaking into Death Eaters' houses. Hogwarts will be opened again in two weeks.", With a sigh, the blonde threw his head back. "And I am to take the Dark Mark as soon as the Dark Lord conquers Hogwarts and kill Dumbledore."
The next two weeks went by excruciatingly slow for Draco. He had been locked in the room, only his mother and Bellatrix could see him.
Harry didn't know it was possible to feel sick when he Apparates inside an iron coffin. But then again, he thought that no one was ever transported in an iron coffin and survived to tell the story.
Potter may have lost his words, as he just nodded again. Draco finally sealed his lips in a chaste kiss. Then he started kissing her eyes, cheeks, forehead, nose, until Potter was laughing softly. He climbed on top of the brunette, who put his legs around his hips, and continuing his shower of kisses, went down to Potter's neck. There, feeling more instigated, he left a hickey that would leave a beautiful purple mark. Then he went lower and lower, reaching Potter's nipples, and sucking, licking and nibbling, feeling the brunette's hands get caught in his hair and his body arch.
"I wouldn't call you anything else. Potter.", They kissed again, rolling over the bed and messing up the blankets. Draco started to bite and suck on Harry's neck before going down his tanned body. Harry's fingers flew to the blond strands as soon as he was aligned with his dick.
As if reading his thoughts, the door opened, and Narcissa stopped under the door frame. Her rigid posture and the small frown on her forehead were the only signs that something was not right.
And finally, FINALLY, their lips met in a kiss, which was applauded by everyone inside the infirmary. Harry laughed and pulled Draco on top of him.
"Potter, I can not control what will happen but I can have something to say about how.", He looked at the brunette, who slid down the bars to the floor. Then he turned to the wizard next to him. "I accept. But I will need time."
"Oh, I am. If Sirius is arrested, I will certainly go crazy. But Dumbledore? He may very well die and throw himself from the top of the Astronomy Tower, see if I care.", Draco's laugh was most welcome in the dead silence of the dungeon.
"Killing our schoolmates. So what if they don't have pure blood? They will bleed red in the same way. And it is not possible that there is not an ounce of empathy in you to do this."
With half a thought, Harry removed the magic cock ring, leaving the blonde free of the only thing that kept him from reaching the limit. He sat down just one more time, and while his hole filled with cum until Draco was almost dry, he also came. Long lines of cum flew, hitting Draco in the face and chest.
Draco held the Diadem. The legend said that he would give wisdom to whoever used it, but with a piece of the Dark Lord's soul in it... he had tried everything. He had stepped on the jewel, cast all the destructive spells he knew. Nothing had worked.
Harry just moaned, and Draco kissed his forehead before straightening himself and leaving the alcove.
"Pathetic. Simply pathetic. Do you Death Eaters think you are bringing some pride to your names by allowing a lunatic to command you in this way? Look at the pompous and proud Lord Malfoy lying at the foot of something that cannot even be called a man. Like trash. Like shit."
They were both sweaty, their bodies hot and dirty. When Draco slipped out, Harry shivered with the amount of semen coming out of him.
"I know you don't want to die, Harry.", The words that Harry cried in the blonde's arms came back to him. "You said you weren't going to give up."
"Given by the Dark Lord, who also ordered me to bring the food to the prisoner. Or do you want to go check with the Lord?", Draco knew very well how to use the situation in his favor. The brunette snorted a laugh, imagining the guard's face.
"Draco! What are you doing? Get out of there!", Harry should be happy for the cell to cancel any kind of spell? Because Bellatrix's eyes were betraying an enormous desire to send a Crucio towards Harry. Draco shot him one last look, his face expressionless, but Harry could read him.
"I came to bring food to the prisoner.", Junior, then. Harry sat against the cold stone wall and rested his forehead on the rail. Draco wouldn't be able to pass, not after the last time he went down and got caught.
"Draco. I came here for this. I just... I appreciate you taking care of me yesterday. It was more than I expected…"
"A very interesting and efficient little trick, don't you think?", Potter spoke, while removing his pants, and released his cock, red and with veins jumping such excitement.
Following those instincts, he went around the mansion. There was a smell… no, it was not a smell in itself. It was a magic trail. A trail that made his nerves go wild, a shiver down his spine and his dick getting hard against the jeans fabric of his pants.
There was a pause. But Harry, Ron and Hermione stood up applauding, whistling and raising a wave of new applause.
"So big, Draco…", Potter moaned into his neck, breath shallow and hot. And Draco knew it wasn't only a compliment in the heat of the moment. He was way bigger than average, and it was, sometimes, a pain in the ass, pun not intended.
"Good then. I'll do it, but if someone ask…", Severus raised his own wand, and the director opened his eyes a little. "You should have protected them better. AVADA KEDRAVA!"
"Can you explain to me how, even with Dumbledore dead, we are losing?", Draco had done it? He made a sound in the back of his throat.
In one of these, the member touched that exact spot that caused shocks throughout his nervous system. Despite having found his prostate with his fingers, having a dick stretching his entrance at the same time, made it seem as if he had taken a Crucio, where instead of pain, pleasure spread to the smallest nerve cell. For a few more times, he did just that, his eyes rolling and closing in front of such pleasure.
Suddenly, Potter lifted his legs from the blonde's shoulders, pulled himself on top of him and with a fluid movement he returned to Draco's lap, wiggling his ass. Their lips touched, and when a moan came out their teeth collided, and Draco just wanted to throw Potter on the bed and fuck him until the sun came up. But the brunette didn't seem inclined to let him do whatever he wanted, at least not now. He pulled away, and put his ass, still wet from the rimming, right in Draco's line of sight.
"Well, there weren't many clothing options in the dungeon.", The smile on the other's face didn't stop Draco's heart from squeezing.
"I'm proud of you. And we will be able to have a wing just for us in Grimmauld after the renovations."
He listened carefully to the steps, and he almost lost Potter because the git now was WEARING HILLS.
Draco ran off. How… how would he know where to look? Hogwarts was still huge, and he only had a few hours.
Harry was in the dungeons of the Malfoy mansion. He had been dropped there, and that, if his accounts were right, was two months ago. He didn't understand why the fuck Voldemort didn't go down there and finish the job at once, but at least he couldn't complain about the "comforts" of the dungeon.
"It wasn't like that. I didn't want to…", He closed his eyes, his head was hurting and he felt like crying.
"HARRY! How could you?", But he was laughing, even when he sat down. "I think McGonagall is doing very well in the position of headmistress, isn't she?"
"Please talk to me…", He sat down, listening to the sobs, not really knowing what to do. The hug he received was surprising.
The Gryffindor wiggled his ass until it was aligned with Draco's cock, and giggled (GIGGLED) when he felt it already hard.
He moaned and begged and whimpered, too sensitive but not wanting to stop, they were so close, so so close…
"Thanks.", Draco hugged her, feeling like crying. Harry would not live, but if their friends could, to continue the fight on his behalf...
"Nuh-huh. Shut up.", He blew on the dick in front of him, watching the barely visible hairs on Draco's legs stand on end and the muscles in his thighs spasm. "So big… ah, your dick is going to tear me in half, Draco. Is it as tasty as it looks? What if I…?"
"Please don't give up now.", Draco pleaded, while extending his own pajama top for the brunette to wear.
"Please, you need to take them all to a safe place. He would never... I would never forgive myself."
Harry looked around, and saw Hermione arrive at the infirmary. She obviously went to Ron's side first, hugging him and apologizing for not being there. Then she looked at Draco, and Harry got ready. He hadn't seen Ron's reaction, but since there hadn't had any screams or (more) violence, he relaxed. Now with her attention on both of them... she approached.
In frustration, he pointed his wand at it. The fire in his veins guided the words, the Fiendfyre spell coming out of his lips, the uncontrollable flames making him run for the exit. A huge flaming face chased him but he managed to close the room door before he was hit, his clothes still smoking as he dropped to the floor.
"Draco, no!", Harry was clinging to the railings, one hand outstretched as if he wanted to reach him. "It's not worth it."
Malfoy gave him an offended look. “Just for that, I get to be the Falcons. Prepare to face utter defeat.”
Mark was watching the space Malfoy had disappeared into with a grin. “Trouble can make life interesting.”
The walk through Gringotts was almost the same but with their roles reversed. Harry’s back felt itchy from all the dirty looks the goblins gave it. He tried to appear aloof and carefree, but Malfoy’s small smile indicated that he wasn't successful.
George went to the fireplace and Harry followed him over. “If he does anything stupid, I’ll hold the knives while Ginny and Hermione take turns skinning him alive.” He took a pinch of Floo Powder. “Bill and Fleur are taking Victoire over to Mum’s tomorrow afternoon. You should stop by. Mum hasn’t seen you in ages.”
“What? No, it’s just… Gringotts. They’re still pretty angry about the whole,” Harry gestured vaguely, “you know, stealing their dragon thing.”
to the Aurors,” she snarled viciously as she headed for the door. “I will see you in three days.” The door closed behind her.
Malfoy leaned down and whispered into Harry’s ear, “I want you to make noise for me. I want to hear your skin slapping against my arse while you bury your cock in me. I’m so open and wet right now. I want you to moan my name when you come deep inside me,” he licked Harry’s neck, “
Harry felt himself coloring and was relieved when Malfoy closed his eyes. The relief was short lived however, because Malfoy tilted his head back to rest on the man’s shoulder and covered the woman’s hands with his own. He slid them slowly down his chest, over his abdomen, and to his thighs. The woman’s body lowered with her hands and put her face right at crotch level. From Harry’s vantage point, it looked like Malfoy was using the man for support while he fucked the woman’s mouth.
“Ah, Miss is here. Again.” Kreacher reentered the kitchen with a scowl, pretending he hadn't been the one to slam the nearest cupboard.
Harry’s last shred of professionalism and restraint vanished. He picked Malfoy up, spun them around and slammed him onto a computer desk. Screens, towers and keyboards were shoved aside as Harry touched all the places Malfoy had caressed while he watched. He brought his mouth crashing down on Malfoy’s messily and tasted just a hint of the come he’d licked off his hand.
“You grew up muggle, right? Their technology is all over this one and I need someone who’s familiar with ekricity.” Robards pushed the file at Harry and ordered, “get over there and figure out if this is a real case. Misuse was vague on the details. I’ll expect a report when you get back.”
Harry looked back toward the kitchen and saw Bill quietly leaning against the wall in a spot that would have afforded him a perfect view of the silent altercation that had just happened. The oldest Weasley brother was considering him with a thoughtful expression. Harry gave him a shrug and stepped into the Floo.
Taking it, Harry read the short note. “It’s George. He’s coming in,” he glanced at the clock on the mantle, “well, any time now, actually.”
Harry found himself standing alone. He glanced around and saw that a few people were still staring at him. A couple of them wore speculative looks and Harry fought the urge to pat his hair again.
Harry thought about Eustace too. The daft old bird was apparently the eighth in a long line of daft old birds. Emilia must have been alone a long time now. It made Harry a bit sad to know the origin of the parrot’s name. In the quiet of his mind, Harry could admit he saw a few parallels to her story about Eustace and Malfoy. Annoying, back-talking, and causing unending trouble, indeed.
A mischievous idea formed in Harry’s mind. Hermione had been pretty rough on him, but Malfoy’d tried to get in a few shots of his own. And Harry wasn’t going to
Harry was back the next night. The Leather Petal was filled with people clustered around little tables, leaning against the bar, and lounging in the soft looking chairs. The music was just loud enough to obscure any conversation more than an arm’s length away.
“I’m pretty sure it does include making sure you don’t die because you’re too stupid to listen to me!”
“It is of no concern to you, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa said dismissively. “Draco will remain here until I find his attackers.”
Draco immediately followed. His vision went black and every nerve in his body seemed to fire at once.
Harry stared after the elf for a long moment. He was not upset. He shook his head and took a sip of tea. Not yet ready to face Malfoy again, he drank very slowly.
Malfoy heaved an exasperated sigh. “Merlin’s balls, Potter. There are six living Weasley siblings. I’d rather not have the whole fucking horde accost me because of a lack of specifics.”
It was a relief to leave the main thoroughfare and move onto a side street. Harry followed Malfoy into a toy shop he’d never been into before and immediately mourned the loss of a childhood that could have been. Everything was brightly packaged and cheery. Stuffed animals cavorted in a pen, a train set chugged through the air overhead, and a display of action figures strutted around impressively, striking the occasional heroic pose.
Harry straightened from where he’d been trying to disappear into his chair. “Yes, sir,” he smirked back.
Harry was still mentally going over why this was such a bad idea when he heard himself say, “fine. Three days.”
Kreacher popped back in with an armload of supplies and several hovering potion vials. “I is healing the young master and cleaning away the blood. Kreacher is knowing how to mend wounds and will stop the hurt.”
If Harry hadn’t been watching them, they might have been the ones to go after Malfoy. It bothered him that he hadn’t smelled even a whiff of anyone new or anything related to the Malfoys.
“I can’t, “Malfoy repeated. In a rush he said, “we accidently triggered my Life Debt to Potter. I have to stay with him until we know who attacked me.”
Draco moved behind him and poured more lube over his hole and onto his prick. He pushed two fingers inside Potter's arse easily. So wet. So ready.
Harry was slack-jawed and rock hard. That was the hottest thing he’d ever witnessed. And, he realized abruptly, he’d witnessed it on company time. Awkwardly, he cleared his throat and croaked, “I – that – as a –”
“Hello, Victoire.” He scooped her up and gave her a toss into the air. “How is the most beautiful princess in the world today?”
This was a bad idea. He had no idea what was on the other side of that door. He was supposed to look around, see what he could see, and leave. This was a disaster in the making.
Harry reached out and took the quill. Without letting himself hesitate, he scratched a line across the parchment. Harry braced for the worst.
Turning, and definitely not thinking about arses, Harry saw that Malfoy still sported Harvey’s face and hair. Harry tried to surreptitiously indicate to Malfoy that the disguise was still in place. All he got for his trouble was an expression of sneering confusion. Giving up subtlety, Harry pointed at his own hair and then to Malfoy’s.
It was totally normal. He was just wound up from last night. Mary really had been coming on to him pretty strongly, right? And when was the last time he'd been alone with Ginny? He just needed to get some release. That was all. It had nothing to do with Malfoy himself. So he had a nice arse? Plenty of people had nice arses.
“Good boy,” Draco mouthed against his perineum right before he latched his mouth over Potter’s hole and licked wetly.
Curly kept talking but his voice faded to an annoying buzz as Harry stopped listening and got a good look at the woman. The first thing he noticed were the angry red marks circling her wrists. It looked like rope burns. Her face was pale and damp, and it made the bruising on her neck stand out starkly. Harry’s vision was narrowing down to a red tunnel as her eyes fluttered just the slightest bit open and she smiled a hazy, dreamy smile at him.
Harry could hear the quotation marks in the way Malfoy said 'fun'. "Why are you saying it like that? You're being weird."
While Potter eagerly dragged his trousers down his hips, Draco removed his shirt. Once fully naked, he let Potter look for a long moment. Smirking at the hungry expression he saw, Draco sauntered forward with an exaggerated sway.
Just before Harry turned to be on his way, Robards cleared his throat and continued, “no rushing into burning buildings this time.”
They spent the next hour in near silence working on the puzzle together. Occasionally, Malfoy would pause to flick a bubble at a tiny quidditch player that flew too close. Otherwise, his focus was almost absolute. Long, thin fingers would pick up a puzzle piece and sharp eyes would scrutinize it as it shifted through a sequence of shapes. Then, he would scan the remaining pieces until finding the one he wanted. Each time this happened, Malfoy would smile as he clicked them together.
Everything went still, and two sets of eyes widened and stared at Harry in incredulous surprise. Harry shrugged, happy to have moved on. “I keep tabs on a few people. Seemed the best way to get information.”
Harry got an arched eyebrow in return. “Potter,” Malfoy said, “I’m taller than you and your clothes are too big for
Malfoy curled his lip and drawled, “Weasley, how nice to see you. I’m sure this wasn’t what you were expecting, but –” He cut off with a barely stifled grunt as Ginny zapped him with a Stinging Hex.
The other door, though… Harry wasn’t sure where that led. He would have ventured over to take a look, but he noticed that no one ever seemed to go in alone. And wasn’t that odd? Sometimes it was two people, sometimes more. Never a large group and never a person by themselves. Harry continued to watch.
Potter swiftly obeyed and Draco took his time walking over and sitting down. When Potter was fully nude and on his knees again, Draco let his eyes wander. “Lean back on your hands so I can look at you properly.”
With a laugh, she said, “well, what George actually said was that bugs couldn’t be the only things stuck in you. I don’t know why you’d have bugs in you, but he made it pretty clear that something large was up your arse. I thought I’d come over to help you relax.” Her eyes smoldered.
The woman was holding her stick again. She ran it’s end up Malfoy’s leg, knee to hip. Slowly she trailed it around his backside and down his other leg. Other than a slight tremble, Malfoy held perfectly still. With almost casual indifference, she slapped it against his arse, once, twice. Still, Malfoy didn’t move, didn’t open his eyes.
She licked the side of his neck as she viciously gripped a nipple. Malfoy sucked in a shuttering breath as she twisted sharply.
me?” Malfoy’s squawked indignation would have been funnier if Harry hadn’t been so busy wishing the floor would swallow him. In hindsight, the pub had been a bad, not to mention useless, idea.
George glanced up. “Don’t get cocky, your arithmancy doesn’t address the defects Harry encountered at all. I still haven’t found what could cause the defaults to fail.”
Harry thought Roberts would try to backpedal, try make himself sound less possessive. Jealous men didn’t like having their possessiveness pointed out.
him, but I don’t hate him either.” Harry contemplated the floor. “I think he almost died yesterday. The War is over. No one should be dying.”
“I cannot believe you dragged me here, Potter. This is not what I had in mind. What the fuck is this place?”
“Well, this is going to be a horrible few days. Irate women popping in unannounced whenever they please and expecting me to take any potion they happen to have. Wouldn’t have presumed otherwise, really. They
He splashed his face with cold water and reminded himself that he was Harry fucking Potter, Voldemort vanquisher, Master of the Elder Wand, and not a slave to schoolboy rivalries. He squared his shoulders and strode out of the bathroom.
That had been just one moment during that year. At the time, Harry had been too consumed by the horcrux hunt and running to really think about the students at Hogwarts beyond wistfully imagining the tables full of food in the Great Hall. In the intervening years, he’d been too wrapped up in everything else and trying to just move on from that terrifying year.
Harry stepped between the fireplace and the table, hoping to cut their line of sight and prevent George from seeing his dismantled prototype. Having Malfoy almost die again would probably go against the terms of the Debts.
“Cool! Victorie says he’s a veela! And that you’re his best mate. But I said Uncle Ron is your best mate and
Harry was just as good at interrogation as he was at fieldwork. It was probably the only reason Robards had agreed to let him in the room. There was an art to asking questions. You had to mix in what you
“It’s good to see you, Emilia.” Harry ducked as a blur of green feathers barreled toward his head. “You too, Eustace.”
Harry sat at his desk and put his head in his hands. His pulse began to slow and rational thought resumed. He shouldn’t have jumped at Malfoy like that. He'd always had a knack for saying things that would set Harry off but he couldn't have known how badly Harry would respond to that particular charge. Harry himself was surprised at how strongly he'd reacted. Malfoy had just been being a prat. A prat that had been on Death’s doorstep yesterday. He was glad Kreacher had intervened when he did.
Harry felt Malfoy’s grip on his wrist tighten and his other hand landed on Harry’s hip. “Stop thinking,” he said again. “Just move. It’s like flying.”
Harry watched Robards stalk away with dismay. Flicking the file open, Harry looked down at a photograph of Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy looked up at her with wide, surprised eyes. “She was trying to kill your daughter at the time. So. Understandable, really.”
Eyebrows climbing, Malfoy looked around the room and spread his arms, indicating the jumble of books and parchment strewn over the table and floor. He looked back to Harry and said, “and you unintentionally levitated my tea without a wand or an incantation.”
“Well,” Curly said, “Taylor here thinks I’m being paranoid, but I just got a hunch, you know? Something feels off.”
“Gross.” George wrinkled his nose at his oldest brother. To Harry, he said, “that’s fucking brilliant.”
Wand arm shaking, Ginny fired hexes at the other two Third Years in rapid succession. Both fell to the floor clutching their noses and blood leaked through their fingers.
The day Hogwarts classes were to be back, he certainly didn't want to go. Not when he knew what was going to happen.
"If I explain to you, will you shut up and eat me up at once?", The blonde didn't comment, just nodded. "Dumbledore said I have to die. It's the only way to end this shit. There is a prophecy, and I know that if you tell your father early in the morning he will be so happy that he might end up saying that he loves you. Now, can you please take off all these clothes? What kind of person sleeps in silk pajamas?"
Draco let his forehead touch the other's, his eyes closing in the meantime. A sniffle lifted him out of the post-orgasm cloud.
He went up to the dorms, Pansy and Blaise behind him. When the bedroom door closed, Draco took a deep breath, feeling his throat burn with screams.
Draco bit back a moan, then clasped Potter's waist and grinded his ass down against his cock again. The room was silent, and Draco took off Potter's underwear, gripping his ass and opening him to the crowd of voyeurs.
The forces of Hogwarts (he refused to call them the forces of light) had been filled by some adults, several of whom Draco did not know. But there was a man, crazy, casting spells all over the place. Sirius Black.
"Oh, Draco…", He would give anything for people to stop saying his name that way. He didn't need their pity, he needed that ... that ...
"Malfoy.", Draco looked at the boy bouncing on him, his red face and glazed eyes and pink lips. "Truth or dare?"
"Hmmmm, want to keep your cock inside me forever.", The little confession was followed by Draco turning him to face the crowd, that again stopped the game to watch the show.
Harry's stomach rumbled, announcing that the food was coming soon. He waited for the steps, and when he heard them...
Her apprehensive face fell away, and she just nodded. It wasn't an excuse on Draco's part and it wasn't an acceptance on her part, but they reached consensus.
The game resumed, and they both had to answer some truths, no one wanting to break the show for a dare. When Harry was finally ready again, he just launched himself to the floor, his ass full of Draco's cock, and started to rock against him. He moaned loudly, not caring if he looked like a cheap whore, Draco's cock was too good to not have inside him.
Dumbledore stayed every other day at school, still looking for Harry. Draco would tell him where the brunette was, but besides making sure that it only served to move things faster, he knew that it wasn't just Harry who was at risk.
As if programmed, Harry's knees failed, but Draco held him. Wrapping his arms around the brunette to pick him up like a bride, Draco turned his back on the Lord.
"Yes.", The redness in Weasel's and Granger's face was worth it. The game kept on going, even if they were more focused on Draco and Potter. Soon, Potter started to move again, his hips doing circles with Draco's cock still inside.
"I trust you.", Draco never thought he would feel so desperate to see Harry walking towards his certain death. One last kiss stole words from him, and the door was opened again, and Harry was taken from him. Draco tried to reach the brunette's heat again, but his father's firm hands on his shoulder stopped him. He didn't take his eyes off Harry until he was completely taken out of his sight.
"Ah, it's not surprising considering the amount of time you spent thinking about him, drawing his attention from the other side of the Dining Room and looking at his ass during Quidditch."
Yes, because they knew each other in their own way, because Draco had changed his worldview so drastically, because he couldn't imagine his life without that equal opponent, that person who returned everything he gave and demanded in equal intensity.
Harry licked it, experiencing the salty taste of pre-come. The taste itself was not exactly good, but the fact that he just ran his tongue so dirty and sensual on someone's dick… he groaned, before taking the head between his lips, sucking and letting his jaw open to accommodate all that size.
Harry had been moved, placed in an iron coffin and chained. It would prevent him from doing magic, according to the Death Eaters. He waited, his ears intent on the outside noise. Nothing but whispers.
Then he remembered Harry talking about the room where that Dumbledore Army had trained in. How it could give someone what they need most. It was a very small chance, but ...
"You can taste it, but I'm going to fuck your mouth, slut. Cheap whores like you don't get to suck dick when their mouth is made for fucking."
"I'm glad you realize how wrong that way of thinking is, but it doesn't change the fact that for the past five years you have been hell in my life."
Several students were already ready for the fight, some dressed in all the clothes of the Death Eaters. It turned his stomach.
The third-years and bellow joined the Muggle-borns. Granger seemed to think in such an intense way that Draco he almost saw the gears in her head spin. Suddenly her eyes widened.
It wasn't long until he was again spilling himself, this time for the rest of the room to watch. He then rest himself against Draco's torso and breathing hard, turned to the blond and kissed him.
"Draco?", Harry was neither shocked nor surprised, but the pride he had in his eyes made Draco blush.
Perhaps he was not quiet enough to close the door, because when he got close to the bed a wand was pointed at his forehead.
It didn't take Harry long to realize that the hands that covered his eyes as soon as dinner appeared were Draco's.
It probably stank, but it wasn't the physical scent Harry could smell. It was that magical feeling, the one that used to make him feel hotness in his core, but that now squeezed his heart and filled his belly with butterflies.
"Luna, listen carefully: you need to notify all Houses. The Dark Lord will invade the castle tomorrow morning, and all Muggle-borns will be in danger."
"I suppose you came here with my end in mind.", Draco didn't answer. How could he? "Anyway, I just want to point out that I don't believe you are a murderer."
"I… yes, Daddy.", Potter looked so pretty, submitting easily like that. He was really a needy thing.
He finally arrived in the room where the trail ended. He took a deep breath. And he opened the door.
Skin against skin, the lube spell creating a pool of wetness below Potter, Draco fucked him until he felt the tell signs of his orgasm. His rhythm faltered, and he came deep inside Potter, who let out a mewl sound, clenching around Draco like he was coming too.
"It's not like you don't like the thrill of being almost caught.", Harry whispered in the blond's ear, his hand running up his legs and his eyes following the shiver that followed.
If he was in the rain (literally, the sky seemed to fall on his shoulders and the lightening seemed to chase him), he might as well get wet. If he was going to die, he could also put all those wishes and dreams into action.
When the giants and werewolves arrived, Draco felt himself freeze. But the house-elves (was that the old Black elf guiding them?) and the centaurs balanced the fight.
"Get up, Potter.", The brunette staggered but got up. Before Draco could do anything, the jet of green light came out of Voldemort's wand.
"Draco!", She ran towards him, and Granger tried to pull her arm, but failed. The blond hugged Draco.
"Trying to convince me not to do that when there are so many things bigger than your life at stake is not going to free you."
"I know. I know.", He let the other hug him, until he fell asleep and Draco could put him close to him, hoping for any greater force to keep them safe and alive.
"Never.", Draco almost choked on his own spit. Potter came his way, crawling until he was at his face. His eyes were shining and Draco gulped. In less than a minute, Potter had his pants out of his body, only his Muggle underwear covering his dick, and Draco had a lapful of Potter.
Draco froze, but followed his mother into the dining room. The Lord was seated at the head of the table, the place where Draco's father had sat, and the rightful place that Draco would one day sit. But not with that crazy man in power.
Malfoy recovered first, saying, “congratulations, Potter, you are now fulfilling two Debts for the price of one,” his voice became acidic, “because,
“Okay,” Harry said slowly, “let’s not teach that to Teddy. Ever. Maybe you could, I dunno, get him some Gobstones?”
“Oh, I thought about it. If he hadn’t had this schematic drawn up, I’d have turned him into a ferret again for fucking with my product.” His grin was vicious.
Harry frowned in concentration as he tried to remember. An image of Mrs. Malfoy looking fierce and powerful emerged in his mind.
The other two Aurors were finally able to pull Harry back and out of the room. Both were shouting at him and Robards was there looking at Harry with consternation.
“So fucking hot,” Harry panted. “You’re so good at taking cock. Your wet hole feels so good around my prick.”
He rinsed as quickly as he could and leaped out of the shower. Naked, wet, and freezing, Harry reached for a towel.
Draco waited in a corner where he knew Potter would be walking by alone. Don't ask how he learnt where and when he walked alone.
Potter's head was thrown back, eyes screwed shut, and Draco would worry if the brunette didn't immediately started riding him.
"Treason?", Draco felt taken by the same fury that made him put Fiendfyre in the Diadem. He turned to the other students, who were now paying attention to him. "None of you had to spend the summer locked at home with a maniac! None of you saw ... HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE PURE BLOOD CAUSE! HE ONLY CARES ABOUT POWER AND KILLING! How many of your parents didn’t come back late at night hurt after hours of torture? He doesn't even care who serves him, they are all the same for him: insects that he can crush whenever he wants. And I'm not going to let the name Malfoy go to waste because of it. Regardless of which side wins, that's what we're going to be! PAWNS ON ONE SIDE AND PARIAHS ON THE OTHER! AND I'M TIRED OF BEING MANHANDLED THIS WAY!
He stood up, supporting his weight on his knees, until he had only the head of Draco's cock inside him, sitting hard against the blonde.
"Yes. And no. There are ways to destroy them. As you know, I am a double agent. But not for the Dark Lord."
He snorted. What kind of mansion has a dungeon? And even more one with a bathroom, even if in the open, a good mattress and a table?
He had left the Ministry straight to Hogwarts, and from Hogwarts straight to... He had no idea where he was. He just asked any force to take him away. And now he was facing a tall iron gate, magic crackling from all layers of protection spread across the vast territory. The letter M in a fancy font in the middle of the gate, however, gave an idea of where he was.
"No, Severus. Your failures have reached their limit.", The silence that followed was only cut by the cry that Snape had let out. After a few seconds, Harry heard footsteps and a slide.
"Harry…", The brunette reached for the bars, touching Draco's hand still on the tray. His stomach rumbled again.
With a little more movement, he felt Potter's cock against his thigh. Sighing, he went to the brunette's ear.
-"Shhhh…", Draco wiped away the tears, kissing the wet cheeks and coming out of him. "Did I hurt you?"
Draco exchanged a look with his mother, but followed the Lord through the corridors. Halfway there, he already knew they were going to the dungeons. The door opened, and Draco felt a relief run through his veins when he saw Harry still physically well.
The battle was completely on the ground at Hogwarts now, spells flying through the air. Draco felt his racing heart flutter when he saw Slytherins side by side with Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.
He let a shaky breath come out of him, the thought guiding his actions when one hand released the fingers of the other and found its place in the full hips. Harry's other hand went to his shoulder, his eyes never leaving, even when they crossed the line a second time.
For what seemed like the hundredth time, Harry prayed for any higher being to keep everyone, but mostly Draco, safe.
Draco placed his fingers in the already red and loose opening, still feeling some of his semen running out. He stimulated his lover, leaving him at the limit of pleasure, and before the brunette reached ecstasy, he moved away, aligning his member with the other's entrance.
All of this, of course, were the only interesting things that happened. Draco almost zoned out for a while, until he heard Pansy saying Potter's name.
"Then get on with it.", With one last smirk, Potter murmured a spell and his eyes went to the back of his head. Draco curiously threaded his fingers to the creack of the others ass and felt it slicked with lube. He got two fingers in easily, the hole magically stretched making a wet sound and oozing more lube.
The blonde backed off. Potter was panting, his cock giving little spasms of pleasure, his eyes unfocused. But not enough for Draco. He lowered his mouth over him, but now wetting his balls until the saliva that came out of his mouth fell on the mattress and spread across Potter's ass. He withdrew again, listening to the other's growl of despair. He laughed. Kneeling on the bed, and pulling the brunette's hips until he was almost bent in half, and placed his legs above his shoulders. His hole was wet with saliva, pulsing with the urge to be filled by something. And Draco knew exactly what to do.
"Let him catch his breath a little. Weasel, truth or dare?", Draco said, taking a strand of black hair glued to Potter's head off his eyes.
Draco sobbed, but Harry was more focused on getting ready. He fucked himself with his finger a few more times, then added another one and started to open himself. Light burning was easily ignored in favor of the pleasure it was to finally feel something inside him.
"Draco. I need you to pay attention.", The blonde stood up, still with his head down. "Have you heard about Horcruxes?"
"Suck.", And Hardy sucked. He cat licked the rest of the cum and had the length inside his mouth, but not the full thing. Then Draco forced him some more, his cock starting to fill again, reaching the back of Harry's mouth. He gagged, eyes burning. There were tears falling in his face, but his eyes were still turned to the back of his head.
"Silence, bitch. My proposal is... If you kill Dumbledore, the bitch will not die slowly as I have planned. If you are successful, he will only die for the spell that should have killed you years ago. Painless."
"Shhhh. I just need you to spend tonight with me, and tomorrow... tomorrow you can do whatever you want. Take me to your father, or hand me over to your Lord at once. Merlin knows that your family is going to need it after tonight's fiasco."
"Draco. Even if I escape, it will only postpone the inevitable.", That's what he said to himself, every day he went to sleep and he still hadn't died. Postpone the inevitable.
When they separated, breath short and labored, Malfoy put an arm around Harry's waist and turned him over on the bed. His lips went to the brunette's neck, biting and sucking and kissing, and making Harry sigh loudly. Then the blonde backed off.
"Shhhhhh.", Harry was startled by the hoarse voice that came out. "You don't worry, okay? I'm fine."
"Hm. Two months and three weeks ago when I left Hogwarts to clear my head, I ended up Apparating to Malfoy Mansion. Things happened, we… um, we talked and I spent the night there. Anyway, it doesn't matter.", Harry's nervous laugh made Granger look suspicious at them, and Draco hoped his face wasn't as red as he felt he was. Her understanding look said that his plea had been in vain. "Do you know where Sirius is?"
Pansy and Blaise were with them, talking to Draco about the subjects they were going to take this year. Luna and Ginny were talking animatedly to Neville and his Hufflepuff girlfriend Hannah Abbot. Ron, Hermione and Harry discussed the renovations that were going to be done at the old Black house, and everything was fine.
Potter did exactly that, and Draco got behind him, sliding his knickers to the side to meet his hole already filled with a plug. He didn't say anything, losing his patience with just the thought of Potter wearing this all day.
His eyes searched the other's face for something, but he just found innocence, fear, hope and another feeling that he didn't dare name at that moment. His hands caressed the other's cheek as he buried himself inside Potter.
The bed was in the middle of the room, and the moonlight would probably have looked beautiful against the blond hair spread over the black silk sheets. Harry released his breath and walked over to the bed.
A few hours had passed, Harry was in the infirmary and Draco by his side, taking care of the brunette as he could. The hospital wing was full, but Madame Pomfrey was concerned about the effects that receiving a second Avada Kedrava had had on Harry's body.
"Hurry, Harry! You have to go now, or they will ... they will.", But Harry was already dressed, just missing the T-shirt, and Draco didn't know what to say when he saw the sad smile he showed.
"You've been a very obedient puppy, Draco. One day I'll still put a collar on you, and make you walk on all fours in front of everyone. What do you think?", The pleading sound that came out of Draco's throat could not be completely classified as a moan or a cry. But the tears were there, now streaming down his face. Ice Prince of Slytherin, thought Harry, what would your subjects think if they saw you like this? "As you were a good puppy, I'll let you have your reward now."
"Ah! Ahhhhh…", Harry groaned, still low for how Draco wanted to leave him (a mess, totally destroyed, weak, just moaning and moaning for his pleasure), but it was enough. Draco sucked on the head of his cock, running his tongue through the slit and feeling his hair being grabbed again. He forced his head up, and finally released the cock from that last piece. Smiling at the other's flushed face, he sucked on it again, putting as much as he could in his mouth. Potter's moans grew louder and louder, and the grip on his hair grew in force. "DRACO! Draco, I-AH!"
In the end, Draco came inside Potter, and put the plug back on to secure his cum would be inside him.
Before the rest of the room could even look away, Draco was slowly fucking into Potter again, this time with a pace so slow he was almost not moving at all. But the brunette was very sensitive, squirming and whimpering, while Draco showered his neck and shoulders with open mouthed kisses.
At the moment, Harry couldn't hear anything but the noise of blood running in his ears. The demon of fate had decided. Harry wasn't going to reach adulthood, and he would be okay with that if his life so far had not been a succession of disasters and death.
"What?", Draco's voice was dangerously low. Severus studied Draco's stance, the director sitting calmly, the atmosphere tense.
"So you walked around like this just to see if anyone would fuck you in front of the whole school?", Potter looked away, blushing tinting his cheeks. "Answer me, whore."
Harry didn't exactly follow what was said, but then Draco was coming off of him, and he whimpered at the loss.
"If I was, I wouldn't have killed him.", The lie came out like silk from Draco's tongue. Exclamations of surprise and disbelief echoed through the communal. "If Slytherin is about self-preservation, we are doing shitty work if we don't fight the madman who wants to turn our families into lapdogs."
The Death Eaters stopped, as did everyone else, and joined the Lord's side. Draco went to the front of the battle, along with Weasley and Longbottom.
"You call what we did that night of friendship…", Seeing the blonde's cheeks take on a pinkish colour was worth everything. "But it took a while to realize what, or who Dumbledore is. He knew that Sirius was not guilty, and yet he let him stay twelve years in Azkaban. And when he left, he left him stuck in the place he hates the most in the world. And not to mention all that he put me through all these years."
The fuck was hard and fast, Potter was just a toy for him to use as he pleased. And the brunette took it, moaning into Draco's hand until his mouth was filled with three of the blond's fingers and he eagerly sucked on them.
"No one takes cock like me, Malfoy.", The pure pride into this statement made Draco grip harder into his waist. He growled.
Severus nodded as if he understood. He went to the body and took something from it. Draco did not want to analyze the situation.
Conjuring a glass and a pitcher of water, he drank half the content, getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. He cleaned himself up, the cum dry on his body a reminder of what will happen hours ago.
Draco approached, his eyes trained on the floor, and he knelt in front of the bars. Harry saw him look back at the door that was now closing and finally finally looking him in the eye.
The iron door opened, and Harry saw Draco come in with a tray with clearly more food than the other Death Eaters brought.
The noise of the director's body falling over the chair was extremely anti-climatic. Draco was shaking.
Harry smiled, his fingers still moving inside him, and muttered another spell. Draco's contained cry revealed that it had worked, a line of magic holding the base of the blonde's cock and preventing him from coming. Harry loved the way Draco looked like he was about to cry, his ass almost buried in his face. The lubricating spell had not stopped producing the invisible liquid, now forming a puddle that fell over the blonde's shoulders.
Draco thanked every deity that gave him his endurance, and grabbed Potter's buttcheeks, markings his ass with only his hands, scratching the skin.
"So you are the reason for this betrayal?", The Lord looked at him angrily. Draco would have trembled with fear months ago, but now he ignored him, turning to the students behind him.
The Lord would not appear now. No, he would wait for everything to calm down before showing his face.
He took off the toy harshly, shutting Potter with a hand in front of his mouth and entering him with only his own spit as lube.
"Did your father not tell you?", Harry gave a bitter laugh. Lucius Malfoy had escaped the Ministry, and would probably face the fury of his beloved Lord. "I'm dead, Malfoy."
Then he would infiltrate Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore and invade with his entire army, and as a final act, Harry's sacrifice.
"Luna, what are you doing? You have to take everyone to a safe place, the Lord will arrive at any moment!"
It was no big surprise when, two months later, Hogwarts resumed its school year. Draco's father had been arrested and convicted, his mother lived in a property in France, and Draco had sold the mansion in order to renovate Grimmauld Place. Sirius (who had been absolved of his wrongful sentence, and was now a free man) and Remus had themselves moving there, sleeping in the master bedroom and although Harry and Draco had separate bedrooms, they could easily be found in each other's arms in the morning.
Holding one leg over his shoulders, Draco came down, the scene both familiar and different. This time, Potter was flushed, the sky now clearing the light through the thin curtains, and he bit his lip without looking at the blonde.
"What time is it?", Potter's voice was hoarse, and the blonde tried not to care about the shiver she gave him.
Voldemort wanted Harry to die for everyone to see. He wanted the last hope of a better wizarding world to be erased in front of everyone.
"Draco, what you are talking about is…", Blaise looked pale, his black skin taking on a shade of gray.
It was delicious, the heat and the way Potter still held him. But it was more beautiful to see the long fingers stick to the sheets, discounting the pleasure he felt. Dropping the brunette's face, he traced a line through his arms, until he joined his fingers and started to move.
Potter's cry was shrill and he tore the sheet. Draco's tongue kept coming in and out of the pulsating entrance, feeling him squeeze his tongue and moaning just to imagine it happening on his dick.
"ENOUGH!", More Death Eaters appeared, and the students and the few teachers were surrounded. "Your lack of respect went beyond acceptable, Malfoy. Let's get it over with now."
Harry stood up, the gasps and sounds of surprise were muffled when he put his hand in Draco's hand, hugging him sideways. The blonde looked at him, his face streaked with dust and ash cut by the trail of tears but his eyes shone with happiness.
Potter didn't even need to look twice at him to kneel down on the floor and crawl to him. He pressed his cheek to Draco's thighs and the blond had to refrain himself from reaching and petting his hair.
The coffin was brought to the center, and opened. Harry left, staggering and falling to the floor. Draco tried to go to him but someone stopped him.
"Enough, enough! Mr. Potter, should I remind you that you are in public?", The scolding came from Madam Pomfrey, but they didn't even care, smiling at each other.
"There was no other way, Draco. Don't worry. Now we have the rest of our lives.", The brunette blushed. "That is, if you want me."
Draco rolled his eyes, but she finally stopped lecturing and announced they would play Truth or Dare.
"Don't tell me. You know, everyone always talks about how kind and generous you are, headmaster. But in all the years that I was at Hogwarts, even when someone needed your help, their assistance was always vague and ultimately useless. I think it's time to end this reign of pretended kindness and generosity with reservations.", He raised his wand. "Ava…"
"Let me take care of you.", Potter's body fell limp under his care, the moan that left his lips cut by the kiss they exchanged.
"Granger, regardless of the problems we had, they are just children, and most importantly: they are not me. Please, they are not to blame for what is happening…"
"You're such a fucking cockslut, aren't you, Potter?", The surprise in his green eyes wore off and was replaced by lust and heat. "Walking around like that, like a naughty slut. You would let any stinky dick fuck you, wouldn't you? Like the cheap under the fence whore you are."
He sneaked down the halls, until he reached the headmaster's office. The password, which he obtained by obscure means, came out of his lips in a shaky whisper. The door opened.
"I'll let you know now, Harry's ass, mouth, dick and whole body are mine. Mine to command and mine to use. If any of you try to touch him, you'll be more than dead.", He fucked into Harry's mouth faster, as if to prove his point.
When he returned, he found Potter wrapped in the sheet, eyes still cloudy with sleep but drinking the rest of the water. When the last glass was finished, he held out his arm to Draco, as if asking for more, and Draco promptly attended the request. After that, he got out of bed too, and went to the bathroom, disappearing from view for the time it took for Draco to change the sheets and put new and clean ones.
Potter eagerly opened his mouth, and Draco guided his dick to his lips until they closed around him. Starting with a shallow and easy pace, Draco soon grabbed Potter's hair to push himself into the heat of his throat, feeling it pulse around him.
"Did you see what I was talking about? You would have neither pride nor honor when fighting for him!", The next few seconds were a blur. The Lord's snake attacked him, but before he could protect himself, Longbottom appeared with a sword and cut off her head, just as the snakeman let out a cry.
"Not for long. I want to get you out of here, but I can't even leave the mansion, and I already begged my mom... For her to…"
Seeing this chat as a sign Draco could show the room what he could do, he dropped Potter on his back, one hand protecting his head and the other gripping the boy's cock. His grip was vicious, not wanting to let Potter come until he was filled to the brim with his come. Pistoning into the wet heat of Potter's ass, Draco let out an animalistic growl.
"No, with so many Death Eaters being old Slytherins they can get in. It is very dangerous to take risks, we don't even left the little ones there. Speaking of them, can you take them with you?"
The alohomora came out of his lips gently, and he entered the house. Wrapping himself in the invisibility cloak, he walked through the dark corridors still following that trail. Harry thought of nothing but silver-blond hair and a mocking smile.
Draco laughed. It wasn't like his obsession with Harry was something new, nor that he disguised his crush with insults and fights.
"MILORDE!", Draco's father's voice was heard, and he launched himself at the man's feet. Draco laughed, and everyone turned to him.
"Look at you, coming just from having your mouth fucked, kneeling on your own mess like a pig.", He pushed Potter from his dick, seeing that the make-up on his eyes was messed up with tears and his lipstick was smeared with spit. "Up, go to the wall and present your ass."
Pain flashed over her face. “I don’t believe the injuries are that bad. No internal trauma. No spell damage. I healed the injuries that were still bleeding freely. He will be fine.” That last seemed to be said mostly to herself.
“I dunno. Five galleons says she could lay you out.” George grinned crookedly for a moment. “Seriously though Harry, what are you doing? Last I knew, you hated him.”
Mrs. Weasley set another piece of tart in front of Victoire. “Of course you’re invited, dear. He’s your cousin.”
“Okay,” Harry tried for casual, “say I sign, what happens if I break the agreement?” He needed more information, but he wasn’t completely stupid. Last he’d heard, Marietta Edgecomb
“I don’t want your pity,” Malfoy hissed. He was scrutinizing Harry closely. “I swear to Merlin, if you make this into a
Harry was quite surprised when the lump on the bed suddenly moved, making Harry stumble back as the blanket came free abruptly.
“This be having nothing to do with canceling your Life Debt, boy, and you know it,” she snapped with triumph in her eyes.
“Whoa, whoa,” Harry laughed, “Uncle Ron will always be my best mate and no, Mal – er, Draco isn’t a veela.” But it would have explained the endless expanses of pale, flawless skin, white, shining blond hair, and Harry’s utter inability to
Shoulders slumping, Malfoy sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Before you agreed, but after she stated her terms, what did you feel?”
Harry looked up when Malfoy trailed off and saw that he was staring at the tripod with the camera on it. On it, a red light was blinking.
George smiled rapturously. “The Brick is going to be my crowning achievement. It’s going to power entertainment, instant communication, unlimited access to information, and cat images.”
Hearing Harry’s grunt of pain, Malfoy turned around to look incredulously from Ginny’s horrified face, to her wand, and then to Harry. Malfoy’s face twisted viciously as understanding struck, and he took a step toward her. Harry grabbed his arm tightly and shook his head.
Harry was trying to find a place to set his gifts amidst a pile that would have made Dudley green with envy when Neville and Ginny approached.
“After you told me so much about Mary here, I just had to meet her.” Malfoy smiled handsomely at Mary.
“Why don’t you come in, Auror Potter. Take a look around. Check for anything… naughty.” Malfoy opened the door wider and walked back into his apartment. “Make sure to close the door behind you.”
“Yes, it does. And they are still intact. I wouldn’t even have known Draco was attacked if they hadn’t thrown a rock through one of the windows.”
“Yes,” he said slowly. “Now, kindly rein in your magic.” Malfoy rubbed his arms uncomfortably and grabbed the teacup that was now floating by his shoulder.
Harry didn’t narrow his eyes, but he wanted to. Where had the mousey little accountant gone? Roberts was suddenly composed in a way that Harry hadn’t quite seen before. In those few moments of quiet breathing Roberts had morphed into someone who appeared self-assured and confident. Harry needed to knock that confidence down, but first, he approached gently.
Harry finished his pint and gazed into the bottom of his glass. He sat there for long minutes, alone, and trying to avoid the few interested looks that where being thrown his way.
So here Harry was. He nodded in understanding. Sometimes the only thing that stood between a success and a failure was a gut feeling. He sized the other Aurors up, deciding how they were going to do this. Curly might be paranoid -not an unusual trait for an Auror- and this could all be nothing. Or it could be something. Either way, Harry didn’t really trust Mr. Can’t Be Bothered To Get A Hair Cut to be reliable backup. Call it a hunch. Taylor, however, looked like he could handle himself in a fight. He had a quietly confident air about him and wore his well-fitting Auror robes like he was born in them. Not that Harry was going to let either one of them foul things up. He, Harry, would of course take point.
With a twist of his wrist, Harry conjured a handful of lube and slicked his cock. He used what was left in his hand to press two fingers into Malfoy’s arsehole. He was hot, open, and ready.
“And then he died.” She gave a soft chuckle and her eyes grew distant. “T’wasn’t even me that got to kill him.”
Looking directly at Harry, he moaned as his hands worked in tandem, stroking and fucking. “Fuck. So fucking good. I’m going to make myself come so hard on this cock. It’s filling my tight hole just right.”
Malfoy scowled at him and Narcissa shook her head slowly. “No,” she said, “I tried as soon as I healed him. The memory is gone. He was Obliviated and whoever did it knew what they were doing.”
“Goodbye, George.” Harry pulled his head out of the fire and tapped the Bugs. They fell out. He looked down at the spider-like devices with a grimace. He tossed them onto the kitchen table and sat down heavily. “User friendly, my arse,” he grumbled while staring at the Bugs hatefully.
Emilia clicked her tongue. “Fecking bird. Useless and blind as me late husband, bless his fecking soul.” She waved her wand over a nearby tea set and the kettle immediately started steaming. “Do not just be standing there, my boy. Come pour us some tea and you can tell me what you want.”
Harry found himself standing in front of a muggle apartment building. Squaring his shoulders, he walked up and took the stairs to the third floor. At apartment 103, he stopped and stared at the door. He smoothed his Auror robes and ran a hand through his hair. Taking a deep breath, he knocked.
“Sure, got it,” Harry agreed, “no burning buildings.” He left the office with Robards’ narrowed eyes still following him.
Kreacher peeked around the corner and said, “Master Draco’s illness is lasting for hours while you is away. Kreacher is not being able stop it.”
Roberts laughed. He fucking laughed and licked his lips like he’d tasted something good. “Oh, very good, Auror Potter. Very threatening and domineering.”
“Well,” a voice said in Harry’s ear, causing him to jump, “looks like he’s having fun.” There was that damn word again. Looking away from the porn happening on the dancefloor, Harry saw that Mary had returned and was also watching Malfoy. She handed him one of the shot glasses she held.
in his house that definitely needed medical attention and a known Voldemort supporter had brought that person here.
Malfoy lifted his chin haughtily and said, “bollocks. I have a refined beauty you could only dream of.”
It wasn’t until Malfoy reached the front hall that Harry started to feel uncomfortable. His chest suddenly felt tight and his stomach clenched. Nausea roiled through him and dizziness turned his vision grey, leaving nothing but the remembered sight of Malfoy unconscious and bleeding.
Malfoy looked away first and muttered sardonically, “wouldn’t want that.” He went back to his stacks of books and parchment, apparently choosing to pretend that Harry no longer existed.
Harry seriously doubted that. His face was still regularly splashed across the front page of the Prophet.
They all sat, and Harry turned to George. “Before I forget, you should read Mouse’s Theory of Binding Quantities of Acquisition Compulsions.”
Harry came out of his daze enough to loudly address Kreacher, irritation heavily lacing his words, “burn the sitting room sofa when you get a chance.”
“Dancing is like chasing the snitch. It's a rush. Everything narrows down and all you feel is the thrill of knowing it’s about to be in your grasp. It's knowing,” Malfoy’s hands slid up Harry’s waist and lifted his arms, “that nothing can stop you.”
Malfoy sneered at the suggestion before squaring his shoulders with determination. “Right, okay. We have to go shopping. Let’s go.”
“You were made to suck cock.” Potter hummed at this and Draco felt it down to his toes. “So good. Fuck. My good boy.”
Chagrinned at being caught out, Harry gave a half shrug. He’d have to work on being more convincing tomorrow.
“I can see that.” Malfoy’s lips quivered. “Why in Merlin’s name would you do that right before a date?”
Narcissa nodded to herself and heaved a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Mr. Potter. I must go. Kreacher will care for Draco. He will be fine, and I will find who hurt him.”
“Well, you missed one.” Harry indicated the broken pot with a nod of his head. “I had a stunner aimed at me and the perp got away.”
I was testing a new product. They got stuck.” Harry picked up the Ear-bugs he’d discarded the day before and offered them to Hermione.
and blew a stream of Firewhiskey smoke toward the ceiling. “I’m going to dance,” he announced and then sauntered away.
Trying not to blurt out any of the questions that where shouting in his mind and squirming on the inside because he wasn’t glamoured, Harry aimed for confident as he said, “a pleasure to meet you. Can I get a mead?”
He abandoned the search for his toothbrush and undressed. He was about to drop his pajama bottoms on the floor when a small patch caught his eye. A patch of semen.
He had to pull away when his bollocks tightened and he neared the edge of orgasm. Breathing deeply, he looked down at Malfoy’s abused mouth and had to close his eyes. Not yet. Not yet. He wanted to be buried in Malfoy’s arse when he finally came.
Malfoy looked up as Harry sat down. He swallowed his bite thickly and gingerly set the sandwich down. “Ah,” he cleared his throat awkwardly, “Potter, it seems I may have been a bit overly dismissive last night.”
Moving away abruptly, Harry said, “I don’t need saving. It’s fine. Just – please, don’t mention it to anyone.” Narcissa didn’t know who had attacked Malfoy and seemed to have a wide range of suspects.
” Malfoy said with a feral grin, “the sight of this beautiful woman is intoxication enough.” Malfoy picked up Mary’s hand from where it was still resting on Harry’s arm and kissed it. He placed it back on the table, leaned back in his chair, and licked his lips before knocking back the shot he’d brought with him.
your self-righteous friends, after all.” He continued babbling caustically, “what shall we do to pass the time between visits? Should we do facials and braid each other’s hair? Want to talk about our feelings? Talk about boys?”
Everything slowed. Harry knew he was too far away. Knew he’d never get his wand out in time. He could only watch whatever was going to happen.
“Why? His mother be looking for the answer already. Do ye really think you could do a better job of it than her?” She looked far too interested in hearing his reply.
Harry’s breath was coming faster as he watched, and his cock ached where it was trapped in his trousers. Malfoy was a beautiful, wanton thing, fucking his face and rolling his hips to meet the rhythm of his fist.
It seemed like Malfoy’s mum was grasping at the same straws Harry was. He wished he could have been under his invisibility cloak to witness that conversation. Narcissa’s icy distain pitted against Emilia’s sharp tongue would be a sight to behold.
“Okay, good.” Forcing cheer into her voice, she continued, “I’m going to go say hello to Andromeda. I’ll see you later, yeah? Just the two of us?”
The alcohol had led him to the dancefloor but didn’t lend any actual knowledge of how to dance. Suddenly at a loss, Harry shifted from foot to foot while Mary gyrated to his right. Malfoy was still watching him. He tried to recall anything McGonagall had taught them before the Yule Ball in fourth year and came up blank. He desperately tried to relax his shoulders and find any kind of rhythm. He failed utterly.
Harry slammed Malfoy down hard on his cock once, twice, and stilled with his cock still buried deeply inside him.
The humming broke off as Kreacher looked at Harry sharply. Slowly, he reached deeply into a cupboard and pulled out a new container of tea that looked rather ordinate. “Master Draco is needing
Kreacher appeared with a pop and smiled brightly at Malfoy. “Kreacher will put on a pot of good tea.” He took the pot already on the table and dumped it’s almost full contents down the sink. “There is being no need for this one anymore.”
Her eyes widened incredulously. She breathed out harshly and looked Harry in the eyes. “Whatever happened, you don't owe him a single thing. You saved the world. You don’t owe
Malfoy came back into the sitting room before too long and sat down with his head in his hands. “Just ask, Potter. I know you’re dying to.”
Malfoy took the parchment but kept his eyes on the elf. “You,” he said, pointing accusingly at Kreacher, “need to stop taking my clothes off.”
“I don’t need your help.” His sneer lost some of its effect as he swayed and grabbed onto the doorframe.
Realizing he was babbling in his own head, Harry turned on the taps and splashed water on his face. What was wrong with him? Why was he reacting like this? It was just skin. He’d lived in a dormitory with four other blokes for six years! Shared a bathroom and quidditch locker room, for God’s sake.
Malfoy tilted his head, tapped one of the Bugs a few times, and replied, “of course I did. These are actually rather impressive. Bit tinny, but still.”
“Coming right up.” He made their drinks and set them on the bar. “On the house,” he said with another wink.
Tearing his mouth away, Malfoy groaned throatily and said, “put your hard, hot cock in my arse. Fill me up and fuck me hard.”
“Why go to them at all? They have no sympathy for my family and some of them might have been among those who did this.” Narcissa shook her head. “No. At best, they would forget about Draco in a shuffle of paperwork. At worst… Well, I would rather they not have access to him.”
“C’mon, I’ll side-along you.” Harry was mostly certain he was sober enough to Apparate. Tightening his hold on Malfoy’s waist, he turned and Disapparated.
Ginny stepped out, absentmindedly brushing soot off her dress. “Hi, Harry. Everything alright?” She came to stand next to him and touched his hair.
Glitter Face shrugged and hopped off the barstool. “Suit yourself. But if you ever decide you want to play…” He left the sentence unfinished as he sauntered away.
“Yes, Mistress,” Kreacher intoned with another deep bow. “Kreacher is taking good care of Master Draco while he is here. He is having plenty of rest and good tea. Last night, Kreacher is making sure he is comfortable.”
Turning his attention to the nearby dancefloor, Harry watched as people swayed in time to the music in a way he’d never been able to achieve. A small group nearest Harry danced together lewdly. Bodies touched provocatively and hands were everywhere.
George started asking questions in rapid succession, none of which Harry even understood. Thankfully, Bill and Fleur knew their stuff and rattled off answer after answer.
“No, I guess not.” Harry looked over to where Teddy was talking animatedly to a smiling Malfoy. It was hard for Harry to maintain his earlier confusion and anger at the git when Teddy looked so happy to be talking with him. “He’s… frustrating. And I don’t
Harry gave his back a dirty look and then wandered off to explore all the youthful delights he’d missed out on while growing up with the Dursley’s.
Instantly alert, Harry asked, “what’s happened?” He slammed the door shut and was hurrying down the hallway before the elf could answer.
“Hmm,” Draco gently soothed both cheeks and rolled them to expose Potter’s tight, pink arsehole, “you’re going to be so tight around my cock.” He trailed a finger over the puckered flesh and felt Potter shudder. Draco placed his prick between Potter’s splayed cheeks and rocked slightly. Potter arched and let out a moan that traveled all the way down his spine. Taking advantage of this, Draco reached forward and shoved two fingers in Potter’s mouth. “Make them wet.”
Wincing, Kreacher put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and then repeated whatever he’d said.
Again, the fire leapt to life. “Party at Harry’s, eh? Oh.” Harry noticed that Bill had come with his wand at the ready.
hadn’t opened his eyes and she guided him to lean back onto her. She whispered into his ear and Malfoy shivered. She slid one arm around his chest to play with a nipple and her other hand went to his throat. She bit his earlobe and whispered again. Malfoy grabbed his cock and started stroking himself. She was scanning their audience again and whispering continuously. Whatever it was she was saying must have been something because Malfoy’s hand moved faster, and his breathing was coming in gasps and pants. He threw his head back onto the woman’s shoulder and appeared to be fighting to not let his hips jerk. His bollocks were high and tight, and Harry was slack jawed.
“When I do let you suck me, you’re going to gag on it. It’s going to go all the way to the back of your throat and I’m going to feel you choke on it.”
Malfoy rose briefly to turn around on his armchair and offer up his arse. “It’s even better when I’m being fucked. Sucking on cock with another hard cock in my tight arsehole.” Harry saw him deftly use his wand to surreptitiously coat his fingers in lube. He rested an elbow on the back of the armchair and started sucking the plastic cock again. He reached back and slid a finger into his arse.
Amycus leered horribly at Ginny and said, “I think she needs further instruction. Maybe some privet lessons. I’ve a thing or two I could teach her.”
Harry felt like he shouldn’t be looking and glanced nervously around the room. Everyone was watching the platform. Even the bartender. Some sat back, sipping drinks and watching idly. Some whispered into another’s ear, eyes always trained on the display. Others were leaning forward, attention solely focused on Malfoy, hungry looks on their faces.
“I got top marks on every practical for Disguise and Concealment while I was in training,” Harry declared, feeling rather insulted.
“Idiot,” Harry said without heat. With a resigned sigh, he stepped into the stall and reached for the zip on Malfoy’s trousers. Malfoy tried to bat his hands away. “You know, Mark could have helped you if you didn’t want me to do it.”
Malfoy’s eyes snapped from Harry’s hand to his face. His expression shifted to something Harry didn’t have a name for but looked a bit like he was either going to punch Harry or vomit. “Fine,” he eventually ground out.
Trying not to let his grin show, he said, “I’ll show you.” He pushed away his uneaten eggs and gestured for Malfoy to follow him.
Finally, Harry heard movement from inside Malfoy’s apartment and a moment later, the door opened with a waspish, “I’m trying to
Harry could now make out a murmur as his hearing began to return but still couldn’t understand. He shrugged at the house elf in apology. “Can it wait?” he asked in what he hoped was a modulated tone.
“Okay,” Harry said. That was good to know. Harry doubted anyone else behind the bar would serve them so quickly. He resolved to drink his pint slowly to avoid intoxication and a long wait time if he needed another.
Malfoy let Harry pull his hands away from his temples and met his eyes. The pain in them receded rapidly and was replaced with intense relief and then profound dismay.
“No one, including myself and all staff, goes beyond that door without signing. And, as I said, anyone who breaks the agreement would be barred from further entry. However, this is a tight-knit community, and we cannot promise safety beyond our doors.”
Almost an hour later, Harry’s perusal was interrupted by Malfoy, who was holding a bag. He cocked his head at Harry and said, “I thought you already got him a present.”
Malfoy slid the plastic cock between his lips. His head fell back as he took the toy as deeply as he could, and he moaned. He moved it in and out of his mouth and began stroking his cock.
“I doubt that very much. She’ll be back in my bed tonight. You will not find any drugs, potions, spells, charms, or curses on or in Pricilla. In fact, she’s probably waiting for me at home right now.”
“You. A Bat-Bogey Hex should be sufficient. Pick whichever one you like.” She waved a negligent hand toward the terrified students.
Kreacher put a hand to his chest in a gesture Harry almost believed was outrage. “Would Kreacher do something like that?” The tiny smirk he wore said he would.
“To clean you! There was blood!” This was not making Malfoy look any less outraged. “Wait, no! Not like that!” Taking a deep breath, Harry open his mouth to try again but couldn’t think of a way to explain that neither he nor his house elf were into blood play with comatose wizards.
Ah, someone was at the door. Harry had forbidden Kreacher from answering himself because of an incident involving a singing telegram, a bubble charm, and a witch wearing only a few strategically placed tassels. Harry was still suspicious that had been George’s doing.
Squaring his shoulders and looking Narcissa in the eye, he asked, “what’s going on? How did you even know where I live?”
“No, you just made it physically impossible for me to go anywhere without you. And don’t get me started on what it probably means that my mere presence will fulfill a Life Debt.”
Malfoy had spelled his hair black. He’d styled it in short, soft waves that looked tousled without being messy. It caught the light when he moved and shone softly. He’d even altered his eyebrows to be darker and fuller. Small changes to his face gave him a stronger jaw and a dimple in his chin.
Potter eagerly complied and coated his digits in saliva. He swirled his tongue around them filthily and sucked them in to the third knuckle.
Harry was willing to let him go and sarcastically made a grand sweeping gesture toward the door. This was not how he’d wanted to spend his Wednesday afternoon. If the arsehole could make it out the door, surely, he’d be fine without Harry’s help. Malfoy and his stupid pride could fuck right off.
“What? No!” Harry pushed his hair back. “Look, I wasn’t expecting him to stay either, but I guess I owe him something.”
“Oh, well,” she said in surprise. “I’ll go pour us some. Harry, can you grab biscuits?” she said over her shoulder and, without waiting for a reply, she left the room.
It took Harry over a month to find out what a leather petal was, and it happened entirely by chance.
Harry remembered how shamelessly Malfoy had flirted with Mary and the sinful way he'd moved on the dancefloor. “Oh.”
In truth, Harry wanted them to see if there were any new donors to the organization Mary worked for. If there were, they might be someone new on the muggle support scene.
Ginny gave half a smile as she said, “well, at least you know that. Be careful, Harry. He’ll do anything to get what he wants. Anything. Don’t trust him.”
“Nonsense,” she said briskly. With a minute shake of her head, she gathered herself. “I’ll find your attackers. It’s just going to take a bit longer than I anticipated.”
The young fellow flashed dazzling teeth and gave Harry an almost predatory look. “Mmm, you look very strong.”
Wiping a shaky hand across his mouth, Malfoy answered, “three more shots. And then… You know… went into the gent’s…”
A surprised, strangled noise came from Harry’s throat as his eyes betrayed him by avidly following the line of Malfoy’s body. His skin was so pale. Paler then Ginny’s and without all the freckles. From ankles, to calves, up his thighs and over the swell of his arse, there was nothing to interrupt the expanse of his skin. An unwelcome tightness settled in Harry's lower abdomen and, without his permission or understanding, his pajamas bottoms began to tent. Frozen, Harry watched the muscles in Malfoy’s back shift as he moved an arm.
Narcissa ignored his incredulous expression. “He was attacked on Malfoy Manor’s grounds.” She paused significantly and gave Harry direct eye contact. “That means, Mr. Potter, that someone entered our estate without my knowledge.”
Potter licked his lips and re-positioned himself. His eyes fluttered as he reached back and slipped a finger in. “I want your cock in me right now. I want it to stretch me wide. I want to feel it for days.” He groaned, and Draco could tell he’d already added a second finger.
Slowly, high cheek bones and a strong jaw tilted up toward him as big, dark-lashed eyes met his and Not-Jim said, “green.”
“I’ll be here. I’ll owl you the papers and see you then.” She stood and walked away with an exaggerated sway of the hips.
They laughed for a minute and then Harry sobered. “Really, though. Thanks for not being a dick about this.”
Harry told Malfoy he needed to make a call, told Kreacher to find the prat some clothes, and escaped to the kitchen. He stood for a moment, pinching the bridge of his nose.
” Malfoy’s mouth twisted on the word, “after I was left here in such a state. So, sorry, I guess,” he finished clumsily and without much sincerity.
Harry entered the interview room after Taylor. Taylor went to lean against the far wall behind their suspect and Harry took the seat across the table from the piece of shit. He flipped open a file, studied it for a moment, and then finally looked up. “So, Mr. Roberts – “
Malfoy’s head snapped up and he stared blearily at Harry. “Stupid muggle zips.” He continued fumbling at his crotch and Harry realized that Malfoy might be rather drunk.
“I organized garden gnome pit fighting and commanded the house elves to joust with each other while riding the peacocks.”
Harry exhaled heavily. “Look, I’ve told you all I can. You got beat up, your mum brought you here, and she’ll be back in three days to collect you.”
“An Owl came,” Malfoy announced loudly. He shuffled through the fallen parchment and came up with a piece that was folded and sealed.
“Auror Potter,” Roberts said calmly with a hint of condescension in his tone, “you have such a narrow view of the world.”
Harry took a seat at the bar and waited for the bartender to notice him. The man was absently wiping down the counter in a bored manner and perked up as soon as he realized he had a customer. He flipped a white cloth over his shoulder and walked toward Harry with a smile.
Feeling deflated, Harry said, “Emilia, give me something here. I just want to figure out what happened.”
At first, all Harry could see was a stone floor. He was gliding down it, but not like he was walking. There were a set of loud footsteps and Harry could just barely make out boots striding on either side of him in his periphery. Indistinct voices in the distance slowly grew clearer as they approached. Harry thought he could hear Malfoy’s voice, sharp and impatient.
“Cat images,” George confirmed succinctly. “Portable, loops lasting much longer than photographs can manage, with
From behind his book, Malfoy said, “if you see him, tell the Weasley from yesterday to read Mauss’ Theory of Qualitive Binding of Compulsory Acquisition. I think it shows promise for solving his Brick problem.”
Lip curling in a very un-Hermione-like way, she announced, “last question. Malfoy, do you have plans to coerce, trick, or use Harry in any way now or in the future?”
“You did,” Malfoy looked gleefully malicious. In a high approximation of a woman’s voice, Malfoy simpered, “
Harry blinked. Malfoy was completely misreading the situation. What did Harry’s expression look like to make Malfoy think he might
Mouth open to say – something, Harry went very still and waited for the inevitable outcry. He didn’t wait long.
“The Cannons and the Harpies,” Harry answered. “I was going to get the Tornadoes, but Ginny told me to go with the Harpies instead. She’s hoping to play for them.”
It was everything Draco could have hoped for. Potter attacked his cock with enthusiasm, swallowing it down in one quick glide and then pulling off with a wet pop before diving back in. Potter’s tongue was a hard press against the underside of his cock and he felt himself hit the back of that tight throat again and again. Draco was bathed in heat and wetness.
After a few more moments of puttering around the kitchen, Kreacher addressed Harry again in a softer voice, “I is thinking that Master Harry is also needing good tea.” He placed a cup in front of Harry with a kind expression. “You is looking very upset about Master Draco’s hurting.” He patted Harry on the shoulder and then followed the levitating tea tray out of the room.
Definitely long fingers and a firm grip. Not too small. He liked the idea of being encompassed by someone else’s touch. A hand that could grasp him with heat and surety, move boldly just how Harry liked.
Draco roughly stroked himself a few more times and decided he couldn’t wait anymore. Using his grip on Potter’s hair, he moved him back and stood. “Take my trousers off.”
A few hours later, the birthday party was in full swing when they Apparated onto the lawn of Andromeda’s house. The sudden increase in volume and the delighted shrieking of children was jarring. A small boy ran by trailing streamers and sparkles as more children chased him. Adults gathered in clusters, chatting, and watching the kids fondly.
, Harry thought savagely. If Malfoy did anything to upset Teddy today, Harry would beat him bloody. Kreacher would just have to mend him all over again. Harry had been drinking swill tea for years; the old house elf had nothing to withhold for his good behavior.
A quick glimpse of an arse and suddenly Harry was jerking off to thoughts of Malfoy? That was not on. It was weird and creepy. Stupid Malfoy and his pretend breasts and long fingers and stupid little smile and all that skin and that round, perfect arse, and muscled thighs and…
“Thanks,” Mary said when Harry set the drink in front of her, “but I’m going to use the loo really quick now that you’re back. Watch my drink for me. I’ll be right back.”
Malfoy’s face fell. “Merlin’s saggy fucking testicles,” he swore as he started pacing again. “Before you tried to stop me from leaving, how did you feel then?”
Malfoy moaned around his fingers and spread his legs wide. Through lowered lashes, he watched Harry as he trailed his hand down his chest slowly. His hand continued over a flat, hairless stomach and skimmed the edge of a sharp hipbone.
Wait. What? No. He just needed to stop this. It wasn’t right. Malfoy was shaking with the strain of remaining upright while the woman pulled his head back. She bit him and Malfoy let out a strangled sound.
He Owled Neville to ask if he knew of a plant with leather petals. He’s gotten a lengthy list back of plants that could be described as leathery, but none that grew actual leather. And really, how would that even work? Leather came from animals. Was there an animal that had petals? He Owled Hagrid and received an invitation to visit but Hagrid didn’t know of an animal that flowered.
Looking up, Harry saw that one of the screens still displayed a view of the armchair. The view was fucking spectacular. Malfoy was splayed open, Harry’s cock pumping in and out of his arse and a magicked toy sliding through his lips while he moaned shamelessly.
"Kreacher is finding Master Harry on the floor, dazed and he is holding his head and couldn't hear Kreacher," Kreacher said with his usual impeccable timing.
Ginny stood her ground and refused to move the rest of the way out of the entrance. Not wanting to cause a scene, Harry edged around her as quickly as he could. Malfoy did the same but paused in the small space to stare her in the eye with a carefully blank face. The tense moment passed as Malfoy turned away dismissively.
Harry realized he was staring when Malfoy looked up at him and cocked an eyebrow. “This is making my eyes hurt. Play a game of tiny quidditch?”
Hermione shot Malfoy a contemptuous look before answering Harry. “Your parasites. Ginny said something about there being bugs in you. I assume Malfoy has them too?”
“I don’t see how that be any of your fecking business,” she responded bluntly. She sipped her tea daintily to cover a smile and did nothing to hide the challenge in her eyes.
Potter threw his head back onto Draco’s shoulder and bounced in time with Draco’s thrusting. With a strangled cry, he came. Thick ribbons of cum shot from his cock and his hole clenched around Draco.
Head Auror Robards looked up from a file at Harry. “Crude and lascivious acts using muggle objects in violation of the Statute,” he repeated. “It was kicked up from Misuse. Says here, a complaint came in yesterday and they want us to take a look. And given who it is, I agree.”
“Oh, fuck off, Potter! Your Debt doesn’t include hand-holding and hen-pecking.” Malfoy’s lip curled with derision.
“Ms. Weasley,” Alecto tutted, “how selfish of you. You would deprive these others of a valuable lesson?”
“Oh? And you’re having it off left, right, and center?” Harry asked testily while not thinking about pale arses.
Alecto’s eyes hardened. “You can. You will. Unless I need to demonstrate a proper Bat-Bogey Hex for you?”
Jaw flexing and mouth pinching so tightly his lips turned white, Malfoy arched a sleek eyebrow and turned away from them without a word. His first few steps were cautious and then gained surety as he continued.
She snorted inelegantly. “Bah. Saucy boy. As pleasant as I may be, I know when someone be wanting something and I’m too fecking old to waste time pretending otherwise.”
Thinking of George, Harry took a moment to jot down some quick notes for him while he waited for his hearing to become more reliable.
“Why not? He looks half dead and could bleed out!” Harry’s brain was staring to catch up with the fact that there was a
The fire roared again, and George stepped out. “Mum, you can’t just – Oh. Everything alright, Harry? Ferret?”
“You have also saved each other. You pulled him out of that fire. And you can be sure that he knew exactly who you were when the Snatchers brought you to the Manor. Also, never forget,
The woman was holding a broad - stick? - and Malfoy had red blooming on his upper chest. Harry’s breath caught in his chest. She had
Malfoy’s lip curled. “Don’t worry, Potter, I don’t intend sully your honor with untoward assumptions and impositions.”
Draco was on the brink of orgasm when he pulled away and said, “I’m going to fill your tight arse with my cock and fuck you hard. Are you ready?”
“Harvey,” Harry said pleasantly while shooting eye daggers at Malfoy, “what are you doing over here?”
She looked back at Malfoy with narrowed eyes for a long moment. “You’re not telling me everything,” she accused with surety.
Harry’s eyes lit up with glee as he waited for the sound to assault Malfoy. Nothing happened. “Did you tap the note?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened comically. “You! What are you doing here? Where am I?” He made to stand but stopped and looked down at his blanket covered lap. His eyes narrowed to slits. “Why am I naked?” he asked suspiciously.
Harry moved passed him and closed the door. After relieving himself, he cleaned his teeth and stared hard into the mirror.
Malfoy burst into laughter. “Albert Humble?” he chortled. “No, you’re Harry Potter with yellow hair. Can you be any more obvious? Has this disguise actually worked on anyone?”
Draco waited a moment then stood and rounded his desk. He stopped in front of the other man, invading his space, and considered him from a closer perspective. Jim’s hair was a dusky blond, almost brown, and could probably be called curly if it grew longer. He wore a pair of muggle jeans and a plain black V-neck. The firm looking biceps stretching the shirt’s material promised a fit body underneath. Draco itched to find out if he was right.
Rolling his eyes again, Harry said, “he’ll have the same.” He considered Malfoy for a moment before adding, “with an extra espresso shot.”
As the details around him sharpened, he allowed his shoulders to loosen. There were few people in the room, and none were looking in his direction. They sat in small clusters, mostly on the edges of the room. There were groupings of empty, plush chairs around low tables and in two places, what looked like small platforms a few strides wide. Two closed doors were along the wall farthest from him and, immediately to his right, a long bar took up another full wall. It seemed like any  posh pub he might find in London.
Draco was clinging to her; his legs wrapped around the woman’s hips with blond hair buried in her neck while Ginny ran as if the floor was on fire.
Just as Harry also started to run towards them, Draco shook his head vigorously, afraid that the bats will follow; the three realized the bats were now moving in the opposite direction.
Though… I’m wondering if you noticed the looks Luna kept sending Pansy’s way when she thought no one was paying attention? I’m pretty sure Pansy was into it. Did she say anything to you? I’ve been thinking about it since I got home and I think they’re rather well-suited. Care to have a bit of fun? I know how much you love to meddle in your friends’ love lives, and I need a distraction from all the
I can’t imagine going through what you did. Having your home violated, and in the worst way possible. I get it. And I will not question you for those things again. Hell, I’m not even angry about you leaving. You left three days after the battle, with only a note for me left behind. You did it because you knew I would be furious at what the Ministry had in store for you. Didn’t you?
- you have a new world to turn to. But I was damned in the muggle world, and I was damned by the Wizarding world as well. Where do I go?
So. Pansy and Luna. Thursday. Anytime you can get here is fine, I'll add you to the wards so you can just come in whenever. Please do bring wine. Luna is partial to the weird ones, elderflower or gooseberry or feijoa (do they make dirigible plum wine? Plimpy port?), though I dunno how loose you want her to get (or how loose Pansy will want her? That feels a bit beyond what I want to know.) Maybe rosé is safer?
I’m being generous because when you wear clothes that don’t fit you, you become a massive pain in the arse. Seeing you walk
Harry stretched his hand out for Draco to take, and Draco thought he might faint from the giddiness of it all. As he made to get up, Draco realized that Talia had fallen asleep in the time that Harry and Draco were dancing around each other.
“Oh, Draco! What a wonderful party. Every time I tried to imagine what you would come up for my birthday, I would get different visuals in my mind. But nothing was certainly as magnificent,” she said by way of greeting.
Three days and seventeen hours later, they were no closer to a solution than they had been at the start. Draco’s hopes of solving this to have a minuscule chance at actually being selected were diminishing by the hour. The first day had gone well enough. Both had understood what had happened during the crimes and they had even managed to pinpoint the motive behind the robberies - gaining enough wealth to enter the pure-blood society. But this wasn't enough to catch the perpetrator. They had to figure out how it had been committed.
Sometimes I think I see a demon when I look in the mirror. And I want to keep you away from this. Only you could see this and not be afraid of me. But now, it scares even you. And you deserve better. The question isn’t if you are the best for me. You are, no doubt about it. Everything I ever needed and more than I could possibly want. But maybe you deserve more than a reluctant War Hero (see: boy raised like a lamb to be slaughtered) turned lunatic.
Draco was astonished at the loudness emanating from such a small body. He relented after a few moments when it became evident that she wasn’t going to stop. He bent to pick her up and held her close enough that she could sniff at the food and far away that she wouldn’t be able to swipe it off. It seemed that the greedy little one was begging for the cake. Fair enough, he thought. This gave him an excuse to also taste the cake.
You know that I will carry hope in my heart even after the point of hopelessness that someday you shall deem my plea
So I won’t waste my breath trying to convince you otherwise. You know that it won’t be easy, loving me. I’m bitter and broken and far too shattered and I don’t know if I would be able to pretend otherwise. War changes people - you know that as well as I. I don’t know if we’ll ever be the same, if we could ever go back to how we used to be before.
“So, you’re who they’re fighting over?” he asked as he took in her appearance. “I was going to give them a piece of mind for thinking of a woman as their property. But you’re so gorgeous, I wouldn’t blame them,” he finished as he appreciated her grey fur and emerald-green eyes.
Instead of being offended, Potter surprisingly burst out laughing. “No, I suppose, I didn’t,” he finally finished.
. You did hold your liquor well enough, I suppose. Luna was a different story though. If I had known that she would chug down the Fae-dust Blackcurrant wine like water, I would have certainly brought more. Speaking of which, I’m sending another bottle with this letter, since, in your own words,
Harry cut him off, “I failed my psychology test. I knew I was going to. And I wanted you to get the position without any bias. We both know you’re brilliant at this. You figured out she had used Travers’ house elf to get in and out of heavily protected mansions to steal, thus giving her a solid alibi and enough money to enter the high society. And you genuinely want to help people. You deserve to be selected.”
but you also put the fucking strippers on me and all of the catering. And hey, remember that time you volunteered me to go on a sex-dungeon shopping spree with Luna and Pansy?
It drives Draco mad. The tease of being almost able to see under them is too much, even more when Potter mindlessly bends forward to fetch something. Just like he's doing now.
"What about we have Potter make Draco come with his mouth and have Draco make Potter come with his fingers?"
"If I was, I wouldn't have killed him. Listen well. Dumbledore managed to destroy almost all of them. Only two to go. One, we don't know what it is, and the other is here at Hogwarts. I will meet with the Lord's troops at dawn, but I need at least the fifth to be destroyed."
When Harry and Draco's spell finally hit the snake man in the chest, his body fell to the floor, empty and lifeless.
"Come on, Draco!", The blonde smiled wickedly. Harry Potter was lying on his bed in the middle of the night, wearing only his muggle pants and nothing else, and still desperate for him. Draco had every intention of making the other boy go crazy before that night was over, and although he didn't quite understand why he was there (since, for sure, there should be hundreds of fans and friends who would be more willing than ever to fuck the hero of the wizarding world) he would use every minute with him. He got rid of the fingers in his hair, opened his Muggle pants and found a Muggle underwear. He laughed.
"Three and something in the morning. Want to talk?", Potter shook his head. Draco pulled him around the waist. "Was it good?"
"Potter? What are you doing in my room?", His blue eyes closed, suspicious. But Harry must have been in some kind of wave of power, as the wand flew across the room. He got into bed, kneeling beside the blonde. Now he looked scared, his eyes wide. Harry perhaps owed him some explanation for breaking in that way.
Looking under his lids drooping with desire, Harry saw Draco tremble, fear and lust filling his gray eyes.
He lifted Potter's hips, and guided his cock to the gaping hole begging to be filled. They both moaned while Draco's big fat cock entered him.
Almost losing Sirius, dueling Voldemort in person, and discovering that he was going to die for this war to end had taken a heavy toll.
"What?", When Draco didn't answer, Harry put his fingers around his neck, feeling the rest of the lubricating spell make his hands more slippery. "Did you say something, puppy?"
"Father, hold those dogs. They will not touch Potter until he is dressed.", A hand on his arm pulled him back to the bed, while a look of contempt studied the blonde. If his own nudity wasn’t enough evidence, the used and dirty sheet laying on the floor and the clothes scattered were indicative enough.
The third finger entered easily and in no time Harry felt his eyes roll as he touched his prostate. He devoted himself a little more, completely lost in pleasure, to the point of forgetting that someone was with him. It was only Draco's suffered groan that drew his attention to the cock still in front of him, now with a line of pre-come and about to explode.
Did I mention that the two friends to whom we owe the credit for getting us together are planning on moving in with each other? Do you reckon we could do the same thing? This way, one of our places could be our private “Velvet Witch” kind of den.
Minutes later, clean and dressed, but still ashamed, the two went down to find a wide-eyed Sirius being comforted by a Remus who looked like he was about to have a fit of laughter.
"I wanted you to stop talking!", Voldemort shouted, putting more power into his spell. But it made no difference, not when Harry was beside him, feeding Draco's magic in a way he never thought possible.
"Next time you want to try something new, just tell me, you coward. Or do you like to take cock like this into your cowardly ass? Like the bitchy sissy you are?"
The rest of the room gasped loudly, as if them having sex wasn't as shocking as them kissing. They kissed hard and deep, tongues caressing each other. When they finally stopped, they spent some seconds looking into the other's eyes.
Wisely, Draco just shook his head. Harry smiled, starting to move over him. He was going slow, a torturous pace even for himself, but leaving his puppy totally destroyed was his priority at the moment.
"I'm not giving up. Because there's nothing to give up.", The blonde's hurt look almost made Harry want to take those words back, but… it was the truth. "I just need this to end, because I don't... I can't have another year with this shadow hanging over me."
"Oh, no, slut. You don't get to pretend like that, you fucking whore. You called me daddy, and that's what you're going to call me for now on."
And Harry came back on top of Draco, now facing him, and wiped away the tears that smeared his face with his tongue. Holding the blonde's cock, he slowly descended the length of the member, placing it all inside him. He threw his head back, moaning long and languidly, and heard something coming from beneath him.
"I thought we could stay in the Slytherin communal.", Screams of 'what' and 'are you crazy?' were heard.
"You heard the dare, are you going to back down?", Pansy smiled that little smile that meant she wanted entertainment.
The pace was intense, fluid and delicate. Draco had so many different feelings, but the only thing he could do was to whisper words of encouragement and affection in Harry's ear.
When Draco finished talking to the Death Eater at the Mansion, he found himself sprawled on the couch in Severus' office. The Potions Master was in a dark mood, searching his drawers for something.
"I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to, I don't want …", Draco ran his hands through the other's messy hair, lost, not knowing how to comfort him.
Sirius entered the room in his dog form only to find his godson on his knees between his boyfriend's legs. He let out a howl and ran away, leaving an extremely embarrassed young couple behind.
"Enough. We are not going to talk about it, what happened, happened. And we're not going to have much more time, right?", Draco shook his head and pushed the tray towards Harry, who took a spoon and started eating. "Tell me, how are things out there?"
"Look at me.", The blonde whispered, seeing the green eyes focus on him. Without thinking twice, he took the almost hard member in his mouth, feeling it grow stiffer and moaning around him. He let coherent thoughts get out of his head, and let instincts take over. Her lover's strangled groans echoed through the room.
