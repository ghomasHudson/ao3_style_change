“Tis not Master Draco’s decision to make.”

want. Do you want freedom? Do you want the right to make your own decisions?”
What did apologies matter in the end anyway?
Draco elbowed them both as Potter’s face turned an unattractive shade of red and he jerked out of their hold.
“It’s fun.”
“Sirius told you that there was nothing more important than learning to close your mind.”
“You probably would be,” Draco mutters. He sighs at Potter’s put-out expression. “I can get you one if you like.”
“Dobby missed Draco.”
or some such rot. I think they made up a charge just to get him out of the way. After that he stuck to the speaker’s box on Compton Common, so at least people here were informed.”
“It’s an

It was worth a shot.
even took the Dark Mark,
“I never thought someone like you could want someone like me,” Draco says. It’s quiet in the still room and now that the heady passion has finally abated, it seems like a time for truths. The watery moonlight slips through the cracks in the blinds and gives the room a ghostly glow.

“I didn’t choose my wand yesterday, you know?” Sirius said as he pushed Draco further down the hall. “You just wanted to rile her up in an attempt to rile me up.”
Harry laughs. “Come on, then.” He gives the fleshy part of Draco’s upper thigh a swat. “Hands and knees.”
“As long as you have studied the theory—”
“You order the food, I’ll take a shower.”
Before Draco could try and come up with something witty or slightly comforting to say, Potter looked up at him through his lashes, and suddenly he couldn’t remember his line of thought.
got the homosexual bit right, I really would recommend that book and I’d like to order some food because I’m hungrier than a Hippogriff on a Gamp’s Decidedly Dreary Diet.”
“You didn’t know what you were doing.”
“You question my stance? It should be obvious where my loyalties lie.”
Draco reminds himself. Different by design, different by choice, different because he’s
intently. His stomach lurched at the report. 10 convicted inmates escaped. He read over the names with a heavy heart until he came across one that had anger mounting.
Snuffles let out an odd noise as Lupin shook his head rapidly. “Lupin is fine. Mister Lupin doesn’t quite fit me.”
“Pig isn’t so bad.” Harry grins and gives Draco a searing look, his eyes dark with desire. “I can’t bloody wait to see you again.”
Draco tilted until he could put his head on Potter’s shoulder.
“This might not mean anything to you, but I can see a difference, and I think it suits you.”
in the battered satchel he carries everywhere, pointedly not looking at Draco. “I think your opinion of what makes an easy life differs to mine from the sounds of it. There’s nothing easy about a life unlived.”
or when coming out becomes
“We would, would we?” Harry’s smile widens, and he leans in close to Draco, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s ear. “Do you think you might find it difficult to keep professional, Malfoy? With all that nakedness, leather and oil.”
“Thank you.” He wiped his eyes on the back of his hand and revelled in the knowledge that it would have made his father cringe.
“You know,” Longbottom began, a mischievous glint to his eyes. “I’m in the market for a Slytherin friend.”
A mess, that’s exactly what he wanted to voice, but couldn’t. Draco was a mess, and he wasn’t sure how to change that.
Silence settled around them, and it was peaceful in a way that their lives weren’t.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, eyes still on Potter. “I didn’t listen to Hagrid’s instructions, ended up insulting the Hippogriff. My fault, really.”
The sound of Weasley laughing as he walked away was enough for Draco to realize he had done well. He had gotten involved in issues that had nothing to do with him and spoke when unneeded, but still—he had helped, and that was he had set out to do.
“I tripped over a tree root,” came Weasley’s angry reply.
“Well, how about you let me know when you decide,” Lovegood said with a snap of the magazine before she eyed them closely.
Wood cleared his throat, drawing their attention.
Severus cleared his throat before he looked at Draco closely. “He died sometime during the war. Not too long after you were born.”
He did know.
“Endurance?” Karkaroff’s eyes narrowed as he frowned.
“Ah, yes.” Draco gives Potter a sharp smile over his coffee. “Sebastian and Seamus.”
Large eyes widened before a snap of fingers had his bedside curtains closing.
Neville sighed, the sound not pleased but also not annoyed.
“Fuck dinner,” Harry says. “Ron and Hermione will understand. Let’s go back to mine.”
. Not anymore. They have already unearthed every possible secret and thrown every slur in his direction. Now, Draco is ready to fight back.
Potter tilted his head and eyed him with a quirk of his lips, and Draco wasn’t sure what to make of that.
Harry raises his eyebrows at Draco. “I wasn’t alone in the last one.”
concerned about people having a difference of opinion? Could no one have a free thought without being shunned or made to be seen as a lunatic?
Draco looked around curiously as the majority of his housemates in his year converged on the Quidditch pitch. It didn't make sense considering they didn't have practice until later in the week. It wasn't until a flash of red robes took to the sky that it made sense—the Gryffindors were practicing.
When the Patronus faded, Draco sighed in disappointment. But as he looked at the bright grin Neville sent him, he understood exactly where that warmth had come from.
Draco’s breath hitches. “Well some people are idiots.”
sign hanging over Compton Common. A half-finished stage in the Common, announces bands like
“Can you keep a secret?” Potter leans forward, the air of a co-conspirator about him. It makes the moment intimate and warm.
The way Potter’s eyes regarded him intently unnerved Draco. He wasn’t sure what Potter was looking for. The truth? A lie?
But none of that was the same pain as Regulus. Some people would look at Regulus’ mistakes and think the pain was justified—that it was his own fault. But that’s not what growth was about. Mistakes were a part of life, and no one is sin free. No one.
“It’s real.”
Lovegood smiled before she nodded her head rapidly. “And you are Draco Malfoy. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“Theory of the spell would have sufficed,” Draco mumbled, unable to restrain himself.
“Depends on your perception,” Lovegood murmured as she leafed through the
“You shouldn’t bait him so much.”
Neville raised his hand, and Draco wished that he wouldn’t. Not with this lesson.
“The sun has finally risen on Little Compton Street,” Draco says. He pulls out of Harry’s grasp and presses a kiss to his cheek, lingering long enough to breathe in the familiar, soapy scent of him. “I’m planning to get outrageously drunk.”
But it was nice that someone bothered to try at all.
Intrigue filled Draco as Potter nodded. Most people wouldn’t wish to not be in Potter’s position.
“Why won’t you practice with me?”
Muggleborns helped in the Ministry to run laws and decrees that ensured that magical creatures stay the minority.
Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry. “What did he really say?”
The tears fell despite Draco’s valiant efforts. “You’re the only family I got,” Draco whispered. “The only true family.”
“Notice what?”
“Put your arms around my neck,” said Draco as he ignored Potter.
If Regulus could learn from his mistakes, then wasn’t that proof that he could have redemption?
He worked really hard,
“Hey!” Potter yelled behind him. “It’s dangerous out there.”
“Maybe people want what they don’t have,” Draco continued, uncomfortable with the way Weasley watched him. “It’s a human thing to do, I think.”
Potter opened his mouth only to close it again as a cycle of the same motion repeated.
“I’m sorry.”
When they were a few feet apart, he lowered his voice.
Realising that getting information about Potter’s love life when he’s in this kind of mood is a futile exercise, Draco orders himself something outrageously expensive and tells Potter he can pick up the bill.
Draco closed his eyes. He didn't need the reminder, it wasn't as if he would ever forget—never be able to forget the hatred that used to leave his mouth.
“I hate it when you do that.” Harry’s voice is gruff. “I hate it when you make it sound like you’re worse than me.”
Draco nodded, hating that he couldn’t look to his father, didn’t want to see the hatred that was there.
Harry unbuckles the leather bracelet he always wears and puts it on the bedside table together with the silver ring which he slides off his finger. There’s a deliberate intent to the way he does it, his eyes holding Draco’s as he approaches him. The erotic promise of why Harry’s removing his jewellery steals Draco’s breath from his lungs. They aren’t even touching yet and the energy in the room alone is enough to make Draco’s cock fill in his trousers, as Harry moves closer. A powerful rush of desire slices through him and he takes Harry’s hand in his when they’re finally close enough to touch.
“I’ve received your grades.”
“He loved you,” Draco said with a shaky inhale that rattled when he breathed out. “I don’t know what your relationship was like on a deeper level, but he looked up to you.”
Draco was walking past the shops in Hogsmeade, not really paying attention to his surroundings. Neville had detention with Snape, and that left either waiting around pathetically for him or to go to Hogsmeade alone.
“Remus,” Sirius sighed before he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Aren’t you supposed to be the sensible one?”
, he pondered again before dismissing the thought.
“I wondered if we might see you here one day.” McGonagall frowns at Harry. “I hope that nonsense with the
know about you?”
“Now who has been spending too much time with Trelawney?” Draco drawled, smirking when Weasley laughed.
“It’s not like home,” Neville remarked, gesturing towards their own bleak tent where Draco’s father had peacocks tied out front.
Draco shook his head violently. “Maybe the first lesson, your mind might be more active, but that’s to be expected. But as time passes, you should become more firm in your practices. If your mind is feeling broken into, then there is a problem.”
“Well you did less damage than Lockhart,” Draco said, hoping to cheer Dobby up. “The man is an idiot.”
and you won't miss it ;-)
“Do we?” Potter raises an eyebrow but doesn’t confirm or deny anything.
“I’m not sure yet.”
“Is Longbottom Manor any different?”
The only band to feature twice on the Little Compton Street playlist, Pet Shop Boys and their instantly recognisable British electronic dance pop have long had a history of creating music which has resonated with LGBT communities. Pet Shop Boys formed in the early eighties. Neil Tennant, former writer for British music magazine Smash Hits, was the lyricist and singer, and Chris Lowe played keyboards and programmed the music. They frequently use gender-neutral pronouns in their songs. Dreaming of the Queen is one of a number of their songs which reference AIDS, 'It Couldn't Happen Here' (1987), 'Being Boring' (1990) and 'The Survivors' (1996) being a few of the others. The song references Princess Diana who did enormous amounts of work raising awareness of AIDS and the song pits Diana against the Queen who, like Thatcher (and Reagan in America) was far less responsive to the AIDS crisis. By 1993 when the song was released, 2.5 million AIDS cases that had been reported globally.
“Master Regulus confided in young Master Draco?”
in such a manner.
“I think Minerva will do just fine.” McGonagall extends her hand to him and he shakes it. “You mustn’t be put out by my frank manner. We owe a great deal to you.”
“It was worse than I thought it would be. I could have taken him, you know? But I was there too. A version I don’t want to be.”
They stood in silence; the sounds of the staff and visitors outside drowned out the pleased noises Alice made every time she blew a bubble out of the gum.
“How old was he?”
“Alright, alright.” Draco narrowed his eyes and watched the way Neville held his posture, and how his breathing regulated. “Show me what you got.”
Draco escapes the bustle and slips into the alley by the Christopher Street Inn, stopping in front of the smiling face of Jonathan Ashton. Next to the sign, work is already in progress for a clinic like the one in Dean Street, freshly painted and ready for its opening. Draco looks through the window, his stomach flipping at the sight of the tidy reception and the rows and rows of leaflets ready for visitors to take. This, in part, was his work. Draco’s name is still something people are leery about and even after all this time, the press continues to speculate about whether Draco’s deviant ways were responsible for corrupting Harry Potter. When Draco donates funds he does so anonymously, because anything bearing the name Malfoy is tarnished by the memories of the war. It’s Granger that helped get this project off the ground and put her name behind the work. The only thing Draco has funded that carries any association with the Malfoy family is the St Mungo’s Narcissa Award for young Healers who demonstrate outstanding promise in the field of Muggle medicine.
“I swear I hate you,” Potter grumbled with a smile too bright. “No, you absolute tosser. Thank you for talking to Snape.”
“Anything you would like to tell me?”
This fic, that ice cold
Harry rolls his eyes. “It was mainly because I don’t believe in holding grudges and I think she’s changed. A bit. She even asked after Hermione, through gritted teeth.” He grins at Draco. “I just don’t think she likes me, much.”
“No.” Draco reached out to stop Longbottom from leaving—the action caused a few Gryffindors to narrow their eyes.
“Potter,” Draco called out hesitantly when Potter got up to leave. “I know this won’t make much sense, and I would elaborate if I knew more, but I want to let you know that Black’s house elf has been taking orders from my father.”
“Me too.”
“Oh, brilliant. Thanks.” Harry leans on Draco’s ottoman with a wheeze. He waves his hand. “Love what you’ve done with the place.”
He knew his face was flushed, knew that there was no way around that, but as he looked into pleased eyes, he figured a small amount of embarrassment was an alright price to pay.
“What does that mean?” He was honestly a little worried, Neville’s plans weren’t always the best.
“It feels weird talking about sex with you.” Harry picks at the label on his bottle again, studying it as if it's suddenly fascinating. “Unexpected.”
Draco looked over to see Potter watching them curiously.
When Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled him close, Draco decided that he could forgive him.
“In general, or with you?”
Draco sighed as his mind argued that Regulus’ continued status and actions as a Death Eater overpowered any mental awareness over Regulus’ actions.
Before Neville could appear too smug, Draco pointed towards the plant.
Sure, people had died in the past tournaments, but Diggory’s body looked fine. There were normal marks of a contestant; scratches and cuts, but otherwise the body was preserved.
“Alright,” Draco mumbled as he shrugged once and began to walk away. “But you can’t be disappointed if I’m right. I did warn you.”
Being infamous compared to Potter being famous had given Draco plenty of experience in how the public views people negatively. That was something he would prefer Potter not to face, but as he looked towards the Gryffindor table and watched Potter stab his potatoes viciously with a fork, he knew that it was already too late for that.
“What’s wrong?”
“Well this is awkward,” Draco whispered as he stared at Granger and Potter.
“Not particularly.” Draco gives Potter a look up and down. “Although I don’t dislike Quidditch players, if that’s what you’re asking. I just tend to prefer Seekers.”
Draco pulls a face. It’s so typical of Potter to have people forgive him everything, even getting off with someone else when he’s meant to be engaged. “I expect you’re still pretending to be straight.”
“Look.” Harry relaxes, pushing his own wand into the waist of his jeans. “It’s working.”
The silence that followed was quite nice and Draco had been about to doze off when three shouts jerked him into an upright position.
“I can do that.” Harry’s voice is rough, his eyes dark with arousal. Draco is starting to suspect Harry has a thing for a certain kind of play, with his interest in fingers, toys and fucking. Draco has no complaints about that at all.
In a moment of sharp, biting pleasure, Draco reaches his climax and comes with a grunt. He pushes back against Harry who stills as Draco rides through his climax. Harry slides out of Draco and spreads his hand on Draco’s backside, holding him open. Draco trembles from the force of keeping himself up on shaky legs, but it’s worth every ache in his muscles. He lets out a soft moan of desire when he realises what Harry’s doing. The slap of Harry’s hand against his cock gets faster as he keeps Draco exposed to his gaze. The idea that Harry is getting off looking at where he’s just fucked Draco open, is a dirty, glorious pleasure, which would make Draco want to go again immediately if he had an ounce of energy. Eventually, Harry comes and the heat of his climax hits Draco’s skin. With a murmur of pleasure, Harry runs his fingers along the crack of Draco’s arse, dipping two fingers slowly inside Draco.
When Potter scoffed, he wanted to hex the bloody git.
Draco obliges without hesitation, hissing when Harry parts the cheeks of his backside. “Lube, no prep. Just fuck me, will you?”
“I disagree,” Draco argued. “If the Dark Lord can affect your dreams, then they aren’t real in the context of it being a dream. He’s showing you what he wants you to see. Whether it’s happening or not.”
He couldn’t do it, couldn’t bear the thought of his soon-to-be cousin left with only Malfoy’s prejudiced thoughts. It wouldn’t end well for the baby. It couldn’t.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck. No one had ever talked to him about his mistakes, it was vulnerable, and he didn’t like it.
. The name—Soho Bookshop—looks as though it needs a little updating, weathered by the years with the paint cracked and peeling. “I’ll buy you a drink.”
“I was taking the piss,” Neville said, tone wary.
“Hang it somewhere everyone can see,” Draco says, trying to sound flippant. “Or, alternatively, you might enjoy looking at my face when you’re feeling lonely at night.”
Draco inhaled sharply at the deep tone and elegant vibrato. For years he had wondered what Regulus would have looked like, what he would have sounded like, what he would have been like, and yet the image was nothing as he had imagined.
“Because you’re a sex pest. I’m trying to be serious.”
Umbridge grinned in triumph. “You think I wouldn’t have charms placed around my office after two break-ins?”
It was strange going from someone most people left alone to someone that they wanted to take to the ball. Sure, it was only other Slytherins, but Draco’s declining reputation had given him an assumption that he would be left alone.
Draco looked at the Dark Lord and they locked eyes.
Harry puts a hand on Draco’s back and the warmth of it offers an unexpected assurance that perhaps, on this strange, rainy afternoon in Soho, he feels it too.
Neville rolled his eyes far too slowly to not be dramatic. “I know. You two have issues.”
“I take it the lessons are as they were before?”
“Oh bollocks.” Potter pulls a face. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
Harry’s eyes are warm as he watches Draco. “I think what I ended up with was much better.”
“For now, maybe,” Draco conceded with a shrug. “But when you get married, I’m going to tell every guest that I was right and that I knew this would happen.”
“Yes, father. I’ll be better.”
They stared at him for a moment, each glancing back towards the Hippogriff—most likely they had heard some of his conversation.
“Five, sir,” Dobby said as he raised his hand.
Draco grinned despite himself. “I’d like that.”
“I hear the South of France is lovely at this time of year, if you’re hiding from the press.”
“I apologize, I was making sure everything was in order before my departure tomorrow.”
“No, you weren’t.” Harry picks up Draco’s hand and checks his watch. “Do you know we’ve been on this date for over twenty-four hours? It’s four in the afternoon.”
“Oh, that.” Harry grins around his bottle and some of the tension leaves his body. “Yeah, well. I do.”
“But McGonagall said that it’s tradition—”
Potter stopped at the top of the stairs, puffs of air could be heard as he panted, wide eyes stared down at him before they narrowed in concern.
“If you ever want to learn some practice methods with me, I am here,” Draco offered hesitantly.
“Neville?”
Potter nodded several times, hard enough to have his unruly hair falling forward. “I’d like to.”
“No, I’m going to need more.” He pulled Potter back to him. Restrictions had never been something Draco could listen well to, not when part of him always ached to fight back. Limiting it to one kiss would never do. Not after knowing what kissing Potter felt like.
With each word Dumbledore spoke, Umbridge became paler and paler until her face was ashen, and her hands trembled.
“Any further lessons of the same nature will allow the students an alternative option available. The Ministry has been notified, but I doubt they will do anything to him.”
“She is?” Draco never expected to feel happy at the news of another Weasley in the world, but he does. Harry’s enthusiasm is infectious, and he makes a mental note to send flowers. “There’s also your crup.”
that she was smart, but this was something else altogether. Smart, perceptive, and knowledgeable in means of resources.
“It’s an improvement, whatever it is,” Neville said happily as he clapped his hands. His expression turned soft when he looked up at Draco.
“When the fuck did you get so evasive?”
“Is this what you couldn’t tell me? Is that diary my fathers? Has he caused the whole thing?”
Draco smirks at Harry. “You were paying attention.”
“There’s nothing small about property in this part of town.”
“It’s offensive too. Disarming someone is just as much of a defence for you as it is a hindrance to them.”
“Does the distinction matter?” Lovegood asked curiously as she looked up at the ceiling.
“You can stay with me.”
“I thought maybe I’d fuck you tonight. If you want.” Harry’s gaze drops to Draco’s lips, his tongue running over his own. “I’ve been thinking about it since you came over.”
“I think it’s a crup.”
Food Fair Funk gon' give it to you
The pull of Dobby’s magic had disappeared near Dumbledore’s office, Draco just hoped he would still be there.
Draco’s eyes opened when they separated. Seeing Potter so close only had him shaking his head.
A low whistle escaped Draco.
“That’s rather Slytherin of you,” Lovegood interrupted.
“Well,” Draco looked around as he wished he hadn’t come over in the first place. “I’m going to go, but—uh—I guess I’ll see you around?”
“Potter,” he tried again.
“I already said I don’t know. You send some dirty messages, have a wank.” Draco tries to sound bored and moves away from an elderly couple giving him a very odd look.
One side of Draco’s lips quirked up as he tried to figure Potter out.
“Ah.” McGongall's expression flares with understanding and she glances at Wil. “They were the life and soul of the party on the handful of occasions they came here, although they tended to favour different locations to us.”
Draco looked to his hands, unwilling to see any triumph in Weasley’s eyes when his cheeks felt hotter.
The sentiment was nice, but Draco couldn't help but feel like somewhere the distinction didn't matter. There would always be people who wouldn't think like Neville.
Draco shrugged once before explaining. “Any information could be of use later down the line.”
“Back then I hated anyone and anything that was Dark. I fought so hard to prove myself to the people around me. I wanted to distance myself from my family, and I left my brother behind because he didn’t want the same things. If he wasn’t going to fight with me, then I was going to fight without him.”
. Draco thinks to himself with a smile. Harry was
A glance towards Madam Pince showed she was watching him closely and with suspicion, but Draco wasn’t sure how to ask for what he wanted. She wasn’t exactly a nice person.
“Bloody hell,” Harry says. His gaze is focused on Draco’s lips, his cheeks lightly flushed. He flicks his tongue over his lips and clears his throat. “That’s...”
“We’ll go there last,” Harry decides. “We’ll go there…after.” He seems overwhelmed, his jaw set definitely and his eyes hungry as he takes in the other options. “How about the Christopher Street Inn?” He takes a breath as if he needs to compose himself and gives Draco another one of his lopsided smiles that do peculiar things to Draco’s insides. “Pub crawl?”
“Either you’re off to sleep, or I’ll take it as a yes.” Harry sounds amused. He makes his way down Draco’s body, holding him open.
and yet the entire room is somehow still full of it. It’s like the pulse of Muggle music in one of those busy clubs where you can feel the bass through your feet.
much.”
“Why?” The disgusted tone had Draco’s lips tilting downward slightly.
Draco tries not to react as Harry’s warm fingers brush against his own when he takes the diary. It seems important to treat it carefully, and he makes sure that he doesn’t handle the faded parchment too roughly. The words slant forward in bold, precise script. It’s as if Black was in a hurry when he wrote this entry, the sentences punctuated with exclamation marks and blots of ink that have long since lost their crisp sharpness.
“Bloody
“A very good one. Thank you.” Harry puts the blasted portrait down and pulls Draco into a firm kiss. “Everything okay?”
One kiss turned into two, three and then quickly into many more. He knew if given the opportunity, he could get lost in Potter—something he wanted to explore. The kiss was familiar but different, because they were different. It made him wonder if their kisses would always be like that. Would it change on the mood? Change with each breath they took?
Draco knew that Neville had a hard time with lessons as it was, but he couldn’t look into excited eyes and offer anything but an affirmative. If Neville wanted to teach him, then who was he to deny that?
“You must know that he doesn’t fit into the vision of my future. Well—” He corrected when Granger opened her mouth angrily. “The vision my father sees. Potter is this beacon, he’s bright and alluring. We all need light at some point. But my father doesn’t see it that way, he’s in the business of destroying other people’s light, you see.”
isn’t this new bloke of yours, is he? Weasley mentioned he’s moon-eyed over someone.”
“I told you, I saw it.”
“Snape said I didn’t have the scores to become a curse-breaker.”
“Sirius!” Potter yelled loudly. “Sirius are you there?”
“I think you do care what Harry thinks. I think you care far more than you want to believe.”
“I should, but I don’t want to.”
“If your expectations aren’t high, then nothing can disappoint you.”
“And what’s theory going to do in the real world?” Potter asked, voice louder than necessary, eyes angry and narrowed.
“So, not for at least a week,” Fred surmised with a happy hum.
“You know,” Potter began with a tilt of his head. “Despite your words, you seem to have already chosen who you are.”
Draco didn’t need Dobby’s nod of approval to know it would be. His father never did anything good, even his charitable donations were shrouded in thinly veiled threats.
Draco snorts. “No. I haven’t. You?”
“The thing is—well it’s Hermione’s doing, Ron’s too, I suppose. They think that Umbridge is a rotten teacher—”
“It just seems so unlikely,” Granger added. “How could Voldemort have gotten hold of Sirius when he’s been in Grimmauld Place all this time?”
Most of his path had been both singular in the direction and in means of comfort—it had been lonely. But going forward would be filled with many people; people who cared about him and wanted to be there.
Something told Draco that Regulus would have been alright with that decision.
“Perhaps.” Draco wets his lips and studies Greg, finally taking a decision. “I’ve actually been spending some time with Potter.”
“You disappoint me, Draco.”
Draco nodded as he placed an arm around Neville’s shoulder and pulled him forward.
Someone they wouldn’t doubt, someone they could look at and only see Draco—not the Malfoy heir, not Lucius’ son. No, they would see Draco Malfoy and that would be it.
“Patil was afraid of a mummy,” Draco began as he tried to get Lupin to understand. “Thomas was afraid of a severed hand. Weasley was afraid of spiders, and Finnigan was afraid of a Banshee.”
Draco furrowed his brows. “I’m—”
“You can laugh,” Lovegood misunderstood. “But it’s just like the Blibbering Humdinger and the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. People used to think that that they didn’t exist.”
, you don’t even have any glamours up!” Draco shook his head in disappointment. “I’m all for breaking the rules, but not if you’re going to get
“No way he fought You-Know-Who.”
“Besides.” Harry stops underneath the awning from the markets which are closing upd, tugging Draco close. “I wouldn’t want to give you anymore average blow jobs.”
“Professor,” Draco interrupted, looking away from angry eyes. “I didn’t want the other students to have to meet him too.”
When Draco arched a brow—grateful that his practice had paid off and it worked—Potter shrugged sheepishly.
“Forget who we are? I’ll just be Harry, and you can just be Draco?”
“She, er, seems close with you.”
. Umbridge was far more dangerous than he had originally assumed.
Draco rather liked Potter’s imperfections—liked them a lot; liked him a lot.
“Do you think that people can change internally but not on the outside?”
“Filthy,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s lips “Absolutely filthy.”
The sound of Potter and Lupin laughing drowned out Black’s objections.
“Young Master Malfoy wants Kreacher’s help? Not an… order?”
“Anything you say.” Harry does as Draco asks, taking off the last of his clothes. He stretches out on the bed and pops open the lube, making no attempt to hide the fact he’s drinking in every inch of Draco as he strips.
As soon as Draco hid behind a tree, he realized that it was already occupied.
Draco isn’t sure Harry is entirely convincing, but he lets it slide. “How long are you off for?”
“Potter, I’m alright.”
Draco angrily threw rocks into the great lake as the tension built the longer he thought of his father. Threatening Hagrid in court in the name of ‘caring’ about him was a farce, they both knew it. Interesting that his father could pretend to care in public but couldn’t do a damn thing in private.
When Neville flushed, Draco sat up quickly.
Potter narrowed his eyes at Draco, and he knew he would have to choose his words carefully.
“I have no idea. You’re my only contact, remember?”
. His owl and the portraits in the Manor are little compensation for talking about everything without a filter. Perhaps he will get in touch with Greg, after all. They don’t have to meet in the heart of Diagon Alley in full view of the
which sprung up seemingly from nowhere and fashionable boutiques selling everything from branded underpants (
“My business is my own,” Draco whispered, hoping Severus wouldn’t be too offended.
“Is the reason why something that you are willing to share with me?”
He allowed himself to enjoy the afterglow of Draco's salubrious blowjob for a few moments longer, and the question of exactly
“Society treats me the same way. I never know who they expect me to be, never know what image I am to live up to. Am I the omen they want to paint me as? Or am I just living by my own credence? I honestly don’t know anymore.”
“While they may have improved in certain areas, they are still not as high as they should be.”
“Afraid not.” Once again, Potter doesn’t elaborate.
When her mouth parted, he knew she would understand what he was implying. Her face twisted into an expression he had only seen her use when speaking to Potter.
The glare Alpsi gave him had Draco biting his tongue. It wouldn’t be smart to show the house elves a kindness that they didn’t want.
Draco leaned forward and gestured as if he had a secret to tell.
“You care about me?”
Draco took a step back as the urge to vomit overcame him.
One of them clutched their chest and tried to swoon as best as they could while still holding onto Draco.
Draco knocked on Severus’ office door aware of exactly what he would be facing once inside.
Seeing the castle grounds with someone else changed the outlook on
Draco lifted his hands in the air. He didn’t understand it any better than Regulus did.
“You’re welcome.” Draco studies his nearly empty bottle, before draining the last of his lager. “More booze?”
“For what it’s worth,” Lupin called as Draco walked to the door. “I think you would have gotten rid of the Boggart.”
The barman laughs under his breath and then looks around the quiet bar. “You don’t have to get Malfoy here putting baby oil on your chest just to get information that by rights you should already know. Justin! Come and take over for a bit, will you? I’m showing our VIPs around.”
Draco makes his way straight to Harry’s bedroom, because he can’t be bothered to keep up any kind of pretence he’s not here to pick up exactly where they left off.
“Find me when you are done?” Harry asked, eyes searching Draco’s.
“Yeah, Malfoy,” Granger said as her lips quivered. “Does it matter?”
“I might just take you up on that. You teach Neville well.”
“The Black family.”
“Good men,” McGonagall says. “They were good men. That's enough, isn't it?”
“Like lots of things,” Draco says. He gives Harry a careful look. “Boxes of memories,
“It’s unknown how he died.”
“It was still contact. You could have read between the lines. Besides, my mother saved your life, you ungrateful pillock.” Draco folds his arms and glares at Harry. “I don’t care if you think none of us deserved your help, but hearing you’ve been cosying up to Parkinson does rather single me out as the person you couldn’t be bothered to respond to. I’ve lived in the same country as you for years, and written multiple letters of complaint to you. You couldn’t be bothered to Fire Call to give me the option of kissing your heroic backside to make life a bit better for myself?”
Severus arched a brow—something Draco was trying to teach himself in the mirror. It was rather difficult.
There was still so much to Regulus that Draco didn’t know, and he wanted to get to know him, wanted to get to know the only person who could relate to Draco so well.
Draco makes his way to the bar and is surprised by how much colder everything feels without the pulse of Harry’s warm magic humming next to him.
Draco covered his face as the tears began to fall. “I just wanted a friend, and I made you be that for me. I’m so sorry.”
Several hands shot up, but Draco was content observing.
“You should go,” Draco whispered, eyes on Potter’s lips.
“Sounds like a childhood fantasy.”
“Anything?”
,” Blaise said in a laugh that was full of disbelief. “I’d be awake all night if we were to really go there.”
Draco jerked his head. “I’m still learning how to be better. It’s not a one-time thing nor is it enough to be conscious of the system; I have to work every single day at being someone else. Perhaps I’m not the best person to teach you this considering it hasn’t been long for my own reformed thoughts. If you want a true explanation, you’ll have to ask Hagrid. Someone who has personally lived through the hatred, the oppression and the prejudice. It’s his voice that matters, his experiences, not mine.”
“How long will they last?”
. He smirks at the innuendo and keeps his voice to the crisp, cultured drawl he knows previous partners have found particularly pleasing. Talking dirty is something Draco excels at, and he isn’t going to let the fact it’s Harry Potter on the receiving end put him off his stride. Draco leans closer to Harry, his lips close to Harry’s ear, dropping his hand onto Harry’s shoulder.
The Yule Ball suddenly didn’t seem so bad.
“Normally, I’d say it’s just how the world is, but that’s a terrible answer. I think part of it is that people are uneducated. They don’t realize that they were born with advantages and privileges that others don’t have. It’s not something that’s usually noticed until pointed out. Even if they aren’t cruel, they still benefit from those circumstances.”
“I was going to.” When Potter arched his brows, Draco hastily continued. “Eventually.”
Part of Draco realized that he must need human interaction more if he was really talking to the Hippogriff.
“You want to break the law, be my guest,” Draco said as he looked around the room. “But we are all witnesses, and if you think my father will accept harm done to his
“I didn’t think.” Draco drops the wards, allowing Potter to stumble through. “I couldn’t imagine any reason for you to want to come to the Manor.”
He couldn’t wait to find out.
A single soul who took the chance that was offered and ran with it, and Draco certainly was going to take that chance.
When Potter’s grip weakened, Draco leaned forward the rest of the way and discovered what it felt like to kiss Potter again. Potter’s lips were still chapped, the pressure of their mouths was just as soft, and the build-up of intensity was still there.
Draco wouldn’t have it any other way.
“What are you on about?” Draco asked as he fought the urge to look at Neville, he wanted to continue to watch the clouds. They were on their backs on the Quidditch pitch, looking at the sky.
“A Hippogriff slashed me.”
Draco is so annoyed he almost scalds himself on his fresh coffee. He makes a show of unfolding his paper and puts it in front of his face, pretending to read.
Draco took a step back at the sound of Potter’s voice. He pushed Neville behind backwards to allow him the chance to wipe his eyes.
Harry reclined onto his elbows, slightly arching his back and further spreading his thighs. Draco's grip loosened as he swallowed Harry's length deeper, harder. In the low light Harry watched the rhythmic movements of Draco's head, listening to the steady stream of small grunts and slurps, before allowing his own head to fall backward.
“I want to get you stretched on the bed,” Harry says. “Where I was getting so damn hard thinking about you bossing me around.”
Harry chuckled a bit ruefully and rubbed the back of his neck, almost dislodging his beanie which protected him from the ice-cold wind. “But — and please don’t get me wrong, Charlie — I just can’t commit to anything right now. I need my life to not be planned out for once. Maybe I’ll realise later that this is it for me, dragon tamer and all that, and I’ll come back. Or maybe I’ll play Quidditch professionally. Or I’ll get my NEWTs and become an Auror. Who knows?
“Okay.” Harry laughs, the sound warm and comforting. “You still have to take those pictures of me in leather and baby oil for Little Compton Street, anyway. We can put those up.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. I don’t have to be you. I can be someone else.”
“I am surprised you are taking offence. Especially given your own upbringing.”
“You’re going to have to get yourself off like this.” Harry slides his hand over Draco’s cock, fondling his balls and then strokes back behind them to press against him again. “Yeah?”
Draco sighed as he tried not to become angry with them. He knew it would take a lot to change the world—he just wished it wasn’t so daunting.
Harry tried to breathe evenly and control his nerves. He knew he could do it, he’d been helping Charlie for months now and had treated a few dragon injuries. But, Leonora was in a different size category all together.
This pub is named after the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, an iconic London gay bar and South London’s oldest surviving gay venue. In 2015 the building was listed as a site of historic importance to LGBT communities. Rumour has it that Princess Diana, who did a significant amount of work on HIV and AIDS related causes, was smuggled into the RVT by Freddie Mercury and Kenny Everett, disguised as a boy. The pub staged a play about that night as part of LGBT History Month in 2015
“Are you alright?” Potter rushed down the stairs faster than Draco expected, and before he could register that, Potter pulled him away from Dobby and led him to a room that resembled a study. His mind went back to the one he had just left, and he couldn’t help but flinch.
“They remind me of myself.”
, Draco wants to say.
Draco blinked rapidly before he dramatically laid back on the bed with a flop.
Right?
“Potter is taking
Draco closed the book with a snap and pushed it away harder than necessary. He was ready to give up, wanted to cease looking, but every time he tried to, thoughts of Regulus entered his mind.
“You weren’t tempted to stay?” New York is a city that's always fascinated Draco, with its bright lights and distinctive Manhattan skyline.
Draco nodded as his eyes stung. “My name is Draco Malfoy.”
“Legilimency is used to infiltrate the mind. It’s a spell that allows the user entry. If there are no defences, a Legilimens can break open any secret, see into every dream, and learn valuable information.”
Love.
Draco took a step forward as he held up his hands in a placating manner.
“I know I am proud of you.”
When Draco glanced up, he caught a small shake of Potter’s head as he smiled.
He finds a spot to Apparate from unnoticed, and goes to sleep that night dreaming of Harry, rainbow flags and trying to find the way out of one of the dusty, locked-up bars of Little Compton Street.
Draco smiled softly, the smirk he intended to give falling easily. “You really should have.”
“Are you disappointed that I am?” Harry looks curiously at Draco, his mug of tea half-way to his lips.
“That too.” Harry laughs, and he nuzzles Draco’s neck, licking the spot where his pulse beats before pulling back. “I think I like you debauched. When I’m fingering you, or putting my cock inside you, it feels like I’m ruffling you up a bit.”
“There’s no one here.” Potter takes the paper back and unfolds it, showing it to Draco so he can see the pictures have been charmed so they don’t move. “See? Just like any other paper. I’m a wizard, you see and there’s this stuff called magic—”
“Why?” Potter asked finally. “Does this have something to do with your letter?”
“Thing?”
“Your father?”
“You’re Luna Lovegood.”
“Are you sure this is a stance you wish to take? I will have to send this back to your father.”
he was intending to dress as, but Draco repeatedly dodged the question. In the last few weeks his answers had been less creative, and so non-committal and vague that Harry was starting to wonder if he was even going to attend, or instead spend the evening hiding under their duvet with a bottle of firewhisky, pretending the world didn't exist.
“It doesn’t work like that.” Draco shrugs. “It wasn’t as if we made a collective decision. People started to leave. Theo went to work for an investment bank in Hong Kong. He was the first to go. He was always close to Blaise and when he went to visit Theo, he came back full of stories of a different world. It showed him there was more to life than Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and the people who whispered about us wherever we went. He’s fluent in enough languages that he could move to Europe. He ended up taking a job in Milan. I think he spent some time in Spain and Portugal too, and now he’s back in Italy.”
Potter clears his throat. “He owed me a favour.”
Draco's assurances his outfit was a
Grubbly-Plank walked around the clearing and began answering questions, effectively stopping any further questions from Umbridge. It was a subtle tactic, and Draco rather admired that.
Sure, his father was largely responsible, but that didn’t mean Draco
“You never knew me, Weasley,” Draco pointed out as he looked away. “But I came in contact with someone who taught me how to be better, and I’m trying to listen.”
“Remind me when you were nice?” Blaise asked in an annoyingly amused tone. “I must have been absent.”
“Malfoy.”
don’t and that’s the wonderful thing right now.” Harry grinned happily and kicked snow into the path in front of them.
The response seems to make Harry even more turned on, his hands clenching the sheets as he speaks through gritted teeth.
Drawing attention to the letters wouldn’t end well. Part of Draco wanted to hoard the knowledge and never let go, but he knew that one day it would be revealed. It had to. Severus deserved to hear about the latest letter—or any of them really.
“No.” Harry’s smile steals Draco’s breath from. “Not a coffee, anyway.”
“You know, I don’t know why I bother. You are such a prat.”
“None of that matters.”
“Does it make me a bad person to be grateful that it wasn’t Potter that died?” The dog laid down and placed his head on Draco’s knee.
“Malfoy shoved him into the fireplace.”
When the paper quoted his father, Draco's fingers clenched.
“Alpsi was punished, Master Draco. To erase the punishment would erase the lesson in the action.”
Potter cleared his throat as he glared at Weasley.
“Can you believe she took
I'm too hot (hot damn)
“No, that’s how I interpreted it.”
Draco ran down the stairs as he hoped the rest of the class wouldn’t have gone too far.
“I know that he gave you a locket the night he died.”
“I want you to tie me up and ride my cock,” Harry offers. His voice is rough, his fingers sliding from Draco before he pushes them back inside. He whispers a lubricating charm, clearly not interested in stopping for long enough to do things the Muggle way. “I want to watch you come when you’re riding me, you can make a mess of me. Have me lick you out before to get you ready. I bet you’d look so damn good like that.”
When Potter shifted, Draco realized his words might have seemed like he had been implying something negative.
Moody narrowed his good eye but didn’t push the issue—Draco chalked it up as a win.
“Is it the spell itself that has you not wanting to try?” Potter asked, pretending to be reading as Draco finished outlining his Charms essay.
“Are you alright? If you don’t want the wrapper, I can keep it instead.”
Potter seems unphased by Draco’s needling. “Don’t you think it’s strange we ended up in the same place at the same time when there must be a million bars in this city?”
Draco opened his eyes, only to stare down at the hand holding his own. He wasn’t sure he was ready to talk to Black. Every time his eyes zeroed in on him, he wondered if that was how Regulus would have looked too. Had the brothers been as close in appearances as they had been in age? The ratty tapestry in the Manor was old and cracked and did nothing to show what Regulus might have looked like.
“Kreacher?”
Draco closed his eyes but opened them immediately when all he could see was Diggory’s dead body.
“Damnit.”
“And—wait, in theory?”
“Liar.” It was mumbled, but his awareness began to slip as sleep took over, and Draco wasn’t sure what Dobby said in return, but he felt a warmth on his forehead briefly before there was nothing.
Longbottom shoved him lightly but regarded him evenly.
He looked up to peer at Potter. Had he been the anonymous source? Did that mean that Black
One of Potter’s best qualities was that he understood, even when it was out of his comfort zone, he still
Draco got up, wishing he hadn’t lost control in front of Potter, but there was nothing to be done about it.
With anger rolling through him, Draco pushes his way to the crowds. He sees someone taking poppers on the dancefloor and for a minute he’s tempted to give in to that heady, dizzying rush of euphoria that can strip everything else away for a moment’s sweet oblivion. In the end, he keeps moving until he gets to the bathroom. He takes a piss and washes his hands, cursing Harry under his breath. The night which started out with such tentative promise has quickly become a sharp reminder of the gulf that exists between Draco and Harry; the way they are perceived by those around them and the futility of hoping that there could ever be anything other than a tentative friendship between them. A restless desire to go cruising tugs at Draco, a need to go somewhere where he can be anonymous and focus solely on sensation for a while. He has half a mind to leave Potter here with his adoring fans, so Draco can lose himself to pleasure and chase away the sense that he isn’t good enough at Chariots, Sweatbox or Pleasuredrome.
“This is bloody stupid,” Draco whispered, hand raised to warily pat the Hippogriff’s head. “I’m sure you’re nice, you don’t really look it, but looks can be deceiving.”
“How are things with Millicent?”
“Thanks.” Harry laughs. “This mystery bloke of mine probably shouldn’t leave his expensive shoes lying around, then. Or he should stop being such a snob and try a pair of trainers for a change.”
A noise had Draco looking up. Potter was watching them closely, but his eyes were narrowed.
“Dobby checked them, sir!” Dobby said as he clapped his hands once. “Regulus Black sent them, he did.”
“It’s always been empty when I’ve been there.”
don’t have to be.”
As Neville set the plant down—which suspiciously looked like a bulb of a Venomous Tentacula—Draco braced himself for impact.
Moral fibre? Draco was positive only Potter would’ve been able to pull that off.
. I know he doesn’t like me because of my father, but I just want a chance to prove myself. I’m

“On a fucking brolly?” Harry asks, scandalised.
“Luna and I can stand at both ends of the hallway,” Neville offered. “I can make up an excuse.”
“I thought I heard Harry yelling.”
Draco’s lips twitched. It was unusual to have a protector.
When Draco leaned forward slightly, he realized she was reading the
Draco blinked rapidly, not expecting that answer. “And you believe that?”
“Then maybe it’s an owl?”
Harry gives her a look, but Draco doesn’t care. If a waspish hello is the worst he gets all night, he’s doing pretty well.
The screams of people nearby had Draco’s heart clenching. “I can’t. He’ll expect me to be here.”
“It’s okay to want freedom,” Draco promised. “I told you that I would find a way to free you, but it looks like that was unnecessary.”
Draco felt his face flush and he wished he knew which one was which, as to properly hex the idiot.
“Maybe he do—”
“Besides,” Theo continued, and Draco let out a frustrated growl at being ignored. “We all know Draco has a thing for Potter.”
“I don’t know.” Severus looked down at the desk, eyes hard. “I would like to think so. I’ll never receive redemption to the public eye. I know this, and I won’t ever bother trying for them. But for me? I try. Even if I die without a normalized version of redemption—I did what I could in the end, and that’s all I can do.”
“Regardless, you could use some Gryffindor backup.”
have one.”
“Alright.” It was voiced several minutes later. “You will pry for any information that can be used against Longbottom, or any upcoming movements.”
“You said you liked to make people wait,” Harry points out. If he’s aiming for innocent, he’s fucking terrible at it. He looks filthy, as if he wants to go to bed and have a long, thorough, shag. “I was being good.”
Draco shrugs. “Firstly, I’m not sure you would be able to stop them when you can’t keep them at bay yourself, and second it doesn’t matter what you say. Everyone will think I have you under
“Sorry,” Draco apologized. “Didn’t expect anyone to be there.”
“Very clever, Malfoy.” Harry winks at him. “Still, having been undercover quite a bit since the war I don’t think there’s any harm in trying to have a bit of fun at the same time.”
Draco nodded tersely, wishing he could ignore the calculating look in Severus’ eyes.
“I don’t know if I know who I am,” Potter admitted, voice barely above a whisper.
“All work and no play, Malfoy.” Potter has the cheek to shake his head as if Draco is somehow lacking in the fun department. “Did you put your number in here?”
“Dobby, I wouldn’t force you to tell me your secrets. That’s not—I’m not—” he closed his eyes as he realized that it wasn’t just Muggleborns and Muggles that he needed to open his horizon to. The road to understanding would be a harder path than he originally believed it to be.
“Thank you,” Draco told her, eyes watching as she smiled before stepping closer to Neville.
The exit of the Weasley twins was something Draco knew he would always remember. Not only had they made a swamp of the corridors, they had also flown out of the castle on their brooms, but not before throwing out another round of fireworks.
A few heads turned, probably hoping to see a fight—something that hadn’t happened since the beginning of their first year.
Draco orders his preferred wine and waits for the drinks to be poured, following Harry into a private little nook at the back of the bar. He glances at Harry. “No chips?”
“I didn’t know that,” Draco promised, not liking the distance. “I’ve only just found out. I don’t know what it does, but I can promise you that it’s nothing good. You need to get rid of it.”
“This?” Potter blinks at his jumper and scowls at Draco. “What’s wrong with it?”
“Yeah.” Potter breathes out as he studies Draco like he’s a particularly complicated piece of Arithmancy. “Maybe.”
.” There was a twinge of desperation in Neville’s voice and it had Draco worried.
“I imagine he doesn’t know the half of that history if he’s Muggle.” Draco studies his coffee. “Why was he so eager to set you up, anyway?”
He ignored the startled looks from his friends—Merlin, did Granger and Weasley count as friends?
Draco ignored Pansy and chose to sit near the edge of the table to wait for Neville.
He had thought, when he read
“But,” Potter began in a tone of authority. “Having certain people nearby can make the fact that life is unfair enjoyable.”
.” Of course Draco remembers. He can’t even recall what Attractive Stranger looked like now, but he remembers the look in Harry’s eyes when he said
“Did anyone else know?” The explanation certainly explains why Ginny looked as if she was protecting Potter instead of getting ready to hex him.
“Maybe not,” Potter whispered, tone miserable.
“We went to a ball together, Granger. One. It was great, but it wasn’t life changing. Nothing we have done could have made me his heart.”
Draco knew he could brush it off, push Neville away until the subject was dropped—but he didn’t want to; didn’t want to push away his only friend.
and he really does want to see The Sundowner. He glances at Harry. “Hypothetically, how do you think a situation like that would be received?”
Draco cocked his head to the side and ignored Neville’s curious gaze.
Draco rubs his eyes and takes a shaky breath, focusing on Harry. “There’s a world of difference between your father and mine.”
When his father sneered, he had to hide his shaking hands inside his robes.
“You can if you like.” Harry gives Draco a warm smile. “I’ll cover you with a blanket, like they do in the films.”
“Sorry,” Draco apologized. “My mind is elsewhere.”
The Dark Lord was gone… wasn’t he?
Draco owed a lot to Regulus, owed him so much, but he also owed many things to himself. And he was pretty sure that Regulus had known that going in.
“It used to be heaving here.” The barman looks glum. “Three deep at the bar at least on a Friday.”
“No.”
Harry echoed him with a moan of his own at the feeling of Draco's nose nestling in the thick patch of hair at the base of his cock. He heard and felt Draco inhale a long and languid breath. Harry loved the way Draco savoured his scent. He let his hand rest on Draco's shoulder, ticking the wisps of hair behind his ear.
“Is that so?”
Potter’s eyes trace Draco’s body with a slow up and down, before settling on his face once more. “Maybe.”
As Draco walked towards the greenhouses, he spotted Lovegood approaching Potter. He looked around for Neville and rolled his eyes when Neville dove behind Finnigan when he caught sight of her—honestly, she wasn’t
“As much as I hate the Occlumency lessons, I think I expected them to be bad. I knew going into it that they wouldn’t be what Dumbledore thought they would. But yet, I was still disappointed. Nothing I do is ever good enough for him, no amount of studying will ever make him see me as someone other than my father’s son—someone I never got to meet.
“Obviously,” Weasley snorted, mirth overpowering Potter’s objections.
“Mhm.”
“He called them mudbloods.”
Potter looked up, eyes searching Draco’s face. “It doesn’t feel like a gift.”
“He doesn’t trust easily, and that I can at least understand. But he’s rigid in the all or nothing belief, he doesn’t see shades of character or extenuating circumstances, and he certainly is blind to the notion of redemption.”
Who would even want to be his friend?
“All that is going to accomplish is to crush your spirit,” Draco argued. “You can’t be someone you aren’t. Maybe you can pretend, in the beginning, but eventually it will fail.”
“I know that.”
That was the only rational argument she had. Draco could understand her stance when it came to that criticism. It still baffled him that Dumbledore had
“Draco needs to be quiet,” Dobby scolded as he stepped back and crossed his arms.
It makes Draco inexplicably sad that even after all this time, Greg would be worried about telling Draco he’s made new friends. His heart clenches at Greg, dressed up nicely in his new trousers, well-scrubbed face and carefully styled hair. It’s as though he wanted to impress Draco. He was a good friend for so many years. He didn’t deserve to be dropped like a hot potato, because Draco was trying to leave his old life behind.
“Granger’s influence?” Draco slips off his blazer and puts it over the chair, taking a seat opposite Potter.
The more Draco spoke, the more Potter seemed to grow upset, and he was honestly baffled.
“I think so.” Harry gives Draco a grin. “Want to come to a sex shop with me again, Malfoy?”
,” Draco growled harsher than intended. “Don’t tell me that he cares. Don’t find a silver lining in this bullshit. Don’t preach about what you don’t know. Because he doesn’t care. He never has, and he never will.”
Draco had said nothing as his father berated him, verbally attacked him. As usual, his mother just watched.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco puts some money on the table and stands, pulling on his coat. This time he’s going to leave first, and he’s going to find somewhere to go which is far away from Potter. “You think your godfather’s little club was just for people who deserve to feel safe being queer, don’t you? Good luck getting your invite and enjoy your precious little street full of
he was showing a demonstration in the first place.
And speaking of full costumes, Harry supposed he was nervous because he wasn't exactly sure what to expect when Draco finally emerged.
Perhaps being left behind wouldn’t be so bad after all.
"Yes, sir." Draco gave a short nod and turned away to take care of the owls while Mr Willis left the owlery in a huff and walked across the small yard to the back entrance of the post office.
Regulus may have been his own person, but sometimes Draco wondered if they were the same. Regulus’ parents didn’t love each other, and neither did his own.
“That’s something he taught me, Regulus, I mean. To be who I want and let it be enough. That if I want to change, to do it for myself and not for my father.”
“No.” The intensity as Harry meets Draco’s eyes sends a powerful surge of desire through Draco. Harry Potter is going to be the death of him. “Neither do I.”
Draco looked into Potter’s eyes, hating the way they were filled with distrust.
on the still air and the faint sound of laughter. “Muggle music.”
When Umbridge grinned and turned her back on him, Draco began to
“I tried to apologize then, but you walked away.” Potter paused as he looked uncomfortable.
in relation to whatever it is they’re doing together, but Draco doesn’t have the slightest bit of interest in anyone else right now. He’s quietly confident that Harry feels the same.

with someone significantly better looking than Potter on his arm. Draco might loathe the press as much as they hate everything associated with the name Malfoy, but the gossip columnists love a rich socialite and Draco is more than ready to give them a little material.
“I thought that too,” said Potter, half immersed in a Charms essay. “But then he started talking about Black and it made even less sense.”
“I don’t know why I put up with you,” Potter said far too softly to take seriously.
“Don’t worry about it.” Neville wasn’t very good at faking nonchalance. “Just something I’ve been thinking about for a while.”
Draco blinked rapidly, unsure of why he was speaking to the animal at all. It wasn’t like the dog could talk back. Was he really that desperate for a conversation?
Neville had a point—but he couldn’t help but worry anyway.
Black paused to look at Draco. “Thank you for that, by the way. If you hadn’t pushed him in, I think he would have stormed the Ministry.”
They both turned to see Granger and Weasley making their way to the shop.
to be something, it was the Weasley twins after all.
, he thinks.
Draco could hear the sound of feet thundering outside and he acted without thinking. He shoved Potter through the fireplace.
Umbridge's smile fell and her face swelled in anger. “I can’t wait a month!” she yelled as a finger pointed in his direction.
With a low curse, Harry pulls away and turns his back to Draco, dragging the sleeve of his jumper across his eyes. “I’m sorry.” Harry’s voice is choked. “Stupid of me.”
The sounds of students further back had Draco nervous that they would enter the final area for testing soon, but Lupin had promised the Boggart would be away from prying eyes.
“I’m warning you,” Potter threatened Kreacher. “What about everyone else? Is there anyone else with you?”
“You can’t buy love,” Weasley said.
“Why do you care?”
“There could be loads of reasons,” Potter exploded, hands in the air. Draco rather thought he was grasping at nothing.
“You can make more, can’t you?”
“It should,” Draco argued. “What you want
Draco narrowed his eyes. It wasn’t often people claimed to not want power. Everyone craved power, whether it was the power over others, power in money, power in society, power in politics, or even power in magic.
Draco didn’t stick around to hear the end of what Potter said. He was too angry. Angry with his father, angry at the world, angry at society, and angry at himself for caring what others thought.
Potter narrowed his eyes before he folded his arms across his chest. “I don’t know what I did that night, or if I even did anything at all.”
When Lupin arched his brows, Draco sighed. He knew blaming their bravery would get him nowhere.
you.”
Draco stares at Harry. “What?”
Potter appeared to be fighting a smile, and he wished that the knowledge didn't affect him.
“You do that.” Draco is acutely aware of Harry’s proximity, from the warmth of his breath and the heat of his body. He leans back against the wall, keeping his eyes on Harry as though watching him might be enough to pull him in closer still.
A stifling silence filled the room and Draco hated it.
“Maybe he’s just being nice,” Potter offered.
“Giving advice is far easier than to take it,” Draco mused thoughtfully. “I don’t know how to help you there. I think support plays a vital role. If you have an outlet to go to, then it doesn’t matter what the rest of the world is saying.”
“If you didn’t know about Hermione, then why did you want to talk to me?”
All smart comebacks seem to have fled with
Yeah, he had known.
“Regulus believed in things he never got a chance to show, and I hate it. I hate that no one saw the good in him, no one thought he could have redemption if given the chance.

“Theo’s having an engagement party in Hong Kong. You should come.”
“He’d have to be smiling for that,” Granger said, her voice got softer the further Draco, Crabbe and Goyle walked away.
“Fuck,” Draco swore louder than intended as the blood swelled to droplets.
“Why on earth would I do that?”
perfect.”
Draco nods, taking a steadying gulp of his wine. “Let’s talk about something else.” A thought occurs to him and he looks up at Harry. “Are you still seeing your Mind Healer?”
know about that one.”
Draco looked up, he noticed that several curious gazes were on him, but it was vibrant green that he locked eyes with.
There was a silence that settled around the already quiet library, but Draco didn’t have the bravery to see their reaction. He hadn’t wanted to talk to them in the first place.
Draco looked up at the staircase that led to the second floor, where he assumed Potter was. There was a moment of silence before he could hear thundering footsteps.
“I take it the Dark Lord is still alive?”
Except for leaving Neville alone.
“I’ve always wanted to go.”
Pleased.
“Well, just don’t get used to it.” Draco shoved Potter lightly as he stared towards the lake and wondered why it was easy to talk so openly with Potter. It shouldn’t be like that—it didn’t make much sense—but as Potter hummed a tune Draco didn’t recognize and began skipping rocks again, he realized that the reasons didn’t matter.
“Arse. That’s not a proper apology, and you know it. I was worried about you.”
“You mean to tell me that he hasn’t fully prepared you for any sort of Occlumency before he immediately breaks open your mind with Legilimency?”
“Why?”
Harry splutters. “When the fuck did I say that?”
The sound of Neville’s happy laughter was enough to turn Draco’s sombre mood into something softer.
“Not yet, but he could be. You just got to not sneer at him, and probably compliment him at some point, too.”
The barman shakes his head. “Young folk don’t know anything about history anymore.”
As Umbridge talked about change and the things she aimed to improve, he couldn’t help but frown. It was clear that she wasn’t entering the year as a teacher, or someone who cared about teaching the next generation—no, she was concerned about the Ministry. Or more importantly, the Ministry’s politics.
Draco takes in the pleased flush on Millicent’s cheeks and it sends a rush of pleasure through him. He likes her more than he expected to, and not for the first time curses his younger self for being a cretin.
Draco rolled his eyes before sitting across from Potter.
“I left the key here,” he said as he tuned out Walburga and peered up at Sirius, eyes wide in what he hoped was honesty. He could hear Harry pant and groan in what he figured were Harry’s attempts to wrangle the curtains shut.
"So why spread them? Why attack in general? I honestly don't understand."
When Neville suddenly grinned, Draco took a wary step backward.
“Excuse me, I have something to sort.”
A few older students nodded, but Draco had known all along they didn't
Draco felt a little pity as Potter was forced to listen to his Valentine in public. But really, he was just amused. It wasn’t until he looked down at his feet and noticed a diary that his amusement faded into confusion.
Draco’s mouth parted indignantly but he said nothing, he knew better.
A startled laugh left Draco, and he couldn’t help the fond smile that crept up.
“You know, if Harry wouldn’t have killed us, I think I might have gone after you.”
Pleased to make a spectacle, pleased to overreact, pleased to blame everyone but Draco, pleased to be an arse.
Draco took a step back when the Hippogriff swiped a warning paw at him. If he had sidestepped a fraction of a second sooner, it wouldn’t have hit him, but it wasn’t anything but a deep scratch.
Draco looked down, and the heat to his cheeks had him angry at himself.
“Well,” Granger hedged nervously. “I just thought—”
“Yeah.” Harry grins. “Same.”
The sound of a hand slamming against a desk had Draco flinching.
Regulus had been someone who knew they made mistakes and aimed to teach the next generation, even if it was only one person.
“Are you alright?” Potter asked. “Answer me honestly.”
Neville shrugged and closed his eyes in what Draco assumed was concentration.
he had been thumbing listlessly through. The leather scene has never really been his thing, although he’s always prepared to experiment with the right partner. After Potter’s little display of wandless magic, Draco made a deliberate beeline for something that wouldn’t make him think of having sex with the saviour of the wizarding world. Difficult, in a sex shop.
“That is not acceptable. No son of mine is going to be second-rate in comparison to someone like
“Alright, but that doesn’t mean you get to get out of helping me.”
“We’ve all got a part to play,” Draco whispered. He peered up at Potter through his lashes. “Yours is set in stone.” Potter evaded the Dark Lord once, that alone showed which side he would be on.
“How would that help?” Black asked, his voice muffled from the palm of his hand.
Draco follows Harry into the living room, taking everything in. Harry seems content to let him poke about so he makes sure he takes in every part of the room. There’s a small, untidy bookcase crammed full of books about Quidditch and official-looking Auror examination texts. On the mantlepiece above the hearth several photographs occupy every inch of the surface. Draco recognises Harry’s parents from textbooks and he touches his fingers to the frame of the battered photograph with the waving twenty-somethings inside. It looks like the kind of photograph that’s been carried around for a long time.
“Then Voldemort must have Sirius for another reason.”
Draco swallows around the sudden lump in his throat. He doesn’t want Potter to look at him in that steady, open way of his, as if he’s disappointed. Even if Draco deserves it, he hates how small references to his choices back then still make him feel.
When nothing was said, Draco looked away from Potter and noticed an amused smile on Longbottom’s face.
about their current position.
“But they
Draco wiggled his way out of their hold and took a step back.
“Whether Ginny has booted me out.”
“More than okay.” Draco slides a little lower on the sofa and puts his head back, closing his eyes. The cushions are thick and luxurious and it’s like something from a dream—a reel of black and white film that Draco knows he would reply again and again.
Draco opened his eyes to stare at Granger. “I’m looking for books on Muggleborns and maybe Muggles too.”
He just had to figure out how exactly to do that.
“I heard.” Draco presses his lips together. “He’ll be good at that.”
“I hate to break it to you, but that surprises no one.”
“The Headmaster seems reluctant to offer any information. I wonder if you might know where Hagrid might be? Or what is causing his extended absence?”
“Who cares at all?” Vincent spoke up for the first time as Gregory grunted in agreement.
“Okay.” Harry mercifully doesn’t push. “What do you want to talk about?”
He sighed as he read over the letter one more time.
Draco wants to tell him.
Draco turns away from Harry and Ginny, to take in Millicent properly. Her hair is cropped short and she’s wearing a buttoned-up shirt which suits her well, and an excellent pair of brogues. She’s not in the slightest bit dull, as he once thought. She’s full of vibrancy and the same gruff humour he remembers from Hogwarts.
“But?”
“I don’t know,” Black admitted, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was upset over the question or the answer. “I would like to think that I would have been there for him.”
Draco looked to Regulus’ letter and then back to Potter’s face. He was pretty sure they would have gotten along as well, if one could overlook the Gryffindor status.
Potter’s jaw works, and he cuts into his bacon as if it’s offended him. “You know nothing about me. Perhaps this is exactly the kind of place I like to go.”
“She also took a third more classes than me,” Draco ground out, hating that his father couldn’t see the positive things he had accomplished.
“That doesn’t fit what you said.”
“Wait, what do you mean?” He heard the question before he actually saw him.
“What does that mean?”
Potter glanced down towards Draco’s bag as his brows furrowed. He knew that Potter was trying to figure it out, and he wished him well.
Draco ran his free hand through his hair as worry filled him. Was the latest letter his last one? Would he never receive another letter throughout his life from Regulus again? There was a dependency inside him that ached at the thought.
= Enjoy your meal, my little one.
Severus rolled his eyes before he leaned forward. “Sirius Black is imprisoned in Azkaban.”
“Not a word,” Draco mutters. The bitter taste left in his mouth from discussing his father fades and he gets a peculiar flutter of excitement in his stomach at the thought of there being somewhere for people like him. Somewhere the
. Please try not to throw up on them later.”
When Neville looked up, Draco relaxed at the calm expression on his face. He knew that Neville would be just fine.
“No, he’s literally in your mind, Potter. Why do you think the spell is so dangerous? He’s focusing on a certain aspect that lets him control another person, which is the mind. The Imperius curse breaches the mental walls of the mind and allows him to wipe what is there for a short time to ensure that the victim does not fight back.”
Draco closed his eyes as he nodded slowly. “Alright, but let me try and help? Is my father planning something?”
“Of course Potter does nothing if not fight, and a hearing has been announced. I’ve got it on good authority that Fudge will oversee it.”
Draco pulls a face even though there’s nothing remotely disgusting about Potter. If there was, Draco wouldn’t be in this mess in the first place.
“Look,” Draco whispered as he pointed towards a new row of tents. “Those ones are red.”
“I had an interesting conversation with Potter just now.”
Draco looked away, noticing that a few people were wearing odd muggle clothes, ones that clashed and hurt his eyes to look at.
When one twin arched a brow, and the other parted their mouth, Draco decided his work was done.
trousers—and pats his thighs. “Up.”
“Am I supposed to feel cracked open with each lesson? I feel like my mind is laid open for the world to see, and the dreams get worse afterward.”
“I remember.” Harry’s tone doesn’t hold any judgment or condemnation. He’s serious, but dispassionate, neither apologetic or triumphant. “They asked us to keep an eye on you all when the Wizengamot overturned the convictions of anyone under the age of twenty-one.”
searched. “This is a good start.”
“Why don’t you just admit she’s asked you to leave?” Draco can’t help the gleeful note that enters his voice. He’s not proud of it, but Potter is infuriating. Draco would kick Potter out of his house too, if he had half the chance.
“I don’t know about that, Granger,” Draco spoke up as he stopped next to Lovegood.
Why make Potter the enemy? Because it’s easier to blame than to dig deeper? Because word of mouth somehow became more reliable than the actual truth?
“How many.” Harry speaks with a quiet, choked fury. The powerful waves of magic rolling from him give Draco the first true sense of
Yeah, they would remain friends alright.
“Let’s hear it.” Draco feigns disinterest by looking at his nails.
“If it had been reversed and Diggory came back alive, but Potter was dead—” Draco’s voice cracked, unable to continue the thought.
“I want you to know that I’m proud of you,” Regulus continued. “I’m proud of who you are, not the decisions you made or the path you chose. I’m proud of the person that you have become, the person who you once were, and I’ll be proud of the person who you will continue to be.”
“Yes?” The patience to Potter’s tone was the only thing that kept Draco from changing the subject.
Draco whimpered when a man appeared next to his older self. The Boggart didn’t have the likeness quite right, but Draco knew it was supposed to be Regulus—or at least the version that was still on the tapestry.
Draco stopped at the door, not bothering to look at Moody longer than he had to.
“Where has he gone?”
Draco smirks at Harry. “Maybe the
“You look good,” Greg says. He stumbles for his next sentence. “I don’t mean it in a funny way. I’ve been seeing this witch. Doris, she’s called. Really lovely lass, too good for me, mind.”
“Mm?”
“Yeah,” Draco agreed with a smile. “But you like me anyway.”
“None taken.” Harry sounds as miserable as Draco feels. “There must be a way to help.”
Before Draco could decline, he was picked up by large hands.
“Is it wrong to want that validation? Wrong to want the attention? To be noticed for the change?”
“I don’t think I have much interest in finding that again,” Draco says. He keeps his gaze focused on Potter. “I’m looking for new adventures, Potter. Playing the field gets rather boring after a while.”
“And not a single Wrackspurt,” she said more to herself than them. “So strange. No Nargles in sight either.”
under his breath but his cheeks take on a faint duskiness. Considering Potter has, by his own account, been pretty free and easy with his sexual favours, Draco thinks it’s a bit rich of him to get on his high-horse about Draco’s liaisons, and he has a mind to tell him so. He probably would, if not for the part of him that gets a thrill from seeing Potter huff and puff about Draco’s night out.
“Normal sounds boring.”
“Draco!”
“What? How do you know this?”
Draco closed his eyes in understanding as he nodded his head. It would seem their family lives weren’t all that different from each other. “Would you rather it had been her?”
Draco shrugged once. As far as intimidating people went, Flint wasn’t one of them.
“I think that sometimes it doesn’t matter how deep the redemption
“Not exactly close to home.”
“I’m not saying do nothing,” Draco said softly. “You can’t expect to tell them that they are victims and then get upset when they choose not to see it your way. What your Spew club has, is a good message, but that’s all it is—a message. You have the end product, but nothing set up to achieve that goal.” Draco paused as he bit his lip.
“I’ll change the wards.”
“I don’t know what it’s like to struggle financially,” Draco admitted as his brows furrowed. “But I would give my entire heritance to have what you have. I would spend any amount of money that I possess if it meant that my parents could look at me and be proud. Proud of who I am. Just once, Weasley. I just want to be told that they love me,
“You as well,” Draco said politely when Neville said nothing.
The barman seems to feel similarly, his earlier cloudiness disappearing as he gives Harry a broad smile. “’Course I don’t want
Potter snorted derisively. “Always.”
“We’re never anywhere magical.” Draco’s words flow from him, as he finally puts his finger on the itch under his skin, the things that have been bothering him. Self-doubt is something Draco never suffered from until after the war. Now it’s always there, reminding him of the mistakes he made. “Little Compton Street doesn’t count because nobody knows where the hell that is. Maybe I’m the kind of person you fuck discreetly.”
you all to know that.
“Well, then I’m going to put this somewhere safe.” Black gestured to the locket in his hands.
“I do this because I care,” His father continued, unaware of the inner turmoil inside of him.
“Humph,” Mr Witherby narrowed his eyes and stepped closer. He was almost a head shorter than Draco, but that didn’t change the fact that this was his shop, his house, his cellar, and if he wanted, Draco would be homeless in a heartbeat. “You do that, boy,” he said between clenched teeth, stabbing a finger repeatedly into Draco’s ribcage. “You bring me that money. Just because I knew your father doesn’t mean you get to stay here for free! Got that?”
“You have shown over and over how changed you are.”
“We’re not—”
Draco smiled despite his mood.
Draco shook his head. “Not really. Black was mentioned in passing, mostly. Regulus wrote to me because he knew what kind of life I would have. He knew because he had lived one so similar. Regulus wanted to tell me his side of things, so that if I were ever in the same position, I would be informed of everything.”
“They multiply by ten.”
“I am a gay man. If you came here today for any quote or confirmation, this is it. I ask if you have bad intentions to leave Little Compton Street to those who do not. I am only alive today because of love and I refuse to live my life without it, or to be cowed by the fear of public condemnation. I will be returning to the Ministry in October and nobody else will be allowed to die of indifference on my watch.”
and got their mate to give all the anonymous source bollocks. The person I was with that night had a friend that was being weird, but I just thought he was drunk or on something.” Potter shrugs. “I should have trusted my instincts and got the hell out of there.”
“And I want more. I want more than one night. That’s something I can’t ask of him.”
Draco arched a brow when Fred sighed heavily.
Draco smacked Neville’s arm as he grinned.
Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Why would you do that?” It didn’t make sense for Neville to turn down the chance to
“I said,
“I have a few more days of denial ahead of me,” whispered Draco as he held Potter’s hand to his cheek, unwilling to let the comfort leave.
Neville had a pout on his face, and he had to fight the thought of it being endearing.
One day.
“I did not ask your opinion. You wish to take your son’s punishment? I care not who is in pain.”
“Sorry, and this is Dobby.”
Harry laughs and shakes his head at Draco. “Fuck off.”
, Draco thinks, dimly, the words hurtling through his mind as he parts his lips to Harry. Their lips open willingly to one another until the kiss becomes a greedy, urgent fight of a thing.
“Do you want to go out?” Draco lets his eyes graze over Harry’s body with deliberate purpose. “I think I’m inclined to…eat in.”
The lack of knowledge caused Draco to sigh in annoyance. Why was there no class for students who grew up in muggle homes? Vital information was passed up that could have been useful before now.
your family has ever told you and tell me that isn’t brave.”
But that seemed to be his fate as of late; worried.
He was the one making the decisions, and he had never felt such relief.
“That isn’t pride,” Neville said quietly as they paused. “If you have to betray your own beliefs to meet someone else’s standards, then that’s not pride. You shouldn’t have to be someone else to please him.”
been home, and Kreacher had lied?
. That’s another favourite. Finding communities in Muggle London with their different words for all kinds of identities, the activism, the brightly coloured flags and the joyous, defiant marches was a revelation. Draco still can’t get enough of the music thrumming through his veins like magic, the taste of sweet liquor and freedom on his lips and the stories from perfumed queens about different times. It’s one of the reasons Draco lives so unapologetically, now. With this, at least, he might finally be on the right side of history, even if he’s been on the wrong side with everything else.
Draco looked around at all the different tents and smiled. His father may have had an ostentatious tent that cost more than most actual homes, but the ones everyone else had were better; they had character and felt homely.
“I know how to skip rocks.”
“All good things I hope?”
Draco waited until the door was shut before he sat on top of the nearest table, he knew Severus hated when students did that.
“Can you handle the theory of the spell? Will the study suffice?”
“You think I’m lucky?” Weasley scoffed harshly. “I have to compete for attention. There are a lot of us, and that’s a negative most days. You don’t know what it’s like to feel like you will never match up to an older sibling. To feel as if nothing you do will be on the same level. I have their love, but that’s all I have. We struggle more than my parents would like me to believe.”
Draco looked around his room and took in his surroundings, took in the things that had defined him for so long. The first potions kit he had received from Severus was given a place on his shelf. His puzzles and magic strengthening toys were carefully arranged on his desk. Books he coveted over the years were given their own spotlight on the bookshelf. Various knickknacks and odd things collected from Dobby had been placed gently on his vanity.
“But,” Fred began with a wink. “Find me when you are seventeen.”
Draco ignored the way the dog didn’t settle back down and pretended it wasn’t strange.
“Ten more minutes. Do try and focus.”
“Thanks.” Greg looks pleased with himself. “I’ve always loved the Floos. Spent ages working on the network in Wales. It’s a shame you couldn’t visit. I sent owls.”
“Sure,” he agreed. “But Granger and Lovegood are very different. Granger has a recklessness to her, something that I figure is largely influenced by you.”
Or another few hours, at least, Draco tells himself, unable to stop smiling as he and Harry make their way back into the now buzzing courtyard of Little Compton Street.
If Draco hadn’t been worried about his father discovering his research, he would have hired someone to find the book for him; dealers in Knockturn Alley would have found what he was looking for.
Harry grins at Draco, the last remaining tension in his shoulders leaving him entirely. Draco senses it too, the promise of The Sundowner and the steady beat and pulse of the music that already beckons them in as it filters through the streets like the roar of a beating heart. “I was being supportive.”
Them wild curls bent masterpieces
“Don’t think too hard,” Draco teased. “Neville is fine, I was just saying thank you.”
“Mass murder.”
Harry makes a low, broken-off sound in the back of his throat and he gets up from the floor, straddling Draco on the sofa. He looks down at Draco, his hair falling untidily over his forehead.
need to be notified.”
“Neither of us have done this before.”
Heavy snowfall greeted him when he locked the old oak door of the owlery, and he was just walking into Diagon Alley through the narrow passageway which led around the building when he heard weak chirping to his right. Draco knew that birds were very good at hiding any sign of injury or illness, so he had learned over the last few months to observe all his feathery friends very closely and notice the smallest irregularities in their behavior. A distressed sounding bird, even with a tiny voice like this, was like an alarm signal to Draco’s ears, something he simply couldn’t ignore.
“It won’t work in Grimmauld Place or Godric’s Hollow.” Draco bets they would hand Potter one of those smart phones right off the bat, and he isn’t sure he wants Potter discovering the kind of Muggle sex sites he’s been reading about. He also isn’t sure
“I think I’m scared.” Harry’s voice is quiet. “Not because of the press, I could handle that if there was someone important. It’s just that people I love have a habit of leaving.”
When Draco looked up, he caught a mischievous look in Weasley’s eyes and that worried him.
“Sorry.” Harry doesn’t sound sorry at all. “Isn’t that what we’ve been doing all this time?”
“Spell wise, your stance and everything external is fine,” Draco concluded with a thoughtful hum. “That means it’s the requirements of the spell internally that needs working on.”
A few people began to laugh at Lovegood’s appearance. Draco wasn’t sure what they had a problem with, but it was just pettiness.
When she shrugged, he wondered if she believed what the
“Goodbye, Harry.”
“I’ll teach you whatever Harry teaches me.”
“We’re not.” Harry holds his hands up in a gesture of defence. “It was one coffee. I tried one of those cupcakes she makes, and she said
“Are we talking murder bad? Or like running for Minister of Magic bad?”
“I’m going to miss you.”
know that better than anyone! And I love working with you and Markus and everyone else on the reserve. It’s just wonderful here!”
“But keep in mind the narrator, Potter,” said Draco, far gentler than he thought was necessary. “Snape holds grudges. What he says comes from a place of anger, and that must be considered when it comes to whether you believe him.”
“You’re trying to stop your mind from playing over events during the war by giving yourself even more free time?”
“You’re pranking Umbridge?” asked Draco as his eyes widened. What a power move.
Potter smiled softly, a tender expression that had Draco feeling unworthy.
. The idea of Harry reading any of it is enough to make Draco break out into a cold sweat.
Draco blinked rapidly as he tried not to get too emotional. He wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t sure his input would be welcome considering who his aunt was.
life.”
Sure, they pretended for the public eye, and there were times when they seemed to try, but overall, they were coexisting in the same space. Breathing the same air, but never close enough for contact.
“Another battle for you fight, Potter?”
Draco clenched his fists as he stood up straighter.
Dobby waved happily. “Nice to be meeting you, sirs.”
Sirius’ eyes narrowed as annoyance filled them.
was a real place in Soho which connected Old Compton Street at its junction with Charing Cross to New Compton Street in 1896. You can still see the buried sign for the street under a grate but the street itself is no more. It has been blocked by an office block and part of the street became Old Compton Street. Because of the fact Compton Street has long had connections with (typically gay and bisexual male) space and the fic explores disappearing bars/hidden communities, Little Compton Street struck me as the perfect location. The pubs Comptons of Soho (est. 1986, formerly The Swiss Hotel est. 1890) referenced by Draco and the Admiral Duncan (est. 1832), which Sirius references in his diaries, are both well-known gay pubs on Old Compton Street. In 1999 the Admiral Duncan was the site of a nail-bomb attack by a Neo-Nazi.
your fault.” The sound of movement could be heard, but Draco wasn’t going to turn around. “I was curious to see what you thought in light of the hearing.”
Draco swallows, because he just wanted to ruffle Potter and perhaps generate some kind of clumsy compliment about his looks. Instead, he’s the one left unbalanced by the heat beneath Potter’s gaze and the way the upward tilt of his smile is almost like a promise.
“I have no idea what you would do. I sometimes wonder if I know you at all.”
Note from the artist:
Potter leaves without saying goodbye.
“Good.” Harry’s hands are firm and sure on Draco’s thighs. The air in the room is cool and there’s a lazy calmness to the night which never quite reached an end, bleeding into a new night and another burst of desire. “You look good in my clothes.” Harry sounds amused as he moves his hands higher. “I like it.”
“Is that something you think you can do?”
“What if who I am isn’t good enough? I’m not you, I don’t have a blinding morality propelling me forward. I’m someone who has no idea where to go or who to be. I’ve got a confused sense of duality and absolutely no power to do anything about it.”
“Bloody hell,” Black exploded. “Fine, the six of us. What kind of group is this? We are a bunch of misfits.”
Detention sure would be an experience.
Dobby bowed before he walked towards the bookcases near the back of the library, and started to mumble, “Master Draco has legs of his own.”
When Draco arched a brow, Potter raised both hands and continued to talk.
“Legilimency?”
“I’ve got a plan though,” Potter continued. “I’ve got to talk to Hagrid first though.”
“Yes.” Draco runs his thumb over Harry’s lips, sighing as the sharp heat of his orgasm dissipates, settling into a perfect, sated ease. He watches Harry tip his head and take Draco’s thumb into his mouth, sliding his lips over it. Draco extracts his thumb from Harry’s mouth and touches the base of his chin. Without any further encouragement, Harry looks dutifully up at him as if he’s awaiting further instruction. “What about you?”
“So impatient, Potter,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s lips.
“What about Horcrux Hunters?” Lupin offered, and Draco could see the mischief on his face.
“You’re late,” his father said before the door was fully opened.
“So according to you, Cedric Diggory died of his own accord?”
It couldn’t be more different to their last night together, which was a release of pent-up desire bubbling under the surface for hours of not being able to touch or sneak off for a moment’s relief. They undress one another slowly and stretch out on the bed, not in any particular rush to do things with the hot, heavy, desperate urgency of before.
“Those are normal. Those can be expected.”
Draco waited out in the corridor for the lesson to end. If he used his time wisely he could have explained it to Severus before Moody would get the opportunity, but Neville was more important—and Draco needed to be there for his friend.
Draco threw his hands in the air, as lost as his mind.
“What just happened?” Draco asked as he clutched Neville’s arm and stared unseeingly into the lake, silently demanding answers from the murky water. “There are only a few rare spells that show no trace. I doubt he knew those.”
Draco wanted to listen to Neville, wanted to pull out his wand and practice right along with him—but he couldn’t, couldn’t shake the negative aspect of his mind that told him he wasn’t allowed.
“I was hoping to get my cock sucked.” Draco folds his arms and glares at Harry. “You seemed otherwise occupied, so I thought I might as well entertain myself.”
“Yeah?” Harry sounds a little shaky, letting Draco turn his hand as he wishes. He leans in, trailing his hand over Draco’s back which sends shivers of pleasure down his spine. “You want to tell me how to get you off, Malfoy? Because I’m all yours.”
“Ah.” Potter rubs the back of his neck. “Well, I actually traipsed all the way across London because I had to be in the area that afternoon and you know how those meet-ups go. I wasn’t really looking for something heavy.”
Neville huffed, seemingly put out.
“I’m not stupid, you know.” A beat of silence. “And I swear if you say—” The kitchen door swung shut and it would seem that Draco wouldn’t know the end of that threat.
The lesson was supposed to be on bowtruckles, but it was hard to focus with Umbridge’s questions.
. Draco doesn’t think he’s ever needed or wanted anything in his life as much as he needs and wants Harry Potter. It’s almost a relief to admit to himself the intensity of the growing power of his feelings, but Draco has always been a coward. He isn’t sure he’s brave enough to risk his heart.
“Master Draco!” Dobby yelled as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s knees.
“There’s no need to be sarcastic.”
He could feel Moody’s stare, but he wasn’t going to look up and indulge it, not unless it was on his terms.
Draco wondered how that was possible if Potter was too thick to listen to reason.
Millicent narrows her eyes. “I know you’re not the sort to spend the night talking about boobs and fanny as you’ve never been particularly fond of either, so I’ll keep this short.” She runs a hand over her shirt. “Sometimes people like me want a bit of binding. I do those. Magical binders.” She drums her fingers on the table. “Shirts and stuff for people who are a bit larger and can’t get them to fit right. I do a bit of bespoke tailoring for those that want it. Grubbly-Plank said she’s putting in an order.”
“Oh?”
“Who’s going to tell me when I’m being stupid?” Draco asked, hating that for Dobby to have freedom, he had to lose his only friend.
“Can’t.” Harry shakes his head.
Draco puts down the copy of
his brain niggles.
As he walked into his father’s study, the room of his nightmares, he discovered that the sight of the Dark Lord was far worse than any dream.
“What do you mean? You dream things?”
“They’re fine.” He sweeps his eyes over Greg, trying to gauge his reaction to his next revelation. “Anyway, I’m off the market.” It gives him something of a thrill to say it. He and Potter haven’t exactly had the
“You weren’t even listening.”
“Would you like some help?” Draco asked, knowing by the way Alpsi straightened up that he had made a mistake. Helping a house elf was a grave insult. “It’s just that—I could heal you, that way you wouldn’t be in pain.”
“Draco,” Regulus whispered as if he had been trying to commit the name to memory. “Look at you.”
“Oh.” Draco glances at Tom who does seem to be paying them a bit more attention than usual. He winks at Draco and gives him the thumbs up. Scowling, Draco turns back to Potter. “What’s he looking so pleased about?”
“What do you mean?” Potter asked, his head tilted, and his hair blew in the breeze.
There was an appeal there. Draco was good at judging people, but he also liked the idea of not picking anything.
“Very subtle change of topic.” Draco hands Potter the phone and watches him stare at it with fascination. “There are ways and means of getting access to them in our world. I use mine for business.”
They move on to the Mayor & Miners and Harry buys a couple of bottles of beer for he and Draco, before they settle at a quiet table next to a flickering fire.
At one juncture, Draco considered going through significant administration and an intense period of study which would give him the qualifications necessary to pursue a career in Muggle law. The idea of working in the legal profession when the wizarding world would scoff at the idea of a Malfoy in Magical Law Enforcement was enticing, but ultimately nothing more than a lazy day’s fantasy. Draco fingers the wand in his pocket, the thrum of its magic warming his skin. A complete retreat to the Muggle world was never a realistic possibility, as tempting as the idea was on occasion. Instead he focused his attentions on understanding the relationship between Muggle and wizarding finances. He would be a shoo-in for a job at Gringotts, if not for his name, and at this point he has gathered enough experience to support any application to work on the frantic trading floors at the investment banks in Canary Wharf, or one of Mayfair’s illustrious hedge funds. Still, he chooses not to take that step, preferring instead to manage his own mix of magical and Muggle investments and observe everything else from afar. He likes being the master of his own fate, and he can’t help the persistent feeling that becoming part of the City’s wealthy elite would be conforming to type; giving the naysayers more ammunition to the claim that money and status are the primary concerns of a Malfoy.
“Did you know that Legilimency can be used in dreams?”
Draco sat down next to him, eyes on the lake, wishing that he felt as serene as the still water.
It wasn’t smart to be open with his opinions, but Draco was just tired—tired of repressing everything. If Spew got back to his father, then oh well. That would be a battle for another day.
That had Potter looking around the room, eyes locked onto Weasley and surprisingly Patil. Had they worked out their issues?
Draco closed the gap between them, placing both hands on Harry's shoulders and gently guiding him to stand at the foot of their bed.
They both laughed and walked on, keeping an eye out at the same time for anything unusual in the reserve before calling it a night.
Draco wasn’t sure if that was someone else or if his mind repeated the words over and over again.
Maybe Nargles weren’t so bad after all.
me again, Potter. If you’re very good, I’ll ask you to fuck me on Friday.”
“Your creepy paintings are staring at us.”
But could Regulus do anything? It wasn’t as if the Dark Lord would have allowed a Death Eater with a heart of gold under his supervision. Perhaps there was nothing for Regulus to do.
Despite Potter sitting down next to him, Draco didn’t turn, didn’t spare him a glance.
Kreacher was still alive, that much Draco knew. Was it somehow related to Kreacher listening to his father’s orders? Was Kreacher still employed by the Dark Lord, even if by distance?
In the end, they would all see.
A jerky nod could be seen before Potter ran a hand through his hair.
That revelation in and of itself is almost enough to make Draco come. Harry’s skin is beaded with sweat, the exertion of keeping Draco held in place. He rubs and presses against Draco’s body, chasing his own stunted pleasure as he puts his focus whole-heartedly into finger-fucking Draco like his gorgeous hands were made for it. He makes pleasing little grunts and whispers things like
Draco makes a show of shrinking his jacket down to a small ball, which he puts in his pocket. He opens another button on his shirt and stretches his arm across the back of the seat, contemplating Harry. Harry seems to drink it in, the look in his eyes going from surprised, to hungry and he shifts closer to Draco, almost so he’s in the crook of Draco’s arm.
“Why do you care?”
so he can properly be heard. His eyes find Draco’s in the crowd, and he begins to speak.
“My father said no. Not a surprise, really, but I kept pushing. I knew better, knew exactly what happens when he loses his temper.”
Severus’ lips quirked.
“Forward, Malfoy, and finish it off.”
When Potter walked up the stairs, Draco relaxed minutely.
The name of this pub pays tribute to the Stonewall Inn, the location of the 1969 Stonewall Riots. The renovated Stonewall Inn is on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, New York. The posters that Draco notices in the pub for the ‘Flesh’ night is a reference to the 90s queer scene in Manchester. Flesh was a monthly night at Hacienda launched with ad campaigns using slogans like 'Queer as Fuck' and 'Practice makes Pervert.’
McGonagall gave him a weeks’ worth of detention, but it was worth it. Anything was worth not having to listen to his father.
“I was always jealous of you.”
Draco hesitated once inside as more students stared at them. He looked to the Gryffindor table, unsure if he could sit there. Before he could suggest they eat in the kitchens, Longbottom made the decision for him by walking to an empty side of the Slytherin table.
“Dobby
“My dad and Sirius found this place together, and they left together. I’m not interested in going anywhere, with anyone. Particularly not someone that’s interested in me because I’m—how did you put it—a new
“You were already mad.”
Draco shared an amused look with Potter before he looked to her.
The overall opinion of most was that Dumbledore would be back at some point. Evidence of the past supported that, but Draco wasn’t sure how that would happen with Fudge as Minister and Umbridge as his loyal lackey.
Draco understands the frustration, even though he knows that statistically the chances of Potter having contracted even an annoying but swiftly curable STI are remote. Draco has had his own moments and things he regrets. For the most part though he wants to wipe the embarrassment from Harry's face, desperate not to add
A startled laugh left Draco as he shook his head. “I suppose that does sound a bit vague.”
“Is it Potter?”
is one way of putting it. There’s a strangeness in the word, because on one hand the very thing Draco has left is a fortune, in the monetary sense. It’s the warmth of companionship, friendship and family that he no longer has, but he’s not entirely sure the reasons for that can be reduced to bad luck. Draco opens his mouth to say as much, but something holds him back. He can’t help but feel lamenting his losses would come off as being a bit too
Draco stood up quickly as he exited the passageway. He had a reckless Gryffindor to find.
“What if it’s about Sirius?” Weasley asked as he scratched his head.
“Flirting with men?” Draco raises an eyebrow at her and she laughs.
“Strange. I’d expect Wrackspurts, but you’ve got none. Not even the beginnings of some. You are quite impressive, Neville.”
Did Severus know more about Regulus than what had already been said? Draco wasn’t sure what to think. Going to Severus with questions would only complicate things, especially considering Severus certainly hadn’t let their friendship status be known.
would be expelled. In his opinion, Umbridge took it to the extreme.
“No,” Draco and Black said together. He didn’t think the Dark Lord could have stopped after just one. Not with the body count on his soul.
“It’s not, always.” Draco thinks back to some of his own less than satisfactory experiences. For the most part he’s entirely happy bottoming, but sex isn’t always good. Sometimes it’s messy, awkward and uncomfortable as fuck. “If you never want to bottom again, Potter, I’m sure I’ll survive. You don’t have to say you’re versatile just to give me options.”
“We definitely can’t.” Draco’s pretty sure there won’t be any posters or pictures fit for public consumption if that particular fantasy ever plays out. He looks curiously at Harry. “How do you feel about monogamy?” Draco knows they discussed this in a roundabout sort of way, but it’s very different when it’s hypothetical.
“I like to think that I will get it all, but I don’t know. I don’t think anyone does. I know that who I am makes people think they own parts of me. I’m watched, I know that people don’t think I can see it, but I do. I know that they all have an opinion on who I am supposed to be. But I don’t remember anyone ever asking
There once was a boy
The longer she talked, the more he realized that things weren’t going to end well. He wondered if his father knew about her, it could explain why his father seemed confident.
“You’re doing more than ruffling me up.” Draco yawns again, turning his head to give Harry a smile. “And I like being debauched by you. If that’s what we’re calling it. Is that why you were so curious about toys?”
“I’m still mad at you, you know,” Neville sniffed as he tended to a small plant.
sounds awfully revealing, even if it’s precisely why he wants Harry in that position. Harry doesn’t seem to buy it for a minute, but he turns over dutifully and gives Draco a good eyeful of his gorgeous arse. Biting back a groan, Draco spreads Harry open and runs his tongue over Harry.
In the courtyard, the plans for the Pride after-party are already in motion, with rich, rainbow colours hanging from every brick and bar, huge rainbow flags suspended in the air and an enormous
He pulled another book towards him, albeit reluctantly, when the sound of a peck on the window had him craning his neck in time to see a familiar owl. Draco rushed forward and grabbed the letter. Usually, the owl left quickly, but on its way out, the owl stopped on his shoulder to nuzzle the side of his head before it took off.
“As flattered as I am,” Draco drawled as he pushed the doors open. He tried to ignore the way several heads turned towards him, including Potter.
Draco folded his arms across his chest and shrugged. “Be my guest. Maybe the shock will kill him.”
Potter mutters something rude under his breath. “Wonderful. I’m very happy for you. That your type, is it?
“It could turn out to be a good thing.” Draco isn’t sure the
“How did he die?” Sirius asked, his voice cracked on the last word and a dry sob left Draco.
“Jealous, Potter?” Draco smirked as Neville pulled away to sit down.
“But the situation is far from perfect. I just want something. Proof of what we have to give up, proof that it matters, that maybe if we can figure out everything else, that we can have this. I don’t know—”
There once was a boy
Neville pulled Draco in for a hug and he held on firmly.
“If someone was to change—truly change—then it wouldn’t matter if other people saw the redemption. If it’s done on the basis of the public opinion, then it’s done poorly. Redemption isn’t a glamour to put on, it’s not something to parade and show to those who are distrusting.”
“In any case, I didn’t get in trouble.”
“I don’t
Draco nods. “Yes. It felt like something.”
When he arrives at the pub, Greg is already there. He beams at the sight of Draco and everything comes rushing back. Greg has lost the hardness and surly expression he often wore at Hogwarts. He’s as tall and broad as ever, with ruddy cheeks and carefully combed hair. He extends a thick hand and shakes Draco’s enthusiastically.
“And who’s to say your father didn’t do the same?” Draco asked gently. “I can’t condemn him for being a bully, that would make me a hypocrite. Nor can I offer an opinion on whether he truly changed or not. Everyone’s path to change is different. What I did might not be the same thing your father did. It depends on the person and whether they truly mean it.”
Draco stares after Potter’s disappearing form. Despite his scathing comments about Potter’s clothes, the jumper fits perfectly. The black wool is warm and soft in appearance, and the flash of yellow at the base of the jumper sits just on the top of Potter’s arse which is actually quite attractive in his light jeans.
When Potter looked elsewhere, he wondered what had really happened. It was clearly something that wouldn’t be shared any time soon. The added mystery annoyed him more than made him curious.
“Sorry, come again?”
A wounded noise left Dobby as he held onto Draco again.
“Your surprise is incredibly flattering.” Draco rolls his eyes. He puts Harry’s lube easily to hand and nudges Harry. “Hands and knees for this bit. You can turn over when you’re ready, so I can fuck you on your back.”
When Black’s eyes softened, Draco wondered why he felt like he had seen them before. It was odd that Black didn’t regard him as badly as he had always thought would happen.
Draco makes an appreciative sound. “You want to top?”
that when you announce our love affair, which you’ll probably do without consulting me.” Draco has a forkful of his chocolate cake, pushing the plate across to Harry after a moment’s hesitation. “People won’t take kindly to this. You and I are…improbable.”
of you.”
“I see.” Harry gives Draco a steady look, his brow still furrowed. “I’m
Neville laughed as he gestured to where one of the tents had miniature flying quidditch players from the Bulgarian team whizzing around.
“It means nothing,” Harry interrupted Weasley, voice stern.
“I like it here.” Potter leans back in his chair, looking around. “It’s quiet.”
Two hums could be heard before he watched them look at each other.
Remus left without comment, but Harry hesitated.
“My life is a mess, and dating would only add to that.”
Draco stared at the wardrobe passively as he tried to stop the horror from mounting. There wasn’t a chance in hell he was getting in front of that. The other students were running around in excitement, laughing over their peers’ fears, as if that was
As Draco began to work on his half of the problem, he stopped paying attention to Granger, which was a mistake.
?” Someone nearby asked in a scathing tone. “Why a Ravenclaw? And her to boot? There are much prettier girls out there.”
Unity meant nothing if everyone was willing to let singularity rule inaction.
When Potter hugged Weasley tightly, Draco knew he was smiling stupidly, but he couldn’t have stopped if he tried.
Draco could tell that Potter’s steps had stilled, but he forced himself to enter the apothecary without a backward glance.
When Draco stepped closer, the wardrobe opened and instead of his father that stepped out, it was an older version of himself.
Harry seems to get it, that brilliant, warm heart of his shining through the tip and curve his smile. “I’m glad.”
Neville’s fingers tentatively stretched forward to take the paper, and Draco had half a mind to hold on tighter, prevent him from reading the bad news.
Neville waved his hand in an odd gesture, as if Draco was supposed to know what that meant.
have been given a chance.
“They’re Muggle photos, taken by a wizard. They must have printed them and posted them to the
“Yes, well, Death Eaters will do that for you,” Draco drawled as he looked past Neville to the wall.
“How about you let me worry about that?” Draco repeated Potter’s words back as they stared at each other, neither wanting to cave.
Potter blinked rapidly, a sight that had a small smirk forming on Draco’s lips.
Draco does want to. Very much. He’s also in the middle of one of the busiest markets in London.
“Yeah,
saint Potter after all.”
“I try.” Draco glances around his study, realising Harry has never been here before. He’s suddenly acutely aware of the way the cold Manor must feel in comparison to Harry’s cosy, countryside home. “My study.” He gestures towards the desk. “Does it meet your approval?”
“How would you know who he was?”
Draco couldn’t withhold a snort. He knew Potter was only teasing, perhaps to get him back.
Dobby tried to smile, but it looked more like a grimace to Draco.
“If you insist on prying into my private affairs, I’m entitled to pry into yours. I suggest you think about that before you ask me anything else.”
“They can’t have been that happy if my dad was getting off with Sirius in gay bars.”
Neville seemed so put out, and the thought had Draco smiling.
“But why? Why does there have to be violence to know peace? Why can’t there be good in the world? Why do people like my father have to perpetuate their beliefs?”
Alone.
Nothing.
why I care.”
Dobby’s chest puffed out in pride before he looked to the ground as Draco began placing a healing salve on his fingers.
Harry looks as though he wants to argue, his jaw working. Eventually he nods. “Okay.” He runs his hand over Draco’s chest, settling over his heart. “I think you’re a good man, for what it’s worth. Whatever you were then, I think you’re a good man now.”
“The mudblood managed to excel in a third more exams than you.”
The glare Neville sent disappeared when he realized who it was, and his eyes quickly melted into a relief that Draco hadn’t ever seen on him before.
He fiddled with the lining of his robes instead of looking at Potter. “It was nothing.”
Neville’s yell was the last thing Draco heard before he straightened up and left the tent.
“We can just be vague. It’s not like we have to tell him that we’re pranking Umbridge.”
“I know that.” Draco rolled his eyes as he stepped closer to Potter. “The circumstance is out of your hands, but that doesn’t mean what you do from here is no longer your decision.”
“We’re not undercover and nobody is paying me an Auror salary to spend time with you in a sex shop, so you can have fun on your own time.” Draco heads pointedly towards the curtain. “Hurry up, Potter.”
“How do you think? I overheard Kreacher in the Manor, and he was listening to my father.”
Potter grinned, and it held just a bit too much smugness for his liking.
“I ask you one more time Mister Malfoy, where is Potter?”
Before Draco can point out how obnoxious Potter is, another wizard slides in next to Harry.
“Oh, come on.” Harry pulls Draco over him and looks up at him, heartbreakingly lovely. “I’m not a blushing virgin, just get your cock inside me and stop being so noble.”
“I suppose it’s not really your fault. Even the smartest of beings aren’t infallible. Personally, I think you need to buck up, because trusting just anyone can get you in trouble. Being gullible isn’t a good thing, you know. What was your name again? Probably something outlandish, really. And I think that—”

“You’re not alone in this fight.”
“No.” Draco glances at the noticeable hardness in Harry’s joggers. “I seem to recall my being responsible for stopping you from getting a hand job in the loos at Sage & Thyme, though.”
much gossip. Fidor is lead house elf in the kitchens, but he’s mean to Winky, so Dobby isn’t liking him.”
“What happened to you, cousin?” Draco whispered as he shut yet another book.
When Severus’ hand stilled over a bottle of dittany, Draco jumped off the table.
Draco read over the letter twice as he tried to picture what Regulus would have gone through. He didn’t have any siblings, so there wasn’t much he could relate to in that aspect, but it was clear that Regulus loved his brother.
. The time would come, but Draco wanted to do nothing except eat a feast and play Exploding Snap with Neville.
“I’m getting that.” Draco thinks of Harry wandering around London in his dinosaur jumper and his empty flat in Bermondsey, curled up on that sofa of his and watching the telly by himself as he tries to avoid cameras and Quick-Quote Quills. “I’m not afraid of the press.”
Draco frowned, he didn’t like the sound of that at all.
Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly. This would be a long day.
Draco wasn’t sure where they misunderstood him enough to think that
“Don’t,” Draco argued, head shaking as he tried not to become angry. “Don’t speak as if you know. You can’t understand.”
“Blimey,” Weasley whispered. “There’s nothing wrong with being a half-giant.”
Draco glares at Harry, even though he’s not entirely sure his Great Aunt is someone he should be defending. By all accounts she was just as batshit as Aunt Bella.
“Bye, Draco.”
“And what do you see?” Draco whispered, he was a little worried about the answer. He didn’t want to be like either of them, didn’t want to be looked at and the only recognition to have been seen was for his parents.
.” Draco glares at Harry before sucking in a breath and approaching the neon light which flickers and hums as he gets nearer. With another shaky breath, Draco taps his wand against the base of the arrow just like Black’s diaries described.
Pain replaced the suspicion on Black’s face and his eyes moved to the letters in Draco’s hands.
“You said ‘stares’ twice.”
“Well done, Neville,” Draco congratulated as he stretched out over the bench.
Harry’s cheeks get hot and Ginny snorts under her breath. “You two can stop that until Millie gets here. Keep it clean, Malfoy.”
“’Fraid I can’t. Don’t know much more than has been said, although I expect you know more than me. I received an owl from Dumbledore, and here I am.”
“I wondered if you hadn’t seen the latest Educational Decree.”
“I have to face the truth of what happened every single day. I should be allowed to have a peace of mind while here. Why is he allowed to dredge it all up and show such spells? I could have handled learning about them, could have handled the essays and the homework. But this? This was cruel.”
A woman with bright pink hair and an equally bright smile stepped forward.
“In the eighties, Jonathan Ashton went to Hogsmeade armed with no more than his wand and the hope that if other people heard his story it would prevent people from dying. The only spell he cast was the same spell I’m casting today, to amplify his voice so his message could be heard by the widest possible audience. He was thrown into Azkaban for three nights on a fabricated charge. Following Jonathan’s arrest hundreds of wizards and transgender witches, primarily from marginalised groups, died of an illness called AIDS. Jonathan Ashton died of the same disease when he was twenty-six years of age. His death went unnoticed by all but those who knew him.
Draco stilled, everything else forgotten as he turned to peer at Neville incredulously.
When Draco peered up, legs locked in the uncomfortable position, it took several minutes for the bow to be returned. If he didn’t know any better, he would think the Hippogriff was reluctant.
Draco smirked when Potter’s eyes widened, and he awkwardly thanked her.
“A time will come soon when you, too, will be involved.”
a deciding factor?”
“I burned Master Malfoy’s pre-supper meal.”
“I’ll just have the regular stuff, thanks. Hot, with milk and sugar. You know how I like it.” The last sentence is suggestive, particularly when accompanied by Potter’s warm smile and a wink. “Thanks, Tom.”
The sound of Potter’s laughter stuck with Draco well past when it should have disappeared.
“I’m sorry I mentioned your dad.” Harry gives Draco a careful look. “I won’t again, if you don’t want me to.”
Draco wasn’t so sure the former was true. He would have helped Neville seek justice, if it had been something he thought Neville might do.
Although I have referenced several closed LGBT bars in London in passing, LLAP115 and I agreed to focus on this one in the piece of art inspired by the fic so it gets a specific mention here. A pub and nightclub on Hackney Road in East London, the Joiner's closed in 2015. A campaign to save the building led to a condition in planning permission for the new flats proposed on the site that they could only go ahead if they include a pub that will "remain a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-focused venue for a minimum of 12 years." It is believed to be the first time that the sexual orientation of a venue’s customers has been included as a condition of planning approval.
, how you are. I hear you blow up relatives in your spare time.”
“Thank you for that validation,” Draco replies. “I feel much better.”
“He was also a murderer, but that has no correlation to being a Parselmouth. Dumbledore is powerful but on the wrong side of a loony bin. There’s no correlation, Potter.”
“Does that mean he can see thoughts in my mind? Like a mind reader?”
“I’ve left you stuff out if you want to borrow a change of clothes,” Potter says. His cheeks are pink from the shower and his hair is damp and rumpled. He’s mouth-watering. “Resize them if you like. It’s just pyjamas. Unless you want to go out for breakfast?”
“Apart from the condoms, yes.” Draco reaches across and grabs the lube. “You remember I don’t have a lot of experience with wizards. I think it’s best for both of us if I stick to the methods that usually work.”
Black whispered in outrage. “Just once sock in his daily stew, no one will even know.”
Thank you so much for reading! You can find me on tumblr
“I suppose so.”
“Next Friday, I thought,” Harry continues. “I won’t be able to be here next Wednesday, I’ve got a thing.”
“Hm?”
defensive spells?” Umbridge queried with a false laugh that irked Draco. “I can’t imagine why you would want to use defensive spells in my class. Are you expecting to get attacked?”
“We’ll see,” Draco says. He can’t bring himself to stay angry at Potter for long and the fury that welled up so quickly within him fades away. He suspects there’s an element of truth to Harry’s assumption in any event. “I suppose you want to go and find this lost street of yours now.”
“No,” Neville disagreed before waving to a few Gryffindor classmates. “My parents picked a side. My gran didn’t want them to pick at all. She would rather be in the sidelines judging everyone.”
“If you can’t understand manners, then I will teach them to you.”
, apart from to drive me to distraction.” Draco tries to feign disinterest, but he isn’t sure it’s terribly successful. “We’re both inclined to keep things casual. I hardly expected you to be celibate tonight. You’re the new star of the scene, after all. I would hate to cramp your style.”
The grey moral standing had him uncomfortable. Draco knew that no matter who looked at Regulus or judged him, that he himself would always admire his cousin.
“Just be careful,” Potter stressed.
Draco laughed, the sound hollow even to his own ears. “As alright as I imagine you will be one day.” If the Dark Lord wasn’t dead, then Draco knew his father would return to servitude, it was inevitable.
It wasn’t until Draco gestured with his hands that Severus continued. “Black was moronic, childish, reckless, and a fool, but he wasn’t a murderer—at least not intentionally.”
“I know.” Draco picks at some invisible lint on his trousers. “I’ve been a little off the radar.”
“It’s been a pleasure,” Draco says.
When Draco looked back at Potter and noticed he was gone, he allowed his smile to grow.
“He was—um—he was there.”
“Draco—”
Potter sits back, seemingly satisfied. “Fine. It’s in Bemondsey.”
Neither does Draco, so he doesn’t think twice about saying
“Very well, if you won’t tell me, then I will get my answers another way. The Cruciatus Curse ought to do nicely.”
“Thank you?” Neville looked to Draco, with his face full of questions and his hands moving in uncertainty.
Draco shook his head, as he tried to recall when Elrin would’ve had time for a mate not in the Manor.
Despite the expected answer, he couldn’t help but wish there had been more, that Potter would have eluded something else.
Kreacher nodded once and mumbled something inaudible.
“Does anyone?”
Potter’s brows merged as a doubtful expression caused Draco to laugh.
—Harry from their bedroom, relegating him to the guest quarters to get ready.
“Then we’ll go,” Harry says, easily, as if it’s just that simple. It probably is, when you’re Harry Potter.
“He did, however, mention you had a wonderful track record with endurance.”
“Yeah—wait, what?” Draco turned towards Neville with a frown. “What nonsense did you just say?”
Draco took in a shaky breath as he knelt down to peer into Dobby’s eyes. “Did he now?” He hated the way his voice cracked.
“Wait!” Harry cries out at the same moment Draco pulls them both, stumbling, to the other side of the curtain.
“I’m going to have to teach you how to skip rocks.”
Draco felt helpless, which was silly considering it had already happened, there was no need to worry over the past. And yet, he couldn’t stop himself from wishing Regulus well, even though he knew it would all end. One day, there would be no more letters; an end that he prayed wouldn’t come soon.
“As if it would make a dent in your Galleons.” Draco looks around and casts a surreptitious drying charm on his shoes when he’s sure nobody is looking. “I wasn’t sure you would be here.”
“You should go,” Draco said as he reached forward to wipe Dobby’s eyes. “Before my father comes back.” It was always a possibility, but Draco doubted it. His father wasn’t one to continue after losing.
“If I had known—I wouldn’t have—”
Longbottom snorted harder than Draco cared to admit.
“Alright,” Draco agreed. Before they turned the corner, he looked back at the sensation of eyes on him and wasn’t surprised to see Moody in the corridor near his classroom.
Potter turned back to Draco, eyes blinking rapidly and amusement briefly taking over the grief on his face.
Draco turned his back, the action causing a few to gasp, but he was trusting them, trusting that they would take his words to heart. He glanced over his shoulder and made eye contact with Potter, who he had known had been staring at him for a while.
A cruel smirk had Draco closing his eyes.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat at the concerned tone.
Draco closed his eyes tightly, ever thankful he took a chance and put himself out there. Neville may be a brash Gryffindor, and an idiot sometimes, but he truly was a great friend.
"I learned how to change."
The Mark on Draco’s arm itches underneath his shirt. He composes himself before answering so his tone is as dispassionate as possible. “There are certain places that have wards against people like me. I want to ensure there won’t be any nasty surprises.”
Fred glared at George as he gingerly rubbed the spot that had been smacked.
Black placed a hand over his head as his shoulders shook.
been confunded. Hermione what’s the countercurse for–”
“You already said you’re versatile.” Harry frowns at Draco.
“Huh,” Draco whispered without realizing it. The person turned to face them but paused to gape.
Draco lifted his hands in the air as lost as his mind.
Potter claimed he could throw off the curse, so there was no reason to watch the rest of them try.
“Thank you,” Potter whispered as he cupped Draco’s cheek. “I tend to forget that I have a choice. Even when I’m forced into this, I still have a choice in how I go about it.”
“And your father?” Potter asked, eyes narrowed. “Where’s he?”
Draco laughed somewhat hysterically. “Potter, can you ever have something you’ve never experienced?”
“I don’t know, if anyone was going to, I’d think it would be him.”
“Keep telling yourself that.”
“Oh you are,” Draco contradicted with a smirk. “Don’t get that twisted.”
“How do you feel about a night out?”
“Master Draco is Dobby’s best friend.”
Harry looks miserable. “I don’t want them going after Little Compton Street. Paul’s asked if I’ll say something at Compton Common on Saturday. People want reassurances that the Ministry isn’t going to start getting heavy-handed. I’ve got a meeting with Kingsley about it.”
Potter stood up, his hands lifting to run through his hair.
Umbridge appeared worried, a small frown marred her features, but the pleased glint to her eyes contradicted everything.
Potter opened his mouth, but Draco stood up, anger ruling his actions.
“Yes, it is.”
Draco doubted that would hold up, but he didn’t wait for her to change her mind about leaving. He grabbed hold of Granger’s wrist and pulled her out of the room.
Before Draco could really delve into the thought deeper, he became distracted by the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher’s speech.
“Care to tell me why you aren’t using such talents on other students? Gryffindors perhaps?” The question was more teasing than anything, but Draco wasn’t in the mood.
“Yeah,” Potter agreed, voice flat in agreement. “But it worked, for the most part.”
“I don’t know if Cho likes me, not sure why you care though, if she did.”
“He’s not my champion,” Draco mumbled, but he didn’t refute the plan.
“Snape?” Harry gawks at McGonagall. “Teaching about…that?”
“I heard you were here. I’m such a fan. You’ve got to come and dance, we’re all dying to know how Harry Potter moves.” The man laughs and leans in, whispering something to Harry and putting a non-too-subtle hand on his leg. He pulls back after a moment. “I bet you want to, don’t you?”
“Snape is
“Am I Sirius Black in this scenario?” Draco doesn’t care to point out that on the basis of the evidence they have to hand Black was probably head over heels for James Potter who ended up marrying his pretty redhead. There’s a certain irony to the situation that isn’t lost on Draco.
Nothing new, then.
As Weasley, Neville and Lovegood left the classroom, Potter pulled out an invisibility cloak from his bag.
Draco wrapped an arm around Neville’s shoulder.
“Somewhere in the house,” Black said. “He’s been ordered not to leave the house unless I give permission.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at Dobby. He had thought that the fact that he couldn’t stand upright would have been the only tip off that they knew he was in pain. Excuses had been made in his head that he could offer as to why he was in pain, and not a single one of them would have mentioned the Cruciatus Curse. Dobby must have suspected that all along—how he had known about it at all, was a mystery.
“What do you mean by that?”
To have Regulus’ pride meant
Harry stares at Draco for one long, cold minute. “You’ve always been a selfish bloody coward. I hope you enjoy mooching around London by yourself and talking to your owl in that big lonely house of yours. God forbid you’d ever take a chance at being happy.”
This close to Christmas, the owls of the Owl Post owlery were working overtime. Merchants, customers, friends or family members: everybody was using them to order products, deliver goods and presents, or send letters. Owning just one owl was simply not enough at a time like this, and so a steady flow of customers kept everybody at the Owl Post office busy. This day had been especially long. There were currently 97 owls in the owlery and a few dozen should return from their errands during the night. Taking care of all them was a very time-consuming task, even with magic. On top of that, Mr Willis had held one of his famous “You’re a Death Eater, this is a punishment, work harder” speeches which had cost Draco even more time, so now he was once again the last to leave.
The knowledge of something to help seemed to calm Potter. He supposed discovering for the first time that someone could break open the mind would be troubling.
“Will you quit calling me that?”
“I can tell.” Draco’s eyes catch the silver ring on Harry’s finger. “I didn’t expect those.”
They stood in a comfortable silence as the last few students finished their tests. When Lupin dismissed them and locked eyes with Draco, he quickly left before any questions could be asked. Draco wasn’t sure if Lupin knew Regulus, but he sure didn’t feel like explaining anything.
Potter’s smile turned soft, and Draco’s anger fizzled down at the sight.
Why did everything have to be so complicated?
“If you’d like,” Draco began hesitantly. “We’re going to try and get rid of the Horcrux, we’re going to try and finish out what Regulus started. Would you like to help us?”
Potter
Potter tilted his head back and looked up at the sky.
Stupid Weasleys and their wrong opinions. Potter hadn’t been flirting. He wasn’t entirely sure what they had been doing. But flirting wasn’t one of them.
look good. I’ve been dying to see what you look like when you’re not being posh and uptight.”
Draco sighed as the simplicity of the words didn’t mesh with the complex reality.
“Maybe.” Harry holds Draco’s gaze for another charged moment before he turns back to the shop and takes a deep breath. He puts his hand on the door and has the audacity to wink at Draco. “Well, Malfoy. Want to come to a sex shop with me?”
. There are a hundred different photographs somewhere in their future, hazy and undefined but bright, colourful and rich with possibility.
“It’s not fair.” Potter sighed as he clenched a fist. “Why can’t we just be kids?”
Potter blinks at Draco. His lips twitch as if he’s trying not to smile. “Is it the logistics that are bothering you?”
Black and Lupin shared a long look.
“Why on earth would they pretend he didn’t exist?” Draco casts Harry a nervous glance because he looks very much like a Gryffindor on the verge of throwing himself head-first into battle.
He knew that Potter didn’t understand, but that was alright, he would in due time.
“Let me be the judge of that.” Harry shrugs. “Everyone knows we’ve been meeting.”
“Dobby was distracted.”
“You have use, we all do,” Potter said, hard tone causing Draco to still.
“And what can I do to help?”
Draco blinked rapidly before he wiped his eyes on the sleeve of his robes. When a warm hand engulfed his, he let their fingers entwine.
when you were informing me about that book of yours or shoving sex toys in my face earlier and telling me you love fingering people.”
Despite their family relations, he knew his father would go after Umbridge. His position as the only heir would guarantee that.
Draco’s fingers reached forward to grip the edge of the table. That made no sense. If Regulus’ words were to be taken seriously, then his brother was a Light Wizard, which fit the family history of Sirius being disowned.
“Being angry isn’t a bad thing, you know,” Draco said with a small smile. “It’s just as valid as being happy. Emotions are meant to ground you. They are meant to help you cope with your surroundings.”
Potter pecked Draco once, as if that would be enough—it would never be enough, but he restrained from asking for more.
“Had to try.” Draco shrugged with a small smirk.
Draco covered his mouth as he stared at Regulus. He couldn’t believe that it was real, that he was actually having a conversation with him.
Draco doesn’t give a flying fuck what people get up to in the bedroom or out of it, but he’s always been jealous.
“Your pants, Harry. Millicent wants to know how Draco got into your pants.” Ginny gives Millicent a kiss on the cheek and whispers something which makes her laugh. She grabs two shots and gives Harry a gentle push towards the dancefloor. “Let’s give these two a minute.”
“Greg said you’re working in fashion.”
ever does any good and he hates the way they saw fit to wrench the feeling of safety away from the little street that has started to feel like home. “If anyone is in position to raise awareness, you can.”
As Draco rounded the corner and stopped near Snape’s closed classroom, he wondered if perhaps he should have stayed in bed instead.
.” Draco glances at Harry and decides to put him out of his misery. For now. “I’m still surprised you said yes to Parkinson’s invitation.”
“Long enough.”
“Go ahead,” whispered Draco. Parting from them didn’t seem as daunting after he had already voiced his thoughts. “Just, give them back to me? When you are ready?”
“Your three hundred pound brolly gave that away,” Harry mutters.
You—" Harry tried—
He had a hunch that Lovegood and Neville would make great friends. All he had to do was convince Neville first.
“Harry taught us the Disarming Charm. I was talking about his wrist flicks.”
When Alpsi apparated in, Draco knew it was a summons, and by the screams from below, he knew it hadn’t been his father who made the decision.
“Oh, you are?” The man feigns surprise, looking at Draco as if he’s only just noticed him. He laughs, giving Draco a scathing look. “Well, I’m sure you two aren’t
disrupt lessons, and it
The thought that he and Potter might have similar taste in anything is an appalling notion.
Draco makes a strangled sound. “I thought this was the bit you were good at. Granger got you a book. I’m sure you don’t need me to explain that certain kinds of stimulation generally feel
“Mhm.”
. I assume you were meeting a Muggle in Shed on Saturday.”
Draco shook his head as Weasley mumbled something about flirting and why they should do it on their own time.
“No,” Paul replies. His eyes soften as he looks at Draco, losing the cool distrust from before. “You know a bit about that, do you?”
“You can’t change the evil already inside of you.”
“It wasn’t meant to be.”
“I’m telling you what to do now. Stop touching yourself.”
“Are you always such an arse?” Harry seems to be losing patience with Draco being impossible.
“Master Draco does too.”
Draco laughed when Potter smacked his arm playfully.
Draco takes in Harry’s tired eyes and an overwhelming surge of affection washes over him. He’s sure there’s a Muggle film about this. Two people keeping the night going, never wanting it to end.
“Well you brought it up.” Harry laughs again, and something rustles in the background. Draco has a very pleasing image of Harry stretched out on his bed. “How would it go?”
“It’s not a bad plan,” Neville said with a nod and a pat on Draco’s back.
The blunt truth stilled Draco.
Come say hi ❤
“I would like to know why you allowed Longbottom to finish what I asked you to do.”
“All lies hold some truth to them.”
Draco withdrew his hand as he ignored the way Neville snickered. Some friend he was.
“I’m not a sure thing,” Draco spoke up when Potter stayed quiet. “I have no idea what I’m doing, I should be spending my time having fun and just living. But I’m so worried about my future and my father that I feel as if I’ve skipped my entire childhood.”
“You’re so annoying.” Draco tucks into another piece of chocolate cake, but the usually pleasing richness is cloying and sickly today.
“I don’t think he does.”
“I still haven’t forgiven you for our first year,” Longbottom whispered in his ear, arms still around Draco. “But I’m willing to listen to you grovel.”
“And they serve chips.”
“Nobody did.” Draco steadies his breathing. “The official reports kept the details vague. It was a long time ago.” He fights back the sting of tears pricking his eyes. “Did somebody mention a drink?”
“If your father wasn’t in the position that he is, he would be ignored, his thoughts wouldn’t be given a platform, and he wouldn’t be half as dangerous.”
exist.”
Draco never got to hear the end of the Dark Lord’s sentence. A small hand grabbed ahold of him and he was lost in the warmth of Dobby’s magic as they disapparated.
Dobby perked up, ears wiggling in excitement.
Food Fair Funk gon' give it to you
“You wish.” Draco already wants to claw his words back. The anger dulls, replaced by a giddy panic. His skin crawls with the same restless itch, the burn of the Dark Mark under his crisp cotton shirt and the whispered voices that keep reminding him:
If the Dark Lord had no power, then his words would hold no meaning. There would be no followers, there would be nothing but the idea of a movement—a movement that would accomplish nothing.
Draco arched a brow and laughed when Neville went red in the face.
“What?” Harry stares at Draco and then laughs. “No, you twat.”
He wasn’t sure what to say, he knew it wasn’t exactly the other house elves’ fault for thinking the way they did, but it wasn’t okay to make Dobby feel excluded.
“No, he doesn’t,” Neville agreed, eyes hard.
"I'm so tired, Neville. Tired of trying so hard to be a better person, and he just sits there with his ignorant beliefs and the papers eat it up. Sure, anyone with a brain knows what he's like, but he reaps the benefit of his crimes, and I'm just so sick of it."
business?”
Draco nodded his head as his lips thinned and the urge to flee mounted.
“Rather unusual.” McGonagall peruses him. “I seem to remember a young boy with a lot of opinions.”
“What do you want?” Draco asked. “That’s what’s important.”
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Draco shook his head in confusion. “What are you—” His breath caught as Sirius pulled off the wrapping paper.
Naturally, Potter would favour a place where the bar staff are really fucking rude. Draco waits for the barman to disappear and turns back to the conversation. “Congratulations on the new job.”
“I would,” Draco says. He’s not used to being forthright and wearing his heart on his sleeve, but this is a promise he knows he can keep. “I would talk about it.” He honestly can’t imagine it being something he has to raise with Harry, but he also knows they’re in that heady period where everything is sex, heightened passions and looking misty-eyed towards the future. He hasn’t been in a relationship long enough to know how difficult monogamy might become after one year or twenty.
But first things first! Draco looked at the dirty bird, which was more mud brown and grey than anything else right now, and fetched his wand from his coat on the bed.
“Not brilliant.” Harry grimaces.
“You’re making us sound terribly old,” McGonagall says, cheerfully. “Next you’ll be telling them you remember when The Glass House was open.”
Longbottom’s grin grew and that was the only warning Draco had before he was suddenly hugged tightly.
That had Draco’s brows furrowing. “Potter has nothing to do with this.” The lie was minimal—but not worth thinking about. Potter wasn’t responsible for Draco’s thoughts.
Draco looked to the ground as he fought the urge to shake his head. Of course. His use only mattered when he could provide something for his father.
Tonight, they were attending a fancy-dress party, hosted by Pansy for Luna's twenty-fifth birthday.
“Isn’t he one of your lot?” Greg frowns and a pause stretches between them until the knut drops. “Wait,
“You need to work on your flirting, mate.” Weasley’s voice carried after Draco and he was thankful no one could see the heat to his cheeks.
“Thank you.” Draco peers behind him. “Are you going to invite me in?”
Draco squeezed him lightly, licking just the tip, and eliciting a pleasurable exhale as Harry relaxed. Draco's free hand slid upward, under the soft fabric on Harry's abdomen, stroking the trail of dark hair around his navel. Harry felt his body tense and shiver at the cool sensation.
He wished he could reply, wished that there was a way for him to be able to talk to Regulus, let him know that even if he couldn’t return any letters, that his cousin had still shaped his life. Draco wasn’t sure what kind of person he would have been without Regulus.
“I wish you didn’t have to go back there.” Potter’s voice was just as quiet.
“The end of the year exam will require a review of all that we have learned, and this will be mandatory. I can’t have you backing out then.”
. Draco takes in Harry’s battle pose and can’t help the small smile which tugs at his lips. “Do you think you’ll always have a hard-on for saving people, Potter?”
“Your
(Millie), it’s time for he and Potter to leave. He breaks away, his breathing rough, and he stands, pulling Harry to his feet.
“But I can appeal to his heart. I can try and ease the pain, and I can be there for him through all of it.”
“No problem.” The man doesn’t seem to pick up on the polite dismissal and he pushes a piece of paper across the table to Harry. “Here are my Floo coordinates if you get lonely later. I’ll be finished at about two. Bring your friend if you like.”
Draco clenched his fingers tightly as he fought the urge to snap. It wouldn’t do well to have detention already. Severus would kill him.
. Draco took that to mean that his mobile, if not smart, must be a particularly stupid one. It has nothing of the slim elegance of most of the phones he sees Muggles using but considering he can’t even make this one work that’s probably for the best.
“It’s not a one-time thing,” Neville whispered as he held onto Draco just as tight. “You are always welcome, Draco,
“That’s what you say,” Draco mutters. His bad mood lifts a little, but he still has a restless itch under his skin, a dissatisfaction he can’t quite place. “You were doing something with boxes. Weasley is carrying a little Potter sproglet according to the news.”
Potter laughs, and the sound warms Draco. It doesn’t escape Draco’s notice that he doesn’t take steps confirm or deny the
Potter grimaces. “When the press started taking pictures of me buying underpants.”
Something Neville didn’t deserve.
Draco sighed in frustration. “Then what do you think happened to him?”
How does one change for the better? Was there a way to do that? Realization couldn’t be the only step, there were other things that he could do to genuinely change.
When Draco pulled back enough to stare at Potter, he couldn’t help but rest his forehead against Potter’s.
“We had to keep hidden during the first war, and the second. It was too risky to advertise openly.”
The article in the
“Thanks, we’ll think about it.” Potter pockets the piece of parchment and the man leaves.
Draco grinned, unable to stop himself. “Positively tempting.” He winked at her when her smile grew.
When no one said anything, Draco looked up and frowned at their expressions.
“No wings for an owl, can’t you tell?”
Come on, dance, jump on it
“Fate hates us,” Draco offered instead. “Maybe it’s destiny or even karma.”
It hadn’t exactly gone that way. Draco had told him that he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do outside of Hogwarts. That seemed so far away, what with the war happening, and his family issues, a career seemed years away. But Severus had urged him to think on what he wanted to do, and not let other things stand in the way of his future, and his scores were good enough to give him a head start in a wide variety of jobs.
“Punish me for what I have done, not what you assume I

combs, but it blended beautifully with the black velour collar on his blazer, and accented the dark blue mascara around his piercing green eyes. Morgana be damned if he was going to ruin it!
“But it’s a defensive spell, that should require it to be precise.”
“It might, but I’m not at liberty to discuss that.”
“He works in fashion, would you believe.”

“Mister Malfoy,” Umbridge called at the end of the next Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson. “Stay behind for me, won’t you?”
“To you?” Draco turns his eyes heavenwards. “I imagine they might. Even if you are spending time eye-fucking me all over London and actually fucking me in your pre-marital bed.”
“I have been worried about you.”
Draco lifted both of his hands into the air.
“Part of me hates them.”
is one of the only things they have in common. He takes Potter’s phone from him and shows him the contacts page which currently consists of one Draco Malfoy and nothing else.
ACT UP is the real name of an organisation founded by Larry Kramer in 1987 in New York, which had factions in major cities, including London and Paris. The London faction was founded by Peter Tatchell. The film 120 Beats Per Minute (2017) documents the Paris chapter of ACT UP. The organisation staged 'die-ins' at sites such as churches and places of political importance, and used fake blood to raise awareness of the devastation caused by AIDS. Although the London faction disbanded in the 90s, they revived in 2012 and dropped half a tonne of manure on UKIP leader Nigel Farage's doorstep when he said people with HIV should be prohibited from entering the UK.
“Unless there’s a connection,” Draco finished. He knew he had guessed correctly when Potter wouldn’t meet his eyes.
He tried not to grimace at that. “I have something I want to talk to you about. I want to talk about Regulus.”
“Another half-giant o’ course,” Hagrid said, confusion evident.
Draco closed his eyes when the touch of a foot pressed against his face.
“It closes at six in the morning, I think,” Draco replies. He waves his hand in Harry’s face. “I have a watch, Potter. You don’t have to show off with those fancy spells of yours.”
“Okay.” Harry shoots Draco a lopsided smile. “I just have some questions.”
“How could I not? She was my aunt. My father is proud of her crimes.”
. And don’t hurt him. I can’t help his living situation, I can’t protect him from the media, I can’t save him from his own reputation, I can’t even do anything to save his heart from heartbreak,” Granger sighed before continuing.
Before they left, Fred had looked back to give Draco a wink, and Draco hadn’t bothered to hide a smile. Weasleys were trouble, that much he had always known, but those two were a different kind of trouble—and Draco kind of liked that about them. Fred just needed to be knocked down a peg or two.
Potter looked away as he shook his head. “It had to have been someone in Gryffindor. They are the only ones who know the password. All I know is that the book is gone.”
“Malfoy! It’s the third! Where’s the rent?!”
“Neither did I.” Draco’s throat is too tight to speak without a rough edge of emotion.
He waited until the sound of a disapparation could be heard before he knocked on the door.
, but the result isn’t terribly different. The only reason he doesn’t run is because he hasn’t the faintest idea where he would run towards.
The cuts, blood and pain radiating off of Potter was hard to look at.

, a proper cause of death to mourn our losses or a class about basic STIs at Hogwarts for all the kids that might need to know that sort of stuff in the future.” Paul pulls a face. “It’s all Goblin Rebellions and how to stroke a Hippogriff.”
Harry makes a low, furious sound. “You know that’s not what I want, not really.”
Draco furrowed his brows as the possibilities started to enter his mind.
has been a farce for a long time. Throw their words back at them. What did they call Little Compton Street? A den of deviants and perverts.” Draco shrugs. “Put it on a t-shirt.”
“How did the press get the photos?” Draco waits impatiently for Potter to order some food before asking his next question. Having a Muggle hideaway makes perfect sense because the wizarding press doesn’t venture much beyond the magical parts of London. The fact the
“Attacking is a strong word,” Dobby hedged as he found a rock in the path to sit on.
With very slow, deliberate movements, Draco took his wand out of his winter coat and whispered a warming charm, pulling his magic back as much as possible. The bird was so small that he didn’t want to overheat it or cause burns.
Potter’s hand that had been about to pat Draco on the shoulder froze in mid air.
. There’s something so impossible about Harry at times—something so unreachable, a strength and goodness that can’t be touched—here he’s as open as he’s ever been. It’s a privilege to stand close enough to touch, to be close enough to
wondering if Draco fancied sneaking off to the loos for a grimy, Harry-on-his-knees, illicit semi-public blow job. He decides not to point that out.
He picked up the book and wondered why it looked familiar. The pages were empty, and the cover was old, but it still felt as if Draco should recognize it.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said as he sent cleaning charms around the secret passageway he decided to claim as his own. If Dobby tried to help Potter anymore, it might actually kill him.
As Draco’s eyes skimmed the letter once more, he stopped on the one word that caused the most unease.
Was unity possible?
Her eyes were still on Draco, and despite the urge to look away, he wouldn’t—not when he needed to say as much as he could silently.
“Why is it you see what others don’t?”
A harsh scoff left Draco as he glared at the wall behind Severus.
despite blood purity.
Add a dildo, get the stretch!
Draco clasped his hands together as his mind whirled. If he went, he’d have to face the opinions of others, the opinions of students who didn’t know him—didn’t know who he really was. No one Potter invited would be willing to see a different side of him.
“Because people were giving me peculiar looks and I had to leave, despite having arranged a late lunch at The Ivy.”
Draco closed his eyes, hating the rules. How come Potter could break every single bloody school rule, but he couldn’t bend just one?
As a flash of red shot out of his father’s wand, Draco’s mind was too distracted to care about the sting of a hex.
—to stifle a laugh. "You
“Why not?”
“I understand.” Draco does. He spent half his life expecting he would be like his mother and father, carrying on the Malfoy lineage. He knows it could happen, if he wanted it, but he’s no longer certain he does.
“Perhaps.” Draco isn’t sure how he feels about the fact that Potter’s reward for saving the world is a broken mind, a month out of work and the inability to dance in a Muggle club in peace. The thought makes him feel strangely sad, even though he’s certain Potter wouldn’t want a moment of pity.
“That’s right,” the Boggart mocked. “All your self-loathing, self-awareness and self-improvement did nothing. You still wound up a Death Eater.”
“That’s good, because if I had to see you pine any longer I was—”
Draco huffs. “I’m sorry I spoiled your plans for a quick hand job in the loos, Potter.”
When he paused in front of the gargoyle, he would like to have said it was because he had no way of getting in—which was true—but mainly, it was because there was a dog sitting at the entrance, growling lowly.
“This is school, Mister Potter, not the real world.”
“He’s the head of the Order,” Lupin said, eyes still on Black, and Draco got the impression that it wasn’t meant for them.
He glared when he thought of Regulus’ death. “What drives me mad is that no one knew. The Ministry still had him down as a missing person for years after his death. Until it was assumed that he had died sometime during the war. Everyone who knew he was a Death Eater believes he ran away, like a coward would. But really, he died fighting the Dark Lord’s beliefs. He died doing the right thing, and not a fucking soul knows about it.”
“Shut it,” Neville said with a laugh. “You are too much. Just help me.”
After a long period of silence, Draco looks up to start up conversation again.
“I’ll help you.”
Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror again and he wondered what kind of elaborate outfit Draco had planned. Perhaps he would be wearing some tight leather pants like Annie Lennox, a brightly coloured and form-fitting dress like Debbie Harry, or a bell-bottomed pantsuit like Shirley Bassey.
“I’m hardly ever anywhere my phone even works. I doubt I’ll reply.”
“Maybe.” Theo didn’t seem too thrilled with the idea. “If I’m going to have dreams about shagging someone, I’d want it to be Parkinson at least. Have you seen her—”
Kreacher took a step back as his ears drooped. “Kreacher doesn’t want to talk about Master Regulus.”
“If that leaves this room, I will murder you Potter and blame it on the monster that resides in the Chamber!”
“Sorry,” Draco apologized, but he wasn’t really that sorry. “Tell me again.”
“So then, you aren’t sure?”
Draco knew time was ticking down, and he wished that he could write his troubles down like Regulus did, wished he had someone to vent to, someone who cared.
“What will you do when they snub them?” Lovegood asked intently, as if the question was of vital importance.
“Yes—no, I don’t know.” Potter’s shoulders slumped and a confused expression morphed his features.
. Wait until I show Ron.”
Draco let Potter carry most of his weight as they entered the room. He thought they were alone, but a loud gasp caused his muscles to tense, and he couldn't help the whimper that left his mouth.
“Actually,” Sirius interrupted, his voice was hesitant and that got Draco’s attention. “You two can go ahead, I have something to show Draco.”
“Longbottom!” Draco yelled loudly as the majority of those in the class were making their way into the Great Hall for lunch.
“Happiness is not part of the equation,” Draco said bitterly. “If I find it along the way, then great, but it’s low on what I consider important.”
“I’ve never heard his name.” Harry’s jaw is set, and his gaze fixed on the poster. “I worked on the honours list after the war, and I don’t remember seeing his name on that. If he was an activist, why wasn’t he awarded an Order of Merlin?”
“What was the meeting with Shacklebolt about?” Draco steels himself, watching Harry. “I want to know.”
“You were robbed,” Harry mutters. He leans in close enough that Draco can catch the woodsy scent of him. For one heart-stopping minute Draco thinks Harry is going to kiss him. His lips part involuntarily, and he closes his eyes when Harry’s warm hand slides over Draco’s hip. It takes every last ounce of Draco’s strength not to moan when Harry’s hot breath tickles the shell of Draco’s ear. He can practically taste Harry, the pulse of his magic washing over Draco’s skin and the hard lines of his body just close enough that Draco starts to react. Harry murmurs a spell in a sinfully low voice. Every syllable is like liquid sex, sliding through Draco’s veins and making him shudder with pleasure and anticipation. An instant later the damp that had started seeping into Draco’s shoes leaves his body entirely, replaced by warm waves of powerful magic, the faint scent of soap and the taste of Harry Potter’s magic on Draco’s tongue.
Draco has the distinct impression he’s being teased, and it makes his cheeks hot. He changes the topic swiftly, because
Draco’s path didn’t seem unattainable any longer. There were no signs, no instructions, and he wasn’t sure where he would go, but it would be of his own free will.
“He’s well behaved,” Draco continued, suddenly uncomfortable. “Handsome dog, too.”
“No, I don’t mean Old Compton Street.” Harry opens the diary again, skimming through until he finds what he was looking for. “This bit.”
Only this time it wasn’t just Purebloods being the oppressors. Some Half-Bloods
They looked at each other before they both groaned.

is a topic they both seem to be avoiding, although Draco isn’t entirely sure why when being
“Dobby is not fine,” Dobby whispered into Draco’s stomach. “They don’t understand.”
“I’m sorry about Granger, I am, but this just makes it all that much more important.”
“High stress levels, that’s understandable. Hmm… but this here’s not good; it looks like the beginnings of pneumonia. How long have you been sitting out in the cold?” Draco waved the readings away with a flick of his wand.
He wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t sure how to make Potter feel better—comfort still was hard to muster for others.
that you know that messing with the mind is dangerous. But performing Legilimency on someone who doesn’t even know the basics of Occlumency?”
“Give over.” Harry rolls his eyes. “You don’t need another house.”
“I think you are seeing what isn’t there.”
For a minute, it’s as though Draco’s heart stops beating. He chases back the dull roar in his head and swallows thickly, keeping his gaze focused on Harry. When he can finally speak again, his tone is biting. “Your usual modus operandi is to get it where you can. Am I supposed to assume that’s all changed?”
“I think we should take Ginny and Millie to Little Compton Street.”
listen.
“And why not?” Her tone was no longer polite and her fingers were clenched, causing her to crinkle a few letters in her hands.
Draco jerked in his chair as he looked towards the door. Normally, house elves were required to announce themselves before speaking, but Alpsi was barely standing as a hand clutched his ribs.
Draco rummaged through one of his trunks while talking to the bird. He never got owl post here, his mother’s letters were always delivered to the Owl Post office, so he didn’t have any treats at hand, but maybe there were still some between his Hogwarts things.
Draco bit his lip before he looked down at the ground. He wanted to learn, wanted to actually do something for Defence Against the Dark Arts, but was this what he wanted? It wasn’t as if he thought Potter would make a bad teacher, not when one looked at everything Potter had done, but it was a bold move.
“I get it,” he reassured, and he did. “If things were reversed, I would want to go, too.”
Draco shrugged once. “I don’t know. I would like to think he did. I would like to think that all bullies grow up at some point.”
“It wasn’t because I thought you would try to get off with me or anything.” Harry’s tone is, at least, apologetic. “I didn’t want to see you because I thought it would make things odd.” He shifts awkwardly in place, his voice sheepish. “I think I was more worried I might end up having to admit a few things to myself.”
“Dobby is torn.”
Dobby gasped loudly as he shook his head. “No, no. Master Draco, Harry Potter is in grave danger!”
The silence that followed wasn’t surprising, Draco came to expect the tactics his father would go to when it came to theatrics.
“I have to unteach myself the things that I was brought up with. It’s not easy to take something that has been taught my whole life and just stop believing it, or to change my mentality. Learning to be a better person is not a one time instance, it’s a daily experience, and I will always seek change, always try and better myself.”
Why bring up what can’t be changed?
The Ministry had declared Regulus dead during the war. It seemed to be common for people to go missing then, and Regulus had just been another name for the books.
“It seems there is a power imbalance, for I have no idea who you are. You do look a bit like my Aunt Druella. Are we related?”
Harry’s jaw works. He frowns at Draco’s hand on his arm, then shakes his head. “Come on.” His voice tight, Harry jerks his head towards a small side-street. They walk together in silence until they reach a pub and Harry makes his way to the bar. “Drink?”
It was hard to not turn around, but Draco knew that if he did, he would hide his worries in more touches of Potter, and that wouldn’t help anything in the end.
a blowjob could have had to do with Draco's outfit returned to his mind. Pondering on it for a moment Harry was surprised to see, when Draco rose off his haunches to stand between his still-parted legs, that he was covered in come. It was around his mouth, on his cheek and right shoulder. Some had even dribbled onto the front of the dungarees, darkening the fabric. A long strand was swinging perilously from his chin.
quite a few times.” Harry slides his hand over Draco’s side. “I’m ready to do it again.”
“—Stop being wankers?” Draco interjects. He smiles serenely at Harry, who scowls at him. It’s not that Draco has suddenly become a great defender of Hermione Granger and her countless causes, but he does love an opportunity to have a dig at Potter.
“You will be receiving the results of your inspection in the next few days.”
“I realize that I probably have a week’s detention or more, but I’m not going to apologize to him. He’s reckless, and a giant wanker who shouldn’t be teaching children.”
He bowed to the Hippogriff, not wanting to subject himself to any harm. But Draco hadn’t counted on his mutterings and sarcasm to be his downfall.
“New York.” Draco picks up a photograph which is one of the few Muggle pictures on the shelf. It’s a black and white scene of Manhattan skyscrapers and distinctive taxi cabs. He glances at Harry. “You didn’t want a picture of Parkinson instead?”
Black opened his eyes, and the intensity stilled Draco.
“Do any of the options lead you to happiness?” Potter asked quietly.
Pleasant. What a joke. Draco nodded, knowing that if he said anything, his father wouldn’t react well.
They walk in easy silence and Harry is as lost in his own thoughts as Draco is. There’s something dizzying about being above ground, out in the open, and brushing up against one another as they sip the coffees they grabbed from Soho.
“So?” Potter’s hands were raised in frustration and it reminded Draco exactly
Draco looked at the titles with trepidation.
“Wrong? No. I think it’s human to want recognition, but it’s not always needed.”
“Was I at least the deciding factor before Potter in whether or not you came here?”
“Granger?”
“Why not?” Draco can’t help but smile back because Harry’s enthusiasm is infectious. “Where first?”
There was a lot he wanted to say to Potter, but it was better left unsaid, as were a lot of things.
Harry runs a hand down Draco’s back and brushes his lips against Draco’s ear, which sends shivers down Draco’s spine. Harry’s hands are truly sublime. “That’ll do for starters. Then I want to see that bedroom of yours. The one where you were a snotty teenager, wanking over me.”
“And you? How are they treating you?
It’s a lot to take in, having Harry look at Draco like that, warm and earnest, asking permission from Draco. With a smirk, Draco pushes Harry back on the bed and slides down his body. Without so much as a smart comment, Draco takes Harry into the back of his throat and shows him exactly how much Draco wants him to come. Harry’s cock is heavy and thick in Draco’s mouth and the stretch of it makes Draco think of the other places it might stretch. It’s all very good, feeling Harry squirm back into the sheets and make bitten-off noises as he arches into Draco’s mouth and tangles his beautiful hands in Draco’s hair. It doesn’t take long for Draco’s concentrated efforts to bring Harry to a forceful climax.
—Harry muttered a cleaning spell for himself.
A surprised laugh escaped Draco as he leaned back in the chair. “I’m surprised you don’t.”
Was it power?
under his breath. “If there's any advice you ever need or if you want to pick up condoms and Tesco won't take your Knuts, go to the Muggle place on Dean Street. There are one or two Healers that know what they’re on about at St Mungo’s, but not many and some will give you a potion or something that just doesn’t work.”
It’s unfair and Draco knows it. The wizarding world doesn’t have many parades in the first place. Not for something that’s
“They aren’t normal dreams, Hermione!” Potter’s voice increased in volume and his hands started to shake. “How do you explain Ron’s dad, then? What about that? I knew what had happened to him.”
“Yeah, alright,” Draco whispered, a small smile in place. “I just might be in the market for a Gryffindor friend myself.”
The silence that settled around the room after Nott’s departure was stifling. The only sounds that could be heard were the rustling of robes as his fellow housemates tried to keep Weasley, Neville and Lovegood still.
“There are survivors of these curses, and families that were torn apart by them in this classroom, and you forced them to
“I can’t help but wonder if they looked like the spider. So defenceless and vulnerable. Despite having a wand, they ended up just like the spider, with nothing stopping them. No one was there for them. They’re not sane, Draco. They don’t even know who I am. And I just—I hate it. I hate what happened, and I hate the casters—but I hate the spell just as much.”
“Yeah, I went to bed for a bit.”
“If you want me to answer that you owe me a question of my own,” Draco replies.
Gotta kiss ourselves, we're so pretty
Going alone was all he had known. Without Dobby, Draco truly felt alone.
Harry runs his tongue over his lips and his cheeks flush. “Or you could stay if you like. Have a shower, we can order more food.”
and the
“You’re the one that lives in a Muggle flat when you’re not busy convincing your fiancée you’re not cheating on her,” Draco replies. “I’m surprised you
“Part of me was, but I’ve got friends and family here. They’re part of me.” Harry laughs. “Molly kept sending me cottage pie and her famous rhubarb crumble. I can’t run away from that, can I?”
Harry snorts. “Yeah, because I’m known for wanting the easy life.” He puts the
“Nobody has. It’s top secret.” Draco smirks at Greg. He wonders what he would say if Draco casually dropped Potter’s name into the conversation.
“Feels like I should be sometimes.”
A bitter smile stretched Neville’s lips and Draco entwined their arms in comfort. It was odd that Augusta could care about other people but ignore her own Grandson’s suffering.
Draco placed his hand on the back of Potter’s for comfort as the words he wanted to voice left him.
“It wouldn’t be a bad thing if you were, you know.”
,” Harry breathes. “God, I’m so hard. I’ve been thinking about that afternoon, about getting on my knees for you and sucking you off. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about the things you said you wanted.”
” He wasn’t entirely sure why he felt so strongly about it, but nothing about Kreacher made sense, not the way he reacted, not the way he spoke and certainly not his etiquette.
“Yes, I would love to,” Potter breathed, a smile still in place.
Harry gestures to a fancy-looking coffee machine. “It’s supposed to be good.”
“You are biased, you have to say that.”
“I, err…” Harry trails off and the knot in Draco’s gut loosens a little. He glances at Harry whose cheeks are pink with embarrassment.
“Neville said you would be out here.”
“Close.” Draco pushes up into Harry’s throat, his word fractured by a groan. He notices the way Harry drops his hand to his joggers, pressing his heel against his cock before returning to continue working over Draco’s cock.
Johnson ignored her, but Draco was having a hard time doing the same.
Despite Dobby’s doubts, Draco would find a way to free Dobby—he had too.
It’s not exactly in Draco’s nature to feel badly for anyone but watching Potter root around in his pockets for his wallet sends a strange rush of panic through him. The truth is, Draco is bored of tapping away at a phone he doesn’t know how to use, sick to death of reading the same old Muggle financial news and wandering aimlessly through the streets of London. Potter might be dreadful but at least he’s company.
Draco threw his head back and laughed loudly before he ran after Dobby.
“I didn’t come here for asylum,” Draco said as he squared his shoulders and moved his hand away from Potter. “I didn’t come here for a ‘well done’ or whatever nice Gryffindor speeches you already have planned out.”
Draco had to force himself to push Potter away when all he wanted to do was hold on and pretend it was all alright—that they could continue on.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked as he looked back towards the lake. “I already know it was my fault, alright? I don’t need you to tell me that.”
“I didn’t know if it would fit in all the other ways.” Ginny meshes her hands together as if to demonstrate things fitting together. “But it does. He’s been loads less grumpy. He even sang in the shower the other day.”
under their breath. It’s only in the Muggle world that Draco allows himself the rare, illicit pleasure of wearing short sleeves. The courts offer an escape from the hum-drum of the city. There’s something soothing about being somewhere so steeped in a Muggle legal system that Draco doesn’t know the first thing about. It reminds him that even within a space as relatively small as London’s Zone 1, there are much bigger things than Draco and his past. He drinks in the evidence of a long history, sometimes slipping into viewing galleries and on other occasions simply wandering around the cold, stone space with its intricate carvings and displays of judicial robes which don’t look unlike formal wizarding attire. There’s something fascinating to Draco about the pomp and circumstance of barristers in their wigs and gowns, surrounded by piles of books and paperwork as they craft complex technical arguments. His father had always made Muggles seem so small; so inconsequential. Draco doesn’t think he will ever quite forgive himself for the ease with which he believed it.
Would be entertaining to witness though.
things.
makes his neck slightly sweaty.
They stared at each other, and Draco wished he knew what Potter’s problem was. There seemed to be a discord since they last talked, and he didn’t like it.
Draco rolls his eyes. “You’re hardly
What had the Dark Lord been happy about? What had happened?
“You want to protect him, I get that, I do. I want the same thing, and that might mean he’s the safest away from me. Heartbreak is nothing as long as you are alive.”
Harry runs his tongue over his lips and gives Draco a very pointed look, trailing his eyes over Draco’s body with not an ounce of subtlety.
