"well that's funny. But it could be just some tonic or medicine, Hermione. Or a prank! You know Ginny & how crazy she is, right?"
But sadly I can't do anything about it! How could I break her heart! How could I tell her that my heart no longer belongs to her!
"You are just like Hermione! Wait no, you are worse then Hermione! I don't think she'd ever call potion interesting! It's utterly bad & dry & boring!!" She said.
"Dracooooo, I HATE YOU !! Okay fine! that's true... arghh I hate them so much!” She said dramatically, “So now I decided that you're my best friend & they're not! In fact you’re my only friend!”
Potter seemed to be deaf to Draco's pleadings, like he was in his own world & nothing else mattered. Harry's eyes were wet with unshed tears & he was looking at Draco with such affection as if he's the most precious thing in the whole world. Like when someone finally finds the water in the desert after getting lost for days. Like when someone gets large meal after starving for so long.
"Well Ginny your expression clearly suggests that you know why we are here. So let's not waste time by playing dumb."  Said Draco With straight forward tone.
Today is a Sunday! What a wonderful day, no classes, no rush! I can do my breakfast early, when there are very few people present in a great hall. No more staring eyes of people. Eyes that look through me, piercings my soul, make my skin crawl! Those eyes Full of judgemental looks! Some stare with suspicion, some stare with hatred. I’ve been experiencing this a lot lately, ever since I moved out of the slytherin dormitory. & obviously me being pals with Potter & Gang definitely raised many eyebrows! (Slytherin eyebrows) so it was safe for me to go for a breakfast when no rush is there. My train of thoughts were disturbed by the knock on my door. So I got up to check my door.
"HELP!" Draco screamed, he stretched his hand forward towards the girls, but before they could grab it & drag him out, door shut right on their faces. It was a powerful dark magic.
"Let it go Harry! Please for merlin’s shake , talk about something else, cause we're talking about him for hours now! How many more time do we have to go through this. Yes he's acting different. He's maybe working for dark lord but he can't be a death eater!!." She interrupted me again.
Girlfriend! Yes how can I forget! Yes we're still together, & in a relationship! & happy (!!!??!!!) Then I don't know why I feel so cold & distant lately. Why isn't she the one my eyes look for.. why she's not the one who's occupying my mind all day. Why my heart doesn't beat for her anymore. That smile ... I can literally do anything to see that smile, but it doesn't belong to her lips! Why it's not her eyes that I end up dreaming so often... !!
And then he started to tear Draco's clothes aggressively, cause He wanted to punish Draco slightly, for misbehaving.
Luckily they were getting closer to Library's door. Just few more steps & they'll be out in the open. They looked hopeful. But potter was much closer now!
Hermione was really frustrated at this point. Her magic never failed her before, but today it was an exception. She failed to help Draco, twice!
"Haha how sweet!!” I was still relieving from my laughing fit.. “Ohh poor Ginevra!! Okay well you can stay!" I said with a smile.
Maybe she's just being paranoid, she tried to reason with herself. Obviously Harry still loves her, isn't he! He's just stressed that's all, She thought.
"Ginnnnnnn!! What do you want!!??" I was so defeated at that point & unbelievably tired too. I didn’t have the energy to keep up with her, so I came to the point.
"MALFOY!?" Harry appeared out of no where behind them, he was looking at Draco with great lust in his eyes.
Draco took the opportunity. He quickly rolled over and tried to crawl away from potter. But unfortunately with bound wrists, he couldn't move as quick as he hoped for. His vision was blurry with tears And his blow to Potter's dick was not so powerful either.
"Ron stop over reacting! There's nothing treacherous about that! It's just my girlfriend is very smart" I said that with a grin.
Hermione and Draco were now sure that there was something wrong. No matter how clever Ginny was, lying was definitely not her cup of tea. The whole stuttering thing & nervous demeanour confirmed their suspicions. Now they had to know what is she hiding..
It was a beautiful day in Hogwarts. Beautiful sunny day. Many of the Students were outside the castle. Some of them were Practising Quidditch. Some of them were playing exploding Snap. Some of the students were sitting in the groups, observing everything around & chitchatting among themselves. Some chose to stay in castle playing wizard's chess. & some of them were utilising this holiday to study (like Hermione) & get homework done.
chapter was long so I divided it into two parts. I’m posting second part tomorrow. See you in next update.
They all became startled due to Harry's sudden presence. Draco was really confused by Harry's behaviour.
" I solemnly swear that I'm upto no good." Hermione said the incantation, pointing her wand towards the Marauder's map.
Harry's whole body was trembling with lust, it was so powerful, like he never felt before. He simply couldn't wait anymore. He leaned towards Draco.
If Draco only knew what was about to come, he would've stopped right there!! Poor unfortunate soul was completely oblivious to his impending doom. He ran towards his downfall!
Hey guys! Here’s the new chapter for youuuu! It’s the longest chapter I’ve written in this series so far! 😄 I’m Very excited for you to read this! Please share your reviews!
"Ronald really!!? Again!!? Give it a rest please !" Hermione replied him before I could say anything.
I cried myself to sleep yesterday. I don’t understand why this kind of people exists! Why they can’t just leave you the fuck alone! & why can’t they take a No as an answer!
Draco was really confused by this all, but he didn't say anything cause it was not an appropriate time for this conversation.
"I was really determined to get it, but it was banned. So I made a plan to brew it myself. I sneaked into the restricted section of the library to get the further information about this potion. I got ingredient list & method of brewing from one of the dark books." She said.
"Potter what the fuck!! Release my wrists right now! Ahhhhh Potter this hurts!" Draco was truly scared of Harry in that moment.
“Btw draco you just spoiled my plans you know... I really thought about having that pity party dance while moping about Harry!”
Just one moment ago Draco was running with them & in the Next moment he was trapped in that library. It happened so fast.
"Well Hermione, she umm- well she was upset. She told me that Potter doesn't love her anymore." Draco said with guilt.
It's easier said than done! & how does Draco even know about this pain anyway!! He never experienced how heart shattering it is, to witness the person you love slowly turning into a stranger!! Yes stranger.
Hermione, Ginny and Draco were running towards the exit of the library. If someone had told them that one day they'd be terrified of Harry, they wouldn't have believed that. But sadly it was their reality now. Their friend had tuned into a foe. Their sweet, innocent Harry was gone and he was replaced by this wild maniac.
It’s a little back story before our actual plot starts. So be patient dears! See you soon in next chapter!
"My my Dray! Don't shy away from me now! We're going to have such a good time babe. I'll fuck you so deep and so hard love, you'll feel me for days. I want to breed you. Want to see your beautiful tummy swollen with our babies. Ohh Draco you have no idea what you do to me! I Can't wait to get inside you. I love you so much." His voice was trembling, He cupped Draco's cheeks & kissed his forehead.
Hey my dear Drarry shippers, please read all the tags carefully! It’s not a vanilla story! It’s dark fiction. Don’t read if not comfortable! I don’t want to traumatise anyone accidentally!
"Nothing is wrong with her Draco, calm down. It's just something strange happened. I saw her putting something in Harry's drink twice. Everything about it seemed weird & now they both are gone. So I'm slightly worried."  Said Hermione.
We talked about random stuff for like hours, or at least it felt that way. I sensed that something was wrong with her, it felt like she was hiding something, a hurt. She was smiling but it didn’t reach to her eyes, I can see the sadness in them. So I finally asked her,
Her last sentence caught me off guard. Now it was my time for being stunned. It felt like I couldn’t breath for a moment. Like someone discovered my deepest darkest secret!
So why to ruin something that I already have, for something that'll never be mine! Yes it hurts! It freaking hurts so much!!
"I think we should find them right now. I'm 100 percent sure there's something wrong. My gut feeling is telling me." She said with a slight panic.
"Well m-me and Harry are having some troubles in our relationship, it is falling apart." She paused.
"Yeah!! It feels like He doesn't love me anymore, hell sometimes it feels like he never did!” She said with sadness.
They finally reached at Library. It was dimly lit and very very quiet (like calm before the storm). For a second, They thought maybe Harry & Ginny left already. So Hermione checked the Marauder's map again.
⚠️ CAUTION: READ TAGS CAREFULLY. This chapter contains non con stuff. So if it’s triggering for you in any way, please don’t read it.
Maybe cause it was always there.. that little something between us! That passion between us, Only now I'm seeing it in a different light!
"D-Draco I know I was supposed to use only 1 spoonful but it didn't seem to work on him, so I got frustrated, I thought maybe he needed more, so I gave him 2 more times. But results were the same." Said Ginny.
Potter's words didn't help Draco at all. Potter wanted to breed him, how's that even possible. He's a boy, he can't get pregnant. That potion was for females, wasn't it!? Please Salazar save me!
He handed her that book with a smile. He had no idea, how his fate will Change entirely with that simple gesture!
"Harry I can't believe you really skipped the game you're mad about, just to stalk Malfoy! It's unbelievable" Hermione was genuinely shocked too.
She found that book very interesting. It was a whole different side of wizarding world. It was a Dark era of magic. Draco was right about this book. The potions in this book were capable of doing unbelievable deeds! From How dark & dangerous they were to Name of the maker of the potions, to it's effects & controversies about them, To how they got banned.... every thing was given in that book with details. It was juicy stuff.
"Ohh Salazar, I should kick you out of my room  right now for calling potions boring!! I'm offended!!" I said with a huff. (Yeah I forgot to mention, I’m childish too!)
All students were gathered around in a great hall for dinner. Ron and Hermione were sitting together. They've given Harry & Ginny some space, so the couple were sitting little far away from them. Dinner was almost about to end.
The twins shared a look. He didn’t know them very well, but he knew what that look meant. The Weasley’s were all terrible at sharing bad news. Fred was the one stuck with the job this time, decided through whatever psychic negotiation passed between them.
Severus’ eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in it’s enchanted cage, part of him knew what was coming.
He schooled his expression, feeling the Malfoy mask that he’d abandoned years ago fall into place as he led Vince and Greg through the labyrinth of junk to where he knew he was. Harry was leaning up the side of a pile, reaching towards a stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient, discoloured tiara. His hand was outstretched, almost touching it. This was the right moment.
‘Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.’
‘What's that matter?’ Crabbe grumbled as he tried to tug himself free. ‘It's Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?’
The reaction was guarded as he knew it would be, he saw the confusion and restrained questions in his eyes but only one slipped through. Spoken carefully as though not to actually question it but just to confirm Draco knew what he was doing.
How was he here? It was meant to be the war today; he was meant to be there. Not that he was complaining exactly about missing it, but it was where he was meant to fucking be!
‘Too hard to say in a rush, no matter how entertaining it would be to yell out in bed.’ Draco could have done without imagining that called out.
‘Potter! Shit! Breathe!’ Malfoy-ghost-Malfoy reached out, his hand sinking through Harry’s shoulder. He felt like someone had dropped ice right down his spine. No, they’d injected it into his bloodstream.
He was sandwiched between Vince and Greg, both of their wands were trained on Harry. Harry’s eyes saw the threats first before finally locking with his. His heart raced as green eyes met grey, but there was none of the recognition he was used to. They were hard, angry, none of the love he thought was a constant there now. He grit his teeth, he had another line here, he had to get through it.
Even without the dreams, Malfoy’s was the face he saw whenever he closed his eyes. His silver eyes locked on Harry’s when the fire reached him. He just kept staring; Harry couldn’t read whatever had been emotion had been in them. How was he ever meant to forget that?
His stomach was churning, deep breaths and not throwing up were his only aims at the moment. Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she got in range.
‘Congratulations for what exactly?’ He grumbled out at the same time Potter answered with a dopey grin and a blush-
Tonks was already fleeing after Aberforth, going to die with her husband. Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione while Draco elbowed Blaise into action.
He paced the corridor, shoes tapping a solid rhythm up and down the stone floors beneath the invisibility cloak. His mind was blank. He couldn’t think of the fire, he didn’t want that back. He just wanted to see that the room was still there. That there was something to mark Malfoy’s grave, even if no one else seemed to care.
That all went in his favour, they’d had enough punishment at this point. He got to be the poster child for rehabilitation.
‘You definitely hated me when I died. I remember that moment. That fight. It’s seared in my memory. My last moments in the flames. You may have tried to save me, but there was still hatred in your eyes.’
'What?' Draco spun around, not for the first time Harry wondered what the hell he did in this room on his own.
Harry remained kneeling at his side, staring down at him. Broken from the stupor when Voldemort’s voice echoed through the room once more. His voice ringing through the whole battle once more, those still alive at least.
‘Invite my friends over.’ He demanded, not quite how he intended to start the conversation, but Potter just looked amused.
Draco climbed onto Harry’s broom, arms wrapped around him, clinging for his life and relishing the familiar feel of him in his grip. They’d make it, if nothing else he hadn’t killed anyone new in this room.
He discovers that she swears like a sailor caught in a storm, letting loose a string of expletives like a chant anytime she misses a step or adds in more ingredients than she should. He admits rather grudgingly and only to himself that she has a wickedly dry sense of humour that makes an appearance in the running commentary she maintains of the occurrences during class.
‘Are you sure you want this?’ Draco asks, stroking long fingers gently along the exposed skin of Harry’s throat, his nails points of pressure and sensation sending shivers down Harry’s spine.
When he finds it in him to be able to break away, a bone deep exhaustion clings to him. It’s only noon but his body isn’t quite attuned to being awake at this time.
He has a feeling this isn’t someone he’s seen before. The voice speaking the words is gravelly, unfamiliar and thickly accented– a lilt from somewhere Scorpius can’t name. But with every word, Scorpius relaxes further into his pillows, any traces of uncertainty melting away into the unseen parts of his surroundings. Something about the stranger, despite the unfamiliarity, feels comfortable.
“You said you were leaving,” Draco says, suddenly uncomfortable and frantically searching for a change in the subject. “Where are you going?”
She hadn’t responded immediately, but after a brief pause she’d said, “Hey Draco, want to get coffee?”
Draco laughs. It’s harsh and bitter, but there’s genuine mirth in the sound. He’s almost horrified at himself as he laughs at the predicament he has situated himself into, even as his throat, aching from the acrid burn of alcohol threatens to close up.
She seems, for lack of a better word to describe how bizarre the situation is, kind. “You could have sent an owl,” Draco says after a few seconds of dumbfounded staring at her open expression, trying to gauge the plot she must be concealing because surely, Hermione Granger is not calling him to Sunday brunch for social niceties. He comes up with nothing. Granger looks as earnest as Godric Gryffindor himself– Draco finds it hard to laugh in her face at the mere concept of ‘meeting’ though it is what he wants to do.
He nods, in acquiescence and Ginevra shakes her head rather adamantly. There’s perfect understanding clear in her eyes. “I’ve loved Harry, Draco. I know how easy it is.”
“If my presence here is as pointless as you seem to think,” he says, shoving the notes he had taken out back into his bag, “Maybe you should have let Granger know. She’d have had the decency to cancel.” He moves to get up when he hears Potter sigh.
He nods but the embarrassment settling in reaches right down to his bones. He admitted to himself a long time ago when the lying didn’t quite work anymore that he had a problem when it came to Harry Potter. But he didn’t quite need to make a show of it to Potter’s best friend. Especially when the best friend happens to be Granger.
“Harry,” she interrupts, quietly. “When I die, tell Padma to burn me with the glass bangles with gold leaves.”
“In their culture, there’s a tale, that when someone dies, they turn into a star, immortalised forever in the sky. Some seen, some unseen, but all there. And in the infinity of space, there is always room for more.”
Draco heads downstairs, heart pounding. He doesn’t feel safe leaving Granger alone up there but he reminds himself that she is a capable witch who was the mastermind behind Voldemort’s downfall.
They startle when Healer Choudhury walks into the kitchen with a grave look on her face. Hermione looks so worried that she rushes to assure her, “Ronald is quite alright. He was in a traumatic headspace but when I could draw him out of it sufficiently to start communicating, he got better.”
Potter pauses, and the silence in the room rings in Draco’s ears. Many of the Wizengamot members are wincing from the impact of the last sentence and Draco’s ribs ache with the ghost of the memories. His aunt’s mad laughter. His mother’s silent tears. His father’s disappointment. The wand shaking and falling from his grip.
Harry finds himself at the gates of Malfoy Manor three days after the Kitchen Debacle as he has taken to calling what went down between him and Malfoy in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
He Accios a bottle of whisky from underneath the bed. It’s a Muggle brand but it burns fiercer than Firewhisky. He takes a swig straight from the bottle and revels in the way his throat seems to have been set aflame. He tries to wash away the taste of Draco from his mouth, feeling dirty, unwanted, used up but the scent of cinnamon and vanilla lingers on his upper lip and fills his nostrils with the scent. With every drink he tries to make it go away but it only gets stronger. Stronger. Stronger. Until all he can smell is Draco’s vanilla shampoo and his cinnamon shower gel, until the grey of those eyes takes over the world around Harry, until those soft hairs at the nape of his neck are all Harry can feel.
“Go faster,” Draco says, almost on the verge of begging as Harry drags his cock out, slow and long, Draco’s passage clinging to it.
Instead of laughing or telling Draco how much of an imbecilic question that is, Harry moves closer to him. When he speaks, his voice has dropped a couple octaves, making it raspier, deeper, making Draco’s spent dick twitch.
He almost slides down the staircase but Hermione races up just in time to catch him. Her voice is laced with worry, “Harry? What happened? Harry, get up, what on earth just happened?”
‘I’d put something in you, but I don’t have lube,’ says Draco and Harry knows something is coming by the amused way in which Draco utters those words. ‘I guess I have to… find another way, don’t I?’
Everyone who’s ever come to Privet Drive has looked at Harry as something other than a human being, but coming from Draco, who before this week had been surprisingly decent, it stings more than Harry thinks it should. It makes him angry with himself and consequently angry with the world, and even the tiny cafe they go to for lunch with white decor and blooming flowers curling over the walls does nothing to cheer him up. He snaps at the waitress and then apologises profusely, he trips over a stone on the sidewalk and curses loud enough for several heads to turn in judgemental stares and eventually bangs his door on his way to his room so loud that the glass vase on the table near the door teeters on the edge and falls over, breaking to pieces.
He resolutely does not step outside the office because he knows the moment he sees the younger Aurors rushing around with boundless energy and enthusiasm, his own resolve will crumble to nothing.
When he knocks on the door, there’s no sound from within, so Draco tries the handle, unsurprised when it swings open. Harry had never enjoyed locking doors.
"That's really good Ronald! I'm happy that you're finally moving on!" Said Hermione cheerfully! "You can be very stubborn sometimes!”
But Hermione was confused. If 3 spoonfuls were supposed to be this intense, then why Harry was immune to their powers.
"Ginny There's no point in lying , I saw you putting some liquid in his drink. Now don't waste the time. You better start explaining everything!" Said Hermione.
People often say that things tend to change when relationships gets old. But isn't it too soon for them for getting 'old' already? It feels like just yesterday when they fell for each other.
"Wait what happened to Ginny!!???" Said Draco with panic. He cared about her so much. & the thought of something bad happening to her, scared him.
There's no use in try to argue with them. This is seriously frustrating me. Can't they see how deathly pale his usually pale skin is! How there are dark circles beneath his eyes. How dim his usually sparkling grey eyes are! Aren't they Always filled with mischief, now they just look empty! How he just sits in the great hall playing around his food with a fork & bearly eating it, & he thinks that no one is noticing him, but I do! I know that he's getting more & more thinner. My eyes always seem to find him even in the huge crowd. How could I not see him!
This information was very strange for Draco. He was curious to know more, so he decided to ask for details when this will be over. They both started looking for Harry's & Ginny's names on the map and in few minutes they finally found them.
"Ohh I was just kidding!!" She laughed “I’ll tell you, you know what happened in Divination class today.....”
Suddenly Potter's weight lifted from him. A wave of relief washed over him. So maybe Potter regained control after all, but then he heard the tale tell sound of a zip opening. His eyes shot open. He saw that Harry was taking off his pants. Draco's eyes widen in fear and he tried to crawl away from him. But before he can move Harry grabbed him once again.
"Yeah but I told her that it's not true. He's probably just stressed or something. So I told her to distract her mind so she borrowed that book from me.”
Harry took advantage of Draco's momentary shock. He bound Draco's hands with wandless spell. Draco suddenly came out of shock, he realised what's happening. He started to panic.
"I don't understand. Can you please explain everything since beginning?" Asked Hermione. She was desperate to know the truth.
"Ron you don't need to explain yourself . I can totally understand. All I'm saying is give him a chance. I know it's hard but we all did it too." I said quietly.
"Ohh Draco it's too much! I can't bear this. I need to touch you. I want to feel you so much." Harry said in husky voice, he seemed out of breath. The light of lust flared in his gaze.
When you feed someone 1 spoon, that person becomes aroused but still remains in full control of his actions throughout the ritual. It's the ideal way to use this potion."
“And I am serious! Give me a chance to explain.. this is not an ordinary potion’s  book Ginny. It is ancient, it is full of dark secrets & blunders of old time. More like juicy tales! There were many potions which are banned now because of their dangerous nature. You won’t believe what they could do!! wonders Gin!! unimaginable things!”
Now it’s just very awkward for me. Cause due to nature of this story I wanted to stay anonymous. But he didn’t give a fuck about whatever I said, & he did this anyway!
Hermione was trying so hard not to think what's happening behind the locked door. She needed to get help as soon as possible.
We both look at each other for a second. She gave me an unimpressed look, it confirmed my suspicion. I burst out laughing!
"Ron there's definitely something weird about this. My suspicions are getting strong. I'm not getting good vibes from this.. I need to find them."
"Then what are you doing here In this castle ? More specifically in my room!?" I finally inquired her with a small smile.
"So I tried to Divert my mind. I started reading the potion book & then -then I came across this one potion & I - I thought that it could really save our relationship." She paused again.
"Blimey mate! you did WHAT!?!now I'm really concerned for you. you're becoming obsessed with that Git!" Said Ron. He was looking at me as if I developed another head on me!
"Yeah well sorry about that! & hey I understood whatever you said.. it was wrong of me to expect so much from him right now, when obviously he's going through so much!"
Draco & Hermione were pretty stunned after hearing her confession. But she didn't tell everything. Still the most important detail was missing.
wow this is just weird! Why he's always on my mind!? Why There's this weird need in me to constantly know what he's upto!
"And it qualifies him to be a death eater!?" She Interrupted me. "Seriously Harry you're being blind in the hatred!"
"You are no FUN!! Not at all!! Fine go back to your books, read & read.. while ohhh I, your best friend die!! DIE WITH BOREDOM!!" She said dramatically.
‘So? I'm not killing him, am I?’ yelled Crabbe, throwing off Draco’s restraining arm. ‘But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what's the diff –?’
Arms wrapped around him, one large, warm hand grabbing his and pressing it against his chest, the other cupping his face, dragging his gaze up to meet green eyes.
Now that he thought about it away from the shock of his obviously delusional, scheming marriage, it might be better being here. Being older. Done with the war. He could make this work. He could feel a smile pulling across his face.
Despite whatever Draco had said he still winced at the word. Harry knew that he would, he knew he shouldn’t say it, but he was still incapable of not rising to Draco’s taunts.
‘What? You don’t think you could want a room with me in it?’ He faked a hurt look, but it moved on far too quickly to be anything real ‘Or worried about what kind of room that would be?’ He raised an eyebrow, the rest of his expression in a look that Harry couldn’t keep eye contact with.
Harry hummed, looking around the room. It was a terrible place really. He could admit that. He just always felt so relaxed when he was here that he’d never really stopped to think about it.
Through the smoke he saw the two brooms soar into the air, heard Ron’s voice bellow over the roaring flames.
It wasn’t completely a lie though. The second his head hit the pillow he fell asleep. It had been so long since he’d had a proper night’s rest and, even though it was where the worst of the war had happened, it was still where he felt safest. He was hopeful of making it through the night without a dream.
‘You’re calling her fat?’ That was ridiculous, sure, in comparison to Draco’s lean muscles maybe, but really, who could compare to that?
‘He does want to be an Auror, don’t you Harry? We’ll have each other’s backs. Besides, once you’ve defeated the greatest known evil anything else will be a walk in the park. Right Harry?’ Ron nudged his other side and got the same supportive smile.
Given how much time Draco was stuck in here, alone, he’d probably spent more than enough time thinking of it, thinking of nothing but it. But he hadn’t asked Harry to do anything before, in fact, he hadn’t really asked Harry for anything but his time. And that was only so he didn’t have to be alone. He wanted to just give this to him, but he had to know it was safe.
He didn’t have an answer for that. It was another thing he had to leave, only one thing he could really offer:
The rest of the battle went as he remembered, and he let it pass without any further action from him. He managed to stand in the courtyard when Harry was carried out of the forest. He knew he was okay, but it was still hard to watch.
He reached out his spare arm, clinging to Harry’s as he reached him. It took him a second for their sweaty hands to slip between one another and Ron’s voice cried out again.
It started the way he knew it would. His crimes were read out one by one. Back-to-back they sounded terrible but so many of them were just careless blunders, acts of a desperate child stumbling through the war and trying to survive. When he’d first heard them, he thought they doomed him.
‘The door, get to the door, the door!’ Draco screamed in Harry's ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke. They could hardly breathe. All around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discoloured tiara –
Draco rolled over on the plank of wood and tattered blankets that they called a bed. He wasn’t quite sure how bad it was, all he had to compare it to was the luxury he’d lived with all his life, but compared to that at least this was despicable.
Potter smiled, not his amused grin, but a legitimate smile. Wasn’t that something. Draco’s lips twitched, like they wanted to respond alike. He wouldn’t. He didn’t. He almost did though and that was enough.
How much of that fight had he seen, obviously not the end if he hadn’t mentioned the Dolohov drowned in soil part.
His hand settles on the burnt door, swinging it open, eyes closed as he stepped inside and breathed in a lungful of the ashy air. Over the past few months this had become something of a comfort for him.
Once the crimes were listed they asked the one question they had. The only question he was permitted to answer after his war crimes. Everyone in the room knew the answer but still it was asked.
Then they began to fight. He knew Harry would win, but his grip on his temporary wand still almost broke it, his knuckles white, nails biting into his palm just meant there was one more place he was bleeding.
‘I know I don’t have to answer, Potter. But, well, you’re the only person I have to talk to. I may as well talk right?’ He took in a deep breath, it sounded hollow, but there was nothing to hold it in really, still, it seemed to give him strength to continue in Harry’s silence.
As though called the guards came. Draco couldn’t help the sigh of relief. That meant it was time for the trial. He would get to see Harry; he would get out of here. The expression earnt him a particularly brutal shove from one of the Aurors leading him to the court room.
Creevey, he was another name he recognised from the list of dead from today, she obviously wasn’t stern enough. He glanced back, to watch Harry settle in with the group of red hair. His resolve strengthened with that one glace. He’d save who he could, he had his list, he could do this for Harry.
‘Ginny, what?’ He asked carefully, moving slightly around so Harry came further into the room to shadow him.
Draco glanced back as the Ravenclaw table began to clear out, leaving a handful of older students seated, determined to join the battle. The Slytherin table was completely empty. That would be remembered, even if none of them had ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ training, even though the precious Order of the Phoenix wouldn’t have let them stay if they tried. The Slytherin’s wouldn’t be able to shake off the blame of this moment for a long time.
Draco winced, there was so much he hadn’t remembered. He knew how much she regretted those words now. A panicked response in a moment of desperation, one life for possibly hundreds … but when that one life ended up being the one that saved the world … when it was the Chosen One … Merlin, she still hadn’t lived it down. He had to do better than that if he actually wanted to save some lives today.
He was dragged out of the court room. None of them wanted to hear any more from him. He just had to hope it was somehow enough.
‘Could be misconstrued. I’d hate to disappoint someone when they realised he didn’t have that on offer.’
‘You’re rambling, Malfoy.’ Harry huffed, chewing the end of his quill as he stared back at his potions homework, trying to focus.
Draco whimpered, anguished, frustrated, maybe just a little happy to hear it. Harry went to take another step forward, but what would it do? He couldn’t touch him, couldn’t hold him, couldn’t plan anything with him. There wasn’t enough time left before the end of term. Only days until he’d leave him.
There was still time of course. He just had to get back to him. Which started with getting out of this cell.
Harry keeps returning to Draco in the Room of Requirement. Bit by bit all the parts of his life fall into place with his help, leaving only one, crutial thing, missing.
‘And … How do you feel about me now?’ Draco’s tone was earnest, desperate, begging for more honesty than Harry was ready for.
He’d need to come up with answers. But they could wait. Right now, all he wanted was a hug. Sappy, he’d never admit to it out loud, but he was scared. He needed something familiar, something that was his, someone who cared.
‘I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.’
‘I’m calling her female.’ He answered simply, waiting for Harry to catch on to the conversation they were actually having.
He let out a shaky breath, leaning back against the stone wall, letting the cold of it calm him. The first time they’d just lingered outside the Room of Lost things, waiting for Harry to come out and go back in. This time they had a job to do first and still had to make it back in time.
That got a smile and a nod from her too and he could slip out of the Great Hall alone, safe to sneak back to where he actually wanted to be.
As soon as they were out of sight Ginny waved her friend away down the corridor and turned to talk to him, Harry got there first though.
One life, one life he wanted to save for himself through this mess, and he hadn’t even managed that. A bloodied cough startled him out of his thoughts. Severus’ body shifted, his wand twisting quickly as blue light shimmered and settled over his body. More blood was coughed out, but with each cough his breathing sounded clearer, his body looked stronger with each violent movement.
His legs gave way beneath him, and he crumpled to the plush floor. Cheeks streaked with tears. He couldn’t- he just couldn’t-
Sure, there was nothing on them and they hadn’t actually touched the wall, but Draco was hardly going to let something like logic get in the way of his showmanship when he was trying to make a point. Harry shook his head, trying for exasperation but ended up just looking amused at the whole show.  It was a decent request though, if it was possible.
‘You know …’ he began packing his books back into his bag, ignoring the disappointment in Draco’s eyes behind him. ‘I should go.’
There was enough exasperation in Draco’s tone to make Harry turn to face him. Their gazes locked once more, Draco’s outline trembling as he continued.
Snape’s fingers were slipping against the blood at his throat, trying desperately to slow the bleeding. Harry was useless where he was, it should be Draco by his side, but this was another moment. One of the ones he couldn’t fucking stop. So, he watched, doing nothing as his godfather died.
He should have thought this through before he made any changes. But, Merlin, they were just so ALIVE, and it was real, and-
‘Seriously? Just like that?’ He knew Gryffindor’s were foolish but he’d never expected it to work in his favour.
He should have let them all die. But, as he watched the bodies that should have been lying in the great hall embrace Harry, as he watched the smile bloom across his husband-to-be’s face, he couldn’t fault his choice. Even as the Auror’s dragged him away. Draco Malfoy was smiling.
That explained the feelings he had, the weird moments. If Draco felt the same way … Merlin he’d been an idiot.
The room he was in was dimly lit, Nagini was swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in mid-air. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand.
Harry had walked away from Ginny when there was a chance that they would lose each other through the war. This time he’d fallen for someone that there was no option other than to lose. It was Draco. This wasn’t meant to happen.
‘Don't kill him! DON'T KILL HIM!’ Malfoy yelled at Vince and Greg, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second's hesitation was all Harry needed.
Draco’s grey eyes scanned over the other students. The first time he was as petrified as the rest of them, this time he was determined. He spotted Harry for the first time, skirting against the wall as he headed to the Gryffindor table. He didn’t look that different, not really, it hadn’t been that long ago that they’d both stood in these spots for real. But there was something about him that seemed so young.
"Harry do you really think we should trust him mate? He still could be a spy or something!" Ron asked me, He was looking frustrated.
Hermione was truly horrified! She couldn't believe what she was hearing! She felt weak in her knees!
How can I even say that I love her! Love doesn't have the same meaning for me anymore. Now loving her feels like a distant memory of mine! Maybe I never truly loved her, maybe I just liked the idea of loving her!
Well obviously because I'm concerned with everyone's safety! Yeah that must be it! Gosh I really need to find a proof against Malfoy so I can show that to Ron & Hermione & be done with him! I need a plan.
I sighed & close my book. There’s no chance of winning against the drama Queen. So I dropped it. Let’s get it over with!
"Everything else was pretty simple after that! I sneaked all the required ingredients from prof. Snape's store. And then I brew potion in abandoned bathroom. It was not a difficult task for me. Today finally it was ready to use. So I spiked Harry's drink with it." She finished her confession in a small voice & then looked down.
He wanted to just part his legs, & shove his hard cock inside his lover's hole & fuck him whole night, like there's no tomorrow. Fuck him till his lover scream his name in ecstasy! Fuck him very hard so he can't walk straight for weeks. Fuck him till he can't sit properly without feeling that beautiful pain between his legs, to remind him constantly who did that to him. So he never forgets to whom he truly belongs.
"Draco is right. I should get out of my head & distract my mind. Maybe I should read this potion book, it did sound interesting. Maybe this will help."
"Of course it is a hard work! Sneaking off the tea & trying not to get caught while keeping it warm!! You don’t know!!”
Harry quickly gained his control back. He grabbed Draco's ankles with both hands and dragged him back.
H-He loves Ginny, not me. It's the defective potion talking, right? Or he's really in love with me?' Draco was so stunned. He never thought of this possibility before. His brain stopped working.
"Ginevra you fool!! How could you use 3 spoons! Do you have any idea what you have done!?" Said Draco completely horrified.
"As you wish Harry!" Said Ron, "& btw I'll think about what you said today! I'll try to befriend that git!" He said with a sigh.
"Drake what!! You're hysterical!! I'm not hurt what are you talking about, I just told you a funny story & well -"
Draco started crying. He was really really scared. He knew that potter can seriously hurt him, cause he lost all the control. It was potion's doing. Draco closed his eyes, like not seeing him will make this all go away.
Hey guys so what do you think of this!! Please let me know in the comments. Do you like my characterisation of Ginny & Draco?? Haha. Please give me some reviews!
That potion was banned now, so it was not available anywhere. So the Only option was to brew it by herself. But the method of brewing &  it's ingredient list were not given in this book. Her smile disappeared. She really wanted this potion.
Ginny gulped, It was clearly hard for her to speak. She didn't know how her friends would react after knowing her truth. She felt herself at loss of words.
"Well it's showing that they both are here Draco, let's go in deeper portion of the library." Said Hermione
"I can't believe you're in my arms. It feels like I'm finally home." Harry said softly. His lips curved into soft smile & tears rolled down on his cheeks. He started peppering kisses all over Draco's face.
He was freely sobbing now. Potter was kneeling over him, legs either side of Draco. Draco was shivering. He was desperate to get out of that situation. So he mustered all his strength and brought his knee up hard into Harry's groin. Harry was not expecting that. He fell off of draco. He clutched his crotch and cried out in pain.
Overall everyone was having an amazing day so far, except Ginny Weasley. She was sitting alone in her dorm room, sulking. Curled up on her bed. There were traces of dried tears on her cheeks. Her head was hurting & her heart was breaking.
"Ron I really hope that you're right, but my nerves are driving me crazy. My instincts are telling me that something is very off. I hope I'm wrong but I just wanna be sure." Said Hermione.
"Ron we've been through this thousands of times! Yes we should trust him, he's changed now & He needs our help!" I replied him tiredly.
"And well if you feed someone 3 spoonfuls, that person becomes mad with lust and completely looses the control over himself. No matter what happens he won't be able to stop himself until the deed is done. There's no going back!
Hermione looked her in the eyes and said, "We need to get to the professor Snape urgently. Now he's our only hope!"
"Strangely that potion didn't work on him. I followed all the methods correctly, but it didn't show any results. So I tried to coax him into having sex with me, cause I really wanted to get pregnant (of course I didn't tell him that). It was going to be our first time, & we both are inexperienced. So he's looking for some magical literature & spells which can make the experience easy & enjoyable." Her cheeks turned scarlet red again.
Ron didn't say anything. He was in a dilemma. He really wanted to believe in Hermione's gut feelings, but he wasn't ready to accept that his sister might have done something wrong. He couldn't make a choice.
I worked so freaking hard for this story. I’ve rewritten last chapter 3 times cause I didn’t like the outcome. So I’m doing everything to make this as good as possible! & I saw that at least few of you are interested in this!
"I really tried to give space to Harry, I-I swear I tried to cope with what he's going through." She said that looking directly at Draco with guilt in her eyes.
Physical distance between them was not a major issue for her, it was his demeanour, his behaviour. It was changed or at least she felt that way.
Harry crushed all the attempts of Draco to break free. He was fuming. He couldn't understand why Draco was denying him his love. It made him little upset too. He quickly made his clothes disappear with wandless spell. Harry was completely naked now.
"HELP!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!! HELPPPPPPPP...." Draco started screaming for help. He was hoping that someone will hear him and then tear down this door & save him. His heart was beating faster. He was so so terrified.
“Malfoy!?” Harry appeared out of no where behind them, he was looking at Draco with great lust in his eyes.
She had put brave face in front of the Draco & told him that she understood everything he said, even tho she was dying from within. She didn't wanna give him a wrong impression or didn't want him to see her as a stupid selfish bitch, No. So she kept quiet! Even if Draco was right in his place, is it easy to love someone like that? To not expect anything in return? To just give yourself away?
She knows that he's going through rough times, she just wanna be part of it, she wanna get more involved with him like Ron & Hermione. Why can't he share his burden with her, why can't he talk. It doesn't have to be romantic. She just wants to be there with him. She wants to be the person who comforts him. She loves him so much that's why she craves any contact with him.. but he's always with Ron, Hermione & now Even with Draco. & this thought made her cry again!
“I’m trying to gather up the loose ends,” Harry says, sitting on the floor, eyes closed, wedding ring clenched in the palm of his hand. “But there are more than I can count.”
“I’ve been here almost every night since we came back to Hogwarts this year,” Potter confides eventually. “It’s quiet.”
“I’m not sure,” Draco tells him. “I doubt there is anything you could do since I’m pretty sure I’m right.”
He’s manhandled into the chair in the middle of the courtroom and the Wizengamot jury’s eyes are focused on him as one. Harry doesn’t have to wonder at how it must feel—the shock and terror and sheer overwhelming too-muchness of it. But oh, Malfoy.
He moves towards Draco, his strides long and his arms bulging under the unflattering Auror robes, and anticipation surges in Draco like the rearing head of a dormant serpent waking at the scent of blood.
After a few minutes of Draco patterning Harry’s neck with bruises where he licks around an oval scar between Harry’s collarbones, just above his chest, traces the sharp jut of their curves with his tongue and tastes the salt on Harry’s skin, revelling in the citrusy scent he has grown so accustomed to these days, Harry raises himself on his elbows and in one smooth motion straddles Draco’s hips. He’s heavy in a way that makes Draco feel held down, protected from floating away, anchored in a moment that feels far too good to be reality. They lean forward into each other, kissing some more, sometimes deeply and gently, apologies and admissions in their touch, sometimes with teeth and sharp edges and bites which offer the edge Draco so desperately needs to feel good. It’s all in those kisses, the unspoken words, the I want you’s and the I’m sorry’s, the please don’t let this ever end and this is what heaven tastes like. When it comes Harry’s turn to paint on the pristine canvas that is Draco’s skin, he traces his tongue down Draco’s throat, over the bob of his Adam’s apple to the hollow between his collarbones. Here he bites down and Draco gasps and digs his nails into Harry’s cotton pyjama shirt. Harry keeps at it, first flicking his tongue over a spot delicately, then biting down on it, pinching a sliver of skin between two teeth and then sucking until Draco is a writhing mess underneath him.
‘We need to talk,’ Draco says when Harry walks into the kitchen the next morning, clad in nothing but boxers, blinking blearily through his spectacles and yawning.
Her voice is even, careful. It betrays no hint of what she’s feeling and Harry has no idea when Hermione learnt to be so careful. The realisation that to navigate the minefields that are him and Ron, set off at the wrong word, she must have
There’s a straw held to his lips and he raises his head slightly to get a better angle at it. Cool, fresh water washes his mouth and the relief he feels almost makes up for the truly unbearable headache.
“Are you not allowed to answer, or do you just… not?” Scorpius asks again. He isn’t angry, or even upset. Death seems to have cast a film over his emotions. They’re all still there, just muted.
But Harry’s already shaking his head, the wistful expression on his face growing more entrenched by the second.
Rome is an oil painting, vibrant and bold, an experience in existence, history binding its cobblestones tight. They take long walks through the streets at night, the warm glow of the lampposts turning the sidewalks golden. It feels like a different era and Harry finds himself patting down his pockets for errant time-turners.
“Harry, I don’t care about you becoming an Auror or not,” Ron says, talking over him the minute he tries to apologise. “I’ve lost one brother, another’s been drinking and barely eating for the last month and probably won’t anytime soon. I just don’t want to lose another.”
January segues into a vibrant February, all blooming buds on trees and soft sunrises and softer sunsets. Pink and gold and lush green exist in starbursts of colour and natural glory all around them.
Scorpius, perching on the arm of his chair had buried his head in his hands. Death, silent and watchful as ever had not asked why.
For the first time since the War, Draco found purpose in doing something proactive and Scrivenshaft’s quickly became a second home. His extensive collection of blank, sleek notebooks grew by the weeks and though perfectly useless, Draco adored how they looked stacked up against each other on his mahogany desk.
“The travelling trio,” Malfoy murmurs, eyes unfocused and lips stained red by wine. His tongue peeks out as he licks his bottom lip free of an errant droplet of wine. Harry isn’t sure if he’s supposed to be as focused as he is on the tiny motion. “Why didn’t you go with?”
To his surprise, Kingsley nods back. A short, slight jerk of his head before he turns away to confer with his assistant, but more recognition than Draco dared to hope for. The small threads of possibility flickering like the flames of sputtering candles on a stormy night twist themselves into something thicker, something warmer in the cold topography of his frozen insides.
Contrary to popular perception and the carefully cultivated image throughout his Hogwarts years, Draco doesn’t like the sort of sex that leaves you lonely the morning after, the too fast, slick slide of skin against skin, the thrusting and the wild abandon.
“I’m here, aren’t I?” Harry asks, growing increasingly more confused. “Why would I have changed my mind and then shown up?”
“Turn around,” Draco tells Harry. Harry gives him a questioning look. “The scars on your back,” Draco hastens to clarify.
She doesn’t take him up on the innuendo or the callous way in which he speaks of his dead child. If she wasn’t bound by an inked Unbreakable Vow, the press would be orgasming from the pleasure of this scoop.
Draco’s answering blush is probably more revealing than Draco himself would have liked for it to be.
“But I think,” Scorpius says, trying to be gentle, trying to be kind, “I think it’s time to say goodbye.”
“My muggle cousin did that,” Harry says, voice still tense and breaking slightly over some of the words, but considerably less tight than it was before. “He found a bunch of birch twigs in a park once and they made a makeshift whip with them. They played around with it, hitting dogs and stray cats and occasionally each other. Dudley… he got to take it home with him. And I was the plaything, the helpless animal running around in the house susceptible to being beaten and he just went at it. He kept going and going and going… until Aunt Petunia came into his room. She made him stop… but the damage was done. The marks never left.”
He takes his hands from Harry’s shoulder, bringing one down to fist at the bedsheets, and the other to his red, painful cock. He strokes rapidly, quick and purposeful strokes that leave him breathless and panting, and within seconds, he is coming all over his clenched fist. The sounds he makes are muffled and thin against the tightness of Harry’s hand. Harry doesn’t seem to care.
The rest of the trial passes in a blur. Potter’s testimony outweighs the feeble ones provided by others—a couple of barely legal Ravenclaws whose anger seems to be directed more towards the Carrows and Draco’s behaviour as a Hogwarts bully.
“What do I have to be grateful for?” Draco demands, abruptly angry. “I’m in exile. My mother won’t look at me properly because I refuse to use our dried-up well of contacts to get father out of Azkaban. When I go back, I won’t be seen as a respectable pure-blood seeking employment, I will be the disgraced Death Eater, the untrustworthy idiot. People will spit on me in the streets.”
He spins, and almost slips, looking down to catch himself standing in the middle of a puddle of blood. The thin threads holding him upright snap and he rushes out of the Great Hall on shaky knees, retching violently into a pile of rubble gathered outside.
“Sorry, just– I mean– Potter and Weasley. They’re staring at me like they would love to eat me alive. I can’t, I can’t talk with them sitting outside.”
She turns. Waits. She’s probably a Slytherin. Maybe a Ravenclaw. Too composed to be anything else. If she cuts her hair right, she could be mistaken for Pansy Parkinson in the streets. He’ll never admit it, but that’s one of the reasons he hadn’t shown her out sooner.
He cringes the minute the words leave his lips, realising how truly tactless he has been in asking something so evidently sensitive in a fashion quite this crass.
“That bastard deserved it, ‘Mione! Who does he think he is, sitting in my kitchen, drinking my tea?!” It’s getting harder to keep the rage beneath the surface and the look on Hermione’s face makes it clear he isn’t as successful as he thinks.
“No, I did not. Malfoy’s mother is a Black, he has Black blood. The wards and the charms recognise him. I wouldn’t be that idiotic, Harry.” She sounds more exasperated than she has any right to be, bringing Malfoy into his house.
“Then don’t let his ideology steal the compassion from you,” Harry says. “He is not worth doing yourself that disservice.”
“Quiet a few things I imagine,” he hears Harry murmur as he sinks his teeth into one of the delicacies and groans.
“Like you wouldn’t believe,” he murmurs, and raises the whisky glass. It’s an unmistakeable toast, and even in the closed stuffiness of the room, a curtain flutters, as though in answer.
“I know,” Malfoy says. “But she doesn’t. She saw you speak for me, saw you speak for her, heard you sent a written recommendation for Theo and so she—” He hesitates and says in a carefully blank voice, “She hoped.”
“Why don’t I fetch the ingredients while you lecture Potter on the importance of the cause?” Draco says, getting up. Hermione glares at him and Potter looks concerned. Draco turns away, unwilling to let them see the smile on his face.
The scar on Harry’s forehead looks like the jagged edges of lightning expanding on to Harry’s forehead. As though it had only caught on a corner of Harry’s being. This one is larger, more defined and prominent and more alarmingly, obviously recent. This Curse Harry had taken straight to the chest. But the commonality between the two, the obvious resemblance to lightning is there. And Draco knows of only one Curse that leaves a mark like that.
He knows she’d been thankful she was dying when it had finally happened. Malfoy vanity is unparalleled, but Black vanity is unsurpassed.
She shrugs. “He’s been pulling away for a while. Two years, give or take. I always thought, I always
‘Lie back, Harry,’ Draco says, and it isn’t a request, isn’t something he’s asking for. It’s a command and Harry finds his body complying even before his brain has fully processed the command.
Instead of having an appropriate answer ready, Draco is completely unprepared for the question. “Um– uh– I mean– you know what I mean– you know, sex! Sex, I mean, sex!”
That they had fallen out of love, when wands were raised in the courtroom, Draco and Harry facing each other down with jaws clenched in rage and eyes barely disguising the depth of hurt in them.
“We’re already having sex,” he points out, a little redundantly. Harry exhales and tries to not be annoyed.
“I assure you what they’re saying in the papers about me, my son, or my family is of no interest to me. It hasn’t been for years, Ms. Richards.”
And Draco’s expression scrunches into one even more endearing as he contemplates Harry with total bewilderment.
There are no Hallows without a Master. If the Master dies of natural causes, Death is Master once more and all is right with the world.
Harry turns on him where they’re sitting, waiting at the Portkey office, behind five other bleary-eyed witches and wizards. “If you have something to say, spit it out,” he says, patience wearing thin.
When the Sobering Potion begins to course through his veins, the burning sensation first tingles slightly and then begins to hurt. It is mighty unpleasant and he fails to hide his wince while he feels the contents of his stomach rising to his throat, cleansing his blood of the alcohol remnants.
“This part’s a bit like entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters from Muggle London,” he says, gesturing forward. “You go through this arch right here and then you need to focus. There’s another arch, two feet in front of this one, but the Muggles can’t see it because it’s Glamoured. You need a magical core to enter it.” He watches Potter nod and says, “I’m going to disappear into thin air.”
, says the part of him that still lives in the cold cell of Azkaban, grey chill seeping into his bones. Sometimes Draco wonders if those wispy tendrils of darkness made their way into his heart and took up residence there. He wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case. He’s used to dealing with darkness within himself, planted by another.
Malfoy pauses. His hands are stuffed into the pockets of his trench coat, pale wrists a sliver of vulnerability between the unforgiving stretches of dark fabric. The line of his back is rigid and tense, as though Harry’s words have triggered dual responses within him, his body and his mind pulling in opposite directions as he struggles to settle on one. He looks like something out of a historical fiction graphic novel, the ominously flickering lights of the alley throwing his profile into dramatic shadows. He turns partway to look over his shoulder without straining his neck at an awkward angle and Harry recognises the light of curious concern in his partially visible eyes.
When would be an ideal time for you? Today evening would be good if you could make it, but if not, let me know what time is convenient. The address is 12, Grimmauld Place. The house is under Fidelius so be careful with that knowledge.
The receptionist looks among the three of them and lets him know that there are no more extra rooms. Draco offers to put Parkinson up somewhere else, but she acquires a look so terrified on her face at the prospect of being left somewhere alone that Draco eventually sighs and throws his hands up.
When Hermione tells him about the Pureblood and Muggle Culture Project, Harry stares at her for a few long moments before whispering, “That’s brilliant.” Hermione smiles and says, “I know,” and Harry feels slightly stupid for being an absolute knob about it in the kitchen the other day.
The Healer nods and when they back away, she casts some privacy charms around herself and Ron and begins to say things to him that they can’t hear.
Draco shrugs. He doesn’t want to talk to Potter anymore. He needs Potter out of his house. As soon as possible. “She’s your friend, ask her.”
Sometimes he hates Weasley and Granger for having this man to themselves. Other times, he’s grateful for them, for the rejection, for the years that shaped Harry Potter into the kind of man who saved the world from everything Draco Malfoy stood for.
He sees the way Granger looks wildly between him and Potter, how Ginevra looks up from her heated argument with Finnegan with an indecipherable expression. How Longbottom drops his fork when Potter greets him, how Thomas’ face breaks out in a smile.
Potter looks thoughtful again. “We could split the trip,” he says. “Go somewhere you want. And go somewhere I want. Six months each.”
Malfoy looks away, an uncomfortable blush rising high on his cheekbones. “I leave tomorrow, Potter,” he says. “I don’t want any trouble before that. I’ll pay for your things and we’ll be on our way.” He swallows and repeats, “I don’t want any trouble.”
With a pang of guilt, Harry remembers his promise to come back home early today and Draco’s answering snort of disbelief followed by a rather acerbic, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it, Potter.’
It’s unfair, how good he can look at 11 on a night when he isn’t going clubbing. At the moment, he’s looking at Draco downing his second shot of Ogden’s Old like flavoured soda with what looks like mild amusement tinged with exasperation and Draco turns away with a scowl.
“I told him we would leave!” She bursts out all of a sudden. “I told him we would leave and he’s been this way for so long, scared and lonely and frightened and it’s all because of one stupid, impulsive thing I said!”
and Harry seems to understand his teasing ministrations are driving Draco over an edge because finally, fucking
Draco gets off the bed and walks around to stand at the foot of it. Harry remains sitting, feeling slightly self conscious as Draco’s gaze roves hungrily over his body. Draco’s still wearing pants and Harry’s stark naked on the bed and though his body isn’t anything Draco hasn’t seen before, the knowledge of what’s to come makes him want to cover himself up childishly.
“Have you considered modernising the shop?” Draco had asked after Archibald had finished blaming his pathetic condition on every factor that wasn’t his incompetence. “After the War, people aren’t looking for traditional supplies and techniques anymore. Selling parchment made of imported plants and macaw feather quills will not bring you new customers.”
But the damage has been done. Somewhere deep inside the recesses of Draco’s heart, he had hoped that Potter had seen some of what he had gone through. Had understood it on some level. Had, if not sympathised, at least empathised. He had explained why he sat on the kitchen floor, thinking Potter was hallucination and despite what he had seen, the prick couldn’t just let it go.
The ladle clatters to the side of the cauldron, slipping from Draco’s hand with the force of his surprise.
“The things I cast with it, the things I couldn’t stop myself from having to cast with this wand… you redeemed them all with that Expelliarmus. I can’t take it back and… taint it again.” A wistful smile finds its way onto his face. "It deserves better than that."
It is the last thing Scorpius hears before he gives into the tug of dreamless sleep beckoning him closer to an eternity of it.
He turns back, pulls open a drawer, and Scorpius knows by the curl of his biceps, that he’s cradling the picture of the three of them together that he keeps secreted away from Draco’s supposedly derisive gaze. Not that Draco would ever step into this room– but in the rare occasion that he might, Harry doesn’t want to take any chances. The picture, it’s a testament to a weakness Harry couldn’t afford when Scorpius had been ill, and one that is all-consuming in its shamefulness now that Scorpius is dead.
“No one really knows,” she says, abruptly breaking the silence. “With Harry, I mean. No one knows what his deal is.”
He brushes his fingers over the strange oval shaped scar on Harry’s chest. Without saying anything, he leans down and brushes his lips against it. Even though Harry obviously saw it coming, he startles strangely.
. He sounds coarse and rough, and exactly like he’s spent the last few minutes deepthroating Draco’s cock, and it’s delicious in ways Draco does not know where to begin to list.
He would push Harry away and apologise, ask for a little space and catch his breath. He knows Harry would understand, would bring a hand to hover over his eyebrow before removing it and walking away, no touch of disappointment in his movements, understanding shrouding his eyes. He knows Harry and Harry is kind in unfathomable ways. But he can’t bring his hands to cooperate.
She shakes her head. “It’s a known fact, of course, but the reasoning is understood to be tradition.”
They’re sitting by the Lake because Hermione is talking to McGonagall about her potential in different career fields and while Draco is trying to write his Charms essay, Potter is throwing stones into the lake, watching the water ripple.
“The witness may be seated,” Kingsley booms. Potter sits. Draco can tell from the way his shoulder jumps that he’s tapping his fingers against his thigh.
‘Fuck!’ He screams as Draco uses a hint of teeth. Draco hums, creating vibrations that course through Harry’s entire body and pool in his stomach, building up to the orgasm Harry can feel coming.
His hair, which he wears in a topknot at home, has loose strands that fly intermittently into Draco’s face with every huff of his breath, casting shadows on his pale skin. His lips are ever so slightly parted and Harry smiles at how innocent Draco can look, how open and vulnerable. He doesn’t get enough opportunities to simply sit back and appreciate that, given that Draco is usually up earlier than him and they fall asleep together.
“Well, pardon me but I thought you were supposed to be at my house on Friday afternoons. Yet, you weren’t. Tell me why I should stick to the first name when you insist on treating me like a stranger?”
He tries to focus past the pounding at his temples and hears the even breathing of somebody else in the room. “Water,” he manages, the word coming out raspy and broken grating against the roof of his raw mouth.
“You have a half empty bottle of Calming Draught in your pocket and I saw you take a drink from it like it is your favourite bottle of Ogden’s Old.”
and remembers with a sick lurch his father’s preferred methods of punishment and why Draco, in his moments as a better human being and a son fit to be disowned, hates him as much as he does.
“Is it okay if I sleep here for some time?” He asks Hermione. She says nothing but simply picks up her book in one hand and pats her thigh with the other. Harry smiles, settling his head on her lap. Before he can thank her, his eyes are closing and he’s drifting off.
‘Never happened?’ Draco asks, and his voice is low. When Harry turns to look at him, his eyes are dark.
“You’re quite right, I don’t care. If you didn’t have an owl, you could have gone to a public owlery. In fact, fuck a public owlery, if you went to the Minister to ask him to lend you his owl, I’m sure he’d do it. Of course, I’m not certain even a public owlery would allow you to send its oldest, blindest owl to me. No, what I don’t understand is why you would want to…” He trails off, uncertain how to put the fact that Granger of all people had suggested a private meeting which Draco could not agree to.
The Wizarding Garden sequestered away behind the old Black property in Sheffield appears to be a crumbling ruin to the Muggles who pass it by everyday.
When Harry’s tongue swipes across his bottom lip, Draco whimpers which Harry uses to deepen the kiss even further. There’s salvation in this kiss, Draco knows. There’s repentance and hope in every breath that ghosts across his skin, in every push of Harry’s tongue against his own.
Birds are chirping. The quiet of the patio is oppressively heavy. Above him, a window slams shut with a sense of finality that chills Draco to his bones.
Harry smiles. It is so innocent, such an unassumingly beautiful expression that something clenched up and tense in Draco’s body eases.
“He’s the one who got us into this mess. He’s going to drag himself out of it,” he says, darkly and promptly looks horrified. Harry thinks he understands. The Malfoys’ honour code would never allow for a transgression against one’s own father in such uncharitable words.
Harry nods and Malfoy moves away from the doorway, further into the house. When Harry steps in, he turns around to look at Harry, confusion etched across his features. “If the Aurors aren’t here, why are you?” His eyes widen suddenly, “Are you going to kill me? Finish the job yourself?” His voice breaks. Harry has felt fear and anger and panic but right at this moment he feels nothing but wonder. Something is so wrong here that it is palpable in the air– Malfoy needs his assurance that Harry isn’t going to kill him. “I’m not here to kill you Malfoy,” he says. “I’m here to apologise.”
Harry’s lips part and his tongue subconsciously emerges and licks them. “Are you sure?” He asks again.
He had stayed shut in for three months after the trials. Potter had spoken for him and though Draco hadn’t been surprised (bloke did owe him a life debt after all), he had not been brave enough to even dream that many individuals shared Potter’s perspective about his war crimes being a result of underage pressure. So he stayed in and aimed futile cleaning charms at the dining table when he could stand to be in the room, for three whole months. The dining table. The living room. The ballroom. The chandeliers. The portraits. The fireplace. He had exhausted himself by casting cleaning charms and brightening charms and none of them seemed to do much good. After three months, his inner Pansy had put her hands on her hips and said fuck it. He set the dining table on fire and watched as it burned.
Draco opens his mouth and Scorpius steels himself to watch another argument, but no cutting words slice through the thickness in the air. Instead, Draco says in a voice cold as ice and smooth as stone, “Would you like me to seal this room up?”
Draco flicks a nipple, a little cautious, a little wary and Harry wants to smooth that expression away with a kiss, with a touch, but he can’t bring his limbs to cooperate because he’s too busy losing himself to the sensation of it. Draco does it again and again and again until Harry is a mess against the sheets, gripping Draco’s biceps agonisingly tightly to keep himself grounded.
She nods before slipping under the covers. Throwing an arm around Weasley’s waist and murmuring a muffled, “Night, Draco,” she drifts off almost as soon as her head hits the pillow.
What is unexpected however, is Granger, a determined look on her features coming up to Draco, placing her hand on his shoulder with surprising firmness and telling him in a low undertone that she would like to meet with him in a less public setting without an ounce of derision or hostility in her tone or her features.
But what does a former Death Eater with a brand on his arm defining the rest of his life know of such things? These honours, they are the rewards of being on the right side of history. This time, the Malfoys unfortunately aren’t.
Maybe it was the memory of her slumped shoulders at breakfast or her hopefulness for Potter’s appearance at lunch.
“-absolutely backdated!” Hermione says, turning around to look at Malfoy. Her cheeks are flushed, her eyes shining with the light they acquire when she has a new project in mind.
He’s always been intense. But now the green of Potter’s eyes has stopped resembling dewy leaves during dusky, sulky summer evenings. Instead, there’s the darkness found in the Forbidden Forest reflected in them, reminiscent of the Great Lake when its waters churn at the bidding of some unknown force.
Instead he bends his head, and presses a soft, delicate kiss to the leaking tip of Draco’s cock. Draco bucks up with a startled gasp at the sensation– Harry’s soft lips touching him the most tender teasing he’s ever experienced in his life.
He turns away as Harry begins stripping off, changing into the crumpled shirt and jeans he draws out from the haphazard depths of his cupboard. Scorpius recognises it as the one Draco had gifted Harry for his thirty fifth birthday. One of the last gifts between them.
Draco’s lips are swollen and heavy from all the kissing they’ve done today and the blowjob he gave Harry earlier  where Harry lost control and gripped his neck and fucked his mouth. Draco had moaned through the whole thing, unbuttoning his own pants to slip a hand in to relieve the pressure on his own cock. It  had been wild and hot and heavy the way it hasn’t been since they were twenty six and rutting themselves dry in a night club.
The anxiety attacks are so frequent that Draco has forgotten how to separate them from his thoughts. Every time he thinks in words, every time he is conscious of his bend of mind, they spiral out of control. Initially he had been afraid but now, now he has learned to live with it. The shortness of breath, dizzying nausea, racing heartbeat, he greets them all like old friends. After all, he thinks slightly bitterly, it isn’t like he has
“Draco’s gay,” Parkinson blurts, suddenly, and all three of them freeze. Draco stares wide-eyed and mortified at the back of her head, Harry stares incredulous and confused at her rapidly reddening face. “I just—” she rushes to clarify, “I just know how it looked when he came out all dishevelled.”
Scorpius opens his eyes to bright light and a sense of unfamiliar emptiness, instinctively aware that he isn’t alive.
“Fuck you too, mate,” Weasley calls from above before he’s cut off by what seems to be a disturbingly high pitched laugh from Hermione.
Harry doesn’t want to open his eyes. Doesn’t want to be faced with the white wall again, doesn’t want to think about leaving and how Draco doesn’t want him around anymore. But Harry is nothing if not confrontational, so he opens them anyway.
At the trial, he’d been too preoccupied with the thoughts of returning to Azkaban and the sheer surprise of having Potter champion his defence. Now, as he watches Potter make his way back to their table in the corner, drinks balanced on a tray, Draco can’t help but think he’s missed something significant.
Now, as he sits on his bathroom floor, exhausted and drained, he lets himself think. The Calming Draught in his system will keep him from more anxiety for a few more hours and Draco finally has the luxury to just think. About Granger’s proposal, about his own reactions, about Potter.
He tries to tune Potter out as Potter slips on his pants, then his trousers, followed by his shirt. He stares up at the ceiling, barely registering the peeling plaster in one corner as his mind whirls through memories and emotions, sucking him into a vortex he doesn’t quite know the way out of anymore. He hears the swish of Harry’s Auror robe as he lifts it from the ground and slips it back on and the low murmur of a breath-freshening charm and a cleaning charm. He pretends to not understand why Harry would need either of those even as his treacherous mind conjures images of Harry and Ginevra in each others’ arms, smiling and laughing and kissing.
“Parkinson,” Harry manages, around the lead in his stomach. If Parkinson is going to spend the rest of Draco’s exile with him, there is absolutely no need for Harry to stay anymore. He steels himself for an eventuality where Draco will politely tell him to make himself scarce and winces internally from the heart-wrenching pain of the thought.
“It’s not working out,” Harry says, and Draco’s heart, small and weak as it is, feels like it’s being pushed through a shredder. “We’re not working out.”
It’s not electric. But it is warming and Harry feels it from the tips of his fingers to the backs of his calves to the arch of his neck. Every part of him quiets as Draco brings a hand up to cradle his head. His stomach flips when their mouths part and the kiss goes from chaste to open-mouthed and a little hungry.
“You don’t like me!” Draco says, losing the last vestiges of his control, during his hands in his hair. He must look ridiculous, sitting up in the large bed in the middle of the room, hair a mess and voice too high pitched to not be embarrassing. “You! You hate me, I don’t understand! Since yesterday, since the damn courtroom, you’ve been so bloody nice, it’s driving me absolutely insane and the first time you react like you’re supposed to, you come here and call it unwarranted, I don’t—”
And so when he lifts the Glamour and keeps it away in his box of memories of a time he would rather lock away, the Glamour leaves his scars naked and exposed under the unreliable protection of clothing.
He can hear voices. Some sound like his mother’s, tinkling and cheerful, asking him to come home. Some like Sirius’, boisterous and tinged with mirth, repeating
His charges are read out, the voice reading them tinged with derision, contempt and disgust. Draco at fourteen would have shuddered with indignant fury at the tone. Draco at seventeen accepts it.
Then he clatters back up the stairs, leaving the cup and the paper where Draco will find it the second he steps into the kitchen.
He doesn’t know how long he sleeps but when he wakes up, there’s an arm thrown over his waist and a lean, warm body pressing into his back. Something in his chest hums contentedly, sounding an awful lot like a cheesy Celestina Warbeck song and for a split second, everything is perfect, everything is quiet. He revels in the peace, both outside and in the deepest recesses of his heart, peace that he hasn’t known in his life for longer than he cares to admit to anyone besides himself.
“Oh, those. I– since sixth year. That’s why the built up tolerance got to this point.” He hears the sharp intake of breath, knows they’re both thinking of the same thing at the mention of sixth year. Subconsciously, Draco touches the scar on his chest, or rather where it is supposed to be under the glamour. He keeps his all his scars under glamours, the Manor has too many polished surfaces. Of all the things he wants to see, his mangled skin isn’t one of them.
Draco’s cheeks hollow and fill under Harry’s palm as he sucks a bruise into the juncture between Harry’s shoulder and his neck, a sensitive spot that never fails to have Harry writhing just a little, letting control slip through his fingers like water. He sinks his hands into Draco’s hair, holding him in place, shoving his head back against the wall, uncaring as it smarts from the thud.
– looking every bit the rugged, handsome man from the photo albums Harry had shown him. His smile is like a beam of light, charming like a revelation and Scorpius finds traces of Father in the aristocratic line of the nose, in the slender, tapering fingers and the beautiful eyes.
Draco’s certain Pansy notices more than she lets on from the other side of the table, but he isn’t about to confront that knowledge. This thing between him and Harry is fragile, a baby bird learning to fly, and up until he’s certain of its strength, Draco wants to shelter it with everything he has.
“Here you are, dictating Harry should get help for his behaviour but you with what I can only assume is crippling anxiety, see no one and do nothing about it? That sounds hypocritical to me, Malfoy.”
“Because people might spit at you in the wizarding world because you chose to be a blood-purist and a bully, but if you walk the streets of Muggle London, or hell, anywhere, you’re still a white man in expensive clothes and people won’t shield their purses and wallets from you, won’t call the police if you bump into them or crash into them on the bus.”
He expects Harry to fade away, for his imagination to give up when it realises Draco has caught on. But instead, Harry raises Draco’s fingers to his lips, presses a gentle kiss to the pads of them and says, “Does this feel real?”
“‘m not jealous,” Draco says, burrowing further into the luxurious leather beanbag he has chosen to flung himself onto. “Why would I be jealous? I’m
Hermione had told him to travel and Harry hadn’t known what he’d been signing himself up for when he’d agreed. But if travel is this, then Harry will gladly travel for the rest of his life.
Harry shakes his head. “I don’t know yet,” he admits. “I like girls, Cho and Ginny, those were real. But I think I might—” he closes his eyes and braces for the admission, for the first time he’s going to let the words cross the threshold of his lips, “I think I might like boys too.”
Lucius Malfoy was of course in Azkaban, and therefore heard nothing of Uncle Archie’s lengthy list of woes, but Narcissa and Draco both suffered through his lengthy tirade about the post-war economy and Shacklebolt’s ineptitude as Minister.
He pretends it has nothing to do with not being able to look himself in the eye and face everything he said–
There’s a constricting sensation around his throat, and he chokes on the words. “I kept fucking asking you,” says Harry from the other side of the bed, voice low and deadly, “to shut the fuck up.”
“Master,” they say, and it takes Scorpius a moment to realise what they might be insinuating. “My Master.”
“So I’ll just stay here till one or both of them decide to die?” He asks, watching as Draco pours a glass out, dangerously overfilling it.
“Take me where?” Says a voice behind them and both Draco and Hermione whip around in surprise to see Potter standing there, shifting awkwardly on his feet. He hasn’t made an effort with his hair and his sweater is much too large for his frame but he has a satchel which looks like it has a couple books. He looks a little intimidated and Draco is reminded of the little wizard he had come across in a robe shop with spectacles too large for his eyes and a face full of surprised wonder.
“I am here to testify to what Draco Malfoy is,” Potter begins and Draco hears the distinct terms he’s using grate against the fragile flutters of his ill-advised hope.
There’s awkward silence again, but it feels less suffocating. Less overwhelming. The guilt still burrows deep, and his world is in shambles, but he’s not writhing on the floor from the pain of a thousand stinging jinxes. It’s a win.
“You barely ever think about yourself, boy,” an old man had told him, during his lengthy hospitalisation when all the private rooms were occupied and he had to be stuck with the ‘riff-raff’ (Draco had said that, turning up his nose during the visiting hours, though keeping his voice blessedly low) for a few days. “You never understand how much of your life isn’t about your life at all until it’s about to end.”
He stubs the cigarette out on the ledge of the window and vanishes it. He takes one last look at the starless night sky and draws in a deep, steadying breath. It doesn’t help much, but he feels less like he’s about to explode and more like he’s about to fall apart, and that makes all the difference in the world.
A hush descends for a minute. “There’s something you must understand,” Death says at last, “before I explain anything else.”
Harry isn’t good with words, not the way Hermione is, or even Draco himself. He’s acceptable when he writes down what he wants to say or when he’s so wound up that words he didn’t know existed in his vocabulary make themselves known. But he has a better track record with actions, so he pulls Draco down for another kiss, taking care to angle their heads right so their lips meet in a gentle, soft collision that doesn’t feel like a hurtling comet but instead like an alignment of the stars.
Ps. Here’s the interaction between Ginny & Draco! I tried to write Ginny as cute drama Queen! Let’s see how it goes..
"Draco, This is the map of Hogwarts. I won't go in details right now, but let me tell you that It shows location of everyone within the walls of this castle. There are moving dots of everyone's name. Let's look for Harry & Ginny in this." Said Hermione.
"Well he's umm you know - well umm looking for some book." Said Ginny meekly. Her face turned scarlet red.
"Fred & George! I caught them sneaking once, so they explained everything to me, now I go there too!” She said with a grin. This girl is full of mischief.
Harry was not listening at all, or rather he wasn't able to! He continued to kiss Draco's face. "Ohh Merlin I love you" kiss "I love you so much" kiss "I love you" kiss. Draco was still struggling to get out of Harry's grip. He was trying to push him away, punching him on his torso, but Harry was completely unaffected by it. He was keep chanting, "I love you so much Draco! My heart hurts. I love you so freaking much!"
"Can someone explain what is this potion?" Hermione has never heard of that potion before. But judging from Draco's reaction she realised it must be something very bad!
"No I really want to, Granger. Ever since you mentioned about that potion, I feel anxious. I understand that You're worried for Potter & well I'm worried for Ginny. I wanna talk to her, Please let me accompany you."  Said Draco with earnestness.
Ginny was completely horrified. She had no clue. "Ohh Merlin!! I didn't know about any of that! Please Believe me Draco!"
Hey if you’re okay with Dark stuff, welcome to this fic! 😁❤️ Please show me a sign that you’re interested! I’m planning on making this long fic! So please please do comment & share your views! ❤️
"Well do you not remember that how determined you were about proving Draco death eater in the beginning!? God how much me & Ronald tried to make you understand but you were not ready to listen!" Said Hermione with a smirk.
"Woah can't believe! Ginny is friendly with the ferret too! Treacherous!! My sister!! My OWN SISTER!!" Said Ron with a huff!
She was thinking harder. & suddenly one thought popped in her head.. "where all the knowledge of dark articles available in the Hogwarts?! The restricted section!"  This is too dangerous But she really wanted to do it. Now all she needs, is a good plan.
The Hogwarts's library is very vast and full of splendour. They began to walk towards the more intimate part of the library.
How in the name of Merlin that happened! How could Harry be immune to spells! It didn't make sense at all. They were shocked by this, but they didn't have time to react. Cause Potter was right behind their backs. So they kept running.
"Ohh it just slipped. I can't tell you that Hermione, it's not my place to tell. It's her personal stuff." Said Draco with hesitation.
Ron didn't make any attempt to join their venture. Hermione and Draco didn't wanna waste any time. They felt as if each passing second is crucial, so they ran towards the library.
Harry's body was burning from within, it was screaming at him to claim his gorgeous lover, his Dray. His lover's beautiful porcelain white skin was glowing in the moonlight. His luscious silky platinum locks were wet with sweat. His feature were so so delicate. His cheeks turned into beautiful shade of red. Harry looked into those mesmerising grey eyes, which often tormented his dreams. Those rosey pink lips, he wanted to taste so bad. It was almost unbelievable that His lover was a human, how could any human being look so ethereal! He stared at him in awe. his beauty simply added fuel to his fire.
"Hey, if it's bothering you so much dear, then talk to Ginny about it, okay? She'll clear your doubts." Said Ron with reassuring smile.
"Mione, wait! maybe we're just overreacting. Maybe they're just having some alone time, you- you know what I mean." Said Ron awkwardly. "I don't wanna walk in on my sister & my best friend." Ron sighed.
No, they're shiny grey eyes, sooooo deep & intense!! Always look at me as if they're asking some unspoken question! The questions that I could never answer! They're just beautiful & full of warmth.. as if they're made just to hypnotise me & to drown me in their depth.
When she woke up, she felt much better. Her head was clear now. As if that cloud of negativity has passed. She blamed those earlier thoughts on her insecurities & bad habit of overthinking.
"Hermione, Ginny, we have to do something. If we'll keep on running like this, he'll catch us in no time!" Said Draco Anxiously.
Those emerald green eyes used to look at her with such warmth & love, how did they become so cold now? When did those smiles stopped coming her ways? He smiles now too, but it doesn't feel so genuine.
It was the most bizarre moment for Draco. He never saw Harry so in love, so vulnerable before. How much his heart craved for hearing this! But then realisation struck down on him. 'He's saying this for Ginny, he's under the effects of the defective potion. He's thinking that I'm Ginny.' Draco felt his heart breaking into million pieces.
“You know,” Draco looked up at Harry’s sudden statement. “He was never all that talkative until you came along. Andromeda suspected his delay in speech was in part due to the fact that he was able to effectively communicate with his metamorph abilities, but,” Harry paused. “It was almost as if he knew something in his life was missing. That kind of trauma…” Harry trailed off.
“Draco,” Harry whispered as Draco took one of the auror’s erect nipples into his mouth and sucked at it mercilessly.
“Why don’t you let me show you?” Harry whispered. He reached out and took Draco’s face in his hands as he closed the gap between their lips.
Harry pulled back, breathless from the intensity of the kiss. “I can’t even begin to tell you how much I missed you,” he whispered against Draco’s lips with their foreheads pressed together.
The way Harry moaned and twisted his face in pleasure each time the blonde grazed his prostate. The way Harry squirmed under Draco occasionally brushing up against his cock. The erotic sounds emanating from the auror’s mouth were nearly enough to drive Draco to the edge on their own. He couldn’t take it anymore. He needed Harry and he needed him now.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco asked, trying his best to convey that Harry’s presence wasn’t entirely welcomed.
“I know you can’t look at me when you’re lying. I know you think you’re protecting me by pushing me away. And I know that whatever it is can’t be worse than losing you again.”
“Never mind,” he said as he walked past Harry and disappeared into another room of the house, but not before adding another thought. “At least I’m no longer the only one intervening in his pathetic attempts at suicide.”
When Draco was presented with an opportunity to fully commit to Astoria, he froze. Draco should have denied it outright, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He loved Astoria, he truly did, but he still loved Harry as well.
Draco slid inside and began to thrust deep inside of Astoria. Their sighs and moans complemented one another as his pace quickened. Astoria was reduced to a writhing mess when she began to touch herself. She reached her climax with a shout. Her walls clenched around Draco, who was not far behind.
“The ministry has an arsenal of deadly poisons and potions. Almost all of which are illegal. Why do you ask?”
“Maybe if you were honest with yourself you’d be able to see that the only thing that ruined your relationship was the fact that you were too selfish to just settle for one lover instead of two.
“Please,” Draco accepted Harry’s offer then lifted Teddy carefully before carrying him upstairs to put him to bed.
“Late 17th century I assume,” Draco said. “Although, I’m not entirely sure. Malcolm is very private about his age.”
Eventually he wasn’t even able to feed at all and his hunger reduced him to a corps like state. Malcolm had given up trying to get him out of the house figuring that at least if Draco stayed in bed he wouldn’t have to pull him out of the sunlight.
“If I knew you’d make me do excessive physical activity on my day off I would have never agreed to come,”
Harry could see the gears in Draco’s brain turning as he began to connect the dots. He’d visibly  clenched his jaw and his entire person had become tense. “Are you saying the ministry killed Adriel?” Draco’s words were barely a whisper, but the venom behind them was clear as day.
Draco flashed his fangs and the man’s eyes widened in terror as his gaze locked on the needle like teeth that protruded from Draco’s gums.
Draco followed Harry to the living room. He looked around the room that had not changed since the last time he had been there. Not that he figured it would have, but images of their last night together flooded his mind. It was almost as if he could see the scraps of clothing that had started at the couch and made a trail to the bedroom, hear the heavy breathing and stumbling up the stairs. Only now, Draco felt like an outsider. He felt unwelcome in a place that used to bring him comfort.
“Draco, I’m tired of waiting,” she continued before giving Draco a chance to speak up. “I love you and I love being with you and I can’t picture anyone else in your place. You say you love me yet you keep us in this relationship purgatory. Look, I’ve reached a point in my life where I want a real relationship. I’m not talking about marriage, but I want some sort of stability. Something that could possibly have a future. Are you willing to give that to me?”
“What’s on your mind, love?” Draco asked Astoria as they lie tangled in the bedsheets. She’d been quiet all evening which was unlike her.
“No! Of course not!” Draco defended. He would never dream of doing such a thing to Astoria. As far as Draco was concerned, the Harry situation was handled.
After running his plan past Robards it was easy to get his hands on a batch of Polyjuice Potion. And with plenty of his target’s more high profile customers in custody at the ministry, choosing an identity was just as simple.
Before Draco had a chance to protest, Harry took the glass from his hand and placed it on the table in front of them. Harry then took Draco’s hand in his and guided them toward the dance floor.
Harry didn’t have to clarify before Draco realized what he’d been referring to. He finally looked at Harry only to have his suspicion realized. Draco knew what this meant. He’d been here before. Sensing another’s mood and thoughts and intentions without a word passing between them. He didn’t want to believe it, wrecking his brain for another possible explanation of the phenomena.
“Hey, kiddo!” Harry greeted Teddy. “Sorry I’m late. There was a late arrest and we were slammed with paperwork.” Harry addressed Draco this time.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. As if he had a choice. Instead, he smiled politely and said it was no trouble.
“Hey,” Draco knelt down so he was level with Teddy. He scooped up the child and sat him on his knee before wiping his cousin’s eyes. “I’ll still be around, Teddy Bear.”
Harry’s breath quickened when Draco’s hand began to make its way towards the waistline of his jeans. His delicate fingers swiftly undid the buttons and slid into his pants, taking Harry’s shaft in his hand. Harry gasped when Draco began to stroke him slowly. He was hard in Draco’s grasp when Draco pulled him free.
Glancing around him, Draco was shocked to see that he was in his office rather than his bed. He was even more shocked to see a sleeping Harry in the chair behind his desk with his feet perched on the fixture.
Draco’s first instinct was to fight for them, but he didn’t have the energy to argue anymore. He did know Harry was right and it pained him to admit it.
Harry had been chipping away at the wall Draco had built up over so many years of pain and sadness and neglect since the day they’d been reacquainted. And he’d finally broken through.
Harry tugged at the waistband of Draco’s trousers, making quick work at undoing and discarding them and pulling Draco free from his pants.
There was a long moment of silence before Astoria spoke again. “I don’t think I can do this anymore, Draco.”
Harry might not have realized, but it was clear now to Draco. He was falling in love with Harry, and Harry with him.
Draco leaned in to kiss Astoria and lift her up so she was properly seated on the counter. She ran her hands over his chest as he ran his up her thigh. He was delighted to find that the shirt was, in fact, the only thing she was wearing. Draco smiled into their kiss at the discovery and began to massage her clit.
He was not left waiting long, and Harry’s tongue lapped at his hole. Draco groaned deep into the pillow under his head and pushed his hips back, begging for more. Harry replaced his tongue with his fingers, which were coated in lube laced with his magic. Harry fingered Draco expertly, hitting all the right places.
Draco now realized why Harry had been so protective over Teddy. They were the same after all. Sure Draco’s relationship with his parents was strained but he still had parents. A deep sadness began to form in the pit of Draco’s stomach and Harry seemed to notice.
Draco eyed the page in disbelief as he tried to wrap his mind around his discovery. It shouldn’t have been possible. Bloodroot was a highly regulated substance. He had never handled it, not even at the high level of potions work he had achieved in his previous life. As much has he wished it weren’t true, Draco couldn’t deny that this was a far more nefarious act than he had originally thought.
“Potter? What are you doing here?” Robards’ words sent a chill down Draco’s spine. He didn’t dare turn around to face the other man.
It was a special kind of love. One that Draco had been chasing, and thought he had found in Adriel. But here, back in Harry’s arms, Draco knew nothing else could ever compare.
“Right, well,” Robards’ spoke up clearly sensing the tension between them and pointedly avoided to address it. “No use in dawdling. Let’s get started, shall we?”
“I would have thought all your training would make this a breeze. If I knew you were just going to complain I would have asked someone else to help me,” Draco teased.
Draco quietly got out of bed, careful to not wake Astoria, and slipped on his discarded briefs from the night before. He descended the stairs and went to the kitchen to start a pot of tea and look for something to make for his and Astoria’s breakfast. He had placed the kettle on the stovetop when something on the windowsill caught his eye.
Once they had all said their goodbyes, Harry helped Draco with the last of his things and they apparated to an alley that opened up to a quiet street.
Draco looked toward the rugged man who stirred in his sleep, a man who had saved Draco’s life on multiple occasions, and wondered if he’d ever be able to repay him.
Robards’ words faded to the back of Draco’s mind. He was far too focused on his efforts to not look over at Harry to be concerned with anything else.
Draco through for a moment. “If I hurry I can get it from the house and still be back in time to open.”
Teddy fell asleep in Draco’s lap before the movie ended. Neither of the men went to turn it off once they noticed the little one had drifted off.
Harry shoved his tongue into Draco’s mouth with little resistance. His hands continued to explore Draco’s body, this time using them to shed Draco of his clothing as well.
Teddy wrapped his arms as far around Draco as they could go and buried his face into Draco’s chest. Draco held Teddy and rubbed his back. “You’re free to visit whenever you like. And I’ll have a special place just for you once I’m settled.”
Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as he came, edged on by the sounds of Harry’s release. And as quickly as it began, it was over.
It was only when Harry placed his hand on Draco’s thigh when he froze. Not because he didn’t like it. In fact it was the complete opposite. And that’s what frightened him. He’d spent so much time trying to push his feelings away. But butterflies filled Draco’s stomach as Harry’s large hand gently squeezed his upper thigh. His mind went foggy as he slowly looked into Harry’s eyes.
“Good.” Pansy said. “Look, I’m not saying you have to propose. But you might want to let her know that you’re serious.”
It was a slow night for the market. It was nearly last call when Draco noticed a sly handoff. He quickly descended from the balcony overlooking the crowd careful to keep eyes on his target.
Draco found himself lost in his work, connecting dots where he could and noting gaps in the information. He hadn’t even noticed that the sun had fully set until he got up to start another pot of coffee. Once he realized how late it had gotten, Draco opted for a glass of water instead of the extra caffeine.
Harry sighed and wondered if Draco would always be this stubborn. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
Harry stood from his chair and was out of the office as soon as Robards’ said they were finished. Draco let out a sigh of relief for not having to face Harry.
There was a brief moment devoid of touch of any kind where Harry coated his length in lube. Harry  grasped Draco’s hip with one hand and lined himself up to Draco’s hole with the other. The next moment was pure bliss as Harry pressed into Draco, stretching him wide as he pushed past the pliant ring of muscle until he was completely seated inside him.
“Perhaps to start. But think about how many people you’d be able to meet while you fetch them coffee. You could make some important connections with your superiors that might lead to better and more permanent job opportunities.”
Harry’s eyes lit up and he wasted no time capturing Draco’s lips with his own. The heat between them was eminent. Harry possessively held Draco and pushed him further into his desk. His hands feverishly roamed Draco’s body, reclaiming every inch of the blonde.
“Well,” Harry mirrored the action leaving barely enough room for them to breathe without touching. “You might have to buy my silence.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much, sweetheart. Most of the ministry officials aren’t as squeaky clean as they appear.”
Harry’s tongue ran along Draco’s bottom lip before Draco opened his mouth welcoming it inside. This time Draco didn’t hold back the sounds that fought to escape his lips. He moaned into Harry’s open mouth and pulled him in closer with hands that were tightly anchored to the black haired man’s hips. Harry shifted so his legs were on either side of Draco’s hips. He began to steadily grind against Draco, who continued to kiss him fiercely. Draco rocked his hips to match Harry’s rhythm. Inciting various sounds of pleasure from both of the men.
“And exactly how long ago was that?” Harry asked, referring to the vintage clothing that adorned the man in the portrait.
Teddy lifted his head and looked up at Draco. His cheeks were flushed from crying and Draco, not for the first time, wondered just how the child had managed to steal his heart in such a short time.
“The Reform had just begun when I joined the Aurors,” Harry began. He tried his best to keep his voice steady, but in turn found his hands were shaking. He knew Draco would notice, but he forced himself to continue.
Draco woke up to the sight of Astoria sleeping in his arms. He smiled at the thought of being greeted by this sight every morning. Images of what their future might hold flooded his mind, and Draco found himself fantasizing about things he’d previously thought he could live without. Marriage, children, building a life with someone and growing old together. Draco had never thought he’d want these things. But the thought of having Astoria in his life filled him with so much joy that he couldn’t help but hope for a future together.
The next day, Draco set up a deal on the far end of Knockturn Alley. The trade off was quick and painless. The dealer didn’t ask questions and barely glanced at Draco when he made the handoff.
Draco raised a shaky palm and rested it on Harry’s cheek. He ran his thumb absentmindedly across his dark skin.
The relief was short lived, because the sight of Harry was accompanied by the same tightness in his chest and a tortuous reminder that he was headed down a dangerous path.
Surely it meant nothing. Draco did his best to convince himself of this. But no matter how many times he shot down the idea, he wasn’t able to completely douse the flame of hope that burned inside him.
He’s facing away so his face can’t be seen but he’s standing with his arms folded and his feet apart. His posture makes his shoulders look broader and though Potter is a little bit shorter than him, in this moment he seems to almost tower over the long shadows that fall around him.
“You’re awfully knowledgeable about Muggle history,” Potter says, his surprise dripping off his words. Draco wonders for a minute whether he ought to be offended or not. He figures it’s warranted.
Nobody has been to Grimmauld Place in the past five months give or take. Harry hates visitors, Ron and Hermione go out frequently to meet other people. They never tell him but bringing over others to the mould infested, rotting dump of a house is going to be a dampener on any conversation one might be interested in having.
“Shit,” he whispers quietly, lips scratching against the soft pillowcase, dick twitching in his hand. He ruts gently against the bed, the cool cloth of his pyjamas keeping the friction heady and strong but not unbearable. His precome slicks the way and his movements are gutting rougher as he coasts the shore of his orgasm, the waves of it lapping at his nerves but not daring to spill.
Even the name is enough to draw a visceral reaction from Draco. He feels his jaw clench, his fingers tighten around the glass. Something rattles on the edge of the table and his whole being feels flayed open and raw.
“We’re in the middle. I haven’t been able to pass on because I had to wait for…” he hesitates, before saying, “for either one of you to die. Our bond was too strong to be severed in death.”
On his worst days, Harry finds himself wondering what would have happened if they’d maintained the ritual.
“You ignored me,” Harry says. “You won’t talk, you won’t look, you shirk away from me, find excuses to travel on your own. I understand hints Malf—Draco, and I don’t want to stay where someone doesn’t want me.”
This time Draco does open his eyes. Potter’s eyes are fixed on him, hardened and challenging, his lips set in an ugly line. “Yes,” he says.
“The first time I brought you here and that thing happened between you and Harry,  I got so mad at him.  I was fired up and angry because he barely spoke to us, kept himself locked up in his room with the curtains closed, drank continuously in the evenings, spoke awfully to me, barely spoke to Ron, stopped speaking to the Weasleys. He was angry and he would break things every time his anger spiked with accidental magic. He didn’t eat the meals we cooked, threw around the fact that it was his house and that day… that day it reached a tipping point.” She draws in a deep breath and lets it out slowly.
Keeping his eyes closed, he envisions himself as he used to be, grips his wand and casts the spell, “Mutare Facies!” When he can bring himself to examine his appearance again, he thinks he resembles himself. Or who he used to be before. His cheeks have filled out, his eyes have brightened, his lips look plumper. But even as he looks at the face of the boy he used to be, something seems wrong. Something seems different, as though there’s a piece missing. If he wasn’t himself, he would have noticed nothing out of the ordinary but having spent the better part of his childhood in front of a mirror, he knows his own face and something isn’t right. But there’s only so much to be done. He fixes his hair and the collar of his robes, casts the charm again just to be sure. Then he takes a swig of Calming Draught, repeats Malfoy men have dragon heartstrings to himself over and over till the words lose meaning, takes a deep, fortifying breath and walks over towards the Floo.
