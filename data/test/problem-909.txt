As he got closer he could see the little imperfections in the buildings; a shallow dent in the wall where death eaters had dueled a student into a corner, barely-visible cracks running up the towers and glass panes that sparkled just that little too brightly to fit in with the rest. It was clear that Hogwarts was wearing her battle scars with pride. Draco had heard stories from Luna about Hogwarts rejecting the help of the team who rebuilt the school after the war and slowly healing itself from the inside. She had insisted that Hogwarts had refused to allow the team to make her look perfect again, her magic actively working to sabotage their attempts to fix every little broken tile and cracked wall. Eventually the team had given up and had instead watched as Hogwarts restored itself from the inside and little plaques dedicated to those lost in the battle began popping up all over the grounds.
The picnic tables that usually littered the grass in front of the cabins had vanished, probably shrunk down and packed into the staff cabin, leaving only yellowed imprints behind in the grass. The games equipment that was normally stacked up against the cabins was gone, as if it had never been there at all. As if Draco hadn’t spent his mornings playing tennis with them for the past weeks. Even the cabins themselves lacked their usual warmth and brightness, the windows dull and lifeless and lacking the charm and beauty the children brought to them.
Hermione was going to kill him. He’d spent his morning reading Harry’s diary instead of catching up on work. He’d only meant to read a few entries, put it down, and then continue with his work. How was he meant to finish his work now, knowing that a sweet, good-looking man was attracted to him and was planning on asking him out within the week?
Harry Potter stood outside his door, surrounded by children who were peering eagerly into the house. He looked as shocked as Draco felt, his mouth hanging open and his eyes looking everywhere but Draco’s face. He settled on a spot on the doorframe to the left of Draco’s shoulder, as if not looking at him would make him disappear. Draco couldn’t blame him really; he wasn’t exactly overjoyed to see Potter again, even if the bastard had somehow become
“Tongue-tying curse, Potter,” Draco taunted, gathering the plants into a ball and flicking his wand, sending them flying into Potter’s open mouth. Potter spluttered, vanishing the stuff in his mouth and ducking to avoid the spells Draco continued to send his way. He summoned another handful of grass and transfigured them into spiders, sending them at Draco faster than he was able to shield himself. They latched onto his clothes, crawling all over him and finding their way under his collar, legs scratching against his bare skin. There was a pause as he banished as many spiders as he could see, glaring at Potter. Something seemed to pass between them, a silent agreement that this was no longer a little demonstration, but rather a duel between two old rivals with a score to settle.
“We have mutual friends,” he replied, taking a long swig of his drink. He wondered if he could escape to the toilets without her following him.
Draco thought briefly about rejecting the handshake, throwing Potter’s words from all those years ago back in his face, but discarded the idea almost immediately. The camp had welcomed him with open arms and there was an almost overwhelming sense of
He supposed he could just ask Hermione about him, but that wouldn’t sate his curiosity like reading a few more diary entries would. Besides, she had enough on her plate with a child on the way and an overbearing mother-in-law. She didn’t need him asking questions about her friends.
“I do enjoy Cluedo, though. Don’t you Martine?” Luna asked. Draco had lost track of the conversation at least ten minutes ago, when talk had turned to muggle toasters and something called Scrabble.
“Sorry for scaring you, but I just wanted to let you know that we close in ten minutes. We close at half one on Sundays.” She picked up his empty cup and walked away.
Luna nodded. “He teaches them how to duel safely so they can enjoy and defend themselves. He just wants the best for them, because he didn’t always have that growing up.”
Draco paused for a moment, his guilt slowly returning. The diary was clearly deeply personal to Harry and he was quite sure that he wouldn’t want a stranger reading his private thoughts, even if Harry was pining after said stranger.
He stopped at the bottom of the steps, torn between joy at the knowledge that Harry was seeking him out and a desire to get to Switzerland as fast as possible.
Resigned to the fact that he wasn’t going to be moving from this position for the rest of the evening unless he wanted to disturb Draco and deal with a very grumpy rabbit, Harry grabbed the book from his nightstand.
Draco groaned, banging his fist on the workbench in anger. He’d been working on this potion for 3 days, for an old lady up in Kent with chronic knee pain who was one of his regular customers. He’d yet to let her down in the years he’d been sending her potions and he didn’t want to start now. The potion would be ruined if he didn’t add the dragon’s blood exactly ten minutes after the horn. Whoever was at the door would just have to
Draco ignored the whispers and stares from the witches as he passed them and instead focused on trying to find the shop Harry was renovating.
“High praise, Longbottom,” Draco replied, barely able to stop his jaw hitting the floor in shock. “I doubt Potter would agree.”
Draco was pulled from his rather maudlin thoughts by several loud knocks on the front door and a delighted squeal from Ms. Gallagher. He was surprised to discover he was almost as excited as her to welcome the children into his house, even if he was doubtful about the muggle board games.
“I don’t like potions. They smell bad.” The girl said, wrinkling her nose. “But Granny says that you made the potion that fixed my Daddy so they can’t be too terrible.”
“I guess my feelings aren’t quite as one-sided as I thought.” Harry said, leaning forward to kiss his forehead, smiling when Draco lifted his head up and licked his chin in return.
Draco sighed, folding the little note back up and sending the little Elf owl on its way with a pat on the head and a treat. He should have closed the door in Potter’s face as soon as he realised who it was, Merlin knows the man only brought him trouble.
Someone tapped Draco’s shoulder. Startled, he dropped the book and turned to face the person who’d interrupted him.
Draco carried the letter from Harry around in his pocket for two weeks before he worked up the courage to visit him in Diagon Alley.
just there to see Harry. Luna was going to be there, and so was Blaise. He was going because it was a chance to catch up with some of his old classmates, he told himself, not to see if Harry looked as good in dress robes now as he had in fourth-year.
He hoped someone had handed it in. It just wouldn’t feel right if he had to buy a new notebook to write in, plus all of his favourite pictures were stuck inside it and he’d be devastated if he couldn’t get them back.
“There better be a bloody good reason for you knocking on my door, I’ve just ruined a potion thanks to you,” Draco said as he yanked open the door, pausing as he realised who was stood on his doorstep.
Ron had called him shortly after he’d sat down to tell him that Hermione was in labour and that they’d just arrived at the hospital. In his rush to leave, he must have forgotten about the diary.
Draco stood, barely able to see through the tears forming in his eyes. He slammed down several galleons onto the bar before hurrying out of the room, feeling as if Harry had just ground his heart into a million tiny pieces under the heel of his expensive polished shoes.
Draco shifted, his furry little nose twitching, and sat up. He kicked his front paws out like a tiny, fluffy boxer and started cleaning his face, pulling his ears down to lick them. Over the last two weeks Harry had learnt that a rabbit cleaning itself was the cutest thing on Earth. Watching Draco lick his adorable little paws and wash his face warmed Harry’s heart, and reminded him that there was still a piece of Draco inside the bunny Harry had been caring for. Even as a rabbit, Draco couldn’t bear to look anything less than perfect.
“Nonsense! Harry and Hermione have told me how brilliant you are at potions, I’m sure plenty of the work is down to your intelligence.”
Draco usually spent most of the evening asleep on Harry’s chest, just above his heart, while Harry read through his notes and textbooks. His weight was warm and comforting and it had quickly become Harry’s favourite part of the day, but he was beginning to miss human-Draco. He missed their conversations and playful bickering. He missed having breakfast with Draco in the kitchens in the early hours of the morning before they snuck off to the quidditch pitch. Harry hadn’t realised just how much Draco had come to mean to him until now.
“I’m not looking for an apology, you’re a busy man. Stop looking sorry for yourself and pick up a paint brush.”
It was quiet, given that it was early morning and most people were at work or in school. A group of older witches were huddled around a table outside of Fortescue’s and a man with two small children was chatting to the owner of Flourish and Blotts, but otherwise the street was empty.
nonsense now, it’s Minerva to you.” She gestured inside, where Draco could already see the press swarming towards the door like seagulls honing in on a discarded chippy carton. “Harry’s in there somewhere. Hasn’t stopped talking about you all day, the silly goose.” There was a knowing glint in her eyes and Draco did his best to stomp down the hope that bubbled in his chest at her words.
“Draco!” Harry shouted, jogging the last few feet up the hill to meet him. He glanced down at the bag in Draco’s hand, his smile dropping slightly. “Where are you going?”
“That woman you were dancing with. I know it’s ridiculous and that you don’t have any sort of feelings for me-” Harry cut him off by shoving him.
The street was packed and the snow was growing heavier and Draco prayed that it would be too busy for Harry to notice him if he was at the dueling centre.
Harry was resting against the wall next to him, lazily kicking his feet under the water as he supervised the children. He was telling Draco something about lunch arrangements, head tilted towards Draco’s face, leaving their lips just inches apart. Draco was far too focused on the little water droplets sliding down his toned chest to pay attention to anything Harry was saying. He wondered what it would be like to trace the path of the droplets up Harry’s chest, mapping out each dip and curve of his body with his tongue and hands and listening to Harry cry out in pleasure...
Two games later, when the rain was no longer hammering against the windows and some of the younger students were dozing against their friends, Draco shared a triumphant high-five with Luna as he won his first game. He’d enjoyed this night far more than he thought possible and he was starting to think that maybe children weren’t so obnoxious after all.
He supposed he could say no and come up with a suitable excuse to avoid spending another afternoon staring at Potter and doing his best to answer the million questions the children always seemed to have. The memory of Luna’s disappointed eyes and fading grin when he tried to refuse yesterday was enough to convince him that maybe lunch wouldn’t be too bad.
“You really have changed,” Harry said softly, staring at Draco as if he was seeing him in a whole new light. “The old you would never have lifted a finger to help a werewolf, let alone work without the promise of some sort of reward or recognition.”
Granger made a noise of agreement around a mouthful of cake. “You’ve changed since we were at school,” she said, swallowing and reaching for a sandwich. “I think you’re starting to win over some of the adults too.”
How could he have ever thought that Harry returned his feelings? How could he have allowed himself to get his hopes up? And really, how could a washed out, reclusive potions master compare to the perfect woman Harry was wrapped around?
It was a book about caring for rabbits Hermione had given to him after Draco’s accident. He’d read the first and most important pages about diet and exercise straight away to make sure he was looking after Draco correctly, but he’d not looked at it since. He opened it up at the next chapter.
Harry pulled a face. “I don’t think I’d last very long in the Ministry. Too many slimy politicians wandering about with punchable faces. Besides, the idea of fighting criminals and being expected to save the WIzarding World for the rest of my life wasn’t too appealing and I’ve always liked children.” He laughed and elbowed Draco playfully in the side, in a display of casual familiarity that made Draco’s heart ache. He wouldn’t get to experience this for much longer - he didn’t think maintaining a friendship with an ex-Death Eater outside of this camp would be high on Harry’s list of priorities, especially with a new business. “I never thought that you’d spend your spare time making joint potions for old ladies and mucking about with nosy teenagers.”
“I think you’d enjoy it,” Luna said with a smile. “It’s a muggle board game. We normally play them on Thursday nights on the tables outside, but I suppose it’s a bit too damp for that now, and drying charms don’t seem to like wet grass very much. Must be all the nargles.”
“I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to meet you too,” Draco said, sweeping away the last of the dust from the carpet and pushing the table against the wall with a wave of his wand. He never used this room - the seemingly never-ending oak table reminded him too much of the death eater meetings at the Manor and he couldn’t eat there without remembering the stench of blood and burnt flesh - but maybe the children could inject some life into the room. He’d much rather remember laughter than screams.
“Oh, but there’s more to it than that, isn’t there?” she said with a sickly smile, gently dragging her nails down his forearm in what he assumed was meant to be a seductive manner. He felt rather ill. “I want the
The fool hadn’t left an address and Draco had been too anxious about making the trip to think about trivial things like where he was actually meant to meet Harry.
“That’s my book,” Months of watching him from across the cafe and that’s the best he could come up with? God, it was a miracle that he’d ever kissed anyone.
now upon Luna’s request - was walking around, bare chest glistening with seawater and miles upon miles of lickable golden skin on display, and generally looking like a wet dream.
He visited the hospital in Switzerland as often as possible, throwing himself into finding a working potion to distract him from anything related to Harry
The further he flicked through, the guiltier Draco felt. The diary was clearly full of deeply personal memories and definitely not something Harry would want a complete stranger reading through, even if it was just to find a way to contact him and return the book. He flipped to the last entry, deciding to just hand the diary over to one of the staff to return to Harry when he came back in for it, despite his growing curiosity about the man who’d written the diary.
“Impatient arsehole,” Draco muttered, wiping down the worktop and levitating the vials of ingredients back to their proper places. Refilling them was a job for tomorrow he decided.
“I have plenty of space,” Draco said, much to his own surprise. Luna’s eyes lit up and, as she hurried over to confer with the Gryffindors, Draco was left with the distinct impression that he had been manipulated.
“I’m opening a duelling centre in October,” Harry said, waving as the last of the children disappeared into the cabins for the night. There were less than 2 weeks left before Hogwarts opened again for the school year and the camp was closed up until next summer.
After nearly crying in relief when he got the last croissant, he found a table by the window and set his books down, wishing more than ever that Hermione was there to pester him into studying. Catching up on his missed work was even more daunting when he had to do it alone. Steeling himself for an exceptionally boring morning reading about enzymes, he sat down, jumping in surprise when his foot touched something solid under the table.
He hadn’t set foot there since the end of the war, when he’d had to help rebuild the shops that had been destroyed as part of his sentence. He didn’t enjoy the stares and whispers that had a tendency to follow him out in public, so staying - he refused to call it
“The aim is to disarm, not harm, without simply using Expelliarmus. We will use the tickling spell, the leg-locker curse, the body-bind spell, and the jelly legs curse, because they’re the spells we focused on in our session on Tuesday. You can use other spells, but nothing above fourth-year ability, and nothing physical.” Potter said, using what Draco could only describe as his ‘teacher voice’. The children fell silent, hanging onto Potter’s every word and Draco was silently impressed. “We won’t use shield charms either. I want them to see the effects of the spells we’ve been working on.”
“These two need hot chocolate and biscuits to distract them, they don’t enjoy shopping very much.” Judging by the weary look on Harry’s face, he didn’t either.
Draco’s guilt vanished very suddenly when he found that the most recent entry in the book, dated several days ago, started with his name.
Draco had assumed that lunch meant that he’d be shoved onto a picnic bench outside the children’s cabins as usual, but Luna had greeted him with an enthusiastic kiss to the cheek and shoved a picnic basket into his hands. Apparently, Wednesday was picnic day. They had trekked through the grounds of Draco’s home, the walk narrated by Luna describing the unusual properties of certain plants, until they came to a field north of his house that he’d never even seen before.
Harry’s eyes widened. “That’s what Lavender and Bill used, isn’t it?” He asked. “That’s the potion Padma talked about, the one that controlled her urges around the full moon.”
“Never thought I’d see you play Muggle board games,” he mused, offering Draco a cautious smile. “You’ve changed.”
There was rustling on the bed next to him then a little nose pressed against his arm, reminding him why these past few weeks had been particularly bad. He lifted his arm up and a small, fluffy grey rabbit hopped onto his stomach. The rabbit snuggled down onto his chest, tucking his paws underneath his body and making a content clicking noise with his teeth. Harry smiled and gently scratched between his ears.
He was looking down at Teddy with a soft, affectionate smile that told Draco volumes about how much he loved the boy. He didn’t even need the diary to tell him how sweet Harry was when he had that picture.
Teddy picked out a reindeer shaped biscuit that was bigger than Draco’s hand and the girl - Victoire, he learnt - settled for one that had been decorated as a Christmas tree.
“Mr Malfoy!” Professor McGonagall called from the door to the Great Hall, beckoning him over. “What a pleasant surprise!”
without the children.” Harry smirked, taking advantage of the fact that Teddy and Victoire were too distracted by the falling snowflakes to kiss Draco again, his cold fingers sliding across Draco’s jaw and a hand resting on his hip. Draco found himself running his hand through Harry’s unruly hair, silently marvelling at its softness and tugging slightly to bring Harry impossibly closer.
Her smile grew impossibly larger and she clapped her hands together in excitement. “We’re heading off to the beach! You should come with us, the kids are just
He was almost unbearably endearing as he spent the day mucking about with the children, pretending to duel with them using bits of driftwood they’d found in the sand. Draco could hardly function while Harry’s face was lit up like that as he laughed with two of the younger students, splashing and shouting for Draco to join them. Merlin, he could listen to Harry saying his name all day long.
“I’ll be back, Harry. Surely it could wait?” He apparated away without waiting for a reply and told himself he was imagining the disappointment on Harry’s face.
”I suppose we are quite busy,” Harry said, “We’re fully booked until March.” He sounded exhausted and Draco felt like telling him to go home and sleep and let Draco look after the kids.
“I’ve been waiting to do this since you left for Switzerland,” Harry said breathlessly as they reluctantly pulled apart, Harry’s thumb rubbing slow circles against Draco’s cheek. “We could have saved a lot of heartache if you’d just given me a few moments to explain myself before you left.”
when he was surrounded by the children. He wasn’t foolish enough to throw such an opportunity away and he shook Potter’s hand, cherishing the warmth of his palm against Draco’s own.
and it was itchy and just plain annoying, but Draco had a feeling that a trip to the beach would be a free pass to ogle at a semi-naked Harry Potter, and well, he’d be a fool to pass up such a delightful opportunity.
painted and Draco poked at the skirting board with his brush - telling him all about everything from the classes he was going to offer, to the extension charms he was using on the building, to potatoes he’d eaten at the Weasley house when he got back from the camp.
“Inconsiderate bastard,” Draco muttered, rubbing his side as he walked up to the counter. He’d have a spectacular bruise there by the time he got home.
As much as Draco knew it would hurt, he could still try to be friends with Harry if he rejected him, he decided, willing himself to believe it.
“I should have owled.” He felt awful; he’d been far too caught up wallowing in self-pity and agonising over his stupid crush to think about how Harry felt. “I’m sorry.”
It had been raining on and off since lunchtime, and all Draco wanted was to curl up in front of the fireplace with a good book and some chocolate. The grass outside of the cabins was like a bog and he had splashes of mud up his jeans that reached his knees. He was cold and muddy and tired and the children were
Padma won the first game, something that didn’t appear to come as a surprise to the rest of the group, who grumbled quietly for a few moments before starting over again.
Draco chuckled and took Harry’s hand in his own, giving it a gentle squeeze. “We can’t change the past.”
What part of ‘I want you there’ didn’t you understand?” He was laughing now and Draco could feel himself blushing.
On Halloween, a photograph had been stuck into the book. A very beautiful woman with long red hair and bright green eyes sat at a kitchen table, watching the man next to her as he lifted up a small child to a pumpkin on the table. The man’s face was partially hidden behind the child, but they had matching messy dark hair and Draco guessed that these people were Harry’s parents.
Draco ignored the flutter of hope in his chest and took a tentative nibble of the cupcake. It was rather enjoyable, to his surprise, and tasted like cherries.
“Oh, I haven’t spoken to a bairn in so long!” She gushed, her eyes darting excitedly between Draco and the door to the dining room. “I remember when mine were small, all grubby hands and big appetites.”
“I was beginning to think you weren’t going to come,” Harry said, sounding hurt. He wiped his hands on his jeans and opened the door for Draco to enter the building. “You thanked Luna for leaving a note behind, but I didn’t hear anything from you.”
“I suppose we can’t,” Harry said with a smile, returning the squeeze and pulling Draco along the street to join in with the snowball fight.
“So how are we doing this, Potter?” He asked, adjusting his grip on his wand. Potter seemed equally nervous and Draco wondered if he was recalling the catastrophe that was their duel in second year too. “No setting snakes on the students this time, I suppose?”
They were huddled inside the largest of the cabins, the fireplaces lit and extension charms covering the walls to fit everyone inside until the rain died down. Draco was squashed between Martine - a first-year who seemed to have become rather attached to him - and Luna. He was beginning to wonder if it was considered bad manners to disapparate in the middle of a conversation.
“And what does this board game involve?” The only board games wizards had were chess and a strange version of drafts played with miniature quaffles and snitches - this ‘Cluedo’ sounded rather interesting.
Draco reached down and picked a battered notebook off the floor. It was a bright red spiral notebook, with bits of paper and several photographs sticking out the pages. It was clear that the book was old and well-loved; the colour on the cover had started to fade and small chunks of the front cover were peeling off. He pushed the stuff that was sticking out back in and opened it, hoping the owner had written their name and perhaps their phone number so he could return it to them.
He was saved from wandering the streets aimlessly by a very welcome voice shouting his name. Harry was leaning casually against the doorway, paint splattering his jeans and dust covering his hair. Draco had never wanted to kiss him more.
“I suppose.” Potter sighed, relenting almost instantly. Even the Savior of the Wizarding World couldn’t stand up to Luna’s stare. It took Draco a while to get used to the rules, what with all the cards and little pieces, but he found himself enjoying the game immensely. It was rather thrilling, trying to figure out who the criminal was and waiting on tenterhooks to see if someone had guessed right. Muggles were so much better than Wizards at this board game stuff, he thought.
Draco settled down on Harry’s chest again and closed his eyes, clicking his teeth contentedly as Harry scratched between his ears.
as Luna enjoyed pointing out - were inside the main cabin, where they slept, but Harry had decided to stay outside and watch the sun go down with Draco before they parted ways for the night.
It went downhill from there. Their spells became more advanced, more serious - horn-growing hexes, conjunctivitis curses and knock-back jinxes - and Draco could no longer keep track of the spells they were using, too distracted by his growing excitement.
“You’re a healer?” There was a note of surprise in his voice, but he seemed impressed rather than condescending. “I was interested in healing once, but I don’t think I’d be able to deal with losing patients.”
Now though, looking down at Draco curled up on his chest, with no idea when he’d be able to have a proper conversation with him again, he wished he hadn’t been so afraid to tell him how he felt.
Now though, more than two months after the ‘incident’ at the party, Draco had no choice but to enter Diagon Alley, where he was bound to run into Harry or, at the very least, a Weasley.
About two weeks ago, Draco had a run in with a group of fifth years working on a transfiguration project in the library. They were attempting to turn shoelaces into rabbits and guinea pigs with little success, when one of them thought it would be amusing to try the same spell on Draco. One poorly pronounced incantation later and Harry’s roommate was much smaller and much furrier.
The sudden lack of animosity between them was doing nothing to help Draco’s situation. Harry insisted on sitting next to Draco as he read under the shade of one of Luna’s umbrellas, asking Draco questions about his book and humming quietly under his breath as they sat in peaceful silence. It wasn’t quite perfect - they had yet to talk about anything more serious than a child with a sore throat and had been avoiding any mention of the war, but Draco was happy to pretend that everything was right in the world if it meant Harry sitting so close to him.
He opened the pad only to have his mind suddenly blank, no ideas on what to draw, or where to even begin to sketch. And before he could stop himself, he thought of his father.
"Ah yes, like the time Tom Riddle saved those puppies from a burning building. Very heroic." Harry said sarcastically. Draco's heart jumped a little. Oh lord, no.
Harry Potter was straight, but he wasn't going to let it make him stop being his friend. He was going to help him though this year.
"The only thing I want to know it who was the bloke who decided mixing dragon dung and pixie teeth into a cauldron of boiling hedgehog spit was a good idea." Ron interjected, dropping the subject of Malfoy. "They must have been mental."
They way they caught even the tiniest bit of light, and shone in the darkest of places, took Draco back. Sure Harry's eyes always stood out, and Draco often found himself admiring them. But he had never seen them in the dark.
"But later in the year is fine?" Harry ask jokingly. He pulled out the Map and grabbed the Cloak, just in case.
So he went to the spot where he could meet Draco. His heart plummeted when he didn't be the other boy. He knew he'd be out eventually. He knew all he had to do was wait. So he laid by the fire, as if it was a normal day. As if he wasn't suffering. As if Draco were there to reassure him he wasn't alone.
"Sorry, I must be boring you." Draco said suddenly coming to his halt of the explanation of how a dragon had started to massacre a town on a lake.
Harry walked slightly behind Ron ad Hermione, and he silently went through the names of all that had passed, either the day of the Battle of Hogwarts, or before. It was a long list, and he was saying names until he fell asleep in a new dorm, which happened to be the Room of Requirements. Unlike when DA met here, it had been turned into a dorm, girls rooms on the left, and boys on the right, with a common room in the middle. Within each side, they were separated by house. One large room for each, with the perfect amount of beds that each needed.
Dinner came around and Harry found himself looking at Draco more and more. He didn't want to wait for the morning to be himself. He wanted to feel relaxed now. Needed to feel relaxed. For some reason, a desperate feeling rose in his chest. What if his smile broke? What if it became too much for him? What if he needed that calm before the morning?
"Why? Do you like when I say your name? Is it like when I call you the Golden Boy?" Draco teased lifting an eyebrow, Harry grew red again.
And they sat there, Draco and the person he didn't know, for what felt like hours. They sat in peace. A calm Draco hadn't felt in a while.
"July 31, but you could just ask any Gryffindor." Draco rolled his eyes. "Look, just because I know a lot about him doesn't mean I like him." He had reasons to know all these things.
"She wouldn't stoop so low as to be with a blonde." He retorted and got up. They spoke no more, and Draco left before Blaise, only to run into Pansy.
Then he felt the real world pull to him. He didn't want to leave, but the pull was persistent but soft, so he allowed himself to be dragged from his happy place. When he associated with the world, he noticed the faint sent of vanilla had stayed with him. Harry felt a small pressure on his left hand. He removed his forearm from his eyes and looked around, until his eyes rested on Draco's silent frame. He really was beautiful. Draco's eyes studied him for a second, and then looked at the fire.
“I guess if it comes down to it I do trust him,” Draco said, bringing Harry back to their interrupted conversation. “I just didn’t expect that you would, given your history and all that.”
Only when Ernie Macmillan asked about Felix Felicis did Harry’s interest in the lesson return. The golden potion took six months to brew, which made it one of the few they had not actually practiced at Grimmauld Place. Perhaps Slughorn wasn’t as useless as Severus had implied if he could brew Felix Felicis.
Forcing himself to leave the little bubble Draco and him had created in the Room of Requirement in order to go to breakfast the next morning was probably Harry’s least favourite thing he’d ever done. And he’d bloody well fought Voldemort. Repeatedly.
“Nothing important, at least,” Harry amended, then sighed when Dumbledore’s eyebrow twitched the tiniest bit upwards and added, “It’s a bit bothersome to get around with everyone staring at me and whispering behind raised hands as if I was blind and deaf to their gossip. But otherwise everything is just fine.”
Did Harry go off on a tangent about historical figures from the four houses in the middle there? Yes, yes he did. Why? Because I got distracted while writing as Harry and if that isn’t ADHD in its purest form idk what is, so I left it in even though it’s
Draco watched Potter disappear into the drawing room. Again. He wondered what could possibly be so interesting about it for Potter to repeatedly spend hours on end in there. Not that he cared what Potter was doing, he simply wanted to know what kind of house he lived in. Although his mother had assured him that he’d visited the place as a child, he couldn’t remember a thing about it. He honestly didn’t remember much of his childhood in general. Just bland template memories of the Manor, silent dinners and occasional playdates with Greg and Vince.
Straightening a little, Theo stuck out his chin defiantly and responded, “Then he’s as much of a fool as you are if you don’t even consider the potential benefit of joining Potter’s little club.” Both Pansy and Millicent gasped. “My father may consider him inferior as a half-blood, but anyone with a brain can see that he knows what he’s doing when it comes to defence.”
Their wands buzzed in unison, making Draco jump a little. After quickly checking the instructions and stirring the potion, they lapsed back into silence. It took four more rounds of stirring and waiting before the potion was ready for the final ingredient according to Severus’ parchment. Harry watched mildly anxious as Draco poured the myrrh into the cauldron, causing the potion to emit a hissing sound and give off faint blue smoke. After stirring the precise number of times indicated by the instructions, Draco turned the burner off and decanted the finished potion.
Ron kept grumbling right up to the moment when the door to the Potions classroom opened and Slughorn waltzed out, standing at the door as they all filed inside and greeting Harry with annoyingly exaggerated enthusiasm. The classroom was already foggy with steam and Harry saw several cauldrons with finished potions standing on their desks. He recognised them all; Polyjuice, Amortentia, Felix Felicis, and Veritaserum. Severus had taught Draco and him how to brew all of them perfectly.
Though the boy did look remarkably like Black, now that he gave Potter’s new face a closer look, he mostly saw Lily. Lily’s nose, Lily’s lips. Potter’s hair was even darker now than it had been before, but marginally less messy. His cheekbones were slightly more pronounced, his jaw a little stronger. He looked less boyish, more like a man. He was still recognisable, but barely, as if he’d gone through another round of puberty within a single night. He also looked extremely pale; likely the result of the ordeal he’d just been through.
To Draco’s surprise, Theo disagreed. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Don’t you remember how big that club was last year already? Rumour has it Potter taught
Harry chuckled and Draco felt the vibration of the sound through his entire body, spreading like the heat from glowing coals, warming him.
Harry couldn’t remember to ever have been happier than he was now, standing in his kitchen with his tear-streaked face buried in Severus’ shoulder.
“And what good would the Dark Lord’s trust do me if the Order believed me a traitor?” Severus argued, containing his anger as well as he could. “Judging from your reaction, you meant to keep this a secret, or am I wrong?”
Severus closed his eyes and shuddered as memories flooded his senses. His nerve-endings were tingling, a hollow echo of the Cruciatus he’d endured. He steeled himself to relive it all, but before he could even take a breath, Narcissa spoke up.
Harry pushed himself up and reached out to cup Draco’s face. He understood the fear, he was worried about their reaction too, but contrary to Draco he trusted them enough to know they would probably come around. And if not—
He cleared his throat and continued, “I think I’ll go take a walk through the train. I’ll see you later.”
It was Draco’s turn to stare incredulously. “No offence, Sev, but you’re not the most polished person. Do you ever actually wash your hair?”
“Harry, that’s—” He looked up at the youth in front of him. Yes, Harry seemed overjoyed, like James’ acceptance had melted away the lingering insecurity whether he would’ve been loved as Severus Snape’s son. Harry had gotten an answer now, literally in ink on parchment.
For some reason, Remus, Narcissa and Draco all turned to Harry, looking at him expectantly. Harry gave a small sigh, then launched into a retelling of the events of the previous day.
“Good,” Harry said, smiling. “Do you mind if I summon a book to read a little? With all the cleaning out I haven’t really had the time.”
Harry’s jaw was visibly clenched, but he didn’t argue back any further. Severus turned on the spot and levelled a nasty glare at the rest of the class which was still gaping at them, utterly transfixed.
Harry tried to fight the tears welling up in his eyes, but it was pointless. He felt like every feeling of loneliness, pain and abandonment was being wrenched out of his chest, until it was all drained from him, until there was none of the cold left, but plenty of space for warmth. Narcissa gave his shoulder a comforting squeeze, as Remus tightened his arms around him even further. He could feel Draco at his side, rubbing soothing circles on his back as he cried.
Whatever calm admission that, yes, he had changed, had been on Harry’s tongue died away and was replaced by venomous rage. His eyes flashed dangerously.
“How do you know?” Harry asked. “And how did you know what to do? It’s never been over that quickly before.”
“I guess I could’ve found out about Severus being my father much earlier, if I’d just forgotten my Gringotts key, because it said his name right there on that scroll. Wait—”
“I’ll take them,” he told the seamstress, who beamed at him. They probably had just made most of today’s revenue with their visit. Draco sent a silent thank you to Sirius Black and James Potter for making Harry their heir, effectively securing his financial stability a thousand times over.
Without breaking their kiss, Remus walked Severus backwards until they hit the wall, pinning the slightly shorter man against it. Severus’ hands travelled up his back and tangled in his hair as they continued to explore each other’s mouths until suddenly, Severus
Phew, that one took a while to write! Mostly because I had the second part with the vow written much much earlier than the rest of the chapter. It was originally just a random idea I had for a scene and I thought I wouldn’t actually include it in the fic. But after writing it I kinda liked it, so I worked to set it up and eventually arrived at this chapter where I could finally include it.
“Oh.” Harry felt a slight twinge of guilt about never helping Narcissa with cooking, he’d assumed that the house-elf did most of the work. “Uhm, yeah, I guess if they stayed here with us and promised not to tell anyone anything about this place or the Order, it would be alright. Would they be able to get through the Fidelius charm?”
Draco was at his side in a heartbeat, pulling a weak Harry into his arms. He could feel him melt against him, tension draining out of his skinny body, as he rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. For a while neither of them said anything as they knelt on the dusty floor, tightly entangled. Harry’s racing heart and heavy breathing slowly calmed down.
“They’re all just cowards. Putting all the responsibility on one person to have an excuse to look away and hide, staying safe with their families. Convenient, to task an orphan, someone with no family of his own to protect. Except I
1. Sev’s reaction to Harry’s inheritances, because back when Harry found out about that they were very much not talking about personal things.
Kreacher bowed again before he disappeared. It didn’t take him long to bring the books Harry had requested, and Harry dismissed him again. He was happier around Narcissa, and Harry was content to let her be the main person to interact with the elf. It suited everyone best.
“Frankly, I’m fairly sure Draco was your only chance at getting Harry to leave,” Remus commented. “He’s usually rather adamant about wanting to hear such things for himself.”
They climbed into bed and, after Harry extinguished the lamps, snuggled into each other, Harry using Draco as his pillow this time around. For a few breaths they lay silently and Draco relaxed into Harry’s warmth curled around him.
He summoned the second box from the shelf, opened it swiftly, and showed it to Harry. Inside was a silver bracelet; metal woven like rope, a solid piece of silver with intricate carvings encasing the middle, and a smaller tube of silver hiding the clasp on the other side of it. It was a perfect match for the one he’d given to Harry, the only difference between them being that the pattern was mirrored, and Harry’s was pale gold instead of silver. Harry watched him wide-eyed as he took the silver one out of its box and fastened it around his own wrist.
I'm posting this chapter a bit early - or, actually, a lot early. Since exams are over and I'm off meds I haven't been writing in days but I didn't want to make you wait longer than 2 weeks, so I'm breaking my 12-chapters-ahead rule and hope to catch up over Christmas break.
“You…and Sirius?” Harry caught himself, getting over his initial surprise quickly. “I thought you two were just friends? How did I never notice any of that in the last two years?”
With a sigh, he put the last letter he’d been reading onto the pile next to the box, where he’d put all the letters he’d already read. There were so many.
He trailed off, unsure what he even wanted to ask. His expression must’ve been comical, for both Remus and Narcissa began to laugh and it took them a few moments to calm down again.
“Of course he does,” replied Harry, pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple as the Slytherin settled down next to him, Harry’s arm slung around his shoulders. Addressing Draco he added, “Why’d you come upstairs?”
They rounded the corner and Weasley broke off, eyes widening comically as he took in the sight before him. Draco’s mother, poised as ever, her pale blue dress and light hair contrasting with the dark sofa and making her shine like a beacon. Next to her Draco who stood out just as much, even though his outfit was much darker—he may or may not have picked it deliberately to blend into the room somewhat. On the couch diagonally across the long oval coffee table, Severus sat next to Remus, wearing his usual black robes and keeping his face completely neutral. Draco knew his own face was similarly blank, his pure-blood mask firmly in place.
Severus hadn’t been to Spinner’s End for quite some time. It felt odd to be back; like stepping into the past. The living room seemed to be untouched by time besides a layer of dust covering the worn furniture.
Harry tried, he really did, but his mind would simply not quiet down. Luckily, he somehow managed to suppress any thoughts of Sirius or his father—no, not his father,
“Albus, I think it’s time for explanations,” Minerva interjected. “We’re all here, now that Severus has arrived.”
“Like using the Unforgivables on whomever You-Know-Who wants controlled, tortured or killed. Like doing the things a Death Eater is supposed to do.”
“Oh my! I could barely recognise you, Harry, whatever happened to your— hair?” To her credit, her hesitation was almost dismissible with how short it was.
Draco suppressed a grin as he remembered his own mother’s reaction. Of course she had known, even though Draco hadn’t told anyone, not even Pansy—at least not explicitly. Pansy was bound to know, though, after how their brief experimental bout at the Yule Ball had gone.
She summoned four cups of tea and set the kettle boiling with a flick of her wand before turning to Severus.
Narcissa shifted, and Severus looked over to see her arching an eyebrow, her eyes going back and forth between him and Remus. He quickly snatched his hand back. It wouldn’t do for her to get a wrong impression.
Severus replied, “She’s been arrested, actually, for the mistreatment of students, abuse of a position of power, and use of an Unforgivable Curse on Miss Edgecombe.”
They had certainly made quite a jump from their previous hesitancy. Oddly enough, it didn’t feel like they had moved too fast, though. No, Harry was more than happy with last night’s events, it was certainly a birthday he’d never forget. The day had been full of successes overall, now that he thought about it again.
“I used to wait until midnight the night before my birthday to make a wish, because that’s when I was by myself, away from the Dursleys. I told Ron about it once and ever since then people usually sent my birthday presents to arrive around midnight, so the Dursleys wouldn’t notice. It’s turned into somewhat of a tradition, though I guess this year there won’t be anything since everyone is coming here tomorrow.”
Draco’s bracelet pulsed against his wrist. He stopped dead in his tracks. Another pulse. A smile spread on his face and he tapped the silver chain to send a pulse in return. His carefully suppressed impatience surged through him all at once, and when he resumed his pacing his steps were far brisker than before.
, but the scars. The scars are fucking disgusting.” He shot Draco an apologetic look. “And I feel bad because you had to see that, but I know it was inevitable. Now that you know you can just…avoid them, I guess. I’m sorry.”
Draco had met the Dark Lord before. He’d visited the Manor several times during the last year, twice during the holidays when Draco had been home.
“You have every right to be angry at me for that, to hate me for it, but please don’t make me leave. Ever since I learnt what conclusion the Dark Lord had come to upon hearing that prophecy, I’ve been trying to make up for my mistake of telling him. I swore an oath to Albus to spy and fight for the Order, to do anything it takes to take the Dark Lord down, and I’ve made good on that promise so far. I intend to keep doing so.” A bitter laugh escaped him. “After all these years, I don’t think there’s anything left that would beat the horrible things I’ve already done. I don’t have any reason to refuse anything that Albus asks of me.”
reason—why he’d avoided to let things go any further between them. The fear of Draco’s reaction, of him being disgusted by Harry, of him changing his mind about them because of it. Now that Draco knew, now that he had seen, Harry’s desire to
Harry pricked his finger with his wand and pressed it to the document, next to his scrawly signature. The scroll glowed for a moment, then the words began to morph.
For a moment, Draco visibly struggled with himself, then he gave a resigned sigh and nodded. “Alright, fine. Let me at least do the ones around them, then.”
Draco smiled as he set up a cauldron and began to gather the ingredients he needed from the shelves. “I accept your apology, thank you,” he said primly.
Draco nodded his agreement. He would indeed like to know more about Harry’s past, although he wasn’t entirely sure how he was supposed to breach the subject. Perhaps an opportunity would eventually arise.
Please note that uploads won't be as frequent as they used to be for part 1, but chapters are generally longer in turn. I'm not as far ahead as I wanted to be, but at some point I gotta start posting again to avoid just wallowing in a writing block.
“Of course, but as you are surely aware, Voldemort is not entirely sane these days. He has episodes of madness and I believe it reasonable to assume that his defences are at least weakened, if not non-existent during these episodes.” He fixed his eyes on Harry over the golden rim of his glasses. “I am sure you understand how valuable such insight into Voldemort’s mind and plans could be.”
“I am just trying to understand, Severus. Why would you suddenly refuse to talk to him? He’s your son!” Narcissa argued.
“Fine, I don’t think they’ll outright kill each other, although the possibility that Ron and Draco end up duelling
Severus pretended to check Draco’s grades, then pulled out a blank timetable and tapped it with his wand, making Draco’s classes appear on it. Draco took it with a nod and scanned over it. First-period was Ancient Runes.
I am changing plenty, but I do not want to change random things that wouldn’t logically be different based on what’s different in this AU. So Harry meeting Luna and Neville and the things they say/talk about is not something that is suddenly unlikely, therefore it’s still going to happen as it does in canon.
“Yes, well, I might have been thinking about it for a bit longer already. Even if we were able to make our relationship public, you’d still be in the dungeons and I’d be in Gryffindor tower. I wanted a way to talk to you, even when we can’t see each other. They only arrived a couple days ago though, so the timing was quite impeccable actually.”
If only he knew how right he was. There were quite a few serious conversations the two of them would have to have eventually, quite a few apologies to be made and history to be sorted out. But now was not the time for that, so Draco didn’t respond, opting for round twenty five—or something around that, Draco had lost track—of snogging instead.
“My gran is ecstatic that we’re friends,” said Neville. “You should hear how she talks about you, I’d almost call her a fan.“
“What do you want, darling?” Harry’s breath was hot on Draco’s skin as he spoke. “You have to tell me.”
“Can I talk to you for a minute?” It came out rushed and Harry’s heart was going wild in his chest again. Severus was already on his feet, facing the door.
With a groan, he threw himself onto the bed, burying his face in the cushions. There was no way he‘d ever let anyone see him ever again. Especially not
In that moment, Harry stepped out of the fitting room again, clad in simple, but perfectly fitted, black robes. Draco had to suppress a gasp. This just wasn’t fair, not in the slightest. Harry looked positively edible, and Draco suddenly doubted whether this had been a good idea. If Harry walked around like that, Draco would have a mountain of competition in no time. He looked up at Harry’s face, and the shy smile playing around his lips eradicated any such thoughts immediately. How could he ever keep anything from Harry if it’d get him a smile like that? He beamed at Harry.
“You mean more successful than earning myself detention on purpose?” Harry sighed. “Let me guess: Slughorn was swooning over my so-called talent for Potions.”
There was another brief silence as Narcissa seemed to think his words over. “How would I join this Order?” she asked eventually, and Remus smiled broadly at her.
“We will bring Harry to Grimmauld Place,” Albus announced. “Since Sirius made Harry his heir, the house should now recognise him as Lord Black, Head of House Black—even though he’ll eventually have to go and officially claim his inheritance at Gringotts. We will place a new Fidelius charm over the house to ensure that the protection is intact. Harry should be safe and hidden there. It is technically his home now, after all. The Black family magic will only add to his protection.”
Draco took one of Harry’s hands and pressed it to his chest. Suddenly, it was easy to match his own breathing to Draco’s, as he felt Draco’s heart beat under his fingers. Slowly, the world became clearer again, and Harry recognised Grimmauld Place.
“Harry, can you still hear me? Do you want to lie down?” Draco’s face was distorted with worry, and Harry frowned. He shook his head, opting instead for wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him close. Immediately, Draco returned the embrace, nuzzling his face into Harry’s hair.
Severus recoiled, slamming his shields up harder, but it was too late. He had already seen, had already caught the tail end of the memory, holding it, dragging it back up through all of Severus’ defences and replaying it in full. Severus pushed down his fear, continuously reinforcing his other shields. He couldn’t let him see anything else. He couldn’t let him see— He just couldn’t.
The duel grew faster and fiercer. Remus was out of breath from keeping up with Harry’s speed — he really ought to work out more outside of these duels, the favour of youth was clearly on Harry’s side. Just as he lifted his wand to fire a jinx, the earth beneath his feet exploded, sending him flying backwards. His wand slipped out of his grasp just as his back hit the ground, and he heard a triumphant shout from Harry.
Severus motioned for the two boys to walk in front of him, and the trio made its way to the castle. As soon as they were out of sight of the stream of students filing into the Great Hall, they all automatically picked up the pace and quickly reached the dungeons.
Draco suppressed a smirk. If academic interest was the key to Granger’s approval, he could work with that. He just needed to get her into a private enough conversation to apologise eventually. As if he’d read his mind, Harry announced that he’d go and get some food, pulling the Weasel along with him and leaving Draco behind alone with Granger. As casually as possible, Draco shifted closer to her, taking Harry’s seat at the edge of the couch. If Granger suspected anything about his intentions she didn’t show it as they began a polite discussion about various books on transfiguration, arithmancy and charms that went beyond N.E.W.T. level.
“Good, now focus on your breath and only your breath. Count it if needed, four in, four out. If your focus wanders, refocus on your breath.”
Remus laughed. “Yeah he tried, but there are places that are completely untouched as of yet. If you ever want to go into the attic, let me know before you walk in there by yourself. I have no idea what’s up there, but I’d rather not take any risks by letting you go alone.”
So, this is the first time I’ve ever attempted to write anything like this—torture, I mean. Please let me know what you think of it!
“Nobody knows how to be a parent before they become one,” Narcissa replied smoothly, letting go of his hand again.
“And since you’re no longer the Potions Professor, you can’t use the need for remedial lessons as an excuse—his Defence work is flawless.”
“The memory was from an Auror — Bob Ogden — back in 1925. In the memory, Ogden visited a house because the son of the family had attacked a Muggle. When he arrived, the son — Morfin — told him to go away — in Parseltongue. Obviously, Ogden didn’t understand and Morfin attacked him. Then the father — Marvolo — stepped in and let Ogden in, although rather reluctantly. Inside, Ogden tried to explain that Morfin had broken the law. That’s when the daughter — Merope — dropped a pot. Marvolo screamed at her to use magic, but when she tried it just broke the pot. She seemed extremely scared, and for good reason judging from how Marvolo treated her. Meanwhile Morfin was singing in Parseltongue the entire time, he sounded quite insane. After Ogden fixed the pot for her, he tried again to explain that Morfin had to come to a hearing and Marvolo lost it.”
“I’m coming, I’m coming, sorry, I—” He broke off as he turned around and was only able to catch a glimpse of platinum hair before he was pushed back against the wall and Draco kissed him.
But Harry didn’t stay on top of Draco, instead rolling over on his side, extinguishing the light of his wand, and pulling Draco close, kissing him again. It felt decidedly more intimate to be kissing in a bed, rather than standing in a kitchen, but after only a few moments, Draco’s anxiety receded. He might not be experienced, but judging from Harry’s reactions he wasn’t doing all that bad.
“I knocked on Severus’ door. He didn’t answer at first, and when he finally did, well—” He broke off. Draco took his hand and ran his thumb soothingly over Harry’s knuckles. “Let’s just say he wasn’t pleased by my presence.”
After a few beats of silence, Lupin spoke again. “We should go downstairs, Narcissa is preparing dinner.”
“Ah yes, here we are. Quite a few estates you’re inheriting there, Mr Potter,” he said, looking rather impressed.
As someone with ADHD, I rarely see this aspect of it in any type of media, and really wanted to include it — especially since it does actually occur with canon-Harry in the books, too. It’s an aspect of ADHD that is often underestimated; the inability to wrench yourself away from the thing that is currently fascinating/important to you. There were already hints of this in earlier chapters, when Harry couldn't focus on anything other than healing.
“Remus! Come in, I’ve got to tell you something,” Harry said, pulling Remus over to the sitting area enthusiastically.
Lupin smiled at him. “I doubt he’ll join us,” he said as he opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. “In fact, I’m fairly sure he won’t. Narcissa was right when she said he’d need some time to calm down. Knowing Harry we won’t see him for another few hours at least.”
Twenty minutes later, the front door of Grimmauld Place closed behind the last Weasley and Harry let out a relieved sigh. No matter how much he loved them all, that had been exhausting.
Snape’s behaviour continued to be rather odd. Harry assumed it had something to do with him no longer looking like James Potter, and decided to simply be grateful for the lack of spite he received during their daily Occlumency lessons. And though those were still not pleasant, he was ultimately thankful for them. If nothing else, his progress with clearing his mind helped with the nightmares—those about Voldemort as well as those about the Dursleys.
For a long moment, neither of them moved and Draco simply kept Harry pressed to his chest. His hands were still firmly on his back, still feeling the uneven bumps beneath his fingers. Then, Harry stirred, tentatively moving away again. Reluctantly, Draco loosened his grip, although he didn’t take his hands off Harry’s back. He moved with him instead, until they were both sitting upright on the couch, faces only inches apart with Draco’s arms still around him.
“The fourth years have lost all their manners over the summer, it’s downright ridiculous. Riley Bovin nearly hexed Flora Bricks’ leg off with his carelessness.”
Draco opened his mouth to ask what exactly he’d done, but Severus shook his head, speaking over him, “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you more, Draco. I truly wish I could.”
“Of course you’d blame it all on them, because I am apparently incapable of forming my own opinions in your mind,” he spat, anger shooting through him. “News flash; neither of them make any choices for me, nor do they try to — unlike you two, they actually trust my judgement. I’ve said it several times already, but I’ll say it one last time: I trust them. Severus is my father, Draco is my partner, and I consider Narcissa family as much as I consider Remus family. They are important to me, and I won’t stand for you insulting them at every turn. Our history may be complicated, but there is more to them as people than their well-practiced masks for the public.”
If Harry was to be believed, said bloody reason had apparently been resolved in the long half-hour during which Harry had gone downstairs to fetch a couple of snacks for them. Just a quick break from reading, from studying.
After a quick check in the mirror, he took a few breaths to steel himself, then went to go find Harry.
Slowly exhaling, Harry pulled away just enough to catch Draco’s gaze, green eyes full of an emotion Draco couldn’t quite place. There was clear apprehension in his face, though, bordering on fear. Draco’s mind was scrambling to comprehend what it was—what would make Harry’s skin feel like
Hermione’s jaw dropped. She inspected the book again, running her fingers over the cover. “A double-sided Protean charm?”
Professor Sinistra momentarily distracted him as she pulled him into a conversation about the schedule for the third years this term, but before long Minerva involved herself and Severus was free to return his attention to the hall. As his eyes wandered down the Slytherin table once more, an unexpected face made him start a little. Cassius Warrington. Hadn’t the boy graduated at the end of last year? Severus frowned slightly. Could he be the one? He’d have to look into the reasons for Warrington’s return.
“It’s … different. The younger students are tolerable in behaviour so far, but the higher years are as stubbornly opposed to it as expected. Especially the Gryffindors. And there are severe gaps in their knowledge of previous years. It isn’t surprising given the constant rotation of instructor, but it does pose a problem particularly for the fifth and seventh years.”
“We brewed Polyjuice Potion in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom because we thought you were the Heir of Slytherin and wanted to interrogate you,” Harry replied sheepishly. “Sorry.”
Harry followed her gaze and his insides tightened a little. Ollivander’s store front was in shambles, broken glass littering the floor behind the windows, the door hanging lopsided from its hinges. Even if he hadn’t already known, anyone could see that Ollivander had not closed and left his shop willingly.
He stared at her in astonishment for a moment. How had she timed that so well? She couldn’t possibly have known when he’d wake up.
They stood facing each other, both with deadly glares, wands drawn. Potter looked like wrath incarnate, magic that made Draco’s knees feel weak already swirling around him. If this escalated into a duel, they’d wake up the entire house and incur his mother’s wrath, but he couldn’t back down now, not with the tension between them rising to a point where it felt like it might unleash like lightning any second.
“Do you have him under an Imperius? What did you do to him?” Weasley barked at Draco, and Draco tensed, shrinking back a little.
Her smile widened. Just as she opened her mouth to respond again, Harry appeared seemingly out of nowhere and flopped down on the couch next to Draco, holding a plate with snacks under his nose.
“Do you care?” Draco countered, trying to suppress the little twinge of hurt in his chest at the idea that Harry didn’t want anyone to see them together.
“Get out of my way,” he hissed, green eyes flashing. Draco’s heart was beating wildly as his insides began to coil in a familiar feeling of anticipation.
Ginny and Dean? Harry had to admit that it was rather surprising. For some reason he’d been fairly certain that Dean was dating Seamus. But perhaps he’d misread their relationship, he wasn’t
Draco smiled to himself and tightened his arms around Harry. They had each other now. He was just drifting off to sleep when Harry spoke up into the darkness again.
“Harry, a normal, one sided Protean charm like I did last year for the DA galleons is already N.E.W.T. level magic that we won’t learn until seventh year. A
“I guess that sort of depends,” he began slowly, hoping incessantly that he wouldn’t say the wrong thing, “on what this is, exactly. I mean, we don’t have to have it all figured out! Just— What is this to you? What do you want, Harry?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “A little, yeah. Come on, Potter, if I’m supposed to face an army of Weasleys in twelve hours, I need all the sleep I can get.”
“I’m sure the potion is just fine, I am merely worried about Severus. It’s rather unconventional for You-Know-Who to have Death Eater meetings in the middle of the day.”
on him. Still, Narcissa’s words had played over and over in his head for hours afterwards, just as they did again now. Severus was attracted to men. It certainly explained his reaction to walking in on Remus in the bath. It explained that faint scent of arousal Remus had smelled on him. And it woke the imaginative parts of Remus’ mind and they were going
Slughorn looked terribly uncomfortable at being called out on his favouritism. Harry would’ve found it hilarious, if Pansy hadn’t also implied that it was only
“Do you take me for a fool? Of course I know that it has to stay secret. How much detention do you intend to give the poor boy in order to see him?”
“Where are we going?” Draco whispered, but Harry just kept walking. When they passed compartment C, Draco snuck a glance at the portly man sitting inside talking to Cormac McLaggen. So that was Horace Slughorn. Neither Severus nor Harry seemed to think very highly of him—Severus having decidedly more experience to go on than Harry. Either way, Draco was inclined to believe them and had already decided that he didn’t like the man very much.
Draco was long done with eating when Severus finally approached the sixth year Slytherins to hand out their schedules. After several long, agonising minutes spent debating with Vince and Greg, Severus sighed and requested that the two see him in his office later and moved on to Blaise, whose class choices were approved of in under thirty seconds.
Grimmauld Place felt eerily empty with three of its inhabitants suddenly gone, and Remus had spent the majority of his day since returning from King’s Cross Station trying to fill the quiet. Judging from Narcissa’s pinched expression as she silently ate her dinner, she wasn’t any happier about her son’s departure and possibly also Harry’s departure—she had grown rather fond of him over the summer. Remus wondered whether she always felt like this when Draco went back to Hogwarts, or whether it was worse now because she was stuck here at Grimmauld Place—with Remus. How would he have felt if Harry had grown up with him instead of his awful relatives? If Remus had been the one to send him of year after year?
to feel Draco’s skin against his own. He tugged the shirt up impatiently, prompting Draco to sit up and pull it over his head. It landed somewhere on the floor, not that either of them paid it any heed.
Following this initial run-in between the two, things got heated quite quickly. Within barely more than a day they were back to shoves, tripping-jinxes, and murmured “prat” and “git” whenever they passed each other.
Not the route Harry would’ve taken, but he supposed it did the trick. Neville was staring at him slack-jawed, and even Luna put down her magazine with a shocked expression, which was a real rarity from Luna. There weren’t many things that could faze her.
Harry pulled a face. Remus had mentioned that Scrimgeour was very keen to find him, but he hadn’t expected the man to harass the Weasleys because of it.
The anger increased tenfold. Severus struggled to force it down, to keep his face neutral as he felt his trust in the headmaster erode a little further.
Draco and Harry both nodded and followed Burgock out of the hall and into the caverns of Gringotts. It didn’t take them long to reach their vaults, and throughout their ride Burgock kept explaining to Harry how he could merge his vaults and how to access which one of them. Looking a little overwhelmed, Harry just listened for the most part, shooting Draco a grateful look when he squeezed Harry’s hand and whispered that he could help him with all that sometime. When they stepped back out of Gringotts, Harry looked the happiest he had ever since that morning Draco had first kissed him. It made Draco’s heart sing, and he couldn’t resist grabbing Harry’s hand.
It can in some cases be quite a strain on relationships. Even in this chapter, Draco feels sort of ignored by Harry — it just doesn’t go on for long enough to truly grow into an issue. In real life, things aren’t always that neatly solved within three days, nor do obsessions just vanish if your partner needs more attention. Neither does hyperfocus let you go when you really really should be focusing on something else (like work or school), which can have quite drastic consequences over time. It can be a difficult thing to manage and I wanted to include it.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m alright,” replied Harry, but his voice was breathier than usual. “I just didn’t expect— Well, I didn’t expect anything, to be honest. How come you have a second bedroom?”
He was surprised to see something like wonder pass over Dumbledore’s features. Surely the headmaster of Hogwarts must know about the castle’s secrets, right? The air of surprise on Dumbledore’s face passed as quickly as it had appeared, and the old wizard looked nothing but serene again.
Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t trust his voice, not with how close he felt to breaking down sobbing. His mind kept replaying the moment it’d happened; Bellatrix’ laughter echoed in his ears, mocking him, driving him mad.
He couldn’t meet Remus’ eyes, couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all his fault, no matter what anyone said.
Draco opened his eyes—when had he closed his eyes?—and looked down at Harry, who met his gaze with only the slightest hint of hesitance in his eyes.
Last night, after Draco had left, he had continued to mull over Harry’s words, thinking about how best to help his cub. When he felt his transformation back into his human form begin, he’d carefully edged away from Harry, somehow managing not to wake the youth up, dressed and then slept for a measly two or three hours, before being startled awake by Harry trying to sneak out of the room. It wasn’t Harry’s fault, his hearing was simply too sensitive.
shoot through him like lightning. He was half aware that he gasped, but he was too captivated by Severus’ heated gaze to care. His eyes dropped to Severus’ lips just as the man’s tongue darted out to wet them.
get used to the feeling of Harry’s body against his, the heat, the smell, the taste of his skin and lips and tongue, the sound of his voice when he was all hot and bothered and needy, asking Draco to touch him. Despite their mutual enthusiasm, however, they had taken things comparably slow. It had taken them at least five attempts until they even managed to get completely naked before they both came. They had failed again the next time.
Minerva’s tone was gentle, but it unnerved Severus all the same. He didn’t want to think about Lily. She was gone, no good came from dragging up these memories.
“Alas, I am completely serious. Although I admit that I did not even remotely believe it would happen when I placed the bet;
“You know—” Weasley’s voice dropped too low to understand, but Severus was fairly sure he was talking about him. About the fact that he was Harry’s father. Because that was something that had to be talked about, something to be discussed.
“There he is, our dearest investor!” Fred beamed at him. “Did George give you the tour? Splendid! We figured it’d be best not to say anything in front of Ron—nobody really knows where we got the money to start the shop—but you, my dear Harrykins, take whatever you like, no charge. You have a life-long 100 percent discount.”
was walking on eggshells around Harry, Draco seemed to have one simple goal: To get Harry’s diverted attention back. It was oddly endearing, and it gave Harry something plain and simple to focus on. Plain, simple and distractingly attractive.
Draco started to draw Harry again. He glanced up to get a reference when he heard footsteps walking briskly back. Harry had just pulled himself under the cloak when Madam Pomfrey entered and walked by Draco.
"How? How can it get better, it's beautiful." He breathed. His mouth was slightly opened, his right hand was close to his face. It really was beautiful.
In third year, when he found out he was gay, it completely shattered everything that he though he knew.
"Will do." Harry said. Draco walked over to a chair and sat down, his back against one arm rest, his legs thrown over the other. "Ah, proper posture at it's finest." Harry teased at his position.
Draco then realized that he was relaxed. He hadn't really been thinking about much, just drawing Perfect Harry Potter, and he had somehow relaxed. He guessed drawing really did help.
"This isn't a new experience 'Mione, we've done this 6 times before. Besides, it was a pretty normal day. Nothing out of the ordinary happened." Ron commented as they sat near the fire.
He felt calm, alone, and at peace when he was here. There was no one around him. No voices, no expectations. Just him. Just him and this longing to fall off his broom. Not to die, just to free fall toward the beautifully green tree tops. Forever falling, never hitting anything. Maybe his happy place self was going to it's own happy place, and that's why he felt like falling. Not that it mattered, he wouldn't fall. Because he knew that just because he was alone right now, didn't mean he would be alone for long. He knew that soon he would need to do something, that people expected him to do something, but he just sat there. Maybe that is what made it beautiful, and so amazingly peaceful. The fact that he was putting everything off, and just sitting there. Who cared that he was probably needed somewhere? Or that someone needed his saving? They could wait, because Harry was going to do something for himself for once.
"That sounds great." He said, keeping the fear out of his voice. Hermione knew. She'd bring it up. He didn't want to talk about it until he figured out all that he was feeling.
And maybe it made Draco feel better when he thought that Potter was young, because that meant that he was also young, and had so much life left. That the events that took place here wouldn't be it. There was more, so much more.
"Of course not, I wouldn't sink so low as to go for that again." Draco said picking up his favorite muggle book, The Hobbit. He had read it so many times the cover was frayed, but he liked it that way.
They sat in silence. Draco was thinking of a world where people were more accepting. He could walk around, hand in hand, with a guy. He wouldn't have to hide his feelings. That would be great.
Harry felt calm and happy, because all the problems he always seemed to struggle under, lifted when he joked light-heartedly with Draco. Sure there were other, not so comfortable feelings that lurked in his mind, jumping out at him when he least expected. But the good feelings, the ones making it earlier, they made it all worth while. Harry had suffered for a long time, he was glad to feel free, even if it was temporary. Draco made him happy. It was that simple. But also very complicated. All Harry knew for sure was, he wouldn't have been able to survive this year with out Draco. What started as silence had morphed into friendship and understanding. Harry chose to ignore the feeling that he wanted it to turn into something more than just friendship, sleep deprivation works wonders on a person.
Yet, like everything in Draco's life that seemed to be good for him, sleep slowly seeped away from him soon. He never really got sleep anyway, and his tiredness felt normal.
"Sure, I could use a walk around the castle. Not like I have anything better to do anyway." Draco said placing his sketch pad down next to him. Over the hours, he had finished a few drawings, and he had just started a new one. Harry still hadn't asked what he was drawing, but he suspected it was him. Every now and again Draco, when looking up, would look at another part of Harry, like his hair or robes, then sketch again.
Harry wasn't really paying attention, all the focusing had drained him. All he wanted to do right now was sleep, well, sleep as much as he could. More likely than not, he'd be up before the sun rose, just like this morning. But he wouldn't mind a repeat of this morning, it was more clam than the rest of his day. It hadn't left him feeling drained, in fact, it almost made him feel better. Silent, but not alone. He found himself hoping that Malfoy would be there again when he inevitably woke up before everyone else. It was peaceful, even if it was Malfoy that was there.
Draco seemed to put so much concern into his voice, how did he do that? How did he lace so many emotions into two words? Why did Harry care? Merlin, Harry’s hands were shaking, he wanted to vomit. Maybe all his thoughts would be thrown up as well. One could only hope.
In fact he had almost went to the Great Hall for breakfast. But he decided that other people may not be so kind to him as to speak with him.
They were leaving, and they were turning a corner. But Draco was hardly paying attention. He was still shocked at the eye contact.
A hour ticked by, and Draco was glad it was only 3 am, because he really didn't want Potter to leave, because the mornings never seemed to last long enough.
Draco stepped into his dorm as Theodore Nott was leaving. Blaise was still in bed, but looked awake.
"Well, I best be off. Thank you again for apologizing, it always takes a lot to say that you were wrong." Then she turned abruptly and strode off towards her own table.
"They were so obvious. It was annoying, honestly. They followed you around like lost puppies. They gave me death glares and threatened me to leave you alone. It was hilarious." He had, on many occasions, been told to leave Harry alone, 'or else'. He laughed them off and ignored them.
So Draco distracted himself with listing the magical properties of porcupine quills. It was tedious and boring, but it was keeping his mind occupied. Sometimes he wondered if he belonged in Ravenclaw, and he gave a bitter laugh.
"Yes. He's half dressed. Just don't use my bed." He called after her as she went in. They weren't really together last time he checked, but he still liked to tease them.
Harry hadn't meant that Malfoy was worth nothing, but that was the way it came out. He immediately wanted to apologize, but for what? He had stopped Ron from killing Malfoy right there in the hallway, and Ron would defiantly killed him, but Harry kept thinking about this morning. Maybe he was reading to far into the silence they had both kept in the common room, but it seemed like Malfoy was just going through the motions when people were around, much like Harry.
They were all like sheep without a single thought of their own, Draco thought. But even he found himself clapping for the Hufflepuff that was sorted next, and for the Gryffindor that bowed as she got off of the stool.
She handed him an apple, "I figured you hadn't eaten, considering when you came into my class. Try not to skip meals, it's not good for your health." Her voice was sweet, and he took the apple.
So he went to the kitchens. Though he'd never been before, he knew where they were, and how to get in. That was Crabbe and Goyles fault, they had talked so loudly to each other he always over heard everything. Though they weren't the brightest of the bunch, he almost missed their bold presence.
Harry opened his eyes and saw a blurry world. He reached for his glasses and checked the time, 4:37 am. He rubbed his eyes and sighed. Slowly the dream left him, and he quickly forgot that he had dreamed at all. Making his way to the common room, he felt nervous. Then, as he saw Draco sitting there, sketch pad open, lazily drawing, the nerves flew away. Draco looked up, and Harry offered a small smile. As Draco returned it, Harry sat in front of the fire once again, in a different position. To him, it had been another dreamless night, thanks to Draco.
So he produced a razor blade from his robes. He didn't usually have one with him, but he figured that he should today.
Then the lion pounced on him, pushing him into the ground. It's hot breathe huffed onto his face. It looked into his eyes, as if searching for something. It's silver eyes, suddenly, with the rest of it's head, looked at the now large stain of blood on him. Harry thought the lion was going to rip him open, help the wound, kill him. But, it slowly licked the wound, once, and closed it eyes. Golden light seeped out from the lions head, traveling down to Harry's abdomen. Harry felt a warm, fuzzy feeling slowly start to heal him.
“Harry?” Draco turned to him and stood up. Harry looked at him, he wasn’t a dream, he was real, he was right there, he could reach out and touch him. “What’s wrong?”
That was how he found himself in a secluded corner of the Library, thinking about anything but his essay.
Harry looked at him as if he knew something Draco didn't. He gave a small laugh, sending more butterflies to Draco's stomach. Draco didn't pay too much attention to it, maybe it would go away in time.
This reminded Harry of the first time he was on this train. How nervous yet happy he felt riding to somewhere where the Dursleys could not get him. He was still nervous, but not happy. Harry hadn't been truly happy for quiet sometime. But he really didn't care anymore. He didn't care about much nowadays, only keeping himself alive until he can somehow pay back all the lives he had taken. All the people, the brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, everyone.
"Me too." Potter's voice had gotten softer, and Draco noticed that he was staring into the fire, just like he did every morning.
"Hey. I know you probably don't want another person here, but Luna has helped me with somethings, and I thought it would be good for you to talk to her." Harry said running his hand through his hair and looking away. Draco hoped his fear wasn't showing on his face.
"Whatever you say Potter." Draco said shaking his head. His hair fell into his eyes and he did his usual charm to put it into a small bun. He wondered what his father would think, with his hair in a bun.
Draco was really glad Potter hadn't said anything, he really didn't feel like starting things this early. But he was prepared for it when Potter walked in. Thankfully Potter understood that it was indeed to early to argue with anyone. But he knew if it was Weasley, he would have been hexed, or just told to sod off at the very least.
"The world would be a better place if I was dead." Draco lost all emotion because it was true. If he had died, the world would be better off. One less evil murder to worry about.
Harry took a step forward and Draco fell into step next him. They didn't say anything, but Harry could already breathe more freely than he had most of the day. Harry led the way, though he didn't really know where he was going. He wanted to be alone, truly alone, with Draco. To be able to act freely, not just breathe. He was tempted to walk into one of the empty classrooms nearby, but wasn't sure how Draco would react to being pushed into an empty classroom.
"You should hear the jokes about you I make behind your back. It would be about what Perfect Saint Potter had screwed up that day. You screw up a lot, there was a lot of jokes." Draco retorted as if Harry failing was a fact of life. Which it was, there was always something Perfect Potter had messed up horribly. Mostly in Potions.
Funny, the scars seemed to distort the Mark into something different, and that made Draco feel better about it.
He looked at the part of Harry's face that was showing and wanted to hug him. Draco wanted to tell him that everything was going to be okay. That he was here. That Draco would help him.
Like most things, it was his fault. He knew he should probably try again, because they knew more about him than everyone else.
"Only slightly." Harry agreed nodding his head. "But I am the one who found you, so it's only fair if I'm the one that helps you through the boredom." Harry said pulling one of his legs up onto the bed.
"Did you know you had an official fan club? That year they took most of my 'Potter Stinks' badges and tried to change them. But I had made sure that they all were thoroughly protected." Draco said. He remembered the fan club. It was always fun to bust in on their meetings. No one knew how he had always found them, but he would laugh at them. But before he told them how stalkerish they were, he'd listen, they spied for him, unknowingly.
"I'll have to take your word for it. Though if one things true, I can't seem to die." Harry said jokingly.
"Really 'Mione, I don't see why we have so many classes today. They could have spread it out more. Tomorrow we only have one class, even though it's not with everyone. I just don't see why not switch it around." Ron was complaining.
Draco had also noticed it in the halls, less fights. He had seen younger Hufflepuffs walking with Slytherins, going to classes, laughing. He had seen older Ravenclaws in the library, helping 1st year Slytherins find books.
"Harry?" Hermione shook him out of his thoughts, "Harry, I said you should get your robes on, we'll be there in 10 minuets." She looked at him slightly concerned, Over the summer he tended to zone out, and she had hoped that the school would help him focus more, but she was still worried as any best friends should be. Thankfully she didn't mention it.
It was only a week in, and already the mold was breaking. It gave Draco a small bit of hope in the world. Hopefully it continued to change.
The the elf appeared again and handed each boy a plate of eggs, bacon, and toast. Each boy thanked the elf has he left, and started to eat.
"You're pathetic." Someone spat at him. Them he heard them walk away, apparently satisfied that they had roughed him up a bit.
This was the feeling Harry was talking about, the overwhelming need to smile at Draco, to have him close, to never let him go. To want to hear his voice, and feel the relaxation that his presence that Draco gave Harry.
Well, he would call it happy, more like peaceful. The muggle counselor had told him to go there when ever he felt upset, or sad, or like everything was his fault, so he ended up there a lot. He was sitting on his broom, above a vast forest, and the sun was rising. The wind gently caressed his face, and he could hear the sound of bird calls below him. There were mountains in the distance, and he knew there was a lake behind him somewhere. But he didn't go anywhere. He stayed still on his broom and looked down at the tree tops.
He gave a weak smile. "Well, I was wondering where you were, because you weren't at lunch, even though I know you don't eat lunch in the Great Hall, so I... um... went looking for you." Harry looked away and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Not really, unless I have a reason, I never really had the time. Between sleeping and foiling plans of the people who wanted me dead, I didn't have time to take a stroll though the castle." Harry said checking the Map again, to see if they were in the clear, but mostly so he could stop himself from starring at Draco. The soft moon light seemed to make his hair glow a dull white light, and Harry wanted to touch it. But he wouldn't, that would be weird, and they had just started to become friends. Harry didn't really want to ruin that.
Draco's anxiety, with had just started to go away, increased. A million thoughts raced his mind. They were all equally horrible.
Over the summer, Hermione has gone to talk to this old muggle women, who thankfully knew about the wizarding world. Then, when she said it was helping her, she encouraged the boys to do the same. She drug Harry and Ron to 5 meetings, and neither were too happy about it.
Even the 1st and 2nd years got it bad from older students. How shallow do you have to be to make fun of a 11 or 12 year old because they wore green? How 'brave', or 'wise', or 'kind' did that make someone?
"Me too." Harry said in the same soft voice. He lowered the map and looked out of the window to the moon. He came to a stop and peered out to the Forbidden Forest.
"Leave a note and don't let her know where you're hiding. You could hide in my dorm. No one would mind and it would be the last place they looked." Draco offered, his eyes meeting Harry's. Harry just searched his eyes for something. He didn't really know what he found but it made him smile.
Way too soon, he left, he didn't want to leave, but he knew Ron was going to wake up any minute now and he needed to be there when he did. And he started the day with Ron telling him about his dream, which Harry didn't pay any attention to. Then breakfast came and went rather quickly, he hardly remembers siting there for longer than 10 minutes. Then Charms was easy, they were once again reviewing simple charms, and Harry found himself impatient, but he didn't know why. What did he have to look forward to today?
The only calm he had felt that day was when Draco had held his hand. And even then, it was fleeting. He needed Draco right now. He needed to calm down. He could feel panic rising up his chest, his room suffocated him. The curtains made shadows too dark to be real. Everything was hot, he couldn't breathe. He needed Draco.
How could it bee Harry's fault? He had saved so many people, ended the war. While Draco had helped start it. Draco didn't do anything to help.
Yes he was go to do this. "I... umm... I just wanted to... er... I guess I just wanted to say..." He let out a sigh and looked her in the eye. "I would like to say I am sorry for the way I treated you in the past. And even this school year. I know you probably won't believe me, but around 3rd year I stopped meaning it. I just said it to keep up my reputation. Again, I'm sorry." He said in one breath.
That was why, when Draco walked into the common room that night after dinner, Harry forced himself not to look too long at him. He wanted to get up, talk to him, walk with him, just be near him. But he knew if he so much as looked at Draco differently than normal, Hermione would catch on. He allowed himself a small look, and caught Draco's eyes for just a second.
He again slowly pressed down. Again slowly sliced. He knew he was going a little too deep. But he didn't care. All he cared about was the pain. The escape.
"I solemnly swear I'm up to no good." Harry said, tapping his wand to the blank Map he held in his hands. Draco peered over his shoulder and watched the Map come to life. Even though Draco was only a little taller than Harry, he seemed to tower over him.
"Maybe you should talk to him. If you wanted to. It might clear things up." Luna suggested, and of course this was probably the best thing to do, but, he couldn't.
This felt right. Sitting here, across from Draco, joking, laughing, having fun. Not having to worry about people, or questions. He felt happy, truly happy, for the first time in many months. Maybe it was crazy that it was Draco that was making his feel happy, like they weight on his shoulders was gone. But he didn't care, because it felt right. Harry wondered if Draco felt the same, like they could relax with each other, unlike with other people. Harry hoped it wasn't just him, he didn't want to annoy Draco. But when he saw Draco smile, he figured Draco felt it too.
Harry was the star Quidditch player for Gryffindor. He was the Champion of the Triwizard Tournament. He was Harry Fucking Potter. He was straight.
So Harry helped Draco stand, holding him by his elbow and shoulder. Draco stood, and stared off into the distance, but walked with Harry. Draco had slightly bent over and was clutching his stomach. Harry wondered what had happened, and clenched his jaw. He hated seeing people hurt. They slowly made their way to the Hospital Wing, which wasn't that far. Thankfully they didn't run into anyone, Harry did not want to deal with questions. All he wanted was to take Draco to the hospital and see that he got better.
A stream of nervous 1st years crowded into the Great Hall. There were twice as many, since last year very few had been permitted in to Hogwarts. So this held the 12-year-olds who should have gotten in, and the new 11-year-olds.
"Yeah, I guess. Just give me a second to write a note to Ron. I won't tell him where I am so they won't look for me. I'll take the Map though, to make it seem like I'm not still here." Harry said as if he'd been thinking about it.
Class was starting, and the new professor stood up from her small desk in the front of the class. It was weird not having McGonagall for Transfiguration, but the new professor seemed fine. She was a thin, short woman, who's hair fell just below her shoulders, she was a lot younger than McGonagall. Her voice was soft, yet held presence, and everyone paid attention as she introduced herself and immediately started class. Her name was Malnee Clawford, and had been in Ravenclaw during her time at Hogwarts. She was Bill Weasley's age, and Harry wondered if they knew each other.
"Where were you last night?" Blaise asked tiredly. Blaise was one of the few people who were still civil with him, though he wouldn't really call him a friend anymore.
"What ever you say mister 'A Hippogriff Scratched Me Now I'm Going To Die'. Honestly I laughed about that for weeks." Harry said rolling his eyes.
Draco didn't ask questions, he just looked at the fire. He wanted to look at Harry, study his face. Draw him in his mind. But he didn't want to give himself away and ruin their timid friendship.
"No. Just stop." Harry sighed exasperatedly. He threw his hands up in surrendered. "Anyway, I brought your sketch pad. I figured you'd want something to do if I got caught and had to leave." Harry said pulling Draco's things from his robes. He handed them to Draco.
It would be different, if it had been someone like him. Someone who was a bully. Someone who had hurt others before. Someone who had done what they were told by the Carrows. Someone who did not fight back. If it had been him. He deserved pain. But Granger, she is a good person.
Harry found himself, once again, throwing glances at Draco throughout the day. He couldn't help but feel better as he looked at Draco's silent frame in the halls. It was Tuesday, and they didn't share any classes. Harry found the schedule odd. Most days they went to class with all the 8th years, but Tuesdays, they had gotten to chose what classes to take, so everyone was split up.
The last thing was Draco. His white blonde hair cascading around his face in a silk curtain. A brilliant smile was married to his face. On which Harry had never seen on Draco's face. His grey eyes brimmed with laughter and warmth. He was wearing a black long-sleeve shirt that met dark jeans at his waist. He was leaning back on his hands that were pressing against the soft dirt. The sunlight from a unknown source shone on his hair and gave his a golden glow. He looked stunning. Draco was absolutely gorgeous. Harry's breathe caught at the sight of his looking so happy.
"You do have a knack for almost dying, it's the only thing you're good at." Draco added with a another smile. But it quickly faded, he looked down at his arm, the bandages. He slowly started to undo them when his hands started shaking. Harry noticed.
Even though he deserved this, he needed to get out of this hallway. He needed to leave. Needed to go take care of the itch on his left forearm. He was done trying to stop himself like he had promised his mother, done.
The time neared 7, and Draco knew early risers were soon to flood the common room, so he stood up. He took the drawing of Harry and placed it face down next to him.
Draco rolled his eyes. He seemed to roll his eyes a lot around them. "Besides, Potter's straight." The words stung. He should know better than fall for a straight person, but he couldn't help himself.
He thought it had something to do with his mother, even though she never stopped the excessive punishments that would fall upon him with he would step out of line. She would sit there, and look away, as her son fell further away from her. Yet after each one, she would hug him tightly, and look at him as if she had a million words she wanted to say, but she never did. But when his father wasn't home, she would sit silently by him, then tell him one thing again and again, as if anything more might cause more harm then healing.
"And we have Friday, another half day. I'm taking Apparition," Harry added, mentally running through his timetable, which he had only looked at this morning when Hermione had got on to him. Old habits die hard he guessed. Ron had started talking again, but Harry was lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice much. But when someone brushed past him he heard the word "Abomination" come off their lips. He turned too see who the person was talking about.
"Err, um, no. I actually think I'm going to lay down." He said standing up. He added, "I'll see you guys at dinner." Then walked off before they could protest.
"Running scared? Just like the fucking Malfoy  you are. What? Don't want to fight back. Maybe I'll just have to punch harder." A tall 6th year Ravenclaw said, stepping toward Draco and swinging with all her might.
Harry woke with a start, like he did so many times before. Sweat dripping down his face and eyes wide. Nightmares still dancing evilly through his unawake mind. Screams and laughter and all the usual things. But, something about that nightmare was off, wrong, truly life threateningly scary. It was Hermione and Ron laughing, a fierce cackle, doubling over in, tears streaming down their cruelly smiling faces.
"So an old guy? Is that were you've been running off to? As long as it isn't Finch-Fletchley again..." Pansy said turning the page of her book.
But he couldn't bring himself to stand up to his father, and maybe that's why he wasn't put into Gryffindor. But then again, he wasn't wise, or ambitious, or even loyal, or anything other than a pawn in a game his father had thrown him into. He felt as if he didn't belong anywhere.
Draco found himself not wanting to move. Not wanting to leave. Not wanting to stop looking into his eyes.
"No, I've never tried. I just go down to meals like a normal person." Harry said, looked up at the canopy over the bed.
The yellow-orange colour meant 'Wonder'. And that could mean lots of things. Harry pondered what could give Draco wonder. It was most likely the flowers themselves, he had called them beautiful. Harry thought they were beautiful too, they seemed to add a touch of colour to Draco's pale skin and platinum blonde hair. Honestly everything about Draco was pale and light coloured, expect his robes, the black green seemed to perfectly match Draco. Green and black were really his colours.
But of course, Draco got saddled with the deranged author and had to now deal with feelings and shit. Sure he'd had crushes before, but not on Harry fucking Potter. He didn't think.
"I bet. I mean, the entire room? On the ceiling? Lord, my aunt and uncle would have a field day with that. Granted it would have been hard considering I slept in the cupboard under the stairs until the my first letter arrived. They were worried they'd get in trouble for mistreating me, so they gave me my cousins second bedroom." Harry said as if living under the stairs was completely normal.
His head was much clearer as he finished his Charms essay. It wasn't until he was packing up to leave when he realized Granger would have finished the essay the day they had gotten it. She hadn't needed that book.
When he left the hospital wing, he headed immediately to his first class, Charms. It was a little odd that all the 8th years would be sharing most classes, considering that not all of them were interested in the same N.E.W.Ts. But if this was how it was going to be, he had to get used to it.
Draco smiled to himself, it felt as if a weight had been lifted from his chest. That short conversation made him feel less like a monster.
"Sod off." Draco said grouchily. Harry couldn't help but laugh. He waved off the death glare he got from Draco and smiled wider. Sitting here with Draco felt good. Like there was no pressure, no one needed anything form Harry other than to be himself.
As he stepped into the kitchens he was greeted by many exited house elves. They swarmed him and fussed over why he wasn't at dinner with everyone else. Then immediately whipped up a meal for him right there.
His forearm had started to dully itch again. And the flowers on his arm had turned white. He vaguely recalled that meant feeling worthless. They couldn't be more right.
A part of Harry didn't like the fact that Draco made him feel better. That part of him wanted to jinx and hex Draco every time Harry saw him. But he kept it under control. It was probably all those years fighting each other, it never seemed to let go. It longed for the normalcy of telling him to sod off and ignoring his sneers and smirks.
But Charms was starting, and he was going to need to get an Exceeds Expectations in Charms if he wanted to qualify for Auror training. So he sat and listened more intently than he had in a class before, besides Lupin's class that it. He tried not to think about Lupin, too many things would swarm his head. Somehow he was able to keep focus until class ended, and he headed off to double potions.
He also found himself willing the time to speed forward to the next morning. He wanted the silent calming presence that helped him feel better. Ron and Hermione noticed him getting more talkative. Almost like he was going back to normal. They had asked him about it, and he said it was due to the fact they were back at Hogwarts, doing something they had done so many times in their lives. Ron agreed that he felt more at home now too, but Hermione, true to herself, knew there was probably something more to it.
"I thought she's see me. I'm glad she didn't though. McGonagall might have cried if I got caught this early in the school year doing something against the rules. She thinks I've settled down, and I don't want to break that illusion just yet." Harry said again folding up the cloak next to him.
"I could have helped you." He said, fighting back a sob. He could have helped more. He was a horrible person. He ignored her screams, her cries for help. How could she forgive him?
He saw Hermione looking at them. Her face betrayed so many emotions, worry, fear, sadness… Draco caught her eye, he felt bad, she was one of his oldest friends, she should be the one comforting him, not Draco.
"I don't want detention at all. But if I had to have it, I'd want it later in the year." Draco said, not offering farther explanation. They both started to walk to the door.
So he re-imagined everything. The first thing he added was flowers. A flower field that stretched as far as the eye could see. Next came the sky. It was a soft shade of blue, with white cotton clouds making odd shapes that Harry could just identify as something familiar. Then the tree. A willows whose branches hung over head, making a cool dim place to sit. The smell almost hit Harry like a train. It smelled like wet dirt and the soft sent of vanilla. He didn't know where the vanilla came from, but it was perfect.
"Actually, I got the Cloak first. I got it for Christmas... First year... From Dumbledore..." Harry ran his hand through his hair and gave a meek smile.
He suddenly felt like he was being watched. Infuriatingly slowly, he turned toward the sea again. Before his eyes could register what was there, it vanished in a poof of white mist. He didn't feel afraid of it, instead, he felt drawn to look for it. His eyes searched the rocky shore and found a shadow lurking among a pile of boulders that formed to look like a clutching hand.  He crept toward it, not wanting it to run away.
He was staring at the fire and his eyes began to dry. He must have been sitting there for 20 minuets, and his butt was starting to ache. He blinked a few times and listened to see if anyone else had came it, because the fireplace was the only thing in his view. But all he heard was Malfoy's quill scratching away at the drawing parchment. Harry wondered what he was drawing, but resisted the urge to ask. Just because they weren't hexing each other did not mean they were friends. Besides, by the end of the day they would be at each others throats because that is what was normal. Also Ron had already said he didn't like having Malfoy so close to their dorm.
"Ah. Anyway, did you like the second potion we made today? I found it quiet interesting." Bless Hermione, queen of changing the subject.
Weasel had turned red in the face, and looked as if he was about to yell, but was cut off by Granger, "Ronald. He's not worth it. Come on, class is about to start." She walked off, the rest of the Golden Trio on her heals.
"I was just suggesting a Hogsmead weekend." Hermione  said as her eyes darted to Draco. "McGonagall said we can go any time, as long as we informed her before hand, and we're back before sunset." Harry's stomach dropped. Hermione knew, she had figured it out. Of course she did.
School was hard. With a fake smile plastered on his face, and all the noise, he needed a break. Draco was that break. It was odd to think that a person could help him so much. A person who happened to be Draco Malfoy. Harry laughed to himself, funny how life can turn around like that.
"Then I'm glad you were there." Draco responded softly. It was true, he was really glad that The Dark Lord had not returned in 1st year. He would have preferred he had never returned at all. With him came despair.
Harry came back and they continued to the next door. Draco pushed open the door softly. He knew neither boy in the room was a soft sleeper, but he didn't want to wake them, just in case.
"They punished me and wouldn't hear reason." Draco was taken back. Punished him? For accidental magic? Even when he accidentally died his Fathers hair dark blue, he wasn't blamed. "There was this one time, they had my hair cut short, because they didn't like how untamed it was. Then I grew it back, and my aunt nearly died. She almost shaved my head, except my bangs. 'To hide that hideous scar.' But over night it grew back. Lucky, they couldn't find a reason for that to be my fault." Harry laughed at the memory.
Draco tilted his head slightly to the side and gave a small shrug. Every movement Draco made in public was small, barley noticeable. But when he knew no one was watching, he seemed to be as dramatic as ever. "Sure." He looked like he wanted to say more, but stopped himself.
Harry was laying on the ground, parallel with the fire place. He had his right forearm thrown over his eyes, and his glasses were pushed onto his head. He looked like he was sleeping.
What could you say to someone who had seen you so vulnerable? Draco hadn't brought himself to look Harry in his eyes after he had hugged him.
But eventually, Harry decided to talk. Well her more like got mad and yelled something along the lines of 'I deserve the pain but no one else should have to go through this, this is all my fault' and she finally got him to talk about it. And it did make him feel better, because now he knew what to say to people that had lost someone because of him. But he still felt it was his fault, he knew it was.
"Sorry, this isn't helpful. I... just thought... maybe if she... I don't know... covered it up... it'd help you? But it's no big deal, she'll leave if you don't want her help." Harry said quickly, picking up on Draco's hesitation.
"Now that was exiting. You must have added in the fairy wings in two at a time, the instructions say one by one. Go make sure you didn't inhale much of that smoke, it will make your skin green. Mr.Thomas, can you escort him? With green skin comes backwards legs." Slughorn said, excusing the two boys from class. Harry heard them talking as they walked out the door, something about a Hogsmead weekend coming up. "Now!" Slughorn clapped, "time to make me beautiful!"
Draco came and stood besides him. He too looked out of the window, but he gazed to the stars. The constellation Lacerta, the Lizard could be seen, shining in the east.
He felt no emotions as he slowly pulled up is left sleeve. He looked at his pale arm, the black mark that he hated with his entire being.
"Er..." What was she talking about? "Yeah." He gave halfheartedly, hopefully she wouldn't notice he had tuned out a few minuets after they had left the station.
Draco tried to see what was so important that his brain needed to keep reminding him of Potter. It could have been Potters agreement that they were both insane, but is continuous thoughts about Potter had started this morning.
“Harry.” Hermoine said again, when had she stood up? Why did she have to be here? This was their space. His and Draco’s. Now it was ruined. Harry couldn’t breathe. The world was spinning and his eyes unfocused and his mind went somewhere horrible and dark and, and…
As he relaxed and fell into his drawing, he felt as if surviving this year wouldn't be that hard, because the silence that was held was nothing less than perfectly promising.
Draco sat alone, he had locked the small compartment and made it seem as if is was packed with trunks and bags. He really didn't want to be near anyone.
"But, I was obsessed out of hate. You two know this." Draco said. What in the name of Merlin were they talking about?
"It's almost time to wake Ron up. He hates waking up in the mornings." Harry stood and stretched, his shirt reaching up a little to reveal his stomach. Was Draco imagining them, or did Harry have abs? God, he was a sucker for muscles. "I'll see you in class." Harry said and walked do his dorm with a small smile playing on his lips.
Draco let a small smile seep across his face, before he caught himself. He hoped they hadn't noticed.
"No it wouldn't." It was Harry who said it. He had said it so strongly Draco was a little taken back.
"Not you too. Please, I deal with it enough." Draco mumbled, but he honestly wouldn't mind a pet name from Harry.
Madam Pomfrey quickly sorted things out and gave him a small breakfast since he was likely to miss it. She didn't ask any questions, but looked as if she wanted to.
"Why wouldn't I?" She offered, then she sat next to Draco and pulled out some paint brushes. "May I?" She reached her hand out to Draco's left arm. He slowly reached out to her.
Then the flowers started to change colours. It shifted into a soft blue, then to a green, then coming to rest at different shades of soft pinks.
"Eh, it doesn't matter in the end anyway. I'll just have less stories to tell my grandchildren." Harry said trying to cover up the fact that he wanted to experience what normal teens experience. For one day he wanted to not be the Chosen One, to party and play games and drink. Have fun and play pranks, to laugh without doom looming over him.
"There is no new guy." Which was true, Harry wasn't knew in his life. He just saw hims differently was all.
So after Transfiguration, Harry went to talk to someone who he had often found himself seeking advice from over the summer. Luna Lovegood had been the only person to really know what was going on in Harry's head, and Harry didn't really know why he had opened up to Luna, but in the end, she really helped. She had really good advice, and Harry knew she wouldn't ask more questions than necessary. So he found comfort in Luna, and her weird useful advice.
He slowly brought the blade to his arm. Slowly pressed down. Slowly sliced. Savoring the pain it brought.
Their friendship hadn't been the same since the War. Draco blamed himself. He hadn't spoken with them over the summer. He didn't write back, so they stopped sending owls.
It wasn't like he didn't deserve them, he did, he knew it. He was the one who let the Death Eaters into the castle, but it still hurt.
Draco sighed and shook his head. "Honestly, I shouldn't be surprised. You always seem to have something unique and very rare when it's needed. To people just give you these things on your birthday? Do they think it makes a good birthday present? 'Ah yes, Harry, you're 13 now, here's the map of the school that shouldn't exist, it will help you stalk people and avoid teachers. This is a great gift to give a child.'" He said the last in a weird voice. Harry couldn't help but laugh.
Well, not really, Pansy and Blaise had chose to sit with him at dinner. But he'd rather not talk about why he took the day off. Pansy was glad to hear he ate, and Blaise was happy Draco was listening to his ranting about a hot Gryffindor he refused to name.
Draco wanted to ask so many questions, he needed answers, but he let Harry cry. What could he say? How could he ask something and not seem insensitive? He was just Draco, nothing special, he wasn’t good with people, or emotions…
Harry was glad Malfoy was there when he walked in. Though he didn't really understand why. It wasn't like he wanted him there, or anyone there, but still, he was glad. So he walked silently over to a chair and sat down on it, hugging his knees to his chest, and slowly his mind shifted to his happy place. Because he had had a nightmare. And this one was a bad one.
"Want to go for a walk?" Harry suggested. He was glad he thought of something to say, because he had not thought of what to do once he got to Draco.
It became obvious that they were not his friends quickly. One name took a step towards him, then he moved back, as if startled. The group then got in front of him, and someone was nearly standing on top of him. Harry felt his stomach drop, he had to do something. He quickly left the dorms and moved to where he had seen Draco's name. It was on the 3rd floor, one of the back corridors that didn't usually get a lot of foot traffic. He rushed up the stairs, barely able to remember which ones where trick ones. He was so close when the stares decided to move. He yelled out a profanity and looked around frantically to find another way to the hall.
So his mind had him want to say all the things his father had made him write. But he couldn't let himself, it would end badly.
Harry found himself wanting to say 'I don't know', but what he said was, "Because someone once said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. So I sat somewhere different to avoid insanity." Harry himself didn't even know that was the reason, but he guessed his mind did.
The sun set, and they sat there for a long time. Neither made a move to stand. Both knew that as soon as they did, the moment would be lost. They knew that they'd have to wait for the morning to share this with each other again. The morning seemed so far away, they didn't want to let go.
"Yes. Have you never tried to get the house elves to come to your dorm? I even know most of their names." Draco said, slightly unbelieving. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing.
Silence. Like this morning. Why couldn't he stop thinking about this morning? There was something about it, but he couldn't put his finger on it.
Draco Malfoy had barley been able to stop himself from adding to his collection of scars on his left forearm.
Draco said the first thing that came to mind. "You wish." Draco returned with his own smirk. He knew he shouldn't instigate them, but he'd had enough.
He knew what Draco was trying to say in the simple gesture. All that he was trying to convey without a noise. All the feeling that Draco trying to put in it.
Draco had always loved stars. Everything about them. They always seemed to far away. But bright, and welcoming. Their beautiful light always seemed so pure, untouched by evil things.
It was the day, over Easter break, when Harry had been dragged to the Manor. But it did not begin with the 5 prisoners being brought in.
He ran into his dorm and stopped in front of his trunk. He searched frantically before he found the box he was looking for. Grabbing it, he ran back to the Slytherin dorm, where Draco was now standing looking very confused.
Draco needed fresh air. He needed to clear his mind. Just has Draco was starting to sit up, Harry walked back in.
But she nodded to him, and gave a weak smile, like she understood that somethings are just different. Draco watched as she turned and walked back to her dorm.
Draco had finished his drawing and had started to draw the Whomping Willow, when he looked up at Potter and found he had fallen asleep.
Not only had he needed help, he had also cried. What would his father say? What would his father do?
"It has to be that specifically. If you get it wrong Misters Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs will tell you off." Harry said finding Filtch in the dungeons near the Slytherin common rooms. "He's near the dungeons, and no one's on this floor, we should be fine for a while."
Madam Pomfrey quickly had things sorted out, and was mumbling something along the lines of, "Once they were done I thought I'd been in the clear."
He almost took out a sketch book and drew it, but decided that it was much more beautiful in real life.
"It's because I'm wondering why you're still here. There's nothing to do, and I'm sure Granger and Weasley will be wonder where you are." Draco said putting the chart in his robes and moving so he was leaning on the headboard. He stretched his legs out behind Harry's back and crossed his arms.
And he should be with is father. In a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors. Slowly having his happy memories fade away from him. Forever in the dark. Forever miserable.
"Hello Harry." She said in a very Luna Lovegood voice, soft, full of some kind of wonder, and sweet. "How have you been?"
As he got close to it, what ever it was, took a step forward, it's front right paw just resting in the sunlight. He recognized the paw. It was a lion. A huge lion from the looks to how big just it's paw was. He and the lion walked towards each other, carefully. Harry didn't want it to run, the lion seemed to look afraid. Funny for a lion to be afraid of him, he was tiny in comparison, and couldn't do much damage if he wanted to.
"I guess you never really had time to yourself, you never really had a normal teenage life. With parties and games and drinking." Draco gave a small laugh. "Who knew the Chosen One was a shut in." He joked, but he was right. Harry had never had a normal childhood, and his teenage years weren't much better.
"Fangirlling is not the same as liking someone as a person." Draco commented. "But you too unobservant to notice the difference anyway."
Harry walked off and realized that he hadn't really described Draco's lips when he was looking at his earlier. Harry only really noticed how nice they were. They looked soft, but Harry couldn't be too sure, seeing as he never touched Draco's lips. Visions of him touching them bombarded his mind and he blushed, he was glad no one was around to notice. Why was he thinking of Draco's lips anyway? And why did his stomach drop every time he did?
He knew soon that the time would come for him to go to classes, but the thought of doing anything caused him to panic. He wanted to stay and not do anything. He didn't want to have to pay attention to anyone. He wanted the day off. But Hermione would drag him to classes and Ron would tell him that the class wasn't that long, it wasn't that big of a deal. But it was. It was a huge deal that weighed on Harry like a ton of bricks.
"Oh. Uh... well... er... I have this map... of Hogwarts... that... well, er... shows everybody... in the castle. Where they are, what their doing... every minute of every day... So I opened it, and found your name... Then I was that there was a lot of people around you... So I went to see what was going on." Harry bit his lip, he had started blushing more.
"Hey Luna." Harry said as he walked into the greenhouse Luna was standing in. She was there to help Neville with some of his plants, and had only known she was there because he had over heard Neville mention it at lunch.
He felt Draco slide down to his left. But, unlike most times, he didn't stop the attack on his mind, he just softened it. Which was helpful, and Harry would have probably suffocated if he hadn't at next to him. The sun was lowering it's self behind the Forest. The golden glow making the trees seem like black spikes rising from even darker ground. Funny how sunsets were so beautiful, yet made such evil shadows.
Draco almost laughed. Potter had fallen asleep in the same room as him, Draco Malfoy. Draco's eyes scanned over Potter's face. He seemed so peaceful, young, hopeful. Like he wasn't broken beyond easy repair.
The question took him by surprise. At least Harry hadn't pressed the colour of his flowers. "At Madam Malkins'. We were being fitted." Draco said recalling the memory. He hadn't even know it was Harry Potter he was talking to. It must have seemed outright awful. But of course he had, he was awful.
He looked down at the blank page and started with basic lines. First where Potter would be on the page, then a very light sketch of the chair he sat in. The scratching filled his ears and he began to fully immerse himself into his drawing.
So he walked off the the kitchens and greeted the elves. He had learned a few of their names over the week.
Then footsteps approached him, and he was about to leave when he saw Perfect Potter come in and sit down in a chair by the fireplace, pulling his legs to his chest, and gazing into the fire.
"Really? In your sleep? Honestly, that would have been hilarious to see. You almost gave her a heart attack." Harry said giving a lop sided smile. Draco's heart suddenly gave a little flutter and Draco warned it.
Draco said down. Why had Harry thanked him? What had Draco done for him? All Draco had done was be a burden. A fragile object. A waste of time.
Because they were bloody Slytherins, and knew everything about him. They knew he was afraid. They knew he was weak. They knew how much he opposed his father. So they would ask him why.
So Draco sat in a abandoned broom closet and tried to stop himself from hyperventilating. He sat there for what seemed like forever, when he decided to go to class. He hadn't heard to bell to signal lunch was done, so he figured he'd be the first one there.
Draco didn't know why he was drawing Potter, but he was. It might have been because he hadn't talked to him, or maybe simply because he could.
"One can only hope." He smiled briefly. Who knows? Knowing how his life was written so far, she really could have.
To say Draco was very concerned would be an understatement. He had seen Harry during some bad times, but this, this was the worse. He could feel Harry’s pounding heart race as he clutched the front of Draco’s shirt. His breath was ragged and uneven, at times Draco wondered how he was getting air like that.
At the end of class he slowly put his stuff away, and was the last one in the classroom. Draco didn't want to go back to the common room, so he thought about going to the library. Then he felt someone touch his arm.
"I'm sure you could have come up with something." Harry shrugged and swung his legs over the side of the bed and reposition his glasses on his face.  He looked up at Draco again, as the boy sat his book on a near by desk. "Thank you." Harry told him softly, as is not wanting him to hear.
She was referring to the Weasley twins. Everyone knew of their pranks and jokes and tricks. He had heard they opened a shop, and everyone enjoyed it. Everyone always enjoyed the Twins. Even Draco had liked their Firework display 5th year.
He also started to think about today in potions, the silence they had both been fine with while working together. Harry was glad he had partnered with Malfoy, anyone else would have wanted to talk to him. Mostly about the war. Always the war. Did people not think of anything else now? Harry was really glad Malfoy hadn't wanted to talk about the war. Harry knew it probably had something to do with what Malfoy had gone through. Though he didn't know all of it, Harry knew there was more to Malfoy than what met the eye, even if it was buried under layers of ego and slurs. That was one of the reasons he had spoken in Draco Malfoy's defense at his trial.
Harry ate quickly, nearly inhaling all the food. Draco raised a amused eyebrow. It wasn't as bad as Crabbe or Goyle had been, but it was still a little bad. Draco nearly laughed as Harry finished while he was  still on his toast.
As they passed, Draco smirked, "Yeah, you should listen to your Mudblood," He almost physically flinched at the word, he had never liked saying it, but he was a Malfoy, "girlfriend. She's the only one that would stoop low enough to date you."
If Granger had just told him off, he wouldn't have complained, he doesn't deserve her forgiveness. But it would have sent him spiraling down again.
"No. I only went into your room and 'Accio'ed it. And I wouldn't invade on your drawings, I figured you wouldn't like that." Harry said softly. Draco didn't think he was lying.
Over the summer, he would look at his Mark for hours and hours on end, wishing it would disappear. But it didn't, and there was no known way to get rid of it.
"Really? The Savior of the Wizarding world didn't have fan girls just waiting to dance with you?" Draco said sarcastically.
"Nothing. It's stupid anyway." Harry answered quickly. For some reason, he didn't really want Draco to know about how much he appreciated Draco for staying with him. Before the blonde could press, Harry changed the subject. "I'm hungry," surprisingly, "is there any food?"
I originally posted this story on Wattpad, so if you see it there, don't worry, I just have a different pen name. I'm just transferring over so I'll be posted all the chapters I already have (24).
Draco started to wonder if Harry would come back at all. Harry had said a lot of things, things he probably wouldn't have said around Draco under any other circumstance. Harry probably didn't want to deal with Draco.
Now he was siting alone in the Hospital Wing. Harry had left, saying he needed to do something, and Madam Pomfrey had said he was to spend the night.
Draco had never let any one mess with his hair. But he trusted this unknown person more than he had trusted anyone he had ever known. He had even stopped allowing his mother to touch his hair.
He knew that all of them would be sharing classes, dorms, a table, and would not be able to play on their quidditch team. He hadn't cared enough to read why. It just meant he wouldn't have to do anything more than pass his classes and his N.E.W.Ts.
"How did you find me?" Draco said, though Harry couldn't see Draco's face, he figured there was a cautious look on his face, due to the way he asked.
"What if he doesn't want to talk and I just make things worse?" Harry said, he thought of his silent mornings, what would happen if he no longer had those?
Harry snorted and let out a small chuckle. Smiling pleasantly at Draco. Again Draco's heart leaped from inside his chest. Great. That was absolutely just lovely.
Harry saying his name gave him a similar feeling. "Hm?" Draco raised his eyebrows, trying to remember if Harry had said anything before.
"No. I was up there because I wanted to be. It just so happened that you came walking by. Not all my choices revolve around you." Draco said defensively.
But in Draco's mind, it was a fucking burden, it only caused harm, judging looks, and had stopped him from being himself. His last name kept him from having real friends, only minions. Kept him from doing the things that he loved like painting. Kept him from expressing any emotion that wasn't hate towards people. He kept him from being a good person.
Granted, he was expecting this kind of treatment, he was an ex-Death Eater, he had the Dark Mark. But this was juvenile.
He had coping mechanisms that helped to keep it from getting too bad, but during the last year, it had driven him over the ledge. Or at least the first ledge, one were he could almost climb up to where he had been before. It almost seemed to tease him... So close yet so far.
He sighed, that was probably the best he was going to get. So he made his way to the common room after getting dressed and getting his sketch pad.
Ron whipped around, wand pointing right at Draco's face, but Draco didn't move, with his eyes he silently dared Weasley to do it. Wanted Weasley to do it.
"It's just..." Harry said vaguely making a motion with his hands. "It's just weird. Usually when people call me the 'Chosen One' or the 'Golden Boy', I don't really like it. But when you say it, as if it was an offensive term, I don't mind as much." Harry said thoughtfully.
"Well," she stood up and took Ron's hand, pulling him away from his 3rd plate. He made a undignified noise, but stood up too. "Me and Ron are going to try and do homework in the library. We'll see you in the common room later." She walked of with Ron in tow. But Harry noticed the brief look she threw in Draco's direction.
"I remember that. There was a hexed bludger. It kept following your around. You had the worst luck when it came to quidditch. First your wild broom, then the bludger, then the dementors. Honestly, every year it was something trying to kill you." Draco said with a small smile. A genuine smile. Small, and covered in pain, but still genuine.
Harry enjoyed the feast more than he thought he would. Not that he ate a lot, just that it felt so normal, and he needed that. He watched as Ron stuffed his face, and Hermione chastised him for having no manners. That was normal, and it was good. He listened to laughter and the buzz of conversation, that was normal and good. All the little things, they made the feast enjoyable.
