Harry trailed his other hand down from Draco's arm to cup his buldge, rubbing and fondling the muscle through his trousers. Draco twitched. The pleasure shot through him, adrenaline following it. As much as he wished to hate it, Draco found himself grinding against Harry's palm. A shudder ran through him. A moan left his lips. His eyes closed.
Harry scoffed. "No, I think prat is more fitting to be honest." A smirk appeared on his face at Draco's scowl, a light chuckle passing his lips.
Hopefully, tomorrow will feel just as amazing.
Draco, Crabbe and Goyle just scoffed at his teary plea.
Harry stepped into the room, quickly making his way to the entrace, keeping his wand lit on the ground to watch where he stepped. The portraits in the corners of the room snored loudly, masking his feet on the bare, cold stone path. He stopped just behind the Fat Lady's portrait, taking the Map out of his armpit and whispering the words to lift the enchantment and scan the floors leading to his destination.
The journey was quick and easy, no one appearing or slowing Harry down, no Peeves in sight to alert his presence. Soon the door to the room was stood infront of him, a 'occupied' sign plastered along the front. Harry said the password, the door unlocking and opening as he pushed against the handle. It made a creaking noise, not loud in reality, but the night seemed to make everything sound louder than it really was. He quickly shut it behind him, heart racing in his chest and keeping an ear out for any sounds beyond the wood, nothing reporting back to him after seconds of waiting.
Something moved in his peripheral vision near the chaise sofa. He glanced away from the bed and caught eye contact with his company for the evening.
"That doesn't matter." A moment of silence passed over them. Draco took a breath and averted his eyes from Harry.
Harry could feel his legs moving but didn't register what he was doing. He just wanted something to let his pain out on and Draco was unintentionally volunteering. Harry tugged at Draco's wrist, dragging him off to a classroom not far from them, unlocking the door with his wand and yanking the door open.
Even though it had been a few days after their encounter, Draco couldn't stop thinking about it. It bothered him day and night. He was pissed at Harry for what he did. He had humiliated him. But he also had turned him on. That's what confused him the most. He hated Harry. Right? They were enemies. But what Harry did to him felt good. Amazing, even.
The sweat covering their skin began to dry up leaving their bodies red and hot. Draco flinched as he slipped off of Harry, falling back onto the floor with weak knees. He ran his fingers through his hair, feeling beads of sweat at the base of his neck. Draco looked over to Harry, watching as he buttoned up his shirt and shakily pulled on his pants and trousers, stuffing the hem of his shirt into the crookidly.
Harry pulled back looking over Draco's red, sweaty body, watching his chest rising.
Draco glanced at Harry before his body shuddered and strangled gasps left his lips. Harry slid his hand along Draco's needy shaft, lightly tracing it with his fingertips. His thumb brushed over the head, collecting the beads of pre-cum hanging there. The white substance helped to wet Harry's hand making it easier to glide up and down Draco's dick.
Not soon after, Harry grabbed Draco's back, holding him there as his seed emptied into his hole, filling him up and causing another moan to vibrate through him. His head dropped, landing on Draco's shoulder and resting there for a while, out of breath.
A Chaise sat infront of a towering, ornate fireplace: a crackling fire already burning inside making the room glow. A small table sat between the fireplace and the chaise, atop a hearth rug. Sofas and armchairs were spread amongst the room and in the corner sat a four poster bed, wide and untouched.
A loud moan fell from Draco lips as he slid down on Harry's cock. The new angle allowed Harry to bury deeper inside Draco's hole, hitting his prostate. His hands left Draco's sides and planted themselves onto his bum, securing him as he lifted Draco up and down on his dick.
Turning around, Harry grimaced at both of their faces. Both were cherry red and shaking with anger.
"Next time, we'll use the bed and mess up the sheets", he pulled back and looked down at the sofa, "Besides, I don't think this Chaise can handle us again anyway." He smirked.
"Don't be so cruel or I might have to punish you." Draco whispered, his lips close to Harry's ear. Harry's scent filled Draco's nose as he trailed wet kisses along the boy's neck.
Harry attacked his neck with wet kisses, sucking and biting on his skin leaving hickeys in a few places.
Draco groaned, "Look, I didn't come here just to be reprimanded, okay. So let's just drop the matter for now and do something more fun."
That was close! So very close! Curse that stupid cat!
The Great Hall was still full of students as he reached the doors and he spotted Hermione and Ron sitting near the middle of the Gryffindor table. He reached them both in no time and sat down, picking up a sandwich and an apple.
"I wanted to shut you up. You were being cocky and your ego was pissing me off, so I decided to do something about it for once." Harry admitted. He held his head up high.
A symphony of moans tumbled from Draco's lips as Harry sucked him, his hand pumping along the shaft for extra pleasure.
Picking up his Invisibility cloak, both boys huddled under it before beckoning the door open, poking their heads through the crack to look down the corridor, on the lookout for Filch.
"I'll see you around." Harry kept his back to Draco, making his way over to the door. He couldn't face him right now, he didn't want to. He was scared Draco would see him as weak if he saw the emotions he was trying so hard to suppress. It was best to just walk away and get back to Gryffindor Tower as soon as possible. Harry unlocked the door with a tap of his wand, leaving the classroom. Footsteps echoed behind him, Draco rushing after him.
The tips of his fingers brushed against Harry's cheek moving towards his jaw line then to his neck and finally reaching his collar bone. A shiver ran down Harry's spine, a hot flush crawling up his body. He gulped, hard.
"Oh, come on. Granger punched me in the face. I had to miss my first lesson thanks to her!" Draco huffed, defending himself.
"Yeah, We're clear. Let's just hope that Peeves doesn't see us. Otherwise, Flich will catch us in no time." They walked cautiously through the corridor, steps light on the stone. They reached the stairs, following them all the way down to the Dungeons.
"I have better things to do than follow you around. I'm on duty right now and I'm sure Professor Umbridge will be pleased I caught someone. Especially you." Draco boasted, smirking at Harry.
Both Ron and Hermione sat in silence, pushing the food around on their plate, not having much of an appetite. Harry kept an eye on both of them as he pulled the note out of his pocket, resting it on his lap under the table.
Hermione looked at unsure but nodded hesitantly.
Harry crept out of his bed, picking up his wand and keeping on his tip toes as he made his way to the end of the frame, kneeling down on the floor by his chest.
"Harry, what happened to your hand?" Draco had seen Harry punch the wall before he spoke to him in the corridor, but the marks on his hands couldn't just be from that alone. It was hard to make out where the open wound was as a big patch of dried blood covered a good portion of his hand. Harry yanked his wrist out of Draco's touch, keeping his head down as he walked over to the desk where he'd left his bookbag, throwing the strap over his shoulder. He glanced at his hand, wishing Draco hadn't noticed, reminding him of the pain he wished to forget.
Draco threw his head back onto the chaise: his mouth hanging open and his body twitching more and more. His hips bucked up in time with Harry's pumps bringing him closer with each thrust.
"Do you have to keep waking me every night?!" She yelled in a whisper.
"And don't try to deny it. I felt how hard you were." A chuckle escaped his lips.
This chapter contains sexual activity. Read at you're own risk.
"Let go of him now!" Hermione shouted, pointing her wand at Draco's neck. Draco looked at her in disgust while still holding onto the boy's collar.
"What? I didn't hear you." Harry's chest rumbled as he spoke. Draco scrunched his nose and fisted Harry's shirt in his hand.
Harry layed on the floor, panting and looked at Draco with half-lidded eyes. Draco smirked down at him, pleased with himself. Harry shakily moved onto his knees, unbuttoning Draco's shirt and pulling off his pants and underwear. His fingers brushed along Draco's torso, his palm pushing Draco down onto his back. Draco breathed in heavily as Harry poked at his entrance. His index finger slipped in, curling inside of him. It slipped back out before pumping back in repeatedly.
"A-Ah Draco.." Harry groaned as something dug into his crotch, feeling it slowly grind against him. Draco grinned at Harry's response as he continued to pushed against him, liking the mewls falling past his lips.
"Well, I don't blame her. You deserved it."
Their feet planted back on the ground after the last set of stairs leading to the Slytherin common room and dormitories. Getting as close as they could to the entrance, they looked around once more for any signs of disturbance in the dark before Draco slipped out from the cloak and looked back at Harry, his head peeking out from behind the invisible cloth.
Harry pulled his lips away, his breath hot as it fanned across Draco's face. Draco gasped as a firm hand palmed his dick. He arched his back. Harry nuzzled in the crook of Draco's neck, sucking and nipping at the flesh until it turned red raw. Moans fell past Draco's lips followed by shaky breaths.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Just hurry up and leave, I'm tired.", yawning as he finished his sentence.
He swallowed hard at the thought of getting caught, Filch would definitely have been ecstatic if he had caught Harry. He rubbed his eyes and puffed out his breath in relief. He made it.
A second passed before Harry's shoulders drooped, the tense muscles relaxing as a sigh escaped his lips. He pushed himself off the wall and slowly stepped out into the middle of the corridor, keeping his eyes on the corner Flich had left just incase he decided to turn back.
"Granger attacked me. I think she broke my nose." Draco spat while glaring hard at Hermione. Her cheeks flushed.
"Ah-Ahhh Harry,...more-Ah..." he choked out soon feeling another finger enter him.
One of Harry's hands gripped Draco's dick, covering it in his saliva and sweat before moving it to Draco's ass. Harry smeared the slick liquid over his entrance, coating the hole with the mixed fluids then pushing two fingers past the ring, stretching the tight hole. Draco's thighs twitched, reacting to the new sensation wracking his body. Harry sheathed his digits deep into his ass, dragging them back out and plunging them back in up to his knuckles.
"Well, since we're alone now, why don't I finish off what I started then." He whispered.
Draco tore his arm away from him.
Desperate to cum, Draco latched onto Harry's shoulders speeding up the process and bounced up and down on his cock. Harry, now desperate too, let Draco take the reins, sitting back and watching the blond squirm and shudder atop him.
Harry pushed his lips back on Draco's, swallowing the moans that he emitted. Draco jerked forward, thrusting his hips into Harry's hand eager to break the knot settling in his stomach.
Harry trailed his hands along Draco's sides, grazing his flesh with goosebumps. His hands slid down towards Draco's thighs which he hoisted over his shoulders, securing them in place before slipping his hands further down to Draco's hole.
Harry groaned in pain and anoyannce before looking up and meeting Draco's gaze. Draco towered over him, straddling his hips and smirking.
"Could-couldn't you have at least finished what you started? Instead of just walking off and leaving me to sort myself out? I felt like a fool running around the castle with a boner." Draco expressed, shaking his head as he added a light hearted joke at the end, trying to ease the awkwardness he was feeling. Draco eyes slowly shifted up to Harry's.
A bulge hit against Harry's knee and he smirked between the kiss. Harry licked Draco's bottom lip asking for entrance and reluctantly Draco let him access it. His tounge delved in exploring the inside of Draco's mouth. The kiss grew heated fast. Draco grabbed onto Harry's shirt and gripped it tight. His full attention was so focused on Harry that he didn't feel their feet moving until he slammed against the wall.
"What? You want me to look suspicious?" Draco argued, turning his attention back on the mirror. Harry grabbed his arm, dragging him over to the door, ignoring Draco's protests. Draco made an 'oof' sound once the cloak landed on his shoulders, the material heavy on him.
"Please-Please, let me cum!" Draco begged, irritation dripped from his voice. Harry smirked, rubbing his hand faster stimulating Draco's upcoming orgasm.
Draco crossed the remaining space between the two and he yanked on Harry's shirt collar pulling him in close to his face. He eyes bore deep into Harry's green ones.
Draco let Harry's ear go, keeping his lips nearby as he whispered, "We're not done yet." Harry didn't have time to process the words as he was roughly turned around, his chest sandwiched between the wall and Draco's own. Something swiped along his ass, something thicker than Draco's fingers. It pressed into his hole, circling the pinkness a few times, with teasing inserts. Harry's fingers grabbed the edge of the tub, slipping a few times, his knuckles turning white as he held himself up.
"Yes?" Harry responded.
The room brightened up as the door stood ajar, Harry's head poked out looking down the corridors for any type of movement. He walked further out the room and looked back just as Draco got to his feet. Draco peered down the corridor as he stepped out, turning to Harry once the door was closed.
Just as Draco was starting to lose himself against Harry's ministrations, Harry removed his lips and hands from Draco's body and stepped away. Draco lifted his eyes fogged with lust.
Draco twisted in Harry's grip, wiggling about to somehow pry him off but Harry bit down harder making Draco wince. Harry's knee grinded harder against him and a angry groan tore through him.
"Harry, you're being too rough, stop!" Draco frowned at Harry, grabbing his forearms, trying to get him to loosen his fingers from digging into his skin. Harry swatted his hands away, continuing to assault Draco's mouth.
"What do you want me to do now?" Draco whispered against his lips, his breath skimming Harry's puffy ones. Draco could feel him shudder, barely hearing the words he forced out.
And another.
"We didn't even use the bed." He commented, mumbling into Draco's shoulder.
"Very funny but lunch is nearly over. And I don't want to get caught with you by my side so I'll be leaving before anyone notices."
Harry began to move his hold from Draco's tie to his arms, digging his fingernails into Draco's shirt and forcing him against a desk. Draco peaked his eyes open, pain radiating in his lower back from the rough movement.
"What's wrong, Potter?", Draco breathed out, chuckling, "Can't move?". Harry looked up at Draco, rolling his eyes at his tauting.
"Do what?!" Harry grunted.
He was telling the truth and everyone was turning a blind eye. He was being tortured and suffering in silence as not to give satisfaction to that prissy, pink, slimy toad. Harry ripped his hands away from his hair and turned to the cold, brick wall slamming his fist into the stone over and over again. He let out a strangled cry, his fist scraping against the stone. Specks of blood stained the wall, his hand now red and raw as it laid limp by his side. His glasses fogged with the heat biting his face, frustrated tears threating to fall.
"Seriously!?" Harry walked back over to him, frowning.
"This has nothing to do with you, Mudblood. So, if I were you I would mind you're own business. I don't think any of the Professors would be lenient on you if you cursed another student." Draco spat.
Harry's pentup emotions took control over him the closer he came to his orgasm, his hips thrusting deeper and harder into Draco, focusing all his built-up tension on his body. Every frustration that had been tormenting him for the last few months: Umbridge, Lord Voldemort, The Ministry, his friends, Dumbledore, all of it, he was releasing all the anger through his ordeal with Draco. Harry's breathing became uncontrollable as his erection twitched, close to releasing. Draco's body was shivering, ready to explode as his second orgasm started to fall over the edge.
The stimulation was overwhelming his body, drowning him in immense pleasure. Before Harry could reach any sort of climax, Draco let up to purr in his ear, "Get on your knees."
He wanted to turn back and storm into her office, grab her by the throat and hex her into an oblivion, along with her rules and damned quill. He wanted everyone to finally realise he'd been telling the truth since last year, that Voldemort was back and killing people right this second. His veins pulsated violently, pure rage coursing through every part of him every time he thought back to the people who'd died at Voldemort's hands, people who were innocent. Harry's footsteps slammed heavily against the floor, echoing down the corridor, the torches lining the halls enhancing the frown pulling at his eyebrows. He tugged at his messy hair, digging his fingers into to his scalp pulling the roots. Questions overwhelming his brain.
"Well, your face is quite red and you look sweaty." She stated.
Warning!
"Ah-Fuc-Shit!" Ropes of semen shot out onto his open palm coating it in the sticky residue. He panted hard and took in shaky breaths. He bent over, leaning his head against the wall to rest.
Harry playfully rolled his eyes.
Harry watched Draco's every move, his body burning at his touch. Draco pulled down Harry's underwear, grasping his erection and licking the tip. Harry twitched in response and started to moan, throwing his head back before looking down. Draco swirled his tounge around the head and started to take Harry into his mouth. He bobbed his head up and down at a slow pace, a moan slipping past his lips. Becoming impatient, Harry started to thrust his hips up and down to quicken up the pace.
Every place Harry touched melted Draco's skin, sending a wildfire of pleasure spreading throughout his entire body. The knot in his belly was tighter than ever, now begging for release.
"What do we do now?" Harry whispered. They couldn't pass them without being heard, the walls echoed every sound made and would give then away in a second.
Harry removed his fingers, guiding his cock towards Draco's ass. His tip prodded at the hole, pushing in slightly at a time. Both boys moaned as Harry pushed in deeper, his hips grinding in Draco's. He stilled for a moment, his jaw clenching as he slowly pulled out and slammed back in.
Broken gasps bellowed from his lips as his hole was filled up, opening wider and wider as Harry's dick pushed deep into him, sucking him inside and squeezing the shaft as he tried to relax.
Warning!
"At least I don't panic if a drop of water falls on it." He watched Draco throw his head back in a snobbish manner, defending himself.
The Fat Lady sighed, glaring at him before asking for the password, which harry gave correctly, and opened up the portrait. Harry stepped through the hole catching snipits of the Fat Lady's mumblings under her breath.
Harry stood up from his chair, gathering his bookbag off the floor and swinging it over his shoulder, being mindful not to touch his bleeding hand too much. He picked up the piece of parchment he'd been writing on for the last hour and the quill he wished he could burn out of existence.
Time skip......
"Is it clear?" Draco whispered to Harry. Harry lit his wand and looked down at the Map, seeing Mister Flich on the Seventh floor, near the Tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy.
Then ten.
A massive whine echoed around the room as Draco came, holding himself still as he squirted his seed over Harry's  hand.
Harry began to open his mouth ready to answer when suddenly he turned his head away from Draco and looked down the corridor. A voice had caught his attention. It was becoming louder. Closer. Not thinking twice, Harry gripped Draco's arm and tugged him towards the Room of Requirement. The door closed behind them with a quiet click.
Looking around the room, he noticed its interior was different, not stacked with forgotten relics or junk. It was spacious.
"I'm supposed to be on corridor duty tonight, you know, for Umbridge." He started to play with his hair, brushing parts out of his face and tucking it behind his ear.
Harry read over the note twice, sliding it back into his trousers before anyone could notice. He looked back up at his friends, trying to encourage them to eat something.
His blond head disappeared around the corner, no longer in Harry's eyesight. A few minutes went by before his feet started moving, his steps slow as his knees wobbled. By the time he got to the staircase, his body seemed to move normally again making it easy to walk down the stairs without feeling like he would fall.
"Fuck." Draco groaned out his voice laced with lust.
"See you soon then, Potter." Draco smiled waiting for Harry's response.
Why was the place he called "home", the place he felt comfortable and happy, feel less and less like one as the days passed by?
For now, the fifth floor was empty, his main focus on Mrs Norris and Filch who were wondering the lower two floors. As long as they were out the way, his path should be clear. He untangled the cloak from under his arm, throwing it over his shoulders and covering his head with the hood. His whole body disappeared from view, blending in with his surroundings. Opening the door, he stepped out the frame, watching the Map closely for any change in the caretaker's patrol.
"Oh, and Mr Potter? Let's try to not end up in another detention so soon, hm?"
"No promises." Harry argued back, watching Draco open the door slowly. Draco checked the corridor for anyone lurking about but the coast was clear. Draco scoffed at Harry's statement and glanced one last time at Harry. Harry wiggled his eyebrows at him and winked.
"Stop-stop it! I need to cum-AH-ah!" Draco growled not enjoying being teased. Harry chuckled
With his Map at the ready, Harry opened the door, listening out for any sounds before closing it behind him, the occupied sign changing to unoccupied.
"Hermione, wait!" Ron called out following behind her, Harry rushing after them.
Harry's body shook, his knees spreading wider as Draco gripped his thighs. A twisting sensation pulled at his muscles, the feeling stronger in his abdomen. His hips buckled as that feeling tightened further, a long, drawn out moan caught in his throat. That coil split apart and Harry's body tensed as he came. Draco pumped him through his orgasm and pulled back, his lips moist and puffy.
They waddled along to the dungeons bumping into each other as they were squeezed into the tight cloak.
"I needed to get something from the common room. I have to do my Potions homework so I think I'll just skip lunch." Harry lied.
Harry kissed Draco once more, dragging his tounge over his lips, full of passion. Draco snaked his arms to the back of Harry's head and gripped his hair, pulling ever so slightly. Harry's hands made their way back to Draco's trousers, unbuckling his belt, and sliding the fabric down his legs. Draco moaned the moment Harry palmed his crotch through his underwear, his dick twitching continously. He bit his lip as Harry shoved his boxers out of the way, making direct contact with his shaft now. Harry listened to the sensual noises plauging Draco, licking and sucking his jaw and neck while he stroked him, egging his pleasure on. It sent a tingle throughout his body after every moan.
The temperature was warm and inviting, Harry couldn't help but let out a content sigh, slipping further into the water, his shoulders submerged beneath it. He sat down across from Draco, leaning against the wall of the bath, closing his eyes and enjoying the sensation of the warm water.
Why did no one believe him?
"Don't worry, I've got this." Draco responded with a smirk. Making sure Crabbe and Goyle couldn't see them, Draco took off the Invisibility cloak and walked around the corner clearing his throat before whisper-yelling, "CRABBE, GOYLE!". Both boys turned and looked at Draco.
Moonlight streamed in through the arched windows, cascading the ground in a puddle of white light. Students, teachers, ghosts and portraits slept soundly in the peaceful dark.
The figure trudged by the invisible boy, oblivious of his presence and continued his way along the corridor, a lamp in hand illuminating his shadow.
"What? Who's there? Hello?" Harry startled at the voice, turning to its direction, seeing the Fat Lady groggily looking about for the person who had disturbed her sleep. She yawned continously, squinting down before shutting her eyes against her will. Harry's paralysed body relaxed a moment later, the cold sweat that had covered him, thinking he had gotten caught, slowly dissipating as he watched her sleep, her head lolling from shoulder to shoulder.
Enjoy
"Come on, let's just go and eat already." Harry said wanting to change the atomsphere surrounding them. They huffed in response and begrudgingly followed Harry into the Great Hall.
There, outside the doors to the Great Hall, stood Draco and his goons Crabbe and Goyle. Next to them was a young boy from Gryffindor who was shaking, struggling to keep back his tears.
Harry continued sucking him, getting more confident in his actions. His lips picked up speed, his hand pumping faster and harder than before.
"See you tomorrow." Draco said with a smirk and winked at Harry before also descending the stairs too. The brick wall closed back up, hiding the Slytherin Common Room from sight. The hallway was quite now.
Harry glared up at him: his eyes heavy. Draco smirked back at his agitatation.
Harry's eyes darkened as Draco's smirk widened. His smug features fueled Harry's anger. Harry's jaw tensed and his fingers curled into fists at his sides.
Reaching the Entrace hall, they passed by the Great Hall down to the dungeons underneath the black lake.
The blond chuckled, scoffing at Harry.
Boiling with rage, Hermione lept towards them and whipped out her wand.
Draco grabbed the arm of the chaise clawing at the fabric as Harry began moving again. The dull sting of his ass being opened wide soon disappeared, a more pleasant feeling overtaking his senses.
Harry stood there, a small smile on his face, "Yeah. See you tomorrow."
"The other day. In the corridor. Why did you do that?!" Draco began to grow agitated.
Mrs Norris hissed at the impact, her voice bouncing of the walls and echoing throughout the hallway.
Snores from Ron shook the room, Harry trying his very best not to wake him and which, thankfully, he didn't.
Stalking through the common room, Harry tiptoed his way up the stairs to the boys dormitories, slowly pushing the door open to his room and closing it shut behind him.
A series of light footsteps tapped against the stone floor as they rushed down the corridors, the wind brushing against the invisible cloth hanging from their shoulders.
A hand pulled at Draco's neck, yanking him forward into Harry's body. Their lips collided together. Harry threaded his fingers through Draco's blonde locks while his other hand held onto his shirt.
Harry's hands wandered Draco's body, trailing down his hips to his cock and beginning to pump it, seeing the cum seeping out.
Harry's skin, once chilly from the cold hallway, started to warm up: a content sigh escaping his lips. He closed his eyes, breathing in the burning fire wood and relaxed into his seat. The chaise dipped beside him as Draco sank down next to him.
Draco went to respond however Harry quickly interrupted him.
Harry walked behind while Ron and Hermione were upfront, arguing over something that Harry was uninterested in. It was beginning to annoy him and before he had a chance to put an end to their bickering, the two had quietened down as they reached the Entrance Hall. New voices rose from infront of them gaining their attention.
Thrust!
Warning!
A sound which alerted the caretaker.
Continuing along the halls, Harry crept around each corner with caution, each step growing closer to his destination and closer to the boy awaiting him.
Harry picked up his wand, using a charm to speed up the drying process, letting him put back on his clothing faster. He ruffled his hair before grabbing his glasses, able to see the room better now. Draco came up next to him, using the same charm on himself with his own wand and quickly dressing back in his school robes. Harry raised an eyebrow, confused he didn't have his pajamas on.
"Wait until my father hears about this! He'll-" Harry cut Draco off again.
Harry spread his fingers wide inside of Draco creating scissoring motions as he pumped in and out at a steady pace, stretching his muscles. His fingers slipped deeper into him, curling them to graze his prostate.
Harry mirrored his glare before responing, "And it will be your arse next time if you don't shut up!", back at him.
It was definitely not big enough for two people anymore.
Harry glared at him. "What now, Malfoy? Following me again?" He grumbled, staring Draco in the eyes.
When Draco started to pump his length, Harry latched his teeth onto his collar bone, Draco flinching at the sharpness piercing his skin. Harry's breaths were heavy and short, his teeth releasing from Draco as he panted out, sweat beading his forehead. Soon after, Draco moved his finger in the same motion as his palm, pulling in and out of the tight hole, feeling Harry tense around him.
"Tell me! Now!" Draco folded his arms across his chest.
"Well, well Potter, decided to show up then? What were you doing? Dragging your feet along the floor? Keeping me waiting for 30 minutes on purpose?" His expression was stotic, his voice dripping in sarcasm as he watched Harry walk his way, reaching him and plopping onto the sofa near the burning fire.
"You should've seen the Hufflepuff girl we caught sneaking out. We promised not to snitch on her if she gave us five Galleons. Look 'ere, she payed up." A golden glint extended from Crabbe's hand, a proud smile on his face. Harry was struggling to resist from hexing them, annoyed when they started to insult the poor girl they had stolen from.
"We'll have to make this quick since we don't have much time." Draco whispered starting to move to Harry's pants, unbuckling his belt and pulling them down.
Draco could feel Harry's body trembling beneath his fingers, his grip latching onto Draco's shirt as if he was holding on for dear life. Draco didn't know what to do, he wasn't one to comfort someone when they were upset so he stood there, confused on how to make him feel better.
Professor Snape was cut off by a high-pitched twitter sounding from beside him. Professor Umbridge stood with her back straight, smiling up at everyone in her vision.
Harry closed his eyes, all anger leaving him, kissing back. Opened mouth kisses soon came into the mix, Draco diverting between his neck, collar bone and jaw. Harry let pleased moans slip past his lips, leaning into the pleasure wrecking his body. He looked back at him now, eyes hooded as Draco released his mouth from Harry's neck.
He stood up and leaned down to Draco pulling him into a rough kiss. A hand reached out, resting on Draco's back as he was pushed down upon the chaise, his body on full display.
"Miss Granger, seeing as you have attacked a student who is also a Prefect, you will be serving detention with me during every break for the remainder of term starting from tonight. Your Prefect duties will also be suspended." Professor Umbridge finished with a sickly sweet smile. Harry, Ron and Hermione clenched their jaws, trying their hardest not to retaliate. Harry wanted to argue with her so badly but he needed to control his anger so, begrudgingly, he kept quiet. He couldn't have another detention so soon.
Draco smirked and pushed himself off the tub, swimming over to Harry. Getting closer, Draco stopped just before him, a surprised gasp leaving Harry's mouth as a ton of water washed over him, Draco's laughter echoing in the room.
"The Room of Requirement. It appears to people who need it most. Although the room changes depending on the person's needs." Harry answered.
"Draco?" Harry whispered looking around the room to find the Blond male. Harry walked past a block of stalls and finally came across the huge, swimming pool like bathtub where he found the male he was looking for. A few torches were lit along the ceiling, a nice warm glow to the room.
"You better watch that mouth of yours unless you want to be reported to Professor Umbridge. I hear she gives brutal punishments. And I won't hesitate to get you in trouble just to see you get put in your place." His knuckles had turned white as he continued to grip Harry's collar.
"Harry, I told you to stop!" He managed to hold Harry's arms away from his lower half, glaring down at him when he fought back. "Harry! Stop!"
"Easy? You call that easy? It took me nearly all night to finish it. Are you sure you did the right homework?" Ron said sounding confused at how quick it took Harry to finish it.
"Ok, if you're sure." She gave a questionable look before slowly walking away with Ron following behind.
His feet shifted as he pivoted on the spot, a few steps away from the wall which hid the Room of Requirement. However, he failed to realise the small feline that had crawled up to him, unnoticed, and sat by his feet as he was distracted. Before he knew it, he had tripped over the cat and tumbled to the floor, his cloak sprawled out atop his body.
Harry bent his head, nibbling on Draco's nipples, his tounge swirling and sucking on them. Draco's eyes teared up as he brought a hand to cover his mouth, his spit falling passed his chin. The sensation was overwhelming his body, his insides felt like liquid fire. That tight knot pulled so hard Draco thought he would shatter into pieces once it finally snapped. And he was close to breaking when it finally did. His body tensed, squeezing Harry's cock hard as he shot out ropes of cum between their bodies.
"Lumos." His wand lit up seconds later, shining about the room to check he was the only one conscious, turning back once he confirmed everyone was still asleep. Hovering over his trunk, he bent down to open it, shuffling through the scattered clothing for his Invisibility cloak and the Marudars Map. Each item was strewn under a pile of dirty clothing, Harry tossing them to the side as he pulled them out and tucked them under his arm along with his wand. Slowly, he closed the lid to the trunk, keeping his fingers on the hatch until it was fully shut, not wanting to make any noise and risk being seen. When he stood back up, he used his wand to cautiously check his roomates once more, all still tucked away in their beds. Holding his breath, he turned around to inch towards the door, unlocking it with a simple, "Alohomora", taking his time to close it just as he did with his trunk. He breathed out a quiet sigh of relief once he stood on the other side of the threshold, one hurdle complete.
Hermione glared, seething and began to lower her wand. Ron came up from behind Hermione and glared at Draco aswell. Harry stood behind and watched as Crabbe and Goyle began searching the boy.
"Aww, was baby Potter scared?" His voice rose an octave higher as he spoke in a childish tone.
As Draco pushed up from the desk, Harry began to re-dress his boxers and trousers, fiddling with the belt. Draco shakily got to his feet, still clutching the desk as support as he bent down, retrieving his discarded clothing. He began to pull the top around his elbows up his chest, buttoning up the front but leaving a few open to allow the cold air to cool down his sweaty body. Draco watched Harry unceremoniously tuck the edge of his shirt back into his trousers, straighten his tie and collar. Draco frowned when he noticed the blots of red sticking to Harry's skin. It seemed to bother Harry as he dressed himself, tiny hisses leaving his throat whenever he brushed the inflamed area. Draco grabbed Harry's wrist, surprising the Gryffindor boy, inspecting the mark as best as he could with the light shining in through the windows.
The voices from the stairs so faded away before the corridor was completely quiet. Harry leaned against the wall, tapping his foot impatiently, glancing up and down to checked the floor was empty. Everyone seemed to have vacated the corridors, all piled in the Great Hall.
"What's the rush, Potter? Leaving me already? I'm hurt." Draco teased, putting a hand over his heart in mock hurt.
Harry slowly inched his way closer to the wall, his back colliding with the solid concrete as he tried to make himself as small as possible. One of his hands clutched onto the fabric of the cloak, tugging it closer to his body leaving no skin visible. His eyes remained fixed on Filch until he disappeared from sight: the light disappearing with him and once again shrouding him in darkness.
"You're one to talk, I don't see you jumping up and down right now." Draco let out a scoff, letting go of the wall and swimming backwards into the middle of the tub to prove him wrong.
"Pl-Please, stop. I-I-I don't have any money on me, really." The boy stuttered out.
"Well, well. If it isn't Scarhead. What are you doing out here, Potter? Shouldn't you be in the hall with Granger and Weasel? Or have they finally had enough of you and run off together?" Draco taunted, stopping Harry down the corridor.
"Hol-hold-..ahhhh..fuuck..- on, Draco..." Harry cautioned.
The water settled around them, Draco holding onto Harry as they caught their breaths, the hot water flushing their faces. The room had become hotter than before, leaving their skin covered in a sheen of sweat, sticking to their hair. Draco pulled out of Harry, turning him enough to see his red face. Harry rested back against the wall, feeling heavy and sore. Draco blocked his body from escaping, both his arms holding him up on the wall behind Harry's head, steadying him.
Taking off his Invisibility cloak, he rolled it up and placed it back into his trunk, closing in and climbing onto his bed. He pulled back the covers setting himself into a comfortable position. He slid his glasses off his nose and placed them upon his night stand, rolling over and plopping his head against the pillow entirely worn out. His eyes shut and within seconds he was fast asleep.
Draco pushed his hands up Harry's shirt, swiping his thumbs over the perked flesh and skimming his abdomen. The small moans emitting from Harry's lips were soon silenced as Draco brought his face up to level, pushing his mouth firmly upon the boy's own.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, "I know. I'm sorry. I won't trouble you again." She slowly opened the portrait and Harry stepped through.
Harry unfurled his fists and grabbed Draco's arm clutching his shirt. Draco raised an eyebrow before gasping out a breath in surprise as he was slammed against the hard brick wall. Harry held Draco's arms against the wall and positioned his knee between Draco's legs.
Draco dunked his head back under the water, the little horns falling limp back onto his head. He washed himself just like Harry, swimming over to him once he was done. Harry pushed himself up onto the wall, getting out of the water and into the freezing air. His arms wrapped around himself as he went over to the same counter that held his stuff, two fluffy towel set out beside them. He heard the water shift behind him, Draco grabbing the remaining towel and drying his body. With the towel wrapped around Draco's hips, he walked over to the tub, releasing the plug and draining the dirty water.
"Why're you still in your uniform?" Draco finished tying his green tie, looking himself over in the mirror, checking for any creases in his clothing.
"Malfoy? Are you done patrolling already?" Goyle asked, confused at how quick Draco had returned to the Dungeons.
"Really? You style it? It looks like you just woke up." Harry said, glad he'd got back at him.
"And that's how you chose to handle the situation?! What the hell is wrong with you?!" Draco seethed. His jaw ticked.
Sitting in the pink bubbly water was Draco, with his arms spread out and resting on the side of the tub.
Harry stood up, his knees wobbly as he got to his feet. He fixed his tie as best as he could before stepping over Draco's body to the door. Draco tried to purposely trip him over for his own amusement however failed, leaving him pouting up at Harry.
"I'm gonna put it in." Harry huffed, prodding the hole with the tip as Draco squirmed under him. The blond nodded bracing himself for the impact.
"Harry, wait!" The said boy ignored Draco's plea, picking up his pace as he rushed off to the stairs leading to the Seventh floor. Draco didn't run after him knowing Harry wouldn't stop. It was best to just leave him for now, even if he was concerned with his behaviour. He decided to head to the nearest bathroom and check his appearance before heading back to the Slytherin common room.
"So sorry to have kept you waiting, your Highness, but I almost got caught at the last minute. I'm lucky I even made it in here." Harry responded, sarcasm also present in his voice, mimicking Draco.
Turning around the last corner, his feet jolted to a stop; his body freezing in place as the looming figure grew near. His breath hitched in his throat and sweat began to slip down his brow, the blood in his veins rushing to his ears as his heart thumped in his chest.
"Well, let's get back now before anyone comes looking for you." Harry grabbed his cloak, throwing it over his shoulders and opening the Map back up, whispering the secret words to it. He reached the door ready to open it, only turning around when Draco hadn't come over yet. Harry deapanned, Draco still playing with his hair meticulously.
"What do you think you're doing?! Get off me now-Ah!" Draco began to protest but Harry's teeth biting down had cut his sentence short. A groan had slipped through his lips instead. Draco's body began to heat up, a blush forming along his cheeks and neck and his blood rushing through his veins. His pants began to tighten.
Draco ripped his head from Harry's shoulder and looked at him.
"Yeah, it was easy so I didn't need as much time as I thought." Harry breathed.
Draco walked past Ron and Hermione, smirking at them with Crabbe and Goyle shuffling close by. Draco stared at Harry for a spilt second before shoving past him. A crumpled piece of parchment manifested into Harry's pocket as Draco's arm brushed past him. Harry looked down at the note before meeting Draco's eye once more, seeing a wink sent his way. A ghost of a smile pulled at Harry's lips, unnoticed by his friends.
Then two.
A few more pumps later, Draco's body convulsed in pure bliss as his orgasm hit him, sending shots of cum to the back of Harry's mouth. Harry closed his eyes as the liquid dribbled down his throat, a salty taste mixing with his saliva. He pulled his lips away from Draco's dick, slightly coughing, and looked up to see Draco's lidded eyes glancing at him, his face completely red.
Harry watched them leave until they were out of sight before heading towards the 7th floor. Pushing past students on the stairs and corridors was a hassle but soon enough Harry was stood outside the broom closet, just like the note said.
He unbuckled his belt followed by his trousers and pushed them down, pooling around his ankles. He tugged at the hem of his boxers and slid them down joining the clothing at his feet.
As the minutes passed, Harry no longer lent on the wall and was now opening the closet, looking around at the tiny space. A few brooms layed against the far corner, dust littering the floor. It wasn't much to look at compared to the Room of Requirement, but it would have to do for now. A screeching noise echoed from down the hallway. Harry frowned, spinning around and letting out a yell when a body slammed into his, trapping him in the closet. The door locking behind them.
Draco continued to pump in and out, beginning to reach his limit, clenching his teeth as he pushed in a few more times. Draco's arms tightened aground Harry's middle, his body stilling and shooting ropes of cum into him. Harry could feel each shot, his ass feeling full and warm from evey slap of Draco's hips.
Warning!
Draco looked up at him, a smirk toying at his lips. He chuckled at Harry's sly response.
Harry let out a light scoff. His shoes clicked along the stone floor as he glided over to Draco. He stopped a few centimetres away from his body.
"The only one who needs to be put in their place is you, Malfoy."
Harry scooped Draco up by his hips and hungrily kissed his lips, growling into his mouth. He kissed his jaw and neck, feeling his adam's apple bob up and down. Harry glanced over Draco's body noting his perked nipples rubbing against his chest. Harry lifted Draco's body higher onto his lap, sending him deeper onto his cock. Draco dribbled as his mouth hung open, a similar knot tugging at his abdomen.
"I want you to touch me," he breathed out starting to remove his clothing, "with your hands and your mouth." His dick stood tall as he finished removing his clothes: the head was flushed pink, precum occupying the tip.
"I suggest you head to the Hospital Wing before another fight breaks out." Not waiting for a response,  he left the group of students standing in the Hall, his cloak billowing behind him.
The common room was dimly lit, quiet. Easy for Harry to return to his dormitory without being questioned and stared at once he walked in. He crept up the stairs, trying his best to sneak into his room without waking anyone. The door gave way, a tiny creak as he closed it behind him. The boys in the room were asleep, Ron snores filling the silence. Harry kept his eyes on them as he walked over to his bed. He placed his bookbag down, throwing himself onto the mattress in complete exhaustion. He couldn't be bothered to clean himself nor his hurt hand, placing his glasses down on the bedside table, rolling over and tugging the covers up to his neck. He was spent for the day, his eyes drooping the second he rested his head on the pillow. He hoped sleep would come easy tonight, just so he could rest after everything that had happened today, even if it was for just one night.
His dick stood high and stiff, the tip red and puffy.
Harry shook his head, chuckling at his remark. His chuckle turned to a sharp gasp as another wave of water crashed over him, soaking his already sweaty body once more. He turned to Draco, outraged.
Draco clenched his teeth. The urge to hit Harry was growing. He knew he couldn't tell anyone, his reputation would crumble if he did. Harry smirked knowing he was right. But he'd be damned if he was gunna put up with Harry's bullshit. Draco growled at him. His lips parted.
"What the hell!!" Harry shouted as Draco snickered at his drenched face, his eyes covered by his wet, dripping hair. Draco grabbed Harry's waist and pulled him closer, pushing back Harry's hair and using his free hand to tilt Harry's chin, a devious smirk plastered on his face.
"Draco, wait. Let me catch my breath." Harry rasped, still calming down from the previous assult on his body.

His body collapsed back against the wall, his knees buckled. His heart continued racing, pounding against his ribcage. He tried to even out his breathing.
Draco shook his head, slowly beginning to place his hands on Harry's shoulders pushing him down, trapping him underneath his arms.
The Fat Lady glared at Harry but sighed and said, "You're the one that left earlier then, I presume? You're lucky I don't report this to Professor Mcgonagall."
A passionate kiss blossomed between them, tounges fighting for dominance. A lack of air seperated them, their breaths heavy and faces flushed red. Not a second later their lips were again upon each other, Draco roughly nipping on his lower lip.
"Ow!- Watch it, Potter! That was my foot!" Draco whispered, glaring at the boy.
It was pretty boring to be honest. It was quiet and the only interaction Draco had had was with Peeves. And that was harrowing enough.
"'Your Highness'", Draco repeated along his tounge, his minty breath cascading over Harry's face, "I quite like that, I think it suits me pretty well, don't you agree?" He purred, stroking his thumb across Harry's chin.
The moment Harry released inside Draco, his anger dispersed, pleasure consuming him as ropes of cum shot up into Draco's ass, milking his insides. Draco shivered at the sticky liquid filling him up, his ass tensing around Harry's cock. Draco gasped when he removed his hand, his breaths shallow as he gulped down air he struggled to breath. His cheeks were tinted red, sweat beading his hairline, slipping down his forehead. Harry mirrored his appearance, just as messy as Draco was. However, unlike Harry, Draco was still in need of release, his body shaking as he reached a hand out to try and relive the throbbing in his cock. Harry layed his own hand over Draco's, helping him rub the shaft in a fast pace, doubling the friction. Cum shot out of his tip, coating their hands in the white substance, Draco moaning as he continued to rub through his orgasm. His chest heaved, his hand clutching the table once more as he held himself still, trying to cool down. Harry slipped out of Draco with a wet pop, using the edge of his shirt to wipe his dick and hands free from the leftover liquids as best he could.
"No. It's fine. I just want to hurry up and get it done. If I finish early then I will meet you in the Great Hall." Harry rushed out.
"Shut up. I'm not happy with you after what happened earlier." Harry looked at him, dead serious.
"See you tomorrow." Harry stated as Draco began to close the door.
Harry played innocent, whistling as his eyes looked anywhere but the blond boy opposite him. Draco smirked, chuckling at the facade Harry was trying to use.
"Why were you running?" Ron gaped, out of breath.
They passed hallways smoothly until they reached the stairs and carefully descended them at a slow rate: not wanting to alert anyone of their presence.
Hands wove through Harry's hair tugging at it whenever Draco twitched. Harry pushed his mouth further down onto Draco's dick stopping once he could not take any more of it in. Draco held Harry's head in a tight grip, helping him to manoeuvre his throat.
Draco struggled to let out a gasp as Harry thrusted into him again and again, his hips rocking back and forth to meet Harry's hips. Draco latched onto Harry's partially opened shirt, his sweaty hands damping the fabric.
"You should probably take care of that. I suggest you go to the nearest toilets. Dinner is almost over." Harry smirked at him in satisfaction. He turned around and walked off towards the Great Hall.
"Why'd you ask?"
As his lips pressed against Draco's neck he could feel the vibrations of the moans Draco was emitting. His tounge played with Draco's adam's apple, swirling and nipping at it leaving the blond breathless.
Hesitantly, he turned away from the wooden doors, and travelled down the remaining hallway to the stairs. He stopped just before he turned the corner, looking back at the wall that once held the oak doors. He shook his head and rolled his eyes, amused. Tonight had been very unexpected, but Draco enjoyed it. Every bit of it. He thought of the way Harry had touched him, how amazing it felt.
"That's it for today, Mr Potter. Hopefully the message has sunken in enough for you to have learned your lesson. Wouldn't you say so?"
"Touch me."
Draco's hair hung in limp strands about his face, damp with his sweat. Saliva pooled from his lips as his mouth hung open in bliss, his orgasm beginning to take affect as Harry sped his pace, scissoring his hole and sucking his dick at the same time. Draco's grip on Harry's hair tighten to the point he nearly ripped some strands out, gasping when the balloon inside him popped with a shuddering explosion. Harry removed his fingers but kept his mouth still as Draco pumped his cum down his throat, Harry trying his hardest not to choke on the fluid. Draco's chest heaved, his head hanging limp as he stared down at Harry, watching him swallowing around his cock.
"Well, it was better than having a duel. Why are you so angry about it? If I remember correctly, you seemed to have enjoyed it."
"Very good. Well then, you are free to return to your dormitory." Umbridge finally made a move back to her desk, giving Harry space to breath without her staring at the back of his head constantly.
"Shut up!" Harry's voice left the room in silence, his body halting in the process as he tried to regain his breaths. Harry glared at him before letting his voice drop back to a normal level. However, the pain and anger emanating from him never left. Harry grabbed Draco's arms and balled the material of his shirt in his fists, mumbling. "Please, just shut up." Harry's plea was broken, his voice cutting off as he swallowed the sore lump burning in his throat. He looked Draco in the eyes, the pain that he was trying so hard to not let slip breaching the surface.
"HEY! YOU RUINED MY HAIR! DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO STYLE IT?." Draco yelled, slicking his hair back behind his ears.
Umbridge's sickly sweet voice made Harry's blood boil, her words even more so. She stood up from her desk, her heeled shoes slapping against the stone floor, making herself comfortable next to him, a disgusting sneer adorning her face.
"Harry, What's going on-!"
"What!" The word came out harsher than intended.
"I'm guessing you finished your Potions homework?" Hermione asked, watching him.
"Yeah, nothing interesting happened so I'm done for tonight. What about you two?" Draco asked.
"Basilisk." Goyle said watching as the brick wall opened, revealing the passageway to the common room. Goyle and Crabbe stepped through making their way in and Draco waited behind, watching them descend the stairs. Making sure they were out of earshot, Draco turned to face the corner where Harry was and whispered, "Potter." Harry took the Invisibility cloak off his head and looked at Draco.
A snarl let loose from Draco's mouth. He was right. Draco did enjoy it. His mind was telling him he hated it but his body was eager to do it again.
"Well, what are you waiting for? You're not going to leave me in this bath all alone, are you?" Draco said while smirking. Harry rolled his eyes before setting down his wand, whispering "Nox" to shut off the light. Shrugging off the cloak, he threw it to the counter lining the wall, his glasses and map following suit. He began to strip off his top, his trousers and undergarments, watching as the pooled by his feet. Draco's eyes followed him as he walked to the edge of the tub, each foot sinking into the water, the bubbles swirling round his feet as he stepped in.
"What was that? I couldn't hear you." Harry could sense the amusement in his tone, growling out his words louder this time, not wanting to repeat himself.
"Looks like someone wasn't telling the truth. Did your mother not teach you honesty? I'm not surprised that that Mudblo-!" Draco stumbled back, surprised as a fist made contact with his face. Draco let go of the crying boy, now holding his nose. The boy ran off, heading in the opposite direction of the Great Hall. Crabbe and Goyle looked at Draco in shock. Hermione craddled her now red fist against her chest, heaving in anger. Draco glared down at her before motioning for Crabbe and Goyle to do something. The said boys reacted and took out their wands, ready for a fight. Ron and Harry mirrored their stance.
Harry's lip twitched and his eyebrows knitted together. "Says the one who only has snobs as 'friends'. If you weren't a Malfoy they wouldn't even bat an eyelash your way. I'm pretty sure your father pays them just to talk to you." Harry responded.
"That's not fair. Malfoy was asking for it. He was bullying another student and abusing his Prefect status. He should be punished aswell for being an asshole". Ron yelled. Professor Umbridge looked at him, her smile wavering slightly before she spoke.
Harry slowly trudged his way through the common room, tiptoeing up the stairs to his shared room. The door, slowly gave way, Harry trying to keep as quiet as possible. He peaked at each of the sleeping figures, no one had moved since he left earlier, except Ron's snoring had gotten louder. Harry reached his bed and slipped off the Invisibility cloak, tucking it back into his truck with the map. He sat down on his bed and placed his wand down on the bedside table along with his glasses. He slipped back under the covers, rolling over and getting comfortable. His eyes started to droop and eventually he lulled to sleep.
Harry dragged his knee against Draco's groin, gradually applying pressure, bobbing it up and down. He leaned in close, his body pressed against Draco's. Harry tilted his head skimming Draco's neck with his teeth.
Harry paused when Umbridge spoke for the last time, gripping the handle with such force he could feel the hinges tremble on the frame. She was lying. Trying to get under his skin. She wanted to give him as many detentions as possible so he'd stop spreading his "lies" he'd been telling everyone for months. He swallowed a lump in his throat, responding to her.
Harry removed the cloak from his head and said the password, "Mimbulus mimbletonia."
"You bastar-!" Harry smashed his lips against Draco's, bruising them with the force. Harry moved a hand to grip Draco's jaw holding him in place. Draco tried to pull away but surprisingly Harry had a tight hold. Draco's trousers buldged around his firm dick, tighting as it pulsed.
Why did everyone hate him?
"Why did you do it?" Draco found himself asking.
Professor Umbridge had hired a few students (Slytherins) to help keep surveillance at night for any rule breakers and each student would earn house points for their cooperation. Draco was surveilling the 7th floor tonight.
The hood to the cloak slipped from his head, his dishevelled hair poking out in an array of angles. His glasses started to steam up from the humidity stifling within the room, water trickling filling his ears.
"I am terribly sorry to interrupt this conversation however, seeing as I am the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, I believe it is my job to punish the perpetrators." Everyone was silent. Draco looked back at Hermione and Ron, smirking

Harry dipped down to Draco, smothering his mouth with his own, swallowing the moans shared between them. He let up, staying slightly above Draco and continued to pound into him, watching his face contort in ecstacy, barely able to keep his eyes open.
