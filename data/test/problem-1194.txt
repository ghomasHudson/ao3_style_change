Kieran grabbed the tray from the table next to his side of the bed. “Bon Appétit.” He teased in a ridiculous French accent. He was sure Bellatrix’s Mother, Druella, would have taken serious offence to his pronunciation but he was trying to entertain the child He sat the tray down in front of Harry. “What would you like to drink with it? I can get you orange juice, apple juice, pumpkin juice, tea, butterbeer, water, or if there is a soda you can remember.” He usually didn’t condone soda but figured one glass of soda wasn’t going harm him.
“I’d like to just sleep.” Harry muttered it been far to long that he had been able to sleep in an actual bed, even though it wasn’t really a bed per say. It was still more comfortable than the crib mattress that he slept on in the cupboard. “I give permission for Kieran to talk about me.”
Harry snickered softly at Ron’s little lecture. “Sorry I got home from St. Mungo’s later than expected, Andy wanted to have a talk, and then Teddy wanted to watch Lilo and Stitch for the thousandth time, only for him to fall asleep during it. Now come on otherwise we will be late, and you know how Hermione gets when we are late. I feel a little sore, but it’s nothing I can’t manage.” If he were being quite honest he had dealt with far worse than tender ribs.
“Hello kiddo.” Kieran said softly in his thick Irish accent seeing bright emerald eyes staring at him.
“Hello darling.” She greeted handing him the glass of wine and gave him a tight hug. Their relationship was exponentially better now that Lucius was dead, was it sick that she was grateful that he decided to hang himself in Azkaban, did she care, not in the slightest. She and Draco were so much better off without him. “Long day, you look tired.” She kissed his cheek softly.
Kieran groaned internally he hated child abuse cases especially these types of child abuse cases where the parent was so against the idea of magic that they took to abuse to get the child to fall in line.
Neville laughed and reached for Hermione’s hand. “Ron, she doesn’t have a Dark Mark, but that’s actually a really good idea to charm your wedding ring.” He teased. “So, a Russian?” Neville questioned, he was a bit taken aback that Harry had a date it seemed like the past year he seemed more interesting in raising Teddy than dating, not that there was anything wrong with that, it just seemed a bit strange.
Harry was stunned at Draco’s admission that he was a muggle doctor. “So, that’s why nobody knew where you were, you were in America getting your N.E.W.T.S. several wondered why you didn’t come back to finish them at Hogwarts. So, what was Ilvormorny like?” He asked wondering if it was like Hogwarts. “So how are your Slytherin friends.”
Regulus grabbed his wand and the Panther sprouted from his wand to alert Burke of the sudden development. He looked around the room and noticed a lack of dragon and blanket. “Kieran, did you and Bellatrix not provide him a blanket before you left?” He questioned getting down on his hands and knees and looking under the bed trying to find the plush. “The dragon I gave him is also missing.” Regulus muttered.
“Good, I’ll come see you tomorrow morning and we can figure it out then. Right now, I’m busy.” Adrien said disappearing behind the swinging glass door. Glad that he had chosen Neuro. He never understood how the other Healers could get wrapped in patients’ lives.
Kieran could feel her magic threating to boil over and grabbed her and pulled her into his arms before she could break something. He figured Regulus wouldn’t enjoy coming back to finding his office a mess or find something of importance broken because of Bellatrix’s magic.
He could see that the wrist in question had been broken seven times already mostly in the same spot along the proximal carpals and into the distal radius. It was a wonder with all the breaks that hadn’t healed properly that the child was able to even use that wrist. He was going to have to rebreak several of the carpal bones again in order to properly heal them due to improper healing. It was another check in the child abuse column that the child had never received medical care.
Harry sighed knowing Vernon would complain about bills the moment he had the mail in his hand. He finished drying the last of Petunia’s good plates and got off the stool he was standing on. He placed it back in the pantry and made his way to the mailbox. He opened the mailbox hearing the usual creak as it opened. He grabbed the stack of mail most of which was probably bills; but there was a letter addressed to him at the top of the stack.
Harry laughed softly wanting to ask if Draco even had a heart, but didn’t since after yesterday it was obvious that Draco did have a heart. “Two houses, what is the sorting like there?”
“The fact that you saw his abs pretty much confirms that you were his Healer.” Narcissa raised her wine glass to her lips and took a small sip watching her son. “That’s a very Slytherin tactic, so what’d he have to say to your invitation for drinks?” She questioned.
“With who?” Hermione questioned noticing that a couple other Ministry employees turned their heads to glare at the suddenly loudness in her voice.
“Shit is going to go down if Andromeda looped Vivienne into the case of Harry.” Regulus joked. He had worked with Vivienne several times before and the Scottish wife of Thomas Riddle terrified him. They might have both been Slytherin’s, but the way Vivienne held herself was enough to make any grown man quiver in fear. She was ruthless when it came to child abuse cases and knew she was just the women to help Harry. He personally thought she would have a made a fantastic barrister.
“Because mother you should meet our boss, he has no sense of personal boundaries.” Ron said coming out of the kitchen a piece of bacon hanging out of his mouth. “Are you feeling better today?” Ron asked giving him friend a worried expression. “You never did call me last night like I asked you to do. I was worried sick about you, mate.”
Kieran nodded his head sadly when Adrien mentioned abuse. “I was hoping for tomorrow actually. I figured it is best to let him rest today.”
“Oh, hello dears. I didn’t notice you there.” Minerva said sounding slightly embarrassed. “How are Elara and Rigel? Is Elara getting excited for her first year at Hogwarts?” She asked the two trying to be polite and not let her rage towards Dumbledore get the better of her.
Kieran scribbled a note in the margin of the parchment about the abuse. He picked up his wand and moved his scan down to the neck and torso. The quill scribbling all the previous injuries just as rapidly as it did with the head. He grabbed the parchment once the quill dropped to the table and saw several other previous injuries. Harry had several prior neck sprains, broken his collarbone a few times, had a mangled Rotator Cuff. Several broken ribs: it looked like he had broken every single rib at least once in his small life. The child also had lung insufficiency due to respiratory infections like the Flu, Pneumonia, RSV, and Bronchitis. His internal organs also showed several bruises or contusions. What alarmed him the most was the fact was that Harry’s liver was severally damaged. He handed the two pieces of parchment over to Bellatrix to place into Harry’s file.
Harry had learned about age two to hide the tattoo because if he didn’t it just made Vernon incredibly angry and when he saw the tattoo it just made the abuse that much worse. He finished drying the plate in his hand when he heard Vernon’s voice from the living room. “Where the fuck is that freak?”
Thank you all for reading and still liking my stories regardless of their update history. It really means the world to me.
He opened the door to his office and tossed the balled-up note into the trash bin and set in on fire and watched the note burn. He grabbed his wand from the holster attached to his belt and pointed his wand at the small fire in the trash bin. “Aguamenti.” He watched the jet of water douse the fire. He placed his wand back into the holster.
“I am being dragged to Alton Towers tomorrow, so it couldn’t be tomorrow, what time are you off the day after tomorrow, I think it’s a Wednesday?” He suggested figuring he’d be off the rest of the week due to his suspension.
“Sure, can we just go a little later I’m afraid I might wake up with a hangover.” Harry commented not wanting to wake up hungover.
“I didn’t peg Neville for an Auror, I can see Ron being an Auror. I also never saw you become an Auror, yet here you are.” Draco muttered silently. “So, are Ron and Hermione still dating?” He asked wondering what was new with Harry’s friends. It seemed like a safe enough topic to talk about.
Harry sent a glace to Ron and Neville. “Well sir, it almost seemed like Yaxley was onto us from the start. Ron was the first one in the door and Neville and I followed, only to find out Yaxley was ready for us and already had Ron magically tied to a chair. I got hit with a Cruciatus and several blasters before we figured out a plan and we got the hell out of there and I apparated over to St. Mungo’s.” Harry said speaking for the three of them.
I'd like to think you in advance for the kudos, bookmarks, and comments. They make me happy and write quicker.
Harry James Potter hated his life. His parents were drunks who died in a car crash and he was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley of 4 Privet Drive who treated him like a slave. He was the maid, he cooked, cleaned, gardened, and was Dudley Dursley’s personal punching bag. He sighed looking down at his left wrist where a black tattoo of the name Draco Lucius Malfoy was flanked by what looked to be two dragons. The name had been there for as long as he remembered and none of the Dursley’s had a tattoo of a name on them.
Dumbledore glared at Grant when he mentioned that Kieran was unavailable. He figured that meant the bitch Bellatrix was also unavailable. He just hoped he had a few moments before Grant found a Healer and he could search around for any information on Harry Potter. “Do you mind helping me up?”
“Two of us.” Draco said winking at Harry who looked confused like he was the first time, Olivia a nurse friend of his, took him here. “Relax would you, there is a speakeasy downstairs.” Draco whispered to the tense Auror.
Bellatrix sat the phial’s in her hand on the counter next to the delicious looking shake. “Harry, we are going to have to move you into another room, but first I think you can easily down a few potions and a quick shake.
Kieran looked at Dumbledore. “I can’t and am not going to tell you anything about Harry. Provide the documentation proving you are his Magical Guardian or leave the premise. If you don’t provide documentation, I’ll have security escort you out. I am terribly busy today and I don’t have time for you stating something; but not having the documentation to back it up.” Kieran turned on his heel and had his hand on the door.
“I guess I’ll meet with him. One meeting and if I don’t like him you two can drop it.” Harry sassed. “I guess you can do the in-depth health scan.”
“Hello Mr. Potter.” He said giving the shaking Auror a kind smile. “I’m Healer Malfoy, and I have been tasked with healing you today.”
“It was nice seeing you.” He lied turning the door handle and leaving the room to tend to Harry and figure out what McGonagall wanted to talk about. He tapped his badge to the sensor and the doors to the treatment area flung open.
“Chocolate?” Harry questioned figuring most children his age liked chocolate and it was probably a more common request for a shake.
The waitress lead the two over to a old time ‘Smeg’ fridge. “He’s waiting for you down the spiral staircase.” She told them opening the fridge, but instead of food there was a spiral staircase leading into an abyss, the only source of light was a giant sign pointing downward that read ‘thrills’. Suddenly the two wizards were in a moodily-lit speakeasy with interesting things hanging on the walls. Overall it was lovely with the exposed brickwork and the great music lightly playing in the background. Harry never would have thought Draco would like a place like this. Someone led them to an empty table and he finally saw the name of the bar printed at the top of the menu. “The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town?” He said laughing gently to not disturb the other patrons as he looked for something to drink.
Harry sat up in the bed feeling an intense pounding in his head and chest. That nurse reminded him of Vernon and felt alarmed that someone who was supposed to help him was being so cruel. He liked the dragon he never had something that he could call his before and she so cruelly took it from him. He was also missing a blanket over his bare legs and the light was insultingly bright. He sat on the edge of the bed trying to get his bearings.
“Damn those muggles.” Bellatrix cursed leaning her back against the desk her arms crossed over her chest. She wanted to visit Surry and hex those muggles with a curse only someone in the Black family could muster.
He grabbed Teddy’s small hand and grabbed a handful of powder. “Weasley Burrow.” He tossed the powder and stepped gracefully out of the fireplace into Molly’s awaiting hug. He winced after she pulled away his ribs were still a tiny bit tender.
She entered the potion room and found Grant mixing up a potion. “How’s your day?”
“What does the Headmaster want; also, why is it about me?” Harry questioned.
The elevator opened onto the fifth floor, and he called for one of the elves to get a Shepherd’s Pie for room 505 so that Harry could have dinner. He peaked into the open room and saw the Appetite Booster and the Nutrient Potion sitting on the counter. He also noticed the black blob of cat sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed which was the Animagus of his wife. He laughed softly realizing how protective she was being of the child, and he almost hoped that Harry had woken up at some point and tried to cuddle the annoyed looking cat.
Grant knocked on the door to the room they were using. “Healer Reid, I have Minerva McGonagall wishing to speak to Dumbledore.” He said an amused tone in his voice wishing he could stay and witness what McGonagall had to say to Dumbledore. She was not a happy woman and had basically chewed his ear about what an idiot Dumbledore was.
“Thank you. I’ve seen a lot of horrid things in this line of work; but I think Mr. Potter takes the cake. Healer Reid what is your plan for Harry’s injuries?”
“Since you offered; why don’t you bring it up to the fifth floor in say 30 minutes?” Kieran said walking towards the elevator. He figured the kiddo would appreciate more ice cream. After all the kid did need to eat and there was nothing wrong with bribing him with fatter foods to get him to eat and try putting some weight onto his brittle bones.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s awesome mate.” Neville looked at Hermione knowing now was not a good time to announce that they had finally set a date for the wedding. “I can’t wait to meet the little bundle.”
She grabbed the shake off the counter and handed it to Harry. “One chocolate shake with whipped topping. You’ll have to let me know how it tastes since I didn’t make it. Grant did.” She teased politely sticking a straw into the cup and placing it into Harry’s outstretched hand.
She knew Regulus was right that his parents and Sirius would personally haunt whoever placed Harry with that rotten family. She still wanted to apparate to Surry and turn those guilty into a pile of dust; but at the same time, she knew it would be too pleasant of an ending. No, those muggles needed to know true fear and pain and the only one capable of such a feat was Azkaban and a Dementor.
“Harry James Potter what did you do to yourself this time.” Molly screeched hating that both of her children were Auror’s. It’s like they were trying to send her into an early grave, it might have been seven years but she would still wake up at night and look at the clock wishing that Percy were still on it. Instead where Percy had once been Harry’s spoon replaced it, Harry was like another son to her and it seemed only fitting that he too have a spoon on her clock. “I know your hand pointed on the hospital yesterday, you will tell me what you did.” She shook her finger at the Auror, her boys and Ginny might have all grown up and were slowly starting families, but they would always be her babies.
“If at any point during the night you feel like you are having trouble sleeping or find your sleep plagued with nightmares let your mediwitch or wizard know, and they’ll be able to see Kieran’s order for that potion.” She said with a wink.
“They apparently had another son that was quite overweight. Harry had no prior knowledge of being a wizard before Hagrid showed up. His family were at a cabin in the middle of a lake trying to escape the letters. Has he told you anything?” Kieran asked looking at the small boy curled into a ball in the bed.
“Grant, if you need me, I’ll be on the fifth floor tending to Harry.” She told the other Mediwizard.
“Honestly one of the worst cases I’ve had in a while.” She muttered feeling a paper airplane get tangled up in her hair. She knew it was a note from Regulus, he was one of the few who would make his airplanes tease her. It was kind of their thing when it came to sending interdepartmental notes. She quickly handed Grant the phials of potion she was carrying and untangled the offensive paper from her mess of black hair.
“Seven works for me and I’ll text you the address.” Draco said placing the signed copy of the discharge order in his chart. “Do be careful, your ribs are still healing.” He warned as he showed Harry out of the exam rooms and out of St. Mungo’s A&E department.
“So, you became a Healer?” Harry asked dumbly it was obvious that Draco was now a Healer. “Raid gone wrong, is what happened. Yaxley ambushed my partners and I.” He told the Healer he was sure his wrist was broken, he was still shaking from the torture curse and his ribs felt like a Hippogriff had danced a jig on top of them. He was also wheezing heavily between his words.
The Healer smiled gently at the child. “Your dinner will be here in a few minutes. While you wait may I apply some more burn paste to your back?” He held up the tub of burn paste. “You are due for another coat.”
Harry snorted derisively at the healer. “Like the time Mrs. Gray called social services. Fat lot of good that did for me. Just fix my wrist so the giant man can send me back.” Harry sighed he wasn’t going to be telling them anything. The last time Vernon and Petunia had a visit from a social worker it didn’t end up helping him. It only made the Dursley’s madder at him for trying to ruin their perfect image.
“You might want to settle down before I call security.” The other Mediwitch, Ethel, said.
Theseus opened his private office and transfigured a table into a chair since he wasn’t used to having several people in his office. He also cast a quick ‘Muffliato’ on his door. “So, want to explained what happened, or do you want to hear what I see?” He questioned sounding rather pleasant, and there was nothing more terrifying than a pleasant Scamander.
All that she could think of was of her own children. Her brilliant Rigel who was so much like a clone of Kieran. The twelve-year-old who was a proud Ravenclaw and who had bested every other member of his year in terms of grades. He loved knowledge and was constantly on the hunt for more books to read. He was a wiz at Charms and often said that Flitwick was his favorite Professor.
“Have fun at Alton Towers.” Draco muttered paying the bartender and leaving her a nice tip. He followed the Auror up the stairs leading to the restroom in the restaurant. “I had a great time tonight and come hungry I make great pasta.” He said with a wink holding the yellow door open for Harry.
“Hello mother.” He said sitting down on the cushy chair, his healer robes billowing out behind him like some sort of cape. “Yes, a long day of paperwork, only one person would let me treat them today. It’s getting worse, I’m afraid that soon I’ll have to give up working one day a week at St. Mungo’s. So, I um bumped into Harry Potter today.” He said knowing that his mother knew of his secret crush on the Gryffindor.
“He would sneer if I missed a spot, remembering all the cauldron cleanings?” Ron teased remembering all his detentions with the resident dungeon bat. “I know on a couple detention days McGonagall had to come find me worried about the length of some of my detentions.” Ron teased putting his Auror robes back on. “Let’s go then lads.” He suggested knowing Hermione would be waiting for them.
Andromeda grabbed a piece of parchment after placing the health scan into her briefcase. She felt nauseated after reading that health scan and could feel the Black Family urge to go harm those that did this to an innocent child. “Is their anything Harry might have mentioned that we could look into. Did he mention where he was from? What schools he might have attended? Has someone else tried to get him justice?”
Dumbledore narrowed his eyes and then realized he should try a more polite tactic he might get the information he wanted. “I’m sorry dears, I’m just very worried about Harry. You were both students under me; surly you know that I just want to know that he is safe and being taken care of. Please, give me the information regarding Harry Potter. I am simply confused how I can send Hagrid to collect the child and let him and his family know that he is a wizard. Then the next thing I know Hagrid is letting me know that Harry is at St. Mungo’s. Surely you both as parents understand how I am feeling.”
“You saw Draco?” She asked with a smile she knew that Harry was gay and she couldn’t help but think those boys would be good together. With Narcissa living with her she couldn’t help but she Draco on occasion and that poor boy had looked like he had been to hell and back. She also knew Harry was not as fine as he let on, and that he was hiding demons. Teddy had told her that Harry screams a lot in his sleep. She couldn’t help but worry about Harry after all he was the one raising her grandchild.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore was feeling annoyed that they kept reciting the same things repeatedly about documentation. He needed to get them on his side so they wouldn’t go looking for James, Lily, or Sirius wills. “Was Harry abused? If those muggles abused him, I’m going to have a serious conversation with them regarding child abuse. Also, if they abused Harry, I know that the Weasley’s, his soulmate’s family, would gladly take him in. I know Ron and Harry would become fast friends.”
“It is good, you’ll like it.” Bellatrix said grabbing the fork and cutting the pie into smaller bites trying to make things easy for Harry’s wrists besides it felt instinctual as a mother to cut food into manageable bites.
“Can one of you please stop gossiping and go get an OR prepped for a Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm?” He questioned clapping his hands together to get them to move. Right now, though he wanted to figure out what happened to Harry’s Dragon and how the hell she had no idea he was passed out on the floor in the middle of the room. “Umbridge my office please.”
Harry looked questionably at the Healer he was expecting to be questioned over everything the Dursley’s had ever done to him. Instead, the Healer wanted to talk about dragons. Which was alright with him, he would much rather be learning about dragons or anything else magical over telling another stranger personal details of growing up at the Dursley’s. “I’d like that.” Harry muttered glad the Healer wasn’t pushing or prying into things he didn’t want to talk about.
“Severus?” Regulus questioned wondering why his husband was sitting outside his office.
Harry opened the bedroom and popped a few Paracetamol’s and downed a Dreamless Sleep potion. He had difficulty sleeping since the battle. It seemed like every time he closed his eyes he dreamed of all of those that had died. He went to the door a cast ‘Muffliato’ so that Teddy couldn’t hear his screams of terror. He removed his contacts and placed them in their container before stumbling his way to his bed. He felt the potion take effect and pull him into a blissful sleep only to be awoken three hours later to the sound of his tortured screams. Harry bolted upright in bed and held a pillow close to his chest letting his mind get the better of him. Sometimes he wished he would have died during the battle; for that would have to be a better alternative than his dreams.
Ron grumbled setting down his quill looking at Harry. “I think I’d rather be cleaning Snape’s cauldron’s, or cleaning up after Buckbeak, no wait cleaning the Slytherin dungeons with my toothbrush.” He absolutely hated Auror reports, he liked catching the baddies, but he did not like the paperwork.
Harry ducked into one of the fireplaces lining the main entrance and flooed to Andromeda’s house to pick up Teddy. He landed neatly in her living room, he had long gotten used to not landing on his arse when using the floo network. “Hey Teddy.” He said watching his godson coloring. “Thank you for watching him Andy.” He said as a cup of tea levitated over to him as he sat down on the floor next to Teddy.
Bellatrix smiled softly she loved her husband dearly. He was always her voice of reason when she needed it the most. They came to the Accident and Emergency waiting room and saw Dumbledore lecturing Hagrid about something. She could see tear stains around the half giants’ eyes like whatever the Headmaster was saying was hateful. “Hello Hagrid and Headmaster Dumbledore.” She greeted pleasantly.
Hey look an update. I think I am just as shocked as you all really. I'd say I get better at updating but for all I know it will be another few months before the plot attacks me again. So I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and I would like to think you all for the bookmarks, kuddos, and reviews. They really do make me happy. :)
‘Thank you!’ Bellatrix mouthed to the Medi Intern watching the child viciously attack the sundae it was honestly nice to watch the child eat after years of being starved.
“We mostly talked about dragons; but he did seem receptive to the idea that magical creatures such as dragons do exist.” Regulus said crossing his left leg over his right leg. “It would seem his relatives told him that James and Lily were raging drunks that hated Harry from the moment he was born and regrated his birth and that the two of them died in a drunk driving incident. Harry realized what he had said and quickly clamed a hand over his mouth to try and keep himself from telling me more.”
“Your lab results show several nutrient and vitamin deficiencies so starting now and after we discharge you from St. Mungo’s we will have you take a nutrient potion and appetite booster until at least the end of this year. Unlike physical injuries that takes a while to fix. I’ll also meet with a nutrition healer and see if they can think of any specialty potions that I’m not thinking of or prescribe often.” He said honestly, he was an Accident and Emergency Healer who was used to breaking minor curses, fixing Quidditch injuries, and whatever else was basic enough that didn’t get sent to one of the more specialized floors.
Regulus had just stepped out from a shower that he shared with Severus and every nerve in his body snapped awake. It was the spell he had placed outside of Harry’s room before he had left for the night. Not only was Harry’s emotions going haywire, but the spell was having trouble detecting movement. “Fuck!” He cursed quickly wrapping the towel around his waist. “Sev, I got to go.” He said running into the closet.
For those who might be wondering what is going on with my other story The Edge of a Revolution have no fear I haven't given up on it. I am just having issues with one of the chapters and am in the process of rewriting the earlier chapters. Then the idea popped into my head and wouldn't leave me alone. So here we go.
“That works.” Harry said entering the date into his phone. “I’ll see you Wednesday, enjoy your day off tomorrow.”
The first thing they noticed was the unresponsive child laying in the middle of the floor with no Medistaff in sight. Regulus grabbed three pairs of gloves from the glove rack and tossed Bellatrix and Kieran a pair.
Kieran sighed softly at the mention of Dumbledore needing any sort of medical treatment. He was glad he had his hands full with Harry and all his needs along with meetings with Regulus and Andromeda. “Harry, I’m going to explain the potions you’ll be taking with lunch. The first is the appetite boosting potion which you will take with all your meals. It will help to stimulate your appetite and make you feel hungrier than you typically feel. You will take this specific potion three times a day with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.” He said watching Bellatrix hand him the clear potion.
“Harry, we have to go have a conversation with the Headmaster of Hogwarts, but before we’ll do, we will give you something to help with any prior pain you might be feeling, and it will make you a little drowsy. After we finish talking with him, we will be back to discuss the next steps when it comes to meeting with Healer Regulus and Andy and what to do when it comes to healing your prior injuries and breaks.” He said gesturing to the large stack of parchment outlining every single injury the child had been through since he was born until the present.
“We promise if you aren’t receptive to Regulus, we will drop it with no questions. For the scan I’m going to need to get you into a hospital gown. I know you refused the idea earlier, but it allows me the best access to what I need to treat. I promise I won’t ask if you don’t want to share or elaborate. Also, if you decide to seek justice for what they have done to you the scan will be available and Bellatrix or myself might be called to testify. It is entirely up to you with whatever action you decide to seek.”
Kieran looked at his wife feeling confused. He had personally seen Draco Lucius Malfoy on Harry’s inner wrist and here Dumbledore was going on about how Harry was supposedly Ginevra’s soulmate.
Teddy sighed and slid off the couch and trailed after his ‘father.’ “How long will it take for your ribs to feel better?” The child asked crawling into his bed so that Harry could tuck him in for the night.
“So, the great Harry Potter is gay?” Draco questioned finishing his drink trying to ease his nerves. “You might be gay, but what makes you think I am gay?”
Kieran came back into the room at that moment and she quickly threw up a privacy spell so Harry couldn’t overhear what they were saying.
“Harry, I want you to know that there is absolutely zero shame in wanting to see me or talk to me. Even if you don’t want to see me regularly that is fine assuming you wish to see me at all. It isn’t going to hurt my feelings. Nobody is going to think of you as odd or crazy or any other terrible term associated with those that need help. I want you to know that I am a safe place and a good person to talk to. Even if we just talk about dragons.” Regulus stated politely. He hated the stigma associated with mental health and abused children. It was the worst thing about being a Mind Healer was the fact so many were reluctant to his help.
Minerva’s shoes clicked against the linoleum and she had her wand drawn. “I told you Headmaster that Petunia and Vernon were the worst sort of muggles and now I find out poor Mister Harry Potter is a patient at St. Mungo’s. You didn’t even bother to tell me yourself, instead you send me an owl.” She turned realizing she wasn’t in the room alone with Dumbledore. She saw Bellatrix and Kieran Reid looking at her lecture awkwardly.
“My ribs are still tender from Yaxley’s blasting curse, my healer warned that they would still be tender today.”
First off I'd love to thank everyone who has left a comment, kudos, bookmarked, or subscripted to any of my stories. Thank you all sooooo very much for your love and support.
“Hello Mediwitch Umbridge, I’m Healer Reid. I don’t believe we’ve met.” He said politely offering her his left hand to shake. “You have my patient Harry tonight.”
“The best.” Harry said a little bit of melted whipped cream dripping down his chin.
“I demand to know about Harry Potter I am his Magical Guardian.” Albus spat rolling his eyes at the idea of Harry being treated by Slytherin slime. Kieran might have been a Ravenclaw during his time at Hogwarts, but he married a Slytherin and that made him Slytherin slime in his mind.
“Harry, I’ll be right back. While I’m gone Bella is going to give you a pain potion to help with the pain of your wrist.” He looked at his wife and gestured to the note on the counter regarding the dosage. He didn’t want to tell Harry the dosage and make him get anxious that they were already picking up on the abuse signs.
Harry laughed knowing that Hermione didn’t have a Dark Mark, but the person he was meeting up with later did. “No, she attended Koldovstoretz. Ron Hermione doesn’t have a Dark Mark, I think Neville would know if his future wife has one of those.”
“Pukwudgie, it favors the heart of the wizard.” Draco said breaking the last bit of pretzel in half and dipping his end into the cheese. “I actually had the option of Horned Serpent or Pukwudgie. I chose Pukwudgie, simply because I wanted to get away from snakes for a while.” Draco took a sip of his drink finding Harry easy to talk too.
Draco smiled softly and handed Harry a copy of the discharge papers. “It’s my job, but I never did get an opportunity to thank you for saving mother and I from Azkaban, why don’t you and I get drinks tomorrow night assuming you are free. It’s the least I can do for what you did.” He said hoping that the Auror would accept.
I’ll meet you in the OR.” Adrien said handing the blue phial over to Regulus before leaving the room in search of a cup of strong coffee and a pair of green scrubs. He was not about to fix a ruptured aneurysm in a pair of silk pajamas.
“Morning Master Teddy, I made chocolate waffles for breakfast.” He said placing the plate of waffles covered in chocolate syrup and whip cream in front of the child. “Harry is taking a shower, he’ll probably be down in a moment.” The elf heard the shower turn off. He went to cabinet to fix Harry a quick bowl of yogurt and berries.
“Wait how do you know that stuff?” Harry asked noticing that Draco suddenly sounded less like a Healer and more like a muggle doctor. “I find Skele-Gro to taste of Goblin Piss.” He was honest he hated that time in second year in which that idiot Lockhart had banished his bones.
“I heard about that, I’m sorry about Lucius.” He said seeing Draco’s expression, he hadn’t released Draco’s bitterness towards his father. “So, Blaise and Luna!” Harry exclaimed wondering why Luna hadn’t told him about her new relationship.
Draco listening to Harry intently his auto quill was writing down all his complaints. “Wait Neville Longbottom is an Auror?” Out of everyone from his class the last person he would think would become an Auror was Neville; he always remembered that Neville was good with Herbology. He walked over to the cabinet looking for the potion to help with the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse. He grabbed the small phial and glided back to the bed. “Here this will help with shocks going through your body.” It would also help him examine the Auror easier but he left that part off. “I’d drink it in one go, it tastes pretty terrible.”
“I’ll be back soon.” Bellatrix handed Kieran the navy blue hospital gown in the pediatric size and leaving the room.
Harry laughed and that was a sound Draco wanted to hear permeantly. “No, Ginny was just a school fling.” He hadn’t told anybody but she made him realize that he was gay. He hadn’t told anyone that he was gay, he wasn’t ready to come out of his broom closet quite yet.
Kieran figured now was as good a time as any to bring up Harry’s malnutrition and the suggestion of nutrient potions to help with the deficits.
Regulus quickly charmed his trash receptacle to banish Vivienne’s vomit. He understood and would never tell a soul that he was witness to Vivienne Riddle unloading her stomach in his office. This case was especially horrid. It was a wonder Harry James Potter was still alive.
The Auror looked up at the blonde standing in his door. “Malfoy?” He questioned wondering what in Merlin’s name he was doing as a Healer at St. Mungo’s. Harry had to secretly admit that Draco did look good in the Healer robes.
“Boys my office.” Theseus said breaking Harry from his thoughts about Malfoy.
Bellatrix laughed softly at herself seeing how angry Minerva was towards Dumbledore. “Hello Professor McGonagall. Both Elara and Rigel are doing great, they love summer, but I know they are ready to get back to Hogwarts and Elara is thrilled to be joining her brother this year. I take it you two have things you’d like to discuss.”
Bellatrix came back five minutes later with Andromeda and Vivienne in tow. “Vivienne, you remember Healer Kieran Reid and Mind Healer Regulus Black-Snape.” She said politely the four of them had worked a few child abuse cases together, but none of those were as bad as poor Harry.
After lunch the rest of the day passed by in a relative blur, the trio turned in their detailed report about the raid and left shortly after since Theseus was adamant about their three-day suspension so they could read the reports and view the memories in the pensive.
Harry sighed and looked at the dragon he was holding tightly. He didn’t want to admit it, but Regulus was fun to talk to, and he was one of the few adults outside of Bellatrix and Kieran that was taking him seriously and was offering to keep him safe and away from the Dursley’s. Surely, they wouldn’t judge him for seeing Regulus and that he could work his school schedule around meetings with Regulus. He thought he remembered hearing that Regulus was married to one of his professors maybe that professor could sneak Regulus in and out and if he did have friends, he could use the excuse of getting homework help.
“I promise you Harry that your parents loved you very much and that they were not negligent drunks.” Regulus said wanting to cry his heart physically hurt. He remembered finding out that Sirius had died trying to figure out who had murdered James and Lily.
Harry smiled at the Healer; he felt a feeling in his stomach that he hadn’t felt in a while. It was a feeling he occasionally got during lunches at school; assuming he was lucky enough to make it down to the cafeteria before Dudley and his gang. If he didn’t Dudley would often steal his lunch for himself. It was one of the reasons Dudley was the way he was. “I feel full.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“She’ll actually be coming along a little later to talk to Andromeda regarding Harry’s situation. Minerva apparently was tasked with watching the house before Harry was placed with the Dursley’s and Minerva told Dumbledore that she didn’t think Petunia was a fit guardian for Harry; but you know how Dumbledore can be about family.”
“Kieran helps me into it, and you go out into the hall.” Harry told the witch he knew it was stupid that Bellatrix would be present for the scan and would see all of it anyway, but he felt more comfortable with the idea of Kieran.
“I figured you might like a case, you look rather bored just filling out paperwork. I can’t help but feel you are wasting talent.” The Mediwitch, Zara, said handing him the chart.
Bellatrix cleaned up Harry’s messy face and took the now clean tray away from Harry’s bedside table. She looked to Kieran to explain what the plan was for tomorrow and obviously catch the child up on their plan.
Kieran watched the child down the potion and watch his wife reach for the next potion which was the nutrient potion. “The next potion which you will typically take with breakfast and dinner is a nutrient potion. It is like a muggle multivitamin; it is loaded with vitamins and minerals your body is currently deficient in. I know it is lunch but since this your first dose of these potions we are giving it to you with lunch, so you have two doses today.” He said before Harry could question why he mentioned taking it with breakfast when it was currently lunch time.
“Again, as we have said we need official documentation from either The Ministry or Gringotts Bank. So, until we have the documentation we can add to his file, you will not be getting any information out of Healer Reid, myself, or any staff member at St. Mungo’s. We take privacy here very seriously. Now do you have any other questions, or can Healer Reid and I get back to our patients?” She said with a bite to her words. They had explained it several times already and she was quickly losing her patience with Dumbledore.
Bellatrix raised an eyebrow at her husband wondering what Dumbledore was getting at. She had seen Harry’s soulmate name and she was certain that her nephew wasn’t a Weasley. “Who is Harry’s soulmate?” She asked dumbly deciding to go along.
Harry smiled softly hearing the last part of Draco’s sentence, he didn’t really have much of a choice in becoming an Auror, his father was one, Sirius was one, and now he was one; besides Kingsley wanted Harry, Ron, and Neville to work with Theseus Scamander in catching Voldemort’s remaining minions. “Ron actually married Padma Patel, remember her? She was a Ravenclaw in our year. Hermione is engaged to Neville. What about you seeing anybody?”
She went back to the exam room Harry was in and found him sitting up in bed his jumper sleeves pulled down over his wrists again. “Planning to escape?” She teased gently crossing the room to get to the stretcher. “I’m afraid like Azkaban we are pretty secure especially with children.” She sat on the edge of the bed and handed Harry the phial of pink liquid.
“Alright kiddo I’ll go talk to Bellatrix and Kieran about your case and draft a rough schedule for you. But before I go, I figured I’d let you know that I knew your parents, James and Lily. My brother Sirius and husband Severus were remarkably close to them. James and Lily were amazing people and even better parents. They loved you so much Harry.”
Bellatrix placed her head on Kieran’s shoulder feeling the room feel a little quitter as her magic relaxed a little bit being in her husband’s arms. The books on the bookshelf were still and the room felt a little less angry. Kieran was great at grounding her anger when she started to feel out of control. Her anger didn’t happen all that often but when it did, it could rivel just about any active volcano. “That poor baby.” She muttered tears slipping from her brown eyes.
Regulus was feeling angry and on the more emotional side so best to question her in private instead in front of everyone.
Neville groaned as Hermione wandered off to her office. “I don’t want to deal with the fallout from yesterday, I’m really glad that even though you had to make a detour to St. Mungo’s that you are doing better. So, what did the healer officially diagnosis you with?”
“I don’t know. Do you have someone that you feel confident will keep their mouth shut about me?”
Then there was her sweet, little, Elara. People liked to joke given how close in age Rigel and Elara were that they are Irish Twins. Rigel and Elara couldn’t have been more different while Rigel was very studious and loved the knowledge of learning anything and everything. Elara was the planner of the family. She had a plan for everything and was freakishly cunning, she had managed to wrap all her cousins around her perfectly manicured nails like a typical Slytherin. In fact, sometimes Bellatrix was terrified of her own daughter’s cunning behavior. There had been more than once where Elara had involved Rigel into one of her plans and outsmarted both Kieran and Bellatrix.
Teddy huffed and crossed his arms. “No, I’m too young to date remember.”
“Harry not to be the buzzkill but aren’t you worried about her using you for your fame?” Hermione asked, it was what she usually asked before Harry went on a date with anyone.
Ron groaned hoping those two didn’t make that suggestion to Padma. “What’s her name, probably something exotic.”
“I love you to mother.” He said getting up a dusting off his robes. “I will certainly let you know how drinks go.” He said honestly navigating his way back to the fireplace. He stumbled into his own living room and nearly on his arse had it not been for a house elf.
Draco signed Potter’s discharge papers in his usual flourish, he yawned and looked at his watch two hours until the end of this shift. He had a day off tomorrow from both St. Mungo’s and London Grace and planned to do absolutely nothing unless of course his planned worked and he could get Potter to go get a drink with him tomorrow night. He knocked on the door not wanting to walk in on Potter being indecent. “I have your discharge papers, I just need you to sign them.” He said handing Potter a self-inking quill.
“No, I do not think you are crazy in any sense of the word. Besides most behavioral and mental health conditions are nothing to be ashamed of. I’m just giving you someone to reach out to. I’ll have them come talk to you and the decision for help is entirely up to you. The word crazy doesn’t exist in my vocabulary and it shouldn’t exist in yours either.” Kieran said softly but sternly he didn’t particularly like the word crazy or any of the other words associated with mental and behavior health. “One meeting that is all I ask.”
“Actually, I’d rather not be in the same room as him. Mediwitch Reid are you open to a conversation. I know you can’t tell me anything, but I can tell you things, right?” Minerva asked the witch politely. She had lots she’d like to discuss about Harry.
Another freaky thing on the list of freaky things the hated him for. Plus, Draco was clearly a boy’s name along with being an odd name. The tattoo enraged Vernon because not only was Harry a ‘freak’ but the tattoo also meant he was a ‘fairy’. Vernon had threatened him a few times to show him what it meant to be a pillow-biter; but never did.
Your parents are going to personally haunt whoever decided to put you in this situation. So, I need you to fight, and I promise I will work with Andromeda and Vivienne to get you justice for what these muggles have caused.” He looked up and caught Kieran’s glance and mouthed ‘Take care of him for us. Severus will never forgive me if I let anything happen to Lily’s child now that we know where he is.’
Andromeda smiled softly and embraced her sister and brother-in-law tightly before turning her attention to her cousin, Regulus. “Good to see you Regulus, how’s Severus? Nymphadora is going to miss him terribly this year; but I know she’ll make an excellent Auror.” She said pulling out Regulus’s office chair and sitting down. His office wasn’t exactly made for meetings with large amounts of people.
Bellatrix sighed at the mention of the nickname that he and Sirius were so fond of calling her growing up, her own husband had called her that a few times on accident. She didn’t mind it so much when it came from her husband, but when it came from the cousin it annoyed her. She took the potions back from Grant and floated the note into the trash watching as the note shredded itself into a bunch of tiny pieces.
“Good luck with Tati tonight mate.” Ron said with a wink stepping in the fireplace to take him home.
“Thank you Nixxie.” He told the house elf going to the bedroom to change out of his robes and into Slytherin jumper and pair of fleece pajama bottoms. He lovely looked at his bed and headed into the bathroom to brush his teeth and to moisturize his face. Hospital air just did something to his skin.
Narcissa hated the seven years her son was gone, it was so good to have him back. “A lot has happened in seven years, and I couldn’t be more proud of you.” She said finishing her glass of wine, she knew Draco had worked hard his last year at Ilvormorny, she knew how excited he was when he was accepted into Harvard’s MD and Healer program. She would be eternally grateful for Harry Potter and what he had did for her and Draco.
He landed neatly in one of the fireplaces seeing Hermione and Neville already waiting on them. “Hey guys.” He said pulling Hermione in for a small hug.
“Azkaban?” Harry questioned before downing the phial of pink liquid. “Good flavor.” He muttered handing the phial back to Bellatrix.
Bellatrix watched as the child finished his dinner in record time; not even her own children could eat that quickly and at Rigel’s age he was starting to become a bottomless pit. She turned around a grabbed a flannel and ran it under the sink finding the child to have gravy all around his mouth.
Draco shook his head what started out as a very boring shift had soon turned into a rather enjoyable shift. He chewed at his lip watching the Auror trying to get out of his robes, only for him to his in pain.
Bellatrix came back the moment that Kieran was pulling up the sleeve of the sweater. “Grant went to talk to Hagrid about any information he could give us about the child.” She told her husband before going to crouch next to the child. “If you’d like to hold my hand while Kieran checks out your wrist you can. Also, you have some of the prettiest eyes I’ve ever seen.” She muttered sitting down on the stretcher and offering Harry one of her hands with black nail polish on her nails.
“Sorry Hermione, blame the boss.” Ron said with a mouthful of burrito in his mouth, a piece of steak dropping the end onto the table. “I’d much rather be in the field than dealing with Ministry paperwork.”
Harry gently stretched out his knees and slid down in the bed offering Kieran his wrist. “Pain potion helped. I forgot to pack the Paracetamol.” He said before slamming his other hand over his mouth realizing what he had just said.
Neville tucked his head into his robe sleeve to muffle his boisterous laughter. “I could almost picture Snape sneering that you missed a spot. Let’s get lunch, I’m hungry.” He muttered he was most of the way finished with his report.
“No, he will not be coming with you for anything.” Vernon shouted grabbing Harry’s broken wrist and shoving him roughly against the cabin wall.
He held out his arms and felt the child being transferred into his arms. “I’ll have Grant come to talk to you about what you saw and anything you might know about the child. Right now, his injury takes top priority.” He smiled polity at the giant he never had a problem with Hagrid during his time at Hogwarts.
“So, what house were you sorted into?” Harry asked taking a sip of his drink he wasn’t chugging them like he usually did since he did have to get up early tomorrow.
“Then why are you going to work if you are still injured?” Molly lectured wanting to do nothing more than to send Harry upstairs and baby him, but she knew she couldn’t do so with a twenty-five-year-old.
“How was work, Harry?” Andromeda asked watching him ruffle Teddy’s blue hair.
Vernon cocked his gun and pointed at the giant man yet again. “He will not be going. Now I believe I told you to get the hell out.”
“If you decide you want to meet with me, I’ll have Professor Snape send me a copy of your schedule and I’ll write you a letter within the first few days of you being at Hogwarts to set up a time to meet. You won’t be the first to need sessions at Hogwarts, and I doubt you’ll be the last.”
Kieran quickly levitated a floating stretcher over to the bed and levitated the small child onto it. He gently covered the child with a warm blanket and had the stretcher follow Bellatrix and himself. “Regulus please let us know what that memory shows.”
“Let me help, you’ll only injure yourself further, and I’d rather that not happen.” He sassed undoing the clasp around Potter’s neck and helping him gently out of the robes. “I’d also rather not explain to my boss that you injured yourself further trying to seduce your healer.” He teased lightly, his teasing lacked the usual Malfoy bite; besides Harry was right he did have nice abs. Merlin, he needed to stop thinking this way about Potter. Focus Draco you are a healer, do your job and stop getting distracted by the handsome man in the man.
“Headmaster Dumbledore my husband worked hard for his degree and I would think as a Headmaster of an esteemed institution such as Hogwarts would understand the respect of one’s title. Please use either Healer Reid or Doctor Reid seeing as Healer Reid went on to study at the University of Oxford and earned his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree so he can practice both in the Muggle World and The Magical World.” Bellatrix was annoyed with Dumbledore basically insulting her husband’s education by using a title he’d use to refer to a male student at Hogwarts still receiving their education.
“Dragons are very much real.” Regulus said nodding his head at Bellatrix and Kieran as they left. He figured they’d be going to his office to give him and the child a bit of privacy. He could feel the child watching his every move it was a feeling he was used to when working with children, teenagers, and the occasional adult.
Grant turned to the bench and grabbed the bottle of protein powder and a bunch of other nutrient powders and mixed up a delightful chocolate shake with bonus whipped cream and a cherry on top of it. It looked like something that would have come from
“You aren’t my boss. I don’t have to go anywhere with you.” She retorted going back to talking to Ethel.
“They are still really close friends of mine, we did however drift apart while I spend seven years across the pond, since it was hard to stay in touch given to communication in 1998. It’s also nice since Olivia doesn’t know my history or about Voldemort.” He said with an eye roll adjusting the sleeve of his shirt while grabbing a small piece of salted pretzel covered in butter and salt. He dipped into the beer cheese dip. “So, besides what we talked about yesterday what else is new with you in the seven years I was gone?”
“Sirius would be quite pleased to know little brother finally learned some of his favorite words.” Bellatrix teased feeling much the same when it came to this case. She had said a similar word when it was just her and Kieran. “Does Harry like the idea of you?” She questioned wondering if Harry would be seeing Regulus or if the boy wanted nothing to do with therapy and Regulus.
Harry felt the impact and felt the world around him start spinning and his wrist felt worse than the initial break. He didn’t even stop himself the pain allowed the tears to stream down his face and soon he was full on crying from the pain. “Please.” He squeaked. He heard the loud footsteps of Vernon and braced for an impact that didn’t come. Instead, he saw the giant’s kind black eyes staring at him.
“What did McGonagall have to say about Dumbledore and Harry?”
Grant knocked politely on the doorframe not to disturb anything he saw Bellatrix wiping the child off with a flannel. “Hey Harry, I’m Grant! Kieran was just telling me how much you enjoyed the protein shake I made you; so, I figured I’d surprise you with something even better. I used to work in an ice cream shop. I present to you the popular hot fudge sundae.” He sat the sundae onto the table seeing green eyes following his every move.
“My father always wanted me to attend Durmstrang over Hogwarts, while my mother always against Durmstrang in favor of Beauxbatons. I fought against both of those options when I was younger because I wanted to stay close to them, so when it came time to decide what I wanted to do for my eighth year I knew I didn’t want to attend either of those places, so my options still left on this side of the pond were Russia, Africa, or Japan. I don’t speak Russia or Japanese, and Africa is mostly known for its Astronomy students and while I received an O in Astronomy on the O.W.L.S it was never my favorite subject.” Draco elaborated. “I also liked the history of how Ilvormorny came to be. It was actually founded by a descendant of Salazar Slytherin who married a muggle.” He had refused to use American’s term for a muggle, really no-maj couldn’t they have come something better.
He then went to the closet the Mind Healers shared that was full of toys and plushies. He grabbed the Opaleye dragon plush. The fur of the plush sparkled in the light it would also puff out little red smoke rings on occasion. He knew that Harry probably hadn’t received many gifts growing up and he knew from previous cases that plush toys could help keep children present and give them something to fiddle with. After being a Mind Healer, he was great at detecting non-verbal cues just based on how someone would play with a toy, their pet, or a plush toy.
“Mind Healer Regulus Black-Snape. You must usually be stationed on another ward because surely you’d recognize me.” He said flatly. “How about we finish this conversation in my office.” He suggested and it wasn’t a suggestion so much as a demand.
Harry was a bit taken aback at Draco using his first name instead of Potter, or even worse Potty. “Hey Draco.” He figured they were on a first name basis at this point in their life.
Bellatrix ran her fingers through Harry’s hair and looked at her husband. “I have a cousin who is a Mind Healer he is also married to a man. I think that you’d like Regulus if you give him a shot. Healers and Mediwitch’s are sworn to keep whatever you tell us a secret. Trust me when I say that Kieran and I are the only two permitted to read what your chart now says. We aren’t going to tell or discuss your care with anyone you don’t give us permission.”
Regulus was just leaving his office when he felt the paper airplane note hit him in the chest. He grabbed the note and saw that Bellatrix had moved Harry to the fifth floor since the Headmaster was in the mood to be his usual mad self. He rolled his eyes at the idea of ever seeing Dumbledore as a patient.
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself watching the child drink the shake like it was the best thing to ever exist. Which the sad thing was that might have been one of the first few things he’d ever properly eaten judging from the broken bones, and the lab work. “Good shake?”
“I’m Healer Kieran Reid, I assume you have no knowledge of this world so I’m what is better known to you as a doctor. You are welcome to just call me Kieran though; and the woman with the interesting hair is Bellatrix she’s a Mediwitch which is like a nurse. We are going to take you to an exam room and check on your injured wrist and anything else you mention. Can I get your full name so that Bellatrix can check to see if we can find a file on you?”
“Kieran, Harry doesn’t seem the best mentally. We mostly spoke of dragons, but it was the body language and how he reacted to finding out about his parents that mostly has me worried. He started to talk about Petunia and Vernon and then quickly clamed his hand over his mouth to keep himself from saying more.” Regulus had levitated his own parchment over to his chair and was scribbling his own initial notes regarding the child while telling Kieran and Bellatrix his thoughts.
“Dumbledore begged, pleaded, and moaned that we give him you as his Healer. Can’t quite grasp the fact that a simple Episky is completely below your skillset and mine at this point. Seriously I could cast that spell at thirteen, and he didn’t even cut his wand hand could have easily fixed him it himself. I owe Bellatrix a few Gallons, because she told me earlier as you were transferring the kiddo that he probably would ask about you and her.”
Kieran grabbed the glass of wine and took a small glug. “So, what did you want to talk about?” He questioned feeling the jet massaging his lower back.
“Hagrid, I’ll go ahead and take him, since you aren’t family, I can’t allow you in a treatment room.” He left off the part where children were more forthcoming about abuse if it were just them along with a Healer and a Mediwitch.
Harry watched in awe as the empty glass on the food tray turn a honey color with a foam on top of it. He gingerly took a sip of the liquid and found it to taste amazing. He took the fork and stabbed a bite of beef, carrots, peas, and potato crust. He blew gently on the bite and shoved it into his mouth letting the flavors hit his tastebuds. Not only did he feel voraciously hungry from the potions, but the food tasted heavenly. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a warm meal that tasted this amazing. He grabbed the fork and started to eat like someone lacking proper manners and human decency.
Bellatrix smiled softly at her husband seeing the whipped cream running down the child’s chin. She grabbed a flannel from the cabinet and ran it under the warm water. Soon she heard the telltale sound of Harry mostly slurping in air instead of delicious liquid. She handed Harry the flannel and took the empty cup from the child.
“Umbridge. Look for an older women dressed completely in head-to-toe pink.”
He walked the short distance back to his office and locked it with his magic. He needed a second to curse at the wall. “Fuck!” He exclaimed loudly looking up at the ceiling. It wasn’t until a few more explicit words that he noticed Bellatrix was cuddling her husband on the couch in his office.
“Yeah, I got sorted into two houses, unlike Hogwarts who uses a hat, Ilvormorny uses statues representing the mascots of the house, on the rare occasion a wizard could be accepted into all the houses and then it’s their decision about which house they’d like to be in. It was a cool concept, although I did prefer the hat.” He said his love of Hogwarts not willing to change.
“I thought I was the only one who enjoyed taking a nap in that class, I usually studied in the library, besides historically the Blacks were named after Astrology, my mother is the exception.” Draco dipped another bite of pretzel into the cheese watching it down with his cognac drink. “Yes, Ilvormorny had their own houses, the Headmistress made me get sorted into one of their houses. Unlike Hogwarts it’s not based on traits but rather the soul of the wizard or witch.” He remarked finishing his first drink and ordering another.
“I’m not hungry, but I can try.” Harry muttered not wanting to upset the kind woman. He would gladly try and choke down a few bites of it to make her happy. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a proper meal. He was considered lucky if he got to eat the last roll from dinner. Which was a rare occurrence because usually Vernon and Dudley were fighting over who got to eat the last dinner roll.
“How do you feel?” Kieran asked softly wondering if Harry felt satisfied from the shake and the potions.
He grabbed Harry by his now broken wrist and tossed him into the cupboard. “No dinner.”
Andromeda smiled glad to know that Harry didn’t kick her nephew out of an exam room. “It suits him.” She answered quietly glad that Draco had found his niche in life. “So, what made you get sent to St. Mungo’s? You really ought to think about Minerva’s offer you’d be a great Defense professor.”
Vivienne took the parchment from the healer and quickly skimmed the five pages of parchment with years listed of when the injury occurred. After she got the fifth page, she quickly got up from wingback chair and bolted to the trash can in the corner. In her three years as head of DMCEA she had never seen something so horrid.
Neville laughed wishing he would have followed his dreams of Herbology instead of his parent’s Auror footsteps, he was slowly run out of drive to be an Auror and wanted to do something else instead, maybe after the wedding he’d go and get his Herbology Mastery and his teaching certificate. He was just tired of being an Auror, it had been seven years and all that he did is want to marry Hermione and start a family.
“That is true.” Kieran said organizing the paperwork and putting it back in the file. “I can’t even begin to imagine the suffering he had at the hands of muggles. All because the Headmaster thought it was a good idea. I imagine once Minister Riddle gets word of what happened to this child, he’ll like to personally have a conversation with the Headmaster.” He laughed softly at the thought.
“Kieran, I told you I didn’t like that nurse and look at what happened.” Bellatrix groaned. “Regulus can you please take over holding Harry’s hand while I go deal with Umbridge?” She asked rising from her spot on the bed.
“Mate If I were you I’d be checking Hermione for a Dark Mark.” Ron said looking at Neville. “So, who is she, anyone we’d know?” Ron asked turning his attention back to Harry wondering who the girl was that managed to catch his eye.
Harry wondered if he should tell Ron, Hermione, and Neville that he had plans later. “I actually do have plans for later tonight.”
“I’ll also loop in a Mind Healer to your case; and before you get annoyed with me that I am suggesting you see a ‘shrink’ I’m not saying to have to have weekly appointments not if you don’t want to; but they can be greatly beneficial to have on one’s side during any abuse trials. All that I ask is that you give them a chance and if you hate it and don’t find it helpful you don’t have to if you don’t want to. Would you feel more comfortable meeting with a male or a female? Again, if you don’t like them; you don’t have to see them. Everything is entirely up to you. I’m just offering you someone to talk to.”
Vivienne carefully dropped a few sugar cubes into her tea before stirring it. “As much as I love hearing about the Black Family, I’d like to know why you requested us hear Bellatrix? Andromeda mentioned an important case.” She remarked wanting to know whom the case was about.
“Mummy come quickly.” Dudley cried backing himself into a corner.
The three left the ‘cubical farm’ and headed down the long corridor to the elevator. “Well that was an awful morning, I have a feeling I might be needing some Firewhisky to get the sound of Theseus yelling. Sometimes, I think he is more terrifying than Snape.” Neville muttered looking down at his watch. “I just want to go home and snuggle Hermione.”
Harry shivered slightly feeling the cold paste against his back, but he soon relaxed at the idea of someone touching him besides Kieran had a light touch.
She grabbed the pain potion from the shelf along with the blue raspberry syrup from the flavor shelf towards the bottom. She dropped five drops of flavoring into the phial and then dropped the dosage of pain potion into the phial. She topped it with the cork and gently spun the phial in her hands. She placed both the flavor and pain potion back on the shelf the belonged on. She grabbed the phial and went back to Harry’s room finding her husband working on paperwork.
“I’m going to lift you and take you somewhere that can help you.” Hagrid instructed gently lifting the child realizing he couldn’t weight more 3 and half stone. “You aren’t going to like this, but it is the quickest way to get you out of here.” Hagrid cooed to the small child in his arms disapparating out of the cabin and apparating into the brightly lit accident and emergency ward of St. Mungo’s.
Draco stood up and adjusted the awful lime green colored healer robes and tucked the small file under his arm as he made his way down the corridor he was reminded of his small crush on The Savior. He wanted to kick himself for those thoughts, there was no way in hell was Harry Potter gay, or would he ever go for Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. He sighed and knocked lightly at the door.
“Butterbeer sounds interesting.”
Kieran and Bellatrix didn’t miss what he had said and they both raised an eyebrow at each other. They both knew from his wordage that this was not a fresh break like they assumed that it could have been a few days old. The decided to ignore his little slip up figuring he’d tell them more when he was ready.
“Well, none other than Ginevra Weasley. It is almost poetic that Lady Magic would choose a redhead for Harry seeing as his mother was also a redhead.” Dumbledore laughed softly at the irony. “I’m sure if he was abused by the Dursley’s that Molly would love Harry like one of her own.”
“They did what?” Bellatrix roared the books on the bookshelf shaking loudly again. “They told a child, a child the same as Elara that his parents died in a tragic car accident because they were booze hounds that hated him. I’m going to be fucking sick.” What she wanted was to apparate out of St. Mungo’s and into the sitting room of two very unsuspecting muggles and Cruciatus Curse them to the point where they were begging her to stop. It would probably be uncomfortable but nowhere near to what poor Harry had gone through.
Regulus sat for a moment cataloging his notes regarding his first meeting with Harry. “Kieran, Harry gave me permission to see his physical chart notes. Can I read them, or you rather go over them with me?” He held up his wand and emitted a green glow the same green as Harry’s eyes signaling that he was telling the truth about Harry and having permission.
“Hello Master Harry, how was your evening?” The elf questioned putting down the newspaper.
“I bear the Dark Mark, people tend to not let me forget about my biggest mistake of my life.” He muttered under his breath. “I didn’t know if you’d be okay given our history.” Draco answered giving Harry a sweet smile. “Want to tell me what’s bothering you, besides the aftershocks of The Cruciatus Curse.”
“Of course, your secret is safe with us.” Hermione said after mentioning something about how much fun it will be to be shopping for baby clothes. She looked down at her watch “I’ll see you all for lunch.” She stood up dusting a few crumbs from her dress and placed a small kiss on Neville’s cheek before leaving the table, her pumps clicking loudly as she left the three guys heading to her office on the third floor.
“It is Mediwitch Umbridge and who the hell are you?” She questioned narrowing her gaze at the man.
“It’s alright, I just got back from Birmingham.” She sighed shoving her fork roughly into the salad covered in raspberry vinaigrette. “I wish you boys weren’t on suspension the one helping me was practically useless.”
Draco was curious about Hermione and Neville, also Ron apparently married a Ravenclaw, he couldn’t seem to process that. “Hermione and Neville?” He asked incredulously wondering how that came to be. “Nope single as ever.” He left the part off that he was gay, and while there were a few flings and one serious relationship back in America, nobody had managed to catch his attention quite like Harry stinking Potter. That was something he would take to his grave. “What about you, still dating Weasley’s sister?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you and don’t worry about the poor dear I got him. You go home and get some rest.” Dolores said politely giving the Healer a kind smile.
Vivienne stood up after a few moments noticing her throw up had disappeared and the office smelled of a citrus instead of barf. “I do apologize.”
He hit the line of fireplaces in St. Mungo’s and ran to the steps figuring they would be quicker than the lift. He didn’t even bother with the odd expressions the other Healers and Medistaff he encountered on the way up to the fifth floor. He finally made it to the fifth-floor landing and saw Bellatrix and Kieran also bolting into Harry’s room. He took a deep breathe and ran into Harry’s room. He saw Kieran bent down examining the child.
Harry could smell the potion and it smelled heavily of a vegetable garden. He took a small sip in case he had issues with the taste, he found it to taste of spinach. He quickly downed the rest of the potion realizing it was at least tolerable.
Bellatrix vanished the phial like she did the one from earlier. “I’ll try and remember that flavor for next time.”
“Thanks for telling me about them.” Harry said looking at the wall sadly. It felt like that news just made him feel worse. His mother loved him, and he wasn’t a burden to them or the worst decision of his life. He should have never believed Petunia after all it wasn’t like she was kind to him, why would she even bother to tell him the truth about his parents.
Regulus could see the fear setting onto Harry’s face and in his eyes once Bellatrix and Kieran left the room. “I get it. Most children hate the idea of me. Just because you are considering talking to me doesn’t make you crazy or any other variation of that word.” He also hated the word crazy and all the variations of the word. There was nothing wrong with needing someone to talk to and to help process the trauma that had occurred.
“After learning the damage to his left wrist, I convinced Harry to let me perform an in-depth full body health scan on him to check for other signs of abuse.” Kieran said grabbing the parchment and making a copy for Vivienne and Andromeda. “As you can see from his health scan, he has severe injuries which Harry confirms were caused by child abuse.
Next chapter will be the meeting with Regulus, Andromeda, and Tom Riddle's wife. :)
“Not as interesting as yours. Oh, Dumbledore was quite irate when I told him he’d be waiting around a little longer.” Grant said grabbing the phial of potion he just poured and leaving the room.
Bellatrix rose from the place on the stretcher and went to read Kieran’s note on the dosage of pain potion Harry should receive. ‘
“That is the question.” Bellatrix teased standing up from the bed to make up the potion Kieran mentioned. “Blue Raspberry again?”
Bellatrix walked into the room carrying the phials of pain potion and peace potion. She sat down the pain potion down on the counter next to her. “I’ve contacted both Andromeda and Regulus about your case and to hopefully set up a meeting.” She sat down on the edge of the stretcher and grabbed the dark blue peace potion.
Bellatrix sighed once they were safely out of earshot. “I hate this. How could anyone do that to a child.” She said angrily. “Now Dumbledore will try to interfere because he’s a bloody imbecile and thinks child abuse is never as bad and it is the child making things up. I swear he is the worst Headmaster.”
“Harry.” Kieran sighed slightly curious about the liver issue. “You mentioned Paracetamol earlier, what is the typical dose you take?” He asked knowing that Paracetamol could overtime cause liver damage which ultimately could lead to liver failure.
“I think I’m going to see if I can get him to eat a piece of Shepherd’s Pie and maybe some dessert pie.” He teased determined to make sure Harry had a decent dinner before he slept for the night. “Thank you for offering to make another shake for him. He really enjoyed the first one.”
Andromeda was equally as terrifying when it came to child abuse. When the two paired up on a case, well it never ended well for the abuser of the child. When she received Bellatrix’s missive regarding the abuse case of Harry J. Potter, she figured Vivienne would love to accompany her with the case; not to mention when you put their two minds together, they were terrifying. Then again two Slytherin’s that felt the same way regarding child abuse were a forced to be reckoned with.
Kieran nodded and walked over to the cabinetry on the other side of the room. He pulled out a lime green blanket from the heating cabinet and draped it over Harry’s small body. “I know this a lot, but you are being very brave.”
It was truly magical that Harry was somehow alive after everything he had gone through and this was just the tip of the health scan.
“Rubus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; of course, Harry should know all about Hogwarts. My how you’ve grown.” Hagrid said smiling at Dudley. “I remember when you were just a wee baby.”
“Two years I’d be tired of my right hand.” Ron teased as the elevator took them to the second floor, home of the Magical Law Enforcement offices and the cubical farm, as he usually referred to it.
“Actually, they aren’t. Which you wouldn’t know that a patient you oversaw is now being tended to by two off duty St. Mungo’s employees.” He said bitterly to Umbridge before turning his attention to the other Medistaff also sitting around.
Bellatrix waved her wand in search of the file expecting it to land gracefully in her outstretched hand; but the only file that came was of Lily Potter, obviously the mention of Harry’s birth. “Well, he isn’t in the system. I was able to find the notes of his birth.” She said holding up the small folder not that the chart notes of his birth almost eleven years ago were helpful. “I’ll go have Grant talk to Hagrid about what he might know, might as well figure out what we can before Dumbledore shows up and tries to hinder everything. You know how he can be.”
Unbeknownst to Dumbledore Harry Potter was in his new room on the fifth floor, far away from Accident and Emergency and Dumbledore’s prying.
Harry raised an eyebrow listening to Draco’s muttering. He knew it couldn’t have been easy for the Slytherin, but he didn’t realize people were still harping on the war. He was still fucked up from the war, but he told no one about his constant night terrors, his mild addiction to the Dreamless Sleep potion, or the fact that he had to cast ‘Muffliato’ in fear of his screaming waking up Teddy. “I got hit with Cruciatus curse for a minute before Neville was able to stun Yaxley. I also got hit with several Bombarda Curses. It feels like a Hippogriff is doing a gig on top of my chest.” Harry admitted honestly. “I also think my wrist might be broken.”
“Thank you both.” Regulus remarked hoping it would be easy for Harry after a few days after all his injuries were properly healed and Regulus was able to have a few sessions with Harry to talk about Andromeda and Vivienne. “If you do find things out from Mrs. Gray and if a prior investigation was conducted, could you please forward them to me?” He asked politely wanting to know exactly what Mrs. Gray might have seen.
Kieran placed the cap back onto the tub of paste and pulled off his gloves. “Give that a few moments to sink into your burn and I’ll pull your blanket back up.” He pulled off the gloves and the disappeared into the air. He heard a small pop and looked over to see a large portion of Shepherd’s Pie and a steaming roll. “If you eat all your dinner, I have someone bringing you a surprise for dessert.”
Harry sighed and reluctantly got up from the breakfast bar, he didn’t want to go to work he could already hear Theseus’s disappointed lecture and knew that today would be spent in his cubical writing report after report, along with meeting after meeting over the remaining Death Eaters. Sometimes he wished that he could do something else career wise, sure he loved when there was a raid and another Death Eater was placed behind bars, but the waiting and constant meetings ignored him to his core. He followed the blue haired boy and found himself staring at the fireplace remembering the first time he flooed and landed arse first in Borgin and Burke’s and watched as Draco and Lucius tried selling something.
“Wait what?” Harry questioned pulling him wrist back from the healer wondering how they were family. His parents had died in a car accident and he was sent to his Aunt Petunia due to having no other living family.
“Alright, I’ll be back with your meds.” She gave her husband a silent nod letting him know that she understood what type of potion and the dosage Harry was to receive. She left the room and instantly felt a paper airplane note poking against her hand. She grabbed the note and noticed an owl staring at her an envelope attached to her leg. She petted the owl and grabbed the envelope, which was written in her sisters’ elegant penmanship, it also had the Ministry wax seal for the Department of Magical Child Endangerment and Abuse or the DMCEA for short.
“Severus is well, I’ll have to send him the information that Nymphadora the holy terror misses him. I can’t say he’ll feel the same way.” Regulus said grateful for Andromeda’s light family teasing before getting into the hard part of discussing Harry’s case and what the plan was. He would love to see the case go before a trial of the Wizengamot and see the Muggles get the punishment they deserved.
She sighed softly and took a large gulp of her wine hoping for some liquid courage since she didn’t know how Kieran would take her idea. She figured he’d understand her reasoning; but at the same time, he was kind of a stickler for rules and while she was a Black and his family, she had also been his Mediwitch which was kind of a grey area with St. Mungo’s Policies. But Regulus was his mind healer and while she knew that Severus would happily adopt Harry, Regulus couldn’t do to the policies; and she didn’t think Andromeda wanted more children since Nymphadora was out of Hogwarts and was in training to become an Auror. So, family wise that left her and Narcissa; and while Narcissa wanted more children she figured with Harry’s being Draco’s mate they might want both to have some space.
Harry sighed and met Bellatrix’s brown eyes. “Promise?”
Harry grabbed the blanket and pulled it up to his chin. “Thank you.” He muttered rolling to his side and cuddling the dragon plush.
Harry watched Ron he felt the same way about the mountain load of paperwork. “Just four more hours their lad and then this day will be over and we all have the day off tomorrow since we now on suspension and all.” He was looking forward to staying out late with Draco and then spending most of the day with Teddy.
Ever since leaving Hogwarts Neville had ditched most of the baby weight and was rather handsome. His teeth finally straightened out and he grew into his ears, they were now proportional to his head and since the battle he grew to become good with magic, and while never considered to be much of a close friend at Hogwarts he was now.
Harry chose to throw up from apparating and just barely missed Bellatrix’s sneakers. “It’s alright kiddo.” Bellatrix banished the sick from the floor with a simple wave of her wand. “We’ll get you all fixed up.”
Harry sighed and buried his face in his hands he could only nod at Kieran’s two questions. “Yes, to both.” The words were barely above a whisper.
“I saw the report from St. Mungo’s on my desk, so who wants to explain how my three best Auror’s managed to get made by one Death Eater, the three of you should have been able to detain him and bring him in, instead one of you gets sent to the hospital, the other leaves a note on my desk about a failed raid, and the other prefers to remain quiet. I want Yaxley captured this year, I am sick of this.” Scamander roared wishing he could fire the lot, but he couldn’t since they were usually better than this. They weren’t called the Golden Auror Trio for nothing.
Bellatrix grabbed her wand from her scrub pants and unlocked Regulus’s office. She turned to look at her husband and sighed indigently before sitting on the couch in the room. Her magic felt like it wanted to break something and she herself wanted to strangle muggles. “He’s Elara’s age!” She exclaimed loudly hearing the books on the bookshelf shake with her rage. She didn’t understand how anyone could do that to a child, any child regardless of what was in their blood.
“Thank you.” Kieran told his wife politely watching her set the small file on Lily’s birth on the counter. He gently placed Harry down on the stretcher and he sat down on the stool next to the left side of the bed. “So, it is the left wrist correct?” Kieran questioned gently lifting Harry’s jumper sleeve up so he could get a better look at the injury.
Harry stepped out of the shower his back feeling slightly better, but he was still rather sore so he popped two Paracetamol into his mouth swallowed them. He would almost rather be heading to detention with Snape than getting ready for work, since he knew today would be a day full of questions and paperwork. He shoved his contacts into his eyes, he had always hated his glasses and unlike with his glasses he didn’t worry about breaking his contacts. He sighed walking over to his closet pulling out his black Auror robes and a navy blue dress shirt, brown boots, and pair of well-fitting grey trousers. He placed his wand in the dedicated wand pocket and bend down to tie his boots.
“Just a sec and how many would like to see the mayor?” She asked.
Harry sighed he agreed with Neville that he didn’t want to deal with the reports. “She diagnosed me with a broken wrist, punctured lung, and three broken ribs, she also gave me a potion to stop the Cruciatus Curse aftereffects. It could have been a lot worse.” He admitted tossing his coffee cup in the rubbish bin. “Now let’s just get this day over with.”
Harry just shook his head in shame as he flopped ungracefully into his seat. He saw the report from St. Mungo’s over his injuries laying on his desk he flipped though it knowing Theseus got the same report. He was glad that it was devoid of Malfoy’s name, that was the last thing he needed to explain today.
“This is blue raspberry and a Draught of Peace it is going to help keep you calm while Kieran does an in-depth health scan on you.” She handed the phial to the child and watched him chug it in one go.
“I’m Harry.” Harry said meekly from his spot on the floor. He grabbed his glasses; it wasn’t like he could see that great with them. They were something Petunia had picked up from a rummage sale after one of his primary school teachers had told Petunia that he had a hard time seeing the blackboard.
“I do. Knowing the full extent of your case will make it easier for me to testify and get you justice for those that hurt you. I swear on Hekate herself. Would you like me to contact my husband, Severus, to sit with you? He remembers you and I’m sure he’d be happy to see and sit with you while I coordinate with the rest of your care team. I understand if you don’t and just want to be alone too.”
“Your late.” Hermione muttered tapping her high heeled foot impatiently her robe for Wizard Family Services firmly pressed and buttoned around a purple fit and flare dress.
“Of course I remember. Hello boys.” She teased politely sitting down on one other wingback chairs. “I just wish it was a different situation.”
Vernon and Petunia came running down the stairs with Vernon holding a gun. “Who the hell are you?” Vernon exclaimed pointing the gun at the giant that had broken down the cabin door.
“The person we talked to earlier mentioned he was your guardian but couldn’t supply paperwork; proving he was, and Grant just told me he had just signed it. We are going to move you to keep you protected. I doubt he has an evil intention toward you; but we at St. Mungo’s and the Ministry’s Department of Magical Child Endangerment and Abuse takes cases like yours quite seriously. So, until he hands over the paperwork, we plan on keeping you away from him.” Bellatrix explained to both Harry and Kieran.
“I guess.” Harry eyed the man curiously. “I’m Harry Potter.”
Draco laughed softly at Harry. “I’m just a really great Healer.” He teased with a wink.
“Mm better the bubblegum.” He remarked sighing when she mentioned contacting the people, he wished he didn’t have to talk to. He wanted the help of getting rid of the abuse and getting justice for everything he had endured for almost ten years.
“Thanks.” Harry said greedily snatching the spoon from the table and digging into the sundae dripping hot fudge everywhere it was clear that Grant did not go easy on the hot fudge. He let the vanilla ice cream and hot fudge melt into his mouth the flavors dancing happily over his tastebuds. He had heard of the hot fudge sundae, but he had never been able to eat one. It was something Petunia would get Dudley on special occasions; but as usual he was left to starve.
Harry grumbled feeling his wand alarm going off under his pillow. “Stupid thing.” He cursed turning the blasted thing off. He rubbed his eyes the dreams of last night coming back to him, obviously, the Dreamless Sleep wasn’t working like it once did, he figured it was probably time to up the dosage. He looked at the clock on his bedside table seeing that is was 7:00 am. He sighed wishing he could just call in sick, but he knew that Theseus would appear in his living room demanding a full report. That man seriously had no boundaries when it came to his job. He would never forget the time he was sick and Theseus appeared wondering where the hell his Auror was, it didn’t seem to matter that he was literately barfing up his guts. He sighed wandering his way to the bathroom to let the shower sooth his sore muscles and to wake him up.
“Your soulmate is my nephew.” Bellatrix exclaimed. “That makes you family.” She said softly running her nails gently through Harry’s hair. “We’d appreciate it if you stopped pulling your wrist away from us, it makes it harder for us to examine it.”
“Let me get this straight, Hagrid and Minerva can stay, and you are escorting me out; because I can’t provide documentation regarding what I say is true?”
“Thank you.” Harry muttered grabbing Lily, the dragon plush, he had officially named her after his mother. He liked the name when Regulus said it and found it suited the dragon plush. He reached for the edge of the blanket and pulled it up around him. “Sleep well.” He hoped he didn’t have to bother the nice adults during the night.
Bellatrix grabbed a blue potion and uncorked the phial. “This is more pain receptor blocking potion that way you can get a proper night’s rest not feeling anything hurt or ache.” She handed the child the potion and watch his eyebrows raise. “I remembered you liked Blue Raspberry.” She teased softly taking the empty phial back.
“Coming right up.” Bellatrix winked at the child and then walked to the door to see what Grant wanted and to get Harry a protein shake, and a basic nutrient potion for children, and the appetite booster. “Walk with me, was just about to get the kiddo a shake for lunch and grab some potions.”
“This wasn’t the first break to your wrist, was it?” Kieran asked his blue eyes meeting Harry’s scared green ones. “If there is something going on with your home life, we can help you.”
The happy couple entered through one of the green St. Mungo’s fireplaces and emerged gracefully in their large home in Croydon which was a borough of London. Their home had recently been redone and was a seven bedroom and five bedroom house along with an indoor swimming pool right next to the house. “How about a glass of wine and a quick soak in the hot tub while I talk about my idea?” Bellatrix suggested kicking of her sneakers which disappeared back to her shoe rack in the closet thanks to a house elf.
“Seriously Ron I’m tempted to ask Padma to charm your wedding ring so that every time you ask if a girl is pretty that your wedding ring will heat up and remind you that you are married.” Hermione said an evil glint in her eye.
Kieran internally cursed Merlin at Harry’s admittance. Harry was almost eleven and the typical dose of Paracetamol was for twelve to adults and given Harry’s malnutrition and the fact he looked about eight it was no wonder his liver was now damaged. “Harry you are in the middle stages of liver damage which often leads to liver failure. Don’t worry it is nothing to worry about, magic will be able to fix it.”
“Seven?” Vivienne asked making sure she heard Kieran correctly.
Ron shook his head glad that Harry was getting back into the dating pool. “I look forward to hearing more about this date, I too have news of my own.” He said grabbing his coffee order and paying. He sat down beside Harry. “Padma and I are expecting.”
Draco yawned as he finished his paperwork for the night, it was only an hour later than he was supposed to be off so he considered it to be a win. He stumbled his way to the line of fireplaces so he could join his mother for a glass of wine and then floo his arse to his penthouse to promptly pass out from the long exhausting day. He stumbled out of Andromeda’s fireplace and into the sun room where Narcissa greeted him with a glass of French wine.
“Why does somebody have a crush?” Harry teased he certainly had a crush, a crush on Draco Malfoy. Shite he had almost forgotten about his plans with Draco later tonight, it might have only been drinks as a thank you for saving his arse, but for some reason Harry was looking forward to it. What was wrong with him it was only drinks it wasn’t like they were going to a fancy five-star restaurant. It would be just like getting drinks with Ron and Neville after work, but instead of them it was a hot blonde healer. His mind reminded him.
“You could always skip the pie and I can make up another shake this time without the extra protein. Since he enjoyed my first one this time. Oh, what about a hot fudge sundae? Never met a child that didn’t love those.” Grant suggested happily.
Draco frowned at the mention of Percy, sometimes he felt as if it would have been better had it been him who had died in the battle. “Do you miss my insults, Potter?” He sneered. “Do try and stay out of trouble. So, what time would be best for you tomorrow?” He asked glad that there was still a chance with Harry Potter.
Regulus scribbled down the information about Dumbledore and Ginevra Weasley on his notepad before turning his attention back to the chart the bile rising in his throat seeing the sheer number of previous injuries. He read all the details regarding the MTBI’s, PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and about threw up when he read that the young child had a Brain Aneurysm.
“Considering she suggested a muggle bar I’m not too worried about her using me for my fame, besides she’s only 22. Tatiana is her name, and before any of you ask yes, she is blonde and very pretty. Now since I know very little about her, I would appreciate saving all of your questioned until after the date.” He said flatly ordering his usual coffee, glad that he come up with an alibi.
“No Harry it wasn’t a dream. You are at a wizarding hospital and they can’t hurt you.” Bellatrix said running a flannel under the tap. She sat on the other side of the bed gently bumping her shoulder against Kieran. She gently placed the cold flannel against Harry’s glistening forehead.
“I’m only going to say this once. I am a Mind Healer, and I am here when I should be asleep. A patient has a Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm, so you are going to talk to me or I’m going to lodge a formal investigation into tonight. Your choice.” He said flatly.
He did think Draco was quite handsome, but there was no chance of that happening. Draco was probably straighter than an arrow, besides he could just picture the headlines The Daily Prophet could come up with if he ever did get together with Draco. It was safer with everyone thinking the Savior was straight. Besides he had yet to meet anyone who could stand sleeping next to Harry when he was having his nightmares. His brain was truly fucked since the battle. He was damaged goods and he didn’t want to subject anyone to that. He was also trying to raise a seven-year-old Teddy Lupin, since after all he was once an orphan due to war and he didn’t want Teddy to deal with the same things he had to deal with growing up. He didn’t know of many guys who would be cool with a seven-year-old kid; even if he wasn’t biologically Harry’s. He did however consider Teddy to be his son.
Trix, I’m finishing up with my last patient before lunch. I’ll see you at 1pm or a few moments sooner.
A loud ‘thud’ at the wooden door brought him out of his thoughts. He thought about waking up Vernon or Petunia but figured he’d only get in trouble for waking them and after all it was probably a bird accidently running into the door.
“That sounds marvelous. You get the wine I’ll go turn on the hot tub.” He suggested walking over to the sliding glass door and opened it, the sliding glass door led out to their back patio and the indoor swimming pool structure. He loved the pool, but he did not want to smell chlorine as he drifted off to sleep so they had decided to keep the pool and hot tub in a separate structure.
Adrien sighed wondering how the hell someone not even Hogwarts age already had a Brain Aneurysm with several MTBI’s on top of it. “Abuse?” He questioned looking at the parchment scan that Kieran had handed him. He found the Aneurysm easily enough it was in the Frontal Lobe close to the Motor Cortex it looked like a straightforward Aneurysm. “Were you hoping I’m free to do it now?” He questioned he had a surgery in a few moments.
“You mentioned I was being moved?” Harry questioned eyeing the shake sitting on the counter that looked to have some sort of white topping on it.
She opened the paper airplane note first figuring it was from Regulus regarding a time he was free to speak to Harry about Mind Healing. She saw that he would be down around 1pm to speak to them and Harry. She waved her wand and watch the note from Regulus destroy itself after all it did contain information about a patient.
Harry didn’t feel the usual pain he felt when a Healer reinflated his lung, it had to have been the pain potion and not Draco’s healing abilities. Merlin, he almost had to admit that Malfoy was easily one of the better healers that had ever attended to his injuries. “That surprisingly doesn’t hurt.” Harry admitted gritting his teeth like that statement physically hurt to say.
“What did you learn from Grant about the boy?” She asked knowing Kieran would find a few of the things she had discovered interesting.
“I thought you’d like to know that Albus Dumbledore just signed in at the Welcome Witch, he has apparently cut himself and needs healing. If you want my opinion that cut is so basic he could take care of it himself. I didn’t know if you wanted to move the kid, I get the feeling Dumbledore’s sudden healing need coincides with the meeting you and Healer Reid had with him. I didn’t want you to not know and have Dumbledore trying to sniff around the room. Can I help you with anything?”
“Will Victorie be there?” He questioned.
“But before that you have you more potions.” Bellatrix said grabbing the phial of Appetite Booster from the counter. “These are the exact same potions you had with lunch. This is the Appetite Booster.” She pulled the cork off the phial and handed the phial to the child.
“It went well, I’m going to head to bed.” Harry said heading to his master bedroom for some Dreamless Sleep and downed the phial. He knew from first year potions that you weren’t supposed to take them after having alcohol but he didn’t care he needed sleep. He pulled out his contacts sticking them in their container by his bed and flopped his head against the pillow.
Graham politely knocked at the doorway. “Uh Healer Reid, Headmaster Dumbledore would like to speak to you and Mrs. Reid.”
Dudley saw Harry inspecting the mail and snatched it out of Harry’s hand and pushed Harry into a nearby wall. “Dad, the freak has a letter.” Dudley screamed handing the letter to his father the rest of the mail stack forgotten on a nearby shelf, after all it was just the bills and Vernon’s check from Grunnings.
“I will see you guys tomorrow.” Harry yawned wishing he could have a quick nap before joining Draco for drinks, but alas it was nearly six and the last thing he wanted to do was piss off Malfoy, although a pissed off Malfoy might have been good in bed.
“We should probably go get our arse handed to us by Theseus.” Ron suggested finishing the rest of his coffee. “I don’t think we will see the field for quite a while.”
Draco listened to Harry’s bitter admittance of his healing abilities. “I had a great training program, and you are a surprisingly compliant patient, you haven’t screamed or tried to hex me once.” Draco teased laying a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Can I get you to turn on your side, it will allow me to get to your injured ribs.” He helped Harry into a moderately comfortable position hearing the wince of pain.
Grant smirked knowing he’d probably end up owning Bellatrix a few Gallons for that comment. “I’m sorry Headmaster. Healer Reid is one of the few Senior Healers we have on staff today and it is a busy day. I’m sure I’ll be able to find a suitable Healer for you.” He saw the flannel wrapped around Dumbledore’s hand and there was hardly any blood on the white flannel. Really, he could probably pull out his own wand and fix it with an Episky judging from the lack of blood.
“While are you doing that can you bring back a Draught of Peace potion and another pain potion for later?” Kieran suggested knowing the Draught of Peace would make the idea of the scan easier for the child it would also help sooth some of the obvious anxiety rolling of the child.
“Still not my boss, I was floated from spell damage. Lodge a complaint I don’t care. You aren’t my boss and I’ll probably never be back on this floor.”
“Nothing to apologize for Mrs. Riddle.” Regulus said flatly everyone in the room understood and that display would never be spoken about again.
Kieran gently lifted the blanket and unbuttoned the snaps on the gown. He scooped a small amount from the tub and gently rubbed the thick pink paste against the obnoxious burn on the child’s back. “I know it is cool, that would be the Aloe.”
Draco smiled looking over the menu quickly. “Well the French Revolution and the Avocolada were the two I had the last time Olivia and I came here, and they were both great. I think I might get the French Revolution again.” He suggested seeing a few new options from two weeks ago, when he last visited with Olivia.
Harry sat up and pulled his shirt back on and fought with his robes to lay the way he liked them to lay. He wished he could just wear jumpers and jeans to work and not the stupid robes they had to wear. He hit his head against the pillow trying dispel the thoughts he was having about a certain blonde healer. Damnit, it had been seven years since he had last seen Malfoy and all that he wanted to do was wrap his arms around Malfoy’s pale neck and kiss him. Like that would ever happen, it was Malfoy and he was Potter, or as Pansy loved to call him Potty.
Hi guys I hope you like this idea. Thank you for reading and any kudos, comments, and bookmarks. I really appreciate it. :)
Teddy woke up and ran to the kitchen knowing that Kreacher would have breakfast waiting on them both. “Morning Kreach.” He teased the elf who handed him a glass of orange juice.
“We know Molly was worried about my little accident yesterday that made me have a short detour to St. Mungo’s.” Harry explained as Ron landed hard on the floor behind him. “I swear that is third time this week that you have landed arse first out of the floor, you are worse than Teddy when it comes to the floo.” He teased helping the slightly irritated redhead from the floor as the four made their way to the cafeteria for tea.
“Would you like some tea?” Bellatrix suggested figuring that tea was a good enough excuse to have a conversation with Minerva. Besides, she’d rather take her chances in a locked cage with a Nundu then finish the conversation with Dumbledore.
Regulus was dressed simply in a medium blue Oxford with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a pair of grey chino pants that clung nicely to his athletic legs and a pair of brown loafers.
Second of all I'm sorry. I know I am the worst when it comes to updating my stories. 2021 has been a really rough year for me personally and I have to be in the right frame of mind to write these stories and I just haven't. I'd like to say I'll get better at updating but I can't. So what I will say is I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Sorry about Umbridge she kind of snuck into this story and I let her stay.
“Well in some ways it is just a stick.” Bellatrix teased the child knowing that Kieran’s exam would tell them if that wrist had been broken before and if they were right with their abuse assumption that wrist had been broken multiple times.
“Merlin’s Beard that man is persistent. I’ll talk to Kieran and see about moving Harry to another floor. Can you make me up a good chocolate protein shake? Heavy on the protein and chocolate.” She asked as she grabbed the two phials’ of already made nutrient and appetite stimulate potion. Those two potions were usually flavored already. The patients usually said it tasted of a salad in liquid form, and while children didn’t typically like vegetables, she’d try it once without the added flavor.
Draco laughed seeing his favorite drink on the menu. “I don’t suppose you’d like to split the Quesadilla or the salted pretzel?” He suggested needing something to sop up the impending liquor.
Harry took a sip of the Avocolada which tasted tropical. “That is good, and what about Pansy, Theo, Marcus, and Blaise?” He asked.
Harry handed Draco his wrist. “Go ahead, you are after all a healer.” He trusted Draco to heal him, besides in the thirty minutes Draco had been in his room he had nothing but be pleasant and polite. He knew deep down in his heart after seeing Malfoy that he did make the right decision seven years ago. Draco Malfoy had truly turned over a new leaf, and if was possible Harry liked this version of Malfoy, but was asking the healer out a risk he wanted to take. He could see the headline now The Boy Who Lived, in Relationship with Known Death Eater. Merlin this was certainly a version of torture, not quite as bad as the torture curse, but close.
“Great! I was just wondering when he’d show up.” Bellatrix said sarcastically from her spot on the exam bed. She figured they’d be eventually getting a visit from Dumbledore after Hagrid showed up with Harry.
Kieran gently held Harry’s wrist in his hand and ran his wand over the wrist seeing that the parchment with the automatic diagnostic quill going nuts at the previous damage to Harry’s left wrist. He raised an eyebrow towards Bellatrix at the quills quick scribbling against the parchment. He gently lifted the parchment from the table. “Your wrist is definitely broken.”
Bellatrix quickly grabbed the supplies needed to get an IV line into the child and handed them to her husband while she left the room to go get the necessary potions needed.
Bellatrix sighed and placed her wand back into her pocket once she saw Healer Burke exit the elevator. “Hello Healer Burke, let me show you to the room.”
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself at Dumbledore’s sudden switch in behavior it was something a Slytherin would do. The difference being is a Slytherin would have been able to manipulate the situation better.
“I’m sure Andromeda will appreciate Minerva’s testimony. Also in the event Dumbledore is truly Harry’s Magical Guardian it would be a step in the right direction of getting his rights to Harry revoked. Not to mention the Weasley conversation. Has Dumbledore not seen Harry’s soulmate mark, or is it some sort of Dumbledore fantasy that Harry marries a redhead like his mother?”
Draco hadn’t heard the name Yaxley in years, just hearing that name struck fear all the way into his loafers and left him with a slightly nauseous feeling. “I did become a Healer, I see you became an Auror.” He teased lightly wondering what made Harry become an Auror, he knew the Gryffindor had always loved Quidditch, and he would have thought after the war, Harry would have want to do something happy. “Are you alright with me being your healer?” He questioned figuring he’d ask before doing anything to Harry.
Kieran sighed and grabbed a pair of gloves hanging on the rack and the burn paste. He sat the burn paste on the bed and gently made his way to Harry’s head. “Sweetheart, I know you are tired and getting a proper rest is important, but it is now dinner, and we’d like for you to eat again.”
Kieran gently took Harry’s right arm and placed the IV and IV line into the arms. Harry’s skin was practically translucent which made putting an IV into a vein super easy.
A few angry thuds later and the solid wooden door was suddenly laying on the floor and where the door once stood, now stood a giant. Dudley bolted up from the couch at the sound of the door falling.
“You can pull it off, I can’t.” Harry said sipping his tea enjoying breakfast with his godson. “You better go get ready, otherwise you’ll make me late.” He said after sneaking a quick peak at the clock in the kitchen.
“Harry you injured?” The giant asked politely keeping the pink umbrella trained on Vernon and Petunia so that they couldn’t hurt the child again.
“I figured Andromeda would bring Vivienne.” Kieran remarked taking a sip of the tea the elf had brought him earlier.
“I am an Auror, and why wouldn’t I be okay with you as my healer?” Harry asked dumbly wondering why he wouldn’t be okay with Draco healing his wounds. Sure, Draco was a Death Eater at one point, but that was because of Draco’s father. If you wanted Harry’s opinion he thought Draco was just a misguided child wanting to please his father. It was obvious from what he was seeing that Draco had certainly changed his life around, and he was sort of pleasant when he wasn’t shooting insults at you.
Bellatrix grabbed a piece of parchment and wrote Regulus a quick note regarding the move.
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes at Malfoy, was it integrity possible that maybe underneath the blonde Malfoy hair lay a kind person? In the hour, Draco, had been attending his injuries he had been pleasant almost caring even.
Harry sighed angry with himself that he was even considering the idea of meeting with a shrink. He wanted to hate Kieran and Bellatrix the last time he trusted someone who had promised him help didn’t go well at all if anything the abuse got worse that year. So why did a part of him want to trust these people and talk about what Vernon, Dudley, and Petunia had done to him.
Regulus could see the brain hamsters turning in their wheels in Harry’s mind. “What are you thinking about?” He asked curiously figuring he might be able to offer the child a suggestion or some adult guidance. “I promise everything you tell me is safe.”
“That’s better I thought you were trying to give me grey hair.” Harry complained ticking him the room being filled with Teddy’s laughter, what Harry wouldn’t give to be Teddy’s age and the only thing he had to worry about was rather or not a certain blonde Weasley would also be there.
Bellatrix smiled at the child who was curled up under a few blankets looking smaller than he should. “I have meds and news about Regulus and Andromeda.” She sat down on the bed and handed Harry the potion. “You might feel a little groggy after the potion. It’s normal and you are free to take a little nap while we talk to Dumbledore.” Regulus will be in around 1pm to talk to you and Andromeda will meet with you at 2pm.” She told Harry and Kieran.
“I guess. You said you are on my side right and that you want to help me?” Harry asked breathlessly worried that he would lose the small amount of courage he had left.
Harry gently took the phial from her black colored fingernails and downed the liquid in one go. It tasted like it did earlier. Not great but it was tolerable. He could see the steam coming off the dinner. He wouldn’t lie he didn’t know the last time he had a hot meal and that Shepherd’s Pie looked appetizing.
Ron smiled glad that Harry was doing better. “I’m glad you are feeling well enough to come to work, I uh actually had some really good news to tell you and Hermione. He had promised Padma to keep it a secret but he was telling his two best friends this news. He grabbed his robes from the back of a chair and put it on haphazardly and didn’t bother to button it, besides the moment he got into the Auror offices it would be draped over his office chair anyway. It was the most annoying thing about being an Auror.
“Use the excuse Kieran is one of the few Senior Level Healers around and that is why his request is denied. Although the idea of her husband giving the Headmaster some muggle stitches amused her greatly. Hell, you can probably ask the Welcome Witch to cast a simple Episkey at Dumbledore.” She teased softly walking away from the station the wheelchair following her.
Bellatrix sighed internally poor kid had already been let down once before. “Harry.” She tilted his chin to meet her warm brown eyes. “My sister, Andy, is a social worker for The Ministry of Magic. Harry, we don’t like seeing child abuse. I understand that it isn’t easy to talk about and that the system has failed you once before but that was the muggle system; the magical system has a different way of handling things.”
Andromeda rolled her blue eyes knowing that he was lying. “Just be careful please.” She said getting off the couch to hug him tightly. “I’ll see you soon.” She said hugging her grandchild. “Remember that I love you both.” She watched Harry lead Teddy into the fireplace and the two disappear into green smoke.
Although a cut was hardly something to bother the skilled staff with St. Mungo’s with. That was something Poppy Pomphrey could handle. Bellatrix had personally assisted with the removal of an elephant trunk before. A parchment cut was something that could be treated with a salve or a quick ‘Episkey’. She personally thought that if anyone could feel it with a basic charm that most students learned in Year 2.  Oh well she figured one of the Student Healers would be more than pleased to fix Dumbledore’s cut.  She touched her wand to the wheelchair so that it would follow her.
“Adrien Burke. Regulus said he was good and was a Slytherin with Regulus. He was a little short with me; but if he helps with Harry’s Aneurysm, he could be an arse for all I care.”
“Hello Harry.” Hagrid said bending down to Harry’s level and smiling at him. “Yer a wizard, same as your parents; and Hogwarts is a special school for wizards and witches to learn.”
“I’m tempted to suggest you make one for me.” She joked. “That looks exactly like something Florean Fortescue would whip up himself.”
“You know Dumbledore will say something along the lines of it happened under a different Minister and how was he supposed to foresee that it would happen.” Bellatrix muttered hearing rustling in the bed beside them. She knew their conversation didn’t disturb him; she had personally cast a silencing charm around the bed.
Draco grabbed his wand and moved Harry’s arm above his head as he traced over the injured ribs with his wand, a soft purple glow healing the ribs. “Your all done, fair warning you might be a little tender for the next couple of days, and I would recommend you staying out of the field until the ribs are fully healed.” He warned not wanting to see Potter back in St. Mungo’s anytime soon, although he was secretly enjoying the view of Potter’s abs. “If for any reason your ribs still bother you some Paracetamol should help with the soreness. I’ll go get your discharged papers ready.” He told the Auror disposing of the potion bottles and leaving the room with a slight yawn. He forgot how much healing could take out of him.
“Shift change will be happening soon, and Bellatrix and I will be off duty. We will leave our badge numbers with the mediwitch or Mediwizard you get in case you need us. We will see you in the morning; but before that let’s go ahead and get a few more potions into you.”
“That dragon is an Antipodean Opaleye. They are usually found in New Zealand and occasionally Australia. Most Witches and Wizards consider them to be the most beautiful dragon since their scales have a pearlescent sheen and their eyes are multicolored that glitter in the light and unlike some other dragons isn’t particularly aggressive.” Regulus explained watching as the child held onto every word and taking a mental note of the politeness.
“Did you just say Padma is pregnant?” Hermione squealed at the idea of Ron having children. “Congratulations, I’m sure Padma is excited.”
“Never had it.”
Kieran thumbed through the paperwork and looked at his wife. “Yes.” He placed the parchment back into the folder after charming it so only he or Bellatrix could read it.
“I don’t see why I would need to provide that. I am Harry’s Magical Guardian; he was placed with muggles. I or a Hogwarts Head of House will take over Magical Guardianship of the muggle child until they reach seventeen. Since Harry has yet to be sorted that makes me his Magical Guardian.”
Harry opened both of his eyes and stared at the man. “I’m not in pain!” He exclaimed it felt like he was always in pain. “Why am I not in pain?”
Umbridge walked into the room of the ill child and turned on the light and saw an offensive toy he was snuggling. “Wake up brat!” She demanded grabbing the plush toy from the child. She personally felt that anyone who was on this floor did not get to enjoy a comfort such as blankets or toys. In her mind they were the sort who needed to be banished from wizarding society.
“Then we’ll dose them both with a 24-hour height potion.” Ron smirked. “So, what do you think my mates? It’ll be fun the three of us plus Fred, George, Victorie, and Teddy.
“Alright you don’t have to.” Bellatrix knew that reaction from previous patients that the child was certainly hiding something nasty under the oversized jumper and didn’t want the questions.
Bellatrix and Kieran Reid had just arrived for their shift in accident and emergency and Bellatrix had just put down her work bag and was pulling up her wild hair with a hair tie and a grey and black leopard headband when she heard the loud ‘crack’ of an apparition. She saw that Kieran had looked up from the patient file he was just reading at the sound.
“You just want to see my abs.” Harry snarked sticking his tongue at the healer as he slowly pulled off his shirt just to torment Draco only to wince in pain.
Kieran laughed softly to himself at Dumbledore calling him a slimy snake. “I was an Ravenclaw. I do believe that Ravenclaw’s mascot is an eagle and not a snake. Again, you are free to wait around in the waiting room but until we see official documentation with either a Ministry or Gringotts seal we can’t provide you with any information regarding the case.” He said flatly tired of repeating himself about the documentation.
“I’m game.” Neville said he could go for a day at a theme park, besides Hermione would be at work.
Grant waited until Kieran, Bellatrix, and the child in the wheelchair disappeared in the direction of the elevators before summoning Dumbledore’s chart and going out to the busy waiting room. He found the bearded wizard sitting in the same chair he was in earlier. “Headmaster, I’d like to apologize for the wait. It’s been a busy day for accidents and emergencies.
Harry burst out into laughter at Draco. “I am not trying to seduce you.” He said hissing in pain at the laughter. “See what you did, you made me laugh and hurt myself further.” He pouted crossing his arms over his chest.
“So, you just think I’m crazy?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the Irish man. His left tucked protectively under his armpit.
Grant knocked at the door and poked his head into the room. “Healer Reid do you have a moment?” He asked politely figuring Kieran would like to know the information Hagrid had provided about the child.
Harry again took the green potion from her hand and quickly downed the potion. Again, it tasted of various vegetables with just a hint of dirt. It wasn’t terrible; he could think of so many things that tasted worse. Dudley’s dirty gym socks stuffed into his mouth was a great example. He was fairly sure those socks were washed once a year. He handed the phial back to Bellatrix and sat up in the bed glad to not feel any pain when he moved his legs. He figured the lack of pain was only temporary but even a few days without feeling like everything ached was incredible.
“I don’t care.” Harry said after swallowing the large Paracetamol tablets the idea of the medication being liquid was great. He didn’t even care if it wasn’t flavored it was much easier to get down.
A day had passed and soon the family of three and the freak found themselves in a cabin in the middle of a lake; because the letters had grown progressively more persistent to the point that Vernon was finding the letters in the French Press. Harry was looking at the foggy window and rubbing at his broken wrist. Dudley was fast asleep; but the pain was keeping him awake and, in the rush, he forgot to pack the Paracetamol. He looked down at the name and ran his finger over the dragons. He wondered why the dragons and what Draco was like. It had to be a joke right, dragons didn’t exist, and were often associated with fairy tales.
Regulus gingerly took the chart from Kieran’s outstretched hand and opened the chart.
“It’s going to be a good morning.” Bellatrix teased her husband as she walked over the giant that had just landed. “Hagrid?” She questioned wondering why Hagrid was in the accident and emergency ward. “What’s going on?”
“No.”
“No.” Harry pulled his knees closer to his chest to prevent her from prying off his clothes and seeing the bruises and scars lining his body. “Please no.”
Typically, most magical creatures couldn’t apparate into the exam rooms of accident and emergency but for some reason Hagrid did. Usually, the visit at St. Mungo’s started out in the waiting room and a chat with the Welcome Witch about what was going on ailment wise. The Welcome Witch would also typically find the proper chart on the patient before they were seen by the medical staff.
Kieran stood up from the stool. “We will be back soon.”
Harry watched the exuberant seven-year-old bolt up the stairs he was beginning to think Teddy liked the Weasley’s more than he did Andromeda, he figured their house was more fun than playing with his grandma. He understood he always did like spending time at The Weasley Burrow especially if the twins were there. He figured Teddy was the same way, he knew the twins were probably already filling him full of bad ideas to enact once he got to Hogwarts. Nymphadora, according to her mother, was quite a little hellion during her time at Hogwarts. Both hoped that Teddy would turn out to be more like Remus and not so much like Nymphadora.
“I found the dragon in the trash and Umbridge refuses to answer my questions about what happened before we got back here.” Regulus explained gently lifting Harry’s arm and placing the cleaned plush toy back in his arms.
Harry took the quill and looked over the discharge papers and smiled at the blonde healer. “Thank you for taking care of me.” He signed the paper in his signature messy handwriting that Hermione was always on him about. He didn’t really care about his handwriting it was at legible at least.
She had said almost ten years ago that the Dursley’s were terrible muggles and that Harry should have been placed with anyone else and now ten years later when it was finally time for the boy to attend Hogwarts, she learns that he was admitted to St. Mungo’s after Dumbledore sent Hagrid of all people to talk to Vernon and Petunia about the lack of response to the acceptance letter and school list.
Bellatrix emerged in a light purple scoop bikini with a bow in the middle of her chest and holding two stemless wine glasses with a red in both. She sat the two glasses of wine on the ledge and got into the hot tub which was the perfect temperature. She took a seat in her husband’s lap and gently kissed his cheek forever grateful that this was the person Hekate decided was her perfect match.
“Yes, you’ll have to tell us how it goes tomorrow.” Neville said grabbing Hermione’s hand as they stepped into the fireplace together.
“Possibly, do you remember the last time I had a date their mate? I do it was about two years ago, and I scared her off by mentioning I had a five-year-old at home.” Harry said leaving off the part where he sometimes frequented muggle gay clubs to get some sexual satisfaction. It might have been two years since his last relationship, but it certainly hadn’t been two years since he last gotten any. It was just easier in the muggle world to have a one night stand and not have that leaked all over The Daily Prophet.
“A friend who works at London Grace as a nurse, she’s one of my closest friends since moving back. He said getting out of his seat to place their order to the bartender. “She’s the one who introduced me to this place, I like it because it’s quiet and not a lot of people know about it.” He said as the bartender brought over the two drinks and the jumbo salted pretzel with a large bowl of cheese.
“Patient unresponsive.” He muttered tossing on a pair of black marled joggers and a bottle green tee shirt. He quickly toed on a pair of sneakers.  Regulus hoped his gut was wrong and the child just collapsed and that the aneurysm hadn’t ruptured. He ran down the stairs two at a time before grabbing a handful of floo. The last thing he saw was his husband’s kind eyes full of concern.
Kieran looked at Regulus and then pulled his wife tightly into his chest to keep her magic from once again trying to destroy something. “Regulus how do you think the child is mentally?” He wondered running a soothing hand down his wife’s back.
“Fuck!” He muttered not only was the child reluctant to trust therapy but had large list of mental health that needed to be addressed before it started to cause life changing issues for the child. He ran his left hand along the nape of his neck. He quickly looked over the parchment on potions given and saw that they had given the potion to block the pain receptors so that he could rest comfortably until he could be sedated and healed.
“He accepted of course, after pointing out that it wasn’t really necessary and that it looked like I had turned over a new leaf. I can’t believe that it has been over seven years since I left London.” He remarked thinking about his time in Boston and New York.
Regulus sighed internally and sat down in one of the empty computer chairs to draft a formal investigation into what happened after Kieran and Bellatrix left for the night and that is when he noticed something shiny catch his eye from the trash.
“Yes please.”
Regulus smiled and entered the room. “Hello Harry! I’m Healer Regulus Black-Snape. Do you mind if I have a seat?” He could feel brilliant green eyes watching his every move. He knew most children didn’t like the idea of talking to anyone about their problems.
“I think the salted pretzel sounds good, especially with the beer cheese.” Harry suggested figuring he’d need to eat something since he did plan on a three-drink limit, or less depending on how much of prat Draco was. “So, since you’ve been here before what do you recommend to drink?” He asked looking over the cocktail list not understanding a lot of the terms, he was used to Firewhisky.
“We also talked to Andromeda who is a social worker, and we have her looking into your life and anything she can find regarding your parents wills. She’ll also want to talk to you once you are fully healed. Every decision is entirely up to you right now.”
“Let me guess accident at work?” She said taking a small sip of the wine. “Are you still pinning after him? You know it wouldn’t kill you to ask him out on a date.”
“I expect better, now I want a detailed report from all of you about the failed raid, also you have all been temporally suspended from the field until I conduct my investigation into this raid. I would also like a copy of the memories of the failed raid. Now get out of my office.” He roared taking down the spell on his door watching the three adults slink out of his office like kicked puppies.
‘Dumbledore is a patient.’ Bellatrix mouthed picking up the green appetite boosting potion.
“Which is?” Bellatrix raised an eyebrow inquisitively at the child.
“One problem Victorie is five and is rather short for her age, Teddy on the other hand is tall for his age.” Harry reminded he did not want to spend a day dealing with kiddie rides.
“You aren’t drunk, maybe if you chugged both of your cocktails.” Draco smirked seeing Harry’s face. “Sure, we could try this again, I’m off tomorrow how does dinner sound at my place?” He suggested with a wink.
“I got sent to St. Mungo’s and saw your nephew.” Harry said politely taking a sip of the tea which was just the way he liked it. “Thank you for the tea.”
Regulus smiled softly at the child before standing up from the bed. “Just let me or Bellatrix know if you change your mind. It was nice meeting you; I just wish it were a different circumstance. Want me to adjust the blanket?” He asked not wanting Harry to get offended by his help. That was another thing he saw a lot of was children wanting to be independent and do things on their own. Even something as simple as pulling up a blanket and adjusting a pillow.
