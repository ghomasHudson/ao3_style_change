She was grumpy a few moments ago, and then she was crying and then she goes back to being grumpy again and now when Harry is gone to buy her tampons, she’s horny.
“Who do you think that might charmed the Gryffindors?”, asked Cassie curiously as she looked around the hall, probably trying to find the guilty person.
Dobby’s eyes shed a few tears and he suddenly jumped on him and hugged him, but with his quidditch talent, he caught him just in time before both of them tumbling to the ground.
Before they fell asleep, Harry turned his back and looked at him, Jamie in between them, Harry softly spoke to him, reaching out to Draco’s arm that was hugging Jamie.
Mind full with lust, his aggressively trying to take Harry’s shirt off by lifting the hem but was denied by Harry.
The sound of a cat hissing was near as the sound of a heavy footstep of a man. He knows if he don’t find a way right now, he will a dead meat the next moment he lived.
After almost three hours in the shop, buying everything they needed and everything he finds necessary on his behalf, he have to admit that he has gone overboard with the shopping list. The only thing they need to find right now is Harry’s shaving cream and Draco’s skincare products, hair products and body wash.
Dumbledore clapped his hands and the banner changed into Gryffindor red. Moral of the story is to not celebrate early, now they have to endure the humiliation.
“I want to borrow one of Weasley’s books, I heard he was rather good at some subject.”, said Draco without waiting for Madam Pomfrey to ask him questions.
He quickly get far away from that thing because he knows his curious hand would want to touch the curse object, he even thought that one day, his curiosity might kill him, he chuckled at that thought because it was hilarious.
‘You know what? I’m done for tonight, I have escaped too many deaths today and a three headed dog wouldn’t be the end of me’, as he groped the doorknob, he hoped nobody saw his shivering hands because he tried to act brave.
Something caught his eyes because when his father thrust the book quickly to her, there was another book under it, the cover was black and no one could ever see it if they didn’t pay close attention but he did. He wanted to get closer to her but father called for them as he pulled himself out of Hagrid’s grip, to go back home.
He accepted it and absorbed the photo, a young man and woman with a child, he has some of her facial features but he mostly looked like Sirius Black. His Mom was beautiful, no wonder Sirius fell in love with her.
“Why would you do a servant stuff while your sister could stand over there elegantly waiting for you to be done.”, asked Pansy, confused.
The atmosphere in the room was silence, there is no sound except their quiet breathing until Severus opened his mouth to ask him a question.
“I’m sorry - I’m sorry,” apologised Celestial insincerely while clutching her stomach. Iris found nothing amusing about the whole situation.
James Potter called him for the bill when it was time to pay, he tips him well even though he doesn't need to but he still appreciates it.
They walked out of the common room as quietly as they could on their tippy toes. Walking careful hoping that no students were awake at this god forsaken hour except them.
Fucking Draco will always been a pleasure to him like who wouldn’t fuck a beautiful person. It was a gift from the universe for saving this fucking Wizarding World.
The reason why Dobby has a special place in Draco’s heart is because Dobby is special. He was rarely afraid of father, he broke some of the house rules when Draco invite him on the broom. Draco did try to do it with the other house-elves but they were too afraid to disobey their head master of the house.
“If you tell me Dobby, I would be cautious, I would help you, you know I would.”, said Draco slowly and patiently, he needs to gain Dobby’s trust because he was scared that Draco would tell father on him.
Sorry for the late update.. I really try but anyways I haven't write chapter 6 so you guys better be careful.
The healer uses a cleaning charm to clean the blood up, he loses his consciousness to the darkness five minutes later, when everything is perfect.
When he stepped inside the meeting room, he realized that his shirt was backward and there’s no time to change. He was so embarrassed that he was hoping for the floor to swallow him right there and then.
“That’s the Draco constellation. It was easier to find because they are visible all year along but hard at the same time because the stars are not very bright. Besides, it was one of the best constellations out there,” adding a little bit of cockiness to his voice and chuckling when he found himself ridiculous.
With Severus’s arms still wrapped around him, he finally hugged him back. Severus was trying to hold back the tears as he told him the story about her.
He brings his nipples to their mouths, once they felt something against their small lips, with closed eyes, they quickly latched on it, pulling the heavy milk out of him. Once they started sucking, he let out a relieved sigh.
Draco moaned louder than before when three fingers enter his hole and hits his prostate relentlessly, precum shooting out his length.
It took Draco fifteen minutes when he walked into the living room with a plate filled with food, Harry was already make himself comfortable on the sofa, legs resting on top of the table that was place in the living room.
Bloody hell, I'm thinking right now like should i make Draco acts bad or just acts like a snarky 11 years old SHIT I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD MAKE DRACO A FUCKING BITCH FIRST OR NOT.. thank you for reading though, love you guys and do not expect me to post chapter 3 faster because im still stuck on Draco's attitude and personality so peace out yo
His cum are leaking out of his hole as he pulled out of him, he was panting as he laid his body beside Draco. Draco turned his body to the side and gave him a chaste kiss on his red tinted cheek when he was coming back from their high.
“Mama is here, baby. Mama is here. Don’t cry,” soothing the babies with his words which did not work at all, but their whimpering slowly quieted down.
His husband twists his finger around and vanished the cum on their body, their room smells the aftermath of sex.
Narcissa took a deep breathe and explained his family tree, “We are actually your relative, Cassie is your cousin, your biological mother was Lucius’s younger sister, Amelia Black née Malfoy, she died by the hand of two Death Eaters trying to get the information on the Potters because your father, Sirius Black was their Secret Keeper.”
“Hello, Draco and Jamie,” Draco nodded his head in greeting while Jamie greeted them with excitement because she is his favourite Aunt.
The healer told Harry that Draco should be allowed to leave the hospital the next day when Draco was in his post exhaustion after giving birth.
“I said don’t joke like that, Malfoy. It was not funny on the first try and it was still not funny now!”, screamed Longbottom so he could hear him. Draco laughed out loud that the silent forest echoed.
“Good morning Mrs Malfoy, Mr Mafloy and Miss Malfoy,” he greeted them warmly with a smile on his face. Mother scoffed at him while Draco and Cassie greeted him warmly and respectfully.
‘Break it up, there, gents, break it up-’, Hagrid was wading towards them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr Weasley and father apart. Both of them have a huge bruise on their face. Father was still holding the girl Weasley’s old transfiguration book, he thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.
Dobby told him that he sealed the barrier to Platform 9 ¾ once Harry Potter tried to get through the barrier. Draco thought that he was brilliant and laughed for a long time. He gripped his hand into a fist and told Dobby to fist bump it. Dobby didn’t understand what it meant so Draco had to teach him.
Longbottom was looking around him, waiting for anything to jump on them, it looks like he was ready as his fingers curled tightly around his wand.
“The girl’s dormitory is on the left and down the stairs and boys aren’t allowed in the girls dormitory,” said the fifth-year prefect who was named Gemma Farley.
When the first of April came, he waited patiently at the Great Hall, sitting on the Slytherin table as he filled his plate with light food, he can’t wait to observe his brilliant work he didn’t get the credit for. With his picture moving object ready to record the whole situation, secretly hiding the camera from everyone else’s eyes except his.
‘Sometimes, you can be really reckless, maybe you should have been in Slytherin’, said Blaise while filling up his plate with food. ‘And if Cassie and Pans hear about this, we are going to be a dead meat feed to the giant squid’.
After a few more begging from Draco and a few more teasing from Harry, he finally gave in. Since Harry already prepared him, his hand travelled to his cock, pump a few times into hardness and slides into Draco for the second time today.
When he finally stepped foot inside his dorm, the atmosphere around the room was quiet since most of them had gone to bed. He stripped out of his school robes as he pulled his camera out of his pocket. He realized that his camera was still rolling, he forgot to press the stop button, he must have recorded the whole conversation between the centaur that he didn’t pay attention at.
He was greeted by a sight of Longbottom’s legs stuck together as he walked inside the Great Hall, he recognized the spell as the Leg-Lock Jinx. What a fool, he thought to himself as his legs march over to the Slytherin table.
Admiring his boyfriend’s face as he traced them with his fingers, acknowledging his boyfriend’s beauty.
After felt like an hour, he pulled back his hand that was left hanging and turned his head towards Cassie, “Take your trunk out, let just go find new compartment, we are not welcome here.”
They were sitting in silence waiting for Jamie to utter words, Harry was trying to persuade him by soothing his back up and down. Harry bent down and whispered words of encouragement into his ears.
he smirked knowing the meaning behind those sentences, at the same time he is trying to win a fight against his young son.
Harry bit his lips and pulled it slowly, they both groaned and again, their lips were connected. Harry swiped his bottom lips, silently asking his permission to enter his mouth - to taste Draco on him.
Professor McGonagall pulled the oak door wide open, the Entrance Hall was so big that there were 4 long tables for the students of the houses and 1 long table for the professors.
“What are you going to do about it, Potter?”, asked Draco as he raised the corner of his eyebrow, he might looked like a prat right now but he actually was not, he was finding some sort of entertainment taunting the trio.
As they were having a conversation in the back, his eyes locked into a shelf full of skulls, he turned his head towards where Cassie is and she in fact has her back on him. It was a perfect chance.
Oh, Draco knew and he knows that even Harry knew that it was on purpose but they did nothing because they knew -
“Thanks darling,” and slammed the door on Harry’s face. She got a delightful smile out of it and a grunt from the opposite of the door.
Jamie was surely did not get his behaviour from him since Mother told him that he was such an angel growing up but Harry debunked it because Harry said that his attitude in school did not matched the description that Mother told him.
“But if you guys are not dating, there must be something wrong with the universe and one of you needs to fix it.”
It’s probably why he was not on speaking terms with his Father but Mother told him that he will come around one day, it’s been seven years and he still hasn't come around from the Pureblood’s ideal.
She turned the volume up for, ‘Listen, I would be the first in the frame from the start because it was going to be a boy’s voice that’s going to sing and you jump in when it was the girl’s voice, understand?’
As she walks around the school with the Invisibility cloaks she nipped on the way out, draped around her so tightly, afraid that she would get caught sneaking around in the middle of the night, she thinks back to the time where life was easier but then, her life was never easy.
“Follow me”, said Filch haughtily, ushering them out of the hall as him lightning the lamp. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule, won’t you, eh?”he continued, leering at them.
When some of the Gryffindors walked inside the hall and sits at their respective table, the other houses was confused as to why they were not wearing their red cloak. It seems that no one could cancel the spell so that must mean his charms worked.
Sirius was throwing little Draco up in the air when Remus bared the information about his wife. When Remus spoke about those four words, His mind was blank. There is nothing that could come out of his mouth, for the first time in years, he was speechless.
What does she mean when he’s older? He was older than her anyways from the first impression he got of her, besides she was wearing a plain dress robe with no house colour yet so Draco assumed she must have been the new first year.
“Is it the Ravenclaw guy from yesterday?,” asked Bryan again as he wiggled his eyebrows and smirking his way up to his eyes. His friends are cackling at the assumption.
He went to his desk to read, he saw the newspaper and the photograph, the memories from the day before flooded his mind.
Some of them are wary of him and some of them are scared. The only elf that was not scared of him is Dobby and that’s why they’re close.
Since the sound were enough to wake the whole bloody resident of the castle, Potter decided to yelled for them to run and the seven of them decided to sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Potter was in the lead without any idea where they were or they were going.
He came up to him and gave him a chaste kiss, Harry took his hand in his as he deepened the kiss, his hands then coming down to his husband’s bum and squeezed the soft globe firmly.
She then smiles brightly and gets off of the stool and skips towards him and gives him a hug and walks away to the Slytherin’s table.
With confusion, he followed his father’s order and when he felt the same thing as his dad, he jumped up and down until he unintentionally kicked Harry in his wolf’s face.
Right after Dumbledore announced that Slytherin won, he decided that he had a points to give to his favourite students ; Potter and his friends, and additional of Longbottom, they were awarded fifty points each but Potter was awarded sixty point. For what? Save the bloody school?
The first thing that caught Draco’s eyes is the boy’s eyes, he had the most mesmerizing green eyes he had ever seen, it was emerald, vivid and intense. He could see his green eyes sparkle under the light, like a green gemstones, while the boy was staring at him hesitantly.
They laughed and some of Draco’s tiredness was fading. Draco invites him to sit on the bench beside him and he finally sits down after standing for what seems like a while. Where is his manners his parents taught him since young.
And he decided from there on he liked this weird girl, she spoke whatever came to her mind without filtering her words and he quite liked it.
It had been a week since he kept coming back to the same room looking for the mirror. The second day he went back to the mirror, he brought his own mirror with him because the inscription on the mirror made him curious so he reflections his own mirror to the inscription.
Father didn’t noticed Draco’s changed of mood when he picked him and Cassie up from the King Cross Station since he masked it well but he might think that Mother knows there might be something wrong with him but she didn’t voice it out.
‘I saw them’, He finally looked up, with tears in his eyes as he spoken those three words. He doesn’t have to explain as Severus understood who he was talking about.
“Just give me a moment and I’ll be down, Dobby,” said Draco without looking at Dobby as he was concentrating on his trunk and with that, Dobby apparate back to the dining hall to inform his mother.
Black chatted with him while the rest of the family were giving orders. Not going to lie, Black is actually quite an interesting person, he loves to crack jokes with James Potter while they were talking to him, smiling pleasantly at him.
The loud sound of the music echo through the common room, he saw a lot of people dancing. Draco looked around for Pansy and Blaise, saw that they were with their plus one. Pansy was dancing with Granger while holding a drink in her hand.
‘Here you go baby’, as he handed the drink to him, he laid his back against Harry’s chest, Harry sneaked one arm around his waist. When he turned back to Goldstein, he was already gone.
They were going to have a detention with Hagrid but it must not be that bad, right? Without him voicing his opinion, Filch saw the delight grin from Potter’s face and quickly squashed it away, because he said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy - it’s into the Forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.”
Draco kept on feeding Harry until the plate is empty as Harry kept on roaming both of his hands on Draco’s smooth pale body. He still kept on teasing Draco here and there, especially with his cock, thrusting up till it hits his prostate and then abandoned it, the plate on Draco’s hand almost fall to the ground.
“Ewwww ugleee eww”, pointed Jamie and laughed at the stranger, the stranger’s smile dropped and sneered at his son.
Suddenly, Harry felt a kick where his paw rested on Draco. With wide-eyed, he looked up, surprised and howled for his son to come closer.
‘Not gonna lie, I smell quidditch pitch, treacle tart and butterbe-, holy Merlin’s pants’, his eyes widened with realization, he knew he likes Potter but he didn’t know that he could be in love with him. He was speechless since he just realize the part of him, but with Potter knowing it.
“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,” said father, he hears father took out the roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveled it for Mr Borgin to read. “I have a few -ah -items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call…”
“Well we could surely do that since no one was around but later, okay?”, his hand lifting Draco up so he could sit comfortably on his lap, hands staying there and caressing Draco’s inner thighs.
“Fuck- I want you now. Fuck me right here. Let’s the stars and the constellations be the witness of our love.” He demanded and Draco moved his body to sit on top of Harry,
“It was a disrespect to your own kind and I was fine anyways, just let Potter get on your back because I think his head are still dizzy”, said Draco honestly.
“Well she’s not going to because firstly the idea of you and her hanging out is already wrong in my father’s eyes. Secondly, if I heard you tell her, I will tell him about the ‘secret study’ and let me tell you, my father wouldn’t be pleased.”
Bending his body forward, bringing Draco with him as he put the remote back down on the table, already choosing a movie. He picked Draco’s favourite movie, a romance movie called “Pride and Prejudice”.
“I reminds him of the person who got his sister killed, if Sirius Black did not marry mom then all of this wouldn’t happen. She wouldn’t die, father will still have his sister and most important thing is, I wouldn’t be born.”, he thought to himself again, the more he thought about it, the more it was eating him alive.
When he was satisfied with Draco’s mouth, he kissed him on his neck, suck it aggressively leaving hickies for people to see that Draco belongs to him. Draco moaned harder, calling his name when he sucked on his sensitive spot.
“Not with me,” said father, his long nostrils flaring. Draco was so fucking seething that he walked around the room, looking for any object that could take his mind off father’s stupid statement about him, with his hands clenched into a fist, he looked into the glass eye, concentrating his mind on the fucking stupid useless item.
“Speak clearly, Draco. Malfoy don’t mumble and Malfoy obviously would get everything they want.”, complained father as he drummed his fingers on the counter, which is a weird action he thought.
“So, you want a dark skin man? I would assume that you just want Blaise, right?”, asked Draco again as he lowered his voice so that anyone couldn’t hear their conversation.
Wallowing in self-pity and questioning her existence as a woman. She doesn’t even want a baby anytime soon or ever so why give her a uterus then?
“Yes, I think it's time for you guys to get on the train,” said Mother while petting Draco’s slicked straight hair.
‘You know you are quite a jealous git aren’t you, Potter?’, said Draco smugly as he raised one eyebrow up.
The night was kind of cold with what he was wearing. Maybe it was a bad idea wearing a short skirt at this time of an hour.
“Jamie- Come out. Mama want to see your face”, cooed Draco hoping that Jamie would come out from his hiding spot but he was obviously ignored by his son as he heard the giggly sound continued.
With a heavy heart, his eyelids slowly dropping as he laid his head against the mirror, fingertips touching the false reflection he received from the mirror.
“When you say that sentence, it reminds me of the day of our first detention in the stupid Forbidden Forest,”, said Draco, reminiscing his time at Hogwarts. “If I didn’t know better, Draco - I say you were scared,” mimicking his husband’s concern voice when they were in first year, and laughed uncontrollably when he looked at his Harry’s face expression.
He was scowling as he looked at them but thank goodness he didn’t ask for any explanation on where they were. Their journey back home was silence, nobody dare to speak about the scene father and Mr Weasley cause in the bookstore.
Sirius was grieving because it was his idea to change the Secret Keeper to Peter Pettigrew so he made up his mind to go after him but before that, he had to meet Narcissa at The Malfoy Manor.
“No matter, gradually she will be like her father and brother.”, said Mr Weasley, sneering at the thought that maybe they are a good wizards family as he shakes his head.
“Hello there, you have the same shade of colour hair as mine. Quite captivating actually that I’ve never met someone with hair like us before. You are the first person,” said her in her dreamy and soothing voice. He never heard someone speak like this before, it was like her soul was in another world she created in her head but her body was in reality.
“What does that have to do with Potter not going to Hogwarts? - wait- wait I know, so that he realised that his friends doesn’t write him anything and then he will feel isolated. You want to make he thinks that his friends doesn’t want them to be his friends anymore so then he that makes him don’t want to go to Hogwarts”, said Draco as he carefully wrapped the bandage around the injuries. He looked at Dobby for confirmation as Dobby nodded his head yes.
Draco moaned softly as he answered Harry’s question, “They were quite active today, I can feel their kicking.”, hands coming to hold onto Harry’s left hand while his right hand are doing the work.
, explained Longbottom to the trio. There’s a part of him that was pity at Longbottom for being the target of Slytherins but he can’t do anything about it. It was not his job and anyways, why would he be sorted in Gryffindor if he was not brave.
He stayed sitting on bed for his body to adjust, his leg was hanging but not touching the floor. After a while, he stood up and walked towards the bathroom. Towel drapes from his shoulder.
‘Why can’t they wait until next week, now I’ve lost a bet to Pomona’, as she shakes her head hating that she had lost a bet.
When he finally woke up, he felt uncomfortable because he slept with his school robe on. He looked outside of the window and saw the sky has turned dark. The only sound he could hear is his breathing since everything was quiet. Blaise was probably at Weasley’s room doing Merlins know what. Pansy without a doubt are with Granger right now.
He then turned his head back towards her sister. She was holding her hand tightly and her eyes were closed, the hall was silent.
‘nghhh- Harry please… fuck me… I can’t take it anymore… please Harry’, begged Draco, Harry gave in and lined up his big length to Draco’s hole and pushed in.
With a heavy hand, she twisted the knob slowly and walked inside elegantly, composing her posture on the way, Draco was walking closely behind her, making him almost stepped on her foot into tripping both of them to the ground but luckily no such thing happen.
‘Oh yes yes another Malfoy, but are you truly a Malfoy since your last name was actually Black?’ The hat spoke to him and he was shocked that the hat knows his past.
The hat nodded continuously, Draco couldn't believe that he could scare a centuries old hat, He was impressed with himself. He puts the hat back on his hat and the hat shouts Slytherin doubtlessly.
Right now they are lovers, a forbidden love between a 35 and 16 year old but once Draco is going to step out of his private quarter, they have to act like a normal student and a professor interaction, like how Harry acts towards his other students.
“Where did you go at night? Just answer me because I will not get angry at you, I would never.”, Draco brings his hand to his head, stroking Dobby’s head softly as he saw Dobby’s body are getting tenser as Draco kept asking him question.
His feet touched the ground safely when a loud screech shouting Potter’s name. The students are all turned towards the voice and it was Professor McGonagall. Draco’s heart sank, if people told her that Draco too had been flying without the teacher's observation, he too would be dead like Potter. He wanted to get on her good grace but now he can’t anymore.
Did Harry just say his mother’s homemade food? Mother hardly cooks food for him, it was usually the maid, before he moved out of the mansion into his and Harry’s shared home but when she did cook for him, he was addicted.
Draco was wearing a sleeveless, above the knees white dress, blue butterflies pattern printed around the dress, the dress was a little bit loose so that he could be comfortable, sometimes he missed wearing his tight dresses.
He don’t have to look at the item twice to know that it was not a fine taste, the hand looks old but the description and what the object can do is magnificent. He wanted it but he knows father wouldn’t let him.
But what is the point, the old man is dead regardless of anything, she’s not a Necromancer to bring the dead back to life just to take out her anger on him. Each thought overlapped with a new one, creating a nonexistent problem to disturb her brain.
Talking about Harry, he was looking at him intensely and impatient shown on his face, clearly wanted to have Draco all to himself while he was wearing the mini skirt.
Jamie wrapped his little hand around Draco’s neck and smacked his tiny mouth to his pale cheeks as he gave him a big kiss on his left cheek.
Not long after that, three months later, the Potters were killed by You-Know-Who, they have been betrayed by their close friend, little Harry was still alive and You-Know-Who has disappeared and a year and three months old Harry was sent to her mother’s sister.
He replied suspiciously at first because why all of a sudden would she send a message to him and how did he find his private account. He stalked her 200k followers account first before he accepted the follow request and followed her account back when he was satisfied with his stalking.
How much points would it cause to get caught roaming the castle after curfew? Twenty points? It can’t be twenty points, it must cost more than twenty.
“Draco, although I know you for only two years, but in the span of two years - you change my lives, you make me feel I’m normal and see me as Harry and not the son of the famous football player, James Potter but as Harry Potter. I knew our love was real when I realised that whenever I had a bad day, you would stop whatever you are doing and comfort me. No one has ever done that to me before. I know I was oblivious to not noticing you earlier when we were in secondary school but for you still harbour the feeling for me until now makes me realise that you will never stop loving me.”
‘Potter! Are you out of your mind? I know you are the Chosen One but this is McGonagall!’ said Draco as he was pulling Harry to walk faster with their interlaced hand.
When Harry realised what he meant, his legs ran quick and chased after him, although he was holding the basket, he still could run faster and outrun Draco.
When they finally stepped into the dining room, Draco has already laid the plate on the table before Harry arrives home. He cooked Jamie’s favourite food, spaghetti carbonara because he thought that he was being a good kid today but he had been fooled by his two year-old kid, pretending that he was being a good boy but in the end, his mischief had shown.
With the plate on his hand, Draco scooped the food with the spoon and bring it to Harry’s mouth, he open his mouth willingly and Draco shoved the food in as Harry’s hand went to his boobs.
Even his voice sounds rich but friendly. His eyelashes flutter as he speaks. Aristocratic features and his sinful slimmed body. He chanted in his mind for Draco to turn around so he could peek at his arse and when he finally saw it, he wished he could bury inside those perfect bum forever.
‘I’m not going to tell anyone Mr Malfoy, now come quick’, she said. Draco looked at Potter and saw the trouble on his face had faded, he patted his shoulder invisibly in his mind.
“Draco, I don’t have problems with animals, should I remind you that your father has allergies towards fur.”
Before they get to shout up, Theo raises his hand. ‘Why can’t we use our left hand? How about someone who is left-handed?’ he questioned Madam Hooch. Madam Hooch was looking at him rather annoyed at being interrupted when she gave an answer.
The hand on his thigh stopped moving but still rest there. He can’t believe that Potter was such a jealous type.
Once she heard the word ‘chocolate’ it’s like the pain was gone for a minute, she giddily skipping to the bed and waiting to be treated like a queen. As she gets closer to bed, Harry takes her hand and dutifully pushes her back resting it against the headboard.
“This is why one of my middle names is Sirius right? Because I’m actually his son, Sirius Black isn’t it?” said Draco as he was hoping that everything that came out of his mouth was a false accusation.
They walked further and further away from the school and out in the school grounds, the old man keeps on blabbering his mouth, he can’t take it anymore, the Gryffindors kept quiet but not him .. oh no .. he was not going to let this old man open his nasty mouth anymore.
Harry came up behind him and hugged him tightly, “It was the shittiest day of fucking life, everything went wrong and it was like the universe was trying to punish me or something”, growled Harry.
Draco turned his head to Granger, ‘Let me just tell you something Granger. It doesn’t matter if you got friends or not. If you do then that’s great and if you don’t maybe it’s for the better’. Cassie tried to interject but he held his hand up at her.
“Don’t worry about that pretty head of yours, really, I do want to. Let’s go,” he took his hand and dragged him inside of the condominium, through the sliding door and into the lobby.
‘So how do we do this?’, asked Potter as he set down the ingredients on the table. Draco moved closer to Potter because it was easier to instruct Potter.
Jamie looked at his father for support and saw him nodding his head for him to start, a confirmation that he could do it.
“You really don’t have to,” Draco speaks admiringly, surprised enough he could hide it. His heart does a leap, he feels warm in his chest knowing there’s someone like Harry who is protective over someone like him.
When both the Gryffindor and the Slytherin are in the lead- tied, Dumbledore had the audacity to award Longbottom ten points for standing up for himself. Arsehole - he stands up for himself everyday but did he get awarded? The answer is no.
He was faking his action by moving the cushion of the sofa around, faking looking under the table and when he was finally near the suspicious spot, he reached out his hand, feeling the thick material of the stupid invisibility cloak. He grasped the cloak and pulled it off of his son.
He then took the nipple that he was licking into his mouth, sucking onto it. Draco was a hot mess beneath him, the only thing he could his roamed his hand on Harry’s back and rubbed their cock together.
Besides, he doesn't think that Father actually knows about the existence of the room, or maybe he did know but he just doesn’t have the time of his rich life to care for lowly creatures.
He recognised the attacker as his husband, the prankster. He barked at him once Harry helped him sit down, his paw took a swing at Harry’s face, Regulus too, annoyed with his dad’s action, jumped at him and tackled him to the ground.
“Okay Harry”, said Draco breathlessly. One clothes turned into two and now he was bare naked from the top of his head and down to his toe.
It could be simple if he just clicks the follow button waiting for the request to follow him but he doesn’t want to be seen as a creep. What was he thinking, he already is a creeper by stalking his account fixedly.
When they knocked and opened the door on the last compartment hoping that this last compartment wasn't full of people, his hope came true cause there were only two people in the compartment.
Potter was talking to the centaur as Draco was trying grasped his mind on what just happened. Potter’s hand suddenly pulled him out of his thought as he watched the centaur lowered himself.
confessed Harry as he rested his head on top of Draco’s, savouring the calm environment around his family.
“Do you have anywhere else to go?”, asked mother with her hand blocking the sunlight from blinding her eyes.
Suddenly, he felt a strong arm on his waist pulling him, pulling him closer to Potter. Draco looked at him but Potter was looking at Goldstein with a hint of possessiveness in his eyes. The arm on his waist squeezed him tighter the longer Goldstein looked at him.
He wanted to mess with Longbottom more, it brings joy into his soul, so he decided to point his fingers somewhere in the dark and order Longbottom to look at it, Longbottom was looking at the dark empty space studiously, wand at the ready.
“Your son doesn’t want to wear the shirt I picked for him,” answered Draco as he put the clothes that Jamie picked through Jamie’s head, he sighed in defeat, his adorable son had won. When he was done dressing Jamie up, he ran to the mirror length floor in the room and spun his body around, giggling at himself, satisfied with his looks as he looked at his reflection.
“Draco! The twins just woke up and wanted to be fed,” Molly shouted at the door while holding Adrian, trying to lull him to stop but failed miserably.
They walked out of the shop and their mother addressed them to go to the Madam Malkin's robe shop to be fitted for their school robes while their mother goes to buy their books so they can save some time.
Draco moaned into the kiss and called out Harry’s name. Harry dragged his unoccupied hand inside the sweater, feeling Draco’s smooth skin.
Draco runs at an average speed, protecting the child in him so nothing happens to her. That’s why Regulus can outrun him in just a second.
“I’m going to tell your sister about it”, said the muggleborn. Did this bitch just blackmailed him using his sister?
Draco gave him a soft hum as an answer but his eyes were still closed. Bringing his arms and wound it around Harry’s neck, showering kissing on his brawny chest. Without waiting for another response, Harry flipped both of them over, him on top of Draco instead.
Here he is, in front of the door of his house, his hand scrambled to unlock the door. He stepped inside and quickly shut the door behind him as he called loud to his husband.
Holy fuck. Draco knows that doggy-style is one of his favourite sex position. Harry gives a slap on the smooth of his arse, his huge palm imprinted on Draco’s arse cheeks, thanking him.
Harry hang his auror robe at the coat rack and then take Draco’s hand to help him to stand and took Jamie back in his arms.
He stood half-naked in front of his husband. Harry was looking at him like a predator waiting for his dinner, eyes are lustful, his pupil grow darker the longer he was looking at him.
‘Draco Lucius Malfoy! You better get back down here right now or you better be careful when your feet touches the ground later,, I swear to Merlin’s beard Draco, I’m not playing’, shouted Pansy harshly but he ignored her warning, such a party-pooper, he thought.
A hand grabbed his, intertwined their fingers together and hot breath whispered into his ears, “What are you thinking about?”, asked Harry curiously.
But he knows that they will follow him and Cassie because their father probably told them to follow the Malfoy's around like a bodyguard.
Draco slung his bag on his shoulder and rushed out of the room without cleaning his workplace. He heard a shout from Potter telling him he was done with him yet and from Pansy demanding him make the stupid Tik Tok.
“Sorry? You just- I don’t mean to- Wait, I don’t mean to judge you. I’m so sorry if I’m making you uncomfortable, wasn’t my intention,” he apologised before they got on the wrong foot.
They haven’t even have sex for a whole two weeks, not even a quick wank with his Draco’s hand on his cock helping him to jerk off. They’ve never been without sex for at least three days since they got together - not even after the birth of Jamie.
When she is finally done taking care of herself, while clutching her stomach she walks out of the bathroom. Trying to be as dramatic as she can so Harry could be her slave for the whole week.
How can he missed someone he’ve never met? He always asked himself that, he should be grateful that the Malfoys took him under their wings but he felt an uneasy feelings in him, it’s like he was being unappreciative but he was grateful ; he was.
He tilted his head once he was inside the bathtub, closing his eyes. Not even ten minutes by himself, Harry walks into the bathroom, he hears the material of the clothes being ripped off from his body. Few moments later, he was joined in by his husband climbing into the tub.
Harry was looking at them with amused so he decided to kiss his cute boyfriend on the mouth, Draco took it without protest and sighs into the kiss.
“Jamie, can you please fetch mama’s wand on the table,” said Draco as he pointed his finger at his wand, Jamie ignored him because he was too focus with playing his toys so maybe he didn’t hear him so he repeated himself again, shouted as he felt another jab of pain.
“When he grows up, he will learn about his real family, please don’t try to hide it from him when he started to ask about it, I know he's a smart one, he will try to put the missing pieces together but for now, let him have a life where he has mother and a father who is not in Azkaban and for now, his last name will be Malfoy and not Black. When he starts his Hogwarts, he will be known as Draco Malfoy''. He reached into his pocket, he looked at it for the last time and handed her the moving photograph of his family.
His curiosity took over and he stepped closer to the object, the closer he went, the clearer he could see that the object was a mirror, a huge magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
They walled up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. The big giant then raised his big hand and knocked on the castle door.
When he think the troll was unconscious, he slumped against the lavatory wall. He was breathing hard from his nose and mouth, chest rising up and down.
‘Mr Malfoy, follow me too!’, she said sternly, Draco obeyed because he knows not to mess around with her. Bloody hell, he hopes that he’s not in trouble but by the look of Professor McGonagall, he knows that he did.
He don’t know why he still got scared although he knows Jamie are going to be there, he gave a little gasped. Draco gave his son a stern look but he was still unfazed by it, instead he ordered him to pick him up.
They talked again when he and Cassie boarded the train to Hogwarts, crossing his arms as he sat himself down beside Blaise, not meeting their eyes. He heard the murmure of their friends calling him dramatic.
“Yes and you do know that this is Mother’s restaurant, right?” eyes locked with Black, wishing that they could just order up already. Thanks to the background music, it helps him soothe his nerves.
They break off from each other’s mouth although it was hard, look into each other's eyes and smile embarrassingly. Iris hugged her girlfriend around the waist as she lit the cigarette, drew in a huge chunk and passed the cigarette to her like the first time but this time, they only shared one cigarette.
Harry was circling his fingers around Draco’s tight ring hole, eyes lust looking at him as he picked his head up and kiss him full on the lips, biting his lips.
‘Which student would most likely you want to be your boyfriend?’, asked Harry with his eyebrow knitted and face showed of curiosity and something he couldn’t comprehend. ‘Do we really have question my taste in guys right now, Potter?’
Weird, he thought to himself because why wasn’t he with the rest of the teachers in the dungeon? Draco pulled the thought out of his head as he watched them careful, he came to a smell that was so foul that he nearly barf, Pansy was already holding her stomach as another hand close around her nose and mouth and leaned her body towards Blaise. They turned their head towards the smell.
The big oaf was striding towards them from the darkness, a sloppy dog at his heels. His hand was clutching a large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulders.
Draco quickly sit up properly with his back straight, “Sorry, father.”, apologised Draco without giving an explanation on why he accidentally fell asleep. He don’t want to anger his father even more that already is.
Weasley hung his head low from embarrassment as Potter steered him to their table with Granger beside him. He knows Weasley would beat the shite out of him if they weren’t surrounded with lots of students and professors.
He don’t know how long he kept on talking until he felt a tap on his shoulders, it took everything in him to look up, his face was drain with tears, he hates feeling like this. She’s been gone for eleven years, Draco should have moved on from his life but he can’t.
Harry pulled out his phone from his pocket, handed out his phone to him, “Give me your number so we can set a date,” said Harry somehow giddily.
“What do you want to buy first?”, asked Harry as he pushed the trolley forward, soft background music was playing at every corner of the shop. “Fruits and vegetables aisle first since it was the first on the list,” said Draco as he looking down at his shopping list in his hand.
Where would the mirror be? Did he went into a different room than before? Is this not the same room? Why was he acting like the world was going to end? Is the mirror bringing him into insanity?
He walked towards the door, with one final glance at the house, he closed the door behind him and went after Pettigrew.
He stopped when he arrived in front of their tables, it was a big family dinner because they had to connect two long tables together. Harry was sitting beside his sister on his left side while his brothers on his right.
Harry took a fancy to him right away once he laid his eyes on Draco and after he was accepted into the pack, Harry started courting him traditionally.
Laying awake on his bed, Draco was tempted to not go to their midnight duel since he knew they would be in detention if they got caught. He knew if Potter and Weasley waited for him long enough until they realized he won’t show up, they would get caught by someone but the desire to prove them wrong is stronger. He casts ‘Tempus’ and it shows a quarter to midnight.
Mother already handed the money to Cassie before they went away to somewhere, they only have to go pay for the books but it seems that author of the fucking books in his fucking hand are having a fucking book signing in the middle of the fucking hot August weather.
Without a second thought, he embraced his son tightly, wishing he could take away his suffering. “What’s wrong, Jamie?” he asked worriedly, wiping away the tears streaming out of his eyes.
‘But then I also saw the pride in you, the cunningness, the ambition, let me have a moment to think because you are quite a difficult case’, the bloody hat said.
‘ I don’t care but  what I do care is who in the bloody hell opens their blabbering mouth?’ I swear if I ever found the person, I’ll cast a tongue-tying curse on them’, said Draco while leaning against the stone cold wall, following Potter’s action. Granger was looking guilty.
When his legs brought him in front of the door, he walked in without knocking because why would he, he was paying someone a visit.
Harry charmed his cock slicked with lube, tugging his cock with his hand as their body moved down so Draco’s back could laid on the bed, he don’t really have to tug his cock to make it hard since looking at Draco the moment he step inside the house already making his cock stood up.
A week later, an owl he didn't recognised dropped a parcel on his food, he cursed the owl profoundly. The parcel contained a muggle camera that could record a moving motion, longer than a moving photograph.
Without waiting, he stood up and walked over to him, lifted him up into his arms and brought him over to where Draco was. Draco too stood up and tilted his head to the door, wanting to discuss alone without the other family members interference.
Since the starts of Eighth Year, Muggle Studies have been a mandatory subject for the students that comes back from the war. The Muggle Studies Professor thought that it would be a great idea for students to own their own phone so each one of the Eight Year own one.
Harry trailed kisses down his neck as one finger turned into two, working inside of Draco. Sucking on his neck hard, leaving hickey.
“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that. No Malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter. Bad blood, that’s what it is.”
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Mr Borgin”, said father. Coldly and Mr Borgin said quickly, “No offence, sir, no offence meant-”
He was going be in trouble, how can’t he didn’t hear Peeves floating near him, Peeves would always make a sound.
Draco rolled his eyes as he looked towards them as Jamie demanded to be pick up into his father’s strong muscular arms.
‘He knows!’ , screamed Draco at the phone and end the call, threw the phone on the bed and decided that he need to sit.  He sat down at the edge of the bed and hunched over and rubbed his face with both hand.
“Up Mama Up!”, screamed Jamie cheerfully as he lifts his chubby little arms up, Draco looked at his son with adoration as he bend his pregnant body down and carefully lifts Jamie into his arms.
Draco left whatever he was doing and turned his body around, facing Harry, “What can I do to make your day better?”, asked Draco as he rests his head on his husband’s broad and strong chest.
“I love you, you know. Although I’m 35 years old and you are 16 which is a huge age gap, I do love you. I don’t say it under the influence of lust, I say it because I do.” Confessed Harry honestly to Draco. He doesn’t want Draco to doubt his love for him.
“Don’t be dramatic”, whispered Draco in her ears. Cassie gave her a nasty look, suddenly she pulled her hand back. “How about I turn the knob and you walk in?”, said Cassie intelligently as she cocked her head to the side and looked at him straight in the eye.
“Here, girl- take your book- it’s the best your father can give you-” and looked at Mr Weasley again, “Do not ever mention my deceased sister to my face”, voice with a hint of venom.
Draco felt his husband huge cock stretched him open, it was incredible as always. Draco stroked Harry’s hair lovely, feeling Harry’s arm wrapped around his lithe waist.
That’s when Draco realized, Dobby was afraid. He did something wrong and he was afraid of the consequence, so that’s why he punished himself before father did so father wouldn’t notice.
Their territory became bigger than before when he killed Tom Riddle, some of Riddle’s loyal and trusted followers ran astray, most of them died protecting their old leader.
Cassie did twisted his ear when she heard he got a detention for sneaking out, luring McGonagall to Potter but sadly failed so he was in detention because he was out of curfew.
“You mean first official kiss? Because I got a lot of kisses since I was a toddler but I can’t remember,” smirked Blaise. Draco had to roll his eyes at his friend’s cocky behaviour.
A beautiful woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders came forward and held her hand to hold the newborn baby. She too was pregnant with a baby boy who will due next month. Sirius hands him to her and Draco little fingers wrapped around her middle length red hair.
He thought that he was going to receive a confession letter like Potter did but thank Merlin it was only the flowers. He asked Flitwick about the sender but Flitwick said that it was anonymous for him. He laid the flowers on his work table, not caring at all about it.
He was checking the time and it had only been ten minutes passed when he felt a tap on his shoulder, his body freezing. He slowly looked behind his back and was met with brilliant green eyes.
“Just accept the defeat and stalk him using Lyra’s account, big brother,” Dahlia sighs annoyingly at him, grabbing Lyra’s phone without her permission, she gives an aggressive ‘hey’ disagreement as she watches her phone fly into his hand.
Hagrid gave a little chuckle and protest at the idea of writing lines. The big oaf then gave them a precaution on what do the when they are in the forest. They must find a unicorn because they were badly injured that their silver blood spilled out of them.
“The Potters made a reservation at nine forty-five at night today and my intuition said that they are going to bring my wrench of a disgraceful cousin and his family,” a disgruntled Mother talking to him about her estranged cousin. She told him that she always have a problem with her cousin and not because he was gay (because Draco has come out to Mother and told her he’s gay years ago) or else she has some explanation to do.
What curious is, Draco was also linked to the Malfoys. Maybe even the House of Black decided that the Malfoy’s are better parents than him.
‘ Troll are twit anyways and the dungeons are big. The troll would probably wondering away from the Slytherin common room since it was hidden.’, said Draco as Dumbledore’s wand bring silence to the students.
“Keep pushing Mr Potter, I can see one of the baby’s head,” he follows the healer words and kept on pushing, he was tired, his brain can’t make up any word anymore because as he pushed, he can feel his opening growing bigger and bigger so the baby could come out, suddenly he heard a wailed.
Ducking under Peeves they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor, where they slammed into a door- and it was locked but that’s okay because he learn a spell to unlock the door but Granger beat him to it, as she spoke the incantation, ‘Alohomora!’, he glared daggers at her.
When he walked inside, both his mother and Cassie greeted him but he didn’t have time for it and shoveled the newspaper and the photograph to his mothers arm and waited for an answer.
She didn't know when but she didn’t care. All she knows is that she had fallen, completely and hopelessly in love with her, and the worst part is that she's a straight woman and there is nothing she can do with it but wait until these feelings disappear.
finding his son in a weak moment and instantly pin him to the ground. He nipped at his son’s neck, demanding for him to admit his defeat.
When she finally decided to step away, Draco was still standing at the end of the bed, curiously looking around the room waiting for Weasley to acknowledge him.
“It’s not like once you bought me the broomstick, I would magically be on the team.”, mumbled Draco under his breath. Actually, that was a good idea, if he did terribly for the try-out, Flint wouldn’t even give him a second thought for joining the team.
They had the audacity to look at his husband for too long, they knows he was a married man with a son and twins on the way, their faces has been printed on the cover of Daily Prophet since they said their vows to each other on their wedding day, stupid bint.
Harry’s finger makes him turn his head back to Harry, suddenly his lips are attacked by Harry’s. His lips consumed his soul and at every moment he didn't care if the weather was cold or not. He wants Harry’s cock in him before he gets mad from the temptation but he got cut off again by Harry.
and sorry for making Ron kinda of an asshole a little bit but I promise his attitude is canon but from Draco's point of view
Now Draco feels like he wants to chuck this old piece of cloth far far away, he felt irritated now with the hat just the way he felt with Weasley. When he looked around again, even the professors watched him with interest.
‘When I heard that students have to come back to continue their Eighth Year, I said to myself that I will do anything in my power to be your friend and going more from there, to make you mine’, with his strong arm around his waist, Potter lead both of them towards his bed as his mouth continue trailing kisses down on his neck.
The man without a doubt shook gratefully and after a few seconds passed, he let go of the Healer’s hand turned to his companions and smiled gleefully, “Wanna meet the new member of the Marauders Junior?” said the man as he was walking towards the room.
Draco can’t take it anymore with Potter teasing him, he begged him to fuck him already. Potter too decided he was done with the teasing, he release Draco’s dick. He took back the abandoned lube and poured some more in his hand to prepare Draco.
Finally, after a bloody long minute maybe fifteen minutes now, he doesn't bloody know anymore, the hat said to him, ‘I know where to put you now.’
“Hey, this sappy git got himself a beautiful husband and he’s going to have two more children on the way.”, Harry bite back as they walked them to the dinning room, with one hand wrapped possessively around Draco’s waist, rubbing his round pregnant stomach while his other arm hold Jamie protectively.
He scoffed at Potter’s great talent at Quidditch, ‘You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!’, and without a warning, Weasley heavy body jumped on him, making them stumbling to the ground.
After he had given Harry his address, he then carefully lifted one foot up and climbed on it. Believe it or not, he has never been on a motorbike because Father has never been a big fan of one. He would look down on someone who owns one, and he doesn’t know why.
He scrambled out of the room once the door was open followed by them and rushed to the dungeon with Blaise and Cassie trailing behind him.
“I think we are done. Let’s go, star. Let’s go somewhere to eat and rest your mind for a while. I have just the place,” yanking books one by one and tugging it under his buffy arm, his arm muscles flex with the amount of books he’s holding.
“Shut up, Draco. This is adult business, go to your sister,” ordered father as he breathe out a relieved sighs, finally he could go to his sister. The grip on his shoulder loosen and he walked out of the situation, away from them because Mr Weasley and father could never see eye to eye.
They were having quiet dinner with conversation flowing between Harry and Draco going on with Jamie blabbering with his mouth full. As Draco was feeding Jamie and himself, Harry’s hand laid on top of his on the table and pulled his hand to his mouth but then Jamie had to ruin the moment by grabbing the spaghetti forcefully and throw it aggressively at Harry. Draco didn’t have time to stop him before Harry’s whole face was a mess.
They bid goodbye and Harry took his phone back, “Bye Mom, remember -I’m bringing Draco next week for family dinner,” said him as he reminded his Mom about going to his parents home. He pressed the end button to end the call and shoved his phone back inside his pocket.
He felt that Harry placed his hand on top of his, slowly and tenderly intertwining his hand with Draco’s and drawing his hand back after a few minutes.
Right now, Ronald was teasing Harry that they got three children before they got to the age of thirty years old and told Harry that he was the one who was helping him to court Draco and that he should be grateful to have a best friend like him, Harry retorted on his behalf by saying that while it only took him like nine months to confess to Draco, it took him seven years to have the balls to kiss Hermione.
“Jamie, look what mama found- dragon fruit. Do you want it?” asked Draco, Jamie’s eyes light up when he laid his eyes on his favourite and bounced excitedly in his seat, “Dagon fod - dagod fud,” said Jamie repeatedly.
Harry decided to intervene, “And I love you and your mama and the babies and me, since no one wants to love me,” he grinned cheekily.
He was surprised, his heart made a weird movement when he saw Harry. He still remembered the eyes of his emerald green, that’s what attracted Draco to him. Draco always thought Harry got the rare genetic trait since Draco knew no one who inherited black hair and green eyes.
She taught him how to record and how to take photos. The camera has a lot of button. At first it was hard to remember which button to press for recording and which button for taking photos but after a while, he brilliantly knows how to function it well.
‘Professor Quirrell, didn’t you just fainted just now? From a healing book that I read, fainting episode that is not serious should only last a few seconds but it will make the person feel unwell and recovery may take several minutes but when I looked at you, you are quite well that you are trying to help to tackle the troll’.
‘No, I don’t like it. Again.’, as she put her phone against the window glass. Draco decides to roll his eyes instead of saying no because he is a pussy. Pansy was scarier that her Aunt Bella when she was mad or when things don’t go her way.
‘Oh hello, sister’, he said when he saw the owner of the hand’s face. He gave her a cheeky grin because he had already been caught by her. He looked around the room and found two unwanted Gryffindors in the room and turned his head towards Potter, ‘This is not in our agreement,’ he sneered as he crossed his arms.
In the photograph, Amelia was holding a nine months old crying Draco, his face was stained with tears, his cheeks was puffy and red, Sirius was trying to cheer him but failed miserably. Amelia tugged Sirius' hair and finally the baby was laughing at his father’s pain.
Lucius was sitting there, looking smug that his wife won’t approve of their relationship anytime soon but those expressions soon fell.
“Oh nothing, just memorizing our eighth year at Hogwarts. I always wondered why you out of the blue-”, before Draco could finish his sentence, Harry cut him.
Here he was, in detention with Potter, Granger and surprisingly Longbottom. He heard that they got caught by Filch but he don’t about Longbottom though.
When it was time to board the train, he hugged his Mother again tightly and nodded his head to his Father, and walked off to board the train, Cassie followed behind.
Harry decided that he wanted to play with his hole more so he kissed around the hole, jabbing his hole with his tongue on the way.
“I’m going to the bathroom for a bit,” informed Harry to him once they arrived at the health and beauty aisle. Draco nodded his head as his eyes scanned through the shelves, he pushed the trolley further into the aisle.
He turned his head to look at Dobby. He was still sleeping while clutching his injured hand, Draco felt bad for him, he wished he could free all of the house-elves because no one deserve to be a slave.
Dobby, as usually leave him alone to have some family time with his mom. They talked- he talked but he hopes his mother was listening to him somewhere.
His arms tightly wrapped around Harry’s built body, head buried into his bulky chest, murmuring his gratefulness repeatedly.
The best part of the day is when his mighty hand hit Weasley’s jaws and got a bruised out of it but the worst part is when he got a black eye and it was really hurt and hard to see.
He was about to open his mouth to continue the conversation when suddenly, his phone ringing, he quickly picked up the call and brought it to his left ear.
Draco would rode with Dobby whenever he was done with his punishment from Father, he would let Dobby sat at the front so he can maneuvered the broom from behind easily, Dobby loves it until one day they stopped because they were caught by Father, both of them got their punishment harshly and Dobby never asked for broom ride since then.
It was not his fault their family is not close, he never even talked to them before. He has no whatsoever bad blood his parents have with them, he was mutual. He was an only gay child whose trying to go through university phase without stressing out, which he failed easily and miserably.
She turned to the rest of the class. ‘None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say “Quidditch”. Come on, dear’.
Harry was kissing Draco’s sweating face while he was pulling out. He then laid beside Draco and scoop him closer to him and hugged him from behind, hand stroke Draco’s belly as his other hand wandlessly spelled them cleaned.
Thursday came, at three that afternoon, Draco, Cassie and the other first-year Slytherins hurried down the front steps into the grounds for their first flying lesson. The sky was clear, breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down towards a smooth lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the Forbidden Forest and had a clear view of the Quidditch pitch.
Harry finally had enough when Draco flanked his arms away from Harry, arms crossing around his chest, a definition of a child once they stepped out of the library. Harry pushed Draco against the wall harmlessly, trapping him, his green eyes blazing into Draco’s.
“Are you that dumb or what? I have the shop owl to deliver to the manor since you are too weak to carry it.” replied Cassie as they were walking to the door, he obviously ignored the insults instead he looked over at Potter, he was standing closely beside the door. It’s that time of the day to disrupt the happiness on Potter’s face.
‘Yes! Yes! Harry! Yourss -nghh only yours’, screamed Draco as he agreed with Potter. ‘You belong to me Draco, not Goldstein or anyone else. Mine!’ he growled as the sound of their heavy breathing and the sound of skin slapping against skin echo through the room.
“Bye Longbottom and watch out for the werewolves, remember … they would want a piece of your fresh and juicy meat”, laughed Draco as he stroll away from the group.
“You know Longbottom, I heard there’s a missing spider in the train, it might be on this one though so be very cautious all the time,” teased Draco and walked back out. He heard a shriek as he closed the compartment door and cast a sticking spell so the door would be open when it arrived at Hogwarts.
Opening his eyes when his son gave him a happy ‘yip’, a green sign meaning he managed to change. He trudged away from their woodhouse followed by Regulus closely behind.
Cassie slides open the compartment door and they greet the people inside. Cassie sits in between Crabbe and Goyle, she greets them unenthusiastically but she doesn’t show it.
“How do you feel, Draco?” Asked Harry when he heard no sound of his voice except for his breathing heavily, slipping his cock out of Draco.
“Mr Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,’ said Mr Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted- and young Master and young Mistress Malfoy, too- charmed.”
“Mother- How - did you know?” asked Draco as he stuttered with his words as he was taking a very deep breath. “Harry sends a Patronus for me to take care of Jamie while you both are going to the hospital.
“Come in”, instructs a gruff confident voice from inside of the room, they could barely hear the low voice but with enough practice, they could hear it from miles away.
Harry stopped tickling him when the door to his level opened, he stepped out with Harry pressing his finger hard on the closing button.
‘They’re in here somewhere,’ he heard him mutter, probably to his cat, what a nutter. ‘Probably hiding.’
“Harry - am i a good boy?” asked Draco as he took a long breath, Harry’s huge cock was inside him, inside of this beautiful angel’s body, implying himself on his cock.
Being at the Astronomy Tower brings her back to the first time they were here, months ago. The only thing that changes is Celestial’s hair colour, she dyed it to violet and everytime Iris looks at her, her breath stops, her internal organs are screaming at her to just kiss the girl already.
As they walked farther away from the castle, Draco could see the light resource from the big giant’s hut. Then he heard a shout coming near by the forest.
Draco was going to Apparate with Mother while Cassie was going with Father, Father and Cassie had already Apparate to King Cross.
“Nothing, love,” said Harry cheekily and the same time, his son was hiding his laugh by clamping his small hand on his mouth. He shakes his head at their behaviour and went back looking for the freshest bananas.
“Yes and I picked you up to our room.”, answered Harry, Draco looked around his surrounding and he was indeed in their room, he didn’t even realized that Harry already moved him.
“Mr Peterson, refrain from gossiping in my class and Mr Malfoy, please meet me after the class ends.” ordered Harry as he gritted his teeth, looking at them with scold shown on his face, trying not to show his jealousy to his students. What would they say if they knew he was jealous over some 16 years old Ravenclaw who didn’t even have their cock far up Draco’s arse at all, after all it was his cock.
Did she accidentally fall asleep while sitting on the toilet? Yes, she did and was she proud of it? No she’s not.
“What happened,” asked Blaise when he walked towards Draco and when he saw what happened, he fell down, held his belly and laughed.
Draco came first before Harry, both of their stomachs covered in his cum, Harry followed a few seconds later, coming inside Draco.
The teachers gave him a look of realization because the word that was spilling out of his mouth was a fact. Severus was looking at with something he couldn’t comprehend. The students in the room was all looking at him including Potter and Weasley. Their reaction was different from others. They looked at him as if they have solve a little bit of ongoing mystery.
Potter fell to his knees, he for sure are going to die, it’s either stay with Potter or leave Potter be and run for his life, but he couldn’t do that to him, it was unfair.
“Thank you for falling in love with me,” as she looked into her green eyes. They were watching the stars just now but right now, they settled to just staring into each other. Without them knowing, the stars were looking too. Happy with the process of their love stories, watching them since the day of their first year of Hogwarts until now.
The Slytherin table was abrupted with cheers and shouts louder than others first year Slytherin maybe because Cassie is a Malfoy.
Once Draco is out of school, he’s going to claim his price, price possession he intends to never be apart.
“Do you think this is funny? We see if it’s funny if I kick your balls and blood is coming out of it instead. We'll see who’s the one laughing in the end.”
“I want you to rest and let me tend your hands and legs better, change the old bandage with a new one because it will get infected if you don’t change it. As for the father part, if he asked where were you, just say that I was punishing because I was bored”, said Draco to Dobby, giving a few idea for the later excuses.
“No- nope. Absolutely not. I don’t even have a boyfriend,” he quickly denied the accusation but then he was weirded out, “Wait, how would you know I would most likely to have a boyfriend than a girlfriend?” He asked sceptically.
So, this mystery in Hogwarts had something to do with Quirrell? But how does Severus came in in the situation?
But his hope was crushed when he found out that his account is private. His back rested against the chair as he tilted his head upward, defeated. There’s nothing he can do when Draco’s Instagram account is private.
“Mother, I love Iris so much. She makes me want to be a better person and if you don’t want to accept our relationship, I won’t back away. I’m coming here to inform you instead of you finding this out from the newspaper.”
‘Be careful Potter, your prejudice towards Slytherin are showing. We don’t want our Golden Boy to be the next dark wizard’, added Draco.
When everything was packed, Harry crouched down and told him to ride on his back, he absolutely liked the idea and quickly jumped on his boyfriend’s back. One hand holding his boyfriend’s skirt down so the wind wouldn’t blow it up, securing his hold by holding onto Draco’s thighs that was wrapped around his waist while Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck.
He really hopes the hat doesn’t put him in Ravenclaw because he doesn’t want to get a Howler on the first day of school from father.
He tried to refrain himself but when a 15 years old Draco tried to seduce him, he knew he can’t deny his desire any longer. Draco succeed in seducing him and they had sex in an empty classroom, took Draco’s virginity right there and then. He was not pleased when he knew that Draco's first kiss was not him but no matter.
Harry was looking up from the menu when he heard the most angelic voice asking them if they were ready to take orders when he saw the most beautiful person he had ever laid his eyes on.
‘So, tell me Potter. What position do you play? Wait- Wait let me guess’, he said when he was closed to him. He brought his hand to his chin and rubbed it. After a few seconds, he turned his eyes to Potter and said, ‘Seeker? Of course it’s Seeker because I know you are the type that wants the attention,  people called it the Attention Seeker’, he smirked. ‘Well you know what? It was fun playing with you, better thank me for it you know but oh well, see you next time, attention seeker’, he then turned his head towards Weasley who face was furious, Draco nodded his head to Weasley and said, ‘ and lack of attention’, and turned his body around to walk away but he was stopped by Weasley’s voice.
Mother looks at him with a questioning look before looking down at the item in her hand, when she realized it, she quickly glanced up at him. He stood there waiting while Mother tried to come up with an explanation, Cassie who was clearly enjoying her breakfast stopped her chewing.
Harry’s body gave up on him and fell on top of Draco, while Draco’s knees gave up on him, his body smothering Draco’s, his body pin Draco’s to the bed, not intending to detach from him yet, he needs to feel his soft pliant body against his.
Draco had to burst out loud, he can’t contained it anymore, “Weasley! What happened to you? You? A Hufflepuff? Don’t make me laugh!”, shouted Draco. Most of the Slytherins joined in laughing at Weasley.
Potter, the boy was so stupid that he stared at his hand, then stared at his face, then turned his face towards Weasley and that’s how he knows that Potter choose Weasley with the silent treatment.
He was amazed with Quirrell because he put out a great act. Why should he fainted in the hall, should have just faint as he was looking at the troll, that much more convincing.
Harry bent his body forward, his chest falling against Draco’s back. His arms wrapped around Draco’s lithe body, covering his body with his own immense one, hands slithering it slowly to Draco’s boobs, groping it from behind. One hand fondled his boob while his other hands twirling and tweaking his other nipple, he held himself up by his elbows.
“So, by pushing me into an empty classroom and kissed me aggressively, your meaning of ‘doing something’?”, said Draco as he smiled cheekily.
He then walked into Draco’s nursery room, taking in the surroundings trying to remember it. A room that will never be resided by Draco, he will never watch his boy growing up but he hopes that Draco will have a good life with The Malfoys.
Draco closes his eyes again, his body was already tired, he thought everything was done until the fucking healer told him to fucking push the placenta out.
So there’s going to be a big exam by the end of the year. I need to put head in my school subject since I took nine subject that needed to be pass or not I will die by the wrath of my mom.
Beside him, Granger was wearing a blue robe while Weasley was wearing a Hufflepuff coloured robe. Both of them looked weird wearing that colour but Potter though, he was speechless, he can’t even describe what a great impact he had on Draco right now.
“Last year, both of you took seven subject consisting Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology.”, said father while examine their exam reports again.
A blonde girl, her hair is pushed aside by the night air. Her feet are dangling out of the tower. Once in a while, she would bring the cigarette butt to her mouth.
His legs bring him inside the compartment as his hands slide the door close. He sat across from her, wanting to look at her face. When he gets a quick look at her, she looks as pale as he is. Is she his long lost second cousin or third cousin or something because he learned about his Black and Malfoy’s family tree. Most of the Malfoys have the platinum blonde hair, he doesn’t know any other family besides him who have that shade of hair before. He know this since he learned about his heritage and family tree when he was young and thought that the topic was bullshit since most of them are dead anyways.
Draco’s legs automatically wrapped around Harry’s waist as he fuck him hard, arms wrapping around his neck. Harry’s hand went to his nipples, he pulled his nipple, pinching it until the buds is hard, he then twirled his nipple around with his fingers while his other hand groped his boob.
Severus with arms crossed turned his head towards the three of them and addressed, “And you three, why are you three were late?”, Blaise was trembling beside him while Theo kept on tapping his foot because they were both scared at Severus’s cold demeanour. Draco felt pity for them and decided to explain and when he was done, Severus didn't even take any point from them. He took out his Potion book and enlarged it.
He nudged him and looked at his face, “I know because I was the one who saw his face when the twins needed more of your attention, he thinks that you shifted your love for him to the twins and the only way he dealt with it is being stubborn and kept his silence.”
He don’t know why but when Hagrid called him Draco, something warm set inside of him so the irritation of Hagrid assigning Longbottom with him died down a little but he was still annoyed that he got Longbottom.
Harry tried to give Jamie to him but he was resisting by grabbing Harry’s shirt firmly with his chubby hands.
He looked around the room and saw that both Weasley and Potter was looking at him with wide eyes, he sneered their way and turned his attention towards his sister.
‘ I don’t think it was fair actually’, he looked down and sighs as he shrugged his shoulders, giving a dramatic effect to his situation.
The photos inside the album have a lot of pictures of a young blonde hair woman he had never known and heard of, who looked exactly like the female version of Father. Maybe that’s why Mother kept the photo album hidden.
Harry growled into the idea as he was still sucking on Draco’s breast, the feeling of the nipples inside his mouth while his other hand are playing with the other. When he was satisfied, his turn his attention towards the other nipple, the nipple he was playing with and suck on it, harder and harder.
Draco tilted his head to the side, tapping his finger to his chin, giving it a thought before he decided to mess with him some more.
As he come to bend his body forward, he felt his husband’s rough hand around his shoulders and lips on his temple.
“You should have told me, you romantic fool,” laughed Draco at his boyfriend’s antics, he kissed him passionately on the lips and laid back down.
Draco shoved his food in front of his face, silently asking him if he wanted to take a bite of Draco’s food, he shook his head no.
He lifts his head, Harry does the same and they meet in between and give a chaste kiss before Jamie gets to push them apart because he’s a jealous boy who wanted his mama for himself.
His hands roamed around Harry’s body, nails digging into his muscle arms as he fucked him harder the minute goes by.
‘If you are rather fond of your left hand, you can use it instead of your right hand,’ she explained. ‘But it was easier for people to use their right hand in Quidditch so that’s why I didn’t mention it’, she added. She paused for a second and looked at the students as if the students were to have any more questions to ask before they could start and when she found none, she continued, ‘And now we can continue, say “Up”’
The next day while they are in DADA classroom, Draco had a difficulty with sitting and walking that he have to do it very slowly or else a shock of pain will hit him, his friends notice this of course but Bryan, one of his friends was the only one who had the courage to ask him while they were standing closely to Harry, practicing their wand movement and trying the new spell Harry taught for his class.
Draco stroked Jamie’s back up and down repeatedly as he was sucking his nipple, he can feel the pull of the milk out of his body. Although Jamie was two years old, he still haven’t stop breastfed and Draco was okay with it because his breast feel heavy when it was full of milk, Harry sometimes help too.
‘I don’t know which is worst, Pans or the troll, both smell the same but at least you smell better’, whispered Blaise to them. Pansy shoved his arm aggressively that made him almost tumble.
The nubs came into hardness as he bit the nubs softly but still can leave bruise. His fingers was flicking and twiddling his other nubs.
With trembling hand, he hid the skull and turn his back towards father and Mr Borkin, walking slowly to his destination.
The dragon will be sent to somewhere on Saturday night; Potter and friends are on it, they will bring the letter to the tallest tower which is the Astronomy Tower at midnight. Should he tell a professor on them? If he did tell on them, it would be Professor McGonagall since she was the head of their house and they will get in so much trouble than any other professor.
When he finally arrived in front of the portrait door to the Slytherin Common Room, he whispered the password and the door opened involuntarily, the common room was filled with students, some of them were looking out into the huge window that shows the Black Lake, he doesn’t even know what are they looking for, probably the merman but they rarely show. Some of them are studying since final exam are coming and some are playing with their mates.
“So you are saying that you and her were just friends since the middle of September? Like just friends?”
He avoids eye contact with Potter and leaves the compartment with Cassie in front of him. They walked through the deserted and narrow hallway until they came to a stop on compartment full of Pureblood children that they knew.
Draco nodded his head while looking rather annoyed at Pansy’s antic. He sighed again, what in the bloody hell is his four years old mind thinking, choosing Pansy to be his friend?
Harry’s mouth left his and went trailing down to his neck, brushed his hair to the side by nudging his head.
It took them ten minutes to come back from their sex euphemism. While Harry is still inside of him, switching their position so Harry was laying on the ground, Draco laid on top of him while he was still naked but the spare blanket Harry bought helped them cover their naked parts.
“Harry- Let’s just quietly get the hell out of here. Please”, begged Draco, pulling his hand but suddenly the cloaked figure looked up as they hear Draco’s voice and at that moment, he knows he was going to die.
All night, they kept on trying to find as many constellations as they could, while he was helping tracing the stars with the tip of his finger, he was also trying to show Harry the Draco constellation.
Well he knows the answer of course because he rejected most of them who advance in asking him to be their boyfriend, but most of them were too plain or just too cocky, reminding him of his father’s personality which he hates.
He looked at them and shook his head and shrugged his shoulders slightly, he took a path to the right with Longbottom trailing behind him, Fang cowering at his legs. He can’t believe he got the two cowards, even though he was scared too right now but at least he doesn’t show it .. yet.
‘If I prove it to you, what can you guys give me?’ he said while thinking of a prank he could give them.
Professor McGonagall was so stunned that she stared at him for a long time because he dared to defy the Gryffindor founder's hat’s decision. He doesn’t care what people think of him right now because right now he gets what he wants and he wants to be put into Slytherin.
At breakfast, he heard from Pansy, she’s loves to gossip which is a good thing for him, that Potter received a large parcel and a letter from someone. Draco thought the large parcel must be a broom for him since who are going to buy him a broomstick, he’s an orphan.
Draco scratch Harry’s back, leaving a long scratch marks. Harry’s mouth connected to him, they kissed passionately. When Harry kissed him, he felt nothing else matter in the world except them.
“The fact that I taught you about Pureblood ideology since you were just a mere child and you still disobey me by being with her.”
“Oh Miss Potter, I had nothing against those, I’m trying to see to what length you were willing to defend my child’s honour. I am always proud of Celestial, I admit that I don’t say quite as often as I should and I was ashamed of it. In the end, all that matters is my daughter’s happiness. Thank you instead and you can stay for the night if you like and with that,” she calmly stood up and sauntered to her husband, her shell-shocked of a husband.
“Fuck-”, said Harry as his muscular arms lifts Draco off of him, he then slips his arms under Draco, sat up, flicked his hand, wandlessly turning off the light and the telly and carry him to their bedroom.
He then followed Hagrid back to the other group, face still fuming red. This is all Longbottom’s fault, if it was not for his cowardice, he wouldn’t even be in this situation but at least he caught everything on camera, memories he could never forget.
He didn’t realise that the feast had already ended and was told to walk back to their dormitories, Cassie was there to shake him out of his assumption about the bad thing Dobby was talking about.
They were carried along a dark tunnel, until they reached a kind of underground harbour, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. Then they clambered up a passageway.
“Cassiopeia! Draco! Come now. We don’t want to associate ourselves with these kind” called father for them but none of them move, they were paralyze on the spot because father’s face are red, it means that he was so angry.
He hung up the phone call and took the helmet from Harry’s waiting hand, their hands slightly brushing against each other. His cheeks flushed, when his brother did that in the restaurant, he felt nothing but when it was Harry, he felt all sorts of giddy feelings.
Harry was being impatient so with a swish of his fingers, his jeans and Draco’s underwear were torn off from their body. Both of them were naked now, facing each other with nothing covering them.
Before he gets to question himself in his mind what Harry is trying to do. Harry declared his proposal, his hands are slowly opening the red coloured ring box.
Both Hermione and him looked at their significant others and rolled their eyes at their husband’s antics.
“But I think the person I fancy is still oblivious to my feelings because she still hasn't made any move yet or maybe I should kiss her right here right now to make her realise who I’m talking about, right?’
‘Of course Potter, from the sweat that we produce, we can already tell,” said Draco as he rolled his eyes while shaking his head,
He stood up from the stool and bowed in front thousands of Hogwarts students and smirked, everyone was speechless. He walked towards the Slytherin table and sat next to Cassie who had saved him a seat. She then questioned him and told him that he was a hatstall, he was proud of himself because only a few people were hatstall.
The horrible smell came from the troll. Bloody hell, the troll was hideous. No word could ever describe the hideous looking troll.
As they inhaled and exhaled the smoke, a silent night stood between them. None of them decided to talk but for some reason, she didn’t care. She likes it.
They are finally done with their N.E.W.T.s exams, they both agree to finally tell the Malfoy’s that her daughter is dating The Girl-Who-Lived Twice. Celestial was having a panic attack while discussing it until Iris agreed to stop.
“No, Jamie. Behave or else you won’t get breastfeed tonight.”, scolded Draco as if Jamie understood every word he said but he did pull his hand away.
A tap on his shoulders makes him breaks his concentration on Dobby, he turned his head and suddenly knocked himself down to the floor as the loud ‘Boo’ scared him to death.
“Merlin, not just the hat could sort people, it could also sing, please make it stop, I rather listen to Dobby singing that piece of dirty cloth”, he thought to himself and grimace.
‘You-Me, Common Room. Now!’, commanded Cassie. He raised his hands in surrender and rolled his eyes as Cassie was walking in front of her.
He heard a knock on the door and went to open it, it was Harry. He was wearing a white long sleeve shirt where the sleeves was folded and a black jeans. He was beautiful.
Growing up, he always wondered why they didn't have a baby photo of him when he was a mere minutes old, why they started taking photos of him after the age of one and a half but he never spoke about his curiosity to anyone.
He scolds her behind her back, and from the corner of his eyes, he sees that Weasley and Potter were delighted since he has been bragging a lot about Quidditch in front of them.
“It’s okay, my body is yours, you could do anything you want with me.” Mumbled Draco, his voice vibrating to his chest.
Did Mr Borkin just called him Master - again? It sounds so weird and he hated the title but he didn’t show his disgust on the title. How many times he have to tell this old man to not call him Master? He visited the shop twice and twice had he instruct him to not call him master.
He rather studying alone instead of asking for someone for help especially Goldstein but as long as it works on Potter, he doesn’t mind.
“Yes, I want you to meet my girlfriend, Iris Potter. The same person who is killed the Dark Lord and yes the same woman who has been my nemesis since first year and who is also the same person I talk about since first year through sixth year and she is also the - ”
Harry took a seat at the left side while he took the place in front of Harry with Jamie sitting on his right side because he is a mama’s boy.
Finally he had solved it, when he realised that the inscription was spelled backward as he read it, he sobbed lightly.
“Yeah sure,” he chuckled softly for the first time that night before he continued, “Will it be alright if there’s a few pickles in it?”
So, he obeyed and moaned, his moaning rang around the room, he don’t know what happened but then he felt the tip Harry’s huge thick cock around his opening.
Potter bend his knees till they reached his head, leaving a clear view of his hole for Potter to see.He looked down at Potter, he was grasping his hard length by the base instead.
He don’t know why he couldn’t. He felt there’s something wrong with him. He nodded his head indicating that he understood what Dobby meant.
As they were walking to the study room, Iris took her hand in hers, “We got this, Cel. I know we can go through this. We go through war and we surely can go through this together.”
Once he was done, he put the container back into the basket, wiped his mouth with the handkerchief that was provided by Harry.
Finally, his son’s eyes dropped to the bottom, eyelids fluttering shut, his mouth stopped sucking, milk leaking out at the corner of his lips. He slid his finger and wiped it away. He moved his body around and lay Cory down next to his brother, pulling his hand away once Cory’s back hit the blanket they shared.
‘Okay then, give me truth or dare’, he had an idea in his mind but he hopes Pansy don’t ask him some ridiculous truth because he was going to pick truth no matter what the question is or he hopes so.
“Ah, so this is the boy’s problem,'' he thought to himself and smirked, Draco didn’t interrupt them because he wants to know where the conversation will go.
“And what can I get you?” When all of the family members are done ordering, he turns his attention towards Harry.
He then turns towards Potter, “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”, and walked away.
Unfortunately, Professor Flitwick didn’t end there, he had to walk around the corner to his station and conjured a bouquet of flowers for him, the bouquet was huge that the flowers could hide his face behind it.
With the last touch on the bow, he was ready to work, he checked himself in the mirror, patting his maroon button-up long sleeve shirt, smoothing it so it doesn’t crease. His shirt was tucked inside the black pants he was wearing.
“Draco, I found it,” Cassie called for him but his eyes was too focus on the old newspaper, while Draco was reading the article about his mother’s cousin, Cassie was flipping through the album and found something strange, she glanced up to her brother and around the wall that hang their family portrait and glanced back down on the album.
“So, my last name is not Malfoy but Black? And does anyone know that Sirius Black has a son? And why was he in Azkaban?” he bombarded her mother with questions.
Draco stood up from the couch and headed out of the common room to the Great Hall since he was hungry and it’s dinner time. He looks at Blaise with a silent question hanging around them and Blaise too stood up and followed him to the Great Hall.
Don’t tell Hermione this but Celestial is better at teaching than Hermione. She understood every single word that came out of her mouth. She makes their studies interesting by adding a little bit of commentary of her own.
Although his vision was blurry, he can see his husband was holding on to his second child, he still haven’t know the gender yet because when they did their monthly check-up and the healer told him if they wanted to know the gender of their babies, they’re both shaking their head no, they wanted it to be a surprise.
“I mean he’s twelve, would there be any girl who would want to kiss him right now?”, asked Draco as his hand are reaching for one of their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor,
Draco stroke his hair as he usually did with Jamie, move his fringe out of the way, his hair is a bit wet from the shower.
As they walked inside the shop, their nose was assaulted by the scent of freshness, the cold air swept across their faces. Draco took one of the trolley that the shop provided, his husband carried his son and place him inside on the seat.
‘I’ve been waiting for this day’, whispered Potter in his ear, Draco nodded in agreement because he can’t deny this part of him anymore, the part that wants Potter.
Jamie was yawning from exhaustion and fullness, Draco took his hand and walked him to his room, since it was a quarter past nine, it was his bedtime.
“Now it’s my turn for your attention.”, smirked Harry, looking at him up and down, hands already coming to the hem of his shirt and lifted it up leisurely, Draco complied as he lifted both of his arms and seconds later, the shirt was already off his body.
The Potters ring a forgotten bell in his mind, he knows that the Potters are rich like the Malfoys but they were rich and famous since James Potter is a retired football player whilst his wife, Lily Potter is a well-known actress. What really rings a bell in his head is their first son, Harry Potter.
He knows that Blaise can be too protective over his friends so he quickly stood up and took his hand, dragged him away before Blaise got the chance to make a scene. That is the last thing he needs for the first day of school.
Longbottom was still holding on to Potter but tighter, he even made a choking noise and Draco had to sniff his laugh because Potter was trying so hard to get his hand off of him.
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. When Draco saw that ‘something’, he froze on his spot, eyes never leaving the dead unicorn as the silver bloody leaking out of the unicorn’s dead body.
Hands quickly reach out for her unfinished assignment to pack up. To find her, maybe asking if she - no she can’t. It would seem rude to just ask for her sexuality out of nowhere. She thought of ways of bringing the subject up, she didn’t register that her feet had brought her to the eighth year common room until Ron slapped her in the back, asking if she knew where Hermione was.
When Cassie was done paying for the books, Draco was confused because there is no single book in her hand that he have to ask her about it. “Where’s the books?”, asked Draco as he scrunched his eyebrows.
As she smoked the cigarette, her brain was describing Celestial’s features. How her face has aristocratic features. Just everything about her is so perfect.
He’s increased peeing makes him lose one kilogram. He sometimes took a long nap to save his energy for the later. A dull ache in his back and usually asking Harry for a message and he happily obliged.
He shouldn’t have given in to her puppy eyes on her pug face. Yes, he just insulted his friend in his internal monologue because he wouldn’t dare to call her that in front of her face. Let’s just say that he learned his lesson when they were just a mere child.
Without responding to her question, she walked up and sat herself beside her, a small space between them. She then got handed a cigarette.
“Your obsession with Harry Potter is not healthy, Dobby.” Draco laughed at Dobby's embarrassed face at being caught. He patted Dobby’s head just because he felt like it. Dobby giggled while hiding his face with his dirty clothes, not that it help or anything.
The ride took them thirty minutes to arrive at the grocery shop called ‘ Wizardry Grocery’ since they lives in Muggle London and away from the Wizarding Community because Harry hates it whenever he walked out of the house , people will look at him with admiration, paparazzi trying to get his pictures, some fans wanted his autograph, eyes watching his every move, he hates being suffocated and they agree to move to muggle area.
Draco wiped his mouth furiously and asked Goldstein if the sauce are still there, Goldstein chuckled softly and brought his hand to his face and wiped the sauce off his face. Before he got to thank him, Slughorn opens the door to the Potion room and ushered them in while The golden trio with an additional of Pansy and Blaise come up to them.
Now he was terrified, where did she go now. He last saw her when she was rushing somewhere but at that time, he didn’t care to notice where she went because he just got back from the library, eyes tired trying to find any information about the stupid dog.
He didn't know what to say with the new information so he walked out of the dining room into his room. He was speechless, how dare Sirius Black left him only after three months his mother had died. Does he not care about him, does he want revenge so badly that he did not regret killing those innocent Muggles, does he didn’t even think about him before he went after Pettigrew.
‘Not at all, Professor’, he said as he took a sniffed of the potion. ‘I smelled vanilla and..’, as he took another sniffed. ‘green apples and chocolates.’ Draco was looking at him as they locked their eyes together. Beside him, Potter made a loud huffed as his eyes looked at him, then to Goldstein and back to him.
Draco was deep in his thoughts when he heard knocks on the door, Cassies head peaked inside, “What do you what?” he asked.
‘Hey there handsome’, said Draco as he walked to him to greet him and give him a chaste kiss but Harry sneaked his arms around his waist and now they were having a heated kiss.
By the way, he got another whacked in the head from Pansy because he had been using her binocular for a long time that she missed when Potter caught the Snitch.
They walked out of the shop, Draco turned his head to look at the boy, the boy looked back at him, and they waved each other goodbye.
He even asks Harry if his ears are working because he actually can’t believe it. Father approves of them? Maybe he probably missed his son to come home to him - probably.
“What are you doing back here? I thought you and your family had left?” he questioned, squinting his eyes while looking up at him with the light blinding his eyes.
He sometimes hates his name because it was too ‘unique’ and no one in the modern days shared the same name with him but now, he took it back because he feels special knowing that Harry would probably says him when only mentioning him.
For the first time in forever, Remus saw the pain in his eyes, Sirius was never a sad person even after he had run away from home or had a miserable childhood. Sirius was a joyful person who never let sadness overtake him, but today, he was defeated.
It was in the middle of February, Iris was studying alone in the library, no Hermione, no Ron and especially no Celestial but unfortunately, she spoke too soon because ten minutes later, Hermione came barging with stacks of books in her arms, her hair is bushier than usual.
The flashing light of the camera make them pulled themselves away but slowly from each other, well they are going to be in the paper again but at least they got him on his good side.
Potter’s hard penis rubbed continuously on Draco with Potter still in his trouser but he took care of it by taking them off himself, by the look on Potter’s face, he can tell that Potter was impatient to get himself naked for Draco.
“Everybody knows about that, just because your family has the money doesn't mean that they looked up to you guys,” he said in a mocking way and curl one lip up.
“Regulus James, I can’t just force your sister out yet. She was still comfortable being inside of me,” Draco explained,
“After this we are going to buy your racing broom, I want you to be in the Slytherin quidditch team this year.”, said father as he place the chest on the counter, his arms lazily rests on top of the counter.
“yes … hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me … It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out … hang you by your wrist from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ‘em well oiled in case they’re ever needed … Right, off we go, and don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”
“We sometimes studies secretly, something about your father”, answered Granger. If she’s going to blackmail him using his sister then he might have to pull ‘my father will heard about this’ card.
‘ I think we’ve lost him,’ Potter panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiped his forehead. Draco casts a cooling charm at Cassie, Blaise and himself since they were sweating furiously from the running. Longbottom was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. He decided to take pity on him and cast the spell on him too.
Finally, after a long minute of Professor McGonagall looking stunned, she came back to her senses and addressed him.
Tongue jabbing and invading his hole, the tongue went deeper inside of him and sucked hard that his cheeks were sucked.
“You are going to cum like this”, groaned Harry, “You are going to cum like this with me above you like this”. Draco can feel his muscle are clenching around the ring, with him holding onto Harry’s bulge arms.
Draco could still hear them as he forgot to cancel the spell, with a swish of his wand, he could no more hear their conversation.
“How’s your ribs? You know, from getting kneed by me and the bruised jaws?”, asked Draco, trying to get some rise out of him.
With a hoarse voice, Draco asked him for the time. Harry casts a wandless tempus and it shows that they were late for their Transfiguration lesson. He hopes that Professor McGonagall was a having a good morning because he don’t want to mess with her.
Being a good friend that he is, he casts a spell on Dobby’s injuries without a second though so that it will not hurt badly, although Draco did a terrible job at healing it because Dobby’s burn are still hurt but not terribly. His burn turned into a red coloured, he could see the flesh of Dobby’s second layer of skin . He knows it will take a few months to grow a new skin and it can cause scarring.
‘I saw how their eyes went when they saw that you are wearing a lingerie under the skirt, I can’t take my eyes of you, baby but thank god I recorded the whole process of you making tik tok’, Harry pushed him down to the bed on his back. Harry then flipped him over presenting his arse for Harry’s eyes .
Harry’s head went to his round stomach, kissing it lightly all over the area he could reach. “How are they doing today?”, asked Harry, his hand are coming up to Draco’s thigh, knead it smoothly, inch by inch, he can feel two fingers invading his hole but not quite inside yet, rubbing his fingers at his opening.
Before they were unconscious, Jamie intentionally shoved his father’s hand away from embracing his Mama.
Finally, he gave a long breath and looked into his cousin's eyes, “I need you to take care of Draco for me, I know that you will cherish him and I know Lucius will take him because it's his sister's son”.
Harry brought his rough hand to Draco’s red tinted cheek, Draco curled his face into it, he let his guards down because he felt safe around Harry.
He doesn’t have to figure what was Sirius and him were doing as the next moment, Sirius stood up from the mirror and walked his way towards his mother. He took his father’s place and he was playing a slow song as he saw Amelia was resting her head on Sirius’s shoulder, swaying their body slowly as the music goes.
She promised the word as she looked into her dazzling grey eyes, a few frustrated tears were leaking out of it, Iris quickly helped her wiping it away. Celestial hides her face away into Iris’s chest. The soft thumping of her heart forced her into a dreamland.
It took Draco three weeks to plan on how to trick Theo  since he still haven’t apologise for what he said to Cassie and being a great brother that he is, he will gladly help his sister in any situation, the opportunity is very hard to find while Draco was still trying to find any information about the three- headed dog. He knows the dog guarded a stone, a very powerful stone, he overhead the trio said.
, is what their relationship is because she definitely won’t let her go once she gets the angel in front of her.
Draco scoffed at his husband’s words and denied the accusation, turning his body facing his husband, he lightly kisses him on the lips as he wound his arms around his husband’s neck, thumb slightly rubbing the back of his neck.
“I already put silencing charm around the room and we can hear what’s going on outside.”, said Harry as pulled his hand away from his mouth.
“How are those black eye from weeks ago? Still remember the feeling of my fist connected to yours?”, said Weasley biting back.
Once he settled inside at the opposite edge of the tub, he pulled Draco into his lap, and he went willingly without any protest. His husband will always bring him the warmth and comfort he needed on days like these.
“You are the best boy Daddy could ever find.” He knows he should stop, stop with all of this because Draco is just 16 years old who has a whole future in front of him but the thought of another cock that’s not his inside of this beautiful body makes him see red.
After so long in the bathroom, he walks out and chooses his outfit for the day, he wears a plain blue shirt just for the eyes of the resident of the manor and a pair of black trousers, perfecting his hair and he’s done.
When the last item was put in the trunk, Draco stood up and walked to the dining hall. He opened the door and observed the room, there was his father who sat at the end of the table which is the head sit where father always sits, while Mother sat at his right hand side, Cassie was beside her.
The Gryffindors arrived thirty minutes after them, Draco can clearly see the excitement on their faces, he saw Potter chatting with his friends happily and he felt something in his heart that he can’t explain.
After a few minutes of searching for his goddamn phone, he finally found it under his pillow, he felt dumb because he doesn’t remember putting it there. He locked into his phone and search for Blaise’s contact number and call him.
“PAPA DRIVE PAPA!” screamed Jamie excitedly as he looks around his surrounding. “Wait Jamie, the car needs to warm up first,” said Harry as he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.
“Now get out! Both of you. We will resume our discussion, I have a few matter I have to discuss with you, Draco.” Without waiting for a second, Draco take Cassie’s hand and pulled them out of the hellhole.
Draco walked passed them and to his shared dorm, Blaise and Theo are probably not in the room, maybe somewhere in the library with Cassie and Pansy so their shared dorm must be empty.
As she told her story with an exchange of hers as well while smoking cigarettes she realised that she had fallen in love with her. She didn’t know when the feeling appeared. It could probably be last year when her eyes shrunk with no lights trying to find a way in killing Dumbledore, or when she saved her from the fire or even when she tossed her wand back to her.
The name goes with alphabetical order so Draco still has the time to be nervous, he looked over Cassie and saw that she too was nervous and he gave her a private smile.
The only reason why he couldn’t is because Father wouldn’t allow him, besides he lived in an urban area where there is no hill, only other mansions stood meters away.
He groped his boob hard enough that milk coming out of it, streaming down his body.Harry was watching it with fascination shown on his face.
‘Draco’, he called out to him calmly as his eyes looking at the cold bare wall, not looking at Severus.
“Why don’t you eat, Draco?” asked Cassie worriedly for some reason. “Not hungry,” he replied as he pushed his plate further from him.
“Harry-please.. fuck me please! Baby I need you in me, making love to me until I faint, until I was restless. With you on top of him, thrusting in me until I screamed”, begged Draco again but sadly he was denied as Harry kept on sucking his nipples.
Draco stood there, stoned cold when he heard Mr Weasley spoke about his biological mother like that, he felt angry and sad but most important he felt betrayed by father because he wouldn’t tell him who was the murderers who killed his sister, even if he didn’t know, he was the one who supposed to explain to him everything about her, not Mother since she was his sister.
“Sleep, love. You are tired”, said Harry with the last ounce of energy he had left before his eyes dropped. His arms involuntarily tighten his hold on Draco.
“What- what do you mean that I’m not your son? I clearly has both grey and blue eyes, and I have platinum blonde hair just like you guys, it's just one strands of black hair although I don’t have both of yours straight hair,” He spluttered all the words that came out of his mind, trying to deny the truth with anything - that he was a Malfoy by name. That he was not Sirius Black’s son.
‘ Away from the cry-baby’, said Cassie casually, not looking at Theo, who she knows are looking at her right now.
Harry wandlessly and wordlessly accio his phone back and begin recording him fucking the hell out of Draco. The phone is hovering around them, recording every moment he intends to never forget. He even has a collection of videos and photos of him and Draco, doing things no one knows, both innocent and dirty things.
‘Little Malfoy, wandering around the castle at night- Tut Tut-  Slytherin Firstie, It’s the second time now I caught you wandering’, Peeves cackled, he was smiling deviously, squinting his eyes at him.
“Fuck- Harry of course Harry! Fuck I love you - I love you my fiancé. Of course I would be your husband, Of course I’ll be Draco Potter. It’s a yes Harry, a thousand yes.”
Although he was far from them, he could hear and see Mr Weasley cheeks flushed darker than when he was taunting his children, few minutes ago.
They invited their family members two weeks after Draco gave birth to their house, meeting the new members of the Potter’s family. It was the only day where Draco and Harry were free from the babies because the Weasley’s wanted to hold them.
Before they even have the time to speak about it, Dobby appeared inside the room stating that their Mother was calling for them to come down, when Draco appeared looking suspicious, Dobby told him to not do anything stupid and disappeared out of the room. Draco quickly shoved the piece of the newspaper inside his pocket robe and Cassie was trying to put back the photograph in the rightful place but Draco held her wrist to stop her.
“Hello Hogwarts too?” he greeted the messy black hair boy, the boy who was fascinated with the needles and the cotton that was levitating around him looked up from his observation, turning his face to look at him.
The crack sound of an apparition indicating that Dobby finally heard he was being called. Dobby bowed down to him, his pencil-like nose touched the ground. “Draco called for Dobby, sir?”
At this point, Draco looked to Cassie for help, she signed and agreed with Mother. Draco felt defeated and slumped his shoulder down and continued walking to the Apparition point with them.
Enjoy this fic, not much Drarry moment but it's whatever. sorry again if this fic won't be your cup of tea. But this fic dive deeper into relationship between Lucius and Draco, the family relationship. You would know that Draco sometimes are conflicted about the Malfoys.
He moves his eyes to another fruit when he was pleased with his choice, right now he was searching for dragon fruits because Jamie loves those and he was going to buy more just for his son. He picked up the fruit and show it to Jamie.
Harry was wearing a slim black jeans matching with a blue short sleeves shirt tugged inside, he looks so hot right now - not that he was never not hot in the first place.
Draco, who can sense his father’s emotion, tugged his wavy black hair lightly and giggled. Moony handed Draco back to him, he cradled him to his chest and whispered softly to his ears, although the whispers is only for Draco, Moony can clearly hear it.
Harry spells his fingers with lube, sleeked finger enter his hole, moving in and out. Their body are moving in sync with each other.
This can’t be but his brain won’t work, even the advance spell that he read from the library, that he was fascinated with won’t resurface to his mind until a spell came up.
To make his husband happy, Harry just nodded his head and agreed to whatever Draco said, although he for sure knew he cannot live without his cock.
Daphne walked towards the hat and sat on the stool, she acted calming but he can tell that she was nervous because her fingers were twiddling.
What does the centaur mean? Don’t let vengeance consume him? And the statement he gave on Potter, what does that mean?
Draco hopes that Madam Hooch was stripped from her job because she’s doing a bloody bad job at it and thought of what would happened if she really getting fired, an image of her throwing a tantrum, stomping her feet and fly off riding a giant hawk leaving the school ground popped out in his head and laughed at the thought but the Slytherins thought that he was laughing at Longbottom.
“Your Jamie was a menace and he definitely got that attitude from you, your little troublemaker while your twin babies are literal angel like their mama.”, praised Draco at himself, he heard Harry chuckled at him.
“Come sit, love,” patting the empty spot beside him while he searched through the basket and taking some food out, Draco obliged.
‘Mr Malfoy!’, she addressed loud and steely that the echo of silence of the hall filled with her voice. ‘Put the hat back on’, she said sternly but Draco did not obey her orders. He turned his head around, facing her and grinned, ‘Sorry professor, need to have a few words with this fabulous and intelligent hat,’ he said softly, hiding an agenda under the soft voice he used.
“No, its uglee,” pouting his lips, turning his head looking down at the hideous clothes he had chosen for him in his hand, instead Jamie walked to his wardrobe and pulled his favourite shirt out, walked back to him and shove the soft material to his face.
Draco woke up to the sound of feet scrambling around, he rubs his eyes while Blaise told him to change into school robe quickly because they are already late for their first lesson of the day, Potion. Hell, Severus will surely tell his mother on him.
‘You are Potter to me when you being insufferable’, as he looked down to the ground, flushed cheeks.
The sounds of a door closing makes him open his eyes, alerted of his surroundings. He looked out the window and it was already night time, he crawled out of bed and ran to his husband to pick a fight for not waking him up. He was supposed to have a quick nap, not hours of deep sleep.
“Yes, love. I’m helping you cross one of your bucket lists.” said Harry as he was checking his pocket with one hand by patting it and holding the picnic basket with another hand.
‘At least I had a broomstick I get to ride. What do you get at home? A broom that could only swipe the floor.’ He smirked. ‘ Merlin forbid your house needed a lot of those’, said Draco as he inspected his nails, looking bored and he continued.
From that moment, they had a mutual agreement to not talk about what they discussed in this room. It was their secret to tell, and anyways he thinks that maybe Severus was embarrass about the hug he gave him. It was an embarrassing moment for him too anyways.
Celestial isn’t embarrassed to be seen with the woman, just was scared of her parents reaction, especially Narcissa Malfoy. She used to care about what her father thinks of her but now, the only person she wants to accept who she is is her mother.
His driver told him he will be there in forty minutes. Holy fuck, forty minutes it’s a long time but it would be a complete comprehensible since his driver came from his house. Which should take him longer than forty minutes.
‘Dumbledore told me about the mirror’, Severus spoken those few sentence careful, watching his reaction.
And just like that, Celestial took her head into the palm of her hands and kissed her hard. Iris eyes wide open like saucers until she grasps the possibility that it is in fact her crush’s mouth on hers.
Firstly are because he rarely saw him and if he did, he can sense that he hid a lot of secrets just by looking at his eyes if someone are looking closely.
It was his baby, his body finally let him relax, the healer asked Harry if he wanted to cut the cord, with a big fat ugly tear straining his face, Harry nodded his head furiously and cast a spell to cut the cord.
The sound of apparition marks that Dobby was here, “What does young master Draco need?”, asked Dobby as he bow down his head to him, hiding his hands away from Draco’s eyes.
“Fuck.. Draco”, murmured Harry as he was trailing kisses down to Draco’s neck and bite down hard the soft flesh skin.
She smirked at him as if she knows what’s he’s doing, ‘Okay tell me what actually happen in summer 1994?’.
“And I’m trying to do what’s best for you, which is to stop studying,” he says sternly, finally winning the game of tugging Draco’s book from his hand. He adjusted the books and grabbed his boyfriend’s hand to pull him up.
He remembered something about what Father said to them something about the Chamber of Secret. He won’t tell him anything more than necessarily The last and only thing he told him about the chamber is that someone died, a muggleborn to be exact.
He snapped a photo of him and posted it on his Instagram page, showing off his fiancé wearing the ring he proposed to - to his millions of followers.
“But what if Daddy got you pregnant? We wouldn’t want your parents to disown you, right? You are still a teenager, but it’s alright because Daddy will take care of his baby anyways.”
The hall was burst with applause when the hat was done singing. Professor McGonagall stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
“Both? I don’t think I lose my memories whenever I give birth but I can clearly remember I gave birth to three boys,” said Draco sarcastically. “Even after you gave birth, your Malfoy’s trait never stray away from you,” laughed Harry as he sat himself down in the hospital bed, Draco scooted his body to the side, giving Harry a place to sit on the bed.
“Thanks, Potter for not judging me,” she sighed, probably with her eyes closed since Iris is still had her head facing the sky, locking her eyes with the stars in the sky, admiring the star from afar and the star close to her, trying very hard to act that her body pressed against hers means absolutely nothing to her body and brain.
The end of the school year finally came and he was already twelve years old three weeks before, he was showered with a lot of gifts since he was a spoiled brat, he appreciate it nonetheless.
Cassie and Draco would practiced by themselves with no help of an adult because Mother is a pristine Pureblood wife and it will bring a bad image if someone saw her riding a broom and so she said and Father always have no time for them because of the business at the Ministry he has to attend. Since they were small, they would help each other out so they don’t need adult’s help much.
It was the first time he pushed Cassie off when he wanted comfort so bad, especially from her. Cassie looked back at him from the door, he even thought that she was going to say something but in the end, she decided not to.
“But Mother, please I will not let the Kneazle roam around the manor, I will just keep it inside my room,” Draco hopes for his begging work.
‘Cassie!’, he shouted as the door unlocked by the spell, he pushed the door open, Cassie was pointing his wand at the troll, Granger was hiding behind her, both of their faces shown an emotion of fright.
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said father. “All those raids … I hope they’re paying you overtime?”, asked father in a mocking way. So he decided to speak up so they don’t cause any trouble, “Father, I think it was time go now. We have everything we needed.”
“Why don’t you go fuck yourself, Malfoy.”, said Weasley viciously but then he went silent for a while, looking up the ceiling so Draco decided to push him.
He was only wearing a tank top and booty shorts so to him, it was easy to tear it off his body and change into his wolf form. He stood there naked for five seconds as he closed his eyes, his brain conjuring his wolf form image.
She feels like in a dream, a dream where everything is surreal and sunny. She can’t describe the feelings she is having right now. It was like in the dream where she and Celestial are kissing but the twist is, she is definitely not dreaming because she pinched herself secretly while kissing her.
“I love you too,” and without waiting for a reply, he walked off to Mrs Weasley, leaving Jamie and Harry on the bench and took his Adrian, who he had given nicknamed Addie into his arms, shushing him as he rocked him to calm down.
Draco crossed his arms together as he smirked, looking up and down at Weasley. He then looked at Potter and it seems that he agreed with Weasley.
His mood lifts up a bit as he watched Longbottom make a fool out of himself as he hopped to the Gryffindor Table, hoping that someone could performed the counter-curse.
Harry pulled his sweater off of him as he broke the kiss, revealing his petite rounded breasts. Harry’s pupil were dilated as he was looking at his breast. He brought his finger to his nipple and pinching it, making his nipple hard.
He doesn’t know why Longbottom would be scared of Theo, he was the most coward person Draco ever knew before Longbottom, Theo was scared of literally everything, he was even scared of Nott Sr.
He almost succeeded, just a few more coaxing but then the twins decided that today is not going to be the day. Draco was looking from Jamie to the house and back to Jamie.
Mother walked out of the manor with Draco in her hand and Apparate both of them to King Cross. When they arrived, Father was talking to the Crabbe's and Goyle's, Cassie looks at their children with disdain and boredom.
“Maybe that’s why father hated him.”, he thought to himself as he looked out of the window. His hand was holding his old family photo mother gave him two years ago right after his birthday. His eyes contemplating on the photo, he looked over the detail of his parents, both of them were so happy in this, even he was a happy little baby.
Draco was going nuts, he can’t think straight if Harry kept on doing that to him, he’d been obsessed with his hole since the first time they tried rimming.
Comment down below on what do you for this chapter and lets just say that I almost done with First Year but it will took be long time to post it.
He can see that Weasley was in great pain with the injury and safe to say, he was having a good laugh out of it.
“Cassiopeia Malfoy is not like her father, she was kind to me,” spoke Granger, speaking up on behalf of his sister, although no one says anything about him, as long as people know Cassie as are not like Lucius Malfoy, he was fine because no one can talk bad about her as long as he live.
Draco took his hand willingly and sat on his lap. He could feel Harry’s hard on through the jeans he worn.
“I’m not trying to be rude or anything but can I have your number?” said the stranger again. In his heart, Draco thinks that this stranger couldn’t take a memo because he have no interest on having a conversation with a total stranger.
“Hurm- should mama buy it for you? I don’t think so - you have been a naughty boy this evening,” said Draco as he teased his son playfully. “I think I better put it back,” hand dramatically putting the fruit down but then he stopped when his son screamed very loudly.
They were speaking softly to their twins when suddenly, they heard a soft knocked on the door, Harry stand up and give Scorpius to Draco and went for the door, there walked in an elegant women he looked up to since he was a child, she was holding Jamie’s hand as they walked inside the chilly room together.
He didn’t wait for him to come down from the high when he pushed Harry off of him, slipping Harry’s big cock out of his small hole that had been stretched. Harry didn’t even get to come yet.
He looked up and addressed his cousin, “Please take good care of him, Cissy. I will forever be thankful for it. Cherish him with love.” Narcissa nodded, she put the photograph in her pockets and came hugging her cousin with her free arm and after a few long seconds, she let go of him.
Since the family has straight blonde hair, Father always reminds him to charm his hair straight and full blonde when he’s outside of the manor since he has one streak of black hair and inherited a wavy hair from Sirius. He too will disillusion his eyes to make it the same colour, which is cold and dull grey like Father. Father’s eye colors are like a cloud on a stormy day, emotionless while his were grey, a sterling grey. Shines brightly like a moon in the night sky like her mom, Amelia's.
He knows that he was acting like a child not getting their favourite candy from the store. He was muttering under his breath, not satisfied with Harry’s action.
Jamie quickly latched his mouth to his pink nipple, sucking out the milk out of him, Draco let out a soft sighed and close his eyes. He felt a soft kiss on his forehead and he then felt Harry lean his body to give a kiss on his son.
“It’s okay, dragon. It will get better,” reassured Harry into his ear as he bit his earlobe. He buried his face into the crook of Harry’s neck, a drop of tears dropped down from his eyes, “How would you know, you didn’t hear what he said.”
“Good? No, you looked fucking fantastic, amazing and everything, whenever you walk, all of the men’s eyes are looking at your smooth thighs, but they can’t have you because you are mine,” said Harry possessively.
When they walked in Potion room, Severus was embarrassing Potter with questions, Potter looked at his Weasel friend hoping that he knows the answer but his friend shrugged his shoulders, Potter obviously doesn’t know the answer but the bushy-haired girl eagerly raise her hand but was ignored by Severus. Draco walked quietly and took a seat at the back of the class so no one realized that they were late but Severus did notice.
“I was just joking, Draco. You don’t have to get overly protective brother mode on!”, joked Blaise as he raised his hand in surrender. “That’s what I thought.”, said Draco as he rolls his eyes.
‘Well, I was dragged into this’, said Blaise as he raised both of his hands in surrender. That traitor, he thought to himself.
Finally, the old man shut up but give him a nasty look and he held their eye contact until Filch broke it off. Out of the corner of his eyes, the Gryffindor was amazed by his insults, even the corner of Potter’s mouth lift a little.
He reached for his wand on the nightstand, cast a one-way silencing spell around the twins. The silence is torturing that he decided to take a good and relaxing bath where he could clear his mind.
Draco took his hand and held it into a fist, Dobby followed his instructions slowly and when their fist collided, Draco let out a soft puff followed by Dobby's own.
“Both of you looks good as a couple, no judging here but I can see that you are dating with the way both of your eyes look at each other when one thought you guys aren’t looking,” she explained and without waiting for Iris to reply, she continues while eyes persistently measures the length of her hair that needs to be cut.
He crouches back down again to let Draco’s legs touch the ground as they finally get to the car, Harry opens the door for him - like a true gentleman that he is, and closes it with a sound of a bang when Draco has seated.
Jamie was grumbling and mumbling about something, he couldn’t hear his word clearly because he was still covering his face against his father’s chest.
When the month of February came quicker than he realised, he felt giddy because he had plan a trick  on Potter on Valentine’s Day. He send an anonymous letter to Professor Flitwick, stated that in the letter he should be reading it out loud when Gryffindor had Potion with Slytherin.
Before she can continue, Iris cuts her off with a shocked look on her face, “Me and Malfoy? We wouldn’t be in a relationship! I mean it doesn’t mean when one spends too much time with each other and when one of them is obviously not straight, it doesn't mean they are in a relationship. Malfoy is not even gay.”
Harry gave his seat to mother and instead he stood near the hospital bed, once Jamie saw Draco laying on the bed, half dead- no he was just exaggerating. Jamie ran to him and Harry helped him hop on the bed, Draco introduced his twin brothers to Jamie.
When he started searching the bottom drawer, something caught his eyes, he found an old newspaper from 1981.  The headline stated “Sirius Black, traitor to the Potters”, meanwhile Cassie found the album that they have been searching for.
He brought the hat down to his face, he then faced up, looked around the Great Hall and saw that all of the students and professor's eyes were fixed on him with interest in their eyes because they probably heard the halfway shouts from the hat before he cut the hat decision off.
Without him thinking twice, he declared that he wanted Fang the dog as he looked at Fang’s long teeth, he doesn’t even know if the dog is a coward or not but best hope with a long teeth like that, the dog would do something when in danger.
“Yes and papa, don’t forget about him,” chuckled Draco lightly while looking at his husband who was looking at them with adoration.
“Remember to write to us, and tell us you got sorted into,” she bent down to kiss his head and hugged him and she turned around doing the same to Cassie.
His hole was so perfect around his fingers, it was like he knows who he was owned to- who he belonged to.
Draco chose the bed that was attached to the wall and sat down, took out his trunk from his pocket and unshrink it. The trunk grew to its original size, he threw open the lid and he screamed, both Blaise and Theo were shocked that they jumped out of their cozy bed.
He crawled to the other side of the bed, he got on his hands and knees, displaying his cute butt in the air.
“You are going to be so fucking gorgeous with my kids, Draco. Not that you are not, you are always fucking beautiful. Fuck- I hope there’s going be a little one inside of you someday.”, whispered Harry softly into his ears.
he thought as he scrolled down the notifications. Five notifications from his Mail. Ten plus notifications from Snapchat. Twenty from Twitter, probably Pansy again.
She looks at her best friend since first year weirdly, arching an eyebrow silently questioning her. “You always study together,” was all she said, eyes trailing down on the word of the book she just opened.
When he thinks that he has stretched Draco enough for him to take his huge cock, he flipped him over as he sat himself up, clanking his belt open and pushed his jeans off. Draco moved his body to his cock and took a hold from the base, slowly sinking down onto his cock.
“Don’t, we put both of these in my room and then we come down for the party,” he stood up and walked towards his room, he then put the newspaper and the moving photo on his study desk.
‘ Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,’ said Madam Hooch. ‘Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two-’
Draco was gobsmacked because did he just hear Harry correctly? Did Harry just ask him on the date? And did Harry just use his given name? It sounds sweet like honey coming from Harry’s mouth.
Before they walked back to their respective common room , Draco turned to Potter and his friend, Granger while Longbottom was still looking frightened, waiting for his Gryffindor friends to walk to Gryffindor Tower together.
“Come love - show me how much I affect you,” growled Harry into his ears and he finally came, cum shooting out of him and to Harry’s shirt that he didn’t take it off.
String of saliva connected to Draco’s hole as he inspected his handiwork. Draco’s hole was reddish red from the intense sucking. His hole was clenching at nothing.
Leaning down, he connected his lips to Harry’s, even when they were out of breath, their lips never stray away from each other. With his position, laying on top of Harry like this, someone might see his knickers but as he said - no one was around and he doesn’t care.
“Come Jamie, let’s get you to bed. My baby boy are sleepy. You want me to carry you to your room?, asked Draco as he took pity on his tired son, his son nodded his head in agreement.
Murmurs broke around the hall as more of the Gryffindors students walks in, Draco was peaking his head up, hoping to see the black haired Chosen One wearing one of the houses colour.
He bid them goodbye and hoped that they had a great night as they were walking out of the restaurant. The flirtatious brother gave him a playful wink and Draco acted as if he didn’t see anything because he wants his brother, not him.
They reach their forest territory, before they start on their morning run, Draco warns Reggie to not run far off the Potter’s territory. He always reminds his son so that bad things don’t happen to his pride and joy.
Working a ‘quarter time job’ is the only way for him to pursue his dream and not studying law with mother convincing his father. Mother holds a big power over the family that even the head of the house doesn't have the say for the last word. Once mother said the last word to end the argument, no one could convince her otherwise.
(some Easter egg is that both Lucius and Narcissa knows who's the killer is and when Draco found out about it.. all hell breaks loose)
‘That’s the girls lavatory’, shrieked Pansy into their ears. Draco was now on high alert because the troll was in the room, the room where Cassie was in and to make the matter worst, Potter and Weasley locked the troll inside the room.
“Mother wants you to keep it, she said that it's the only thing that your dad gave to Mother the night he handed you to her”
Mother did send letters to him and Cassiopeia on the first day at breakfast telling them she was proud of the house they were sorted into and she missed them deeply and the manor is getting quiet since only Father, Mother and a bunch of house-elves live there. Father too did send a letter telling him to make him proud and safe to say, he burned the letter with a quick ‘Incendio’ . A spell he learned in Charms book.
Although Mother said no, he still wouldn’t give up, “But Mother, please, I would be out of the manor in a month, please Mother, please,” he begged his Mother, although he knows that Malfoy doesn't beg.
He shakes his head, not wanting to stop reading and memorising, his hands reaching out for his pen to write when he is stopped by Harry. Pulling the blue pen and chucking it away, he suddenly stood up and forcefully pried his book from his hand.
He knows that any day now his babies are going to welcome themselves into the world when he first realized his early sign at labour. Looking at himself in the mirror, he notices his baby's head slowly drops to his pelvis as the day goes by. He felt uncomfortable most of the night that he usually will wake up in the middle of the night because of pain and heaviness, his increased peeing is not helping too.
The interior of the house could be described as cozy, inviting and warm. It brings a new light to The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. There could be seen photographs of three smiling residents hanging on the wall and a huge photo frame of four men and two women, each one of the women cradling their baby to their chest.
“You know what Weasley, I think I’m going to borrow your book, this book”, said Draco as he hold the book up for Weasley’s eyes to see.
Everyone near Longbottom was laughing at him except Granger as she performed the counter-curse on him and took his hand, leading him over to sit next to Potter and Weasley.
“That’s what you get for scaring me in Knockturn Alley,” bragged Cassie but she held out her hands and took some books from his hands. They both walked to the counter with Pansy and Blaise trailing behind them.
“Want to see Mama?” he asked, as Jamie rubbed his red rimmed eyes with his chubby hands, he nodded his head. “Let’s go then,” kissing his son’s head.
“Or better, I can just go to Lyra’s account and stalk her following,” he spoke smartly and did just that.
Everybody in the family knows not to take Sirius’s words seriously because there’s never been a day where he was serious despite his name sounding like the word ‘serious’.
He smashed their lips together as Harry pulled him closer to his chest, their length are touching, their body are touching each other. Harry moved his hand to his waist and down to his arse, squeezed it violently that Draco moaned into the kiss.
“You never know because you never ask about it, you just know that we went to the same school,” said Draco, talking with his mouth full, hand involuntarily stroking Harry’s messy black hair as he was chewing his food.
He was sucking on in his hole, Harry’s face was literally buried into his arse that his glasses went askew.
Iris decides to speak up, “Lucius, just let your daughter say whatever she wants, you have no authority over her anymore.”
Finally- he’d finally done it, he has master his disillusionment charm. He was frustrated at himself at first because he tried for almost a year, no wizards should wait a year to casts a practical spell.
“Okay - okay. No, because why would I be dating anyone when I’m with you right now? Besides, I’m in too deep with someone already.”
When they finally arrived, Harry put him down and hand scrambled into the basket, finding a blanket that he had prepared and laid the blanket on the grass.
“And about your old man. You have proof enough by aced the past exams you sat. What more proof do you want? Because I can still think a lot and if he talks shit about you. I’m going to the manor myself bringing Sirius to piss him off.”
He was contemplating whether to talk to Jamie this instant so he couldn’t avoid him but he doesn’t want the others to know that he has a problem with Jamie - a misunderstanding. He looked up into the emerald eyes when he felt an arm wrapped around his shoulders, Harry kissing him on the temple.
They were having a conversation while they are working on brewing the potion. Since the potion doesn’t last longer than five minutes, they were easier to brew than the actually love potion because they have to wait for nine days if brewing the proper love potion.
Pansy have been dragging him and Blaise to hang out with the Gryffindor Trio although he didn’t want to because it felt odd at first but the longer they hanged out together, it felt right.
He turned his body towards Harry, slipping an arm under Harry’s arm, hugging him and burying his face into Harry’s sturdy chest. Harry slips one of his arms under Draco’s head, substituting it as a pillow.
“Besides we can’t sneak out out of curfew but we can have a detention in a forest? What type of dungshit is this?”, said Draco as he was spitting out facts. “The school system are rigged.”
They then walked to their table to enjoy their breakfast, both of them are wearing a Slytherin colour cloak. It suits them well actually if he must admit.
She looks at him and her eyes melts. She spoke softly to the father of the child, “Sirius, he looks just like you. I believe he will break a lot of young boys and girls hearts. I hope that our little Harry and Draco will become great friends.”
They laid on bed, snuggling close to each other until their tired eyes closed with a fond smile on both of their face.
‘Where you want to go Cass?’, asked Draco as he was just done with the food. Draco looked at Theo and his eyes was angry with fury because of what have Cassie said to me, which he might add was true. Blaise was avoiding everyone eyes as he looked down at his plate and eat in silent.
“Does Father know who the Death Eaters were because he clearly was one before the end of the Wizarding War,” he spatted. How dare father, still in rank of the Dark Side even after his sister died by the hand of his side.
At that moment, a stooping man known as Mr Borgin appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face with his wrinkly hand. Although, Draco was examine the objects on the shelves right now, he kept one ear open, listening to their conversation while Cassie was somewhere in the corner, looking at glass eye she found fascinating.
“I did want to take your hand, in the train. I just don’t want to insult Ron because he was my first friend”, said Harry a few moment later.
They drive back to their home. While Draco accidentally fell asleep in the car ride back home, Harry snapped a picture of him, leaning against the window, face tranquil with no trouble of the world.
Tracing his index finger where his face once stood, before it got burned off. Although he was burned off the tapestry, It still shows the link to whom he got married to and under them is their son.
When they arrived in front of the classroom’s door, Draco tried to shook Harry’s hand off but Harry just tightened his grip and pulling him inside and inside they went.
I will try to be more active but I can't promise although my country will start school on 20th of January so I have a lot of free time.
They quickly walked out of the room with style because Malfoy don’t jog around. The Malfoy Manor was so huge that it took them ten minutes to arrive in front of father’s study room.
He had learned his lesson, he should not trust Peeves, how dare that stupid poltergeist said that there were no one at the Astronomy Tower and went to call McGonagall on him; and he shouldn’t sneaked out on that day, and when he get caught, he tried save his own arse by switching the blame on Potter saying that he saw Potter sneaking out to the Astronomy Tower, with McGonagall dragging him by the ears until they reached the tower, no on was on sight and she gave him detention after that.
“It was not our fault that Granger girl is better than us, you should be proud we did great on the exam that we could advance to our second year, but instead you-,” before he could finished his sentence, father slapped him hard on his left cheek. Beside him, Cassie clamped her hand around her mouth.
Potter stepped forward and walked beside him, as they were leaving the other group, he turned his back and waves at Longbottom mischievously.
“Are you okay, love?” voicing his concern. Draco just nodded his head, replying to his comment, he took a few breaths and started to lift himself up and down on his cock.
“Ooh not very friendly”, he smirked as his eyes landed on Weasley’s schoolbag and had the brilliant idea to mess with his schoolbag, he did told Madam Pomfrey he wants to borrow some of Weasley’s books.
He finally understood why she was silent when an object hit his shoulder really hard, pushed him out of the way. He looked over his shoulder to confirm it and it was true, it was father, his eyes locked with Mr Weasley instead.
Mother should pay him well today because he doesn't know why today has to be the day where customers would suddenly love to have their dinner here. They could have another day to come, oh but no they have to choose the day he decided to work.
“I beg your pardon, sir?” now Draco are getting angry because this bitch doesn’t understand English. Before he gets to open his mouth to speak again, arms slides around his waist, hugging him from the back and their chin rests on his shoulder.
“What would your parents think when they find out that their only child is a slut for a 35 years old man who is also their son’s professor, huh?” said Harry in his rough voice. “That get to fuck their son everyday, the one who took their son’s virginity, what would they think?” Said Harry as he snapped his hips further into Draco. The air of sex flowing around of his personal quarter.
“Come off it James, I’m the most good-looking in our friend group, it is still a wonder why Lily right here would want to marry you,” snide a friendly remark.
They paused and looked into each other’s eyes. Most specifically, he was looking into Harry’s emerald green eyes, his eyes can’t seem to tear it apart from it.
Before the boy could reply, Madam Malkin came out and told them that their robes were done, so Cassie tried again asking his name but luck is not on her side because their Mother called them after they had finished paying for the school robes since Mother handed them money before going to Diagon Alley.
“Daddy, move please Daddy,” begged Draco when he realised that he hadn't started thrusting into this body.
Her cheeks went red when she looked around and saw that everybody was looking their way. “Uhm - now I’m embarrassed,” she looked down, walking away like a bolt of lightning from the attention with Iris in tow, without them realising that they were holding hands.
Draco was embarrassed because this should not be the image of a respected pureblood he learned from him years ago, his eyes went to Pansy and Blaise - he kinda forgot that they were still here, witnessing Lucius Malfoy and Arthur Weasley on the dirty floor.
She was glaring at Theo as if she was wishing that her glare could burn a hole on him but Theo only listen half-hearted as he waved his hand on her, telling her to shut up because they were more interest in the Gryffindor’s conversation.
“So, you have something to say to us,” it was not a question, it’s a statement. Celestial was too nervous; she was tapping her fingers onto her thigh, and when Iris saw this, she took a hold of her other hand too.
Father ordered him to follow him to the dark alley of the Knockturn Alley with Cassie beside her while Mother helped them buy their new school robes and a few new clothes.
“Good. Remember to touch nothing, if I saw your hands on any of the object, you’ll know what’s going to happen once we reach home.”, advised father again for the second time, they nodded their head in silence.
He decided to change his mind once he reached their nursery, he’s going to lay on his bed while feeding them his breast milk. It was difficult to move with two babies in his arms, rocking them in his arms each.
“PAPA! GOO!”, shrieked Jamie, bouncing on the car seat, they looked at each other and chuckled at their son’s antics. “Alright, Jamie- let’s go,” said Harry as he pulled the handbrake down and reversing the car out of their driveway and drive off to their destination.
Pansy was already there waiting for him when he stepped inside the common room wearing HIS clothes he might add.
He was glaring at Cassie helping Longbottom, seriously that boy was pathetic, really pathetic. When she was done helping him, Longbottom walked out of the stand to go back inside the castle leaving only Cassie and him. Granger and Weasley was nowhere to be seen now, same goes to Crabbe and Goyle, maybe Cassie had chased them away.
“Of course you have, this body have been on top of you every night since you were eighteen if you still haven’t notice,” smirked Harry and Draco had to roll his eyes at his husband’s arrogant attitude.
He don’t even realised the boy-who lived was in the bookstore too, he looked at him and their eyes met for a few second before the flash of the camera blinding his emerald eyes.
Mother helped him slicking his hair before they stepped out of the manor, both mother and Cassie wore a matching colour dresses because it was in the middle of August, he would wear a dress too if given the chance.
Harry swiped up to unlock his phone and replied to the message. When he was done, he put the phone back in his pocket.
“Here we goes, fuck me after this if we survive,” she request and the only answer Iris could give her is a slight nod, she don’t even know if Celestial noticed because all her focus were on the door that led to the study room, where her parents are waiting for her.
“Relax, Longbottom. Nothing are going to attack us, I meant me because by the look of your body, the creature inside of the forest will think that you are a delicious meat”, teased Draco.
Draco was having a doubt, he wanted to but he thinks that it was too soon. He wants to enjoy his first year with peace and no stress and he knows that playing in a Quidditch team has to come with a lot of stress. He loves playing Quidditch for fun but it was always with Cassie so it doesn’t feel right if he is going to play without her.
He took one of the hair product that caught his eyes and scanned through the ingredients that was use to create the shampoo. It took him longer than he expected when suddenly he sensed someone was standing close, he almost wanted to greet him but stop himself when he realised it was not his husband.
The door to their private quarter opened and walked in a male healer, coming in to check on Draco, he bent his body down, told Draco to split his legs apart and checked on his private part, then told them that Draco was indeed in the moment of giving birth.
The students were all shocked that the daughter of Malfoy decides to help Longbottom who is a cowardly Gryffindor to the hospital wing and that she seems concerned about him.
Pansy rests her phone on the windowsill, position the phone perfectly against the window glass the way she wanted. When she was ready, she stand in the frame and set the timer and pressed the button to start.
Harry came moments after he had come, his cum shooting inside of him as he pressed his cock to Draco’s prostate.
Severus was nowhere in the staff table as he was waiting for each and every new welcomers to get sorted. He was not shocked when another Weasley (the girl Weasley) was sorted into Gryffindor.
‘I don’t care and anyways I got a lot of attention on that app especially using Draco and sometimes you’, said Pansy as she swipe up and down on her phone screen.
