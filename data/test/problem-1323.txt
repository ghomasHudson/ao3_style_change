They’ve had the table reserved for them, since it’s a bachelor party, and it’s been a wonder being able to go up and dance without worrying whether there’ll be a seat waiting for them when they get back. Seamus and Dean have been warned twice already about inappropriate behaviour on the dancefloor and security makes it clear to Draco that a third time will mean the lot of them getting chucked out. So now they’re sitting back down, a seventh round of shots thrown back, listening to Neville talk about how he’s thinking of proposing to Luna soon.
"I just answered that." He says tiredly. "Minister, is that all you'll need from me?"
“Oh, um, around Christmas. The week before?”
Or maybe he does.
And he doesn’t know how- he’s usually rubbish at comforting anybody- but Harry looks at him gratefully, a ridiculously soft expression on his face.
“Oh, come here then,” and he grabs Harry’s waist before rucking up the fabric, nudging Harry’s arms up and almost pulling his glasses off as he takes the offending robes and throws them haphazardly towards the fire.
But now the silence has dragged on too long and both of them tense, unsure what to do or how to act or what to say.
Draco has a crush on Potter.
“Spent most of the time in my room.” Draco admits. “Snape had begun teaching me
Draco barely gives the words a chance to sink in before he opens his father’s letter with shaking hands and frantically reads the words there.
Last night doesn’t let it slip that you’re gay, he tells himself. And it definitely doesn’t prove anything about your feelings for Harry. To everybody else you looked just as enthusiastic as him, and everyone knows Harry’s straight and most definitely
And Draco sighs. He knows what’s going to come next. Usually it’s when he’s taking off his clothes and forgets to hide the Dark Mark that people figure out exactly who he is and run, but tonight nothing seems to be going his way. “Yeah.”
Harry snorts derisively. “Please. Army commander? I’ve never led an army in my life. Not actually led them, with orders and everything.”
“Oh, really? I’ve noticed a steep decline in insults between us this year.”
It’s then that Blaise seems to realize what Draco had moments ago, and his eyes fall on Harry and concern flits across his expression when he looks at Draco.
He really just needs his best friends right now.
Harry grins. “Being Kingsley’s assistant is a busy task.”
Draco collapses against the desk and doesn't move for several minutes, staring blankly ahead while he cautiously feels his swollen lips with his fingers. His entire body feels numb and he can only sit in his frozen state, unable to process the last hour.
“I think he’s hurt,” she offers as they begin to walk out of the library together. By silent agreement they begin to head to the Gryffindor Tower. “And he’s bad at talking about feelings at the best of times, so when it’s something like this- well. He shuts down a bit.”
He grimaces. Christmas could be a bit strained this year.
“We- I- no. What in Merlin’s name did we just
“It sounds nice.” Is his easy reply, watching closely as Draco’s face lights up a bit. “I’d like to.”
Harry's face is burning. "I just didn't want to talk to him was all." He says, and he wishes it was the truth. Merlin, how he wishes it. He glances over at Draco again to see him talking to Ron and Hermione- probably because for once today Harry isn't at their sides- and the clawing in his stomach pierces him deeper. "Our friendship," his mouth twists on the word and he wonders what his face must look like right now because he's never been very good at hiding his emotions, "didn't end well."
(And isn’t that a happy, if unexpected bonus of them all becoming friends, Harry thinks. Hermione finally has someone she can talk to about the subjects she’s interested in who can keep up with her. It had been a slightly alarming realization for Harry when it became clear that Draco could give Hermione a run for her money.)
But then he’s not thinking about anything else at all, except the suction and that point inside of himself that feels like it’s exploded. His entire body shudders and his cock pulses as he comes in Draco’s mouth in thick shoots.
Because Malfoy hadn’t brought out his wand, hadn’t even moved his lips to mutter a spell, which either meant he had progressed to nonverbal spellcasting of Shield charms or-
. Draco is on edge around him, but he is also more excited than around anybody else. His other friends make Draco happy but Harry… Harry makes Draco feel alive.
Wordlessly Harry casts a quick cleaning charm and then can’t do anything but watch Draco and try and think through what it is they’ve just done.
Nott is looking thoroughly smug, his Viktor Krum costume’s Quidditch robes crumpled, as is the girl who settles herself beside him. Pansy’s lipstick is already smudged.
Narcissa’s sharp eyes watch him all the while, even as she pours herself a cup of tea and blows on it gently. Draco doesn’t get offered, but then again, Harry thinks while glancing at Draco’s flushed cheeks, it doesn’t seem like he wants any.
“Yet.”
But there’s still a week until then, and one more Friday night before leaving next Saturday. Harry doesn’t have to worry about it quite yet and as they all start speaking in groups of twos or threes he lets himself be drawn into conversation as well.
She says it so plainly and so straightforwardly that Harry feels sick.
“You ready for this?” Ron says across Draco. “After today that’s it. You’re stuck together. Ginny doesn’t do anything halfway.”
They keep drinking and it is well past midnight now but Harry doesn’t care. They’re all leaving in a week for Christmas hols and he’s realizing how much he’s going to miss everyone. Before it was just Ron, Hermione and Ginny that he had to leave, and being at the Burrow with them solved that. But now there’s everyone in this room and he’s sad he won’t be seeing them for their usual Friday night gatherings.
Harry feels the old and familiar ache that comes from thinking about his parents. “No.”
“Oh. Right.”
Ron gives a startled laugh. “Oh, that is good.”
So he clears his throat and tries to make his expression blank. “I’m fine. It’s just your parents… what they did- it’s unbelievable, you know? Fighting- fighting Voldemort, way back then at the height of his power. And Sirius going against his family like that… It was really brave of them all.”
Somehow Draco doesn’t feel as if he’s won the argument.
“Did something happen?”
He could do nothing but listen to her rant now and hope it would be over quickly. She is right that he had been hoping his friends would just leave the subject alone after Hogwarts and she is also right in telling him it was a stupid hope. His friends are nothing if not meddlesome.
the glasses before leading Harry to the dancefloor.
“Malfoy, he-”
She blows out a big breath. “How long now until he’s back?”
Harry’s stomach flutters. “You did?”
“You’ve already used that one,” Harry reminds Ron, making his best friend frown.
They make their way around the school and then wander down to the Quidditch pitch before they meander towards the edge of the lake and back up to the school to make it to the courtyard. Draco asks Harry for the chocolate chip muffin he’s brought and that reminds Harry he has one as well.
“Oh yeah? What was all that this afternoon then?”
“Well… do you know how to cast a
Seconds tick by and Blaise snorts. “Yeah, that’s not really disproving our theory given the fact that the rest of us managed to do that with everyone in the same room.”
“Well I didn’t want us to freeze.”
“How do you do that, by the way?”
“Hey.” Harry seems endearingly awkward and happy to see him. “I’m glad you asked to meet. How,” he swallows. “How are you?”
“No.” He agrees easily. “Perhaps-”
Blaise flashes him two fingers. “Back at you Potter. Look, all of us just want you two to be happy, okay? Me included. Talk to him, because I promise he’s just as miserable as you are.”
With the son of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy already there, being the first Hogwarts student and wizard his age that the famous Harry Potter ever meets.
“Pansy-” Zabini starts to say, but Pansy is holding a red cup full of punch and her face is flushed. Her eyes are bright and she is obviously not listening to him.
“Ten minutes ‘till we go.” Hermione provides and looks over at Harry. “You’re absolutely sure-”
“Sorry Harry.” Ron mutters. “Soon as we walked in last night we knew it was stupid.”
Blaise looks him over worriedly before dropping his hands and taking a step back. “You were losing it out there.”
Draco sighs again. “I don’t know what I expected.” More silence ticks away with minutes gone by. He sounds sad when he speaks again. “Do you think we grow into our names then? Yours is certainly apt.”
Their lips touch one last time before Harry pulls away slightly. “I didn’t want you to regret it or for me to jump into it without thinking. But I knew last night and I’ve known since Hogwarts how I feel. I will always want to be with you.” His smile is scared and the words that follow are all the braver because of it. “If you’ll still have me I think we should spend the rest of our lives together.”
The Slytherin has already released several new potions that has helped Healers across the world, and many of them are helpful with uncontrollable magic. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to ask him to come in and consult on the case. Harry can always get Ron to pose the question.
“Maybe.” Harry manages to smile weakly through his surprise at the sudden turn in conversation. He remembers the Headmistress pulling them both into her office, sitting them down with biscuits and making her job offers. “To be honest I haven’t thought of that in years.”
“Thank you, Theo.” Pansy says with dramatic exasperation.
A forced and awkward smile is her answer. “He was really nice about it. As good as you lot have been. Hagrid’s a decent sort.”
“No.” Harry is emphatic. “You know it’s not. I’m just… thinking out loud. I’m really happy you’re here.”
Harry isn’t sure what the proper response to any of that is. “I’m sorry?”
“Grab his arse, Harry!” Neville encourages and Harry almost breaks the kiss for that, just to see the flaming shade of scarlet Neville’s face must have turned at his outburst.
He looks pathetic and for a second Harry feels sorry for him.
So of course, Ginny and Blaise have to ruin it.
Does Draco feel the same? Is Harry right in hoping that the look in those grey eyes is special for him?
Or, in other words, practically ignore one another completely without making the others suspicious.
Seconds pass and Slughorn keeps speaking. Draco nudges the notes towards Potter again and after a brief moment of hesitation the Gryffindor actually drags them over to start copying them.
Potter grins and Draco blinks, still surprised at the easy way Potter’s expression relaxes around him these days. He’s used to glares and smirks, not smiles and laughter. This is off-putting.
Harry kisses down Draco’s neck, debating whether or not he should leave a mark before deciding fuck it, Draco can heal it if he cares that much about it in the morning.
Harry clenches his fists. “If you’re all going to talk about me like I’m not here, I might as well get lost.” He moves to brush past Blaise but Draco’s hand catching his arm stops him.
“Yeah.” Harry says quietly, able to understand her better than she knows. “If you want that with him Gin, if you really like him, then go for it. Honestly. Don’t let anything stop you, especially not something as simple as which House you both belong in. Because I think the two of you could be amazing.”
“Another Christmas present?” Harry teases, nerves in his stomach and Draco’s lips twitch up into an unplanned smile.
Draco doubts it and he knows he won’t say anything even as he nods. “Alright. Thank you.”
"You- what? But you were going to tell people today-"
Harry crosses his arms and takes in his dishevelled appearance, the tired look on his face and in his eyes. He sees his own misery reflected back to him and maybe that’s why he sighs and nods.
Ron looks like he’s about to pass out from exhaustion but he nods and stands in his chair before gently helping a giggly Hermione up and out of hers as well.
“So you um. You know about us then?” Harry says.
“Did you really think it would be?” Harry gasps out eventually, putting his glasses back on after wiping away the few tears that had come from laughing too hard.
"Actually Rory, piss off would you?"
“I-” Draco is caught up on Ron’s comment of the others. Who does he mean? Is Harry there with them? “Wherever you-”
“No need to ask what you’ll be doing Potter,” Blaise says while their group is discussing their futures. “Evil wizards to save us from and all that.”
It does not stop his heart from hammering away in his chest.
“Um, Harry’s parents are buried there. We’re going to the graveyard.” He doesn’t want to say anything else and looks anxiously at Snape for distraction only to find him looking back at Draco, face stricken.
“Sometimes Crabbe and Goyle were there with their parents. Or Theo. But Crabbe was completely convinced by everything our parents said and none of the rest of us could admit that we weren’t. It was hard. There wasn’t really anybody to talk to that wasn’t involved in some way.”
“Draco!” A flash goes off in his face and he starts, jumping at the billowing smoke of the camera that’s appeared.
Harry falters. “What?”
“How invested are you in this friendship thing?” Draco murmurs, eyes not moving from Harry’s lips. He feels hungry in a way that is becoming very familiar. “Because I think what I have in mind will effectively ruin it.”
He bites his tongue sharply, blinking from the pain but also feeling a bit more grounded from it. “It’s just… you haven’t really asked me a question.”
Harry crosses his arms. “Ron will be needing it more than I do. And I wasn’t nearly as bad as him last night so he can shut his mouth in that department.”
Harry laughs so much that he shakes, and his laughter only grows when Draco joins in. Happy giggles that drift through the air like leaves in a wind, up out of the open roof to find its way among the stars and settle there to rest forever with them.
Draco has never been to the Godric’s Hallow Graveyard. He hasn’t been to the village much, to be honest. He thinks that one of his parents’ old friends had lived here years ago, and he vaguely remembers visiting when he’d been young, but this town had never been a major place for traditional Pureblood families to settle down. Godric’s Hollow is small and inhabited by both Muggles and wizards, which had served to keep old-fashioned witches and wizards far away.
“Good. Now don’t ask anymore stupid questions.” He had taken a deep breath suddenly seemed shifty. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter.”
Blaise looks away from where he’s been watching the Gryffindor table. When Draco follows the gaze he sees Potter deep in conversation with the Weaselette and his stomach sours.
“But…” and now Draco is entirely confused. He’s beginning to feel as if he’s missing something important and a terrible feeling grips him. “If you knew and you’re alright with it, then what was- why would you send me that letter while I was at Hogwarts?”
“Yeah.” She shakes her head before their eyes meet again. “You and Draco make it look so easy, you know. I don’t know how this stuff doesn’t seem to weigh on you two. And if you two can make it work- well, the rest of us have to have a chance, don’t we?”
He’s just glanced at a pretty girl at the other end of the bar when he feels it.
“I don’t know.” Draco swallows thickly.
He hesitates. “You’ll be okay?”
“Draco.” Harry says. “Hi.”
He doesn’t last a minute before his climax builds, quick and furiously strong, crashing through him. Harry’s fingers are rolling his balls and he must feel as they tighten, as Draco’s cock hardens that last bit in his mouth. He should say something, give a warning, but he’s too overcome by the deep pit inside of him, that sharp feeling that builds and climbs and so instead he comes in Harry’s mouth, making the other boy choke and pull away hastily.
to say yes and it’s the thought of Draco that’s making him uncomfortable.
Harry jerks back in surprise at the words and Draco blinks too, shocked at the words. He hadn’t meant to bring Lily and James Potter into this, and he regrets it immediately. “Harry…”
Draco flinches. "What do you want from me?" He whispers. "You want me to hurt you so badly you break, Potter? You're feeling particularly self-destructive today? I’ve already told you it’s over."
Draco’s tea falls to rest in his lap as he looks at Hagrid in unmasked surprise. “He did?”
“Draco.” Harry’s touch is light and soft on the top of his hand which now grips the doorknob. “I don’t want to lose you. But you need to decide what it is you want. Maybe… maybe we just need a break.”
What about after?
Harry smiles a bit. “I just… wanted you to know.”
Mail is still falling onto people’s laps and it’s only the sound of a Howler exploding mid air that makes Draco jump and look over.
She nods but Ron bursts out angrily, “Good. Because we won’t be. You might be able to forget all the things he’s done and look at him without seeing a murderer, but I can’t, alright? I don’t know how you can stand to even sit beside the git.”
“Yes!” He cries, pulling up and waiting a few seconds for Harry to do the same. They are both almost vertical in the air, Draco gripping the small ball strongly, eyes locked on Harry’s. “I did it,” the Slytherin says, eyes wide. “I got it.”
The want is back and this time he isn’t sure whether it’s for the possibility that Draco is telling the truth or just for Draco.
Blaise watches him as he hurries around the table to grab Harry when he stumbles. His breath goes out of him at the other man’s weight- he’s noticed the muscle gain since Hogwarts but it’s another thing to have it pressing up against him- and Harry practically slumps into him, his face tucked into the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco groans quietly and flips through the textbook, looking at the picture of an automobile that he'd seen earlier at lunch. He's tried to read ahead so he'll have at least some idea of what the things Professor Marylton talks about are but he finds himself completely lost.
"Do you reckon he'll be on the train?" Ron asks as Harry finally gets his trunk to fit in the overheard compartment.
She nudges Ron who nods hastily. “Right, yeah, me too. Sorry ‘bout that.”
Harry looks like he’s going to say something but then only shakes his head. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
It's the softest thing they've ever done, this kiss. A simple press, his lips against Draco’s.
“My- you wrote Aunt Petunia?”
She doesn’t look angry or upset but that doesn’t stop the Slytherins from shrinking back, Harry notes. In fact, he somehow finds himself at the front of their small cloister when two seconds ago he’d been in the very back. Pansy is looking suspiciously innocent when he turns to glare at them and he knows she’d pushed him forward.
Draco swallowed, feeling the weight of that old secret return as she watched him. “What happened?” He had asked softly.
should have been named after Narcissus,” Harry retorts without meaning it and then grows serious. “But you’re not a bad person. Maybe you’re stubborn as fuck, and a bit insecure, and the proudest person at this entire school, but you’re still good. You care about people and you don’t want to hurt others. You own up to your mistakes and try to change. That matters, Draco.”
Gryffindors and Slytherins dating and nobody caring.
However he says nothing. This is the first time either of them have left the Manor since their trials. It is quite possibly the last time his Mother will be allowed to leave at all.
“Then you should know. Do you have feelings for him?”
He looks up helplessly.
He doesn't look like a killer, or anything like the other Death Eater's Harry has seen. And when he remembers last year he remembers how obviously torn Malfoy had been.
“Fuck me, Draco,” he answers.
“Oh yes. Quite brilliant of you, Hagrid.”
Draco wakes up the next morning to the sound of the others groaning and slamming their trunks shut. Someone stumbles against the drawn curtains of Draco’s four poster as if they’re drunk and he laughs quietly to himself at the sound of Blaise cursing under his breath.
Not that it’s likely Draco will ever wear the green Muggle sweater, plain grey t-shirt or black trousers, but Harry had thought it was something he could give him that he probably wouldn’t think to get for himself.
A quick use of deodorant and brush of his teeth later he feels almost ready.
He doesn’t care.
Ron breathes out slowly as if silently asking somebody for strength. “Why does everybody keep forgetting we shared dorms in school? Honestly, you and Harry weren’t doing a good job at hiding it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise shoots Harry a quick look and he tries to smile reassuringly. Although he doesn’t really know how necessary that is now that Blaise can clearly see Harry isn’t still hung up on Ginny himself.
Now Harry’s face morphs into one of sympathy. “Yeah. That makes sense, Malfoy.”
She’d been just as surprised by his tone as he was and had closed her mouth without another word before taking in his appearance. Dishevelled robes, hair messed up from that man’s hands raking through it earlier, eyes pleading and the distinctive smell of alcohol surrounding him.
Blaise raises an eyebrow. "From where I'm sitting, nothing looks to be over."
He glares. “Have you all been talking behind our backs?”
“I’ve
“Thank you,” he says quietly and Blaise just nods.
“Right.” Theo says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “So have you?”
Teddy, who is his godson. Teddy, who is living with his grandmother, Andromeda, but is otherwise alone. Harry made a vow, the first day he went to spend with him, that he wouldn't let Teddy grow up like he had. Teddy wouldn't have anyone like the Dursleys to replace his parents, and he wouldn't have an absent godfather.
There’s the sound of footsteps and then Draco’s voice is off in the nearest corner of the room. “What about now?”
“So where did you get it?” Draco asks him after giving it back. “I’ve never seen any like it in the stores. Not even the Weasley shop. Somehow you got it from your dad?”
“Do it, Harry!” Are Ginny and Luna’s cries.
flares to life and he shoots up from under the blankets, wand in his hand and ready to cast any spell that might be necessary.
“A snake.” Harry repeats, half-listening, running his thumb over the mark, taking in the snake coiled through the skull to hang down from it.
Really.
“Lydia said it would just be a fun game!” Leo, the Fifth Uear from Ravenclaw says shrewdly, eyeing them both. “No fighting.”
and hit with an unknown combination of spells before being killed, most often violently. At least that is the pattern the survivors have reported. There could be other cases the Ministry doesn’t know about.
And he probably never will, Draco thinks as he pushes past them to begin hurrying up the staircase. He’s told nobody about his visits with Myrtle in Sixth Year. He’d first gone to cry in a bathroom and after she’d found him there’d been no getting rid of her. Eventually he grew almost fond of her and now…
“We have the worst friends.” Draco offers and Harry nods.
There’s eleven in all, each one small enough to fit on a palm.
“Rude,” Laleh mutters beside her friend but she is smiling too.
Harry looks at him confused. "Wha- Draco?"
“It is a bit.” Draco laughs but he sounds nervous. “I haven’t met him yet but I think over Christmas he and Aunt Andromeda are coming to the Manor.”
“That’ll be a no then!” Ron calls after them.
“But… the letters.” He replies dumbly. “From Eighth Year, when I wrote you both each of you replied and said I would be thrown out if Harry and I were together.”
“Wait.” Draco sits up to stare at him as his blood goes cold. “What?”
Pansy and Harry are both staring at them with wide eyes. Theo, bless him, is just nuzzling into Pansy and murmuring nonsense.
He swallows, looking down at their clasped hands. He’s being unfair, he hopes. His parents have changed, and though his mother has made it no secret she loves the good press that comes from his friendship with Harry, she hasn’t exactly requested anything of him since the beginning of the year. Not back when they’d both thought him getting anywhere close to Harry was still an unrealistic dream and not now that it’s miraculously become their new reality.
"Mr. Potter, we ask that you only respond to the accused crime mentioned previously, the others will be addressed shortly-"
Draco looks at the picture a moment longer, at the way Harry's hands rake through the strange man's hair, and then he pulls open a drawer in his desk and offhandedly throws the paper into it, not wanting to see anymore. He closes the drawer firmly.
Harry cocks his head. “Yeah. After I asked Cho and she told me she was already going with Cedric.”
“What?” Harry looks up at him, horror on his face as he abandons trying to make up the bed again. “No, I- I was just planning on getting him a present-”
“If I was I’d be making myself very late for the train. I’m staying here with you.” Draco tells him with excitement falling from every letter. “For the week. And then spending my last half of hols at home with Mum. McGonagall cleared it with the Ministry and everything.”
Draco’s skin is flushed all over, his blood is rushing through him. He aches, deep in his stomach, but it’s building pleasurably, and he allows it to slowly spread in his veins. Harry seems just as happy to take things leisurely and even when they are both entirely naked, enveloped in their own bubble of warmth, neither moves to do more than touch and be touched in return.
A heavy silence falls on them again, coating the entire room like a blanket and Harry wishes he could take the words back. They both know the only reason Harry studied Potions is because of what they’d had between them; the motivation had been them spending more time together and, later, the promise of kisses and sex as reward for doing well.
“We’re off. You coming?” Blaise comes forward, talking to Draco but eyeing them both.
“If you go slow it should be fine.” Draco answers and Harry nods, head falling as both of them watch him slowly push his hips forwards.
He wants Harry. In any way. And right now he wants Harry to feel what Draco had felt only seconds earlier.
“Yeah well.” Harry shrugs, any anger fading away. “It’s new to me.” He looks over at Draco. “Or at least, newly come to my attention.”
Draco doesn’t kid himself. It’s different because it’s Harry, and for years Draco has been dreaming of a moment like this for more than half of his life.
Draco shifts a bit, making them both groan at the feeling of his bulge brushing Harry’s.
He looks back down, this time at Harry. “I’ll see you soon, Harry?”
Harry looks skeptical. “Is that true? How hard is it to just be nicer to Muggles and learn about them a bit?”
“They don’t have to know.” Harry says pointedly, looking regretfully at the bed one last time before moving to open the door. “Besides it’s mostly your fault.” He says meaningfully. “You distracted me. Muddled up my mind.”
“Well?”
“Oh. Yes, of course.” Draco feels thrown and then clenches his fist because only a second ago he’d been waiting for an acknowledgement, a dismissal he could leave it and now he only feels slightly hurt. Somehow he’d expected Harry to… have more to say.
She looks at him knowingly, even though he doesn’t say it.
Harry tenses beside Draco. “What were the odds on that?”
Draco doesn't flinch, but it's a near thing. He sighs to hide the way his breathing becomes a tell. "Don't be stupid." He says softly, trying to inject pity in his voice. "What, did you think one year of fucking could erase seven years of hatred? You think I could ever want to be with you?" Draco takes in a deep breath and goes all in, hating himself with every bit of his being as he does. "You're damaged goods, Potter. The war changed you, you've lost too much, and honestly I don't know how anybody could love you. Those Muggles you lived with? I think they had it right. I don't think you belong anywhere."
“But?”
“Then I think your team should be more worried about themselves, thanks.” Harry shouts back, making his team all let out low and taunting “
“Am not!” They say unanimously and begin chortling again.
He's not even asking to be rude or to get gossip. He's genuinely curious.
Draco looks back down, letting their eyes stay locked with one another as he and Harry hold each other tightly. He hopes his face says everything he feels, and he hopes he hasn’t made everything worse. It’s hard, Draco knows, to say the right thing to people when it comes to things like this, but if he was going to try for anybody it would be Harry.
Draco’s arms have goosebumps.
Harry’s expression seems broken open to reveal his wavering uncertainty. “That’s why I don’t think a few friends is enough. Pansy, Ron and Hermione knowing… what difference will that make to a situation like today? I would do anything for you.” Harry says fiercely. “Anything. And the hiding isn’t just hurting me or our relationship, it’s hurting you too. And I hate seeing that and all the while knowing we could fix it.”
The response comes later that day.
The blonde raises an eyebrow. “Is this your way of trying to tell me that I’ve ruined your week alone and I should have left?”
them.” Harry replies. “I guess I’m just tired of people looking at me and the people I’m with and being surprised when things change. I have a private life. There’s so much that happens they don’t see- take between you and me for example- but people still feel like they know me because of what they read from a newspaper.” He sighs. “I’m not explaining it right. Forget it. I guess I’m just sick of being looked at and getting judged on things they know nothing about.”
Harry had gone to do the same with Hermione. When he’d walked into the Common Room he’d found her and Ron sitting in front of the fire, distanced a bit from everybody else and deep in discussion. They’d stopped abruptly when they’d seen him coming and Harry had felt a pang because that was something that felt sadly familiar.
Draco sighs and stands up too. “I suppose I’ll come with you to make sure you don’t get distracted and lose track of time.”
Draco turns back to the fire and thinks over everything. But ten minutes later his mind is at ease and whatever had upset him before is gone, blow away like petals in wind.
Silence falls and Draco’s face closes off.
He frowns and gets up resolutely, determined to see Draco before everyone leaves for Hogsmeade at 11. It looks to be about 10 in the morning now, so if Harry skips breakfast he’s sure he can be ready for Hogsmeade and track down Draco before leaving.
When his gaze slides back over he sees Harry staring resolutely at the couple.
"Ah." Draco says and they're quiet for a few more seconds. "My... condolences?"
and goes in search of the one person who might be able to help him.
But even for Harry Draco wasn’t willing to spend the whole night in the Gryffindor dormitory, at least not that night when the dorm was full. There was always the threat of his Wizengamot sentence revision at the end of the year hanging over his head. The verdict from months ago was clear in his mind; he wasn’t supposed to step even a toe out of line. He’d been found Not Guilty of all charges except being a newly initiated Death Eater, and he had a punishment to serve for that. Getting caught coming out of Harry Potter’s room first thing in the morning wasn’t only likely to make its way back to the staff and therefore Kingsley, it was more than certainly something that would get Draco hexed in the hallways.
“But you are.” Draco determines. “Why? What’s the big deal?”
“Love you,” he sighs again before turning over and starting to snore not even a minute later.
.” It seems to slip out of Draco’s mouth without his permission but when it does it’s like floodgates have been opened because from there Draco talks in an endless stream. “The things I want to do to you…”
Pansy shades her eyes dramatically. “My head’s pounding incessantly and I’m dreading going up to breakfast because I’m sure the light’s blinding. Fancy making Hangover Potion together sometime? I’m sure it will come in handy before the end of the year.”
Draco rolls his cup of
“I’m serious, Potter, I knew you were slow but I didn’t think you were outright unthinking.” Draco pauses for a second. “Wait, actually. I did.”
“Nothing of the sort.” Millie smiles reassuringly while Harry nods.
“I’m so glad you said it first,” Harry murmurs. Their foreheads are resting together as they lean into each other, firmly held in one another’s arms. Draco is straining his eyes to look at Harry and he sees that even though Harry has his eyes closed behind his glasses there’s still an uptick to the corners of his mouth. “After this morning- with Romilda- God, it will be a relief not to have to deal with any of that any more.”
"Blimey," Harry hears kids whisper as they pass. He looks over and finds most of them staring at the Thestrals with wide eyes, some hesitantly reaching out to pet them.
“Stalker Potter,” Draco murmurs but he doesn’t say anything else. It’s strange, the way time and growing close to someone can make you look at history in a new way and move past it all. There will always be some anger and pain associated with Sixth Year, but now that Draco has reached a point in his life where he’s happy and free it’s all much more bearable.
“Don’t be daft.” Draco says quickly. “We’re friends. That’s all.”
on it right after reading, because the sight of the paper had made him feel sick.
“Luna told me.” Millie says, smiling at Draco. “Don’t you want to see what he’s dressed as?”
“We are.” Draco says and Harry just watches him. He refuses to admit to the slight sinking feeling in him. “This can’t get out Blaise, can you imagine what that would be like? What people would say about the two of us? And my parents…”
“I told you I don’t want your pity-”
"Oh Draco." Pansy's voice is quiet but cuts across him easily. "Darling, no."
She releases his hand. “Brilliant, Harry, that’s wonderful. Bring Ron and Hermione. Oh, and Ginny will be there! Ask whoever you want to come.”
Anyway.
Draco groans along with about half the others. “Pansy, is that really necessary?”
Something almost like sympathy sweeps across Narcissa’s face at that. “Of course. I can’t imagine- losing a child like that.” She glances at Draco and then clears her throat, eyes landing back on Harry. “They have our condolences.”
As Blaise goes to do just that Draco leans his head back against Ginny's shoulder and takes a sip of his tea. "How long have you suspected?" He asks her quietly.
She frowns at him and clucks her tongue. She’s cut her hair, styling it in a bob that barely skims her shoulders. Draco likes it, the black suits her face better than the colour it had been last year. "Don't be ridiculous and do tell me what you're on about now."
Hagrid blushes. “Ah, well, no need to go that far. Just doing my part, ya ken. Gotta look out for the animals when I can. They got nobody else, ya see.”
"We fought about the Holyhead Harpies last week," Harry tells her weakly, because he does know what she's talking about, and she smiles.
“Has he said anything to you?”
“You don’t have to tell me if it’s a secret.” She sighs dreamily. “But Harry hasn’t visited me in
Harry shrugs. “None that I know of. Mostly it was Muggles. But millions of people died. Marylton’s mentioned it in Muggle Studies before a couple of times.”
“You made me break up with him!” Draco says, too loudly for the small amount of space between them given they’re the only two in the room. “You and Father- because of you both I- and ever since Hogwarts we’ve been-”
One Monday morning in late November after a Hogsmeade weekend most of their group is down at breakfast. The Slytherins are at the Slytherin table, the Gryffindors at theirs, but it doesn’t stop Draco and Harry from catching one another’s eyes in the distance across the hall and rolling their eyes or making faces in a silent discussion only they seem to understand.
He feels ridiculous saying it, but watching Harry’s ears burn is worth it, along with the small pleased smile he has. “Well alright then. If you say so.”
“Not at all. Just desperate for any and all attention I can get.”
“I wouldn’t.” Harry says softly.
“And you do it too.” Ginny says gently. “You hide everything, because you think everyone’s watching you all the time, waiting to see how you’ll react. It’s like you’re the bloody muggle Queen.” She laughs a bit. “You want to protect everyone because you think we can’t handle whatever you’re feeling or going through, but we can. I’m just not the person to make you realize that. I love you Harry, no matter what, but sometimes I feel like we hardly know each other. We never clash, even though I know we disagree on things.”
In short: Draco’s pretty sure he doesn’t.
It is made all the worse because this time Draco knows he deserves each and every one.
Draco looks as if he’s been struck.
“Okay.” She smiles. “Thank you, Draco. He wants to talk to you too, I know it. He’s just…”
Harry feels the need to fill the pause. “Erm, but the house is fine. I’m cleaning it up some more. Sirius tried-”
"Draco." Pansy just looks at him and he tries to stare back but- well anybody going up against Pansy in a staring contest is a right fool. She's impossible to intimidate.
“Don’t.”
Harry nods and Ginny hums thoughtfully beside him.
But there is Draco’s parents to consider.
Ginny looks back. “As soon as he got here and saw me he pulled me aside. Apologized for everything he’d done in the war and- and before that.” She peers at Harry curiously. “Apparently he’s done it with most of us here. You didn’t ask him to?”
“I’ll have one too.”
He’d already been spending huge amounts of time with the Slytherin, but now they’re never really apart. They spend the mornings reading side by side in the Common Rooms- Slytherin or Gryffindor, whichever was emptier. Harry might only have been catching up on class readings he’s neglected all of term, or flicking through the latest Quidditch news, but it still counts as reading, no matter what Draco tried to say. If they weren’t inside relaxing or playing exploding snap or chess then they were outside, walking the grounds of Hogwarts or visiting Hagrid. They’d even gotten into a heated debate with Nearly-Headless Nick the other day.
Rather, when he feels him.
“Oh, hush,” she says softly before leaning forward to kiss him.
“Erm…” Harry looks over at him but Draco can’t do anything but stare back helplessly. “We are, yeah.”
Blaise’s expression clears into a happy smile. “Ah, that’s alright then. Keep talking me up, Mil, I do appreciate it.”
Harry searches his eyes. “How is this going to work if we don’t? I don’t mean telling them all now, it’s too new for that, but they’re our best friends. We can’t hide this from them forever. Anything longer than a few weeks seems impossuble.” He snorts. “Not sure I can even if we try. You know how nosy they can be.”
Harry stands uncertainly with everyone else but then Luna is striding over to Ginny and Pansy has gone to Ron, so slowly Harry walks over to Blaise, wiping the hand not holding the gift nervously on his robes.
There’s also a seat beside Malfoy.
“Oh, you didn’t tell her first, Ginny.” George says while unwrapping a chocolate frog. He offers one to Harry who grins and accepts. “That were me.”
Draco takes his hands, feeling something in him bolster at Harry’s confession. “If I’m that person for you, and you’re that person for me, then why not let people know it?” He gathers his courage and says the words. “Let’s tell our friends.”
“They still haven’t managed to get a Defence teacher to stay for more than a year, you know.” Draco says almost conversationally. Harry would have believed the question was casual if it weren’t for the close way the other wizard is watching him. “I’m sure McGonagall would welcome you with open arms if you ever do get tired of this. I know you- Well.” He catches himself. “I remember you weren’t sure about it.”
“To me it was like you had everything at the time,” Draco replies softly, a hint of apology in his voice. “I thought you didn’t need it.”
Hermione nodded. “We’re family.”
“Oh and I know, Draco. We all have, your father and I too. You know we fought in that war and grew horrified with the things we saw and did. We’ve changed too.”
Draco stares at him. “You want me to come to Gryffindor Common Room?”
“You can’t just leave.” Harry says, anger stirring inside his belly from the fear that this will end up just like last time, just like it had years ago in Hogwarts. “Not again.”
It’s new, this encouragement to branch out of your own House, but it’s a good change, and the school seems to be embracing it.
Not exactly good conversation with a stranger.
Harry shoots her a smile. She is more than capable of checking the time herself but Harry has always allowed Lily small indulgences.
Her laugh is happy. “Don’t joke, you’ll give the others ideas.”
“But I can’t-” Harry sucks in a sharp breath but it does nothing to stop the shakiness in those three words that Draco hears. “I don’t want to hide anymore. I want to go public and to do that I’ll risk whatever it takes, everything I know, and stick by your side through it all. I’m prepared to do that for you.” He swallows. “If you aren’t then- then I don’t know what we can do. I don’t see the point in this.”
"You're not taking notes?" Draco asks quietly, casually looking down as he writes his own.
“I thought you were meeting up with Ginny this afternoon.”
It’s softer now, more deliberate and Draco sinks into it. He likes that about Harry, the way he makes Draco feel. He isn’t overthinking or worrying about putting his weight on Harry because he knows if Harry doesn’t like it or is uncomfortable then he’ll say something.
And it’s the sex, definitely the sex, that makes Draco go so thoughtless that he can only reply with, “but you are.”
"Oh, sit down Weasel, I'm not about to hex him." She snaps, and it’s audible enough to reach even the Slytherin table; which isn't exactly a challenge since the entire Great Hall has gone quiet to watch the scene unfold. The staff table are eyeing the confrontation warily, a couple of the teachers looking ready to leap up to Potter’s defense at a moment’s notice.
“My family has too much money,” she waves off Harry’s curiosity. “I have to spend it somehow. Travelling is as good a way as any.”
The reason for that might be that their hands are still clasped together and Harry is rubbing his thumb over the back of Draco’s hand beneath their robes. He doesn’t want to move.
So he thinks quickly, and knowing he's probably burning his friendship with Harry as he speaks, he prays what he says works. "Potter."
“Whatever you want,” Harry promises him and a bit of the new tension in Draco’s body leaves him.
“Yeah.” Harry is attempting to kick off his shoes and Draco sighs and goes to grab his shoulders and guide him to the bed where he makes Harry sit.
“Draco, nobody with eyes and a sound mind could reasonably insult your looks.”
Draco flinches but it doesn’t stop him. “You do though. I haven’t changed, not really. If I had I wouldn’t be here instead of somewhere else moving on with my life.”
“Right then,” he regains his composure before Draco and looks at the Slytherins. “No more talking about how I’m a prude.”
Harry’s head snaps up. “You spoke to Molly?”
“Well I’m always second aren’t I? Hermione’s best in all our classes in our year, I’m second best. You’re the best Quidditch player in our year and Slytherin is always runner up. Ron’s your best mate, Ginny was your girlfriend, you’re the most famous in the class… no matter what I tried to do someone always got there first. Annoying you… well. That was one area I excelled.”
And funnily enough, apart from Ron and Hermione, Malfoy is the only one treating Harry exactly as he always has.
Everybody shakes their heads.
Hermione's hands fly to her mouth as her eyes widen in shock and Harry vaguely hears Ron clear his throat beside them both.
Draco is glaring at Blaise who backtracks, both hands held up in surrender.
He has no right to be mad at Draco now after all this time. Or maybe he does, but he has no desire to. This Draco is different from the one Harry knew years ago and he knows that as clearly as he knows anything else in his life.
, then the Basilisk, Nagini, Death Eaters and finally Draco.
Which is another thing that Harry Potter doesn’t give much thought to. What does it matter to Harry if Draco sees his old rival’s name plastered across the front page of the
Potter has even started chatting with him, Merlin forbid. Not for long, and never about anything that matters. Once they'd talked about the weather, another time about the upcoming Hogsmeade weekend- which Draco was not allowed to go to. There'd even been that debate they'd had over Quidditch during Potions the other day which had almost managed to draw Slughorn’s attention.
And when she puts it that way…
Songs fade into one another and faces blur past them but Harry can’t think about anything that isn’t Draco and his touch or his mouth for longer than a minute.
Draco had run, like the coward he was.
“Well, Potter can just kiss you, since this is his first spin to land on you. Or, since I’d say there was definite tongue in that last kiss, he can snog you and grab your arse.” Her eyes are wicked when Harry glances at her over Draco’s shoulder. “Your choice, Potter.”
Harry frowns. “Alright.”
“Right, sounds good. Thanks.” Harry says to them, not sure why Theo is telling him all of that- he knows perfectly well what the plan had been and feels not a smidgeon guilty at bailing. He’s left early before to visit Draco, which the rest well know, but now it feels different. It feels like a secret since what the two of them are doing is hardly something he wants the others to know about.
(It doesn’t matter that Kingsley has already offered him the job no strings attached. Maybe a couple of years ago Harry would have accepted that happily in the belief that he truly deserved it, but not anymore. Now he knows he needs to get into the Auror program on his own merit. He’s spent this entire year watching the Slytherins struggle to outshine everybody academically and with their good behviour just to try and carve a decent place for themselves after school. Harry would be the worst kind of person if he bore witness to that effort and didn’t even try himself.
“It was nice, I guess.” Draco offers finally. “Especially to talk to Severus again.”
Harry shakes his head, the energy from before still rushing through him. He can’t sit in a classroom right now because his magic will explode out of him if he doesn’t do something. Something physical.
Harry looks over at Draco who seems as if he is about to throw up. "Eventually some other Death Eaters, including Snape, came up. Snape killed Dumbledore like they'd planned together, since Dumbledore was dying anyway. Draco didn't cast the killing curse, Snape did, and then took Draco away. Snape told the other Death Eaters that were there fighting to come with him. I tried to follow them, but they
The tension comes back quickly and Draco grows somber again. “That’s how it felt though. Like there was only one choice for me.”
“They’d be idiots not to.”
"You are trying to save Mr. Malfoy from prison because he happened to save your life. Your words are in service of a magical binding, not because you wish the accused to go free or deem him innocent."
"Ah." Draco hums in understanding and drops the tie between them on the bedcovers, turning his head to look at Harry. His eyes are sad and heavy. "We were both rather awful that night, weren't we?"
“Because,” she says and then looks away. “Look, I didn’t. Not really.”
doing?
He hesitates. “All of the others? Pansy?” His eyes widen at Draco shaking his head. “Ginny-”
Seeing a teacher anywhere outside of school is odd. Seeing one in your house is one thousand times worse and more jarring.
He smiles back. “I’m just pining away for you, waiting for you to notice.”
Draco’s skin pushes past crimson to absolutely scarlet. “We don’t have to,” he repeats, and Harry lets all hint of teasing disappear, feeling a bit bad for tormenting him.
“What?”
Hermione smiles at her.
Draco raises an eyebrow in question.
“I’ll just be a minute!” He calls, already bounding up the stairs to his dorm. He tries to stay quiet as he gets in and rummages through his chest to find the invisibility cloak.
“Anyway.” Harry says when it becomes clear Draco is lost in his thoughts and staring at his papers. He almost looks longing but Harry knows that’s probably him deluding himself. He’s made the mistake of reading too much into things with Draco before and God knows he’s not going to do it again. “Weird to think about that kind of thing when we ended up here, huh?”
“What’s that all about?” She asks him, nodding towards Draco and Hermione who are speaking quietly, and Harry shrugs.
“I take note of Ron and Hermione being mentioned too, do you think I fancy them as well?”
And then he turns and walks back into the Great Hall.
“I thought we weren’t supposed to be getting drunk tonight,” Harry mutters, but takes another drink anyway before passing the cup back to Draco who does as well.
“Hermione,” he begins tiredly, trying all the same, but she speaks over him.
“Because he’s ashamed and wants to get off without it meaning anything?”
And Harry smiles, any tension between them gone. “Let’s go then shall we?”
So one night when he’s leaving the library with Draco and they pass a group of Fifth Year Hufflepuffs who say, “Hey Harry, hey Draco,” and Draco looks at him like he can’t believe that just happened, Harry smiles.
Something warms inside of Draco but he doesn’t say anything. Instead he takes a last drink of orange juice. “When do you want to ask McGonagall?”
“Hey,” Harry nudges him and speaks quietly. “Alright?”
Harry wants to reach out and take his hand.
Hermione and Harry share a look, so at least Harry knew he wasn’t the only one who saw the irony at Ron being the first to come to the Slytherins’ defense.
Draco looks down at their hands again. “But yours does. Whose to say mine doesn’t?”
Draco’s frown deepens. “Arseholes.”
Looking at Hermione, Draco thinks perhaps he’s been a little harsh with her. He’d seen from the outside when Ron and Harry hadn’t been speaking in Fourth Year. Everyone had known about Hermione and Ron’s spats in Sixth, even Draco, who was completely uninterested at the time because he’d had his own problems to deal with. And Harry has told him about Ron leaving him and Hermione when they’d been on the run during Seventh Year and how sad Hermione had been.
Draco turns around quickly and Harry makes an effort to include Luna in his smile. “Hello you two.”
"You have always been obsessed with him," Millie says blithely, eating a couple more grapes. "Don't let him hurt you, Draco."
“You told me years ago that you had feelings for him. Or you could have had, if things had been different.” She cocks her head. “They’re different now, aren’t they? You’ve become friends?”
For the morning he’s able to avoid thinking of Harry. He is getting ready with Blaise and Ron at Blaise and Ginny’s home and there is more than enough to keep him occupied. The groom is sitting around ready to go, looking like he is having the time of his life, but Draco is in constant communication with Luna, the head bridesmaid, who isn’t giving him clear answers on the day he most could have used them.
He doesn’t look at her. “It’s different for Ginny, Ron and Hermione, I think. For each of us probably. And how they feel is up to them. But Draco and the others have apologized to us, to all of us. True apologies where they own up to the ugly parts of our past. And we’ve all chosen to accept them.” For a brief moment he allows his eyes to slip shut, wishing he didn’t have to have this conversation but knowing it’s necessary. “And I’m so
“None of that, Weasley,” Draco tosses another slice of apple in his mouth. That’s his second one now, Harry notes. “Maybe before the war you had money as an excuse, but I happen to know for a fact that since then you and your family have been bombarded with interviews, book deals and merchandise plans. Not to mention Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes is killing it with income. You’re almost as rich as I am at this point.”
Harry turns to look at him with a dumbfounded expression. “I think that’s the first civil conversation Pansy and I have ever had.”
Hermione laughs. “Why does that not surprise me?”
“What are friends for?” Ron answers and Hermione nods.
So what if he's the only person among them who feels like there's somebody missing, making his chest squeeze painfully? So what if Harry wakes up in the morning hard and aching, breath heavy, Malfoy's voice just leaving his mind?
“Four? That can’t be right, you were only a baby a few months ago.”
It’s because of this he can’t help but wonder, even though it sounds absurd in his own head, whether last night was some sort of joke. A prank to finally cement his place at the bottom of the social hierarchy at the school.
Until Draco turns to go to the door and Harry’s hand shoots out to grab his wrist. “Stop.”
The man only glares at them all before taking his own batch of powder and throwing it on the fire.
“God,” Harry’s voice is farther away and Draco opens his eyes again to see him kneeling on the bed between Draco’s splayed legs. His hand is coated in lube and jerking himself quickly, making Draco’s stomach tighten. “I’ll remember you looking like this forever.”
at least as he looks back at McGonagall.
“Stop!”
Draco scowls at him, crossing his silk-pajama clad arms. “There’s plenty of time.”
Draco licks his lips. Harry’s eyes fall to the movement. And then they widen.
Ron looks over from talking to Hermione. “You know where the kitchens are?”
Chapter title taken from the song Heartbeats by José González.
And it’s not like Harry can blame him- he doesn’t really- he just… wishes it was different. Rather than dwell on that however Harry raises an eyebrow at Hermione. “And you do? You’re not mad?”
“Fine.” Draco says, and Harry huffs a bit in laughter. “Just- it’s been a while.”
“As corny as it is to say, I’ve changed.” Draco looks agonized while meeting his eyes. “I can’t hurt you anymore. I’m going to tell my parents the truth and if I have to live without them in my life I will. If I lose the name of Malfoy I will. But I can’t keep lying to you and I can’t keep trying to push you away. It hasn’t worked because I don’t want it to. I love you, Harry, and I want you. I’m sorry I’m not stronger, strong enough to let us both move on, but I can’t keep pretending I’m not completely gone for you.
“Why not?”
“What? Draco, the others-”
“Quite alright.”
“Yeah. Well, actually we spoke through the fire that first time but after that we were owling back and forth like mad. Same with me and Aunt Andromeda, though Mum took care of most of those pictures. That’s where I got the ones of Professor Lupin and… cousin Nymphadora.”
“I’ll tell you later.” Ron promises quietly and Hermione purses her lips but accepts it.
“Erm, you mentioned it once.” Harry says awkwardly and Blaise’s face breaks out into a smile.
Draco is affronted. "I wasn't-"
“We’ll meet you later then Harry.” Neville says and Harry smiles in agreement before turning to Blaise.
“Of course it is! You’re Draco Malfoy, their son and heir. The only child they have. You’ve been a spoiled brat your entire life and you think
“This?”
All he knows is this.
“It did to me. A lot.” Draco sighs. “Now I just have to hope my
Harry hums. “You’ve all played before?”
More to the point, what is
“Yeah.” Harry says. “I figured.”
“Okay?” He asks simply even though his heart is breaking.
"Blaise!" The Gryffindor exclaims. He rights himself and adjusts his glasses, eyes hopeful. "Is Draco in there?"
The silence grows awkward until Draco breaks in by standing abruptly. “Would you like a tour, Harry?”
“Sure.” Blaise says easily. “Is it?”
Harry can’t reply, but it’s alright because Draco also takes advantage of the moment to tilt Harry’s head just slightly. And then their lips are meeting at a whole new angle that Harry definitely isn’t complaining about.
A costume party?
“Sorry. I’ll just have to avenge myself another night.”
The rest of the page has pictures of Sirius standing with Lupin, of Lupin and Harry, of the three of them together. Harry stares for ages at one of Tonks and Lupin on what must have been their wedding day.
“You can’t be serious!”
Draco is immediately assaulted with a memory. “So that diadem… in the Room…. After the Fiendfyre it was bleeding black. That was a horcrux, wasn’t it?”
It’s a problem because Harry hadn’t realized he was actually attracted to blokes like that until now. That is new. Sure, he’s looked, but he’d thought everyone did that.
"Oh." Harry had completely forgotten about that. Almost immediately after Malfoy had been declared innocent he'd hired an owl to deliver it back to Malfoy Manor. He'd never gotten a reply, and once it had been out of his sight it had been out of his mind as well. "Well, um. You're welcome, I suppose."
“I will.” Harry promises and then shoots a glare at Draco.
"Yes, why was that? There were plenty of open seats."
Draco sighs, uncovering his face to look over at Harry. “Yes. Though it does take away from my big romantic gesture of telling you I would be with you no matter what the consequences were.”
“I mean it.” Draco breathes and leans forward.
“Which you are not allowed to tease me about or bring up again after this conversation,” Draco growls a beat too late.
“None taken.” Harry says, finally looking around. “Where is everybody?”
“Um.” Harry repeats. “It’s not what it looks like?”
“What would you like, Harry, a memory for a Penseive?” Draco snaps and Harry shuts his mouth, looking a bit more understanding than a few moments before.
The door flies open and there’s Hermione in a black and white dressing robe and plaid bottom pajamas peeking out from underneath. “There you are! I had a feeling you’d be home soon.”
"Of course, Mother." He looks ahead as well, spotting Pansy's trunk just as it disappears into the train.
“It’s fine,” Draco waves off whatever Blaise is about to say. “I’ll take Harry home. You get these two.”
“Great.” Draco seems to be trying to stay fairly upbeat but Harry can see the constant reminder of his sentence is starting to irritate him. He doesn’t know what he could say to help so instead he just tries to pretend he’s not here, knowing Draco would rather that than be further embarrassed.
He remembers cutting open Draco’s chest and not even bothering to apologize after, only walking away with his clothes dripping with water and Draco’s blood.
"Care for a dance?" She asks him. Her eyes are sparkling and there are pieces of hair coming out from her careful updo, but she doesn't look like a mess at all. In fact she looks happier and more beautiful than Harry has ever seen her.
them to a point on the street and Draco blinks, looking around and taking everything in quickly. A layer of snow blankets it all as far as he can see, and the streets are lined with cottages. Many of them have front lawns, a few of which are walled off, with snowmen and snow angels dotted here and there down the street lawns.
Ron comes out of the kitchen with three cups of tea hovering beside him. After seeing Harry hidden in Hermione's embrace he directs them over to the table before moving closer, unsure what to do.
He’d found out a lot about his family in recent months that had surprised him, but the fact that his parents love each other hasn’t changed. Even now, with Father in jail and Mother alone, Draco knows there isn’t a chance of either of them forgetting about the other.
Harry shrugs. "Fine by me."
and arriving back at the Burrow.
Harry shrugs. “Not your fault.”
“Harry!” Teddy’s grandmother stands immediately and moves forward to kiss both his cheeks and grip his elbows tightly, smiling warmly. The corners of her eyes crinkle happily. “Oh darling, I haven’t seen you in ages.”
“Did you not think to trace the magical signature yourself?” McGonagall looks over in amusement. “It would have taken a spell to copy your handwriting, and your husband’s.”
Harry fingering him isn’t new and it brings back a good bit of Draco’s arousal, but after ages, after longer than they’ve ever done it before because Harry is taking his time and being extra careful and thorough, the fingers pull away and Draco watches as Harry grips his own cock and slicks it with lube.
“I couldn’t be with him anyway,” Draco’s voice had barely been a whisper and he had still been staring into the flames. He watched as sparks popped from the logs to fly through the air only to wink out against the fire grate.
“We’ll be right behind you.” He promises and she nods and leaves before he hurriedly closes the door again, falling against it and letting out a long breath. “Holy Merlin.”
"Ron!" Hermione hisses. "And you know the only reason so many Slytherins didn't fight was because McGonagall made them leave-"
His mouth falls open.
He grins. “You too, Professor.”
“Surely you can figure that out yourself, Potter?”
Merlin but he looks… something in Harry’s stomach swoops at the sight of Draco lying on his side, the blanket covering him from the waist down. He can’t draw his eyes away from the marks on Draco’s chest and his neck, Merlin, what had Harry done to his
“You did.” Draco presses. “I- I still have them in my room. Two letters, one from you and one from Father. I told you I was- that I’m gay and that I loved Harry and both of you said the same thing.”
Draco blinks and stops on the spot. He’d just been about to leave to get a book for a Herbology essay. “Wha- Ginevra?”
“-and at my mercy.” His grin is wicked, those green eyes full of amusement. “What should I do with you…”
spell.
“What, Harry?” Draco eventually asks, voice defensive. “Merlin, you’d think I’d spat in Hagrid’s shoes from the way you’re watching me. I thought you liked that I was getting along with him now.”
"'Mione-"
“I’ll let Ron know.” Draco says carefully and he’s sure he doesn’t imagine the slight deflation of Harry’s posture.
"I missed you too." Harry says but she isn't finished.
They pass a couple more minutes with Blaise inspecting the book and telling Harry about it while offering chocolates to him that he accepts. But then Blaise is cursing under his breath.
Harry’s grin returns. He licks Malfoy again, each time trying to probe deeper and deeper until he can’t draw it out anymore and stick his tongue in past the muscle as far as it will go.
Which of course is when they have their first real test.
Blaise nods and they spend a little while longer sitting out at the lakeside until heading back in. This time Harry’s shoulders feel a little lighter than they had before.
“Hagrid?” Hermione says in surprise. “Oh, I forgot to visit him today. Dammit. Do you suppose I’ll have time tomorrow?”
“And if you don’t want me back anymore… I understand. And I’ll stay away. But this time I’m being honest and telling you that I will always want to be with you.
She grins at him teasingly. “Regretting our breakup so soon?”
“Tea, Potter?” She asks easily while already pouring a cup.
“Darling, please.” Narcissa rolls her eyes. “Friends benefit from each other all the time. If you’re not getting something from the relationship then you wouldn’t be happy. That’s how life works.”
“A big one.” The other girls pipes up. “It’s reached out into the hall!”
He clinks their cups and then his smile returns as his eyes fart over Harry’s shoulder. “There you are Draco! Do you know how long we’ve been waiting?”
Everyone stops as Draco chokes. “Excuse me?”
“So, I think I understand, at least a little. I forgive you, I can look at you without being angry now. I realized I actually like you, the post-war you. I could be friends with this you.” Harry repeats. “I am friends with you. Or- or I thought so. But it’s fine if you don’t feel the same way.” His eyes fall to Draco’s chest and he knows what Potter’s thinking, remembers being cut open in a bathroom. “You told me you’ve done terrible things. I’ve done some too. Worse, maybe. To you, to your family. And I’m still angry about- about a lot of things. But I’m
Draco wakes up the morning of Blaise and Ginny’s wedding day decidedly not nervous.
“Now stick your wand out, just like that yeah.” Harry’s voice drifts to him and Draco opens his eyes, not realizing that he’d closed them.
“Let me go.”
Soon a year has passed since the
Draco Malfoy's trial is over.
home every night isn’t the most convenient, especially when he has mountains of homework to grade.
And Lucius and Narcissa have never asked either.
But he can't help the question that comes from his lips. "That's it for you and the Weaslette then?"
With careful searching his hand eventually grasps them and he puts them back on. For a few moments he just takes in Draco, breathing softly, chest rising gently, and an overwhelming surge of fondness fills him.
this place.
“I see.” Blaise sounds like he’s musing out loud. “So you’re thinking what if Draco loses his family, his name and his fortune because of you and then later, if things don’t work out, he also loses any chance of regaining the acceptance of the general public.”
Draco’s eyes darken further. “Careful or I won’t be able to stop myself from fucking you so hard you can’t walk out of this room.” He sucks in a shaky breath. “Merlin, I forgot how you were in bed.”
“I’m sorry.”
“You’re a good friend.” He forces a slight smile. It’s weak. “But it’s fine and I really just wish you’d leave it.”
“Thank you, Professor.” Draco says quietly.
“Yeah.” They lean into one another again as Harry wraps an arm around her to squeeze lightly. “I know.”
"Don't flatter yourself," Harry tells him and clenches his fist at the sting of the words, the truth of them. "I honestly think every person I've fucked since you have had more of an effect on my heart than you ever did. You affected my gag reflex at most, I'll say that."
Two men shadow them the entire night as security detail for Mother but even that can’t take away from Draco’s mood. He feels on top of the world and when he finds his friends waiting for him that feeling only grows.
Harry takes in a breath. "No."
The lie burns coming out of his mouth but he yanks open the door and hurries away, hearing it gently shut behind him.
“Of course it does.” Hermione replies gently, touching his arm lightly, with her eyes warm and soft. “You’re a war hero, Harry. People see you making an effort with Malfoy, and there’s rumors-” She stops suddenly, making Harry look at her sharply.
“Go.” Blaise waves his hand. “We’ll be here when you get back.”
And it
was to him. “Besides Hagrid.”
Harry nods, watching him closely.
“Alright.” Harry decides. “Alright, I will.”
It hadn’t been a good night for either of them. She’d had to watch as Blaise got married and he had to endure his first sober one-on-one run-in with Potter since Hogwarts.
“Good?”
Draco shifts from foot to foot. “He should be. He was fine when he left. Just… make sure?”
It feels significant, somehow, Harry saying his name in that way in this moment and Draco closes his eyes briefly. But his courage is there and he won’t let it leave without using it.
He clears his throat, forcing himself to look away from Draco for a second, breaking eye contact as he stares at a point near his shoulder, and then unable to help himself as he looks back into the grey. “How are you?”
... I forget what it was, but you said something-"
But Harry feels him. A presence at his back that wasn’t there before, a warmth that’s a mixture of adrenaline, anticipation and fear that runs through him as he turns his head and looks up slightly to find Draco standing behind him.
And maybe it’s because Christmas is soon and Harry is feeling… not nostalgic, but that familiar sense of envy. That feeling of loss and want he gets when he thinks of his friends and the other Hogwarts students all going home and making new memories to replace the war. Or maybe it’s the way that Draco is still holding Harry’s hand, and it’s warm, and Draco looks so concerned that makes Harry want to open up to him.
Another thing Draco had taught him.
Eventually Harry slips his hands under Draco’s bathrobe at his shoulders and moves it off of him. The tie, already loose, comes completely undone with little resistance and the article of clothing slithers onto the bed beside them as Draco shrugs it off.
He remembers what Draco had confessed to him last night, about the letters from back at Hogwarts. Both Lucius and Narcissa had forbidden him from being with Harry or coming out as gay, he’d said.
“Surprised you, have I?”
“Harry!” Her voice is sharp and it takes him so off guard that he stops and turns to look at her. “Look, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but when this thing between you and Draco-”
“Okay.” He walks towards the door, stopping to look back at the last minute. “I’ll see you soon.”
(He’d known, of course, that Mother and Father had done things for Voldemort before and during the First Wizarding War. But he’d always believed what his father said about them being
“If it helps,” Draco breaks in hesitantly, resting his hands on his robe covered legs. “Everyone I’ve spoken to is saying the same thing.”
“Well.” Draco says and then stops, seemingly not able to find the words. “Well. See, what’s happening is…”
Harry blinks and tears his eyes away. “Yeah. Um, this way.”
“Nothing.”
Some of what he’s thinking obviously shows on his face because concern replaces Harry’s frown. “Or maybe not? Maybe you want this as much as I do?”
His robes are freshly washed, pressed, and hanging up on his wardrobe door to avoid wrinkles. He has the rings safely sitting on his bedside table and the schedule for the day memorized.
His smile is weak and barely there. “Sorry.”
“And me!” Ginny says.
Blaise stands and moves towards the door, opening it to leave. "It can be pretty damn close to one."
He glances at Luna and Neville to see Neville squirm uncomfortably. "Well, you two are very, er, passionate in your dislike for one another."
His fear must show on his face because Harry’s softens immediately in understanding as he reaches out to gently hold Draco’s wrist.
“Here.” He passes over the tea, snapping Draco out of his plight. The blonde’s face smoothes out, all irritation gone as gratefulness replaces it.
“Is that enough?”
“What amazes me,” Draco surprises Harry by saying, “is that all of you can stand to even be in the same room as me.” A short pause. “Especially you, Potter.”
Narcissa sits on one side of it. Draco waits, looking at Harry, so Harry slowly takes the love seat, hoping this isn’t some sort of test. Draco hesitates again, glancing between them both, before sitting on the other end of the sofa his mother is on.
At least he doesn’t look as bad now as he had in Fifth Year, Draco thinks, looking him over. Back then Harry had nearly permanent bags under his eyes and skin so drained and pale it had looked akmost unhealthy. It was like he’d been scared to sleep or something with how tired he’d been.
“That I love him.”
“No way.” Harry’s eyes are stern behind his glasses. “Remember what your father did last time and then decide whether you want to finish that sentence.”
And his eyes are filled with so much hurt and anger that Draco's mouth goes dry. For a second he's actually afraid Potter will curse him, but instead he just says three words.
“Never?” Draco sounds shocked, stopping to stare at him. “What do you all do in that tower?”
Ron lets out a yelp and jumps back on the couch.
Harry nods, not really listening. “I’m going to get drinks, want me to get you one?”
“And give him one of the Hangover Potions I gave you. If he needs it.” Another pause. “I’ll bring you a fresh batch soon.”
A tendril of smoke is curling up from Harry’s spot as the voice of a crying woman fills the Great Hall.
Blaise only sighs. “Okay.”
Draco is quiet for a few minutes. “You mean Severus.”
When Harry shivers Draco snaps.
“You wish!” Harry calls after him as Draco speeds away to search the other side of the pitch. He can’t stop grinning and his eyes stay on Draco for longer than they should have really, considering he’s in the middle of a game.
The expression that produces in Draco is nothing other than indignant. “I hope you don’t mean that. Not after what better be the best night of your life.”
He sighs. If he’s going to go he should go now so they won’t be disturbed.
He nods, throat tight.
“How’s that? You’re one of his best mates and you’re closer than any of the rest of us are to him.”
"Docile." She supplies and then goes back to talking to Ginny.
Oh. “Erm…”
"Harry," she says timidly, reaching a hand out to place it on his gently. "What's happened tonight that’s so different? Why are you suddenly ready to tell us now?"
He’d walked over, slumping in the third chair and watched them both for a second, seeing Hermione’s small smile and Ron’s hand twitch.
"Please use the accused's first name Mr. Potter, to avoid confusion." The woman interrupts him.
Harry can’t believe what he’s hearing.
“But?”
Harry scans around at his friends again to bet met with only unhelpful stares. "You're joking."
He expects Draco’s anger to come out in full force now. Harry expects the latent animosity that’s between them to be proven in harsh preparation and rough, full strokes of Draco’s cock inside him. They may have just had a startlingly raw and almost tender conversation but that doesn’t make up for the recent months or erase any memories.
Harry nods. “I meant it when I told you I wanted to get past that.”
“Oh and what is he meant to do? Telling her that his secret boyfriend wouldn’t like the two of them talking so she better bugger off? Come on.”
"You made a right fool of yourself anyway." He drawls out, working out a knot in her shoulder with his thumb.
“I’m not. I love them, you know I do, but there is always going to be a part of me that knows you could do better. You could do a thousand times better than me, Harry, I’ll never hesitate to admit that, and I’m sure Ron and Hermione think so too, no matter what’s changed. I’m scared of the day you wake up and realize that too.”
Harry resists the maniacal smile he feels coming on and shakes his head instead. "How hard was it to push those words out of your mouth?"
Draco almost bares his teeth at him as Marylton goes on, saying words like petrol, motor and driving code, words Draco writes down quickly and makes a mental note to look up in his textbook later. He vaguely knows automobiles are similar to the train for Hogwarts, he’s seen them around before, but learning the basics of how they work is completely out of his depth.
who happened to draw the short stick and get so unlucky. However I most definitely was not aware that they would be forging letters and sending them to Draco while pretending to be Lucius or myself.”
“Too much?”
"He would heal us sometimes, depending on what had happened that day, and bring water because we were so thirsty. And sometimes he would tell me my father was alright and alive, and that was the kindest thing he could have done."
“Potter what on earth-”
when you’re nice to your sister.” Harry says.
oooOOOooo
Should he say that an
Harry frowns. “What is it?”
“Hey there you are!” The dark-haired wizard says happily. “I’ve been looking for you, you practically ran out of that Potions exam.”
Harry is definitely warm. His skin feels on fire all over, and as Draco’s tongue sweeps through his mouth he lets out a low sound, one he hopes only Draco can hear.
They finish showering quickly after that. Draco is no longer interested in looking at Potter’s chest, or arms, or back or arse. Instead he dresses quickly, putting his shirt on first and making sure his arm is completely covered.
Malfoy blinks at her once before turning to Harry with a sneer. "Can't fight your own battles anymore, Potter? Need Granger and Weasel to defend you? Did the Dark Lord take it all out of you?"
He opens his eyes anyway and his heart still sinks a bit when he sees nothing. Immediately he feels foolish but before Harry can say anything, or try and comfort him or give more advice, he says, “Wait. I just need a new memory. That one didn’t work.”
Surprise filled him. “Huh?”
Another page is turned and now it is all of their friends in pictures together. None of them are looking at the camera but there are pictures of him with Pansy and Millie, and one with the boys from Slytherin. Harry’s eyes get caught on one of the whole big group of them together, arm in arm and laughing and walking up the hill from the Quidditch pitch, their faces flushed and hair a mess from the wind, with brooms slung over their shoulders after a quick match.
An overwhelming surge of affection fills Draco and he leans forward to kiss Harry chastely.
“I want to take you so hard you’ll scream. I want you underneath me, skin to skin, your body pressed to mine as I touch every bit of you. Do you remember that, how I used to touch you?”
The Eighth Years have less curses aimed at them in the halls, are doing well in school, and have been gaining them all House Points. For Merlin’s sake, they’re friends with Harry Potter and his entourage now. Even the First Years are smart enough to know to go to them for protection if they need it. And if their year can do so well after the war then of course the younger years can too.
“Could be worse.” Harry says casually, which is true. He feels more confident buying for Blaise than Theo at least.
“What- what do you mean?” Harry’s eyes rove all over him, trying to find a hint that this is another joke or- or something. “Draco. You can’t just- after everything you’ve just said to me-”
“Have you been hit in the head with a bludger in the five minutes I was talking to her? I’m with you, you prat, of course I’m not just going to-”
"I thought you were ignoring me!"
“Draco-”
“The ones he sent Lucius and I in Eighth Year?” She’s watching him closely and Harry really wishes he was wearing more than one layer of silk right now. “Telling us about the two of you, and the supposed replies from us he received?”
She’s looking at him with so much sorrow and pity he feels a lump begin to form in his throat and has to breathe in quickly. “I never received a letter from you that said anything about a romantic relationship between you and Harry. And I most definitely would not have written this back to you if I had.”
Draco has, entirely against his will, discovered that Ginny is a rather sexual person. More than once he and Theo have been unceremoniously kicked out of their dorm.
Draco tries not to give away that he had spent all morning making sure there was nothing too embarrassing in here. A few photographs of him with his parents throughout the years, and others with some of his friends, are the only remnants of his childhood really. He has a small bookcase that holds a few volumes from when he was a kid but those are mostly overshadowed by the school textbooks he’s kept to reread, a few novels, and Rita Skeeter’s biography of Albus Dumbledore.
in and out, getting a few of the reporters and overeager fans off of the platform.
It shouldn't be surprising. Really. It shouldn't. Draco had known Harry's sexuality well before anybody else after all, and of course the
The silence beside him causes him to look at the green-eyed git.
“That you won’t tell anybody outside this room unless we say you can.” Harry is pinned by Draco’s sudden attention. “Harry, you officiate it.”
The words cause Harry to smile teasingly. “Stealing date ideas from Ron now, are we?”
But then, like a dam breaking, the people all rush in.
“Who knows?” Harry shrugs, watching Draco. “Maybe he would have anyway. His grandfather and uncle were the type.”
But his body knows Draco’s and so he can’t ignore the fact that their fuck has turned into something dangerously close to lovemaking.
When Blaise comes down to eat he grabs the freshly folded paper Draco has put facedown on the table. After a tense second of anticipation he feels his friend’s eyes shoot to him after he sees the picture and read the headline.
to the train station and he has no intention of letting her know. He’s sure she’s had one up for just as long.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco challenges, a knowing smirk on his face.
So he juts his chin up and crosses his arms, raising an eyebrow. "Malfoy."
At least he hadn’t been Umbridge, he thought to himself, taking in the mock Dementors and large room. She’d been left to the mercy of the centaurs. That was far worse than being on the receiving end of a few jinxes, even from Ginny.
Ron’s mouth falls open but Harry notices he hasn’t even spared Ginny a glance. Instead his best friend is staring helplessly at Hermione. “Christ, Hermione, you look…”
I wouldn’t hesitate to do it because I
“I always thought Slytherins were racy and- and promiscuous, I suppose would be the word though it doesn’t seem right. You all gave us grief for being prudes, and Pansy and Theo certainly don’t seem like innocents. Plus you told me about the games you all played up here.”
His decision is made for him when the
Harry groans, head falling to rest against Draco’s shoulder and wrapping his arms around his thin frame. “Fucking Hogsmeade.”
“If we were playing honestly you wouldn’t have been allowed to bet in the first place.” Pansy says.
Harry grins at him, a wide and easy grin and Draco sees him glance towards the Gryffindor table, face wavering with indecision for a second before he seems to make up his mind and come over to where Draco is.
Draco’s not sure what to expect from his time back home, and he’s not willing to admit to anyone besides himself that he’s a bit nervous to be there, but it certainly isn’t his mother wandering around and humming.
Something that until now he’s managed to keep a secret, but oh well. Harry’s face is a mask of surprise.
"Draco," Blaise sat beside him. "What happened?"
It’s a poor lie, given that it’s dusk and Draco knows she’d been out at them earlier, but he lets her have it just as she’d given him a moment of to compose himself. He’d seen her wipe at her eyes before she’d been able to hide her face, and he’d heard the thickness of her voice.
“I’m fine.” She whispers.
He forces himself to stand up to his full height and stare forward defiantly, not meeting anybody's eyes or listening to their whispers. He knows what they're saying. They've been saying it all summer after all.
He hesitates.
couples aren’t you? What am I saying, of course you are. How none of us have noticed already…”
He hesitates but shakes his head. “No of course not. Let me just go and get dressed and then I’ll make us some tea. Wait for me in the living room?”
Draco sees Pansy drop her fork onto her plate, her mouth hanging slightly open as she stares at the Head Table in absolute shock. Whispers break out in the Hall, some loud and angry, others belonging to people nodding their heads. He sees Granger practically beaming at McGonagall and Weasley's mouth, full of food- how, when food hasn't even appeared yet?- gaping behind her.
Not gonna lie, I'm nervous about this one you guys. Hope you enjoy!
“You did. You said it yourself: you undoubtedly have feelings for him. That means you want to be with him, which means-”
Circe. He stops for a second at the sight of Harry turning around from looking outside his office window. The wizard’s clothes are wrinkled, his skin is still flushed and his
Draco looks down and swirls the remaining alcohol in the glass tumbler. "Just... forget it, alright? There's no point telling them now when everything's done and over."
“No! How do you know?” Theo demands.
“You would have absolutely hated me.” Draco says before frowning. “Or, well I suppose you did, didn’t you? Predictable that.”
Mental, Harry thinks, especially when they all look just fine normally. But he supposes he’s the same, feeling anxious about tonight just because it’s meant to be fancy, meant to be special.
As always, when he tries to imagine telling his parents, his mind hits a blank. He can’t picture it. Can’t even begin to imagine the faces they’ll make or the words they’ll say.
“Well what other reason is there? We’re committed aren’t we? This isn’t just some fling. But this is never going to go anywhere if we just keep hiding it forever! If you aren’t ashamed of me you would have no trouble telling people. It’s not like it could possibly damage your reputation any further-”
His eyes do a quick scan of the temporary workspace. A plain but large desk takes up quite a bit of the room and it’s covered in papers spread under Draco’s fingertips. A few ink bottles and quills sit on the wooden surface and one chair sits over against the right wall. Another chest of drawers has a few books sitting on top of it, one opened haphazardly, the pages looking up at the ceiling.
Her question is very pointed now and Draco tries to glare at her without Harry seeing.
He knows they notice something. His stares at Draco in the Great Hall aren’t subtle and neither are the ones he catches the blonde throwing his way either. Pansy has asked him several times whether he knows what’s gotten Draco in such a bad mood and every time Harry has had to pretend he doesn’t.
When Harry pulls the barest of distances away and licks over the spot with his tongue Draco inhales deeply trying to regain control of himself.
Harry looked over in surprise. “Really?”
My apologies to Romilda Vane, I'm sure she grew up to be a wonderful person.
He knows Draco’s concerned about job prospects. He knows that some if not most of the Potions Masters he’s reached out to aren’t in England, or even the U.K. They haven’t talked about what that might mean for them, they’re more concerned with the pressing issue of the response from Draco’s parents, but they will once Draco gets Lucius and Narcissa’s answers.
“Thank God.” Draco slumps against the wall in relief before his grey eyes flicker back up to Harry’s with hope shining in them. “Now can I please kiss you?”
“How did we even start talking about this?” He mumbles, looking away from them all to gaze out the open doors.
“Oh, Draco, don’t worry, it’s just for fun,” she waves him off. “Get one of us to buy it for you, or someone else.”
“You should.” Draco walks lightly beside him, radiating glee. “Luna puts in the most amazing things. She’ll slip in passing references to all of you here and there.”
“Believe what you like,” Narcissa says confidently. “I know what you look like when you love someone. And though I don’t know Potter nearly as well, I do recognize love when I see it. Which is why I was so confused when school ended and you’d cut off all ties with him, and so happy when I saw his letter to you a couple of months ago.”
“When?”
“Hey, Luna.” He greets, falling into step beside her. “Good thanks. How are you?”
“Right then ev’ryone, ready to go? Oh hello, you lot. Ready ter move out?”
Millie shrugs. “A lot of it was old-fashioned bollocks, as you all know.” She exchanges glances with the other Slytherins. “But I suppose the loyalty we all have with each other is nice. It comes from growing up thinking it’s a group of you against everybody else.”
“I’m fine.” He lets Harry go and looks back at her to raise an eyebrow. “Should we talk about this?”
“Well what
He meets Draco’s eyes who looks a mixture of apologetic and nervous, and the sight makes Harry boil because- well, this is Draco’s home, isn’t it? Why should his mother do this, force them all together and make an awkward situation even worse?
Draco blinks and speaks before he can think to stop himself. “But- she wasn’t that old.”
"I loved who you were, Harry. Back in Eighth Year." Draco bites his lip. "I don't love you now. Not after everything. You've changed, you're- we don’t fit. I could never be with you and I don’t want to, not after everything."
“Oh, that’s good!” Hermione says to Luna. “How did you do that, Neville?”
Draco hesitates. “Maybe. Perhaps if- after exams, after the year is done-”
“Is that what you really think?”
“I really do love it.” He reassures him. “Honestly. This is the best thing anybody’s gotten me since… maybe ever.” His eyes are searching Draco’s, getting lost in the grey. “Thank you.”
No, Harry really doesn’t remember anything.
Draco is watching Ron closely and once Hermione finishes he speaks, voice low. “It will be a hard Christmas for everybody, I think. Perhaps even worse than last year.”
“We’re looking into who could be the culprit, of course.” Narcissa continues, coming back to herself. “But I am telling you that Draco is always going to be a part of this family. He’s the best of us, you know.”
Draco follows him less enthusiastically.
Pansy hadn’t looked away for even a second. “Those kisses didn’t look friendly.”
“I guess I’m saying… if you want to stop this,” he gestures between them. “If you don’t want to be my friend anymore where people could see and talk, I get that.”
It's a very nice office, if Draco does say so himself. The walls are a lovely shade of green, just light enough for the room not to feel dark and enclosed, but not blindingly so. His desk is directly opposite the door, with his very comfortable chair behind it, and two not so comfortable chairs in front for any guests. (He won’t admit he’s stolen the idea of making his guests uncomfortable from Headmaster McGonagall). On top of it are papers upon papers of experiments he's conducting with potions, and correspondence letters between him and his employer, Thelonious Karlton, the Potions Master he works for. Against the wall to the right is a liquor cabinet of oak, polished with a dark sheen to perfection. The glass display shows the crystal chalices of drink within, and underneath that is a place for drinking glasses resting on a silver tray, with the most recently used drink beside them- top closed, of course, because he’s not a barbarian.
“Because everything he’s done hurt my family! I don’t know how you’ve forgotten that, but people I love got hurt because of him. Bill got attacked in this very castle because Malfoy allowed Greyback in here. Fred died.”
He chooses Nathan, a Gryffindor in Second Year, and Draco picks Laleh right after. Keanu from Hufflepuff goes to Harry and the last Fourth Year, Lynne from Gryffindor, smiles at Laleh and goes to stand by her. Then Harry chooses Leo so Draco picks Nelson, another Slytherin from the same year. Keeping up with the pattern they’ve established Harry gets Holly from Gryffindor and Draco calls over Cory, the Seventh Year Ravenclaw.
“Want a cuppa or anything?” Ron asks through a yawn as they make their way to the house. “I’m sure Hermione’s drinking some tea already with a book.”
Draco's voice makes Harry pull up short and stop, facing away towards the open yard and not looking at the couple.
Draco fails to see where the excitement in that fact comes from, but he smiles anyway. “I think I’ve heard of something like that before.”
Ginny is wide eyed. "Of course. Just a mo'." She says, before making her way past them to the living room to get to the kitchen.
“Not just now,” he says. “Another time. Soon.”
“Admit it,” Harry rebuts.
Draco declines.
Draco grimaces. “It usually was with him.”
He had felt overwhelmed watching Harry, and not with anger. The other man had saved his life in the Room of Requirement, had died but come back to life, and then had defeated Voldemort. Draco hadn’t understood much of what had happened yet, it had all been so fast, but he had known it wasn’t anger. Not yet. Not until his parents were sentenced and his family fell into ruin.
Something inside Draco softens towards her.
He flinches, not expecting that sort of barb from her. “No.”
“Please, she’s terrified of me.” Draco answers. “Poor First Year Hufflepuff thinks I’m the big bad Slytherin Death Eater. Which isn’t really wrong.” He adds as an afterthought.
“I suppose yeah. God. Is it ridiculous for me to hope that this year turns out alright for me? No Voldemort or threatening monster or murders. Just… this.”
Blaise isn’t sure yet what he’ll do. Apparently he plans on visiting Goyle in Australia for a bit and then coming back. Harry isn’t sure, but it sounds like Ginny might join him.
that goes through him.
“Got something to say Draco?” Blaise asks in a tone that borders on challenging.
They’re laughing together and touching each other, and everything is like it used to be, like it was back at Hogwarts, and Harry is looking at Draco and Draco is looking at Harry and Harry knows he’s never been more in love with him than right now.
Once or twice a few younger year girls try to come in but almost all of them let out squeaks of surprise and turn on their heel to leave immediately after spotting the trio at the windowsill. Eventually Draco rolls his shoulders back, feeling his stiff limbs, and that seems to draw Harry’s attention because his gaze goes from Myrtle to Draco sharply.
She shrugs. “No. I don’t like him personally, but like I said before. The two of you… well. You’re alike, in a lot of ways.”
Harry grips the man’s dark robes in return and pulls him closer until they’re not really separated by space anymore. Draco’s breath huffs across Harry’s face and he remembers that moment, weeks ago in Harry’s own office when the two of them had been so close to kissing. He remembers before that, down in Draco’s office when they’d fucked for the first time in years.
“Harry, Hedwig is the only pet you’ve ever had.” Hermione corrects. “You don’t have any comparison.”
“Do you think you two will grow up and live happily ever after together?” Now Blaise’s voice is cruel. “You think you’ll get married and have some kids and that’s it?”
the water as he moves.
Ron splutters. “You’re joking!”
Even through all of that Draco had known he’d had a crush on the Boy Who Lived. It’s his biggest secret, the thing Draco has ignored about himself for years and worked tirelessly to hide from everyone else.
And if after that comment that's when the string of his one-night stands starts in earnest, nobody but Harry could know. Anytime anybody shoots Harry a second look when he's out somewhere, their eyes dark and interested, Harry hears Pansy's voice "
“What time is it?” Harry asks Draco finally, making the other boy shrug.
But he’s so used to having the rug pulled out from under him lately that it seems easier to prepare himself, just in case.
It's a disaster.
Harry lets out a breath. “So we’re okay?”
“It never even occurred to me.”
“I can’t last.” Harry warns.
“A few days and years too long,” Draco replies while standing up and Harry’s forced grin is wiped off his face. “But like I said, I understand. Don’t feel any pressure, please. I would hate it if-” He catches himself. “Don’t do anything you don’t want to.” Draco finally says. “It would kill me if you were only with me because I want it.”
“I keep telling him that everyone in the room already knows the basics of Potions so he doesn’t need to go into so much detail, but does he listen?”
“Forever.” She repeats seriously and Harry tries to hide his laugh. “You missed him too!”
“Harry.” Draco pulls away with a slight frown, making the other boy straighten and look back at him curiously. “I don’t mean tell everybody.”
Draco glares.
Especially him, though he would never say that now.
“Keep your presents Teddy,” Harry advises. “I’m sure your Uncle Ron will be asking for one soon enough, and if you’re not careful they’ll all be gone.”
“Um, have you met Hermione?” Ron asks at the same time Ginny says, “Excuse you!”
Harry is a bit closer now, hand stretched out as if to help move Draco’s arm into position and he looks a bit bashful at being caught. Draco smiles.
“You can’t be serious?” He asks her and she smiles.
He doesn’t say any of that though.
,” and manages to help haul Draco to his feet and bat the blonde’s hand away to grab his cock and stroke once, twice, three times before Draco is done for, his spunk coating Harry’s chest as the two of them kiss relentlessly beside the falling water.
“I’m really happy for you guys,” he says, clinking his glass against both of theirs. “Honestly.”
Draco sighs. “Thanks.” He swallows. “Sorry. I took over your story.”
“I am, thanks Hagrid.” He replies quietly. “You?”
“They’re okay.” He replies quietly. “Mum misses Dad. I haven’t seen him since he was sentenced to Azkaban, but apparently they’re able to send letters for Christmas. As a reward for good behaviour.”
They both look down at the graves again until Draco breaks the silence once more.
what everyone goes on about then.
“Wait, you
He does a few loops around the stands, eyes alert for any sign of golden movement. His attention is snagged by Nelson making the first goal and then Nadia hustling the Quaffle back to score almost immediately after on Cory to even them up. Most of the game is spent with the players dropping the ball and having to dive down to pick it up from the ground, or catching it midfall, but the players are laughing and calling out good-naturedly to one another, so Harry only smiles to himself and watches it all. Draco’s laugh carries over to him once or twice, and he even hears the oldest Slytherin calling out encouragement to his team here and there.
“Draco.” Harry says. “Oh my God, Draco.”
,” she waves a hand at the letters in McGonagall’s hand, face full of disgust, “is nothing of the sort.”
Thanks for reading! Feel free to comment or talk to me on Tumblr!
“Neither did we,” the Slytherin finally answers, turning back in time to see Hagrid nod thoughtfully.
Draco stares at him for a long time. “I don’t deserve you.”
-he looks up across the Great Hall to find Potter watching him.
Her gaze is intent and it bores into him, making it impossible for Harry to look away. “Before this second war I had beliefs that are probably entirely contradictory to yours. Beliefs harmful to those you love. I will not deny it. Not only because it would be foolish and impossible to do so, but because I am strong enough to own up to my mistakes. Strong enough to realize they
Harry looks down, toe scuffing the ground as he shifts. He sees Draco’s fingers twitch in annoyance and smiles a bit. It’s funny, how concerned Draco is with posture and appearances. Part of his Pureblood upbringing, Harry supposes.
Draco finally turns and directs his wide grin at him.
But tonight, Harry’s trying to ignore all of that. He moves quickly, ducking his head the entire way, careful not to run into anyone and cause a scene. The people here are more concerned with themselves than one random bloke and for that Harry’s grateful. Finally, after minutes of struggle he makes it to the bar and waits to wave down a bartender. The one nearest him has a spiky blue mohawk and Harry wonders if it’s magic or Muggle product that she uses to make it stay so straight for hours in a packed night club.
“Well then, I suppose that brings this meeting to an end. Thank you for hearing me out.”
He does see Draco’s hand moving on himself, and in the last second before he comes he feels guilty about Draco having to get himself off while he’s giving Harry the best blowjob of his life.
Aunt Bella convincing Severus to teach him Occlumency had been a blessing really. Not even the Dark Lord had picked up on Draco’s secret.
Draco freezes.
“Don’t stop.” He asks. “I’m okay. Just let me get used to it all.”
“No, thank you. The others are waiting for me back at the club.” He rolls his eyes. “This is why I never offer to be the responsible one. Theo and Seamus aren’t holding back a bit. No thought to pacing themselves.”
There’s a bit of judgement in his tone and Harry tenses a bit. “Probably not for the reasons you’re thinking. And no, that’s not it. Not… exactly.”
“We just had a quick game.” Harry says, absently scratching Fang’s head. “A few of the younger years came up with the idea.”
They’re so near to one another that Draco feels Harry’s breath fan across his face and his eyes flutter when he moves forward to close the gap.
"No."
“We have a lead!”
“Damn, I thought I was right about that one. I was sure he was planning to kiss you senseless again.”
He’s tried ignoring Draco and every mention of him but it hasn’t helped him move on. He’s tried ignoring Draco at the wedding and it hasn’t worked. Their friends are growing tired of the divide between them anyway, would it be the worst thing to try and be civil?
“That simply isn’t true, my love.” She answers kindly. “Otherwise you’d be alone, like your father and I would be without each other and you. Draco,” her voice grows sterner when he opens his mouth. “I know what I’m talking about. So when I say I want you to use whatever benefit being Harry Potter’s friend gives you, I mean it. Not because I want you to use it selfishly, but because I know you’ll do good. Whatever leniency you get from being connected to him, whatever benefits, take them and use them in whatever way you think is best. Because you know what it’s worth better than anybody. You know the value forgiveness and kindness can have in someone’s life.”
He shoves his hips forward and they both gasp at the long-needed contact. Harry is so greedy for Draco that he grabs the man’s hand and pulls it down to give himself some friction.
“I certainly would have been happy with it.”
He’s never really felt anything like that since.
“Where’s the rest of them?” Ron frowns as the three of them fall into seats in the library.
He doesn’t feel like putting up with this guy anymore or being here at all really. He wonders if Harry and Ron are gone yet, or whether Ron’s stalling to stay like he usually does.
“Yes, that’s true.” She murmurs. It’s been a long time since Harry’s received that pitying look from Hermione and he can’t say he’s missed it, but before he can reassure her again that he’s fine she blinks and shakes her head a bit. “It’ll be interesting to see what the rest of the wizarding world is like now, won’t it?”
Harry bites the inside of his cheek briefly, trying not to let Blaise’s easy and unfazed demeanor bother him. “This is about me and Draco.”
,” Draco stresses before frowning in suspicion. “What do I
“Let me go, dammit-”
But Harry holds up a hand to stop him. “I know it does. With Romilda this morning, I know that’s what’s brought all this on. I know it upset you.”
“You have me.” Harry says meeting his eyes and still grinding his crotch into Draco’s hand. “Any way you want me, I’m yours. Just please, Draco.”
“You don’t like this anymore?” Harry asks before licking him again, slightly deeper this time and making Draco mewl.
Blaise raises an eyebrow at his wife behind Draco's back. "How-" he starts asking, wondering how she could possibly know that, but his wife just narrows her eyes, making him switch tactics. "How about you stay here tonight," he asks Draco, rubbing a comforting hand on his back. "And tomorrow, when we're all thinking straight and rested, we can help you figure out what to do."
He might be Harry realizes. Draco has no reason to ever believe he’ll be back here.
He hears a choking sound behind him before Potter coughs. “Um, Draco?”
“It’s not like you two are the first Gryffindors and Slytherins to date.” Hermione says. Pansy presses into Draco a little more. “Roger Smith and Kazi Childs from Sixth Year have been dating since the summer, after years of pining.”
“It’s a bit uncanny, isn’t it?” Luna ventures.
With Harry’s laughing face firmly in mind Draco repeats himself. “
Then Percy and his girlfriend Audrey arrive with George and Angelina and that is all of the immediate family. They gravitate towards the arch where there is more space to stand, everyone moving from person to person until the first of the real guests arrived.
Chapter title from TALK ME DOWN by Troye Sivan
"Oh, I think that's Luna. I'll just go and say hello, maybe ask her for a quick dance." Harry's standing up and talking before he's even aware of it, making both Zabinis turn to look at him.
“You know how many Muggles there are in the world, right? Witches and wizards in Britain know each other because there’s not that many of us, but there’s tons of muggles. Some don’t even know their own neighbours.”
At this point he’d thought it was too late to ask for the real story, especially when everyone was trying so hard to move on. It hadn’t stopped him being curious though.
“We’ll tell you all about our trip on the train,” Hermione says happily, brushing some of her hair out of her eyes. “My parents were so happy to see us, and-”
“Can we please start the games now?” Pansy interrupts. “Oi! Lovebirds!”
More than half of the remaining group groan again. Harry spots Ernie McMillan, who is dressed as a leprechaun, whisper to Hannah Abbot, who appears to be a Beauxbatons girl, and both of them grimace.
“Oh shut up,” Harry says laughingly, moving quickly to push Draco down on the bed and surprise him into being quiet. “You’re ridiculous.”
Neville flushes bright red while Ron coughs uncomfortably. Harry’s mouth twitches.
So he tilts his head up, watching as Harry’s eyes fall to his lips, feeling that familiar swell of want and hope and anticipation.
But her voice is still light when she asks, “who would that be again? I’m not as familiar with who holds which position since your father’s retirement.”
“It’s not my fault your brain can’t work at the same rate as the rest of ours.” Draco chews a quick bite of his sandwich. “I believe the blame for that would be placed on genetics.”
“Somehow I don’t think she was talking about us.” The blonde replies sarcastically, but he isn’t glaring anymore and glances towards the board, hand twitching towards the quill on his desk.
Strange. The fragile truce between them from sitting together in classes is very strange.
“-just saying you should talk to Kingsley if you’re interested, I’m sure we could get you working down with us.” Julius Chester is saying and Harry smiles politely even though the thought of working in the Department of Mysteries is the absolute last thing he wants and, frankly, a bit terrifying.
Which is a problem. Because friends, which Potter has evidently decided they are, do not have crushes on one another.
But by the time a few hours have passed the two of them are sitting side by side going through old photo albums. And Draco is completely at ease, so much so that when Harry excuses himself to go to the bathroom Draco just waves him away, attention almost completely focused on the nine-month-old beside him.
“We’ll be fine,” Draco says. “Take them. I can safely deliver Harry into his bed, I promise.”
liked his gift and Draco is proud. He is also happy that the secret is now out. Organizing the entire thing behind Harry’s back had been a nightmare, and finding the time to put the album together when nobody was around had been difficult, despite the Saturday the others had been away in Hogsmeade.
“I assume you weren’t intending to come back and get it all yourself,” Blaise continues. “What with the way you just left without a word and all.”
Draco doesn’t talk to him for fifteen minutes.
Ron shifts uncomfortably beside Draco and Harry feels a surge of frustration and a spark of anger.
The few people who hadn’t already got drinks get up to do so. Neville accepts his glass of water from Luna with a smile.
The time passes nicely. He and Draco don’t speak directly to one another, but there are enough buffers in the room- mainly Teddy, who provides a large distraction- that it goes unnoticed by everyone.
"Oh," Ron mutters just as Harry starts moving to stand.
“Why, developed a crush on the Chosen One, have you Blaise?”
She frowns in confusion.
Draco says nothing and Harry tenses in defense. “Are you?”
The cool air is refreshing and does more to wake and sober the three of them up than the water they’d drunk inside. He links arms with both Ron and Neville and
"Stopping for a show, were you? Do you have some obsession with finding me in the worst moments?"
“Personal?” Theo questions, looking too interested. “As in his cock in your mouth-”
“He said he turned down Romilda so I’m struggling to see what on earth you two could have managed to fight about.”
“You didn’t know him.” Harry says quietly. “You didn’t see- you don’t know what he was like. He might have been like that once, but he was a boy and he grew up and became better. He learned from his mistakes and didn’t repeat them.”
Draco gets there early because he’s anxious but he’s startled to find Harry waiting already. He must have come right away.
The old Slytherin smiles wryly, mind apparently following the same track as Harry’s. “I was going to ask you the same thing. But yes, I was planning on it.” He hesitates. “I hope that doesn’t mean you won’t.”
The younger students sitting a few feet away all immediately go quiet as Harry slides in to sit beside him. When Draco manages to look away from Harry he sees that not only the other Slytherins but the rest of the students and the few teachers at the Head Table are all watching them with stunned expressions.
Harry meets his eyes for a second before his gaze drops to Draco's throat, his eyes trailing up to his lips, and knows he can't risk starting something in a dare he won't want to finish. There’s still too much that’s new that he has to think through before beginning- or continuing- whatever is going on with him and Malfoy.
The bastard just… smiles. Brilliantly and widely, and he looks like everything Harry had been feeling one minute ago when his heart was so happy it felt like it would burst out of his chest from being so full. Because his emotions are a swell inside of him, they are a huge wave of pure joy, and human bodies aren’t able to hold this much happiness, are they? It can’t be possible for people to walk around feeling like this everyday without exploding or breaking into random fits of laughter because of the simple fact that it is all
(Even then Draco had known Harry was right. Voldemort was back. He’d confronted his parents about it and they hadn’t lied to him. They just hadn’t wanted him to be involved either. That had hurt him so much he’d spent Fifth Year trying to prove himself and begging for answers. After his father’s arrest at the Ministry suddenly he’d gotten his chance and realized it wasn’t anything like he’d wanted.)
They’re quiet for a bit, the implications of it all settling heavy between them.
“It’s not just First Years.” She confesses craftily. “Everyone seems to be talking about it. Why, even the ghosts mentioned it at their last party.”
Does Harry really want that? With Draco? Draco hadn’t been lying, he’s been fantasizing about it for a long time, even occasionally before this school year.
Draco stops, can’t help himself. "What?"
The look on Harry’s face is pain, it’s the only way Draco can describe it, and as their eyes hold he knows his is the same. His heart pounding is the only thing he can feel, and Harry is the only thing he sees in this tent full of people.
Draco raises an eyebrow while Harry looks curious. “What was that one?”
Finally he puts Teddy down and hugs the other adults. Harry just nods at him and gives a small smile before allowing Teddy to take his hand and lead him over to the floor of the sitting room in which they’ve set up.
they even be friends?
“Well we’ve done it before.” Ron says. “And besides George and Fred-” He stopped abruptly and Harry sees everyone in the room tense.
“I suppose.” He sinks down beside him, putting a hand on Harry’s knee. “I’d change it all if I could, you know. Even if it was only to make you feel better.”
“Don’t be stupid.”
“Hermione and I slept in the Astronomy Tower last night.” Ron says slowly and completely ignoring Hermione’s quelling look towards him. He’s squinting at the two of them while loading up his plate with bacon and eggs. “Wasn’t sure when Harry got back, though Neville said it was quite late.”
“So when did you stop? Hating me, I mean.”
“Draco.” She is so soft, eyes earnest. “You came home for Christmas in Fourth Year complaining endlessly about two things: Harry Potter going to the Yule Ball with one of the Patil twins and Viktor Krum not having enough time for you when you approached him for an autograph. Believe me, whatever your father and I had tried to convince ourselves before then we didn’t bother afterwards.”
He trails off and Draco tries not to show his confliction at the mention of their best friend. Though Pansy’s feelings for Blaise haven’t gone away, nobody except Draco knows that. And though Draco has told her more than once that she’s making a mistake by throwing her relationship with Theo in Blaise’s face in an attempt to get a rise out of him, she refuses to listen.
“What, really?” Blaise says before looking over at Neville who nods. “Well done mate, I’m honestly shocked.”
Showing up outside of the Manor’s gates is less than ideal, given that it’s raining steadier here than it had been outside of Ron and Hermione’s, but Harry pushes on nonetheless.
“So how should we do this?” Neville asks finally.
Draco blushes. “I know it’s ridiculous, alright? But I’d always gotten attention as a kid. Coming here and losing it was hard for me. Especially when in my eyes I had tried to be your friend and you rejected it before seeming to go out of your way to plaster your fame everywhere in school.”
Thanks for reading!
“Can I?” Draco whispers, looking back down to Harry. Their eyes meet with a grounding intensity that Harry hasn’t ever felt before. “Will it hurt if I touch it?”
He stretches languidly, content at the pop of his muscles, and then falls back against the mattress, the sheets smooth and warm against his bare skin. His smile must be goofy looking but he doesn’t care, he doesn’t care a bit, because last night had been amazing and Draco is happy and content to stay lost in the pleasure of it forever.
“Everyone, if you could find your seats.” Ron’s voice yells over the din. “Just to get organized before the ceremony, that would be great.”
“I suppose.” Draco pushes his chair away from his desk but doesn’t get up. “I just wish it was going faster. I feel spectacularly useless sitting here waiting for potions to reach their proper consistency or- or whiling away at possible side effects.” The blonde sighs again. “I don’t know how you do it, Potter. I can barely stand sitting here knowing there’s someone out there I could help to catch and knowing that at the moment I’m absolutely bloody useless. At least you go out and do something, I suppose, but even then there’s always more criminals to take their place.” Draco looks up to meet his eyes, catching Harry off guard at their beseeching look. “Honestly, isn’t it tiresome? Don’t you just get… sick of it?”
“Good.” Draco says as they maneuver their way to Harry’s front door.
Harry’s a bit relieved when Neville suggests they all split up to go and get their Secret Santa gifts if they haven’t already. Ron and Blaise take off together without hesitation and Harry smiles at Ginny, Hermione and Pansy as he leaves them at the
“Ron!”
“Definitely.” Harry murmurs, waving his hand and cleaning the space around them. “Just… give me a few minutes.”
“And if it does?” Harry challenges him, his eyes boring into Draco’s. “If it does come down to that? Me or your parents, acceptance or disinheritance, being yourself or living a lie? What would you do then Draco? What would you choose?”
“If you stop,” Harry cards a hand through Draco’s hair, mussing it up and noting his breathing grow more labored. “I’ll just finish myself.”
“I-” Draco’s eyes flick away quickly before coming back up to Harry’s. “Really? You would want me there?”
His mind is a haze and all he hears are his heartbeats until the sound of footsteps behind him make his nerves sing.
Blaise wants to take the words back immediately at the way Harry's blinking too fast. He wants to yell at Draco and reassure Harry and make them see that whatever Draco's doing, it won't work. It won't help either of them and now Blaise has two crumbling boys standing on opposite sides of a wall with their hearts broken.
“Oh, no, it’s okay.” Harry tries to say but she holds up a hand, making him stop midsentence.
Or not.
He doesn’t say anything but he does move back further so their sides are pressed together and she can lean on him ever so slightly. Her resting her head on his shoulder isn’t out of the ordinary, they’ve casually sat in far closer positions before.
“Oh dear,” Andromeda blinks in what Harry guesses is surprise. “Please, call me Andromeda.”
“Mental.” Ron says. “Bloody mental. No offense, mate.”
“Oh.” Harry blinks in a mixture of surprise and relief. He’d really been getting nervous there and this- well this was honestly the last thing he’d been expecting her to say after her acting so mysterious. The brief thought that something may have happened to Molly or Arthur or one of the brothers had even occurred to him. “Erm. Okay?”
Except he does. A lot.
Still Draco doesn’t entirely like what his mother is saying.
“Do you miss him?” Harry asks thinking of Crabbe.
Nearly 20 minutes later Harry is sitting behind his desk fiddling with a rubber ball (not at all stewing in anger, thank you) when the knock comes on his door.
Harry blinks, never having heard that expression before.
Harry meets Luna's eyes after glancing at Ron and Hermione uncomfortably. Hermione gives him a helpless look back.
When he turns around a minute later it is with his towel wrapped around his waist. He is spared the need to hyperventilate by the fact that Potter has one on now as well. “Yeah?”
Draco will hate himself more than anything else in the world. In fact, he thinks he already does.
The fact that he can’t sleep more than 2 hours straight might not be helping. He's started reading in bed at night, Merlin help him.
“I’ve missed this,” Harry says with a wicked grin and he feels Draco shiver beneath him.
That seems to snap Harry out of whatever haze he’s in because his eyes land on Draco’s still hard cock, red and weeping, and understanding dawns on his face. Without giving Draco a moment to think Harry is bending down and sucking him in, mouth working more enthusiastically than Draco can ever remember.
“Draco.”
Parvati and Padma giggle.
Draco ignores the words but he does look over. “How do you sleep? At the Weasley’s?”
And now he’s been wondering all morning just how to ask Draco. Should he do it casually? Should he make a joke about how he doesn’t want to go but that he’s doing it for Luna?
“Oh, is that what they’re calling it these days.” Draco grins slyly and Harry grins back.
“Blaise.”
Harry can’t deny the fact that this animosity with him and Malfoy is familiar, almost welcome. "Go sit with the people who will actually tolerate you if you feel like being a right tosser."
“Really?” Her eyes shine.
Draco’s studying in the library when Harry plops down into the seat beside him and makes him jump and let out a curse. Both of them instinctively look over anxiously, worried about Madame Pince appearing to scold them as she likes to do, but a few seconds pass in silence and they relax.
“Stop.” He interrupts the two women. “We’ll find out who it is and I’d like to talk to them. Then we can decide whether to tell the Ministry about it.”
“Draco, hey,” Harry grabs his hand and forces them to face one another. Draco half-heartedly tries to avoid his eyes for all of two seconds before giving in. “I told her no. There’s nothing to be upset over.”
Draco shrugs. “It’s a little funny.”
Draco understands immediately and shoots Hermione a slightly betrayed look. “You two aren’t subtle.”
“Who’s following our example?” Harry asks her in surprise.
“Hermione looked up mine once,” Harry says eventually. “Guess what it means?”
"Honestly Draco I’m terrified too.”
Harry bites his cheek and looks away. “Well… now that you mention it, maybe that’s all it is.”
. Seamus and Dean are taking a year off to travel before the pair of them train and join the
Unlike Harry she is fully dressed in light blue robes edged with white. Her hair is down and loose around her shoulders. She has more grey strands at her temples than Harry remembers.
Eventually he’s able to leave the stage and everyone crowds around him, giving more hugs and congratulations. He’s being passed around from person to person and soon drinks are flowing and his mum is leaving to go to bed and his award is being shown off to anybody kind enough to feign interest.
“There.”
He breathes deeply, trying to stave off panic. It’s time to think logically. Time to come up with a plan and reason everything out and to stop
He has just swung open the Fat Lady’s portrait when he stops in his tracks and blinks in surprise at the sight of Draco doing the same only feet away, the blonde’s mouth hurriedly snapping shut after saying the password.
He’s so in love with this man. His entire body hurts from not being able to say it.
“Thank you, Neville.” Draco replies, leaning slightly against Harry.
Again she’d searched him, but whatever she saw, maybe the disappointment that Draco was sure seeped through to his expression even though he tried to push it away, or maybe just honesty, it had been enough to make her believe him.
Draco refuses to examine it any further here, lying on the grass of the hill outside Hagrid’s hut, surrounded by all of their friends. But at least he knows if anyone else does end up finding out about him and Harry it might not be a big deal, if Blaise and Ginny’s reveal is anything to go by.
When they walk into the living room the conversation between Andromeda and Narcissa stops almost immediately.
Harry doesn’t blush, to Draco’s disappointment. “Yeah, I- noticed, I guess.”
“It makes me think I probably should have too. Over the years.” Harry looks unhappy as they pass the younger year students to make their way to Draco’s dorm. “Does she really think we used her for information all this time?”
As soon as Harry catches sight of him his face goes blank and he makes to turn around, but Ron grips his arm and doesn’t let go, even though it means he practically has to pull Harry along to join them. Hermione paces a bit, making Draco shoot her a glare, to which she shoots him a quick smile.
For a moment Pansy meets Draco’s eyes and gives a fondly exasperated eyeroll. Draco notes it but he’s already looking away to catch Harry’s gaze as the other boy stares at him.
“Right.” Harry agrees easily. “Has it been five minutes yet? I know we promised them time before starting to search but I’d like to start playing.”
Harry stares helplessly before glancing at Ron to see him nodding.
“It is,” she answers. “Go, do your thing. I’ll find Millie and Harry.”
-and maybe it’s selfish, but it’s come to the point where that’s what he needs. Because earlier with Romilda has shaken him, it’s made him re-evaluate everything, and he doesn’t think he can keep doing this. He’s not ready to tell the world, not yet, but maybe, maybe, Draco should finally tell his parents. And then he and Harry could tell their friends.
"Potter?" Draco stands up straight and turns to meet his eyes, arms crossed. "Nothing. I-he- that was nothing."
“Harry-”
“The rings?” Charlie’s voice breaks through the silence in his mind and Draco turns to look at the people in front of him. Blaise and Ginny are looking at him expectantly.
So. Draco thinks to himself, stripping down in the Quidditch dressing room, feeling the steam from the shower drift towards him, that means there is a problem. He has a problem.
- what are we
Harry doesn’t take long, but when he returns he sees Andromeda has joined Draco on the floor with Teddy. The three of them don’t notice his reappearance, but Narcissa does, and Harry watches as she decides to get up and come over to stand in the doorway with him and observe her family.
With a thought he’s off, zooming through the air, eyes focused on that one spot. He hears Draco yell, feels air disturbed just behind him as the blonde catches up to trail him, but Harry smiles victoriously as his hand reaches out, open and ready-
Harry tries not to let the hurt show on his face. “Why are you still lying?”
He had learned to block them out when he was out in the wizarding world, at least as best he could. In Diagon Alley or at the Ministry he'd just walked away from the stares and hushed voices. But at Hogwarts there are only so many places he can go.
Ron splutters. "Excuse me?" He asks his girlfriend. "That's it? It's Harry and Ginny!"
He misses all of them, but he can’t lie to himself and pretend that not talking to Harry doesn’t bother him most.
“I don’t feel like spending a night with know-it-all Ravenclaws, snivelling Hufflepuffs and idiot Gryffindors.” Draco said. “No.”
Malfoy had straightened his robes, and as he did Harry saw most of the tension and frustration leak out slowly as he relaxed a bit. It made Harry relax too.
Eventually Hermione has somehow ended up in a chair beside him and they’re talking quietly.
“Ah, yes, the holidays are filled with so many difficult memories for being such a happy time. My family is buried at Godric’s Hollow as well, you know.”
He stops, not sure what to say. "Draco told me he didn't love me anymore." He says. "When I went to see him tonight."
Perhaps he’s already on the train.
“I’d like you to.”
“Well then. Are you going to tell the others?”
“I will.” Blaise says and Ginny leaves with a wave to them all seconds before Luna and Neville do the same.
“Pansy-” He starts in a whisper but she whips her head around to glare at him and he immediately closes his mouth.
Because this is a miracle. No matter what else happens tonight, he will be happy, because his best friends are talking to Draco and Draco is actually talking back, and none of them are trying to kill each other.
He looks at her pleadingly. "Help me. You're one of his best friends, you've known him for years. Tell me what to do."
Harry reels back.
“But you took Parvati to the Yule Ball.” He murmurs.
When it’s obvious that Harry isn’t buying a bit of it he sighs and goes for a half-truth. “I just can’t believe the year is done. Everyone will be leaving soon. Going their own way.”
Harry snorts. “We’ve kissed for Christ’s sake, they’re a little behind in new developments.”
Draco flinches. “Like I said, there was a few reasons.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “I know that. But we’re here anyway and honestly, what sort of friend would I be if I let you come to the next party with no preparation?”
They sit quietly for a few seconds before Ginny turns to him. "I told you he was coming. You saw him at Blaise’s stag do. Was it really such a shock to see him again?"
The Room seems larger all of a sudden, with all this space between them.
He will never forget his father’s stress at home or joining Umbridge’s Inquisition Squad for the extra credit and the excuse to catch Harry and see what he and his friends had been up to. He has memories of crying when his father was taken to prison and blaming Potter for it. Of desperately trying to hide from him in Sixth Year and wishing he would show up during Seventh and just end things, one way or another. Draco will always know what it was like seeing Hagrid carrying Harry’s limp form and feeling like his stomach had dropped out of his body as he realized that was it, the life Draco had known was over and whatever hope he’d had left was gone.
“Ah, but that’s what wars do, ain’t it? Horrible things, I know, but they do have a way o’ bringin’ people together after. But you’ll both know better than I do at this rate. Oh,” he stands back up, “That’s the tea done, just a mo’.”
Draco blinks. “Really?”
Following that there is a moment on a train, with an offered hand and an answer that comes in the form of a rejection of friendship.
“Yeah.” He swallows. “I know exactly what you mean.”
“I haven’t known you for three years.”
"Jealous are you?" He bites out before he can help himself.
Ron raises an eyebrow. “Strapping a wand belt on does not equal a costume.”
“Why in hell would you think that?” Ron demands.
“With- darling, you’ve completely lost me. I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Okay,” he says simply and Draco actually smiles at him in relief before hesitantly coming in to Harry’s office and sitting in one of the two chairs across from his desk, shutting the door quietly behind him.
“So. You two huh?” He’s back to looking between them both closely, taking in their every expression.
“Yeah, but since she and Nott are fucking anyway there’s no need for chastity between them apparently.” Millie rolls her eyes. “Or attempts to spare us from having to see it.”
“Mmm,” he hums in agreement.
The knowledge doesn’t ease his nerves. His palms sweat and he surreptitiously puts them behind his back to wipe on his robes.
“He went to find you, when you were dancing.” Blaise looks up at him, looking soberer than he really is. Or at least more with it than what Draco had assumed. “And then he came back and said he was leaving. What happened?”
Ron actually lets out a breath. “Thank Merlin.”
“You were taking a long time.” Harry complains, but he looks slightly nervous. “And if we’re talking about my comfort tactics then we’re talking about yours too. Leaving me alone in your bed to work myself up further is also a really bad move.”
Draco knows it had been Peter who had betrayed the location of James and Lily Potter’s safe house and he knows he had been a close friend of the Potters’. His father had said on more than one occasion how spineless Wormtail was.
He’d seemed so scared Harry was angry with him. Too scared.
Harry looks sheepish. “I’ve been in here loads of times since the Battle. Rebuilding Hogwarts, visiting McGonagall, you know. Snape’s a sullen old git most of the time but Dumbledore usually talks away.”
“Fuck yes.” Draco replies but it doesn’t stop him from sighing when Harry slips first one and then two fingers in. Draco pushes back against him a bit. “More, Potter, I don’t remember you being a bloody tease.”
There’s an anticipatory silence until Potter breaks it by clearing his throat and glancing up again before looking back down at the textbook. “So. Cars.”
“On whether you’d get back together,” Ron says. “Assuming that you’d dated back in school.”
He doesn’t point out that this would be their first time doing something that seems like a real date. Spending time together at parties surrounded by their friends or studying in the Common Rooms and library was different. Even the nights they’ve spent together these last few days can’t really be classified as dates.
“Of course.” He agrees and goes to do as asked, answering all of Arthur’s questions on autopilot and listening to the others come inside from wherever they’d been, voices loud and laughter echoing.
"I don't mean things are awful, because they're not. And I do love you, you know I do, just like I know you love me. But we're not- we're not in love with each other, are we? We just like similar things, and it's easy between us but we don't- I mean with Dean, we would fight and then make up, but the two of us- we just don't fight. Ever. We always get along."
“Now, Pansy.”
“Alright then just listen to me. Please.” Harry meets his eyes seriously.
“Mad? Not at all. Disgusting yes, and partially disgusted with us because the things we did last night are not meant to be spoken about in the light of day. But mad?” Draco’s face softens further. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have teased. No, I’m not mad. The truth is…” He stops, obviously considering whether he should go on. “I can’t remember ever being so happy. I didn’t think it was possible.”
“A bottle of Ogden’s finest, please.” Draco says just loud enough to be heard and glances at Harry as he’s fishing out to money to pay. “Thank you.”
“I don’t know.” Harry replies, still at a bit of a loss. “I didn’t have a chance to think of it before you mentioned it. Now I guess I’ll think so because you said.”
“Alright.” He says, shooting Draco a quelling look when the blonde opens his mouth. “You’ve all picked already?”
But Harry shakes his head. “No, I wasn’t going to.”
Harry unlocks it immediately and meets Theo’s stare the easiest. “Um, had a bit of an emergency.”
Draco being able to work from home has been a blessing, especially after Lily came along, and Harry knows they have it easier than most. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t miss his family being together like crazy.
Harry blinks and Hermione beams. “Oh, Draco, that was very good of you.”
They keep watching him, obviously waiting for more, before Nott lets out a disbelieving laugh. "Good at Muggle Studies? Draco, what-"
Dear Merlin...
Hermione’s eyes are sharp. “Are you
“There you two are!” She trills and Draco immediately shoots Blaise a bracing look. “I was wondering when you’d show up, what do you think of the décor? It’s alright isn’t it? Ginny seems happy enough, but it’s not just her day, of course, it’s yours too Blaise, and if there’s anything you want changed or rearranged just say the word.”
“You did your sentence.” She says stiffly. “I am still doing mine and your father-”
“It is not!” His best friend splutters. Her hair is up in a ponytail and she is already wearing a brand new sweater from Molly. “Can’t I just be happy Harry’s here?”
"Draco, why are you doing this? It doesn't make any sense."
Draco slips an arm around him immediately, pulling them even tighter together and moving in short, sharp thrusts within Harry. Every twitch nudges Harrys prostate and soon the sounds coming out of his mouth are completely incoherent and the arm against the wall falls so his fingers link with Draco’s.
“Right.” Draco hurries on. “There was also- well I was worried about what the public would say to us. The papers were already crucifying us being together, and they only thought we were friends. And of how serious we were so fast. I couldn’t believe that we wouldn’t end in a disaster because when I’m happy there’s always something that pulls the rug out from under me. Then there was Ron and Hermione and what they might have thought.”
-but no. They are in the Great Hall surrounded by other students and staff and when Harry hears Ginny’s shriek of laughter from where she’s sitting farther down the table with Luna he jolts in surprise and tries to clear his head.
Just as Harry is wracking his brains and opening his mouth to say something, anything, to break the heavy silence, Narcissa does it for him.
“I love you too.” Harry says when they part again, green eyes dark but earnest.
The bitterness Harry feels is forcefully pushed aside. “That’s really nice, Draco.” He hesitates. “Look, you know I’ll never love your dad, but I am sorry you won’t get that this year. Honestly.”
She nods, watching him closely. “Complete forgeries.”
“We’re the ones who bloody encouraged them all to spend time together, I suppose it’s only fair we reap what we sow.”
“None of this is coming out right.” Ginny makes a frustrated sound while closing her eyes and rubbing her forehead. “Harry, your deepest, darkest thoughts, your worst fears, what are they?”
Kingsley looks at him and Harry's face flames, realizing he's spoken the sentence out loud.
“He as good as.” Ron snarls. “Letting Voldemort hide in his home, fighting against us in the Battle. But no, you’re happy to let him fucking get away with it.”
Draco follows quietly, looking down at the ground and Harry can’t help his brilliant grin, smiling at everyone they pass and getting confused and tentative looks and smiles in reply.
She bites her lip. “That I’d think about it?”
“Would you want to?”
“I didn’t know you read the
The blood drains from Draco’s face.
“Ron’s coming to mine for the first few days.” Hermione says to answer Theo. “And then we’re going to his after lunch on Christmas and staying the rest of the time there. Harry’s meeting us before dinner at the Burrow as well.”
on your approval.”
“Potter.”
Blaise shakes his head as if the inquiry is a stupid one. “Obviously I did.” Draco’s friend hesitates. “But I know- you and Harry-”
Now it’s him who is relieved and he grins. “Hope I’m not the only one who can prove them wrong.”
Her eyes widen, but only a bit. “Is he okay?”
“It’s a good costume, Ron, don’t worry. They’ll laugh.” Hermione says.
Harry’s mouth quirks. “Is this your apology then?”
So he buries it, or at least tries, and turns his mind to Draco’s question.
people.
“Pansy.” The anger had been gone from his voice, replaced only with a tired pleading. Draco hadn’t even had the semblance of self to be embarrassed, he’d only wanted her questions to stop. “Please. Drop it.”
Minutes tick by, the only sign of it the sound of the sand hitting the bottom of an hourglass and Draco feels suffocated.
It doesn’t stop her from reacting to Draco’s presence with clear dislike however, so he’s studiously looking at his Muggle Studies textbook, trying to take in the words on the page and hoping she doesn’t stop by him.
He hadn’t left though. Instead he and Harry had drawn the curtains and lain across the mattress and spent the next few hours talking quietly.
things,” Malfoy spat, faltering only a bit. “You should understand that better than anybody. And not everyone in the wizarding world can- can turn a blind eye or sweep it under the rug like you. Whatever it is that’s made me repulse you any less this year, it hasn’t
He’s proud of Draco for everything that’s happened to him this year. And he’s still a bit blown away by the thanks he got in Draco’s speech when he’d accepted his Lifetime Potions Achievement Award. To say he hadn’t been expecting anything like that would be the biggest understatement since Ron had told him the Chudley’s probably didn’t have a chance at the Quidditch Cup this year.
“I mean why isn’t he telling Vane where she can shove it?”
“Harry wouldn’t expect us to wait for him all day. I was just having a bit to tide me over until we started.”
“Forget that for a bit.” Harry says, obviously feeling the same way. “What about us? Won’t we… I don’t know, tell people about us eventually? Not now, sure, but…”
“It’s a day of Remembrance to those who died in war.” Harry says finally. “November 11th. I suppose we can just use it to remember the people who died in our wars.”
It takes a second for the words to register with Harry apparently because then he’s smiling. “No, I guess not. Doesn’t really seem in character for you.”
“Not at all. If I haven’t made it clear just how demanding I am in bed yet you’ll learn tonight. As soon as I think you’re enjoying it more than me I’m letting you know.”
But having Draco with him makes it all seem so surreal that Harry barely believes it’s all actually happening.
