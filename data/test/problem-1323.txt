, when it came to gifts, it was more about the care behind them. The people he loved best showing him they love him too, they think of him, know him, know what would bring him pleasure. Harry was a sponge for it, soaking it up until he was full to the brim with it.
Ginny exhaled and dropped her chin onto one hand, elbow propped on the table. Her other hand was doing vaguely rude things to the handle of her knife. “Good choice, fantastic backside presentation. What else?”
“You had a whole plate of your own back on your side of the table,” Harry said, a little breathlessly. Draco’s lips twitched.
this, then Draco was going to go back upstairs to his room and wallow in his misery again. He moved quickly, collecting glasses and knives, scraping the plates, filling the sink with dirty dishes until all the table was cleared, and he could set the dishwashing charm Potter had taught him in motion to fill the sink with water and suds, and start the scrubbers and scourers rising to take on the mess.
His fingers slid through the soap at his neck, and thoughts of Malfoy drifted slowly forward. Malfoy’s lips on Harry’s throat, his thumbs stroking gently against Harry’s hip bones. He was hard again, and sensible enough not to bother resisting the blossoming fantasy of Malfoy pressed up behind him, mouthing at his neck and nipping his earlobe with sharp little bites.
“Hey, Big Man,” Draco felt the world's most daft smile split his face, and he jogged the last few steps and scooped Ted up and swung him over his shoulder. Teddy shrieked with laughter. “Who let this sack of potatoes wear my cousin’s uniform?” Draco said loudly, in his most pompous voice. “I demand answers!”
“Something tells me you’re feeling a lot better,” Potter said, leaning close to Draco’s ear. “How’s the shoulder?”
His stomach churned, and he let Potter lead the way, protect him, lead him out of the den of wolfish press and away.
He tipped the box over, and everything tumbled out onto his newly made bed. Christ and Hades, Malfoy meant for him to use these on himself, he selected these specific items and brought them with him to the club to give them to Harry - fuck, the club, the jacket. First thing first.
It was a short walk from the park to Grimmauld Place, even shorter at a near jog. The temperature outdoors did nothing to clear his head, and Harry let himself in his front door still feeling sticky, and hot, and a little bit tipsy. Wall sconces blinked alight along the hall, softly yellow and moody, and he ascended the stairs, two at a time. By the time Harry stepped through his bedroom door, he was just about ready to crawl out of his skin.
“You don’t really have to do that, you know. I’m happy. Really happy, actually. That was just a silly tantrum, before. Besides, I want to earn it. I don’t like having things just handed to me.”
Harry realised he’d said that last bit out loud, and cleared his throat. “Yes, Malfoy, but there are other variables to consider. Do we start with the vagina or anus, do we use lube, do we test the original dildo only or also some from the bushes, do we use the King Dong as a control - it’s not just a matter of sticking it in and thrusting it around.”
The third week, Ron brought a deck of cards, and they tried to teach Malfoy and Pereira how to play Oh Hell, which Ron promised would be much easier than Five Hundred. It was not. Harry had rarely laughed so much.
Draco felt both brows climbing. That was as much as confirming he was an Unspeakable, then. “You seem to know all about it.”
“I found a seafood pick. Oh! I forgot about these,” Draco lifted the lid of a large wooden crate brimming with what Harry now recognised as
Sleeping with Potter had been a mistake. The box was breaking, maybe it was already broken, but he couldn’t live feeling like this. It felt like dying. And Draco was a coward, after all.
Two hours later found Harry nudging open the glass doors of Blaise Zabini’s offices with his hip, two take away coffee cups in a caddy in one hand, and several shopping bags in the unmistakable purple of Liberty of London in the other.
He swallowed and let his eyes wander over the men and women pressing around them. “Her. I like her long hair.” She reminded him a bit of Ginny, completely lost in the music, her eyes closed as she danced. “I like her legs. They look - strong.”
“Potter, why in Merlin’s name is it so loud? Is he actually amplifying it? Is this some sort of power play?” Malfoy narrowed his eyes and glared at the wall through which the sound of pissing was
, maybe Luna or someone equally distracting, because if this went on much longer he’d do something bloody stupid. “To answer your question, yes, it’ll all be fine. It’ll last until at least Sunday, unless I end the charms, or extend them.” He looked at Harry, just smiling. “I think we’re probably done with the decorating. Are you ready to eat?”
“As long as you’re not into goblin porn mate, I think we can accept almost anything.” Ron’s grin fell slightly. “It’s
"Why would you bother? There's little point to it. If the Ministry were reasonable, I'd never have been convicted. I lied for you, for fucks sake! I lost my whole family, I lost my home, I lost every solid reminder of my past. All I have left are my memories and two blocks of marble with my parents' names on them. If the Ministry couldn't appreciate that at trial, what the hell good do you think you're going to do."
“Yes, well. Your farts are pretty vulgar. They’re not a body part, fortunately, so talking about them a bit less than usual is perfectly acceptable.”
“I have an idea.” Draco almost always had an idea. It’s what had made him a brilliant Auror. It made him a pretty brilliant fiance, too. “Sinistra taught me a spell that archivists use. I think it would probably work in here, given the content...we can sort it all into categories, and by date order, and then get it boxed up and into the attic, and then down the track we can work through a box at a time.”
“I’m wet through,” Draco said eventually, their kisses slow and lingering. Being late seemed a trivial concern when they could be doing this. They should quit their jobs to do this all day, every day. They were both richer than god, why shouldn’t they?
He wobbled, and Draco held him tighter by the knees. “You did very well out there. Everyone’s very proud of you. Mother even wore the special scarf. At the rate you’re going, you’ll be on your House team in first year.”
Harry was pretty sure it wasn’t especially healthy to have the voice of his best friend lecturing him inside his head on a semi-regular basis either, but he wouldn't be pulling on that thread today, either.
Draco was to stay with Potter for awhile. He had no place else to go, no family left, no home for him at Hogwarts anymore. With the exception of the elf he employed, Potter lived alone and had plenty of space for guests. Draco arrived at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place at tea time the following Monday. His luggage, the small amount that he had, was shrunken and kept in his left trouser pocket.
Potter still had his hands raised in surrender. “Don’t shoot, Malfoy! How about you put the wand down, and listen to my side of the story for a minute?” Draco looked at his right hand, and found with some surprise that it was clenched in a fist around his wand in a distinctly threatening fashion. He set the wand down on the blotter, while Potter nodded at him encouragingly. “Good. Okay. Well, for a start, the Auror’s already have a king, and he comes with his own nifty little song, which I would have thought you would have remembered rather well from school.” Draco simply stared at Potter until he continued. “Okay,” he repeated. “Not my best joke, I’ll wear that. But Malfoy, what’s the real problem, here? Is it that you don’t like sharing the power? I didn’t come here to overthrow you, or to annoy you, as much as you may like to believe I did. Magical Games and Sport just seemed like a natural choice for someone like me.”
“Fuck. Fucking fuck.” He would have to eat his breakfast now, rather than at 11, and depending on how long this took, he might have to scale back the bath to a maximum of thirty minutes. He’d need a hangover potion, since there was no chance of a lie-in anymore, and there was no doubt in his mind that he’d arrive in Spetses dehydrated and cranky, which was not how he wanted to start his holiday. His plan for dinner in a taverna by the quay where he would hopefully catch the eye of a sexy Athenian and be whisked onto a superyacht to be thoroughly rumpled would probably also need postponing.
“Okay. I’m really sorry Malfoy. You know I wouldn't have brought you in if I could’ve avoided it. This is just a big problem, and we needed our best on it. I’ve got everyone else on detail trying to keep the peace, but I need you with Harry to track down whoever’s taken off with the owls, and get them back before something really bad happens. You’re the only one I’d trust with this.”
Malfoy wasn’t exaggerating about the crowd. As they sat there, their bottle rapidly draining between them, Harry watched the patrons pouring in like a sweaty, heaving wave. It was packed, the horde three deep, or worse, all along the sprawling bar, and the dance floor was a wall of barely clothed bodies and cheap perfume. He rolled the last, thick mouthful of mead around on his tongue. He’d become used to the kick, now, and the bottle had not been large, but the mead was potent and Harry couldn’t describe himself as sober just at the moment. They’d drunk rather a lot in a short span.
Harry took another sip of the mead to fortify him, and coughed for nearly a full minute. Malfoy waited.
Potter laughed this time, full-throated, head tipped back. Draco allowed himself a moment of naked greed, and filled himself on Potter’s long legs, thick thighs, cocked hips.
Fifteen pairs of bulbous elf eyes looked at Draco in alarm, as he slammed the door open hard enough to cause the hinges to creak ominously. Draco wondered whether there was a polite way of demanding they all get out without actually scaring an elf to death. The laundry room was steamy with fresh washing, round wooden tubs slopping over with soapy water as towels were scrubbed, and churned by invisible hands before being pushed through an enormous wringer, and dozens of clean towels were strung on washing lines which criss-crossed the ceiling, with more fluttering upwards every moment to peg themselves cheerfully to the line.
“Mmmhmm,” Harry followed Malfoy’s hands as they pressed the toy’s buttocks apart with one hand, and the fingers of the other slid smoothly into the gleaming rubber arsehole. A cursory three pumps of his fingers, and Malfoy retreated again, returning with the dildo.
Malfoy squeezed him, gently. “So what I’m hearing is, casual sex is not for you. You want to be intimate with someone who knows you.”
Draco cast the charms to tie the laces on his oxfords as he took the stairs as quickly as possible, his shirt flapping open around his chest.
“Fuck no,” he said with feeling. She snorted, and rummaged around in a picnic basket between her feet.
Potter blinked at him, and put the glasses down on the coffee table on top of a newspaper. “An iPhone. They’re new. You still don’t have a mobile, do you?”
Harry turned to Ron, as if to say ‘are you hearing this’? “I don’t have a warrant card - I’m not a fucking
"Then tell me, why am I here? Why the hell am I being forced into manual labour, allowed my magic only when my life may be threatened by my work? Why am I confined to the school grounds, chaperoned at all times, why was my apparition license taken away, why is it illegal for me to get within forty feet of the castle? Where is my Order of Merlin, my parade, my fucking statue in the Ministry of Magic? Why am I being punished?"
“Don’t go yet!” Harry hastily picked some left-over bits of Cumberland sausage from the pan he’d used for dinner, and quickly filled a scrap of parchment with as many ink kisses as he could manage. “I know it’s a bit late, but if you wouldn’t mind?” The owl let him tie on the note, and took off via the kitchen window.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you, Potter, are you an Orthodox Slob, or do you just observe the major feast days?”
Teddy had been fascinated by Draco’s story about the plankton, and after lunch, with his mother and aunt pouring tea in the sitting room, he squeezed his legs under the kid-sized study desk in the corner where a Muggle computer was set up, and helped Ted spell ‘bioluminescent’, while Ted used the internet like an expert.
“Did something happen with Malfoy, Harry?” Ron put his cards down carefully on the table, and said, looking pleased, “Six hearts.”
“Thank you, Potter.” Draco brushed away the crumbs on Potter’s front with quick, efficient swipes of his hanky. Potter’s hand slid down Draco’s arm to clasp loosely around his wrist. His fingers were warm on Draco’s skin. He shivered anyway.
Harry shrugged. “I’d make toast. I’d get a toaster as similar to the cursed one as I could find, identical if I could manage it, and I’d make some toast in both toasters and see what happened. Compare them. Observe the behaviour of the cursed toaster, how hot the flames were, and how high, and what exactly was happening magically at the moment the flames burst out of the slots. Are the flames intended to harm the user or just frighten them, or was it a misguided attempt at improving the performance of the toaster? And once I had that figured out, I’d take the thing apart and extract the magical signature, and then I’d use that to track the culprit down.”
At the sound of his name, spoken by Potter, his vision clarified. His hearing came back to him and he finally focused on the person speaking to him. Yes, Potter. He took a gasping breath, suddenly feeling as if he hadn't been breathing deeply enough for all the long hours they'd been here, at the Wizengamot. His mouth worked for a moment without sound, before he managed a dry whisper which cracked in the middle.
“So, you don’t think the point is just to embarrass the Chief Warlock? Revenge or something, something political?”
Unfortunately, Harry’s natural rhythm for this seemed determined to be ‘heart palpitations and almost falling on your head’.
“Mmmf. So good. This whole thing has been good, Malfoy, amazing actually. I’d never realised what goes into organising something like this from behind the scenes.” Potter put his hand on Draco’s shoulder again, and his stomach swooped. “I didn’t mean it to sound insulting before – I just meant, well, you’re really good at this stuff.”
“Mmm, but you’re not just colleagues, Malfoy. You’re former rivals that were obsessed with each other, and friends in that weird, competitive, hypermasculine way, and co-godparents, and also fucking each other on a regular basis.” She leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees. “Did I miss anything?”
"I know that! The Order knows it, we all know it! You sacrificed more than most, and you fought relentlessly. We couldn't have done it without you-"
“Very good, Harry. Is that what you like? A hard cock in your mouth, and a couple of digits sliding into your tight hole? You want to straddle his face while yours is pressed in his lap?”
There were no other customers in the shop, as far as Harry could tell, anyway. He approached an aisle and lifted the edge of a box which declared it contained a Frolicking Feather. Harry’s eyebrows climbed towards his hairline. “It does
Harry marched to the bathroom, the usual enjoyment of being able to do so stark bollocking naked significantly reduced in his post-mastabatory shame. Did his cock normally wobble about so much? He’d never noticed before, but it seemed like a thing completely out of his control, and this morning he could swear he could feel his arse jiggle with every step. Christ and Hades, was this how it was going to be from now on? Hyper-awareness of his nether regions at all times? He cupped himself self consciously. Why hadn’t he put on pants, if he was going to open the bedroom window? What if someone on the road had seen him in all his glory, one of his neighbours? Harry knew that was absolutely irrational, especially considering the house was bloody well Unplottable. He still didn’t move his hand until he had the bathroom door shut firmly behind him, though.
“No,” Harry said without hesitation. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned from Hermione and Luna, it’s that therapy is for everyone, and we should make it part of our life, like regular medical check ups, and the dentist and all of that.”
“And then you sent me home,” Draco hissed. “Like an inconvenience. Maybe I was sick of just being used like something hard you could rub your cock on once a week, Potter.”
“No!” Harry blurted. “You could never be - I’d love to have you. Over.” Sometimes Malfoy smiled at him in a certain way, and it made Harry feel like he’d just done something very special, very clever. Even when Harry had just done something quite obviously stupid, like say ‘I’d love to have you’ and then forgetting to say ‘over’ until the pause between the words was a bit too long to excuse.
“Hard, too, I expect,” Potter murmured, and even Potter couldn’t keep the smirk away for that one. “I’ll see you at three sharp.” Potter walked away, whistling softly, and Draco glared around the corridor at the various gawking members of staff who seemed to magically have found business there, including Morgan, who was holding an Extendable Ear, and looking guilty.
Harry flipped him the rod. “Arse. Your birthday. What are you doing here, with me, eating crisps-” Malfoy snatched another handful, and Harry swatted him away, “-that you don’t even
Reaching out hesitantly for the dong, Harry had the wild thought that he should have locked and warded the office door
Draco could probably list every time Potter had found his way to the seat by Draco’s side, and put his hand high on Draco’s thigh under the table.
Harry rubbed a hand across his face, shoving his glasses up onto his forehead. “Circe’s tits, Malfoy.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath, smelled Malfoy in the thick air. “Other than nervous? I felt...a bit sexy, I guess.”
all the time, and Harry had long ago come to terms with the various repressed infatuations of his school days, of which Malfoy was certainly one. He just needed to break this inadvisably long sexual drought, and quickly, and then all this sweating and stammering and straining against his pants would settle down. Really, it was just his long dormant libido coming out of hibernation, forced out by all the focus Harry’d needed to have on dicks lately. That’s all it was. He took another deep breath, and then looked up from the clipboard feeling more composed already. This would be fine. Nothing to it.
Draco sighed. “When are you going to trust that I’m still going to love you despite your weirdness? You do a lot of weird shit, Harry, not just the hoarding. Are you aware that you’re incapable of putting on a pair of slippers, left-foot first?”
Draco stared at him. “Finnegan? What does Finnegan have to do with what I’m wearing?” Was everyone fucking insane?
“I told you it’d be a mistake.” Pansy sounded tired. Weary of his shit, probably. Draco could empathise. He was pretty fucking sick of his shit as well.
“And the wand. Yeah. So, it's not just about me and what I can move on from. There’s a lot of horrible shit that went down between his family and ours, and if any of you, any of you at all,” and here he meant all the Weasley’s, his family. “If it would hurt any of you, I wouldn’t go any further. I’d never call him again.”
Ron leaned into their office at nearly the same moment. “Gents, Robards wants all hands down in the briefing room in two - shit’s kicked off with that organised crime case, another gang members body just showed up with signs of an execution-style killing.” He looked at Malfoy. “Nice flower.”
Weasley squeezed his shoulder once and then pushed off. “You deserve it. Have good holiday, Draco. Oh, almost forgot.” He fished something small and grey from the pocket of his robes. “Reqs have sent up your new phone.” A horrible, elderly clam-shell phone was plonked in the middle of his report. “They said next time they’ll take the cost out of your pay.”
“Normally I’d agree with you mate, but most of the time the person doing the complaining doesn’t have half the clout Throttlebottom does. You have to admit, the biting thing isn’t exactly a matter of national security...you can buy a nose biting teacup from George’s shop!”
It was Pansy’s hand on his shoulder now, urging him on. If he didn’t go now, well. Draco pushed his fingers through his hair, hooked his jacket from the back of the stool, and followed her out, managing not to look back at that corner of the pub again.
“No moping,” Hermione tapped her wand on Harry’s leg and his greasy fingerprints vanished. “Tell us about your friend.”
Draco gave his teacup a little poke and re-heated his tea, then did the same for Potter’s. “What do you think this is, domestic terrorism? Foreign interference?”
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes dramatically. “Oh, sure, Potter, I’ll believe that when I-” He was cut off when Harry used his aforementioned big muscles to flip them both over, and pressed Draco back into the bed with every part of his body - but particularly his mouth.
“You going to eat that?” Freckled fingers reached for the toast, and Harry cast a mild Stinging jinx under his breath without reaching for his wand, or indeed looking up from an advert for an extra large cauldron for sale, slightly used. Ron made a yowling noise that Harry was pretty sure he’d picked up from Crookshanks. “I’m Head Auror, you know. I could have you in Azkaban for that.”
He wasn’t heroic. He was a feckless idiot who thought rules didn't apply to him (Robards), who had a death wish (Hermione), and who didn’t have enough restraint to wait a fucking minute and consider the very reasonable advice of his long-suffering partner (Malfoy). All Harry knew, was that something in him urged him to
“I know you,” Potter said, and his eyes were dark, and very green. “I know the cleverest Auror in his division. I know a man who stopped to protect a fallen colleague before himself. I know how you like your tea, and all your favourite meals from the caf at work, and that you hate Ice Mice but love a mint humbug.” He got up, and knelt on the settee, one knee on either side of Draco’s thighs, and slowly sat on his lap. “I know you’re stubborn to the point of idiocy. I know what your face looks like when it’s filled with love for Teddy, and that makes my heart ache. I know you like the way my mouth tastes when I’ve just had a cigarette, but you’d never tell me because you don’t approve of smoking.” Potter pressed his fingers against Draco’s top. “I know when you wear this, you look like you walked directly out of a wet dream. I know what your arms feel like around me when I’m coming, that you’re strong enough to hurt me, but you don’t. I’ve watched you grow and change for more than half our lives, Draco. There are plenty of things for me to learn about who you are, but I
"I'm sorry," he choked, his throat still bone dry, and trapping the words half-spoken, "I didn't mean-"
Potter was silent for a moment, his eyes soft. He reached out and clasped his warm hand on Draco’s knee. It felt hot through his thin trousers. “You’re right.” His thumb rubbed a gentle circle. “I tried to tell you yesterday.”
“Might be my penis, actually,” Harry said, and Neville, who had just walked in from the sitting room, turned directly around and back the way he came.
exactly. I only meant to Summon the small ones, and leave the bigguns, like the Snowy owls and the like.”
“Let’s start with in the department.” Potter seemed amused. “I know we’ve had our differences, but I’ve been trying to be cooperative since I came on board.”
Something dark and swooping came to life in Draco’s belly, and he fidgeted in his seat. He didn’t want to think about that. Thinking about Potter liking him was a guaranteed path to getting hurt.  “What’s the story with Finnegan, and Potter, and my Quidditch jersey?”
. Draco tasted copper in his mouth, and realised he had bitten the inside of his cheek hard enough to bleed.
Longbottom had his phone out, trying to film the waves, Draco presumed. He waded back through the shallow water toward him and their gear, blue sparks racing out where he kicked past the waves. His jeans were plastered to him, nearly dragging right off his hips, and his nipples felt like they could cut glass. His hair was a salty tangle, and he tried to push it back from his face, still worrying at the tender bit of his lip with his teeth.
“Come to my place-” Draco started to object, but Potter grabbed him hard by the wrist. “For once in your life, don’t be difficult Draco. Come to mine. I’ll side-along you.”
“You pulled me from the fiendfyre,” Draco said, his voice thick. “I’ve felt like I was burning ever since.” Potter crushed their lips together, sliding his hand up into Draco’s hair, his fingers rough-tipped and strong, and Draco pushed hard against him. His mouth was perfect, plush lips, warm and wet, his tongue in Draco’s mouth. Potter was a hot and welcome weight on his thighs, Draco pushed his hands up the back of Potter’s shirt and pressed his fingertips into the dimples at the bottom of his spine.
Potter had spotted him earlier, when they’d all arrived in various dribs and drabs after work, had clasped a hand on his shoulder with a casual “Alright, Malfoy?”, ordered his lager, and said, even more casually, that he’d heard about Draco’s success on the counterfeit Wolfsbane case. The tip of his little finger had brushed inside Draco’s collar before he’d moved on. If he didn’t leave now, he could virtually guarantee he’d be on his knees within the hour, sucking Potter off in those disgusting loos.
an emergency and Hermione or someone came barging in...there would be no hiding what’d gone on. He’d die of embarrassment.
“How are you real,” Draco whispered, tracing Harry’s scar with one careful fingertip. “How are you mine?” Harry turned his face to press a kiss into Draco’s palm. “Like, I know you’re real, this is all very consistently Harry Potter, it's just baffling sometimes that I’m the one you…” He paused. “Like, maybe it’s all just one of those mad recurring dreams you have as a teenager. Maybe I’ll wake up, and it’ll be 1996 again, and it won’t be real after all.”
Harry Apparated to a lane not far from Old Street Station in Shoreditch, and made his way at a brisk clip to Tabernacle Street. The club was called Throb, and Harry had told Malfoy on the phone that morning that it sounded like a strip club. Not that Harry had ever been to one. He’d felt a pillock as soon as the words had left his mouth, but Malfoy had only laughed, and it had done strange things to Harry’s stomach.
“Exactly,” Ron nodded. “And anyway, having to spend time in Malfoy’s company will be punishment enough for you.”
The bus screeched to a halt in the street outside their flat. There was a collective grumble as Aurors were thrown forward in their seats, thudding into each other and the chairs in front of them, but it wasn't a problem for Harry, because he had virtually leaped from the vehicle while it was still moving anyway. He ran for the gate, tripped on the carry strap of his field pack and fell sprawling into the garden bed just outside the small block of flats. The faint echo of laughter reached him as he struggled out of the clutches of a bush, and he glared squintily (his glasses were on the ground somewhere) at his colleagues who were still parked on the curb. A moment later, the van was roaring away and Harry was sorted, pack over shoulder, glasses on nose, some leaves and twigs still decorating his hair. He pushed past the gate, slightly more sensibly this time, but only barely so, and jogged quickly up the path to the front door of the building. His key was ready in his hand, had been ready for about half an hour before they'd even approached his street, and he was inside, he was taking the stairs two at a time and wishing he had been taller, like Ron, so he could take them three, or even four at a time. Green door, six-oh-five, that was him, that was
“Scared,” Draco countered. “You know I wasn’t seeing anybody else though, between your birthday and then?”
“I think we would have been friends.” Harry didn’t like the way his voice sounded. Earnest. Like he was really saying, I think I love you. I think I’m in love with you. I want to touch your stupid, pretty hair.
Draco pushed his mulberry silk sleep mask up into his hair and looked around his still-darkened bedroom. There was no Ministry owl waiting with a scroll. No Patronus glowering at him from beside his bed. The phone continued to bleat
, you thieving shit, instead of…” Harry shrugged, no idea what Malfoy would usually have done on his birthday. “I dunno, partying somewhere more trendy than this place.”
Malfoy nodded seriously. “Who would dare use a misdirection charm on a Muggle, in a Muggle venue? In front of a senior member of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” His expression was one of perfect innocence, and if it had been anybody else Harry might even have believed it. “Nobody I know, certainly.”
, he may in fact throw himself into the Fountain of Magical Brethren in the Atrium and hope he drowned quickly.
Harry felt the tingle of Draco’s cleaning charm pass between them. “Can you stand to spend the day in pants that are a little bit stiff?”
It was, of course, a perfectly practical solution, which did not resolve the real problem which was that Harry had absolutely no desire to be of service to Balter Throttlebottom in any capacity. Throttlebottom was a bully and a bigot, despite what his Order of Merlin might suggest, and Harry had butted heads with him repeatedly over the years in his capacity as Auror. He was particularly enthusiastic about imposing unduly heavy sentences for minor offences, when those offences had been committed by defendants from certain ‘undesirable’ backgrounds. No, it would be infinitely more satisfying to leave his harvest of dicks just where it was, in full view of all Throttlebottom’s friends and neighbours and the world at large.
Apparently, that was a step too far, even though Draco had literally just said he hoped Zabini would both shit himself,
Malfoy snorted slightly into his cup. “Throttlebottom’s a pustulant little boil, isn’t he.” Malfoy paused. “Kingsley Shacklebolt shouted at me, once. I didn’t have a solid bowel movement for at least a week after.”
An easy solution to some of these things was brunch, and so he found himself head-first in his sitting room fireplace, Flooing Ron and Hermione.
him.” Draco raked a hand through his hair, and tried to hold on to his dignity. “Am I supposed to keep fucking him in the shadows then, too? Waiting my turn?”
“From everywhere,” said a wizard just ahead of him, spelling feathers from his robes. “Not an owl to be found in London, a magical one, at least. That’s what they’re saying.”
Draco’s task for Friday, therefore, was to prepare an exhaustive report on the event including recommendations for safety improvements at future fundraisers, confirm the final tally of donations, and revise the Summer Swim program budget in order to present it all to Scrivener on Monday while still leaving enough time to be chastised again for as long as Scrivener felt like it. Draco sighed, and the sound echoed through the corridor, along with the clip of his heels on the hard floor. He really did wonder, sometimes, what he was doing in this department, working for such an extraordinarily incompetent fuckwit after so many years. He’d had offers. He could have had a nice little career in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Nobody had a problem with hard ‘k’ sounds there, to the best of his knowledge.
Harry had also managed to find himself a pair of underpants that weren't too embarrassing - once again, thanks to his annual Christmas gift from Hermione, to go with the sensible ties and socks. Not that he was expecting anything to happen, to meet someone and have it get to the stage where underpants were being revealed. It was a practical issue, really. The jeans were so tight, and sort of low rise. Harry looked like a proper muppet with his normal cotton boxers spilling out over the waistband like foam on a pint. These pants of Hermione’s were also quite tight, and lower cut than he was used to. The thick waistband had some designers name on it, nobody Harry knew (which didn’t say much), and could just be seen wrapping around his hips beneath the jet black denim. They were doing interesting things to Harry’s bits, as well. The pants had sort of
“Trent, this is Harry Potter. It’s his birthday, you know.” He leaned in close to Trent’s ear. “You should suck him off.”
Harry shoved both hands, caked with dust and grime, into his hair. “I’ve been keeping a secret from you.” His heart was thudding in his chest, somewhat due to the recent startlement, and the rest due to the confession which was bearing down on them like the Hogwarts Express. Draco just continued to stare at him, affording no relief.
Shacklebolt was not pleased that the case was still open, and the cock-bush still flowering, but at least he seemed satisfied that Harry was doing his utmost to get to the root of the problem, so to speak. Throttlebottom was apoplectic. The dicks had now flourished and multiplied to the point that it was no longer possible to reach the front door of his cottage without liberal use of a slashing hex, and the
“This will do,” Draco moaned, grinding down on Potter’s fabric covered-thigh. “I don’t want to wait. Leave my shirt, and your trousers, and just get your cock out.” Potter made a strangled sound and shoved Draco hurriedly around to face the bench, upsetting a stack of towels that tumbled noiselessly to the floor. Draco grabbed the bevelled edge of the bench for purchase, and shuddered as he heard the tell-tale sound of Potter’s zip being drawn, and his trousers dropping to his feet. “Get on with it, Potter, fuck me – I’m still ready from this morning.”
When Harry was a safe distance, Draco tossed a fresh handful of powder into the Floo, and re-opened the connection. “What’s Minerva going to think when she sees you all rumpled?”
He sent a wandless charm at his latte to warm it up, gave it a little too much, then burned his throat while gulping it down in one. “So you guys are fine with it?”
He straightened his posture, watching his muscles move as he raised one hand to his hair. He ran a hand through it, pulled it slightly - he liked that, he likes the way it feels to have someone's fingers sifting through, and then a sharp tug. Likes that it's long enough, and thick enough, to lose a hand in. He could do with a bit of hair pulling in his life. He reckoned Malfoy might enjoy doing the pulling.
“Hasn’t anybody work to do? Considering the Olympic Torch Relay will be passing through Diagon Alley in a matter of weeks, I would have thought the Department of Magical Games and Sport
He gave Malfoy two fingers and nearly spilled his tea on himself for his trouble. “Obviously I have a full time job, as you can see. I’m in the office by eight most mornings, and normally head off around six. I have lunch with Ron most days in the Ministry refectory, unless one of us is in the field. Sometimes we might venture out for a pub meal if Hermione’s free too. Monday, Wednesday and Sunday are gym nights. I’m not technically required to train now that I’m not auroring, but I like keeping it up. Thursday is always beers at the Leaky with the old Auror crew. Friday night is family dinner with the Weasleys, and the last Sunday of every month I have lunch with my cousin Dudley.”
“Nothing happened,” Harry sipped his tea, and then added a second spoon of sugar. “We just slept. Spooned a bit.”
“Potter would invite me,” Malfoy said, smug and confident, and Ron gave Harry a long look that was rather smug and confident itself. Harry glared and flipped him off in return, and Ron left in a much improved temperament.
“Blaise really knows his shit,” Draco said, impressed. He recounted the instructions Theo had given, enabled the editing function, zoomed in a little then cropped the picture at his shoulders, taking the phone away. It meant you couldn’t see his hair anymore, which was a shame, but the rest of it left absolutely nothing to the imagination. There would be no way Potter would mistake this backside with anyone else’s.
“Hello, Aggie? It’s Draco. Alright, darling? Listen, do you have the Sensual Lover in stock at the mo? You know the one, Muggle brand, about a four inch circumference, comes in purple? Yes, that’s the very one. Oh you only stock the teal?” Malfoy looked at Harry, who jotted this down. “No my customer is really mad about the purple, won’t take anything else. Have you recently sold out, or...oh right, I hear you. Well thank you anyway darling, I’m sorry I can’t chat. Shop is absolutely teeming today...oh...” Malfoy suddenly let out a bark of laughter. “Yes, you’re probably right. I’ll let you get back to it. My love to Gez and the kids. Bye.” Malfoy rang off and shrugged. “Well, that’s one off your list. She hasn’t stocked the purple at all, only the teal. Seems those were going cheap from the wholesaler at the time.”
Well, that wasn’t strictly what he’d been thinking about. Malfoy seemed to find this very funny. “It’s a fog machine. Not cigs.”
“You’ve always been my favourite,” Harry sprayed the words around a shower of crumbs, “Don’t tell Devlin, he’ll be horribly jealous.” Vicky closed the door quietly behind herself on the way out. Harry thought he ought to bring her something nice tomorrow. Vicky put up with rather a lot.
Draco had picked up a set of gloves and was measuring them against his own hand. “So, what happened? This isn’t just a couple of months worth of gifts, Harry.”
A bartender pushed a tall glass of something green across the bar to Potter, with a bemused smirk. “From a fan.” The twink looked like he might have a stroke at any second, and Potter raised the glass in acknowledgement. The kids' eyes went huge. Draco cast a discreet spell on the drink to confirm it hadn’t been spiked with anything.
As he rounded the corner past the fish and chippery, he could already hear the sticky pulse of music. Throb was an apt name for the place by all accounts. Malfoy was easy to spot, even at this distance. He tried not to obviously stumble, and swore, low and long under his breath. Malfoy was leaning against the brick wall of a building slightly past the corner, lazily dragging on a Muggle cigarette. The neon pink of the club signage glowed down on him, and he looked...he looked like the perfect, impossible balance of casual and posh, Muggle and magic, of inviting and completely untouchable.
“You need to talk to him, Draco,” Granger reached across the table and put her hand on his wrist. “He doesn’t understand why you suddenly cut him out, and he definitely has no idea you have feelings for him. Not like this.”
Christ, he was definitely going to try and set him up with someone. They’d probably be very sweet and gentle. A Hufflefpuff. Draco would hate them. “I told you, I’m not seeing anyone anymore,” Draco said, careful to avoid a strictly honest answer on the special part. It wasn’t a lie, but equally it wasn’t the truth. But wild horses wouldn’t drag his feelings about Potter out, now. “Hot chips are my one true love, come on Longbottom. They’re waiting for me.”
“Shut up,” Draco said against Potter’s throat. “If you’re talking then you obviously don’t have enough to do with your mouth.”
It went on like that for what felt like hours; it was hard to judge the passage of time, between the weaving lights, the the pounding music, and Malfoy’s wandering hands. He must have watched a dozen people, maybe more, mostly men, and described with growing confidence what it was about them that he found attractive, and if they noticed him looking, what he felt when they did. What he’d like to do to them. What he’d like them to do to him. His cock remained thick and heavy through every lingering moment, but he felt he was perhaps getting his constant flush somewhat under control. He was hardly even stammering at all now. Small victories.
“Are you going to manhandle me?” Malfoy’s voice was high and breathy, almost as if he were enjoying this. “I love a good scrap.”
He wasn’t sure when it had become a thing, not a tradition, exactly, maybe more like a ritual. The year he’d turned eleven, in that fucking shack, with his horrible relatives snoring and farting around him, and he’d counted down the seconds until he’d gained his new year...it was best birthday he could remember, up to that point. Good things had happened when it turned midnight. Weird, scary, large and hairy and carrying cake, but really good. Somewhere along the line, after Voldemort, he’d started sitting up and counting down the hours, until there were only minutes, then seconds. He had a hunch that if he saw the last year through, and watched it tick over, then the next year of his life would be a good one.
With a noise of rage, Draco sat, picked up the phone, and flung it directly through his bedroom door and into the hallway beyond, briefly enjoying the sound of it clattering against the skirting boards even as it continued to yelp
“Maybe escort me out of my robes,” Draco didn’t manage to finish that thought, because Potter’s mouth was on his again.
“Ah, sweet Cabbage Head,” Draco said wistfully. “He’d never have me. I’m a bad person - or I was, now I’m just a nothing person. He sometimes speaks to me, at work-”
Potter shook his head. “Oh, Malfoy. So you thought I would deprive every witch and wizard in Britain some of their most beloved pastimes, just to annoy
Draco had, in fact, entertained several similar thoughts on more than a few occasions, but he had also fantasised about pushing Scrivener off the Hogwarts astronomy tower quite a number of times as well, and that would certainly be an extremely poor life decision in anybody’s book. He wasn’t entirely certain that shagging Potter would not ultimately lead to disaster. With effort, Draco stilled, and Potter paused in his mission to devour Draco’s collarbone, and met his gaze. Draco wasn’t sure how to explain himself, but he needed Potter to know that if this all imploded…his job, the relatively new relationship they had forged together that even Draco would describe as friendship at this point. Potter looked up at him, waiting, and Draco opened his mouth and shut it again twice.
He smiled at Harry. “Have you, though? You seem to expect yourself to adapt to every new skill as if it was your first time on a broom. Why should it be? Why isn’t it okay to struggle for proficiency?” Harry just looked at Malfoy, not sure what to say. “Granger was never very good with flying, if I recall.”
Harry pushed a bit of toast through his beans before dropping it with a sigh and wiping his buttery fingers on the leg of his track pants. He’d felt so good last night. And today everything just felt confusing, and annoying.
Malfoy was sorting his filing out. His suit was dark grey, with a lavender shirt that reminded Harry of the sky at twilight, when the sun had set, and the moon was high.
. I see quite a bit of that in my line of work, as you can imagine - it both enlarges and lengthens, if you hadn’t worked that out already.” Harry felt his cheeks burn. Yes, he had worked that out. “You can clearly see that it was cast deliberately. I’d say the
“You can’t Apparate out of the Ministry, Potter, and especially not from the Ward Room.” Potter just looked at him. “Don’t tell me.
“You got christened?” Harry said with surprise. Draco snatched the velvet box from his hands. There was a big clump of dust and cobweb in his hair.
“Ginevra.” Draco took his bag from his pocket before he sat, and enlarged it again, fussing around with his bottle of water and a bag of wine gums. “I didn’t know you were such a fan of organised childrens sport.”
“Couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke,” Harry murmured, thumbing through the pages of his paper til he found the Quidditch scores. He normally tried to avoid the tabloid press at all costs, and the
a bit weird, but it was doing it for him right now, and that was all that really mattered. He dropped his other hand from its grip on the bench, and wrapped his fingers around his own cock, not fighting the shudder that rippled through him, then rippled through him again as Potter groaned, twisted his hips, and somehow got deeper inside him. Draco felt the breath being fucked out of him with every buck, and Potter had hit his stride, long, fluid thrusts that felt as if they might split Draco apart. Potter was moving in tight, sharp jerks now, and his hand clutched its way from Draco’s hip to meet his in a hot circle around his prick.
Harry laughed, but Draco’s pickle happened to be back in Harry’s mouth, and so Draco tried all his swears out again.
Draco heaved an enormous (and only slightly exaggerated) sigh, and flopped directly onto Harry’s chest without making any obvious attempt to do so gently.
“Indeed. I realise it’s a bit early, but I was wondering if you might let my friend and I pop upstairs for a drink before the doors open.”
Draco didn’t let him down this time, his post-coital pink deepening. He fussed with his hair, scooping it back from his face and neck into a bun, which only showed off more of his flushed skin, to Harry’s delight.
“Not a problem,” Harry said, and meant it. Draco wanted to be engaged for a while before they tied the knot, even though they’d been together for some time, and were well past the stage of being unsure whether they would make it (especially after living under the same roof, and not murdering each other even once). Harry had been fully prepared to make things legal by the end of the next business day, once Draco had got past the shock of being asked, and had slipped on the ring with a shaky ‘yes’. But Draco still wanted to be engaged for at least six months, with a slowly building frenzy of drama and ceremony, and then to have what he called ‘a proper wedding, Potter, no running off to Bali to get married in the sand like some reality television couple who will have split up by the time they clear the Customs queue at Heathrow’.
. He’s demanding just completely unreasonable resources for the investigation. He asked me to recall Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt! Like, as if he’s just been off fieldwork for the last fifteen years, or something. He’s the fucking Minister for Magic!”
. “It was just before we started Auror training. I was at the Weasley’s and the owls delivered both our uniforms, for Ron and me. Everyone wanted to see us try them on, so I went up to Ginny’s room, and she came in with me, and I had the parcel open.” He swallowed hard. Malfoy was teasing his neck now, the gentlest brush of his lips along the tendons on Harry’s throat. “She was watching me as I started to get undressed. Her eyes - she looked like she wanted to eat me alive.”
“Is that an offer?” Potter called after him, but Draco refused to turn or answer, because his face was red again and he absolutely wouldn’t give Potter the satisfaction.
“Malfoy,” Ron said, smirking. “Sorry about the morning, but I’m sure you’ve been sleeping better since I started remembering my charms on Wednesday?”
Harry moved his hand from his hair and finally shoved down his pants, freeing his cock which was about as hard as it had ever been. He pressed his left hand to the mirror, and started to stroke with the other. The lube was warm and slick. Malfoy would like this. He’d like watching this. He’d tell Harry he was a good boy, to give him a show. He’d bite Harry’s neck, and pull Harry’s hair, and Harry would come and come and come.
“Brute strength,” Draco’s eyes roamed over Harry’s body, and he bit his lip, “lifting heavy things, and so forth. Because you’re so big, you see.”
Harry was so lost in his thoughts of Malfoy, that he barely noticed a plate of chicken and chips being placed in front of him, until he nearly put his elbow in it.
.” Draco let his fingers drop from his prick and clamp down on the bench again. Potter’s hand stripped his cock in time with each jerk of his hips, and with one swipe of his thumb, deliberate or accidental, the edge of a slight callous on Potter’s knuckle scraped across the head of Draco’s prick. He couldn’t stop the clench which rippled through his entire body, felt himself lock down around Potter for one dizzying moment before his vision greyed, and his orgasm took control, bending his spine til he thought he would simply snap in half. Potter groaned his name and bit down on his shoulder, hard, and Draco felt his hips slam into Draco’s arse once more and hold there, and there was come splashed on his chest, his fingers, and inside him, there was sweat all over him, dripping from his hair, and Draco had never felt so blissfully disgusting in all his life.
Well, that just made Harry feel even sweatier. A drink would be welcome. Five would be even more welcome, actually.
“I want to come over Thursday, and help you put some decorations up. And I want you to make me this famous pasta salad that has every Weasley in such a lather.”
The words stung, and Malfoy knew they did. Harry could tell by the angry flush crawling up his neck, and the way that he made his outburst without ever looking Harry in the face. He'd spent enough time in close quarters with Malfoy after the war, to know the telltale signs of his humiliation. Among other things.
? You say we're friends, but we aren't - we hardly say a word to each other. We just live here together, and I don't
“Look,” Draco said, his temper getting away from him. “Since everyone seems to know it was going on,
“What does ‘sort of’ mean? Harry!” Ginny was far less gentle, nearly wriggling in her seat in open excitement, but managed to refrain from hitting him again.
Draco felt sick. He was being dismissed. This wasn’t an offer to stay the night, to curl up together, to rest together, to touch each other again until they couldn’t stop. Potter was grateful for his services with Weasley, Potter showed his appreciation with a little more warmth than usual, but in the end, when everyone had come, it was time for Draco to go home. Nothing was changing, except maybe Draco was becoming even more of a fucking idiot over time.
Theo looked at him. “Platonic friendship kisses are for good Slytherins who go out dancing and shout the expensive champagne. Horrible Slytherins who wake hungover people up at unsociable hours of the morning are not eligible. Also, do you think a stimulant is a good idea right now? When was the last time you slept?” Draco couldn’t quite remember, and Theo snorted. “That’s what I thought. Drink your juice and tell Uncle Blaise why the Boy Who Lived has your nudes.”
Draco just couldn't do breakfast properly without Harry. For one thing, he couldn't cook. It was part simple ineptitude on his behalf, and part determination to make sure Harry had to continue looking after him in this way, because he couldn't do it for himself. Hermione had scoffed once that it was utter laziness, and Draco behaving like a spoiled brat. She'd told Harry it was absolutely the most ridiculous excuse she had ever heard for avoidance of a chore, and that Harry had been royally sucked in for believing it. But Harry knew better, because he knew that breakfast was
They kissed, open-mouthed, slow, lingering. “Roll over a bit - let me fix your back,” Potter murmured into his mouth after long, heady minutes. Draco did as told, and Potter’s healing magic washed over him for the second time that day, the stinging lines of Potter’s scratches gone as quickly as they’d been made. Potter smoothed his hands over Draco’s shoulders, up and down his spine, dug his thumbs into his muscles. Draco was loose, dazed. Drunk on it. Drunk on pleasure, drunk on his feelings. Potter had never doted on him like this. It felt like something was changing between them.
Ron had bits of bok choy sticking out of his mouth. “So he’s really not going back to Auroring, then?” Harry shook his head, and Ron chewed sadly. “Fuck. I can’t say I’m surprised, but still. He was a really good partner.”
There was movement on the pitch. The six teams of children were clustered in the centre with their coaches, one of whom was apparently Potter, receiving a pre-game lecture on safety and good sportsmanship. A whistle blew sharply, and four of the teams raced off to sit in their designated places on the sidelines, while the remaining two groups mounted brooms and got in the air, some of them a bit wobbly. It looked like Teddy wasn’t in the first round, so Draco concentrated on unwrapping his chocolate and not looking over at the barely visible back of Potters head. “So, Lovegood’s here?” Lovegood was alright. He could look at her without wanting to vomit, these days, and she was as dizzy and kind as she ever was.
“I’d shag you, Weasley, of course.” The table erupted into whistles, and Harry hid behind a big gulp of beer. “I’ve looked in the change rooms, I won’t deny it. Despite your personality, you’ve got a tidy little situation going on there - well, perhaps not so little.” More hoots and whistles. “And you can’t say anything to annoy me if your mouth is full.”
She turned and picked a slender bottle of amber-coloured liquid from the shelves, and poured a measure into each glass. The alcohol looked thick and smelled like honey. “This is mead from a little village in Poland called Stara Wieś. Absolutely lush but it’ll also knock you right on your arse, so pace yourselves.” Clementine placed the bottle on the countertop alongside the glasses. “Now, I want you to take these and find yourselves a nice cozy spot to get reacquainted, and I’ll check in on you every now and then to make sure you don’t need any provisions.”
“A change you volunteered for,” there was real accusation in his voice. As if Potter had a right to feel slighted.
“Yep,” Harry adjusted his squat, his legs starting to cramp. “My dad’s too. And he was my godfather, like I’m yours.”
, but Draco ignored the little bells and went straight to texting Neville asking about the photographs.
Draco was up to his neck in hot water, heavy with coconut oil and organic goat milk, and a liberal sprinkle of dusky rose petals, when Bog appeared in the steam of his bathroom.
“Potter!” Someone from the Wizengamot had spotted him, and barged over to clap Potter so hard on the shoulder that he had to throw a hand up against the glass to avoid cracking his head on the window. Draco stepped away and into the depths of the compactus, and tried to get a hold of himself while he searched for Potter’s files. It took almost as long as the task itself, and when he emerged, Potter was gone, and had left another scrap with a scribbled note:
He moved before he could be stopped again, before he could turn back, take it back. He buttoned his fly as he went, and Apparated as soon as he was clear.
“Harry.” Malfoy had both elbows on the bar and one foot cocked on the polished rail near the floor. Naturally, his trousers were pulling tight across his backside again. Malfoy was smiling his liquid smile. “Harry and I are old school friends. We haven’t seen each other in a very long time, and I thought I’d take him out for a bit of fun.”
They just stood there for a moment, looking at each other. Then Malfoy smiled again, and started down the stairs. Harry watched him go: graceful, lithe, an unbelievable arse both literally and figuratively. He wanted to do things to that literal arse that he literally barely knew the name for-
“I’m going to go out on a limb here, and assume this has something to do with the lead article in this morning’s
Malfoy had found the pasta salad, and set it out on the kitchen table with Harry’s plates and cutlery, and a breadboard with something enormous and delicious looking on it.
“Exactly, mate! I was pestering girls and you were splitting your time between staring at my sister and staring at Malfoy.” Ron’s appetite seemed to have recovered, and he speared bits of mushroom and sausage determinedly.
No one said a word. It was so quiet, Harry could hear the bubbles bursting softly in Hermione’s glass of posh grapefruit mineral water. Ginny and Hermione kept exchanging meaningful looks with one another. Feeling panicked, Harry tried his beans and eggs again just for something to fill the silence. “Are you sure,” Ron eventually said, sounding pained, “that it’s definitely not goblin porn?”
The sleeve felt...fine. It was snug, and while it didn’t quite feel like someone else was touching him, the grooves inside were a nice change from the familiar notches of his own hands. It was good. Fine. Harry had sort of expected more from his very first sex toy (unless you counted the harness Ginny used to peg him with, which, he probably should). It felt nice. Very nice. Nice enough.
annoy you. He just doesn’t go before bed, so when he wakes up, it’s a big job. And he’s really tall, so, you know,” Harry gestured vaguely at his own crotch. “It’s coming from a much greater height.”
“I'm no mind Healer,” Malfoy said again, “but I'll give you my two sickles if you like. You're a mess of contradictions, Potter. You're confident - the way you just
“I promised Lawlor we would address the cake issue, and I let Mona Cordwell down gently about the allocation of Department of Magical Law Enforcement resources to missing stationery. She took it well.” Potter reached for another biscuit, and drained his tea. “I didn’t know what to say to Parker, other than to apologise and promise to note it down so he wouldn’t have to move desks again. Wedderburn is now in possession of a concealment spell that he’s quite pleased with, which should take care of the soy milk issue. And Gardner…” Potter winced apologetically. “Well, I might have lost my patience with him a bit.”
“Thank you, sweetheart.” Three years together, two of them living under the same roof, and four months engaged, and Draco still turned the most gorgeous shade of pink whenever Harry called him that.
Potter sighed. “Come on.” Draco sighed too, and batted petulantly at a towel hanging from a nearby washing line.
“Erm, no preference. Anyone you fancy?” The moment the words had left his mouth, Harry realised his mistake, and he turned his face away from Malfoy’s side of the office and mostly hid his head in a large scroll of parchment. “Any
Harry felt the blush from head to toe. “Oh, I don’t know, I mean. Yes, I’m Harry, but I don't know that I’m Draco’s-”
even came with its own charm to ward off moths, so Harry never had to think about whiffy mothballs or holey jumpers again.
Draco smirked. “I’m not calling you a liar, calm down. I’m saying I didn’t believe you could possibly have presented any type of sorting challenge, since you’re basically solid gold Gryffindor to the very core. But after seeing these shenanigans with Blaise...” He shook his head. “I’m starting to think the old hat may have been onto something.”
Draco had been staring into space for an indeterminate length of time, when Potter finally caught his attention.
Potter shook his head. “Not true. I know what you look like when you don’t care. I’ve seen that. That’s not what’s happening here.” There was a pause, and Draco found it hard to hear anything over the sound of his blood, rushing in his ears. “Look, I need to piss - would you please just stay, don’t leave. There’s a lot more we need to say to each other. Stay, please?”
He slid his fingers between Draco's cheeks, the butter sliding easily over his skin, and the first finger slipped inside his body effortlessly. Draco moaned and pulled at their cocks even harder, an expression of blissful pleasure on his face. The second finger entered him with an easy glide, Draco's hole virtually sucking on his fingers, and it was no time before he was practically fisting him, three fingers in, two of which were circling his spot, butter melted and dripping all the way to his elbow and smeared over every inch of Draco's crack.
The mirror had only enough time to offer an opening squeak before Harry’s Silencing charm clamped solidly down around it - he was absolutely not in the mood for any pervy comments today, especially while naked and vulnerable. It wasn’t long before he was under the hot water, the spray of the shower pounding down on his shoulders like needles, rinsing away the lingering evidence of the previous night with soapy water and steam. His fingers in his hair felt nice, pushing shampoo around the thick tangle. When it pulled suddenly, snagged on his fingers where the curls had become particularly knotted, the answering flutter of arousal in his belly was almost surprising.
Malfoy seemed to know exactly what Harry couldn’t quite work out how to say. “Indeed. I have the very thing. Are you free this afternoon?”
Malfoy wore a fitted black shirt, something that looked both soft and crisp at once, and which was rolled up at the sleeves to the elbow and unbuttoned to somewhere down the middle of his chest. Over the top was a grey waistcoat which just skimmed his hips, the first two buttons also unfastened. There was a heavy silver-coloured watch at one wrist which looked expensive. His trousers were also grey and slim cut, tight around the thigh where Malfoy’s foot was resting against a narrow ledge of brick in the wall behind him. Even his boots looked incredible, butterscotch-coloured and satin polished.
Potter looked embarrassed at that, and didn't say anything else. Draco felt stupid and embarrassed as well, and knew he should have said something else, a thank you, perhaps. That was the least that Potter deserved. Potter stepped back into the dark mouth of the black house, allowing Draco to pass through. He did, with a shiver, and the door creaked closed behind him.
Said pointy git patted Harry on the belly, his breath a rapid, moist puff against Harry’s throat. “Excellent shag,” Harry huffed into Draco’s hair, which was sweaty, with long strands of it catching in Harry’s stubble and sticking to Harry’s equally sweaty neck. “One of our best, I reckon.”
Malfoy pushed the scrap of paper back to Harry. “There’s a good chance this is a false name, although to be fair, it can be a bit difficult to tell with Wizards.”
“No tie.” There was a collective rustle of excitement behind Draco as his staff tried to stifle their glee behind their fingers. “...Wait. Actually...” Morgan lowered the opera glasses mournfully. “Actually, he’s got on a cravat.”
“You said you were meant to be somewhere hot and foreign, getting sucked off by someone hot and foreign.” He shrugged, and smirked at Draco, letting his eyes wander down his very much bare chest. “I’m here to help with that bit.” Draco truly didn’t know how to respond, and he suspected his mouth was open rather rudely. Potter stepped forward slowly, and hooked his forefinger into the towel around Draco’s hips. “Is this okay?” Draco nodded mutely, and then Potter was kissing him, and everything else dissolved into a chocolate-scented blur of pleasure for several long minutes.
The weekend was trickier. Navigating Friday night so that he didn’t spend the weekend pining over Malfoy became a second job. Ron had been surprisingly helpful. He was pretty sure Hermione had spoken to him, and told him (and probably Ginny, too) to give Harry a break on the Malfoy issue. The first Friday night after the infamous shag, marry, kill incident, Harry managed to get Bujalski talking about her potions internship, and he carefully ushered Ron into place so that he wasn’t sitting directly beside or opposite Malfoy. Ron seemed to catch on without needing it explained, and the following week brought a selection of Wheezes sweets from a new range due for release before Christmas, and they spent the evening laughing themselves hoarse while each chew morphed their mouths and noses into a new animal’s features. It was easy not to fixate on the shape of Malfoy’s lips, when Malfoy was trying to drink a pint around a toucan beak.
Finding an outfit for a Muggle club had taken practically the whole day, and Harry wasn’t convinced he had succeeded, now that he was taking a second look.
It wasn’t actually fair to feel quite this horrible, considering he hadn’t really had all that much to drink. The bottle of mead hadn't been very large to begin with, and he’d shared it with Malfoy after all. Having said that, it had been fairly hot in the club, and they’d been sort of dancing, almost, and he hadn’t had anything else to drink in all that time. And there was the small matter of all the wanking he’d done in the night, of course. It was really no wonder he was rather dehydrated.
“Creepiest living being in wizarding London,” Draco said, folding the note into his pocket. “Permit’s done. We can go directly to the Ward Room now.” He cranked the lever down to Level 9 instead of 2, and refused to meet Potter’s eyes. His body had felt rather lovely pressed up against Draco’s. It was becoming harder to ignore his attraction to Potter, who definitely had not been helping with his constant innuendo through the morning. Fancying Harry Potter was a bad idea, though
“I wondered where you’d got to lately,” Potter had said, smoke curling in the pink morning light. “Given up leg day for this?”
He said it quietly, barely audible over the rustle of the trees in the wind, and the nearby snuffling from the pen of crups a few feet away.
"I mean queer as in soft in the head, not queer as in…you know, the other kind. Seven days of your huffing and puffing will give a person the idea you don't
Monday morning saw Harry up to his ears in paperwork. There were enough referrals on his desk to build a small house, and the results of a number of recent Trackers needed a final review before they were escalated to the arrest stage. Harry’s head was bent over one such report when he realised there was someone standing in his doorway, silently boring holes into the top of his head with their eyes.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, swaying into Malfoy. “I guess that’s it. I want someone to know me before they get to know my body. I could let down my guard for someone like that.”
“Nothing,” Harry echoed. There was a bowl of Twiglets on the table to share, but Harry hated Twiglets, and thought moodily about apple cider flavoured crisps, and posh smiles. “The usual. Robards is riding him and it's not fair.”
The work trousers were obviously ruled out. They looked precisely like what they were, and Harry felt he’d be laughed out of the club if he showed up wearing any of them. And his jeans all had holes in them, which he sort of thought he might have read somewhere was actually on trend, but he wasn’t entirely sure and so they had best all be avoided. In the end, he had dug up an old pair of black jeans which were still nearly new. Harry remembered purchasing them quite vividly; after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione had been dumping an extraordinary amount of gear out of her famous beaded bag, piles of books, what seemed like a hundred flasks and phials, and just about every article of clothing Harry had owned up to that point in his life. She had commented to Harry as she sifted through a mountain of threadbare t-shirts and holey socks, that it might be about time he had some new clothes.
weird. I’ve watched you do it a million times, you kick off your slippers when you come into the bedroom, and they go every which way around the room because you’re completely uncivilised, and then in the morning you put them back on again, but even if the left one is perfectly positioned to just slip straight onto your foot, and the right one is like, upside down and half under the bed, you always put the right one on first!”
Her mouth twisted, and she said with great amusement. “A very big bird. Cranky one. Keeps its nest right on top of its head.”
Most days, Potter would be the first to break the silence. His voice would be hesitant, careful. He would mention, if it was Monday, that
Malfoy took the pint from Harry’s own hands, and gave it a suspicious sniff. “How many of these have you had?”
His colleagues laughed and punched both Harry and Ron on the shoulders. Oldmeadow grabbed Ron by said tits and gave them a thorough honking. “Easy, Oldmeadow, they’re not twist-tops!”
, he genuinely tried, not to look over there. Weasley was bent at the waist laughing, and Potter was pushing his glasses up onto his forehead to wipe away tears. Finnegan was holding court, the subject of their collective amusement. Sometimes, about half the time, Draco sat with the rest of the Aurors. Granger was often in the vicinity, and they usually talked potions theory. Pansy liked those times, because it gave her a chance to wind up one or more of the others, Longbottom especially, who isn’t an Auror but was always there anyway, by jiggling her tits, or squeezing past somewhere she needn’t, in order to press her arse into some poor saps crotch.
Harry jogged lightly around the old gamekeeper's hut. Hagrid was gone now, but Harry had difficulty thinking of the little house as belonging to anyone other than his old friend. An angry, pointed face glared at him from the wood pile, one hand clutching the opposite wrist, a palm being examined furiously.
Potter made a strange noise. “Interesting question. Let’s say yes. No sign of Dark magic. There’s a rapid build then drop at 2.23am, as suspected. The wards didn’t stop it, there was no ill intent behind it, and I still can’t quite place the actual spell, but it’s nothing harmful. The drop is consistent with the absence of hundreds of owls all disappearing at once. Not Apparition or a Portkey, they seem to all have gone through the dispatch ports, but I’m not sure they were flying. I did get a trace amount of magical residue though, enough that we’ll be able to confirm a match with a suspect, when the time comes. I think this really upholds the theory that it’s an animal activist, above anything else.”
It was hard to decide what was worse - that his friends had been betting on his love life; that they’d recognised something about Harry literally decades before he’d recognised it himself; that if he’d had a bit more of a clue, he might have been able to
“Could this not have been a memo?” Draco asked in exasperation. Weasley was sniggering into a forkful of beans. Bog just looked at him and eventually vanished.
“But we don’t need to worry about that anymore, because everything looks to be in perfect working order.”
“I can’t think of a single person who would be so bold.” They just looked at each other for a long moment.
“So,” Malfoy said again. “I’m no expert on your life, Potter, but I’d reckon you’ve dealt with some stressful things in your time. Saviour, Auror, all that. Why has this case gotten under your skin?”
my workload! You’ve increased it! Do you know what happens any time you even express the mildest of concerns that there may be any sort of security issue at an event? Scrivener tries to cancel it! And then what do I have to do? Run around behind him, trying to smooth things over, wearing green like a bloody twit with a pocketful of butterscotch doing my best not to say ‘canoe’ while persuading him that a gobstones tournament is not tantamount to lining innocent children up in a firing squad!”
Harry looked at himself for a long while in the mirror when he finally left the shower. The sense of shame was largely gone, although something gnawed along the edge of his thoughts, about why he should have felt such self-disgust in the first place. He deserved to feel good. He deserved to feel pleasure, and enjoy his body, he knew that, a body which had done many things which he was rather proud of over the years. He wouldn't judge someone else for something like this. Hermione had been telling him a version of this for years, forever really. He deserved pleasure. He deserved happiness. Why did he find it so hard to enjoy things?
Harry stepped closer to the wall and gave it an experimental poke with one finger. It felt smooth like glass, but slightly warm, and a small ripple spread from the point of contact and wobbled outwards until it faded. “Where did you find this stuff?” Harry didn’t bother to disguise his curiosity. “I’ve never even heard of it before.”
Weasley shrugged. “I’m his emergency contact. You know, next of kin. In case he gets splattered, or something.” Draco looked over at Potter again, involuntarily. Potter was a stupid git, but he certainly hoped he wasn’t going around doing things that might cause him to get splattered.
A few hot sips of Darjeeling seemed to fortify him, and Harry let the packet of biscuits sit on his chest as he ate them steadily, one at a time, crumbs multiplying at a brisk pace. He needed to calm the ever-loving fuck down, and clear his mind enough to think about the analysis.
It was hard not to fall in love with someone who flew down from the flames to save your life. Someone who cut you open, his face so full of shock and fear as you bled on the tile. He’d had a long time to come to terms with this, to accept this feeling, to close it off in a box inside him so he could get on with his life.
When Potter dragged him down to the floor, Draco at least had the presence of mind to pull a handful of towels with him; he dropped into the spot between Potter’s chest and bicep like he was designed specifically to fit there, and shoved a towel upwards in the general direction of Potter’s face. Quite half-heartedly, he swiped at his own torso, and he could feel Potter doing the same; his arse was aching in the best sort of way, and all Draco wanted to do was stay just as they were, forgetting the house elves who had been so rudely evicted, the mess they had made, forgetting the journalists and families, and staff, and Scrivener, all of whom should still be milling about the grounds of St Adjutor’s.
Malfoy, not anymore, if he ever really had. He’d known certain parts of Malfoy when they were at school, and Malfoy had known certain parts of him too.  But Harry wasn’t normally one to feel such attraction to someone that he didn’t otherwise have a strong connection with.
“Oh, christ,” Granger rolled her eyes, but it didn’t come to that, thankfully, as Longbottom arrived, and Pansy leaped from her chair to greet him.
“One final word, ladies and gentlemen,” Scrivener boomed. Draco shielded his eyes, and watched the children screeching in the water, a life guard treading water nearby and watching carefully to make sure none of them tried to drown one another. “After a great deal of consideration, I would like to announce my retirement from the Department of Magical Games and Sport.” Draco’s head snapped back to the Undersecretary immediately.
Bog stared at him, holding a purple memo in one spindly hand. “Bog is not dog, nor cat. Bog is Bog. Why should Bog wear a bell?”
Harry groaned again. “Malfoy, I don’t know what to tell you. I asked him to stop. I told him to put up a
“Malfoy,” Potter leaned back in his chair again and replaced his glasses. There were fingerprints on the left lens, and Draco tried not to fixate on it. His fingertips felt itchy. “You have to stop judging me by what my seventeen-year-old self might have done. It’s been a long time since I was that kid. I’ve moved on. I’m thirty-one, although I understand why my youthful good looks might have confused you.”
What, indeed. “I started to have trouble finishing if I didn’t have a finger in me. Gin asked me if I wanted to,” Harry took a deep breath and said the next part in a rush. “Have a threesome with another bloke. Or for me to be with a man while she watched, something like that. I didn’t handle it very well. It didn’t feel right, it felt like I was being unfaithful to Gin even though she was the one suggesting it and said she’d be there. I felt like it was wrong to want it and also to want to be with her, and to have a family. I felt like I had to choose one and stick to it. But I couldn’t decide which, so I just…” Harry trailed off. The truth was that he’d shut down and refused to deal with it, until finally Ginny had taken the decision out of his hands and ended things. Not unkindly, even though it hadn’t been easy on her, either. Harry felt a stirring of remembered shame. Ginny had been so good to him. Still was. He definitely needed to send her something nice tomorrow. Maybe flowers. Maybe one of Malfoy’s toys.
“Well,” Malfoy cocked his head and let his eyes drop briefly down Harry’s torso, and back to his eyes again. “How can you
Ted was hoisted on his shoulders, his hands gripping Draco’s hair a little too hard, and every now and then he’d forget himself and thump his heel hard into Draco’s ribs. The price one paid to be the favourite cousin.
and Harry found it a little bit offensive that they thought he couldn’t tell the difference after all these years.
He felt Potter smile against his back, a soft shake with his laughter. “You need some rest. You took a proper beating out there today. Round two can wait.” Draco smiled, his face half-pressed into the pillow. A bit of sleep, with Potter warm against his back, now that would be a true pleasure. “I’ll get your shirt and trousers.”
me? You stupid fuck. Smith hates us both, remember that. So while I’m obeying every one of his nonsense, bullshit rules, he can still use
Harry bit his lip and tried not to smile too obviously. “Keep your hair on, will you?” Malfoy rolled his eyes and started taking the steps two at a time, and Harry ducked his head, grinning, and followed him down.
“We should probably have a talk, tonight,” Harry said after a long moment, where they just stared at each other, the tension of many unsaid things heavy between them. “Maybe I should come over.”
Potter shook his head and leaned across Draco to pluck an orange cream from the biscuit tin. His chest was warm where it pressed against Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t get a lot of opportunity for dating in my line of work.”
-ever, which is how long I’ve been waiting for you to get home.” Harry linked their fingers, and pulled him towards the kitchen. “Come with me, I want to tell you all about my day.”
“You’re in a panic spiral,” Draco told him. “Take five deep breaths.” Harry did as he was told. “Good. Now, don’t think, just tell me what’s worrying you about this.”
icing, make sure it’s not coffee flavoured, and absolutely no powdered sugar. A reminder to all of you, keep your ‘umms’ and ‘errs’ to a minimum, eliminate them if you can, and please try to avoid using hard ‘k’ sounds, or the word ‘evidently’.” Draco eyed Wedderburn. “Perhaps you shouldn’t speak at all, Wedderburn. It’s your first time.”
“I’ll hex your balls to your forehead, and your arshole to your mouth,” she said, looking over his shoulder.
“Thank you all for your cooperation. As you know, today is the quarterly planning meeting, and the objective of one and all of us is to convince our dear Undersecretary that our various causes are worthy of funds from the budget. Given the circumstances, this will be a challenge to say the least.” He cast his eyes around the room sternly. “In order to improve our chances, we need to tighten up our game, otherwise this is going to be a very boring quarter for the Department of Magical Games and Sport, and the Auror Corps will have our collective arses for the rise in crimes committed by the general public due to sheer idleness. Worse still, we will be the laughingstock of the international magical sporting community, and I think we all had our fill of that during the infamous spring of 2004. So, without further ado: The Rules. Firstly, if you’re wearing purple, anything purple at all, please immediately charm that item
He opened his mouth and seemed about to force the issue, when Malfoy stepped smoothly between them. “Look - someone you know is calling you. Over there.” The man narrowed his eyes in confusion, looking across the crowd.
. Rotten fruit. Bad blood. This was an era for Longbottom’s, and Weasley’s, and Potter’s. Nobody needed Draco Malfoy getting married and having children. The sun was almost all the way down, and the sea drummed and gurgled around and between them. “Listen, Longbottom...if it makes you uncomfortable to be assigned with me-”
“Okay,” Potter said, ever the teacher. “You’ll need to take off your coat and hoodie, then I want you to stand right where you are with your feet slightly apart, and your arms loose beside you.” Draco did as he was told, shaking the coat from his shoulders and setting it to hover just away from them, and did the same to his jumper. He could feel Potter’s eyes on him as he arranged himself in the requested pose, the fine hairs on his arms prickling with it.
“You’re in luck, Harry,” Hermione said, wiping oatmeal from Hugo’s sticky fingers while Ron applied his best negotiation skills to Rosie, who apparently wasn’t especially keen on wearing socks with her shoes this morning. “My parents are picking up the kids in about five minutes and taking them to a film. Rose saw the poster for Brave on the side of a bus weeks ago and has not stopped asking about it. She thinks she looks just like the princess.” Hermione pushed back a thicket of her own hair, and gave her daughter an appraising look. “She has a point, but I’m not sure I’m keen on her being exposed to the Muggle version of witches and magic at such an impressionable age.”
Hermione beamed at him, and Harry tried to focus on safely making the turn into the laneway that led to the car park of the cafe, without rolling the Polo into a ditch and killing them all, or any of Ron’s precious deer.
Devlin shifted his cargo from one arm to the other, and fished a file from within the folds of his robes, its cover an instantly recognisable Auror red. Harry took it from him and flipped to the first page case summary. “Apparently there’s evidence suggesting this-” Harry gestured towards a disturbingly wobbling knob. “Devlin, you’d better put those down. So, the Auror investigation has uncovered evidence that this was the result of a cursed Muggle object.” Harry lifted a trio of large crime scene photographs from the file and showed them to Devlin, arms now free of his burden. A dirt-caked dildo was pictured at the bottom of a shallow hole in what was presumably Throttlebottom’s garden; the next was a somewhat blurry shot of an Auror lifting the thing out of the hole, the lack of focus probably a result of the photographer shaking with laughter. Harry recognised the symptoms; nearly all of Ron’s stag night pictures had ended up in the same condition, as Neville had been designated the official photographer, and proved to be an exceptionally giggly drunk.
After a little while, Harry became as absorbed in his work as he usually did, without the thought of the unpleasantness of the client particularly bothering him, and so by the end of the day he had a set of twelve test tubes with samples from the magical dicks floating in a variety of potions and solutions, each designed to reveal particular properties in the magic and material of the specimen. There were four more with samples from the original Muggle dildo, which was all Harry was willing to risk, in case he damaged the thing to the point where he could no longer extract a magical signature from it. At this point, there were no spares, and no reason to believe there were any others out there in the world, just waiting to cause trouble. Three intact knobs had been planted in fresh soil, to see whether they would sprout independently of the original. The remaining branches had been carefully enclosed in a preservation charm, as had Dildo Prime, and there was really little else Harry could do from the office until his tests were complete.
God, the bedroom stank of it. Sweat, and spunk, and sour morning breath. With a gesture his bedroom window slid open, letting in a most welcome puff of cold, fresh air. He needed a Berocca, and a shower, and a very large cup of tea, and some eggs. In that order, and as soon as possible.
“Hm. I suppose the tone of surprise is only slightly offensive.” Draco watched as a handful of gems rained down into the bottom of the hourglass. “I do wish that thing would fill up a little quicker, however.”
“Yeah.” Harry abandoned the spoon and turned the heat off, and used both arms to finally gather Draco to him properly. “Dinner’s ready. Do you want parmesan on top?”
“He’s twenty-three,” Potter bit his shoulder. “And no, I wasn’t about to let him within an inch of my cock. Not a star fucker.” No, Potter wouldn’t like that. That explained the rock hard erection Potter was currently grinding into Draco’s tailbone, then.
“You done?” Her glass was half full, but the cherries were long gone. She shrugged, and slid off the stool with consummate grace, even in that dress, and those heels. She didn’t need the rest of a half-flat, watered down cocktail. She only came here for his sake, anyway.
It was almost funny, so Draco barked a short laugh, and turned to look briefly into Potter's earnest eyes.
“Salazar’s tits!” At least half his prosecco spilled into the water. “Bog! What the hell are you doing here?”
“And all I want for my best mate is the same kind of happiness. Lovely, kind, cuddlers are not for him. He needs someone who’s going to drive him up the wall, because he loves that. Loves arguing, loves being put in his place by someone smarter than he is. He needs someone who will call him out for his bullshit. It’s not all fights and fucking for ‘Mione and me, and it won’t be for you either, but I know when I start to get dark thoughts about things, she’s going to pull me up by the hair if they start to get the better of me. She’s the first person whose opinion I want when I’ve got a problem. The first person I want to talk to when something good happens, or something bad. You two have been in each other’s heads for so bloody long, in so many ways. Just let it evolve into the next phase, already, you knob.”
.” Draco popped the ‘p’ as much as he could manage with vodka numbed lips. “Anyway, there was a fire at our school and he dragged me out. I would have died. Now he’s grown up and he’s a-” Draco fumbled for the Muggle word, “-detective. Still saving the helpless, with his big arms and thighs.” He sighed. “So, to answer your question, he looks like a hero. With round glasses and green eyes, and sex hair - black sex hair.” Draco very quietly eased out a vodkary belch. “And scars all over the place, but the best one’s right on his head, it sort of zigzags and bisects his eyebrow.” He looked at Cabbage Head, who seemed dumbfounded. Probably never heard the word ‘bisected’ before. “That means it cuts through-”
“Harpies thumped the Prides...best on pitch...Ginevra Weasley.” Harry grinned. “That’s my girl. Now...Cannons, Cannons, Can-...ah. Well, I suppose that’s a topic which might be best avoided.” He pinched the tabbed string of his tea bag between two fingers, and swished it in a slow circle around the perimeter of his cup. A neat stack of toast sat on a plate between himself and his newspaper, and the butter had melted into a warm golden puddle on top. Harry folded the paper in half, then half again, and propped it up against the sugar bowl so he could skim the classifieds, whilst cupping his tea with both hands. The mornings were getting just this side of nippy lately, and he would need to get into the habit of setting a fire in the old potbellied stove again, as the kitchen was large, and he was pants at Warming charms.
Draco was pressing slack kisses to his shoulder. “You've done something to me. Turned me soft.” Harry tightened his arms. “This is the real reason Blaise is jealous. You think of me, you want to do things for me that make me happy. If those things happen to include gorgeous and expensive clothing and accessories, all the better for me. Blaise wishes he had what we have.” He kissed Harry slightly more firmly. “I’d be happy with just the steak and pudding, and you.”
Draco paused, then replied. “Well, I think he was just surprised to see me, and I’m wearing the Slytherin colours today, so...maybe I just provoked a little bit of our old rivalry. Nothing for you to worry about, my darling,” Draco crouched in front of Teddy, and pushed back his fringe. “I mean it.” Draco twisted and pointed up to the stands. “I’m going to be right up there all day.”
Ron began to lay the chicken out into the hot skillet, and the kitchen was filled with sizzling. “Anything can happen in life, I don’t know that I’d avoid a relationship just because it might end.”
Potter laughed, and shooed Cabbage Head off. “Maybe we could start with a drink and see where it takes us.”
“Sir?” Vicky stood at the door, a cup of tea in hand. Harry felt his ears redden. “Shall I come back at a better time?”
Harry tightened his arm around Malfoy’s waist, and let his fingertips trace a feather-light path around his belly button.
Easing himself onto his elbows, Harry looked at his third chosen item - the prostate one - and tried to convince himself to have one last go. Maybe those other things had just not been right for him. Maybe he’d just wanked off far too much already. With determination, he spread his legs and carefully lubed one finger, gently opening himself just enough for the slender wand of the tickler to soon slip inside. He felt his cock begin to firm up again. An encouraging sign.
, as hard as he could, for the telly to turn off. Draco had both hands in his hair, one pushed roughly into the wild mess at the top of his head, the other cupped lovingly around the curve of the back of his skull, and Harry spared the smallest thought to the television, now abruptly silent, and hoped he hadn’t fried it in his enthusiasm to create the ideal environment to make Draco come, but most of his thought was on Draco himself, hot under Harry’s mouth and hands, shaking, gasping. Coming in his mouth with a rush of bitter salt, cursing and hoarse.
“He doesn’t think you’re the hottest Weasley,” Harry said immediately, and before he could stop himself, “And neither do I.”
“Unacceptable,” Draco muttered with fury, clearing a path through the muck with his wand as he struggled through the crowd to the lifts. Wix who were clearly less adept with charmwork held briefcases, and copies of the
Potter snorted. “Of course I’m having one.” He pulled open the drawer of a filing cabinet and lifted out a teapot, which wore a bobbly orange knitted cosy that bore the distinct hallmarks of a Molly Weasley creation.
“Fuck,” he said under his breath, trying not to breathe in the combined pong of droppings and sweat too deeply. If the owls were gone, wizarding government was about to grind to a slow but certain halt. No wonder he’d been called in. This needed to be sorted quickly.
Malfoy just kept smiling at him and turned towards the club entrance. “Come along, Potter. I find myself quite thirsty, all of a sudden.” Malfoy slid his hands into his trouser pockets, and the fabric pulled tighter across his arse. Christ, Malfoy’s arse was unfairly perfect. The last thing he needed was to start getting hard in these jeans. Harry followed, doing his best not to stare at Malfoy’s backside directly, with mixed results.
Ron, however, looked back and forth between Harry and Malfoy with great interest. “Shag, marry, kill!”
“I agree. I’d suggest we start with programming the query for the archives, and the permits for the Ward Room. That stuff will take some time, we can do the Owlery while they’re processing.”
There was no reason why this should be so erotic, Draco told himself sternly, as he tried to keep limber and calm. Potter smelled like chocolate, what of it? He’d lost the small Seeker’s build from their school days, and was now something bulkier, and rougher. Who cared? Not Draco Malfoy. Potter’s magic felt effervescent, like being submerged in fizzy water. He looked at Draco now and then like he might like to take off all his clothes and put his hands everywhere underneath. He was terribly warm, and had Draco mentioned the thing about the chocolate? Oh yes, he had. Mouthwatering, horrible chocolate that nobody in their right mind would want to put their mouth all over. Disgusting. Terrible. No good at all.
Potter’s hands slid roughly over his hips, rucking up his tshirt, his fingers spreading low on Draco’s belly and scratching through the fine hair there. He thumbed the top button of his jeans, and Draco drew in a sharp breath. “Think I’ll abuse my position again right now,” Potter said, and slid his palm straight down into Draco’s pants, palming his erection. His hand was hot, and too dry, Draco couldn’t help the way his body moved, his spine arching against Potter’s chest, head dropping back onto Potter’s shoulder. “I saw you out there with Zabini. He had his hands all over you, right here,” Potter scraped his teeth over the nape of Draco’s neck. “You fucking him, now?”
fair. Malfoy growing up hot was unfair. Harry growing up to be a workaholic with no sex life was most certainly un-fucking-fair. Sodding Balter Throttlebottom bossing him about was right up there, too. All he’d wanted was
In hindsight, Harry wished he’d been more careful with his phrasing. He didn’t have any proof, but sometimes it seemed that all you needed to do to manifest a thing, was to name it, and the bad choices started as soon as the second round had reached the table.
Harry realised with a start that Malfoy was standing right beside him, a look of restrained amusement on his face, and he waved his wand at Harry and the seemingly endless rolls of parchment that were unfurling completely against his will in every direction, and the scroll coiled up with a snap. “I do, yeah.”
Ron threw up his hands. “C.U.M., go, I couldn’t give a fuck really, as long as I can get on with some actual work instead of wasting my team’s time on ridiculous pranks.”
“I can’t believe two out of three of my best friends have seen my privates,” Harry said faintly. He’d really lost control of this whole outing.
Hermione fiddled with her own serviette, a slight cringe passing over her face. “Well, it didn’t start out with a betting pool, that was really Seamus’ doing-”
, on Saturdays - so many little routines Draco had become accustomed to, took comfort in. Draco remembered the first time he'd worked out how to read the television guide, and had seen the name there and remembered Pansy, and hurt. He must have whispered the name, because Potter took the paper from his hands, and asked in a low voice whether Draco would like to watch it. It wasn't what he'd expected - he wasn't sure
he managed to fuck him through it, still hard for a little longer, just long enough, until it started to hurt him too.
would have his loyalty for as long as there was a Lovegood in the editor’s chair. But Ginny was supposed to be at the family dinner that evening at the Burrow, and Harry had somehow managed to sleep through the sports update the night before on the wireless. If he showed up without knowing the Harpies place on the league table, Ginny would kick his arse, which would be entertaining for everyone other than Harry, and Hermione might accuse him of being a workaholic again based purely on one ill-timed nap. He could frankly live without a repeat of the dreaded intervention of 2008. Hence, the early edition of the
“Hmm – that’s not what came immediately to mind.” A giggling couple jostled past them, and Potter was pushed against Draco’s shoulder. He could feel Potter’s chest pressed hard against his back, and Draco was more determined than ever not to turn his head even an inch, due to the utterly infuriating flush creeping steadily up his neck. It was a source of never ending frustration to him that Potter had this effect; he was a man of thirty, for pity’s sake, thirty-one and three-quarters if you were keeping score, and the days of turning into a sweating, stammering, red-faced, walking erection should be well and truly over. And yet.
“Don’t talk about you and Hermione splitting up,” Harry said with alarm. “You’re the only parents I’ve ever known!”
, so…” Potter smiled at him, and Draco felt certain the goofy face was back again. “Besides, I don’t plan on staying retired for long. After a week, you can re-hire me as your security and risk consultant.”
Harry tried not to laugh. “You’re not even paying attention to me. I kind of expected more from you, Parkinson.”
There’d been no preening in the tent while looking for Horcruxes, that was certain. Dark circles under his eyes, face sharp from hunger and stress, and a patchy mess of teenaged stubble that, topped with a lopsided haircut courtesy of Hermione, just made him look dirty, and shabby, and more like a boy than a man. In his whole life, the only mirror he’d spent any real time looking at was the one he’d used to communicate with Aberforth. And Erised, of course, but he wasn't really looking at himself in either of those.
Oh good grief, Harry was sweating. “Erm.” Malfoy looked away for a moment and thrust his hand into the brown paper carry bag, and the very next moment, slapped an enormous blue-green dildo onto the bench in front of Harry.
Malfoys eyes crinkled at the edges when he smiled. “Hello again.” He had a medium sized paper carry bag. “I’ve brought you things.”
“Yes, and he’ll have to stay that way for a little while longer while my team works through our existing caseload.”
had he done it? He'd hardly dared to imagine it, doing that, he'd hardly ever let himself go there with his thoughts. But sometimes, he couldn't help it - he found himself poking at that part of his mind like a tongue pokes a damaged tooth. Those feelings had been in there, growing quietly like a cavity, for a long time now. A weakness. Ever since the war, perhaps. Undoubtedly it flourished during his time at Hogwarts as the gamekeeper. He hadn't wanted to acknowledge it, oh no, he hadn't wanted to
Potter smiled reassuringly. “‘Course not, mate.” Draco crouched down, and Potter lifted Teddy off his shoulders, swung him around a few times until he was laughing again, and then sent him on his way to his grandmother. As soon as he was out of earshot, Potter’s jaw clenched. “We need to talk.”
Draco flushed, a full-bodied thing. Helga’s tits. “I told you I was in bed when I was called in. And on my holidays. Forgive me if I didn’t have time for knickers. And also, no one's forcing you to look.”
She paged through the wine list, a veritable tome bound in leather. “Coincidence, of course. Just out for a drink. Though, since you’re here too, I thought it might be nice to catch up with you, since you haven’t been around much lately.”
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look over the top of their cards. Ginny was supposed to be his partner, but she’d wandered off to get another jug of Pimm’s and ginger, and Harry wished she’d hurry up because he was pants at remembering the rules for Five Hundred, and also he was getting rather thirsty.
The third picture was a close-up of the base of the toy. Most of the dirt had been brushed away, and a row of raised numbers was visible, probably some sort of model code, or serial number, along with a distinct stamp declaring ‘MADE IN CHINA’. Harry sighed. Definitely Muggle. And almost certainly tampered with by magic, if the potato-like roots creeping from the underside were any indication. “Mr Weasley said it was rather urgent, sir.”
Malfoy said it lazily, after looking up from his cauldron, and fixing Harry with a lingering, assessing look. Harry hadn’t even managed to ask the question. He’d barely managed to say Malfoy’s name.
Harry felt the blood drain rapidly from his face, only to come roaring back seconds later, with force. Of course Draco Malfoy would be the attendant of the only sex shop he’d ever set foot in.
Draco looked away as he huffed out a laugh, and Ginny walloped Ron as hard as she could on the thigh. They argued for a while, and Draco didn’t look at the way the light wind tousled Potter’s curls, or the way his track pants seemed to cup his thighs around the hamstring. He definitely didn’t watch Potter squint in the late morning sun, tracking the Snitch, or crouching to talk to the kids on his team with a wide smile.
“Let’s lock in the last weekend in March,” Draco said, and Harry felt his stomach turn over a bit. That was only two weeks away. If he got started on Monday when Draco was back at Hogwarts for the week, he could probably get through a room an evening, and Draco would never need to know. Easy as falling off a broom.
“Go ahead,” Draco said, straightening up and brushing non-existent grass from his knees. “That was the point of sending him away, was it not?”
It was almost incendiary, the burning feeling in his fingertips, desperate to touch Malfoy, to take him by the hips and press him against the bevelled edge of the bar, and to take down his carefully casual bun and get his fingers into his hair, wrap the long, silvery strands around his fingers. His mouth nearly stung with wanting it, the press of imagined kisses on his lips and tongue. But there was also the heavier flame of disappointment, there. He could hear what Malfoy was saying, without saying it in so many words. Just friends.
“Well,” Draco said, as if picking up a conversation they’d been having for hours, but which had probably mostly been going on silently in his own head. “We need a room for Mother, since she’ll be coming in from Mayenne a few days before.” Draco was stretched to his full extent on the settee, his head in Harry’s lap, and his feet up on the velvet curve of the arm. It was almost getting warm enough to forgo a fire, but there was just enough chill in the March evenings that they could still enjoy its cozy warmth. The glow from the hearth, and yesterday’s cricket replay on the television flickered in the otherwise pleasantly dark sitting room, the only other light a buttery yellow lamp behind them that gave Draco just enough illumination to see his infamous pad with.
He let go of Harry’s face and let his hand come to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “Good boy. Now. How did he make you feel? Let’s talk it out, Potter.”
Potter smiled at him; just a tiny smile on his lips, but his eyes seemed to burn with it. Potter's eyes always seemed to be burning with something, with happiness, or humour, or anger, or pain. Draco imagined it must be tiresome to have such expressive eyes. Never able to hide what you think, or feel. To draw people unto yourself whether you wanted to or not.
“How dare you,” Draco said, his voice cracking slightly in the middle. Potter got up and made his way around the desk, and sat on the edge right beside Draco’s chair. Draco swallowed. Potter pushed Draco’s chair back from the desk with his foot, and leaned on the arm rest, his arms effectively trapping Draco in his seat, his frustratingly green stare apparently impossible to resist.
Malfoy pressed the enormous tip of the dildo against the shiny, wet opening of the faux slit, and pushed steadily in. Harry had to look away, it was all a bit much. He Summoned a clipboard from one of the other benches, and tapped his wand against the first page of blank parchment clipped in, and frowned down at the information which began to efficiently transcribe onto the paper. He didn't absorb a word of it, but took a few moments to steady his breathing. He really was being completely ridiculous. He was thirty-two. He was head of his department, for fuck’s sake. Malfoy was unmistakably fit, but that was nothing new - Harry’d been well aware of that for many years.  Malfoy was in the gossip pages of the
“I know the owner well,” Malfoy said over his shoulder, and then the stairs ran out and they were in a large, open space that was filled with the deep, syrupy beat he could hear from outside. The bar itself wrapped around the entire right-hand side of the room, and the left was a series of booths and alcoves, small and large, with leather seats and narrow tables. But most of the room was taken up by the enormous dance floor, which was sunk three steps down, and which had a platform in the very centre in which  several people seemed to be setting up musical equipment. There were people testing lighting rigs, bartenders polishing glasses and slicing fruit. It was a hive of activity, and there was not a single other patron in sight but himself, and Malfoy.
lick the sculpted ice centrepiece.” They both followed Draco’s pointed finger, to see a swaying wizard looking amorously at the frozen dolphin with slightly puckered lips. “Secondly, take this tray back to the kitchen and tell the chef that if he would like to cater another Ministry function at any point in the foreseeable future he will do a far better job at the
a chore, for either of them. If they wanted, they could spend squillions eating out or ordering in breakfast every single day. They did, in fact, eat the rest of their meals at restaurants or take-away, mostly, and they could do it for breakfast too, if they wanted. Hermione had missed the point entirely, but Harry supposed it was hard not to think of it as a daily chore when you had two children, as she and Ron did, not to mention a sensible budget. The point was, Draco and Harry did not have to do
Blaise seconded the plan, and Theo could always be counted on to vote with the majority. So out Draco was, in tight-fitting dark trousers and a white tshirt that was really more of a suggestion of clothing than anything of substance, propping up the bar at a place he couldn’t remember the name of, with a shot of something clear in front of him, and neon light all around.
interrupting!” Potter raised his hands in capitulation. “I’m sure you worked very hard, Potter, in fact I have no doubt you could have been the king of the Aurors if you hadn’t quit the Corps. But you didn’t. Instead, you had the sudden urge to migrate to my little patch of the Ministry and you made yourself at home. You’ve bypassed the natural hierarchy and went straight to the top with practically no experience, and now I’m stuck trying to navigate around you to get the work of this department done, while Undersecretary Scrivener stares at you across the boardroom table with hearts in his eyes!”
Harry never really looked at himself. Never had done. He’d never had much time or reason to. There hadn’t been a mirror in his cupboard, nor much light to see with even if there had been, and the bathroom was a place he’d hurried through once a week while the Dursley’s were at their Sunday morning service, carefully wiping every trace of water and steam from the mirrors and tiles afterwards with his scratchy, musty towel. Whenever he looked at himself in those days, it was to see a pale and skinny goblin staring back, too small, with scruffy hair and crooked, broken glasses. A freak in second hand clothes. It was better not to look at all, to let his focus slide past that unfortunate creature and concentrate on the task at hand.
“Erm,hello - I was there last night, and I just wondered, if anyone had handed in a leather jacket?”
, and a party to celebrate that with all their friends and family sounded like the best sort of party to be had.
He gave Harry another look, another smile, and withdrew a business card from his trousers. “If you decide you’re ready for more than a look,” Orange Singlet Paul pushed the card into the front pocket of Harry’s jeans, and leaned in close again. “Give me a call.” He grinned cheekily and gave Harry a brief peck on the cheek. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Harry Gorgeous.”
“You love it,” Draco said dismissively, sitting down at the old kitchen table and clicking the end of the pen several times. “Right, guest list. I’ll start.”
wandless magic, and non-verbal spells, there’s no moment of hesitation; you’re completely sure of your capability. The way you were as an Auror, your work now, you follow every thread to its conclusion; that takes a lot of determination and stamina, does it not?” Harry nodded absently. Bloody hell. “But then there's this curious
had he asked? Harry’s embarrassment felt like it might become terminal. He cleared his throat and drew his eyebrows into what he hoped was a serious furrow. “Malfoy, are you aware of the current situation regarding the Chief Warlock’s garden?”
“It’s my birthday, Draco,” Potter caught him by the wrist when Draco turned to go. “I was kind of hoping I’d get my cock sucked by a pissy blond tonight.” Draco turned to look Potter straight in the eye, then, cold fury growing in his chest like that stupid fucking drink. He smiled, and Potter relaxed, like the oblivious idiot he was. Any sensible person would be in retreat, by now. Anybody who actually knew Draco, would know that smile meant nothing good. Draco slid his wrist free from Potter’s grip, and turned, caught the eye of Potter’s adolescent groupie, and applied his most tempting smile. Crooked his fingers in an unmistakable invitation to join them. The blond nearly tripped in his haste to get around to their side of the bar.
“ We’ll see when the donations have been tallied in full at midnight, and if we’ve met or exceeded the target, I will gladly acknowledge your so-called genius.”
There was a moment’s pause before Ginny thumped him hard on the shoulder. “Merlin’s tits Harry, I thought you were going to tell us you’re terminally ill!”
“A Muggle film. There’s a rather homoerotic volleyball scene that I think you’d enjoy.” Draco raised his eyebrows at her, and mentally made a note. She looked around them: at the modern chandelier made of rectangular acrylic pieces above them, the depressing grey-on-grey decor. “This place is certainly...masculine.”
Potter opened the door of the cabinet at the front of the room and levitated a thick, red leather register and a sheaf of forms over to the table. Draco sat, Summoned a quill, and got to work on the 2782.
“Why not both, sweetheart?” He cast silently, and slicked his petting fingers with oil. “Fucking and playing don’t have to be mutually exclusive.”
“We’ve had the pleasure of your company on many occasions over the years, Mr Potter, and despite what you’ve been through, there’s no sign there that you have anything malicious lingering to pass on to your children.” He raised one eyebrow at Harry, “Though you may like to think about your career choices if you plan to be the one carrying.”
“What - oh, come on, be serious. We went on one very awkward date, like two years before you and I got together, and there was no chemistry whatsoever. I work with her all the time on big event security!”
“Can’t win them all,” Draco said. He pushed a thick document across the desk. “The good news is, your valiant sacrifice today wasn’t for nothing, and I was able to get the Quodpot contracts sorted on time, as well as complete my evaluation of the proposed updates to the Quidditch League regulations. The bad news is, now you have to go through them as well. My notes are in green.” Potter looked at the regulations forlornly. “Oh, enough with the pathetic face. It’s after five, we can worry about it tomorrow. Besides,” Draco said casually. “I believe there was some discussion about a special reward.”
Draco’s hair tickled his face, and Harry reached up blindly, still half asleep and without his specs. “No. I don’t want you to go. I’m keeping you here with me.” He managed to pull Draco down on top of him, and Draco went, laughing softly.
It took nearly all of their visit for Draco to gather the courage to tell his cousin that he wouldn’t be able to make it to his upcoming Junior Quidditch round-robin tournament.
Condensation dripped down the side of Weasley’s pint glass and gathered on the table. This wasn’t the sort of place that handed out beer mats. “What else is there, then, if all that stuff’s out?”
“Please,” Harry said, and after a moment, “Sorry for being so arsey.” Vicky politely said nothing, and left to fetch the tea.
Despite the best efforts of both Hermione and the wardrobe, however, Harry still found himself with nothing to wear and a rising sense of impending doom.
Malfoy still hadn’t said anything. He seemed to be thinking, watching Harry while swirling the mead in his glass idly. Harry laughed nervously, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck and then over his face. “It’s pathetic, right? I’m pathetic.”
“Good for you, Potter,” Malfoy said, swirling the last of his tea around the well of his cup. “I’ll owl you with the details.” He stood, and Vanished his cup. “Time for me to head off, as delightful as this has been.”
Summer means more people out and about, so there are more accidents, altercations, and the heatwave makes people quick to anger. Drunk, disorderly, publicly nude, urinating in locations they definitely shouldn’t be urinating - memorably, they booked a pair of stallholders selling charmed sunglasses and hats to unsuspecting Muggles at Bournemouth beach. Charmed, not cursed, but they were making a killing out of unassuming straw hats and plastic sunnies, imbued with cooling and shading spells. They’d needed nearly the whole division out on the sand to track down all those happy customers.
Harry took a swipe at her foot, but she moved away too quickly. “Nothing much. Fire-breathing toasters, biting tea cups and toilet seats. A few weeks ago we confiscated a batch of cosmetics which turned people permanently orange. That almost completely evaded detection over the summer as most of the victims had recently been on hols in Magaluf and looked pretty much orange as it was, between the fake tan and the sunbathing.”
Potter leaned forward in his chair. “I think I worked pretty hard myself, Malfoy – being an Auror isn’t exactly a walk in the park.”
Malfoy sipped his tea, and crossed his legs at the knee. “Would you care to talk about it?” Harry gave him a look before dropping his head again. Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I think you’ll find I’m quite a good listener, Potter. And I’ve heard quite a lot of peculiar shit in my time.”
Potter lifted off for as long as it took him to shove his joggers, underwear and all, down to his ankles, and pulled them free of his ankles and trainers in one go. He then hoisted Draco by the hips and pulled his pyjamas down to his knees, and dropped him back onto the settee, and climbed onto his lap again. “This is going to be fast,” Potter warned, Conjuring a handful of almond oil, and wrapping his palm around both their cocks. Draco hissed with pleasure, and dragged his face back down to his lips, and they moved together, breathing together, hips snapping up in tandem into the tight circle of Potter’s long fingers. Draco couldn’t take his hands from Potter’s face, tracing his jaw, his cheeks, the shell of his ear, trailing his fingers up and down his throat and sinking them again and again into the soft heat of his curls.
He’d even fucked a woman once, jet black pixie cut with clear green eyes, and little tits that he’d enjoyed feeling in his palms far more than he’d expected he would. She’d looked remarkably like him, just smaller. He hadn’t had to try very hard to come, although the absence of another cock was disconcerting (and he had no idea what to do about the hard, slick little lump she had between her folds, though she seemed to have that well in hand, as it were), as was the absence of even a solitary strand of pubic hair. Why would anyone get rid of all that hair? Draco liked hair, all over, rough and dark, holding on to all the pheromones, and body odour. He imagined Potter would be rather hairy. He imagined it all the time. Sometimes he imagined it all over his sheets, or his fingers, or occasionally the inside of his pants.
“The one that used to reduce hardened criminals to custard in the interrogation room,” Hermione replied mildly. Ron wisely kept silent. “Let’s change the subject. How’s your love life?”
Harry blushed and looked at the bottles lined up on the glass shelves behind her. “Yes, Malfoy’s very kind to take me out.”
“You are mad,” Draco said fondly. He let Potter put his arms around him, and settled comfortably against his chest. Now that he was used to him, he really couldn’t imagine not having Potter around the office. He really couldn’t remember what it had been like before he’d joined the team, to be honest. “Can I tell you a something no one else knows?”
“Bloody hell, Draco,” Longbottom splashed gracelessly toward him. “Are you aware of how you look?” Draco looked at him blankly, and Longbottom shook his head, and laughed. He was in an actual wetsuit, which was probably smarter. “It’s a good thing it’s just us here or we’d get nothing done.”
Malfoy shrugged, grabbed an enormous handful of crisps - Harry’s favourite, apple cider flavoured; they were supposed to
Draco heaved, and rolled them both over slightly. Harry grabbed the back of the settee for balance, lest he roll any further and end up on the floor. “You don’t expect to live past ninety?”
“Catastrophic, actually,” said Draco, strongly resisting the urge to follow Pierce to the loos to hide out until the worst was over. “Not only do they look appalling on a man with as scrawny a neck as the Undersecretary, but in the many years I’ve worked for him, nothing good has ever happened on a cravat day.”
“I’m here with some friends,” Cabbage said, “I’m going to join them now. You’re welcome, if you’d like.”
“Hands off, that one’s an heirloom. And yes, God exists in the wizarding world too, Potter. Do you think we were just celebrating Easter and Christmas at school with no idea who Jesus was?”
Draco stared at him. Obviously, Weasley was referring to Potter, and yes, perhaps Draco had been staring at him a bit while thinking about his ruined holiday, but that was purely an accident.
“But can’t you ask your boss to let you have the weekend off?” Teddy’s hair faded from plankton blue, to a familiar white blond. Draco felt like arsehole of the year, which he probably was, at this point, considering nearly all the old Death Eaters were gone. “What if we called Uncle Harry and got him to change it? He’s one of the bosses, isn’t he? He could make them give you a day off!”
“Hiding.” He watched Weasley take a few more nuts from the dish. “How did you find me here, actually?”
Draco jogged down the wooden steps of the stand, doing his best not to look anywhere but where his feet were going. He wouldn’t look for Potter in the stands. It didn’t matter where he was. He needed Teddy to see he was here, and that he stayed the whole day. He made it to the mouth of the the players entrance just as kids were starting to pour out.
Logic only slowed Ron down for a moment. “How about you come to our place, and look after the kids for a few hours while me and Hermione go out for a pint, then?”
“Don’t you think he would have given me any sort of clue, if that were the case? It’s been six months, Granger. He’s never made any sort of gesture in front of our friends to show we’re anything more than friendly work colleagues. He’s never asked me to stay the night. We see each other at work, or the Mallard, or for as long as it takes for us to get off at his place. Look, it’s my fault for getting carried away with it.” Draco shook his head. “I knew when I went home with him the first time that I’d made a mistake, but I did it anyway. I’m not a good person, I know that, but I’m trying to do good things. Make better decisions.” He looked away. The bar was a watery blur around him. “I’ll come to the tournament, I’ll come to everything for Teddy, I promise you that. But I need to be nothing to Potter, because I can’t handle being nothing much.”
“It’s bespoke. I made it, the charm and the glass,” Malfoy said, still watching his customers. Harry stared at him, until Malfoy noticed, and turned his attention back to Harry. “You seem surprised. Always underestimating my talents, Potter, which I should warn you are considerable, and,” Malfoy’s eyes dropped briefly to Harry’s mouth, and Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. “And quite diverse. It’s basically a modified Foe Glass, but instead of showing me my enemies, it shows me my customers. Quite a tricky bit of magic, that; I had to dismantle one to work it out, and they’re very expensive. I went through five before I had it worked out. The spellwork on how to create them isn’t especially easy to lay one's hands on, either. But I do like a challenge.”
Out of bed, wand located (under the mound of duvet), sheets and pillow slips stripped from the bed and Banished to the washing hamper. Pile of clothing following swiftly behind. New linen on, duvet shaken briskly and re-laid neatly over the fresh sheets, everything tucked away with tidy hospital corners - a silent moment of thanks to Molly Weasley who had taught all her boys the necessary housekeeping spells, and well - pillows vigorously fluffed and arranged in the correct order. Cup restored back to being 50p, and coins sent marching downstairs to be relocated in the designated jar with their fellows on the front hall stand. Curtains opened a little wider to let the cool air better circulate, and to finally chase the bewitching dim gold of the night before away with the fresh, white sunshine of an autumn morning.
It was a large clock, entirely made of crystal with a gold face. It was horrible, tacky, heavy, and apparently of no sentimental value.
Draco could imagine a great many things Potter may be good for, unfortunately, and many of them crossed his mind as he watched Potter kneel on the stone floor of the Ward Room, a map of England unfolding in front of him, and a small glowing globule of magic hovering just above it.
No, he bloody wasn’t. He was one deep breath of Potter’s shampoo away from swooning backwards and directly off his stool. “It’s afternoon, Potter,” Draco said, a little hoarse, pointing to the large clock above them. Potter squinted at it, and pushed his glasses up his nose.
. Draco pushed open the kitchen door and slid inside, stupidly close to the wall as if he could somehow hide himself in the pale, shabby wallpaper.
Harry’s knees wobbled, and Ron hoisted him up again. “No, I mean, we both think you’re hot. Ron,” Harry stopped mid-flight, and grabbed Ron by the shoulders earnestly. “Ron, you’re hot, you’re objectively hot, but you’re not the
“Steady on, Potter. I think Roger’s had quite enough, don’t you?”  Harry ceased thrusting, and looked wildly at Malfoy, whose brows once again climbed towards his hairline. “Ok-aaay,” Malfoy said slowly and calmly, letting go of Roger’s buttocks and gently removing the dildo from Harry’s hands. It decoupled from Roger with a slick pop. “Perhaps we could take a quick break, Potter, what do you think?” Malfoy’s voice was quiet and soothing, and he removed his gloves with efficient movements. Harry was feeling a bit hot and faint, and he clumsily mimicked Malfoy’s actions until both gloves were scrunched on the bench.
“That curse was shit,” Harry said, too sore and tired to move over to his side. Anyway, it might be nice to sleep on Draco’s pillow for a few nights. Just while he got better. “Don’t tell Draco.”
“I didn’t take the samples. I didn’t consult on the case. Potter’s just throwing his weight around.”
Potter looked up at him quizzically, and Draco gestured to the end of the settee which had Potter's feet on it. Potter's eyes widened. Draco was worried for a moment that Potter would say no, as Potter stared at him, but then he sort of scrambled around, dislodging cushions, and made space for him where his legs had been before.
“Yeah,” Harry said, his throat a bit dry. Malfoy’s trousers were so black they seemed to absorb light, and his shirt was teal. Harry wasn’t certain when he’d learned to identify teal from other kinds of green, but if he had to guess it was probably around the time he’d learned about Burberry.
The question was so unexpected that Draco almost didn’t understand. He laughed, breathless and delirious. Potter was jacking him roughly. “The only cock Blaise is interested in is his own.”
Draco smiled at him. Full of affection. His hair was all over the place, because of Harry’s hands, and his mouth was a bit red where Harry’s stubble had scraped his skin.
The door slammed open a second time, and Potter burst in. “I had no idea, honestly. Are you okay?” Potter’s glasses fogged in the humid air almost instantly, and he took them off and spelled them clear, before replacing them on his nose and staring at Draco with owlish concern.
This wasn’t that kind of problem. This was the kind of problem where Draco had fucked his life, as thoroughly as he’d fucked Potter’s body, and no matter what he did next the retreat would tear chunks of him off in the process.
“Oh, have a day off, would you Malfoy?” Potter had spotted the tin of paperclips on Draco’s desk, and was reaching for the lid. Draco’s wand had rapped Potter hard across the knuckles before his brain even registered the command to do so, and Potter let out a yowl of pain. “What was that for?” He rubbed his other hand hard over his now red fingers. “I just wanted to know how you get them all to sit so perfectly in their place without getting caught in a great big tangle, that’s all!”
“Calm your tits, Potter,” Malfoy said, with a shrug and a smile. “I’ve had my fair share. I was a spoiled child, don’t forget.”
Ted leaned heavily into Draco’s side. He was almost ten, and growing like a weed. Draco pulled him in for a proper hug. “I’m sorry I’ve disappointed you, little man.”
He turned Draco in a circle, until they were both laughing. “I’m going to quit the Aurors and come with you to Scotland, so we can be together every day and make lovely babies together.”
"We're friends," Potter interrupted fiercely, looking at Draco again. His eyes were shiny with the reflection of the telly. Draco felt hot inside and out. Potter considered him a friend? He didn't know that. It felt…good.
“Malfoy!” Ron bellowed, and slapped him on the back so hard Draco almost spilled his wine. “A little bird told me you’ve been transferred back onto the morning rotation. Shove over, would you, Parkinson.”
“Potter,” Potter said. “Harry Potter. And yes, I’ve worked in a very similar role, quite recently, actually.”
“I’ve only got ready meals, mostly from Marks ‘n Sparks, but they’re pretty good.” Potter leaned out from his examination of the refrigerator. “What about chicken and dumplings?”
were?” Malfoy snapped back. “Are you just going to grab my wand again like the mannerless oaf you are?”
tea cups and toilet seats?” Hermione asked almost absently, examining  a knitting pattern from the early seventies with interest. “It seems like one or the other will surface every few months.”
He sighed and flopped backwards. Behind him, a quaffle was in just the right spot for the back of his skull to rest inside it’s indent, and it smelled like new leather, and polish. “Lot’s of things. I couldn’t decide what exactly to do, so I got paralysed with indecision. I was too embarrassed to ask for help because I didn’t want anyone to know that people were giving me gifts like this all the time. There are over thirty brand new brooms in here, Draco -
“Trent done so soon?’ Draco gasped. “What happened, did you find out he has his N.E.W.T.S on Monday?”
Harry felt Draco’s fingers lightly stroking him through his tshirt. He was silent for a long moment. “I wish you felt you could talk to me about this.”
Ron stuck two Twiglet straws under his top lip, and turned seriously to Harry. “Vhen’re you goink to hask Falfoy out?” His pretend fangs fell immediately out and into his drink. “Fuck.”
“I like it best when you hold me down,” Potter replied, and Draco felt for a moment like he might spend himself right there and then. “What do
Weasley held up a hand. “Nobody cares, Malfoy. That’s truly the last thing on Harry’s mind. If he was worried about his privacy, he’d have put a passcode on the thing.” He looked around “What does a man have to do to get a drink around here?” Draco signalled the elf over, and Weasley ordered a beer. “So, Harry’s got it in his head that there’s some issue with you being traditional that’s stopping you from getting serious,” Weasley gave him a look. “How traditional are we talking?”
“Quite,” Blaise said, leaning forward and taking a sip of his latte. “How much money were you hoping to raise?”
Draco was just veering sharply towards a particularly bushy fern, when Potter did it. He prised the plastic lid from the take away cup, pulled out what was clearly a very soggy tea bag, considered it for a moment, and then put it in his mouth. The sharp, sucking noise was loud in the otherwise silent corridor, and Potter closed his eyes and made a happy sound, looking very much like a cat who had caught a mouse, the bedraggled cotton string of the tea bag hanging from one corner of Potter’s mouth like a skinny white tail. Draco felt the smile break across his face.
When he was at Hogwarts, he hadn't really wanted to look either; the ever present scar everyone was always judging him for, the embarrassing outfits, his father’s famous hair and mother’s famous eyes which sometimes felt like yet another burden the universe had bestowed on him. Still skinny, pale, unkempt-looking. Just the ugly little monster his Aunt had always told him he was.
The house was silent around him, only the creak of old eaves and the gentle tap of a branch against the window to interrupt the heavy quiet. With Kreacher now reluctantly retired to an aged elf community in Wales, Harry’s alone and never felt more so than now, at a loose end and filled with restless energy.
Nor did it make any sense that Potter might be acting like this just to stitch Draco up. For a start, he would know that this would immediately destroy any sort of cooperative working relationship they had formed over the last six months. Draco found himself staring deeply into the frozen eye of the sculpted ice dolphin at the buffet. Potter might not be ambitious but he liked his job, and had always wanted to do well at it. But more than that, Draco was fairly certain that Potter wouldn’t do something so needlessly cruel, not after all he had been through himself when the gossip rags had caught hold of the story behind his and Ginny Weasley’s break up so many years earlier.
Draco sipped from his teacup, reading through the near-complete report on the desk in front of him. His neck ached, and the first thing he planned to do when he got home was to draw a long bath, to be enjoyed with a bag of crisps and a cold glass of prosecco. Perhaps several. Verity Parsnip had been processed, questioned, and released on bail, and the owls were safely re-interred in the Owlery under the watchful eyes of the Keepers. A team of cleaners would work all night clearing the gunk from the Atrium, and a small fortune had been paid by the Bursary to several house-elf services.
Malfoy snorted. “There wasn’t much to memorise. Take this,” Harry obediently held out his hand to receive the little object. “I have homework for you. I want you to spend the day in bed, tomorrow. Spend time with yourself. Touch yourself. Think about what you like. Get to know what turns you on so you can tell someone else how you want to be touched. Unshrink this before you start - I think you’ll find it inspiring.”
Theo groaned loudly. Blaise shook his head. “I fucking knew this would happen. Well done, Icarus, you’ve finally flown too close to the sun.”
Draco was silenced for another long series of minutes, after which he couldn’t possibly claim that it wasn’t absolutely, positively, rock hard.
“Hey,” Potter said, soft, stepping closer. “Draco, why don’t you sit with me. Sit down. Let’s talk about this.”
“Look, I know you guys have some kind of tangled history, that I honestly couldn't be more interested in, because it sounds
Harry knew what he was going to eat, and when, and who would be there when he did, and there was no need to eat boiled corn or rice pudding, or sultanas, which he didn’t like, or anything else he didn’t fancy, and he could have as much or as little as he wished without anybody accusing him of being greedy and ungrateful, or needing fattening up.
Draco coughed. “Of course we are Potter, don’t be tedious.” He led the way out of the lift with his head held high, and walked directly to the little lean-to that served as an office for the Owl Keepers. Despite the openings high in the eaves, where the owls would come and go, the place smelled strongly of bird shit and oaty straw, with an underlying ferrous scent of blood, no doubt from their feed. The office itself was stuffy, and crammed to its limits with red-eyed Owl Keepers, some still sobbing into ragged tissues. “Merlin preserve us,” Draco muttered under his breath, before forcing his most comforting smile, and making the introductions.
It was soothing just to be with them, and the sound of their bickering, and the soft music on the wireless. The urge to blurt out something, however, anything, about his night with Malfoy was growing, sitting in his throat like a creature desperate to leap from his mouth.  Hermione typed furiously on her phone, tongue clamped between her teeth, occasionally lifting her eyes as they turned corners and took round-abouts. They soon turned from Queen’s Rd onto Chestnut Ave, and into Bushy Park. Ron’s face was pressed to the glass looking hopefully for signs of deer, but finding mostly cyclists. Ginny was absently releasing and catching a practice Snitch while arguing with Ron about the song currently playing. The flicker of its wings echoed the twitching feeling in Harry’s throat.
Malfoy tore his eyes away from the orchid, astonished. “How did you remember that? I don’t even remember telling you I wanted to do that.”
Draco was up and in his pants, Summoning his shirt, trousers, shoes - he hadn’t been wearing his uniform robes, they were probably in the locker in the change rooms still. It felt like his throat was closing up, choking him. He needed to not be naked anymore. He needed to get out of here. “Not at all, Potter, but thank you for the offer. I wouldn’t like to impose.”
Maybe that’s what made him do it. He wasn’t really thinking, between the beer that had slowed his thoughts a little, and the heat of the summer night, and the hotter stirrings in his chest. With his rational brain subdued for a moment, distracted for just a second, something else took charge, and he stepped forward and folded Malfoy - a very surprised Malfoy - into a hug.
Harry could feel the tips of his ears getting hot, and he scowled at the board. Honestly, the constant embarrassment was making him quite cross. He was
He didn’t really have an end to that sentence, but it didn’t matter anyway, as Potter had pressed him hard against the office door and seemed to be attempting to kiss the words right out of his mouth, and Draco felt the smile still persisting, and he wondered whether there would be any Thai food or cricket for either of them tonight.
“If I know Blaise, he’s going to get you to write letters of authenticity for some of this stuff, for the provenance.” They sat in the kitchen, sweaty and covered in little knicks from sharp edges of boxes, and small bruises from knocking into things and each other in the crowded space. Not so crowded anymore, with the day halfway done, and the room three quarters cleared, and a pile of lovely sandwiches and cold juice between them. Draco had a little speck of dijon in the corner of his mouth. He clipped the end of a cornichon with his sharp teeth, and chewed slowly. Harry knew his mouth would be tart with vinegar, and salty from the strong cheddar. “I think we should still be able to move things though, to the warehouse at his offices. We can go in one weekend and just power through it. After the party, though, when we have more time. I’ll wear some things from the present hoard and we can watch Blaise shit himself with jealousy about it.” Draco seemed to notice Harry staring at him. “What? What’s on my face?”
This was all dead useful, because as sartorially challenged as Harry was, he was even worse at hanging up after himself; the last straw had really been the time a spider had actually crawled out of his shirt pocket during a dinner out with Hermione and Ron. Both of them had been equally vexed with him when he’d confessed he’d picked the shirt up from a pile on the floor and hadn’t even bothered with an ironing charm for it. Apparently, everyone worth his salt knew you shouldn't leave your clothes in piles if you didn't want pockets full of spiders. Harry had reminded them that he’d grown up under the stairs, and having pockets full of spiders was basically normal as far as he knew, but for once neither of his friends had let him get away with that as an excuse. Ron’s lecture had come from behind the safety of Hermione’s hair, while she gently Levitated the spider out the front door of the restaurant and into a hanging basket of summer flowers. Sometimes Harry still thought about Ron’s face that night, when he needed cheering up.
“Draco Malfoy,” Ron said, sounding exactly like the host of the worst sort of game show. “Shag, marry, kill!”
“You piss like a hippogriff mate, you know this. Hermione has definitely had this conversation with you before.”
“It was ten years ago,” Ginny said, slapping her card down triumphantly, and taking the trick. It was eleven years, actually, but Harry didn’t bother to point that out.
Draco smiled even more widely, and shook his head. “No. Of course you don’t. I’m sure this was the very first time.” Draco resumed his original course toward his own office, and Potter jogged along the hall to catch up.
Once the children were safely buckled into the Granger’s car and away on their own adventure, the grown ups came through the hearth before setting off in Harry’s, stopping briefly to pick up Ginny at her flat in Strawberry Hill.
He rang off somewhat awkwardly, and Harry tried to concentrate on the remainder of the spell dissection which was presently the only thing he
Neat though it may be, it was also boring as fuck and borderline middle-aged, which was depressing, and his casual gear was not much better. It seemed Harry had about a million t-shirts, and a couple of pairs of jeans, and little else beyond tracksuit bottoms. His shoes were either beaten up old trainers, or sensible Oxfords, and that one pair of expensive running shoes he’d splurged on for his last birthday. He owned a surprising number of cardigans, and the Weasley jumpers almost needed a wardrobe of their own. Other than that, there was his old Auror uniform, his dress robes (which he hadn’t worn in recent memory), and his Hogwarts uniform.
“So you’re a leg man.” Well, now that Malfoy was pointing it out, Harry supposed maybe he was. Once again, he was imagining himself on his knees, between those thighs, the legs perhaps slung over his shoulders, the soft, tanned skin pressed against his cheek as he mouthed kisses up, and up, and up- “Is that all you like about him?” Malfoy was still talking, his hands were still holding firm to Harry’s hips, and now his fingertips were stroking, just slightly, beneath the hem of Harry’s tshirt.
Potter picked up the pace, and Draco threw a hand across the surface of the bench, his palm flat on the table top. Soft towels nudged his fingertips, and he could smell that tantalising mixture of in-wash stain remover and washing powder, a faintly lavender-tinged, soapy aroma, wafting down from the damp, warm towels strung above their heads. Maybe it
“Mmmhmm,” Harry murmured again, and Malfoy got to work, gently but firmly thrusting the dong in and out. Harry dragged his eyes away with some difficulty, and looked back down at his clipboard. All readings looked perfectly average for what he expected from two non-magical sex toys.  “So, do people really tell you those sorts of things?”
“If you don’t mind, I might take the opportunity for a quick lunch with Hermione. Unless you want me to come with?”
Potter burst back into the room, hair still standing on end. “I was thinking, maybe we should order the Thai for delivery, and you can blow me while we wait? I’m not ashamed to say, I’m slightly afraid of what a stray bit of curry on the tongue might do to my bits, but I really think I deserve that blow job.” Potter caught the expression on Draco’s face, and grinned back. “What?”
Draco's eyes adjusted to the dim light. Potter was to the left of him, watching him earnestly, an air of nervous energy about him. Why would Potter be nervous? If anyone, it should be Draco, coming to live in a strange house that smelled like the Black's, with a man whom he -
“I like you, Draco Malfoy. You’re posh and bitchy, and extremely confident, and good at your job, and you wear clothes that cost more than you earn in a year, and all I want to do is take them off you.”
Malfoy was almost smiling. “Good charm, that one. Yes, for the comfort and privacy of my customers, there are concealment charms of a sort – something of my own devise. I call it
“Not even remotely,” Draco said, and he tried to arch his back even further. “Well, aside from the fact that when you started in the department a bit over a year ago, I wanted to strangle you, and now I all I want is to get my hands around your throat for entirely unrelated reasons.”
Harry concentrated on rubbing the ink off his fingers with his handkerchief. He remembered nearly everything Malfoy had ever said to him, from the moment they met getting measured for school robes. He’d always been a bit obsessed with Malfoy. That obsession had just taken different forms, over time.
“I have a question,” Harry asked, his nose smushed into Draco’s chest. “Is Blaise shitting himself with envy supposed to be a good thing, or a bad thing?”
“Yes, the attic is full of my crap. I know. I’ll have to get rid of something, won’t I?” Draco made a face. “I suppose that’s only fair.”
Draco spent a good deal of his spare time thinking about Potter; and Draco had a good deal of spare time at his disposal. Thinking that he should thank Potter better - thank him at
“Kismet,” Malfoy said, with a surprised laugh. He leaned one shoulder into Harry’s, and didn’t lean away. “Look at you. Granger finally got you the word of the day bog roll, did she?”
It was a good thing Ron and ‘Mione were the sort of friends who let themselves in rather than wait politely at the front door to be invited. It helped that they had both a key to said door, and to the wards, and that with Draco’s absence there was a minimal chance of barging in on Harry in a compromising situation. As it was, Harry was face down on the settee where he had been pretty much since Draco had gone in the morning, and he was still in just his threadbare trousers. He had, eventually, pulled the soft knitted rug off the back of the sofa when he started to feel a little cold, but otherwise he’d basically not moved all day, preferring instead to wallow in the joyous misery of requited love.
“God, Harry,” Draco clutched at his waist hard enough to leave marks. “Get your fucking trousers off.”
“I sent the video I took before, and a couple of snaps, to a friend,” Longbottom said. “He’s just replied.”
“Oh,” Harry said, a peculiar mixture of pleased and disappointed at Malfoy’s departure. “Yeah, I’m hoping you can get your hands on a plant for me at short notice.”
Harry immediately picked his sandwich up and took an enormous bite. He was fairly sure it was absolutely delicious, but the consuming thought that blunted any sensory input from his mouth, was that Malfoy had made this for him, with his own two hands. “It’s wonderful,” Harry said thickly, through a mouthful. “I love it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Here’s the plan. I’m going to let you off the hook with that room tonight, and you’re going to work on it for the rest of the week while I’m away.” He ticked off one finger, and continued, “And you’re going to order Thai in, even though you’re having Chinese tomorrow, and I’m going to go upstairs for a shower because I’m covered in dust, while you wait for it to get here and put it under a Warming charm I’ll set for you. Then you’re going to come upstairs and worship my body until I say you can stop. Then we can eat, and then it’s an early night because I’ve got work in the morning.”
“I’m not excited yet, but maybe you’ve forgotten what that looks like.” Potter pulled out the straw and dropped it on the bartop, and took a sip of the drink. “You know, since it’s been a while.”
“Next week?” Harry said distractedly. Oh. Next week. “Just the normal, I suppose. Handy that my birthday’s on a Friday this year. Can get pissed, and not have to front work with a hangover. I guess I’ll send out a couple of owls, and get the gang around mine for a few ciders.”
Harry sighed loudly and swore for several minutes without pause, and stuffed his wand into his pocket with nearly enough force to tear a hole in his robes.
Malfoy remained utterly composed, as he had for the duration of their somewhat bizarre meeting. “It’s my pleasure, Potter. I’m always happy to help the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” He smiled slightly at Harry. “Be sure to let me know if I can be of any further service.”
The pictures were...surprisingly good, actually. The lamplight caught the curve of his right cheek, and the long muscle of his hamstring. His team identification - MALFOY 07 - was clearly visible. The shadows between his thighs and arse teased at what couldn’t be seen, but could be readily imagined.
It was all one Division, under Robards, technically. Being in the Potions unit made things a little easier. Potter and Weasley were both in Field, so it wasn’t like they’d ever be partners. But there was often overlap. Shared facilities. Potter was an early bird like Draco, so his morning workout, following the Thames run at dawn, often found them sharing the gym. Sometimes spotting one another on the weights, while indulging in some good-natured ribbing. Sometimes getting each other off as quietly as possible in the showers after. That was more recent. Six months. Draco swore under his breath, and told himself to stop obsessing over it. So it was six months, he’d been fucking Potter for six months. It didn’t mean anything. And he was going to stop.
Weasley clapped a warm hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I know you’ll make me pay for this for — well, the rest of my life, but thank you again Malfoy. I’ve already had HR re-credit your leave balance, and you’re on paid exemption for the next fortnight.”
“And you’re also not known for being risk averse. I feel like the whole division's had to sit through enough of Robards’ rants about it that it’s a well known fact.”
“Malfoy,” Potter seemed amused. “That’s not really the same thing. I think you’re well aware that I ran into Scrivener at one of Ginny’s press junkets for the Harpies. He thought I might make a decent security consultant, and I thought I would too – nearly ten years in the Corps. I might know a thing or two about security, you know.”
So she was just going to get right to it, then. “You tracked me down using questionable means to confront me about my routine?”
Harry shook his head. His body was slowly relaxing again. “No, you’re right. I’ve wasted so much money on things I’ve never used or never given to the people I intended to.” Draco brought Harry’s hand to his mouth, and pressed his lips to Harry’s ring. “I have a problem.”
fucking-” Malfoy flipped the phone open and frowned again, before answering. “Auntie? What’s wrong?”
“Our first daughter would be Brie,” then Harry had to duck, because Draco was throwing linen napkins at his head. “Oi! Mind the risotto!”
Draco packed away the biscuits, banished the tea cups and tea pot back to the tea room, and removed every last crumb from his desk and rug; but it was only after he had neatly stacked the orange files and straightened the visitors chair, that Draco realised he had been grinning to himself the whole time, he suspected quite goofily, and that he had been doing quite a lot of that just lately.
“You’re very good at this,” Harry blurted, snapping his mouth shut again instantly. Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up, and he paused momentarily, looking at Harry with amusement. “I didn’t mean - I mean, lab work. Spell analysis.”
Potter was waiting for him back at the incident room when he returned from lunch. “Ready to hit the Owlery?”
“I should have had you with me, Blaise! Then perhaps I wouldn’t have spent ￡800 on a single scarf.” Harry chuckled indulgently. “Then again, perhaps I would have spent even more.”
tellings off.” Harry stared at him, until Malfoy began to look self conscious and brushed at his face. “What?”
Harry drew a sharp breath and looked up at Malfoy, who was looking right back at him intently. He looked away again, cast his eyes across the club and saw that the busy workers had finished their business at the DJ booth, and the bar staff were ready at their stations. The music became fractionally louder, and the next moment the first wave of patrons came surging up the stairs and onto the floor, a rush of bodies moving to claim seats, to order drinks, to hustle into the restrooms and touch up cosmetics and hair-do’s.
Draco stopped in his tracks, and his hands were tight on Harry’s shoulders, and his eyes were fever bright. “Maybe we can manage a quickie after all. Potter,
Harry started to laugh, and went to hoist Malfoy up and off to their room for another round, before realising he was not in a decent state to be seen, and promptly sat down again.
“That means their rooms will be on the third, with Granger and Ron. The kids can bunk in with Teddy, I assumed, but Ron will have front row seats to Merlin knows what between his sister and Pans.”
Ginny took a huge gulp of her juice, grinning. “It's the best of mine, Hermione’s seen your cock and Ron’s about to die about it!”
that meant kisses, or being in knots inside and feeling utterly sick, or barricading himself in his borrowed bedroom.
There was a rap at the partition, and Draco looked up to see Weasley leaning against the divider. “How’d you get on?”
“The blush suits you.” He looked over Harry’s shoulder, Harry supposed at Malfoy. “It’s good you have a friend to look out for you. Coming out can be hard.”
“Malfoy, as you well know, I’m an excellent risk assessment consultant – even you have to admit that.” Potter grinned at him. “And I have analysed the potential risk in this proposition very thoroughly. While I agree there is a lot at stake here, I feel confident that this is ultimately a low risk investment that will yield a number of extremely attractive rewards.” Potter grinned again, and dropped his head to kiss Draco once more, this time very softly, and Draco felt his eyes close and everything else fell away as it had before. “Trust me,” Potter said against his lips, and it was a request, rather than a demand.
“Is he hurt?” Harry said tightly to Malfoy, his hand on his elbow, steering him to the STAFF ONLY sign, and through to the musty back office. He nodded his thanks at the bartender, who was openly gawping.
“I know you all think me an idiot,” Harry said, viciously crushing a Twiglet with the butt of his glass. “But I’m well aware you all know I fancy Malfoy.” It was inaccurate to say it had started that night after the pub, because it had really been going on for some time, just all one-sided. Harry’s side, specifically.
Harry frowned at the glass. “Right-o. Well, what have you got to say about my hair, then? Terrible, litter of badgers nesting in it, looks like I was dragged through a bush backwards?” He pulled open the drawer under the sink, and grabbed the jar of Sleekeazy’s Hair Cement with great resentment. He’d never quite got the hang of using it - Hermione had managed to wrestle his hair into a reasonably respectable configuration once or twice in the past, but Harry hadn't had the same success. It had always turned out like a bit of a thick, black, hairy helmet.
Draco twisted under him, catching Potter’s wrist in his left hand. “Full range of motion, by the feel of it. Though,” he let his thumb tease the delicate bones of Potter’s wrist. “Maybe a proper test is in order, just to be on the safe side.”
So Harry told Draco about the Healer’s visit, and the off-hand comment that had sparked his idea, and about his visit to Zabini, while Draco ate his steak and salad, and hand-cut chips, and laughed delightedly.
Harry trailed his fingertips where he imagined Malfoy’s mouth to be, and exhaled shakily in the steam of the shower, his left hand stroking his throat and his right slipping down to slowly palm his cock. He was actually a little sensitive, after so many wanks the night before, which to be fair all occurred mere hours ago. That was a lot of wank in a short period of time.
“What did it feel like?” Teddy’s hair was electric blue and pulsing along with the waves in the video.
He sounded sort of surprised, like he thought that perhaps Draco was only joking when he'd accepted the offer of accommodation.
Drinking so much on a Thursday was folly, and Draco was now paying for it with a hangover from the deepest bowels of hell. That was probably how he managed not to notice Potter until the man himself was leaning casually on the counter of his kiosk, heart attack inducing smile and all.
“Fuck off.” Malfoy smoothed his fingers down the tie, now knotted to what Harry assumed was perfection. His face was brick red, now, and Harry lay both of his own hands on top of Malfoy’s, and pressed them to Harry’s chest.
“Well,” Draco said against his knuckles. “In the short term, all of the stuff you bought for me is moving directly into our wardrobe, because I want it all, and it doesn’t really matter if it’s out of season.” He pulled both of Harry’s hands onto his chest, and Harry spread his fingers across the plush velvet of the peacock blazer. “In the long term, I think, and I say this with the deepest love and affection, that you need to go back to therapy.”
“And I suppose you look less like a street urchin than usual, yourself.” That was perhaps the greatest understatement ever made. Potter looked incredible, in a fine black Muggle tuxedo. He was even wearing cufflinks, for pity’s sake.
"Aren't you gonna try some?" he said eventually, with difficulty, as his own mouth was now stuffed full of toast. Butter was dripping down his fingers, speckled with toast-crumbs, and Draco swallowed and flicked out his tongue to collect the melted yellow residue from his knuckles and the webbing of his fingers. God, it was erotic, the way his tongue poked and coiled and returned back into his mouth, only to reappear, pink and clean, to start the process all over again.
Draco nodded solemnly. “The whole tournament. They’ll have to call the Aurors in to remove me at the end.”
He’d been manipulated, but Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be genuinely annoyed. “Fine. But you’re in charge of dealing with his inevitable tantrums.”
happens to me in - this department.” He caught Malfoy’s climbing eyebrows. “I don't mean that I’m a virgin, I told you that already.” Malfoy sipped his drink in silence, and looked back at him with large eyes. Waiting for Harry to say his piece.
“Thirty-two, almost,” Potter corrected. “And I’ll make up some rubbish about wanting to find myself, or spend time with my extended family, or something else that’s warm and fuzzy.”
Malfoy almost looked convinced, and reached in once again to the brown paper bag. “Lube - nothing fancy.” He placed a tube on the workbench. “And this is Roger.” The next item was an enormous thing, and took both of Malfoy’s capable hands to bring it out of the bag and onto the bench. It was the size of an actual person, up to the waist, made from some sort of rubber, and was shaped like a kneeling man with an impressive cock rising up between the thighs. “Roger can be straddled and ridden, but can also be tipped over and penetrated - the anus is ridged inside, and even the balls swing realistically in response to being fucked. He’s disgustingly expensive, so we don’t sell very many - but those who indulge are always extremely satisfied.”
Harry gave a little wave, and started down the lane, leaving Malfoy flushed and staring, under the orange warmth of the pub’s coach lamp.
He hesitated, fighting the urge to look back at Malfoy. “I - actually, I’m just looking tonight. Sorry if I…”
“What — no fawning lovesick himbo waiting for you at home?” He really wished he could stop himself from asking, but when had he ever had impulse control when it came to Harry Potter?
place, Thai food, a blow job on the settee – no cricket – and you get to fuck me in the shower after.”
“First of all, I’ll have you know my arse is far from spotty — it’s perfect in every way. Poems have been written about it. Songs, even. I’ve heard a rumour of a sculpture. And secondly, my perfect arse should be somewhere hot and foreign, where I should be getting my equally perfect cock sucked by person or persons also hot and foreign.” Draco folded his arms over his chest and applied his best glare. “So this had better be good,
“Please grab the wand before the penis, Harry,” Neville said loudly, and in a very put upon tone. “I feel like I shouldn’t have to ask, after all the complaining about loud pissing this week.”
A combination of both is to blame for Harry pushing Malfoy up against the cottage wall two nights ago, and snogging him blind.
- there were easily a dozen decorative cushions, none of which matched. A cupcake caddy. A yoga mat. A set of neon bocce balls. Two backpacks. A set of fancy linen sheets with an eye watering price label still stuck to the front. Another yoga mat. Several novelty Christmas jumpers. An inflatable mattress for camping.
was on at half eight. On Tuesday he would remind Draco that he would visit the supermarket for the shopping at ten. If it was a Friday, he'd ask Draco whether he had any washing to be done that was not already in the laundry, because Friday was always washing day. Saturday mornings, he'd remind Draco that he'd be working on the house, and apologised in advance for any noisy spellwork. Potter never once mentioned on Sunday's that he'd make roast lamb and red wine gravy for lunch. But he always did.
Lunch was ready. Potter served, making sure Draco had extra roast potatoes as always, because he knew Draco liked them. Draco couldn't fathom why Potter made such an effort. Why he bothered. They ate in silence, too. What on earth would they say, anyway? It was always like this, quiet. Only now it was tense and awkward, rather than comfortable. Potter was wrong, they weren't friends - Potter was just a stupid Gryffindor with a compulsion to save people, and Draco was just a idiot Slytherin who had made the grave mistake of falling in love with him.
“But you’re an Auror too,” Ted was giggling again, and his hair had finally settled on his usual lovely brown.
“I’m flat out,” Draco said, without looking up. His quill hand was starting to cramp up, and there was at least another foot left on the draft contract for the annual Quodpot tournament that really had to be finished by the end of the day.
. They'll probably give you another Order of Merlin for your contribution to society. Hell, they'll probably give you twelve!"
He was laughing again as Draco pulled him by the hand up the stairs. He could feel the warm metal of Draco’s ring where their fingers laced. He heard Ron whistling after them, and a roar of cat-calls and laughter from their friends, and Draco looked back at him, his face full of mirth. A young wizard, in love.
Harry always felt vaguely unsteady after Apparition, never more so than when he’d had a few. Tonight was no exception, but this time, he couldn’t rightly say whether the wobble in his thighs was a result of being recently squeezed through space and time, or from a night spent in the heady company of strong alcohol, and Draco Malfoy.
Potter’s fingers pressed into Draco’s shoulder, and Potter grinned at him in a way that made his throat immediately dry. Draco took a quick swig of his drink, which was getting distressingly low. “None that I can demonstrate in public, but I’d be happy to show you privately a bit later?” Draco choked on a mouthful of bubbles, and Potter grinned even more, and guided him by the shoulder toward a cluster of nearby guests. “These old farts look like they have a few galleons to spare,” Potter murmured directly into Draco’s ear. Draco, for his part, was completely unable to reply. “Ladies, gentlemen; thank you so much for coming tonight. Have you all met Draco Malfoy?” Draco applied his most genuine smile, and set about shaking hands and murmuring ‘hello’ as if a reel of completely inappropriate visions of Potter and his potentially hidden talents were not playing at high speed in his head. “Draco is responsible for this wonderful evening,” Potter gestured around them, and the old witches cooed. “I dare say, he’ll make a terrific Undersecretary when Mr Scrivener retires. I certainly wouldn’t object to being under Draco.” Potter turned to Draco with an enormous grin. “Of course, there’s always a chance he may end up under
At twelve sharp, Parkinson arrived to sweep Malfoy away to lunch. “What are you doing all the way over here?” Malfoy was perplexed, but happy to see her. “You hate the Ministry refectory.”
“Can I assume not all the rooms are going to be this easy?” Draco Summoned a box with a Snitch inside, and turned it over. “None of this seems like it has sentimental value. Is there anything in here I need to keep an eye out for?”
Malfoy returned at half-one, and Harry had ploughed through lunch and finished their backlog of case filing while he was gone.
“Mmm, yes, I gathered as much.” Harry squinted at Devlin’s armload of dicks, in no hurry to reach out and claim them. “Did our good friend Mr Weasley happen to provide any further information? I was under the impression that this case was more of a political stunt than anything to do with our sort of investigations.”
“That I think I like. A male person,  I mean. What I’m saying is, I went out with a man, that I like. Last night.” Ugh, this was already a disaster.
“In what universe do you think Hermione is going to let you get away with having a pint with me, while she’s stuck at home trying to feed, bathe and put to bed those two banshees you call children?”
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, pushing off the wall and crushing the cigarette under a heel in one graceful movement. He looked Harry up and down, a smile barely quirking his lips. “Look at you.” His eyes dropped back down, trailed down Harry’s body for a second look with an almost palpable intensity.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, stretching. His spine popped satisfyingly. It had been a long week. He was going to walk home, get a kebab from the cart up the street and eat it on his way, then have a shower, probably a wank, and hopefully a night of solid sleep followed by a lie in. “You ready?”
Harry thumped his glass down on the table and pointed his finger in Malfoy’s face. “That’s a lie, and I won’t have you spreading such rubbish about my friend, Malfoy! You don’t know a thing about their relationship.”
Potter leaned against him, laughing against his neck. “I did it on purpose, you idiot.” He began to mouth gently at Draco’s throat, which felt like literally the best thing that had ever happened to him. Draco struggled for breath.
“I will kill,” Draco seethed, slotting a finger through the envelope flap with fury, “every last one of them if I’m being called in again.”
Draco pressed his lips together, and attempted not to catch the scent of Potter’s shampoo. His joggers were cashmere Tom Ford, and his hoodie was cashmere McQueen. Even his trainers were designer, but he suspected Potter knew that, considering he was obviously wearing Prada Chelsea boots himself, and over £600 a pair at that, not to mention the Balmain jeans.
“Concussion,” she confirmed. “We’ll be here overnight for obs, but also to let the bones and teeth regrow.”
at least a thousand of those must like cock, or could be persuaded to try it. One thousand out of 3.5 million. Draco definitely hadn’t fucked one thousand men (and one woman), so why did it seem as if there was no one left in all of London who could meet even his most generous, flexible, gaping wide criteria? Where we’re all the Harry Potters?
Somehow, the word ‘pleasure’ took on all sorts of suggestive meaning when Malfoy said it, which Harry supposed was probably the point. Malfoy always did know how to provoke a reaction from him, generally one he would rather not have been having. Harry cleared his throat, realised he was still holding the box containing the Frolicking Feather, and shoved it hastily back on the shelf in order to fumble his Ministry identification out of a pocket in his robes.
“No, actually,” Harry said, a bit surprised. “Sorry – I’m just looking for some assistance in tracking down who purchased it. I assume you keep records of sales?”
Blaise didn’t seem to be able to say much, but he managed to bare his teeth in a grimace that he might have meant as a smile. “I should probably go, I’ve taken up too much of your time without a proper appointment, you’ve been very kind.”
He cringed, feeling the guilt tighten in his belly. He had wasted a lot of money, really. It wouldn’t have been wasted if he’d actually given Draco any or all of these things, and let them be enjoyed the way he’d intended. Or he could have used the money for something to help people. Instead, he just kept buying and buying, and hiding it all away, feeling shameful for his excess, feeling like he couldn’t really help himself. Not wanting to scare Draco off when they were just starting out together, with how much he thought about him all the time, and how much he wanted to give him things that would please him.
He lifted the hem so it sat high on his waist, his arse bare, and turned away from the mirror. He cocked his hips, bent his left knee slightly, and held the phone up to his left shoulder, so the camera lens would clear his arm, and rapidly snapped a number of shots over his shoulder via the mirror.
The minute the whole table had finished their answers, Harry volunteered to get the next round, and Apparated halfway across the pub without checking whether they wanted beer again, or something stronger.
Draco flung his arms away from himself to gesture around the crammed bedroom. “Hundreds of thousands of pounds - a
He lay with his face pressed to Draco’s throat, as his heartbeat hammered and gradually slowed. Draco’s hands rested tiredly on his flanks, one hand sticky, and their bellies wet with sweat and come. “If you keep fucking me like that, I’m going to get the idea that you like me, Malfoy.”
“Nope, no thank you,” Harry pulled Draco away and into the middle of the room for a dance. “Your mum’s crying.”
beside the stove to use for kindling later. The used tea bag landed with a soggy plop in the rubbish bin under the sink, and Harry gave the cup a brief rinse. “Do you want a lift in? I’ve still got a Ministry car from that job last Tuesday.”
They discussed Ron’s present dilemma in earnest as they made their way through the car park to the restroom, where in turn they each flushed themselves all the way to the Atrium at the Ministry Headquarters. By the time the lift doors clattered open at Level Two, Harry had successfully talked Ron out of a subscription to
“I didn’t know you were in love with him.” Draco didn’t respond to that. Nobody was supposed to know that. He’d only told Pansy out of panic, so she would stop him from going home with Potter again. Granger didn’t look happy. “You’re incredibly stubborn, Draco Malfoy.” It seemed like she wanted to say something more, but wasn’t sure if she should.
Granger must have made her decision, because an elf in a tuxedo appeared silently by the table, and placed a glass of something red beside her. Draco didn’t look at it too long. The colour made his chest ache.
“Oh,” was all Harry managed. Malfoy took him by the shoulder and turned him back around, and pressed close against his back again. His long fingers closed around both of Harry’s hips this time, and when Malfoy’s lips came to rest ever so slightly against the lobe of one ear, he felt gooseflesh erupt along his neck.
Ron picked up a cock with a pair of tongs, and waved it in Harry’s direction. “So – get on with it. Use it for what it’s designed for, and see if that activates the curse.”
Harry passed his hand across his jaw and felt the scratch of stubble under the pads of his fingertips. Rubbed them roughly across his lips, then again, more gently. He has strong hands, strong fingers. Not as long as Malfoy’s, who looks like a piano prodigy or something. Harry likes hands, he knows that about himself now. Harry has masculine hands, fingers blunt but tidy, nails short but not chewed. The sort of hands which could lift another person up, haul them up by the hips, could wrap around a cock or grasp an arse cheek and squeeze it, pull it apart...he took an unsteady breath and pushed his hand up from his lips and into his hair, pressing the wet tangle back from his forehead. His scar was shiny pink.
