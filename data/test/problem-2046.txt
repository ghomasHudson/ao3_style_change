He could still see Harry’s face. Green irises, full and vibrant. Harry was inside him, kissing his mouth languidly, thrusting gently. Draco moaned and held on, dug his fingers into Harry’s back and held and held. “Don’t let go,” he gasped, “Harry, I’ve got you.”
A solitary tear welled just under Blaise’s eyelashes and began to drift down his cheek. “You know that I… that…”
Ginny looked away, down at Seamus where he lay on the next bed. “I shouldn’t, though. Don’t want to wake him.”
Hermione, however, was not dead. Just sleepy. And she didn’t want to be woken up. Luckily, Ron seemed to have the same idea, or maybe another idea altogether, but both ideas culminated in the two of them extricating themselves from the table and making their way through the doors into the front atrium.
He took a second to gather his wits. His hands were shaking with what he’d just done. And he couldn’t let it hit him. Weasley had no time for his weakness; every second, the Death Eaters got closer to discovering her, and if they did—Draco closed his eyes, sought for air.
Blaise’s emotion never took the shape of a word. Seamus couldn’t breathe with feeling it, slipping and floundering in it, praying to every deity in the Wizarding and Muggle worlds that he was returning even half of this sheer, sharp warmth. He let out a tiny moan.
“Oh my.” Distress worried the many lines around Remus’ eyes and mouth. His hands parted and reclasped. “Then he was by himself in Voldemort’s stronghold.”
himself. Even more horrifying was the thought that maybe he’d always done that. For years and years, and she had just consigned him to hatred, as he’d consigned her. But it wasn’t holding any longer. His edges were fraying right before her eyes and she had the frightening feeling that something colossal was going to come pouring through the rips and tears, large and dark and painful, something she had no business knowing.
She had to assume they knew everything: About Luna, about herself. About Harry and the castle, and Ginny’s imminent arrival. About Draco Malfoy. It was a damn good thing neither she nor Hannah had been privy to which route Ginny and Malfoy would take.
Moody and Pomfrey exchanged a look, and the Healer nodded. “It’s the only viable explanation for what’s going wrong with my spells.”
Malfoy wrenched his attention from her and snatched at his knapsack. His fingers shook as he fussed with the buckle. Ginny’s stomach lurched. She tried again, eager to make amends for her rash judgment.
Blaise stared at her. Her body was red-rimmed to his agonised eyes. He pressed a hand to his right side, felt his wand slip through fingers newly slicked. His blood this time? Most likely. It didn’t matter from where, he could very well be bleeding out at that moment. Millicent’s eyes glimmered. She flicked her wand hand, biting her lip and looking again like the child he had first seen eight years ago in Hogwarts’ Great Hall. “Go.”
Harry shut his eyes against the onslaught that sheared over the bond. “Go,” he muttered, “leave the room, I need to—”
to a figure he couldn’t see properly. Flame sparked again, but not the coal-deep thrum of lust, of Harry in his hands, in his body. This flame was harsh and white, grinding like broken glass.
“Malfoy,” she started. He gripped the knapsack and gave her a quick, piercing gaze, and Ginny’s words nearly failed her. “I… I’m sorry.”
Ron nodded. “What I was thinking. We can make the main stairs from here, but anyone below will just have to look up and they’ll see us.”
Was he angry at her? She had not done as he’d said, it was true. She’d probably put them all in danger with her stunt, everyone who was relying on her safe arrival. She wasn’t sure what had made her turn back in the forest. The weight on her heart, perhaps, surprising, but very, very real. He had a right to be mad, even if she knew she couldn’t have done any differently.
“Probably the only reason you’re still alive,” he said to himself. The words broke into a strangled laugh.
“I’m not supposed to make these decisions,” Harry forced out, clutching impotently at Remus. “I’m not the one. I don’t want it.”
“Oh, fine words, Harry.” Tears glimmered, threatening to spill down Hermione’s cheeks. “Two years and suddenly you don’t love her anymore. Is this some way of protecting her again, because we are bloody well beyond that. There isn’t time for nobility any longer. Just let her help you! Don’t squander this because of some cheap emotion, or guilt or whatever it is. These are our lives you’re throwing away. Everyone’s lives!”
“Are you saying you want me?” It came out very quickly, as though Draco had flung it out against his will. Harry raised his eyes and found Draco looking back. His face was a worn wall, barely holding against whatever lay behind it. Every word of substance left Harry, as they always did. And this… Well. There was no way to answer this question. Not without putting it all out there, things even he couldn’t face. The anger boiled up.
The boy seemed oblivious to the noise around him. Liquid brown irises stared at Draco. Draco shuddered violently. Innocence was being wrenched from this boy, right before his eyes.
But Hermione came to him with the same hushed story half an hour later, having discovered it for herself during a follow-up with Madam Pomfrey. This time, Harry said nothing, only listened and looked at the wall, feeling his thready belief in the nature of rumours dwindle with each word. Hermione didn’t add to confusion when she could help it. It had never been her way.
He turned another corner with all due caution and found yet another corridor. The long ones were the worst, and he took them at a run when he could. He didn’t much fancy the idea of being caught in the middle if someone else ventured down the hallway from either end. There was nothing to hide behind this time, no pillars. He slowed as he approached the next bend, hearing nothing but his own quick breaths. A long hall, then a short one. Short. Long. Short. No pillars.
They waited, curled together behind boulders for over an hour. But Macnair had finally lost track of her.
“I’ll tell you how to get them.” The words were almost directed at the room instead of at Harry. Malfoy’s left arm hung at his side. As if breaking through the surface of a pond, Harry noticed the rigidity of the limb. In all his stilted movements, Malfoy had not moved that hand. Or that arm.
He reminded himself that the Death Eaters had better things to do these days than wander aimlessly through the passages of their fortress. People to hunt. Saviours to catch. They wouldn’t even be looking for him, or anyone, down here, not unless he gave them a reason. His wand was in his hand, though he had no plans for using it just yet. Still, it felt more comfortable. Even after all these months, he was unused to leaving magic behind.
“He’s fine, Zabini’s fine, they can both take care of themselves!” Merlin, she’d been so stupid. So tired and shocked and confused that she couldn’t act on all the obvious reasons why they should stick together, couldn’t remember that everyone had nightmares. At least she remembered where she was going. But now there was no castle, and no Seamus, and no safety, and—
Luna saw him and smiled. One hand fingered the strings of the ornate harp before her. Her hair tumbled over her shoulders, cream against the green embroidery of her robe. She looked like a fire fairy, glowing orange, eyes bright as topaz. Harry stepped across the room amidst a roll of notes. Luna broke the statuesque serenity of her posture and nudged a cushion toward him from under her chair. Her hands never left the instrument. Harry lowered himself down beside her.
But there, in that memory, lay the heart of Draco Malfoy’s soul. Somewhere in the midst of it, Harry was at last convinced of his sincerity.
Hermione swallowed against the burning in the back of her throat and searched the fog for tell-tale movement. There were a lot of things she had never done before that she had now done. Some she had done out of necessity, without thinking, but time didn’t allow her that luxury for long, and now she crouched in the dark, running over the consequences of actions taken in haste. Not searching for Luna’s wand, or Hannah’s, there in the streets of Salisbury. Not choosing areas further from the castle when she jumped, but she couldn’t bring herself to put too much distance between herself and the promise of safety.
He wished he could just say the words. But they were netted by the remembered scent of Harry’s skin and the concern in those eyes. Draco pursed his lips, dangerously close to teetering off the edge. He had no idea what lay below him. “I haven’t time for this,” he said at last, horrified at what he heard creeping into his voice. Still Harry stood there, close enough to touch if Draco just reached out, felt for the slope of that shoulder. There was warmth there that he could no longer ignore, now that he’d tasted it—felt it ripple within his body,
“Don’t know if I want to go through with it, really,” she joked instead. Rolled her eyes as dramatically as she could. “Such a burden, bonding. Does horrid things to your complexion, you know.”
He didn’t remember being prepared, didn’t even remember being unclothed. It was as though Harry was there before he was, following directions Draco never voiced. He clenched his hands over Harry’s shoulders, and then, dissatisfied, wound his arms beneath Harry’s, pulled Harry’s hips to his by the crook of an ankle and spread wide and—
“Are you alright?” Harry asked. Soft words, meant only for him. Draco was suddenly afraid of who else might be awake and listening, watching. Witnessing the state of Harry’s body and knowing just how it got to be that way. Draco drew himself upright inside as well as out.
“Let me.” He ran his forefinger along the line of the scar. It vanished under his fingertip until Harry’s forehead was serene. Unblemished.
She felt the words bubbling up from some secret spring in her chest, out of control, as if she would talk and talk, faster and faster until she exploded. “He could fight them even then. He was always gifted.”
It echoed down the hallway, filtering into the large room. It sounded very close. Blaise knew it was a trick of his ears and of the echoes. Far away still, perhaps several turns down the dim corridors. It was nothing like the fall of footsteps.
Too late, Draco heard footsteps ahead in the hallway, but he was so immersed in his turmoil that it took him several seconds to look up.
He hadn’t known what to think. He’d just looked over and seen the empty side of the bed. He’d reached out, and his mind had barely registered the cooled sheets before he was sitting up and pulling on his trousers. Searching for his glasses and finding them inexplicably next to his bed. But there was no time to wonder. He didn’t bother with Draco’s room; the only one who would know instantly was Luna, and he’d been terrified of what she might tell him.
The song came as sweet and haunting as ever, but her face pinched, perplexed once more. Then she grinned openly.
The closed doors of the Great Hall exploded outward, and the force of it flung Hermione into the wall behind her. She crouched over two students, shielding them as flames roared out into the new flush of oxygen.
“If it can. We don’t… There’s no way to know what will happen. If it will even work against the magic of a Horcrux.”
Potter’s hands were already at his collar, working the clasp of his cloak free and shoving it off his shoulders. Potter eased Draco’s shirt from his waist band, then hissed. Draco looked down and saw dark red soaking through the filthy fabric. Potter rolled the shirt up and away, then fumbled for his wand and cast a series of clotting spells over the area. Pain bit afresh and Draco let a grunt slip past his lips. Potter frowned. Flicked his wand again. A tendril of numbness slithered down Draco’s side like cool water and began to expand.
Ginny spun back around, her face wide open. “Can it even happen like that? Without them knowing, without—”
“I have information,” Fleur managed at last in a steadier voice. “Things she told me. As soon as she found us. She said it was better, better more than one person knew, so she told me. And Alain. She would have told us more, but…”
ing noise, nodded, and once again made for the door. He paused just inside, however, and peered at Malfoy where he stood in the shadows. Hermione picked out open deliberation on Moody’s features right before he turned away. He left the room, his false leg thumping down the hall.
Harry advanced on her, fury stabbing over the top. “How dare you accuse me of being so selfish? I am going through with the fucking spell. Everyone’s precious lives are going to be saved, Hermione Granger, don’t you ever suggest that I would throw it all out over something so petty.”
“That’s not what I meant,” he said heatedly. He lifted Blaise’s hand in front of their eyes. “Are you hurting? Is it worse when he’s far away?”
“That’s why our next step is the weld. We figure out the combination, we should be able to protect anyone at any level of power equally.”
“And all of Europe has heard him whine about it.” Though Krum’s comment brought weak chuckles, the three people behind him looked ready to drop, so Harry kept winding upstairs once they reached the entrance hall, describing the rooms.
When Harry finally led her back down the hall, Ginny couldn’t think of a thing to say. There was plenty, obviously, but no way to utter it. The halls had grown darker and Luna’s voice echoed off the stones like a murmur in a cave. Ginny had no idea what time it was, but she could hear the roll of thunder outside. It almost sounded like the grinding of staircases.
“Go back to your rooms,” she said sharply. The students nearest her backed through their doorways like skittish foals, eyes wide. Several doors creaked nearly shut, but Hermione could see slivers of muted light glowing around their edges, the shadows of faces, eyes following them through the cracks.
she thought bitterly, watching Draco’s profile from the corner of her eye. He’d done nothing. Ginny had known Harry since she was a child, had loved him for years. She’d been sister, friend, and yes, lover. She’d earned his respect and adoration, and Draco Malfoy had done nothing but tear Harry’s feelings to pieces for as long as Ginny had been nursing her feelings for Harry. Draco Malfoy only knew how to hurt Harry, to slash and beat and injure. Where Ginny nurtured, Draco cut. He’d never known Harry, never understood him as she had. He had never held Harry in his arms and shushed away the trials of growing up.
But the third desire, he still might achieve if he held on tightly enough: to pass through whatever life he had left as fluidly as possible, without dragging others into the depths when his time to sink finally arrived. He’d never felt it so near before, a giant rock on the rim of sight.
The Order’s information concerning York was suspect, but too menacing to ignore. The morning of the battle saw the Death Eaters completely surprised by the arrival of numerous Aurors. For two hours, the Order succeeded in preventing Voldemort’s destruction of the heavy wards protecting the Muggle sections of the city. But as the day drew on, the Death Eaters’ superior numbers proved insurmountable. They turned the Aurors gradually and pressed inward toward the city.
Instead, she told him what happened. Not all of it, of course. There were things she didn’t want to remember, things that were lately dragging her out of sleep and back into her mutinous thoughts before she was ready. Things that sent gooseflesh climbing up her nape into her hair like frost. So she skipped those, and when she’d reached her first full meal in the castle, her first night in a warm bed, he was watching her avidly. She told him about the food, not quite knowing what she meant to say, but the words kept coming, observations about the atmosphere here, the silence of the house-elves, the way the castle wards made her feel like cool water was running over her skin. She asked if he’d eaten, if he wanted anything in particular because she could get it for him, she was sure. She talked about her brothers next, the fact that Fred and George were here and that this reminded her of the times when she’d been forced into their care so their parents could go out and get some peace, and the hell that had been, but that she’d given as good as she got, and the twins had liked that. And then she stopped.
“Harry—”And then Harry’s trousers were being yanked down, forced over his hips. Harry disentangled the two of them long enough to get his legs clear and started on Draco’s trousers. Draco knelt up on his knees, back arching beautifully, muscles tensing as he tried to speed the process. Harry mouthed the arc of his belly, and Draco panted and clung to him, all endless motion. Harry wrestled Draco’s clothing off of him, kicked his own away, and sought the words to the proper charms, something he wouldn’t need his wand for. They came easily; Draco’s fingers dug into his shoulders as the magic spindled around them. Through them.
He was definitely trying to rile her. Despite the frustration, Ginny’s curiosity was piqued. She let the silence suck some of the tension away, choosing her next words to avoid another confrontation.
“I’ve found a way it can be done. Protecting Harry, I mean. It’s shielding magic, it’s very old. It’s one of Merlin’s own, before there was such a thing as magic that defended specifically against the dark arts. But it might not—” Hermione’s face pinched. She looked up at him, eyes devastated. “Harry, I just can’t see how else this will work.”
“Wode,” Hermione said neatly. “And the red is madder. We made the dyes last night, from the plants in Minerva’s stores. It’s not as pure as the original paints the ancients used, but as you can see, it has huge potential for the containment of magical properties.”
A flicker of light brighter and quicker than thought illuminated Malfoy’s hair under his hood, followed closely by a growl of thunder. Ginny risked a look behind her into the forest. Fog had crept in around the tree trunks. She slowed. Something fluttered in the darkness between the trees. Her eyes, or…
He studied Malfoy’s face silently. The look in his eyes drew him back again and again. Frustrated, Harry looked away, snapping the moment like so much thread. “I’ll take those secrets, no matter how trivial. But there’s something else.”
“He hasn’t spent it with me,” she managed to say. It came out calmly, and she was insanely proud of herself. “Been more interested in everyone else that’s arrived.”
She longed to shout the question, demand an answer. Surely it was for his own ends, some desire to be accepted at last, or to be detached from the name of his family. Maybe—and she might just give him this—maybe he truly had become Harry’s friend and was just doing as Harry asked, only to confuse it with something else along the way.
But the war would surely end, one way or the other. Only, Harry Potter probably wouldn’t be there to see it.
Her other hand closed convulsively around his sleeve and Draco halted. He narrowed his eyes at her and she jerked her head behind them. Draco couldn’t see anything. He grabbed her arm and pulled again, but Ginny shook her head.
“Merlin, where are you?” As if calling them would bring Seamus and Blaise to her like some wild Accio. They’d always been proof that she was headed for something greater. She couldn’t get it out of her mind that if they were with her again, here, she could have that fabled love for herself once more. The chance of it, at least.
It was the despair under his tone that drew everyone’s attention. At least it drew Hermione’s. Pomfrey was still gripping her wrist.
She told herself that maybe the bond was contingent upon it, maybe every embrace and touch had to occur a certain way. The spell was so old that no one really knew how it would manifest. Other ancient spells were going into it to bind their magic as well, so the outcome was even less predictable. Ginny had never given much thought to Harry’s restraint, far too distracted by her own delight that he’d come back to her at last.
Draco snapped his head up, halting Harry’s reaching arm abruptly. Grey eyes skipped over his body and something flickered, painful and denied. Then it was gone. “Moody,” he said. It came out like a curse.
Oh. Of all people, Harry Potter in the middle of the hallway blocking his path. Draco wanted nothing but sleep, deep and blank, where there was no room for regrets. Frustration eddied: it seemed even that would be denied him tonight.
Draco was silent, but it was too late; her bristles were out. Not because he was being a prick but because she was right. Why in Godric’s name was he being so difficult about this? Her old penchant for competition fluttered to life. “You do know it. He trusts you for some weird reason, after all.”
Draco’s fury rose in response to the righteousness in Harry’s stance. Because it was all true, but it was all completely unfair, and he hated it, and Harry. “Oh, that’s pretty. Our last chance? How many last chances have you witnessed? You don’t know how many people I’ve watched die for your cause. In your
He looked up and found that Harry’s eyes had darkened, narrowing in on his face. “Malfoy. Are you alright?”
“That’ll be whoever it is, then.” Moody snorted irritably. He started off down the hall again, clacking that tempo of his. “Send him in to see me after he’s eaten. And I want you in my office once Lovegood is asleep. Zabini’s started north again.”
Draco wanted to ask. There was a curiosity, a yearning, to know more about what Harry was planning to do, what was being demanded of Blaise and Seamus. There was something just beyond his fingertips, something he knew would never truly be understood by anyone who had not taken part.
Pomfrey cleared her throat. “I can erect some shielding spells, things I use to keep certain magical treatments from interfering with other patients. In the morning, I’ll discuss the situation with Ms Lovegood, see if she has any ideas.”
The next stone reached nearly to his waist. They were some distance from where he’d planned to come out of the forest. The ridge was just visible to the north. Draco rubbed his fingers over the thick layer of moss covering the stone. He’d never heard of a stone circle out here. Avebury, yes, but that was miles away, closer to the remnants of Salisbury. They hadn’t gone near it; it was too close to a rendezvous point for Granger and Abbott. Unless Avebury was a hell of a lot bigger than anyone had ever thought, then there might be hundreds of unknown stone circles, only rising into human awareness now, at the touch of magical catastrophe.
Moody’s questions, to be scattered throughout. Details of the cabinet, Severus Snape, even Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom had been put forth already, several times. A fabrication here and there, to judge Malfoy’s knowledge of events. Certain answers came easily; others Malfoy consistently resisted, no matter how many variations of the question were put forth.
He looked away, still trying to wake up properly, and saw Draco in the corner, sitting in a moth-bitten armchair. Harry opened his mouth, but Kingsley and Minerva moved between them, conversing in voices too low to make out. Draco did not look at him, just stared off into the distance, and it was that which finally pulled Harry’s mind upright.
“You.” Draco’s voice was flat. They both looked at him. Draco met Hermione’s eyes squarely. “You’re a skilled dueler, and adaptable. You can find him fast and stay with him.”
Harry felt himself redden. Every inch of his newly fledged bond seemed aware of her, the what-might’ve-beens and the chilly, obvious reality. Everything he’d promised her and then snatched away. It didn’t help that he knew it was necessary, the right path. “Ginny—”
Draco took an unsteady step forward and lifted his hand from the stone. It wouldn’t matter now, he was certain. Whether he touched the stones or not, the magic was there like a quilt folded round him. It was nothing like the everyday magic he used; it was almost a second heartbeat, curious and present, at times unbalancing, but always there to redress the discrepancy again. Earthen, old. This magic didn’t know him as human; it knew him as an extension of itself.
She looked over the tops of heads and found Draco Malfoy’s dust-covered form at the front of the Slytherin students—god, there were
Luna’s song changed subtly when night closed in. The air shivered with the shift in wards, but the tune continued, smooth and gentle.
She had her answer, and it stung like a barb. It didn’t matter that Harry might not be aware, because
Draco froze in the doorway, hand still clenched around the ring. There in the farthest bed lay Blaise, a whitened ghost of himself. Finnigan slouched on a cot beside him, clenching the unconscious man’s hand. The scene was too familiar, but reversed, without blood, without the overwhelming scent of rust. Without Grimmauld. Draco’s throat closed too tightly to inhale.
In a few days, the man she was talking to—her friend—would be… he’d be… Ginny forced the word ‘dead’ into her thoughts, and then felt horrible, as though by merely thinking the word, she were hastening it on, urging it to become real. It was ridiculous. But this was magic and who knew?
Harry’s voice breached the maelstrom of lust and fear. Hands gripped Draco’s; Draco clenched his fingers and felt the heat of physical skin. It sliced the pandemonium in half and Draco gasped. Harry froze and for a moment, there was complete stillness.
He didn’t answer. She stepped nearer. His body reacted automatically and hitched him backward, keeping the distance between them. His leg throbbed, making his head pound.
But the truth did not allow him to dwell in ignorance for long. It returned with silent stealth just when he thought he’d gone far enough out of his mind to rid himself of its presence forever.
He rolled her over, coming to rest half on top of her. Hermione embraced him with a contented murmur and wiggled until he settled fully against her. His darkened eyes shone through the thatch of red hair falling over them. She brushed it away and he bent to meet her mouth. The kiss was long and tasted sweetly of whisky. Hermione felt like she was moving underwater. Just… couldn’t quite… get her hands… There. His shirt slid up and she traced the hot skin of his back, imagining each freckle her fingers were ghosting over. He rocked his hips against hers lightly, then more rhythmically. Tightly. His hands fluttered over her ribs, cupping up under her breasts. She felt dizzy, her tongue lost in Ron’s mouth, wanting nothing more than to keep kissing him. There was nothing better.
Harry settled back away from the edge, against one of the walls. The stone was almost too cold against his spine. He shut his eyes. Inhaled. Exhaled. Opened his eyes again and studied the land. Not an inch of it was burned, nothing hacked or felled. Just the steady tide of Luna’s spell, a bubble of solace amidst an even larger vastness. But deceptive.
Finnigan didn’t say a word. He looked astonishingly haggard. Draco had to remind himself that the man had been deemed healthy, as healthy as he could be. But there was a fragility around his eyes, a shadow creeping deep. He rose to his feet, and Draco faltered. For a moment, he feared the other man would come at him again.
“Have to get out of here.” Draco wiped his eyes free of water. He was soaking, rain dripping from his sleeves and trouser legs, running in rivulets down his arms. He looked around, but all he saw were trees, nearly black through the curtain of water. He spared a look behind him, then turned fully.
“They have to come with us,” she hissed. She didn’t know where or how, but she knew they couldn’t leave the students here. “Ron, we have to get them out.”
Oliver carried Luna outside in the mist of mid-morning. Her bone-white fingers trailed along the stone wall of the castle. She sang: her voice leapt into the open air and flew, louder but somehow weaker as well, no bounce of the echo to play upon the ear.
Dean Thomas stood in the centre of the hallway, his wand arm extended, but it was Katie Bell who was yelling, her face white with rage, at none other than Draco Malfoy. Jack Sloper stood behind him, an ugly look on his face, wand jabbing into Malfoy’s back. Tonks was off to one side, her wide eyes fixed on her cousin as if she could not quite believe what she… No, she was horrified. There was a sorrow on her face that Harry had never seen, not even during her morose periods. Her wand hung useless at her side, but that hardly mattered with the other three wands shoved into Malfoy’s throat and chest.
Harry skimmed over the timeline detailing evidence of Respondent Magic until he found the dates pertaining to Ancient Greece and Macedonia. He paused, finger resting against the cracked parchment over “ασπίς άσματος.”  Quilled with loving attention beneath the curved Greek letters was the English translation: Siren’s Ward.
had known and had taken her away from the corpse of her friend. Hannah was beyond help; Hermione knew that. She would never have left her otherwise. But for some reason, the end of that thought process was not coming.
“The normal set. But the razing hexes and the tri-level curses in these scrolls have a few old world modifications that ought to give Voldemort’s people a good stab in the side. There’s a nice trio of catapulting spells I’d like to give to any Slingers you have in your ranks, Viktor.”
Draco’s hand clenched in his shirt. He shoved Harry away, hard. Harry’s back hit the wall. Before he could reach out again, Draco pushed to his feet and backed away, leaving Harry winded on the floor.
“Oh god,” Harry gasped. He nearly fell again, and wound himself around Draco. “God, not yet.” Not yet. He didn’t know
“Think we’re stupid, do you? We’ll let you alone with him, that’s what we’ll do. You’ll just march in here after what you—”
“And I can’t ask that of her because I don’t love her!” Harry jabbed a hand into his chest, punctuating each word.
He saw a tongue, thin and flickering like pink fairy-light. It whipped in and back out to the safety of the hallway. Surely she could smell him. Blaise let one word of Parseltongue slip from his lips, barely audible, but the snake’s tongue flicked out again and lingered. Her nose edged into view, emerald green with black markings. She tasted the air, and Blaise felt the first ripples of fear. She had to come into the room. Had to be most of the way in. The idea of slamming the door shut upon her body as she entered came to him, but he wasn’t sure if he could seal it with her half in, half out, and then her head was sliding into view, much larger than any snake’s he’d ever seen, eyes too bright, too keen for a simple reptile. There was acute consciousness in their depths, thought, the weight of options. It was utterly cold, that consciousness, bleak and icy as snow, and far more calculating than that of half the humans Blaise had come up against. Snakes thought, of course, but
Draco’s pants had become uncomfortably tight early in the demonstration and he was fighting the urge to touch himself. On one hand (his left hand usually) he wanted desperately to stroke himself in time with Harry but on the other, he still felt nervous about it.
don’t,” interrupts Draco looking over at Harry with a scowl. His eyes dart down to the spleen and then Harry’s cauldron. He yanks the spleen out of Harry’s hand and replaces it with a jar of Flobberworm mucus. Harry looks back to his Potions textbook confused. He reads the first line again.
Draco watches the waiter leave with a nod, and exhales. He looks down at the menu in front of him. It’s fancy. Probably leather bound, with visible stitching at the bind. It’s a far cry from the stained laminates at the diner Goyle had insisted on, but not quite as extravagant as the dragonhide menus from Zabini’s choice of restaurant last night. Draco traces his fingers over the embossed name. He vaguely remembers Potter suggesting it -
Potter, of course, wasn’t impressed. “You’re a free elf now, you don’t have to listen to him,” he said to Dobby in a gentle voice before turning to Draco and fixing him with a chilly look.
When he reaches the spot – a hidden door quite out of the way on the fourth floor – there’s a moment when he pauses. Despite his excitement, he’s not so sure if he’s ready to know what’s really going on with Malfoy, especially since, whatever it is, it’s his fault.
Mrs Dunberg’s eyes dart over to Harry, pausing at the scar on his forehead. “St Eleanor’s, ‘round the corner.”
“You’re distracted,” he pointed out, pulling his lips away from Harry’s neck which he had been showering with kisses. They’d skipped lunch in the Great Hall to sneak into an empty classroom together.
Malfoy looks up at Harry with a sneer. “I'm not trying to make you jealous Potter. I'm trying to make you see that I am
Harry raises it with Ron and Hermione right after class but they don’t think it is as strange as Harry does.
Malfoy’s still waiting for Harry, and Harry has to do something. So, he does something incredibly embarrassing very quickly before he has a chance to doubt himself. He slides himself onto the bed underneath Malfoy. And let me tell you, Harry doesn’t think it was too silly of an idea at all when he looks up to Malfoy staring down at him, stroking his dick above Harry.
But walking in on Draco, in a supply closet of all places, with his shirt up around his head, a myriad of ugly red scars crisscrossing over his pale chest, Harry feels everything from that night all over again. Anger, confusion, regret and most of all, guilt. Guilt that presses down onto his lungs so hard, Harry isn’t so sure he can even
“I’ve been starved for company over the past week. As long as you’re here, you might as well entertain me.” Harry freezes. “…Only if you want to play of course.” Malfoy adds.
“I suppose I must thank you for saving me, Potter.” Malfoy’s cold voice replaces his laughter. “I mean, I knew the
“I knew you’d renege on the deal when you found out.” Malfoy’s voice is cool but it doesn’t mask the hurt in his eyes.
“What about what Harry deserves?” Hagrid suddenly speaks up. He remains at the back of the crowd but he towers over the rest and his voice carries. He peers down at Harry, his face a mix of confusion and fondness. “Is Malfoy really who you want, Harry?”
“You know what, just forget it, Malfoy.” Potter took a step back, disentangling himself from Draco. “I don’t know why I’m even bothering.”
Potter looked up as they entered. As it turned out, delaying the inevitable was not an option. “Potter’s not my friend,” Draco quickly corrected, before Potter got any ideas.
“It is your name after all.” Potter says in feigned lightness. Draco doesn’t look up, he can’t make eye contact, but he hears Potter breathe a deep sigh and then: “I know.”
“It’s not...I…Sorry…” Harry closes his eyes as the shame and guilt burn through his skin. “I vanished it.”
“Only I’m about to do something, and if I do it while I’m hanging out with Harry Potter, nobody can say anything. At least, not to my face. Not when the Chosen One is around.”
was something to smile about. And maybe, just maybe, Potter thought the same about a date with Draco Malfoy.
, Draco let go. It started off as a small whimper but became more intense as Potter responded with his own moan - and spiralled into what sounded like a competition of who could moan the loudest. (Draco.)
Almost at Slughorn’s office, Harry’s trying to work out how best to approach the system – play off Slughorn’s admiration for him or try and tug on his heartstrings - when he hears voices. He slows his pace to quieten his footsteps and creeps the remaining distance to Slughorn’s door. It’s slightly ajar and,
close, and surely he didn’t have to keep fidgeting and shuffling in his seat, and SURELY he didn’t have to try and pass notes to Draco. Were they suddenly back in first year or something?
Before Harry can even raise his wand in preparation, he is thrown backwards by a silence force. Instinctively he points his wand at Malfoy to disarm him, but Malfoy throws up a silent shield charm and then throws something else back Harry’s way. Harry dodges the spell’s path as he pulls himself up from the floor.
Draco intertwined their fingers, holding Harry’s hands up higher. “You’re usually a lot more hand-sy,” he said with a soft smile.
?” He asked. It didn’t make sense. Potter was the boy who lived, the golden boy, the Wizarding World’s saviour. He got everything he wanted. How could he not have clothes?
Theodore Nott sets down his knife and fork. “They’re letting him out tomorrow," he says calmly, diplomatically even.
Malfoy stops in his tracks and finally looks up at Harry. “I don’t report to you,” he says but he grabs his coat anyway.
It made him wonder what Harry had told them and if he’d mentioned…the incident. Draco had been friends with Harry for most of eighth year, and in love with him for most of his teenage life. And two weeks ago, one of his wildest dreams had come true – Harry had kissed him.
Although, Potter didn’t seem to understand who he was hiking those stairs for. At least, Draco didn’t think he had realised the significance of November third yet as he didn’t seem as resigned to their fate as Draco was. And when he finally made an appearance at the top of the Astronomy Tower, his first reaction was surprise.
Malfoy leans back on his elbows and looks up at Harry through deliciously long eyelashes. “I thought that was obvious, Gryffindor.”
Harry’s pauses in front of Kingsley’s desk. He puts on his sincere, noble face. The one that makes Kingsley give in to him every time. “If he’s really guilty of anything, I’ll have no hesitation bringing him in,” he says honestly. "But to put someone in the field who already believes he’s guilty before any proof? That’s dangerous. Hermione and I are the only Auror team here who will give him a fair chance.”
. It was a coincidence. It had to be. But still, something seemed off. On every other day, Draco never felt like this. Never felt anything other than hatred towards Potter. They were arch enemies. That was how it should be. This was wrong. Like he’d been cursed. Which didn’t make sense unless -
“I shouldn’t have to. The Dunbergs have done nothing wrong. Just leave them alone. It’s me you’re investigating anyway. Arrest me if you need to prove something to your superiors. Take me down to the station and question me. Throw your authority around a little.” Malfoy eyes Harry challengingly. “I know you want to.”
“Oh.” Draco closed the door and turned to Harry, crossing his arms, his demeanour instantly changing. “Then what are you doing here?”
Malfoy is talking to himself now, staring down at his wand as he twirls it between his fingers. “There are other ways to kill people too. He can’t stop me from
“Knox,” Potter suddenly whispered, killing the lights of the Astronomy Tower. When Potter spoke next, Draco could tell he was looking at Draco’s profile. Draco pretended not to notice. “Sometimes when there’s too much light,” Potter said, his voice taking on a more serious tone than earlier, “it makes it harder for stars to shine.”
Harry’s not sure when he started liking Draco Malfoy. But he does. As a friend and as…well maybe as something more. But it’s not right. Because Malfoy’s not right. And it’s the wrong time. Everything’s wrong. Merlin, how he wishes Malfoy could just be cured already. Except there’s a small part of him, a part that he guiltily tries to suppress, that is glad it is taking so long. Because Malfoy seems to enjoy his company. And when he’s cured, Harry’s not so certain he will.
Harry’s mouth fell open on its own. But it wasn’t the fire show that surprised him. He had seen it at Draco’s hand a million times before - each time as unique as the last. No, it was what Draco was wearing: a scarlet hand-knitted sweater. And Harry didn’t need Draco to turn around to know there was a big golden ‘D” knitted into the front.
“Her name’s Pepper,” comes Potter’s voice behind him. Pepper and Potter. Adorable. Draco turns his head to find Potter watching him and Pepper with fondness. Although it’s obviously more directed at Pepper than Draco. “Actually, would you mind feeding her?” Potter asks, his eyes turning back to the stovetop. “There are cans in there,” he gestures to a pantry beside the fridge without looking.
Potter’s note came back to Draco quickly, and Draco had to read the contents through several times while his brain short-circuited.
Narcissa raises her wand immediately directing it at her son, or one half of her son, the one lying on the floor at least. “Imper – “
There was only one thing for it. He leant forward to capture Draco’s lips with his own. Harry had enjoyed sparring with Draco - a momentary reprieve to the numbness of their wasted encounters, but this, this was more than just a reprieve, it was an explosion of feeling, the opposite of numbness. This was the real thrill Harry had been searching for. And from Draco’s enthusiasm, it was clear he felt the same.
And as much as he wanted to stare at Potter forever, staring at Potter incidentally made him want other things too. Many things that certainly couldn’t be done simultaneously, and several things Draco didn’t even have a name for. He started with something simple, but no less desirable. He pulled Potter in for a kiss.
Sure enough, Harry witnesses Malfoy start to slip up, he’s still dodging Harry’s spells but the misses are near, the movements only just fast enough. He summons his remaining energy and uses it full force to attack Malfoy with spell after spell, needing only one to break through and hit him. And yes – there it is – right in the chest. Malfoy is sent careening up and backwards. Now Harry just has to disarm and – but no, Malfoy’s about to hit the ground and Harry reacts instinctively, forgetting about the duel and casting a cushioning charm on the floor before impact.
Tonks jerked an arm behind her and stepped to the side so Harry could see. Leaning on the counter by the cafe’s coffee machine was a tall, blonde-haired man with pointy features and long limbs. He was wearing the standard cafe apron over a three piece suit and a crisp white shirt secured with silver cufflinks. Despite the cups piling up next to the machine left by the register staff, he didn’t appear interested in fulfilling any orders.
And yet, Draco could feel his own lips quirk upwards into something other than a smirk in response. He quickly controlled himself, reverting to an eye roll instead. Just because Potter was being childish, it didn’t mean Draco had to be too. Although, he still needed to have the last word: “Yes, it is.”
At the end of class, Malfoy jumps to his feet first, moving swiftly to the door at the back of the room. As he passes the back row, he catches Harry’s eye and smiles, actually smiles, not smirks, and says with a nod, “Morning, Harry.”
his heart threatening to jump right through his chest if he stays any longer. Merlin, it’s exactly the wakeup call Harry needs. He’s been so drawn into Draco Malfoy that he’d almost forgotten that it isn’t really Draco Malfoy at all, at least not in his proper state. And Harry needs to fix it. He should be fixing it.
favour?” Draco asked, glad Healer Gibbons wasn’t around to hear him speaking to a “patient” with such undisguised frustration.
Sorry, I’m late,” Harry said as he hurriedly tied on his apron. “I swear it was the tube this - What? What’s wrong?”
After Harry’s experience with the Ministry’s werewolf division last night, he’s not entirely convinced Malfoy’s wrong. “You should have told me about this.”
As soon as his hand touched wood, the beret launched from Malfoy’s head, hitting Harry square in the face. Harry didn’t have any need to be embarrassed though, not when Malfoy was sporting messy jet black hair atop his head.
Draco may or may not have dropped his phone at that point. He hoped Potter didn’t read into the loud clatter against his wooden floorboards. “Nothing?” He repeated as he retrieved the phone. “You answered my phone call
Harry hastily grabbed it, shoved it into his bag and after a quick side-eye to Draco to make sure he was doing the same, made a run for it. Harry was surprised, but not unhappy when Draco slid his hand in his and they ran together, Draco’s laughter in his ear.
He rose up higher on his broom and began to survey the field, searching for the tiniest spark of gold. His eyes followed the play for a moment – the Slytherin chasers were on their way to another goal. He needed to catch the snitch fast, lest it be too late. He narrowed his eyes and concentrated on that one little ball. Just when he thought he might have spotted the flutter of a golden wing, a whisper from behind almost caused him to fall off his broom.
As Draco expected, Harry didn’t believe him. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to make assumptions about - “
“Malfoy,” Harry said quietly, aware that their voices were likely carrying into the Great Hall. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
The Whomping Willow barely groans when Harry prods its base with a fallen branch. Each month it puts up less of a fight, resigned to the inevitability of Harry’s return. The long tunnelled walk to the Shrieking Shack is harrowing as always, damp earth closing him in on both sides, light fading behind, only ever darkness ahead.
The Ministry aren’t keeping tabs on those offered amnesty – Malfoy was insistent on this – but Harry knows a great number of them are being hosted at Malfoy Manor as he hasn’t yet removed the Homenum Revelio charm from his wand.
“Look, Potter,” Malfoy says in a surprisingly gentle voice, “I know you think there’s something here, so let me put you out of your misery: I have no interest in you. I don’t care what some half-baked wannabe clone said to you. It’s not going to happen.”
Draco just kept on pushing the note back across the table without reading it, and Potter would slide it right on back. But Draco couldn’t read it. He didn’t want to deal with this conversation now, the aftermath of the humiliating (but admittedly heavenly) scene last night. Potter would want to know things. And Draco had already revealed too much.
? But he would be lying if he said he wasn’t completely on board with the suggestion. So he did as Potter wanted, and pulled him into position for a waltz.
Harry complies instantly and without thinking, gliding his hand over from the relative safety of the side of Malfoy’s torso to the much more precarious zone at the front. He can feel the ridges of the old scars and he traces them up Malfoy’s chest and back down where they disappear beneath the waistband of his trousers.
Professor Slughorn sits hunched over the desk at the front of the room, three untouched quills scratching over long stretches of parchment in front of him. He glances up at Harry’s entrance.
Harry steels himself and corrects his posture before entering the classroom. He’s a Gryffindor, he can do this. So what if Malfoy is,
“Yes,” Potter said. He stood tall, his voice confident but Draco finally noticed the light blush on the edges of his face. “What do you think?”
And then he wakes up.  And it’s fucking masturbation time. Because what kind of person isn’t turned on by their own sex fantasy? Harry is sort of starting to realise now that he’s obviously attracted to Malfoy, and maybe has been for longer than he can properly remember, at least if his dreams are anything to go by.
known for its snogging couples, but it was decorated like Mrs Figgs house with uncomfortable chairs and old-fashioned tea cups. It didn’t really add up to be romantic in Harry’s head, so much as tacky. But if Malfoy thought it was romantic… “Wait, who are you meeting here then?”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, his anger obvious in the tightness of his hand in Draco’s, “I’ve had enough of dropping hints and chasing you. I know you want me. I just don’t know why you’re making things so difficult.”
That’s the problem. He had been doing that from the library, the Marauder’s Map hidden between Potions books so his friends couldn’t see. “I can’t always find him on the map,” Harry admits. “He always heads back to his dorm after class, but after that, I can’t find him. He just disappears.”
broken, sprained, bruised or aching. Even the core of magic deep within his chest splutters and fizzles, daring him to try one more spell. Luckily there’s no need for that anymore.
Harry’s eyes flickered between the batches of cupcakes baking in six different ovens while he mixed the next round of batter in a heavy glass bowl. “Three hundred and sixteen.”
Although he still can’t see Malfoy’s hand and more importantly the dick within its grasp, seeing his exposed arm moving up and down is all kinds of indecent on its own. And watching that point where his wrist meets the blankets is particularly mesmerizing. Malfoy’s so close to exposing himself. If the blanket were to slip just a fraction lower, or if he were to rut his hip ups just a little. Merlin, Harry finds himself waiting for that moment as he stares.
Malfoy stops pacing in front of Harry and turns to him slowly. And then laughs. Just throws his head back and laughs, loud and patronising. “I’ve tried to kill you twice, you’re tied up, completely at my mercy and you want to know if I ever
Not that Draco thought Potter was in love with him or anything. That would take a miracle. But just for this moment, that’s what Potter was showing him in his eyes, and Draco didn’t care if it was fleeting, he was going to hold onto that look for the rest of his life.
Ignoring his best friends squabble, another thought comes to Harry. “Malfoy said something last night. I think it was
But of course, such luck avoided Harry today. How he wished he’d had the foresight to brew some Felix Felicis.
There’s a second where Harry thinks Malfoy’s about to agree but then his face shuts down and he stands up, walking away from Harry to the top of the bed.
“His date?” Draco repeated. There was a roaring sound in his ears that he didn’t particularly mind. Harry liked him. Harry wanted to kiss him again.
“Oh, right.” Draco cleared his throat. He’d forgotten for a moment that this was about making Blaise jealous. A niggling disappointment settled in his gut. “I hope so.”
“Oh for merlin’s sake,” interrupts Potter, his face reddening again, although Draco suspects it might be more in anger than embarrassment this time.
Potter’s face relaxed; he laughed sheepishly. “You heard that? It's just something that happens when I'm not concentrating on what I'm saying.” Potter paused to think about it. “You know, when I'm reacting instinctively.”
Draco thought carefully. He didn’t want there to be any miscommunication about what Potter was suggesting. “You can pick me up at 6pm and we will apparate,
Relief hurtles through Harry’s body, from his aching feet all the way to the grin that overpowers his face. “Come here.”
“I didn’t mean your exact address, merlin. You’re really not going to tell me just because I may have been a
Hermione tears her eyes away from Draco Malfoy and looks around the room for support. “Are we sure he’s – “
Draco supposed he could have tried something on the dance floor, let his hand sink down Potter’s back, but he didn’t  want to ruin the dance. It was intimate. But not
“He means during Quidditch,” Draco quickly covered up, crossing his legs tighter and internally vowing to destroy Blaise for the most mortifying experience of his life.
At first Harry was embarrassed. He had allowed himself to be manipulated by Malfoy. Allowed himself to be distracted. Allowed himself to lose the game to Malfoy. How could he ever live that down?
“Ah yes, you’re finally here, m’boy. Dreadful business detention, isn’t it? I’ll be glad to see you out the door in an hour. You’ll be reordering the supply cupboard today.” He gestures to the open cupboard door. “Your peer has already made a start.” His nose scrunches unfavourably at the mention of Malfoy.
Potter ducked his head back around the door immediately, smiling as soon as he saw Draco. “Malfoy! I can’t believe I didn’t see you there.”
“Well? “ He asked, expectedly, without giving Harry any time to react. “Are you going to spoon me or not?”
Luckily, Pansy didn’t seem to find this odd at all and took obvious delight in being afforded a handshake. “Ooooh, nice firm grim there,” she commented with a mischievous grin. “Draco’ll like that when you–”
Now that was more like it. Harry stepped inside and followed Malfoy into the Sitting Room. He kept his eyes high, trying not to notice how short the robe was from behind. It didn’t appear as if Malfoy was wearing any underwear.
Malfoy turns to Zabini, who hovers two steps back, swollen lips curved into a menacing scowl. “Blaise, we’re going to the infirmary. And if I die, please kill Potter for me.”
Harry forces his eyes away from …that particular area…and refocuses on Malfoy’s face, which is perhaps a bad idea. As Malfoy’s face is even more erotic. Mouth open, panting, head thrown back, neck exposed. Good grief, it’s pornographic. And Harry really doesn’t need to witness this. He should be dreaming of overdue assignments, or even graveyards, not his childhood enemy, all grown up, and wanking so obscenely.
Potter’s hand drifted up to trace the outline of Draco’s lips. “Then maybe it’s you who’s been missing out.”
“Come back tomorrow,” Draco said from behind him - Harry froze, hope rising in his gut. "Just make sure you have some better material.”
“No, I didn't!” Draco crossed his legs nervously. He immediately regretted it when Blaise’s eyes were drawn to the action, widening at the implication.
The moon isn’t visible yet, still subservient to the sun before darkness descends, but Harry can feel it anyway, watching him, creeping over his skin, waiting to take him over. He shudders and keeps walking, focusing on one foot in front of the other, holding onto his humanity for as long as the day allows.
And Malfoy’s breathing is getting heavier and his hand is moving faster and good grief he must be close. One part of Harry is a little sad he missed out on the chance to touch Malfoy as he thinks it might seem a little silly to get involved now so late in the game (although why he cares what a dream Malfoy thinks of him, he has no idea) and another part is fucking randy and excited. Because he’s actually going to get to see Malfoy come now. And that is entirely unexplainably exciting.
Luckily, Potter is not dissuaded. “Then the night after. Friday.” He says, his smile holding Draco’s eyes in place. He can’t look anywhere else. “Dinner. Just dinner.”
plotting against the Ministry,” he says through gritted teeth. “I’m not part of this conspiracy you’re investigating. I’m only doing the work the
“If that’s a jab at my wealth, shall I remind you that you’re just as loaded as I am. You don’t need to have a 9-5 job either. You choose to waste your - “
“Come on, Harry. Who do you want to pick?” Ernie asked and then threw a hand over his mouth. “Sorry, I didn’t mean– ”
Teddy smiled, in that carefree way only a child can, and shrugged. He’d clearly heard every word. “It’s okay. Marley said her parents fight all the time.”
“I just don’t understand,” Malfoy whispers back. “Why would you follow me? Why would you punish yourself like that?”
Draco blanched, waiting for Harry to scream, or run, or laugh. But he didn’t do any of those things. At first, his face clearly showed his surprise, but he quickly controlled it.
And one day soon Harry Potter would give Draco Malfoy the strength, the bravery he needed, to say those words for real.
Harry ignores this, his attention solely on Malfoy who is conveniently avoiding his eye. “Using Zabini to make me jealous, Malfoy?” he asks. “That's low, even for you.”
Draco Malfoy turns back around. Blood leaks from the crown of his head, pooling at the base of his chin. It drips steadily into his outstretched hands. His lips move, forming Harry’s name and then more, but Harry can’t hear the words.
When he enters the Great Hall, Malfoy comes (no, no pun intended here unless you want) out of nowhere and brushes past him, and with a very clear sense of déjà vu, Harry follows him out into the Entrance Hall, where Malfoy is waiting. Obviously keen to speak to Harry as well. Although he doesn’t say anything, just stands there smirking, the insufferable bastard.
Draco didn’t bother arguing - Potter was never going to see him clearly anyway. So he just shrugged and deflected - a Draco Malfoy speciality.  “Why would I waste them on unimportant people?”
Potter was making Draco’s erection situation worse - if that was possible. But at least his words had drawn all the attention of the room now. No one seemed interested in witnessing Draco’s erection when they could hear about Harry Potter’s blowjobs. Typical.
“No, it’s not that,” Harry quickly clarifies. Sure, he’s surprised, but he’s not a total arsehole. “It’s just tonight. And tomorrow night. And maybe the night after. But breakfast and lunch, I’m all yours. Well, not
Potter made a noise - something between a snort and a whimper - before composing himself. “What a great idea, Malfoy. Thanks for the suggestion.”
someone else who could brew it for you.” Snape’s slow drawl is patronising. “I’m afraid you’ll be even less thrilled to ask for their help.”
Draco’s head whipped back to face Harry. “The machine’s obviously broken,” he said, his expression sulky.
“As stupid as this?” Draco asked. His hand went to the cuff of his sleeve but then he pulled back and just pointed at his left forearm instead. Harry understood all the same, although he couldn’t quite get Draco’s tone. Was he joking?
“Who are you talking about?” Harry tries again, desperate to understand what could have turned Malfoy into this. A small voice in his head reminds Harry that this was him. His potion.
Having already committed to the pointless task, Harry hurried forward and tripped over his own feet, falling right into Malfoy’s waiting – his reflexes were still as fast as they were in Quidditch – arms. Could Harry
Malfoy pulled his robe back on but he didn’t bother with the buttons. He perched himself back on his stool, one leg up on the footrest, letting the robe fly out beside him. Harry averted his eyes.
“When you’re actually using your two eyes to perceive vision, instead of letting a potion create it for you – which is so dangerous by the way, I can’t believe Felicia – “
“You’ll what?” Harry interrupted. “Calmly walk around me and get a bit of grass on your shoe? Sounds terrifying.”
“I’m sure it was a reflex. You made eye contact, he said good morning, he might’ve done it to anybody,” Hermione adds, her face serious but for a much different concern. “Harry, you’re not obsessing over Malfoy again? It’s not healthy.”
The change is slow. To a spectator, the opposite may appear true; the final physical transformation happens within minutes. But that’s only one small part of it. Prior to that, each of Harry’s senses heightens gradually as his body pushes out the human and welcomes in the wolf. By sunset, he can see each broken wing of the fly stuck in a silk net hanging from the far dark corner of the Shack, he can smell the chocolate birthday cake strapped to an owl sneaking into the Gryffindor Tower, and he can feel every hair on his body growing and thickening.
When Harry looked up, Draco was already starting back at him, although Harry could have sworn Draco was looking at his lips in particular. He stuck his tongue out and swiped it across his bottom lip, and Draco’s eyes darted right back down. Harry could feel his face heating up again. If he really was dosed with Veritaserum, he’d tell Draco–
Malfoy nods mutely and they both return to their task of reordering the supply cupboard. Harry wants to say more but he’s not sure anything supportive will sound genuine coming from his mouth so he remains silent. In the silence, his thoughts inevitably drift to the moon.
Him? Harry still can’t understand why Malfoy tried to kill him and now he wants to kill someone else as well? This –
“It’s just weird,” he said, as Harry ate the last bite of his chocolate cake. Draco had eaten his neatly.
“There’s maybe eight years worth of shit to unpack here, but…” she said, after Draco had stumbled to a halt,
When Harry finally stopped crying, he went to the loo to wash his face. Standing at the sink, his body began to shake with tears again, and he didn’t know why, because he felt better, but still they came—and so did Draco. He let himself inside, and held Harry from behind.
Suddenly, Harry realised what Scorpius reminded him of: himself, when Aunt Marge had come to visit. Except it was obvious that Scorpius had far more self-control than Harry had had, at that age. Scorpius managed a tight smile and took a sip of water.
“I’ve had a word with Andromeda, and she’s starting to agree with me. Teddy was terrified just now.”
Draco stood. Blaise seemed unwilling to get to his feet, as if he knew that once he left, he might never be allowed back. But finally, he stood as well, and looked Draco in the face.
Harry was very glad to have Blaise with him, the morning of Draco’s trial. Blaise burst into Pansy’s house like the magician from
boxes. Seized by an intense and sudden hopelessness, Harry took all the boxes and threw them in the bin.
“Okay,” she said, obedient as a child, and followed him to her bedroom. He had done it a thousand times, taken off her shoes and her bangles and her spiky earring, but he was scared of touching her, just then.
“You’re brilliant,” said Harry, two hours later, as they lay on the pitch. “You have to join the Cawdors.”
“Lucius,” said Harry. The anger he had expected to come did not arrive. This was the man who had nearly killed Ginny Weasley when she was only eleven years old. But Harry thought of Draco, musing about Bellatrix Lestrange’s potential redemption arc, and felt no anger at all.
“No, er, that’s okay,” said Harry. He had a good idea of how Seamus would glamour him. It would probably involve eyebrow piercings. “I’ll do it.”
That night, he sat abruptly up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, staring into blackness. Harry curled around his body in a u-shape.
“I’m fine,” said Draco, and he was. Harry had gone to an away game, that was all. (The Canons had replaced Harry so fast it still made Draco furious to think about it.) Harry was away—everything was fine—and Draco lost himself in his work.
Harry searched through the house for him. It was a herculean task, because Draco appeared to have invited everyone Harry had ever spoken to.
“I’m sorry I can’t give you career advice,” said Draco one day. They were sitting on the balcony overlooking the garden. Draco wore a thick, quilted dressing gown and shabby monogramed slippers. He clutched his cup of tea for warmth. He was always cold, since the attack.
Draco’s eyes were wide and serious. In his pocket, his phone alarm went off. He fumbled to silence it, and Harry let go of his face.
There was Marlon, who was stingy and always felt hard done-by— “But he’s got a really high-paying, high-stress job, and he came from a working class background, so he’s just a bit winded, still. I don’t know, I get it.” (Draco seemed to have limitless empathy for his regulars.)
love with him, or whether he loved Harry the way the people who sold knock-off Harry Potter action figurines in dodgy London streets did.
“So fucking what? Narcissa Malfoy didn’t get so much as a slap on the wrist, and Malfoy only got what, three months?”
He decided to go to Draco’s bookshop. Less intimate than going to the flat, he reasoned. That was the problem— they had become too intimate. Two single gay men shouldn’t spend so much time alone together getting drunk and talking about their feelings. If it hadn’t been for that, it would all have been fine, probably.
“Yes. And look, I managed to get a copy of this memo Chief made, saying to give me the files in order to ease
Draco was struggling among the many cushions on the floor, trying to get to his feet, muttering “fuck,
“Who else? Do you need me to beat someone up? I will,” said Draco, quite seriously. He could afford to be serious, because he knew she would never ask him to do it.
Malfoy rose to greet him, drink in hand. He was wearing muggle clothes, and he looked predictably, effortlessly hot, despite the purpled bruise on his cheekbone.
Dinner table conversation was stilted in patches. It was fine when Harry spoke to Ron and Hermione about Ron and Hermione things, and it was fine when Harry spoke to Draco about Draco things, but any attempt at a conversation that included all four of them at once was a monumental failure.
Draco didn’t look as if he was listening, but Harry knew, from the soft downturn of his lips, that he was.
Harry woke the next morning with his face buried into Adelaide’s shoulder. Draco’s arm was wrapped around his waist. Adelaide was breathing in delicate little snorts.
“I guess. I mean, he sees his muggle friends literally every day. And you know how traumatic it was for him to see Dean and Luna. He did it so that you’d start hanging out with us again.”
Harry leant his head forward into Draco’s chest, and Draco put his hand to Harry’s hair, touched the braids Ginny and Luna had left.
“Really? You wouldn’t AK someone for an ice cream?” said Harry. It was very late on a Wednesday, and Harry lay on the kitchen floor, because there was no food in the house and it was hopeless.
“It’s… a collar. And if you think the starter word, it turns you into a kitten. Then all you have to do to transform back is think the safeword.”
“Listen, when the guy I’m with comes out, will you bugger off? He’ll think I’m just talking to you to impress him, or something.”
So Harry lay back on his makeshift mattress, and gave Draco water whenever he woke, in fitful bursts, throughout the night.
The last one had been to Blaise. They hadn’t spoken for a month afterwards. It was Blaise who had cracked, of course, because Blaise was the lonelier one out of the two of them. He had shown up at the flat, miserable and sharp, and said “I still think you’re a bell-end.”
It was late. Harry felt, unbidden, a strong desire to yank Draco’s shoulder and force him to look at him.
he got up to on the walks between classes, but he often thought, as Steven cast cutting hexes at his back, that Harry must practically saunter backwards.
Draco felt his heart flutter, and not in the sickening way it had started doing when he climbed the stairs to his attic bedroom. No, this was in an entirely different sort of way. Harry treating his mother with respect. It was nice.
“Was that you? I remember him telling us about that. Well, listen. I’m not asking you to forgive him. But please, for the love of God, can you hold off on reproaching him? Until you know him better?”
“Any time,” said Harry, then cringed, because that made it sound as if Harry would happily bail Goyle out of the next hate group he joined. Goyle nodded and made to leave. “Goyle! Wait,” said Harry.
Blaise’s flat was the most archetypal bachelor pad imaginable. Blaise himself was staring out of his enormous glass windows when they arrived.
“You can, on this. Hermione’s been working on it. It’s fitted with an in-built hammock spell. If you fall off, you’ll just slip into a cushion of air. We ran it by St Mungo’s and they said it was fine. Firebolt have actually bought the patent off Hermione; they’re going to start putting it on all their brooms.”
After Hogwarts, Harry saw a mind healer. He started getting some sleep. He processed all the grief, all the guilt. He started feeling more like himself again, and he tried to forget about Draco Malfoy.
“Show starting in ten minutes?” said an eager young boy wearing a full face of make-up, pressing a flyer into Harry’s hands. Harry nodded and the boy ushered him into a nightclub—a gay nightclub, Harry guessed, judging by the clientele. The boy pointed up some stairs. Was it stripping? Was it gay stripping?
“With thought damage, you’re just hurtling around a closed circuit, looking for an escape. The only way out is if someone opens a door. If someone says something that breaks the circuit.”
of people, have the right to hate me. For the rest of my life. And that’s fine. I don’t like it, but I’m okay with it; it’s fair enough.”
“It is, and it isn’t,” said Harry. “But I promise not to resent you. If I realise I actually do, we’ll talk about it. Okay?”
“Yeah, yeah, good,” said Neville. He was looking at Harry too hard, with an expression that was almost pleading. “And you?”
The article came out the very next day. They had posed for formal pictures before the interview, but the one they chose for the front page was a candid. Draco was speaking. He looked guilty, fragile and beautiful. Harry was holding both of Draco’s hands in his own, and was staring at Draco as if he was the only thing on earth that mattered. Their legs were tilted towards each other, and they looked as if they
“We both think he knows more about magic and our world then he lets on to,” George mused as he pretended to think hard.
“I hope you understand, but I can’t tell you about where I’ve been. I have people to protect. People I care for and that have cared for me,” Harry gave in only slightly, careful of each word he said. “Please rest assured I was well taken care of. I have been safe with them. These people saved me from the abuse my relatives put me through as a child.”
That was a good question. Was everything okay? Would it be? Only time would tell. Nymphadora and Remus shared a knowing look before they both sat down at the table. Their bodies and minds fatigued after the long morning. Remus placed the bag of candy he had brought on the table, intending to hand deliver them after talking with Molly.
"Not really in the mood, Gray," Harry let out a massive yawn as he stretched his arms above his head.
His eyes widen in shock as he watched in slow motion as his knife travelled directly towards Drew’s forehead. He could not react or do anything in time before the inevitable impact to his boss and mentor. Squeezing his eyes closed tightly and turning his head away, he waited for the sickening noise of impact and spurt of warm blood to hit him. But it never came. So with a racing heart, he slowly opened one eye in hesitation.
Sure enough, when they opened the door and Harry stepped inside, he was attacked with a hug by Draco, the boy sobbing countless sorry’s into his shoulder. Harry hugged him back and whispered his own sorry. Severus broke the two apart and they went over to the couch, Severus to his chair. Draco pulled Harry over so they were sitting super close to each other, hands laced together. Harry closed his eyes and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, slowly fall asleep, feeling safe and secure with Draco by his side.
“I don’t believe much of what you say, you are always hiding something,” said George, also narrowing his eyes.
And silence is what he got. Everyone froze as the usual calm and cheery Headmaster of Hogwarts yelled with a vicious undertone. Those closer even felt the powerful flick of his magic, his anger lashing out of him in waves.
Drew shook his head as he walked in to the kitchen, nodding to the people that acknowledged his presence. He lent down in to the fridge, seeking his meal he had put aside.
“Oh thank you,” he closed the book in his hands, smiling towards the other man. “You didn’t have to.”
The pocketknife vibrated in his hand for a second before lifting a few inches in to the air. It begun to float out of the alleyway, Harry following closely behind it to ensure he did not get lost. He carefully walked along the fairly quiet streets, his guard up at all times and wand at the ready. Anytime someone new started walking on the same path, he would spend time observing them, looking out for signs they see him.
“What, w-who are you?” Petunia’s groggy voice filled the room as she turned her face to the right away from the intruder.
century, many based in the middle of giant blocks of well-maintained land. This sure did look like the type of area a pure-blooded, rich family would buy and live. And Harry was correct in assuming as the pocketknife begun to slow in it’s travel and turned to what looked like a gravel driveway that led to the middle of an empty paddock.
“Well then why are you worried?” Drew asked with a frown, placing the book down and gesturing for Harry to sit.”
“There’s nothing pressing so I shall speak with you tomorrow,” smiled Harry tiredly. “Tell Grayson I am okay, will you?”
Nodding his head as he took over wiping his own face dry, Grayson stepped back and stood close to Tina who he thought as a mother figure. As Harry stood up, the small crowd begun to exchange hand shakes and hugs. Wishing him a safe mission and to behave as much as he could. The last person to say their farewells was Drew. It made sense. He was the one to take in Harry, he was the one to mentor him, he was the one to bring him up all these years. The two men stood there for a few seconds, green eyes staring into brown eyes, both filled with sorrow. Without a word, the two embraced each other in a strong hug. Drew pulled away after a minute and patted the younger on the shoulder.
“Alright, let’s get you inside. I’m sure Draco is worried about you,” Severus said as he stood up and helped the young man to his feet.
“Molly, this is Harry Potter,” Dumbledore finally spoke up after a while. “I was hoping you would be able to allow him to stay here until the new school year begins. As you know, he has a lot to learn in a short time, and I was thinking being around wizards his own age would benefit him greatly.”
The kitchen window blew open slightly from an invisible force, catching Molly’s attention. In came a silvery Phoenix in all of its glory. She temporarily placed the cooking eggs under a charm to keep them from overcooking or burning. Placing her spatula down, she turned towards the silvery-white bird knowing what it was there for. The other occupants of the room turned their attention to the corporeal patronus, tension filled the room as they waited for the inevitable message that was to come.
"I think we can learn a few things from him, not the other way around," said George, slightly shaking his head in disbelief.
Harry whipped his head up to find Narcissa standing at the now opened door. Shit, he needed to get out as soon as possible. While Narcissa couldn’t see who he was, she could now see his outline. Without hesitation, Harry lifted his hand and stunned her. He winced as her stiff body hit the ground. Harry quickly secured the diary in his inner pocket of his cloak before standing up. He walked over to the door and paused as he heard a rushing set of footsteps.
A dark glint settled in Dumbledore’s eyes as he turned around and sat behind his desk. If he was to go ahead with this and successfully get Sirius Black out of Azkaban, he could at least hold this over the other’s head for a while. None of this would be possible unless Dumbledore was to help him. Not the three Auror’s, not Harry, no one but himself could free Sirius Black. He could perhaps guilt the imprisoned man into doing his deeds down the track. Yes, perhaps it was worth it in the end.
Repeating the same action over and over again, Harry couldn’t help the smile that stayed on his face. Giving the Short Skinner a decent workout, he swapped the knife for another less used knife; his Ka-Bar Short Tanto knife. Running his hand along the smooth leather handle, he smiled at the blackish-silver blade reflecting the sun that shined down through the branches. Taking the usual stance, he focused his eyes once more on the red and white target in front of him.
“He has already sent you a letter? I owe Parker double his pay on the next mission now, damn,” the man chuckled as he wiped a hand over his tired looking face.
“I would be honoured to be taught by you,” said Harry, turning his head to look at her with a kind smile upon his face.
Drew who held his wand in one hand and the knife in the other, carefully walked back towards Charlie while showing off dangerous looking object. Charlie merely shook his head in amusement as he followed his boss back out in to the living room. The two paused near the cupboard under the stairs as they heard movement from above. Drew looked up and saw the marker that had been in a separate room from the others moving around. He watched with intent as the marker came out in to the hallway and moved towards the staircase.
Dumbledore, Minerva and Severus all flinched as the onslaught of book meeting flesh begun. They watched as the young child fell to the ground and withered in pain from the assault. Harry turned away from his uncle to hide his emotions, staring at the corner where three invisible adults stood. Tears streamed in rivers down his face, his green eyes expressing all the torment he had suffered while in this very household. Thankfully all three begun to rise out of the pensive, finding themselves back in the room they had left from.
Standing still in shock, Remus played over the entire interaction he had just had with Harry. The younger male had left such an interesting first impression on him around the first time and he did not disappoint this time around either. The way he had conducted himself the whole conversation was breathtakingly spectacular. He had never seen a young person so in control of things in his entire life. Harry was in control of the conversation, the topics, the mood, his emotions, his reactions; it was truly incredible.
“I have been personally trained by the highest Curse-Breaker at Gringotts to dismantle complicated and dangerous spells, charms and curses. But also how to perform them as well in case I need to use them,” Bill said with a smile towards the two Aurors. “So I can come and help if you would like.”
Of course he already knew all of this. From what he had observed the night he broke in to their manor, he could tell that the Malfoy spawn was a snobbish, spoilt, rich kid. And he could feel the air of superiority hanging around the head of the family; the man had complete control of the room as soon as he entered it. His research had shown him all of the applications made by Lucius to dethrone Headmaster Dumbledore. And while it wasn’t a bad thing in his eyes, part of him was glad the elder had not been successful in his endeavours. Otherwise how else could he be having his fun during this month?
Ignoring everyone else in the room, he continued eating his food slowly. His thoughts briefly turned back to the newspaper article before he thought of the future. He wondered how long until he would come face-to-face with the cold hearted killer that he was destined to either destroy or be destroyed by. He couldn’t also help but wonder what the first encounter would look like.
But their moment was ruined when the portrait opened and the one and only Severus Snape entered his private quarters, well it was meant to be private. But he found two teenagers- no, young men- sitting on his couch. He walked over to them and sat in his chair that was his, and anyone who sat in it would be damned.
This meant he would need to go over his plans and start reshuffling some cards. Dumbledore needed to keep Harry safe. He needed to keep his location unknown. He needed to make sure Harry got the training done discreetly. Perhaps letting the whole Order of the Phoenix know Harry had been found was not the best idea. There were so many people that could spill secretive information to the media.
“Yes,” he said, and they went into the bathroom. Draco knew his way around Harry’s shower, of course, and Harry watched, helpless with wanting, as Draco tested the temperature. And it was just right, when they got in. Perfect. Draco poured out a small puddle of shampoo into his hands and worked it through Harry’s hair. Harry stood still. His back was heated by the warm water, and Draco’s careful fingers massaged his scalp, grey eyes fixed on Harry’s hair. When a bit of foam fell onto Harry’s forehead, Draco wiped it away with a small, focused frown.
There was a moment of silence. Then Draco looked up. Big grey eyes in a thin pale face. He had the colouring of a black-and-white photograph. It was so obvious, now that Harry looked at him. It was so obvious that this would feel good.
He heard Draco get into bed and allowed himself to turn around. Draco had already put his arms under the covers. Harry turned off the light and got into bed as well.
Fortunately, Draco was also drunk, a fact that was made evident by the way in which he immediately leant into Harry.
“Twenty-three is too young to be settling,” said Hermione. But Harry felt as if his life was emptier than ever. With Ginny as his girlfriend, he was at least theoretically not a loner. Now he was adrift. How the hell was he even supposed to date? He hadn’t been single since he was eighteen. Everyone in the Wizarding world knew his name and had his fucking Chocolate Frog card.
“We broke up. I don’t want to talk about it. Can I use that stupid cat collar? If I have to be in my head another minute…”
“Reveal yourself,” Severus barked in a low tone, confusing Dumbledore as he seemed to be the only one left that was unaware of the current situation.
"No you are right," the other male chuckled, standing up and heading towards him. "Merlin help the day Harry Potter doesn't successfully kill a target," the young male said sarcastically says as he shakes Harry Potter's hand in congratulations.
"Yes. I've got a lot of prep for the next day with you know, getting revenge on the Dursley's and getting ready to leave for Hogwarts and all that," he mused with a dark, playful smile on his face.
He threw one last look of disgust at his reflection before he got into the shower and closed the curtains. At first he just let the hot water stream down his body and the steam clear his mind, but then he started to slowly clean his body, careful to be gentle on the cuts and bruises. After he was clean, Harry rest his forehead against the wall and soaked up the silence and the feeling of hot water he hadn’t felt since his last time at Hogwarts.
“The sooner we do that, the sooner we can get his trial underway and open 12 Grimmauld Place as an option to Harry,” Alastor said confidently, knowing exactly what to say to convince the Headmaster. “And perhaps he will be indebted to you, meaning the Order could use the place as Headquarters if the need is there.”
“So sad I can’t stay around and watch the show. We have so much to catch up on Petunia. Maybe one day, very soon, I’ll visit again,” Drew chuckled darkly as he stood back and took in the view. “Not that you’ll be remembering any time soon.”
“We were waiting outside for him, when Ron and Ginny heard a loud bang upstairs. We all rushed up and he was gone from the room,” Arthur continued, clarifying what he meant.
“Percy is the only one of my son’s that is not here. But this is Bill and Charlie,” Molly pointed to her two eldest children across the room. “Ron, who is your age. And my only sweet, little daughter Ginny.”
“Harry? Are you okay?” Snape asked, sweeping some hair out of Harry’s face and tucking it behind his ears.
A knock on the closed office door brought Albus Dumbledore’s attention away from the large pile of paperwork. Flicking his head, he wondered who was visiting at this time of the day. Surely the Order had not finished collecting all of Harry’s school supplies yet. It was way too early for anyone to be reporting back to him about the outing. Perhaps it was one of the Hogwarts Professors that were currently on the school grounds. His interest peaked as he saw the two male Auror’s enter shortly after the door opened.
“Yeah, I can imagine,” said Ron. He ran a hand over his face. “Fucking hell. You’re seriously in love with Malfoy?”
Harry remembered what Blaise had said, about Draco not feeling seen unless people were treating him badly.
Harry had the feeling he wasn’t talking about Draco’s wand. In any case, Ollivander did not make any more uncomfortable remarks. He flew straight to a box on a shelf, stroked it eerily, then handed the wand inside to Draco.
Harry and Blaise had started having lunch again. In fact, Harry had started having lunch with a lot of people, when Draco was in New York, and he had kept it up. It was nice, seeing people so often. Having different people to consult for different problems. It made him feel balanced.
“Not always,” he said, and Harry was transported back to standing at the top of the stairs, to Draco telling him that he was scared, but not because Harry was frightening.
“I never lie about geography,” said Malfoy. “But is this your plan? A chaste, hour-long capitals quiz?”
Harry had a sudden flash of Draco, waiting by his laptop to talk to him, and eventually realising he wasn’t going to show.
“Draco,” said Harry. “Whenever you want—if you want—when you’re ready, or whatever— will you go on a date with me?”
Harry smashed his phone several times against his kitchen counter, but it was a Nokia, and indestructible.
“You haven’t seen my memories yet,” he said. He had sent them in to St Mungo’s so that Harry wouldn’t have to talk to him in order to see them, but it was obvious Harry hadn’t watched them. If he had, he would have been gentler. Draco was sure of that.
“Hang on,” said Draco. Harry was sucking up iced tea through a straw. “The first time you tell me you love me, you also decide
That's a wrap! Aylaar, I hope you enjoyed your gift, with a nice Harry the way you like him! Nilolay, your wisdom was invaluable, thank you for helping me get re-inspired midway through, and Tackytiger, thank you for talking things out with me!
“I do,” said Michael. “I wish I didn’t. You’re a coward, Draco. You were a coward in the war, and you’re a coward now. You’re not a real person. You’re just a paper cut-out of a man.”
It was after he said the words that the anger started to burn through him. He still felt it now, blinding him.
“You should levitate her, Draco,” said Goyle. Malfoy shook his head again. He sat gingerly at the edge of the hole, clinging to his mother’s body, and jumped.
, for calling Hermione a mudblood, for catching the DA, for  almost poisoning Ron Weasley, for almost killing Katie Bell, for letting Death Eaters into the school, and countless other awful things Draco had done. He was intimately familiar with the cringing, soul-shrinking shame of those acts.
“He’s not going to belong anywhere. Merlin; what are the chances he’ll make a single friend by Christmas? Because I reckon, with me as his father, he’s as much a chance of being popular as Eloise Midgen had of being asked to the bloody Yule Ball.”
“Then you’ll have your answer,” said Hermione. “I can’t deny that I’d rather you fell for someone else, Harry. I don’t want him to waste your time.”
Perhaps Draco did not realise the extent to which his sudden presence, his burning hurt, would incapacitate Harry. He only went the next aisle over, which is how it was that Harry overheard his entire conversation with Adelaide.
Harry went to Dinsmore’s shop. Bland-faced Cynthia told him Draco wasn’t around. He went back the next day, and bland-faced Cynthia told him that Draco was busy. On the third day, he caught Dinsmore.
“I do, yeah,” said Draco, taking in Harry’s kitchen. “At least, my parents do. I couldn’t have one when I had muggle flatmates, though, and by the time I got my own place I was sort of…used to… Good Christ, is that troll-leg umbrella stand?”
Draco didn’t answer. The broom had slowed, and Draco’s shoulders shook and shook. Harry hugged him tightly.
“So he was with Hugo for a while, then?” asked Harry, sensing that Ursula was more invested in the chips than in the conversation.
After his trial, Draco was given a portkey back to the manor. There wasn’t anyone waiting for him there.
Draco was silent, his jaw twitching. Harry edged closer to him on the sofa, put an arm around his shoulders. Draco stiffened, but only for a moment, just the way Cassie used to, when Harry held her.
“I think I didn’t realise how much everyone was hanging out one-on-one behind the scenes,” said Harry.
these episodes were only temporary. He soon found he could sleep through the night without waking himself with dreams, and he got hungry at mealtimes again, and stopped crying at unpredictable moments throughout the day. It was easier to be alive.
“I think we can help each other, Pansy,” said Hermione. “You want to know where Draco is, and Harry wants to know how he can get Draco back.”
“SURPRISE!” they shouted. Lee Jordan set off indoor fireworks. There was confetti. Harry was baffled.
That afternoon, Hermione had said the potion would be ready the next day. Harry was hugely relieved. Draco had seemed more than usually unhappy lately. They had been seeing more of each other than ever, because Hermione had them constantly practicing the wordless, wandless animagus spell. Draco had already mastered it, but it wouldn’t work until he had taken the potion to permanently allow his body to morph.
“You’re terrible, you don’t even mean that,” said Harry. Draco looked up at his block of flats and saw—
Draco noted that the “please” negated the order of the “tell me.” But Steven’s previous command took hold.
“Draco,” said Potter, his nose nudging against Draco’s, and then he dipped in for a slow kiss. Draco made a high noise in his throat, and Potter tilted his mouth away, rested his forehead against Draco’s. His hands were on Draco’s neck, now. “I’m sorry,” he said.
The rest of the half hour passed like a nightmare. Malfoy was as good as word. He didn’t make snarky remarks. He didn’t smirk. He didn’t roll his eyes. He was saccharine and obedient. He promptly followed all of Harry’s instructions, and came ostentatiously while fucking himself with a red dildo. It was exceedingly hot, but also disturbing, because it felt like Malfoy’s body had been hijacked by this pliant interloper.
“Oh, God,” she said, and began to cry. Harry sat awkwardly next to her on the bed and patted her shoulder. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m so sorry. You must think I’m beyond pathetic. I mean, compared to you, I have no reason at all…”
“Okay, well. I just wanted to…” Harry didn’t know how to finish. He wanted to storm across the room and press every inch of himself up against every inch of Draco, a lost ship finally coming to port. Instead, he pulled his mouth into a smile. “Thank you for organising the tea cabinet.”
Draco resisted the idea for a while, but then he thought of Harry’s warm hands, his strong arms, the soft way he said Draco’s name. Draco didn’t call. He just went to Harry’s flat.
,” said Harry darkly, and Draco laughed and kissed him. Harry hadn’t been sleeping well, hadn’t been functioning in general, but Draco still made him laugh almost every day.
“We almost understand each other already,” said Draco. Still watching him intently, as if he was trying to guess what Harry would say before he said it.
and the slippery idea that had half-formed in the back of his mind would be lost. Over and over it happened, and there was no way out, for him or for Adelaide, and after a while he stopped worrying about it. There is a level of misery which makes higher thought impossible, and Draco slid easily into it, unsurprised and resigned to what adulthood meant for him.
He had waited until the next day to speak to Ron and Hermione. The night Draco went back to Neville, Harry had just gone to bed. It was peculiar, how different heartbreak felt to the usual ways he experienced misery. He was conscious, even as the loneliness tore at him, that it was a much friendlier sort of unhappiness. The war memories felt mechanical, somehow, as if they weren’t emotions designed to be felt by humans. This pain, if nothing else, was human, and Harry was grateful to Draco for that.
), after she’d led Tertius upstairs to salve Tertius’ anger with sex, Draco managed to sit up. He retrieved the hand towel from under the sofa cushion and held it to the back of his head, which throbbed sickeningly.
Harry ran eight miles on Saturday morning. Ron and Hermione had slept over the night before, because they knew how anxious he was, and how the anxiety seemed to translate to muscle pain. It had helped a little.
An hour later, they both lay on the cushions on the floor, lazily talking about nothing. Harry yawned.
“How hard can it be to fix a bloody roof?” said Draco, jumping out of his chair. “I’ll do it myself! Listen to me. You will give me the entirety of my fortune—” Jaggers scoffed, cuntishly, at the word
“Don’t be weird,” said Harry. Draco shifted, and Harry put his arms around his shoulder and kissed the top of his head.
“Astoria wanted him to go to Beauxbatons. No one knows who I am, in France. That’s partly why she—she had a life insurance policy—they don’t do scholarships like Hogwarts does. But—”
And then Harry remembered how powerless Draco was in this relationship. If anything went wrong, he would lose everything.
“Okay, then. Well, he does. So, if you don’t mind, he’s promised to do some extremely dirty things to me with his mouth, and I—”
“You’ve become so thoughtful, Ron,” said Hermione. Her hands were out of sight under the table. Harry had a strong suspicion that they were on Ron’s leg.
Sometimes, Harry would watch his memory-self realise for a split-second who it was that he was sleeping with. It was usually when Harry kissed his way down Malfoy’s arms, and encountered the Dark Mark. Harry could see his past-self pull back in surprise, and then the horror disappear from his expression as he forgot what he had seen.
“Thank you,” said Draco. Harry’s eyes flickered between Draco, who was naked except for the duvet he had wrapped around his waist, and Klaus, who seemed to have given up on finding his boxers and gone straight for his jeans. After what felt like a very long time, Klaus was dressed.
, bringing him tea in the middle of the night, anyway? For some reason, Harry kept thinking of the way Malfoy had laughed when Cedric Diggory died. How
If Timothy noticed that Harry was going through the motions, he didn’t say anything. Harry couldn’t think, couldn’t feel a thing. He poured his mind into his body and tried to lose himself in grim, ruthless pleasure.
“You’re just doing this to humiliate me,” Harry told the judge. Hermione made a small moan. He  ignored her.
They caught each other’s eye and burst into peels of helpless laughter. Draco actually cried with mirth. Harry didn’t think he’d ever laughed so hard.
“Do you think we can put Dumbledore as your employer for that? Shame he can’t give you a reference.”
Pansy burst into tears. This seemed to be happening to Harry a lot, these days. He patted her awkwardly on the shoulder.
“I hate making you sad,” said Adelaide. She put down her fork and burped slightly. “scuse me. Do you regret taking me?”
Harry thought of his complete inability to engage with his friends. His shitty, well-paid job and his habit of floating through conversations without really being there.
“He hasn’t put a toe out of line in over ten years, Spooner. I seriously doubt he’s doing blood rituals.”
When Harry complimented him, however, Draco usually blushed furiously red and told him to fuck off. Only rarely did he seem to believe that Harry was being sincere. On those occasions, he would temporarily become ineloquent and bashful, in a way that Harry found utterly charming.
Within about fifteen minutes, it became apparent that he could walk out and have a little panic, or stay and have a big one. So he walked out.
Pansy took a leave of absence from work. Narcissa was always at the house, wraithlike and absent-minded.
“I listen to her,” said Draco, and it was true— when  Hermione spoke, Draco always stopped what he was doing and paid close attention, as if he was in class.
book, the one that was largely porn, and he blushed almost constantly as he read. Draco found it very distracting. Especially because Harry would sometimes glance up at Draco with a thoughtful look, his pupils wide and dark, and then blush even harder. It wasn’t difficult to translate what he was imagining. Draco had read
“I never thought it was fair, that you were so good looking,” said Draco. Harry laughed incredulously, and when he opened his eyes, Draco was smiling.
“Dad’s spoiling me rotten,” Cassie told Malfoy. “If you don’t come back soon I’m going to be awful.”
Potter’s jaw was clenched, and he was frowning. He looked much more emotional than Draco himself felt.
“I signed the bloody contract,” said Draco, turning from him, but Potter was closer than he had realised, and Draco knocked into his firm chest. Potter’s other hand caught him at the waist, and then—
He wanted to bring something, but shopping was hard for him. People always bothered him, and it was difficult to pay under the invisibility cloak. Kreacher bought food once a week, but nothing that Harry could bring as a gift. In the end he didn’t bring anything.
They were walking over to collect Draco from Arithmancy. It was one of the few times when Harry could discuss him behind his back.
“If you don’t want us to do anything, I’ll back off, no hard feelings,” said Harry, trying to sound sincere.
He tried to get to sleep. It was no use. Had it been a dream? It was late. He went into the garden in his slippers and noticed the way the moonlight gilded the lilies.
I’m the hero of the wizarding world. People bother me at the pub sometimes and I go home and freak out about it like an idiot.”
“Right. Well…” Harry pushed his hair out of his face. “Your dad was always… well-dressed, in school. I mean, he always looked good. He was really handsome. All the girls were after him.”
When Lucius was done, Draco passed him a glass of water. He carried on stroking his back as Lucius drank, then kissed his father lightly on the temple.
“Well,” she said. “Thank you for your help, Mr. Potter. I’m sorry to have bothered you. Could I use your floo to go to my Aunt Pansy’s house?”
—maybe at first, a bit? But I genuinely felt sorry for you, and I was grateful, so I wasn’t—I mean obviously it was self-serving, but that doesn’t mean that my feelings for you aren’t—I know you won’t be able to trust me now, but you have to believe me—”
No, it wasn’t remorse he was feeling, he decided. It was just… it was just something so painful he couldn’t stand it.
Potter looked good on his broom. Potter looked good all the time. Potter was good. What a joy it must be, thought Draco, to know that you added value to the world.
Harry turned onto his side and pressed his nose into the small hollow behind Draco’s ear. Draco jerked away with a breathy laugh.
“Malfoy?” said a voice. He sat up and saw Potter, wearing Auror robes, looking like an After shot in a misleading advertisement.
“Yeah, and it turns out if there’s no one pushing me I’m a total fucking waste of space; I know, Malfoy.”
The sex itself was quite fun—they both kept laughing. But after it was over, Seamus rolled onto his back and was quiet for a long time, his arm over his eyes.
“The thing is, though,” said Harry, as if they were continuing a conversation they had already started, “you can’t keep punishing me like this.”
“Someone must have got to him while you were gone, Harry, and ordered him not to communicate,” said Hermione. “Professor, I know we all have reason not to trust Draco, but he’s in danger. We have to remove the bond, and soon.”
“Oh, pull yourself together,” said Potter impatiently. “Once he’d cursed me, he asked your mum to check if I was dead. She lied and said I was.”
When Harry woke up the next morning, the kitten was still curled up on Harry’s pillow. He watched Harry with wide awake eyes.
“Once the cab was moving, to my great dismay, the young man opened the cat carrier. The cat leapt forth with vim and vigour, instantly penetrating the drivers’ cabin. He had long, cruel claws, and he was deranged. His eyes— I swear his eyes glowed red. He was the Devil’s envoy.”
“The curse has been broken,” said the healer. “From here, all the symptoms will roll back, and the healing spells we cast should take effect. In six months, he’ll be good as new.”
Predictably, Harry got the first job he applied for, as a tutor for a fifteen-year-old witch who had to be homeschooled for health reasons.
mystifying. He had gone, apparently, from Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, to… cake farts guy? When had that happened? (“He’s just fucking with you, Harry,” said Ron, when Harry tried to subtly find out if there was a way he could give off a less cake-farty vibe. “Ignore him.”)
“Not again, for me,” said Harry. Draco picked up the ring and laughed. It was the ring Harry had bought him last time— Harry must have pilfered it out of Draco’s dresser drawer.
Harry didn’t wait for the rest of the Misery Household. He called Draco as he walked home. He felt too rangy and restless to apparate, he needed to
They had never revisited the conversation about why Malfoy didn’t want to let Harry fuck him. They just held close and touched each other and sucked each other without negotiating; figuring out what was right each time by instinct. It was no different now, but it occurred to Harry, as he gripped the back of his own neck to stop himself from touching Draco’s hair, that they seemed to understand each other perfectly when they were silent. It had never been so good with anyone else. He had never felt so in sync, with anyone else.
It was Hermione, and she always knew what to do. He slumped in his chair, relief surging through him.
Their lips were so close now that if Draco didn’t Do The Right Thing they were going to kiss, as sure as falling off a cliff.
“You mentioned he got a job at his uni library. It was easy, I just went in and asked for the blond librarian,” said Ron.
“What?” asked Harry, and Draco knew, he could hear, how close Harry was to blowing up. “He hasn’t let Draco say a word all evening!”
thought Harry, at the same time as he felt strange, affectionate jealousy, mixed with apprehension about the thunderous expression on Cassie’s face.
“Okay,” Draco had said. The real estate said he wished he had known. He would have gotten in some champagne.
“Bon appetit,” said Hermione, handing Draco a hip flask. He took it from her with a nod of thanks, swigged from it, and handed it back.
After Draco’s parents had spent a solid ten minutes touching his face and hair to reassure themselves that their son was indeed still alive, Harry interrupted.
“You’re sorry? Oh, how marvellous,” said Malfoy. “Now I don’t feel betrayed at all. Marry me, Nev! Marry me!”
Malfoy described it in detail, telling him the history of the move, using sketches to illustrate it. When Malfoy explained quidditch, it felt like being taught how to read— meaningless shapes suddenly became patterns that could understood.
“All Marked Death Eaters will be held without bail until trial.” Then, seeing that this answer didn’t seem to have satisfied Harry, Kingsley smiled. “I’ll be overlooking their treatment myself, Harry. You can stop worrying about saving the world.”
it, of course. But, as Anthony Blunt said of Louis MacNeice, he’s totally and irredeemably heterosexual.”
“This world’s real enough to me,” said Draco, and Harry knew he had upset him. He could tell from the way Draco’s voice had become neater and more precise, his posture straighter, everything about him refining and heightening. He shrugged on elegance like a coat he had thought he was allowed to take off, and Harry didn’t know what to do about it. If he apologised, Draco would act as if he was crazy— Harry knew him well enough to know
thought Draco, and he tried to pull away before Harry could punch him in the face. Harry stopped him.
One recurring dream featured Colin Creevey. In the dream, Harry ran towards the quidditch pitch. Colin ran after him, his camera covering his face, saying
Harry was trying to get out of his comfort zone. He kept going to Luna’s stupid events, didn’t he? Although, he had to admit to himself that Lamorak Toujours was a compelling reason to go in his own right. He never had much time for Harry, because he was so busy chatting to everyone and introducing people to each other, but whenever they did talk, Harry felt shiny and interesting. He suspected that was just part of Lamorak’s skill as a host, but Harry couldn’t help falling for it. Ever since that baffling day that Malfoy had accosted him in a lift and asked him if he was gay, Harry had been wondering if he should just… date a guy. He knew he’d like to. It wasn’t as if any of his friends or family would have a problem with it. He just sort of
Draco didn’t do the knife act so often anymore. He had other acts, just as ethereal, just as lovely, but not so heartbreaking. Harry went whenever he could. He loved his job, but he loved other things too: lunch with Hermione, pub nights with Draco and his friends, going to Mars with a crowd of muggle burlesque dancers, visiting Luna and Dean at their farm near Winchester. He loved lounging on the floor cushions of Draco’s studio, chatting shit as Draco designed costumes.
“I hope you aren’t angry that I’ve come without warning. I’ve been thinking about you and Teddy a lot. Family’s important to me.”
Goyle let go of Malfoy’s hand and picked up Narcissa as gently as if she were a sleeping child. Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bobbed crazily up and down his throat as he watched.
He instantly fell to his knees. His thoughts flooded back, and he noticed that he was laughing uncontrollably.
“It’s a joke, Misty,” said Draco, because he could see that she was struggling to look at him. Misty was intensely relieved.
The news of their relationship spread quickly, largely because of Seamus, who insisted on loudly firecalling everyone he knew the moment he found out. When Harry asked who
Draco had never felt like such an intruder, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave. He was overwhelmed by their kindness in including him in what was obviously a personal moment for the three of them.
“I don’t want him!” shouted Harry. Draco looked up. Their eyes met, and then Draco’s gaze slid blandly away to look at the floor. Harry took a step towards him, then stopped himself. Draco was in love with Steven, after all. He didn’t have a right to be offended if Harry didn’t fancy him, when
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to make of that. In the end, it was the “sincerely” that decided him. He knew that Malfoy’s sign-offs tended to be meaningful, so he assumed that Malfoy was sincere in his willingness to meet up with Ron.
“There’s no ‘of course’ about it, Harry,” said Hermione. “You were horrified when you found out you were married to him.”
Draco hated his boss, and his boss hated him. Mr Dinsmore suffered from the kind of insecurity that masks itself imperfectly with arrogance, and there was perhaps no better way for Mr Dinsmore to show that he was a brilliant Potions master than by telling anyone who would listen that Draco was abysmally shit. “Everyone who would listen” was the customers, and the shop girl, Cynthia. Draco liked Cynthia as much as he disliked Mr Dinsmore. Cynthia had a bland sort of face, and listened to Mr Dinsmore’s anti-Draco screeds with the heavy-lidded impassiveness of a cow being read a poem.
“Of course,” said Draco. “It’s so… new. It’s exciting. I wish those men in masks hadn’t been there. God it’s hot. All right, I’m going to take a very cold shower and then remain perfectly calm.”
“So you’re dying, eh?” said Blaise. “A bit anti-climactic, after all the shit you survived in school, don’t you think?”
He picked up the two mugs, walked up the stairs, and rapped on Harry’s door carefully with one knuckle.
Again, he wondered that she could say such things, things that he would never have thought his mother would think. But as always, she was right. Draco had grown up rich and privileged. The more he learned about Harry, the more he realised all the ways in which Harry was better than him. Other people overcame things. Draco, meanwhile had had everything a person could need to succeed, and he had fucked it right up. He’d used up his advantages. He was through.
“Sure it is,” Potter said. His voice had grown softer. “Maybe you just need a little assistance in forgetting about him.”
Draco stared at Harry for a moment – far too long a moment, Harry was starting to sweat – and then pulled out the chair across the table and sat down. He propped his chin on his hands. “What’s the full truth?”
“Trust you?” Harry echoes automatically in disbelief, before realising he actually might. This smiling Malfoy, has a calming effect on Harry and he isn’t sure what to make of it. “Sure,” he adds before he knows the word is coming out his mouth.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered open just in time to watch Harry jerk back and shoot out an arm to grab the golden snitch, still fluttering above Malfoy’s head. Harry tightened his grip on the snitch and stepped further back, leaving Malfoy alone in the shower. He winked before he left and called out over his shoulder.
Unfortunately, in the excitement of the moment, Draco forgot that perhaps he might have to talk to Potter again after this humiliating night and whispered “Yes, Potter,
Harry still hadn’t quite worked out that something but it was beginning to play on his mind more and more.
A plate slams down in front of Draco pulling him out of his reverie. Although, really, it’s placed down rather gently by Harry’s hand, but it might as well be a slam from the way Draco’s body reacts, jumping back so suddenly that it lifts his chair precariously onto only its back legs. Potter’s hand is lightning fast - of course, the perfect bastard – reaching out to steady Draco’s chair and place it back on all four legs.
Hermione stacks her papers and packs away her ink and quill. “It’s getting late. He might not even have any visitors tonight. We should–”
After a myriad of tosses and turns, Harry notices Ron roll over to face him. “Why are you still awake?” He whispers.
“From the colour of the potion and Mr Malfoy’s limited information, I take it you were brewing Felicia Falcon’s eyesight enhancing potion?”
He took a large sip of his coffee and used the opportunity peek out over his cup to see where Potter had gotten to. He must have finished ordering, because he was hanging around the counter now, one hand tapping on the back wall of the cafe. Takeaway it was. Draco dropped his cup and turned away before Potter looked up.
“Welcome everyone,” the woman was saying into the microphone with a slight shake to her voice. “On behalf of the Mayor, I’d like to thank everyone for attending, and of course, your generous donations to tonight’s selected charity: Second Life, which provides housing and food for refugees.”
Malfoy’s pale cheeks quickly fill with colour and the words come out in a rush: “Can I sit with you in the Great Hall?”
Zabini went first, daring Daphne Greengrass to kiss Parvati Patil. Greengrass rolled her eyes and led Parvati into one of the dormitories off the common room.
“I’m Harry Potter,” Potter repeated on one note, just as Draco came close enough to see his face properly in the dark corridor. His eyes were closed, and his face looked oddly relaxed, a vacant look that gave Draco the impression Potter’s mind was far from their conversation.
how you conduct yourself, no wonder all of your fan club still think they’ve got a chance. You have to be
They both froze at the same time. Harry’s last name on Draco’s lips, something they had been so careful to avoid, reminded them both of their current company. They turned to Teddy in unison.
Draco wasn’t so keen on inside. There was less opportunity for private kisses and a much higher likelihood of being stuck in dull conversation with boring socialites. But Potter was already heading in and Draco had no intention of leaving his side….to keep up appearances, of course.
Seems a little desperate, a little pathetic. Engaging in small talk would be awkward and horrible so that’s out. There’s really nothing Draco can say. Draco curses himself for not thinking this through before calling as the silence stretches across the phoneline.
“As much I enjoy wasting my time with you, let’s get straight to it. You want to know if I know any werewolves.”
Malfoy spins around the bedpost and sits down on the edge of the bed. His eyes land on Harry’s with dizzying intensity. “I don’t have any injuries but I’m sure you can come up with another excuse to touch me.”
“Just leave him. Maybe if I give him some space, he might – maybe he just doesn’t want me. I thought even now, he’d still feel the same. I still feel the same. But he doesn’t. I love him. And he doesn’t.”
There was no way Malfoy could outdo him. Not unless he’d made 316 croquembouches. And Harry didn’t take Malfoy for a baker. Still, he was nervous that Malfoy wasn’t on the pitch yet. The rest of the Slytherin team (including one Ravenclaw beater since Slytherin house were short on numbers) were on their brooms flying around, waving at the crowd, with carefree smiles. Just what was Malfoy planning?
It’s just a casual question but Malfoy replies “No,” too quickly. He must know he’s given himself away because he follows the lie with a wince.
Kingsley looks up at Harry with tired eyes. Outside the office, they’re good friends. But here, Harry’s always testing him, and often Kingsley has to remind him who is Head Auror.
Potter still hasn’t looked up. He is fumbling around in his pocket his face screwed up in concentration, until he pulls out a set of glasses. Of course! It seems silly now that Draco couldn’t pick it. Who is Harry Potter without his glasses?
He glances back up to the exit Malfoy had taken and then to the other two entrances to the room.  “Fuck it,” he decides and pulls his trousers and pants down as one. He strokes himself all in a rush, just eager to finish. He thinks of the feel of Malfoy’s cock in his hand, of those high-pitched moans in his ear, of Malfoy’s lidded eyes staring back at him and it doesn’t take long before he’s coming on Malfoy Manor’s expensive shag carpet.
Harry stands up, shoving his hands in his pockets. He looks down at Malfoy with a tight grip on his concealed wand. “For now.”
,” Harry offers weakly. In truth, he still doesn’t get why it’s funny. Especially not when he’s serving his third detention because the cranes off-balanced Hermione’s potion and coated the entire room with a healthy dose of iridescent sludge.
“Ahhhh, yes very interesting ingredient, asphodel root. Excellent choice Miss Granger.” Slughorn beams down at her.
Potter was a terrible dancer. Dreadful really. Less than half a minute in, Draco couldn’t take it any longer. He grabbed Potter’s arm from his back and placed it on his shoulder, returning his own to an appropriate height on Potter’s back. As soon as Draco was leading, the dancing improved immensely. At least Potter could follow direction.
“I already have dinner plans.” Draco explains, already knowing he’s not going to get away with a vague answer. Must Pansy really know everything?
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I don’t bear you any bad will, Potter. Just don’t give me any special treatment.”
Draco felt a tightness low in his chest – a familiar jealously Blaise always brought out. “Fine. Whatever,” he said, not caring to hide the bitterness in his tone. “You’re welcome to Blaise. But when you find him cheating on you on your new faux-dragonhide couch, don’t come running back to me, Potter.”
“Then,” Travers leans in like he’s telling Harry a secret, “he’s not a person.” His colleagues laugh.
Once Draco no longer had the dancing to fret over, the situation suddenly hit him. Potter. So close to him. And worse, the eye contact! Where else was Draco supposed to look than right in front of him at Potter? And where else was Potter supposed to look but right back? The silence between them seemed strange, weighted. Draco couldn’t bear it.
“Okay. So how would you guess it would react with doxy eggs?” Hermione asks, a little too casually. Harry silently prays Slughorn won’t put the pieces together…
Harry feels Hermione’s hand on his shoulder. If it is meant to calm him, it isn’t working. He shrugs it off. “Do you know who broke in?”
As Draco turned to leave with Teddy, unplanned words tumbled out of Harry’s mouth. “Actually, Draco, wait.”
He fumbled over his words, trying to remember his purpose for following Malfoy. “I – I – You cheated.”
Movement catches Draco’s eye and he swivels around. A small black cat watches Draco from its position perched above the fridge. Draco looks to Harry for permission but he seems too occupied with dinner. So, Draco approaches, slowly, one arm outstretched, giving the cat plenty of time to run away if it wishes. But it doesn’t.
“That’s a fairly obvious one, Potter. Anyone who's seen my skin would know that.” They reached the Dungeons and Malfoy whispered a password to what looked like an ordinary wall but immediately sprung open at Malfoy’s words. “Your hair gets messier the madder you are,” Malfoy said over his shoulder as he led Harry into the Slytherin Common Room.
Draco looked down at his arm. The dark mark had faded back into his skin and the stinging sensation had reduced to a dull ache - a reminder of the pain. It would seem as if his expected and yet impromptu time with Potter was over for the day. And now he had a charming erection to deal with. On his own.
As soon as he could wrench his eyes away from Potter, Draco turned his focus to the shade of green paint he had created. He’d have to start again from scratch. It was nowhere close to the real thing.
“We don’t have to do this right now if you’re not in the mood,” Draco said gently, tracing identical patterns into Harry’s palms.
Draco averted his eyes from Harry’s crotch - it wasn’t his fault it was at his eye level from where he sat, like a regular person, on a CHAIR. “Well, you’re certainly not as hard as I’d like you to be,” he commented, safe in the knowledge it would go straight over Harry’s head.
Somehow Draco figured Potter was going to say something like that. “Fine, but I - I don’t know what to say.”
Draco groaned and kicked his blankets off so he could sit up. “What’s the point? I’m not his soulmate! I’m not his true love. I’m not anything!”
Malfoy eyes close and he bucks his hips forward, encouraging Harry to explore a little further, running his hand down the length of Malfoy’s cock and letting his thumb rub the head gently.
“I didn’t know what it would do,” Harry admits, his voice coming out weak due to the pressure in his chest. “I’d never used it before.” He takes a shallow breath - it’s all he can manage. “And I never will again.”
“I know what Hermione had in mind,” Harry interrupted, pouring his batter into the last cupcake tin he could find. He’d have to do some cleaning before he made another batch. “And it’s not going to work. Malfoy might not be a Death Eater anymore but he’s still a Slytherin. He’s still competition.”
Draco almost gasps at the brilliance of Potter’s words, that intelligent bastard. It’s the perfect way to confirm their d – arrangement for tonight without having to address the other night’s fight. Draco could just kiss him. Or, you know, not because that’s a stupid thought. He just appreciates intelligence is all.
Harry snorts.  It’s a piss-poor explanation. “People still think it’s not natural for same gender couples to be together and that’s stupid. So, you saying we can’t both be alphas is stupid as well.”
Harry reaches out in search of Malfoy’s shoulder but doesn’t find it. “Not talking about it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.”
Somehow, Ron’s laughter grows louder, tears spilling down his cheeks. Even Hermione joins in with a snort at Harry’s expense. Harry crosses his arms and refuses to look at any of them until Malfoy transfigures the tie back to green and silver.
Oh. “Right.” Draco feels a little silly now for overreacting but he can hardly be blamed. With so many people in his life babying him constantly, he’s allowed to be a little on edge. A touch paranoid. But Potter still hasn’t actually done anything to deserve his wrath. So he best tread carefully, lest ruin another friendship. He already fucked things up quite spectacularly with Blaise.
Draco dropped his gaze back down to the table and– “I like your eyelashes,” Harry blurted out. Loudly.
“Would you like to go back alone and cast all the spells yourself?” Hermione asks through tight lips.
It look all of Harry’s Gryffindor courage (and plenty of recklessness too) not to look away. “You leave me breathless.”
Harry knows he’s sporting a stupid grin on his face, but he can’t bring himself to care. Not after that kiss. Although, it droops a little when he notices Malfoy isn’t smiling.
Draco nodded politely, following Harry’s lead. “Thanks for looking after Teddy last week.” He blew a kiss to Teddy. “Bye Teddy.” As was their custom, Teddy caught the kiss and placed it his his pocket. “Bye Harry,” Draco added, already halfway out the door.
The moonlight streamed through the window, and Timothy’s eyes found Harry’s in the silvery darkness.
Now, Harry was faced with the fact that there were only two options ahead: tell Draco the truth, and shatter Draco’s fragile self-belief, or disappear, and break his heart.
“It’s a bit anti-climactic; surviving,” said Draco. “Everyone’s gone back to treating me like normal.”

, thought Harry mutinously, as he wandered through Grimmauld Place’s new rooms. There was a portrait gallery now, and something that looked like it might be a small, private opera house. None of it made him feel better, but it did distract him.
But after they had both come, Draco didn’t put on his usual, cheerful expression again. Instead, he propped himself up on his elbow and looked thoughtfully at Harry.
Draco thought of Seven, telling him to breathe in, breathe out, but it was hard, because his throat had closed up, and he was suffocating.
Draco stared at him, then slowly, purposefully, rolled up his sleeves. The Dark Mark bruised across his forearm. It provoked a visceral reaction in Harry, like seeing maggots seething in a dead body. He flinched and looked away.
“Because the things I did were evil and when I remember them I want to throw myself off the astronomy tower and I can’t imagine how anyone could live with themselves with so much guilt and grief—you
Kreacher found him another bottle of alcohol, and eventually, Harry passed out at the kitchen table.
“I’ve been thinking, though,” said Harry, feeling brave. “I think you should move in to Grimmauld Place with me.”
“Oh, be realistic, Harry. There’s no chance the Ministry would have approved him to be an animagus. And it’s too dangerous for him to be an unregistered animagus; he’d be thrown in Azkaban if anyone found out. But if he
“I’m sorry about how I proposed last time,” said Harry. “I was just nervous, I reckon. But will you? Will you marry me?”
Next to him, Draco breathed in sharply. Harry reached out, meaning only to touch his arm, but Draco grabbed his hand. Harry squeezed it—gently, it was Draco’s right one—and Draco stroked his thumb back and forth over Harry’s knuckles.
“You will go mad if you stay,” she said, or Draco told himself. Draco had known, deep down, that he was losing his mind.
