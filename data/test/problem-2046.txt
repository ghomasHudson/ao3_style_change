“Where are we going?” asked Draco when Potter pushed aside a tapestry and led him up a hidden staircase for the
“No, it’s not,” said Potter stubbornly.
“Don’t mention it.” She yawned. “I’ll give it another week before the Falcons fire you and request me. And then I’ll snag me a player.”

Well, Potter could shove it. Draco hadn’t been the one to start this childish ignoring game, but he sure as hell would win it. He brushed the Frog to the side, but it resumed its immensely irritating position almost immediately.
Hansen cleared his throat. “It’s Potter ...”
anticipated was Harry overturning his coffee table in an attempt at pushing it out of his way.
“I said I’m sorry!” pleaded Potter.
Ron shook his head. “That really was an accident. Greyson lost a huge bet because Harry couldn’t play for so long afterwards. That’s why he kept pestering him to return.”
“Answer.”
Draco wondered if Potter knew when Draco was on duty and stayed awake for it, or if he just didn’t sleep at all. Both seemed equally likely, which wasn’t exactly a sign of him getting better.
Harry was still for a second and then snatched the Evening Prophet (of course it had been made breaking news) away from him with an annoyed look. “I thought you didn’t read that rubbish?”
Harry sighed, brushing some of his hair out of his face. “I can’t pretend that I never accidentally looked at other peoples’ memories.”
Pansy protested heavily, but none of it made it past Blaise’s hand.
He had played with his hair and stroked his arms and looked him in the eyes and kissed him lovingly. He had spent hours just listening to Harry breathe, not exchanging a single word. He had fallen asleep with his arms around him and Harry’s head on Draco’s chest.
“Great,” Draco mumbled. “I don’t think Greyson will settle for middle ground. He seems more like the upper hand kind of guy.”
and then started all over again.
Perfect. Seemed that Draco was in for a fun evening.
Harry snorted, obviously caught off guard. Draco didn’t turn his head, but he could feel the side-eye on him. Harry sounded severe when he said, “It was supposed to be a surprise.”
“Fine, hurts like a bitch. Matt won’t be happy.”
suicidal?”
bad,” Harry muttered, clearly uncomfortable.
Where was he supposed to go with that? Good thinking, Draco!
“I wish,” Potter said tonelessly, charming the empty plates and containers to scrub themselves in the sink. Before Draco could ask anything else, Potter got up and rolled up his sleeves. “Alright, on to the fun part.”
Now let’s see how persuasive Harry can be! 😊
Draco didn’t know where the year had gone. This time last year he had been fully expecting to spend Christmas at St. Mungo’s and then return home to Aurelius. No presents, no Christmas dinner, just Draco and his dog.
Coming from Harry Potter, Draco was almost inclined to believe it.
Draco shook his head. By now he was pretty sure that Potter’s head was filled with a thousand tiny Snitches and nothing else at all. Or maybe it was just one giant Snitch. Or a single tiny Snitch and the rest was hot air. Most likely that.
. No one has ever done that before or since.”
of them. Maybe he meant homosexuals? But why spare Harry? Just because he wasn’t full on gay? Or did he get to be the exception because he was Harry Potter?
“Must be your bad influence.” Draco grinned. “You’re the one who set the standard for bringing deadly animals where they don’t belong and sneaking into places you shouldn’t be.”
“Fell on the way to the bathroom,” Potter muttered, thoroughly dusting off his joggers (even though the floor looked like it had not seen any dust
Potter stared at him in disbelief, a muscle in his jaw twitching. Samantha took an unconscious step back, as if fearing the two of them could attack each other at any given moment. Which, frankly, Draco would not be all that much surprised by.
But nobody reacted to that, because then Olivia turned the page and all the girls started cooing at once, leaning in as close as they could.
“Okay, here goes.” Harry breathed in, pushed some stray hair out of his face and pulled the right leg of his joggers up, revealing a massive amount of scar tissue around the knee.
Harry laughed again, for real this time, and Draco’s heart beat a little faster. When things had taken a turn for the worst during the attack, he hadn’t deemed it possible that he would ever hear his laugh again. But here they were.
Before Draco could protest again, Harry placed his hands at opposite sides of the Pensieve. The surface swirled and then cleared to reveal a memory.
After a year with him (and also the fourteen years before that), Draco was used to Harry crossing his arms and glaring at him.
a kiss. Potter had gasped at the impact, and now there was tongue involved. Draco wasn’t below calling it a magical experience.)
Without waiting for a reply, Draco slammed his locker shut and made his way outside.
“Are you aware that essay is due tomorrow?”
After that there were two broom-related questions, which all three of them answered enthusiastically, and then another one aimed at Harry’s love life, which he straight up ignored without a word, prompting Samantha to sigh deeply again and Blaise to just call upon another wizard.
somewhere down the corridor, and then, by the sound of it, somebody came rushing into the flat.
“That’s no Muggle,” Harry whispered back even more quietly. “They would have remembered they left the stove on before they even got to the door.”
“He didn’t

Harry bumped his shoulder lightly. His voice was very gentle. “You didn’t do it. You never could’ve done it.”
convenient,” Draco said. Why had nobody ever told him about the food light?
Harry’s face may have been completely distorted, grotesque, but it didn’t change his olive skin, the stupid wild mob of hair or the bright, green eyes looking up at him, afraid and confused. Of course it was him. Draco could’ve told by any one of those things alone.
You should take him there!”
Harry faked a hurt expression and unwrapped the box. He ripped the wings off and then offered Draco the body, which was rather nice, all things considered.

“I thought you couldn't do that anymore?”
scattered.”
And then there was the noise. He was surprised Harry could stand all those explosions and death. Draco’s hand felt cramped from clinging to Harry’s the entire time. Maybe he was used to those things by now. Most movies seemed to be somewhat explosion-heavy. Besides, Harry could handle himself in direct attacks. What he really seemed to be afraid of were ambushes, people breaking into his house in the dead of night.
Draco didn’t even wait for Greyson to pick up speed, but cut right across him. “I’m sure you have very

His eyes were flickering towards the left hoop, so Draco made a dash for the middle one, where the Quaffle would most likely end up. Harry hurled the Quaffle, which went flying right at Draco. Too late, Draco raised his arms to catch it. It went right through them and nailed him in the head.

dying?
“You’re kidding, right?”
Draco breathed in deeply and leaned forward in his chair.
He didn’t want Potter to push him away.
Draco almost got his wish when he tripped over something hidden beneath the shallow fog just a minute later. He made a startled noise and crashed to the ground, landing hard on his hands and knees.
“Draco Malfoy. You are under arrest.”
And that was all the warning they got before Slughorn descended upon them not a second later.
“Of course!” cried Valdez. “And today I get an owl from their Coach, telling me they’re letting me go because allegedly
Potter just looked at her blankly, his mouth pressed together in a thin line. Draco had a feeling that Potter had more than one reason not to stay at the Burrow,
Harry seemed to think so too, because he didn’t address what had happened but grabbed Draco around the middle instead. Then he carried him into the bedroom, practically throwing him onto the bed.
“I’ll knock

there a quiz before assigning houses?”
Ron came back then, all of six Healers and three mediwitches in tow.
“I can’t!”
“So ... I believe nobody wants this to leave the room,” Draco began casually, straightening his clothes. “Seeing as there are regulations that clearly forbid the Chief to have relations with his or her subordinates.”
“Or that you smell,” Potter added.
He just wanted to get this over with so they could examine Harry before any potential damage became irreparable. But he knew it was no good to argue with him, and there was no way he could subdue Harry.
Draco nodded slowly. “Yes, thank Merlin.”
“Are you trying to bribe me?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
There were several photographs. Teddy on his training broom, looking incredibly tiny while flying between Harry and Draco. Passing the Quaffle along while hovering just a few feet above ground. Harry teaching Teddy a sloth-grip roll with Draco standing by, ready to cast a cushioning charm. The three of them sitting on the grass afterwards, eating sandwiches and laughing.
“A Pensieve.” Draco’s voice sounded hollow even to him. “I don’t think I want to see.”
The others all made various noises of unease and then Theo said, sounding slightly awed still, “Right, I forgot you did that.”
,” Draco agreed.
“Most of it?” Harry repeated, furrowing his brow.
Healing her only took half a minute, but when he looked up, the whole stadium seemed to be watching him intently. The Arrows’ Seeker seemed to be the only person who was not looking down at him, slowly scanning the pitch instead.

Potter did not look. This was fact, because Blaise and Theo were watching him all through breakfast and would have told Draco immediately. Instead, they informed him that:
"Malfoy!"
Harry raised his eyebrows at him, a move Draco was certain he had picked up from him at some point. “I probably could do it without my wand, you know? Want to test what remains of the tapestry if I try?”
That was why he said, “You

Cortez didn’t look at all happy and Draco was sure that her mind was working fast, trying to find a way to avoid a possible lawsuit and still be able to fire Draco. Potter seemed to sense her hesitation.
There were several loud

“Oh, no,” Draco spluttered, leaping to his feet so fast Harry fell into the empty space Draco had occupied. “That’s not… we’re not. No.”
“That’s the one. She caught one of the Snitches. Auctioned it off for about two hundred galleons.”
Draco nodded, eyes back on the frozen mouse he was thawing with his wand. He had a feeling he should find it disgusting, but in the end, this was just another cadaver.
Draco frowned in his state between half-awake and half-asleep. They really should let Harry rest. A low moan came from his bed.

to remember, Draco! If I don’t tell you now, I’ll forget and then it’ll just go on!”
Draco scrambled onto the bed, shut the curtains and fortified them with about three different spells. “What are you doing here?”
Harry frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
The sentence trailed off awkwardly, like Potter himself wasn’t sure if it was finished.
Draco got up and leaned against the wall to stop the world from spinning so much. He could barely follow their conversation. It felt like his brain was lagging miles behind. There was something about a bed that was nagging at him.
promised Teddy to go flying afterwards, and that would be just the three of them.
Draco didn’t have time to think about the best approach. He just turned over the slab of skin and flesh, and cut around and underneath the oval scar liberally.
Potter pushed down Draco’s arm, which was still raised into the air. “Blaise and I split up. And this is Muggle London, so put away your wand.”
Potter yanked the chain again and sat down when the swing held. He gestured to the second swing at his side, but Draco stayed put, frowning down at him.
“You know, the Snitch,” he said, gesturing at it as nonchalantly as possible. “It

“Because you broke your back like an idiot. Don't worry, you'll regain full function – it's just going to take some time.” Draco did his best not to sound too worried. Insults were always good with Potter, right? Familiar terrain.

Draco shook his head in the face of such ignorance. “So you can finish your meal on a high note, of course.”

“That’s funny.” Harry didn’t look all that amused. “You say you don’t want to get back together. But then you come here, wearing that t-shirt, and I’m thinking that maybe you
Now it was Potter’s turn to scoff. He returned into a straight position, folding his hands in his lap, and traced the scar on his right almost incidentally. He was uncomfortably near, and Draco leaned back as far as he could without tipping this chair over as well.
Then Marc folded his arms atop the counter and hid his face in the circle of them, groaning loudly. “Oh, Lord. Please tell me you didn’t.”
“I could have,” said Draco easily. “But that would have been less fun, wouldn’t it?”
Draco sat down next to Blaise and slung his arms around his legs. His chin found its place atop his knees. For once, he didn’t waste a single thought about how it would look with him sitting so undignified and Blaise the picture of regality.
She took a deep breath and then, finally, looked him in the eyes. “I just wanted to say … I’m happy for you. If you’re happy, I mean. And if you still wanted to get coffee sometime, I’d be up for it. Maybe not with the Quidditch Guys. But Courtney could come?”
Thank you for going on this journey with me. I had a lot of fun and I hope you did too. 😊
“He has Potter’s eyes and mop,” commented Abrams nastily. “But it seems to be your hair colour, doesn’t it?”
Harry’s hot chest was pressed against Draco’s, and his hand kept brushing through his hair recklessly, and his lips were soft and demanding all at once, and Draco’s heart felt like it would burst out of his chest any second.
Draco flagged down a mediwitch and pointed at his patient. “Get me someone from Potions for bed seven. I need a consult on the contents of that cauldron.”
If he just knew that Harry would be alright, he could face Azkaban. And if he wasn’t alright ... well, then the worst had already happened to Draco.
“Ever thought about getting a dog?” Draco asked, watching Aurelius blink sleepily.
, Harry! How many times do I have to tell you?” she said exasperatedly, but Potter just looked at her coldly. “Fine, then stay at the Burrow. Molly doesn’t have to work anyway, and you know she would
“You could write to Matt and tell him it was McCarthy’s fault,” Harry suggested hopefully. He let Draco pull him to his feet and then accepted his help putting on the Invisibility Cloak as well.
Draco rolled his eyes, pushed up the sleeve of his wand arm, and marched towards the place where the chaos was thickest, passing a group of mediwitches who were debating whether it was unethical to just knock out the Saviour of the Wizarding world, especially if they needed at least three simultaneous spells to do it.

“I’ve got one,” muttered Harry, still frowning. “So, Theo’s blackmailing you?”
“I do want your body –” Harry said, vanishing beneath Draco’s Cloak, “– as a human shield. Walk me out?”
“That’s the spirit!” Greyson bent down, opened it for him and then helped him drink it before Draco could even protest.
“She definitely deserves it more than me,” Harry grumbled.
“Wow,” Harry breathed into his ear as the crowd dispersed. “They look like you just cancelled Christmas.”
Potter seemed unconcerned. “I’ll just file it under

“Unlikely as it sounds, we are friends.”
“Please tell me you have something good,” Draco said, slapping his clipboard on the counter. He briefly debated slapping his forehead right next to it. “I need something else.”
“Do you know what I think?” She asked in a clipped tone. “I think the two of you got into a fight and then realised it would get you detention. And to think that Minerva was
“Er ...” Harry’s brain didn’t seem to be working anymore, like he couldn’t fathom that somebody like Brankovitch would know anything about him.
There was a shriek and then a lot of bushy hair in Draco’s face as somebody (who could only be Hermione) threw her arms around him and Harry at the same time. Draco nearly had a heart attack, but Harry didn’t seem as surprised. He was already patting her back.
“What about me?” Draco demanded, stopping where their street intersected with another. He wasn’t even sure where they were headed.
“He’ll come … for me,” Draco bluffed, forming the words with massive effort and slurring half the syllables. “I’m dead …? He’ll … kill you.”
“Because I am not that bad?”
Draco understood about a third, if that, and it was probably due in part to the rather casual way Potter told the story. Draco added
It seemed that being in the general vicinity of his Quidditch crush had made him less vigilant. Draco, who had seen him approaching (and refrained from mentioning it to Harry so he couldn’t bolt), returned the greeting while Harry turned around hastily.

Draco wasn’t used to waking up in the drearily furnished on-call room all by himself anymore. Or worse – with Nash snoring in the bunk above him. Or worst: walking in on her and Abrams shagging in there.
“No, Jesus did. And then he came back from the dead and they started a religion, because that’s what Muggles do.”

“Hey,” said Draco, smiling back. He shoved Harry’s bag underneath the chair and then placed his wand on top of it. “How’s the head?”
where his life was headed?
Theo stared out into the lake, which was as murky as ever. “So that leaves you, Potter and Pince?”
Abby cleared her throat and Harry flinched and took a step back. Draco emptied his drink and looked to see what his friends were doing. They were shaking their heads at him. Marc seemed to be mouthing,

“You what?!”
Dumbledore took off his cheap round glasses, broken as they were, and threw them off the tower without hesitation. Something moved behind Draco and he turned around to see the Slytherin banners framing the door turn colour suddenly. The green changed to crimson, but still the snake stayed silver.
It suddenly occurred to him that this was the very first time he was holding a baby. Was it normal to live twenty-six years and never get handed a baby? He supposed it surely wasn’t for the Weasleys.

Draco sighed and assumed the sternest look he could muster, half-naked and lying beside an even more naked Harry.
Harry looked at him with so much affection that Draco could barely stand it.
“McCarthy had a little accident after practice. Seems she crashed her broom on her way home. Mungo’s signed her off for the rest of the month.”

“Hello, Draco.” She gave him a look that hovered somewhere between a smile and a grimace. “So, how do I look?”
Their eyes met suddenly. There was a moment of silence and then Harry shook his head vehemently.

“So we can talk about upcoming matches and my training schedule,” Greyson said resolutely, crossing his arms as well.
This was a stupid, dangerous idea, and even in his haze, Draco knew it.
But when he turned around to grab his wand, he startled Harry, who gasped for air and grabbed Draco’s shoulders like a drowning person. Then a sudden pressure wave whipped everything off their night stands.
during breaks. In the on-call room, more often than not, but also in the shower room on one memorable occasion.
Harry just glared at him in response and then – Draco didn’t know how he did it – directed his hippogriff to swoop out of Draco’s field of vision.
Draco wasn’t going to supply him with one, but he couldn’t help but say, “I’m sure you could come up with a reason.”
“Still, that’s really practical for people like them.” Draco sounded really excited now. “How long does it take?”
“Not myself,” Draco said laboriously. “It’s hard using your magic to the fullest when you’re hurt. If you’re not careful you can end up making it much worse. Just Floo me to Mungo’s.”
Tabitha was seconds away from laughing now. “You sure? I always thought this would be a dream come true for you.”
“Fine!” Harry was almost shouting now. “I fucked up, are you happy? You really should be used to it by now!”

“Yes,” Draco assured him. “The owl arrived while you had your little freak-out. I could drop you off and pick you up afterwards.”

To answer a question that won’t really get addressed otherwise: Yes, that was the Horcrux scar.
Ginny shook her head instantly, probably used to this kind of questions by now. “He’s watching his godson, that’s all.”
“I ordered Chinese, hope that’s okay with you?” Harry asked as soon as he stepped into the kitchen, without even looking up. That man had superhuman hearing.
“Fine,” Harry said drily, “

They both froze, Potter still with his wand outstretched and Draco with his eyes glued to his hands.
“Think those really cheap, really kitsch Veela romance novels.”

Draco slapped Potter’s arm with his wand without a warning. Potter inhaled sharply but was silent aside from that. Draco wordlessly checked him for additional injuries.
Harry smirked at Draco over his shoulder. “Great idea.”
Potter punched his upper arm and actually laughed. “You’re the worst.” A beat of silence, then, much more sombre: “So, I guess it wasn’t for you?”

did you ask me here if you are not going to trust that it is really me?” Draco could do nothing to keep the irritation out of his voice.
Harry looked like he was going to say something, but since it took him forever to even open his mouth, Draco didn’t have any trouble beating him to the punch.
“It’s only illegal if you’re on the extended team. Harry wouldn’t be allowed to bet on their games, of course. Neither would the referee, for obvious reasons. Coaches, board members and team Healers are also banned, but everybody else – suppliers, for example – can participate freely.”
“Yep.”

“Oh,” Draco said, turning towards her now. She was

“Draco! Finally! You’re very much needed. Harry found himself a
He debated going directly to bed but ultimately decided against it. Harry hated when he came to bed reeking of cleaning spells. Draco didn’t like it either, but he wouldn’t have dragged himself to the shower if he’d been sleeping alone without the risk of getting pushed out of bed. Which really wasn’t all that unlikely.
“Naturally,” Draco said, unable to stop the grin that was spreading over his face. That bastard. “

One of the patrolmen (whose name escaped Draco right now, though he had healed the whole DMLE at least a dozen times already) gave him an exhausted look. “Idiot got beaten up by half a Quidditch team.”
Draco kissed back with all he had, with all the want inside him, and only pushed him back when Harry started to grin against his lips.
“Well, it’s not! Come on, I’m sick of pining after you. We are not teenagers anymore; this is getting downright ridiculous.”
Then there was the flash of a camera again and it became clear that a handful of people had opted for Disillusionment Charms instead of getting the hell out of there.
Things started going downhill as soon as Healer Penelope Sanders stepped onto the pitch in her grey scrubs with the Falcon on the front. Fans from both sides jumped to their feet and cheered her on, while the Tornados’ Healer, Arthur Lyster, was already sitting on his bench, completely unheeded by the spectators.
The Welcome Witch gave him a look that was either compassionate or bored. It was kind of hard to tell with her.

Draco looked down at the rolling pin she was still holding in her hands and rather doubted that it was that much of a coincidence. Potter, who was stuck between Draco’s left side and his rose bushes, held onto his arm, probably trying to keep away from the thorns as much as possible. Why did it always have to be his left arm?

“It's going to take as long as it takes.” Blaise held eye contact. “
Draco had even managed to hold eye contact and say, “I hope there are no Nargles in there.”
” Draco repeated. “Already?”
Harry shrugged and straightened his own new sweater (grey with tiny white falcons). “Only one way to find out.”
Now Potter did look up after all, and it was just to grin at him. Draco looked down at his book immediately. Having Potter look at him like

It was working, Draco could tell. Draco was breaking his heart and it was written all across Harry’s face. Harry wasn’t the type to cry – not because of this, not now – but he looked ready to punch a wall.
Draco recognised the receptionist from their last visit, the one who had bailed as soon as she saw them. She was walking with the Prophet’s Quidditch correspondent.
Harry laughed suddenly, startling Draco considerably. “
History.”
“You’re not back together again, are you?” Draco asked incidentally.
Tessa laughed, though it didn’t sound amused. “Did he tell you that? You’re an idiot if you believed that. That’s what they tell you to get into your pants.”
Potter took a deep breath, still looking at him defiantly. “
The action was taking place in the middle of the pitch. Easton Haynes (the Falcons’ broad, muscular Beater) was holding Harry back with one enormous hand on his right shoulder. He was taller than Harry by at least a head, and certainly twice as heavy, but Harry was putting up a fight, clenching his teeth whenever he moved his broken left arm too much.
“McGonagall,” said Draco, trying not to notice the way Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “I’m going to take the Transfiguration apprenticeship.”
“There won’t be an emergency. Let it go, Potter.”
about it. I shouldn’t be here. I should be dead ten times over. But I won’t
Draco sighed and tried the first door, which revealed a sitting room. The fireplace was identical to the one in the dining room, but this room was, all in all, warmer than the one downstairs. The floor was made from dark wood and the abstract paintings had a crimson colour scheme.
“Er …,” Draco said, looking at Harry for help. What did people usually say after watching a movie? What were the criteria? Harry looked back at him expectantly, being no help at all. “It was titled accurately? Those girls were definitely mean.”
” Ron yelled, jumping back and dragging Draco with him, who was holding on like his life depended on it. Ron grabbed both his wrists but didn’t shake him off. “
“We went to school together,” said Draco lightly.
And Draco knew that he didn’t have a choice, that he had to do it, but Merlin, he couldn’t. He couldn’t bring himself to lift his wand, to point it at Harry, to say the words like they didn’t
“He’s not
and all the lamps coming to life at once as Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world, was flung across the room, hit the far wall and instantly went down like a flubberworm. Draco didn’t know what exactly was
“What the –?” Draco leaned forward to get a better look at the hundreds of dots, which were scuttling across the parchment like tiny ants. “This  –”

Draco’s mind was reeling with how bizarre all of it was. He was a wizard. He had gone through a whole war. And somehow,
“Anybody who actually bothered to read the inquiry report knows that Draco did
“Who knows,” replied Draco coldly, “Maybe you’ll be the one in need of healing.”
His shield charm pushed all of them away from the table, pressing them against the walls. Their screams sounded strangely muffled to him, the only one still standing at Harry’s side.
“I don’t know. Do you want to see my wand or something?”
“Then you’ll shake them off at one of your intermediate stops. That’s what they’re for, right?”
Blaise and Ginny exchanged worried looks.
“Did he?”
“See? No bad blood at all.” Potter’s hold on Draco tightened, daring him to break away. Draco did the only logical thing, which was to freeze up.
Potter slowed down, shining his light at different angles. “Haven’t decided yet.”
But now that Harry had said it, it was almost impossible not to search his eyes for a clue – especially while being this close. There was a flicker of an image – Harry face-down in the grass, somebody kneeling down beside him – and Harry turned his head, facing the wall instead of Draco.
Potter turned to face Liam. “So, where the hell did you go?”
“That’s not
Now that we’re all rested after the last chapter, I think we should be ready for this one. 😏

It wasn’t like Draco had
bag broke my foot.”
Draco was already exhausted halfway through his shift. Little sleep (while lying practically on the floor) and an ambush by Mrs. Capitelli would do that to anyone. Then there was that constant back and forth with Potter. One moment they got along brilliantly and the next they were almost ripping each other’s throats out.
“Chocolate Frog?” Potter asked a bit too loudly, and his arm vanished somewhere in the depths of his backpack.
“I’ll give you thirty percent of the profits.”

Felicity stomped outside. Draco went over to Mills, who was the only one ready, and started checking her vitals.
Or maybe they just wanted to convince him to come back. He could imagine how the situation must seem to them.
“Yes,” said Draco pointedly, refusing to look away now.
Draco jabbed an elbow into his side and Harry laughed, pushing him away and then reeling him back in by his hand. “Kidding! Why would
Draco gathered up the device and dropped it into Potter’s sandy lap with a strained, “This
Potter shook his head, a weary expression in his face. “I’m sure he knows what’s up.”
Stupid hormones. Stupid Potter with his stupidly fit body. Being propped up like this really brought out his biceps. Draco hated all of it, but most of all himself and his stupid feelings.
Harry shook his head. “Unbelievable.” He turned back towards the desk and flipped the tin open. “Un-be-fucking-lieveable!” A whole Chocolate Frog vanished into Harry’s mouth. The empty wrapper landed next to Draco’s mug.
“Number …?” mumbled Potter weakly. “Like …?”
Then two others struck at Draco, only just missing him because he had managed to grab Harry’s hand again and was being pulled across the floor with him.
The next song was
Draco drew his wand, making slow, deliberate moves. The first time he had treated Potter, five years and what felt like at least a thousand injuries ago, the stupid git had petrified him for drawing his wand unannounced. Nowadays, Potter barely even flinched, but it was always better not to take chances with him.
Hermione laughed, but there was no humour there. “You could say that. People sent me
As he made his way down, legs shaking and hands braced against the wall of the lift, he wished he were allowed to Apparate in St. Mungo's too. He'd have scraped up the last of his magic to do it.
“You don’t
This sounded to Draco like Blaise had already been invited. By now, Draco was almost sure that there was something going on between the two of them. They were calling each other by their first names, working together day and night, seeing each other at parties and now they were spending Christmas together? And then there was the fact that they had already
“Alright. Bathroom, then.”
at something Draco said. Draco blamed the high for what he did then, which was to lean forward and slap his hand on top of Potter’s before he could swipe the Pepper Imp out of existence.
“Any one of us would have done it!” Draco hissed, all the while entirely aware that none of
. Believe me, I’ve thought about it a lot over the years.”
“To do
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. He knew by now that something was up when Potter messed up his hair. Was it because he had something to hide? Or maybe it had nothing to do with that at all, but rather with his cuddle ambush the day before? Draco reckoned that Potter would be pretty embarrassed about that. One thing was clear, at least: Potter did not want to talk about what was bothering him.
His necklace pulsed. The jinx bounced off and struck the wall.
?” Draco asked pointedly, leading them into the kitchen. “What’s wrong with it?”
“No.”
“Nothing to tell,” said Draco lightly, signing his name under her sick note and then snapping her chart shut again. “I’ll leave some arnica and show your elf how to apply those bandages. Owl me if you feel worse.”
Draco kissed him back, just as softly at first. Then Potter, who must’ve stood on his tiptoes, lost about two feet of height quite suddenly, and Draco, not ready to let him go, chased after him. He ended up leaning forward at a very odd angle, crowding Potter against the wall with just a kiss. (Well, it wasn’t
“Well? Spit it out already. Won’t the Polyjuice wear off?” Draco guessed.
,” he read quietly.
“I'll do it,” Draco volunteered, eager for a chance to get away from this particular awkwardness.
“I want a second opinion.”
This time, Draco’s eyebrows climbed up of their own volition. “Do tell. Did I interrupt the two of you? I really wouldn’t want to intrude.”
. If Potter had noticed him switching to his left side, he didn't mention it.

He made a vague gesture with his free hand that was no clue at all as to what he’d plan to do with the rest of the year if he really went through with this.
Healers never paused before telling you good news.
Ginny grinned some more and picked up the container, holding it so they could both reach it comfortably. “The fun side.”
They reached Draco’s neighbourhood after fifteen minutes. Potter squeezed his arm lightly and then let go, whispering a soft “Thanks.”
“No, you don’t. Nott can do his own homework.”
He was right – the Falcons had burst through the doors. And they were more than complete. All of the starters were there, but so was every single reserve player – even Felicity, who for once didn’t seem to be happy about Harry’s misfortune.
Tessa slapped her menu onto the table. “No way!”
Draco gave her a look that hopefully conveyed that he thought
“I was channelling my inner Harry.”
The Medi-Muggles let go of him and one of them went straight back to the car, having apparently decided that he wouldn’t be a problem any longer.
“So, there was this really important match against the Harpies coming up. They had just gotten Georgina Thompson as their new Seeker, so Matt made McCarthy and me stay after team practice to work on some moves.”
Seeing as it kept Potter silent and actually focused on their work for once, Draco did not complain. Also, he had a ton of Peppermint Toads in his biscuit tin, which were Draco’s favourite.
him (or whatever he was wearing, really).
Harry poked his side and Draco tried to slap his hand away, missing him by a good two seconds.
“Your new favourite song,” Lauren said with absolute confidence. “Just give it a day or two.”
“It was really nice talking to you, Eloise. If you’d excuse us, I need to talk to my … partner. But please do send me a copy of the Russian research paper.”
Potter shrugged, which certainly wasn’t an apology, but at least he tried to justify his snooping with a casual, “You were taking your sweet time, so I had a lie-down. It was right there underneath the pillow.”
It was Greyson’s owl – not Odysseus but the one he usually sent Draco, a small pygmy that blended in quite well in Draco’s Muggle neighbourhood.
of people had scars now. The shape of a scar didn’t matter. Draco resisted the urge to scrub it harder.
There was a sudden, startled yelp and then the clank of instruments hitting the floor.
Now Potter actually growled. “I was going to let you stew for a few minutes! I wouldn’t have locked you out when all of your stuff is still scattered all over my sitting room.”
Break into Cuffe’s house and kidnap his family?”
Draco didn’t even know what they wanted. Only that they had been interested in Harry’s memories, his accidents, the spying. His theories about Felicity McCarthy.
on earth could she possibly know that? He only realised his mistake when Pansy clapped her hands in glee.
Draco stretched his back experimentally, trying for pain, but there was only a little bit of stiffness. He peered down his t-shirt, inspecting the blossoming bruise. “Have been worse. If you’ll excuse me.”
for you?” Harry summoned a box of spaghetti and studied the back.
Draco scribbled back.
Let’s have a party, then!
He just wanted to sleep and wait for somebody to rescue him. Harry would rescue him. Harry was always saving someone –
His enthusiasm didn’t last long. Something was wrong with the Pensieve, which was just

“Er –” Draco had trouble concentrating. “Golden, medium height and brown eyes, I guess? And he's really friendly, ran off as soon as we got here.”
Draco concentrated on his most acceptable memory. Seeing as most of them featured himself completely zoning out and staring at Harry, there weren’t many to choose from.

boyfriend broke up with you yesterday.”
“You know Wood, right?” Captain Leona Robinson fixed Draco with a very serious look as he was checking her vitals one last time before the match against the Caerphilly Catapults.
Blue lights kept flashing and the air smelled horribly burned.
Harry nodded, eyes still fixed on the ceiling. “Well, we lost against the Harpies, and I remember we lost a sponsor because of it, which probably wasn’t that great, but at the time I was just gloating over the fact that McCarthy fucked up so badly.”
“You can use me,” Potter mumbled incoherently.
if I could introduce them. But maybe one of you could extent my invitation to Harry? It’s strange, you know? Whenever I send an owl it seems to get lost.”
He turned back around, but Dumbledore was gone. It was Harry who was kneeling at his feet, and he was wearing the emerald shirt, which was slashed to ribbons and stained with his own blood. And all around him the blood seeped into the joints between the stones, snaking its way outwards.
But if he had to pick a Patronus memory, he’d still go with the sour, barely contained look on Cortez’ face when she had called him up to join her on the podium.
this was supposed to be a date.”
“No, you’re right, Draco dear.” Draco was pretty sure she was only agreeing because she had informants at Linh’s and they were playing right into her cards by going there. “But you should still take him there another time. You could both use a proper meal.”
was what Draco tried to say, but all that came out was just a deep sigh as Harry found some kind of magic spot near Draco’s left clavicle that he had never known about (though it wasn’t hard to guess why that was). Draco didn’t try to say anything else and just leaned his head back to give him more room.
Draco just nodded shortly and then pushed past them before he lost it completely. He knew they were looking after him as he fled.
Schuster hesitated a whole two seconds before saying in a small voice, “I think it’s mashed potatoes and vegetables.”
The worry disappeared from Anastasia’s face at once and was replaced by a peaceful smile. She turned around and strode over to the front desk, and Draco followed at a distance.
Draco wasn’t prepared for this outcome. He had expected to be rejected as soon as McAllister recognised him or not at all.

Draco flipped a page in his notebook and scribbled,
It took several failed attempts until Harry muttered, “That’s just pathetic to look at”, hooked his arms around Draco’s torso and pulled him up gently, the strong scent of earth and grass clearing Draco’s head a little.

Maybe that new guy was Marc’s Adonis? He was definitely hot – Draco just wasn’t sure if he was you’ll-know-it-when-you-see-him hot.

Phaedra Armstrong rolled her eyes, but the rest of the team looked at him expectantly – even Flynn Montgomery, who was the only male player remaining in the locker room.
Pansy laughed. “As if!”
“Consider me checked.”
Somebody switched the light on and both Draco and Harry groaned loudly, shielding their eyes.
“They’ve been trying to see you for a month. You appointed Harry as your healthcare agent, so he gets to decide. They don’t really take
So, you'll be happy to hear that I spent three whole weeks sick on my couch, which I used very productively indeed.
“You did what?” Draco asked incredulously.
Everything was orange and red and yellow and smoke and he could feel it, Merlin, he could feel the heat, it was burning him, eating him alive –

“And they’re cashing that one in now,” Samantha said resolutely.
“Sure,” said Draco, grinning. “Want to lend me your Cloak and do it in
Harry’s mouth was pressed into a very thin line. “What about it?”
“I promise you they won’t,” Draco said, pulling Harry closer by the hand he was still holding. “Just try not to worry too much. You survived.”
Hermione seemed unimpressed. “You mean back when we were much younger and probably not ready for a baby?”
the cup?”
Draco put one hand on his chest, but the scar wasn’t burning anymore. He let his hand drift down and over the side, towards what Draco called his ‘Blaise scar’ and the row of bruises Harry had been pressing down on earlier.
Potter snatched the paper from him and then hugged him spontaneously, almost crushing Draco against his chest. He may have been only five foot five (not that Draco had checked his chart for the information) with the thin build that was typical for Seekers, but he was definitely stronger than he looked.
The Weasleys were hugging each other now, some of them laughing in relief. Mrs. Weasley got to her feet and embraced Meadows, sobbing into his shoulder. He endured this patiently, probably used to it by now. She finally released him to wipe away her tears.
They had reached the shower room now. Robinson was trying to open the door with her elbow. Harry was starting to sound desperate. “
“Thank you for inviting us; the popcorn was excellent.” Draco inclined his head towards Olivia. “Tell Lauren I said hello.”

Disbelief all but shook Draco’s head for him. “You think I was
She turned her head just in time to see Harry raise his eyebrows at her.
Draco didn’t know what he was supposed to take away from that. Did that mean that Potter hadn’t spent the night with Adonis but his books instead? Or maybe – and Draco found that thought oddly revolting – they had spent the night reading
“Make it quick,” a familiar voice whispered from far away. “I’ll get into so much trouble if anybody sees you.”
, very funny,” said Potter, holding the book up so he could see. “This has details on half-arsed Animagus transformation.”
It really was a shame that she fancied women. And that he did not. Though, if his parents were to be believed, that was not really an issue at all. Then again, he would probably go mad if his partner coddled him like that all the time.
Oh shit, oh fuck. Potter was leaning in and Draco’s stomach flipped again.
“Maybe I
I'm fairly excited for the next one! 😊
“I learned that from you!” Harry exclaimed.
Draco sighed. “Have you talked to an Auror about this?”
Harry smoothed Draco’s hair back with both hands, eyes focused on his intently, which felt a little bit like hypnosis with how green they were. “Go to bed. You’ve just been assaulted.” And yes, there was the bitterness Draco had been waiting for, but then Harry gave him a half-hearted smile and continued. “He can go into the garden if he has to and I’ll pick him up after practice.”
know it. Why would he use the same combination twice?”
that startled him so much that he fell off the swing just as he relived the instance this morning at breakfast when he’d stared in Potter’s general direction quite coincidentally and Weasley had elbowed him to let him know. Yeah, Draco definitely had to work on his spatial awareness, or whatever was the matter with him.
“My way?” Draco frowned. Did he have a way? “Do you want to shrink his bladder now?”
Harry scoffed. “That’s exactly what I’m talking about. This injury is over a month old, Draco. You know just as well as I do – because they told me
“Well, they all bloody well should know that you are a good person. You’ve saved so many lives already. I can’t even remember how many times you’ve saved mine.”
“Yeah,” he said slowly. “Can you just make it a little smaller? And not as bad looking.”
“Yeah, well ...”
Then he added another three exclamation marks for emphasis.
“I have the night shift,” Draco lied effortlessly. “I'll see if I can switch it around.”
too?”
“They met in the library,” said Tessa cheerfully. “Marc dropped his book and Adonis picked it up for him. It was a real meet-cute. And then they got drunk at a party and shagged and it all went to shit. So now Marc can’t step foot in the library anymore. He makes me pick up all his books.”
Potter laughed at something (at least he was
“Doesn’t matter, they’re completely different anyway.” Harry waved a hand at him. “Kottabos is an ancient Greek party game. You’ve got some dishes floating in a bowl of water and fling wine at them to make them sink.”

Draco fixed Harry with a stern look. “Get in
One thing was for sure: Draco would not let Potter dictate what he did.
Draco shuffled some of his papers noisily, so Harry wouldn’t get any funny ideas. Like that he was taking this conversation seriously.
“I didn’t expect you to be there. I’ll definitely expect you to be around in the future, though. How does that sound?”
“Are you sure you should be telling me this?” he said thoughtfully, eyes fixed on Harry, who was suddenly nosediving at break-neck speed.
small injuries yourself, or the ones that would kill you straightaway if you didn’t do something.”
“Yeah, you’re right.” They stared at each other for a second, and then Potter added, “Thanks.”
“Full Body-Bind, you moron.”
“Bloody hell.” Harry slumped against the wall and then banged his head against it in defeat. “God, I’m the worst.”
“Just ignore him,” said Draco apologetically, “He is just not made for academics. And also not very good at following instructions.”
“Well, it’s not getting any slower with your hand there.”
” Harry hissed, immediately on high alert.
He opened his eyes just in time to witness Potter bat the box away from his face with both hands, losing his balance in the process and landing hard on his arse with an “Oomph!”
“You and me. I feel like we really could’ve been something, you know?”
Well, if you thought this chapter would resolve yesterday’s tension … sucks to be you? 😇
Draco chuckled at the disappointed tone in his voice. “Well, if it cheers you up, I could remind you that there are actually non-Pure-Blood Slytherins.”
Draco couldn’t see him in this position and Harry kept silent, but Nash leaned over his chest, so Draco suspected that he’d given some kind of consent.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said silently. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just concerned about you.”
Giordano was very respectful about it. Her hands ghosted an inch above his, not actually touching as she examined his wrist and the back of his hand. Draco was sure that she was itching to cast a diagnostic charm as well, but that would have been horribly impolite and she didn’t ask.
, are you Potter?”
Draco let the owl take hold of his outstretched arm, nodded once at the Auror and finally entered Harry’s private wing. He wasn’t keen on opening the letter in front of an Auror. Even if the letter wasn’t cursed, he still expected it to be some kind of hate mail.
“Believe what?” Harry demanded, turning her head around with his own hand, so she was facing the road again.

For a lack of parchment (he didn’t want to use the same one in case it got intercepted), he grabbed one of the many Chocolate Snitch cards scattered on Harry’s side table (Seeker Georgina Thompson of the Holyhead Harpies), scribbled
Both of them froze, which could have been the reason Draco’s voice resembled a block of ice.

Draco was pretty sure that Harry did not even realise he’d given Draco the leading position. No that it meant anything. Draco was in no position to actually lead at all.
The change into the next song, a smooth serenade to some boy or girl called Jude, was quite abrupt, and Potter switched to humming along instead. Maybe he didn’t know the words. Draco himself thought it was a bit boring. Not because Potter wasn’t singing, just because of the rhythm. And the lyrics. Potter’s singing wasn’t a factor. At all.
Also,
“Look who decided to join us,” the doppelganger said, pointing Draco’s own wand at Harry. “So fortunate. Well, for me.”
“That was quite the speech. Potter seems to have a very high opinion of you.”
“Is it a jinx? Did someone curse you recently?” Frey chimed in. Draco thought she looked a little too excited.
Harry leaned over the edge of his treatment table, cradling his hand to his chest. Emerald’s head poked out of Harry’s hair, where she seemed to have fled.
Abrams wasn’t always making sense even on his better days, so Draco wasn’t exactly invested in this conversation. If he could help it, it wouldn’t even
Then his hot mouth was on Draco’s, and he was pushed onto his back. They kissed for a while, but the surface was unyielding underneath him and there already was a crick in his neck, and then he recognised the room as the Transfiguration class room and his thoughts were filled with entirely unwelcome images of McGonagall, which certainly didn’t help matters along.
“Training to get on your house team next term?” Draco guessed as he stepped around the curtain separating him from his next patient.
There was a sigh and then Harry kissed him softly, brushing a hand through his hair. He didn’t say anything in response and Draco almost wished his face were still visible so he could tell how Harry felt about the thought.
“Coming!” he shouted. Draco could only just see him covering his scar with hair before he vanished into the hallway. At least he was trying.
Draco must’ve fallen asleep, because when he opened his eyes next, dusk was already falling and Blaise and Ginny were there. They were standing on either side of Harry, who was on his hands and knees somewhere between the bed and the bathroom.
Draco watched him from where he was sitting. “You don’t have to do it, you know? Samantha can’t make us.”
“First of all: show-off,” said Draco with a roll of his eyes.
“Oh, you’ve already met Draco? I’ve always wanted to introduce you, but Draco is

“Oh, thanks!”

The portrait swung aside and Harry lingered long enough for Draco to climb through before him.
She stretched out her hand. Her fingertips were brushing its wings –
“I don’t think I can take another evening with your Muggle friends so soon. Holding all those questions in was
Ignoring Draco’s very offended look, Pansy loaded his plate with mashed potatoes and some broccoli. “Eat, Draco. You’re going to need it. I have a feeling you’ll be cursing each other sooner or later,

The break would have been the perfect opportunity for Harry to look for the Snitch in peace, but that idea was squashed almost immediately.
Next to the names were headshots of the listed guests and Squibs. Draco recognised Tilghman as the one he had sent over with Potter’s food (because she was the only woman among them), and Fitzgeffrey as one of the Poly-Party Squibs Blaise had pointed out (because he was the only good-looking one). He couldn’t really remember if it had only been the one. His memory was rather fuzzy and mostly overshadowed with what had happened afterwards.
Captain? He’s completely unreliable. Was
Potter looked at him thoughtfully, biting his lip again. Something like resolution showed on his face and then he pushed away from the kitchen island and went into the pantry, only slightly bumping his shoulder against the door. He reappeared with various ingredients, which he arranged in a neat row on the kitchen island.

Oh, Draco would mention it. Draco would
.” Draco made air quotes. “Your fault, by the way.”
Harry shoved Draco back playfully, rolling his eyes almost fondly. “You’ll have to cut me out of this later, I swear. It’s a wonder I even managed to put it on.”
“Well … yeah. It’s the seventh. My three weeks ended yesterday. I’m officially recovered, you can ask Padma.”
He pointed at them and said, “That’s her over there. And the muscular guy next to her is Marc. You know, the one who fell victim to Adonis.”
There were footsteps and Harry and Draco backed away from the door immediately, pressing themselves against the opposite wall.
Potter frowned. “What’s that about Aurors?” He seemed to have already forgotten what Draco had just read to him.
There was a
He was eternally grateful when Olivia bumped Lauren’s shoulder. “He’s miserable enough already, you don’t need to torture him. Poor Draco.”
“Isn’t that what the two of you do?” McAllister shot back at once.
They made their way into the kitchen, which was situated right across the dining room. Going straight was not so much of a problem for Potter, it was only the directions that were tricky. Draco still supported him with an arm around his waist. Potter
Potter looked at him dumbfounded, still stroking Pig absentmindedly. “I’m –” he began, but Draco interrupted him, holding up a hand.

How much time had passed since they had arrived at the house? How long had Draco been out of it?
Draco was confused. Did they not know about their break-up? Potter had definitely hung out with them since then. He had the

. Potter hexed you into next week.” Pansy said it matter-of-factly, like there was no way Draco could have won such a fight. She leaned forward slightly. “Or did you have it out with your fists? Because that would be kind of hot, I’m not going to lie. Not that
“Potter,” Draco muttered pointedly.

“Alright, I’ll see you around.”
me,” said Draco, realising only after he’d said it that this sounded decidedly more like Harry than him.
Merlin, Harry didn’t even know how to pine properly. Draco suddenly wondered how they had ever managed to get together.
“I don’t think I want to see them.”
Ginny hissed something that sounded like “For fuck’s sake!” and then both she and Blaise stepped in front of him swiftly.
“Just get it over with.”
„Yeah. My Muggle friend Lauren graduated with honours despite doing sports almost daily.”
“What is it now?” Draco sighed. “You can’t possibly want this rundown dump to stay like this.”
“Harry ... you know I can’t.”
to have you here, I would rather you be on time.”
Harry gave him a grateful smile and muttered, “After you.”
I really means so much to me to get feedback, and some of you really wrote a lot, so thanks a galleon for that! 😘
Potter snorted and Draco turned to give him a look that said
When Potter faced him again, he seemed oddly calm all of a sudden. “So, it meant nothing to you?” he asked flatly.
Draco loved it too. Draco loved all of it.
and Draco finished his third book of the evening just before it faded out. He floated it into the stack beside his desk and said, “You’re welcome.”
Harry put a gloved hand above his heart. “I promise to try.”
Draco dropped his wand and just managed to catch it before it hit the ground.
“You had
Draco closed the magazine and looked over at Harry, who seemed to be reaching his boiling point, where Draco guessed he’d already been before Draco’s nightmare had interrupted him.
“When we started on you,
“You will never hear me admit to
There was some faint rustling and then something blue and gold dropped onto his book before Draco had finished inspecting the page.
“There was no fight.” Draco placed a fried egg between two slices of toast and added, “And there isn’t
Harry looked close to growling. “I’ve still got two days. Maybe it’ll come back until then.”
bad, right?”
“I won’t explain it completely,” he’d said with that gloomy look he sometimes had, “but she was definitely more. There was something evil inside of her.”
Harry exhaled noisily. “Is it too late to get a divorce?”
” That couldn’t be right. “Who in their right mind would make
When Draco got to St. Mungo’s at the start of his shift, there were reporters outside the door. This was seldom a good sign. He should really start Floo-ing in. Apparating was starting to become a real hassle.
Gryffindor, really – willingly came here?”
Potter had apparently woken up early on Friday morning, despite the sleeping potion, and then declined breakfast. Longbottom and Lovegood had come to visit him and stayed for lunch. After that, Sanders had tried her luck again. Her note contained words like
Grant was almost at the ground now, already stretching out her legs to brace for the touchdown.
There was a body bag.
“Great,” said Harry stroppily. “If it’s worked for one month, it can work for the rest of them too.”
On the upside, Draco made it just in time. On the downside: “Malfoy?”
“But you already gave it to me,” Draco said smugly, trying with all his might to just act
and sighed. “At least there’s tonight to look forward to. Sooky makes the best Canapés.”
No. Draco shook his head and put his wand to his temple. He was overthinking it. This was fine. He was doing this so he wouldn’t forget all about the songs and then have to ask Potter to hear them again. He was doing this to be
Armstrong scoffed. “You’re pushing thirty –”
“It’s pretty accurate,” Draco judged, trying to resist the urge to heal Harry right this instant. “That’s what your Muggle face would look like a month after.”
“It’s not
This was definitely not what Draco had expected. Last time Harry had heard from Chang, she’d made it pretty clear that she never wanted to see him again, because she feared for her safety. And who could blame her?
“Start ... what?”
Slightly less happy now. “Ah,
am not in Azkaban right now is that Auror Jenkins seems to have a soft spot for you. And luck. So, so much luck.”
“Merlin’s pants,” Ginny mumbled, taking the baby from Blaise and handing her to Draco. “Here, hold Rose.”
Curses waited until she sat down on the remaining bed and then produced three identical bubbles that floated over to encase each of them. Next, he summoned three sets of vital vials, which took their places at the heads of their beds.
, because Draco wasn't there, and people didn't die when their loved ones weren't there with them – he refused to accept it could happen.
“Jam tart?” Draco guessed, putting it back on the next tray that came by.
did what he expected him to do.
Draco felt like a complete moron. To be perfectly honest, he had forgotten too. There’d been so much going on, he’d just been relieved he would finally be able to leave St. Mungo’s. He hadn’t thought about the means.

to be anything.”
At first Draco thought he was imagining it, but then Harry squeezed his shoulder and he knew he saw it too. The mist was getting thicker and brighter. But no matter how hard Draco concentrated, it didn’t change further than that.
“Then sell it,” Draco suggested, raising his brow. “You clearly don’t want to keep it, so why hang on to it?”
“I think that’s most likely,” said Pembroke, looking from Draco to Harry. “Everything afterwards fits the mould.”
“Yes.”
“Witch Weekly published something about their relationship this morning. How she broke Potter’s heart and all that stuff. And only an hour later, somebody attempts to murder her. That’s not what coincidence looks like in my book.”
Harry shook his head as he passed them by. “Nothing, like usual. I honestly think he doesn’t know anything.”
If only Draco could make it to the Floo, then he could escape to St. Mungo’s, check on Harry. He never should have left him.
something!” he hissed, slightly panicky.
He himself thought that pining for Harry for months had already been taking it slow.
Firstly: he didn’t think it would be one.
Draco looked at Harry, who rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything.

have taken Harry’s name after all.
“You do that. Tell you what, just catch the Snitch as soon as possible and we can do what you want with the rest of the day. Movies? Food? Lie in bed and sulk all day?”
Well, Draco wasn’t stupid enough to startle him when he was in a mood, so he went back into the bedroom, leaving the door wide open so he could watch Harry kick the crap out of the imaginary bitch, wearing only Draco’s pants. Not a bad view.
Sneaking around hadn’t always been fun, but somehow Draco doubted it would get easier now.
“It wasn’t even that good,” Draco lied through his teeth. “Listen, I like to think we were finally getting to a point where we can tolerate each other, maybe even spend some time as something resembling friends. I’d really like to keep it that way. So, if we could just forget any of that ever happened?”
Potter opened his mouth, but Draco never got to know what he was about to say. There were sudden footsteps and then the clanking of keys at the other end of the room, which seemed to be some kind of storage. Draco extinguished his wand, and then Potter grabbed his shoulder again and Disapparated without so much as a warning.
is absolutely fine. Greyson is toast.”
“Was that another Muggle song?” Draco hummed it again, relishing the way Potter’s shoulders tensed.
Potter smiled softly. “Yeah, I try.”
Draco snorted with laughter. “It’s finally happened. The power’s gone to your head.”
“There you go. Your Snitch.” He grinned, his face illuminated warmly by the flickering light.
Draco looked up at the stands. People seemed indeed far more invested in Harry than the match they had actually paid to watch. Seeker Sophia Grant was desperately trying to evade the hailstorm of Bludgers Robinson and Haynes were shooting at her, and still Harry held their attention.
for all he knows.”
So Draco did too, even if he didn’t really know
Draco tried to answer and found that his voice was gone, but the effort of it made his throat itch horribly and when he coughed, it sounded quite chesty. Just great.
“That's what
The whole table laughed. Draco saw Potter and Blaise exchange a glance.
Harry snatched the parchment out of his hands and read it himself. He was tense and shaking, mouth pressed into a thin line. “I never told anyone.”
Black was creeping into his vision from the edges now, and his eyes slid in and out of focus, which was not helped at all by the countless Snitches darting in every possible direction.
Draco looked down at the robes they had given him. They seemed to be discarded robes of the Holyhead Harpies, dark green and charmed to remove the emblem. He could just make out the faint talon emblazoned on the chest.
you doing here? I thought I sent you to work at Hogwarts.”
“And you’re already sending them Chocolate Snitch cards?” Harry said with a small, dopey grin courtesy of one of his many, many potions. “Must be pretty serious.”
“Well, Zach acted like he’d seen a ghost. Didn’t say anything and just left,” Olivia finished. “I never heard from him again.”
I’ll definitely continue updating daily (with the occasional two chapters a day if they are too short). This fic is completely finished and ready to go, so there will be no hiatuses (unless I get hit by a bus, but that doesn’t seem very likely at the moment).
me so your nosey neighbour will lay off of you?”
Red glanced over his shoulder – not the one on Draco’s side, so he still couldn’t see his face – and then sped up even more, which Draco wouldn’t have thought possible, but there it was.
Why Potter sounded so disappointed, Draco couldn’t fathom. He might be Harry Potter, but that didn’t mean he could just come and go as he pleased. There were boundaries and… and
“I still don’t know what that means.” Harry dropped onto his left side, only half-hovering over him now. His free hand was now in Draco’s hair, playing with the laurel. “Is it illegal to kiss your neck?”
you as much if I forgot the less terrible parts of our history.”
McAllister stood frozen, thrown by the appearance of gold and the absence of a threat. He only reacted when their waitress returned, stuffing his wand back into the pocket.
So, what comes after February 13th? 🤔
Draco shook his head slightly, but it did nothing but intensify his head ache. He felt like crying. He had mastered the Patronus, and now he couldn’t use it? Harry had done it after his accident!
“Where to start,” Harry said grimly. “Mainly because he was broke, I guess. We can’t know everything for sure, because he’s fucking dead,
If Potter wanted to ignore him, Draco sure as fuck wouldn’t be the one to acknowledge him first.
Harry squeezed his leg. “I know. But I talked to Edith and she
Looking at the amount of ashes in front of the door, Draco guessed that there must have been a pretty big pile of letters and at least one Howler, which had set fire to all of it when it had gone up in flames.
“Don’t tell me you
Teddy, Rose and Hugo had sleepovers every Friday. Then there was Saturday Pub Night with the Muggles, Sunday Lunch at the Weasleys, Wednesday Dinner with the Zabinis, the occasional tea with Mrs. Capitelli and her girls and, of course, a fuck-ton of birthdays and holidays.
“Yes, well, and I took it from you seven years ago,” Harry shot back.
“Right?” Teddy said, ignoring Harry and pointing at Draco with a syrupy finger. “And if Ron asks, I have to say that the Cannons are really good too. It’s not true, but I always get a Chocolate Snitch if I lie.”
“That wasn’t a push! That was a full-on force-field.”
know that Poly-Parties are illegal?”
“He’ll just break his rib again!” How many times did Draco have to say it? Freshly healed bones were more fragile than usual.
Draco removed the ear buds and pushed himself up. Potter was lying in the sand also, although he had landed face-first. His arms were cradled around his head, and he was shaking. That probably wasn’t a good sign. If Draco returned him with a broken neck, people would object.
Potter groaned and dropped his head on the backrest of the couch. “How long have I been out of it?”
Draco was

Potter shut him up by grabbing him by his scrubs and kissing him eagerly, but Draco was having none of it. He would say his mind if he damn well pleased!

Draco opened the present, holding it above his face so he wouldn’t have to sit up. There was a soft rustle as silver fabric flowed out onto his chest. He picked it up and let it glide through his fingers, unable to comprehend.
But even the best Seeker could not win a match on his own. The Harpies’ Chasers, Ginny Weasley among them, were scoring goals left, right and centre. It was sheer impossible for the Falcons to keep up.
“Puddlemere United?”
Ella leaned in between them from behind. “
Harry had just gotten to his feet and snapped something at Healer Sanders, when the referee landed next to him and slashed her wand at him in a crisscross motion that left red sparks hanging in front of him.
“No,” Harry took his hand and squeezed. “Don’t worry.”
Now Draco did let go of him and took a step back. “Why not? I did horrible things.” There wasn’t much emotion in his voice, or else he wouldn’t have been able to talk at all.
Draco really had to hand it to Lauren – she had a knack for catching people in the silent moments, the ones during which they felt unobserved. Also, Draco would have to kill Lauren.
“What can I –
Pansy placed a hand on Draco’s lower arm and leaned forward with a grin. “No, the question is: How did you get
“And we’ll get some snacks and drinks, maybe some music, and I think we’ll make a party out of it. We’ll just look at that moment over and over again, and maybe then we’ll let Candace and her girls analyse every single second of it like it’s Celestina Warbeck’s latest hit. How does that sound?”
had taken nearly an hour too.
Draco huffed because, technically, Harry was right. Draco had put a lot of energy into keeping his distance. To be fair: the sheer idea that Harry could be into him had been pretty absurd.
She can’t
“Not true,” said Tessa. “If Draco finally manages to just snog some guy and then decides that it’s not for him, I could easily switch back to needling him about girls instead.”
Draco slung his arms around his neck from behind and Harry relaxed against him immediately. The only indication of Draco having surprised him was the quick look he directed at his wrist watch. He had obviously lost track of time somewhere in between the Odyssey.
Instead he grinned back at her and grabbed both of Draco’s shoulders again to present him to her. “That’s right! This is Draco. It’s his first time.”
If Draco wanted to try his luck defeating that bastard, he would have to do it as soon as possible. He was getting weaker by the minute and there wasn’t much magic left in him.
. Before he finds another waiter to supply him, preferably.”
She skimmed it and then added, “So, what? You failed to restore a book?” She shook the paper. “Pince will know it is missing even with the evidence gone. You wasted your time waiting for Potter to leave.”
“Draco!”
He felt Potter’s gaze on him and looked up. Potter’s eyes were darting between the scroll of parchment in his own lap and Draco, who was sitting opposite him. Draco looked at him questioningly.
Harry grimaced and pushed the clipping back towards McAllister, who said, “This was in the Prophet on December 1
Draco blamed that kiss, really. His first gay kiss, after all, the one that had ended his uncertainty about whether or not he was actually gay (very much, apparently), and also a very hot kiss, as far as Draco could tell. Also, Potter’s body had felt nice, pressed up against him in the dark. It was normal that Draco thought back to that during certain
So sorry if you stayed up waiting for this chapter, the internet was messing with me! 😒
Draco retreated and then flicked the necklace he had just slipped around Harry’s neck unnoticed.
Startling Draco just as much as Cortez, Potter said with total confidence, “I am here to request

There was no use sugar-coating it. Harry would only start imagining even worse scenarios. Draco just said it outright. “Chang’s at Mungo’s. She’s alright now, but somebody attacked her a few hours ago. They got away.”
People generally liked their Harry Potter alive.
Granger was waiting for him in front of Potter’s room, talking to Lancaster quietly. When he approached them, she looked up anxiously.
“There’s nothing more to talk about, Potter.”
“Excuse me?” said Draco, mostly concentrating on finishing his report.
“No wonder you ended it.” She presented him with the bill and then produced her enormous wallet. “Everybody else Harry is friends with is much nicer.”
The only sounds were heavy breathing and scattered whimpering, and one Medi-Muggle who was sobbing to herself. The beeping had died as had all the other background noises.

“Looks good,” said Nash. “So that were steps two to five – numbing, cutting, detaching and healing. I’ll do the aura spell now.”

plan was out of the window now.
“Well, we made it.”
“That’s as much your fault as it is mine,” Draco replied smoothly. “I asked for one scroll, the additional two are on you. Who would have thought you were such an overachiever?”
At the end of the war – maybe a little earlier, maybe even immediately after the
“I could help you make another one.”
Not that they had much more time for anything else.
“Don’t worry, she won’t hurt you,” Potter said, hanging the Invisibility Cloak on his clothes-stand and then rushing into his kitchen uninvited.
Draco stopped walking and had the string wrenched out of his ear once again.
“Yes, but this one comes with a purple ribbon. For

When Draco finally left work at quarter to midnight on Christmas Eve, it was pouring. He produced a shield over his head, which sheltered him from the worst of it, and went down the street towards the spot he usually used to Disapparate. His shoes and socks were soaked after seconds, partly because he overlooked a rather large puddle.
“It’s going to be fine,” Harry said silently. Draco knew that he hated to worry his friends. “How’s Liv?”
Draco smirked down at him and brushed a streak of dirt from his cheek. “Clearly.”
Draco was floating.
“You’ve
“And really?”
After half a minute, he muttered, “I can't think with my eyes closed and you standing next to me.”
“Essence of arnica three times a day. You can get back to flying in a week. I’ll send an owl to Greyson.”
, Malfoy?” Harry was taunting him. There was a smirk on his face that Draco was sure he had learned from him. The smug bastard!
“Maybe
“We’ve got McGonagall first thing tomorrow.”
Potter put on his glamour. The curtains burst open and then he was gone.
“Afraid to be seen with me?” Draco asked, trying not to sound hurt.
He had even looked forward to their spontaneous shopping tours, which mostly happened when Draco’s house was missing a crucial ingredient. Which had been often.
Draco did his best to assume his most self-assured voice. “Because you behaved like someone who belongs in a mental institution.”
” Draco couldn’t hold up his calm facade any longer and threw both hands into the air. His voice certainly wasn’t cool and even anymore. “You risk your neck to teach somebody a lesson because he said something mean about me? That’s not normal behaviour!”

looking witch – single eye, humpback and all – and it opened to reveal a secret passage.
Draco sighed and leaned back against the head board. “Standard quarantine time is twenty-four hours.” He checked the clock on their wall. “So, we’ll be here until three pm tomorrow unless they figure him out before that.”
But somebody must’ve spotted him, because then a figure on the edge of the pitch directed their broom in his direction and touched down next to him a few seconds later.
Title: Parachute - What Breaks My Heart
“Yeah.”
“Yeah,” Potter admitted sheepishly, ruffling his hair.
weird. Yes, Potter had a constant stream of visitors, but when visiting hours were finally over, this part of the hospital was far less busy than the staff room or even the on-call room.
could he be?
There was silence for a few seconds, and Draco didn’t know where to look. Harry was miserable. That wasn’t unexpected, so why did it hit him so hard? Had he really thought breaking up would push Harry in the right direction?
And that was when Harry turned his broom sideways very suddenly, making a grab for the Snitch while simultaneously blocking his opponent with his body, who collided with him at full speed. They crashed into the stands with a deafening bang that left the whole structure shaking.
“I’m just saying, why did he have to publish that
Potter frowned up at him and Draco suddenly realised that he had used her last name.
It was half past three in the morning on Draco’s birthday, which meant he was only four and a half hours into his night shift.
“See? Then there’s nothing to worry about in the first place. You’ll be fine. Just take the opportunity to get a full night’s sleep for once. Or catch up on some of your course work. Merlin knows there’s not enough time to stay on top of it.”
“So, we were flying laps and Matt left for a moment to get some of those training Bludgers. And well …” Harry sighed again. “McCarthy said something mean and I said something mean back and things derailed a bit from there and suddenly she just barged into me and next thing I knew I was at Mungo’s with a severe concussion. She claimed she lost control over her broom.”
Harry stepped in front of it, blocking his path. “
He also didn’t mention that Harry was a highly unusual subject, due to the aforementioned dying, and that Draco needed to make sure that normal people reacted the same way he did.
? You’re in no position to threaten me.”
Harry took Draco’s hand and held it tightly. They stood like that for a few seconds, caught between hope and sorrow. Then Harry smiled softly, squared his shoulders and said, “Alright, tell me who to rave to about you next.”
“WHAT?!”

“Is it because adults aren’t supposed to watch children’s movies?” Draco asked as soon as the door closed behind them.
It wasn’t that Draco suddenly
But there was nothing else, because sleep had finally overtaken him.
” Draco yelled, but too late – Potter had already thrown one arm up, his open palm facing Draco.
Harry made a frustrated noise and let go of him with a slight shove. Draco, who thought he could be a little dramatic about it, leaned into it. Problem was: Mrs. Capitelli’s hedge wasn’t as sturdy as he had thought.

“To prevent you from turning into a reclusive prune!” Blaise said dramatically and then he was pulling Draco out of the ally and into the pub.

“What did you
Draco snorted. “Nobody in their right mind would ever try to make
“So, what are your plans for Christmas?” Potter asked, helping himself to some sausages.
“You’re so far gone, it’s almost pathetic.” Harry closed his eyes again.
? Yes, Draco would go with that.

“Are you
“You’re rambling, Malfoy. Just tell me.”
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked innocently.
“That’s an understatement,” said Harry under his breath as Kassandra took flight.
He kept his eyes fixed on a scorch mark on the curtain (probably one of his own) and wouldn’t meet Draco’s.
Draco ignored the question in favour of pulling the Snitch out of his shirt. Inscribed on the surface were the words
Draco reached for Potter’s face and then thought better of it at the last second. He prodded the bandages instead to see what they were made of. They were quite solid.
“Malfoy, I promise you she's not dangerous,” he said, clearing the table with his wand and then placing the snake on it carefully. “Trust me on this, alright?”
“Alright,” said Draco. “Now that everything is taken care of, I will go and find you a Healer. Okay?”
Pansy laughed loudly. “Oh,
He grabbed Draco’s wrist as soon as he was in reach and directed him to the chair directly across from him, which meant that he could watch Harry’s back.
Draco told him everything about the briefcase full of gossip, without going into detail about the information that hadn’t yet been published. He made sure to include the fact that most of the notes had fixed publish dates, even if Draco couldn’t remember them clearly anymore.
It was still another hour until the match, and not many people were there yet. They made their way over to the changing rooms.
“Yeah.”
Harry didn’t get up – maybe he thought the man (his uncle?) couldn’t bend that far down, making this position safer. He lifted his chin up instead, refusing to look afraid, but Draco could see the way he braced himself against the floor with clenched fists.
They were nearing the exit now, and every now and then, people would look after them as they passed, and Draco knew that they knew. Doubt seized hold of Draco’s insides, and for a second, he was about to pull his hand out of Harry’s grip.
“Stop using Legilimency on me!”
“Alright…?” Was Draco supposed to know what that meant?
Potter just glared at him, clothes held loosely in his hands. He sounded almost hurt when he said, “Quit your bullshit, Malfoy.”
“That’s another three weeks. No flying whatsoever, no heavy lifting, no
Harry scoffed. “You won’t be alone. Blaise will be there, right? Besides, they’re
At least the fireplace was burning brightly, creating an otherwise cosy atmosphere (if you could look past the battalion of Aurors, who were – unlike them – fully clothed).
Draco decided to just ignore it in the hopes that Odysseus would get bored and scatter. He placed Emerald in his front pocket and said, “So, what does he want

and ignored that it was highly entertaining.
of us did.”
Draco’s eyes flew open. He was still sitting in his chair, upper body bent over. His head was resting on Potter’s legs. He let go of the hand he was still holding and sat up groaning, much to the protest of his back.
“I don’t have a name,” Cuffe stammered. “He always wears a mask!”
“Right,” muttered Potter, tucking at one of his damp curls. “So, as I said, I’m bad with faces. And there was this guy Jason in Ancient History and I
“Draco got McAllister to investigate the spying. I keep the articles in my study. And I gave Draco my memory yesterday. I think he’s got it at home. And there’s probably something in my Pensieve, I just didn’t know what I was looking for until now.”
Also, I love how you wonder where they’re going to live now. Pretty sure about the

“I’ll even let you buy the
Draco’s head whipped up so fast that something inside his neck caught. Swearing under his breath, he slapped both hands against the back of his head as cold trickled down and numbness set in. By the time his vision finally cleared enough for him to focus on the Gryffindor table, Potter was staring holes into his cereal bowl and Blaise was geared up for round two.
“Yeah,” muttered Marc. “I get it.”
scars, but I wouldn’t be caught dead in red.”
the bathrooms.”
“Then why did you come here after all?”
Potter looked up suddenly, wand still raised to tap at the table again, mouth opened just so. Well, at least he was silent now.
Of course Draco knew that Harry had survived this. This had happened almost two months ago. But he still felt sick.
Draco pointed his wand at the Snitch until it turned hot against his skin, the surface reading,
Fine, he hadn’t been sure about doing it with Harry this night, but that had only been because he hadn’t really thought about it before. Now that they were here, though … there wasn’t really anything to lose, was there? Also, it definitely was about time.
Draco smirked. “Well, at least you look pretty.”
Draco doubted that Harry knew how badly he had fucked up, or he wouldn’t have managed to take the steps necessary to round the kitchen island so he could come to stand in front of Marc.
Her explanation had been as bizarre as he would have expected of her: She believed there was a sub-species of doxies whose bite would give any witch under the age of ninety-nine the ability to fly, provided it was the full moon.
“I’m just not as
They couldn’t Apparate from here. He couldn’t hide Harry under the Cloak, not with all those Muggles present. He couldn’t change Harry’s appearance either, not after all those Muggles had clearly noticed him. Besides, he didn’t know if it would even work while Harry was wearing the glamour.
about the fact that you didn’t go to Azkaban when she had to leave the country. Also, it certainly didn’t help that you’ve gotten so popular since you’re with the Falcons and she’s … not. Then the thing with Harry publicly speaking out for you … So she stabbed you.”
“Merlin help me,” muttered Draco, and then he rolled on top of Harry in one swift motion and went right back to kissing him.
Three heads turned to stare at him.
“But it didn’t stick! And remember how much more they loved you afterwards?” Draco floated the warmed mouse over to the counter top where Emerald lounged.
“What do you mean
Draco hoped the party would clear things up for him.
“Malfoy! A word?”
“They’re going to cut him up?!” He could feel the static of his magic travel down his arm and into the wand he was still gripping tightly. “Are you mental?”
The Welcome Witch was the first to notice Draco. She scribbled something on her notepad and then looked up at him, arms crossed in front of her chest.
Like that, they healed each other simultaneously. Then they put very crude glamouring charms upon each other, just enough to mask the bruises the ropes had left behind.
“Cuffe said the informant was male.”
Brawling with Potter also ensured Draco an endless supply of death glares from all four houses as well as most of the ghosts and (unsurprisingly but also most frighteningly) Hagrid.
