A knock on the door broke the mood of the room. “Are you ready for them to see the real Harry Potter, brat?”
Draco physically stumbled back a step. His stomach dropping through the floor of the Dark Lord’s study. He was in so much more shit than he originally anticipated.
Hadrian stood in front of his honorary godfather and began the Marking. “Do you, Remus John Lupin, swear to protect, serve and obey me to the best of your ability?” he asked, eyes intent on the newest of his wolves.
Hadrian and Tom throw their name and money around and Dumbledore catches wind of the new players in town.
“Albus Dumbledore does,” Hadrian said with an edge to his voice, staring intently at the woman in front of him as he watched her work her way through the information. She knew the old man’s reputation for keeping secrets he thought no one else was worthy of knowing and had made it her life’s mission to discover as many of those secrets as she could. That is exactly why Hadrian had chosen her, of all the sneaky reporters Wizarding Britain had to offer, to be his official reporter on all things Harry Potter and Dumbledore.
“Third year was a clusterfuck completely the fault of Peter fucking Pettigrew.” Peverell snarled and Severus had to agree with him on that one. The little rat was possibly the most hated man in all of magical Britain for all the trouble he’d caused. “Can I have him by the way?” Peverell asked, turning to the Dark Lord with a questioning look.
Severus snorted at this, still apparently under the impression that Harry Potter was a spoilt, arrogant child who was loved and cared for in his home. Despite all that he’d already found out about Dumbledore’s deceit. An angry glare was sent his way from both Tom and, surprisingly to Severus, Barty as Hadrian said a quiet, “watch my life, Severus.”
going to love this. I’ve been waiting for the right time to tell you and now seems perfect because you will be in charge of making sure everyone still laughs, despite the hard times coming to the wizarding world. I give you a trunk of plans written by the Marauder’s themselves,
Barty looked on in awe as his young Lord ripped into Malfoy. He loved watching his Lord work. The kid could talk his way out of or into anything and leave whoever his poor victim was thinking it was their own idea. It was fascinating to watch and he could barely contain his excitement as Malfoy, the idiot, pushed and pushed his Lord until he finally snapped.
“I always knew he was a filthy Slytherin whore,” Weasley spat out and Hadrian stiffened almost imperceptibly beside Draco. “He never could act completely Gryffindor, the stupid hat should have just put him where he belonged, with the other wannabe Death Eaters.”
Draco didn’t know whether he should be happy he guessed the identity of this new Lord correctly or not. Draco loved being right, he really did. But the idea that he was crushing
The room quieted, finally, and Dumbledore swept his twinkly-eyed gaze over the congregation before him. Sirius made sure to reinforce his Occlumency shields as he met the old man’s eyes and he was sure both Remus and Snape were doing something similar next to him.
this morning, I’m sure,” Dumbledore said. Sirius had spent a long time observing the man without the hero-worship fog obscuring him, and even he was hard pressed to notice the slight tension in Dumbledore’s jaw as he spoke. The old man was as good an actor as they come. Though Sirius was convinced his son was equally good, if not better, if even half the things he expected that boy got up to were true. “And it seems we have a problem on our hands,” the old man continued.
Something Draco was completely sure of, however, was that, no matter how outrageously obsessive his own actions towards Harry Potter were, the green-eyed boy had been just as obsessed with Draco as Draco was with him. Though maybe not for the same reasons. Their eyes had been meeting across the length of the Great Hall for six years now and Harry had most definitely spent the better part of last year stalking Draco under his damn invisibility cloak.
Severus bowed his head in subservience as Lord Thanatos’ magic gained a harsh edge. These may have been the strangest orders ever, and Severus could only guess at the reason for them when he knew the Vampire’s claimed donor would be present also, but Severus knew he would be dead if he failed.
long time,” Hadrian said. Using all of his strength to stay off her while he waited for an answer. Luna had most likely known about this for weeks, he knew, but there was no way he was taking away her choice. He would rather waste away than do something to hurt his Luna.
Severus sat, staring wide-eyed at the Dark Lord as he realised his mistake. His loyalty had always been with the Dark until Dumbledore used Lily’s death against him. She had always been his weakness and the old man had used her to manipulate him for the past fifteen years. To know his Lord had honoured his promise and tried to spare Lily’s life shocked him to his core. Severus had to alter his world view to fit this revelation. And not for the last time that night.
They watched as McGonagall told Dumbledore that these were the worst kind of muggles she’d ever seen. As Dumbledore dismissed her comments with meaningless words about family and love and not letting fame get to the boy’s head. And as a sobbing Hagrid placed baby Harry on the doorstep with nothing but a blanket and a letter.
Tom was amused. Something that seemed to be happening a lot more now Hadrian Peverell was a constant in his life. The boy was young and exciting and just a breath of fresh air after all the stuffy pureblood traditionalists Tom had spent most of his life around.
Hadrian knew Draco would be the first to break the no talking rule and tried his best to keep the fond look off his face as his mate spoke. “You’d be surprised what the Ministry is capable of when left to their own devices Draco, they really are quite stupid not to think of the consequences of insulting the House of Black.” Hadrian’s smirk grew as he watched Draco suppress a shiver at the promise in the young Lord’s voice.
A light blush coloured Hadrian’s cheeks and Tom looked at him with clear amusement on his face. Before this was all over, Tom would make sure Hadrian was able to own up to his brilliance without the need to feel embarrassed and flattered. He was brilliant, of course he was. He was Tom’s horcrux. His equal.
“You should be thankful my Little Moon decided to drop by Avery.” Her Lord’s voice rang out through the large room and a lone figure standing before the mass of cloaks behind him sank to his knees. Avery, then. “She has likely saved your life. You know I am not one for mercy when people are stupid enough to question me.”
“My - my Lord, I do not think it wise -,” Avery started looking only at the crimson eyed Lord beside her, before Luna took things into her own hands. This piece of filth had said something to anger her Lord and now had the nerve to undermine his authority. He was the most powerful being in this world and deserved their undying respect. Avery would not walk out of this room without knowing so, if Luna had anything to say about it.
“Might make you less inclined to curse me,” he said with a chuckle as he ducked the jet of red light that escaped Tom’s wand at that comment.
Sirius stiffened as Remus’ hand brushed over the mark on his left shoulder. His eyes flew open, hand immediately grasping for the little slip of parchment in his pocket.
“Yes, well, I had a wonderful time conversing with your diary my dear and, even though I had to deal with the major temper tantrum at the end of the year, I have to say it’s one of the most engaging conversations I’ve had with you.”
“So,” Hadrian continued, “when Hagrid picked me up and started spouting nonsense about all the fantastical bullshit the
“He has been cleared of all the potions and spells manipulating his personality and, there is also the fact that his mind is, and will continue to be, completely impenetrable to anyone but me.” Lucius was shocked at this statement. How could someone so young have such a strong mind, especially with what Severus said about the boy’s Occlumency training in his fifth year? “He will never betray the Dark, Lucius. The cause is much too close to his heart for that to happen.”
Barty remembered when Hadrian first approached him about his ‘get revenge on Dumbledore’ plan, the look of pure determination that shon out of Hadrian’s eyes had him captivated from the beginning. Hadrian was more determined than Barty had ever seen the Dark Lord and he had a sort of natural charisma that, even before his Creature Inheritance, rivalled that of a young Tom Riddle.
Severus was on high alert the moment he entered the Dark Lord’s office. There was a new player in the game and, as Slytherin as Severus was, he needed to know more about this man before he could ever think about serving him.
“THIS MORNING!” Severus shot out of his chair, finally breaking out of his dazed state and rushing to kneel in front of Hadrian. He pulled out his wand and frantically cast diagnostic spells at the young man sitting in front of him. Oblivious to the amused glint in the Dark Lord’s eyes and the fond exasperation that shon out of Hadrian’s.
Tom was quietly shocked that Hadrian did not bind his followers for life. He was sure that, if they ever chose to leave, they would be leaving with no memory of Lord Thanatos or any of his associates, but having the option open was something new to the Dark Lord. He wondered how many of his Death Eaters would have left him before the end of the last war if he had allowed them anything but eternal service to his cause.
The boy had gone above and beyond, like he seemed to do with everything, and not just sworn allegiance to the Dark but became a Dark Lord in his own right. Or maybe, Severus considered, a Grey Lord or something more like that. He didn’t think Hadrian, no matter how Dark he got, could ever be as Dark as the Dark Lord himself.
Hadrian nodded once. “Good.” He indicated for the Weasley brothers to stand and steered them in Lucius’ direction. “We wouldn’t want to make a habit of that now would we, Lucius?” Lucius replied in the negative again then formally greeted Bill and Charlie. “You will all be civil for the next month, won’t you?” Hadrian asked as he escorted the trio to the door and smiled sweetly at the hasty conformations he received as they left. Oh to be a fly on the wall at the Malfoy house for dinner tonight. Hadrian imagined it would be a very tense affair.
I am so very sorry this took so long! This chapter fought me from the very beginning and I was going to just post it then forget it ever existed but I figured I needed to make it as good as I could for you all. So, I stepped back for a little bit then FINALLY got it done to an acceptable standard and I hope that you all enjoy a little more drama.
“I’m sure you all noticed I am a Vampire,” Hadrian said to the room. Barty was listening closely again, not having heard anything about his Lord’s creature inheritance yet. “I’m more than just your average Vampire though, I’m what they call a Living Vampire.”
“Frederick Gideon Weasley and George Fabian Weasley, Gred and Forge, my partners in all things prank,” Harry smiled, and Draco watched the twins as they stared at Harry’s image with reverence written all over their faces. It was commonly known throughout Hogwarts that Harry and the twins had grown exponentially closer since Harry’s fourth year. The twin terrors and the Chosen One had made a formidable team going up against the likes of Umbridge and Filch. Draco was reminded once again how much respect and love these two seemed to have for their Lord, “You both will be established as Friend of House Potter in the same way as your brothers. I give you a thousand Galleons towards WWW and the lease to a shop in Hogsmeade so you can expand your business closer to Hogwarts.”
Draco was shocked. He knew a little about the history between Lily Potter and his godfather, enough to know their relationship before Lady Potter died was strained at best. Draco could only imagine what Severus was feeling right now and Draco’s gratitude for Hadrian increased. Anyone who could give his godfather something to lighten up his dark, dreary life was owed a great deal in Draco’s eyes.
He sneaked a look at Draco and sighed at the mortified look on the Malfoy heir’s face. Likely he could not believe his Father would lack even a modicum of tact or decorum in any situation. Especially in present company.
Sirius walked into the large, stone room deep within Gringotts for Harry Potter-Black’s will reading. It had been two days since he’d stood, his soul aching, outside the smouldering remains of Number 4 Privet Drive watching his son’s body being taken away by the Aurors. It had also been two days since he realised he still had hope.
“If Harry wanted them here he must have had a reason Ron,” he said, hoping the anger washing through him would be mistaken for grief. Sirius knew how little love Harry had for the youngest Weasleys and was waiting in anticipation for the incoming reveal. “Today’s about Harry, nothing else! Now shut up so I can hear my godson’s last words to me.”
The image of Sirius Black erupted from the wand, lifted Harry from his cot and out of the house containing his dead parents. Dumbledore and Hagrid were waiting for them and Hadrian’s audience gasped as the esteemed Headmaster cast a full body bind at the young Black heir. Draco and Lucius wore identical faces of disgust as Dumbledore ordered Hagrid to take baby Harry from Sirius and head to Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. As the half-giant walked towards a large black motorcycle, a quiet ‘
Harry paused for a moment and looked around the room. Hadrian had felt very dramatic while recording this and thanked Merlin Tom wasn’t here to see his display. He would be too proud and Hadrian would never hear the end of it.
Draco locked eyes with the object of his thoughts as he took a sip of his perfectly brewed Earl Grey tea. The slight twitching of the vampire’s lips made Draco’s stomach do flips and he knew that his obsession with Harry Potter would undoubtedly follow onto Hadrian Peverell. It seemed, to everyone else in the room at least, that Hadrian Peverell’s obsession with Draco Malfoy would continue in full force, as emerald green eyes stayed locked on the blonde even after he dropped his focus back onto his breakfast.
“Ah, yes. That was partly due to the early inheritance, but also because I’m a full blooded metamorphmagus and I took off my glamour.”
Hadrian narrowed his eyes. He knew exactly who Lucius Malfoy was, knew more than Lucius probably realised, and he was not particularly impressed. Lucius seemed to be forgetting exactly who
‘His body was in the worst condition I have seen outside a torture victim,’ one healer said after examining Mr Potter. ‘It is likely the young Mr Potter was, in fact, a victim of long-term abuse.’ I was shocked at this assertion as you can well imagine and vowed to find out more. Hasn’t Albus Dumbledore consistently told us our Saviour has been treated like a prince for all that he has done for this world? Did Albus Dumbledore know about the treatment Harry Potter was facing every summer he returned from Hogwarts? I don’t know my dear readers, but I endeavour to find out.
Severus was waiting in the Peverell Manor sitting room, surrounded by students he had never even pretended to like, his Lord and two of the least annoying Death Eaters.
Anyway, hope you enjoy this next chapter. I was a hard one to churn out and I hope all the PoV jumping isn't too confusing. Things will start to pick up after all the explanations are done
Draco didn’t bother covering up his snort this time at the look of pure shock on the Weasley’s faces. Like someone of Hadrian’s status would ever need to prove himself to people such as this. “You are too kind, Lord Peverell,” he said before he could think. His disdain for the Weasley family was well known, but this probably wasn’t the correct environment to be antagonising anyone. Hadrian had goals Draco didn’t want to disrupt.
It seems to me, dear readers, that a great many things are going to be changing in Wizarding Britain in the future. Will we benefit from these changes or not, we can only guess.
The smirk shared between them was positively wicked and Hadrian thought he saw the oldest Weasleys shiver at the sight. Good. They should be wary of his intentions. Especially if they were going to be making eyes at
Lucius looked shocked and Severus hoped he wasn’t going to say something stupid again. “Sirius Black is a blood relative of yours?” Draco looked intrigued as well but Severus noted that everyone else in the room seemed to know what this meant. He hated being in the dark like this.
Barty released his protective hold on Luna when she moved to approach Hadrian again and watched the young Malfoy’s face as she sat on Hadrian’s lap. They fit perfectly together and young Draco seemed to think so too. The jealousy clearly written across his face. Barty hoped Hadrian gave up trying to respect the blonde’s boundaries soon because he really didn’t want to watch the boy spew hormones everywhere for the next two months. For his Lord’s sake as well as everyone who had to watch them.
He knew logically, of course, that Lord Thanatos could probably strike him dead in half a second but with his magic feeling like it did right now, Severus could not even begin to be afraid.
Wide silver eyes looked back at Tom and he had to feel a little bad for the poor pompous git. He was being shown up by a sixteen year old and that had to be hard on
“When I got the potions and blocks purged from my system, my magic forced me into an early inheritance. I will live until Magic says I will live no more and I have a donor and a mate, who’s blood I will need to survive and who’s lives will be extended to match mine. When I find them and they accept me, that is.” Hadrian flashed a fanged smile at the room. “I have elemental magic and natural Occlumency abilities and I’m just generally stronger and faster than your average wizard.”
Lucius was very confused. Very, very confused and getting more so every second he was in this room. Did Severus just say ‘Potter’? As in
be his son. He had received a note from Harry two days ago with the words ‘I am fine’ scrawled in his signature messy handwriting and he hoped Dumbledore hadn’t gone and done something stupid that endangered his pup.
The whole Weasley family was present (though Percy sat as far away from his family as he possibly could) and they, as well as Dumbledore, Hermione, Sirius and Remus were sat on the left of the table looking intently at Director Ragnok. That was until Ronald Weasley, ever the hot-headed fool, noticed the two Slytherins sat next to Hadrian. “What the hell are those slimy gits doing here?” he shouted, pointing an accusing finger across the table.
He moved his face so close to Charlie’s their noses brushed, then leaned in to snarl in the redhead’s ear. “You may be a Dragon handler Charlie Weasley, but you so much as
Hadrian seemed to be thinking as his eyes travelled over the room. Draco saw as Hadrian’s shoulders stiffened when he came upon the younger Weasley and braced himself for something, anything to happen. He wasn’t sure of what exactly, but he knew there was
“What map?” Draco asked and Severus was glad he wasn’t the only one who picked up on that and wanted to know more. He didn’t want to seem curious after all.
I make myself laugh sometimes while writing this and it's 90% Severus' fault. Also, don't worry, Lucius will get over himself eventually.
Severus didn’t know how Peverell could look at the prison of his youth with such detached emotion as he was. There was nothing on the young Lord’s face to hint at how he felt about the tiny space in which he had been locked away for eleven years.
Peverell, who had been in a deep discussion with Barty Crouch Jr., of all people, while he wasn’t not-so-secretly draining the blood out of Lovegood, turned from the younger Death Eater and raised a hand to quell Crouch’s snarl in Lucius’ direction. “Yes, Lucy dear, what can I explain for you?”
Everyone was present finally and settling down around the table. On the right of Ragnok sat Hadrian, then Draco and Severus, followed by Luna, Neville, Tonks and Andromeda, then finally Percy Weasley. The last two looked thoroughly confused as to why they had been mentioned in Harry Potter’s will and Sirius had to bite back a chuckle. He imagined this was going to be a
Tom observed the werewolf and Black as Hadrian explained to them his life story, his plans and the circumstances around ‘Harry Potter’s’ death. It was in a similar manner to his explanation to Severus, Draco and Lucius just a few days ago, but he seemed to have played down the pain of his childhood a little. It seemed Hadrian didn’t want his Father feeling more guilt than he already did for abandoning him for something so petty as revenge. Oh, who was he kidding? Tom would have done exactly the same thing. Though he liked to think he would have succeeded in killing the stupid rat before being sent to Azkaban.
Lucius sat back stiffly on the couch and glared at the young Vampire, shrinking back slightly when a growl rippled through the air. Severus did not fail to notice the slight blush that appeared on Draco’s cheeks at the show of dominance the Vampire displayed and knew there was already nothing he could do to stop his godson from eventually bonding with, possibly, the most powerful creature in the world. At least he couldn’t aim any higher.
Luna watched gleefully as the whimpering and shaking form of Alexander Avery sank lower to the ground, head almost touching the black marble tiles. He must have said something about a Wolf for her Lord to be reacting in this way, she hoped her Lord would still punish him, despite her interruption.
“We will be surrounded by enemies, Severus,” Lord Thanatos said. “You are the only one I currently trust to keep Draco safe at all costs. If things go south today you take him and you get out of there
Those green eyes, so very like his mothers, snapped to him and bored straight into his soul. Severus’ companions gasped, incredulous looks on their faces. A small upward quirk of the young Lord’s mouth confirmed Severus’ suspicions and he lost all semblance of control, completely forgetting where he was and who was in his presence.
Skeeter was nodding her head absentmindedly and Hadrian could see her forming stories in her head already. It was good. She was enthusiastic and hadn’t even got her hands on the ‘good stuff’ yet. The longer he spent on this conversation, the longer Hadrian was willing to ignore the not-so-wonderful aspects of Rita Skeeter’s personality and establish a prosperous working relationship.
“I’m not sure what was in that letter.” Hadrian said as he paused the memory yet again. “I have my suspicions, of course. Something along the lines of ‘tell the boy nothing of his parents and make sure he is weak and malleable by the time his Hogwarts letter comes.’ But Petunia and Vernon Dursley were, of course, horrified that the
“Ah, Fred, George, I’m very glad you could make it.” Hadrian said, his velvet voice made Draco shiver. What he wouldn’t give to have that voice directed at him.
A pained whine escaped Sirius as the man clutched onto the arm of the werewolf next to him. He had forgotten how small Harry was. Looking at Hadrian across the table he hoped his current strength wasn’t just a glamour. If Hadrian didn’t have them already, Sirius was making a trip to Harry’s relatives in the near future.
“You’ve been a hidden snake all along?” Draco asked, wondering just how Slytherin the young man in front of him really was. Hadrian kept getting better and better in Draco’s eyes and he was astoundingly perturbed at the thought Hadrian had a mate somewhere out there, waiting for him to share his life with them.
Lucius was left in the Dark Lord’s office with his son and his Lord. His mind was reeling from all the new information he had received this meeting. And, he was concerned about Hadrian Peverell’s ability to deceive people. He knew his Lord was an accomplished Legilimens and was the most Slytherin Slytherin of them all, but there was still the possibility that Hadrian Peverell was just one of Dumbledore’s minions.
There were many things the boy could know that would make Albus seem like a truly despicable person out of context. He doubted the
“There’s not much to know Mr. Peverell. Albus Dumbledore has always been very secretive about the boy’s home, wouldn’t let any of us find him before he went to Hogwarts. Dumbledore has told everyone that he’s with his last living relatives and that he gets treated in a manner fitting of the ‘saviour’ he is.”
“If we stay on their side, my friend,” Severus replied, grabbing hold of the Malfoy Lord’s elbow so as not to lose each other in the commotion of a burning building, “we might just come out for the better.”
Tom’s eyes were alight with pleasure at the thought of Dumbledore suddenly being dethroned, not because of skilful manipulation of the Dark sect but because the old coot pissed off the wrong teenager. The thought of watching Hadrian cut into the headmaster for the next year was causing Tom to worry about his ability to hold a mask of indifference in place in front of his Death Eaters. It really was going to be a good year.
Taking the opportunity to retire, Hadrian stood up. Barty stood with him, surprising everyone but the Tom with his action. “Barty and I better go write those letters Tom, I’ll see you all for breakfast in the morning,” Hadrian said, making eye contact with Draco as he added, “sleep well.”
“I managed to make a cheap replica of the stone, steal the real one and get a vow of non-combatants from old grumpy-face here all before Christmas. The test at the end of the year was all for show and I’m honestly still baffled that the man was so completely fooled by an eleven year old and a clinically insane wraith. He really is getting old.”
A growl rippled through her Lord’s chest and his verdant gaze locked back onto the prostrated form on the tiles below. “Why don’t you tell her, Avery, exactly what it was you said to me.” The disdain in his voice clear for the room to hear. It wasn’t often her Lord allowed so much emotion to bleed through his masks in a public setting. Avery must have been very stupid indeed.
Lord Thanatos’ magic was magnificent. Stroking up against Severus’ own in an almost loving way. Letting him know that he was safe with this Lord and the wonderful magic surrounding him.
Sirius transformed into Padfoot the moment his feet touched the ground. He looked around at the chaos that stood before him. Aurors and Obliviators were herding the Muggles back into their houses, away from the smouldering remains of Number 4 Privet Drive.
Draco, not for the first time, wondered at what Hadrian saw in the Longbottom heir. He understood that he had probably never seen the real Longbottom, but there had never been anything to indicate that he could be capable of being Lord Thanatos’ right hand. Draco vowed to talk with the boy sometime this summer, he must have some redeemable attributes if someone as powerful as Hadrian held him in such high regard.
Severus noticed the young Vampire’s eyes flick to Draco yet again and a sense of dread worked its way into his stomach. He had a feeling Peverell knew exactly who his mate was and was going to be especially irritable until that bond was claimed. Lucius was sure to be on the receiving end of a lot of Vampire ire when Draco was around if he continued to deny Peverell’s authority.
Albus Dumbledore was always the last person to arrive at Order meetings and Sirius was sure it was a ploy to make himself feel more important. A meeting of twenty two witches and wizards couldn’t start without the
about him. He noticed Draco’s look of horror mixed with wonder directed at the young Vampire and vowed to stop his son doing something infinitely stupid, like become attached to the young man.
“I’ve become rather good a glamour spells and have been receiving healing potions from my dear Uncle here since the summer of ‘93,” Hadrian gestured to Tom and Skeeter seemed startled to remember they weren’t alone in the room. She eyed the glamoured Dark Lord and seemed to find a suitable amount of familial resemblance to accept this unknown as Harry Potter’s Uncle and turned back to a now un-glamoured Hadrian. “So, what Hadrian Peverell looks like, is closer to what Harry Potter has looked like for a while now. Not that anyone but Uncle Tom has seen me without a glamour for a very long time.”
This chapter fought me... Barty wasn't coming out quite how I wanted him but I hope you still enjoy and know that he should get better as I go along and he becomes a more developed personality for me. It's a bit of a short one but, as we keep going with the story there'll be more longer chapters for you all.
“Well then,” Hadrian said, regretfully unlocking his hand from Draco’s as he stood. The wolves immediately standing in respect of him. “Those of you who have business with the new Lord Potter-Black are more than welcome to accompany me to sort out the particulars. I believe we have encroached ourselves on the Goblins for too long already.” He nodded respectfully in Giphook’s direction and bowed with a fist over his chest to Director Ragnok before helping Draco stand from his chair. With a hand on the small of Draco’s back Hadrian walked calmly out of the Gringotts meeting room, his people obediently following behind him.
On another note, I think Lord Thanatos will be fortnightly updated until life clams down a bit and uni isn't riding my ass with assignments and the like. This might mean that my chapters are a bit longer than they have been. It will depend on the subject matter though.
There were a few gasps at the revelation of Harry’s hyphenated last name that had Sirius smug. His son really had fooled them all. Ragnok pulled out a large, glowing orb and placed it on the table in front of him. He tapped it with his finger and the image of a scrawny, messy haired fifteen year old Harry Potter appeared above it.
Draco watched as Hadrian Peverell’s followers, the Wolves apparently, ate breakfast around him in silent anticipation. Each member of what Draco was fondly calling the Pack, would switch between watching their Lord and the large open window behind him while they ate. The room was practically vibrating with excited magic and Draco could tell something big was about to happen. It was something to do with Hadrian’s plans but for the life of him Draco couldn’t think what it was.
“Indeed,” Draco muttered, looking down at his tea, probably to hide the light blush that rose on his cheeks. Luna could see Draco was confused by her words, but he would understand soon enough. People always did.
“I found out Pettigrew was the traitor from Tom the year before and had no idea why Sirius was so intent on getting in to Hogwarts until I saw the stupid rat’s name on the Map.”
Skeeter nodded her head, a malicious smile breaking out on her heavily made-up face and stuck out her hand for Hadrian to shake. “I think, Mr. Peverell, this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.”
That is all I can tell you for the moment, dear readers but I assure you, I will be bringing you more on our Saviour as my findings are confirmed. If Harry Potter is reading this, however; take care, young saviour, we may need you yet.
“What’s wrong with Harry?” one of the Weasley twins spoke up and Sirius thanked Merlin that Harry had some real friends in the group of fake Gryffindor’s he was practically forced into hanging out with.
knew that. Had Harry been content to know only what the Order and his friends told him, he would have no knowledge worth Death Eaters torturing him for. Not that Sirius was completely convinced the Death Eaters weren’t on Harry’s side anyway. He knew Harry had no love for Dumbledore or the Light side, the mark on his left shoulder proved that much, but he wasn’t sure how Dark Harry was willing to go. Not that it mattered too much. He would follow his son wherever he went.
“There are a few conditions Harry set in order for the two of you to formally become Friends of the House Potter,” Hadrian began, addressing the two Weasleys across from him. “If those conditions are met, there will be a great many benefits that come with your new status, including the opportunity to seek unquestioned sanctuary with me if at any point, should you require it.”
Giving a low curtsy, then a reverent ‘My Lord’, Luna made her way up onto the dais and sat elegantly on her Lord’s lap. She could feel silver eyes piercing into her back and let a devious smirk grace her angelic features. A certain young Dragon was going to be very mad in a moment and Luna was revelling in the thought of it. Her Lord would never let anything happen to her. And maybe it would get the two of them together. Finally.
to be able to inherit, but he still had power to his name and money in his vaults. And he would never have let the old man in
“I want out of the Harry Potter shitshow, Rita, so in two days time, you will receive a package of documents detailing Harry Potter’s trip to Gringotts on the 17th of June. It includes a medical report detailing all the potions in his system from Dumbledore and the long lasting injuries and malnutrition he suffered at the hands of his relatives. There will also be proof that Harry Potter accepted his Potter and Black lordships on the 17th of June, some of the more public aspects of his Will and a letter to you that includes an autobiographical account of his life and states you will only receive the package in the event of his death.”
“Your Uncle was in a meeting with my father when I happened upon them, Hadrian,” Draco explained as he made his way back to his seat. Hadrian noted the slight smirk on his face and wondered how much the Malfoy heir had already been aware of his father’s tendency to speak before thinking and getting himself in trouble. If he knew that Lucius was likely to get in more trouble than he could conceivably handle if he spoke out against Hadrian for the third time in as many days.
“What has amused you so, Little Moon?” he enquired, sounding genuinely interested. It was one of the things Luna loved most about her Lord; when she was talking to him, he actually paid attention. She hadn’t experienced that much before she met her Lord and treasured him all the more for making her feel welcome.
And if Albus Dumbledore came away from this with barely a scrap of his current power and social standing, Severus would be an extremely contented man.
“I hope you don’t mind me tagging along, Hadrian,” Tom began, amusement shining in his glamoured eyes. “You know I love it when you have company,” he smirked darkly, eyes flicking slightly to Lucius as he made his way to a free seat, “it’s always so entertaining.”
Draco was nervous. He was standing in the sitting room of Peverell Manor, the Dark Lord and Hadrian’s home, waiting for the inner circle of followers to the second deadliest person he had ever met to arrive. He had no idea what to expect and, honestly, he wasn’t sure he wanted to find out. But, the Dark Lord requested his presence and Hadrian Peverell hadn’t kicked him out yet, so he was required to see this meeting through. He just hoped Hadrian hadn’t invited a group of people from Hogwarts who hated him. That wouldn’t end well.
,“ Tom rolled his eyes at the teen and his constant hints that he rejoin his horcruxes, “came to the same conclusion as Dumbledore and immediately searched for the boys. Why he chose the Potter’s that night, I don’t know, but he did, and after gaining the address from their secret keeper Peter Pettigrew, Voldemort went after Harry Potter.”
going to have to do something to thank Hadrian. He was releasing Severus from a great deal of his oaths.
A blush ran up Hadrian’s neck before he could repress it, not used to having compliments directed at his body. “No, not all of it. It fixed my eyes and gave me a little height and muscle definition, but I’ve been wearing a glamour since you started sending me nutrient potions over the summer. I’ve been working on not being the scrawny git the twins call me, so most of this is just me. I also managed to figure out enough of my metamorphmagus ability to change the gravity defying hair and cover my scar.”
Sirius’ eyes snapped back to the stranger in the room, studying his features, as he quickly pulled Remus to the seats directly opposite the man who could be his son. There were definitely similarities. The same high cheekbones he inherited from Sirius’ father, the same straight nose as James and those eyes... there was no denying that this was Harry Potter. No one had eyes that green but his son.
“We should return to Grimmuald now, my Lord,” Black said from beside his mate. “The old coot will be wondering what you wanted to speak to us about. I’ll give my report to Neville as usual?”
Sirius traded a look with Remus as Dumbledore cleared his throat, expecting the room to delve into silence at his simplest command. But this wasn’t Hogwarts. Dumbledore didn’t quite reign supreme outside the Castle’s hallowed halls. Especially as the man continued to sprout to anyone who would listen that Voldie was back, despite the old snake-face having yet given no sign of getting up to his old tricks. If it weren’t for Harry’s, sometimes cryptic, comments about said Dark Lord, Sirius would have been right along-side the masses in thinking Dumbledore had finally gone completely barmy.
“Yes, I am,” he said and glanced at Tom. He knew where this was going too and was ready to back Hadrian up if he needed. “I was homeschooled for a while but Uncle Tom decided I needed a chance to network before taking my NEWTs, especially after taking up my Lordship. I’ll be at Hogwarts for my seventh year this year.”
has to say this fine morning,” he intoned cheerfully, picking up the paper and smoothing it out to see Skeeter’s article. He cleared his throat and read:
a little something for each of you and I trust that Ragnok and Griphook will be able to help you retrieve it all from my Vaults.”
Lucius bowed then, low and deep. Just a fraction higher than he usually would for his sworn Lord. His face deathly pale and displaying the full depth of his regret at speaking out of turn. “Yes my Lord Peverell-Ravenclaw-Black-Potter, Heir Slytherin. I apologise.” Peverell nodded his approval and Lucius slunk back to his seat. He was likely to remain silent for the rest of the night.
Charlie Weasley stared at Hadrian wide eyed for a moment, his hand absently stroking the smooth exterior of the dragon egg before him. “Is it alive?” he asked finally and seemed to both relax and tense in anticipation with Hadrian’s nod.
I bring you grave news tonight, my dear readers. At approximately four o’clock this afternoon, Aurors were called to the scene of a magical house fire in the Muggle area of Little Whinging, Surrey. The house, now identified as the summer residence of one Harry Potter, took a team of six Aurors an hour to contain and put out, before an investigative team was dispatched to find the cause of the blaze and identify any casualties. The Auror response time was swift enough that the house retained its base structure and the one body left in well enough condition to be correctly identified.
A few more people entered the room and Sirius watched with amusement as Harry - no, Hadrian now, - ignored the presence of the Weasleys and Granger but stood to greet Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy. He guided them to the seats next to him and it didn’t go past Sirius that Hadrian placed the Malfoy kid in the most protected place in the room: Right between Snape and Hadrian himself and across from Sirius, Remus and Bill Weasley. Hadrian obviously wasn’t comfortable with the blonde being here and Sirius had to wonder whether his son had picked up a creature inheritance since he last saw him. Hadrian was certainly acting in the subtle way Moony sometimes would with him in a room full of potential threats.
The clear dismissal from a creature Dumbledore deemed below him made the man bristle and Sirius was pleased to note Dumbledore’s plan had obviously revolved around a different will. He watched as the Headmaster eyed off the youngest Malfoy and realised he was worried the title would go to him. It would make Lucius Malfoy a
William and Charles Weasley were directed to a couch furthest from the warmth of the fire while Severus and Hadrian settled on armchairs clustered with Draco’s own. The subtle power play present in the seating arrangement reminded Draco fondly of the Slytherin common room. Everyone knew the best seat was always the second armchair from the fire and Hadrian sat proudly in that position. Draco absently wondered how long it would take Hadrian to claim that particular seat in the Slytherin common room, come September. He didn’t think it would be especially long.
Hadrian was very good at cracking the masks of the very purebloods who prided themselves on their unbreakable emotional control and he revelled in talking circles around them until they broke. It so happened that it was poor Lucius Malfoy who had taken the brunt of Hadrian’s amusement so far this summer and Tom immensely enjoyed watching the two interact.
Sirius threw open the front door, hardly caring that he set off the ghastly portrait of his mother, and moved forward onto the top step. With a turn of his heel, he disapparated with
Thanks again to Liz for being my spare eyes and I want to thank all you lovely people who've stuck with this fic so far! Your comments make my day and I love knowing that you enjoy this as much as I do.
Sitting next to Severus on a large bronze and blue couch was one of the only people Severus would think to call friend, Lucius Malfoy. Severus was intimately acquainted with the less than stellar aspects of Lucius’ personality and therefore was not remotely surprised when the blonde man stood up suddenly and pointed an accusing finger at Hadrian Peverell. An extremely stupid thing to do in Severus’ eyes, considering said Vampire was currently in the presence of his Donor and his inner circle. Threatening Vampires in front of what they considered theirs was, generally, just a horrible idea if you wished to keep your blood
“As payment for his follower’s work, the Dark Lord promised to try and spare the young man’s childhood friend, despite the fact she was a muggle-born, fought faithfully for the light and birthed the Dark Lord’s prophesied downfall.”
The DMLE further shocked us when they announced an anonymous source had delivered none other than Peter Pettegrew himself to the Ministry’s doorstep last night.
Tom’s hair had darkened to a deep chocolate brown, his eyes changed to an enticing blue-green that seemed to shift between the two as he moved his head, and his skin tone had darkened a shade or two to match Hadrian’s golden tan. In short, they looked very much like father and son.
The Vampire Lord left the office followed by an obedient Barty, leaving behind a blushing young Malfoy and three highly amused wizards.
“See to it that it doesn’t,” he said as he stalked back to his seat by the fire. Doing nothing to break the tension that continued to fill the air. They all knew now; Draco was his. It was for the best. It meant they would leave his mate alone.
“Thank you, my Lord. It’s just -” he stopped, wondering how he should phrase this to make sure he didn’t end up out of his Lord’s favour. “Are you absolutely positive we can trust the boy, my Lord? You say he has been manipulating the light for six years, how is it you know that he hasn’t been doing the same to the Dark?”
“Why, my Lord is making the most beautiful rooms for you,” she sang and watched as his eyes widened. “The wrackspurts have swarmed him the past week but they will leave him alone soon enough. You will not be disappointed.”
Tom would forever treasure the memory of Lucius’ affronted look as Hadrian turned to the Malfoy Lord and told him, in the simplest terms, to ‘shove his weak protection up his ass because Draco wouldn’t need it,’ for as long as he lived. Enduring the irate blonde pacing his office for an hour after the event was well worth the entertainment. He’d often thanked his lucky stars that his horcrux was not some feeble-minded Light-aligned Dumbledore fanatic. It was much more entertaining this way.
? There was absolutely no logical explanation for Harry bloody Potter to be standing casually in the Dark Lord’s study. Draco had said the brat was as Light as they came, Dumbledore’s personal weapon, the Golden Boy of Gryffindor. The boy could not be here and still be
“Dumbledore took that to mean that Tom was back and proceeded to tell everyone that I had this epic battle with him. He’s been telling everyone he could for two years and Tom’s just been sitting back watching him destroy his own reputation, so something good came of it all, I guess”
. Emerald green lit up in amusement at Draco’s stunned face, lack of Malfoy decorum oozing out of the young man, and Severus reared back in shock. Occlumency shields barely keeping the horror off his face.
Hadrian finished talking just as the two Goblins entered carrying a shrunken box each. They stalked to the head of the table and enlarged the two boxes for everyone to see. Each person was passed their gift from Harry but Hadrian kept his eyes trained on Charlie Weasley. The stocky redhead accepted a wrapped spherical shaped object, about 12 inches tall and a letter with his name neatly printed on the front in Harry’s recognisable scratchy handwriting.
Avery looked into her eyes as she lifted the silencing charm and sneered at her. “I will not answer to some little girl.” Luna cocked her head to the side in thought for a moment, heard her Lord’s chuckle at the movement, one of her tells that something dangerous was about to happen, and raised her wand. She pointed it directly between Avery’s watery blue eyes and cast her spell. It was an old spell she had learnt from the library Salazar Slytherin so graciously left under Hogwarts for their perusal. It temporarily blinded the victim and instead of being surrounded by blackness, it caused them to witness their most painful moments. The Dark Lord Voldemort’s Death Eaters were particularly susceptible to this curse, Luna had found, as proven by Avery writhing in imagined agony on tiles. That was the beauty of the curse, it was all in your head so one could be under it for as long as the caster chose and the only damage done would be that of the mind.
Sirius, will use the shop in Hogsmeade I also got for you to open that Cafe you guys always talked about when you were younger.”
The haughty look Peverell sported now told Severus exactly how he felt about his inheritance being questioned by a Lord of lower standing. “No, Lucius,” the young Vampire purred, “
Hadrian snorted and bit back a comment about her never having admitted to not knowing anything before. He Squeezed Draco’s hand in amusement, belatedly realising the blonde had never let go and was now significantly closer to him than when they arrived. It felt wonderful. “It seems a bit of a history lesson is in order before Ragnok and Griphook return.” Draco squeezed Hadrian’s hand and he had to stop himself from turning to stare reverently into the beautiful silver eyes just next to him. This blonde was too much.
It was clear the man was a true Slytherin and, while his last name and numerous Lordships would help his reputation within the House of Snakes, his ability to lead and his obvious magical prowess would determine him as someone
I hope you all like what I'm doing with Sirius. I love him and he didn't deserve to die in this story too, so he won't
“Ah, Tom?” Hadrian asked, uncharacteristically uncertain as he questioned the Dark Lord. He was worried he was about to come off as pushy or disrespectful to someone who had already gone above and beyond for the young Vampire. “Yes, Hadrian. You know you’re allowed to ask questions here. You are, after all, my equal, brat.” Tom said, his fondness for the teen shining through his ruby eyes.
I am so sorry for making you all wait! It has been a hectic couple of months and I hope you have all been staying safe and as happy as you can be. Enjoy!
All Albus knew for certain was that this had to stop. He had to find a way to get the public back on his side. He would have to organise something to remind them all of the hero he was. Just what that would be, he didn’t know yet. It was time to call a meeting of his pawns. They might have some ideas, they all loved him after all.
“I will not force this kind of connection on him Luna, you know that,” he said as his fangs dragged along her skin. “He will come to me when he wants me.”
“Leave the bottle,” Tom asked the small creature as it returned with the amber liquid and six glasses. “We’re going to need it.”
“This is what happened that night,” Hadrian said as he pulled out his wand. He drew a memory from his temple, but instead of summoning a pensieve as expected, Hadrian muttered a few Latin words and a scene rose from the end of his wand.
Hadrian watched as the room’s occupants collected their belongings and knew he would treasure the memory of Dumbledore’s affronted and confused expression for a very long time. He imagined Tom would find this equally enjoyable and vowed to show him the memory when he returned home.
Hadrian’s smile was just as sharp as he stood and led the reporter out of the room. Albus Dumbledore would never knew what hit him.
Severus thought that, yes, Peverell had most likely been deceiving them all this time and that he, along with the entire wizarding world, had severely underestimated the wrath of an intelligent and powerful young man. Severus was glad to be on Peverell’s good side and was not going to be doing anything, any time soon to change that position. No matter how much he hated the boy’s father.
“We will be stationing a guard outside his relatives house again this summer,” Dumbledore continued, “as I believe this article will bring danger to dear Harry. The Death Eaters will no doubt be doubling their efforts to find him and this so called ‘dangerous information.’”
“Heir Slytherin as well if you don’t mind,” the Dark Lord said darkly and Severus was sure Lucius would be facing the wrath of their Lord at some point in the near future. Why he couldn’t just keep his mouth shut and act like a Slytherin, Severus didn’t know.
“They’re here,” Hadrian said sharply, giving Ronald a look that told everyone how unimpressed he was with the red-head, “because Harry Potter asked them to be here.” Sirius stifled another chuckle at the pureblood attitude Hadrian had shown. There were some things that just couldn’t be taught and the ability to look down on someone without being physically taller than them was one.
“Yes, they’ve, that’s Dumbles, the Weasleys, Granger and the Order, have been trying to dictate my life with absolutely no success since I was eleven. They’ve given me everything I could possibly need to make their lives a living hell and win the war for the Dark without Voldie-pants here having to lift a finger.”
The nervous tension coming off the young Vampire softened the Dark Lord’s eyes and caused a genuine, albeit small, smile to grace his handsome face. Hadrian had to physically stop himself from gaping at the rare sight, lest it never happen again. “Of course you can call them Hades, the safety of your followers is paramount. There will, of course, be rules they will have to follow and vows of secrecy they will have to take but, yes Hadrian. Send letters with the floo address tonight and I will open it tomorrow from 10-11am”
. He was about to see whether Rita Skeeter was all she talked herself up to be. His plans were in motion and Dumbledore would no doubt be sitting in his office, high up in the towers of Hogwarts, sweating in his outrageously coloured robes.
“Now, drink,” she pulled his head down to rest in the crook of her neck and Hadrian was overwhelmed by the complete rightness of her scent. He licked up her pulse, numbing the area with his venom, positioned his mouth right above her lifeblood and sank his fangs into the pure, creamy skin of her neck. The taste of her exploded in his mouth, sweet and unyielding and completely
Hope you enjoy this chapter. I know it's kinda wordy but it should get better as the story progresses and we start getting into some actual plot.
Both Weasley’s looked so shocked Draco couldn’t help the snort that escaped him. He felt a blush rise up his neck as everyone turned to look at him, then Hadrian cleared his throat to continue. As the attention was drawn back to the vampire lord, Draco noticed a set of eyes lingered on him longer than the rest. The younger Weasley’s ice blue gaze ran over his form and Draco couldn’t help but shudder at the feeling. He was so used to the piercing intensity of Hadrian’s stare, the younger Weasley’s amorous gaze felt wrong in comparison.
Voices floated in from the open doorway, and Draco watched as Hadrian’s guests took in the wonder of Peverell Manor. It had nothing on the elegance and opulence of Draco’s own home, in his admittedly biased opinion, but it was homey and stylish without screaming untold wealth like some pureblood manor’s.
Severus cast the diagnostic charm and a list of golem-Harry’s injuries appeared in tight green script on a conjured bit of parchment. The list clearly stated a punctured right lung to be the cause of death and that the body had been dead for at least 48 hours. A quick identity charm confirmed the body to be Harry James Potter and Severus was happy to conclude the Aurors would successfully identify the body.
throughout the British Isles. Every name I hold is older and richer and more respected than the Malfoy name and, if you push me Lucius, I have thousands of years to watch as every Malfoy who thinks themselves better than me falls. And they will know it is all your fault.”
“That is his complete medical history and the scan after his treatment with the Goblins this morning. Take a look and brew anything you think he should take. I will handle getting him to actually take them. You may begin now.”
“Indeed,” Tom said, “he should be exceedingly grateful that you and I were working together already because that year could have ended
Rita looked intrigued and Hadrian took a moment to see what Draco, Lucius and Severus thought. All three men looked slightly pale at the mention of Harry Potter’s less than stellar past but amused at the interaction between Hadrian and Skeeter. They could see Dumbledore’s name was about to be dragged through the mud and they were excited.
“Well, I decided a few years ago that I no longer wanted to be Dumbledore’s puppet. He knew what was going on at my Aunt’s and refused to allow me to stay anywhere else when I asked him before summer every year. Every year something stupidly life-threatening happens at Hogwarts and he has resorted to very underhanded tactics to get me to comply with his plans. When I went to Gringotts when I got off the train this summer, I needed a Goblin grade purging ritual to clear my system of all the compulsion and personality altering potions he had fed me over the years.”
baby of Petunia’s sister was dumped on their doorstep and vowed to make the child’s life as unpleasant as they could without actually dropping him off at an orphanage.”
Luna didn’t particularly care about Avery’s mind at the moment. He had insulted both her Lord and herself at this point and that was unforgivable within the Wolves. Avery was not a Wolf, however, so she supposed she had better leave Lord Voldemort with a sane Death Eater. Luna released the curse and Avery’s screams watered down to whimpers at her feet. She reached down to the crying man before her and grasped his chin in her delicate hands. Forcing him to meet her eyes. “We’ll try that again, little bird. What was it you said to my Lord that upset him so?”
Hadrian stood for a moment and put up his standard Harry Potter glamour before sitting back down, now seeming several feet shorter and three times skinnier. Rita’s eyes were wide as she took in the similarities between this and his previous form, the colour of his hair and eyes and his skin tone, clearly taking his evidence as proof of his claims. “How?” she asked again.
A low growl rippled out of Hadrian’s chest and Draco felt the unexpected need to sink to his knees. He steeled himself as Hadrian spoke, “Neville, introduce yourselves, we’ll be down in time for dinner. Twins, play nice.” And just like that, Hadrian Peverell whisked Luna Lovegood out of the room and disappeared. Draco could only hope that maybe, after all this time, he and Hadrian could just be friends.
I just want to say thank you to everyone who's been reading this fic. All your comments and kudos literally make my day, you're all so lovely.
“Oh -,” Draco exclaimed, obviously not expecting to encounter someone so early on a Saturday morning. Luna had noticed the young man liked to rise before everyone else in order to spend some time on his own before the wolves awoke. She understood. Living with a small family for your whole life did nothing to prepare you for waking up to deal with the Weasley twins and Barty. They were much more than only the most patient person could handle in the morning. Luna admired her Lord for his ability to do just that.
Anyway, sorry for the long wait. I know it's not a Sunday but close enough, yeah? This chapter is long and I hope it is everything you've been waiting so patiently for xx
“Yes, Severus. You have been unwittingly helping Hadrian here for years,” Tom said snickering at the look of shock on Severus’ face.
Fred and George looked truly gobsmacked. Draco had to appreciate the gift that Harry was clearly giving the two. They had never been from a well-off family and didn’t seem like the sort to accept charity or favours. Harry had essentially set Fred and George up for life.
Draco had been observing Harry Potter since he was eleven. Some might call it stalking, or obsessing, or, as Pansy so elegantly put it, lusting … but Draco called it observing. Albeit extensive and extremely thorough observing over a prolonged period of time. Basically, Draco could pick Harry Potter out of a room full of a hundred Harry Potter look a-likes in less than a minute. He always knew where the Boy-Who-Lived was, and thought he had known everything he could ever know about him.
“Second year was all Lucius really, wasn’t it Tom?” Hadrian said. Eyes full of mischief as the Malfoy Lord paled considerably and shrunk even further into the couch. Severus decided that he needed to have a chat with Narcissa. They needed to keep a closer eye on the blonde prat before he got himself killed.
The next series of memories made Draco and three of the Dark Lord’s most ruthless followers sick to their stomach. They may have condoned the torture of blood-traitors and muggles, people who deserved it, who had done the world and magic wrong. Never, had they seen this level of torture on a child who, for all that anyone knew, had done nothing more than possess the gift of magic in his blood.
Just as she grew bored watching Avery whimper, holding his arm to his chest and unable to stand up from his prostrated position, the double doors at the end of the room opened. Two tall, forest green cloaked figures entered with their hoods up. They walked regally through the mass, stunned silent before them, and up to the dais. With a low bow to their Lord and a respectful incline of the head to Lord Voldemort, the demons addressed Lord Thanatos.
“Now that we’ve all settled down,” Director Ragnok started from the head of the table, his eyes roving around the odd assembly of people before him. “We shall proceed with the reading of the Will of one Harry James Potter-Black.”
to find out what she knew and deal with her accordingly. Had to see how much the boy had known and had been willing to pass on in the event of his untimely death. Had to stop anything else from being released before all his long term plans came crashing down around him. He
This chapter has a bit more action than you're probably used to. Tom and Hadrian make a show of being magically powerful just to get on people's nerves but there's nothing overly graphic so if you're squeamish, don't worry.
“Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks, as Lord Black I formally invite you back into the House of Black and grant you both your Allowance Vaults. The new Lord Black has been asked to remove you again the moment you disrespect your family in any way.”
“Now Albus Dumbledore, being the man of infinite wisdom that he is, heard this prophecy and immediately started looking for candidates that fit this description and he came to two conclusions; Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. He immediately moved the families of these two children into hiding in order to protect the prophecy child from the evil Dark Lord Voldemort.”
“As it so happens,” Lord Thanatos continued a hint of a snarl entering his voice as his magic continued to suffocate the room, “I have found you a new test subject.” He inclined his head in Avery’s direction and the twins shared a manic grin. The room around them was silent except for Avery’s whimpers and Luna wondered whether anyone else
“Yes, my Lord,” Severus replied, putting the scroll in an inner pocket of his robes. Not trusting himself to look at it now, knowing he would have an extremely adverse reaction to the information contained on the scroll. He stood, bowing to his Lord and exited the office, he had potions to brew.
They stood together for what felt like hours, while the Ministry workers cleared the area. Both distraught at the thought that their little pack was another member down.
Hadrian smirked as Skeeter paled. She nodded her head quickly and stuck out her hand for Hadrian to shake. “What is it that I can be doing for you, Mr. Peverell?” she blurted, clearly ruffled by the threat from someone she had never met and Hadrian was content to keep this meeting going.
Draco’s reaction was the most entertaining to Hadrian, and he tried to avoid letting the smug look on his face become too obvious. Lust was crashing out of his young mate in waves. Tom noticed too, of course, but Hadrian studiously ignored the Dark Lord’s snickering.
“Yes, my Grandmother was a Black from the main line. And, when I was born, Sirius blood adopted me and named me his heir. He knew even then that he would produce no heirs himself and I have always been like a son to him.”
Luna leaned back into her Lord and whispered in his ear. All eyes were on her and the way her Lord was making small circles with his fingers, slowly running up her thighs.
Hadrian stiffened as he sensed his mate walking into the room. His hands tightened around the waist of the girl on his lap. The scent of both his donor and mate in the same room was driving the young Vampire crazy, especially since his mate had not yet been claimed and was surrounded by potential threats.
Remus put a hand on his arm as Sirius sat back down, staring intently at the table in front of him. Not many people knew the extent of his relationship with Harry, that of father and son, and too many people would be willing to take advantage of it if they did. He had to play the devastated godfather for a little while longer and besides, he wanted to know what Harry had left him. It must be important if he didn’t just give it to him in person.
“Tom and I talked for a bit, came up with a story and I went on my way back to Hogwarts with Cedric’s body. I told Dumbledore the truth; that Pettigrew portkeyed us to one of the Dark Lord’s bases in order to kill me. He killed Cedric as soon as we landed and I managed to hold Pettigrew off until I could get back to the Cup.” At the confused look the room was giving him, Hadrian chuckled a little.
“I’d like to bring my circle here before Rita’s first article goes out. Just to make sure they’re protected from the backlash that is bound to come from that horrible Weasley woman. If that’s okay with you of course, I know how you are about people getting into your space.”
Greedy looks were now appearing over the two youngest Weasleys and Granger as Sirius observed with disgust. He truly commended Hadrian’s ability to be in the same room as them, knowing what they’d done to him. Anticipation rose within him as he wondered just how many secrets Harry was going to reveal this morning.
“Why wasn’t the new Lord Potter informed of this before the reading?” Dumbledore spoke up from his seat in the centre of the table. He was still clearly of the belief that Harry was so fooled by him as to make him (or one of his pawns) the new Lord Potter.
Okay everyone, because I'm impatient and I have been sitting on this chapter since 'Living Vampire' I'll treat you all to a surprise update. And it's a long one! This chapter has been written then re-written, scrapped completely then re-written again and it is finally here! I had a LOT of fun with this chapter, I love it almost as much as I love 'Sit Down, Lucy Dear' and I really hope you all like it too. Hadrian and Draco are finally getting something going that will be continuing on to the next chapter in a way that I just LOVE and hopefully they'll realise they're perfect together sooner rather than later.
Severus stood, a pink tinge to his cheeks as he realised what he had done. “Um, well, yes,” he said, “you know I will be checking up on that.” He backed up until he reached the couch and sat down again, refusing to meet the eyes of anyone in the room. Hadrian took pity on the man and moved the conversation in another direction.
“Well, Rita, in the barest sense of the word, yes, I am going to kill Harry Potter.” Hadrian smiled a dark smile, full of teeth and fangs. “Oh, don’t be so shocked Rita, you won’t be an accessory to murder, he’s not actually going to die. Just the
There were gasps from the three who had never seen it before and Barty felt immensely proud to bare the beautiful mark of his Lord.
“Hadrian is far more vindictive towards those who harm the people he loves, than he is to those who harm himself; Dumbledore being the exception of course,” the Dark Lord explained and Severus supposed he could understand. Though, why the boy didn’t just leave the Dursleys in the house when he burnt it to the ground was still confusing. It was what Severus would have done, If he wasn’t so much more inclined to making everyone suffer as much as he did.
“Where was I?” Hadrian asked the room in general, easing the tension that had been thick in the air from the moment he stood up.
“If I’m completely honest with you all, it started when I got my Hogwarts letter,” Hadrian said thoughtfully. “I had spent my whole life being told I was a freak who’s drunken parents died in a car crash and then suddenly I’m thrust into a world where I’m famous for vanquishing the Dark Lord Voldemort and my parents were war heroes who died tragically protecting me."
“Good, Nev, has Sirius been in touch with -” Hadrian stopped as the floo roared again and a small, blonde girl glided out of the fireplace. Hadrian was by her side in a flash and Draco watched as the girl, Luna Lovegood if he remembered correctly, looked up into Hadrian’s eyes and smiled. “My Lord,” she said and Draco’s heart sank as Hadrian pulled the girl into a tight hug, nuzzling his nose against her neck, breathing in her scent. Well damn, he thought. She must be his mate.
LOTS of people in this chapter just to make it really crowded and not a lot actually happens but I hope you enjoy a bit more of Sirius' pov.
Hadrian sat, surrounded by his Wolves, enjoying a nice Sunday breakfast. The Elves had done especially well with the eggs this morning and Hadrian reminded himself to go down to the kitchen and thank the little creatures. It was always good to have the favour of the ones responsible for your food after all. He imagined it lead to significantly fewer poisonings.
Severus snorted. He knew Petunia Dursley nee Evans and he had to agree, there was no abundance of brain cells in her horse-like head. In fact, he would have attributed the lack of intelligence Potter seemed to display to her influence, had the old coot ever seen fit to inform him that's where he placed the boy all those years ago.
“I’ve thought a lot about what to say in this,” will-Harry continued, all eyes snapping back to the projection, “and I think it’s time I told you all something. I know you’re all thinking that I was probably killed by Voldemort, he has been trying to kill me since I was one so that would make sense, yeah? But in all honesty, I think it’s more likely these days that I’ll be killed by my Uncle.” Sirius gasped and had to force himself not to look in Hadrian’s direction. Was his son saying what he thought he was saying? If those filthy muggles did more than just withhold food, Sirius was going to be greatly at risk of having a
Gasps came from both Malfoys and Severus who were shocked beyond belief that someone would dare talk to their Lord in that manner. Barty just smothered an amused snort, slightly more used to the way the two Lords interacted, but
Hadrian nodded and began pacing a loose circle around the kneeling man. A low latin chant followed him that Tom couldn’t quite make out and would have to ask Hadrian for later. The circle was made three times before Hadrian once again stood before his new subordinate. He placed a hand on Lupin’s shoulder and spoke his final lines “Let Magic acknowledge that I, Hadrian Corvus Peverell, Lord Thanatos, accept you, Remus John Lupin as a Wolf from this day until you should wish to leave my service.”
“Pettigrew had this stupidly insane thought that, if he portkeyed me to the Dark Lord he would be handsomely rewarded and I would end up dead. So he snuck into Hogwarts, charmed the triwizard cup into a portkey and, when Cedric and I took the cup, we were transported to the graveyard near Tom’s muggle relatives house. He has wards there that alert him to people trespassing on his land and ended up meeting us there. That wasn’t before the stupid rat came and killed poor Cedric.” Hadrian’s face was impassive, but Barty remembered how distraught his young Lord was at the death of his friend. Cedric was an unnecessary death and Lord Thanatos did not condone such a thing at the best of times, let alone when they’re possible followers.
Hadrian moved forward in his seat, staring directly into the eyes of the reporter in front of him. His voice deepened and held a tone of finality that clearly stated he was giving an order.
Barty smiled at that thought. He really was proud of his position in his Lord’s ranks.
