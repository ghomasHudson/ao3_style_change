Draco looked at a bit nervous and speechless-looking Harry and sighed heavily. “Sorry. I’m kind of practising telling more openly about my thoughts and feelings. My mind healer tells it helps. And the group.”
“Potter! Could you stop for a minute?” Malfoy shouted, racing towards Harry. The git was fast, Harry could give him that.
Instead of meeting in the Room of Requirement, Harry and Draco had agreed to meet at the Boathouse this time. The days were already so short as the darkness arrived early, and no one fancied going out if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. Besides, it had been snowing quite heavily during the past couple of days, so it felt a bit masochistic to even try to get through all the snow. Especially as there was no path to the Boathouse because no one used it during the winter months.
Harry found Sirius in the drawing room, regarding the Black family tree Harry had studied already last summer. Sirius turned his gaze to Harry when he heard him approaching.
“What happened? Why did you break up?” Ron asked.
The biggest problem now seemed to be that Harry had no idea what he should do next. Harry wasn’t really comfortable with his gay feelings, let alone gay feelings towards Malfoy. And what could he even do? There was no way he could just follow his instincts and push Malfoy against a wall and start snogging him in broad daylight. Harry grimaced at the thought. That would undoubtedly go well. Harry felt lost with Malfoy and his mixed signals, and he didn’t have a hint of what the Slytherin was feeling. In fact, Harry wasn’t even sure this wasn’t just some really twisted scheme to – what? Humiliate Harry? In any case, Harry was pretty sure even Malfoy wouldn’t go this far.
“Oh yeah,” Harry snorted, rolling his eyes. When his friends had gotten together, their constant bickering had turned into almost sickeningly harmonious coexistence, and Harry didn’t know which one he preferred. “There’s just the tiny little matter he tried to kill you and didn’t do anything while Bellatrix tortured Hermione. Not turning us into Voldemort is the only thing I can come up with how he helped us. It doesn’t count for much.”
“And you were supposed to be a prefect,” Harry said, grinning and pinching slightly Draco’s arm.
Probably Harry’s favourite ordinary thing of all was flying. As he had been forbidden to fly and play Quidditch almost the whole last school year, he couldn’t get enough of it now. Whenever he wasn’t spending time with Draco or occupied by school things, he tended to sneak out to the Quidditch pitch with his Firebolt. It would have been even more fun if Draco could have joined him, but Harry didn’t even dare to suggest it this year. At least, he had always Ginny who was more than eager to go flying and talk endlessly about this year’s Quidditch tactics. Those Harry wouldn’t even be able to share with Draco anyway as he had been, to his surprise, chosen as Gryffindor’s new Quidditch captain.
“You maniac, your brain will freeze!” Draco yelled as Harry appeared back above the surface, laughing.
Although, none of this mattered any longer in the slightest. Tomorrow his life would be taken from him, he no longer needed his body for anything.
Harry sighed. “I don’t remember much of yesterday, not after we had come back to Hogwarts.”
“It’s good we’re talking about
“Oh.”
“And if I’ve understood correctly, the eight-years get to visit home during the weekends. I’d love you to visit me and Teddy as often as you want,” Andromeda went on.
“Umbridge makes me write lines, and she has a special quill for that. Look, this isn’t really a big deal.”
Draco gulped, feeling horror-struck. “Who?” he asked in a low voice.
When Draco got finally out, he was sure the air had never smelt as good and fresh as it did that day. For a moment he just stood outside, taking lungfuls of air and enjoying the sun playing on his face. It was probably the first time after the War he had even registered things like how the sun felt on his skin and how good it actually could feel just to breathe. The War made one strangely forget it really was possible to enjoy your senses instead of realizing their existence only when you were in mortal danger.
“I envied them, too, I think,” Harry said, and to his surprise, it felt quite good to say it out loud to someone for the first time in his life. “They had such a big family and I had no one as I don’t really count the Dursleys as my family. Then I had Sirius for a few years, and then he left me, too. I dunno, I suppose my childhood was a bit lonely.”
know, maybe even better than Harry himself. “You’re thinking about Malfoy, aren’t you? Draco Malfoy?”
Draco Malfoy was walking towards the Slytherin table, Pansy Parkinson clinging tightly to his arm. As they sat down next to each other, Parkinson took Malfoy’s plate giggling and started filling it. When she put the plate back in front of Malfoy, she kissed him eagerly on the mouth, putting her hands on his cheeks. Malfoy didn’t pull back. Instead, he seemed to be kissing Parkinson as eagerly as Parkinson was kissing him.
Then Malfoy grabbed Harry’s hand again and took the knife from him. “You’re definitely
Harry gave Draco a quick, small smile before the look on his face turned serious again. “Look, I’ve thought about us a bit,” he began, making Draco inhale sharply and snap his eyes at him.
“I think I’ve already done my bit,” Harry argued. “I’ll write a detailed, ten-page essay about what happened in the Astronomy Tower that night if that makes you happy.”
Harry rolled his eyes and gave Draco a lopsided smile. “As if you haven’t ever done the same. You haven’t lived if you’ve never tasted snow or icicles.”
That night, back in his dormitory, Harry found it hard to fall asleep. Having talked with Draco made him feel so much lighter, as though he had been unconsciously carrying a heavy burden that had now been taken away from him. He smiled softly, his body tingling pleasantly all over. It felt so good to be back with Draco and understand Draco had never really betrayed him nor stopped loving him.
“That sounds… nice,” Harry said, a bit awkwardly.
“Oh, stop brooding, Draco,” Ginny said, stepping into the kitchen, Andromeda following right after her. “Harry’s right, no one here thinks you’d be a bad person and we all want to have you here.”
thoughts and feelings that are in a huge conflict with your current behaviour.”
Harry was sitting in the kitchen at the Burrow, trying to open his eyes after another night filled with nightmares. It wasn’t even that early in the morning, but he was already regretting he had promised to come to the Burrow every other day to eat breakfast so that Molly could keep an eye on him. She had started to notice how much weight Harry had lost during the War and how he looked always so tired she had proposed Harry would visit them more regularly. According to Molly, it had not been the right time to move out on his own now, right after the War, when he was still going through trauma and grief for all the losses. At first, Harry hadn’t liked the idea, but Molly had been so lost after Fred’s death, constantly on the verge of tears and worrying excessively for all her family members, Harry had finally agreed to Molly’s proposal, hoping it would make her feel at least a bit better.
The first thing his hands met was a huge box of handmade and really expensive-looking chocolate pralines in every flavour one could think of. Harry didn’t know how he would even dare to eat them as each of them looked like a small piece of art.
“No, I just wanted to fly to the Moon. Wanted to get as far away from the Dursleys as possible. I’ve never even been on an aeroplane, so I don’t know how it feels like.”
“You bloody git with your idiotic Cloak,” Draco muttered, irritated and groping the air, trying to find Harry. “Now could you be so kind and explain where we’re going so I don’t have to stand here all alone looking like an utter imbecile?”
the Christmas holidays if it feels more appropriate then,” Ginny said as if reading Harry’s mind. “Just think about it. I’d be happy to help.”
Draco looked deep into Harry’s eyes, as if looking for signs that he was lying. “Why is everyone being so kind to me?” he almost whispered.
“So do your eyebrows,” Draco whispered, moving his fingers from Harry’s stubble to his brows. “And your eyelashes,” he continued, taking off Harry’s glasses to kiss his eyelids in turns.
“So, what is this thing?” Ginny asked, still studying the ring.
“Yes, this is her old house. I could show you your room?” Potter said, sounding somewhat impatient and tired as he started to steer Draco towards the staircase.
Hermione huffed, a bit frustrated. “Harry, what are you not telling me?”
“That’s not your business.”
“Thank you,” Harry said and took Draco’s hand tentatively. “I think we should make some ground rules, though.”
“It’s not his fault I’ve never gotten the chance to learn to know him, it was my sister and her dear husband who made the decision for him. And yes, I do trust him. He’s been nothing but polite and helpful, and, besides, he’s good with Teddy,” Andromeda said, her eyes glinting warmly. “I couldn’t just leave him. I’ve got quite a lot of experience of what he’s going through right now, having been disowned, too, as you very well remember.”
“I pushed him away and told him to leave me alone,” Harry said dryly.
Soon Harry’s eyes found the other boy, who was now sitting at the Slytherin table with his friends, looking anxious and poking his food absentmindedly. Draco was a good actor, Harry would give him that, although he didn’t know for what purpose Draco was still acting as if he regretted hitting Harry. Shouldn’t he be laughing and bragging loudly about breaking Harry’s nose?
“But I thought I already am your friend, though, Potter,” Zabini said.
Harry raised his gaze to Malfoy’s face, just to see the Slytherin was watching him intently. Malfoy’s usually stormy grey eyes seemed to be much calmer now, as if there was a hint of warmth in them.
“Yes, we can, and we are,” Lucius snarled. “Leave.”
Even though Harry didn’t have detention nor Quidditch practise anymore, friends, homework and DA kept him so busy it was hard to find time to meet Draco. And when Harry happened to have time, then Draco had his own Quidditch practise or some prefect stuff.
Harry chuckled and started stroking Draco’s hair as Draco turned his face back to the book. “And now you’re the one pet-naming me?”
Friday afternoon and evening at the Burrow felt pleasant but weird as Harry could hardly remember the house being as empty as it was now. Once Arthur and George had come home as well, they all ate dinner at the kitchen table where over half of the chairs were unoccupied. Harry wondered if that was how it usually felt when all of Molly and Arthur’s children had already started at Hogwarts or, like in Bill’s or Charlie’s cases, had already moved out on their own after graduating. Harry, though, had always been at the Burrow when almost all of the Weasleys had been present, so the silence and calmness felt a bit… unnerving.
“That sounds a bit exaggerated, I rather just walked in. Couldn’t miss the chance to take part in this small, sweet get-together,” Malfoy said and leaned suddenly towards Harry. “Or more precisely the chance to see the Chosen One,” he whispered in Harry’s ear, his hot breath tingling on Harry’s cheek. Harry’s breath hitched.
“Oh yes. Sounds like a Viking when he does that.”
Harry felt Draco’s body freezing suddenly. “I’ll never come back, mother. I can’t,” Draco whispered, sounding hurt.
“Draco has always been a bit, ah, obsessed with you, ever since the first year. It must have become an infatuation at some point during the last couple of years, and he can’t really hide his feelings that well anymore as his mood swings and rants about you have only worsened, which I, quite frankly, didn’t even know to be possible.”
Because why would he be afraid?
“Are you still going to see Blaise this weekend?” Hermione asked.
“Yes. Tried to slip away but it seemed like Finnegan refuses to take a no for an answer,” Draco said, half-annoyed, half-amused.
”It was a surprise it took
? A special quill? For fuck’s sake Potter, she’s hurting you seriously and you’re just fine with that? Merlin, save me from Gryffindors and their recklessness,” Malfoy whined. “There must be some really dark magic in that quill!”
“We could try if the door is open,” Harry said, worried. He wanted to make sure at least nothing bad had happened.
” he cried desperately and started to run blindly through the mist. “
They ate and drank in silence, only Narcissa’s occasional and quiet sniffling and cutlery clinking against the plates breaking the otherwise death-quiet atmosphere. Draco felt like he couldn’t think or speak; the only thing he could concentrate on was eating the cake, drinking the coffee, and waiting for the moment to be over. But time had seemed to slow down, and Draco felt like they had sat there for hours now, every minute feeling longer than the last.
“Mum,” Ron whined. “
Phew, now there's only the epilogue left, which I'm planning to try to post on  Wednesday or Thursday. I hope you've enjoyed the story so far, it's definitely been a lot of fun to write!
Slowly, Draco turned his gaze away from Harry and started to walk towards his father, who was now grinning triumphantly.
“Hello? Hello? Harry, can you hear me?” Draco yelled at him over the phone, making Harry jump a little.
“Oh, for Salazar’s sake, you two can’t be serious,” Zabini said, hitting his forehead with his palm dramatically.
“Do you miss all of that? I mean, the Manor and your parents?” Harry asked, noticing that the look on Draco’s face turned grim. “Sorry, you don’t have to answer to that,” he continued hastily, regretting his big mouth. It must be the Pepper-Up Potion that made Harry’s brain feel like cotton candy and made him ask and say so stupid things that morning.
“You should give him a chance, Ron,” Hermione said, pointing at Ron with her fork. “What has he even ever done to you?”
Harry was just about to mount his broom when he heard someone approaching him running.
“I’m going to get some more, got to get rid of the taste of tequila in my mouth. See you in a bit,” Harry said and started to make his way through the crowd towards the drinking table.
“Yes,” Draco whispered, a small smile starting to play on his teary face.
Harry turned his face towards the Slytherin table. He saw Malfoy poking absently at his food, while Parkinson and Zabini were talking excitedly, probably about the Gryffindor’s nightmarish Quidditch practise. Parkinson tried to get Malfoy’s attention by waving a hand in front of his face, but the git just stared and snapped something, looking annoyed. Harry thought it was strange since Malfoy had been quite obviously enjoying himself just a moment ago on the Quidditch pitch. The git’s mood seemed to change like day and night in a matter of minutes.
¡SPOILER ALERT! A book about Engelv’s own experiences about growing up and coming out in a Jehovah’s Witness family. Engelv’s experiences actually inspired Gardell to write the Jehovah’s Witness character who followed Engelv’s real-life experiences quite a lot.
“But that’s the case, I have. Already months ago,” Harry said.
Draco was silent for a while. “It’s none of your business,” he said, sounding much more uncertain now.
Ginny seemed to be one of the few people who didn’t tip-toe around Harry that year, and it made Harry feel warm inside. It was soothing to be treated as a normal person occasionally. Besides, he had really started loving Ginny in a whole new way when she, according to Hermione, had got over her childhood crush on Harry. Ginny had become much more relaxed, bubbling, and witty around Harry, and he was so happy for the chance to get to know these sides of her.
“He definitely knows how to make people like him,” Harry muttered, gritting his teeth. “So, how’s it going? Er, Hermione told you’re seeing Michael Corner.”
“It’s just dubious, is all” Harry muttered, shrugging, and blushing slightly.
Draco huffed. “Why didn’t you bring those pictures then?”
Ginny let out a sharp bark of laughter. “Hermione told me, would’ve loved to witness that. My dear, overprotecting brother,” Ginny said. “What about you? How’s it going with you and Cho?”
“Draco,” Lucius snapped, this time louder, but Draco didn’t move. He couldn’t. He felt frozen to the spot.
“Don’t be. I don’t want my past, my parents or what they did to me to be taboo topics,” Draco said sharply.
knew all of a sudden.
“Yeah, I know. And you don’t have to.”
“Yeah, he is. A house-elf, I mean.”
“Blaise wanted to see Harry once more before the holidays, so we thought we could just hang out outside for a bit,” Ginny said, eyes glinting mischievously, and Harry didn’t know whether or not to look forward to what Ginny and Blaise had in mind.
“Merlin, that’s so fucked up. I mean, now I kind of get why Severus tossed me into the Manor but –” Draco began, pensive, before he started to giggle all of a sudden. “Oh god, you remember when he caught us in that alcove near to his office? I won’t ever forget the look on his face, he looked like he was about to have a stroke.”
“I only guessed, about five minutes ago,” Hermione said, shrugging. “I saw how you started to squirm immediately when I told Malfoy’s been disowned. I figured out you knew more about his case than you’ve let us know.”
“Please, I don’t want to talk about that any more than necessary,” Harry said, talking over Draco. He still hated talking about him having been a Horcrux and other people having played him like a pawn.
Malfoy looked at Zabini, confused, but he relaxed a little. “Whatever for the Boy Who Lived,” Malfoy muttered, turning his gaze from Zabini to Harry.
“Harry.”
“Well, he probably heard you talking about turning him into a ferret, you weren’t talking exactly silently about that. Which, by the way, is a horrible way to threaten someone. Do you have any idea how scary it must be to be transformed into something without your own consent and having no control over your own body? No one deserves that kind of punishment, not even Malfoy. No wonder it’s a sore spot to him.”
“Seriously?” Harry asked, turning his eyes to Draco.
“What the hell are you doing on the floor?” Potter asked as Draco stood up clumsily.
“I still haven’t found anything new to stop the executions,” Hermione said, frustrated, and picking nervously her nails. “I think I’ve gone through almost all the juridical books in the Wizarding world I’ve found, and they all seem to have the same conclusion: the executions without trials are always illegal except for when there’s some sort of state of emergency in the society.”
Draco turned his face towards Potter and locked his gaze with Potter's bright eyes. “Salazar, Potter, how many times do I have to say this to you? I’m not going anywhere.”
“Enough of seriousness, I want to hear you laugh,” Harry said, turning around so that his arms were on both sides of Draco.
“Harry, calm down,” Draco said softly, starting to rub Harry’s lower back soothingly. “Why are you here, mother?”
“Why do you even care Malfoy?” Harry cried out defensively.
“Well, my stuttering isn’t really anything new, so I think everybody came prepared,” Harry said, grinning. “Though that Smith, or whatever his name was, didn’t seem that eager. I don’t even know why he bothered to come. Could have just asked me about Voldemort and Cedric at school,” Harry said, his voice turning a bit grumpy.
“I never knew him, but from what I’ve heard I do agree with Ginny. He even let me and Harry meet each other a couple of times as babies,” Draco said.
Harry and Ginny were sitting on armchairs in the packed living room at the Burrow, where Harry had arrived already a few weeks ago. The whole house seemed to be full of life as along with the permanent inhabitants there were now also Harry, Hermione, Bill and Fleur, and even Lupin had wanted to pay a visit that day to celebrate Harry’s birthday. Although this year it was a rather gloomy day as there seemed to be more and more bad news about disappearances and deaths every day, all probably caused by the Death Eaters.
“Don’t you dare to make fun of me,” Draco said, smacking Harry hard with a pillow.
Malfoy didn’t move an inch, and he was still breathing warmly against Harry’s ear. “Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get what I mean,” Malfoy said and started to back away, sneering.
“Oh, grow up. As if anyone cared about what I do here as long as I’m out of the way. Besides, I’ll be gone soon enough anyway,” Harry said.
“It’s alright. Didn’t mind the cold that much, so I came back in quite quickly.”
Malfoy’s tongue explored Harry’s mouth as he was kissing Harry hungrily. It took a while for Harry to be able to answer the kiss, but once he did it, he noticed he was instinctively kissing Malfoy at least as eagerly as Malfoy was kissing him. As their tongues entwined, Harry could distinguish different kind of flavours Malfoy tasted like. Apples and cinnamon and alcohol. Maybe he had had some other wine before this?
When Harry arrived at the Room, Draco wasn’t there yet. Harry stepped slowly around the Room, taking in all the small details from the light-grey-coloured curtains to the exact number of the pillows on the bed he had almost forgotten during the holidays. It was odd how a few weeks could feel like a lifetime, as if the last time Harry and Draco had been in the Room was months ago instead of weeks. So much had happened, so it felt a relief to notice that at least the Room had stayed comfortably the same.
used to Ron’s snoring after all the shared years in the same dormitory, and even though it was sometimes quite nerve-wracking, Harry had noticed it had started to make him feel somehow warm and safe at some point. Like there were some things in the world that never changed.
Harry sighed heavily. It was one of these days then. Again. During the lesson, Harry tried continuously to make Draco speak to him by talking to him and asking questions, but all he said seemed to fall on deaf ears. Draco didn’t speak nor react. Actually, he didn’t even seem to realize where he was, what he was supposed to do and what was happening around him. The more time passed, the more anxious Harry felt. He wanted to grab Draco’s collar and shake him hard; to
“Erm, things might’ve escalated a bit. I think I might’ve kissed him,” Harry mumbled as he felt himself blushing furiously.
,” Harry spluttered, his face turning violently crimson now.
“If you had told me two years ago I’d be celebrating Christmas with the Weasleys and I’d
“Er, so, Strengthening Solution. You’ve done this one before?” Malfoy asked, stumbling awkwardly over his words.
The whispering in the middle of the night when they both had been too tired to speak out loud but still didn’t want to waste their time together sleeping.
“Is it? Does it really differ that much from the pureblood ideas?”
“That sounds reasonable,” Harry said, thinking about Hermione’s words. It very well did sound a lot like everything he already knew about the pureblood culture.
“It’s so good to see you both. You should’ve told me the eight-years don’t have to stay at Hogwarts during the weekends, you could’ve come for a visit so much earlier,” Molly said, letting go of the boys.
Seeing Harry now on a daily basis was even worse. He ignored Draco just like his old friends, avoiding Draco’s gaze and sitting as far as possible from him in the classrooms, at the eight-year table at the Great Hall, in the library, and even in the eight-year common room. If everything had been alright between them, Draco would have been thrilled as they now had the chance to see each other much more than during their fifth and sixth year as they now shared the same common room and all. Now, though, it felt more like a nightmare. During the seventh year it had felt somewhat easier to deal with the guilt considering Harry as Harry hadn’t been present at school, and, besides, the War had taken control over Draco’s mind practically completely. Now seeing Harry several times a day was like some sort of torture as Draco was constantly reminded of what there had been between them and what there still could be if Draco hadn’t fucked up everything.
If Snape had so clearly zero respect for Harry, why should Harry respect him then? Couldn’t he just grab his bag and leave?
During the first days back at school, Harry tried to ignore Draco as much as possible. Which was quite a challenge as Draco kept on trying to make eye contact with Harry and following him in order to make him listen to him. Once Draco had almost managed to catch Harry but, to Harry’s luck, Hermione had just happened to appear from around the corner. She had eyed both Harry and Draco suspiciously, as if scaring them to jump at each other’s throats abruptly, until Draco had had to turn around and leave. After that Harry had made sure he never walked alone anywhere as there was no chance Draco would approach him whenever he was with his Gryffindor friends.
“I said just Viking, without any attributes,” Harry muttered under his breath.
He forced himself to open his eyes once more and looked at the concerned, frowned expression on Potter’s face before letting go and sinking into the sweet unconsciousness.
“Good luck, mate. The lessons can’t go on forever,” Ron said, attempting to give Harry an encouraging smile.
The first days back at school were filled with hurry. All the professors seemed to think the Christmas holidays had only been a waste of time and the students would better make up for their leisure time by using at least twice as much time on homework than before the holidays. Having to fit the DA lessons and Occlumency with Snape made Harry’s first week at school a horror timewise.
“Yes. She had always thought we’d become a couple someday, so she took it quite hard when I wanted to stop dating so soon and without any explanation.”
“And you don’t have feelings for her, either?”
a self-centred fool.
“Why not? I like flying.”
Harry handed the bottle back to Malfoy, and it was then when he actually realized what he was doing. He was drinking with Draco Malfoy. And not only casually drinking, he was getting
“You hadn’t,” Harry said, closing his eyes as he felt Draco’s finger tracing his face. “May I kiss you now?”
“So, you feel scared?” Molly asked.
“Could you show yourself, please?” Harry asked, feeling anxious as he still tried to grope the spot where he believed the voice came from, but every time his fingers just ran through the mist.
“He wasn’t fussing about
Ginny flushed slightly. “Yeah, we got together at the end of last year.”
“That’s not the point, I’m very well aware of what I did and did not at school, thank you ever so much. I was asking about
“Potter, you’re late,” Snape drawled as Harry entered his office and closed the door behind himself.
in the company of Draco Malfoy. Harry had to smack his cheeks to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. It didn’t make Malfoy disappear, so he probably was awake. Or hallucinating. Did vodka make people hallucinate?
“The one who was the main reason for Draco to come out of the closet to his parents?” Anne went on.
“You wouldn’t get it.”
"Out with it, there's clearly something you're not telling us. Draco wouldn't be upset about something as innocent as fetching firewhisky," Blaise said, looking like he tried to see through Harry.
When Valentine’s Day came, Harry felt extremely nervous. He said his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, who were sure Harry and Ginny were up to something because ‘no one in their right minds would skip a trip to Hogsmeade’. Harry explained he had no desire to meet Cho there meanwhile Ginny told them she felt still too heartbroken after her and Michael’s breakup. Hermione and Ron remained still clearly suspicious, but they left eventually after their short and seemingly dissatisfying interrogation.
“Well, yeah, we became somewhat closer during the autumn.”
“No,” Harry said coolly. “If you had something to say, you can say it here.”
It wasn’t a success. As soon as Draco freed one of Harry’s hands for a split-second, Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him into a heated kiss.

life and
Ron snapped his head up to look at his friend animatedly. It was stupid really how Harry hadn’t thought how easy it would be to cheer Ron up by making a simple phrase with the words
Maybe it wasn’t too late yet, maybe he could just turn to his side and dive back into the dream. None of his dreams had been particularly pleasant in recent years, or… well. Frankly said all of them had been just nightmares one after another, but maybe he would this time be able to see one that would be at least slightly more… tolerable. It wasn’t much to ask. Actually, he asked for nothing else but that there wouldn’t be Azkaban in his dream in any form. Maybe he could see one of his wartime dreams as they had already started to feel so familiar to him. Almost even safe and reliable, as if an old friend had just popped up to greet him. Not that Draco would have particularly enjoyed the wartime dreams but despite all the fear, agony, and despair, every single one of them was multiple times better than his current reality. In those dreams, he was still with his family. He was still at home.
“Some days I question myself and my decisions a lot and want to go back to my parents, even though I’m rather sure it wouldn’t be good for me,” Draco said grimly. “But I’m not sure. I don’t know, maybe I would be happy, following my parents’ expectations. Eventually. Or happier than now. I don’t know.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, looking at his shoes again.
“Why wouldn’t it be okay?” Harry asked, sounding genuinely confused.
Draco didn’t say anything, he just nodded.
Suddenly, Harry’s door creaked open, and Dudley peeked into the room.
When they reached the shoulder-level, Harry stopped abruptly, and without a warning he crouched, disappearing completely under the surface for a few seconds.
“Almost a whole week,” Harry said as his hands found to Draco’s hair. “Look, I wanted to ask you if you’d like to see me in the evening.”
When Draco came to the kitchen, he began hastily to open the kitchen drawers. He needed something, something sharp enough. Anything would do at this point.
“Harry?” Draco answered, turning quickly around and sitting up as he heard Harry calling him. His eyes were slightly red, and he had dark circles under his eyes. It looked like he hadn’t slept at all last night.
“So can our broomsticks.”
“Very well,” Snape drawled. “Potter, stay here, we shall return to your lesson as soon as I’m back.”
The more time passed, the more Harry found himself studying the Slytherin. When Draco had come back to Hogwarts, he had seemed to be like a ghost compared to the Draco who Harry had known during their fifth and sixth year, and not only because of his scrawny appearance. Draco had definitely been anxious, sad, and distant during their sixth year, but at the beginning of their eighth year, he had been just like a shadow, always looming in the corners and staring at his feet. As if he had tried to be invisible or just wanted the earth to swallow him up.
“Why can’t you be more than that?” Ron asked. “I’ve already gotten used to the thought of you shagging the ferret,” he said, turning crimson. “Or maybe not quite just yet. But it’s not like any of your friends would really have a problem with that. Or would have a say in that, to begin with.”
Both Harry and Draco had had quite a long break from playing the Quidditch, but to Harry, it felt almost as if the last time he had played towards the Slytherin had been rather weeks than years ago. Draco played still well as he flew smoothly all around the pitch and made controlling his broom look like child’s play. But the most striking thing was probably the effort Draco was ready to put in the game. He was making some risky moves, his face was wrinkled in concentration, and his eyes were flaming with eagerness. He had definitely taken seriously his promise to beat Harry this time.
Probably, Harry couldn’t. To be fair, he had been all too occupied to fight Voldemort in one way or another almost every single year during his adolescence, so he didn’t have the slightest idea of how it was to be a normal, teenaged boy, getting wasted on a house party.
“Harry, you can’t do like that!” Ginny said sharply. “Do you have any idea how Draco is feeling right now?”
“So, he was your godfather?” Blaise asked.
“Well –.”
“Been there a few times now,” Draco said, shrugging.
“I don’t think I can go any further,” Draco said, voice shaking a bit.

“You can’t be snogging each other and be all lovey-dovey and
. But I guess we could give it a go,” Malfoy, or, well,
“I mean it. Well, maybe I can admit he’s not as bad as I used to think,” Ginny said, smiling at Harry. “But, I’m sure he genuinely cares about you and doesn’t want to harm you, and that’s all that matters to me. I honestly don’t think he could ever hurt you.”
The day was bright and sunny, and there wasn’t yet a hint of the upcoming autumn in the air. Harry closed his eyes for a moment and enjoyed the feeling of the sun kissing his face.
“Would you just shut it already,” Potter snapped as he helped Draco to sit down on the edge of the bathtub.
Harry squirmed uncomfortably. “Erm, the conversations I had had with you might have affected my opinions a bit. Ron had told me most of the dark wizards come from Slytherin, and your comments about right and wrong sorts and blood didn’t really impress me too much.”
No missed calls. No new messages.
“Hey, erm, Blaise,” Harry began, trying to call Zabini with his first name. Maybe he’d stop calling him the Golden Boy in return. “I’ve got something for you, too,” Harry said and dug up a huge package of Chocolate Frogs from behind a sofa cushion.
“Now I’ve seen it all, the Chosen One sticking his tongue out and running after snowflakes like a 5-year-old,” Draco said, wiping the tears off his face.
Draco looked at Harry, dumbfounded. “And you didn’t tell her off?”
Slowly, the worst peak of anxiety started to fade, leaving behind a heavy feeling of grief and exhaustion. Harry was so tired he couldn’t even find himself feeling angry anymore.
“You are
“A Horcrux?” Draco asked, lifting his eyebrow questioningly as he took the bottle from Harry again.
nice and familiar and easy as Harry’s mind filled now with images of him kissing Draco. Merlin, what had he done? Harry could remember clearly how soft and warm Draco's lips had been, and how good it had felt to touch Draco and to feel his body against his own after such a long time. He had somehow felt so complete, as if he had lost a piece of himself one and a half years ago and had last night finally gotten it back.
“I think he was a bit bitter, but he’ll get over it,” Ginny said simply. “So, are you already looking forward to going back to Hogwarts?”
As weeks passed by, Harry and Draco had managed to make it a routine to meet in the Room of Requirement a couple of times a week. Sometimes Blaise joined them, which Harry really liked. Although he didn’t know if Blaise was there because he enjoyed Harry and Draco’s company or rather because of the mobile phones, which, to Harry’s delight, seemed to be a success. Draco learned to use his phone surprisingly quickly, and soon he was much faster to write messages than a bit clumsy-fingered Harry. Both Draco and Blaise complained a lot about the keypad, and Harry had to agree with them; it didn’t make any sense one had to push a key three separate times to write the letter C or the letter V. However, the overall experience was still definitely positive, and Draco was so excited about the ringtones he was about to drive Harry crazy by listening to them over and over again.
,” Harry mouthed to Ginny, and she gave him a small smile and nodded encouragingly.
“Is there anything Blaise
Back in the castle, in their own room in the Room of Requirement, they nestled under the covers, clung tightly to each other, and let themselves drift off to sleep.
This chapter seems a lot like fluff without plot, but I promise there really is a plot somewhere underneath there :D
“Harry,” Harry said, shaking Chris’s hand and looking at him curiously. Chris was probably a few years older than he and Draco, and his warm, brown eyes and the gentle smile on his lips radiated so much benevolence Harry could now understand how Chris buying drinks to Draco could’ve been seen purely as friendliness. “I’ve heard about you,” he blurted out.
“It might be better if we split. I haven’t been in the dungeons yet as it’s not very likely they’re somewhere there, but I don’t know where else to look anymore. If you go there and I check the area around the kitchens?”
Draco sighed, disappointed. “There’s no need to, but thanks. I’ve already gone through the whole castle,” he said, standing up and starting to turn around, but Dobby grabbed his arm abruptly.
“I don’t know if I should take that as a compliment or not,” Draco muttered, acting annoyed but sounding quite pleased instead. “So, what would you like to have? We have turkey, cheese and salmon sandwiches.”
“This is madness, Harry, you’ve gone completely mental,” Draco said, teeth clattering.
“Don’t be stupid!” Snape cried. “A few sweet little moments with Potter can’t be worth dying for.”
“Of course we were. We, or, well, you especially, didn’t have a choice, either. I can honestly say I don’t know what I would’ve done in Malfoy’s position,” Hermione said.
Harry could wait no more with all the pent-up tension he had felt for the holidays and the first week at school. He did what he had wanted to do the whole week: he stalked determinedly across the Room, grabbed Draco’s tie, yanked him closer and crashed their lips together for a long, heated kiss.
Abruptly someone gripped Draco's trembling shoulder. "Draco, look at me,” Blaise said calmly but firmly, obliging Draco's eyes to his.
“Er, do you know anything about smileys?”
“No.”
“But you kind of left them.”
“Oh shit, your mother,” Draco said, looking a little embarrassed. “I was rather rude to her, weren’t I?”
“Draco, please,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and interlacing their fingers together, and this time Draco didn’t jerk his hand away.
After that, Anne stopped interrogating Harry, which made him relax quite a lot. The conversation flowed mostly from everyone’s Christmas plans to the group’s other nights out and who had done and what then. Harry’s favourite part was probably the stories about Draco’s first experiences with different kind of Muggle stuff, and Harry couldn’t stop laughing when Anne and Olivia told him how Draco had been so startled by the automatic doors in a supermarket he had almost fallen and cried out for Merlin, God and Jesus, all of them in the same sentence.
Ginny started to look a bit grim. She was definitely not content with how their side had handled things after the War, suspecting basically everyone who had as much as been at the same social gathering with a Death Eater
“What do you want?” Harry snapped, wrapping both of his arms tightly around Draco, as if he was afraid that Narcissa would just snatch Draco’s hand and make him leave with her.
“Are you sure they won’t be able to see us?” he asked quietly.
“Yes,” Blaise said, nodding encouragingly.
I get it why you always suddenly get so quiet when we start talking about girls.”
Ginny took the ring with the necklace, wrapped it around Harry’s neck and closed the clasp.
“This must be the time of my life, I’ve never gotten this much attention before,” Blaise said, pensive. “Don’t worry, Mad-Eye’s not working here anymore and no one else has the ability to see where your hands are wandering under the table.
There were some advantages of being a wizard as after a sleepless night one didn’t have to survive only with the help of coffee. As soon as Harry had made it to the breakfast table, yawning and almost unable to keep his eyes open, Molly had fetched a bottle of Pepper-Up Potion from the kitchen drawers and given it to Harry.
“Hey,” Harry said, taking Draco’s face between his hands and making him look Harry in the eye. “You’ve never been his and you’ll never be, Mark or not. You are your own unit in this utterly messed up universe. And no matter how and where this is going, I’ll stand by you, okay?”
“And you knew about Hagrid as well?”
As soon as Harry had found a small, hidden alcove, he pulled out the Marauder’s Map. He scanned the Map for a moment before finding Malfoy’s small, labelled dot walking on the courtyard towards the castle alongside another dot, labelled Zabini. Harry put the Map back into his pocket and hastened downstairs.
,” Potter muttered with gritted teeth. “
“It’s just… Draco told me something in Norwegian, something he didn’t want to say in English. Something ‘elsker’ or something.”
“I meant what I said when I told you I can’t be gay,” Malfoy said, breaking the silence.
Draco’s proposition to stay over the night had apparently been a rather spontaneous one as he didn’t seem to have pyjamas with him either. He eyed timidly what Harry was doing, and after seeing what Harry had decided to wear, he, too, seemed to settle for his pants and a t-shirt.
“You know he’s wrong, right?”
“That’s exactly what I've been trying to tell you. I want all of you, every day and every hour of the day, not just when you’re feeling happy and stronger.”
“That Zabini bloke doesn’t seem to be too bad for a Slytherin,” Ron said grudgingly. He had slowly started to see Blaise in a better light, although he still didn’t want to meet him face to face.
“Don’t say you’re sorry. I was mad at you for insulting me about not having a mother. You didn’t ban me from playing Quidditch, it was Umbridge. Besides, she’d have done it anyway, our fight was just a good excuse for her,” Harry said, shrugging. It felt odd to hear Draco apologizing. Draco had never apologized to him before, and now he had done it maybe three or four times during one single conversation.
, which made them both feel uneasy. Harry wished he was alone in the compartment with only Ron and Hermione, so they would’ve been able to discuss if that could mean Malfoy had a hunch about Sirius.
Harry gulped, feeling suddenly horrified. “Didn’t you hear what happened to Dobby?” he asked, and Draco shook his head. “Bellatrix’s knife wounded Dobby when he helped us to Disapparate from the Manor. He didn’t survive.”
“Yeah, but I hadn’t really thought about that. I mean, when you told me I still thought you were seeing some nice Hufflepuff bloke.”
After the War it had felt like Harry could spend time with other people only in small doses. He loved his friends and the Weasleys with all his heart but sometimes constant discussion about the War felt too much. When the War had ended, Harry had thought he could finally rest and start to think about more ordinary and shallow things again, but the War was still as present as it had been two months ago in every conversation, in every decision, in every expression and gesture, and in every dream.
“Right,” Draco said, sounding suspicious. “So, bye then, Harry.”
“Oh, no. I’d rather keep my feet on the ground,” Blaise said.
“Harry and the –” Draco began, but Snape cut him short.
“Oh god, Draco,” Harry moaned, dragging the blonde nearer to him and tilting his head to give Draco better access.
“What is it about then, Draco? Love? Don’t be ridiculous, you’re just an adolescent in the middle of a hormone storm. You know nothing about love,” Snape said coldly. “You were never meant to be together, but neither you nor Potter seem to get it into your thick skulls.”
“Why did I come here?” Harry asked, turning his gaze to Draco.
Hermione threw the Prophet on the table so that Harry, Molly and Ron could see it. “Malfoy’s been disowned,” she said bluntly.
“I don’t know, really. You’re not exactly the easiest person to read.”
Harry was quiet for a long while, worry for Draco and the whole situation occupying his mind.
“No. But I want to concentrate on what we’re having now,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “You must believe me when I say I’d never fight against you.”
“That’s okay,” Harry said softly. And it was okay, at least for the moment. “Come here.”
“I dunno, that just seems like a really beautiful idea somehow,” Harry said. “I had thought you ordered some expensive luxury shampoo from Southern France or something.”
The dream had felt somehow heartrendingly real, as if Harry and Malfoy had really been in the same place at the same time even though Harry hadn’t been able to see the other boy. The feeling had been rather different from the dreams he usually saw, and it had actually reminded him quite a lot of the dreams where Voldemort had been inside his head or he inside Voldemort’s; they were somehow richer in senses, and many of them had happened for real or at least had felt vividly like it.
“Harry,” Draco said in a strained voice as Harry came to sit by the table next to him.
“You found what?” Draco asked as they walked slowly to the same direction Potter had just come from.
Draco felt his body starting to tremble slightly. “Merlin, Harry. You’ve got no idea how happy you’re making me feel right now,” he whispered, drawing his finger first along Harry’s eyebrows, then his nose, and finally his lips. “I thought I had lost you forever.”
As Christmas drew closer, both Harry and Draco became a bit nervous about leaving Hogwarts. Or, well. Maybe it was only Harry. Draco kept on telling him how Voldemort wouldn’t even notice Draco’s existence at the Manor as Voldemort definitely wasn’t interested in recruiting underage wizards. Besides, no one knew for sure if Voldemort would even be there. Still, solely the slight possibility of Draco being in the very same building where Voldemort might be strolling around gave Harry the shivers.
Draco looked at Harry, utterly confused. “That’s absurd.”
“You’ve smuggled firewhisky into school? Wouldn’t have believed of you,” Draco said, raising his eyebrow.
The beginning of autumn provided with a bit of mundaneness and regularity in Harry’s life that Harry had longed for the whole, stressful summer. As a silent agreement, he and Draco had started to wholly ignore Draco’s Dark Mark after they had discussed it, which probably wasn’t wise as it created a false sense of normalcy to both of them. Even though Harry had heard hundreds and hundreds of times lying to oneself was never a good idea in the long run, he couldn’t help but enjoy it nevertheless. He felt as though everything between him and Draco was just like the last school year before June, still war-free and Voldemort-free. He even tried to tell himself that maybe it really could be that way if he only believed in it hard enough.
“So, erm, I’ll just let you rest now,” Potter said. This time Draco didn’t bother to answer in any way, instead he just waited patiently until he heard the door close after the other boy.
Hermione regarded Harry, confused. “What do you mean by ‘pureblood stuff’?”
“Merlin, Potter, you’re unbelievable,” Draco said, giggling un-Malfoyishly. “So, do you want your Christmas gift or not?”
“Did I do something wrong? Didn’t he like it?” Molly asked, looking worried.
“It’s nothing, really,” Harry said, a bit embarrassed as he tried to pull his hand away, but Malfoy just held his hand even tighter.
“Yes,” Harry said, looking sad. “But she can’t ban it for the rest of my life. Probably for this year, yeah, but not after that.”
“Shouldn’t it be quite obvious? People who’re sentenced to death are not exactly priority number one in places like this,” Draco hissed.
Harry nodded, dug the picture from his pocket and handed it over to Ginny. Both she and Blaise studied the picture curiously.
“I know, I know. Sorry Draco,” Anne said, giving Draco a small, apologetic smile. “But you’ve also gone to that same, odd boarding school as Draco, right? The one where people live like in the Middle Ages?” she continued, turning her eyes back to Harry.
“And here I was hoping to have one normal school year with less Malfoy lurking behind the corners. But no, it just has to get worse every year,” Harry whined, remembering the Slytherin’s ways to get under Harry’s skin in the past. Harry had already a lot in his mind, so he didn’t really need Malfoy to occupy any more of his time and energy than usually.
“A support group for the victims of religions, for instance.”
All the times they had studied each other’s bodies, wanting nothing more than to know how to make each other gasp and moan and writhe in pleasure. How to be as close to one another as humanly possible.
“No, Ron, this is not a joke,” Hermione said calmly.
, but also everyone else who had fought on the Dark Lord’s side. But
Harry felt so stupid. If he had listened to Draco’s warnings, all this wouldn’t have happened at all. It was practically his own fault Dumbledore had had to leave. And what was there now to do with Dumbledore gone? Harry’s friends kept on telling him their actions had been only for a good cause, but what were they worth when they just had made their side, the Order’s side, weaker? And, what was more, Harry now had to stand seeing Umbridge and her stupidly smug face, being so proud of having made Dumbledore leave, breaking finally DA and taking Dumbledore’s position as the new headmistress.
The gift consisted again of three separate pieces and a letter. Harry took them in his hands one by one, and he noticed there seemed to be the same chocolate pralines as on Christmas, handmade soap and a small jewellery box. The box caught Harry’s interest, so he opened it and found a huge, ancient-looking silver ring on a necklace inside.
“Yes, I’ve got Occlumency with Snape,” Harry said, groaning. He had already come to the conclusion he’d rather fight with a Basilisk or two than endure one more Occlumency session alone with Snape.
Until now he had trusted blindly that Voldemort wouldn’t get to know about them, but now that he thought about it, there were no guarantees. It was only pure luck Voldemort hadn’t seen a glimpse of Draco in Harry’s mind.
“I just think Snape might have a point,” Harry said, not wanting to meet Draco’s eyes.
“Of course I do.”
“I’m just happy it’s impossible to fly to the Moon with our broomsticks,” Draco muttered. “Didn’t you ever want to fly that plane thing?”
“Could get used to this kind of morning greetings, though.”
“You can’t just abandon him and suddenly make him come back into your life when it suits you,” Harry seethed.
“And what do you mean by that?”
Harry felt Draco getting tensed immediately. “What do you mean by accidentally?” he asked, a pained look in his eyes.
“You two look adorable,” Ginny said, smiling.
"Draco, darling, I've been ready for ages, so if you could ever so kindly stop admiring yourself in the mirror already. You've dreamed of seeing Potter humiliating himself for months and you know this is a once in a lifetime chance you don't want to miss!" Pansy, Draco's date to the Ball, snarled impatiently behind the door to the boys' dormitory snapping Draco back to reality.
“So it was him! Tell me, how did you –” Dudley started saying gleefully but stopped abruptly. He had gotten suddenly a scared look on his face as he had noticed Harry had pulled his wand from under the pillow.
“At the Manor, under house arrest.”
if the person in question knew that Slughorn held some really important information and wanted to get rid of him before he had time to reveal what he knew.
“Merlin, that was deep,” Ron muttered. “How’s ferret blending in with Muggles?”
“I’m not obliged to go to all of them,” Harry said, talking over her.
“Oh, well. Frankly, there must’ve been something more to it. I think he was actually most likely trying to seduce you. A
Dere er alle litt dumme i hodet = You're all a bit stupid
“It’s okay,” Hermione said, putting her hand reassuringly on Harry’s arm as she apparently noticed Harry’s discomfort. “Do you want to tell me who you’re talking about?”
“I don’t expect you to say anything, I just want you to listen to what I have to say,” Zabini said calmly. “I’m quite sure I’ve known about Draco’s proclivities before he even admitted them to himself. I’ve known him practically for my whole life, and he isn’t too hard to read if you know him well. And if I’ve gathered right, there has been something going on between the two of you this autumn?”
“Ah, so, you have both said your farewells? Shall we go now?” Lucius asked, putting his arm tightly around Draco’s shoulder. “It was a pleasure, Mr. Potter,” he continued smugly, starting to steer Draco out of the room.
Right, Draco wasn’t here for studying house-elves’ fascinating ways of living. He was here to find Harry. His eyes scanned the room carefully, but after a while, he had to admit he seemed to be the only human being in that room.
“Hard to imagine me and Malfoy ever having got on that well,” Harry muttered. He felt like he really wanted to tell Sirius that he and Draco actually got on rather well now, but he didn’t want to do that without having asked Draco first.
Though it had never really been just Potter's appearance that drove Draco mad, and it made things so much more difficult. Some lust based on one's appearance would probably just come and go without pain, but Draco's feelings had been something deeper right from the beginning. To begin with, he had always envied Potter's close friendship with Weasel and Mudblood. Not that Draco wanted to be Weasel and Mudblood's friend, he envied just their relationship as such. Everybody could see how close they were to each other, how they trusted each other and how they stood for each other, no matter what. Potter was utterly, and quite often even stupidly, selfless and loyal to those people he truly cared for. Despite his erratic background being obliviously Wizarding World's number one hero grown up by muggles, Potter was always so benevolent, brave and he just seemed to know how to do the right thing. Or maybe it all was rather thanks to his background. A background that was really different from the one Draco had.
Draco.
“Stop harassing my seeker,” Ginny cried and threw the quaffle towards Harry all of a sudden.
They laid there for a while, waiting for their breathing to become even. Malfoy’s hair was tickling Harry’s nose, and he could hear the birds singing again and feel the cool, moist grass under him.
“So it’s all about you then, is that what you’re saying? You have a long habit of keeping big, dirty secrets from your friends? What do you think they’re going to like when they get to know you’ve been hiding something like this from them?” Draco knew he was now just asking for a punch on his face but it simply felt all too easy and familiar to try to irritate Potter.
Speaking with Ginny and Hermione had helped somewhat. However, Ginny was the one with the experience of being possessed by Voldemort, so she definitely knew what she was talking about. Harry’s dream hadn’t reminded Ginny’s experiences during her first year at Hogwarts at all as he didn’t have memory gaps nor found himself abruptly in some peculiar place. He was rather sure he had been in his dormitory for the whole time when Arthur had been attacked, so there really was no way Harry would be the culprit. But if he wasn’t possessed, what had happened to him then? He was pretty certain his dream wouldn’t be considered a normal one, not even in the Wizarding world.
Draco shrugged. “It’s gone much better than in all my scenarios,” he said and leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“I think ’Mione is right,” Ron said tentatively. “Malfoy
Some parts of the dialogue are taken directly/only a little modified from the Order of the Phoenix. The same goes with some of the following chapters as well.
“Busy with the Order?”
“I’ll explain to you later. Let’s eat something? Dobby fixed us a picnic basket again,” Harry said, opening the basket.
Once Blaise had left, the nights were only for Harry and Draco. The Room filled with gasps and moans and pleas as the two boys studied each other’s bodies and different ways to give pleasure to one another. Harry felt always dizzy afterwards, cuddled up with Draco, both whispering words such as
Harry couldn’t resist the temptation as he suddenly put his hands on Draco’s waist and squeezed gently.
“Yeah.”
“Electricity,” Harry corrected Draco, the corner of his mouth tugging.
A cold and disbelieving gaze of Severus Snape pierced both Harry and Draco as Snape had abruptly appeared right in front of them. Harry had never seen him so murderous looking, he looked like he’d love nothing more than to avadakedavra Harry right on the spot.
“I’ll try my best,” Harry said. “Though I guess it’ll be he who’s going to have to take care of me and not the other way around,” he went on, muttering and making Draco snort of laughter.
“No,” Harry managed to say hastily, but his face turning to crimson exposed him.
“We’ve to come up with some other place to meet, Potter. Preferably somewhere warm,” Malfoy said, teeth chattering slightly.
“No, I’m sure he likes it,” Harry said. “Could you hold Teddy for a while? I’ll see that he’s doing alright,” he continued, giving Teddy to Molly and following Draco to the kitchen.
“Alright,” Blaise said, trying to stay calm. “Alright. So, where have you already been searching for them?”
“So, what do you want to do in Hogsmeade on Saturday?” Hermione asked, trying to change the subject.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked with a slightly high-pitched voice.
Harry sighed heavily, put his head back on the pillow, and closed his eyes.
“It’s not about… There’s much more than that, I –” Draco began but Snape cut him off.
“Definitely. I’ve seen girls doing that all the time,” Harry said, smiling and closing his eyes.
Potter turned his gaze to the sky as well. “They’re searching too high up. It’s too foggy and cloudy, they can’t see clearly what’s happening down here.”
“Look,” Draco said, staring at the sky.
Harry flinched a bit, feeling the bitterness taking over his mind. Oh, yes, he had wondered it and even wanted it so much he had once felt it in every fibre of his being.
“Well, then, it’s less than two months until you’ll be able to see each other more regularly again.”
“Would you like to sit and wait in the living room? I could make some tea,” Draco asked, his eyes settling on his feet.
“Say what again?”
“Malfoy,” Harry whimpered, bucking his hips up to create more friction, but Malfoy took his hand away.
Their lips met, brushing tentatively against each other, and Harry knew he had lost himself again. Malfoy opened his mouth a little, and Harry slipped his tongue into Malfoy’s mouth, gently touching the other boy’s tongue. The kiss was slow and tender, both wanting to taste each other and learn how the other one felt like. Malfoy threw his arm around Harry’s waist and pulled Harry flush against himself, meanwhile Harry put his hand cautiously under Malfoy’s shirt, feeling Malfoy’s beating heart and lean, warm chest.
The War had definitely increased Harry’s fascination with the other boy, as the earlier spoiled and prejudiced school ground bully had turned out to have some sort of own brain after all. But the interest in him had clearly longer roots, and Harry couldn’t even name the starting point.
“What I said. The Dark Lord decided it was a good idea to hang out at the Manor for a couple of days and bring a few friends along.”
?” Draco exclaimed, looking horrified.
“You don’t think my mother would want me back?”
“I’ve only kissed Pansy and you,” Malfoy said, and Harry felt a small stab of jealousy.
“I can make us more tea,” Draco said hoarsely as he bolted upright from the couch, seized his and Harry’s cups and rushed to the kitchen.
Draco pulled a little away from Harry and took a small, square-shaped present from his robe pocket. The present was neatly wrapped in a shimmering, dark-green wrapping paper with a silvery ribbon and bow.
” the voice continued, and now Harry felt someone shaking him lightly by his shoulders as he was still running in the greyness.
“I don’t know. It’s not like I would’ve gone a lot around asking people what they think about same-sex couples,” Harry muttered, shrugging.
“Draco. Mr. Potter,” Narcissa said politely. “May I come in?”
“So, is there someone you fancy?” Hermione asked, with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
“Why did you tell him? Why did you tell my father?” Draco asked, his voice being barely audible.
“Yeah, though I don’t fancy seeing Umbridge again on a daily basis.”
them some nonspecific day in future. He had fought a war, for Merlin’s sake, he could go through this. At least he thought so.
In Harry’s case, the worry for Draco was as present as ever, but in addition to that Dumbledore’s lessons had started to weigh Harry every time a little more. The more he learned about Voldemort, or rather Tom Riddle, the more responsibility he started to feel. Suddenly it had started to clear up to him how it really had to be him who was supposed to destroy Voldemort in the end and what all that practically meant. Being able to talk about Dumbledore’s lessons with Ron and Hermione helped a bit, but it didn’t remove the feeling of the whole Wizarding World having huge expectations of him. He felt still like a normal schoolboy, who wasn’t even particularly good at any subject. Well, maybe at Defence, but that was it.
Harry watched as Malfoy held Harry’s hand with one hand and cleaned his small wound carefully with the other. Harry couldn’t make himself breathe, Malfoy was so gentle with his procedures and his fingers tingled on Harry’s skin as if there was some kind of magic flowing between them.
“You miss them, don’t you?”
“God, no Gin. I don’t know, something like snowflakes, maybe.”
In fact, during the long winter months, Draco felt as if he was settling down and resting alongside nature. Not that he would have been calmer or quieter at school, he had his social status and a high position in the hierarchy to hold on tooth and nail. But if and when Draco felt too restless, he could always seek some peace of mind by going out for a walk. Just like at that very moment.
“Do you have enough people to talk to?” Sirius asked, interrupting Harry’s train of thought.
Draco’s eyes widened in amaze. “I fucking knew it! Merlin, this explains so much. How could I be so innocent and even consider you’d be sneaking around like a normal citizen.”
After a moment that had felt like an eternity, Harry finally reached the entrance to the common room and stepped in.
“You know, I think we should finish with the packing,” Harry said, his hands starting to roam on Draco’s body of their own accord.
end hatred with hatred,” Hermione said. “I promise I’ll go and try to talk to both Kingsley and the Wizengamot tomorrow and present them some case examples of earlier Wizarding and Muggle wars. They have to start to listen to reason at some point.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh?”
“You haven’t shaved. Your stubble is frozen,” Draco said, taking off his mitten and touching gently Harry’s chin with his fingers. “It glistens.”
“Don’t bother, Draco,” Lucius said, speaking over Draco and raising his hand to quieten him. “I already know all about your proclivities and your illicit, little romance. Did you really think you could hide this from us?”
“What do you mean by saying that your parents are dead?” Potter asked, taking cautiously a couple of steps towards Draco again. “I mean, yes, your father is dead. But your mother isn’t, she’s still alive.”
don’t know? Tell me, Harry, who’s supposed to know it then?” Ginny snapped, eyes flaming.
Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Alright, I’ll talk to him.”
“So, this is where you’ve been seeing?” Ginny asked as she paced around the Room.
Harry sat down on the ground, closed his eyes, and tried to take in his surroundings as much as possible, just feeling and listening.
Draco came to a halt and turned to face Harry. “I’m not in a mood to talk,” he said coolly, looking still horribly tense.
“Does he know you fancy him?”
“A band-aid. It’s a kind of Muggle version of Healing Spell or something like that,” Harry said and dug a band-aid from his bag and put it on his wound. “I can’t do Healing Spells either, so these are quite handy if something like this happens.”
“There's no such thing as perfect, and I don’t want it, anyway. All I know is that I want you, with your past, your present, your future. With your flaws and pointiness and, erm, occasional insufferability. I want all that, Draco. I want all of you,” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him closer. “You know, I never stopped loving you. Even though I tried to show you the quite opposite.”
“It’s complicated,” Harry said, sighing. “Besides, I don’t want the Prophet to know or hear the other students gossiping, so I’m alright with this as it is, at least for now.”
“I’m okay,” Harry mumbled, sitting up reluctantly.
Harry gulped. “But you said you weren’t worried about Voldemort getting to know about us, you said so last year,” he said stubbornly.
Harry stared at Ron and Hermione, confused. “Why would Snape do something like that?”
The cell was damp
“Hm, doesn’t sound a really friendly gesture, if you get what I mean,” Ron said, smirking.
“Well, if your boyfriend’s identity was still a mystery to me, I’d say he was confessing his love to you,” Ginny said. “But now that I know it’s Draco Malfoy who we’re talking about, I’m not that sure anymore.”
“Yes,” Harry said, his eyes still watering a bit because of the alcohol. “Though I didn’t get to know about it before I was thirteen.”
“I didn’t want to take it!” Draco said, almost yelling now as he kept on following Harry.
to become a Death Eater? You’re underage, for fuck’s sake.”
Ron had turned red and he took a step towards Malfoy, but Harry seized Ron’s arms and dragged him backwards. Harry looked Malfoy coldly in the eye. He couldn’t stand the situation any longer, Malfoy acting as if he hated and despised Harry. Maybe he
Potter’s eyes widened in horror. “Oh fuck.”
“You’re joking,” Harry said, squinting his eyes at Draco.
” Ron had bellowed, trying to convince Harry.
Draco smiled and turned to his side to be able to see the calm expression on Harry’s face. Slowly, he moved his fingers from Harry’s stomach to Harry’s side. Both Draco and Harry had taken a phoenix tattoo at the beginning of the Christmas holidays, Harry because he had finally been able to talk about him having been Voldemort’s Horcrux with his therapist and Draco because his parents had disowned him. It had felt a bit of a cliché but they both had loved the symbolism there as they both had died in a way and then been born again from the ashes. Getting a chance to start over, stronger and more complete than before.
“Don’t worry, mate, I made you a couple of toasts. You can eat them while we walk,” Ron said, handing toasts to Harry.
“I don’t think I can sleep anymore,” Harry said, sighing. “I’ll visit the Weasleys in a few hours, so you don’t have to cook me anything today.”
“Harry, what happened?” Hermione asked, looking at Harry, horrified.
“Right, good night then,” Ron answered, disappointed.
Draco turned his gaze quickly to his parents. His father’s face was as serious and cold as ever, not letting anything show. Draco wasn’t even sure if there was anything to show, it was probably more likely his father’s face was actually showing his purest emotions when he was regarding Draco with cold eyes and a slight sneer on his face.
“Of course I am,” Draco snapped as if it was stupid of Harry to even suspect he wasn’t. “I can’t say the Dark Lord would’ve been happy about what happened at the Ministry, but he’s not paying any attention to me. He’s rather disappointed at my father, that’s what worries me the most.”
Harry knew somewhere deep inside Draco was trying to distract him, and he should have pushed Draco away and he should have insisted Draco answer his questions, but he felt too exhausted and too unwilling to fight against him. When Draco kissed Harry, it felt like there was simply no room in his head for anything else as Ron, the war, Dumbledore’s lessons, the mead, and the necklace suddenly just disappeared completely or felt at least like something really distant and irrelevant.
“Hey, but Harry, didn’t you have something you wanted to talk about?” Hermione said, looking at Harry pointedly. Harry glanced at her murderously. He didn’t exactly fancy the idea to talk about anything else that night.
?” Harry asked, feeling terrified as he realized Draco clearly knew something about the mead.
“Er, yeah. Wondering about going back to school,” Harry said. Well, that wasn’t an outright lie exactly.
“No,” Ginny snapped, shooting a warning look at her brother. “You two stay here and solve whatever you happen to be arguing about,” she said before turning around flaming, red hair flying in the air.
Malfoy stumbled a bit as he took a couple of steps backwards. Then he straightened himself glancing once more at Harry and Ron.
--*--*--*--*--
Harry felt his face blushing, and not only because of the alcohol. “What are you doing here anyway?” he blurted out.
He knew he couldn’t tell anyone about the Pensieve, not even Draco. Before sinking into Snape’s Pensieve, it had felt like a good, or even a justified idea to get a glimpse of Snape’s mind, but he hadn’t been prepared for getting to know what he had learned by watching the memories. If he could, he would like nothing more than just to forget about everything that had happened that evening.
the one acting weird?” Harry hissed venomously. “I still have no sodding idea what you want from me.”
Harry sighed, pleased, as he closed his eyes. “You know, I almost got sorted into Slytherin.”
“An improvement, you think? I’ve got so much more troubles to refrain from just grabbing your shirt and kissing you in front of everybody these days. You think your friend Weasley would appreciate that?”
“He’s living there now, I s’pose,” Harry said, shrugging. “A friend of Andromeda’s had found him lost in the Muggle London, so Andromeda decided to offer him a place to stay.”
“We weren’t there when Snape killed Dumbledore,” Hermione insisted. “It’s a crucial bit of information, and you’re the only one who can tell about it.”
When they arrived at the Room of Requirement, Harry was happy to notice they were the first ones there. He had hoped Ginny would’ve some time to regard the Room and make herself as comfortable as possible.
“Why did you want to help them to get together?”
Draco didn’t have to be asked twice. He took a couple of steps forward and pulled Harry into a tight embrace. As soon as Draco’s arms were firmly around Harry, Draco could feel him starting to cry against his shoulder. Harry cried almost silently, only sniffling occasionally as his tears soaked through Draco’s shirt and his shaking arms squeezed Draco tightly, as if he was afraid of Draco disappearing into thin air if he didn’t hold him tight enough.
As Harry came to the door of Blaise and Draco’s room, he started to hesitate. He had no plan for what to say to Draco, and he knew he wasn’t exactly the best person to talk about feelings. What if he would make things even worse? Or what if Draco didn’t even want to talk to him?
Harry found it hard to know what to say anymore. He understood now why Draco had to keep some things secret, but it still felt wrong and unnerving. “I just don’t like this. Not at all.”
” The voice repeated, whispering quietly into Harry’s ear. Even though the question could be interpreted as an accusation, the voice didn’t sound accusing in the slightest. Instead, it was rather… sad and disappointed. Or maybe hollow, somehow resigned to its fate.
“Oh, just shut up and drink,” Malfoy said and made Harry take the bottle in his hands.
“C’moon, Potter, have a drink with me,” Malfoy said and showed Harry a really expensive-looking bottle of white wine.
Draco sighed, resting his head again against Harry’s chest. “Herregud, min elskede, du er utrolig.”
“Do you want us to come with you?” Hermione asked, a bit worried.
“So you don’t trust them?” Draco said, not really understanding what he tried to achieve with this conversation.
He didn't understand what in Salazar’s name got into him every time he had to communicate with Potter. He did understand that Potter was probably trying his best and apparently wished him only well at this point, but it was still hard for Draco to let go of old, familiar, and safe ways. It was as if he could keep Potter at arm’s length if he acted like a complete prat towards him.
“I don’t even know what to say to that,” Harry said. He found it hard to believe Zabini, not only because he didn’t know the boy at all but also because all Zabini was saying sounded so surreal as if it was from a really, really odd movie.
“What do you mean what’s on my mind?” Harry asked a bit defensively.
Harry wanted to object but refrained. They both fell again into silence for the rest of the class, and this time the silence between them felt relaxed and somehow amicable.
“Oh, darling, are you asking me on a date? How romantic,” Draco said, purring teasingly like a cat.
The expression on Harry’s face turned a bit uncomfortable. “It’s just, well, my parents had bought this for me before they died. This is the only thing I’ve left from them, apart from a photo album Hagrid gave me the first year and my father’s Cloak, of course,” Harry said and buried his face to Draco’s hair. “I know it’s a bit silly to carry around an old children’s book.”
“But you said one could get rid of their toxic thoughts?”
“Has Draco sent his birthday wishes to you yet?” Ginny asked in a low voice, eyes glinting.
“He bought you drinks the whole night?” Harry asked suspiciously, feeling a stab of jealousy. Merlin, he couldn’t afford to be jealous, it was he who had proposed being friends after all. Besides, Draco probably meant what he had said; the guy, Chris, was certainly only a friend and nothing more, right?
His mother studied him carefully before saying anything. “Yes, I knew about you,” she said cautiously. “Why are you taking this up now? Would you like to get back with him?”
“Please, don’t,” Draco said. “You’re right, it’d have been quite impossible to contact me earlier. And you’ve helped me so much I don’t know how I could ever be able to thank you enough. It’s not even been your responsibility.”
“Go and get some water,” Ron said and patted Harry on the shoulder.
“They work just perfect,” Ginny said, giving the other one to Harry. “You know you can’t send messages or call at Hogwarts?”
“So, do you have any plans for this summer?” Hermione asked Harry, trying to sound cheerful as she, Harry and Ron were sitting in the deserted common room. The sunny weather had tempted everybody to go outside, but Harry wasn’t really prepared for seeing so many people being happy and carefree when his own mood was quite the opposite.
“Just Ginny,” Blaise said, smiling warmly at Ginny, whose cheeks had gone slightly pink. It was utterly strange to see Ginny getting almost speechless. If Ginny had had any kind of presumptions of Draco’s friend, Blaise was apparently behaving in a way she hadn’t prepared herself for.
I noticed my last chapter raised confusion for a couple of reasons, and I wanted to clarify them a bit here right in the beginning. First of all, Snape told only Draco's parents about Harry and Draco, not Voldemort. It's good this came up, might have to edit the chapter so that it's clearer who got to know and who didn't.
“So you’ve said,” Snape said. “I tried to tell you last year how dangerous your arrangement with Potter is, but did you listen to me? No. You do realize you’re as good as dead if the Dark Lord gets to know about you and Potter
Harry felt suddenly a little uncomfortable. He didn’t exactly fancy going to the reasons
“But I
As long as Draco's unconscious had hinted about being gay, as long had it hinted about being bent for Potter. Draco didn't even know which was worse. At first, he had explained to himself that his constant desire to get Potter's attention arose from the git's irksomeness that made Draco's blood boil. Actually, Potter didn't usually even have to do anything to annoy Draco, the bastard's bare existence could be enough of a reason to make Draco react. Draco had longed for Potter's attention ever since they both had started at Hogwarts, and at first annoying Potter had felt like some kind of a crusade for Draco. He had wanted to repay Potter for humiliating him in front of the others by not accepting Draco's friendship in the first year, or so he had explained to himself. Gradually Draco's lonely crusade had started to include also other, more complicated feelings than pure hatred and bitterness. If it ever had included only hatred and bitterness in the first place. At some point, it had become clear to Draco that he didn't really want to rile Potter up to make him suffer. Draco just wanted Potter to notice him for reasons that Draco hadn't really let himself to ponder.
Harry felt cold all of a sudden. “Threaten? How?”
“Of course you’re not,” Harry muttered, turning his gaze at Andromeda. “Did you know Sirius and Narcissa used to organize us some sort of playdates when we were still babies?”
“It’s my charms, what can I do about it,” Blaise said grinning, and Ginny kicked him again.
“Well, in that case, sweet dreams to both of you,” Blaise said, winking at them as he stood up. “And thank you for the evening, I did have a good time,” he continued, smiling genuinely before leaving.
“You’re ignoring me and acting all weird!”
“No, I’m fine. Met Tonks on my way here and she fixed my nose,” Harry said, annoyed. “It looks alright, doesn’t it?”
“It’s because we know you wouldn’t do it yourself. You have a habit of mysteriously forgetting to eat sometimes,” Hermione said, giving him a hug before she walked into Harry’s living room, sat down on his couch and changed the channel to some nature documentary about the Amazon wildlife.
“Norwegian.”
“I haven’t actually asked Draco. I was thinking about a place like our common room, but with less red colour.”
“Dunno, didn’t really talk to him.”
Ginny looked at Harry suspiciously. “I know there’s
“A bath.”
“No, I’m just fine,” Harry said, but Malfoy looked at him with an utterly suspicious glare that felt as if Malfoy’s grey eyes were piercing him and reading him like an open book.
made? You’re nowhere near me and I can hear you as if you were right next to me, though your voice sounds a bit weird, to be honest. And where does my voice even go?”
He tried to linger as long as possible, trying to make his nerves calm down. When he finally went back, Malfoy was already ready, reading intently the instructions.
“Well, we won’t lose anything if Harry goes to check the place? It’s not a commitment,” Ron said, shrugging and looking slightly more relaxed and less red.
“So, what would you like to have?” Harry asked.
“Not yet, I think I’m going to read for a while. Took a nap earlier so I’m not tired just yet.”
He didn’t care about people watching him strangely as he walked on the streets.
“Stop it. I’m going to find out what that means,” Harry said, yawning. “Maybe tomorrow.”
Här är min vilda längtan.
Zabini’s eyes widened even more if possible. “Well, well, the Golden Boy is full of surprises, isn’t he?” Zabini said as Harry squirmed, feeling a little uncomfortable. He didn’t still fancy to talk about his sorting for some reason. “Hm, I could’ve definitely seen you in Slytherin,” Zabini continued thoughtfully.
“Like what?”
“Nonsense, Harry, you’re always more than welcome here. I hope you one day could really see this as one of your homes along with Hogwarts and your own flat,” Molly said sincerely, looking Harry in the eye. “So, you can stay in Ron’s room or you can choose almost any of the other rooms if you want. George is going to stay here over the weekend, but all the other rooms are empty.”
“What was that supposed to mean?” Ginny asked, lifting her eyebrow.
Soon they arrived at Harry and Draco’s usual spot, and there wasn’t only Blaise waiting for them. To Harry’s surprise, Draco was there as well. They hadn’t dared to see each other outside of the Room of Requirement after Draco had caught DA along with Umbridge and the other Inquisitorial Squad members, so seeing him there, on
“Here, let me take him,” Harry said, taking Teddy from Draco’s arms so that Draco could open the present.
The Room looked surprisingly nice, even though it was pretty far from how Harry had pictured it. It reminded Harry of a luxurious master bedroom in an old mansion he had seen in movies, though there was a clear touch of roughness as wells. On the left side, there was a big hearth and in front of it, there were a couple of soft-looking, indigo blue armchairs and a couch. At the back of the Room there was a large window with light grey curtains that filtered the daylight making it look somehow dreamy-like. In front of the window, there was a table with a couple of chairs that looked like they were stolen from the library as they looked exactly the same as there.
“What kind of support group are you talking about?” Draco asked, nonplussed.
Hermione was quiet for a while, her face frowned in thought. “I’ll think about something,” she said finally. “But I’m glad we’ve gotten the chance to learn to know both Blaise and Draco better. I did use to have quite prejudiced thoughts about the Slytherins as well.”
Harry gulped. “But why?” he asked hoarsely. “Why would he want
Harry closed his mouth, not knowing what to say next. To be honest, he had been so obsessed with his own thoughts and feelings he hadn’t thought at all how Draco might have seen last night’s incident.
Hermione sighed heavily. “How many more times are you still going to ask that?”
He was still alive. He was no longer in Azkaban.
When Harry made it to the entrance hall, he found Malfoy and Zabini hovering there already. They both glanced at Harry as he paced towards them, Malfoy reserved and anxious, and Zabini looking somewhat… hopeful?
“How do you know about the detention?” Draco asked, sounding reserved.
“Yeah, I’m ready. Let’s go,” Harry said, offering his arm to Ginny.
“Come here,” Draco said, reaching out to take Harry’s hand. Harry took his hand and let Draco pull him to sit down next to him. “We just wanted to surprise you, nothing more peculiar than that.”
“Erm, coffee, please,” Harry said, feeling like he really needed some caffeine in his system. “Malfoy’s here,” he continued, feeling a bit stupid as he stated the obvious.
Soon, a hazy, green stripe appeared in the sky, moving slowly from the horizon towards them.
“Scared of losing him to the other side?”
“No need to thank Dobby, Dobby is always happy to help mister Harry Potter and his friends,” Dobby said and grabbed the empty basket.
“Don’t go with them, please,” Harry said pleading, his voice muffled against Draco’s shoulder.
“You were in shock. It’s only natural,” Draco said softly, burying his fingers in Harry’s hair.
“I don’t like Lucius Malfoy either, but he has an equal right to live just like everyone else. People shouldn’t play gods, it has never resulted in anything good,” Hermione said.
“Do you think he could ever forgive me?” Draco asked, sounding almost pathetically desperate.
“Don’t say so. It’s not all about huge muscles, rough appearance or stuff like that.”
up to something. He’s –”
“As if you could. You’re such a mother hen,” Ron said, snorting. “I mean it only in a good way,” Ron hastened to continue as he saw Hermione raising her eyebrows disapprovingly.
“I… Just drop it, Ron, please. C’mon, let’s grab some toasts. I don’t want to be late for Potions,” Harry said, motioning towards the Gryffindor table.
chances to change,” Potter said. “I just don’t want to live in a society where it’s okay to kill as a punishment. I don’t want any more killing in the name of the War.”
“Yeah, I’m going to tell him soon, I really am.”
“I thought you only knew who was behind everything, that you were some kind of a messenger or something,” Harry said, talking over Draco. “You’ve almost
“What on Earth are you doing?” Draco asked, amused, as he came abruptly to stand next to Harry.
“Oh, you didn’t want tequila? Sorry, couldn’t hear you,” Ron said, the corner of his mouth twitching.
But when Harry opened the door into the common room, he was met by loud, happy chatter and laughter.
“Nothing, it’s all fine,” Draco said, avoiding Harry’s gaze and starting to fiddle nervously with his left sleeve. Harry vaguely remembered it was the same arm Draco had jerked away from Madam Malkin’s hands when she had touched it.
“What?” Harry snapped angrily before Malfoy had time to open his mouth.
But again, there was no answer. The door was so thin it was usually possible to hear if Teddy was crying or if someone came to open the door, but this time there was only silence.
“Yeah, absolutely,” Harry said before kissing Draco goodbye.
“Can imagine,” Ginny said. “How was Malfoy?”
Harry bit his lower lip nervously. “But… I dunno. It still feels somehow... so much.”
From now on, he was practically dead to them.
“You can. Two innocent people have almost died, and someone’s life is threatened,” Harry said. “Please, let’s go to see Dumbledore. I’m sure he can solve this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” Lucius said finally in a cold, formal voice as he placed his pastry fork on his plate. “You are hereby disowned, and you are no longer our son. However, you can keep the Malfoy name, but otherwise, you are not entitled to an inheritance from the Malfoy family. Now, pack everything you want to take with you and leave.”
As Ginny realized Draco wasn’t going to answer her, she pulled back a little and turned her eyes to his, but Draco’s eyes were completely locked on Harry’s.
“Yes,” Harry said, sounding a bit hesitant, though. “He’s just so… persistent.”
Ginny had been so lost in thought she startled a little when she heard someone talking to her. “Well hello to you too,” Ginny said, smiling mischievously. “You two looked just so cute and cosy as you snored and drooled on each other, so me and Blaise thought it’d be nice to give you some privacy.”
Harry didn’t know what to make out of the new information he had learned because, to be honest, he hadn’t understood even half of it. The Unbreakable Vow sounded almost like gibberish to him, and Snape being Draco’s some sort of protector sounded just… disturbed. And why exactly had Draco’s mother wanted Snape to protect Draco? And what had Draco meant by telling Snape he had a plan? A plan to do what?
“What do you mean?”
“It should be on the table by the hearth. Thanks, Harry!”
“No? Didn’t manage to convince you yet? Hm, maybe we could come up with something, ah, gayer the next time,” Malfoy said, purring like a cat in Harry’s ear.
Draco snorted. “Figures you’ve befriended even with the house-elves. Must be quite a fan of yours,” Draco said, seizing one of the roses. “You’re sure he doesn’t have a crush on you? Or did you ask him to add some flowers for me? Oh, I didn’t know you’re such a sap, Potter.”
When Friday finally came, Harry got a chance to meet Draco properly for the first time after the holidays. Before that, they had only managed to share a couple of glances and nervous smiles in the Great Hall and shared lessons, which had only made Harry want to grab Draco from his stupid Slytherin tie, push him against a wall and snog him senseless in front of everyone. Of course, Harry knew better and did none of those things. Instead, he waited calmly until Friday’s last lessons were over, said his hasty I’m-going-to-hang-out-with-Ginny excuses to Ron and Hermione and rushed to the Room of Requirement.
Draco gulped, looking sad. “I get that. To be honest, I don’t trust myself, either.”
But when the War ended, nothing was that simple anymore. The word ‘justice’ began slowly change its meaning when the winning side started discussing the Death Eater trials they had planned already during the War. Even though they were happy and relieved they had won, they still couldn’t forget the cruelty and the injustices the opponent side had done. Instead of mercy, fairness, and forgiveness, the end of the War brought to the surface feelings of bitterness and bottomless thirst for revenge. If you tortured and killed my loved ones, I have the right to torture and kill you. Talks about justice and equality started to turn into thoughts about eliminating evil, once and for all. Actually, the light side wanted to forget the War and the evilness completely by destroying the haunting memories and remnants of them and wiping them out from the world, pretending they had never even existed.
with them. Then there was Pansy Parkinson, who was staring at them openly from the other end of the Slytherin table with the if-looks-could-kill look on her face as she talked vehemently with Millicent Bulstrode and Theodore Nott, who weren’t looking at them very friendly either. And then there was Snape, who was probably the worst of all. The look on his face was an interesting mix of disbelief, disgust and hate, and Harry couldn’t decide which one of those feelings showed the most as he saw how Snape squinted his dark, flaming eyes and scowled at them, mouth set in a grim line.
“Oh,” Harry said, lost of words.
“Well, it’s kind of an object where you can hide a piece of your soul.”
” Granger’s voice echoed feebly as Potter stomped loudly down the stairs like a sodding giant. Draco didn’t have to think twice before his curiosity won and he moved to sit down on the floor next to the door, his ear as tightly against the door as possible.
Not that Harry wouldn’t have any real reasons to feel grim or grumpy. It was actually quite the opposite, and one could say that his summer hadn’t exactly been an ideal one. Dementors, hearing at the Ministry, Prophet’s articles and constant nightmares had all been messing with his head, and no matter how much he tried not to think about them, they came always swirling back with emotions that made Harry feel like drowning. He hadn’t even had time to process Cedric’s death on the Triwizard Tournament before all of the summer’s incidents had come pouring out one after another. Maybe that was the reason why Cedric had been, and still was, one of the main characters in the nightmares that made Harry wake up screaming as in major pain and agony. Even Dudley, as obtuse as ever, had found Harry’s nightmares as his sore point and started poking at them every once in a while to make him riled up. It felt just so unfair how someone could speak so lightly about everything he had gone through as if his reasons to wake up screaming every night were just something petty and childish.
“What, do you mean like… lovers?”
”, Ron exclaimed. “I think I’m going to throw up.”
“Morning,” Harry said and kissed Draco on the mouth.
,” Hermione said firmly.
Malfoy sighed again. “I don’t want to cause you any harm. But I can’t, I just can’t.”
“Yes, I wasn’t planning on using them here,” Harry said as he tried to remember how to use a phone. After a while, he managed to find messages, the contact list and the settings. He and Ginny listened to different ring tones and chose the most bizarre ones for both phones.
Harry glanced at Ginny, surprised by how casually she took him telling her he fancied a bloke. “I’m not going to send love messages.”
Hermione flushed and smiled at Harry. “Well, anyway, I think you should talk to your mystery bloke and ask him what’s going on between the two of you.”
, Malfoy, honestly,” Harry said, feeling lost of breath.
“But you’re going to send love messages to her with that?”
After that, a deep silence fell as Draco apparently couldn’t come up with anything else to say. As silently as he could, Harry tiptoed a few steps backwards from the door, turned around and started to stalk towards the Gryffindor Tower. The buzz of thoughts in his head was so loud he forgot completely he was supposed to return to the party, but in that state of mind, it would probably have been a catastrophic idea anyway.
“What are you thinking?” Draco asked.
“You git! Now this is unfair!” Harry cried out as Draco managed to change their positions so that Harry was now laying under him.
” Weasley interrupted.
“So, how’s it going with you two?”
“Oh, you’ve already made some tea, good,” Andromeda said, coming abruptly into the kitchen in her white nightgown, making Draco startle. “Is it camomile?” she asked, sitting down in front of him and pouring herself a cup.
“Harry, you’re staring again,” Hermione said warningly to Harry the next morning when she, Harry and Ron were eating breakfast in the Great Hall.
“You’ve got your phone with you?” Ginny whispered furiously.
“Exactly. That’s why we think there must be quite a lot we don’t know about him as you fell in love with him, and even Ginny seemes to be quite fond of him,” Hermione said.
Mikä on tää tunne
Hermione inhaled sharply and frowned her eyebrows, concerned. “What did he say exactly?”
“Hey, but c’mon, you’ve got to get used to Muggle stuff, too,” Harry said. “You’re going to go out with Muggles and all.”
--*--*--*--*--
Draco felt flabbergasted. He had always acted horribly towards her, so it did not make any sense she was suddenly trying to, what, befriend him? No matter how much Draco pondered Granger’s intentions, he couldn’t make anything out of them. That’s why he felt reserved and acted mainly coldly and distantly towards the girl, only grunting for an answer or just point-blank ignoring her. But still, even despite Draco’s abysmal manners, she kept coming back.
in this context,” Harry snarled, feeling himself getting frustrated again. “What do you want from me, Malfoy?”
Harry was sitting in the library, doing homework with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny as he listened to the raindrops hitting the window next to him. The constant patter sound of the rain made Harry’s brain feel like jelly, and he found it impossible to even start writing his Advanced Potions essay.
They dived into an easy conversation about all the prefects from different Houses and their expectations about the new school year ahead of them. It made even Harry feel a little bit better, or at least more normal. He was so used to share the compartment with Hermione and Ron that their presence made it soon feel nice and cosy. He managed to forget even his bitterness about Malfoy being a prefect until the compartment door slid open once again.
They all stood up and grabbed their bags. When they started to pace towards the doors, Harry and Draco made sure to have long enough a distance between each other by walking on both sides of Ginny and Blaise, who were walking between them, hand in hand.
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“Harry, you don't know how much I’ve missed you,” Draco murmured as he kissed Harry. “How much I’ve missed this,” he went on, grabbing Harry’s collar and pulling him closer.
Jeg elsker deg også = I love you too
“Harry, what the hell! Why didn’t you let me punch the brat?” Ron whined when they had gone far enough from the maliciously snickering Slytherins.
“All so serious and concentrated but yet haven’t caught a sight of the snitch?” Harry yelled at Draco as he circled around him, teasing.
“Er, right,” Harry said, blushing and looking around nervously, but Blaise and Ginny were nowhere to be seen anymore. “You do realize we might be seen?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, feeling his heartbeat raising now.
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice cut him short, and both Harry and Ginny turned their gazes quickly to the girl who was half-running towards them.
Harry had shared his worry with Blaise, who had also noticed there was something horribly wrong with Draco, but neither of them knew what they could do. As Blaise was able to sit with Draco at the Slytherin table and as they shared the dormitory, he could follow Draco more closely and try to make him at least eat some more, but it didn’t seem to have any effect.
Ginny smiled at him. “Well, I’d better go now, Michael’s waiting for me at Three Broomsticks. See you around, Chosen One,” Ginny said and hugged him briefly.
“Git,” Harry muttered, smiling crookedly and feeling rather pleased.
Malfoy followed Harry cautiously and closed the door. His eyes were unreadable when he turned to look at Harry in the eye.
“Don’t worry about him, he’s just a nosy prat. He’s like that to everyone. Last week he was proclaiming loudly to Malfoy and his cronies how their parents must be all happy Death Eaters now that You-Know-Who has returned. Malfoy didn’t seem pleased.”
“I think so, yes,” Ron said. “Just keep us better updated next time you decide to start shagging someone regularly, okay?”
“Figure out what?”
” Potter asked.
“Of course he does, you silly thing. Now
Draco turned his blazing gaze to Harry. “I don’t fucking know. Do you think I haven’t thought about this? I can’t tell them, if that’s what you’re asking,” Draco said, sounding angry and anxious at the same time.
“You know very well it’s
“Merlin, Harry,” Ginny said, still seemingly perplexed. “And what happened then?”
by Blaise, but he had still kept his head. Although, after maybe the one-hundredth
“It was definitely Potter’s,” Draco said gloomily, and Harry turned bright red.
Harry hurried to the Gryffindor Tower to leave his schoolbooks there and to take the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map with him before heading to the lake.
They began to move extremely slowly forward. First out of Draco's cell into a narrow, dimly lit corridor. Then to the right, then to the left, then up the stairs and to the right again… After a moment, Draco had no longer the slightest idea where Potter was leading him as all his energy went into trying to stay conscious. If only his father could see him right now, trusting blindly Harry Potter, leaning on the goddamned Saviour as if his life depended on him. Well, it kind of did depend on the prat, to be honest. Lucius Malfoy would probably turn in his grave.
“If you go now, there’s no coming back,” Harry said, suddenly more coldly. “We’d be over then.”
The cut wasn’t deep, but it was still bleeding a little.
As Blaise had become an important part of Harry and Draco’s relationship in a way, so had Ginny turned out to be an amazing support for Harry. Even though she loved to tease Harry, almost driving him over the edge from time to time, she never pressed him to tell her who he was seeing. Now that Harry was seeing Draco much more frequently, she used to help him to make it work smoothly. When sleeping with Draco, Harry had to wake up around 4 a.m. to be able to sneak back into his dorm without anyone noticing, but in the evenings Ginny could quite easily cover up for him. She even sent Harry’s and Draco’s mobile phones to Arthur so that he could charge the batteries for the Christmas holidays. Harry remembered vaguely Ginny saying earlier something about him deserving more happiness in his life, and now he could really see how she truly had meant what she had said. In between all her grinning and the mischievous glinting in her eyes, Harry could see a glimpse of a warm and soft smile every time they happened to talk about Harry’s ‘secret affair’.
Fuck, it was all so mortifying.
“I think I might be gay,” Harry said, this time managing to articulate himself quite clearly.
“Er, I must agree with ‘Mione on this one, you’ve become bloody obsessed with him, mate,” Ron said.
“Just another scar. Or, well, it’s practically still a wound.”
“We probably should, Molly won’t appreciate if we’re late,” Harry said a bit grudgingly as he was feeling so pleasantly relaxed because of the light and happy atmosphere and the few beers he had had. “It was good to see you all.”
“Wait wait wait, does Dobby know about you two?” Ginny asked, pointing at Harry and Draco, who were now sitting rather stiffly next to each other on the couch.
Draco nodded again, and Granger sat down, biting her lip nervously.
“Dobby thinks so,” Dobby said, looking pensive. “But Dobby can help mister Draco to search for Harry Potter.”
“Have you thought about telling them?”
And to be honest, he didn't even
“But he’s still going back to Hogwarts for the eight year?” Hermione asked, comforting.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Harry said as hatefully as he could before walking away, dragging Ron with him as Hermione followed right after them.
“Of course it's not you! I could never do that to you,” Draco said, pleading and wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and pulling Harry flush against him. “Harry, please, you’ve got to believe me. I never wanted anyone to die. I still don’t want to. But there’s no way I could get myself out.”
“You should’ve seen Ginny’s face when I told her who I was seeing. She definitely
But he couldn’t go on any longer, he simply just couldn’t. The knife fell from his grip, clanking loudly as it hit the floor, and he fell right after it.
“Harry, dear, would you like to have more coffee?” Molly asked as she noticed Harry was about to doze off.
It had been so much easier to use the Cloak with Hermione and Ron during their first years at Hogwarts, but now with Draco, who was slightly longer than Harry, it felt like an impossible mission. They both had to crouch a bit and walk very, very near to each other if they wanted the Cloak to cover their legs.
“Yeah. Astronauts,” Draco whispered, almost asleep now.
“What? Did I hit a nerve? Isn’t everything as sunshiny and rainbowy between you three as the media shows?”
Kissing Draco was odd. Every time Harry kissed Draco, he felt excited and giddy, as if kissing him was something new and strange, but at the same time, it always felt something so familiar and comforting, even after weeks apart. And right then it felt like it was something as essential as air for his lungs after being under the water surface for too long.
“No, mum, we’ll stay here and let them talk in private,” Ginny said firmly.
He had been practically freed of all charges only a few hours ago, thanks to all the witnesses and Harry’s letter. He only had to attend Hogwarts for the eight year as for some sort of punishment, and then he’d be free to do whatever he wanted. Well, obviously inside the limits of what the wizarding society would
“Probably not,” Ginny said, grinning. “Just kidding. Blaise asked Draco if he could tell me, and Draco was fine with it.”
“Good.”
“Okay, now I do want to know what you’re hiding from me. What’s going on?” Ron asked curiously. Both Ron and Hermione turned their gazes to Harry.
“We’re not being all lovey-dovey,” Harry muttered under his breath.
“Ah, I see, your dear Auntie Bella has taught you Occlumency. At least you’re not as hopeless a case as your paramour,” Snape said coolly. “Tell me, Draco, does Potter know about your little plan?”
“Hm, Harry? How do I close this thing?”
Harry sighed. He knew he had wanted Draco to find him, but for what, that he didn’t know.
“Was just thinking about my parents a bit,” Draco muttered, turning his gaze back to his cup.
“Shit,” Harry muttered, irritated. “Go away,” he hissed to Dudley who didn’t move an inch. He had apparently decided to stay and pester Harry until he got some kind of an answer.
“Any plans for today?” Ron asked, making a toast and yawning opposite of Harry.
“But you’re ready to risk your own life?” Harry asked, feeling a bit nauseous of the idea.
,” Harry snapped, looking coldly into Draco’s stormy grey eyes.
“It’s nothing to worry about. Just a lot of guests coming and going, is all,” Draco said, trying to make his voice sound light and carefree.
“Are you still going to see Blaise?” Hermione asked.
This chapter is somewhat shorter than my chapters usually. Thought it'd be better to cut it here before Harry & co. go back to Hogwarts.
Harry walked slowly backwards, holding both of Draco’s hands and looking Draco in the eye the whole time. The moonlight made his grey eyes look somehow silvery and glittering, just like stardust would probably look like.
“Erm, yes please,” Harry said, trying to keep his eyes open as he took the cup Molly handed him.
Hermione’s rationality didn’t really help that much. Actually, Harry saw Ron getting only more annoyed at that, and he had started muttering curses in a low voice.
“What?” Harry asked, perplexed.
“Yes, we took a walk, talked a bit. He’s not too bad as you said,” Ginny said, acting nonchalant but still having a rather pretty pink colour on her cheeks. “Have you talked to him after yesterday?”
Harry looked Draco in the eye and put his hand over Draco’s. “Yes. This is just… not at all as I imagined this to go.”
“Ron’s still ranting about you two, by the way. He’s like a broken record nowadays, asking the same questions over and over again,” Harry said, ignoring Blaise’s comment about Snape as he had no desire to think about Snape any more than was strictly necessary.
“What made you change your mind? You didn’t seem very eager to listen to me at the beginning of last week,” Draco said suspiciously.
“What?” Harry snapped angrily.
“Harry, please –”
“Cool, mum will be thrilled! I’ll tell her to cook a bit extra so that there’s enough for you, too,” Ron said, sounding more cheerful.
Harry raised his eyebrow. “You’ve always told me the exact opposite.”
Harry looked at Malfoy unbelievingly. The git did have the nerve. The only thing he seemed to care about was that Harry still agreed to keep his dirty little secret. And how could Harry even answer to that?
“Master was rolling restlessly around in his sheets, and Kreacher is quite sure Master was screaming the name ‘Malfoy’. Might Master have been screaming the name of Narcissa of the noble and honoured House Black? Or maybe of someone else in her family?”
Neither Harry nor Ron said anything. Being a prefect had made Hermione not to tolerate
Dobby drew his hand along his mouth, closing it as if with a zipper before he Disapparated away with another bang.
“You stay out of this! It’s a pity I can’t kill you myself, but I suppose the Dark Lord will do it for me soon enough,” Lucius snapped at Harry. “Draco, you can still make things right. We can forget all about your little misjudgement if you come with me now.”
Malfoy chuckled a little before leaning his forehead against Harry’s. Harry closed his eyes, put his arms around the other boy’s waist, and pulled Malfoy firmly against him. Malfoy pulled slightly back, which made Harry snap his eyes open. He stared into Harry’s eyes, grey eyes sparkling. He lowered his hands to Harry’s chest and started pushing Harry slowly backwards, his eyes never leaving Harry’s.
,” Weasley said grimly.
“Who is it, Draco? Is it me whom he has ordered you to kill?” Harry snapped. “Or don’t answer that, it doesn’t really matter. I know you’re trying to kill someone from the Order’s side, anyway.”
“Don’t thank me, this is not a favour. I trust you to stop this nonsense right away,” Snape said coldly. “Draco, you may go. Potter, you stay.”
Draco Malfoy opened his eyes and stared glassy-eyed at the grey stone ceiling for a moment.
Ginny gaped at him. “Harry, are you sure you’re alright? Is this a joke or something?”
“I won’t, or I’ll at least try not to,” Harry tried to say confidently, even though he still felt quite insecure about everything that was somehow related to Malfoy. “Thanks ‘Mione, truly. I think I’d better head to bed now or I won’t make it to the morning lessons.”
“No,” Draco said more loudly this time.
Harry closed his eyes and heaved a sigh. “Fine,” he said, letting finally go, pulling Draco closer, and kissing him deeply.
“Come again?” Draco said, confused.
Draco traced the lines of Harry’s tattoo with his finger, making the phoenix flap its wings.
Ginny still glared at him incredulously. “Just give me a sec,” she said, closing her eyes for a moment and making herself calm down. “Right. How did this even happen?” she asked, opening her eyes again.
Sirius just laughed. “That’s alright, I’m already used to being locked inside here. From Azkaban to being imprisoned in my lovely family home, someone could call it the irony of faith,” Sirius said, trying to sound like he was only joking but Harry could still hear the slightly bitter tone in his voice. “No, I mean honestly, just go and enjoy on my behalf, too. It’s good to get some fresh air.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered, standing cautiously in a doorway to an empty classroom.
Draco looked at Harry, uncertain. “Only for a while?”
“Thank you, Potter. It was truly a pleasure,” Zabini said, clapping Harry on the shoulder before leaving Harry alone in the classroom.
“And you had met him as well?” Blaise asked, turning his eyes to Ginny.
,” Draco heard Potter whisper next to him, and suddenly the Auror stopped talking in the middle of the sentence as the look on his face turned completely empty and expressionless.
“Yes, of course, that sounds a really good idea,” Harry said hastily.
“Your Gryffindors are not keeping you busy today?” Malfoy asked, starting to give light kisses along Harry’s jaw.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have to be more specific than that if you want me to answer your question,” Snape snarled.
“No, it’s okay, no need to hurry up with your breakfast. I’ll see you soon,” Harry said, waving his hand as he tried to walk out as normally as possible.
“Not really,” Ron said, shrugging. “I mean, even all my brothers told me before I started at Hogwarts that the Slytherins keep to themselves meanwhile students from other Houses are being all nice and friendly with each other. It was just how it was. Or still is, I s’pose.”
“We could make this place ours and never leave,” Draco whispered, nibbling slightly Harry’s ear.
“Erm, I think so,” Harry answered, still sitting as if glued to his chair.
“I do. Although I can’t say I really understand why, I just do,” Draco said, looking into the distance.
I had planned to explain here a bit my reasoning behind Draco's actions and why I sympathize with him quite a lot in this story, but it seems like I already made Andromeda and Hermione say almost everything I wanted to say, heh.
in the first place,” Draco said. “That makes us even, in case Ginny tried to cheat. Which I highly doubt.”
“Good morning, handsome,” Draco murmured softly and closed his eyes again.
Molly, on the other hand, seemed to be extremely happy having two of her sons and Harry staying over, and she had prepared them a proper feast with so many dishes they had no chance to eat even half of the food. As the night proceeded, Harry started to slowly feel more relaxed listening to Arthur explaining about the latest Muggle artefacts he had bought and George explaining about the newest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products he had just started to sell in his shop. The loss of Fred, and all the others, was still heavily present, but just for a moment, it was nice to be able to talk about small, mundane things that brought some happiness into everyone’s lives.
“Well, then I couldn’t care less, you know. Charlie is also gay – or maybe bi? Anyways, I have nothing against the, erm, queer people,” Ron explained lightly. “But ‘Mione, it’s not really okay to out people like this.”
“I’m just… I dunno,” Harry began uncertainly, running his hand through his hair.
Harry was silent for a moment. No matter how much he hated Lucius Malfoy and wanted him to suffer, Lucius was still Draco’s dad. “Well, I’m happy that you’re okay. Just let me know if there’s anything I can help you with.”
“Yes.”
, that’s… sweet.”
“What?” Harry asked, confused.
“It’s not your fault they didn’t tell you,” Draco said firmly, looking at his aunt.
“Molly’s going to be thrilled. She loves to have more people to fuss over.”
As Harry entered the room, he noticed Draco was leaning on the kitchen countertop, his shoulders shaking a little.
“All that happened about fifteen years ago. My mother has changed a lot since then.”
“Andromeda, er, she’s changing Teddy’s clothes,” Draco said hoarsely, apparently finding his voice again. “There was an accident in the kitchen. They should be ready at any minute.”
Draco seemed to relax a little by Harry’s touch, and he turned to his side to face Harry.
“Of course they don’t know. No one knows. As if I’d wear the Invisibility Cloak just for fun,” Potter said, rolling his eyes and taking a few steps towards Draco. “Come on, let’s go!”
It all had apparently felt
Draco regarded the thin ice cover on the lake while images of his episode came streaming back to his mind. This time, though, the panic didn't take over, even if he still felt rather anxious. He had seen all that coming, even though he had managed to lie to himself for a long time. Draco sighed heavily. He knew that there was no way he could continue lying to himself, not anymore, not after that night. Somehow Draco felt even a little relieved. At least he knew now what was happening to him. Or rather to the insides of his head.
“Oh really? Hard to believe that,” Harry muttered, unconvinced.
“Yes,” Harry said, feeling a bit guilty. “Thank you, Gin. I really needed this.”
“That’s alright,” Harry said, putting his hand on top of Draco’s and interlacing their fingers together. “But no, nothing that weird. I guess the Medievalish school must be my weirdest experience.”
“Did I ask you to say something, Potter?” Snape asked, taking a step closer to them.
“I don’t know. This feels so messed up,” Harry said, hesitating.
“Father, it’s not what –” Draco tried again, but Lucius cut him off again.
“I trusted you!” Harry cried, grabbing Draco’s robes and pushing him against the wall. “I fucking trusted you! I should’ve known you wouldn’t ever be able to change. I should’ve known I could never trust you. I really cared for you, I fucking told you I love you, and all the time you’ve been on
“I don’t know,” Hermione said, biting her lip nervously. “I’m sorry but I believe the Wizengamot doesn’t care that much about the age. Merely the Dark Mark on someone’s arm seems to be enough of a reason for them to sentence someone to death, and they aren’t exactly ready to budge on the rules,” she explained. “It’s not at all unusual that something like this happens after a war. Actually, it’s rather common that people still feel the same as they used to during the war, you know, hatred, bitterness, thirst for revenge and so on. Those feelings don’t just suddenly vanish and stop existing when the war ends. Instead, people may try to vent them, well, like this. The winning side wants to get their revenge on the losing side by oppressing them or possibly even trying to eliminate them completely.”
When Harry hadn’t been willing to cooperate, Umbridge had threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on him, which had almost made Draco make a dash for him for the second time that day. Luckily, only almost. This time it had been Granger who, unconsciously, had made Draco stay right where he was as she had started to explain about some odd weapon that was supposed to belong to Dumbledore.
“That’s not true, I –.”
“What do you want, Malfoy? What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked tiredly.
“I’m happy for you. If someone deserves more happiness in their life, it’s you,” Ginny said softly. “How did Ron and Hermione take this?”
Good, now just a little more. He could do it, he knew he could. Just a little bit more, and then he’d be free again.
“They could’ve told us at least about Hagrid. But the most important thing is that Hagrid’s back safely,” Hermione said, sounding content.
?” Draco asked, a hint of jealousy in his voice.
Harry startled violently, and Ginny drew her hand quickly away. “Erm…” he started.
“Draco, here’s a picture of you,” Andromeda said, handing Draco a picture she had found from the pile. “Your mother sent it to me when you were one year old. After that, I heard nothing from you nor my sister.”
“Draco,” Blaise said plainly.
Draco considered Harry for a long while, and, to Harry’s relief, decided to accept Harry’s request by joining Harry under the Cloak and wrapping his arm around Harry’s waist to be able to stand as close to Harry as possible to make them both fit there.
--*--*--*--*--
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to, just come and sit with me for a while,” Harry said, trying to make his breath even after running.
Ginny had clearly sensed Harry getting more tense and anxious because she took Harry’s hand and squeezed it comfortingly. “It’s fine, we’ve found a spot far from everybody else,” she said.
“What do you mean?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Potter snapped as he scrutinised Draco’s changed appearance from head to toe, looking downright horrified. Draco suddenly felt extremely vulnerable and naked. How ironic it was that he had thirsted for Potter’s attention for almost his entire life and done everything he could have thought of to get it, but now that Potter was finally paying his undivided attention to him, he would have wanted to be anywhere else but under the intense stare of another boy’s green eyes. He hadn’t wanted Potter to come to witness how successfully the current Ministry had managed to destroy him. He didn’t want to share his last moments in this world with the git.
Just a random side note: if there are any Italian readers, congrats for winning the Eurovision Song Contest this year! Listened to Zitti e buoni on repeat while I was writing this chapter, rock'n'roll never dies and so on.
“Hello?” Harry said, surprised, as he answered the phone.
“Haven’t heard much of him since I left the Dursleys,” Harry said. After their phone call, Harry had received only a couple of text messages from Draco. He hadn’t thought anything about it at first as he believed Draco’s battery must have drained, but now the clear anxiety he had heard in Draco’s voice during their phone call was haunting him.
“Bloody hell, Harry, didn’t know you’d be this rusty,” Ron said, looking at Harry and Draco a bit oddly but refraining from commenting anything. “This must be the first time you lose to Malfoy,” he went on, making Ginny hush him down and kick him, but it was too late.
“You don’t have feelings for me anymore?”
Draco sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed, his posture relaxing a little. “So, what kind of a roommate is Weasley? Snores a lot?”
“You must be joking, right? Parkinson’s been chasing after Malfoy since the first year. At least,” Ron said incredulously.
Harry grabbed his bag and exited Snape’s office as quickly as possible. He didn’t stop when he got out. Instead, he let his legs lead him without further thinking.
“Do you want to talk about it? You know you’ve always the right to be yourself, no matter what,” Hermione said, making Harry feel relieved as she took the responsibility of carrying on their conversation.
I don’t want to spread an idea all the Jehovah’s Witnesses would do something like this and shut one completely out of the family because I honestly don’t believe all of them would do it (although I’ve read too many stories about people who have been shut out one way or another for different reasons). And it’s not like it’s a problem only amongst Jehovah’s Witnesses, there are many other conservative religious groups that do this as well. It was mainly the idea of organizing a funeral for a living family member that stuck in my head. Never read any other group doing something like that, especially these days. And I don’t know how much it happens, I only know it happens.
The corner of Harry’s mouth was tugging slightly upwards. “A band-aid,” Harry corrected Malfoy. “And no, they are quite useless for curse wounds, and I only have small ones, you know, for smaller cuts. But Hermione has some solution that made this heal a bit last time.”
“What? Me acting like a four-year-old brat?” Harry asked, disbelieving.
--*--*--*--*--
I can’t believe this story has finally come to its end. Writing this has been quite an experiment for me as I’ve never written anything this long, and before I started writing this, I hadn’t actually written anything in English in almost ten years (if random phrases on Google Search don’t count). I don’t know if it’s been the brightest idea of my life to start writing in English again by writing something over 100k, but now it’s finished, done, completed in any case. If nothing else, I think I’ve learned a lot of English and I’ve definitely enjoyed the whole writing process from beginning to end.
“Firewhisky, vodka, tequila or –”
“I take it you’re not openly together then?”
“Erm,
“I don’t know, something about handling stuff that is too big to him. I didn’t catch it that well, Malfoy was acting somehow, er, weirdly.”
“Oh. Figures why Harry never fell for me, then,” Myrtle mumbled somewhere in the background, but neither Harry nor Draco seemed to hear her.
“Right,” Hermione said dryly. “You know, I’ve studied Malfoy’s case a bit.”
“Malfoy kissed Harry at the beginning of the fifth year, right Harry?” Hermione said, looking at Harry questioningly.
something.”
your footsteps this year. Anyway, I’m still going to keep my promise, of course, I’m going to make your year a hell,” Malfoy went on babbling.
Se här är mina drömmar,
“But I don’t – Oh,” Draco said, looking confused.
“I meant alone,” Ginny added and gave Harry a meaningful look. “Maybe on the stairs outside?”
“Did something happen yesterday when you went to see Dobby?” Hermione asked. concerned.
It felt like heaven, to be drunk and seduced by Malfoy. To be drunk on Malfoy. Hehe. God, why hadn’t Harry done neither of these things much, much earlier?
“So, what did you want to talk about?” Harry asked, already knowing the answer.
When Harry and Ron finally made it to the dinner, they both were exhausted and annoyed. Especially Ron was grim, thanks to the Slytherins, and he was just rolling his food around the plate without even tasting it, which was really uncharacteristic to him.
“’Course. Actually, I’m not hungry anymore. I think I’ll go flying already,” Harry said, trying to sound as calm as possible as he stood up. His stomach had just turned upside down, and he was feeling so furious he couldn’t just stay and sit there.
“And you should listen to him. Nothing has changed,” Harry said softly, stroking Draco’s silky hair. “Come here, sweetheart,” Harry said, standing up and taking Draco’s hand to help him up as well.
“Of course. I had also thought about how I could be in contact with you during the holidays, but I couldn’t come up with anything. It’d be too dangerous to send owls as my father’s friends are practically living in the Manor nowadays. This is a perfect solution once I learn to use it.”
Harry stared at Zabini blankly. “And what exactly do you want me to do? Malfoy’s behaviour towards me changes twice a day, I’ve no idea when he’s being real or what he wants from me. Besides, he has a girlfriend.”
“You’re still studying? This late?” Harry asked, taking a few steps towards Draco.
“Do you think we can make this work?” Draco asked tentatively.
“Harry –” Draco began, sounding slightly alarmed.
“A bit,” Harry said, staring at the canopy with empty eyes. “Was it all real? I mean, everything that happened yesterday,” he asked, hoping that at least some of it would’ve been only a dream.
Draco’s eyes widened in horror and he turned to look at Harry, incredulous. “No, we’re not.”
For a while neither of them said anything. Draco’s gaze was reserved as he looked Harry in the eye, as if he was searching for something.
“Your stalking, Harry,” Hermione said, frustrated.
Snape studied Draco for a moment, looking deeply into his eyes. “If you weren’t going to save yourself, I had to do it,” he said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder quickly and leaving from the balcony, black robes fluttering behind him.
“You don’t know what’s going to happen during the war.”
“Life isn’t meant to be too easy,” Andromeda said, smiling ruefully. “Where would all the fun be in that?”
“It’s surprisingly cosy in here. What were you hoping for when you came here for the first time?”
Harry turned his eyes to Draco. He had known Draco’s thoughts about the blood system and non-magical people hadn’t been just light, meaningless taunting, he truly believed in what he was saying. Still, it was strange to get to know Draco and start liking him meanwhile he was talking about things like blood superiority as if they were pure facts.
“You don’t really have to say anything. I believe the most important thing to Draco was to have someone to listen to him without judging,” Hermione said. “Has he mentioned if there’s been any help of the group?”
Ginny glanced at Harry, with a puzzled look on her face. “No. Why do you ask?”
“How could you?”
“I think I’ll send Draco a message, just in case he happens to get it,” Harry said and started to type.
“Wait, you git! You can’t just do this and then run away again!”
“You’ve a
“Thank you,” Harry said sharply, cutting Molly short. “I really appreciate it, I do, but it’s in the past now. Not I nor Draco can change the decisions we made back then, so it’s better not to think too much about how things could’ve turned out. We’re here now, both alive. I’d rather concentrate on that.”
Draco stood up, seized Harry’s hand, and shook it, looking Harry in the eye all the while. “Truce.”
“Right,” Draco said, giving Harry a funny look for the second time that day.
Draco closed his mouth and swallowed audibly. He had thought Potter had come to pity him, perhaps even to apologise and lament for Draco's fate, repeating empty phrases about the stupidity of the youth and how he, in all his nobleness, would not have wished such a fate even to Draco. What exactly did Potter mean by saying that he had come to take him away? “Once again on a mission to rescue poor, unfortunate souls then?”
. How was Harry supposed to tell which one of these Malfoys was the real one? Malfoy’s eyes glowed with uncertainty, but other than that there weren’t any other indications that he wouldn’t stand behind his words.
Harry wanted to argue but decided to refrain for now. “Fine,” he said, sighing. “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you in the first place. I should have.”
Harry shrugged. “I’ve just kind of realized we don’t all get the same cards in life.”
“You mean the aeroplane? Or the helicopter?”
“Is me being a Slytherin the main problem here?” Blaise asked.
“You’d better not,” Hermione said. “And this is why you refused to go to Malfoy’s trial? Because you had broken up?”
“Dunno really,” Harry said and grimaced. “I mean, it’s obviously nice to see people and, erm, my boyfriend,” he said blushing. “And DA has been a lot of fun, but –”
Unwillingly, Draco took his pastry fork with a shaking hand and started to eat. The cake was probably as delicious as it looked like, but he couldn’t taste it at all. He felt like eating paper; he was just opening his mouth, chewing, and swallowing, not really realizing or caring about what he was putting into his mouth.
“Malfoy –”
“Are you sure he’s not going to gossip?” Draco asked after a while. “Maybe you should’ve threatened him a little,” Draco said squirming as if he knew Harry didn’t like the idea.
“Oh, poor boy, that’s horrible! How could they? He’s their only son!” Molly said, horrified, as she read the article over Ginny’s shoulder. “Should we ask if he wanted to stay here for a couple of days?”
Maybe there was something that could go right this year.
“I’m going to bed,” Harry told his friends, breaking the eye contact with Draco and dropping his cutlery on the plate with a loud clang.
Harry chuckled. “Just push the button with a red phone icon. Or I can do it as well.”
“I didn’t, actually, but now you’ve confirmed it,” Harry said, shrugging, as Draco pinched his arm, making him laugh. “Just asked Ginny what someone who’s perfectly capable of speaking English would like to tell me in another language, and she guessed.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Do you really think I can walk there on my own?” Maybe this could be fun after all, bossing Potter around.
“I’m flattered, seems like both of you have faith in me,” Blaise said, grinning. “Don’t worry, Draco. As you said it yourself, Snape isn’t going to tell, and neither am I. And Potter here seems to trust his house-elf friend.”
“Oh, please, as if Draco has ever managed to be discreet when it comes to you. He has tried, I can give him that, but with really poor success.”
“It’s okay. Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry said hoarsely. “I just saw a nightmare, nothing more serious than that.”
“Draco?” Ginny asked, sounding confused.
“Yeah, me too. And please, tell Ron as soon as you can.”
He had never actually been in the kitchens, but Harry had told him quite a few times how to get in there. It was supposed to be right under the Great Hall, behind a painting with a fruit bowl that had at least a pear in it.
The other thing he found in the gift was a pair of dark green leather gloves. Harry snorted. The slytherin colours seemed to be some sort of theme in Draco’s present. As he studied the gloves, he found a small note in them.
“Do you think You-Know-Who might’ve done something to him?”
“Must be quite a change compared to the beginning of the year, you know, when you still got to keep the room all by yourself.”
Being back at Hogwarts felt much worse than Draco had been able to imagine. He had tried to prepare himself mentally for not having friends and having people from all the Houses despising him, but it still felt much worse in real life than it had in his thoughts. He couldn’t say it didn’t hurt to be the target of the hexes from the other students or to hear them calling him a Death Eater scum, but it was much easier to bear that than seeing how his former friends had decided to start treating him. The only Slytherin students who had come back besides Draco and Blaise, who would come as soon as he got back from France, were Pansy, Greg and Theo, and they all had started to act like Draco was air or invisible to them, as if he didn’t exist at all. It made Draco feel so frustrated. Not that he would have tried to approach them, but every time he as much as stepped into the eight-year common room, they turned their gazes so that they couldn’t see Draco even from the corner of their eyes. Of course, Draco didn’t want his former friends to start hexing him or calling him names but being so completely ignored and shut out might actually have felt even worse. He didn’t know if their ignoring had anything to do with Draco’s funeral, but that was what he felt being to them now: dead.
Draco didn’t turn his gaze. Instead, he ignored Snape, continuing to look at the emptiness.
“She can be friends with whoever she wants,” Harry said simply.
Their trip to Diagon Alley didn’t help much, even though Harry saw Draco there, even twice. Actually, it only made Harry feel much, much worse. At first, they had seen Draco with his mother at Madam Malkin’s where Draco had acted like an outright prat towards Harry, Hermione and Ron, yelling insults at them and finally jerking his arm away from Madam Malkin’s hands, throwing the robes on the floor and exiting the shop with his mother. Harry had tried to tell himself it was only because it was a public place, and Draco’s mother was there as well as Harry’s friends who didn’t know about them, but it had still started to distress him how he hadn’t been able to see any sign of recognition in Draco’s eyes or in his gestures. A while later, Harry, Ron and Hermione had decided to follow Draco to Borgin and Burkes at Knockturn Alley where Draco had discussed something that hadn’t made any sense to Harry and his friends. Harry’s friends had forgotten all about Draco’s dubious visit at Knockturn Alley after a few days, but Harry was unable to stop thinking about it. The only thing he could be sure of by now was that something bad must have happened during the summer.
“Oh,” Hermione said, surprised. “What was he doing there?”
“Draco!” Harry cried, grabbing Draco’s collar. “What’s gone wrong? Why wasn’t he supposed to drink that?” he continued and felt abruptly paralyzed as a sudden realization hit him. “The mead wasn’t meant for Ron, was it?”
Until Draco suddenly remembered
Draco insulting his deceased mother. And everything only for, what? Keeping up appearances?
Draco took a deep breath in, smelling the morning dew in the air. He was shaking a little as the morning was rather chilly, or maybe Draco was just recovering from all the adrenaline that had been running through his veins for the whole previous day. Now it was the first time in about twenty-four hours he had time to really sit down and think about all that had happened.
“You listened to me now. Thank you,” Draco said, placing his hand on Harry’s knee. “I know how much you hate this,” he said, referring vaguely to his left arm.
“I’m not hungry, I just ate,” Draco said bluntly. Potter looked suspiciously at his breakfast tray, probably doubting every word Draco let out of his mouth. “Besides, weren’t you supposed to have a house-elf? Why are

Harry knew they
“Oh, yes. He’s been making sure the Boy Who Lived can’t get too scrawny,” Blaise said as he cut slices of apple pie for everyone. “He’s been surprisingly helpful, even after he got to know Draco is Harry’s ‘special friend’.”
“Watch me, Scarhead!” Malfoy exclaimed and with that, he was gone.
Ginny rolled her eyes before turning a parchment into a blue wrapping paper with silvery snowflakes that were floating slowly downwards.
Harry felt so exhausted. The lesson had been a nightmare so far and he knew that had only been the beginning of it. He was full of Snape’s lecturing and the disgust he could hear in Snape’s voice and see in his eyes.
“I… It’s probably better if I don’t come, I could stay behind,” Draco said in a strained voice.
Harry rolled his eyes once but remembered then Draco wasn’t able to see his reaction. “Probably, but that wouldn’t exactly be anything new,” he said. “So, how’s it going?”
“Yes. In many conservative religious groups, as well as in strict pureblood families, children learn really early how they should act to be accepted, so their brain cells create chains according to what people around them teach them. It’s really effective if all the people around you agree on what they teach you and if they’re showing you some sort of love and fondness; then it gets really manipulative. Children and teenagers are extremely vulnerable as they don’t usually have other models of thinking and they can’t criticize yet very well what other people tell them.”
“It’s nothing, let go of me,” Harry said, panicking and trying to jerk his arm away. Malfoy ignored him and rolled Harry’s bloody sleeve up with a fast, eloquent movement.
“Always so polite and eloquent,” Malfoy said a bit mockingly. “Ever heard of gatecrashers?”
“Already doing homework?” Harry asked, making Draco jump a little. “You know, it’s only the first week you nerd.”
Harry laughed. “Firefighters. It’s a Muggle profession.”
“Darling, you do realize you ask a lot of questions to which you already should know the answer?” Draco asked, amused. “Yes, these are from the kitchens. Dobby helped me.”
bad, he’s a teacher and wants only what’s best for you,” Hermione said, trying to comfort Harry, but making both Harry and Ron glare at her in disbelief instead. “Okey, well, maybe normal rules don’t apply to him.”
“Hey Ginny,” Harry said as he abruptly remembered something that had bothered him for some time now. “Can you speak any Norwegian?”
Harry & his slightly dramatic musings for the starting weekend, yay!
First ankles, after them calves, then thighs, and before Harry even realized, they were waist-deep in the water.
Harry nodded. “Haven’t seen Teddy in ages. I’ve heard he’s grown a lot.”
“I gathered that much. What do they do?”
Harry flushed slightly. “Couldn’t you call him by any other name?” he groaned. “But yeah, I think so. I’m actually going to see him now.”
“Sounds like an excuse to me. I’d guess your friend Granger would be able to tell the answer to my question right away.”
As soon as Harry came to the sixth-year boys’ dormitory, he slumped on his four-poster bed and shut the curtains tightly. He was so angry he felt his heart pounding wildly in his chest and he could see nothing but stars. The tears were prickling Harry’s eyes, but he closed them tightly. He wouldn’t shed a tear for Draco sodding Malfoy, he wouldn’t. How could he have been so stupid and trusted Draco? He had never let anyone come as close as Draco and now he had betrayed him. He should’ve seen this coming, there was no way Draco Malfoy could actually have felt something for him.
“Is that a bad thing?” Harry asked worriedly. Hermione didn’t often get speechless.
But hurting Harry had been something Draco never had wanted to experience and never wanted to experience again. The look on Harry’s face, so hurt, disbelieving and betrayed, had imprinted in his mind, haunting him both awake and when he was having nightmares, which was almost every night these days. Leaving Harry had felt like a piece of Draco had just died or gone lost, and he didn’t know how he could get it back. If he could ever get it back.
“The only problem seems to be that neither of us has a place where to charge the battery. But I’m sure it should last if we had the phones turned off always when we don’t use them.”
On the fifth of July, Harry sat at the kitchen table at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione, all three of them waiting nervously for an owl to bring the Daily Prophet. Each Sunday, the paper announced who would be executed next week and who they should therefore go and try to save by repeating the worn phrases of wrongness, cruelty, and illegality. Not that Harry had much hope left the Wizengamot would listen to them, it had just become rather a habit of sorts.
“Of course not,” Ginny said with a sing-song voice. “How did the night go?”
“Glad to hear that,” Ginny said, smiling softly. “I wish I had also someone to text to.”
“What do you mean?” Andromeda asked, sounding confused.
They didn’t move for a moment. Harry’s arms were tightly around Draco and his face on Draco’s hair as they were trying to steady their breaths. Draco’s hair was tickling Harry’s nose and he just smelled so good, like apples and summer. Harry felt like he could wrap himself in Draco’s smell, never more needing anything else.
“That’s alright. You can have all the time you need, and when you’re ready, you know we are here to support you,” Hermione said softly, radiating so much fondness and warmth Harry felt unbelievably happy to have a friend like her. “Have you told Ron yet?”
, Draco had started to think that maybe there was a tidbit of sense in Blaise and Ginny’s rants. They had gone through so much, he and Harry, so it’d be crazy to throw all that away because of a small, idiotic quarrel. Well, at least Snape had become happy as he had noticed the icy atmosphere between Draco and Harry.
Harry couldn’t yet quite understand what had happened. The alcohol had definitely made him much happier and more carefree, and he had just kind of let himself follow his feelings, not really caring about the consequences nor how rational it might be to kiss a person he had so mixed feelings for.
“If you could just listen to me,” Draco said, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry snapped it away.
“Yes,” Potter said. “When the Aurors notice you’re gone, they’ll assume you’re hiding somewhere on the island or that you’ve escaped on a broomstick, so they’ll probably start searching for you from here or from the sky.”
“What do you mean?”
“The hot one with red hair?” Zabini asked, seemingly enthusiastic. “Do you know if she’s single?”
All the times Draco had told Harry ‘jeg elsker deg’ and ‘I love you’.
Draco laid on the cold stone floor in the Room of Requirement, feeling exhausted. He had looked for Harry literally everywhere, but he couldn’t have found even a tiniest little hint of his location.
“Yes,” Harry said, his hand still feeling the form of the ring through his shirt. “The ring wasn’t even his, to begin with.”
“Your thoughts must be somewhere else?” Sirius asked, snapping Harry out of his thoughts.
“Potter,” Draco said coldly, squeezing Harry’s thigh under the table.
Coming to stand to Draco’s side, Harry’s eyes met the one person he could never have guessed to stand there on his threshold.
“Fucking Blaise,” Malfoy muttered and started playing absently with Harry’s hair. “Well, he’s always said I’m a little obsessed with you, though I really don’t get it. And he noticed I had a small breakdown at the Yule Ball when you stumbled into the Great Hall.”
“So now you see, I was right when I said Malfoy is –”
But the mere thought of leaving his family, as Sirius had done, made Draco get goosebumps. He knew he had never been an exceptionally brave person so he probably wouldn’t dare to leave them, and, besides, he didn’t even
Draco took a deep breath, grabbed the wall with both hands, and tried his best to heave himself up. His arms and legs began to tremble with effort, but eventually, he did manage to get himself to his feet.
But there had been something different about the dream last night.
It all began gradually.
“Don’t you fancy her back?” Ginny asked, squinting her eyes at Harry. “At the Yule Ball, you seemed to be interested, asked her to be your date and all.”
“Oh, don’t you care about Snivellus. He talks a lot of crap but in reality he’s totally harmless.”
“I did,” Granger said, cutting Draco off. “I wanted to talk with you about something.”
However, there were no wounds on Draco’s skin. Instead, there was something that couldn’t ever have crossed Harry’s mind; there was a fresh and strong Dark Mark.
“What do you want me to do? I can’t just suddenly start acting nice to you,” Malfoy exclaimed, looking desperate.
“I’m not there,” Draco said abruptly.
Harry gasped as a sinking feeling spread in his chest. It felt like he was unable to breathe. As if someone had just come and tried to strangle him all of a sudden.
Draco barked out a laugh. “Okay, so if the only word you can come up with to describe kissing a girl is wet, I don’t think I have too much to worry about.”
“Should I be worried he looks like such a fan of yours already? Based on his appearance he could be your brother,” Harry said as he came to stand next to the blanket.
“I know there are things you don’t tell me either, like those secret lessons with Dumbledore. Why don’t you tell me about them?”
,” he continued, and the Auror swayed a little as he got the full control of his mind and body back.
Six feet, three feet… Soon they were flying side by side, both stretching out their hands towards the small, golden ball, and Harry was sure he could already feel his fingertips touching the snitch’s fragile wings.
“And we weren’t young, then?”
“But there’s always a risk. I can’t risk my parents’ lives, I just can’t,” Draco said, looking devastated.
“How long have you guys already been here?” Harry asked.
“Me? Ridiculous?” Draco said coolly, raising his eyebrow. “If you’ve already ogled enough, you may as well leave now. I’m actually quite busy, you know. I still have to count the stones in the ceiling once more.”
“It doesn’t matter if we like Malfoy or not. We like
like it,” Draco said, frustrated. “Alright, so, I’ll thank her again for the present. Can we go to yours after that? I feel emotionally drained after all this… sappiness.”
Harry rolled his eyes and smacked Draco’s head lightly. “No, you git. I just…” Harry gulped, feeling somewhat nervous. “Er, what do you think about Ginny?”
“Don’t touch me,” Harry said, seething. “Get the hell away from me,” he said, turned around and left Draco alone in the compartment.
“Bullshit. You do know mum, she’s only happy when she gets to feed you,” Ron said, grinning. “I think I should go, I promised to help George at the shop,” he went on, getting up from the chair. “See you tomorrow!” he said, waving his hand as he started to walk towards the front door.
They stared at each other for a long while, and Draco felt himself getting almost petrified as he held his breath, not daring to move or say anything.
“I can see you’re not,” Sirius said, and Harry just shrugged. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Secondly, I know Draco's decision to leave Harry may have raised quite different kinds of feelings, and it may seem strange how Harry will be able to forgive him (as this goes with the tag "angst with a happy ending" it's no surprise it will happen at some point). I had actually thought to explain my reasoning a bit in a few chapters (when the characters have had the time to discuss Draco's case so I won't spoil anything). BUT I can assure you I actually have thought about his choice a lot and I’m comparing his path to real-life experiences & life paths (I’m not just randomly making up things out of nowhere), which is why I found his decision to leave Harry much more believable than the alternative.
Draco snorted. “And what exactly would you do if I told you I needed your help? Ride here on your broomstick like Prince Charming and get me out of here?”
Harry sighed heavily. “I’m not sure. All I know is that he and a bunch of Death Eaters have been visiting at the Manor, but Draco told me Voldemort hardly notices him while he’s there,” he said and kicked a stone, frustrated. “I wish I could
Draco chuckled. “I’ll try my best. So, Valentine’s Day, you, me, Blaise and the Weasley – er – Weasley?” Draco said, trying to come up with some new name to call Ginny.
“That’s really nice of her.”
“So, a vodka drinker then?” Malfoy asked, watching pointedly Harry’s glass that was now filled to the brim.
, Hermione had once told Harry.
The look on Draco’s face turned from annoyed to pained in a matter of seconds. “Please, Harry, don’t let this come between us,” he said, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry jerked it away.
Eventually, he found an old, rusty bread knife and grabbed it with shaking hands. This would do. This should be good enough.
“I meant the stars. Have you ever seen so many of them at once?” Draco asked.
“This is going too far. I can’t be with someone who’s trying to kill another person,” Harry said, feeling the anger starting to make his head hurt.
“C’moon, get up,” Ron said, offering his hand.
“I can’t really tell you much about his private matters, but he was also kind of disowned. Got thrown out from his family for the same reason as I did,” Draco said, shrugging. “Without a funeral, though,” he added grimly.
“How? And how do
As Harry neared the table, he spotted Draco standing in front of it, scrutinizing the selection of the bottles.
The story about the Northern Lights is based on a belief I think several indigenous peoples in North America used to believe. I read the story a few years ago and thought it was beautiful, so I felt like I wanted to include it in my story. Also, I planned what kind of ending I’d write for this story in December when all this coldness and darkness made much more sense than now as I’m currently dying from the heat in my apartment.
“Yes, just a second. We’re trying to make these lazy-asses gather their strength to get up,” Ginny said.
“He almost was,” Draco said grimly.
“But you said you didn’t fancy the idea of flying on any sort of a Muggle invention?” Harry asked, but Draco, who was now completely relaxed and breathing calmly, was already too far away in his dreams to be able to answer.
