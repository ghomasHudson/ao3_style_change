Draco looked at her a little heatedly. He was pissed that he was being called 'Tom'. "Why do you people keep calling me Tom?"
Trying to distract himself from the negative thoughts, he began washing his body with soap until he felt he was clean enough to turn off the taps and dry his body so he can get into his warm long-sleeved pyjamas. He then proceeded back to the dormitory where he snuck in, searched through his trunk for the weighted blanket to try it out.
Harry made his way up to the Divination tower, climbed up the ladder into the classroom and decided to find a place to sit for when the lesson starts. Sooner than later, everyone who's in his Divination class started arriving. First Lavender, Dean, Seamus, Ron, and the others. Harry completely ignored Ron, whilst Ron ignored Harry back. That was fine to him.
Fred shook his head. He doesn't mind at all. He actually wanted to join George with the music player and surprise everyone with funny songs. "Not at all, go and have fun!"
Harry got interrupted by Ron and their conversation which he was sitting up and wiping his eyes from sleep. "Harry, we have a long walk ahead of us tomorrow," he told his best mate sleepily, and his eyes were half-open. "Get some sleep."
Harry decides that he should try the spell to make his cuts disappear just so he knows how to do the spell in case he needed it in the future. He twists his torso and reaches for his wand on his bedside table. He then looks back at his cuts and says goodbye to them as he points his wand at the cuts on his arm. "Vulnus Expleret", he whispers and sways his wand up and down his arm. It does nothing and he tries again. "Vulnus Expleret!" It doesn't work and he starts losing hope a little. He then tries one more time, swaying his wand up and down his arm which then faded his cuts and turned them into scars. It was intriguing to watch but he also missed seeing the red fresh cuts on his arms. At least he could cast the spell easily. It was a simple spell anyway.
Draco wrapped his arm around his cousin to give her a side hug. "I know, I'm sorry you have to go through this alone," he said gently. "I wish I could do something about her," he said, sharply. In a softer voice, he asked, "Should we head to bed? It's going to be a big day tomorrow." He let a yawn escape his mouth. "And we can talk more about...stuff...after the Quidditch World Cup".
Harry woke up feeling exhausted after waking up from another nightmare. He felt like his body had just run miles whilst he was sleeping. Usually, Harry always kept his curtains down, around him, as he slept. It had always felt safe to him like nothing could get him.
When he got inside Moaning Myrtle's Bathroom, he scanned the bathroom and didn't see anybody else. Well, who would be down here? Good. He needs to be alone. He paced around the room, feeling rushes of anxiety course through him from the dream he had last night and the knowledge that Nott, Goyle, and Crabbe could be doing anything to Draco right now. He hoped Blaise was with Draco.
Hermione waved her hand in front of Harry's eyes to try and stop him from thinking deeply. "Hello? Earth to Harry. Snap out of it!" she said agitatedly and wrinkled her brow. "Stop staring at that apple and eat it already!"
Harry didn’t last very long since he’s been getting harder in his lower regions ever since he rutted against the Slytherin earlier. When he finally came rocketing into Draco’s mouth, leaving him huffing and puffing with his head resting on the chair back, Draco eagerly swallowed it all down and walked over to his trunk to quickly do his tie and put on his Slytherin robe.
Blaise leaned against the tree, deep in thought as he knows how rude Ron had been to Harry by calling him a faggot and a poof. Not that poof really means anything. "Okay, but he said such cruel things about homosexuality," he reminded the Gryffindor. "I will try to do what you ask of me." He pointed a finger at him, "But I still hate you."
Draco ignored Harry and went inside the bathroom. The first thing he sees was himself looking back in a dusty mirror. He ran a hand through his hair and totally wasn't doing it to impress a certain green-eyed Gryffindor who's down here with him.
"Oh, I'm-" was all Harry managed to choke out before the first jet of hot, salty come coated the back of Draco's throat. "Draco!" Harry bellowed, pushing him that last fraction of an inch so that he fell headlong over his own edge and came himself, grinding his enclosed bulge into his grasping hand frantically, as though the motion could make him orgasm any harder.
He chose to get back up and try to walk through this hell maze without. He began walking through the maze; turning left, right, left, and right again. What he wanted to know is why such a hell of a maze could be in such a beautiful garden. He hasn't the slightest idea why anyone, not even Helga Hufflepuff would put such a maze in this garden of Amare.
"Good morning, Harry," Draco says warmly with a smile as he comes up to Harry. Why does Harry have his hood over his head when it's not even raining outside? He quickly glances around the corridors for any oncoming students but sees no one. "How are you?"
"Good afternoon, professor," the students all chorused and some of them tried to read what the professor had written. It was actually a little hard to read since she writes so small.
With a click, the door opened to what looked like a beautiful large pristine garden, with long meadows of flowers, a pond, and a white painted gazebo. Draco and Harry both cast a quick "Nox" to take away the light from their wands as they smiled at the beautiful scenery before them, smelling the different types of smells and listening to the different noises the garden had to offer.
"Merlin, professor." Dean tried to regain his breath from the surprise attack. Even the pranking was scaring him a little. Harry really had good ideas, Merlin! "Nearly gave me a heart attack."
"It's perfect, Draco," Harry says and smiles while he cuts a thin piece of feta cheese and puts it on a cracker with a piece of salami. It's all so fancy and new to him. He's never had a picnic before in his life, so this is his first and it's with Draco. "And even if you didn't help organize the food, it's still perfect and I wouldn't have it any other way."
Dobby grinned at Ivy, already beginning to warm up to her even if he could sence the other side of her. "Dobby likes her, she is very nice," The house-elf said and glanced at Draco, looking for some sort of sign for mischief but there wasn't any that he could see.
"Oh, nothing," Draco said with a smirk. He pondered what Harry felt when he pressed his leg up at Harry's. Did it give him a funny feeling in his pants or something else?
"I'm just bored, that's all," Harry said as he looked up at Ron, closed 'Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4' and placed it on the bedside table. How long had Ron been up for? Since 5 am? 4 am? Hopefully not because that's pretty early to be up at. Well, early for Ron. But for Harry, not so much.
With a slight nod, Draco led Harry out of the secret room in the library to the Kitchens. They didn't want to be bombarded with questions about where they've been all day when they could have gone to the Great Hall, so they went to the kitchens instead. As they arrived, after tickling the pear in the portrait of the fruit bowl, Dobby came into view wearing all these weird socks on his feet, ears, and arms. It was obviously Hermione's doing.
"Yes, we will see each other soon," Draco says with a near dreamy-like smile towards the Gryffindor. When Harry turns around to leave, Draco grabs his books from his father and proceeds to the apparition point in Diagon Alley.
He quickly pulled on a long-sleeved grey shirt and black jumper, feeling a little self-depreciated about himself. He looked over to Draco who gave him a small comforting smile and Harry returned the smile, seeing Draco still in his green silk pyjamas. "Can't you accio your clothes here?"
"Narcissa?" Harry asked worriedly. He could just see the tiniest of black under her eyes. "Are you alright? You seem..."
"I pay attention," Harry said but he even sounded unsure of himself. He's usually too depressed to even listen to the professors during class or daydreaming about Draco and dream dates he could go on with him. Its' usually the daydreaming and the depressing thoughts muddled together.
Harry tried to find something like a torch or a light switch but there was nothing nearby. The only thing he could do in this situation was cast an easy spell. "Lumos!" He whispered and sent out five balls of light around the room. He only saw a glimpse of furniture like a round mat in front of them, something large at the end of the room, and a few small plants.
"Where's the professor who will teach us Defense against the Dark Arts?" Hermione asked, looking up at the professor's table for the new DADA professor as they had just entered the castle for the Welcome back feast.
"Draco," Ivy says like she has regained her ability to speak after the shocking... she didn't know what she saw or if her brain or eyes was playing tricks on her. "Y-You were gone. But then you came back... What the bloody hell happened to you? One minute you were here, then you disappeared and now you're back."
{I'd never let it go.} Draco felt like he could see into Harry's soul, a soul so pure and saintly. He wants to get to know this soul, this handsome person and have him in his life. He wants to bring him home to meet his parents. Well, not right now since the Dark Lord currently resides at Malfoy Manor, his home since childhood. He wants to run away with Harry, Floo to his family manor in Australia or America. Jus somewhere far away and only invite his mother over for a few times. Right now, he cannot trust his father, being the literal right-hand man for the Dark Lord. He hates his father for it.
About 10 minutes later, a letter came flying through the Greenhouse but it wasn't delivered by owl. Draco grabbed the letter in hid-air as it flew towards him and read it. He began feeling tears form in his eyes and run down his face like little rivers. How could she do this? Where was she? What happened to her?
Harry was a little shocked. He didn't think this would happen. All he had thought was asking Fred or George to be his Yule Ball partner, one of the twins agreeing to go with him, and then he goes off to class. Easy. But now Fred made it harder on him. How great.
Hedwig hooted and gave Harry a friendly peck. She wasn't dumb. She could practically sense the emotions in humans and the vibes she was getting from her owner told her something was up. What she lacked was the ability to read minds then she'll be able to figure out why her owner looks so down all the time.
"I think it wants us to go right," said Blaise, not taking his eyes off the killer who death stared at him. Merlin, these things were creepy. But he was stabbed so how could he be alive?
Teddy threw his arms around Harry again for another hug, and Harry sighed and looked up at the two older woman who smiled back at him from on the other side of the room. "Ted, I really have to go now."
Harry felt his cheeks start to warm up, knowing he was blushing, and the worst part was hearing Ivy getting the giggles and Blaise snorting at them. "Stop staring then!" he said in a loud but soft voice and rubbed the side of his neck.
Draco glared angrily at Pansy and then turned to leave towards where Harry had gone to. But really, he could not find Harry anywhere. He guessed the green-eyed wizard had gone to Gryffindor Tower. It was a shame; he really was really worried about Harry. Especially how the Gryffindor hissed like he was in pain. Merlin, he would cut Pansy's nails off in her sleep if they were that sharp. Scratchy little git!
Joslyn looked into his silvery-blue eyes. She never expected to actually look at Draco Malfoy up closely. His eye colour is so rare, it's like she's looking at the moon. No wonder Harry likes him. She then remembered the question he asked her. "Uhm... well, all I can say that you're not in the United Kingdom anymore."
Draco pried Harry's lips apart gently with his own, experimentally sliding his tongue across Harry's bottom lip. The Slytherin slid his tongue past Harry's lips, caressing Harry's tongue with his own, that was all Harry could feel except Draco's soft warm hand on his cheeks and it was extraordinary. With one last swipe of Harry's lip, Draco pulled away, his face flushed, and he licked his lips, loving the taste of Harry Potter.
"Oh, yeah," said Harry, rubbing at his arm from under his sleeve. "Um..." He pointed behind him to the Great Hall, wanting to get away because he feels a little awkward talking about Draco like this. He loves talking about Draco or talking with Draco but talking behind the Slytherin's back is a no-go zone for him. "I'm going to go that way..."
Ron just shrugged. He just tried his best. It wasn't that hard honestly. "Thanks, but it is pretty easy once you get the hang of it."
"Alright," said Harry, sighing as he didn't know of any other ways. Unless... "How about I take you to a muggle therapy session? You only have to tell them about your depression and if they ask how Fred died, say by a gun shooting."
Cedric paused and took a moment to think about this. "Maybe not to you or me, but to Draco," he said and shrugged. "You remember how Draco snuck into the tents after the first task? He pretended it was to see me, but he wanted to know how badly you were hurt. Something to think about."
Draco, Pansy, Ivy, and Blaise moved away from the three Gryffindors so Harry, Hermione, and Ron could take a trio photo together. Hermione was in the middle of her two friends when the picture was being taken and they grinned at the camera. Then the trio went to the side so the four Slytherins could have their little group picture taken.
Hannah smiled at the two from under her pumpkin head. Oh, how she wishes Suzan were into girls. She sighed happily, turned her black mare, Nightshade, around and trotted away.
"You scared him off!" Ivy spat at her cousin, pointing a finger at Harry's leaving figure. "You idiot! You could have befriended him then or even better. Asked him the hell out."
Madam Pomfrey looked Ivy in her black eyes and nodded, smiling at the thought of having a being in Hogwarts and as a student. It excited her. Of course, over the years there have been a few students who are half and halves. "Okay," she said and when biting harder on her lip, she poked her thumb with a needle and watched as the girl's black eyes turned blood red.
Harry laughed at her words and what she called Ron. He hasn't heard anybody in Hogwarts swear using muggle language before. Not even Hermione he's heard swearing from. It's like she's a Christian or has Christian parents.
"Yeah, we'd love to hear another song," Neville said quietly, feeling a little sad as he'd been left out of the conversation. But he knew he shouldn't as he'd been asked questions by a number of people around him.
Joshua nodded in agreement with him. The Ministry is a tough place full of secrets and lies. "Speaking of the ministry, I was thinking of becoming an Auror after I graduate."
"All I'm going to say is that he really likes Quidditch and has two main best friends", Draco said, watching as the library's giant door came into view but also looking at Harry's reaction. The Gryffindor was just staring at the floor as they neared the library. "But...he gained a new best friend a couple of weeks ago," he added and as a strand of hair fell into his face, he pushed it back.
"Oh, I'm sure she wouldn't mind at all," Draco said and could see the uncertain look on Harry's face. He just wanted to scream out to Pansy that he didn't need to go with her anymore and that Harry just asked him. If only it were that easy.
Harry shrugged and smiled, remembering the feel of Draco's warm hands around his own. "I asked him, and he said he fought Ron because he was mad that Ron was talking to me again," he told the Hufflepuff. "I don't get it."
Draco could only laugh at Nick. He remembered telling Nick about LGBTQ+ a year ago, even if he was four. Nick took it extremely well, even when Draco came out to him as being gay.
He knew the Draught of the Living Death would be the potion that you fall into a deep death-like sleep and that you'd have to be kissed by a person with the antidote on their lips. He'd love to be kissed by Harry when he's sleeping and then wake up still kissing him. It would be like a dream; he'd be the princess and Harry would be the prince. Well, he didn't want to be the princess. It was more on the lines of him and Harry both being princes.
"You know when our date is?" asked Harry. But then he felt a little stupid at what he said. Of course, Narcissa would know! Draco probably would have told her. The thought of Draco made him blush, especially when thinking about how Draco would talk to Narcissa about him and the date on Tuesday.
Before Harry could make it up to the castle, Viktor walked up to him with a smile on his face. " 'Ello," he said, making Harry stop and turn around. He had something to ask but it was a little hard to ask in English.
"Draco, I didn't mean that but...you can do that with him if you want," Pansy said a little hastily with a smirk. "I won't stop you. I was just adding onto what you and Harry could do, to get to know each other a little more."
Harry smiled at the red tinge to Draco's cheeks, not knowing what that was but really liked it as he found it very attractive. He could just look at him for eternity, not that it's creepy or anything. This Draco he was getting to know... He really likes him. He wants to get to know Draco better from the git he knew.
Seamus and Dean gave each other lovingly stares and intertwined their hands from under the table. Harry saw this and thought it was kind of... sweet. While lavender, Goyle, Crabbe, Parvati and Nott were all glaring at each other.
There was silence throughout the Great Hall, deafening silence. Harry couldn't believe what was happening. He felt every head in the Great Hall turn to look at him. He stared at the piece of paper Dumbledore held that had his own name written on it in disbelief. He did no such thing. He never touched the goblet or stepped into the ring. He couldn't.
Harry nodded. He knew a lot of things about Draco just by observing him. He knows what the blonde likes to eat, his favourite dessert and breakfast. "So, may I ask who this guy is you're wanting to help?" He couldn't quite help feeling a little jealous for whoever this guy Draco wants to help out.
They kept running until Joslyn heard that Draco had stopped and was staring at something... Or someone...
Harry sat down next to Draco. He looked into the bucket of worms; the bucket was filled with dirt, but no worms were encountered. "Have you done this before?" He looked over at Draco who was staring into the bucket with distaste.
They thought this was just a normal room, but really, it wasn't. The Tv turned on. Everyone looked up at the tv, not knowing what exactly it is or what's going on. The tv showed black and white static lines. Then a picture formed. It was in a cemetery with a marked grave. But they couldn't see whose name was on the headstone.
"Yes, now! Go!" Hermione said sternly, and pointing to the exit of the common room. Harry took that as a warning and proceeded out of the Common Room. He didn't want to go and talk to anybody right now; he was feeling a bit too depressed too. He noted to himself that he should go and see Dumbledore soon, just not now.
As soon as Dumbledore finished speaking, a group of females and males in baby blue robes sprung out from the Entrance Hall and made their way into the Grand Hall whilst sitting down at the Ravenclaw table. Their abnormally tall Headmistress went up to talk to Dumbledore.
Draco smiled at this knowledge and returned his head to Harry's shoulder and intertwined their hands together from under the table.
Harry shrugged as he folded up the cloak and placed it on the back of the couch. He didn't want to just dump it there and make Draco think that he was messy. Then he sat beside Draco with his body facing the Slytherin and said, "Something easy, I guess."
"You too, Blaise," said Harry who smiled back. "I didn't realize you and Neville were together. How long for?"
Draco moaned when still feeling Harry inside him and gripped the bedsheets. "I love you, Harry James Potter."
Joslyn sighed in relief, thinking he was going to ask her how to put them on. Oh, how weird and embarrassing that would be. She would have rather died on the spot if that happened.
Draco's silver eyes were sparkling with mixed emotions and it only made Harry lean further down until their lips were only inches away. He doesn't realize how hard his heart is thumping against his chest until he felt Draco's breath on his face. He apprehended what it looked like he was about to do, and he subconsciously wedged his knee in between Draco's thighs.
"You better," Pansy muttered under her breath though Draco could hear her clearly. "We've been waiting since you two became friends. No, in fact even longer than that." Draco sighs and looks over at Harry, he just can't help it. He catches the Herbology professor talking to Harry and Draco freezes again, hoping his professor wasn't telling Harry about what she saw on the piece of parchment he had and used.
Harry quickly grabbed onto the boot as ordered to by Mr Diggory and in a matter of seconds, it felt like he was riding a roller coaster and it looped, continuously. He landed on the ground with a thud, Hermione, and Ron after him. He looked up to see Mr Weasley, Mr Diggory and Cedric just casually walking through the air, down to the ground like they use Portkeys every day.
The professor looked up at his student, he knew Dean and Seamus were good friends. Very good friends actually. He's seen them snogging in the halls which surprises him a little. Of course, he has had to teach a lot of LGBTQ+ students in the past and present and he finds them quite extraordinary. "Very well, Mr Thomas," he said in a squeaky voice. "Be quick! This will be an exciting lesson!"
Draco looked over at Joslyn, puzzled, then he understood why she had lied to her mother. "It's a pleasure to meet you," he said kindly, showing Joslyn's mother his hand for her to shake like he was some posh kid, which he was but he didn't really need to act that way.
Draco watched as Harry left the Great Hall. He didn't know what happened but something in his gut told him to go after his boyfriend. "I'm going after Harry," he whispered to both Ivy and Pansy. "Remember how I told both of you earlier throughout breakfast that I found he has..."
Harry laughed and lightly ran his fingers down Draco's spine, thinking of all the rather sexual rooms he can think of for sexual activities with Draco. "Mm-hmm." He could think of a few rather kinky rooms involving tying Draco up to things while he fucks him or the other way around. He wondered if the room can make Dildos appear. He’s never masturbated with a dildo before and it sounds interesting. He’s wanked in the shower before when thinking of Draco when he was alone up in Gryffindor Tower.
"Mhm," Harry mumbles and thinks about that spot Ivy's talking about. It's just the clock Tower though but he understands why she likes the place. You can see a lot from just that spot, even if the Astronomy Tower's a better place to go to. "So how have you been doing?"
Draco looked over at Harry, knowing this potion was hard to brew. It was N.E.W.T. Level potion after all. He was so caught up in watching Harry, he remembered he hadn't finished his own potion. He shook his head and focused his attention back on the potion. He managed to finish the potion in a minute by adding the Refined Peppermint Oil and the moonstone.
"I'm gay..." Harry blurted out to them. He was in his bedroom. He felt his face redden and panic creep inside him, so he looked down at the floor. He wondered how Ron and Hermione would react now that he'd come out to them.
"It was mine too," said Draco, and he reaches a hand up to brush a strand of dark hair away from Harry's green eyes which shined almost unnaturally. He believes it's beautiful even if they somehow manage to shine in the dark. "And I'm glad it was with you, Harry." He hesitated a little and smirks. "Merlin, that sounds cheesy."
Draco watched as the maze sealed himself in so he decided to begin walking. He doesn't know when he would be able to see Harry again, but he knows he will. Whatever happens, they will see each other in the end. When walking further into the maze, it began twisting and turning. Turning left, right, left, left again and right. It just kept on twisting and turning until he got to this park looking room.
Harry smiled at Ron and agreed with the both of them that he was tired, "Yes, I'll be there in a minute," he said as he watched Ron shrug and walk with Hermione to Gryffindor Tower, leaving only Harry and Draco alone...
"Anyway, get out your wands and practice on these jewellery boxes," the professor said as he levitated everyone a dark blue velvet jewellery box with little diamonds covering the fabric from beside his desk.
"I do too!" Ivy said gleefully, expressing her excitement with a wide grin. The croissant she was holding, she squeezed it a bit too hard so it looked like a stick but edible. "Please, tell us! I love a good romantic story."
When he finished, he went back down into the dormitory and decided to 'do a Hermione' and read his new textbooks for the year. He thought it would be good to know what he is up against throughout the year.
"I don't know how to Tango," said Harry, breaking eye contact from the twin he's dancing with just to look below him at the floor. He was a little disappointed in himself for not knowing how to dance. It should be easy, right? Just a few dance moves.
Cedric watched the two boys in awe as he knew there was lots of chemistry with them two. "My good side is telling me we should leave them alone but the other side of me is saying we should go over and act surprised," He told her and gave her a smirk. There was a second of hesitation for him, and he thought for a minute. "Yeah, let's go and intrude. I don't think they both know the other likes them back."
Draco didn't need Harry to tell him what to do. He'd happily give his all to Harry any day. After closing the drapes around each other, they rid themselves of their clothes one by one until they were butt naked and kissing passionately in the slight darkness of Harry's bed.
Hermione giggled a little at her lovestruck best friend. She just enjoyed watching her best friend fawn over Malfoy. "Honestly, Harry," she whispered over the table to him in a low voice. "Just ask him out. It can't be that hard."
Draco looked up at the roof in the sixth-years boy dormitory. There's that weird lady talking again. What the hell is going on? What Weapons? What is this woman talking about? He decided to head out of the Slytherin common room to investigate a little bit, but to also find Harry. Whatever a Purge is, he needed to find Harry just in case.
Harry watched as Cedric left, really feeling as if the friendship was slipping away slowly. He sighed sadly and made his way back up to the Grand Hall. Cedric didn't believe him. That's all he thought. Throughout the months getting to know this boy, he actually accepted the friendship. It was nice having someone to talk to, just not about his mental health problems. There's so much pressure on Harry, he could easily injure himself or worse, die from these tasks.
Even though Harry liked Hagrid, he really didn't know what use knowing how to take care of a Blast-Ended-Skrewt would be for him. All the lessons were pretty much the same, Malfoy being a typical git as always, but Harry couldn't help but stare at the blonde Slytherin Wizard throughout the lessons he had with him. He was as attractive as he's always been with his hair looking perfect - perhaps too perfect, silvery eyes filled with the same hateful emotions, the way he walks, talks, lives in general.
Both girls stood up immediately out of excitement and started jumping up and down, squealing. Then they looked at each other and embraced each other in a hug. "Oh my god!"
"Wait..." said Nick, rubbing at his eyebrows in confusion. "Since you just met now... does this mean you're not boyfriends?"
"No," said a young girl's voice from beside them. Harry, Fred, and George looked down at Savannah, and she was with her best friend Chelsea and a girl from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. "It's to infinity and beyond!" she beamed, and Chelsea laughed from beside her.
Hermione saw her friend zone out of reality and into his own thoughts. She furrowed her eyes worriedly at Harry but left him to his thoughts, knowing he doesn't like being disturbed in this state. So, she continued eating her porridge and sipping her green tea.
"Oh," moaned Harry, and while panting heavily he looked around the kitchen, knowing they were probably being watched by all the house-elves who were invisible to them. Oh, poor Dobby and Winky. Then he rested his forehead on the table, parting his lips at the pleasure. "Very kinky, Draco," he whispers to the wooden table. "A blowjob under the table and we're surrounded by house-elves."
Ivy couldn't help but feel sorry for this girl so she wrapped her arms around her, giving her the best hug she could give. She smelt so sweet like candies and chocolate. It was addicting. "It's okay, people have their own opinions. They're terrible, but it's only their opinions. If it makes you feel better, I'm a lesbian." She couldn't believe she told her that. Yes, now she knows, and it could possibly be the worst thing she has ever said to this girl.
Lavender felt a blush run up her cheeks. It's thrilling to know that Ivy has been thinking of her. "So, what are you and Draco going to do tomorrow once we get away from everyone?" she then asks quietly just so she's not heard by anyone else.
Harry walked up to the Willow Tree and felt its leaves. It was beautiful, like green gems hanging from thin bits of string. He pushed his way through the hanging leaves of the Willow, he walked back and looked up at where the leaves would end. He felt something hard bump against his back. Harry turned around to come face-to-face with a smiling Draco Malfoy.
Harry pressed their bodies together under the raining shower, placed an arm around Draco's neck, and his other arm rubbed at Draco's thigh. But then he notices something that he should have taken care of earlier. His cuts were showing but since he hadn't cut in a few days they weren't as red. But they still were noticeable. He felt himself panic even if he knows the Slytherin knows of his depression and what started it.
Harry hugged back with a smile. He loves Draco's hugs more than anything in the world. It's where he felt at home. "You know I love you, right?" he asked his Slytherin, his breath ghosting on Draco's neck.
Harry laughed at the snake, but it wasn't a real laugh as he felt too down. "Ssso, you're not going to bite me?" he had to ask as he knows snake bites hurt. That bloody Basilisk.
Hermione looked over her shoulder at the Slytherins, glaring at them. "We better get to work before Professor Sprout decides to take more points," she said, and her two friends agreed with her with a nod. Ron walked back to the table and up-righted the pot of soil that had spilled.
Harry nodded, grabbed a vile from on his desk and filled it up with his potion. It definitely was see-through, like the potion was actually invisible. With a smile, he scooped the leftover potion into another vile. He was about to take a sip, but he felt someone very close to him, like right next to him. It was kind of scary like a ghost was watching him. He put his vile down on his desk and popped a corkscrew in it so the liquid wouldn't spill out.
Harry and Draco stood hand in hand in front of the closed door of the Great Hall. They both were nervous, about to come out to the entire school. Then Harry decided to open the doors with one light push. The brown large wooden doors opened up into the Great Hall, and they walked through to the Slytherin table. A few gasps were heard, and a few giggles. Harry and Draco didn't care what the others thought about them. It wasn't any of their business anyway.
The three Slytherins backed away, forgetting they were in a spinning tunnel which moved as they turned around and struggled to run out of the moving tunnel. Blaise was the first out, but also the first to face a cloaked figure with a long white mask. He screamed and backed away.
"As much as I don't want to, I would rather go back," Draco said with a frown, really hate the thought of knowing that monster and his big snake was slithering throughout his family's house. "Can we like... redesign the inside of the house that...he...has been in? Paint the walls a different colour, like... a nice midnight blue or a forest green?"
"I'm amazed when I look at you, Harry," Draco says and leans towards Harry's ear so the green-eyed Gryffindor could hear what he wanted to say more clearly. "Not just because of your looks, but because of the fact that everything I've ever wanted is right in front of me."
Harry quickly nodded, now knowing of the other side of Draco. it wasn't scary, nor was it calm. But he loved it. "I will be. And 7:40 on the dot."
Pansy looked up at Hermione in surprise and gave her a smirk. She likes where this is going. "Sounds like a date," she said, fluttering her eyelashes at her but then noticed Ivy wasn't around so then she looked at Draco. "Draco, where's Ivy? I haven't seen her since yesterday when we were doing homework together in the common room."
"Those are some strong words of advice, Harry," George said, wiping away the tears but they just kept on coming. "Thanks."
"I didn't! You know I can't get past the age line, it's impossible! You have to believe me!" Harry told him truthfully, feeling as if the friendship he gained with Cedric was slipping away. Why does nobody believe him? He's just a youngling after all.
"Thanks," Harry replied sadly and placed his elbow on the table, resting his chin on his hand and looked down at the other letters that could hold hate-mail. He'll save the others for when he's alone so he can wallow in self-pity and keep them to he can review them later on in the day.
"Granger!" he called halfheartedly. Perhaps the muggle-born knows where Harry is. She should know. She is Harry's friend after all.
Ron narrowed his eyes at his girlfriend and his face reddened. "Who the hell are you talking about?"
Cho then didn't know what to do, all she thought about was giving them a shocked face, not anything else. "Uhm... Hi!" she said, she looked over at Cedric and gestured him to come over to her with a nod.
"You may commence, read the instructions carefully," Snape said coldly, looking directly at Neville and Harry who he knew will mess up the potion.
Harry sighed at her. He should have known she would Accio her food to her. "He is honestly so amazing; I wish that they were dates but no," he says, a little disappointed. He pretends their dates though. "He's been helping me improve with Potions."
"Okay, Harry," Draco said with a blush still lingering on his cheeks, a loving smile, and a heart that's continuously hammering against his chest. He would never calm his racing heart at all, even if it's because of Harry who's making him feel this way.
"Oh," said Draco, giving a pained look towards the bucket filled with soil and worms. "Wait... why doesn't your Aunt plant flowers in her garden herself and make you do them? That's a little unfair, isn't it?"
"Thanks again, Hermione," Harry said as he forced another smile at her. He didn't believe him at all. He doesn't deserve someone so incredible and beautiful like Draco.
"So, Harry," Hermione said with a curious and slow smile that builds. She still doesn't know if Harry's going with anyone yet. Her first guess is a certain blonde Slytherin. She doesn't have any other guesses though. Who knows? Harry might surprise her. "Who are you going with?"
Harry could have laughed at the wording Ivy used instead of 'shagging' or 'sex'. It was pretty funny actually seeming as it has 'The devil' in it as well as 'Tango' which is a type of odd muggle dance.
"You get no food for a week, boy!" Uncle Vernon roared at Harry, hit him with the belt again then left the room.
Ivy nodded sadly, making note to check with Harry every so often. If there really is something going on with Harry, she and Draco will find it out but in their own ways. "As in normal skinny or too skinny for his age?"
“Draco sssaysss that you have a really cool name, and I think ssso too, obviousssly! Alssso, Draco and I have to depart asss dinner isss almossst ready. SSSorry.”
"Oh, we know," Hermione said with a proud smile. After all, she is the brightest and smartest witch of her age.
"Mhm," Harry managed to mumble again. He really doesn't want to deal with anything or anybody right now. He just wants to be alone, away from everybody, away from the world. Except away from Draco. He really likes him and when he found that heart on the blonde's parchment... he doesn't know what to feel. He just feels relieved somehow.
Hermione rolled her eyes in aggravation. Oh, how she wishes to find Pansy and snog her in front of Ron just to see his reaction.
"You. Me. Alone. Walking," Harry spelled out. He just wanted to spend some time with his boyfriend since he won't have time to. The last task was in two days and he had a lot of revising to do.
Draco smiled widely at Harry and gave him another kiss on the cheek in approval of this. "Harry, I am so proud of you for telling me this instead of bottling it all up inside." He grabbed ahold of Harry's chin, so Harry would look him in the eye. "You are so brave, kind, caring, beautiful, smart - in your own way. You are loved by so many people, Harry. I love you and I'd hate to see you disappear from existence." He felt tears form in his eyes at that depressing thought but blinked them away.
"Shame," Harry said and looked at Draco who was walking beside him. "I like discovering new places."
Draco angled his hips up sharply and wrapped his legs below Harry's waist. He hooked his heels together in the small of Harry's back and pulled him in. As he tightened his legs, Harry's cock breached him further, rubbing him in all the right places on the way. Every part of his body screamed for Harry. Even his mouth. He gasped raggedly, "Fuck me," as he felt the brutal thrust of several more inches embedding inside him.
"Exactly!" Draco looked back into Harry's green eyes which were staring at a patch of grass. He smiled and trailed his eyes down to Harry's cheeks which look so soft and kissable. He just wanted to run his fingers down Harry's cheek to feel the softness and warmness of them and to kiss them.
Seamus snorted at his dormmate. Not because of the intriguing question he wants to ask Harry, which is what the Slytherin common room looks like, but the clear residue he can clearly see on Harry's mouth. He isn't dumb. He knows what semen looks like. "Well, I'm sure ye and Draco have been doing much more than snogging on his bed, Harry. Remember to clean yer mouth the next time ye... suck him off."
At first, the feeling was familiar. The pressure that increased steadily, the initial burning stretch that fingering never entirely alleviated. But this was more. Usually, after the initial stretch, there was a relief. The stretch stopped, overwhelmed by the pressure, and then pleasure, inside him. But this continued, wider and longer, a never-ending burn. His erection flagged, and he closed his eyes, focusing on his breathing.
Draco was feeling the same, wanting to kiss Harry again because of this Muggle song. He just wanted to pin Harry to a wall and kiss him until both of their lips are sore from the intense snogging. He didn't know who this Muggle songwriter was but if he ever met him, he'd surely thank him for this amazing music that he got to share the first dance to with his boyfriend.
Draco has definitely not smiled so much in his lifetime. Especially when Voldemort was in power, that time of his years was just scary as hell. But Harry floods him with happiness whenever the Gryffindor smiles at him, or when those green eyes look at him and into his own eyes. This Gryffindor, even throughout his schooling years at Hogwarts, could always make him feel like this. He just ignored these feelings through Hogwarts, though. He knew he shouldn't have.
"We just went around the castle for a walk," Harry started the lie, though he hated even lying about this one little thing. "And around the Black Lake. We even stopped and watched the Giant Squid float to the surface of the lake."
Cho felt a little impatient in waiting for two rivals to kiss, so she sighed and leaned her head against the wall. "Do you think we should go over and pretend we just saw them?" she whispered to her best friend, a little curiously as she wanted these two to just... get it over with!
Harry was still looking at Sirius, fear in his eyes from how his godfather would react. Now he felt like this conversation was getting too alarming. He hoped he would accept him. If he didn't, he knows Sirius would disown him or something. He just wanted to run. He was scared of what might come from his godfather's mouth.
"Looking for this?" said a friendly voice that only could turn out to be Hermione. She placed the birdcage with the snowy white bird inside it down on the floor and glared at Harry.
"Yeah," Draco sighed in relief, liking his renovated home so much. Mother and father have done a good job with it all. "It was a bit depressing when it was all black, and it reminded us too much of... him."
"Yes, how very exciting! It will be on a Saturday after the first task, just two months from now," the headmaster said, giving big a smile with twinkling blue eyes. "Your parents already know of the dates as they were sent out when the term started. You are all required to wear dress robes. That is all."
Cedric sighed; knowing because of Harry's gesture and demeanour that something did happen. By the look on Harry's face and in his very dull eyes, he knew Harry won't talk to him, so he decided to drop the topic for later. "So, did anything interesting happen this week?"
Ginny punched Harry in the arm playfully, "Merlin, Harry!" and she grinned as Harry winced and rubbed at his arm. "You are so confusing!" she said seriously.
Ivy shifted in her seat, finding it uncomfortable. She didn't like telling people why she'd rather be at Hogwarts, even if Harry and Draco know of her problems with her mother. She'd like to spend her Christmas at Malfoy Manor, but she doesn't want to cause any trouble to Mr and Mrs Malfoy by staying there and having one more mouth to feed.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her, not knowing why she's giving him a mischievous smile. Is this what all Australians are like?
"Yes!" Harry said with a little nod and noticed that there was no Potions equipment anywhere in sight. Strange... He can't do anything Potion related if there's no equipment. "Where's the Potion stuff?"
Draco had enough, he grabbed his wand, made sure nobody was looking and cast a "Tarantallegra," on the boy. He pictured the boy doing backflips and headpins in the middle of the floor, and that was exactly what the boy was doing.
Harry rolled his eyes, annoyed that he can't have a peaceful walk and looked at the person. It was actually a girl with black hair and blue eyes sitting on an elegant black armchair in front of a large dark grey and white round tent. She had a grey fluffy blanket over half of her body and a firepit in front of her. What he could see that she was wearing were black jeans and a grey long-sleeved top. "Hi..."
George turned his head around and gave Harry a smile. But Harry could see beyond the mask, as he now knows about the particular mask George's wearing every day.
Loud footsteps were heard from upstairs and in the lounge room, and in seconds Vernon enters the main hall from the living room and Petunia appears from up at the stairs. Harry immediately feels like his life is at risk and he's in deep trouble though he didn't do anything.
Ivy then threw her arms around Draco for a hug, feeling her eyes fill with tears and run down her cheeks. "I love you, brother," she sobbed into his shoulder and couldn't believe how lucky she is to have Draco as a cousin. "Thank you for doing this for me. It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done."
Draco nodded and pulled him into one final kiss, memorising the way Harry’s soft lips move against his own. It will be a while until he sees Harry again, so he wants to savour every last moment he has with Harry. Then the kiss ended, and Draco stepped away from Harry, smiling sweetly, and went off to his father who was already paying for his books.
"Mistletoe," Ron then says and points above them at the floating weed which is slowly disappearing. He also smells a strong scent of Holy and the feeling of magic surrounding them. He takes a few steps back, thinking about what he had just done. He's still confused though he really enjoyed the kiss with Blaise. "I- Can we not discuss this with anyone, Please? I'm just very... confused."
"Not one that I know of," said Harry, and he shook his head as he scanned his memories for knowledge about the Potter family and crests that they could have. He knew of none and don't remember Sirius or Remus telling him of the Potter crest.
Draco smiled at Harry, liking the way he's so deep in thought. It was distracting though, and he nearly crashed into a few corners in the corridors when watching Harry "Stop thinking so deeply Harry," he just blurts out. "It's so distracting!"
"Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas," the professor said, looking at the people he has chosen. "Lavender Brown and Gregory Goyle. Parvati Patil and Vincent Crabbe."
"Oh, Harry," Draco sighed. "You feel so good." And after long seconds, he breathed, "Don't stop. Don't ever stop."
Narcissa nodded at his question and feels the heat rise to her cheeks at the compliment. "I brought it a day ago and anyway, someone sent this to us by Owl," she said as she handed her husband the picture. Even from here, she smiled at it. She was just so thrilled that her son would have someone to share the love with. "I find it quite adorable."
Ivy rose her hands and buried them in Lavender's sandy-blonde hair, holding the Gryffindor to her. She let out a soft moan from her throat and rolled her hips against the Gryffindor's. And then Ivy knew what she and Lavender now both wanted. She crawled back with a smile so she could see Lavender's knickers, grabbed the hem, and pulled them down. The sight amazed Ivy. Lavender really looked like an angel; she is so pretty. The little blondish brown curls on Lavender's fanny were so adorable! She wanted to feel them, but not quite yet. She looked back up at the panting Lavender and smiled. Ivy stripped herself in front of Lavender until she had nothing else on.
He looks up at Harry who's staring down at him, and he places a kiss to the head of Harry's beautiful cock. He could see the pleasured look on Harry's face, and his beautiful parted lips. Merlin, now he's thinking of other places those lips could be attached to. He was moaning quietly to himself, almost-but-not-quite overlooking the painful throb of his own cock constricted in his trousers.
And in the early morning of Wednesday, after they had breakfast, they were down in the Library's secret room with the fireplace covering the room in warm comfort, but they also had a nice fluffy green blanket that Draco stole from the Slytherin dormitory. Harry laughed at how much of a badass Draco can be at times.
"Yes, I am," said Harry, nodding his head a little uneasily. What did this girl want? A picture? A fucking strand of hair? Like the hell no. "I'm not handing out autographs if that's what you're thinking. I'm just out on a stroll."
Draco snorted and wondered if the kid had something wrong with him. Did the kid get dropped on its head as a baby? But he can’t be rude like that. Who knows what kinds of things happen to muggle babies? "Muggle kids are weird."
Ivy watches Harry leaving, and she looks up at Draco with tears in her eyes. "It seems like you two are getting along quite well, Draco," she says, intrigued as to what her cousin and Harry would have talked about... or even done. "There haven't been any secret snogging sessions between you and Harry that I don't know of, is there?"
Harry smiled and raised his hand to caress Draco's soft cheek. "Yeah, well... I love when I wake up in the morning and the first thing I see is your gorgeous ass."
Harry's eyes drooped, as Draco continued fucking into him, overwhelmed by the lassitude following his orgasm. The feeling he didn't think he could take, of Draco's cock stretching and filling him up, now strangely comforting as the rhythm faltered, as Draco let Harry's legs drop, he buried his head against Harry's neck, mouthing the pulse point as he arched and groaned and finally stilled.
"Don't apologize, this was fun," Potter said with a smile. "If you ever want to crash and fall on the floor on top of me, just owl me the details and I'll meet you there," he added, winking at him just to give him an idea of what he wants to do with the Slytherin.
Draco hated this too, but he just didn't want his father finding out about this. Who knows how his father will take this? How about his mother? "I need to keep acting as I should be and keep a low profile," he told Harry carefully, frowning a little at the thought of hurting Harry in some kind of way like insulting his friends. "If some Slytherins find me befriending people in different Hogwarts houses I'm sure my father will most definitely hear about that in a matter of hours. I wouldn't know what would happen if he found out, what would happen to me. Either I get disowned or just punished... for my acts."
Fred and George shook their heads. How could she not know when there are a few homosexual couples in Hogwarts. Harry and Draco being the most known one and probably the most popular.
That's when he saw the girl who he saw at the Slytherin table a couple of people away from Draco. The girl with the long black wavy hair and blue eyes. It was Ivy. Ivy was standing in front of the mirrors, both hands grabbed the sides of the sinks as she was rocking back and forwards and she was singing, "Y-you are b-beautiful, no matter w-what they say."
Harry just sighed, not really remembering anything from primary school. He didn't want to remember anything from then because there were so many memories he wants to forget. The bullying, the abuse, teachers not caring about him when Dudley hurts him.
"I'll let you know when I want something," said Harry as he didn't want Ron to get him anything. He doesn't want Ron using his money to buy things for him, or to give him any favours like doing his homework and such.
"Harry, can we dance for a little while longer?" Draco then asked with his own smile. "Even though you scared the Nargles out of me, I still want this night to be something to remember." But he was already pulling Harry to the middle of the dance floor and Harry gladly accepted the dance.
Draco's Malfoy mask fell over his face, blocking out his true emotions. "I'm sorry, Harry," he said, and as he looked into those pretty green eyes, his mask was removed and replaced with sympathy. "I shouldn't have mentioned it."
Both girls giggled again. They loved annoying the hell out of Draco, it's something they were born to do and it's what they cherish doing. "We love you too," they chorused just like identical twins would.
Harry noticed that Ivy used the bunny ears thing when she said 'raise' and 'take care'. He understood what she was gesturing. Ivy's mother wasn't taking care of her in a good way. It was like him and the Dursleys.
Draco Malfoy, sitting on the park bench with his best friend, Pansy Parkinson, was just watching Pansy's godson, Nick, playing on the park with a few kids. But the thing that caught Draco's eye was the handsome bloke wandering into the park. But nobody could recognize that messy black hair, green eyes that shine like emeralds and round spectacles that are so out of style. He couldn't believe it. "Is that Potter?" he asked while crossing his arms over his chest to observe.
"Mm-hmm!" Joslyn teased them and smiled at the two. "You really should, though. I believe you would be an amazing and adorable couple. Don't you think so, Hermione?" she asked the other girl but didn't look at her. Instead, she was making a heart shape with her hands at the two boys.
Draco slid down in his seat until his chin was resting on the table. "Fine, fine," He said with a long sigh and started to get up off his seat. He leaned his arms over the table, staring down at his curried eggs. "I'll try. Besides, I don't think I can just say 'Oh Hello Harry, I've been crushing on you for who knows how long, and would you like to go to the Yule ball with me?' I'd be trying so hard to not start to stutter and sound like a fool."
Harry sighed. Decisions, decisions. Either risk doing something bad or stupid or admitting something personal. He's going to go with Truth because he knows Ivy won't go too far into asking him a very personal question like what his home life is like. "Truth."
"Shh! Don't be so loud!" Ivy hissed in his direction and gave him a light slap on the shoulder. It only made Draco laugh. "Yes, Lavender Brown is my crush, but I don't think I'd ever get to be with her. And it's not called gay, it's Les-bi-an."
Draco quickly stood to the side of the door in case there was something inside the room and he reached a hand beside him where Harry was, guarding the Gryffindor with his life. He waited a few seconds, hearing if there was any noise coming from the room and sighed in relief. Harry smiled at the Slytherin protecting him, which he really didn't need, and pointed his wand towards the room and muttered, "Lumos Maxima!" Draco still stood to the side again, just for precaution and to protect Harry.
He frowned and collapsed on his bed, rolling on to his side and just lay there staring out the window in the far side of the room. He started feeling tears well up in his eyes and he told himself no. Don't cry now. Don't cry!
"Ask who out?" The two Slytherins turned their heads to look at their other best friend. Blaise Zabini. Maybe they were a bit too loud. Draco hoped the entire Slytherin house didn't hear them.
He didn't even realize a 3-meter long brown snake had just Slithered past him until he just saw its movement in the grass. Hell, would it be crazy to just have a conversation with it? "Hello, sssnake... I'm Harry."
Ginny cupped her hand to her mouth in surprise. "Oh Merlin, Ron!" She just didn't want to believe this but she knew it was true. "You didn't!" Even she and Luna haven't gone that far yet.
Harry reached over the table to grab some other flowers; pain shot through his chest as he did so. "Ahhh!" he dropped his arm hastily, rubbing his chest where the Horntail scar burned. God, he hoped this pain wouldn't last for months.
Draco raised an eyebrow, wondering what Harry has planned. Merlin, he nearly gets aroused whenever Harry's up to mischief or is just being so damned hot like he is right now. It's that smirk, and his mischievous smiles. "Alright. So, the Willow tree."
"Harry!" Malfoy called, walking up to Harry with a smirk. It actually pained him so much when Harry's been ignoring him. But his favourite Gryffindor should know that he's only joking about the insults.
"Oh," Harry sighed, flexing his body, and pushing up into Draco's face. His hands were kneading at Draco's scalp, jerky and a little rough as his composure failed.
Harry smiled back at Draco. He was flabbergasted by Draco's handsomeness as the early sunlight bounced off his whiteish blonde hair and made his eyes sparkle like diamonds. He then leaned forward and placed a quick kiss to Draco's lips, and he tilted his head to the side and did it again.
"Say, how has your first week back at Hogwarts been?" Cedric asked him, and his smile slowly built as he raised an eyebrow. Harry could have laughed. His first week has been pretty shitty. In fact, he's been pretty shitty for months, but he wouldn't tell anyone that. He doesn't want people worrying about him. He's fine...
Draco turned around to face Ron and crossed his arms over his chest proudly. Crabbe, Goyle and Nott doing the same while Pansy and Blaise frown and take a step backwards in different directions. "I've got an island, thank you very much," he lied, knowing how much of even a little insult can anger the Weasel. Why would he have a private island somewhere when he has manors in some parts of the world? He gave Harry an apologetic frown to tell him he was sorry for insulting his friend.
"Here goes nothing," Harry whispered and rolled his eyes. He leaned towards the ferret, then gave the ferret a kiss under the nose, which turned out to be the mouth. Suddenly, in a flash, the ferret that had been held and kissed by Harry transformed back into the Draco Malfoy. Instead of feeling fluffy fur, Harry felt actual lips on his own, kissing him back, so softly and demandingly. His heart was beating quickly in his chest. He had butterflies fluttering around wildly in his stomach and he just didn't want to let go of this beautiful moment.
"You do!" Hermione teased with a little push on Harry's upper arm. She wasn't even grossed out that Harry liked Malfoy. But to her, there really wasn't anything about Malfoy that was attractive in any way. That's just her opinion though, there could be plenty of girls who like that git.
Draco smiled at the news. He would have never thought that Harry cooked in his life. When younger, he believed Harry lives a royal life since he was the "Chosen One". He started disbelieving that when seeing that Harry wears the same thing more than once.
Harry sighed, he had to tell Hermione a little something he did. A something he gave Draco, actually. It's the most amazing thing that has happened to him. "Hermione?"
"It's so on, Ivy!" Harry said, his voice rising with excitement, but he also sounded quite challenging. He unlinked his arms with Draco and ran over to another mound of snow. He rolled some snow into a ball and threw it right at Ivy who laughed and threw one right back at him, hitting him on the side of the neck. He groaned from the cold wet snow and rubbed his neck repeatedly to try and warm it.
Harry then saw a girl who was standing next to Malfoy with Black hair and blue eyes. It was Ivy Black, the girl he met earlier on in the day. She was wearing a Black beanie, a long-sleeved shirt with an Ouija board on it, black jeans, and gothic platform boots. He thought that style was kind of cool, it was like she came out of a fairy tale as a villain. Harry sighed miserably, thinking that of course, Malfoy would have a girlfriend. He's so bloody hot! Who wouldn't want to date that Slytherin?
"Should we run back to Hagrid or cast a Periculum?" asked Draco who reached for his wand in his robe pocket.
Draco tried to hold down a blush that was rising from his neck, but it was too late. He had been caught by Pansy who elbowed him in the arm with a big grin on her face. Why couldn't she just do her work and ignore him until class is over?
"It's nothing to apologize for," Harry said, looking up at the white roof, then back to Draco. "It's amazing what you can do to a room if you add even the smallest amount of colour."
As predicted, Draco walked over to Hagrid's hut with his goons trailing behind him. "Well, if it isn't the champion?" he said to his goons, Crabbe and Goyle. "Better get your autograph books out because I don't think he'll be around much longer since most of the Tri-Wizard champions have died. How long do you think you'll last, Potter? I bet you won't last five minutes!" he smirked.
Throughout the Great Hall, Draco could see clumps of students sharing and reading the paper - all the while stealing glances over at the Gryffindors. Draco looked at Harry. He had seen Ron and Hermione try to hide the paper from Harry, but Harry had grabbed it away from them. Draco's stomach did a flip as he saw Harry's face grow pale as the handsome black-haired Gryffindor gripped and read the paper. Skeeter got information from somewhere and somehow and Draco was bound to find out.
"Great!" Hermione said, and she let go of his shoulder. Then she clasped her hands to her chest and sighed at him like she knew something he also knew but nobody else did. "So, how is that boyfriend of yours?"
"Oh, I know he is," Ivy says with a cheeky smile while coming up with a plan to get these two together and actually kiss. Oh, she was getting so many ideas, but she had to choose the perfect one. "How does it feel, Draco. Tell us. What are you feeling right now?"
"Like father like son," said Draco, pouring them both some wine. But he looked up at Harry in approval, "You don't mind, do you? Having wine."
Hermione felt a little guilty that she disturbed Harry and Draco's little moment. But had a knowing smile on her face as she just knew Harry liked Draco a lot and it seems Draco likes him back the same way. Oh, if only they could just see it by looking at each other. "Did he say anything else?"
Harry Potter, the boy who lived, grew curious to why Draco Malfoy has been disappearing off the Marauders Map every Friday afternoon at around six o'clock. So, being obviously suspicious, he decided to follow the blonde snake after a quick dinner with Hermione and Ron.
Harry flushed as he walked over to the bed, placed his Firebolt next to Draco's Nimbus 2001 and leaned on one of the posters of the bed. He didn't think Draco would ask that kind of question. He didn't exactly want to leave Draco in here all by himself. "Uhm, I'm not sure," he says and then noticed a part of Draco's shirt is up, showing his abdomen. He quickly blinks and looks back up into silver eyes. "If Ron wakes up and finds I'm not sleeping or isn't the common room, well, I don't know what he'd do."
Harry smiled and just lay on Draco's chest, his body sending his brain happy thoughts and feelings that flushed away anything negative. He felt sleep already start eating away at him and he wanted to fall asleep in his boyfriend's arms. He pressed a loud kiss to Draco's neck which earned him a little laugh from below and a soft "I love you, Harry" to which he replied with a tired "I love you too, Draco" back.
Ivy began to feel a little anxious now. So, she did know? But how? The medic mentioned a blood test but was that true? Could magic find out what you possess? "Um..." she said, warily looking around the room for other students. When she saw nobody, she said, "Okay." She tilted her head back and took out one lense after the other and then looked at the medic witch."
Draco was still coming closer to the cabinet Harry was in, and he appeared to be intrigued at the cabinet. Harry was still panicking, and he admired how Draco was looking at the cabinet. Somewhere deep inside him, he wanted the Slytherin to look at him that way, but with a little more…liking. Love, he means. Ah, love. Such a beautiful emotion to share with someone you like dearest. Then the thought of himself and Draco together, holding hands as they walk through the corridors at Hogwarts as a happy couple flooded his mind. It seemed really nice. No, not nice. Wonderful! Why the hell was he thinking about this? He’s too young to date anybody. He is only 12 years old.
Draco considered this for a moment. If he does do it, he won't do it alone. Pansy and Ivy will do it too but at different times. It can't be that hard, can it? "Alright. Deal." It seemed fair anyway. They all shook hands, agreeing with the deal.
"Oh, Fred and George," Mrs Weasley said with a tired sigh, looking out her kitchen window with a smile. "They're always playing Quidditch this late in the afternoon. Why don't you go play with them? I'm sure you haven't had a chance to ride your Firebolt in ages."
Ron didn't like being petted on the head, so he walked towards Harry, holding out his hand. "Wanna dance?" he suggested with a smirk. The thought of dancing with a guy was a little weird but if it's with his best mate he doesn't really mind.
Dean sighed a little sadly. He hated how rude Ron was being, especially to Harry and the whole LGBTQ+ group. But why would he speak and lose trust in people when he could be quiet and say nothing. "It's fine, guys, really. If they want to act this way, then let them."
"About an hour," Draco said with a mischievous little grin. He saw the hurt look on Harry's face and chuckled at him. He felt just a little guilty for playing with him then. "I'm only joking, I just got here."
For what seems like eternity's, they just stare directly into each other's eyes but most people would look at Harry's eyes and see green but at this very moment Draco see beautiful mountains and maps and thousands of miles of beautiful scenery surrounded by colours no one even knows exist and only he will ever see. He sees himself and he sees a future full of love as he looks at Harry's slightly parted lips. He knows what's about to happen as they both lean into each other in slow motion only breaking eye contact for a few seconds to look down at their lips with their hearts beating like mini drums and hammering against their chests.
"It's no problem, Harry," Hermione said with a smile and she pointed to her book then at herself. She just wanted her book back so she can get back into reading 'The Maze Runner'. "May I please have my book back?"
The three nodded except Draco. "Why do you lot call her 'the fat lady'?" he asked and his eyebrows drew together as he felt sorry for the woman in the portrait even if he hasn't talked to her ever. "It's kind of rude, isn't it?"
Draco sighed as he did not really have or know of any games. Well, except for truth or dare but honestly, he would be wanting to just say 'I dare you to kiss me'. "I honestly don't know. Know any games?"
Draco stared down at Harry's lips and then looked back up into emerald green irises. "I love your smile and your eyes," he admits softly with a loving smile." I love it when your eyes sparkle every time you smile, Harry. It's like a breath of fresh air to me. I love everything about you. Your smile was the beginning of my love towards you."
Harry sighed guiltily and remembered exactly what Dumbledore stated to the entire students of Hogwarts at the start of the term last year back in September. "Yeah,” he drawls. “No sexual acts on the Hogwarts express."
Ivy suddenly jumped down from the seat she was on and sighed defeatedly as she searched through her black purse for a few galleons. "Well, Dray," she said, handing Draco five Galleons. "You won the bet."
Harry nodded at them and waved goodbye. "Alright, goodnight Georgie and Freddie," he said sleepily with a forced smile. Harry knew those two always stayed until up around 10:30 at night, just to finalize their pranks. It's just something they do, it's like their routine.
Blaise looked at Neville and bit his lip, hoping the boy had no idea who he liked. It is a secret. Only Pansy, Draco, Harry, and Ivy know. "Uhm..." he said innocently, trying to act as if he had no clue what Neville was saying. "Wha-? Um... I-," he stuttered and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Okay fine, yes I do. And exactly how many of your Gryffindorks know?" He crossed his arms over his chest while glaring at the Gryffindor in front of him.
"Harry?" Hermione poked her head back in the greenhouse and looked to where her friend was. She found him talking to Malfoy and Parkinson. She wondered what this was all about, and she hoped she wasn't interrupting anything important. "Harry, are you coming to dinner?"
A murmur of "Good Afternoon, Professor," was heard around the classroom. Harry frowned a little and stared at his desk, not finding any interest in even being in class. He just wanted to fade away into the shadows. Nobody seemed to know he existed today. Maybe he could exit the classroom without anyone knowing and head to Gryffindor to hide away in Myrtle's bathroom.
"So, can we hear the story of how you and Draco ended your rivalry?" Neville had to ask as he was curious about how rivals could become lovers in a matter of months. But over the year he has seen some sexual tension and staring between the two.
"Nope," Pansy repeated, her smirk only widening. Oh, she loves when she has all power over Draco because of his silly hair products. It just means when she wants something, she can get it easily by intimidating her friend. Looks like she's going to get a free nail job done sooner than she thinks.
“Oh, he won’t be money shaming anyone as long as I’m around,” said Harry, feeling a little proud of himself. “But if he did, you tell me right away.” Just as Ron began telling him that he would tell Harry if Draco money shamed him, Harry looked around the shop and saw Draco and Mr Malfoy leaving the shop. A wave of disappointment and longing washed over him, and he wanted Draco back in his arms again.
Harry nodded sadly. He felt Ron's presence disappear from his bed, so he lay down on his side, facing away from Ron. He felt so embarrassed because he let Ron see him in his vulnerable state. He just wants to die. Is that too much to ask?
Dean turned his attention back to look at Harry. He has a feeling Harry's looking so down is from Ron telling bias to everyone and thinking that being gay is disgusting and a sin. He hated Ron for that if it's the reason Harry seems so sad. "We heard from Ron that you're gay," he said using a soft tone and squeezed Seamus' hand from under the table. What Ron said affected them both. "You know, it's okay to like the same gender."
"Yes!" Pansy spat and shooed him away with her free hand. "Go! Otherwise, I'll send a stinging hex your way once I learn it. Oh, and don't you have that study date with Harry during lunch? You don't want to miss that do you?"
Pansy shuddered as a wave of coldness hit her. She swears the weather isn't supposed to get windy during this night. "Body?" She looked to where Draco was staring at and frowned in horror. It couldn't be... "What do-"
"Yes," said Draco, giving him a short nod. The question he's been wanting to ask about this flying night makes him wonder how they won't get caught by the Hogwarts caretaker or professors. "But how will we not get caught? I'm sure Filch will be wandering around somewhere."
"Have you seen Harry, Dean or Hermione?" asked Ron, flickering his eyes from the mirror and to the three Slytherins. He missed the Halloween where nothing like this happened, and he and his mates are just eating candy al night.
"I ran into Cedric Diggory," Harry said and then remembered the pamphlet the Hufflepuff gave him. He leaned back, Draco's hands sliding out from his pants, his legs bent on either side of the Slytherin's thighs, and he reached into his robe pocket to pull out the pamphlet. "I believe in these pages we'll find a few moved we can try out. It's what Cedric gave me for some reason." He opened the pamphlet up, not seeing the sparkle of interest in Draco's eyes and the first page his eyes come to is the moves section. Merlin... there's so many.
After the last dance, they headed back inside the ballroom. It seemed that most people had left except for a few students wearing their Masquerade outfits who danced with their partners. Hermione, who was unmasked and dancing with Ron, Dean was unmasked and dancing with Seamus. That just left Neville, who was still masked and dancing with Blaise.
"MERLIN'S!" Yelled Blaise, who stared at the woman in a white dress. He whipped out his wand and pointed it at the woman. "I have had ENOUGH of these BLOODY scares. Whatever ghost you are, piss off!"
Harry shrugged as he really didn't have a decent explanation instead of saying how he wants to spend the whole day with him. "I've spent loads of times with her and she's mostly reading," he told him. God, he hated lying to Draco, but this was necessary. "I don't like disturbing anyone who has their nose in a book."
"Yes, since Hermione keeps flashing me these annoying looks," Harry said with a little irritation in his voice, and he glared over Draco's shoulder at Hermione who shook her head and looked back down at her open book. He looked back into silver eyes, wanting to just get away from Hermione and take Draco with him. Merlin, that kind of sounds... selfish, doesn't it?
Harry looked directly up at Draco, asking himself if he heard wrong. Did he hear what he thought was a compliment and a very sweet one? Or did he think he heard what he wanted Draco to say? "Pardon?"
Harry looked back at him sadly but tried to suppress it with annoyance. He couldn't let his best mate see what he really is. A freak. "No... I just have a nightmare of seeing it happen," he told him just to shut him out of the conversation. "It's normal, Ron. Please, come off it!"
Draco nodded sadly. What did he mean 'only the professor came to see him?' Surely Harry's friends were allowed in, weren't they? "It's no problem at all, Harry," he said in a comforting tone. He went over to the bed and gave Harry a big hug as he needed it so badly. He could have lost Harry today then what? He didn't even want to think that.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle as well, "You sure it will hurt? I'm positive Hermione had a stronger punch than you - if memory serves both of us correct".
Draco smiled and looked over at his cousin. Right now, at this instance, Ivy was his family since his parents were a little busy for their own reasons. "Ivy is my family, Harry," he said, and his smile widened as his cousin smiles back at him.
Draco frowned and hugged her back tightly, thankful that she wasn't dead like he saw when the guy stabbed her. He wasn't one to give his friends hugs, only Harry. But where was Harry? Oh, he hoped he was okay. Well, if Pansy and Blaise weren't dead then Harry shouldn't be... Or... were he, Blaise, and Pansy dead? Is this what muggle heaven is like? A weird...well, he doesn't know what he's in. It's very strange...
Lavender smiled up at Ivy and caressed her arms gently. Her arms then trailed to Ivy's bras. She sat up, looking deep into beautiful ocean blue eyes, and reached behind the girl to unlatch the bra straps. As the last clip was undone, the Slytherin's black bra slid off onto Lavender's stomach. She gaped at the sight of another girl's boobs other than her own. She reached up and fondled them, squeezing lightly, and poking them gently. All she could say was how gorgeous they were.
Samara raised her hand back at the door, which opened up. There wasn't any other way to scare these older students, so she had to let them pass.
Cedric looked a little disbelieving at first, but the little smile forcing its way through on Harry's mouth told him otherwise. His eyes widened in surprise as he never in his life would ever think that Draco would be one for making truces. "That's lovely!" he said with a gentle voice and a satisfied smile. "Did he say why he wanted a truce?"
Harry shook his head, "No, not mad at all." He just doesn't get mad at all anymore. It's just upset. It's his main emotion. Depressed, stressed, and upset. "But it can be a bit much with Ron, Snape, scar and the Tournament."
Harry rolled his eyes at his friend and grabbed a slice of Lasagna, taking little bites from it even though he was feeling a little sick from it. He's just waiting for that unpleasant feeling of needing to rush to the bathroom to throw up. Oh, he knows the feeling will come very soon.
"She wasn't in her dorm when I woke up," said Parvati, tears streaming down her face and her eyes not leaving the space where the Nun disappeared to. "She was earlier, though. She just read, even when I fell asleep." She then glanced at the boys and around them, not seeing the two other sixth year boys. "But where's Harry and Dean if they're not with you?"
"Great!" Draco beamed at the answer he had been waiting for. This excited him. "Do you want me to come with, just to hold your hand or hug or cuddle with?" He would love to accompany Harry on one of his therapy appointments. It would be fun getting to know exactly how the professionals do it.
Hermione gave Harry a knowing smile, wondering if she's missing out on something or if there's a someone in her best friend's life that she doesn't know of. "Who are you thinking of Harry?"
Fred smiled mischievously at Harry. He needs to know a few things first before it gets a little exciting. Knowledge comes first before anything else. "Do you have a crush on anyone?"
Harry kept blabbering on about the Slytherin, "Lips that look so soft to the touch, to kiss... Beautiful pale skin..." He remembered watching the Slytherin in his sixth year. That arse that moved so elegantly in those pants. Merlin. He felt an erection start at the thought of the blonde's arse. "The tightest ass..."
Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Hermione looked at Ivy. They were a little confused as to why a Slytherin has joined the Gryffindor table and how she knows Harry. They've seen her around Hogwarts but have never met her.
Harry and Draco quickly pulled out of the kiss and blushed guiltily. The whole class turned their heads to see a flushed Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy looking away from each other. Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise chuckled at the duo. As the class finished, everyone headed down to their next class.
The kiss was gentle at first, as Draco didn't know if Harry wanted to be kissed in front of anyone yet but then it got firmer as Harry didn't pull back. They couldn't even hear the soft sobbing coming from the other couch where Ivy was. Draco's hand went behind Harry's neck and pulled him closer to his face, the other hand laying on the couch.
Hermione couldn't help but giggle at the two boys so oblivious to be in love with each other. Two birds of the same species conjured by two people meant something much more than what it looks like.
"That, I don't mind," Harry said truthfully. He didn't mind smelling like Draco at all for the Slytherin smells amazing. Yes, he loves the smell of Draco's citrus hair gel, his vanilla-scented cologne but most importantly he loves the smell of a pure naked and raw Draco Malfoy.
Mr Malfoy slammed his cane down on the item his son was about to touch, and he said, “Don’t touch anything, Draco.”
Fred and George exchanged glances of confusion as they looked at Draco who seemed utterly worried about something. They ignored him and turned to look at the girl with Black hair and blue eyes. "Who might this lovely lady be-," asked Fred.
"Why, thank you, Narcissa," Molly said with a big friendly smile, clearly excited to have guests over like always.
Harry was staring into those beautiful pools of silver as he was inside the other man. "Oh, Draco," he moaned. "You're so beautiful."
Ivy rolled her eyes at her cousin ranting about his crush and sighed. Teenage boys these days... "No, Draco. He's not charming. You remember my sexuality, don't you?"
"And is it about a particular blonde-haired Ravenclaw that we've seen you stare at multiple times every day?" George asked and smiled knowingly at her. He's seen it clearly and so has his twin. He knows of every look his brothers and sisters give their lovers. He hasn't seen it with Bill yet, but he's heard charlie talk about a boy he works with loads of times. He hasn't seen any type of look on Percy's face besides when his face lights up when Oliver Wood gets mentioned in a conversation.
Harry mounted his Firebolt easily with a challenging smile and he and kicked off shouting, "Not if I get there first!" and soared straight towards the Quidditch Pitch in the distance. He felt the familiar weightlessness thrill taking control of him. Nothing could beat flying. Draco scowled at the cold, sped off on his broom and raced Harry to the Quidditch Pitch.
A roar of laughter around the Great Hall broke loose, and a few students began to sing the rest of the song. Harry looked around the Hall, seeing Hermione and Dean laughing, and further down the Gryffindor table Mike, Zoe, Savannah, and Chelsea were all singing the rest of the song too. A few Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, and Slytherins sang too. Harry knew that the laughing and singing students were Muggle-borns and Half-bloods.
"Yes," said Emilie with a nod, her Annabelle costume looking as scary and real as it ever could be. It frightened nearly everyone in the room, because of how realistic it was. But that was good. The more real everything and everyone looked, the better the prank will be. "Fake blood is just so cheap! I could stock up on it if we were to make a movie."
She sat next to him, grabbing an apple and bit a chunk out. "Is this about Ron finding out about him?" She noticed that Harry looked away in guilt. She sighed. "Do you not think he'll accept you?"
George Weasley, with bed head, stood in front of Harry tiredly. He had to admit that George looked kind of hot with his hair standing up at funny ends. "Thank you!" the Weasley brother said quickly, rushed into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.
"I-It's like a part of me is missing," George said sadly but then began to sob. His heart wrenched for the return of his twin, his brother, his best friend.
Harry blushed and just hoped they weren't being overheard by students or worse... professors. "Dracoooo!" he whined softly, and Draco only kissed him and began walking up to Gryffindor Tower with him.
"Yeah," said Harry, still wondering how she got in. He's too tired to figure that out. Perhaps some other day, then he will ask her how she got inside. He would also have to write the spell down somewhere so he can remember it. "Have a Merry Christmas!" He watched as Ivy left the bathroom to go back to the Slytherin common room, well, that's what Harry thought she did.
Harry nudged Ron in the shoulder and pointed to the blackboard. Didn't his best mate see that at all? "Did you read that before coming inside?"
Harry smiled and walked through the door, whispering a "Lumos." Draco closed the door behind him and walked side by side with Harry until they got to the end of the tunnel. They both exchanged smiles, Draco pointed his wand at the wall in front of them and whispered "Alohomora." The wall shook, sank down through the floor and light flooded the tunnel. Harry and Draco quickly exited and looked around cautiously, they cast a "Nox" and put their wands away in their pockets.
They just stared at each other for long moments, smiling as they knew the other felt the same way. That was until Draco broke the silence. "Potter," he said softly, his eyes not looking away from the emerald green.
Harry let a small sad smile come across his features. If he loses his friends at least he can have snake friends. Merlin, he sees himself as more of a freak now. "I'm not. I am jussst a boy who grew up with thisss ability."
Ivy giggled at the thought of finally seeing her cousin and Harry kissing, and she agreed with Pansy 100%. "It sure does."
Harry wanted to buck forward into Draco's perfect mouth but felt as if he was glued to the chair. The Slytherin bobbed his head up and down, back, and forth, at a fast pace and practically sending the Gryffindor into a state of euphoria. He endured the burning sensation in his throat, and the tip of his boyfriend's cock hitting the back of his throat and wished he could see Harry's face from under the table. To see his boyfriend falling apart from the pleasure.
"Yeah, that must be it," said Harry, and he nodded at that realization. "But it must take something that I will surely miss so... what would I miss?" He sat there, thinking about what he would miss. What would he miss if it is an object or a person? God, it would be humiliating if they put one of his blades down there. Well, that's if someone can find them but good luck with that.
Draco, his tongue still down Harry's throat, opened his eyes and looked with his eyes at Pansy. He smirked during the kiss and shooed her off with a wave of his hand which was doing nothing but decided to cup Harry's cheek. It was all he could do beside moan in Harry's mouth from the touch of Harry's hand exploring down his body.
Draco got up and made his way to Harry, wrapping his arms around the boy and hugging him from behind. He kissed Harry on the cheek, reached over to a CD and slid it into the music player. The music player made a buzzing noise to recognize the CD and it played. As soon as the music played, Draco span Harry around until the Gryffindor then faced him and wrapped his arms around his back. Harry slid his hands up Draco's chest and around his neck, swaying to the music with him.
Harry laughed and wiped the snow off of his nose. He walked over, gave Draco a smile and reached up to brush the snow off his whiteish blonde hair. He ran his fingers through Draco's hair, loving how soft it is under his fingers. He remembered the times he ran his fingers through Draco's hair. The time when making the sleeping potion, he remembered Draco taking the sleeping potion and falling into a deep sleep. Well, that's what he thought. He remembered stroking the blonde hair and leaning in to kiss Draco as he lay there sleeping. He just wanted to kiss Draco again and feel those soft lips kiss his own again.
Draco didn't disturb him as he knows Blaise wants his peace. He quickly dumped his items in his trunk and headed back out of the dorm and to the common room. Ivy and Pansy were sitting at one of the rectangular study tables by one of the large windows which looked out into the Black Lake. "Hello Pansy, Ivy."
"Don't be sorry," Draco said softly with a shake of his head. Harry's the one who shouldn't be sorry. It's those no-good relatives of Harry's. He leaned forward and gave him a slow kiss on the nose. "It's not your fault, Darling."
In a matter of minutes, the owls came in, delivering mail to their owners. Harry watched Draco's Eagle-owl swooping down and land gracefully on Draco's shoulder. He smiled and wished he were sitting next to Draco so he can talk to him and meet his owl friend. He then saw Hedwig fly down and land on Ron's plate of waffles. He chuckled at Hedwig and her goofy landings.
"Very good, Miss Granger," the professor squeaked, raised his wand, and swished it in the air. "Avis!" In a matter of seconds, budgerigars came out of nowhere, soured down to the professor and circled around him. "Get out your wands, everyone, and practice the spell. However, don't point your wand at anybody, that will make the birds think you either want to attack the person or defend you."
"Uhm... no?" Joslyn replied to him, not knowing what to say because no this does feel like a prank. Is the wizarding world real? As much as She would love to know that Hogwarts exists, she just can't believe it.
"What did you say?" Harry asked in surprise at what he thought had come out of Draco's mouth and his mouth fell open a little. He hasn't had Draco tell him using the English Language that he loves him, only in France.
Suddenly, Ivy's lips were back on Lavender's in a single millisecond, and Lavender widened her eyes in surprise before kissing back. She could taste her own blood in Ivy's mouth but she didn't mind at all. As Ivy's mouth was occupied, she slid her hands up to venture up to the hem of Lavender's yellow top, shoved it up and threw it away, revealing an angelic white lace bra. Lavender was beautiful. So beautiful. Ivy had to ask permission first. "May I?" she sounded pretty eager.
Ivy linked her arm with Draco's and led him out of the Great Hall, following Pansy down to the Slytherin common room. "So, Draco, when are you going to ask Harry out?" she asked him with an easy smile as she just wants the promise to be done already. Can't they see it in each other's eyes that they want each other?
Although, the only part of that day he liked was when Draco kissed him. It was twice in one day that the kiss happened, and he loved it. Whenever he would see Draco in class or the corridors of Hogwarts, his mind and thoughts would go directly to that memory of the kiss and how it made him feel. The kiss was like a Patronus. It pushed away the dark thoughts for a while and replaced them with positive feelings.
"Alright, wish me luck," Harry replied and edged away from the tree with his wand out in front of him.
"Oh, so that's what it means?" Harry said and forcefully raises his brows. At least she laughed. "I honestly thought it had something to do with actual beans, like baked beans." Ivy laughed at what the definition of 'Lesbian' was to Harry. Harry was glad he could make Ivy laugh again and cast a quick "Tempus" charm, telling him that it was 4:30 am. "Now for my secret... I've never told anybody this, not even my best friends know but when I was sorted in the first year of Hogwarts, the hat actually wanted me in Slytherin."
"Um... Thanks, Teddy." Draco's face only reddened a little more, especially at Harry's smile which the Gryffindor gave him. Merlin, that perfect mouth and lips that looks so kissable and soft.
They worked silently next to each other and finished the re-potting. Harry was going over the entire conversation in his head. What did Draco care that Ron was talking to him again? He planted the final sapling and gave it to Draco, which when Draco reached his hand towards the pot their hands touched, and they looked each other in the eye. "Do what you want to me, Draco," he told him and gave a quick pat to the Slytherin's hand. "But don't fight my friends."
"Very good, Ms Granger," said Professor Flitwick with a satisfied smile towards the young lady. "20 points to Gryffindor!" Cheers were heard across the room to where the Gryffindor's sat, though there were some 'booing's' coming from Slytherins.
Ivy groaned. Could this game get any more boring? "Okay, no..." she says seriously. "You have to ask the person a different question. Not the same one!" She then hesitated and sighed at the two boys. "Anyway, Draco. It's your turn."
Harry grabbed Dean, still in his Ghostface costume, by the arm and led him out of the ballroom to another hallway. There's just so many hallways!
"Oh, okay then," Ivy said and got up from her seat to give harry a light hug before he had to go for whatever reason he had. "I'll see you later, Harry. Stay safe and be happy for me." She leaned away from the hug and smiled at him. "Remember that you're not the only homosexual in Hogwarts so Ron Weasley's words don't only affect you. It affects all of us. And don't think that it's your fault he's acting this way. It's his choice if he decides to be a homophobic shithead."
"Since Christmas," Harry says with a bright smile and he turns his head to look at Draco, giving him a kiss on the jawline. "Draco here is the one who asked me out. It was a total surprise, of course. I thought I must have been dreaming. It happened and I couldn't be happier to be with you, Draco Lucius Malfoy." He slid his arms around his boyfriend's neck, watching tears pool up in those silver eyes and he leaned forward, kissing him slowly with love and tenderness.
Joslyn heard Draco 'her ferret' give a tiny little squeak to let her know that it had enough cuddles, so she gently placed it back in its cage and carried it to her room. She placed the cage on her desk, closed her bedroom door and opened the cage door so Draco could do what he wanted and get used to her bedroom.
But then Rebecca, a Gryffindor muggle-born third-year student, watching Harry's Slytherin boyfriend from the side of a corridor, came into view but ran away from Kurt. Time for some acting. She screamed. "HELP ME!"
He finally had enough of chasing her, wondering how murders are so fit, and cast a quick trip jinx at her. He grinned as she tripped, making it easier for him to run up to her and look like he's sawing off her head but he's just spelling her with a non-verbal "Stupefy." His wand is magically charmed to look like a chainsaw, which is kinda awesome. Now, it's time for his next target. Padma Patil. She's an easy shot because she's just walking around the corridor like a lost dog, but always looking around her. Smart little girl.
Harry began to blush, thinking about starting something romantic with Draco. Oh, a boy can dream. But Ivy's his girlfriend, isn't she? And Does Cedric mean Draco wanted to be just friends with him or... more? "Maybe..." was all he could say.
The room had the five elegantly royal and wooden 4-poster beds with Slytherin green drapes around the side. On the right side of the dorm room were three of the 4-poster beds and on the left side were the last two. Between each bed was a black bedside table with two draws and the only light source was the wall candles place between each of the beds on the wall.
The blush returned to Harry's face, and he looked to the ground, smiling a little. Nobody's ever told him he looks good before. All he has ever been called as a compliment is freak. It's just depressing. "I don't think many people are-,"
"Ron, I'm still the same person I was yesterday," Harry said dejectedly, and he felt the tears start forming in his eyes. He quickly blinked them away. "You just didn't know until now." He really needed to get away. He had the urge to cut deep. He just wanted to go someplace alone where nobody could find him so he can bleed out his emotions.
Dudley looked shocked, but then he glared at Mrs Figg. "Who are you to tell me what to do?" he spat viciously but kept his tone down. "You're not my mother!"
Draco's chin slid in the slick wetness even as his tongue did wicked things to the tender flesh, and every broken whimper Harry uttered affected Draco's body. He forced his face into Harry's skin, eager to slide in even a few more millimetres. His heart rate tripled and his temperature shot up, the muscles in his own hole twitching and pulsing in sympathy with Harry's.
"We would have Charms now," Draco said as he turned his head to the side to see Harry with half-open eyes. He adores his boyfriend so much. He gave both of Harry's half-closed eyelids a kiss which made Harry's eyes snap open and look at him. It was so hard not to look away. He wondered what new plant and spell they would learn about this afternoon.
Michael turned around and backed up against the wooden doors which would lead out to the courtyard, but the door is closed. He was terrified, to say the least. A dude with a pumpkin head? That's nothing he's ever thought possible.
"Okay then," Harry said with a hint of fear in his tone, turning away from the angry Hermione. He watched Hermione progress towards Pansy, at first it looked like Pansy didn't want to see Hermione but that changed as Pansy's girlfriends all decided to leave them be. He then turned to look back at the angry-looking whiteish blonde ferret who looked adorable. It was Draco and he just wanted to hold him.
Harry shook his head and rushed out of the room; he didn't want to have these types of conversations anymore. He knew Ron hated Malfoy, what good would it do if Hermione spilled his secret? Well, if it even is a secret.
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Amos Diggory, accompanied by his son, Cedric Diggory, came to join the Weasleys. It's like they appeared out of nowhere from thin air. How intriguing.
"But he'z juzt a boy!" Fleur said sharply. She couldn't believe it. This school would let an innocent young boy into such a dangerous Tournament with three other older competitors. What if he gets hurt or worse? Killed!
Draco was at a loss of words. Normally he'd be the one to ask guys out. Unless...it meant something else that wasn't related to relationships. Even if it wasn't, he would love to go out with this man. He smiled and said, "I would love to go out with you, Harry."
Hermione smiled gleefully at Ivy, knowing about the secret relationship her best friend has with Draco. If only she could tell her, but she promised Harry on the night of the Yule Ball that she wouldn't.
Draco stopped as he was in the center of the room after Harry had whistled at him, and he looked over at his boyfriend who was staring hungrily at him. The whole stare went right to his groin and he felt himself harden a little. He smirked as he put the pajama top on but didn't do up the buttons and was glad that he was a sight for his boyfriend to stare at. "I think it's just you, Harry. You are a very gorgeous sight to look at."
"My name's Justin, and yes," Justin said with a quick nod. He winked at the younger boy, grabbed his black wand from his coat pocket and pointed it at the other wizard's forehead, muttering a cleansing and healing spell.
"Afraid that Harry can't take care of himself?" Draco sneered. Merlin, do Harry's friends always treat him like some child? He knows Weasley and Granger are just being nice and helpful to Harry, but do they actually know what goes on in Harry's life that makes him so depressed? Do they? Aren't good friends supposed to know and ask Harry questions like he does to Ivy?
He felt Draco's semen pool up in his mouth and most of it slowly seeped down his throat. He swallowed the rest easily and licked the Slytherin clean of any come. He pulled away with a smile and put Draco's cock back in his boxers and zipped him back up. He crawled out from the table and sat back down on the seat, looking at Draco with a shimmer in his eye. When Draco looked his way, he pressed his lips to the Slytherin's in a little peck.
Harry pointed behind Ron at the Slytherin table to a girl with Black hair sitting next to Draco. "She's the girl sitting next to Draco," he said and watched as Draco got some jam on his top lip. To his disappointment, he watched Draco use a napkin instead of using his tongue to get that jam off his lip. "She's really nice."
Harry blushes in the kiss, and it wasn't until Draco leaned away that he wanted those lips back on his own to kiss them and keep them warm with saliva. "Merry Christmas, Draco Malfoy."
"Sorry, Harry," Cedric said, looking down at the young Gryffindor with concern. He was worried he might have made Harry fall down just like when students get pat on the back by Professor Hagrid. "Are you alright?"
Harry's green eyes looked at Draco with both worry and sadness. "I hadn't thought about that," he said, frowning. He didn't want to go back to the Dursleys. They make his life a living nightmare. "I've been so focused about the tournament and us. Two months-"
"Yes, mother," Draco said to her but turned to face the gate and muttered, "Collaris." The gates turned a bright pink colour, even the Malfoy crest was coloured pink, and he smirked.
Harry nodded slightly with a small fake smile, sad that Draco must leave but he hopes he'll be seeing him soon. "Thank you for this incredible morning and I hope we will see each other again sometime today."
"What?" Hermione asked him and her voice grew a little louder. She had a bemused smile on her face and couldn't help but chuckle as she could see very clearly the picture in her head. Professor Dumbledore could be an excellent Gandalf. "Oh, that's honestly so wonderful! Oh my god, I have the perfect idea. I should ask Professor Dumbledore if we can dress up as our favourite characters for a day. Consider it Book Week like we did in Primary School."
Pansy gave Ivy a knowing smile, knowing a little to why Ivy would choose Fleur over the other contestants. The first reason is that she's a girl and has really good looks. "Is it because you find her...hot?"
Harry jumping on him with his arms around his neck and kissed him like he would never see him again. Draco nearly fell over but kissed back passionately and cupped his hands over Harry's cheek. As they both let go of the kiss, they couldn't help but look into each other's beautiful eyes and smile at each other.
Pansy looked behind her as she entered the yellow tunnel after Blaise. She squealed out of fright and shouted, "HE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME! GO!"
Draco sighed; he knew Harry would want to ask questions. But it was good for him to know. "It's you, Harry," he said in a gentle voice and looked into those green eyes that sparkled in the sun and moonlight. "I've noticed you not eating much at all and it's really worrying."
Harry was just walking through the castle alone, contemplating about his life and what it would be like if he had dreamt the whole thing about Hogwarts and woke up back in his cupboard under the stairs. He then saw a familiar set of Hufflepuff robes walking towards the Divination tower. It was Cedric Diggory. Harry didn't know if he should call out his name and have a conversation about something or just let him be. But neither of those options mattered as Cedric came over to him.
They were now directly in front of each other, with both of their faces only inches away. Harry looked across the crowd again, which was now watching with an aura of slight confusion as to where this confrontation was going.
"I thought we were friends," Ron said as an organ fell out of his stomach onto the floor with a 'plop' beside Harry. It was his liver.
Draco felt his heart flutter at the word 'boyfriend'. Is that what they are now? Boyfriends? They've only been on this one date though...
Draco ignored the question and started walking down the stairs, wanting to look brave in front of Harry. He didn't want to appear like a coward or a scaredy-cat. It's not impressive at all! The Gryffindor followed behind Draco until they came to two familiar doors, except the Hufflepuff door was replaced by a green and silver door.
Harry forced a smile, hoping it was enough for her to believe. "Yeah," he said dazedly and wished he was back up in his room, sleeping the week away. "I slept fine."
"Um..." Harry said a little uneasily, and he sat up, rubbing his arm up and down. Could he say it? After a moment of thinking about if he can, he finished. "The first time happened during the night of the Yule Ball. After dinner at the tables, we headed out and he took me to the Slytherin common room and to the boy's dormitory. We were making out on his bed, and his knee touched a part of me and rubbed that spot over and over again until I... um... you know. And err... he cleaned me up with his tongue and mouth. He gave me my first blowjob and then I did the same for him."
"Farewell, my pupils. It is lunchtime, go fill your bellies with what muggles call party food," the professor said.
"Good," Ivy nodded sternly at him. She'll make sure he keeps her promise. "And it's Harry to you. Oh, why don't you actually try to befriend Harry sometime?" she suggested to him. "It would be so much easier being friends with him and then you can ask him out when the time feels right."
"Names?" Harry asked almost eagerly. He wondered what males Hermione knew that were blonde, handsome, and hopefully available.
Draco sighed with relief; he thought he'd have to teach Harry every colour of the rainbow or something similar to that. Thank Merlin! "Good! And what's the colour of Myrtle wood?"
"You wanted to go to the secret room after lunch?" Harry then whispered to a blushing Draco Malfoy. He believes it's a place that he and Draco should be at right now. "I believe now would be the best time."
"What if I end up with a guy, Perce?" asked a scared Ron. What if he falls in love with a guy? What would that be like though? "What will mom and dad say?"
Before they got onto the entrance bridge, Harry froze under a tree, turned around to face Draco and looked into silver eyes. He cupped his hands over Draco's cheeks and kissed him softly and slowly. He didn't want to let go of the kiss at all because all he wanted was to spend the whole day with his boyfriend.
Harry walked over to Draco's bed and he got in easily. When he saw the smirk appear on Draco's face, he closed the curtain, shutting out all light from in Draco's bed. He pulled off his cloak and leaned down on his Slytherin, crushing him under his body. "Well hello again, my love," he says silently and nearly purs when Draco's hands move up his body and grip onto his arse cheeks. "Needy, are we?"
"I... um," said Draco and he ran a hand through his hair. How could he tell Harry that he had come in his own pants and he wants Harry to do the exact same thing that he did to him? "Harry... I- I kind of came too. In my pants, I mean."
"It was never too early, Harry," Seamus then said, getting both his dormmates attention. "Ye can start doing whatever with Draco whenever ye're ready. And so ye know, people around the world do have sex on the first date. Even gay couples."
"Hermione and I are just friends," Harry said, and he suddenly smiled at Viktor's curiosity. He's either too blind to see it or It seems Viktor's got a thing for Hermione. Maybe he's just bluffing? "I'm being honest."
"Sorry," Harry said with a pained expression and he frowned a little. But right now, he had to tell Hermione something quite important. "Um... Hermione, a word please?" Hermione raised an eyebrow at him and looked at Ron who shrugged and walked over to Seamus, Neville, and Dean.
Dean sat up immediately and smiled knowingly at Harry. He actually saw it happen too. He just couldn't stop staring at the two who looked as if they were in deep love with the other. It was beautiful. " How was it?"
"When were you first introduced to muggle items by her?" Draco asked, his eyebrow raising slightly. "And I haven't seen her come by once this year. Where do you have these movie nights?"
Harry laughed from under the mask. He enjoys the humorous professor so much, and he cannot believe he would think that. He just likes making a good impression on Draco's family and godfather. "I'll see you soon, professor. You will be at the Funhouse for the party, right?"
Harry blushed and looked down at the floor, smiling and rubbing at his neck. "Heh. Really?" he said, a little intrigued about what Cedric and Draco talked about. "Did he say anything about me?" Yet again it wasn't a question.
"Harry," Hermione said, a little worriedly. How didn't he know that she's been there for minutes? She keeps wondering what's going through her best fr8uends mind every day, but she knew of one reason: Draco Malfoy. "She's been here for a while now; I can't believe you never noticed her."
Harry closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind, but all the depressing thoughts were clogging his mind. He thought about everything he liked. Quidditch, Treacle Tarts and Draco. Then he opened his eyes, pointed his wand at the book and said, "Accio Book!" The book flew right into his hands, and he gripped onto it with ease.
"Hello, Harry," he says as they walked together to the Great Hall. "Sorry about earlier. How was your night? Did you get enough sleep?" The questions just seemed to pop out of his mouth every three seconds.
He looked around the room, seeing nobody still. He had heard Pansy before but that didn't matter anymore as she's gone. He looked back at Draco and fumbled to pull down Draco's pants and white boxers together. He looked down and licked his lips at the cock that jumped out and into his line of sight. He leaned down, scenting the Slytherin's musky smell from his cock, pressed Draco's cock to the grey school jumper and licked from the base of his cock up to the velvety head.
"Look! A white strand hair," Harry said quickly with unwavering eye contact, noticing a strand of ferret hair in the grass. He walked up to it, crouched down to the ground, and grabbed it.
Dumbledore got up and walked over to his golden owl podium and looked out at his pupils. Everyone in the Great Hall turned their attention back to their Headmaster. He began speaking about the schools that would be attending Hogwarts for the Tri-wizard tournament.
It was just a soft touch of lips until Draco began to move his lips a little, gliding them backwards but then opening his mouth a little only to connect them back onto Harry's. Harry was feeling some strange sensation in his legs, they felt so weak. What was happening? His hand stayed on Draco's cheek and he felt like he was melting when he could literally taste the Slytherin's saliva. Was this a good thing because he hoped so.
Blaise chuckled at the obvious jealousy emitting from this Gryffindor. Someone definitely has a crush on his best friend. "Ivy Black's just a friend of Draco's and a distant relative. Why?" he added in a teasing tone of voice and smirking. "Is someone jealous?"
Pansy's eyes widened a little and she backed away from the sight she was seeing. Merlin... She didn't want to see anything else and definitely not any kind of moans from her friends. "I'm off to Herbology now," she whispered to them but was only managed to gain Draco's attention.
Lavender nodded excitingly, biting her lip. "EEEEEEK!" she squealed as she couldn't believe that just happened. She could have hugged her professor but didn't want to get into trouble from it. "Thank you, Professor. I will, I will give it the life of royalty."
Before Harry could leave, Cedric came and stood directly in front of him with a half-smile. "Hello, Harry," he said awkwardly, and it seemed he had something on his mind to say. "I guess we're both competing then. How did you do it?"
Joslyn stared at the ground, gathering her thoughts. How could she say this without telling him his future? "Uh... Well... There is this woman... Her name is J.K. Rowling. Many people believe she's a seer and is trying to predict your future. She's written a couple of books on you. Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of fire and others."
"How about yours for a change?" Draco suggests, raising his eyebrows a little. He smirks as he says, "I'm sure Blaise, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle have had enough of hearing me screaming your name during the night, and the other way around."
Harry looked back up at the Slytherin table again and caught Draco staring at him which he gave a small wave and tried to smile at the Slytherin. He watched as Draco gave a smile back at him with familiar and adorable pink tinges to his cheeks.
Harry gave Dean the best possible fake smile he could ever-present, which turned out that it wasn't very big. "I'm fine, really," he said half-heartedly, finding it hard just to look over at his dormmate when it should be so easy. "Thanks for asking..."
Draco sat silently on his grey canopy bed in his forest green silk Pajamas with his legs crossed. He was reading a muggle book called 'Twilight' after coming back from the shower and shaving his legs. He liked the feel of his legs after shaving, so very soft and smooth.
Harry looked over at Draco who was talking to Pansy and Ivy. He noticed Ivy waving at him and whispering something in Draco's ear, Draco immediately looked up, wriggled his fingers at him with a charming smile and blew a kiss to him. Harry blushed even redder and looked up at Hermione. "Fine, but what happened between you and Pansy?" He was curious about what had happened between the two.
Ron shrugged with a smile and headed for the door but faced Harry when doing so. "Let's just go, Harry," he said and opened the door, feeling the cool air from the common room flow into the room. "Apparently, the house-elves have made bagels, omelette and croissants."
"I- I did not say any of that!" Draco spat with a single stutter, not liking how right they were. He remembers saying something close to what they were saying. He hated how others can be right when talking to him. Why can't he be right for once?
He paced back and forth a few feet away from the Slytherin entrance and waited for some Slytherin's to appear. He didn't see any. After all, it would be close to eight in the morning but he's sure people start getting up at around eight or try to.
"We don't mind at all, mate," said Ron, shaking his head at him. Hermione nodded in agreement at Ron.
Harry sighed, lucky he and Ron made up even if he is still a bit sad about it. "He's been mad at me," he says, crossing his arms and looked to the floor, frowning a little. "He thought I put my name in the damn goblet."
All new types of dishes were served such as Bulgarian Shopska Salad, Tripe soup, Stuffed peppers, and French Boeuf Bourguignon, Potatoes Dauphinoise, Cassoulet and Cherry Clafoutis.
Hermione grinned as she just thought of an idea. She had to tell Pansy! She wondered if Pansy could sing. She hasn't heard her at all, and she must!
Harry crossed his arms over the table and leaned his head on his arms, wishing he had free reign to go over to the Slytherin table and sit down with Draco. He wants it to happen though. "He's damn well good at it," he mumbled and questioned why he even exists if his life is just full of mistakes.
