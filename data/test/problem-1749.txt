Nearly everyone left on Christmas holiday, stranding Draco with the house elves, a handful of miserable students, and unexpected waves of boredom.

Merlin, he had been such a fool for thinking he could walk right back into Harry's life like nothing had happened. He had broken Harry’s heart just that morning. He had left, even though Harry had asked him to stay.
Draco groaned. "Don't make me repeat myself, Potter."
But Draco was already running in the other direction. He'd run the length of the entire

“This is my
“Quite.”
Draco sighed and took Potter’s hands, allowing Potter to help him to his feet. Their hands lingered together in the dark long enough for Draco to fully feel the warmth of Potter’s palms pressed against his own. Long enough for the tingling golden heat to fill him to his core. Long enough for Potter’s thumbs to slowly glide across Draco’s knuckles and for Draco's heart to begin beating wildly. Too long. Longer, at least, than any two unattached male colleagues standing next to a bed in the dark should have done much of anything at all.
“You’ll need it for tonight, won’t you?” Draco stirred and allowed his feet to meet the floor as Harry nodded into his tea. Draco made his way to the bathroom sink with his wand in hand, casting a few cleaning charms on himself.
As Harry and Draco leisurely walked back toward the palace, Harry wove his arm through Draco’s and entangled their fingers.

to see the look on Potter’s face when he found out he had produced a Slytherin. He instantly gravitated toward the child. “Mr. Potter,” he said shortly after his introductory lecture, clearing his throat and intending to put this Potter-Weasel on the spot like he had the others in an excuse to shave House points away. But he probably wouldn’t shave as
feeling anything, she hid it as well as a Pureblood politician. And if she wasn’t feeling anything, it meant that she had recovered from the past far better than he had. Regardless, the fact that she seemed to be expressing genuine interest in his academic work was exciting. He was eager to discuss his more advanced work with anyone who would listen--which, as it so happens, wasn’t very many people. The moment he ever began eagerly discussing the polarities of potion substances, the elemental components of wolfsbane, the protonic behavior of wormwood, people had a tendency to gloss over. But not Granger. He let his arms relax. He felt his shields coming down already.
realized that he sounded a bit like a sullen teenager.
Ho. ly. Shit. Potter had said exactly what he thought he'd said.
Draco could feel Harry stiffen beside him, could see his fingers tightening around his knees. Draco pressed his hand gently to Harry’s thigh. “Of course it’s difficult, Mr. Wilson, you understand. Although speaking of managing, how is the economy in the Herbology sector these days? I’ve heard it can be as volatile as a Hungarian Horntail. A difficult Herbology market can make life difficult for a Potions Master, you understand.”
there.
“No.”
After his shower and some cosy drying charms, Draco emerged from the bathroom wearing a pale green shirt, a silver waistcoat and trousers, and a dark green tie and suitcoat. He wore his pale hair partially up in a slim ponytail, letting the rest fall long and loose over his shoulders.
. He thought of Potter sweeping in to save him from the Fiendfyre. He thought of the way Potter had looked at him during the trial, that desperate kindness in his eyes after everything Draco had done.
He focused. It hurt like hell, but he managed to lift his finger a centimeter and tap it against the mattress. It was barely a movement. It was barely even a noise. But Granger, clever creature that she was, turned around. “What?” she asked. Draco aimed the tip of his finger at his desk. To his last remaining vial. “You want to take Potion Eight?”
As soon as the meeting finished, Draco jumped out of his seat. He refused to look at Potter. He refused to acknowledge that Potter had even sat next to him, which had been such an odd occurrence in and of itself that Draco wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. “Granger!” Draco called before she could leave. “I was hoping to ask a favour of you.”
. You're brilliant." Harry thrust again. "Mm that's good, Harry,

“A Muggle version of Stone, Cloak, Wand. Come on.”
“Wasn’t he a Death Eater?”
There was a round, three-tiered white fountain at the corner of his desk on the floor, about two feet across and four feet high. It was precisely where Potion 3 had spilled. Draco crawled over to the potion and sniffed. It smelled terrible, yet vaguely familiar. He reached a finger into the fountain, watching a nearly-clear liquid run over his finger. He brought his finger to his nose, and then placed his finger on his tongue. “Vermouth,” he told the fountain as if it should be ashamed of itself. “A Fountain of Vermouth.” Again, this is why students should not be allowed to create their own potions. Or at least why Hogwarts should not be saving all of them in the dungeons alongside donations like ingenious dissertations.

of Draco’s interest in his father, much less actually encourage them to confront each other. Yet James often tried to lure them outside with the possible threat of another dementor or Dark Mark. Of course, there were never actually any dementors or Dark Marks, but Draco and Harry still had to make silent rounds together until they were sure that the grounds were safe. It wasn’t just James, either. Albus decided to belatedly accept Draco’s offer of flying lessons, and always insisted on a day when Potter was practicing seeker skills with James and Lily on the other half of the pitch. And then of course there was Lily, their waltzing warden, who was constantly eyeballing them hopefully behind her Charms homework.

Draco sat at the edge of the door frame, letting his feet dangle in the air for a moment before placing his feet on the familiar floor of the Slytherin toilets, and slowly, slowly slid through. It felt bloody strange, having gravity shift directions around him like that. “Close it,” Draco said, once on his hands and knees on the tile floor. Albus closed the door. Draco pushed himself to his feet and brushed off his hands and knees. “Mr. Potter! I am hoping you can help me with a little project.” Draco immediately walked over to the sink to wash his hands. “What door did you just try to open?”
“Oh yes, very grave indeed. Certainly not. Of course you wouldn’t want to give any more power to the Death Eaters, Mr. Potter. Especially after seeing your wife murdered before your very eyes! Terrible! However did you manage it?”
“You clearly have a reason behind this.”
“Aw, I was hoping to get at least a nice even three,” Weasley said. “It has been a shit week, after all. I think you’re losing your touch, Harry.”
“And you think it’s my first time?”
At first he felt nothing.
? Harry was kneeling at Draco’s ankles, his eyes filling with fire as he took in the sight of Draco’s lean, bare form and erect cock. “So this is what you’ve been hiding,” Harry whispered. Still semi-clothed from his hips down, Harry crawled between Draco’s legs, nestling himself between them. Draco’s cock twitched beneath Harry’s gaze and Harry gave that same knowing, arrogant little smirk he'd given the morning he fell into Draco's bed.
and finally it was his. He pulled Harry more tightly into his arms, mussing his hair as their tongues met and they slowly began rutting against each other.
need for you to leave now, Potter.” The pain was beginning to slowly build again, and he knew he had to get Potter out of his room. In fact, no one was allowed in his room for the rest of the weekend. He couldn’t take that risk. Before he could even catch himself, he was blurting words again. “I just found out about your wife, and I’m so sorry, Potter. About everything. About her, and the pyjamas, and I have so much respect for how you’ve handled it, because I’d have Obliviated myself if I--” Draco smushed the pillow back over his mouth.
job correctly. Draco crept into the shadows of the doorway. His boots were nearly silent on the thin red carpet that ran down the center of the room. He cast two Expelliarmus spells, one after the other, followed by binding and disillusionment spells.
. Potter stumbled backward and gasped as they fell against the bar, the wood jutting into Potter’s back. Draco was suddenly filled with a desire to make Potter gasp
not trying to think about that blissful night in the shower. Merlin.
Draco looked around the wet, dark stone, trying to re-acquaint himself. As a Slytherin he was no stranger to Hogwarts dungeons, but these were another beast entirely. He had some memory of these deep dungeons from his searches in sixth year, but he was still impressed with how large this first room was. And how damp. Attached to the main room were at least six doors and three corridors. Draco strained to remember the layout of the dungeons. He knew that if he traveled south he would end up in mazes, or dead ends, or drippy caverns beneath the lake. If he traveled west he would surely encounter the old catacombs. That left north and east as his most likely options. He began with north, walking down seemingly endless corridors and poking his head into room after room, sometimes only to discover that they weren’t rooms at all but hallways that led elsewhere. Draco felt like he had barely made any progress after four hours of exploration, and decided that, as he progressed with this project, he needed to bring in more tricks from the archaeological trade. He needed exploration spells--things that would map out the dungeons as he went, jot down notes about each room as he said them aloud. That way, he could at least explore the dungeons more systematically; he would waste less of his time covering old ground.
started behaving, Draco would lose all of his opportunities to remove points from Gryffindor. Where was the fun in that? “Yes, well, you shouldn’t listen to everything your father says. I never do.”
The only person Potter had ever tried to bring home from a pub was a male Death Eater? Maybe Potter wasn’t even remotely as straight-ish as he thought. He was a beautiful, queer blur, and Draco had now completely lost the power of his defensive chant. Married? Not anymore. With Children? Yes, but they weren’t so bad; he was even growing fond of them. Straight as an arrow? Most definitely not.
“Oh, just shut up, get in the fucking bed and go to sleep.”
“Mr. Potter!” One of the Ministry members stood, eagerly extending a hand. “Oh, Mr. Potter. Thomas Wilson, at your service. It is
“Almost there...”
“In case this doesn’t work, I need you to
“One more,” Potter said.
It was just one night.
Draco listed off the ingredients he had been able to identify.
Was Potter alright?
“Oh?” Draco's mouth twitched.
Draco undid the Incarcerous, and Draco and Potter scrambled away from each other as quickly as possible. Potter grabbed one of the many green silk pillow from behind Draco’s head and sat up, pulling the pillow immediately to his crotch. Draco pulled himself into an upright position, bending his knees high and wide beneath the sheet so that his erection wasn’t visible. He pulled the sheets up to his neck. He really wasn’t ready for anyone to see his Dark Mark or his scars. Sure, Potter already
Harry pressed two fingers inside of Draco and curled them until he was massaging Draco's prostate. Draco hissed sharply between his teeth, bucking against Harry's hand. "How about now?" Harry asked. "Brilliant?"

Draco would gladly accept any torments that Longbottom wanted to inflict upon him, just not right
“Is it alright if I begin?” Draco asked.
Potter. He could face a train full of screaming children. He could face Granger, who had every reason to despise him. But somehow the thought of facing Potter was so much worse. So much harder. He hadn’t actually seen Potter since the trials, and even then they hadn’t spoken directly. Come to think of it, they hadn’t actually
Draco's nervous energy was getting the upper hand. He took a fidgeting step, fully intending to continue his search for Harry.
before he pulled his leather satchel over his head and set it in a chair, resisting a childish urge to jump up and down on his new silk bed.
They both looked up as a stag-shaped Patronus walked through the wall and up to Harry, whispered something in his ear, and disappeared. “What does he want this time?” Draco asked. James had gotten into the habit of sending a Patronus any time he wanted to deliver a message. James still hadn’t recovered from his excitement at being able to cast one, and insisted it was far better than sending an owl. It was getting a little excessive, in Draco's opinion. Draco had been startled out of his wits on at least three occasions; he hated turning around to see an unexpected floating blue shape ghosting toward him.
Potter shifted uncomfortably, blushing a little. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea--” he cleared his throat. “I have patrol, and...” he murmured something completely unintelligible.
He stopped by the kitchens for an early breakfast, grabbing an extra pastry and pumpkin juice in case he happened to run into Harry. Considering his next destination was Harry's quarters, the prospect of running into Harry was quite likely.
“Shouldn’t you be plotting in your evil lair?”
late, I think.” Harry ignored all of Draco’s attempts to escape, clinging to him like a spider monkey as he sucked at Draco’s neck.
“So...
Draco took the scroll and pulled it flat between his fingers. On May Second there was to be a grand celebration, including a grand feast and a grand ball, to commemorate the anniversary of the grand victory over Voldemort. The grand guest of honor, Harry Potter, would be part of the grand events. The grand Harry Potter would be available to shake hands, serve the first dish, and lead the first dance. Everything was going to be very grand. ...Draco really hoped they had actually bothered to run all of this by Potter before they decided to print all of these grand scrolls. Draco closed the scroll and looked up at Lily. “I...”
Fuck.
Draco flung open his father’s deep wardrobe--practically a room itself--and began to browse. Black, black, black, everything was

just some ghostly glimpse into the past. Yes, somewhere in the castle was a version of himself at the same age as this particular Potter. And yes, this particular Potter would inevitably become the man who would spectacularly suck his cock on the floor of the Quidditch changing room and wear his shirts and kiss him goodbye. However, as desperately as he wanted to be near Harry,
At that moment in Draco's arms, Potter was so impossibly beautiful that he could hardly fathom it. Merlin, could he really have this? Would Potter actually let him

“How very Potter of you.”

“Dad!” Lily Luna had called from the Gryffindor table, and ran toward Potter. He swooped her up, pecked her on the cheek, and paused in the middle of the Great Hall. His ugly duckling had wrapped her arms around Potter’s neck and was whispering something into his ear. The results of the Sorting Hat, no doubt. He had whispered something back, and she was nodding. He kissed her on the cheek again, set her down, and continued alone toward the head table.
Young Potter sat on his bed and punched his mattress once. Twice. A small snowy owl landed in the window with parchment in its beak. Harry looked up. “I wish Buckbeak had ripped him to pieces, Hedwig!” Harry was back on his feet again, pacing back and forth. “It’d serve him right! Why can’t he just—” Harry took the letter from the owl during one of his bouts around the room, but slapped it on a desk and didn’t bother reading it. He tore himself out of his robes in a violent huff, packed them into a tight ball between his angry hands, and threw them across the room as hard as he could with a yell. Apparently that wasn’t enough, so he pulled one shoe off and threw it against the wall with all of his strength, and then the other. Apparently none of this violence was terribly unusual, because the owl seemed completely unfazed. “I hope he gets eaten by a thousand hippogriffs, for all I care!” Potter yelled, opening a tin and producing a treat. The owl took it, accepted a frustrated pat on the head, and flew off.
“Malfoy!” Potter chased after him. Draco was certainly popular today. “I need to talk to you.” Draco noted the sternness of his voice. Potter had always utilized the word
him a great deal. It was hard to deny that much when his thoughts had so quickly shifted from a determination to avoid Potter completely, to an overwhelming desire to snog him until they couldn't remember their own names. Harry still wouldn't look Draco in the eyes, and that was becoming its own special brand of torture. He was tempted to grab Harry's face between his hands and
“Right! Yes! A boost!” He stood up too quickly and lost his balance on the mattress. He toppled forward, his head nearly colliding into Draco’s chest. Potter reached reflexively up toward Draco’s shoulders, and Draco pressed his hands to Potter’s arms to steady him. Potter straightened, and, well he was

been in his satchel the whole school year, it should have responded to his summoning spells. Yet here it was, gleaming at him. A bit of a mystery, that. He could only assume that Potter or one of his scheming children had stolen it temporarily to delay his potions progress and then returned it by slipping it into his bag when they left Hogwarts the day before.
“It’s good to see you, Draco,” Greg Goyle smiled, patting his back forcefully. “It’s been far too long.”
, and I don’t want him to embarrass himself--or me--in front of the whole country. The whole world, really.”
“What’s happened?”  Narcissa asked as worry crossed her face.
Draco, breathing hard, wiggled his ass to try to get Harry to move. After just a moment, the dark haired man began a slow rhythm, trying to make the sensations last as long as he could. It was bliss. Draco was hot and tight, everything Harry imagined he would be.
"Oh for Merlin's sake, Harry! Get with it. I'm talking about Luna!" She rolled her eyes at him like he was supposed to know exactly what she was talking about.
“Draco, what on earth?”  Narcissa muttered, rubbing her son’s back and making him raise his hands above his head.
Draco had changed his name from Malfoy, to Black.  Taking his mother’s maiden name had seemed like the right thing to do after he’d been disinherited by his asshole father.  The man still refused to admit that he’d been wrong.  Arrogant to his dying day.  Draco didn’t let it bother him.  He felt it was only right and fitting that the Malfoy line would end with Lucious.  He only had himself to blame after all.  Throwing in with a man like Tom Riddle and inciting a bitter war that destabilized the population and the markets.  It had been a foolish endeavor, ill fated from the start.
"Of course I will, Mione," he said. "I'll do anything to get away from this nightmare."
"Don't you worry about this nasty business with the dark lord.   There's nothing the stragglers can throw at us that my Draco can't handle."  She stated with a certainty as she smiled at Harry sipping his tea.
“Draco, love is love.  It’s a powerful and unexplainable force that just is.  It can’t be controlled and shouldn’t be questioned.  Who cares if other people trust you?  Harry trusts you, and I trust you and that’s all that matters.  As for your father, he has absolutely no say whatsoever in the matter.  I’m sorry to say that I fell in love with a despicable human being and I failed to listen to people who tried to tell me.  So forget about him.  Draco the man was wrong about everything.  Now go on and unpack, and sort yourself out.  This stew will be ready in about 20 minutes."  She stated as she waved him to the door.  Draco headed upstairs and knocked on the door of the room he thought Harry was in.
“Karate, healing, and diagnostics, for starters.” Harry answered.  “And don’t think I can’t see that smirking-smiley shit.”  Draco smiled outright at that, even giving a small chuckle.
“I see.  Well since he’s here he can bloody well make himself useful.  Let him help mechant, and you over here and help me with the potions.  We can get ahead of the orders a bit with the extra set of hands.”  Draco nodded and grinned to himself.  He was certain that nothing much phased the old bat.
“I’ll clean up darling.  You two better get ahead on to the Ministry.”  Narcissa stood and began clearing plates and heading into the kitchen.  “This was delightful, really Harry.  You come by anytime.”  Narcissa called.  Draco stood and smiled to himself.
Harry had never felt anything as incredible as Draco's cock inside him.  He couldn't help but groan loudly at the feeling as his fingers dug into the gorgeous blond's shoulders.
“Darling!  You’ve really outdone yourself!  This place is righteous!”
“Draco, you can’t be serious! This is Potter we’re talking about. If you don’t snap him up, then someone else will. Forgive me for wanting my best friend to have the best.” Pansy huffed then sat back down and resumed sipping her tea in silent fury. The blonde slytherin just rolled his eyes and shook his head.
Harry shifted in his chair as well.  This conversation was taking an interesting turn.  “Okay.  First, Pansy fancies ‘Mione?  I wonder how she’d take that if she knew. Second, if you knew you were gay since sixth year, how come no one ever saw you with anyone?  Everyone knows sixteen year old boys have the libido of a dragon, pardon the pun.”
He speared a sausage with his fork and held it up to his nose. "Draco, your sausage smells amazing." He then took a big bite. "Tastes even better."
"Fucking hell."  He breathed.  "That was perfect!"
"Wait just a minute," Harry said. "Before you ask your question, Professor, would you kindly explain how you are not dead anymore?"
“Oh I’ll do that but you’re going to fuck me afterwards.  I’m tired of endless foreplay.  So you’re going to put that beautiful prick of yours where it belongs.  In my ass.”  Draco moaned thrusting his hips and fucking himself deeper into harry’s throat.
“I understand.  Actually I’m looking forward to it.  I really can’t thank you enough for sending me down there Hermione.  You certainly didn’t owe me any favors but you really did me a solid.  I love this job.  Heck, I even like working with old Piston.  She’s a quip and a half most days.”  Draco said, looking at his tea cup rather than to show how embarrassed he was about how desperate his situation had been until recently.  Draco was slightly worried about how Harry would react to how he and his mother had been reduced.  He wasn’t sure what Harry was expecting, but he wasn’t the spoiled rich kid that Harry was familiar with.  Draco didn’t know what he’d been thinking when he’d suggested Harry stay with him.  He worried his lip with his teeth and tried not to think about it.
The rest of the afternoon went by quickly. They stayed busy and only had to deal with a little light teasing from Merchant and Piston about their little display earlier. Harry took it in stride. Even though this new threat loomed over him, he was surprisingly in a good mood.
After a moment of silence, Harry said, “Hang on.  What’s this about you, Pansy, and meddling?”
They kept walking toward the bar at the back of the club and, the further they went, the more risque the photos of Draco were. As a matter of fact, behind the bar itself was a large, black and white photo of Draco against a black background, fully nude with only his hands covering his bits. Ron gasped and clapped a hand over his eyes.
“Mum, I think I might have a problem.”  The young man stated as he peeled the potatoes that she sat in front of him while she began chopping carrots.
“So how’s business at the club?” Pansy asked after a short while.
Harry could do nothing but sit there for a moment.  All of his pain was gone but he was still baffled by Draco.  At some point, the blonde had taken self defense?
“Firewhisky it is, then.” Harry grinned, pushed Draco down into his chair, and sat on his lap.  He then proceeded to engage the blond in a deep, soul stealing kiss. Neither of them noticed Pansy who had walked up and was watching through the office door window, and they also didn’t see the smirk on her face.
Brilliant. She was brilliant.
“Malfoy?”
Perhaps the best part was: no one would expect it. No one would expect Draco to return to society looking like a prince. No one would expect him to look like the hero instead of the villain. He suspected that he would be the talk of all of Wizarding London, and for the first time in a
I hope you enjoyed this fic as much as I enjoyed writing it! I don't know about you, but I needed some sweet, sweet Drarry escapism. I figured it was time to pull out this old fic, brush off the dust, and finally post it. It certainly hasn't been doing anyone any good by hiding on my computer for the last two years.
It was gone. Completely gone. The entire room was staring at him.
with one arm tucked against his torso and the other stretching forward as handsomely as if it was something he had done his entire life. Harry was bowing not to Lily but to
“In the Healing wing with some kind of flu,” Weasley said a little sadly.
Draco dropped his bag against the sofa and sat down. On closer inspection, the sofa was not as comfortable as it appeared to be. The cushions sank deeply into it, causing a sharp slab of wood to dig into one’s bum, or back, or whatever body part one was attempting to relax with. Draco had intended to take the sofa merely to avoid sharing a bed with Harry, but that option was looking highly unpleasant.
And then someone screamed. A terrible, blood-curling scream.
“Are you...er...feeling alright, Draco?” Potter asked.
Draco crashed against the hallway wall, so desperate to stay on his feet that he managed to roll against the wall until it was firmly pressed against his back. He tried to reach for his wand, but it had already been forced out of his hand. Draco's eyes frantically assessed his surroundings as his mind raced to find a new plan.
Draco crawled into bed wearing his green silk robe, still wearing his clothes underneath. He didn’t feel safe undressing. Doors kept opening in strange places in his room, and he kept having to shout “Out!” over and over and over. So many late-night students seemed to gravitate toward his vermouth fountain before they noticed his presence that he had to put a protective ward over it. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. He opened the door to his room and walked through it. Into the Hufflepuff common room, if the colours were any indication. Two lady Hufflepuffs were fiercely snogging in front of the fireplace. They looked up at Draco and squeaked, one scrambling off of the other. Draco turned right back around and walked back through the door. Closed it. Looked around his room. Opened it again, and walked into the shallows of the lake. Turned around. Closed it. Dried his trousers with the wave of a wand. Opened the door again. Stepped into the greenhouse. Turned back into his room. The room where he had drank Potion 1. As he stood by his front door, scratching his head, a door appeared in his floor. A student’s face popped up, a little at an angle, like a confused groundhog, and then retreated. “Wait!” Draco called. He walked over to the door, where a young Albus Severus Potter was looking nervously at him from the Slytherin dormitory toilets. Draco felt a little out of sorts looking at a boy in his floor who was clearly standing upright in another room elsewhere in the castle, but from Draco's perspective appeared to be lying flat on his back in Draco's floor. “Step back,” Draco said. “I’m coming through.”
It was late Tuesday night. Draco didn't remember much about what had happened at the pub that weekend, but he did remember the golden taste of Harry Potter's earlobe in his mouth. Or at least he thought he did. It didn't seem rationally possible. He was starting to wonder if the whole thing had been a glorious dream, because whenever Draco tried to get Potter's attention, Potter's cheeks would flush and he would avoid direct eye contact. It was beginning to make Draco wonder if they had ever evolved out of adolescence.
Draco looked into the remaining Death Eaters' faces, and his stomach clenched as he recognized the one in the middle. He was the Death Eater who had appeared in the newspaper. The one who had

. Despite the stubble already growing around his lips, he was surprisingly soft and incredibly warm. Potter’s eyes were so close and attentive and so beautifully
“What is it?” Harry asked, sensing his distress.
"It's fine, Hermione. We're only just down the hall," Harry pulled his keys out of his robes and began unlocking their hotel room. “I’d feel more comfortable if any Aurors were posted at the childrens’ suite tonight. Draco and I can handle ourselves.”
And Draco was wearing...well...nothing.
“Oh for the love of--”

all too willing to look the other way if he misbehaves, so believe it or not, I appreciate your efforts. Sometimes he can be a git, but he’s my git, and I’m sorry if he--that he--” Draco could hear Potter scratching his head in the dark. “Well you may be in for a difficult year. I’m afraid he wasn’t very fond of you, even before you became the Potions Master--”
he felt it. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s chest and the golden light surged through them, almost unbearably warm and pleasant. He could practically feel it restoring Harry's strength.
A slow and steady dripping broke the silence that followed. The rain had arrived, leaving dark stains in the dirt. One plump drop spattered against Draco’s temple before the rain fully began pelting against him. Draco leaned back against the dirt wall, breathing heavily. He had never said anything like that aloud to anyone before. Yet, overcome with anger, he had somehow been able to tell
“Do you have anything to say for yourself, Mr. Potter?” Draco asked. He couldn’t bring himself to simply say

Weasley shoved his way between Draco and Potter and slapped them both on the back. He saw the bed, slowly grinned, and then erupted into mischievous laughter. When he saw Potter and Draco both glaring at him, he cleared his throat and sobered his expression. “That’s uh...that’s unfortunate, mates.” He patted Harry on the shoulder. “I’d offer to help, but I wouldn’t be caught dead sharing a bed with Malfoy, and he sure as hell is not sharing a bed with my wife, even if he does prefer blokes. You’ll just have to grin and bear it, I’m afraid. Tough luck, chaps. See you at dinner!” With that, Weasley left the room and their hotel room door slammed closed.
"How can Dobby be helping Master Draco?"
After what seemed like hours but was in reality only minutes, Draco entered the workshop-and Harry was happy to see that Blaise wasn’t with him. Draco’s eyes roamed the workshop but settled on Harry fairly quickly.
“Perhaps the wrackspurts took them,” Luna suggested, “They like to take things that aren’t theirs. Did your cousin ever receive any gifts from Santa that were not something he would normally enjoy?”
Draco watched as Potter shifted his weight from one foot to the other, and wondered whether he had intended to cause himself such discomfort…a glance at the chains and the dildo-Draco estimated that it was approximately six inches in length and a couple inches in diameter-assured him that Potter had arranged for the discomfort on purpose; there were other ways to experiment with bondage which would have been vastly more comfortable.
Twenty minutes later Hadrian settled into the window seat in Draco's room; he was wearing an old set of Draco's clothing-it looked brand new however-which consisted of a pair of black slacks, a light grey shirt and an emerald-green over-robe. Along with the clothing, Draco had also given him a wand holster that was strapped to his forearm; having never had one before Hadrian amused himself for several minutes flicking his wrist to release the wand from the holster, before looking out onto the gardens below.
"Yeah, a lot happened that I need to tell you and Fred about," Hadrian said, "I don't want to go over it more often than necessary though, so I'll wait for him to get up here."
“Hmm, well, perhaps just one more game,” Draco said thoughtfully; before Harry could respond, Draco pressed forward, making Harry throw his head back and moan as he was slowly penetrated by his lover’s thick cock. His limbs trembled, wanting badly to move, until finally Draco bottomed out. There was a short pause, and then his lover was withdrawing; Draco set a slow and steady pace, then wrapped a lube-slicked hand around Harry’s cock. Harry gasped in pleasure as his lover stroked his cock in time with his thrusts, but all too soon that hand fell away.
"Night Hades," Draco replied, resting his chin on top of Hadrian's head. Draco listened as the other boy's breathing evened out and Hadrian fell asleep; Draco followed soon after and the room was silent.
“Okay,” Teddy agreed, and Draco gave silent thanks that Teddy was such an easy-going child.
"G-godfather?" Severus stuttered, paling, "Me? But I don't know anything about raising children!"
"Very well," Draco agreed, "You are welcome to wait in my room after your shower if you wish; Mother should be downstairs by the time we are ready." Hadrian nodded to show that he understood and then headed through the hidden door-it was behind a tapestry of the Malfoy Family Tree-and into his room before heading to his private bathroom.
“I don’t want to hex you,” Hadrian said, “But I will if you don’t listen to me. All she did was grab my arm-she wanted a dance and I told her no, but she wouldn’t listen. I was trying to get away from her when you saw us. I don’t want her, and I’m not rejecting you. I’m not ready to have sex, and I’m not going to let you fuck me just because Parkinson doesn’t understand the word “no”. I’ll wear your clothes though, and we can tell everyone about our relationship when we get back to the party.”
When they finally broke the kiss both boys were out of breath, and Hadrian relaxed in Draco's embrace, leaning his head back on the taller boys shoulder.
“Oh, I made tea bags last night so that we could give the customer’s a free sample,” Luna told him, “This way, people won’t think we’re mean when we tell them they have to go.”
“How will I know what I am?” Harry frowned, “Should I already know?”
“That man was your mother’s cousin, Sirius Black,” Lucius replied, turning his gaze to Harry, “He is also Harry’s godfather.”
"Seeing as how it is summer and I am not currently your teacher you may call me Severus," the dark-haired man informed him, "Now, I have three potions for you, and you must drink them all. The first one is to heal the internal damage-how did your ribs get broken?" He handed Harry a red potion and the brunette made a face, downing it all in one go before he answered.
December 20
“It was Italian,” Draco replied, “She was basically calling on magic to open the path, and show her the way to the Pruitt Estate, which must be where your grandparent’s live. She must have been using family magic to open the mirror; some families have spells that are unique to them, and they guard the magic jealously.”
"By mate you mean...?" Draco whispered in Hadrian's earing, making the brunet blush and saving Narcissa from having to clarify; "Oh. I see," Hadrian said, "Um...but that won't happen right away, will it?"
“I can’t believe she’s doing this!” Ron complained, “Making us live with Slytherins! What if they try to kill us at night?” Harry made a noncommittal noise of agreement, but his mind was elsewhere; namely, he was preoccupied with the thought of having his own bedroom. Why, if he set the right wards he wouldn’t have to go back to that abandoned classroom, at least, not unless he wanted to. He wouldn’t have to wait an entire week to experiment again; he could do something tonight-but what?
April 23, 2011
“The Malfoy’s are settled in as well,” Shacklebolt announced as he returned, “I checked the mark again before I left, and the magical signature traces back to Riddle, so no one will be able to tie it back to you.”
"She is planning to tell them the truth," Severus replied, "Or part of it, at least; Hadrian claimed Sanctuary after being abused by the Muggles, and you granted it, then you discovered last night that he was your Mate and therefore no one is to approach him without your permission. Also, as it is inevitable that someone will slip up and actually call him Hadrian in front of the guests, she will tell them that "Harry Potter" agreed to adopt the name "Hadrian" so that he could better fit in with his new family and distance himself from the Muggles he grew up with."
"Yes, there is being a delivery downstairs," Tillie confirmed, "The wizard is saying animal is in enchanted sleep and will wake when Master Draco opens the present. Which present is Master Hadrian wanting to give at the family party? Mistress and Master has gifts for Young Master before guests is being here."
“I didn’t tell them that part,” Harry admitted, “Santa Clause may be real, but I don’t see how you could be him. Santa has been around for centuries so, unless you’ve been using, I don’t know, some sort of youth potion, I don’t see how you can be him.”
“Go to sleep,” Harry said, “I’ll hex you if you don’t.” Silence. Harry felt himself drifting off, only to be woken by his name being whispered again.
"I need time to think on it," Draco replied petulantly, "I don't think I much like you having a father; it will make getting my way more difficult if he interferes all the time."
"Of course," Draco nodded graciously, "Welcome to Malfoy Manor Longbottom, Lovegood. Tea?" He sat down in a chair in front of the low coffee table, where Tillie had already set up the tea tray. Hadrian took the seat next to him, while Luna and Neville sat across from them.
"Not trying to call you a liar, but yeah; the memories would help," Blaise said, "I don't suppose you have them with you?"
without any hesitation, and then pricked his finger with the tip of the quill, letting the drop of blood land next to his signature before passing the quill and the book back to Griphook. The goblin waved his hand over the book and murmured something too soft for them to hear and Hadrian's signature glowed brightly for a moment before fading.
When the vibration finally stopped Harry just sagged in the chains for a moment, before determinedly getting to his feet. He pulled his hands down and felt the shelf-yes! The ward was gone! He eagerly reached for his wand, only to cry out in dismay when his fingers just brushed the piece of smooth wood, causing it to roll away from him; the shelf Harry had put the wand on was too low for him to reach with his hands still cuffed! He wanted to yell his frustration and destroy something, but Harry forcefully reigned those emotions in, reminding himself that he had set a second timer to deactivate all of his spells just in case he couldn’t get to his wand. The backup release was set an extra thirty minutes after the initial release, so Harry resigned himself to some more waiting.
“We were enemies,” Hadrian reminded him.
“Hadrian?” Draco pushed the door open, “Are you ready to come down for breakfast?”
"I was wondering about something, Narcissa," Hadrian ventured as they were finishing tea; they being Hadrian, Draco, Lucius, Narcissa and Severus-Tom had left to attend to his Death Eater's, "Sirius mentioned that you have two sisters, but I didn't see Andromeda in any of the memories. Were you not close to her?"
“Harry understands,” Draco said, “He knows that this is important to me. If there was some other way…but there isn’t. So, I will go to supper. I will speak to Astoria, and we will come to an agreement that both of us can live with. Maybe, after my heir is born…” Draco sighed, “What I wish to happen never can, so there is no use dreaming about it.” He shook his head and turned his attention back to business. “Will we have enough chocolate for the day? I was glad to see how well it sold yesterday, but it was still embarrassing to run out of product three hours before the close of business.”
It only took Narcissa a few moments to make the short walk from the sitting room down to her son’s room, and then she was quietly opening the door, hoping to catch a glimpse of the boys before they awoke; what she saw made her sigh and smile softly; Draco was sleeping on his back, his pale hair-which he had begun growing out so that it was now chin-length-spread out around his head, and Hadrian lay nearly on top of him, his head resting on Draco's shoulder. Both boys were smiling in their sleep, and Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry possessively. Narcissa closed the door again quietly and then knocked before opening it again.
"Well, we'll go through it and get you a new trunk for this year," Draco said, "Something with different compartments so that you can find things more easily. Perhaps we can go Monday when Mother goes to the ministry to be appointed as your guardian."
"Lilly! James!" Narcissa smiled, "I feel terrible that you have been isolated all this time-"
Once that was taken care of, Severus took out his notes on Horcruxes; there were very few written works about them, and all the information was spread out so that it was hard to gather it in one place, however Severus had an extensive book collection and owned the only book completely dedicated to the evil objects, which was part of a series dedicated to obscure and un-tried magic-oddly enough, the series was authored by Mathias Gryffindor and his wife, Lorena Ravenclaw-Gryffindor. (When Severus had first received the series as a gift from Lucius several years ago, he had discovered that Mathias was Godric Gryffindor's grandson, and Lorena was Rowena Ravenclaw's grand-niece; Mathias had been disowned by his family for his foray into the dark arts, but-as the Ravenclaw family valued knowledge above all else-they were taken in by Lorena's family until they were able to support themselves.)
“Pity,” Draco said, conjuring lengths of green silk and using it to bind Harry spread-eagle on the bed, “The heels really did look divine on you.” Before Harry could reply, a black ball
"I agree," Draco nodded, "I will tell them-after supper. Theo, Blaise-after I open my presents Hadrian and I need to talk to you; we haven't told you the full truth yet, but I think you deserve to know exactly what we found out, and why the Dark Lord is no longer set on killing my mate." Blaise and Theo nodded their agreement as Arden came trotting back over to them, followed by a bemused Severus.
Before he had a chance to settle down and start reading, Arden jumped off the bed and gave a loud chirrup; the dragon made his way over to Hadrian and looked up at him expectantly, but Hadrian wasn’t sure what the dragon wanted. After a moment Arden made the sound again, then moved over to the door, still looking at Hadrian.
Harry supposed it was his own fault, really; after all, if he hadn't picked that night to sneak downstairs and get his school books while the Dursley's were watching the telly in the other room, he never would have been in the cupboard under the stairs, which means he would not have heard the knock on the door. If he hadn't heard the knock on the door, he wouldn't have had to hide in said closet, and he never would have heard the conversation that obviously was not meant for his ears; the conversation between his relatives-and Albus Dumbledore, Harry's trusted headmaster, and once he heard the conversation he could never unhear it, no matter how much he wanted to. But when he first hid in the closet he had no idea about this, so when he heard Dumbledore's voice he sat down on his old cot and listened.
“Oh, it was cancelled for the weekend,” Ginny replied, “So I’ll be able to help some more. I thought you would have come in later; didn’t you have a date last night?”
“That’s probably true,” Harry admitted, “Except, I don’t like that you’re being forced into it too. Which reminds me, I want to help you research the ritual; maybe I can find a way to get us out of having to do it.”
"Yes, well I think I have shown considerable restraint by not attacking you while we still had company in the room," Draco replied before twisting around until he had Hadrian laying down on the couch beneath him, "Of course, we're alone now…"
“Dobby is helping Harry Potter sir!” the elf squeaked, his green eyes wide, “Harry Potter sir is hurt! Dobby will be telling Dumble-”
Draco summoned the enchanted camera and set it to taking pictures again, and then summoned a jar of lube. He crawled between his lover’s legs and began working his fingers inside Harry’s tight hole, slowly loosening him up. Harry moaned and gasped into his gag, and Draco quickly reached for his wand, vanishing the gag so he could hear the sound his
funny.
Draco broke the kiss after a few moments, pulling back to look at Harry.
A few hours later, after a rather boring dinner, Draco escorted Astoria to the parlor Narcissa had chosen to use for the evening. It was called a courting parlor, and had a small alcove that would allow Draco and Astoria to speak in private, while still being in full view of their parents. The privacy spells were tuned to the couple inside the alcove, and would prevent their parents from hearing their conversation.
“Dray, calm down,” Hadrian said, having finally gotten his laughter under control, “I’m sure Arden didn’t mean to hurt you; you probably startled him when you grabbed him so suddenly. If you stop yelling he might be willing to listen to you.” Draco scowled, but then nodded his understanding and looked back at the little dragon, who was now hiding under a pillow with only his nose and his blue eyes visible.
“I don’t think that’s very practical,” Ginny told him, “Not unless you think it will hurt less tomorrow.”
“Apologies,” Draco replies, giving both a warm smile, “I was asked to brew a large batch of potions for Hogwarts after several students fell in the lake.” He shakes his head, “You would think Seventh Years would be old enough to know better than to cast a freezing charm on the lake; the Giant Squid was not happy, and easily broke the ice. Over twenty students fell into the water, wearing their heavy winter cloaks, and had to be treated for hypothermia and frostbite.”
"Is it so horrible to consider the fact that you might be gay, and that you are attracted to me?" Draco inquired.
“No idea,” Harry replied, “But it can’t be a good thing if she’s threatening me with it. Did you eat today?”
"The house elves will stop him," Draco said nonchalantly, "This is simply art, and he shouldn't get offended anyway. Did you know that Parseltongue is similar to Dragontongue? The book Tom gave me said that it is possible, with some practice, for a Parselmouth to learn Dragontongue as well."
"You are as good as new Hadrian," he said, "the bruises are gone, and your broken nose has been healed; in addition, you should be able to speak again-Merlin help us all."
“I see you brought the stray home,” Harry spun around at the voice, nearly falling over. He had only seen Lucius Malfoy for a few minutes at school, and then even more briefly at the platform, and the blond looked no less imposing in his home.
"Well, of course you did," Hadrian said cheerfully, taking Draco's hand as they left the room, "You're an evil Slytherin git, remember?"
******************************
"Narcissa has already taken care of it," Severus assured him as he looked over Hadrian, checking for any signs of injury; "Are you alright Hadrian?" From the research he had done he knew that jealousy often caused Veela to be harsh with their mates, and no one wanted to see Tom try and fight the Veela for hurting his son.
“Er-let’s save the fantasy-sharing for after the bonding,” Harry suggested, his face turning red, “We should discuss the ritual instead.”
"You are being difficult," Draco frowned, "You don't have to tell me every detail of everyday-unless you want to, of course. As for injuries, I don't need to know if you get a paper cut or something similar unless you have unusual side effects, but I would like you to tell me if you get knocked off your broom during Quidditch practice or cut yourself with your potions knife. I know that you wind up in a lot of dangerous situations, and you never rely on anyone other than Weasley and Granger for help; even then, you try to go off on your own. Luna told me you wanted to go to the ministry by yourself last year-I want to make sure you are safe."
“That is something else I need to discuss with the Headmaster,” Mr. Lucius said darkly, “Narcissa, I am going to find Headmaster Dumbledore will you-”
“I’m sorry for worrying you,” Draco said softly, sitting up and cradling Arden in his arms, “I’m not injured. It’s Hadrian; he was taken from me today, and I haven’t been able to find him.” Arden screeched louder at hearing this, and his blue eyes flashed, even as he leapt out of Draco’s arms, gliding towards the door; Arden’s wings weren’t strong enough to support him in true flight yet.
“Sure,” Harry said, and Ginny took the lid off the box; there were ten pieces inside, each one different. One had what looked like a rose petal on top, another a purple flower petal with sugar, and one had a curl of what he thought was orange peel. Harry selected a piece that looked to have sugar crystals on top, and took a bite. He discovered that it was salt, not sugar, on top, and the shell of the candy was dark chocolate, while the filling was caramel. The taste was amazing, the salt and caramel balancing each other perfectly, and Harry couldn’t stop his moan.
"Not very bright, not matter what his opinion of himself is," Lily snorted, "Like we would do anything to help the man who organized our death."
“We are,” Bernard confirmed, “We have tested communications, and the link is stable no matter how far you are from the workshop. You can make the announcement at the meeting with the department heads today, and we will work with them to make sure all the elves stay calm.” Bernard glanced at the clock behind him and added, “Speaking of the meeting, we should head that way. Curtis will finish getting your transportation set up, and Judy will pack for you. Everything will be ready when you get out of the meeting, including the De-Santification Potion.”
"It's not Harry anymore," Hadrian corrected him, "Draco? Am I able to make Dobby my house elf?"
"I am if you want a birthday present," Hadrian retorted, and Draco perked up.
Yay! An update! Sorry for the long wait, but I kept trying to add more information that was missing from the story, and I couldn't make it fit. In the end, I wound up adding the info to another chapter instead. I hope you enjoy the chapter, and  I should have the next one ready to post in a couple of weeks.
"How dare you Zabini?!" Pansy glared at the Italian; "I was not trying to hit on Potter; I was just being friendly, as a favor to Draco! You know that Draco is the only one for me; if I really wanted Potter I could get him though."
"Dobby," Narcissa replied promptly, "Dobby has been very loyal to Har-Hadrian-ever since he freed him, and the elf would think nothing of taking something from us to assist the boy. In this instance, I cannot find it in myself to fault Dobby. You, however, should have altered the wards once he was no longer bound to us. Ah well, what’s done is done and, in this case, your oversight was a good thing.”
"Make them slaves once we've taken over," Draco suggested, "They can work off their crimes by serving those they have harmed. In fact, we can use that as a cover story for Har-er, I mean Hadrian; when we go back to school we can tell everyone I found him and tricked him into wearing this collar so that now he is my slave and then we will put about that this is how you plan to deal with all of your enemies rather than waste your time killing everyone." Draco loomed extremely pleased with himself, and Hadrian saw that Tom appeared to be taking the suggestion seriously.
"Tom arranged a breakout," Lucius replied; Narcissa tilted her head to the side slightly, looking at him with a steady gaze-this was her way of demanding answers, so Lucius continued to explain, "A lot has happened recently, and Severus uncovered some lost memories which have changed many things. Severus, I am going to take Cissa through the memories; can you send a letter off to Gringott’s regarding Hadrian's accounts? You may use the Malfoy seal so that it will receive a quick response."
"It will be done as soon as possible," Lucius told his son, "We still have to finish translating the ritual first, and we need the translation for the potion."
"I thought I told you not to shed on the furniture?" the drawling voice woke him up and he lazily opened one eye to look at Malfoy before closing it again and tuning his head to the side, flicking his tail once in an obvious dismissal, "Get off my bed Potter." Draco poked him in the side and Harry started to swipe a paw at him, but stopped himself as he remembered the pain from earlier and instead sat up and fixed Malfoy with an intense stare. "I know I am attractive Potter, but you don't have to stare.” Harry snorted in disbelief; Malfoy thought Harry found him attractive?! Not a chance! “Now, kindly get off of my bed and I will return you to your human form." Upon hearing that Harry leapt off the bed, landing at Draco's feet; the blonde scowled at him and reached out to place a hand on the collar, giving Harry a warning, "This collar binds you to me in human form as well, so please remember that and try not to attack me." Holding his wand in the other hand he touched it to the collar as well and closed his eyes, his lips moving in a silent spell. Harry felt that familiar tingling again and mentally braced himself for the pain that was sure to follow; he was therefore pleasantly surprised when, instead of pain, he simply found himself back in his human body, kneeling on soft carpeting with Malfoy's cool fingers touching his neck under the collar. Harry opened his eyes only to find Malfoy gazing down at him, a small smirk on his face.
"Sounds good to me," Hadrian smiled.
"Interesting," Blaise said thoughtfully before getting to his feet, "Well, we-at least Theo and I-should get back to the party before someone comes looking for us. We should get everyone you've converted together sometime before school begins."
“Harry?”
"Yes," Lily scowled, "Once he realized he couldn't manipulate us Dumbledore taunted us with information about what he did to the children; about a year after our deaths he couldn't take the guilt anymore, so he removed his memories and promptly forgot about us. Tell us, Cissa; how is our daughter? Is she being treated well?"
“Did you understand what she was saying?” Hadrian asked, “I didn’t recognize the language.”
"Ah, but that was yesterday," Draco pointed out, "and today is a whole new day. Well, since you refuse to let me sleep I suppose we may as well get up." Hadrian was relieved when Draco let him go; he practically leapt from the bed before the blond could change his mind and try to pull him back down, "I will let you borrow some of my clothes until we can get you your own."
"Good," Neville replied, "Gran let me set up a greenhouse at home; it doesn't have much in it yet, but I plan to have it full by the time we graduate. She's also started to let me manage my own finances and she seems to trust me more after what happened at the ministry." He cut an uncertain look at Draco, but the blond chose to ignore the reference to the night of his father’s arrest.
"I'm not speaking to you," the boy said, "You were being a jerk." He stuck his tongue out and then turned back to Narcissa, "So when you say Draco will be possessive..."
“But-the-the Heat!” Harry sobbed, “Draco-can’t-it’s too dangerous!
The fingers come slowly; the first is gently pressed in, my body eagerly accepting it. The finger twists and prods, and it isn’t near enough. I moan, open my mouth to demand more, but my invisible lover is already there, pressing a second finger in beside the first. The two fingers pump slowly in and out, they twist, dragging against my insides, and scissor, stretching me wider for what is to come next. The third finger is added, and cruel fingers pinch in just the right way to prevent my orgasm as the fingers inside my body press rhythmically against my prostate. My hands tangle in soft hair, my hips press forward as I chase the bliss that is just out of reach, and my legs go weak as my lover’s laugh vibrates against my cock.
“Okay,” he agreed, “I’ll check on her occasionally, and if things get worse we’ll tell someone who can help-if not Tom, then Severus or even the twins.”
“Yes,” Draco smirked, giving him another kiss, “I love you, Harry James Potter; even if you do act like an idiot Gryffindor on occasion.”
“Ginny will be here with the kids,” Harry said, “So you can bring Scorpius over, if you want; then the kids can play together while we talk. Say, be here around eleven?”
Next, Harry put the heels on, and cast the time-delay charms he had researched. He really hoped they all worked properly, as he’d had to improvise a little. With a last check to make sure that the door was secured, Harry picked up the blind fold, positioned himself between the stool and the shelf with his back to the stool, and used his wand to put out the torch. He slipped the blindfold on, then carefully cast a temporary sticking hex to keep it in place. Harry very carefully put his wand on the shelf in front of him; moments later he felt a slight increase of magic in the room, and when he reached out he found a barrier between him and his wand, just as he had planned.
approached and offered the chance to become the new Santa Clause. I accepted and, after training for a year with the previous Santa, moved to the North Pole fulltime. I-”
“It was a transporting spell,” Lucius said, “We just have to figure out where Dumbledore sent him.”
"If Dumbledore was behind this, where would he take Hadrian?" Lucius looked at his son expectantly.
Malfoy waved his wand and with a whispered word a silver leash attached itself to the collar; as Harry got back to his feet he could feel magic vibrating through the leash and realized that it was telling him which way to go so-with a final narrow-eyed look at Malfoy-Harry headed for the front door of the manor, pulling on the leash until it sent a shock back at him, making him growl lowly, which caused Malfoy to laugh at him again. By the time they reached what were apparently Malfoy's rooms-up two staircases down numerous hallways and located at the back of the house-Harry was beginning to feel worn out. Really, he thought, it was to be expected-in the past forty-eight hours he had been beaten half-to-death twice, turned into a tiger, and put through a painful curse, not to mention he hadn't eaten in three days...
"That's brilliant!" Hadrian beamed, spontaneously hugging the Slytherin, whose cheeks were tinged a slight pink, "Now we just need to figure out the best time-and a way to talk to each other when we're apart."
After the Dursley’s went to bed, Harry looked at the remaining list of chores; he was to clean and dust every room on the ground floor, clean the guest bathroom, pull out the holiday dishes and wash and dry them, polish the silver, wash all the windows, and wax the kitchen floor. Harry knew he couldn’t possibly complete all this before morning, and resolved himself to a night without sleep.
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted by another blood-curdling scream and he ran back to the bed to see his nemesis writhing in pain as the wounds on his back re-appeared, ripping open and pouring blood. "Bloody fucking hell!" Draco cursed, drawing his wand, "Now what do I-?" He began muttering spells under his breath to try and stop the bleeding, but the wounds just seemed to get worse, and this time he heard as Potter’s ribs broke. Draco finally resorted to using a stasis spell, which would keep Potter alive and stop him from losing any more blood until it was cancelled-by which time Draco planned to have help.
"Hadrian dear, there are certain rules that Griphook must obey," Narcissa said gently, "There are also certain topics that are truly not meant for young wizards to hear about. We will share what information we can later, but in the meantime you and Draco should go back upstairs; you can ask Tillie to prepare a room for you to stay in if you like."
"He will pay for what he has done," Narcissa was startled to hear her own thoughts spoken out loud and raised startled eyes to the portrait beside her desk, which was no longer empty.
As he stepped out of his room, prepared to spend a few hours going over next year’s assignments with the head of each department, Santa was surprised to see a familiar brown-haired elf.
“Except you look exactly like all the other Christmas Elves,” a brisk voice interrupted Ron, and the two men turned to see the head of the wardrobe department approaching. Pansy Parkinson was eyeing Harry's clothing with distaste. “Actually, Potter, I've decided it's time to update all the uniforms. Having all the Christmas Elves dressed identically made sense for the first few years, but now it just looks tacky. Why don't you let Blaise take over out here for a while and we can start on your new clothes? As Head Elf, you should get your new uniform first.”
“Well, when you put it like that, how can I say no?” Harry bit his lip again, “I think-no, I
“That must be…my mother,” Hadrian whispered, speaking for the first time since they had started watching the scene, “I wonder who the man with her is?” Draco shook his head silently as the woman-Elena-spoke.
"I do," Hadrian replied, "I acknowledge that my true name and identity is that of Hadrian Riddle, son of Elena Pruitt and Tom Riddle. I reject the name and identity of Harry Potter as a figment created by Albus Dumbledore." There was a flash of bright light as magic took his words as truth.
"Whatever," Hadrian rolled his eyes, "You still have to tell me what I can do to pay back the life debt too; Tom said you have to come up with something soon."
“I’m not repr-fine,” Harry sighed, “I’m repressed and hearing about your dreams would scar me for life.” The brunet yawned and turned back to the bedroom again; this time Draco followed him.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and tilted his head back to accept the kiss; the first of many they would share as a bonded couple. Their friends thought they were crazy, getting bonded at twenty-one, but Harry knew he never wanted to spend his life with anyone other than Draco; this, this moment right here, was the reason he had fought so hard against Voldemort.
"Ah, I can take care of that for you," Dumbledore sounded cheerful again, "I always come prepared, just in case something like this were to occur. Give me just a moment...now where did I put those...?" All was silent for a few minutes, except for the soft rustle of Dumbledore searching for whatever it was he needed, "Ah! Here we go!" There was the sound of clinking glass, and harry recognized it from his time spent in the hospital wing: Dumbledore was giving the Dursley's vials of potion. "Now, each one of these has a different purpose, and they are charmed to never be empty. This one will block his magic from reacting to anything; make sure he gets two drops of it twice a day. I am aware that he has been training physically this year as well, so this potion will cause him to become disoriented, while this one will cause him to lose control of his muscles. This potion will prevent him from being able to tell anyone the full truth of what happens here. And, finally, this potion will heal physical evidence of any beatings you must give Harry, while still letting him feel the pain he needs; this is just in case you have to send him outside or if unexpected visitors stop by." There was a thoughtful pause, then the sound of another bottle being set down. "I realize that you will still need the boy useful even with the punishment he will be given, so this potion will heal anything that is life-threatening, and I believe we have everything covered; do you have any concerns about this?"
"Like soulmates?"
Draco nodded again.
Draco wanted to laugh. As they had established, he had the complete opposite problem. No one wanted to take him home because they only saw his infamy. They only saw his Mark. No one loved Draco Malfoy, because no one could love a Death Eater. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t one anymore.
me, Potter," he snapped, rolling away from Potter's touch.
“What are you going to do?”
“Bloody hell!” a new voice called from across the room.

The truth was, he didn't really want to leave. He didn't want to leave at all.

Harry rolled on top of him.
A few minutes later, while Weasley was in the loo and Draco had walked across the room to glance at a note on the wall about someone selling potions ingredients, a man sauntered across the pub toward Potter. Draco instantly began walking back toward the bar, Death Eaters still fresh on his mind. The man bent toward Potter’s ear, pressing a hand firmly on Potter’s opposite shoulder, and began whispering. Draco reached Potter’s side, crossed his arms, and cleared his throat loudly. The man stood upright, gave Draco a bit of a scowl, and then walked away. Potter’s cheeks were bright pink, and his knuckles went white against his glass as he shifted on his stool. The man walked straight out of the bar, letting the doors slam behind him.
Then there was a heat back in Potter’s eyes that suggested he might also be thinking about the incident in Draco’s bed, and Draco watched his eyes go a little glossy. Merlin, he was so bloody gorgeous that Draco couldn’t look away. Oh, the things he wanted to do to Potter, the delicious things he wanted to--
As Draco stumbled forward between two more tight shoulders, he saw Harry descending the steps from the Ministry's platform. The sight of him took Draco’s breath away. Because he was

“Shouldn’t you be sleeping or studying or something?”
“Lox!” Draco cast his ancient light spell toward the ceiling, and the room filled with pale white light. The light was much dimmer in the presence of dark magic, but at least it offered more light to the room than the light from the Dark Mark alone.
This was the Boy Who Lived Twice. Anything was possible. “I don’t know, Potter; let’s not make any promises.”
Harry’s wand clattered to the floor.

“Back off, Weasley, before you hurt someone,” Draco said, hauling Weasley away from Potter and pushing him back down the bar. “Merlin, you honestly call that

Or age. Most of the potion labels between Foolproof and Fuel were damaged or completely illegible, with a few exceptions. Fountain of Blood and Fountain of Mead, for example, were disturbingly pristine.
Draco took a shaky breath. The room was silent except for the trickling of the vermouth fountain in the corner. He slowly reached up, pulled the ribbon out of his hair, and smoothed his hair back into his fist. He tied the ribbon back into his hair and let his hands flop out onto the bed in front of him, just

to put James in unnecessary danger, but he felt that saving Harry's life had been worth the risk. He knew James himself agreed. Draco had always believed that saving a loved one's life was worth risk; he had the mark to prove it. But Harry had already lost far too many people in his life; he didn't want any more
“Malfoy, are you sure you’re alright?” Potter asked, taking a step into the room.  “You don’t look well.”
James flew to the other side of the pitch, visibly sulking. Draco remained where he was, determined to keep his distance. He knew exactly how James felt, and knew it was best to just let James be until he worked out his anger. Lily flew over toward James’ side of the pitch, leaving Draco and Potter to watch the other half.
Draco raised his eyebrows, feeling genuinely surprised. A Slytherin Potter-Weasel who had an advanced knowledge of Potions

"Sorry, Malfoy," Longbottom said as he released the vines with a flick of his wand. "Can't really blame me, can you?"
"Hush." Draco cast a healing spell that he had always found particularly effective after a Crucio. Draco held Harry's face between his hands and pressed his lips to Harry's forehead until they were both thrumming with healing, golden warmth.
Granger locked up the office with a swish of her wand. “Do you have the key memorized?” she asked, repeating the motion she had used to unlock the door. Draco imitated the movement of her wand with his own and the office door clicked open before he locked it again. “Good,” she said, and turned back toward the classroom, leading him into the hallway. “I’d also love to discuss your findings in Cairo,” she said, locking the classroom door. “Oh, and your paper comparing ancient potions of Transylvania? Brilliant.” She sighed, turning to face him in the hallway. “

However, Draco

“Absolutely,” Draco nodded. It had been so easy. Far easier than he had expected it to be, given that this was Granger. Given what he was asking for. Given that he wouldn’t have to sneak around as he had originally expected. All things considered, her terms were quite reasonable.

“It’s over then?” Potter asked. “You’re alright?”
Harry laughed softly and thrust forward until he was fully sheathed in Draco’s arse. Draco could barely breathe as the sensation of golden heat radiated from inside of him and through every part of him. He moaned, absently reaching out for any part of Harry he could touch.
Unfortunately, it turns out that these later chapters are requiring more editing work than I was expecting. Rather than deprive you of daily updates, I may need to split some of them in half (like this one) depending on what I can accomplish each day.

“The one time Harry did take someone home from the pub, it turned out to be a Death Eater trying to lure Harry to his death! Ha!” Weasley laughed, although Draco didn’t see how he could find it very funny.

Draco cursed under his breath as Potter fully collapsed onto the ground. There was only one real way to cast a Patronus, and it meant forcing himself to feel, really

A spasm of green light flickered near the main entrance of the ballroom and a sickly Dark Mark rose toward the ceiling. The room erupted in screams. Because the event was so heavily warded, no one could disapparate. Fearful witches and wizards began stampeding toward the numerous side doors. It was absolute chaos.
“Yes it was! I fear I've insulted her terribly. She is probably never coming back, which means that I’ve lost my only viable assistant, and seeing as everyone despises me for very credible reasons, I will no longer be able to continue my experiments. My career is absolutely ruined!” Draco said with a smile. A nice, big, warm smile. He felt bloody fantastic. Wasn’t it so pleasant to say all of these things out loud?
All thoughts of Draco's research were, at least temporarily, forgotten. “Harry Potter, you
“Yes, yes. Fine.”
When he was finally capable of rational thought again, Draco realized that he
“What?”
He touched it again.
From the moment Draco met Cornelius, he felt inexplicably angry in Cornelius’s presence. He respected the man’s knowledge of Norwegian flora, to be sure, but also thought he was a complete git. He hated the way Cornelius read his newspaper in the morning. He hated the way Cornelius would sit giggling at the kitchen table, writing gossip-rich editorials for

always try to avoid Potter’s sincerity or turn it into something cruel or laughable. Sitting alone in the mud in the rain and shivering with cold, Potter looked painfully pathetic. After a few moments, Draco stood up, walked across the pit, and sat next to Potter in the mud, folding his arms around his knees. They were both silent, trying not to shiver with cold as the rain fell around them.
Draco coughed a bitter laugh.
Ron sighed, "Yeah, so he and Harry have a bit of a...thing. As it turns out. Tap into his head if you have to, but...trust me, mate, based on what I've already been unfortunate enough to see, I

Hermione Granger. Granger, in some strange twist of fate, now employed him. He inwardly cringed at the endless insults he had once thrown her way without a second thought. She must absolutely despise him.
So he'd been right to trust his instinct the night before. Harry wasn't going to let him have what he wanted, not really. And who could blame him? Harry had hated Draco for most of his life, hadn't he? Why should things suddenly be any different? The sting of that realization, however, hurt far worse than the pain in Draco's face. He'd finally opened himself up to
“Oh! You like Draco!”
“Merry Christmas,” Harry replied.
"Nothing," Hadrian replied sweetly, "If I have to rest I might as well get it over with." He lay down, scooting all the way to the edge when Draco made himself comfortable on the other side of the bed.
"Well, I may never have caught the Snitch against you," Draco smirked, "But I would say this is one match I've won." Harry drew a breath-whether to yell or laugh he wasn't sure-and Draco leaned down, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss. Harry slid his arms up his husbands back, hands kneading the muscles, when laughter interrupted the moment. The two men parted and shared a rueful glance as their kids laughed at them.
“The kids have barely been gone a few hours,” Harry laughed, backing away from his husband, “Are you that desperate for me already?”
"I believe we can use Hadrian," Severus said, "I have been reviewing those memories myself, and I believe that when Dumbledore forced Tom to curse Hadrian it made him into a Horcrux as well; the potion I am developing will allow us to remove Tom's soul from Hadrian without causing the boy harm, but in the meantime there is a spell where you can use one Horcrux to locate others."
"How horrible," Lucius said, his tone completely sincere and nothing like what one would expect from Lucius Malfoy, "I can't imagine what it must have been like for you, to be raised among Muggles; tell me, are they truly as barbaric as Father says?"
"That won't work," he informed them, "We have to meet Narcissa for lunch at one, and then I'm sure we'll be going back to the manor. Is Hermione staying at the Burrow?"
“There's too much to do out here,” Harry countered, “If anything goes wrong Santa will blame me, no matter if I left Blaise in charge. Besides, you have my measurements; you can just send the uniform to my room. Oh, feel free to take Blaise for a fitting, though. I need to go check in with the kitchen elves; I'll talk to you later Ron. And if you have any issues, Pansy, come find me.” Harry gave them both a nod and then headed off in the direction of the kitchens.
"Damn," Harry muttered, trying to disentangle himself without waking the blond; he had no desire to get caught in that embarrassing position again-and how did he wind up snuggling with Draco anyway? He'd fallen asleep on Neville's bed in the Gryffindor common room a few times and never awoke snuggled up to the other boy, so why Draco?
"Hmm," Hadrian looked through the gift bags and settled on one with a night-time forest scene, complete with fairies and centaurs running through the trees; he placed the figurine boxes in the bag and then-with Tillie's help-arranged dark green and silver tissue paper in it as well.
"Great, so what do we do?" Draco demanded, "I really don't care to have the Boy-Who-Lived bleed to death in my bed."
"What sort of trick?" Draco inquired, and Hadrian replied hesitantly.
"I already have my birthday present," Draco murmured, kissing a trail up Hadrian's neck; he pressed a kiss to the corner of Hadrian's mouth and the other boy turned his head away.
“Ah, Severus my boy!” Dumbledore smiled as he met Severus at the Entrance Hall, “What brings you here today?” Severus had already spoken to the minister, and Scrimgeour had promised to get him a copy of the arrival and departure times for all ministry employees that day; it was likely to take a few hours to compile, so Severus had arranged to have them sent to Malfoy Manor and then apparated to Hogsmeade so that he could talk to Dumbledore.
Harry didn’t pay much attention to Narcissa and Malfoy, instead focusing on his own gifts. He had letters from Ron, Hermione, the twins and Sirius, telling him the recent news with the Order.
“Malfoy?” he whispered, then bit back a cry as a sharp pain shot through his head. Images flashed through his mind; grey eyes, soft white wings, a seductive smile and passionate kisses. With each image the pain in Harry’s head increased, until he fell into blessed darkness.
Draco steeled his nerves and crossed further into the room, stepping up to the bed. He looked down and saw a familiar face, peaceful in sleep; with his black hair brushed back to reveal his lightning bolt scar, Harry Potter looked young and innocent. Draco looked more closely at the scar, and noticed a faint silvery sheen-the mark of the Snow Queen. The mark served to protect the one she bestowed it upon, but it also worked to make him forget his outside worries.
Harry went on to tell Draco about his life growing up with the Dursley’s. He told Draco about the verbal abuse, the chores and neglect, and being bullied by Dudley and his friends. He told about the punishments he received for each bout of accidental magic he performed, even though he wasn’t even aware of doing it. With hesitation, he described his bedroom, the cupboard under the stairs, and then he described everything that happened the summer before First Year, from setting the boa free at the zoo, to Hagrid taking him to Diagon Alley. He confessed about the summer before Second Year, and being locked in his room, and how he had to put up with being insulted by Vernon’s sister the year Sirius escaped Azkaban. He told about his nightmares after Cedric died, and the Dementors, and how the verbal abuse increased once his relatives discovered Sirius had died.
"What about me?" Draco pouted, "You can't be planning to leave me here!" Hadrian couldn't possibly be suggesting Draco remain there with one of the twins!
I want you to know
use a personal slave," Draco mused, "House elves just don't know how to add those personal details that a wizard would…"
"Of course you're staying here," Draco replied before Hadrian could worry about it took much, "My bed is more than big enough for the two of us."
"That's Voldemort," Harry told the blond, not bothering to whisper as he knew they could not be heard by those in the memory, "He changed his name later on, but he was born Tom Marvolo Riddle.” Draco hummed absently, his grey eyes sweeping the great hall before responding.
Just before dawn, Harry returned to the workshop to wait for Santa’s return with everybody else. He briefly thought about going to the stables instead, so that he could be the first person Draco saw, but ultimately decided he’d rather be with everyone else. This way it would be less embarrassing if Draco didn’t respond to his new look.
Flyers in hand, Harry stepped out, locking the shop behind him, and took a moment to look up and down the alley his shop was located on. Mystic Alley was a new offshoot of Diagon Alley, and several of the store fronts were still empty. He knew that there was a new clothing store, a bakery, a Muggle novelty shop, and a few restaurants. Rolf had bought out the shop next to Nargles and Nibbles, and would eventually be opening as a clinic for injured magical creatures; Rolf wanted to wait until Harry and Luna’s shop was going before focusing on his own business.
“I’m not even going to ask,” Draco said drily, “Well, I wrote Mother a letter telling her what Pansy said. I also told her that they should have spoken to us about the ritual, before just locking us in a room together. I may have used you to make her feel guilty.”
"Like I would ever be scared of you," Hadrian replied; just at that moment he saw a glint of gold out of the corner of his eye; "Besides, you may have a new broom, but I'm still better than you-especially since I don't need glasses anymore." He didn't wait for Draco's reply, but shot forward towards the snitch, grinning as he heard Draco's cry of outrage behind him. "Told you I was better Malfoy!" Hadrian looked over his shoulder to taunt the blond and then frowned when he didn't see Draco behind him. He turned back towards the snitch and pulled up suddenly to avoid slamming into Draco, who had flown above Hadrian before dropping down in front of him; in that moment of distraction the snitch had vanished and Hadrian glared at his friend.
"My babies," Elena gasped, "Come Lily; we have to go! Cissy, Bella, Alice-hurry!" The five women ran to the door, only to have it swing open to reveal Peter Pettigrew and a man Harry and Draco recognized as Filch accompanied by the children belonging to the members of the Order of the Black Rose. When the parents tried to claim their children they were blasted back by a bright purple light; when the light vanished only the wizards on Dumbledore's side were still conscious.
"I don't blame you," George said, "I'll go get the shop owner."
“Here, Santa,” Blaise sauntered up the stairs, holding dark blue robes embroidered with silver stars, “I thought you might like new robes this year.” Harry glared at Blaise’s back; he really couldn’t stand that man!
“If you fight me, you will get a strapping you’ll never forget, understand?” Harry nodded once, and Petunia reached in to untie his gag, before pressing a vial of familiar potion against his lips. Harry swallowed it automatically, then reluctantly allowed Petunia to replace the gag. “You’re to stay in here until Vernon gets home; I have some people coming over, so don’t you dare make a sound!” Harry shook his head fearfully, and closed his eyes in relief when the door was shut; with Harry bound as he was, Petunia didn’t even bother sliding the bolt to lock him in.
“How stupid do you think I am?” Vernon demanded, “You can’t fool me, boy! I gave you the chance to cooperate, but now we’ll do it the hard way.” Harry scooted away from his uncle and got to his feet; he ran for the door, only to discover that it had locked behind him when he entered the room, and a key was needed to open it. Harry spun around, desperate to find another way out, only to have Vernon’s fist catch him in the stomach,
“Hello, Draco!” Hermione says cheerfully, “Ron and I missed you at dinner last week; he was pouting because he didn’t have anyone to play chess against.”
"Going through the ministry would be the better option," Lucius agreed, fighting back a smile at his friends petulant tone, "however I agree that the Muggles deserve to be punished; we will merely have to plan out our revenge very carefully so as to avoid attracting suspicion. As for Narcissa becoming Hadrian's guardian, I think that would be the ideal way to handle this; if Hadrian does turn out to be Draco's mate then she will have even more grounds to file for custody, as it is tradition for a Veela's mate to live with the Veela's family if their own family is unable to take care of them. We can tell Narcissa this evening, and she can go to the ministry after Draco's birthday."
“Good boy.” Harry felt heat at his back, and cried out as his hand was pulled away from his cock; when he felt another hand encircle his cock instead, Harry groaned, tilting his head back until it rested on a firm shoulder. “That’s it; cum for me pet.” The cock ring vanished, and Harry shouted as he finally reached his release, his hips moving frantically back and forth as he spilled his seed into his lovers waiting hand.
“It’s more like a traditional tea shop,” Ginny shrugged, “They serve tea and coffee and sandwiches, but everything is made by House Elves. Everything is neat and organized; he’ll probably get a lot of business-type people, maybe ministry officials. Oh! He also sells chocolate!” She reached into her robe pocket and pulled out a small silver box with a blue ribbon. “I made a trade with Parkinson-she gave me a box of their chocolate, and I gave her some of Mum’s pastries. Want to try one? Parkinson said the House Elves make these, but a wizard created the recipe and supervises them.”
“The bet, remember? You have to meet Draco tomorrow to see who won.”
"Okay, so I understand why you want your own space, and I am willing to compromise,” the blond said, “We can have your bedroom set up next to mine, with a door going between the two rooms, that way you will have a place to be alone if you need it. Also, I get to help you decorate."
Harry watched Malfoy enter his café, and then turned to his own shop. He found Mrs. Weasley and Ginny in the back, trays of pastries under warming charms filling the room.
He sank onto the bed and slid his hands down his face, trying to breathe. Eventually he would have to actually

Potter out of his bed, but he wasn’t fast enough. Potter had already cast his wandless, silent Accio and Draco’s wand was in Harry's hand. Why did Harry always have to steal his bloody wands?
What was Potter waiting for? Why wasn’t he closing the door? Why was he just staring at Draco with his stupid adorable face? Maybe he was still a little disoriented from the shift in gravity. Yes, that was probably it. “Feels a bit different, doesn’t it?”

“Anything happen?”
"Mushy git," Draco teased affectionately, gently nudging the side of Harry's head with his nose.
But if that was the case, there was still the matter of Ginny's murderer in the ballroom. He wasn’t leaving the palace without knowing that Ginny’s murderer was brought to justice and Harry's family could finally stop being hunted.
“James,” Draco said.
“Malfoy?” Another Death Eater asked--this one Draco had actually seen during the war. “I should kill you right now. Traitor.”

Harry bit his lip and smiled into his mug. “You don’t mind, do you? I only brought the one shirt. Everything else is t-shirts until I can pick up my dress robes for the day. I wasn’t thinking.” Seeing Potter standing in the early morning wearing Draco's clothes felt almost painful to witness, because a part of him wanted to witness it again, and again, and again. A part that he shoved very forcefully to the back of his thoughts.
“I don’t know. You saw it, right Professor? When I sent you that cool message when we got back to the healing ward? Uncle Ron let me do it. I guess it was...kind of like Dad’s. But wasn’t it the

“What.
“Would you like a boost? Back to your room?”
For some reason, Potter was grinning at him like Draco was a fucking bunny rabbit in a den of werewolves. “Oh, Malfoy, I’ve missed you,” Potter said teasingly, with--was Draco reading that right?--a dollop of sincerity.
Malfoy kicked the blankets further down his bed, suddenly feeling overwarm. It was a good thing, he supposed, that he had no plans to stay at Hogwarts for any longer than was necessary, and he certainly had no plans to interact with Harry Potter. He couldn’t sleep, so he might as well get dressed and try to get some work done.
James groaned. “You sound like my dad! Feeling’s the easy part! It’s the wand part I can’t get right.” Draco grabbed James’ hand and moved it in the air beneath his, mimicking the proper wand movement for a Patronus. “No, you have to flick up, right at the end, got it?”
you’ve heard of me.”
Potter’s face scrunched and his eyes flared as he looked back up at Draco. Then Potter slammed his wardrobe closed. Draco blinked into the dark for a moment. He poked his finger against the back of Potter’s wardrobe door. It didn’t budge. He pressed his ear to it, but it seemed to behave like a normal wardrobe door should. Draco retrieved his silken green robe and closed his wardrobe, then turned back into his room to see three giggling students crowding around his Fountain of Vermouth.
Well over an hour later, Draco and Harry sat together on the edge of a fountain in the palace gardens, still answering Longbottom's questions about what had happened so he could complete his Auror paperwork. Draco had been staring at the same cluster of flowered topiary for what felt like forever, but he was still stunned by the beauty of the pink and yellow blooms as the fountain trickled majestically behind them. At least endlessly staring at the same patch of flowers was preferable to staring at the repellent fashion choices made by some of the Aurors and reporters.
“We’re agreed then!” she said, grabbing Draco’s robes and pulling him down the hall before he could protest. She pushed Draco and Harry into a large, empty room with wooden floors and tall windows. The room had a slight, cool draft and a scent of old wood that pleasantly reminded Draco of the ballroom at Malfoy Manor. Lily flicked her wand toward an old gramophone against the wall and a crackling tune trickled into the room. “Waltz!” she commanded, rolling out a dusty old tapestry like a picnic blanket against the wall. Settling herself on the tapestry, she pulled out Charms homework and made a show of studying. Despite the fact that she was holding a Charms textbook, Draco could
. Whatever they were, they had been it alone. They had never revealed their relationship, whatever it was, to Harry's adoring fans. They hadn't even revealed themselves to Granger and Weasley, although Draco suspected that they had figured it out anyway. Harry hated publicity when it came to his personal life; he wasn't about to feed the endless gossipmongers in this crowd. Maybe Draco felt fully at ease in a room full of politicians, but Harry would undoubtedly feel uncomfortable. Harry was going to follow the

Potter shook his head. “I know what you’re trying to do, Draco.”
“Well, I suppose I should...” Potter stammered, adjusting his shorts beneath the pillow at his crotch.

“But thank you,” Potter said quietly, watching Draco from across the table. Then even more quietly, he added, “Draco.”
As he stared at his watch, pretending to be enraptured by the time, his thoughts drifted to Cornelius Howe, as they often did when he felt completely alone. Cornelius had been one of his colleagues during a research expedition in Norway. He and Cornelius had shared a caravan located between the research base and the forest where they were doing their research.
“I will too, Granger,” he said, surprised that he wholeheartedly meant the words. “It’s been an unexpected pleasure.”

He repeated for emphasis. “That was almost as good as when you punched him. Damn it, witch, I love you.” Weasley pulled on Granger’s sleeve.
“Yes. Bring me my research journal, won’t you?” Draco closed his eyes. He hated this. He hated that Potter was being so…
clean with soap, not with those awful cleaning spells you’ve obviously been trying and failing to cast on them--I think you would be taken far more seriously as a professional.” She paled. “Yes, I am really seeing it now. You could even have the potential for St. Mungo's! Especially if you stopped pretending you were better than everyone else all the time.” Draco nodded, smiling. “How lucky I am to have your assistance! And here I always thought you were so repellent when we were in school, partially due to your birth to Muggle parents of course, but then again I

. Then Harry lifted his hand again, running a long, dripping strand of Draco’s hair between his index and middle finger. “And this. This has been driving me mad.”
Draco smirked. Leave it to Harry Potter to invent wandless stripping spells and yet have no knowledge of more established ones. “Oh, I think you’ll find I’m full of surprises, Potter.”
“Well, neither is your father, but here we are,” Draco said. The snitch fluttered in their grip. Potter tightened his fingers around Malfoy’s.
Draco wove his fingers together and flipped his palms upward at his knee. “Step.”

Unsurprisingly, the restaurant was just as elegant as the rest of the hotel. The scent of fresh bread and grilled vegetables filled the air, and Draco's stomach growled. He'd been been so focused on trying to ignore his attraction to Potter all afternoon that he hadn't realized how hungry he was. ...Or at least he hadn't realized how hungry he was for actual
"But--"
Harry ran his fingers along the inside of Draco’s waistband and then pushed down until he brushed against Draco’s blonde curls. “Potter--” Draco lost his voice as Harry began forcefully unfastening his grey trousers, yanking them down past his knees. Harry crawled back to Draco’s ankles, threw off Draco's shoes and socks, gripped his pants and trousers and yanked on the soaking wet cloth, pulling Draco down the shower wall a little with the force of it until Draco was leaning up on his elbows and completely naked, fixedly watching Potter fling his trousers over his shoulder.

Draco felt nauseous. He leaned an ear low toward Potter’s mouth. He waited. His chest felt like it was being ripped open as he waited, fearing the worst. And then Potter inhaled. He was breathing. He was

to know.”
Draco tried not to show how impressed he was by the fact that Albus was reading a potions textbook--for fun--intended for far more advanced students. “Find anything interesting?”
“Not just yet,” Harry complained, nipping at Draco’s skin and soothing the sting by drawing his tongue in aimless circles. “This looks familiar,” Harry pointed to one of Draco's photographs. “Reminds me of us, a bit.” The photograph depicted wall art from the Tomb of Hannu. Two humanoid shapes held wands, facing each other as some sort of fog erupted between them. “This too,” Harry said, pointing to the photograph below it, where two more human figures pressed their hands together, emitting rays of light. “That’s kind of how I feel every time I touch you. Is that supposed to represent something?”

“Therefore, if you believe the potions should be out of your system within 24 hours, you are only allowed to ingest these potions--careful to consider the appropriate amounts, mind you--on the weekends, between Friday and Saturday evening, so that you have some time to recover before class on Monday. Is that clear?”
be careful. Find some Aurors if you can."
“Good," Harry nodded. "That’s good. I'm sorry, I...I should have been there. I just needed...some time. To figure some things out.”
“Yes, we all have an early morning,” Harry agreed, standing. “You three,” Harry pointed to James, Albus, and Lily. “Time for bed.” With the way Lily nodded and grinned in agreement, Draco had a strong suspicion that they would be continuing their game as soon as they returned to their hotel suite.
Draco pointed to it. “Out.”
ever talks about it, and I really want to know.”
Both of their fingers grazed the snitch at the same time, and then the snitch rolled fully into Draco’s gloved hand as Potter’s fingers entwined around the other half of it. Around Draco’s fingers. They slowed their brooms, looking at it. Looking at each other.

Draco finally managed to wedge himself between two broad wizards, and was about to shove through two witches, when he felt the floor sliding beneath his feet. He was sliding backward even though he wasn’t moving his legs.
James huffed.
“It isn’t behaving like I expected,” Granger frowned, picking up a small test vial and shaking it. “Malfoy?”
Potter’s words were all softness and honesty, and Draco felt himself shiver as Potter said his first name.
“You're just moving on to the next potion then?”

“No fair!
Lily was watching them from the side of the room, grinning ear to ear. She and Draco made eye contact, and she quickly hid behind her Charms book.
A door opened from another wall. Draco opened his mouth, but Granger beat him to it. “You!” she called. “What were you just thinking about?”
Draco blinked and turned away. Potter's age was somewhere between 13 and 15, and he was 33, and he wasn’t about to stay there and

to each other since...since the Fiendfyre, probably. Since the war. He owed Potter his life; he owed Potter everything, and yet it still felt wrapped up in a mess of bitter emotions that Draco had no desire to begin to analyze or untangle. What would he say to Potter when he saw him? What could he possibly say? He had been running since the war, and he

Then Potter closed the door with that fucking pleased-with-himself smile, leaving Draco with the torturous thought that maybe Potter hadn’t been talking about levitation spells at all.

During meals Potter had a tendency to shove food around his plate while looking as pathetic as possible. He still spent a lot of time with his children, and Draco caught him smiling during Quidditch lessons a few times, but it was rarely that stupid, mouth-open Potter grin of joy. If they had to interact at all, Potter was very good about avoiding Draco’s eyes and keeping his tone as unaffected as if he were talking to a brick wall. He kept quiet during any interaction they had, and never so much as looked toward Draco when he entered the Great Hall.

"Your ego doesn't need the encouragement.”

“Ready, Professor Potter,” Draco said, unable to keep the amused smile from his face.
Draco turned his desk back into an oversized green armchair and took one last look around his living quarters. He would miss it, he realized, even though he didn’t usually miss places. He would miss that mountain of silk pillows and all of that posh, green space. He would miss his fountain of vermouth, which was somehow still going strong after all of these months. At the rate it was going, Draco could easily see it running for
“It’s not the Fountain of Youth,” she sighed.
Potter’s eyes widened and he blinked rapidly, as if regaining focus and seeing Draco for the first time. Potter lifted the tips of his fingers to his own lips. Draco could imagine what Potter felt, because Draco could feel it too: the lingering heat tingling at the corner of his mouth, as if he had just picked up the perfect wand in Ollivander's shop. The kiss, brief as it had been, was resonating with him in a way that only a perfect wand could, sending a magical warmth through his body and shooting invisible sparks throughout the room. Maybe that golden feeling last night
If you hadn’t given up
“Does Draco know what you want me to do in return for your help?” Harry asked, recalling that Narcissa had basically asked Harry to be Malfoy’s friend.
Harry stood in front of the fireplace, smiling wistfully up at the portrait above it. The portrait had been painted last year, a Christmas gift from Lucius and Narcissa. In the portrait, Harry and Draco were standing behind a black loveseat. Harry was wearing emerald green dress robes, and Draco was wearing grey dress robes. Sitting on the loveseat, were their four children. Their oldest, auburn-haired and grey-eyed Orion James, age fourteen, sat on the right side of the love seat, in front of Draco. Their youngest, and only girl, ten-year-old Aurelia Phoenix, had blonde hair and emerald eyes, and was sitting in front of Harry on the left side of the loveseat. In between them, were the twins, Scorpius Evan sitting next to Orion, and Albus Hyperion sitting next to Aurelia. The twins were fraternal, but had inherited the Metamorphmagus ability from Narcissa’s side of the family, and preferred to look identical. For this portrait, however, the twelve-year olds had been convinced to keep their natural form for the portrait. Scorpius was the spitting image of Draco, and Albus looked just like Harry at that age-except for the eyes; both twins had ice blue eyes, likely from their Malfoy heritage. Today was September first, and Harry’s smile was bittersweet as he thought about the fact that his youngest had finally started Hogwarts; he was happy for Aurelia, but also sad as he realized that his children were quickly growing up.
“Harry; sorry, Hadrian, you-do you like Luna?” Hadrian glanced at his friend in surprise, and saw that Neville looked nervous about his answer.”
Harry didn’t finish the garden until after two, so Petunia refused him lunch. Once he finally finished, she sent him upstairs to clean Dudley’s bedroom, and then he washed the windows, finishing them just before Vernon got home. Vernon then instructed Harry to wash the car, while the rest of the family relaxed inside.
"We should have some sort of oath," Fred suggested, "a binding Wizard's Promise not to betray the organization, and maybe a tongue-tying hex for anyone who doesn't want to join."
"If you intend to be gone all day then I shall accompany you," Severus volunteered, "We cannot be too careful, now that Dumbledore knows Hadrian is with you."
"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one of your babies was a girl?" Narcissa smiled, "Then we could get her to marry Draco-"
“Just a moment,” Malfoy frowned, “What do you mean Potter is getting tormented by the professors? I hardly think you can consider detention to be a torment.”
“Nope, even better,” Sirius’ grin turned mischievous; “Follow me.” He led the two boys to the Muggle side of King’s Cross, and then down a side alley, where a motorcycle was leaning against the wall. “I enlarged the side car, so we can shrink your trunks, and then you two can sit there. I’d let one of you sit on the seat behind me, but Narcissa forbid it, so…”
"We'll have to think about it," George said, "She deserves the truth, but it's going to be difficult for her." Fred nodded his agreement.
"What is that?" Harry asked warily, and Dobby grinned.
"I don't know that," Draco replied, tightening an arm around Hadrian's waist, "You can either sit with me, or we can leave."
"I will send a house elf to wake you boys in the morning," Narcissa added, "Good night, boys." Hadrian and Draco bid the adults good night, and then returned to Draco's room so that they could work on the translation.
“Yes,” he agrees, “It was a potion I developed myself. There is no antidote yet, so you have to just wait until it wears off. Next time, I want you to take the potion while I fuck you.”
“You must be exhausted,” Harry murmured, using his hand in Draco’s hair to pull the blond back up, “How many times did you go back?”
"D-don't," Hadrian said, pulling away until he was out of the circle of Draco’s arms and he could turn to face the blonde, "Look, I know we agreed to start over, but that doesn't mean I want you to be…flirting with me or whatever; I'm not even gay." Hadrian firmly pushed aside the voice that reminded him of his single attempt at dating-that date with Cho had been a disaster!
“Kids are weird,” Draco agreed, “So, love, what are we doing tomorrow?”
Then again, was he even sure he liked Draco? That trick Neville had pulled on him didn't really prove anything, did it? Just because he found Draco attractive and fun to be around did not mean he actually
“What will happen when-if-Elena gets her memories back?” he asked, “I mean, she’s still married to Tom, but she’s also married to Brandon. Not to mention, what would happen to the kids?”
“Well, you might not have too much time if that kiss is anything to go by,” Neville was looking at something behind Hadrian, and the raven-haired boy felt his heart sink as he quickly looked over his shoulder-only to see Draco and Luna playing chess. Draco caught him looking and arched his eyebrow in question, but Hadrian just shook his head before turning back around to glare at a smirking Neville.
"Well, house elves have to be sworn to the head of the family," Draco replied, "because they own the house; the head of the family can then assign house elves to someone else in the family."
"I think I can work with that," Tom smirked.
"Begging Master's pardon," Wispy squeaked as she bowed, "Master Severus told Wispy to be bringing these to Master Lucius. Master Severus is having to go speak to Dumbledore, and Master Severus also said he sent letter to goblins."
“Dearest Hadrian,
With a soft sigh Narcissa turned her attention to one of the bookcases, and a quick summoning spell brought down a small box wrapped in protective spells. The box was made of ebony and rowan fused together by magic and set with carnelian and tiger's eyes-stones known to have protective properties. Narcissa stroked the lid gently with her fingertips and felt the soft hum of protective magic; it wouldn't hurt her, of course, as she was the one who had woven the spells. After simply looking at the box for several moments Narcissa cancelled the protections on it and slowly lifted the lid.
"Take me to the Muggle house that you saved Hadrian from," Draco commanded, "I need to find him."
Draco smiled at the memory, and then sighed as he got out of the bed; wouldn’t do to be caught staring at Harry again. Draco changed out of his pajamas, and started for the sitting room when he noticed a piece of paper on the floor; he picked it up and frowned when he realized it was Muggle paper-it was probably Harry’s. Casting a furtive look at the brunet still soundly sleeping, Draco carefully unfolded the paper and read the short note.
I have never been more relieved than I was when Arden showed me his memory of finding you. I am happy to know that you are safe and mostly uninjured, although it pains me that I am unable to rescue you. This is three times now that I have failed you-first when I allowed Weasley to harm you, then letting you get abducted and now being unable to bring you home. I would understand if you decided that I am unworthy of being your Mate; I know your father already feels that way, and I can’t exactly disagree. I can promise, however, that I will not stop searching for a way to rescue you, and I will make certain that those involved in your abduction suffer greatly for their actions.
My invisible lover guides me onto the bed, and I soon find my arms bound to the headboard with strands of garland; green and silver are wrapped around my left wrist, while my right is bound with red and gold. I feel him join me on the bed, spreading my legs wide so he can slide in between them. It is strange to feel the pressure of his body, without being able to see him, but I find myself even more aroused. He could do anything to me-anything at all-and I would have no warning. Hands smooth up my chest, gently brushing against my nipples before sinking into my hair and yanking my head up for a kiss. The kiss is passionate and all-consuming; his tongue is everywhere, laying claim to my mouth. He pulls back slightly, only to bite down on my lower lip, soothing the sharp sting with his tongue once more. I arch up, and we both groan as he lowers his pelvis at the same time, slowly grinding our erections together until I am fully hard once more.
If you feel that things are moving too fast and you need your memories back more quickly, you can view the pensieve memories from the last year of the Potter's lives, but I would recommend relying on the notes if at all possible. Receiving the information a little at a time will make it easier for you to understand the choices I had to make, and it will also give you time to properly plan your strategy. Best of luck to you!
“Not too soon,” Hadrian looked alarmed, “I don’t plan on getting married until at least after we finish school.” Draco looked like he wanted to argue, but simply shook his head.
“Of course, Mother,” Draco replied, setting his book aside, “Aspen makes certain that I never run out of cocoa, and the fire is more than warm enough. Did you have a good night?”
"I took it from my uncles study before I ran away," Hadrian replied with a shrug, "I don't know what's in it, but I'm guessing it's mine-either that or it belonged to James and Lily. I-I'm not sure if I want to deal with whatever is inside it tonight; maybe I should wait until tomorrow to look through it."
“Of course, Albus,” McGonagall nodded her head, then hesitated for a moment before accepting the proffered potions, “Albus…this…this truly is for the Greater Good? There is a larger purpose behind everything we do this night?”
A few minutes later found Harry in his old bedroom kneeling in front of his trunk. It had only taken him seconds to open it-the key had been hidden under a loose floorboard-and he was about to start looking for his invisibility cloak, when something caught his eye. It was a pair of mismatched socks, one sock red with flying golden snitches and the other gold with red brooms; the socks had been a gift from Dobby, and Harry nearly slapped himself for not thinking about the little elf sooner.
