"Will the children stay with Molly?" I ask him, as I open the door to our room, letting Draco go first.
“They started half an hour ago, but it's not open to the public,” he tells me and gives me a smile. "I don't think they will take much longer. There are a few prodigies playing in there."
“Dray!” I call again, peering inside the place. It’s immaculate as ever. “Hey,” I say knocking softly on the wall. A bad habit, really.
And I don’t pay any mind to the jealousy I felt back there. I start to rub Draco’s arms with both my hands, trying to apply enough pressure to create a warm feeling on his arms.
“That,” she winks at him. “I am.” And then, a stream of purple light hit him straight in the neck, making him bleed.
I nod, trying to ease my own mind. This is important. This is important to ensure Dray’s survival. I need him alive. I need to remember this.
I nod, remembering that we are free from the Dark Lord. The ever-chivalrous Harry Potter defeat him in a burst of magic and something I cannot still name for my life. I smile, remembering how sad I was while my lovely cousin was on our basement, being threaten and slapped by Bellatrix.
His magic is angry, I can feel it, even if this memory is not mind: the fear, the paralysis that comes with it, the quacking of the beats of the hearts, the rush of blood to the head…
That made the trick and the memory appears in front of me. At least I just can see snips, like this person wasn’t really seeing. And then, there’s my love. Standing in front of this crazy witch with his eyes shinning like a kaleidoscope.
"Rosse Cottage," Blaise whispers and I see him turn pale. "Why would Neekeal send us to that place?"
"You look silly," says James, as he looks at me. Draco and I looked at each other, and I watch him remove a bit of the icing Scorpius put on his cheek and slide his finger across James's nose. "Daddy!" James sulks and looks at me.
"Tomorrow, Mr. Potter, when the whole world sees what you did to your hair to celebrate your thirty-second birthday, you'll remember this, Harry," Draco whispers against my ear and I know I'm screwed. "You will remember screwing your husband, slowly and good."
“Iris,” I say to her, extending the list to her. “I am in need of finding a blossom of a white valerian. Do you happen to know which one would be best suited for the likings of my master?”
And just as the words come out of my mouth, I put my hand in the cloth sack Neekeal gave me this morning. I feel a paper stick to my hand and I immediately take it out, a small paper flower is in the palm of my hand and it opens, revealing a name written in black ink.
“Please ask your partner for their help. We fail to understand the world of Muggles, especially those who have never had contact with them,” Kingsley says and his eyes dart across the room. "Auror Thomas, any help that your wife could give us would also be very appreciated, after all she is also a witch born to Muggle parents."
"Why a mind healer?" I ask her, trying to understand. "Draco remembers me and remembers the children."
"I had a soul mate once too, Harry Potter," she tells me softly, but her eyes are sad. "And that didn't stop him from leaving or cutting off my boy's ears," she tells me in a whisper laden with pain. "Or shutting me with a curse."
I run my hands over my face and remember that I haven't changed my clothes and I haven't had breakfast either. However, I wish I could wait for Dray to start this meeting, but the blond is the last who should know about my involvement in this crappy war.
“Is there some reason we are in the dark?” Severus asked, and without waiting for a response, flicked his wands at the lamps scattered around the room, immediately engulfing the room in light.
He pushed himself off the door and walked into the bathroom, discarding his clothes as he walked. He bent over to turn the taps on, and soon enough, there was steam billowing up and over the glass door. He stepped in, relishing the hot water that poured over him.
“It’s just… I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I’m surprised that I fell asleep outside, exposed as I was. I was just wondering if, maybe, you wouldn’t mind staying here for a bit? Just until I fall asleep again. If it’s no trouble, of course.” He said quickly.
They were headed to Harry’s bedroom, but stopped by Narcissa’s room to relay that they would be down for dinner and needed to speak to her after, if it was convenient for her.
ANYWAYYYYYS, I hope, as always, that you enjoy this chapter. Leave your thoughts in the comments below :)
“It sucks, because, after my original talk with Remus this afternoon, I felt a little better about things, but now I’m back to depressed again. I just feel like I keep losing people, and it’s stupid, because I lost my parents ages ago, and I shouldn’t be sad about it now, but it still hurts. And then all that bullshit happened at the Ministry…And fuck, I’m just so angry. Sometimes it’s like I can barely contain this rage that’s simmering just beneath my skin and I’m afraid that it’s going to turn me into a monster and end up driving everyone away.”
They sat for a moment, no sounds other than the occasional sip from her, or the clink of a spoon as Harry stirred his tea.
Remus tore his gaze off the boy and gave Severus a withering look that caused the man to smirk, before turning back to Harry.
“She wanted to say thanks… for me being there… and she told me about a bit of your family history.” Harry said, not looking at Draco.
Harry was shocked, to say the least. He figured he was in for rounds of questioning, but Remus apparently didn’t need to ask. He was willing to take Harry at face value, even if it was obvious from the state of things that Harry wasn’t exaggerating, it still meant something that he didn’t press him.
When he was sure he had his memory and emotions under control, he stepped out of the spray of water. Reaching for the bottle of soap sitting on the ledge, he poured some into his hand and started scrubbing his body, beginning with his hair, slowly making his way down until he reached his feet. When he was satisfactorily clean, he stepped under the water again and finished his shower. He dried off quickly, hardly bothering to dry his messy hair, and pulled his clothes on. Confident that he was presentable now, he left the bathroom and exited the closet, intent on exploring the rest of the manor.  He took a moment to stop by the 2 chairs placed by the window and saw for the first time the full glory of the grounds.
“I don’t think Draco ever truly approved in what was going on, not until Lucius found Severus. Neither myself nor Draco had ever seen Lucius so happy in life. It was like he had gotten a second chance to be happy, something he thought himself undeserving of after the first war. It was hard not to approve of their relationship, not when it was doing so much good. Lucius was even making great strides in trying to get us out from under the Dark Lord, something I never imagined would happen.
“Meemy met me at the gate, and helped me inside. From there… well, obviously I needed help. I knew that any of the people I would normally call upon would force me into St. Mungo’s and then most likely back to the Dursley’s, but then I remembered what my mother said in her letter. She said I could come to you for help, that I could trust you.  So, I sent Meemy for you.”
Harry flashed a quick smile at everyone before he picked up the first gift. The wrapping paper had tiny golden snitches on it that evaded his fingers when he tried to touch them. Draco leaned over and whispered, “From me.”
“Your father’s? Yes. And he had very good taste. I had to borrow a shirt from your closet and take it to the bloke who sells this stuff to make sure it was the right one.” Draco replied.
Harry nodded his head and called out to the group of adults who had moved away and formed a small circle.
He swung his legs over and out of bed and shuffled to the door, his mind still half asleep when he got there and opened it to stick his head out.
suffered just as much as she did. More so, from the memories I’ve been witness to. Well, the secret is out, Petunia, and I fully intend on making you suffer for what you’ve done to Harry Potter. Would you like a taste or would you prefer to wait for your oaf of a husband to get home?” Severus finished quietly.
And with that, they spent the next three hours planning. They would start at Gringotts, allowing ample time for Harry to check his vaults (Remus gave him a strange look when he said he wanted to go) before heading to the various shops needed to gather their school things, a quick stop at Quality Quidditch Supplies so Draco could look at purchasing another broom, and then finally Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Both boys had grown over the summer, Harry especially so, so they would definitely need new school robes and casual wear. It was a solid plan, and with any luck, they would be in and out before lunch, and well before anyone noticed they were there.
The training was exhausting, but Harry was already seeing the results of their hard work. He was able to duel with Severus longer and nonverbal casting was becoming second nature to him. He figured that by his birthday, he would be ready for the next step in whatever Severus had planned,
Harry must have fell into a light sleep, because the next thing he knew, Stan was hovering over him, gently shaking him.
Narcissa had been coming and going, spending most of her time with Andromeda and Ted. It seemed to be doing her a lot of good, as the time that Harry spent with her, usually at dinner, she seemed much happier than when Draco and herself had arrived.
Harry soon found out what his professors definition of “just breaking a sweat” meant. He was panting heavily and had the beginnings of a stitch forming in his side after only fifteen minutes of keeping up with the older man. Severus either didn’t notice or didn’t care, because he kept the pace up; in fact, he went even faster, increasing the tempo to a level Harry had trouble keeping up with.
Harry snapped his head up, locking eyes with Snape once again. Did he want him to see it? Did he want anyone to see it? No. He would taunt him with the knowledge, perhaps even tell someone else. No, he didn’t want anyone to ever see this. With his answer firmly in his head he answered Snape.
Harry gave a great yawn that was cut short by Meemy grabbing his hand and pulling him into the house. Harry tried to protest that he had left his trunk, but when he turned to look, he noticed it was gone.
He took his time walking around the lake, eventually shedding his trainers and socks so he could dip his feet in the water. He ended up sitting down on the bank, occasionally throwing a stone into the water and watching the fish that jumped every now and then. When he felt that he was relaxed enough, he closed his eyes and started breathing deep and slow. He slowed his thoughts down and when he had total control over them, he tried to visualize the cracks in the shield around his mind.
Harry nodded and left the room, quickly making his way to his parent’s old room. He stripped his jeans and shirt after making sure that he didn’t have another visitor waiting for him and threw them to the corner of the room; they vanished as soon as they hit the floor. Harry gave a brief smile – Merlin he loved magic. He walked towards the dressing room and looked around for a moment before finding a pair of jet black pyjamas. He pulled them on, noticing that they were a bit too big for him; definitely his father’s, then.
Draco squeezed his hand and Harry looked at him. He had a small, reassuring smile and Harry appreciated his support.
“Yes, I should think that would suffice, as long as you can hold it in place. Concentrate for now, we’re going to continue.” Snape said, before casting again and again, trying over and over to find a weak point in Harry’s defense; he kept this up until Harry was panting from exertion, and parts of his thoughts were starting to leak through. Finally, Professor Snape seemed satisfied and relented.
“The last time, I was not expecting you to be able to peer into my mind. I assure you that you will see only what I want you to see this time. Now, on my count. Three, two, one…” Professor Snape said.
It took only a couple seconds for him to feel the wards and they made him gasp in shock. In his mind he could see the wards, for the first time since he had arrived. They were like a giant, domed glass that covered the entire property. He stumbled forward and let his hand hover right above where they started. He could
Harry sighed. “I think I need to tell you something. Something I’ve been avoiding telling you because I’m afraid things might change.”
Still, Draco was getting lower and lower, going ever so slowly, until he made it to the thick bush of pubes around Harry’s hardened cock. He stopped for a moment and looked up at Harry who had been watching him almost the entire time.
Harry awoke some hours later; light shining wonderfully through the windows on the left side of the room. Harry slowly sat up and noticed that Meemy had obviously come back in the room at some hour of the night and covered him up, moving the picture back to its place on the nightstand beside him. Harry sat up, stretching his arms high above his head, feeling more rested than he had since the incident at the ministry. As he stretched, he took a moment to see how the room had been setup.
Harry gasped as all the light from the house suddenly swarmed and engulfed him. He shut his eyes, trying to escape the blinding, bright light. All of his muscles were tensed - somewhere deep inside him, he could feel the spell taking root. It felt like it was being latched onto his very being, his arms, his legs, his mind, and then suddenly, it stopped.
“Harry, you can go faster. Much, much faster.” Draco said breathlessly. “I want you to fuck me now. I’m beyond ready.”
!” Severus snapped and reached forward to pull Draco’s head up. He was successful and waited until the boy had focused on him before he spoke again.
“Yes, Master Harry. We are siblings. Meemy is being the oldest, followed by Dizzy and Nipsy. We took care of your parents. You remind Meemy so much of Misses Lily.” Meemy said a little sadly.
Draco didn’t need any more invitation and carefully made his way in, closing the door behind him and meeting Harry under the deliciously warm water that was raining down.
“Keep eyeing him Harry, and I’m going to think you were serious about having a thing for older men.” He said.
He turned from the door and slowly descended the stairs, thinking of how differently that had gone than he expected it to. Harry had surprised him, and in truth, he had surprised himself. He did not often apologize, especially to students, but this seemed like one of those great exceptions. It was obvious that Harry needed guidance, and Severus was sure that he would be able to help him, so long as they were able to put their differences aside.
This, apparently, was the last that Petunia could take, and she proceeded to faint on the spot. Severus said nothing more and brushed his robes off as he left the kitchen. He peeked his head into the cupboard under the stairs, something he had learned used to be Harry’s bedroom from Vernon’s memories, and sneered in disgust. Slamming the door when he was done, Severus made his way for the front door, only to be stopped by Vernon’s scream that tore through the air. He hesitated, but with one more smile of vindictive satisfaction, Severus apparated from Privet Drive.
It started the same as usual, with Severus coming to Harry’s door and knocking. However, before Harry could respond, the door opened and Severus walked in. He moved the chairs by the window, sitting down when he arrived.
“I can’t promise anything, but if you think it’ll help, I wouldn’t mind giving it a try.” Harry said.
Dumbledore, for his part, managed to look thoroughly appalled and disgusted. He looked Harry in the eyes, and Harry understood why people feared him. His eyes were absolutely dangerous.
“I’ve already sent it to your room, Master Harry.” Meemy said, knowingly interpreting what Harry had been about to say.
He made his way back to the house and stopped by the kitchen to grab some water and a banana before he went upstairs. He opened the door to his room and found Draco in the same position that Harry left him in. He smiled warmly around the banana.
Harry had a wide smile on his face ad he said, “You really didn’t have to get me anything. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble.
“I’m truly glad to meet you two, as well. I am actually quite happy to be here.” Harry said, small smile breaking across his face. Harry was slightly perturbed, however. They all looked strikingly similar.
They had stayed up late last night, listening as Dumbledore, Severus, and Narcissa talked about past events. They hadn’t really stuck to one topic, moving from their time at Hogwarts to their times abroad. Harry had enjoyed himself, but when one yawn had turned into two and then three, they decided to call it a night.
“I didn’t mean to startle you, Mr. Potter. I simply wanted to ask if you’d join me for a cup of tea.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
Harry had only so much as let the errant thought of his wand being in his hand cross his mind and, quite magically, he was holding his wand.
“Please, go back to whatever you were doing. I will only need Meemy for a moment longer.” Harry said.
Harry had heard, and seen, enough. He walked quickly away from the room and stumbled his way up the stairs, not stopping until he had reached Draco’s room where he collapsed in a chair beside the bed.
By the time he was finished reading, Harry had tears streaming down his face. He quickly read through the letter, once, twice, three times. He couldn’t believe it. His mother’s hand writing was… beautiful. And, though he was pretty sure he was imagining it, he could swear it smelled of a sweet perfume. Harry read the letter once again, this time not really taking in the words, just looking at his mother’s writing. He had to have been dreaming; a quick and angry pinch on his leg, which was sure to bruise, proved otherwise. Harry laid his head back against the wall, closed his eyes, and took a deep, shuddering breath.
When he was sure the spell had worked, he gently picked Harry up and carried him with experienced navigation throughout the manor, quickly but carefully, making his way to the third floor. When they reached the top of the stairs to the door that Harry had found weeks ago, Severus placed Harry’s bloody hand against the door, which unlocked with a loud *
The first thing Harry saw was straight across the room. It was a large 4 poster bed with a beautiful white canopy, beside which stood two nightstands that Harry walked over to inspect. He went to the nightstand on the right, which upon closer examination, Harry noticed had a picture of him and his mother on it, where he couldn’t have been more than a couple months old. Harry picked the picture up and sank down on the bed, noticing as he did that Meemy was quietly leaving.
“Listen, Harry. There isn’t anyone who blames you for reacting how you did that day. You thought that someone you loved was in trouble, and you took action to save that person. One of the bravest and most honourable things you can ever do is march headfirst into a bad situation, not knowing if you’re going to walk back out again, especially on behalf of someone else. Sirius knew going into that fight that he might not walk out, but he did it. He did it for you, just like you did for him. Do not be sorry for trying to save him, Harry.
A bolt of red light shot from the tip of his wand and a second later, Harry was forced to dive for cover as bits of rock showered and rained down around him. He didn’t move, even after the pieces of rock stopped falling, until he heard someone clapping softly from the steps of the house. He lifted his head and saw Severus standing there with a slightly amused expression on his face. He took a look back and was shocked to see that the boulder no longer existed. The only remnants were bits of scattered rock and an indent on the lawn where it had sat.
With a groan, Harry did nothing except open his mouth, and Severus gingerly poured some of the potion into his awaiting mouth, waiting for the inevitable choking that he was sure would come. When nothing happened, Severus poured more and more until the bottle was empty. He wasn’t entirely sure that Harry was truly conscious, but as long as he drank the potion, he didn’t care. He would find out what happened later, and by Merlin, would there be hell to pay.
The next two weeks continued at about the same pace for Harry. When he wasn’t having the reoccurring nightmare featuring the deaths and injuries to the people closest to him, he was locked in his room and practically forgotten about until mealtimes, when he would get random bits of food and water pressed into his room via cat flap. It was on such a day, when Harry was getting one of his “meals,” that a manila envelope followed the food.
“You’re no longer that skittish, malnourished boy from the fifth year. You’ve grown into this incredible person that is kind, and passionate, and powerful, and we all love you so much. I love you so much. Just remember that, and remember to keep being productive with that anger. Harness it and make it work for you. Everything else will fall into place.”
Harry looked him in the eyes. He could see the smoldering rage in them and knew without a doubt that he was serious.
Severus scanned the area around him before his eyes settled on a rock. With a wave of his wand, the rock grew to a massive, man-sized boulder.
“Sorry to run off, but I need to have a shower and get ready for my training.” Harry said while standing up.
He thought he would feel dirty, ashamed maybe, at bottoming, but after that… He knew where he wanted to be. And at the look of total peace on Harry’s face, something Draco loved to see more than anything else, he knew that Harry had found his place, too.
He ended his shower after making sure that he had removed all traces of the day’s events. As he stepped out of the stall and reached for a towel, he was surprised to find that his soiled clothes had disappeared some time during his bathing. With an appreciative smile on his face, he wrapped the towel around his waist after quickly blotting it through his hair and exited the bathroom.
Harry turned back toward the remaining present. It was a small one from Dumbledore and wrapped in in dark blue paper with tiny little stars on it. He ripped open the paper slowly and was left with a box. He pried it open and inside it was a small jewelry box, not unlike the ones Harry had seen muggles use when proposing in movies. Harry cracked the lid open and was presented with a beautiful ring. It had a large ruby in the center with smaller gems of every color inlaid around it. There was a coat of arms molded into each side of the band, and the band itself was black, or maybe a blue so dark it looked black.
Harry sighed after a moment and pulled back far enough to still keep Draco in his arms, but be able to talk to him face to face.
“You know, I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times from your mother by now, but if you want to talk, or rage, or swear, or anything, you can come to me. I’ve been there before. I’m actually still kind of there, honestly.” Harry said, looking over to Draco and meeting the gaze that was now directed at him.
Had Draco really just kissed him? Merlin, it was more than a kiss, they had shared a mutual wank. If you had asked Harry that morning, Draco was still very much outside of the equation. Now, however, Harry hoped that he would be a part of his future; a very big part.
“I understand. We must go then, to a place where we can safely wait until Dumbledore is able to meet with you. I know just the place, if the owner is willing to harbor fugitives of the Dark Lord.” Severus said, grinning by the time he was finished.
“Don’t get me wrong, Potter, I’m proud of my blood and my heritage, but I’ve met some pretty thick pure-bloods. And all one has to do is review some of the accomplishments of muggleborns to know that they deserve a place in wizarding society. I think my father finally realized that at the end, and that’s why he was trying so hard to get away from the Dark Lord. That’s what I choose to believe anyway.”
“My uncle tried to rape me. He spouted some crap about me failing to respect him, and now that Sirius was dead, he was going to show me what would happen if I continued to disrespect him. He had my pants off before I managed to incapacitate him and decided to leave. You see, my aunt had given me a letter from my mother earlier that day that listed this as one of the properties that I owned, so I came here. I didn’t expect to find the house or the house-elves still here. I made it my new home.” Harry finished.
Severus stopped shortly after getting through door, actually leaning back against it once it had resolidified. He was breathing heavily and almost cursed Lucius when he spoke from the desk at which he was working.
They took a seat next to each other near Narcissa and answered the customary “how did you sleep” questions. Meemy, followed by Nipsy, arrived shortly after they were finished talking, bringing with them a full English. Harry’s mouth was watering as the smell of the food hit him and judging from the hungry expressions, so was everyone else. They dug in and chat was limited save for occasionally commenting on how good the food was.
Harry was staring into Draco’s eyes, willing himself not to cry, but there was something else he needed to get off his chest. Something he had been worried sick about, but had pushed it down instead of dealing with it because it hurt. But, Draco said he could talk to him, so….
Harry felt light, happy, and carefree as the day rolled on. He was pretty sure that he had never had so much fun before, even during his stays at Hogwarts. He felt loved for the first time since Sirius and Ron fell at the ministry, and he couldn’t keep the smile off his face. It was weird because, for whatever reason, he felt that the ring on his finger was contributing to some of that happiness, but he didn’t care to dwell on the reason why.
Harry spun around to see three figures in dark robes walk passed the window closest to him. He hesitated only for a moment before pulling his wand out, and was about to cast a spell at the door when he remembered the little old lady, the one who was now intently looking at him.
“I told you I would be back, did I not? Do you think me a liar?” Severus asked, looking down his nose at the creature.
“No kidding, Harry. Do you have any idea how crazy you were driving me with those moans? I couldn’t resist pulling myself off while listening to you. We’re
It was acre after acre of gorgeous, sloping, green land. It appeared that just a few hundred yards from the house was a beautiful lake, being slow fed by a stream, with great, giant trees planted all around it. There were smaller buildings placed all around the property, and he was dying to know what everything was.
After lightly padding into the restroom to relieve himself, he bent over his trunk and pulled out a set of everyday work robes and pulled them on, intent on going downstairs for breakfast. Severus grabbed his wand off the bedside table and left his room, trying to make as little sound as possible in case Harry was still sleeping. However, as he started making his way down the stairs, his left forearm burned so badly that he actually looked down expecting to see a fire.
Harry laughed and reached around him for the soap, pouring some into both their hands before setting the bottle down by their feet and beginning to lather his hands up. Draco did the same and then reached forward and started soaping Harry’s chest up while Harry started on his arms, a smile planted firmly on his face.
Was Lucius one of the ones in that room? Severus couldn’t be sure, but he was rather hoping not. Lucius had proven himself a great ally and even greater lover since the Dark Lord had returned last year, and he needed his help if he was going to get out of the manor alive. He went straight to the private study where Lucius could often be found, using another spell when he arrived that turned the door into something akin to smoke. As he swept through the barrier, it returned to its solid form.
Vernon fell to the ground under the affects of the curse and this time, Severus held the spell, ignoring the cries from Petunia to stop hurting him, ignoring the fact that Vernon’s eyes were bulging, looking almost ready to explode, and ignoring the fact that as unhealthy as the man was, this would likely cause his heart to fail. Severus cared about none of that, and was intent on making Vernon feel as horrible as Harry had on the night he dared lay his disgusting hands on him.
“Of course Professor Snape, right this way. Please be following Meemy!” Meemy said, taking off down a short hallway.
He watched as Draco started to move. Watched as he stretched his arms out in front of him and flexed his fingers. The blonde gave a giant yawn as he woke up and felt around the bed, before huffing out a small sigh.
Chapter 8!!! Wow, that was fast. I literally had nothing to do today, which is super rare, and I was able to spend a good chunk of my day writing this. I swear, I changed things over and over again, so I hope everyone enjoys this. I think Severus is a liiiittle OOC, but hopefully it flows. Please leave feedback in the comments!
Harry looked down at himself and noticed that he was indeed covered in a fine layer of dust. He looked back up at Draco and smiled before he pulled him into his lap. Draco let out a sound of surprise that Harry quickly stifled with a kiss.
think it was a good idea to put that bloody ring on? I can feel the dark magic radiating off of it and it’s five feet away.” Severus said, stout anger noticeable in his voice.
Harry couldn’t tell if it was stone, or metal, or what, but the box was surprisingly heavy and for some reason, Harry yearned to put the ring on. It was almost like he was in a trance, and he jumped slightly when Dumbledore spoke. He found it hard to drag his eyes away from the ring to look at the man.
idea how close you came to dying? Has that brain of yours ever served a purpose other than to get you in trouble? You will explain to me
“Good. There are a couple of other things I’d like to speak to you about, while I’ve got you here. The first is your spell training.” Professor Snape said. “Though he tries, Dumbledore has yet to find a suitable teacher for the Defense Against Dark Arts position, and you’re seriously lacking in education for it. If you’re willing, I’d like to train you myself. And not just DADA, but real attack and defense spells.” Snape said.
They were out of time; Severus knew that that Dark Lord would discover their location in the manor shortly. But he couldn’t move, couldn’t accept the fact that Lucius had fallen. His eyes flicked from Lucius’ dead body to Alecto’s and almost laughed at how different the two scenes were. Whereas Lucius was being held in a sobbing Draco’s arms, Alecto was dead in a pool of her own blood, loved by no one, cared for by no one.
“Potter, I… would you maybe… never mind. Thank you for bringing me up here.” Draco said with a sigh.
“What do you- What did I do wrong?” Harry said, hoping his voice wasn’t trembling like the rest of him was.
“Hey.” Draco said, running a finger up and down Harry’s stomach while the other boy leaned against the glass, apparently still recovering. “Are you okay?”
Harry was paralyzed. His brain seemed to stop working, and he could do nothing but watch as his uncle turned the lock on the door handle, something Harry had never bothered to use, because it was always locked from the outside. His thoughts all came back in a rush as Uncle Vernon started to undo his belt, and unbutton his pants.
“Maybe after our trip to Diagon Alley we can arrange something. I’m sure mother could make the arrangements.” Draco offered. “They should have quite a few to choose from.”
He turned around to the door that led to the dining room and entered. Dumbledore, Severus, and Narcissa were seated at the far end of the table and seemed to be enjoying their conversation. Narcissa and Dumbledore were smiling, and even Severus looking
“He did. We went running for about an hour, but he gave me the rest of the morning off before meeting him again this afternoon.” Harry replied. “Care to join me in the shower?”
He stood there for a moment, letting the water from his face drip and wet his shirt before he decided to just take a shower. He was hoping that it would make him feel a little better, and showering usually did that. He left the bathroom and headed out of Draco’s room, entering his own room a short moment later. He numbly walked to his bathroom and stripped down, turning the taps in the shower on to a random temperature before climbing in.
It was a subconscious thing, he reckoned. Meemy was the one who had greeted him when he first arrived, so it was she who he called on. He continued to watch as the elf flipped the burgers and brushed them with butter. His mouth was watering in anticipation of the food that was sure to be delicious.
“Nipsy would be delighted, Master!” Nipsy said, turning to Mrs. Malfoy. “Just be telling Nipsy where she needs to go.”
The trip inside was fairly quiet, but it didn’t take very long, either. Harry was walking slightly behind Draco and caught himself staring at his arse at least twice. Merlin, he was in trouble.
Hello everyone :) I hope you're enjoying the fic so far. I know that my chapters are posted few and far between, and I can only hope that you are finding other fics to occupy your time. I've started a new job and have been working 12-16 hour days. It takes the joy out of life, to be honest, and all I want to do with my downtime is sleep. But, I have been spending the free time that I do get trying to write a couple of words here and there. So, I hope you enjoy this chapter, and the -eventual- others. As always, please leave comments/ suggestions/ constructive criticism in the comments. Happy June <3
“For too long, boy, you have failed to show me the respect I deserve. We thought we could beat it into you growing up, but apparently, that wasn’t enough. I couldn’t touch you when your Godfather was in the picture, but he’s not here anymore, is he? Now you’re going to learn the hard way what happens when you disrespect me.” Uncle Vernon nearly whispered, turning to close the door as he spoke to Harry.
With a shrug, Harry started to turn back towards the house, scanning the bottom of the stairs as he did so. At the bottom, he saw a dark figure with the unmistakable blonde hair of a Malfoy. He paused, unsure if said figure wanted to be left alone. He deliberated for only a moment longer before taking the steps and sitting next to the person, who, now that he was closer, he could see had their arms wrapped around their knees with their head buried deep. Draco, then, as he could never see Mrs. Malfoy sitting in such a position.
Harry was woken up early the next morning by a very enthusiastic Draco. He was kissing him, little kisses that started at the top of his head and had gone down his face. Draco was working on his neck now, and Harry sighed happily. He had done this before and it was one of his favorite ways of getting woken up. Draco took it a step further, though, when he started working his way down Harry’s chest, licking and teasing him as he continued to Harry’s stomach, where he placed soft kisses that
The heat had been pretty staggering the past few days, and Harry had been ditching his shirt and footwear almost as soon as he got outside. He had a decent tan going now and he
Narcissa just shook her head and spoke softly. “Don’t you spend a second more thinking about it, Severus. I know in my heart that you did your best. It’s more than we could have asked for with the situation being what it is.”
He figured if he could just make it back to his house, he would be able to send word to his remaining friends that he needed help. That was what he was hoping, anyways. He wasn’t even sure of who would come, since the latest incident he was involved in resulted in his Godfather and best friend dead, with one of his other best friends permanently injured. God, he needed to stop that train of thought right there, he simply couldn’t think of Ron or Hermione, and especially not Sirius. Not now.
Dumbledore entered wand first into the house with Severus right on his heels. They were immediately greeted with blood that was smeared on the floor. It ran the length of the stairs, into the hallway, and passed the door that Severus knew would lead to the kitchen and living area.
Chapter 5 is here!!! So much quicker than the last one :O Truthfully, this chapter was very easy to write, and I hope to keep cranking them out. Fortunately/ unfortunately, I start work Friday in a new position, so I'm probably going to be very busy these next few weeks. I'll try to keep posting, though!
be fairly straight forward for you to understand, now that you’ve seen it in action. Now, I want you to focus on putting all your thoughts behind something. That something can be whatever you want it to be; a wall, a shield, etc - it’s your choice what your barrier looks like. When you think you’ve done that, nod your head, but make sure to keep your thoughts and memories locked away. Understood?” Snape finished.
Harry truly looked around at his surroundings for the first time, and noticed that he had been dropped off on a rather tight street, right in front of some rather impressive looking gates. He looked to the left and to the right, but all he could see was a mossy covered wall, maybe 5-6 feet tall, with huge, dense Alder trees thickly placed behind the wall, making it impossible to see what was behind them. He turned around and noted that there was nothing behind him, save for the solitary road he came in on, and huge open fields, which were occasionally dotted with more trees.
Severus was surprised, thinking he would have to talk the boy into letting him learn what happened. But he quickly hid his shock.
“We’ll start as soon as you’re presentable. Take a shower, eat some breakfast, and as soon as you meet me on the west lawn, we will begin.” Snape said, standing to leave.
With that, he grabbed the terrified looking Draco and stern looking Narcissa by their arms and left with a slight *pop*
However, his train of thought was stopped when he felt his wards being viciously attacked; he grimaced. It seemed that the Dark Lord was
Draco slowly started bobbing up and down, slurping every now and again when his lips broke the suction. The sound only seemed to heighten Harry’s pleasure, though, and he found it hard to keep his body lying flat. He needed to do something, so he moved his hands to the back of Draco’s head and carded them through his hair.
When he finally made it to town, he decided to have a late breakfast at the greasy spoon he found on the way in. As he made his way inside, he quickly noticed how cozy the little place was. Along the right side of the wall were windows that were in the perfect position to let the afternoon sun stream in, and on his left were a row of chairs along a bar, which he imagined were usually filled with a few people who were happily talking amongst themselves. After taking the scene in for a moment, he decided to sit towards the end of the bar, where he was swiftly greeted by an elderly lady of about seventy, who, after taking his order, promised to have his food out shortly.
“Do you understand so far?” At Harry’s nod, he continued. “Good. Now, the incantation itself is fairly easy, though the power needed to cast such a spell is great. You must understand that this is extremely potent magic, Harry, and you might feel uneasy or even sick while I am casting the spell. This is normal, and it should settle quickly.”
“Yes. Yes to the first, and yes to the second. I still don’t have a firm grasp on nonverbal casting, and I need to in order to take part in whatever training Severus has planned for me.” Harry said.
3 days later, and Harry was making steady progress. The simple spells were easy enough to do, but if he got into anything past second or third year, there simply wasn’t enough power behind them. Resigning himself to trying again the next day, Harry called it a night.
Draco laid down next to him, using one arm to prop his head off the ground. It was a long while before either of them spoke again. Harry was waiting for whatever Draco was going to say, but it seemed the boy was content to sit in silence. Harry, however, was not.
“I love you, too.” Draco replied, taking Harry’s hand and walking them in the direction of the house.
“What do yo-,” The elderly lady started to say before throwing herself down to shield herself from the incoming rubble. After a few seconds when it had stopped raining debris, she dared to peek over the counter and saw a giant hole in the wall. With a squeak, she proceeded to faint on the spot.
Severus was shocked. It seemed that Petunia had some common sense, after all. Perhaps it would do Harry some good to know that his aunt had left his uncle and appeared to show true remorse for what had happened. He folded the letter back up and tucked it into a pocket inside his robes. Dumbledore gave him a searching look but said nothing.
They ended up heading back shortly after, since Harry didn’t want to chance missing planning their trip with Severus and Remus. Draco ended up piloting the broom on the way back, and Harry enjoyed it almost as much as he enjoyed being the one to fly it. It was great to just hang on and look around while Draco had his fun.
, not asking. Perhaps he is a little upset with me for leaving without letting him know myself, and that’s why he was so blunt about it.” Narcissa said.
With a sigh, he grabbed the bottle of dittany and started dripping a few drops around the cursed skin. When the smoke cleared, all Severus could see was what appeared to be a years old scar that traveled the length of Harry’s torso.
He cracked an eye open, trying to see if the blinding light had gone. It seemed to have stopped, so he relaxed his muscles and opened his eyes fully.
“It’s no big deal. I understand, to be honest. Whenever I tried to grieve for Sirius and Ron, someone always popped up to make sure that I was ‘okay’.” Harry said. “I usually replied with something along the lines of ‘obviously I’m not bloody okay, now fuck off’. Seemed to do the trick.”
“Professor Snape Flooed to Spinner’s End. That’s the last thing I saw before I heard you calling me back.” Harry said sheepishly.
“Now, with that said, I think I told you not to leave anything out of your story. If we are to have any form of
“However, I shouldn’t have left without making sure that you were stable. I should have realized that dragging one of your most horrible memories to the surface would leave you in a state of conflict, but I selfishly acted upon my anger, and it left you a mess. So, with my sincerest truth, I am sorry for putting you through that, Harry.” Severus finished.
“You know, Harry,” Draco started. “I was thinking about you the other day. You were outside with Severus and I was watching you duel with him when an errant daydream ran through my head.”
“It’s your family ring, Harry. It is usually passed down from father to son when the parent deems the child ready. I retrieved this from the kitchen of your destroyed family home on the night that Voldemort tried to murder you. I feel rather guilty for holding on to it for so long, but I can safely say that I fully believe you have earned the right to wear that ring.
“Potter, I-… I obviously didn’t intend to imply that your love for Black was anything less than what it is. I simply wish for you to see the error of your more… Gryffindor traits. All I wish is for you to put that brain of yours to its full potential. I
that Draco had been watching him. What he didn’t understand is why Draco hadn’t come said something to him. Was Draco upset with Harry for not telling him sooner? Before Harry offered to give him a massage?
“Don’t worry, Harry. I understand, and wish you the best of luck in your efforts today.” She replied, also standing up.
If you've noticed any plot holes, grammar errors/ mistakes, please feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to address them!
“Of course not! Meemy was only hoping you would be back sooner. Master Potter is refusing to rest until he is speaking to you.” Meemy said.
Draco didn’t say anything. He looked sad, but Harry couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He let go of Draco, trying to turn away, but Draco pulled him back, grabbing him into a fierce hug, one arm around his waist and the other in his hair. He melted into it resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry was immediately transported into Snape’s head, but all he could see was Professor Snape pacing back and forth with his hands behind his back.
Harry’s birthday was fast approaching and he decided that he wanted to visit the neighboring town. He figured while he was there, he would be able to find himself a gift, and would be able to get out of the house for a bit. So with that thought in mind, Harry left on a bright and sunny morning in the middle of July, with nothing else but his muggle clothes, some money, and his wand.
He reached in the stall and turned the taps on full blast, letting the sound of the splashing water drown out his thoughts for a moment. After briefly watching the water swirl down the drain, Severus reached into a pocket of his robes and pulled out the shrunken trunk that he had hastily put together earlier. He took it into the other room and set it near the end of the bed, using a lazy flick of his wand to bring it back to full size. He opened the lid and brought his out his shower bag. Severus never left Spinner’s End for prolonged periods of time without having basic cleaning supplies on hand. He found he preferred his own crafted soaps to those he was usually afforded outside his home. Bag in hand, he walked back to the bathroom, which was slowly billowing out wonderful clouds of steam.
“Believe it or not, Potter, my father was a good man. He made a mistake following the Dark Lord all those years ago, but he was trying to rectify that. He had plans to get us away from the manor, away from that crazy son of a bitch. He just needed a little more time to make sure that it was a clean break, and then we were leaving. It really sucks that he died when we were so close to getting away.
. I couldn’t leave him there for them to do Merlin knows what to his body.” Severus snapped. “I’m sorry, Narcissa… I tried to grab him, but there were too many of them, and…”
Harry nodded and waited for the man to continue. He heard him shuffle around for a moment, and then his voice came from somewhere in front of him.
, when Harry bit his lip and he might be wrong, but wasn’t that blood he tasted? He tweaked Harry’s nipple hard in return and Harry tossed his head back. Draco took this time to say, quite breathlessly, “I want you inside me, Harry. In the shower.”
Lucius slowly put down the quill he was holding and stood up. For a moment, Severus thought he was going to attempt to curse him, but that thought went away when Lucius rushed over to him and pulled him into a painful kiss.
He pulled his slim, naked frame from under the sheets and stood up, twisting and cracking his back in the process, his arms pulled high over his head to stretch the muscles there.
Lucius turned around to the sound of his cries and saw too late the bolt of green that was headed straight for him. Lucius locked eyes with his lover and gave a small smile before the spell hit him. He dropped to the ground, smile still in place, looking every bit as elegant as he ever had.
“I know, pup. I know.” He said, placing his chin on top of Harry’s head as the boy leaned into the hug and cried against his chest, a few tears of his own sliding down his cheeks.
He came, exploding into Draco’s mouth while Draco kept the pace up. Harry could feel him swallowing as wave after wave of pure pleasure hit him. Only when Harry collapsed onto the bed, boneless, did Draco release him from his mouth.
It was agonizing minutes later that Draco remembered Harry was waiting for him to tell him to speed up, and he wanted to slap himself. His dick was leaking pre-cum and he was shaking slightly from the feelings Harry was producing in him.
Now he was looking down at the boy, who was pale and breathing quick, shallow breaths. He could see the damage to his left side - damage caused by a spell that he knew all too well. Severus bent down to check his pulse, and in doing so, noticed the blue tinge to Harry’s lips; after confirming how weak his pulse was, he knew he had to act fast.
He stood there, trying to get his scattered emotions in check. The sadness that he had immediately pushed away when he heard the men speaking in the living room was hitting him in full force now, washing over him like cold water on a hot day, and he couldn’t fight it. Tears started falling, slowly at first, but he was eventually on his knees, sobbing.
“Hmm. Not really. I was just admiring how incredibly adorable you are when you sleep.” Harry replied.
Meemy was already bobbing her head in understanding by the time he was done. He took one hard look at her and then finished his descent down the stairs. He made his way out the front door just in time for his forearm to burn again. Grimacing, Severus apparated to his
Severus stumbled out of his own fireplace, nearly falling in the process. He recovered at the last minute, maintaining his grip on Lucius all the while. He took a deep, steadying breath as he brought Lucius to the couch in front of the fireplace. He carefully set him down, removing the featherweight charm as he did so. It almost looked as if he had fallen asleep there, and once again, Severus had to fight tears of sorrow.
Harry woke up early the next morning, well before sunrise, with a crick in his neck. He had apparently fallen asleep in the chair last night, and his head was at a very awkward angle. Draco had switched positions at some point so that Harry could massage his other hand and arm. He, too, had fallen asleep, though a while before Harry had, and Harry was surprised to see that he still had one of his hands loosely wrapped around the other boys. He stayed that way for a while, watching the slow rise and fall of Draco’s chest before he decided to get up.
Draco opened his mouth to respond when a knock came from the door. Harry jumped, but all Draco did was to give a lazy “come in.”
“He said that now my Godfather was out of the picture, he was going to teach me what happened if I kept disrespecting him. He shut the door and unzipped his pants. I tried to apologize for disrespecting him, and he started choking me. He told me if I wasn’t quiet, that he would kill me. I tried to prepare myself to scream, knowing that I would only have one chance to do it and that my odds weren’t great. I wasn’t expecting him to molest me while he rubbed himself, and I was stunned for a moment.
Harry stopped the memory from going any further. He was aware that he was almost sobbing, but it didn’t matter, there was no stopping what was coming. He checked his shield to make sure he hadn’t lost his focus, and openly wept for his lost friend.
Draco was full of surprises like that. Harry had thought he had him figured out, and then Draco would come and turn his thoughts upside down. But Harry definitely wasn’t complaining. His life had truly never been better.
Harry smiled again, glad that they were willing to try. “Good, glad we got that settled. Now we can start planning our trip to Diagon Alley. I’m sure everything will be okay, but on the off chance that Voldemort (he noticed the loud intake of breath from Draco and Severus, but plowed on) can’t resist the temptation to ruin our day, I think it would be best to plan what we’re going to do should we run into any… complications. Severus?”
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted when the shower door opened. He turned his red, swollen eyes to the door and saw Draco. His breath hitched when he realized that Draco was seeing him totally starkers for the first time, but Draco wasn’t eyeing his body. In fact, his face showed nothing but concern.
“You definitely know Severus, but after what we saw earlier… Do you think you two can work together? I don’t want to force anything, but it would make me feel a lot better. Both of you mean a lot to me.” Harry said.
Harry woke up with Draco’s arm wrapped loosely around his stomach. He flexed the muscles in his legs, trying to stretch without waking Draco. With his birthday now just a day away, Harry was excited for it for the first time in his life. That changed, however, when Severus came to get him that morning.
“Just a couple more weeks, and you won’t have to take them anymore. I’m really proud of your results already, Harry.” Severus said.
The group had now been talking for about fifteen minutes when Dumbledore clicked his tongue, and suddenly the people around the table started singing.
“Excuse me, but I do have one more thing to ask - I was hoping to employ the use of one of your house elves. I’ve already placed an order for some clothing and hygiene products in Diagon Alley, but they obviously can’t be delivered here, so I would need your elf to pick them up. Can this be accommodated?”
“Sorry, took a bit longer than expected. Found some of my dad’s old pj’s and they needed to be shrunk a bit.” Harry explained.
“Would you do me a favor, Harry? I’m going to make a trip to see a relative of mine, one I have not seen for many years. Would you inform Draco in the morning where I went? If things go well, I should be gone for a few days… If things don’t go well, well… let’s just hope for the best.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
“I feel that you are ready for the next step. However, do not take this lightly. What I will be showing and teaching you isn’t exactly ‘legal,’ and should Dumbledore, or anyone, for that matter, find out what you’ve been studying, we will both be going to Azkaban.” Snape stated, this time peering deep into Harry’s eyes.
, it’s getting close to my birthday, and I hadn’t left the grounds since I arrived here, so I figured I would head into town and do a bit of light shopping. When I got in to town, I saw a greasy spoon, and decided to grab a late breakfast. I had only been there for fifteen-twenty minutes before three Death Eaters apparated outside the place, and- and I did what I had to, okay?” Harry finished, daring his Professor with his eyes to challenge him for fighting back.
Severus smiled, something Harry had only ever seen a handful of times before he became somber again.
“With school out for the summer, I thought I made it clear that you were to report to me as soon as I called? It took you nearly fifteen minutes to show up today, Severus. Where were you?” Harry asked in the raspy voice.
Harry watched as Snape pulled a folded piece of paper out from his robes and took it as it was handed to him.
Hello everyone :) I swear, I'm not dead! Just super busy in my day to day life. I forced myself to stay home and write this out (I feel like it's obvious to tell, I think it's kind of rushed and really, really short) but I wanted to kind of write about Severus before I moved on in the story, sooooo yeah. Please enjoy this and let me know if you do in the comments (or if you hate it) and I'll start working on chapter 10 in the meantime!
He would not kill the obese man, but he would make sure he thought twice about ever laying his hands on another person.
Harry could feel him staring at him, watching his reaction. He couldn’t help the smile that broke out and met Draco’s eyes.
“Nonverbal castings, or more specifically nonverbal spells, are spells which are performed without saying the incantation out loud. Students typically spend all of the sixth year learning how to cast nonverbally, but I believe that you should be able to achieve favorable results rather quickly. The only thing required to cast nonverbally is concentration and mental discipline, something that you have shown a great deal of the past week.” Severus explained.
His wand was in his hand before he even thought about needing it, and with a quick, complicated twirl, he blasted Voldemort across the room and into a wall.
Harry was dreaming of flying at school. It was something he dreamed about a lot, seeing as Quidditch was one of his favorite things in the world. He was seeker for the Slytherin team and he was damn good. It was something he inherited from his father, who was legendary in his time at Hogwarts.
Draco grinned and ran his hands up and down Harry’s thighs. He took one last look at Harry as he positioned himself in between his legs before he dropped his head and gave a teasing swipe at Harry’s cock.
Severus accidently let his concentration slip for a fraction of a second. He couldn’t help but feel satisfied that Vernon had been captured after what Harry had told him yesterday. When he realized what he was doing, he snapped back to the present, but it was too late. The Dark Lord had seen what he had been thinking and he was furious. Severus could see the rage burning in the red eyes and knew that he had less than a second to react.
Draco sighed. “Sorry, Potter. She has a way of knowing whenever I’m upset, so I assumed she had come to try and console me.”
He wasn’t aware of falling asleep, but when he awoke, his head was resting on a pillow and a blanket had been pulled over him. Meemy, he surmised. It brought a small smile to his face when he thought about how well the house elf had treated him since arriving. He was aware of the steel ball that now surrounded his mind, but it was as his professor has said; he no longer had to consciously think about it being there for it to exist. After another small smile, this one of satisfaction, Harry sat up and stretched his arms over his head, feeling refreshed and renewed after finally allowing himself to mourn his friend.
Spotting a tree, Harry pointed the front of the broom towards the ground and slowly descended until their feet touched the ground. Harry dismounted after Draco and the two retreated into the offered shade of the tree.
“Of course, Master Harry. Make sure you is washing up before coming to the table.” Meemy replied before disappearing.
His question was answered when Snape appeared a few feet behind the group of visitors, face and arm bloody, eyes swimming with emotion.
Harry took a rather large gulp of scalding hot tea at that statement and almost choked trying to clear the offending liquid from his throat. He coughed a few times before he replied.
"How are you going to have action if the child is falling asleep?" asks me. "Are you such a bad kisser that you killed him from boredom?" its asks me with his big eyes open.
"I love you, Harry," I hear him say between sobs. "And I would like not to be afraid, but I am. I am very afraid of hurting you or hurting the children. ”
I laugh at the kid's antiques and finish making my way to my family. I am so happy that Teddy is home that I can't stop smiling.
"How do you know it is a sun?" I ask him. "It could be anything, it could be a moon or a star. Or just a big, fat, shinny silver ballon."
Stick yourself to the protocol and you will be fine. I heard that one over and over again. The Academy drilled that into us, until it was second nature. Not impulsive shit when cases are this kind of complicated. No heroes, just a team ready to do their job at the best of their abilities.
"This is Miss Skitter, my Lord," Lucius says respectfully. "She has a lot of information on this Dray boy."
"Excellent decision, young Black," Olivander tells him. "Unicorn hair core, nine inches, is very flexible," the man tells him, looking at him. “It is one of a kind. But, it reminds me of you." And he smiles at him with knowing blue eyes.
"What kind of wizard is stupid enough not to know your name?" he asks to nothing, while the doors open.
"Come on, I want to show you something else," I tell him, as I pull him into the Hogwarts trophy room. "Here it is," I tell him, pushing open the door and making room for the blonde to enter. “This is the room where every Hogwarts championship is kept. Medals and trophies alike. In that corner is Quidditch, and in that other the dueling club,” I tell Dray, as we walk there. "There are other clubs too, like Exploding Snap," but Dray's first stop is at the Quidditch corner. A huge album floats in front of him.
"That's not completely the thruth, love," I say softly. “It is the color of his house. The family that Hogwarts gives you when you first attend here. No one asks you if you like the color, they just give it to you,” I tell him with a shrug. "Just as nobody asks you if you want to have a baby sister, they just give you one and that's it."
"He will be fine, Harry" I hear Kingsley tell me, and soon I feel his hand gently squeeze my shoulder. “The boy is strong. Merlin, having a cauldron child is not easy, let alone having two."
I reach my bond with Dray, making my magic collide against his consciousness repeatedly, until he is somewhat conscious. I ask with desperation for his location, and between uncoherent thoughts, he shows me memories. I feel like hyperventilating now, because none of this makes sense. This is not Dray’s muggle apartment in the middle of London. This is foreign.
“Are you sure this is not poisonous?” he asks while eying us. “I still have a little girl and a wife waiting for me at home, and even if I trust you, Hermione, you both weren't the smartest at Snape's class.”
“He is a… seer, like Luna Lovegood.” He answers softly. “Like any other vampire.” He looks down. “Redfern told me, too, that Argenti can be considered dark creatures like he,” he stars fidgeting with the hem of his sleeves. “And that the government condone those relationships between wizards and dark creatures.”
Severus has always been a man of few words, and the few he says can shake your soul. And this is why I consider him my friend, this man has saved me more times than I can count. He has saved me even from myself.
“Good morning, Master Harry. Sorry, but Meemy is sealing off the kitchen so she is not ruining the surprise.” Meemy said.
After what seemed like hours, but in reality was only minutes, Severus released the spells held on Vernon, leaving the man gasping for breath, with eyes streaming tears and nose dripping snot.
“For now. If he isn’t awake in two hours, you are to come find me, as I will need to re-administer the blood-replenishing potion. If he wakes before then, you are to come find me all the same. We have much to
“Having fun?” Harry asked, slightly louder than was necessary, causing Draco to gasp, breaking his concentration, which in turn caused the pillow to stop spinning in mid-air, and drop the seven or eight feet straight to his face.
Dizzy bowed deeply and slowly made his way inside, making sure that the Malfoy’s were following him.
“Professor Snape is in trouble. I think he needs help. I need you to get someone for me” Harry said.
“Not bad for your first day. You are in better shape than I gave you credit for, This is what will occupy our mornings from now on, and over time, it
Alecto responded by unleashing another wave of rage induced curses and she seemed hell bent on killing anything that was near Severus. This divided the group in half, with Draco and Lucius close to the fireplace, while Severus and Narcissa were dueling Alecto.
“Come to me, on the full moon,” a note of fear contaminated the urgency in Snape’s voice “I can ease the transition. I can contain you.”
When he took up his wand again, his hands no longer shook. The incantations looped rhythmically round his tongue, as if trying to soothe the broken cabinet.
The pleasant atmosphere did not relax him. Draco almost couldn’t believe the curse had worked so well the first time. It was, he had to admit, disappointing – he had expected to feel so different, as if in crossing an invisible line, he would finally become a true dark wizard. He had been practising on spiders and moths in the Room of Hidden Things, but it was something else entirely to see the effects of the curse on a real, human face.
He didn’t take it. Draco had always enjoyed an opportunity to make Potter squirm. Hermione turned again, eyes scrunched shut to preserve Draco’s modesty, shouting back at him,
Draco slammed the cabinet door on a motionless three headed mouse, trying in vein to swallow down his sobbing. He wept and moaned until hiccups bubbled up in his throat, echoing through the cavernous walls of hidden junk. Useless. It was all useless. His arms felt small and weak as a child’s.
"Pull yourself together, Cissy!” came Bellatrix’s voice, shrill with irritation. Though Draco could not see her, he could hear from the dip of her speech that she was bearing down on his mother “You should be grateful – honoured – that the Dark Lord has given Draco this opportunity to absolve is Father’s failure. Don’t you see? This is mercy.”
Hermione stood back, her arms bursting with two sprawling bouquets of monkshood and foxgloves, the tall stems lolling over both of her shoulders. She would have looked a little like she had been awarded a prize, where it not for her ugly herbology gloves, and the twigs caught in her bushy hair. When he met her gaze, she spun awkwardly on the spot, looking away as if the eye contact had made him more naked than before.
They had discovered him in a post-transition state, sleeping on a bed of moss in the dawning light. The woods were no longer his sanctuary. The jig was up. The secret no longer a secret. Draco knew he should be panicking, but all that was coming to him was laughter. Mad, wild laughter. Harry took a step back, a little bewildered.
“I wanted to...” Draco continued, still laughing as if Harry hadn’t said anything, trying to get a hold of himself “...I was going to eat you! Can you imagine?! Saint Harry Potter, the boy who lived, our saviour, the chosen one, gobbled up – eaten, by accident – by a, by…!” Draco lost himself again to the ridiculousness and hilarity of it all, howling with laughter so strong it made his stomach ache.
When Harry’s eyes chanced another look at Draco, they found the bite mark on his forearm. His expression lost some of its confrontation, softening as he looked over each lump and gouge of the scar tissue. Instinctively, Draco shifted his body to hide the mark from view. When their eyes met again, Harry blinked away his embarrassment, taking off his own cloak and holding it out at arms length, offering it to Draco to cover himself up.
It was only the two of them and McMillan in Slughorn’s class that afternoon, and Potter was doing a very poor job of covertly watching Draco over his copy of Advanced Potion Making. His green eyes were intense with thought, as though trying to answer a difficult question.
The wolf stood back from the forest paths, his ears alert and pointed, scanning the area for movement. The spiders were leaving their nest, hundreds of hooked, hairy feet crawling in a swathe through the forest. Their procession filled the pathways and overflowed upwards, into the branches of the trees. Other creatures stood at a respectful distance, watching the parade in solemn silence.
“Your currant transformations are volatile and unsustainable,” Snape continued, pace steady and commanding “You have acted carelessly, without proper forethought for the consequences. It is only a matter of time before you are discovered, one way or another, and put on the register. You will not be able to carry out the task you have been assigned, with the eyes of Dumbledore and the Ministry on you”
“Even then, Dumbledore wouldn’t suspect me,” Draco’s voice rose excitedly, almost laughing “He loves half-breeds. He’d probably adopt me, let me sleep at the foot of his bed like a good little werew–“
It was a him, and it was a human. The wolf could smell that he was close, but he could not see him. He should be caught in the knot of trees in front of him, but the wolf’s keen eyes could see nothing but empty space there. The smell was growing stronger, the breathing was warm, growing hotter, gathering close around the human’s body, unable to move through the night air. The wolf could hear him, but he wasn’t there. The wolf felt tricked. Was he not the clever one?
“Please,” she begged, still coming further undone “My lord, take me. He’s my son. My only son, please–!”
Rosmerta stood expectantly near the bar, as if she were waiting for Draco to take her on a Sunday trip. Her expression was happy and easy, almost relieved. She would do anything he asked – that much was plain – not out of love, or eagerness to please, but because it would satisfy her in a way nothing else had. Completing his task would set her life right. It would give her certainty, simplicity. She would take his hands in hers and thank him afterwards.
Throughout the lesson, honey-red flashes of distraction ruptured every train of thought Draco attempted to follow. The low rumble of the wolf’s hunger pushed up through his subconscious, like mist from the pours in the ground. The hiccuping solution he was brewing was going very badly. Draco knew the wolf did not, and would not care. Why did he have to inherit the wolf’s distractions, while the wolf remained immune to his cares and needs?
The sound of his mother was more terrifying than the werewolf transforming in his family home. The desperation in her voice ripped violently through her lungs, tearing the safe, untouchable image Draco held of her apart. Hearing such fear ravaging her felt like a violation. The sound made him want to be a man, wishing to grow tall and strong in an instant, and fight her fear away. She could not protect him any more.
“There is no glory to be gained from streaking through the night as a wild animal. Why are you so reluctant to control the beast?”
Dumbledore sat waiting at his desk, his usually brilliant eyes were sad and impassive over his half-moon spectacles. The headmaster did not fight. He didn’t even reach for his wand, hands clasped together calmly on his lap, as the wolf leapt on to the desk. Teeth closed immediately on his throat, ripping it out without so much as a gasp. The old wizard’s magic spilled out from the wound, like an aurora breaking from a jagged horizon of mountaintops. A beautiful and awful light filled the room, colours pulsing brighter and brighter.
Standing by his bedroom window, fascination had given way to horror. On the grass below him lay two albino peacocks, exploded in a mess of white and red, brutal and formless. The sight sickened him, but the thrill and fun of the chase was still in him, reverberating in his bones like an aftershock. Even as the pale false-eyes of the peacock feathers looked up into him, the urge was still there, ticklish under his skin, making him move and twitch were he stood.
“Harry!” Draco was woken by a familiar voice, not so far off from were he lay “Oh my gosh, Harry look.”
Shrill panic built like the noise of a whistle in Draco’s mind. The vanishing cabinet wasn’t working. If anything, it was worse than when he started. Notes sent through for Borgin to mark returned aflame. Small creatures returned dead or pathetically disfigured, looking up at him with hopeless questioning before he dispatched them in a flash of green light.
Snape finally had him alone, strategically cornered after Defence Against the Dark Arts. Behind him, a cauldron was steaming ominously. Delicate blue vapour rose up from it with a poisonous, floral smell. Draco knew he had done well to avoid him for this long.
The wasps in the moon spoke to him, buzzing with unsolicited advice. He could feel them, more and more the closer the full moon came – many tiny feet clamouring over one another to be heard by him, never not touching each other. The wasps said they could help. They could tell the wolf what to do, and he would do it. The wolf always listened to them. The wolf was built for murder and Draco was not. He was soft, juvenile and fearful of this new game, whereas the wolf had teeth and strength on his side. Beautiful red violence lit his eyes naturally. The wolf could do what needed to be done.
He was in the wasp’s nest. The white, woven walls rose up in a papery dome around him, glowing with borrowed light. Draco lay, buried alive in thousands and thousands of wasps, layered so thickly around him that he felt as if he were submerged in a mire of tar, or honey. The wasps did not sting him. Their shining bodies glistened under a fresh glare of light. Peering up through the writhing mass, Draco could see a perfect, circular hole in the roof of the nest. He reached out his arm, soon consumed by crawling insects. Not a patch of his skin was visible to him, vibrating under the buzz of the wasps on him. Still, he reached, stretching further and further. His fingers met an impossibly bright sphere. Grasping it tightly, he drew it closer. The wasps grew louder. Draco took the sun into his mouth.
All appeared wild and random. The wolf wove his path in a deliberate, tightening spiral, with the one who pursued him at its centre, backing cluelessly into a thicket of tightly packed trees.
There had been many night time visits to the manor in the summer since his father’s arrest. They were not like the visits of the summer before, when Draco had eagerly lingered outside the games room, deciphering what he could from the furtive, scheming and hopeful whispers. Instead, now there were long silences in full rooms of Death Eaters, pauses pregnant with dread, or interrupted by his aunt’s lunatic episodes. He had preferred it when his family was small.
Draco turned the galleon hopelessly over and over in his hand. When there was news, the coin burned. But it was cold. It had been cold for days, barely gaining any heat from his hand, convulsing over it in a continuous, nervous twitch. He slid to the floor, hidden in the furthest stall of the disused girl’s bathroom. The bolt rattled in the door with his uneven, panicked sobs.
The rabbit’s head stared back at him, strawberry pupils blown wide, mirroring his own shock, tiny paws crossed neatly in front of it. Draco could taste it now, stale and coppery on the back of his teeth, dried at the corners of his mouth and dripped grimly down his pointed chin. The rabbit’s back end was gone, leaving only a stringy dark nerve, threaded through small, white vertebrae beads, trailing off from the furry shoulders in a stark ellipsis. Black disgust slicked Draco’s insides.
Draco made no reply, head bowed low and defeated as he gripped the gargoyle’s shoulder for support. Fragments of bone, viscera and bile pooled darkly at his feet. Why did the wolf take in what his human body couldn’t handle?
Standing naked in the clearing didn’t feel vulnerable any more. The Forbidden Forest knew him now, and he had claimed his place within it. Staggering as the blood returned to his limbs, Draco retrieved his robes, cloak and school bag from the hollow of a nearby tree, dressing himself in a hurry. Making his way over the grounds, he felt more himself after spelling away the evidence of last night’s dinner.
“That won’t work on me,” Draco said quietly, meeting Snape’s eyes with defiance “My mind isn’t as wild and untameable as you think. Try again, if you like… if you really do want me to visit you on the next full moon.”
“Stay here, Draco,” the ease and grace was gone from Narcissa Malfoy’s voice, as she regarded her son through the narrow slit of his bedroom door “Don’t leave this room.”
Draco had never doubted the strength of his father’s love for him, until now. In his polluted state, he was no longer his father’s image. Draco still possessed his inherited skin, his bones, his hair, the ghost of his father’s voice in everything that he said – but not his purity.
Draco knelt, nude beneath the swaddle of his least favourite cloak. He had figured early on, that he would not have any robes left if he didn’t learn to hide them before he transformed. Shaking, he curled his body into a low bow, his face almost touching the ground – cursing the moon, cursing the Dark Lord, and cursing himself in his head in an endless, hateful loop. A dense mist closed in around him like a comforting embrace, shielding his eyes from the far off castle lights.
“Your moonlight wanderings have not gone unnoticed, Draco,” his voice was both warning and secretive, eyes staring fixedly from beneath his greasy hair, hoping to pin Draco down “The younger members of your house have come to me–”
” followed by a great crack, the hushing of voices and the muffled squeaking of chairs, all parting to make room for one high, thin voice;
“We know what you are, Malfoy,” Harry attempted a firm, serious tone “I’ve known since I saw you on the Hogwarts Express.”
Draco looked at Harry for a moment. Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but apparently, he found it, because he turned back to Narcissa.
He was walking towards the house when he noticed a faint pull of the wards, an alert that someone had arrived.
A few minutes later, with his hair still dripping slightly, Harry was at Draco’s room. He pressed an ear against the door but didn’t hear anything, so he figured that the other boy had already finished with his shower. He knocked lightly and heard footsteps coming to the door. It was opened to reveal a freshly showered Draco, dressed in the same bottle green pyjamas that Harry had seen the other night.
Meemy wasn’t kidding when she had listed things off. The first floor offered a study, drawing room, dining room, garden room, billiard room, kitchen with attached breakfast room, pantry, larder, utility room, and a bunch of smaller rooms, which Harry could only assume were used to greet people before moving them to another part of the house. The cellar was truly impressive, and it definitely held more wine than Harry would ever try to consume in his life time.
Harry handled the O.W.L. results far better than Draco, partly because he knew that Draco either did really bad or really good to warrant his behavior, and partly because the tests had seemed to have been taken in another lifetime. So many bad (and good) things had happened since then that he simply wouldn’t let them ruin his day if they had been bad.
Harry knew that he should turn back, that he should trust that Aunt Petunia would throw Vernon to the wolves. But part of him, his darker half, believed that she would have done nothing to stop it, had she known it was happening. So with that thought in his mind, Harry quickly walked the length of the street, heading towards Magnolia Crescent, as he had just a few years before…
“Fine, fine, he is fine Severus. Doing quite well, considering he was missing until this morning.” Dumbledore said, another piercing look shot his way.
Harry went skidding around a corner into an alley way, hearing the footsteps of his pursuer get closer and closer.
“I don’t want you to go to too much trouble. How about we grill up some hamburgers and have dinner on the patio?” Harry suggested.
“It’s her way of showing how proud she is. Whenever I do well in school, she gets all teary eyed and offers to buy me anything. The first two years of school I used this to my advantage. I got a couple things worth well over a thousand galleons, but when I got my exams back in third year, even though she offered to buy me whatever again, I didn’t get anything grand. It was just a new book to help me in ancient runes. She never questioned it.” Draco explained.
“Voldemort already did. That’s what Severus came to tell me this morning. They blew up Privet Drive and left Vernon’s body there with ‘Happy birthday’ carved into him. But even so, I would never want you to kill someone that wasn’t trying to kill you. Vernon was a horrible person and when he was captured by Voldemort, I couldn’t find any remorse for it. He’s dead now, and I would rather just forget he existed.” Harry said.
Alecto stopped laughing immediately and dropped to her knees. She reached for her throat, desperately trying to stop the blood from flowing. She let out an involuntary cough that sprayed blood all down her front and continued to struggle. It didn’t take long until she had fallen over and stopped moving.
“Of course, Master Harry. If Master is wishing, he could use either door to relieve himself. Master James and Misses Lily had separate bathrooms and dressing rooms. Would you like to use Master James’?” Meemy questioned.
When he reached the wall at which he had previously been picked up by the Knight Bus, he took a few moments to gather his thoughts. Was he really about to disobey his mother’s final wishes and leave the protection offered by his aunt? Did he really want to go back to a house where his uncle had tried to do something so horrible and foul to him? Obviously, he knew the answer was no, but it was still with hesitation that he dutifully stuck his arm out, and waited for the deafening bang to announce the arrival of said bus.
They left Lucius’ study, and crept along the wall until they reached a full-body portrait. Behind it lay a secret passage that headed towards the basement which would lead to the kitchens. Once they were safely inside the passage, they could hear Death Eaters all around the manor, searching rooms and crashing through the many hallways, but none knew where they were. It was slow work, moving in the thin space offered by the secret passage, but it was worth every discomfort to not be found, and after a few minutes of labored moving, they made it to the hallway that would lead down to the basement.
“Pray tell, Potter, why you didn’t call for your house-elves the moment the fighting was over? Tell me why you chose to walk, Merlin knows how long, back here. More so, why you didn’t call for them the moment you realized you were in trouble? I assure you they would have come, and they would have gotten you out. This is the same recklessness you displayed at the end of the school year, rushing off to save your godfather. What did that accomplish, Potter? Nothing! It got him
Harry had opted not to train that day, choosing instead to ask to spend the day in bed with Draco. Severus had looked like he was about to say something but chose not to and instead nodded his head in response to Harry’s question.
“I’m going inside, Mr. Potter. I imagine dinner will be soon.” Snape stated, grabbing his robes and walking away.
Again, the room fell to silence and Severus was tempted to speak, to offer further explanation to pacify Potter’s questions. The boy, however, spoke again.
They ate in silence for a few moments, with nothing more than a crunch or sound of swallowing between them. Harry was about to open his mouth to speak, but just then, Professor Snape walked in the kitchen. His eyes scanned the room before they landed on Draco, and Harry could swear that he saw a flash of concern before the professor switched his eyes to him. He walked over to the bar they were sitting at and leaned in close to Harry.
“That’s more like it. Now, I suggest we get up and make ourselves presentable. Do you plan on doing some training today?” Draco asked.
His heart felt lighter than it had in a long time when he was finished speaking, waiting for Remus to inevitably ask him questions.
They cautiously approached the house until they reached the front door. Dumbledore raised his wand and made a sweeping pass over it, checking for any kind of booby trap that might activate when someone tried to open it. He signaled to Severus that it was clear and opened the door with another small wave of his wand.
“Naturally, Harry, I will do my best. I have a great many questions for you, but I think most of them can wait. Did you learn any more information in your latest…
“O.W.L. results and school lists, no doubt. Just like Dumbledore said.” Draco announced when he realized Harry had arrived.
True to their word, Harry and Draco had showered and dressed in fifteen minutes and were on the deck waiting for the adults when they arrived. Harry had dressed comfortably, choosing a dark-grey muscle shirt that clung to his lithe frame and pair of dark blue jeans. Draco had dressed up a little more with his choice of a black long-sleeve button-up that had the sleeves rolled up, and pair of charcoal slacks that matched Harry’s shirt perfectly. They were comfortable but knew they looked good, especially if the raised eyebrows they got from Severus and the beaming smile from Narcissa were anything to go by.
the sounds he was making were absolutely filthy and not at all becoming of someone who was raised a proper pureblood, but he simply didn’t care.
When they had finished planning their trip, which they were set to embark on in less than two days, Harry and Draco stood up, intent on finding Narcissa and seeing if she would be able to accompany them to the horse-dealer, who was located just outside of Exeter, sometime this coming weekend. Remus stopped them, however.
“I think I will be staying here for a couple of days… well, tonight at the least, until I am able to talk to Harry. Is there an acceptable room, or should I retire elsewhere?” Snape questioned, gesturing to all of the doors on the landing.
“Do you think before you act, or do you act on impulse? Did it never occur to you that the Dark Lord would have people watching the Knight Bus? You should be thankful that they didn’t send more than three here today, that they didn’t attack you the moment you left the wards of this manor, as I doubt your story would have the same outcome.
Draco didn’t say anything, almost like he was frozen. Harry looked up at him and saw that Draco had tears streaks down his face, but he wasn’t crying anymore. Harry saw his face go from angry to sad before Draco seemed to realize that Harry was looking at him. He pulled Harry into a tight hug.
By this point, Harry was achingly hard, and if the thing stabbing into the front of his thigh was any indication, so was Draco. Harry dragged his hips forward, making sure to cause as much friction as he could, and again, Draco moaned, this time a little more throatily. Soft hands came up along Harry’s sides and back before they firmly held on.
They sat like that until Harry calmed down. As he pulled away, he saw the mess the he left on the front of Remus’ robes and a released a bubble of laughter.
Draco nodded and released a shaky breath. Harry stepped close again, drawing him into a kiss that had his head turned awkwardly but not wanting to break it. He felt Harry move his arm and suddenly there was something slick and cool running down the small of his back, and his eyes opened in surprise.
Shaking his head to get rid of the guilt he was feeling because he was ignoring his mother’s letter by leaving, he said, “Aunt Petunia… I have to go. I don’t care what you do with that foul bastard, but I’m not staying here.” And with that, he lightly pushed past Petunia, dragging his trunk and the cage loudly behind him as he descended the stairs.
“Very well, then. We will start after I feel that your Occlumency shields are strong enough, so please, try your best.” Snape said.
“But, Professor, I-“ Harry started to say, before he caught the slight shake of Snape’s head. He stopped speaking and let out a sigh before continuing again. “Fine. You have my word.”
“What do you think you’re doing? Unhand me immediately!” Snape growled out, snatching his arm out of the elf’s grip.
They had continued Harry’s training until Meemy came outside to ask if they were going to have dinner on the lawn as well.
“Severus, the Dark Lord will surely know that we helped you escape. Will Dumbledore offer us protection?” Lucius asked.
in. Severus willed himself not to lose his focus, not to snap inside this man’s head, and instead focus on what he was there to do.
“I’m guessing that no one has really filled you in on what’s happened?” Harry said, glancing at Severus, who was now looking at his nails with such studious over acting that Harry had to repress a snort.
P.S. The story is probably going to go a -little- quicker than I had originally intended. I feel terrible about taking months and months between each chapter, so to compensate, I've sped things up. I hope it doesn't come across too terribly.
The sun was hanging just above the treetops and there was a light summer breeze blowing that kept the heat at bay. They all took seats at the glass table that was positioned near the railing of the deck. Nipsy appeared as they were all sitting down and placed a large tray of iced-lemonade and ice-cold butterbeer on the table. Harry’s nutrient potion was included among the beverages and Harry picked it up along with a butterbeer.
Severus was quiet for a moment. He noticed the change in his voice, but couldn’t tell if Potter was angry or not. He decided he needed to change tactics.
“I’d like to know many things, Harry. The most pressing question is why you left your aunt’s protection, knowing it could cost you your life.”
failure, but we have some work to do. On your feet, Potter.” Severus said, before adding, “On my count.”
“I understand, of course, Professor. I’ve spent some time thinking about my understanding of spells, both offensive and defensive, and have noticed that I don’t know very much. I will take whatever knowledge you wish to give me.” Harry replied, still feeling the full force his professor was using to try and gain entry into his mind.
“Of course.” Draco replied. He held his hand out for Harry to take and nodded once to Remus before turning to leave.
Harry stood motionless, watching as the pillar of Slytherin house broke and crumbled. He never imagined that Draco, the Ice Prince, the perfect embodiment of their house, someone who had a mask that rivaled a brick wall, someone who could shut his emotions down without a second thought, would ever be a sobbing heap on the ground. He felt his heart break as he turned and walked to the headmaster.
Severus smacked himself, hard, and shook his head to hopefully get rid of the shock he was in. It seemed to do the trick, and he looked at Narcissa long enough to give her a brief nod before proceeding to walk over to where Draco wept.
“Mrs. Malfoy… I’m sorry for what happened to your husband. Are you doing okay?” Harry asked tentatively.
Meemy reappeared then, a hovering tray of food and vial of potion next to her. She levitated it over to the bed where it landed in the middle.
They had gone down to the lake after lunch to do some swimming. Dumbledore and Narcissa were reclining on the beach while Draco and Harry were in the water, swimming close together and occasionally sharing a kiss when the group received a big surprise from Severus.
“Merlin, yes, Harry. Please move.” Draco rasped out. The feeling of Harry’s cock so deep inside him and the dull press against his prostate was making Draco want to squirm, just to get a feeling of that flash of ecstasy.
“When you have reduced this to dust, your real training will begin. However long it takes, make sure that you have a firm hold on nonverbal casting. I will be waiting.” Severus said.
Harry gratefully took the proffered hand and mumbled, “Thanks, Draco. Sorry for calling you a berk, and for crashing into you.”
He finished drying himself off in his room and tossed the towel to a corner before sliding under the covers. He grabbed his wand from off the bedside table and with a small flick, the flames in the lamps died out. He lay on his side, staring out of the window at the night sky and waited for sleep to claim him. It had been such a tedious day, but Severus couldn’t help but feel this was meant to be.
Seconds later, there was a massive scream of rage followed by a spell that exploded the wooden table behind which they were all taking cover.
Harry mulled this over for a few seconds. On one hand, he really didn’t want to stick his nose where it didn’t belong. He hadn’t dealt much with Draco over the years, and when he found out his father was a Death Eater, he had wanted even less to do with him. But on the other hand, he didn’t like the fact that someone in his house was suffering so terribly, and he potentially
He was about to speak when he suddenly felt his Professor attack his mind. He was momentarily stunned and was about to voice his shock before he realized he was being tested. He made sure the shield around his mind was still firmly in place before he spoke.
Harry listened as Mrs. Malfoy gave Nipsy directions and handed the elf an almost overflowing bag of gold. The elf took the bag and vanished it almost instantly. Nipsy then bowed deeply and disapparated.
“If you would be willing, I’d like for you to talk to my son. Maybe help him see that this isn’t the end of the world. I know he’s in pain, but he can’t let this break him.” She said.
“I never want to see these clothes again, please. Vanish them, burn them, I don’t care.” Harry said turning his back to the elf as he did so. He couldn’t bring himself to look her in the face, knowing he was weak for not doing it himself, but Meemy didn’t ask questions.
“It was in the Prophet this morning. A picture of your old house, completely obliterated. They found his remains inside, protected by a shield. He showed signs of being badly tortured before he was bitten, multiple times, by a snake. Presumably the Dark Lord’s pet... He had a message carved into him, but I’d prefer not to tell you, as it’s unnecessary. Dumbledore implored me not to tell you the details of his stay with the Dark Lord, for fear of upsetting you, but I felt like you deserved and can handle the truth.” Severus said.
believe that Dumbledore would leave him here if he was in even the slightest bit of danger?” Severus nearly shouted.
“I thought you’d like to begin the next part of your training. I was going to wait until we got to Hogwarts, but the nutrient potion has been having such a positive effect on you that I don’t see the point in waiting. If you’re agreeable, we’ll start every morning at this time and go for a run. Nothing
The two sat in silence for a few minutes; Draco’s breathing evened out and his sniffing became more and more intermittent.
“So, what do we do about this?” Professor Snape continued. “We must have you master Occlumency. The shield in your mind must be strong enough to withstand the Dark Lord. And in order to accomplish that, I want you to first get a feel for what strong shields are like. On the count of three, I want you to use
They both dove behind the thick wooden table that Draco and Narcissa were using for shelter, screaming the killing curse the whole way. Severus peeked over the top of the table and watched as the sickly green lights hit two of their opponents square in the chest. They both slumped down the ground, no longer able to fight.
Now, however, he regretted not getting to know Draco sooner. Harry was shocked even further to find out that Draco didn’t support a full pureblooded society.
There was a peace that spread through his body as the ring settled into place. It was like a feeling that something that had been missing for years had finally been returned to him, and it made him slightly breathless. He could feel the magic pulsing around the ring, but it didn’t worry him. He
Harry fumbled for a moment before he asked, “Would you be willing to go with me to pick it out? It’s only... I don’t know anything about horses.”
Draco and Narcissa had taken refuge behind an overturned table and were firing spells off at three Death Eaters who all had similar positions around the kitchen. Lucius and Severus wasted no time entering the fight, both of them aiming to kill.
“Meemy is only one of three house elves here, Master Harry. Would Master like to meet the others?” Meemy asked.
Harry looked around the long hallway as Meemy brought him into the Manor, catching sight of what appeared to be a study, followed by a dining room to his left, before Meemy turned right and swept him up a set of stairs. They ended up on a galleried landing, with doors seeming to go in every direction. Meemy brought Harry almost directly across the landing, and opened the door into a large room.
He lifts her hand full of homemade popcorn while the Stitch is up in a strange ship that’s sailing to space. And I think about my own mother, how she did work so hart in one saving. And I feel a bit jealous of my own boyfriend. His dad is always working in little savings… Because he is expecting to spent a lot of time with his son.
"Happy Auror day, Pa." He tells me, his arms closing around me, brief seconds, then gives Bill Weasley's address and disappears into the green flames.
“We see each other, Harry Potter,” he says smirking at me. “Let me tell you something so you can do your heroic deed. I will destroy Hogwarts today night. So, you can be everyone's hero, again. I will give you that before I destroy you and your soulmate in the process,” I feel my rage building, but my body is frozen. “And when I kill you I will make him watch, just so I can wake up the little rogue argentum that’s sleeping inside him.”
"Fred," I heard my mom scream and the whole room goes silent. "George Weasley," and my two twin brothers look at her with a smile on their faces.
“So, you think we can do something to save Draco?” Hermione asks, her eyes shinning with hope, her hands holding a pen and a notepad.
“No,” Hermione is dead serious. “You will take down Naggini and Rowena Raveneclaw tiara,” he says. “It’s still in Ravenclaw common room.”
"I don't care who he is. He needs to get better," and she frees herself from my grip. "And I don't care if you are Harry Potter or Merlin himself, if you dare to stand between my patient and me again, I am going to hex you so hard, your great-grandfather will feel it. Did you hear me, kid?" She walks past me and I smile.
Draco leaves the room and pauses for a moment, his face turning in my direction and giving me the most beautiful smile I have seen him in recent days. I barely notice the lady from early is gone.
“Fuck,” I whisper knowing this is worst. This is worst then being alive. I grasp my wand whispering a spell to put him in comma and then, casting an extasis charm on his body.
He is the kid that has been gifted with life. But his mate… His mate is his equal, his opposite. His mate is the one that has been gifted with death.
“They were a hallucination,” I whisper shily to him, not wanting to burst his bubble of happiness. “And I am sorry that whoever made this to you is opening wounds that were healing somewhat, somehow.” I caress his hair with my bare hands, knowing he is like a big white cat, loving to have people play with his hair.
I can't help the sob that comes out of my lips, while I feel like my heart is breaking into a thousand pieces again.
“Where’s Luna?” I ask my mother, while sitting on the bed. This bedroom is so different from the manor. “And, where are we?”
"So I already found my soul mate?" the woman in the elevator asks, as she raises her hand and shows her hand, a ring on her index finger.
"Are you threatining me, brat?" his voice is a low growl. "I have years figthing Wizards that are worst then you."
"Yeah Dad," Teddy follows in that smug tone that only means one thing: problems. "How would you describe the way Paps looks at you?"
And I stop for a moment to appreciate his slender body wrapped in a white shirt with a gold clasp where the tie should go. My boyfriend? I don't know yet, but I hope we will soon be. Dray looks desirable dressed that way.
I caress his cheek with the back of my hand gently, trying not to press. Trying to keep my magic inside of me. Trying to keep our link intact.
“I think he is doing better,” I say to her, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes. “Thanks for being here, Mione.”
I walk from outside Hogsmeade to the castle where I spent most of my adolescence, rejoicing in knowledge and sharing with my two best friends. If it hadn't been for this place, I would never have met Harry or Ronald. Although, even if the world may not believe it, they are the two most important people to me, apart from my parents.
Hey, guys, I have a fucking fever of 103 F, and I feel like shit. But, this was nagging inside my head... So, I tried to writte the best I could.
Nymphadora steps up at Kingsley’s side and I feel my face draining too. What is she doing here? Teddy is home sleeping and she is here… Doing what exactly? I swallow trying to gain my composure back when Ron hits my shoulder. I sigh trying to keep it quiet inside my own soul and body. I am pretty sure I am losing it.
“But you are fighting it,” Hermione chimes in. I look at her and I can see a little notebook ready on her hands. “Why isn’t Draco able to fight it?”
“I'm not a babe to be held like this,” I tell him, but still, I hide my head against his chest. "I feel miserable."
"Tonks?" Ron asks, as if he knows something is wrong with that name. "That is not a pureblood surname."
Until the pressure is gone and I can see the fiery strands of Harry’s magic dancing happily inside my core.
"Harry!" he yells at me from the bottom of the stairs, finally releasing the girl's hand. "Bye, Pansy," I heard him say over his shoulder.
"That's a great man, Harry," Arthur tells me, loosening his grip on Molly. "I hope that very soon he becomes part of the family."
My eyes fall on the room that is practically empty. Filled with candles and incense, it reminds me of Trelawney's classroom and I can't help but smile on my lips.
"There are only five papers in this bag," I reply, as I shake the aforementioned item. "This will be like a sort lottery." I tell them with a tight smile. "A very gore lottery."
“Yes, I can and I will,” his eyes so grey, they look like a storm is rigging inside them. “The only reason of his survival was because Zephora brought him back from the death,” he says, opening the book on his hands and searching for an entry. “The premature departure of one Albus Dumbledore, to the realm of the death, is the catalyst to ensure the survival of Lord Voldemort, since his knowledge will be lost to the Boy Who Lived,” he paused and looks up at me. “To ensure the victory of the light side is necessary to keep Dumbledore alive and to achieve that, a necromancer might be needed.”
“Whatever it was… It mangled Blaise to near death,” she says, swallowing her own sobs. “He was mangled Harry. I am not even sure how he is alive anymore.”
"To the usual place," Blaise says in almost a whisper. Meanwhile, I can feel new sources of magic begin to break into the barriers.
"Maybe thirty hostages," I say without swallowing anything. "Or that is what we could hear with the small coin that we infiltrated in the house of their leader." I take a deep breath and tap the tip of my pen against the surface of the desk. “We know that Evelyn Yards is their next target. She is Muggle-born, excellent witch and she fits physically with the people who have disappeared in the last three months.”
I stare at Hermione and Ron. Mione is sitting by my side and Ron is on one of the armchairs of the bedroom.
“I would explain you,” I stop to look at her. “But, I am not going to waste my breath trying. You will not understand.”
"I would have brought the world down for him, Severus," I tell my friend, looking down at an old necklace. The necklace I gave Narcissa the day we got married.
"Of course not, Kreacher," I kneel until we both are at the same level. "You know Draco really likes when you make pastries for him, don't you?"
I watch silently as Bill Weasley take a few hairs out of Draco’s head and dump them in the Polyjuice Potion. It gurgles and then, settles completely.
"Ginevra," Molly Weasley's voice is a whisper that makes me sit up straight. “Stop teasing Harry and his boyfriend. He has been sad and dull for the past three years. And you're engaged to Blaise Zabini, be respectful of the both of them,” Molly pointed at her with the spatula. "Now when Dray returns to eat dinner diner with us properly, I hope you will apologize to him and I hope that apology is sincere."
"War? What war? " he asks and I see the pain in his eyes. “No matter what it is or how many things you say I can do, I will not kill anyone. What would my mother or my father think of me?"
So, I decided to talk to Draco and return two of each. So, my husband still makes breakfast in the morning and reads a story to the children at night. So my husband still waits for me on the living room couch reading and still talks to me every morning while we shower together. And he decided to help some of his college students via Zoom. Although Draco doesn't know how to use it very well, the kids help him and Dray enjoys helping them. Two hours a day, three days a week.
“Sign the papers, Mr. Potter,” she says to me. “I am not sure about your relationship yet, but I can see you care about him and that is enough for now.”
, Zephora's words are one of the few things that I allow myself to remember before opening the door to my bedroom.
I respectfully raise my hand, giving Kingsley a chance to deny me permission to speak. My heart still pounding about Kingsley telling them about Draco Black being in our ranks. Shit.
"I said I would do it soon," I remind him annoyed. "When I am completely sure that you will not do something to scare him and he decide he don't want to see me ever again."
And that he, my blondie love, did. He destined thirty minutes every day to navigate through the telly, the cable that he insisted he needed to do a thorough job and an equally thorough inform. He took an unhealthy love for History Channel, I remember. He would watch The Science of Stupid presented by Robert Dallas, and then he will compare it to Arithmancy and Potions.
"Don't lie, mate," I say seriously. "You know I'm always going to support you, right?" Next to me, Mione nods seriously.
I rush up to him and extract him from the Quidditch pitch before any of the guys manage to run him over successfully, and that's going to ensure Voldemort has competition, because I'm completely sure Regulus Black is not a man you can mess with and get out of it alive. Literally, he has only been protecting Dray for years, and he has done so successfully. My mother protected me once, a good witcht just like my own dad, but definitely not the best when it came to dueling.
I was thinking hard about cutting open a vein or something, and then Linking Park blasted on my sound system and I felt good enough to come gift you all with a 3000 words chapter.
"My Lord," and it is this same blonde with blue eyes who opens his mouth to address our Lord. "We found something unusual during the last days of the month, my Lord." His eyes look to the ground, while one of his knees makes contact with it. Anyone would think that Lucius Malfoy is as handsome as a prince charming, but the truth is that Lucius Malfoy is just a hoax. "Something we had no information about until it happened."
"Kids, class is over now," says Hagrid. "If you are late, Professor McGonagall will punish you," I hear Hagrid's booming voice and I can't help but smile, remembering when it was me who was trying to stay so I wouldn't go to McGonagall's classes.
"Harry?" Hermione calls me, as an object flies back towards me. It's a very small sweater and I reach out my hand and the light unfolds.
"So, I am going to fetch Draco from wherever he is right now and you keep the pastries just like Draco loves it," I put a hand on his shoulder and I smile softly at the elf. "And put a new sweeter on, okay? Draco would be most displeased if he knows somehow that you are not changing clothes daily."
"Being the key word was," Goldstein says. "He was happy, which means in the past he was happy. You don't know about the last month, and I am sure as hell being a hermit doesn't help to keep your mental health in shape, never mind mentioning the fact that maybe, as he never came looking for a mind healer, he could still be suffering from horrible nightmares. I don't know about you both, but I hadn't forgotten how many shits he had to endure and do under the Carrows, never mind that he lived in the same house as a Manic Sociopath and his cruel psychotic snake."
“You can always do us a favor, Draco,” I hear her soft whisper. “Everything will be forgiven for us, my dragon,” she caresses my cheek with the back of her hand. “Everyone will forgive us, you just have to do one single thing, my darling,” I can feel a kiss over my forehead.
"Papa says I am smart because you are smart," Scorpius says to me repeating what he heard at home, his young brain absorbing everything.
"It's okay, Severus, I will do as you are saying" I tell him and Narcissa's sky blue silhouette appears in front of us.
There will be another chapter this Friday as well. Sorry I couldn't post on Friday. I am not letting this story alone :D
“It will only take a moment, Nesha. You'll be better,” I tell her, dipping my finger into the foul substance that is dittany and gently touching the snake's wing. "See? Everything is fine."
Slowly, I let my hand travels to his face, taking his chin with my dominant hand. The movement is obliging him to lift his face and the sight that welcomes me is one I want to burn in my memory forever.
"As Minister you shall know, Blaise Zabini was assigned a couple of days ago to find out the reason why there was a time-space disturbance," Hermione tells him in a serious voice. "Blaise found the reason for that disturbance yesterday night," her brown eyes serious. “Yaxley is no longer in Azkaban. Someone freed him last night. We think the disturbance that was caused exactly fifteen days ago, was a prepparing measure to ensure the freedom of the Death Eaters."
“Love,” I rasp out, feeling my throat protest by my abusing it, but feeling my awareness coming back.
“Give it a try again, Draco,” Redfern says to me. His evergreen eyes looking straight into my soul. “You have power inside you. A really endless source and you can feed your soulmate with it.”
"Happy birthday, Harry," his entire body wraps around me and I feel more than satisfied. More than happy.
In a burst of white, hoy magic that engulf all the death eaters in the room I can hear their screams of pain. The sound is visceral and it’s cutting inside of my head, because they are mingling with Dray’s own despair. This is the cry of a kind soul that has been reduce to nothing.
"I love you, Harry James," he says to me and the brightness returns to his eyes and I feel lighter again. Happy. Complete.
I turn my face and look at her like she's the nastiest thing on the planet. I watch her walk away with laughter still reverberating softly around her.
"Because they were harvested during the new moon," Olivander tells him. "It's a special sand, it's made with wood from a tree that was thought to be extinct," Olivander tells him. “They recently found three more. So… They will no longer be extinct, if you..." and his eyes roam over all of us,  "Take good care of them,” and his eyes fell on me again briefly, then he looks to Dray. “One day you will know which tree I am talking about. Come visit me soon,” and with that, Olivander and his wands disappear.
“I need a chance to scape this cage, Harry,” he says to me. “I need to be free, so I can go back to you. Ok? I don’t care if it means I have to play being part of the Adam Family, I will gladly be. I need to break free from this stupid cage. It is supressing my magic, and it is starting to hurt.”
I still stand inside my own core, my own magic flowing by my sides. Orange and fiery, a few dark strands and a lot of silver threads. I touch one of the many silver strands surrounding me and I feel pain again, and I brief memory, like eyes opening.
"Anyone dying in this place because of my shell." Dray finishes the sentence, while he takes my hand again and leads me to a corner.
And I have seen his mental and physical improvement. His therapists have also seen it and this emotion that I feel inside my chest is called pride. Pride in everything he has accomplished in two weeks, pride in what I know he will accomplish very soon.
James smiles and immediately decides against the smile, separating himself completely from Draco's body. "Hurts, Daddy."
“Then, by all means,” she says, her blue eyes alight with something fierce shinning inside them. “Show me. Prove to me that you are Mr. Malfoy boyfriend, because other wise I am going to rise charges against you.”
A cold sweat runs down my body when I see the huge black cup that has a red star outside. I conjure a smile, trying to make all the panic go away.
“I love you both,” I say before gripping my wand between my finger and thinking about my destination.
A sick person, who is not interested in anything, Draco, was what Harry told me a couple of nights ago in the bathroom of our room. A magician who uses magic to torture muggles, witches, and dark creatures simply because he feels he can.
"In the magical police," Harry tells me in a hurry, as I look at said redhead. Now I understand why his body is so muscular.
The Patronus disappear in a burst of light-blue glittering bubble and I feel cold creeping up my spine. This is not good. Until I hear the commotion outside the room, healers rushing someone to the isolation room. The same room Draco was in when Parkinson and I found him the first time. Aurors following the healers, restraining someone physically.
I smile for him and leave a kiss on his smooth, soft cheek. My heart beats at a thousand an hour. However, when I walk away, the smile that Dray has on his lips makes me feel like the luckiest man in the world.
Suddenly Draco crushes our son against his chest and resumes his kissing attack, while Scorpius laughs quietly on the floor, looking at his twin with love. A love I will never, maybe, will know nothing about.
"Severus will keep them alive," Moody says, not paying atention really. He breathes and then... "Just like he protected you all those years. Because, did you caught him doing it, Potter?" I shake my head. "Let Severus do his job. He will never betrays you, Potter."
"Draco," is all I can whisper before capturing his lips with mine and laying him, tenderly, on my bed.
"Yes," I tell him, taking his hand in mine. "I think we should go, it's midnight after all," I tell Dray, noticing the weariness in his eyes. However, his smile remains firm on his lips.
However, when he denies his hair moves at the same time as his head, disturbing the golden halo that surrounds him.
"It was never our intention for any of you to find out in this way that Draco Black is alive," Zephora Zambroni's voice echoes through the room and I can feel the terror within me. "Or what he is." She is not someone you want to piss off. "Much less that the bond between young Potter and Dray forgging under such an aberrational situation." Zephora opens her eyes and I can see the white of her iris contrasting with the brown skin of her slender body.
"I am sorry about Ginny and George, and he way I said to your boyfriend that a psociopath is after you," he tells me and I can see his cheeks turn red. "I'm so sorry, Harry."
“You are here for a reason, Potter,” Parkinson almost yell at me. I see her pacing the room like a caged panther. “He is not sick. He is respectful as hell; he follows the rules. If he is sick, he fires call to let us know. If he is late, he fires calls to let us know. He is never, never like this.”
"They did the same shit to me, Regulus," I tell him, holding Dray tightly. "They will destroy him until there's nothing left." I gave up control.
This is from Mr. Weasley’s view. So, he was there with Blaise. I grip the memory softly, and then… It is opening in front of me. This is going make it easier for Arthur to let me see.
"My name is Dray," he tells me, as he puts the huge instrument on his back, then adjusts the case's straps on his shoulders. "What is your name?" he asks me in a soft voice.
Careful not to scare him, I open the door to the room and enter looking for Draco. And not finding him, I immediately fix my gaze on the door that leads to our bathroom. And there is my husband, his gaze fixed on the three scars left when the doctors tried to save his spleen. And when I look at Draco's face, I feel like someone has hit me in the stomach.
I nod softly and follows her outside. Her magic rush out of her little body and makes the door closes behind her. I see the grass covered in white and then, a green spot that is being lavished with old, powerful magic. The magic of the Vampires that runs this household.
"Tell your brothers to come down so they can say goodbye to Daddy, yes?" and I see James start walking towards the stairs. I stand up and walk to Draco, taking him in my arms and leaving a chaste kiss on his forehead.
I blush deeply when I hear Draco's tone, authoritative and without room for doubt. I take off the uniform of the aurors and everything else, until I am in my boxers.
“And they believed that shit back there?” I ask her, baffled by her words. “That a little kid will save their asses?”
The first baby blue ray is thrown and one after the other the people in the room begin to fall until only Ron and I are left standing. And yet Regulus, Albus, and Zephora seem to ponder what to do with us.
"Come on," he says, taking the light blue mug that the woman placed next to the black one. "You will love it," and then she blushes. "The drink, I mean. You will love to die.”
This was supposed to be posted last Friday, but I fell and I hurt my back pretty bad. So, I had to spent the last days resting on bed with a high muscular relaxant and opioids pills to get all better.
"I can, because drunk people usually say the truth. Specially if that truth is coming out of Theodore Nott's mouth," she says, smelling briefly around the house.
"It depends," I say, stopping in front of the teachers' lounge. "Do you know that Papa doesn't leave work until two in the afternoon?" I ask him and push the door open, letting Scorpius enter first. The truth is, Harry hadn't been home for the last 36 hours. He stopped in the morning, so the kids don't worry about his overworked Papa. Harry went home a few minutes that morning for his family.
the letters are glowing softly. Draco smiles at me and he hand cups my cheeks. We stare at each other for a few moments, then the letters begin to form a new phrase.
"Dray is not alive, Mister Black," I reply and the man just nods softly. "I thought I did bring him here after an incident with a Death Eater ... I thought it was the safest place and ... Now I don't ..."
“Take care of daddy while I am gone, Nesh,” I say to her, lifting her to my face and dropping a kiss to her beak.
“But, that doesn't make sense, Hannah. Scorpius only has a broken arm and… ” I choked on my own tears. "Draco... His body is so broken."
"Two weeks maybe," I reply in a serious tone. "We'd only had two dates, maybe." My voice breaks, my chest hurts and I try to breathe.
“Hey, guys,” is the only thing he can manage before a blush start appearing in his cheeks, spreading down to his neck in a fast way. “I, uh…” He fidgets with his hands and I look down, so no one can see the fond smile in my lips. “Thanks for coming.”
Lilly Evans, who took the beauty out of her from the Dark Lord. Lilly Evans who passed her power to hers brat her son through dark magic, blood magic ... And yet, people revere her as a good witch.
"He's a bit angry about Ginny's joke a few moments ago," Harry tells me. And it is understandable. "He's hurt, Ginny's joke hurt him,” Harry tells me, looking towards the balcony of the house, where Dray has a black block stuck to his ear, while talking to it. Maybe. “He is a Muggle, Sirius. There are many things that he still doesn't understand that fascinate him some how and that makes it difficult for him to talk to me, sometimes," Harry answers me, his eyes darkening sadly. “And really, I don't care if I have to explain things to him a million times if that's what he wants, I only care that, for today, he feels comfortable with the people I consider my family. Although, I'm sure Ginny won't make this easy for me or him," Harry crosses his arms, a pout on his lips.
"Have Harry go St. Helen and then to Andromeda's. I'll go with Blaise to Rosse Cottage," says Ron, as he passes his piece of paper to Harry.
The crazy woman from before is starting to stand at my left. Even if I am dangling in a cage from the ceiling, I refuse to be a damsel in distress. At least until Harry come to my rescue, then I can play hurt and dumb.
"Yeah, it a big and pretty College and a lady has a crush on him," Scorpius says as if he's talking to no one. "I don't think she knows that when a person has a ring on his hand it is because he has already found his soul mate."
"Oh, and I made cookies too," he tells me and heads to the oven to pull out a tray full of gingerbread man cookies. The bright smile returning to his lips. "I assure you that these are the best."
“Now, you said when I arrived here with the Malfoy’s that the Death Eater’s had already found you here. What happened?” Dumbledore questioned.
“That would be this one.” Meemy said, opening the door that Harry had first seen. “Will Master be needing anything else?”
“Remus, you obviously know who they are, but I want us all on equal footing. So, proper introductions are in order.” Harry said, before, “Draco, this is Remus. Remus, this is my absolutely dashing boyfriend, Draco.”
Harry carefully pulled her hands away from her ears, smiling as he started to reassure her. “It’s okay, Meemy. I was honestly just wondering why I couldn’t get in. If they locked it, I’m sure it was for some reason or another. I’m not cross with you.”
Severus cast a lightening charm on Lucius as soon as they had flashed away and carefully picked him up. A tear fell as he walked over to the Floo, but he angrily brushed it away with a swipe of his shoulder. Someday he would have time to mourn, but today was not that day. He stepped into the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder, ready to leave this place behind.
When the group had made it back to the house, Harry called on Dizzy to help Narcissa and Draco find suitable rooms.
“Yeah of course. I think there is a vault at Gringotts with some Potter family valuables inside it.  I’ve been meaning to go, actually. I’d really like to find out what’s in there. Who knows how much history is sitting inside.” Harry said.
Stripping the towel off and throwing it on the counter, Harry turned back around to step into the shower, which was billowing steamy clouds, practically begging him to enter.  He stepped into the glorious stream of water, and immediately felt the tension he didn’t know he was holding in his shoulders start to flow out of him. He let the water wash over him for a few minutes, trying to calm his mind as he did so. He didn’t want to replay the memory of last night, knowing full well that he would break down if he did so.
Harry stood up and wiped the grass off his trousers before taking aim at the boulder. He let the feeling of totally obliterating the rock fill him, letting the intent to destroy fill his mind. He took a deep breath before he calmly incanted the spell in his head.
“One more word, boy, and I’ll be the last thing you ever see.” He said, still using the hoarse whisper, causing Harry’s skin to crawl.
“Harry, I’m-“ was all the warning he had as all his senses were assaulted at once, and he violently came with a loud moan. His bum hole reactively clamped down on Harry’s dick, and it registered in the back of his mind that Harry had made two final pushes before he too locked up, but it had been pushed down as he rode his own orgasm, Harry stroking him slowly and lightly long after he was done.
“Master Harry, Professor Dumbledore is being at the edge of the property with two others. He is requesting you immediately, sir!” Meemy rushed out.
Satisfied with the results, Severus went to leave the room, only to find his way blocked by the house-elf that had summoned him, flanked by two other house-elves who were peering with wide-eyes over her shoulders.
“Yes. I find myself using it when I have need of a constant supply of fresh air in the potion's lab. It’s particularly useful when pranking unsuspecting teenage boys.” Severus replied, giving him a grin.
He was starting to feel his hope give out when something popped up in his mind. It was something that Bellatrix had shouted at him in the lobby of the Ministry of Magic. He had tried to curse her with an unforgivable, but the length the curse had lasted was extremely short. What was it she had said? You have to mean it?
Harry opened the door and headed inside. He could hear voices drifting down the hallway and went towards them. He ended up outside the door to the drawing room and stopped just outside it, trying to figure out if he was going to be interrupting something important. He realized it was Severus and Dumbledore and almost walked in when he caught what Severus was saying.
Harry groaned and lay on his back in the grass, using his shirt as a pillow. It was late again, probably eight or nine pm, but Meemy had been making sure that Harry was well fed, so he was in no rush to go inside. He chose to look up at the stars instead, tracing the constellations he could see every now and then, but mostly just enjoying the view. At the bottom of the west lawn, Harry could see the moon reflecting off the lake. It was incredibly peaceful.
“Now, though… I lost my best friend, Severus lost his lover, and Draco lost his father. The fact that you are doing your best to ease the pain, whether it be a distraction for Severus, a quiet place for me to mourn, or companionship for my son, I will forever be in your debt, Harry.
Harry let go of his wand and was shocked when, rather than falling to the ground, it shot to his forearm and disappeared. Harry looked at Draco and noticed that he was wearing a similar expression of awe.
Honestly, if the place turned out to be run down, he could just take the Knight Bus back to his aunt and uncles, couldn’t he? He would take a look around and make his decision then. Harry quickly bent down to grab his trunk, grabbed Hedwig’s cage, and made his way down the stairs to the first floor of the bus.
Severus thought about telling him the half truth he thought of moments ago, but the boy had been honest with him when he asked him his questions, and he found himself compelled to answer.
“Well done, Harry. Very well done, indeed.” Dumbledore said, walking forward to stand next to Harry. He clapped one hand on his shoulder and then continued to step through the wards.
“Just try to stay relaxed. Easier said than done, I’m sure, but I promise to be agonizingly slow until you say otherwise.” Harry said, lining up behind Draco.
Severus was leaning back in his chair. He had intended to provoke Potter into a reaction, one where he could press him for information, but he did not expect him to break down. Still, there were things he needed to get from the boy if he was going to be able to help him, and anger was apparently not the way to go. So, after making sure to rein his anger back in, he continued.
“No need to apologize, Draco. Really. I’m so fucking happy it’s not even funny. I’m glad that you were straightforward with me because I probably never would have said anything. Now I don’t have to second guess anything.” Harry replied.
They spent the rest of the morning relaxing in bed, deciding sometime after lunch to go down to the lake. They ended up spending a couple of hours going in and out of the water before ending up under one of the massive trees that shadowed the bank.
“Merlin, Draco. I love this so much! Remind me to really express my thanks to your mum.” Harry said.
He and Draco had collapsed into bed, more knackered than they had been in quite some time. It was a good tired, though, one that was brought about by spending time with friends and family and having
Harry sighed again, suddenly very emotional. His eyes started welling with tears, but he brushed them angrily away.
Lunch was served by Nipsy (a steak salad, served with charred corn, tomatoes, feta cheese, and a light balsamic vinaigrette) and they both ate quickly, starving after the flying, Harry doubly so after the physical morning he had running with Severus.
Harry watched as he spun around and headed towards the house, his robes floating alongside him. When he was gone, Harry turned towards the rock and cleared his mind. When he was sure he was clearly focused, he started casting nonverbal spells at the rock.
Taking a calming breath, wincing slightly as the move made his ribs expand painfully, Harry started off with “Well, Professor, I’ve been at the manor for a few weeks. I came here from my relative’s house following a … row, with my uncle. I had heard about this place in a letter from my mum- she mentioned she thought I’d like it here, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I took the Knight Bus, and when I got here, I was met by Meemy and her siblings, who’ve taken the most amazing care of me. I have spent the past few weeks exploring the manor, learning what the rooms are and have to offer, where things are located on the grounds…” Harry was saying, before being cut-off by Snape.
Harry was exhausted when he headed towards the manor for the night. He had spent all day trying to get his spells to have the required power behind them, but he had barely been managing wisps of light that either completely died out before they made contact, or hardly touched the rock and failed to have any effect.
. And I was absolutely enraged… but none of it at you. I will admit, I should have waited to make sure you were alright before leaving, but I will not stand by while that piece of
“I’ve already told you, Harry will be here any moment. There’s no reason for you to go bounding into the house.” Severus argued, though much more tempered than he was just moments before.
Smiling softly, Harry said, “Thanks Meemy. You are free to go back to whatever you were doing. I’ll call you if I need anything.”
Draco just kept going, seeming to get faster. Harry clenched his toes as he felt the orgasm coming closer and closer.
Harry closed the door and stripped his pajamas off as he walked towards the closet and fished around for a pair of shorts and a black tank top. He waved his wand at his mouth and cast a breath freshening charm, which caused his mind to go back to yesterday morning. He grinned at the memory before exiting the closet and moving over to the bed. Draco’s mouth was slightly open and both his arms were lying out in front of him. Harry wished he had a camera so he could capture this moment, but contented himself with leaning down and pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead. With a small smile, Harry left the room and headed downstairs to meet Severus.
Apparently, Andromeda’s daughter, Tonks, one of the Aurors that Harry had met previously, was expecting a baby, due in a few months. Harry was truly happy for them and happy that Narcissa had been able to reconnect with her sister.
“Yes, of course, Mr. Potter. I should think that would be perfect.” Narcissa said in her soft, elegant voice.
In his dream, he was reaching out, about to grab the Golden Snitch, when a Bludger hit him in the head from behind. Harry slipped from his broom and started falling. He had a few seconds of pure panic, but just as he was about to hit the ground, his dream changed. Suddenly, Harry was staring at the bowing form of a black-robed Death Eater. He noticed there were a few more positioned around the room, some guarding the door, others standing like statues along the walls.
“It was the end of term and I was bitter and depressed and just ready to snap… I don’t even know what set me off. I was walking around the lake at school and she came flying towards me, probably because it had been weeks since I saw her, and she landed on my shoulder and dug her talons in just a little too hard, and… I snapped. I yelled at her to get off me and the
“This feels... so different. Like I’ve found something I lost a long time ago.” Harry said, looking back to Dumbledore.
The cake was cut as everyone returned to their seats, and was quickly divided between them. Harry took a bite as soon as he got a piece and was amazed at the immediate rush of flavor. He originally thought that it was a plain vanilla cake, but discovered quickly that the shards of color actually melted in your mouth and held their own fruity flavors. Each shard could be identified, and when they melted together, they created a taste that was indescribably good.
When Harry didn’t say anything, the man continued. “My next, and only other condition, is that the things I teach you are to stay between us. I do not want another soul, outside of those already under the protection of this property, knowing what I have taught you. Do I make myself clear?”
“Of course, Draco. I’m going to go change into something a little less stiff than these jeans, and then I’ll be right back. Maybe you should change into some night clothes?” Harry suggested.
“I did it. I DID IT!” Harry all but yelled out loud, jumping into the air with joy. Only, when he did so, he felt like something along his chest and side had torn, and he quickly fell to his knees.  When he looked down, he saw that his shirt had been ripped, and he had a deep wound from his left collarbone down his side, ending somewhere right above his hip.
When he was done looking over the list, Harry put all the papers, including his mother’s letter, back in the manila envelope, and stooped down to the floor to pull open the floorboard under his bed. After making sure the package was secure in there, Harry got up, walked to the door of his room, and retrieved his food. A can of tuna and some crackers… Wonderful. But even with the dismal lunch, Harry was feeling happier than he had since the incident at the ministry, and he was determined to ride this high for as long as he could. If only it could last…
“I was worried about you. I heard you in my bathroom and then you left... I hope I didn’t cross any lines or make you feel uncomfortable.” Draco said.
The man said nothing for a few moments before finally speaking. “Harry, I don’t want you leaving the safety of these grounds until September the first. I know it’s not fair, but the weight of the wizarding world rests on your shoulders, and we cannot risk you falling into Voldemort’s hands, and this was too close of a call. That is all I will say on the matter, and I want your word that you will follow this rule.”
He had done his best to stop the bleeding, but he knew that he was in serious trouble. The headache, dizziness, and cold sweat that he was experiencing told him that, but he could do nothing except keep moving.
He figured if he could just make it back to his house, he would be able to send word to his remaining friends that he needed help. That was what he was hoping, anyways. He wasn’t even sure of who would come, since the latest incident he was involved in resulted in his Godfather and best friend dead, with one of his other best friends permanently injured. Merlin, he needed to stop that train of thought right there, he simply couldn’t think of Ron or Hermione, and especially not Sirius. Not now.
Harry knew his moment was coming, so he started breathing deeply, trying to get as much breath into his lungs are he could, so that he could yell loud enough to wake someone. He waited until Vernon took his hand off of his back, most likely to get his pants completely off, when Harry knew this was it. He started to make a sound, when suddenly; he had a brilliant thought, and decided less than a second later that this would be more effective than trying to yell for help. With all of his might, he swung his left foot back, and up, aiming for what he hoped were his uncle’s balls. With a satisfying crunching sound, Harry knew he had made contact with
Harry nodded and stuffed the last piece of his sandwich in his mouth. He chewed quickly and then drained the rest of his glass in one go.
Sorry for taking so long to get this out. Still not happy with it, but you be the judge! (if there are any spelling mistakes or serious violations of grammar, please point them out)
“Harry if you wouldn’t mind telling us the location of your home so that we could proceed inside? I’d rather like to sit down.” Dumbledore said.
“I’m sure we already missed dinner… Do you think anyone would notice if we stayed in here… Forever?” Draco asked with a small smile.
“Good.” Draco said, and his tone softened. “For the rest… Merlin, Harry. It is not stupid or childish to want to speak to parents you never had the chance to meet. I still dream of getting to speak to my father, and I actually got the chance to know him. Being angry about all of this is a good thing, believe it or not, so long as you channel it productively, and if I’m being honest with you, babe… There isn’t a person who can say that you haven’t been doing just that. You’ve made leaps and bounds this summer.
Harry felt the wards ring inside his head, and wondered what they meant. He had just finished his shower and was walking out of the bathroom with just his pants on, toweling off his hair when Meemy popped into his room. She looked worried, and Harry knew something was wrong.
Draco chuckled. “Simple breath-freshening charm before and after a blowjob. They always talked about it in the dorms, but I’ve never tried it. It helped quite a bit.”
Whoa, a chapter within a week of the other one? Whaaaaat? :) Hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Mere seconds later, the triple-decked, violently purple bus popped into existence; this time, though, Harry didn’t give Stan, the conductor he’d dealt with the last time, the chance to question him. After paying the Galleon fee that it would cost to get him from Surrey to Somerset, Harry quickly retreated to the upper floor of the bus. He chose the bed nearest the stairs, and had barely stuffed his trunk under the bed before the bus shot forward, nearly crushing his legs in the oncoming torrent of beds. He quickly jumped on the bed and leaned his head back on the pillows, silently praying that it wouldn’t take long to get there.
As soon as she had gone, Harry let his face fall into a frown. Why would his parents put such a strong locking charm on the door? Surely there was nothing of great value in there, when all throughout the house there were priceless works of art. If that wasn’t locked up, he couldn’t think of anything that would require such a powerful spell; he decided not to dwell on it, and instead went back to exploring the manor.
“Harry, please. It’s okay. I told you before; it’s none of my business. I do believe that was my son telling me of his new relationship.
Harry complied, focusing again on the wards. He could swear they were practically humming with energy, waiting for a command from their master.
“We need to move. The Dark Lord will soon discover where we are, if he hasn’t already, and I don’t wish to stick around for
“I thought about it, Professor. But, I thought you would make me stay there anyways, due to the protection offered by my mother’s blood.” Harry said quietly.
“They kept me in a cupboard under the stairs, telling me that ‘that’s where bad children’ were kept. They kept me there until my Hogwarts letter arrived, and it was addressed to
this situation since my learning of it only hours ago, from a beaten and battered nephew of yours, Dursley.” Severus sounded every bit as dangerous as he ever had.
The memory switched and Harry was now in a room with Voldemort and Snape. They were having a somewhat heated discussion, and then all of a sudden, Harry watched as Snape cast a
“Harry… I came to check on Draco earlier this evening and was confronted by a sight I had truly not expected to see.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
The voice that spoke from next to him just seconds later did not cause him to almost drop his wand, and it most certainly DID NOT cause him to scream like a girl, thank you very much.
“I need you to watch over him until I return. I imagine I’ll be gone until late tonight, but I’ll return before morning. Send a message should anything happen.” Severus ordered.
Perhaps he could convince Potter to let him see that later, but right now he had more pressing information to get to. He sifted through weeks of memories until he found one containing Harry and his uncle. It appeared to be late at night, and Harry was scared by the hulking man in his doorway... five minutes later, he was pulling out of Harry’s mind, rage burning its way through his veins. He wanted to be sick, but more than that, he wanted to
“First things first, Harry. You have got to stop bottling your emotions up. I know Severus taught you how to occlude, and it is such a helpful tool, but it doesn’t replace the inherent need that we, as humans, need to express ourselves or talk about our feelings, or just rage at something! Even if it’s not me, and I do not mind one bit if it IS me, you’ve got to talk to someone. Promise me!” Draco said firmly.
Harry reached down and started furiously jacking Draco off mere minutes after giving in to the boy’s demands to move. Draco, for his part,
. I was moved to Dudley’s second bedroom, assumedly because they thought someone had found out where they were keeping me.
Draco let him guide him to the wall, out from under the spray, and leaned his arm against it when he got there.
Dumbledore said nothing and continued to leave. Harry waited until he couldn’t hear Dumbledore’s steps anymore before moving towards the bathroom. He wanted to scrub himself clean after having taken two trips into Voldemort’s mind.
“Mrs. Malfoy will need some things picked up from a few shops in Diagon Alley. Would you mind grabbing them for her?” Harry asked.
When everyone had eaten their fill, Dumbledore stood and raised his half-empty glass of orange juice.
He followed Harry’s hands with his eyes as they ran all over his body, obviously enjoying the warmth of the water. Draco was lightly biting the corner of his lip as he watched and slightly jumped when Harry barked out a laugh.
He suddenly burst out laughing and didn’t stop for a long time. He had just accomplished something in a week that took most people a year. He was elated.
